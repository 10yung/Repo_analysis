Remove obsolete jQuery data tests.

The tests relied on `jQuery.cache` so they only ever worked in jQuery 1.x.

Keep in mind that Atom is highly customizable in a number of ways and we strongly prefer that you consider these options before filing this issue:

* https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/: tweak Atom's configuration, styles, and keybindings.
* https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/: install a community package.
* https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/: use the Atom API in your init script, to create a package, or to enhance an existing package.

If you're convinced that none of these options are appropriate for the feature you want, please explain why that's the case by completely filling out the issue template below.

Also note that the Atom team has finite resources so it's unlikely that we'll work on feature requests. If we're interested in a particular feature however, we'll follow up and ask you to submit an RFC to talk about it in more detail.

## Summary

I installed atom using the apt repo and .deb file. Both methods did not automatically install the 'build-essential' dependency that was needed to install packages within atom.
## Motivation

Let others have an easy way to solve similar issue.

## Describe alternatives you've considered

Could also just updated installation documents.

## Additional context

I am using Lubuntu 18.04 as my OS.
