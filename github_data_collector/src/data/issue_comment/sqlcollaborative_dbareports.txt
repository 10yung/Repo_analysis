Added datatype decimal to the function to avoid error when running job dbareports - Disk Usage
Error from pshell logging is: ERROR: Bulk insert failed - Exception calling "ExecuteNonQuery" with "0" argument(s): "Error converting data type nvarchar to numeric.
The data for table-valued parameter "@TVP" doesn't conform to the table type of the parameter. SQL Server error is: 8114, state: 5
The statement has been terminated."

**What is the current behavior?**

The info is not available

**What is the expected behavior?**

I'd like to see it

In [info].[Databases] I'd like some info about query store, e.g. if it's enabled as a minimum. What do people think?

This is happening on multiple reports but a specific example is the Disk Space report.  it assumes that the instance id and the server id will always be the same.  This is not the cause with a server that has multiple instances installed.  
I'm trying to install DBAReports on SQL Server 2014 R2 and keep getting errors during the process. I'm pretty new to powershell so please bare with me. I'm trying to install dbareports with the below parameters:

**_Install-DbaReports -SqlServer <SERVER> -InstallDatabase ServerAdminRepo -InstallPath C:\DBAReports\Powershell -JobPrefix DBA -LogFileFolder C:\DBAReports\Log -ReportsFolder C:\DBAReports\Reports -JobCategory "Database Maintenance"_** 

I'm getting the errors below:

I've used the _Test-dbrSqlPath_ on both the module directory and the destination directories for the scripts, logs, and reports and all are showing to be accessible. Any help is greatly appreciated. 

As an additional, less-important question, if I want the prefix to my jobs to be "DBA - ", do I need to specify _**-JobPrefix 'DBA - '**_ or just _**-JobPrefix DBA**_

Set the cost threshold for parrallelism to a high number on your server, such as 2500 (Don't ask I have just started at this company and there are some weird settings on some of the servers)
**What is the expected behavior?**
Data should be inserted correctly

All versions of SQL Server will be affected

**What is the current behavior?**
The dbareports server must have SQL level and WMI level access to the SQL instance being monitored

**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net
If the dbareports server cannot connect to the server, it cannot be added to the inventory

**What is the expected behavior?**
I have a closed network containing card holder data. I need to be able to monitor the SQL Servers in this network but they are on their own domain with a trust, and protected via a firewall. I am allowed to make an outgoing controlled connection from inside this network to my monitoring server outside, but cannot make the connection the other way due to company policy and PCI requirements. I would like to create a job on my "island" server to push the data via service broker to the monitor server. The monitor server then needs to add the sender to the inventory and store it's data into the repository.

**Which versions of SQL Server and which OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of our procedures?**
All supported versions

**What is the current behavior?**
All data collection occurs using the same proxy account

**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net

**What is the expected behavior?**
I would like to be able to specify a different connection credential for a specific instance. (If the credential does not exist then the Add-Dbr... command should create the credential & proxy combination and create alternative steps in the job to use that credential. The step should be intelligent enough to know not to pickup the servers that it's current credential does not have access to (something maybe [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent().Name could help with this)

**Which versions of SQL Server and which OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of our procedures?**
All supported
