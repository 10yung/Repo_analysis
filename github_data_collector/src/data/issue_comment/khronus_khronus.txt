Please write a spec for the REST API for sending data to Khronus in the Readme, including some example requests. I'm very keen to use Khronus, would save a few days digging through the code if the API were documented.

Currently gauges & timers are both histogram based metric types. The current gauges are intended to be used to record a distribution of observations of things like bytes or queue sizes. Timers records response times. Both can be merged into a new metric type called 'histogram'. Gauge can be rethinked as a unique measure of some event like temperature.

This affects:

1) Internally: design how to store, process and read dimensions
2) Api: add support to queries

Khronus admits posts with the same metric name without the same type (timers, counters, gauges). We can validate it when we detect a new metric and take some action.

I would like to graph the top 10 values of a long list of keys, for example

```
select top 10 count from "api:/request/apikey/.*" where $timeFilter group by time($interval) order desc
```

This would only yield the 10 apikeys with the most requests.

I have a query like this

```
select count from "api:/request/apikey/.*" where $timeFilter group by time($interval) order desc
```

in which the ordering is performed on the apikey description (the one I send as key when I call incrementCounter in the client) instead of the count value.  
I would expect the list to be ordered from the apikey with the highest count first, and descend from there.

Is the current behaviour correct? Am I understanding the concepts wrong?

In order to be able to use another graphing framework, embed data in our pages, or present it in a more custom manner, we'd need to retrieve the data used currently by Grafana via a REST api.
