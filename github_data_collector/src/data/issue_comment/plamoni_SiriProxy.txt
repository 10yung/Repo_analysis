`ROGUE PACKET!!! WHAT IS IT?! TELL US!!! IN IRC!! COPY THE STUFF FROM BELOW
30 37 30 30 30 30 30 30 35 61
[Info - iPhone] Got invalid data (non-ACE protocol?), terminating the connection.`

Firstly I was getting the error : 
`Either you're not root or tcp/udp port 53 is in use. DNS server is disabled`

so I changed the script to use port 8600 and use iptables to forward port 53 to 8600

`iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8600
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8600
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d localhost -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8600
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d localhost -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8600`

so I can run the servers now 
DNS Server started, tainting 'guzzoni.apple.com' with **172.27.28.149**

I changed my iphone DNS to use this ip  **172.27.28.149** as DNS

where ever I start siri, I can see terminal contacting my server but the siri says it can't connect to the internet, neither my mobile can connect to the internet. 

`[Info - iPhone] Received Object:

I'm not an expert in networking so kindly mind my silly mistake if any 



Just a heads up to anyone that comes here siriProxy is working with coolBooter for the time being

MacBook-Pro:SiriProxy-master k$ siriproxy gencerts
/Users/k/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.5/lib/ruby/site_ruby/2.1.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:54:in `require': cannot load such file -- siriproxy/command_line (LoadError)
    from /Users/k/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.5/lib/ruby/site_ruby/2.1.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:54:in`require'
    from /Users/k/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.5/bin/siriproxy:4:in `<main>'

why？？？

Now that iOS 8 is running on most of iphones, and enables a "homekit" api. What happens with siriproxy?

Hi guys,
I am an Italian guy and I recently installed SiriProxy on my pc. He works perfectly even 3g but when I replace my IP with the address of my dyndsn url, the server does not receive more requests. I have also tried to replace the certificate by following the instructions of the post "https://gist.github.com/chuchomtz/1558903" but it does not work.
I am registered on the site dyndns.it but I also tried to register to no-ip.com but does not work any way. 
If replace my hostname with my current public IP address it all back to work.

Can anyone help me?
Sorry for my bad english: P

Thank you

We are preparing for 1.0.0 release of RubyDNS. Changes are mostly performance and bug fixing, tidy up code base.

ioquatix/rubydns#28

If possible can you please test with latest 0.8.x and report back. We aim to do 1.0.0 release of RubyDNS by the end of this month. Thanks for your help!

Since the other topic gets flooded, we could continue discussing options for iOS 7 here!

For now (as I see it) we only have the google/yahoo option: so ask Siri to Google/yahoo something and redirect this request to your own web server to execute commands.

hi, 
team managed to intercept queries google siri to customize them.

How can we intercept queries google siri to send custom? 
Do you think we can get there.

This patch moves $APP_CONFIG into an object at SiriProxy.config. It also creates a new command +genconfig+ that creates the appropriate configuration directory and copies +config.example.y+ into it.

This lays the groundwork for people to use SiriProxy as a daemonized process on *nix with its configuration file in /etc/siriproxy.d, while retaining the original usage pattern of .siriproxy in the home directory.
