This project is awesome for writing new text, but I'd like to be able to edit text that's already present. Right now I just copy/paste it into Emacs when invoking emacs-anywhere, but I was wondering if this was possible to get automated?

### Runtime Environment

- OS: MX Linux 18.3
- i3 version 4.13 (2016-11-08)
- [i3/config](https://github.com/mrbig033/dotfiles/blob/master/i3/config)
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/mrbig033/dotfiles)
- GNU Emacs 27.0.50
- Org mode version 9.2.3
- [~/.emacs.d](https://github.com/mrbig033/emacs)
- [atomic-chrome](https://github.com/alpha22jp/atomic-chrome) version 20180617.724
- [atomic-chrome: use-package](https://github.com/mrbig033/emacs.d/blob/master/modules/packages/misc/movements.org#atomic-chrome)

### Issue

Emacs Anywhere works very well in all kinds of text fields, except for the https://learn.freecodecamp.org/ the editor. I tested on Google Chrome using both `atomic-chrome` and `ghost-text`. The extensions are able to connect with Emacs, but only part of the text in the field becomes available and my edits are not reflected on Emacs are not reflected in the browser. 
This would make it possible to just add it to path from anywhere, and it would even be possible to set up with `straight.el` and `use-package`. This kind of makes sense as it is strictly an emacs-related plugin so it should be configurable inside `.emacs.d`. It wouldn't be the first time that non-elisp stuff went into an Emacs package (e.g. `tide` and it's `tsserver` directory)

Hi again! been using EA for months on linux and lovin' it :)

Now at work have to use OSX and it works well. only issue is that emacs is always on space #1 and chrome on space #2. when i launch EA it takes me automatically to space #1 where EA opens. 
Anyway to define the EA frame to open on the current space where it was launched from?

thx!!

I'd like to know why there is no support for OpenBSD. Is there any tool been used that ties it to Linux and GNU/Linux distributions? What would be needed to add support to OpenBSD (and, while I'm at it, the other BSD's too)? 
On invoking the shortcut, I receive an error popup reporting 'The action “Run Shell Script” encountered an error.'

The popup has the options "OK" (dismissing the poup) and "Show Workflow", which opens "/Users/ree/Library/Services/", showing `Emacs Anywhere.workflow`. If I try to open it and run it in Automator, I get an error popup showing 

**The action “Run Shell Script” encountered an error.**
```
161:177: execution error: System Events got an error: osascript is not allowed assistive access. (-25211)
52:64: execution error: System Events got an error: osascript is not allowed assistive access. (-1719)
emacsclient: could not get terminal name
emacsclient: error executing alternate editor """"
```
With only an "OK" button.

After some googling, I found that the `osascript` error had been experienced by people in other contexts. In particular, I reviewed this stack overflow issue: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/291574/osascript-is-not-allowed-assistive-access-1728

Following that, I tried giving the `Emacs Anywhere.workflow` file a checkmark in `Security & Privacy > Allow the apps below to control your computer`. It didn't make any difference. 
Hello!

I would like to recommend a keystroke to update the content of the original window while still editing.

This is useful where the interaction with the text is much longer -- i.e. when one doesn't just jump into the editor and out.

But even here when writing this issue text. I'd like to:

- open it in emacs, change to Markdown mode
- type some text
- call some function to update the issue text
- check the Markdown preview, then back to writing mode
- continue editing in emacs
- ...
- close the frame, done

In particular I was thinking of this when using [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/new). There, the text input is in a Codemirror enabled area.
Attempting to paste into "Firefox Developer Edition", emacs-anywhere would close the frame and paste its contents into whatever buffer was open in the main emacs instance. Renaming to "Firefox" fixed the issue for me.

Hi @zachcurry, I have read on this wonderful package on Reddit and today I finally had time to try it out!

I am using i3 as window manager and Ubuntu 16.04 and will try to explain what happens when I use Emacs Anywhere.

Basically the emacs window opens fine and I can write, but on frame close i3 gets stuck for something that it seems like 5 seconds, without being able to to keypress anything except that canonical `Ctrl+Alt+F1/2/4/5` for terminals. After that time, everything goes back to normal. No paste happens.

Let me know if I can try something else on my side for debugging.

Thank you very much again!
