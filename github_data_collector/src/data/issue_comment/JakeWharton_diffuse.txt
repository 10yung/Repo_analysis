Have you considered having a lightweight version of input for this tool?

I'm thinking of something like all the important stats exported to a text file. Maintaining a bunch of apk snapshots (for comparisons) seems not to make any sense, when I could be maintaining a number of text files for a fraction of the cost. 

If the lightweight input was available I could be keeping the text file for every single commit on `master` (or at least X last of them) and using it as the base for comparisons on my Pull Requests.
Once it's released...

I'd like to use `dex-method-list` to find all the test methods in my apk. Our tests, unfortunately, don't follow a convention that I can use to parse them out, instead we rely on `@Test` annotations.

It would be very nice if the annotations of the method could be available, perhaps behind an option.

I tried to implement this myself, but I got stuck with the DEX file format and did not get the correct annotations out. Here is my WIP

If you can give me a pointer in the right direction, I would very much appreciate it.
