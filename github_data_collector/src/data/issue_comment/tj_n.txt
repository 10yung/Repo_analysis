Hi,

First thing to mention I'm in highly locked down environment with extensive change control.

The pre-flight check failed for sudo n 10.17.0:

```
  installing : node-v10.17.0
    curl: (7) Failed to connect to nodejs.org port 443: Connection timed out

  Error: download preflight failed for '10.17.0' (https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.17.0/node-v10.17.0-linux-x64.tar.gz)
```

If I curl to the url I can hit it fine. Are there other urls I need to allow for in out proxy to pass the pre-flight check? I also tried to short cut the install by downloading the tar and putting it into the cache. However, I couldn't find the correct location.

I'm still trawling the code to find out the urls I need to bypass or where I need to put the file. A pointer would be great thanks.
Installing node also installs npm. While this is a reasonable default, it is confusing and/or annoying if you have installed a different version of npm than included with node. 

It would be nice to support installing only node, and not npm as well. As a bonus, this makes the install much faster.

A possible implementation would be to use `rsync` as used in `nvh` for this custom install. It does add a dependency on another command, but only for this optional mode.

You would opt-in to the behaviour with the `--preserve` option (short flag `-p`), or make it the default by setting `N_PRESERVE_NPM`. As per nvh:

# n now works on Windows 10 (Windows Subsystem For Linux):

If enough people find that this works for them, the docs / README.md could be changed to reflect this.

### Windows version

_Windows 10 Home, Version	10.0.17134 Build 17134_

### Version of N
_n --version output: 2.1.11_

### How I installed N
Start up windows subsystem for linux bash prompt by typing Win key followed by `wsl`
Then, install using the following sequence:

    sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy
    sudo apt-get install npm
    sudo npm install -g n
    sudo n lts
    sudo npm install npm@lts -g
    sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/aal/.config

IMPORTANT NOTE:

 - change the name in the path when using the `chown` command above to reflect your home directory in WSL.
 - Then, exit the shell and start it up again.

After restarting the WSL bash window:

    $ node --version
      v8.11.2
    $ npm --version
      5.6.0

Tried installing other node versions, using 

    sudo n install latest

And got:

    $ node --version
    v10.4.0
    $ npm --version
    6.1.0

Similar to #199 (old issue solved) I note that after install "n" and use to switch between versions the firewall ask for permissions (Because I'm using also **ExpressJs** for an API Rest). The msg is "**Do you want the application “node” to accept incoming network connections?**"

I try to re install node and it's work normal, but if I switch with "n" (2.1.3), the problem start again.


Using Manjaro Linux 0.83 (XFCE Edition). Installed node 0.8.20 manually then used npm to install n. Have since used n to install several versions of node. Everything seems to be working, including switching node versions (as long as I do `sudo` but I figure that's given). I do get this error however:

```
cp: cannot overwrite non-directory ‘/usr/local/share/man’ with directory ‘/usr/local/n/versions/0.9.9/share/man’
```

Indeed, this is because `/usr/local/share/man` is a symbolic link to `/usr/local/man`. Not sure if this is applicable to Arch in general or just Manjaro.

Again, things still seem to be working; all that seems to be faltering is the copying of the man page, and that's fine really. Nonetheless thought it might be worth reporting.
