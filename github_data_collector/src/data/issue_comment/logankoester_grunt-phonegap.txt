Thanks for creating and working on this plugin!

(P.S. Close this PR if it is a mistake, sorry)

The documentation describes that inside the ".cordova" directory a JSON called "config.json" is necessary. I didn't find any official documentation about this file from Cordova itself, so what is the meaning of this file?

After running `$ grunt phonegap:build` I get the following error:

![error](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8310677/12139108/3a3cd73a-b45e-11e5-80db-1fffe0b84e8b.png)

My grunt task:

``` javascript
phonegap: {
    config: {
        root: 'dist/tmp/',
        config: 'phonegap/config.xml',
        cordova: 'phonegap/.cordova',
        path: 'phonegap-build/',
        platforms: ['android'],
        cleanBeforeBuild: true
    }
}
```

What is the reason? As you can see I have added the platforms array correctly.

Merge this to not have the default phonegap icon on the iphone 6+


``` js
ios: {
    // iphone portrait
    iphonePortrait: 'artwork/screens/ios/screen-iphone-portrait.png',
    iphonePortraitx2: 'artwork/screens/ios/screen-iphone-portrait-2x.png',
    iphone568hx2: 'artwork/screens/ios/screen-iphone-568h-2x.png',
    iphone667h: 'artwork/screens/ios/screen-iphone-667h.png',
    iphone736h: 'artwork/screens/ios/screen-iphone-736h.png'
}
```

The last 2 are always default phone gap. The paths are right, the keys are right. What am I missing? I've even checked the resolutions to make sure those are right.

per the docs https://github.com/apache/cordova-lib/blob/master/cordova-lib/templates/hooks-README.md

the hooks folder is now located in the root, and not inside .cordova. Therefore this does not get copied over into the phonegap folder and your hooks won't run.

I have a PR coming soon, I manually fixed this for now.

I get a lot of these now The command `phonegap local <command>` has been DEPRECATED. Is an update to use the 'phonegap <command>` coming? I can PR if it's not yet.
