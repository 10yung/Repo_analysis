我在运行sublimerepl的时候，他都会在一个新的标签页上运行，如何让他在同一个窗口进行调试
Similar to #481 , I have not seen a possible way to do the same but when multiple windows of Sublime Text exist.

The feature will be extremely useful specially when multiple monitors are used, so in one screen source code and in the other only results without having to close existing tabs and moving the new created to other window.

I'm aware of #481 solution, but it doesn't work in this case.
**Sublime text 3**: 3.2.1 3207
**OS**: OSX 10.14.6

Hello! Having problem with text from title when trying to launch Clojure repl.

I am using SublimeText3 with the SublimeREPL package and the Miniconda python installation. I have followed the instructions listed here to run python from SublimeText3 with a custom environment:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20861176/how-do-i-setup-sublimerepl-with-anacondas-interpreter

Yet, when I run the Python interpreter from SublimeText3, I initially get
```
Python 3.7.3 (default, Apr 24 2019, 15:29:51) [MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32

Warning:
This Python interpreter is in a conda environment, but the environment has
not been activated.  Libraries may fail to load.  To activate this environment
please see https://conda.io/activation

```
If I then try to
```
import numpy
```
I get the following error message:

```
>>> import numpy
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "C:\Users\USER\Miniconda3\envs\CUSTOM_ENV\lib\site-packages\numpy\__init__.py", line 140, in <module>
    from . import _distributor_init
  File "C:\Users\USER\Miniconda3\envs\CUSTOM_ENV\lib\site-packages\numpy\_distributor_init.py", line 34, in <module>
    from . import _mklinit
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
```

For other packages such as sympy, I don't get an error when I try to import the package. 

Similarly, if I run anaconda from the anaconda prompt and import numpy, it runs without errors.

So it seems that it is calling python from the custom environment but thinks the environment isn't activated and can't load Numpy.

Post is cross-posted here:

When I'm using replNode these days, it reports 'DeprecationWarning', so I removed `rli` in the node config file.

Hi, I am trying to use REPL to replace Rstudio, while I encountered this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29255651/57620066-472cdc80-75ba-11e9-88ac-eda967d7a324.png)
When I use python in REPL though, there is no such problem. Given my dir of R and python are both in English, I have no idea why R does not work well. 
I know there are already similar issues, but the problem does not go away only by changing subprocess_repl.py 
If I split sublime into 2 windows and put REPL in the below window(just like [this](http://i1.bvimg.com/683815/aa97d79ab4679d94.png)), the tab of REPL window is a little annoying. But if I click "Hide Tabs" in "View", all windows' tabs will be hidden. Is there any way to hide only REPL window's tab but not other windows' tabs? Thanks!
