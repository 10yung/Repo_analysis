Hello, I wrote a tool that can validate README links (valid URLs, not duplicate). It can be run when someone submits a pull request. 

 It is currently being used by 
- https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios 
- https://github.com/matteocrippa/awesome-swift 
- https://github.com/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps 

Examples 
- https://travis-ci.org/matteocrippa/awesome-swift/builds/96526196 ok âœ…
- https://travis-ci.org/matteocrippa/awesome-swift/builds/96722421 link redirected / rename ðŸ”´
- https://travis-ci.org/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps/builds/96763135 bad link / project deleted ðŸ”´
- https://travis-ci.org/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps/builds/95754715 dupe ðŸ”´

If you are interested, connect this repo to https://travis-ci.org/ and add a [`.travis.yml`](https://github.com/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps/blob/master/.travis.yml) file to the project.
