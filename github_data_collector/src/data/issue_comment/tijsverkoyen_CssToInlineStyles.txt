css media queries were filtered out (which makes sense as they're not supported as inline style), now that more and more clients support style tags in the head it makes sense to include them there when the source css contains them. 
MailChimp merge tags use `*|` and `|*` to open and close the tags.

When an HTML email is run through the inliner, these come back as `*%7CUNSUB%7C*`

https://github.com/tijsverkoyen/CssToInlineStyles/blob/master/example/examples/sumo/index.htm#L6 has an example of MailChimp merge tags, but I highly doubt they actually work.
Hello guys.

For any of you trying to parse site with CSS large enough (1MB+) and not getting any results make sure you set `ini_set('pcre.backtrack_limit', 1000000);` to higher value than 1mil.

I was parsing 3MB CSS and spent whole day debugging till found this is default config limiting preg_replace function.

Just letting you know.. Peace 👍 
Any font-family name that needs to be quoted because of being more than one word long gets removed and simply replaced with a quote.
Added an empty check in the convert function. If an empty HTML is given an Uncaught TypeError will be throw at $document->removeChild($htmlElement), because $htmlElement is null instead of a DOMNode instance.
We have JSON-LD script tags in our emails and they get a `style` attribute added to them, which doesn't make sense.

```html
<script type="application/ld+json" style="font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, sans-serif; box-sizing: border-box;">
{
    "@context": "http://schema.org",
    "@type": "EmailMessage",
    "potentialAction": {
        "@type": "ConfirmAction",
        "name": "Approve Expense",
        "handler": {
            "@type": "HttpActionHandler",
            "url": "https://myexpenses.com/approve?expenseId=abc123"
        }
    },
    "description": "Approval request for John\u2019s $10.13 expense for office supplies"
}
            </script>
</body>
</html>
```
i was trying to use this awesome class, but i can't event start.

i've been trying installing via composer and thru direct requiring. none of them are working.
it displays this error.

> Parse error: syntax error, unexpected 'class' (T_CLASS), expecting identifier (T_STRING) or variable (T_VARIABLE) or '{' or '$' in /wwwdata/system/olanda/invoices/mailchimp/htmltomail/CssToInlineStyles.php on line 160

my file is just like this.
```
require('vendor/autoload.php');
require('src/CssToInlineStyles.php');

$CssToInlineStyles=new CssToInlineStyles();
```
In my case of use I have to set e.g. `text-decoration` property twice to make it correct in all target supported mail clients. It means my links have `text-decoration: none; text-decoration: none !important;`.

Inliner gets logically only last value, it means link in `inlineCssOnElement` function has `$inlineProperties['text-decoration'] = "none !important"`.

It isn't problem to edit function to keep original styles and only add not included:
```
...
foreach (/*array_merge(*/$cssProperties/*, $inlineProperties)*/ as $property) {
    $rules[] = $property->toString();
}
$element->setAttribute('style', $element->getAttribute('style').implode(' ', $rules));
...
```
but which way is optimal for keeping both properties from `style` tag? Generally I need to add important or non-important version of property if miss in inline.

Has anyone idea?

Thanks in advance!
My site uses the PureCSS framework, I use php to `include()` this library inside a <style> block of my html email. At:

CssToInlineStyles.php:441
`$css = preg_replace('/@media [^{]*{([^{}]|{[^{}]*})*}/', '', $css);`

it's returning `$css == null` and stripping out everything including non-media queries.

I've stripped down the CSS to just this, and it is still failing:

```
<style type="text/css" media="screen">
	@media only screen and (max-width :480px) {
		.pure-form input:not([type]), .pure-form input[type=text], .pure-form input[type=password], .pure-form input[type=email], .pure-form input[type=url], .pure-form input[type=date], .pure-form input[type=month], .pure-form input[type=time], .pure-form input[type=datetime], .pure-form input[type=datetime-local], .pure-form input[type=week], .pure-form input[type=number], .pure-form input[type=search], .pure-form input[type=tel], .pure-form input[type=color], .pure-form label {
			/* anything */
		}
		.pure-group input:not([type]), .pure-group input[type=text], .pure-group input[type=password], .pure-group input[type=email], .pure-group input[type=url], .pure-group input[type=date], .pure-group input[type=month], .pure-group input[type=time], .pure-group input[type=datetime], .pure-group input[type=datetime-local], .pure-group input[type=week], .pure-group input[type=number], .pure-group input[type=search], .pure-group input[type=tel], .pure-group input[type=color] {
			/* anything */
		}
		.pure-form .pure-help-inline, .pure-form-message-inline, .pure-form-message {
			/* anything */
		}
	}

	.email-body {
		padding: .5em;
		max-width: 500px;
		margin: auto;
	}
	.email-table {
		margin: 0 auto;
		font-family: 'Lato', Helvetica, sans-serif;
		text-align: left;
	}
	.logo {
		width: 250px;
	}
</style>

```

but if you remove one random selector from the @media query block (ie `.pure-form .pure-help-inline,`) from that, it works again and the .email-body {} and below are being used. If it is as-is above, it remove all styles and .email-body isn't inlined.

Is there something wrong with the RegExp stripping out the media queries?
