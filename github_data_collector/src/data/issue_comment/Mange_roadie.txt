Hi,
we have situation that our outgoing mails contains some part of HTML page which contains a link to  stylesheets in query string form
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="?__debugger__=yes&amp;cmd=resource&amp;f=style.css" type="text/css">
```
Roadie raise error
```
TypeError: no implicit conversion of nil into String
```
in `build_file_path` method. 

I change this method to prevent this exception. `find_stylesheet!` will raise CssNotFound when no real CSS file exist in href.

A proposal PR to make roadie compatible with frozen string literals.

Since Ruby 2.3 it is possible to make the string literals frozen by default.

There are rumors that ruby 3 will have this option on by default.

Inspired by https://freelancing-gods.com/2017/07/27/friendly-frozen-string-literals.html
Run into this issue with `\b` char.

Example:
```
Roadie::Document.new("<!--[if mso]>hello \bworld<![endif]-->").transform
```

Output:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>\n" + "<html><head><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\"></head><body><p>world</p></body></html>\n
```

The comments have been stripped away, and all of the string before `\b` is missing.
This does not happen if the char is not in a comment.
This gem is now entering **passive maintenance mode**; I will not be actively maintaining it anymore.

**What exactly does this mean?**

- I will not guarantee any responses on issues or PRs. I will probably respond, but I cannot guarantee when.
- I probably won't add or change anything without prompting.
- Security issues *will* be fixed. Please send me an email as per the instructions in the README!
- Major bugs will be prioritized.
- Minor bugs will probably only be dealt with if a PR is opened.
- No feature request will be honored unless it comes in the form of a PR, and it's not even guaranteed then.
- It is okay to ping me on issues and ask for updates. Don't bother doing it after just a few days, though.

**Why?**

Maintaining open source software requires energy and a "want"/"passion". I've not been using this project myself for years, and I mainly work in other things than Rails at this point. That means I'm far removed from this project and see no personal gain in maintaining the energy to keep this going.

At work, I cannot maintain this project. At home, I'd rather spend time with my children and on projects that I'm currently passionate about.

I'm still pretty proud of the project and I don't want to see it gone, so I want to keep updating it when needed. But on the other hand, the feature set is pretty stable and well working now (AFAIK) so I also don't see the need to pretend to be actively maintaining it.

Please: Prompt me when things break and I will probably fix it. I won't guarantee how fast I'll move, but I'll try to make the effort sometimes. The bigger the issue, the more likely it is that I'll do something about it.

Contributions are welcome, like always. I love contributions and seeing other people getting value from this project. Keep doing it! I apologize for not replying quickly. :bowing_man: 

This is open-source. You can always fork and maintain that fork yourself if you feel that's warranted. That's how this project started in the first place, so I know the feeling. :smiley: 

**How long?**

I don't know. Maybe if I started to use this project in my professional life again I could find the time to maintain it despite being "boring".

I cannot guarantee that happening at all, so no timeline sadly.

**Can I take over?** (or **Can I become a contributor?**)

It's not impossible, but it's not likely I would accept someone I haven't worked with IRL or know on a personal level. That's because I want some form of creative control over the direction and I want to maintain the existing code style. If I know you I'm more likely to know that this will keep working the way I want it to.

Still, as I said, it's not impossible even if we've never met. Show me good PRs, bug triaging, documentation fixes, whatever and you're a candidate if you ask for it.

Actually, a triager would be very welcome; someone that can ask follow-up questions on issues, create test cases for the problems, and so on. That sort of thing. That would definitely make it much more likely for me to spring into action; just as good a finished PRs would be. (Probably even more; reviewing code takes energy!)

Let me know if you want to help out. :heart: 

**Closing words**

Thank you for these years! I won't be gone, but I'll have my back turned.
(Poke me with a soft finger if my attention is needed.)

Thank you for understanding. (Or if you don't, at least thank you for reading.)
Roadie should have some form of reporting system where it can scan an email for bad patterns and tell the user about it.

Suggestions for "warnings":
1. Report on invalid URLs
2. Warn about `<form>`, etc. in the email

---

Reporting should be transparent and optional. Ideas on implementation:
- Test modules. Include them, run the assertions on the email.
  - This would be better served with another gem, right? `roadie-doctor` or something crazy like that..?
  - Doesn't help with detecting problems in production, where dynamic helpers might've ruined something that would appear okay in `test`.
- Callback for both enabling and for handling problems.
  - Makes it _very_ optional. Sadly, also a bit of a threshold to climb to enable it.
  - See code sample 1 below.
- Store it on `Document`, when enabled.
  - Easier to enable and you can report it however you want afterwards. Might be more useful for more people since it's possible to send all of them in a single message.
  - See code sample 2 below.

``` ruby
# Sample 1
unless RACK_ENV == "production"
  document.report_problems = ->(error, doc) {
    My.logger.warn error
  }
end

# Sample 2
document.report_problems = true
html = document.transform
document.problems #=> [#<Roadie::Problem "Invalid URL: ...">]
```
