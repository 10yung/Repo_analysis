Not sure what's going on here, but I've managed to... well, mangle the dog. Or make him dance, not entirely sure.

1. Make the dog fully sit (hold V for a few seconds)
2. Release V
3. Wait 2 seconds
4. Tap V
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 repeatedly.

Is this an issue with the network, or just the Unity/demo code?
Request to re-open the issue #15 

Hey Sebastian,

When I was trying to run the demo, I noticed the mesh was off from the skeleton (as shown in the attached pic), could you please advise me what might have gone wrong there? 

Cheers

Hi, 
   I can't find the training data for SIGGRAPH_2017,  the link file is empty.


Thank you!
Hi, I know this probably isn't in the original scope, but I'm trying to build this project for Android, and I'm having no luck with Eigen. I've tried all manner of things. Did you have any ideas how we might be able to expand this to supporting android? Cheers
Hello @sebastianstarke ,I want to export the skeleton motion data to create a skeletal animation.But I donâ€™t know where are the related codes.Could you help me to figure it out?
I read the copyright statement in the readme with great interest and I don't have a fundamental problem with academic institutions maintaining ownership of IP generated under their auspices.

However I would like to ask whether this licencing is the default for all and any code generated in your University or whether there is a specific decision to apply it to some projects that might otherwise have been released under an open source licence.

I would actually prefer it if it turned out to be the second case. i.e. it wasn't a blanket default policy but was applied selectively when there was a genuine chance of commercial benefit.
