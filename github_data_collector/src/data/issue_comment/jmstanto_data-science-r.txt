I thought you might appreciate a markdown version of your text, which will make it viewable on Github, and more likely to be used by Githubbers (or whatever they are called). Right now, I've only added spaces to your text and I'll spend a week or so adding markup. 

Could you send me your images? I'll make a folder and add them as links in the markup. I can do it without the images, but it would look sweet! Also, I'm sure you would like the markup version to look similar to the PDF version.

Thanks for writing this and sharing it on Github.
