Hiya, was wondering if there were plans for a darkmode? Hope Im not creating a double issue here, couldnt find it myself.
Hello,
i installed fresh version 0.1.13 and run the app.
Then i opened the messenger, logged in and then the app opens the www.messenger.com
BUT the app contains still blank screen even i tried to restart it and log in again.
Also i tried to download again the app from the server.
I'm not sure if I'm the only one but I can't resize the left column anymore. At ALL! I can't see the settings button either.

For 2 days the app does not load any message â€“ the progress indicator stays forever. Sign-out/in does not help. Restarting the app does not help. Refreshing also does not help.
Since recent versions this red notice keeps popping up quickly every 30-60 seconds. It's very distracting when you have the messenger visible :

Any idea what it could be?
Messenger created a 31 GB changelog.xml.rss file, full of private machine data. I noticed because my laptop was out of disk space.

I believe this to be malicious. You can read my reasons here: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/issues/64793
Every time I restart the app the "desktop notifications enabled" checkbox is reset in the Preferences menu.
This is such an obvious issue that I feel sure I have missed details about it, but I failed to find it sorry.

When trying to make or receive a video call it says _"switch browsers. safari doesnt support calls..."_
My default system browser is chrome & I don't see any option to set chrome specifically for fb-mac-messenger. but I assume it must be using the safari engine.

Is there a way to set fb-mac-messenger to chrome engine? or whats going on with this issue? Thanks!

Mac os 10.13.6, fb-mac-messenger 0.1.13.x 
Application name title label `Messenger` is covered by window action buttons.

Hi!

Anybody who can fix this?

Hide the warning note when going in to the app conversation. (it's still there in the corner even when I enter the conversation, it should disappear)
