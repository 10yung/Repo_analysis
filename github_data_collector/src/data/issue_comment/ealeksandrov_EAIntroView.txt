There is a guide on how to release modular projects which also includes making it work with SPM: https://github.com/fulldecent/swift5-module-template
How should I scroll the desc view if I have large text. _scrollingEnabled_ is not working for me.


The **parallax** feature of your EAIntroView I believe is not documented? Also, when you say **parallax** in EAIntroView, it's the iOS 7's parallax and not the _**scrolling parallax**_. Are we going to have this in the future? Thanks! G.,
How can I change the height of skip button?

> I placed page control to vertical center.

is it possible to show Intro With Custom View From storyboard instead of Nib(xib file) ? 

about EAIntroPage you have  three attributeï¼Œ
@property (nonatomic,copy) VoidBlock onPageDidLoad;
@property (nonatomic,copy) VoidBlock onPageDidAppear;
@property (nonatomic,copy) VoidBlock onPageDidDisappear;

But it has limitations.
I hope you can provide some other attributes, such as
@property (nonatomic,copy) VoidBlock onPageWillAppear;
@property (nonatomic,copy) VoidBlock onPageWillDisappear;
like UIview life cycle,

Being able to  add some other attribute like UIView life cycle,  would be appreciated.

Thanks for the consideration.

It would be great to be able to customize the skip actions. Some apps need to perform some operations when the intro is skipped.

Plus the alpha fade when intro is skipped assumes, I guess, that the intro controller is presented on top of the app. This is not necessarily the case. In my situation it just adds a fade to black animation before dismissing the intro view, which looks a bit strange.

Being able to customize the skip action (block, delegate), or simply being able to override the "skipIntroduction" method (and declare it in the .h) would be appreciated.

Thanks for the consideration.
