Hi...

I am able to change options in select2 based on another select2 through following line:
`$('.select2-class').editable('option', 'source', [...]);`

Options are getting changed, but as soon as select 1 of the option then it is showing as "Empty" as soon as I mark for save.

So is there any solution for this.

And I can also see in editable element that source gets updated but input.sourceData is still holding old set of options.

So is there any solution for this? Please help.
Module Warning:

Instead of:
`background-image: linear-gradient(top, #fdd49a, #fdf59a);`

should be:
`background-image: linear-gradient(to top, #fdd49a, #fdf59a);`

Hi,
i need the possibilty to show the default html5-date field when inline editing?
is that possible? is there a workaround?

i tried the usage of textfield with custom tpl:

`$('.editable-date').editable({
                type: 'text',
                tpl: '<input type="date">',
});`

But now, I have another issue. The date for input field musst be in format yyyy-mm-dd, but before editing it must shown in german format (dd.mm.yyyy). How can I make this possible?

thanks in advance

Outdated syntax causes warnings with postcss.

PS. I know this addresses an issue from a 3rd party component. However, bootstrap-datapicker seems unmaintained. Or if you're using a fork, kindly let me know and I'll be happy to PR to that repo instead
For any input fields in the x-editables I want to attach a listener so that whenever a user opens let's say a x-editable popover textarea and makes an edit and clicks outside the popover it dismisses and the changes are lost. 
To prevent this I want to attach a listener for value change so that I can set the 'onblur' option to 'ignore' dynamically.
