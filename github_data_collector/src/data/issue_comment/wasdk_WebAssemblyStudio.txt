I create a new Wat project in

I edit a wat file with memory.grow and memory.size, such as the one below (just for illustration):

```
(module
  (func $add (param $lhs i32) (param $rhs i32) (result i32)
    get_local $lhs
    get_local $rhs
    memory.grow
    memory.size
    i32.add)
  (export "add" (func $add))
)
```
and on build this gets the following errors

```test.wat:5:5: error: unexpected token memory.grow, expected ).
    memory.grow
test.wat:6:5: error: unexpected token memory.size.
    memory.size
```
These are the same errors reported in https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/issues/852

Perhaps you need to update to the latest version of wabt in Studio?
How to build [`espeak-ng`](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng) at WebAssembly Studio with two options set as default for resulting executable?

Requirement: Build `espeak-ng` with [`-m`](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/src/espeak-ng.c#L77) ("Interpret SSML markup, and ignore other \< \> tags") and [`--stdout`](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/src/espeak-ng.c#L109) ("Write speech output to stdout") built in to the resulting executable (no other input options or output expected).

Expected result: `espeakNG(<text_or_ssml>, callback)` or `espeakNG(<text_or_ssml>).then(callback)`.

Goal: Ability to achieve the same result as `POST`ing input to local server

```
<?php 
  if(isset($_POST["text_or_ssml"])) {
    header("Content-Type: audio/x-wav");
    $options = $_POST["options"];
    echo shell_exec("ESPEAK_DATA_PATH=`pwd` LD_LIBRARY_PATH=src:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} src/espeak-ng -m --stdout " . $options . " '" . $_POST["text_or_ssml"] . "'");
  };
```

where input is

```
async function localEspeakNG(text_or_ssml = "", options = "") {
  try {
    const fd = new FormData();
    fd.append("text_or_ssml", text_or_ssml);
    fd.append("options", options);
    const request = await fetch("http://localhost", {method:"POST", body:fd})
    const response = await request.arrayBuffer();
    return response;
  } catch (e) {
      throw e;
  }
}

let ssml = `<speak version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US"> 
             Here are <say-as interpret-as="characters">SSML</say-as> samples. 
             Hello universe, how are you today? 
             Try a date: <say-as interpret-as="date" format="dmy" detail="1">10-9-1960</say-as> 
             This is a <break time="2500ms" /> 2.5 second pause. 
             This is a <break /> sentence break</prosody> <break />
             <voice name="en-french" rate="x-slow" pitch="0.25">espeak using</voice> 
             PHP and <voice name="English_(Lancaster)"> <sub alias="JavaScript">JS</sub></voice>
            </speak>`;
```

Can all of the required files be uploaded/written in the left panel, then set the specific 2 options as default, then build the wasm file?

Is the requirement and expected goal possible using WebAssembly Studio?


I compiled a simple Rust library
```
#[no_mangle]
pub extern fn one_plus_one() -> i32 {
 1 + 1
}
```
The `wat` text representation of this code is as follows
```
(module
  (type (;0;) (func (result i32)))
  (func $one_plus_one (type 0) (result i32)
    i32.const 2)
  (table (;0;) 1 1 funcref)
  (memory (;0;) 16)
  (global (;0;) (mut i32) (i32.const 1048576))
  (global (;1;) i32 (i32.const 1048576))
  (global (;2;) i32 (i32.const 1048576))
  (export "memory" (memory 0))
  (export "__data_end" (global 1))
  (export "__heap_base" (global 2))
  (export "one_plus_one" (func $one_plus_one)))
```
Please note the line `  (table (;0;) 1 1 funcref)`

# Issue
When I build and execute the above wat, I get the following error.
```
test.wat:5:20: error: unexpected token funcref, expected anyfunc.
  (table (;0;) 1 1 funcref)
```
# Solution
I note that the WebAssembly `wat` specification has been updated [1], specifically to use `funcref` instead of `anyfunc` for table declaration. The Rust compiler and the wasm to wat conversion tool `wabt` [2], that I am using appear to adhere to the newer`funcref` spec. 

Of course, if I change `funcref` back to `anyfunc` then the WebAssemblyStudio IDE will build and run the code.

Just wanted to let you know my experience and I am wondering if/when WebAssemblyStudio will adopt the wat spec as per the link below.

Thanks 
Tim

Associated Issue: #50

### Summary of Changes

* Ported over the WebAssembly demo code of rust-analyzer (available here: https://rust-analyzer.github.io/)
* Extended rust IDE functionality with the help of rust-analyzer
   things like go-to definition, find usages, hover, completions, code lenses...

Note that this slows down the whole webpack build by quite a big margin. Especially fresh builds could take minutes more. Maybe another approach could be taken to include the final .wasm binary?

### Test Plan

These changes have been tried manually by just trying stuff out in the hello-world rust demo.
Some parts work a bit less well than on the original rust-analyzer WASM demo because the monaco editor seems to be outdated. This could be fixed in a follow-up PR, as it might need some bigger changes throughout the codebase.

### Screenshots/Videos (OPTIONAL)
example of find usages:
![ra-lsp-wasm-studio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16452324/71211847-4e366e80-22b0-11ea-8cf8-eb91031821cd.jpg)

I've cloned the contents of this repo to my PC, did `npm install` and everything as per the README file.

The interface can be opened in the browser. But when I try to compile the sample "empty C project" or any other project, I get this message:

> [error]: Task build failed: file is null

Is there something missing the README file? I'm doing it in a git bash on Windows 10.
Currently, forking a workspace just replaces itself with the forked workspace. It may be safer and less restrictive to just spin up a new tab so that the previous workspace (and its URL) are still accessible.

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.
