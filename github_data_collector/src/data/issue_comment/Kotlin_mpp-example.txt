Hi 

Is this sample supposed to work on Android as it is ?I am getting a range or errors. Before i list them, can you tell me what i need to do after checking out master ?

After i checked out master, i added local.properties with the SDK info and set the signing team in XCode and then it worked fine

On Android it has been much more complex and i haven't got it to work yet 

Thanks
I'm running **./gradlew :greeting:iosTest** in terminal and getting following output:

```

Base on your documentation I expected iOS simulator to open and run iOS tests from _iosApp/iosAppTests/iosAppTests.swift_, however only common tests did run.  

Kotlin/Native supports building for iOS armv7 targets now, but the gradle script for the library only builds arm64 or x86_64 depending on the target.
How can I build a universal armv7+arm64 app for release?
Could not set unknown property 'targets' for Kotlin/Native test suite 'test' of type org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.plugin.experimental.internal.KotlinNativeTestSuite.
