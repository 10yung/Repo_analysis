@asadsahi Hi,
A quick question may be helpful to others.
Is it possible with your current code base we can get all users with associated roles?
If you provide me a code sample or help really thankful to you.
when i try to join user with roles there is no roles property and if i add this property then its not return roles.
 here is my code
can you help me .
var users = _userManager.Users.Include(u => u.UserRoles).ThenInclude(ur => ur.Role).ToList();

public class ApplicationUser : IdentityUser<int>
    {
        public int UserId { get; set; }
        public ICollection<ApplicationUserRole> UserRoles { get; set; }
    }

public class ApplicationRole : IdentityRole<int>
    {
        [StringLength(100)]
        public string Description { get; set; }
        public ICollection<ApplicationUserRole> UserRoles { get; set; }
    }

public class ApplicationUserRole : IdentityUserRole<int>
    {
        //public int Id{get;set;}
        public virtual ApplicationUser User { get; set; }
        public virtual ApplicationRole Role { get; set; }
    }

Added possibility of angular client generation by web api controllers.
For this purpose, restore npm packages and run command from ClientApp folder
```npm run build:apiDef```

Hi @asadsahi 
Your template is really great, thanks for the hard work!
The only thing missing would be SSR. Do you think it's possible to implement it like [this](https://github.com/aspnet/JavaScriptServices/tree/dev/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices#server-side-prerendering)?
Kind Regards,
Michael
