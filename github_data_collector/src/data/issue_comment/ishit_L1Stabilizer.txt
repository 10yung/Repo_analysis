Hello, I always encounter the following error:
Incorrect use cvx/subsref (line 13)
The subscript index must be a positive integer type or a logical type.
 p(k, 6) = p(n, 6);
n_transforms = optimizeTransforms(t_transforms, im_size);
I want to know how to solve.Thank you!
After reading the code,I find that the algorithm did't add saliency constraints according the paper,  I have try to recurrent this part of the code, but I encountered some problems now, and I want to know if you have recurrented this part code? If  you have finished it, can you share the code? If the code is unavailable, can you share some ideals?

thanks a lot!
