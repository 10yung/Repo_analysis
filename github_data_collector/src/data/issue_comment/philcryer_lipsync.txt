Testing the generic driver (https://github.com/docker/machine/blob/master/docs/index.md#generic) that is possible to use a domain name in the `generic-ip-address` attribute. 

For make easier to make others understand that is it possible, a good idea should be change it to just `generic-address`. I can make this PR if you guys like this idea. :+1: 

Please split system and per-user configuration and accept a path argument or env variable (`DESTDIR` preferred).

One great feature that Dropbox offers a versioning backup system.
Have you looked into implementing this with say, an automated git  repository on the server? You could even use git cloneing to nicely have an offsite backup, just like Dropbox has.

Some features that you would get for free:
- Cloneing
- File merging
- File conflict management (by using a repository for each machine)
- File transfer protocol

1. Client1 adds files to server and then disconnects.
2. Client2 adds files to server.
3. Client1 connects with --delete and removes every file added by client2
4. I'm sad and confused, halp!

when running /usr/local/bin/lipsyncd, I get the following error messages in lipsyncd.log:

Any ideas what might be causing this?

On a separate note, I believe I found two typos.  In install.sh, line 203, '$REMOTE_HOST':'$LOCAL_DIR' '$REMOTE_DIR' should be changed to '$REMOTE_HOST':'$REMOTE_DIR' '$LOCAL_DIR'

And in /usr/local/bin/lipsync, line 50, $REMOTE_HOST:$LOCAL_DIR $REMOTE_DIR should be changed to $REMOTE_HOST:$REMOTE_DIR $LOCAL_DIR

Hello,

I'm running lipsync on archlinux and I had some errors in the installation process. One is with all the `chown $username:$username`.
I don't know if there is a group with the same name as the username in ubuntu and debian but not in archlinux. Is there a reason to do it that way ?

I fixed it using `group=$(id -g $username)` and `chown $username:$group` everywhere.

New files are not detected by lipsync on the client, and consequently deleted every cron sync, until lipsynd is manually started. 

I had to add lipsynd to startup with update-rc.d on all clients

```
update-rc.d lipsyncd defaults
```

Just setting up lipsync for the first time. I've run through the install.sh with elevated privileges and supplied all the arguments to generate to the /etc/lipsyncd conf file. Everything in there looks great.

Initial sync interprets the input for client directory as that fullpath, but on the server, rather than the client (local machine). I do not believe this is expected behavior. I've tested this several times. If I specify a fullpath that does indeed exist on the laptop ("client"), it will report that the directory does not exist, unless I create it on the server first, in which case it will work successfully. The client machine then syncs files correctly, but between the "client" and "remote" folders, both of which are on the remote machine ("server").

Am I misunderstanding something? Should there be both client and server folders on the server, and then I should set  up my own rules for syncing? Should each client have its own folder on the server, in addition to the server master copy, or is this not expected behavior, as I suspected?

i hope i can have a ignore list in client to ignore to sync some files to server. I do not need to sync some files from server to my client_A; But these files need to sync from server to my client_B. 

When a computer is in a network that needs a proxy, the cron job fails.

How can we add proxy handling to the application ?
