Hello 

I've installed this module on Powershell Core for Linux. Powershell has imported successfully the module, but when I put the command in a powershell session I receive an error message, thath the term Invoke-CommandAs has not been recognized.

Is this module designed only for Powershell Desk on Windows?

Best Regards

Cannot pass $variable from parent session with $Using:variable like the native invoke-command
Running as system administrator, impersonating a user doesn't work. I expect whoami to return 'MyUser'.

```
PS C:\windows\system32> whoami
nt authority\system
PS C:\windows\system32> $user="MyUser"
PS C:\windows\system32> $pass="MyPass"
PS C:\windows\system32> $secpass = ConvertTo-SecureString $pass -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\windows\system32> $cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $user,$secpass
PS C:\windows\system32> Invoke-CommandAs -ScriptBlock { whoami } -AsUser $cred
nt authority\system
```
