First of all, thank you for the awesome framework.

I currently got a problem with it displaying a sentence when a tableView is empty. The problem here is that the containing tableView changes size due to business logic and by that the text get wrapped from 1 line initially to 3 lines, making the animation look weird.
My proposal for that would be to expose a variable like `maxLabelWidth?` that (if set) applies a constraint to the UILabel (like `UILabel-width <= maxLabelWidth`).
Would be awesome if you could add this in a future version!
Is there a way to acquire a reference to the ActionButton?  I want to present a popover when the action button is pressed and I need this reference to position it correctly.
Is there an easy way to make my status views cover the whole view of the viewController?
These covering views should also dynamically adapt to the size of the viewController on different devices.
Awesome project

Perhaps add an example that shows best practice of using `StatusProvider` with a `UITableViewController`. This would be very helpful

I'm not sure if I should make use of `tableView.backgroundView` or set `tableView.separatorStyle = .none` or show a view that covers the tableView.

Any reason for having the `s.ios.deployment_target` pointing to iOS 9? I checked the code and unless I'm missing something I don't see a reason why not supporting iOS 8...
