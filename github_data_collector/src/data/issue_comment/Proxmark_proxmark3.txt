Looks like the card didn't response to the update command.

When you run ```hf mf nested``` against a card that does not respond at all to a bad key (instead of NACKing it like it should), the pm3 gets stuck in a loop and requires you to pull the USB cable.

Adding a ```if(BUTTON_PRESS() || usb_poll_validate_length())``` inside the inner ```while(target_nt[i] == 0)``` loop in ```void MifareNested()``` fixes it; I'll create a pull request for this in a bit.

Why can't I eavesdrop data
Normal APDU responses have a maximum total size of 258 bytes: that's 256 bytes of data and a two-byte response code.

[Extended APDU](https://docs.oracle.com/javacard/3.0.5/prognotes/extended_apdu_format.htm) responses can have a maximum total size of 65538 bytes: 65536 bytes of data and a two-byte response code.

The proxmark3 firmware currently supports a maximum response size of 512 bytes, which is 510 bytes of data and a two-byte response code. This is normally adequate, but in some cases larger return values need to be handled.

For example, the [root CA certificate in a Tesla Model 3 Key Fob](https://gist.github.com/darconeous/2cd2de11148e3a75685940158bddf933#ins-0x06-get-certificate) is somewhat larger than 510 bytes. When requested, the entire certificate is included in the APDU response. There is no way to fetch subsets in order to build up the certificate over multiple APDU requests: the only way it is returned is as a large chunk.

Supporting the maximum theoretical 65538 byte length might not be practical (Java Card itself doesn't support larger than 32768), but 512 seems too small. Please consider doubling (1024) or quadrupling (2048) the maximum supported extended APDU length.
Using “HF 14a snoop” command， to packetcapture，in proxmark3，Cannot capture card reader data，Card reader is the product of Fudan Microelectronics Company in Shanghai, China，The website is www.fmsh.com.
Only grab the data of the card.
It should be that proxmark 3 does not currently support it.

Hello, 

this github issue is not strictly related to this repository but I hope someone will be able to help me anyways

I found on the internet the "Proxmark III getting started guide"
https://initrd.net/stuff/proxmark3/doc/Proxmark%20III%20-%20Ubuntu%20GSG%20v1.pdf

That guide mentions devkitARM and that it needs to be installed in version "release 32". Unfortunately, the link to this version is down, and I need exactly this version for another project of mine (unrelated to proxmark). I searched your forum and wiki, and found this old revision of a wiki page where it says you need devkitARM r41 (but the download link is dead as well): 
https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3/wiki/Ubuntu-Linux/1c06bcc8487e76eb4285096dcec17e42922af61c

I looked through the forum and found various mentions that devkitARM is required (or isn't required in some cases, I guess that's why it was removed from the github wiki page), but I was unable to find a working download link and I really need that version of devkitARM (r32). 

Does anyone of the proxmark3 team still happen to have a working download link for devkitARM_r32-i686-linux.tar.bz2? If not, does anyone have a working link for any other version? Maybe I can get it to work with some other older version as well, but it doesn't work with the versions that are currently available for download from the devkitPro team.

I really need that old r32, and the PDF file I found is the only hit on Google that contains any information about that, so I'm hoping anyone reading this issue report will be able to help me. 
I'm sorry for using this bugtracker for a request that has nothing to do with proxmark3 itself, but the mail address on the webpage (http://www.proxmark.org/) wasn't working (I received a "Undelivered Mail returned to sender" error mail) and I wasn't sure how to best contact you. 

(This current situation aside, I am maintaining an archive of all devkitARM / devkitPro versions I could ever find at https://wii.leseratte10.de/devkitPro/devkitARM/ , but most of the old versions are only Windows builds. Maybe some of this will be helpful for you at some point, and I would be glad if you could help me complete this as well if you have any versions that aren't in there yet).

Best regards,

I noticed when I close all windows created by QT at once, using "Close all windows" in Windows 7, the client will just exit. The command line window with the client is running is of cause not in the list of windows when using "Close all windows". When closing every windows on its own this does not happen.

I am not sure if this is only Windows related, I tried it on Linux Mint, but the QT windows are not grouped there so I can only close one by one.
It's required to compile on aarch64 and doesn't hurt on
other platforms
