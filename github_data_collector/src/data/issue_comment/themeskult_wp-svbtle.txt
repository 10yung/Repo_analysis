Logo is like this. Thx!

The demo link "View Demo" listed on README.md is pointing to a 404 page.

A post of mine is being displayed differently in the category view from the individual post view.

More specifically new line tags, `<br>` are correctly appearing between lines on post pages but are not appearing on category pages.

For example the following post content per the database:

```
line 1 <br> line 2 <br>
```

will appear as two lines on the post page but as one line on the category page

The issue originates from `loop.php` line 13 `get_excerpt()`. I know using `get_excerpt()` is a standard WP function but I think it would be better to use `get_content()` for this theme.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks!

Hello,

The jQuery loading from wp-svbtle seems to be breaking some other plugins (see here):

How can I fix this?

Thanks in advance :)

I'm kind of a novice at this, but wanted to check out the theme for a small project I had in mind.  When I finished the installation and tried to login at yourdomain.com/wp-svbtle, I got redirected to 1&1 with an affiliate link. 

**Is it really necessary to obfuscate an open source projects javascript?**  How are we supposed to help you add changes to the code if we can't edit it when we find things that could work a bit better?

I realize its not 100% obfuscated, but its so incredibly hard to read when you're naming your functions single letters with zero description.

Add simple post thumbnail support and have image shown at the beginning of the post.

Linked demo seems to be missing on Heroku

Sorry guys, I'm not very adapt to CSS. Couldn't find where to do decrease spacing on right and increase the content area width.

Please help me out. Thanks !
