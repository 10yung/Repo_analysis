I use this package with the "love" example and find that the results are both OK in Win10 and Ubuntu 16.04, however when I run the code in Mac OS, the Chinese characters cannot display correctly, they only show polygons. I also use wordcloud package and find the Chinese characters are OK, too. Even I set the text font family in theme function, it doesn't work. Can you tell me how to deal with it? Thank you!
Hello,

I love this package and am eternally thankful for your reimplementation in ggplot. 
I have managed to reproduce almost every wordcloud your provide in the vignette except the mask. 

I have struggled with all aspects and cannot seem to get the mask function to work at all. There is no error at all on the console, but the masking is not applied to the resulting cloud. I have also replaced the default hearth.png mask with my own files in /extdata/ but same (lack of) issue.

Could this be something specific to my R install? I did not see this coming up as an outstanding issue, but I noticed a number of folks asking about this on the wordcloud2 forums.

Thanks again for this most excellent package
