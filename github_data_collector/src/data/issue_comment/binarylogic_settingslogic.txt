Thanks for awesome gem üëç
Hey there,

Just wanted to ping you, that there is no license in the rubygem version of your gem. It would be super cool to add it, as it pings our monitoring system about using gems that are without any license:

https://rubygems.org/gems/settingslogic/versions/2.0.9

Thanks in advance!
- Ported tests to support RSpec 3 syntax
- Updated Gemfile.lock


Immediately after updating the YML file I call upon the reload! function to make sure the variable I use to read the YML file values are also updated. But the variable is not being reflected fast enough. I am forced to call upon reload! function every time I use the variable just to make sure the correct value is being read. This causes a horrible performance issue since it unnecessarily loads the YML file over and over again. 

Making the file uneditable, including getting git errors saying "unable to unlink (bad file descriptor)"

As soon as I shut down the rails server, the file is not locked anymore.

Files on my Windows 7 host, rails server in my Ubuntu 12.10 VirtualBox (symlinked network folders).

Has this gem been abandoned? From the increase in pull requests and lack of merging I'm assuming so. 

But I'm still happily using SettingsLogic in my projects. :) I'm curious if anyone is maintaining a replacement or has found a better implementation of the project's features?

Any plans to support %Z - Time zone abbreviation name?

This PR adds the ability to create a settings class with a nested namespace, so the "base hash" can be fetched from inside some yaml key.

``` ruby
  # /some/file/here.yml
  professional:
    preferences:
      order: desc
  client:
    prefs:
      order: asc

  class ProfessionalPreferences < Settingslogic
    source "/some/file/here.yml"
    namespace "professional.preferences"
  end
```

```
  >> ProfessionalPreferences.order
  => "desc"
```
