Ubuntu 18.04 Server LTS

It is running behind an openvpn tun0 and I have a pretty strict firewall setup.  However, I have been using Sonarr for a while with no problem and I just setup Radarr tonight.

All requests fail, not just this one.  But here is a stacktrace for example:

I can ping/curl the url so I know it is not a problem with my network config.  

Thanks.
Get the following error when radar goes to update a movie to a better version: 
couldn't import movie destination already exists

Looks like Radarr won't remove the old file and replace it with the new one
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I would like to download the original language version of a movie in all cases, unless when it is not available when I would like to download the language I speak.  The issue at the moment is that in profiles there only seems to be ways to ban words, like MULTi and FRENCH/SPANISH/ITALIAN, but no way to say 'except if the movie is foreign language'.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like an option to ban dubs and prefer the original language, this could be done by checking the language on imdb/tmdb and then preferring that language when calculating downloads.  In the case that nothing is found, that is when we go and check the 'system' language or the keyword 'DUBBED' and/or  'MULTi'.  For native movies, FRENCH/SPANISH/ITALIAN should be banned, whilst MULTI and DL are degraded in priority.  Ideally the tags should be configurable under a language setting.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Any variation on tagging and filtering that could be used, for example different profiles selected based on language, although this would be more complex to setup and monitor.

**Additional context**
I hate dubs, and unfortunately I have to ban FRENCH/SPANISH/ITALIAN tags, along with dubbed.  What's happening is I'm getting a lot of MULTi and DL and have to strip the audio tracks (shaving off ~1-2gb of wastage).  The issue is when it comes to old movies, and especially horror that might be dubbed originally (i.e. pan-european production), or when MULTi/DL is the only option.
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
At the moment, Radarr works on a hard hit or miss based on quality profiles and tags. i.e. do not get movies with MULTi, do get movies with FRENCH, however this means that when MULTi is the only options, or the movie is French, it would not download the only options.  Instead of working in a direct hit approach, it would be good to reduce the 'score' of MULTi and FRENCH releases.

With custom formats, this follows the same approach of direct hits, and instead of saying boost this word, say DTS-HD, and handicap this word, say FRENCH, it is more of a filtering option and will lead with complex overlays of profiles for each keyword, instead of a globally applicable boost list that can be applied on top of the 1080p, etc. profiles.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like the ability to provide a list of words to boost the score of a download option, and a list of words to handicap the score of a download option.  This could be a simple list of words that boost a ranking and one that handicaps, that is filtered to the download list to sort it, ideally displaying the overall points calculation when doing the search 'manually'.

![example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2076285/72663364-54745380-39f2-11ea-8636-b123c1cf692f.png)

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A list of preferred words if its easier, although a list of handicaps would make this feature better/more accurate.

**Additional context**
I am trying to download native, original language rips of movies from around the world fed in from multiple lists, and I see MULTI language or DL language rips being grabbed over the undubbed versions, meaning I have to go in and process the videos.  The issue is if i ban MULTi or DL, in some cases these are the only options.  Similarly, some ripping crews are preferred over others, and there isn't an easy global way to apply to all quality profiles.  I also want to downrank AVC for example, but if I get them don't bother downloading another profile (see it as cutover)

Hello,
I have enabled the file renaming to rename folders.
Regarding files, I have setup {Original Filename} and Replace Illegal Characters=NO

But the system is still replacing ".." to "." when making the hardlink.
Can you help me to fix?

**Expected behavior**
Keep original filename

**Debug Logs**

19-10-26 17:26:54.4|Debug|DiskTransferService|HardLinkOrCopy [/media/Downloads/movies/Spiderman.3.2007.MULTi.2160p.UHD.BluRay.x265-SESKAPiLE/spiderman.3..2007.multi.2160p.uhd.bluray.x265-seskapile.mkv] > [/media/Movies/Spider-Man 3 (2007)/spiderman.3.2007.multi.2160p.uhd.bluray.x265-seskapile.mkv]
I'd be interested in being able to remove releases from Radarr's queue without removing from my torrent client as Sonarr now [allows.](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/pull/3262)

Unfortunately, the way I am set up, I can't get around my issues by changing labels. 



**Describe the bug**
After updating files get renamed like this

ORG FILES:
Smokey.and.the.Bandit.Part.3.1983.NORDiC.1080p.BluRay.x264.mkv
Smokey.and.the.Bandit.Part.3.1983.NORDiC.1080p.BluRay.x264.fi.srt
Smokey.and.the.Bandit.Part.3.1983.NORDiC.1080p.BluRay.x264.da.srt
Smokey.and.the.Bandit.Part.3.1983.NORDiC.1080p.BluRay.x264.no.srt
Smokey.and.the.Bandit.Part.3.1983.NORDiC.1080p.BluRay.x264.nfo

RENAMED FILES: (ONLY SRT FILES GETS THE .1. )
Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983) [Bluray.1080p.x264.8Bit.DTS.2.0].mkv
Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983) [Bluray.1080p.x264.8Bit.DTS.2.0].1.fi.srt <-----
Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983) [Bluray.1080p.x264.8Bit.DTS.2.0].1.da.srt <-----
Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983) [Bluray.1080p.x264.8Bit.DTS.2.0].1.no.srt <-----
Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983) [Bluray.1080p.x264.8Bit.DTS.2.0].nfo-orig

**Expected behavior**
Just renaming like before without the ".1"

the naming scheme:
{Movie Title} ({Release Year}) [{Quality Title}.{MediaInfo.VideoCodec}.{MediaInfo.VideoBitDepth}Bit.{MediaInfo.AudioCodec}.{MediaInfo AudioChannels}]


**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]
I cross seed a lot and the problem I run into is I have to rename files to cross seed but I can't do that in radarr so I have sftp into my server, find the files, then rename them to what I want. Then I have to go to radarr and sync with the new file name.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'd like to be able to rename files to whatever I want manually. In the files tab of a movie there's already a setting cog to manually set the quality, tags, etc, I'd like an input there to rename the file as well.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
there's no alternatives in radarr, you can set a way for all movies to be renamed to a preset format but I don't want to break seeding. Generating hard links from radarr would be cool too but I'd rather have file renaming capability.
