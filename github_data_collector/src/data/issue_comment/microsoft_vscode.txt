How about using the font from JetBrains [(JetBrains Mono)](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) as the standard font?

The font was specially made for coding and will be used in every JetBrains IDE from now on (IntelliJ IDEA, etc.) The font has a full set of features, which are meant to improve the coding experience.

I think it's way better to read, and the [`ligatures`](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/#ligatures) are very useful to me (ligatures are disabled in VSCode by default tho).

For example:

I could explain all the features of the font, but that would take too long.
I would suggest checking out: https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/#key-features

It's also free to use:

> JetBrains Mono typeface is available under the Apache 2.0 license and can be used free of charge, for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. You do not need to give credit to JetBrains, although we will appreciate it very much if you do.

## Obviously this is just my opinion, but I feel like this font fit's very well into VSCode as it provides a better coding experience (to me).

Feel free to drop your thoughts about this :)
Peek Problem messages don't seem to be wrapping for me or displaying a scroll bar. I don't know what the expected behaviour is meant to be.

It looks like it's the same issue in:
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77941

Except, the error message doesn't resize whenever I resize VSCode; it just keeps cutting off more of the message:

- VSCode Version: 1.41.1
- OS Version: Ubuntu 19.04

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Set "Ubuntu Mono" as font
2. With the default size (14) it should look small (at least in a hidpi screen with a 2x scaling factor)
3. Increase its size to 16
4. Now parts of the GUI show way too big fonts (documentation popups, python interactive window output, etc)

<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->
Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes

So, to recap: I'm unable to use Ubuntu Mono: it's either too small or it plays bad with other parts of the GUI. My screen is 3000x2000.

I love the toggle fold command, because I can use the same keyboard shortcut to fold and unfold (I'm using space bar with a when expression that checks to see if I'm in normal mode [vim extension]). However, the fold/unfold recursively does not have a toggle. I have unfold recursively set to shift+space, but I wish I could have that fold recursively as well.

When I hover over `css.colorDecorators.enable`, `scss.colorDecorators.enable` or `less.colorDecorators.enable` in the `settings.json` file, I get this:

- VSCode Version: December 2019 Insiders Build
- Demo extension - https://github.com/pgfearo/vscode-xslt-tokenizer
- OS Version: MacOS Mojave 

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open the demo extension in vscode insiders edition
2. Launch the extension
2. In the developer host, create an .xpath file and type in expression with nested brackets, predicates or braces. 
4. Select left outer bracket, the matched bracket highlight will be on the nearest right bracket, not the corresponding right bracket. Sometimes no brackets are highlighted at all.
5. Note: If the subtle-brackets extension is installed the bracket matches are correct.

Node.js: 12.8.1
V8: 7.8.279.23-electron.0
OS: Darwin x64 19.0.0

Steps to Reproduce:

1. On a fresh-installed of VS code insiders, open a `.js` or `.jsx` file.
2. Watch carefully for some syntax colors changing after a few seconds.

Check this link for the demo: [https://imgur.com/3CkhTIn](https://imgur.com/3CkhTIn)
As seen on the demo, the syntax highlight on the `<LatestBlog/>` and `<div>` turned to plain color a few seconds after changing Color Theme.

Here's a snippet for testing purpose:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

import Default from '../layouts/Default/Default'
import SEO from '../utils/seo'
import Intro from '../components/Intro/Intro'
import LatestBlog from '../components/LatestBlog/LatestBlog'

const Homepage = () => {
  return (
    <Default>
      <SEO
        lang="en"
        title="Home"
        author="Ongki Herlambang"
      />
      <Intro />
      <LatestBlog data={edges} />
      <div>
        Hello world!
      </div>
    </Default>
  )
}

export default Homepage
```

This is what happens when the sync server is down, a better error message would help with diagnosis.
