The time has come to move {tigris} to version 1.0.  Tracking changes necessary here to make that happen.  


- [ ] Change the default data class to `sf` rather than `Spatial*DataFrame`
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect this change with newer plotting functionality (e.g. `geom_sf()`)
- [ ] Write a {pkgdown} site to serve as a package user's guide


I am inconsistently getting the following error when running this code. It is perplexing since it works for some years but not others and sometimes works fine for a couple states and then does not work again. I have played with tigris_use_cache too. Any help is appreciated. 

tracts2000 <- tracts(state.id[[i]], county = NULL, cb = TRUE, year = 2000, refresh = TRUE)
tracts1990 <- tracts(state.id[[i]], county = NULL, cb = TRUE, year = 1990, refresh = TRUE)
tracts2010 <- tracts(state.id[[i]], county = NULL, cb = TRUE, year = 2010, refresh = TRUE)

> any thoughts on getting proxy server to work in tracts()? my usual httr::use_proxy(XX.XX.XX:XX) is failing... Httr::use_proxy(xxxxx:xx) usually works as an addition option (other r api pulls) also tried setting global options to force proxy all the time. No go

Investigate this during summer dev time.
