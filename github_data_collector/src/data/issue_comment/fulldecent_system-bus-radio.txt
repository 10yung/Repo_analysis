Hi guys, I got a question for you (please take it seriously, rly, I know it sounds crasy but give me a chance please)
Is there a way this system transmits to 1420mhz ? I know it's a lot but I'm trying to make it work for space purposes like sending messages and stuff right from my computer without the need of anthenas (trying to make a minimmalist instrument over here, just my computer, some mics and I) please let me know if it's possible to at least send signals to devices that are 10 meters or further , I will try to make it work and let you all know if it does.
- Andy.
This sounds insane, but I wonder if certain radio frequencies have a measurable effect on the system. If one can send RF maybe one can receive, too. If this is true, it would make device localization, side channel information transfer and more scary stuff possible.

Given audio input, probably even without an antenna, it might be possible to decode radio signals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2W1x6Rb9hI

But I'm wondering if the same can be done without any I/O permissions.
Hi Pro,

Do you know how to catch analog signals using wifi card on macOS?

What I want to do is to catch the raw analog signals from the wifi card or something like that and write the data down, might be in the form of binary 1s and 0s.

As I know that wifi router will emit/receive EM waves and wifi card on laptop also receive/emit that EM waves. So just want to know how the analog data is.

Thanks.


There is this part: "AM tuner at 1560 Hz". The k for Kilo is missing. It should be: "AM tuner at 1560 **kHz**".

Right?
Not really an issue, but I'll hope you'll indulge this misapplication for a quick discussion.

Anyone else have the MacBook Air with the i7?

I hear something, but it sounds pretty bad. I am using a Grundig G3 radio. 

Would the processor make any difference? I tried some different frequencies. 

They all sound bad and I wonder if the i7 actually puts out more noise and garbage and crap. Makes me wonder how the hell this passed FCC at all.
I have downloaded the files and I followed the steps on the GitHub page, but how do I play/run the .tune files in my terminal? 
ps: I am working with a macbook pro 13" 2016﻿
We should have a common format for describing tunes (series of beeps) across the different implementations in this repository. Extensive searching was done, a simple widespread standard was not found.

Following is proposed:
1. Simple text file
2. Each line represents a beep or a pause
   1. Column one is a positive integer number of milliseconds
   2. Column two is a positive integer frequency in Hz, or `0` which represents silence
   3. Columns are separated by a space
3. Line ending is unix format
4. File extension is `.tune`
5. Although not necessarily part of the tune, consider adding a silence at the end so that looped playback sounds good :-)

Example for `mary_had_a_little_lamb.tune`:

```
400 2673
400 2349
400 2093
400 2349
400 2673
400 2673
790 2673

400 2349
400 2673
400 2349
790 2093
400 0    
```

Work plan:
- [x] Convert existing tunes into this format, save to `tunes/` folder
- [ ] Update each implementation to accept a `.tune` file on the command line / stdin or however else
  - [x] Using _mm_stream_si128
  - [ ] Using counter and threads
  - [x] In Javascript
- [x] Update run instructions so users know to supply the song file
