Hello!

This plugin is really useful, thank you :)

I have been wondering about writing some kind of program which can look at a vim plugin and tell you the minimum versions of vim and neovim required.  A bit like `helpful#buffer_version()`, as far as I can tell.

Do you have a feel for whether this might be fairly achievable?  I don't want to get sucked into a bit time commitment if possible, so I thought I would ask the expert first :)
I don't know if there is ever any reason to load it for other filetypes? It seems to me that it's useful only for these filetypes?
