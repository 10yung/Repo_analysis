Not tested 100%, but is enough for me to use the tool today. Sharing in case others find it useful.

Can this code be applied to the text data?
Hi,
Can we use it with PyTorch. I see that it supports Caffe models.
More a feature request than an issue. I'd like to keep up with the times and move to caffe2,  can you support? 
Q1. I already spent three days, at two occasions it worked with zero values on the visualization screen. 
Please share the accurate setup for OS version, GPU Gtx 1080 ti, CUDA, CUDNN. Thanks alot.


Q2. I trained my model in theano and I want to transfer my model from theano to caffe.
In the improved version, i can see  the all backword visualization, Activation Histograms, Activation Correlation,... But i can't display the 9 maximal activations, the maximal optimized/input , i need your help.

Thanks for your great work!
I want to finish the visualization target on my 3D data. Can you show me more details about applying this code to the 3D data condition?
Thanks again!

I saw a visual image of this optimization algorithm on the CS231n course page. But I'm not sure how to draw it. I'd like to refer to your source code. Thank you very much.[http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#sgd](url)
When I run this ./run_toolbox.py, the following error is appeared:

Error importing settings.py. Check the error message below for more information.
If you haven't already, you'll want to copy one of the settings_local.template-*.py files
to settings_local.py and edit it to point to your caffe checkout. E.g. via:
  $ cp models/caffenet-yos/settings_local.template-caffenet-yos.py settings_local.py
  $ < edit settings_local.py >
