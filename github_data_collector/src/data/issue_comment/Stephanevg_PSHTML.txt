### Out-PSHTMLDocument does not work with path .\ in Module Context
If I use out-pshtmldocument in a consolesession context I can add a path parameter like the following ".\index.html". This works. The file gets written and I can use "-Show" in order for PSHTML to open the document for me. 

If I have that path parameter in a module context it throws an error that it could not find the path.



A pshtml document is nothing else a .ps1 file (a powershell file).

If this is possible, then the following would be interesting as well:
. Support for CSS intelise in a pshtml document
- support for Jquery / Javascript intelise in a pshtml document
### Subject of the issue
I am trying to include input -type 'checkbox', it displays in output but not able to check using mouse click. Using tab key and spacebar I can check

### Steps to reproduce
```
                            div -Class "custom-control custom-checkbox" {
                            input -name "checkbox" -id "checkbox_1" -type "checkbox" -Class "custom- control-input" -value "so"
                            label -Class "custom-control-label" "StoreOnce"

```
### Expected behaviour
Should be able to check with mouse click

### Actual behaviour
Not able to click using mouse, checks with keyboard.

Out-PSHTMLDocument mus receive a $Document of type PSHTMLDocument.

On that document is must call the method `.GenerateHTML()` (Name of the method still to be discussed).

When the document is empty, it should not throw an error
