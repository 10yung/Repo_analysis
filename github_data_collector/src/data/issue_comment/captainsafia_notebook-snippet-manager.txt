Thanks for your useful tools; I think there are also some useful function could be add in the tools as my issue head 
Is there any way to use this inside of the new Jupyter Lab?

Thank you for the very useful extension.
I tried to delete snippets but it didn't work.
I'm not sure if it's because I installed Jupyter using sudo.
Could you look into this problem?
Thanks.


I followed the instructions (rather new to jupyter)

got

~: jupyter nbextension enable notebook-snippet-manager
Enabling notebook extension notebook-snippet-manager...
      - Validating: problems found:
        - require?  X notebook-snippet-manager

Restarted server, no new buttons appeared. Jupyter v4.2.1

~: ls .jupyter/nbextensions/
list.js                     notebook-snippet-manager.js
