Demo doesn't build with SAMKeychain

Just wondering if any plan on updating this framework align with Face ID?
Keyboard disappear if system show a  alert view with textfield which can show the keyboard.After the system's alertView disappear the keyboard will disappear.
Is there a way to solve this situation?
Thank  you very much!
Using iOS 10.2

1. Enable TouchID
2. Attempt to unlock with wrong finger
3. Choose "Enter Passcode"
4. Passcode screen appears without the keyboard.

Looking at the debug view hierarchy, it's just not there. 

It seems to be a timing issue. If I insert a wait (a lame workaround, I know) in `requestTouchIDWithCompletion` in `LAErrorUserFallback`, it appears.

`response = VENTouchLockTouchIDResponseUsePasscode;`
` [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval: 0.001];`

Not a great solution, but might help in tracking down a real one.

An equivalent Swift sample project. 
Now the library accepts one optional value: secondsToLock. This value will be used with lastRefreshDate to lock the app with lockIfNeeded. In order to refresh the lastRefreshDateValue the user has to call to updateRefreshDate method whenever he needs. The changes has been made so the previous functionality is not affected. 

If you disable TouchID option and use Passcode-only option, the keyboard will not appear if you close/dismiss it once.  
Functionally, it should reappear once you tap any of the boxes of Passcode to enter it, but it doesn't
