your PnL calculation for the exit scenario is wrong
```python
        elif abs(zscore[i]) < 0.5:
            money += countS1*S1[i] - S2[i] * countS2
            count = 0
```

not sure what you are resetting `count` for since it was never used in the code.  and why is countS2 making a negative impact to PnL? if you fix these two issues, the strategy is not profitable at all. 
In cell 124 can you make the print statement python 3 compatible (the rest of the print statements are)? Also, in cell 122 'Adj Close' should be 'adjClose'. 
On the notebook "Integration, Cointegration..." The chart just above the title "Testing for cointegration" is wrong on the github preview. I think it just needs reuploading.

This is mine:

In [50] block, we have obtained:
```
aic: 14263.11094 | order: (4, 1, 3)
```

But why do we end up with the conclusion that the best fit is ARIMA(2,1, 1) then? Shouldn't it be ARIMA(4, 1, 3)?
