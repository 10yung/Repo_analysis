The current Graph Engine VS Templates don't support current workflows and they generate the flawed csproj file content. Here is a list of things that don't work or inefficient:

"Graph Engine Application Project (.Net Core)
1. Support for .NET is limited to ".netcoreapp2.0"; we are now @ netcoreapp3.1
   * Only .NET Framework versions are presented in the "Configure your new proejct dialog"
exhibit A:

exhibit C: (Note: you can't select .NET Core versions)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5692812/71385867-ccd82800-259e-11ea-9978-e5260b892bcc.png)

exhibit B: (The PackageReference Include statement is flawed at the "Version" parameter)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5692812/71385700-dca33c80-259d-11ea-9b98-fb7f92192219.png)

2. Does not generate a proper .NET Core Project file and Package References is not generated
   *  AssemblyInfo.cs file is generated



 
Visual Studio 2017
My code
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            TrinityConfig.CurrentRunningMode = RunningMode.Embedded;

        }

Error occurred：Internal error T3014 


Maybe I did something wrong. What should I do

The wrong async method is being called! Very frustrating to encounter this type of bug at this stage in development. I have a medium-size complex WPF/MVVM project using Trinity/GraphEngine; I have integrated GraphEngine using a modular MVVM design pattern using PRISM and Castle Windsor DI. I have created a number of .NET472 assemblies that embody data segments using the Separation of  Concerns design idiom.

I have created CommunicationShell, a wrapper around the Trinity APIs that set up the communications stack; the CommunicationShell is injected into each ViewModel - this is done so as to avoid duplicate code and to only have a single established environment for the entire application and all ViewModel instances.

In this code segment the Trinity client-side environment is established:

You can see that I'm using the module Trinity dynamic server composition API to register each communication module; I am also getting each module implementation setting up reactive observables against each module. 

Here is the error:

In this existing codebase the RPC method "**_PushContactDataModelAsync_**" is never called but as you can see here it has been called by the Trinity runtime!

Here is the only actual RPC method called in the app at this time:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5692812/69197241-ba715700-0ae5-11ea-9120-105d20cb6817.png)

As you can see I make the call to "QueryUserAuthInfoAsync" - this is a bug. 

I have a lot of material regarding this bug and I am willing to connect via LiveShare in VS 2019 so that it can be observed directly. Please let me know what other data and or information you need to move forward in investigating the problem.
                foreach (var userAuthenticationSessionDataNode in Global.LocalStorage.UserAuthenticationCache_Selector())
                {
                    var userAuthInfoSetCellId = userAuthenticationSessionDataNode.CellId;
                    var userAuthInfoSet = userAuthenticationSessionDataNode.UserAuthInfoSet;
                }

This is bad! I was only expecting a single cell here but the code stalls in the debugger and then I get the follwing error:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5692812/68825357-b01b0d00-064e-11ea-9c57-bd882db5b386.png)

here is the preceeding code:

UserAuthenticationSessionData userAuthenticationSessionData = new UserAuthenticationSessionData()
                                                                          {
                AdalAuthority = authResult.Authority,
                AuthExpireDateTimeStamp = authResult.ExpiresOn.DateTime,
                ClientAppId = config.clientId,
                GraphServiceClientEndpoint = config.graphEndpoint,
                QuasarUserRegistrationId = Guid.NewGuid(),
                RedirectUrl = config.redirectUri,
                SaveUserPassword = true,
                UsersFamilyName = authResult.UserInfo.FamilyName,
                UsersPassword = UsersPassword.Value,
                UsersGivenName = authResult.UserInfo.GivenName
            };

            UserAuthenticationCache userAuthenticationCache = new UserAuthenticationCache()
                                                              {
                                                                  CellId = Trinity.Core.Lib.CellIdFactory.NewCellId(),
                                                                  AddtionalUserConfigData = null,
                                                                  UserAuthInfoSet =  userAuthenticationSessionData
                                                              };

            Global.LocalStorage.SaveUserAuthenticationCache(Trinity.TSL.Lib.CellAccessOptions.StrongLogAhead, userAuthenticationCache);

            Global.LocalStorage.SaveStorage();

            if (Global.LocalStorage.IsUserAuthenticationCache(userAuthenticationCache.CellId))
            {
                foreach (var useAuthContext in Global.LocalStorage.UserAuthenticationCache_Accessor_Selector())
                {
                    var userName = useAuthContext.UserAuthInfoSet.UsersGivenName;
                }
            }
Server responses with rsp code=100
[ INFO    ] LocalMemoryStorage is initialized in read-write mode
[ INFO    ] Initializing logging facility
[ FATAL   ] Cannot open write ahead log for read. Exiting.

This looks like a concurrency problem but it only happens in I run more than one instance of a client. I can run one instance of my WPF client and instance of the Console App both connected to the same server and no write ahead log error is generated. My guess is that there is some type of setting I must be missing. Can anyone point me in the direction look for answers.

I need to store 600G of data, but only 32G of computer memory, the program will prompt memory overflow, how to solve, what solutions?
