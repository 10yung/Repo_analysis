#### What were you doing?

After a SD card crash I finally got round to upgrading to the lates release but noticed that my Logitech Pro 9000 didn't work.

#### What did you expect to happen?

Of course I expected the webcam stream to show

#### What happened instead?

but it only ever keeps displaying this

for hours on end

#### Did the same happen when running OctoPrint in safe mode?

Yes, just the same.

I have read the FAQ.

However, I found that doing this resolves the issue till next reboot 
```
sudo systemctl restart webcamd
```
After boot `systemctl status webcamd` reports this
```

After that the stream works even after a restarting OctoPrint - however when rebooting the RPi the problem reoccures.

Could a delayed start of `webcamd` be a possible solution?

#### What were you doing?
I just recently had to reflash my pi and now I'm having *several* issues.
1. My printer now is constantly pausing, like not actually pausing the print, but the printer freezes in place for a split second, then it moves, then repeats. When I print from the printer's sd card, it never do this
2. The image *did not* come with pip, so I am unable to install plugins.
3. I can no longer flash with the plugin FirmwareUpdater because the Raspbian image that 0.17.0 changes up how the pi reads USBs, see [here](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-FirmwareUpdater/issues/112)

I was trying to use this camera: a4tech-pk333e

It works after setting the usb id(0ac8:3450) to the additional_brokenfps_usb_devices and the config file said I should report it here. The image quality is terrible, but that's to be expected from many years old low end camera. For monitoring the print it's fine. 
Seems like it is not possible to set the Pull Up on the GPIO

root@octopi:/home/pi# gpio -g mode 14 up
root@octopi:/home/pi# gpio -g read 14 
0 
root@octopi:/home/pi#
There's nothing connected to BCM Pin 14, so the result should be 1

#### What happened instead?
The Pi didn't detect the new USB device.

I have tried every ports and different USB cable. When connected to my Windows 10 machine I see the printer listed with the right device name which confirms that both the cable and the printer USB interface works.

When connecting a USB keyboard to the Pi, the device is listed with ``dmesg`` which tells me that the Pi port works.

Platform: Raspberry PI 4 with PI NOIR running latest 0.17.0 RC1 image

What is the problem? - minor BUG- camera LED does not light when in use on PI 4. I have observed this on both the the last two image build (the only ones I have run).

What did you already try to solve it? Testing on PI B+ builds the LED lights normally  

Logs: Not applicable

 Additional Info: I use OctoPi to control my 3D printer. A Pi Noir attached to the bed is used to monitor the print job. I have been using a Raspberry PI 3B+ for this purpose but I just switched to a Raspberry PI 4. I notice that after boot on the 3B+ the LED light on the camera comes on. This is handy. I know that I am booted and ready to go. On the PI 4 the LED never comes on. Does the PI 4 handle the camera LED differently than the 3B+ ? In other words, should the LED behave the same way whichever board is used? To be sure, this is a minor problem, but the LED is a useful status indicator that shows the PI is up and running.




#### What were you doing?
I was attempting to boot my Raspberry Pi 3B computer like I do every morning. It's important to note that this is a problem that's related to both rebooting (long delays at the end) as well as a freeze during the first boot of the day (which is significant).

Three+ minutes on this line as it's shutting down (prior to rebooting):
```
"restore / save the current clock..."
```
Stuck on this line during the first boot of the day (but it's probably the next line that's freezing since this one indicated OK):
```
 [ OK ] Started dphys-swapfile - set up, mount/unmount, and delete a swap file.
```

I note that this occurs more often when I've connected an Ethernet cable as well. [This may be significant.](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/49388/97094)

#### What did you expect to happen?
I expected a standard boot to service and I expected that there wouldn't be any unnecessarily-long delays in a reboot.

#### What happened instead?
First boot of the morning seems to require at least one reboot all this week, for example.

#### Did the same happen when running OctoPrint in safe mode?
N/A

#### Version of OctoPi
0.15.1

#### Printer model & used firmware incl. version
Smoothieboard 5xC 1.1, Marlin (but it's not pertinent here)

#### Screenshot(s)/video(s) showing the problem:

I have read the FAQ.

## Troubleshooting
I've literally spent hours chasing this down. It seems like the `fake-hwclock` in Raspbian tries to check-and-save the current time at shutdown. This appears to be the reason for the 3.5-minute delay sometimes.

I ran `date` and note that the time is sometimes as much as 60 seconds off from the time on my MacBook. I ran `sudo timedatectl set-ntp True` thinking that it might be turned off but I don't think that this has changed anything.

The default file seen here is part of the OctoPi image:

`cat /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf`
```
[Time]
#NTP=
#FallbackNTP=0.debian.pool.ntp.org 1.debian.pool.ntp.org 2.debian.pool.ntp.org 3.debian.pool.ntp.org
#RootDistanceMaxSec=5
#PollIntervalMinSec=32
#PollIntervalMaxSec=2048
```

Does this mean that it's not configured? I did a manual `timedatectl --adjust-system-clock` and the clock appears to be closer to reality. And now, I've just run `date` again and it's slow by 13 minutes. grrr (I'm currently on wi-fi only, for what it's worth.)

I've just now added:

```
/sbin/iptables -t mangle -I POSTROUTING 1 -o wlan0 -p udp --dport 123 -j TOS --set-tos 0x00
```

...before the final line of `/etc/rc.local` and rebooted. It's still about 40 seconds slow right now after the reboot so I don't think that was the problem.

#### What were you doing?

Connected Ziggi HD webcam (UVC) it works but when i attempt to control auto-focus via ucvdynctrl 

#### What did you expect to happen?
Should have been able to adjust the focus of the webcam
#### What happened instead?
it ends up in a loop because v4l2 is "buggy" (actual term used in the error)
#### Did the same happen when running OctoPrint in safe mode?
was in SSH to terminal

#### Version of OctoPi

OctoPi 0.16.0

Original issue created here https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/3266, it was closed because it's a Octopi issue, not Octoprint.

Already tested this on a new instalation with no plugins installed.
And NTP is working :
```
pi@octopi-ender3:~ $ timedatectl status
      Local time: Sun 2019-09-08 19:39:31 WEST
  Universal time: Sun 2019-09-08 18:39:31 UTC
        RTC time: n/a
       Time zone: Europe/Lisbon (WEST, +0100)
 Network time on: yes
NTP synchronized: yes
 RTC in local TZ: no
```

1. Cut power off from raspberry pi ( without using the Shutdown system from UI )
2. wait something like 5 or 10min
3. Boot up raspberry pi
4. Check octoprint.log, the timestamp will be equal or INFERIOR at timestamp before shutdown

[octoprint.log](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/files/3589529/octoprint.log)
[serial.log](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/files/3589532/serial.log)

<!--

#### What did you expect to happen?

I wold expect octoprint to wait for NTP sync but I already understod it may not be possible. I already understood too because raspberry pi has not hardware clock with battery is not possible to maintain the clock updated at start up, only after online sync with NTP server. But I wold expect to at least the time stamp wont be inferior to the one at shutdown.
For example at `2019-09-08 19:08:50,449` octoprint startup with a timestamp smaller than before shutdown.

#### What happened instead?

Some times the boot up timestamp is inferior to shutdown timestamp.

#### Did the same happen when running OctoPrint in safe mode?

Yes

I have read the FAQ.

#### What were you doing?
Like many of us, I'm trying to work with Python 3 to make sure that my plugins will weather the test of time.

So I setup a standard OctoPi-imaged rig, then basically:

1. `mv ~/oprint ~/oprint.py2`
2. `virtualenv -p python3 oprint`
3. `source oprint/bin/activate`
4. `pip install --upgrade pip`
5. `pip install https://get.octoprint.org/latest`
`ERROR: Package 'OctoPrint' requires a different Python: 3.7.3 not in '>=2.7.9,<3'`

Interesting fact: For whatever reasons, I've gone through this routine perhaps five times already, testing different scenarios and saving each to their own microSD.

#### Request
What might be nice is a turnkey OctoPi image which pulls the latest Buster Lite as well as the latest OctoPrint 1.4rc_something_ from the `devel` branch. In theory, it would still have the classic `~/oprint` as the virtual environment location, just with Python 3.7.3 instead of Py2 throughout. Kudos if it's Pi4-friendly.

So basically—and with some instructions for how to pull this—one would:

1. Use Etcher to pull from some URL this IMG
2. Do the standard `/boot/octopi-wpa-supplicant.txt` thing
3. Boot it up

Remoting in would reveal a vanilla OctoPrint installation, just now Python 3—savvy.

I would suggest that this would benefit people in the plugin development space in the interim period before OP 1.4 is released.

#### What did you expect to happen?
I'd forgotten that we don't get Python 3 support until 1.4 which isn't released to `master` yet. But I suppose I naively expected this to work.

#### What happened instead?
The scenario requires the would-be tester to be able to install some as-yet-released OctoPrint version on the `devel` branch.

#### Did the same happen when running OctoPrint in safe mode?
N/A

#### Version of OctoPi
Presumably it would have been 1.3.11 at that point for OctoPrint and this would have been the daily build which includes Buster. 

#### Printer model & used firmware incl. version
