Hi there! I've updated Presentation to be compatible with Xcode 10 and Swift 4.2 and bumped the pod version up. Please let me know if any question, and would love to get this merged asap!

Thanks,
Alex
Cannot inherit from class 'PagesController' (compiled with Swift 4.1.50) because it has overridable members that could not be loaded in Swift 4.2.1
This was a quick and dirty way to support Swift 4.2 and Xcode 10. I removed a dependency and just hard-coded the necessary files within here.
