It would be good to have the ability to also show a bottom "cab".

I have the use case that I select list items, show secondary actions in the cab but also want to have a bottom view where the user can directly do primary actions.

**Problem**:
 Using String in public API for title and subtitle makes impossible to use SpannableSting

**Solution**:
 Use CharSequence

String implements CharSequence so there is no breaking change in public APIs.


I took a glance and there don't seem to be any code in the library that requires api level 19, can we set the min sdk to 15 in library?, if there is any would you welcome a PR that makes it api 15 compatible or would you be willing to fix it?

Thanks
