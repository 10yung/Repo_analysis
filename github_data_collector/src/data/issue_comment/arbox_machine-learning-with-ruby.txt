My team is writing a recommender system using collaborative filtering, and data scientists at our institution have suggest this is the algorithm we need to use. Is there one that could be included here? And if not, would you be interested in listing ours if we find we must invent our own? Thanks!
Dear ML in Ruby Gist contributors,

especially @mohawkjohn, @stympy, @irfansharif, @gbuesing, @jjgh, @v0dro, @giuse,

I'm the curator of the [RubyNLP](https://github.com/arbox/nlp-with-ruby) list and I'm glad to welcome you all to the new community effort to collect and curate ML related resources in Ruby.

After the initial talk to @gbuesing I've decided to make the next step and convert the [gist](https://gist.github.com/gbuesing/865b814d312f46775cda) to an [Awesome List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).

Why it could be useful? In my opinion (please correct me) we all need a central place for information about special applications (like ML, NLP, DataScience) where Ruby can compete with e.g. Python.

@sciruby makes great work on developing tools but there're plenty of other resources which should be collected, described, tested and represented among Rubyists and Developers using other technologies.

I can take the role of the list curator but I definitely lack all you expertise and don't have the wide horizon to find and review all the possible projects :)

So if you find this project useful please contribute, spread the word and use it :)

My plan is to support the lists for:
[NLP](https://github.com/arbox/nlp-with-ruby),
[ML](https://github.com/arbox/machine-learning-with-ruby),
[Data Science](https://github.com/arbox/data-science-with-ruby),
[Ruby Interoperability](https://github.com/arbox/ruby-interoperability).

These lists are not programming projects which propel Ruby over night. They are not a new killer app like Rails. But they are still very useful as documentation and a stable basis for a steady and long term development.

Thank your for your participation! Any ideas?
