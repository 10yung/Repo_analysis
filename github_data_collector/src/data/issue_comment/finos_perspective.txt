This PR moves all code related to PerspectiveWorkspace from `@finos/perspective-phosphor` to a new `@finos/perspective-workspace` package and exposes a new `perspective-workspace` customElement.
This PR adds and edits several pieces of useful documentation, as well as styling improvements to Perspective's [website](https://perspective.finos.org).

- Adds a "Conceptual Overview", which is a language-agnostic look at Perspective's core concepts, explaining how `Table`, `View`, and various `View` options work. This guide helps to fill in the gaps in our API documentation/user guide about Perspective's concepts, and moves them to one centralized location.
- Restructure the installation guide, JS user guide, and Python user guide, adding content where necessary.
- Restyle the Perspective website with new fonts and code highlighting
- Regenerate READMEs for `perspective`, `perspective-viewer` and `perspective-python`

## Support Question

I'm trying to use perspective (and perspective-viewer) with Angular 8, but I'm getting import errors. The errors are below.

Is there some guidance for usage with Angular?
A part of the errors comes from requiring @apache-arrow/es5-esm`, but I saw in the PR for #850 that this is no longer a requirement (in master). I don't have WSL installed, so I wanted to ask if rebuilding from master is the only option, before I go down the WSL path.

When we convert datetimes to Unix timestamps, at non-deterministic times overflows may happen - the attached screenshot caused an overflow error at ~9:57:30-9:58:15PM, but did not error again when run at ~9:58:30PM.

Hey team,

Currently we only have sum(abs(x)) and sum(x) available, where x is an array of floats.
As a user, I would like to have abs(sum(x)) available as an aggregator.

i.e. x = [5,-10, 2]

sum(abs(x)) = 17   <- feature already exists
sum(x) = -3            <-  feature already exists
abs(sum(x)) = 3     <- feature requested.

Thanks,
Jeff
## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Apply (n>1) sorts and (n>0) row pivots
2. Select hypergrid
3. Scroll to the right (at least a few columns off screen)
4. Scroll down

### Expected Result:
The viewport to scroll

### Actual Result:
Error city

similar to how aggregate and filter operands function now.

### Description of Problem:
I would like to type a column name to filter on or group by without dragging it from the Columns left side panel for quickly setting up viewer data filtering, sorting & grouping config/settings.

Should be not capture scroll when theres a lot of whitespace? Alternatively, is there a CSS rule that can let the grid expand to the width of the component?
