I emailed help@intelligencecareers.gov for more specific contact information Nov. 19th but have heard nothing back yet...

I have connectivity between sources and collector, and have had events come in for test subscriptions.  My question/concern is how to most simply organize individual subscriptions, given the fact that event IDs are only unique to sources, and not logs.  For example, is it the case that the particular event IDs recommended to be tracked in the Excel spreadsheet "are" unique for each log, or would I have to separate each subscription by event source to be sure I was not getting different events (one I care about, and others I don't want to forward) from the same log that happened to have the same event ID?
Addresses issue #14.
I apologize if this is not the proper avenue, but it was the only one I could recognize.  Is it listed anywhere what the baseline audit/advanced audit policy settings/GPOs that need to be in place in order for all these event IDs to exist in the first place (ex. Microsoft Recommended baseline, or secure audit policy settings, or perhaps audit policy settings specific to this repo.  -Cliff, CISSP 
At least on Windows Server 2016, the name of the ETW Provider is `Microsoft-Windows-CertificateServicesClient-Lifecycle-System` with GUID `BC0669E1-A10D-4A78-834E-1CA3C806C93B`.

In https://github.com/nsacyber/Event-Forwarding-Guidance/tree/master/Events it is `Microsoft-Windows-CertificateServicesClientLifecycle-System` for the EventSource
Event with ID = 7045 from System log has incorrect source in section "Software and Service Installation" of "Recommended Events to Collect" document. 
Correct source for this event is "Service Control Manager":
 - Provider 
   [ Name]  Service Control Manager 
   [ Guid]  {555908d1-a6d7-4695-8e1e-26931d2012f4} 
   [ EventSourceName]  Service Control Manager 
 - EventID 7045 
 Also, I create pull request #12 to modify "RecommendedEvents.json" file

Change EventSource for Event wit ID=7045 (A service was installed in the system) to correct value.
This PR may be more substantial than desired and so you choose to decline this, but that's fine, I'm only submitting these PRs in case they're of interest upstream. The commit history should be fairly clear, but in short, there's **zero** functional changes. Instead, the sample WEC subscriptions have had their formatting substantially overhauled to be IMO far more readable and maintainable. There's particular emphasis on the embedded `XPath` queries which now have consistent formatting with splitting over multiple lines and appropriate indentation. This makes parsing and editing them far easier, not to mention spotting errors which may not necessarily be syntactic (as in PR https://github.com/iadgov/Event-Forwarding-Guidance/pull/2).

In addition, I've renamed the subscription files to have more accurate & verbose file names (I don't see why they need to be short) and removed all the `samples/*` subscriptions. I'm unclear what their purpose is and a diff between them and the `NT6/*` subscriptions shows only very minor changes. The `NT6/*` samples appear to be newer, and the changes don't suggest they're for supporting downlevel OSs, so in the absence of a compelling reason to keep them they've been removed.

Comments welcome.
