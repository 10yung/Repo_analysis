Am I supposed to write gupfile or webpack config or something?
Please add Setup in the README.

`npm install rgbaster` did nothing.

Hi,

Functionally, what is the difference between the following two?

### TS code [from v2](https://github.com/briangonzalez/rgbaster.js/blob/8eca19975bc74b29e2d6f4755a3343c4f6ef87f3/src/helpers.ts#L15)
```
  if (src.startsWith('data')) img.crossOrigin = 'Anonymous'
```
and 

### JS code [from v1](https://github.com/briangonzalez/rgbaster.js/blob/426f853605c1fb0740fd06931950742db4318fb3/rgbaster.js#L20-L21)
```
    if ( imgSrc.substring(0,5) !== 'data:' )
      imgObj.crossOrigin = "Anonymous";
```

Unless I'm mistaken - which to be honest is quite possible after a long day's work - Version 2 of RGBaster has inverted the test for CORS handling of data url's.

I think formatting code using [prettier.js](https://prettier.io/) would be a good addition to the build system, with less choices (opinionated formater), ensuring everyone's contribution looks the same (upon commit using commit hooks).
what do you think @briangonzalez  @AlfredJKwack ?
I am trying to use analyze function at version 2 to get dominant color of an image, but the call blocks 
my UI and make a long-time no response in browser. My code is below and runtime is Angular 7.
```js
import analyze from 'rgbaster';

// lifecycle callback
async ngAfterViewInit() {
    const result = await analyze('../../assets/images/1542072554094.jpg');
    console.log(result);
 }
```
I am also trying to install rgbaster.js and import analyze from 'rgbaster.js', but it don't works. I learned that the version 2 of rgbaster was written in typescript, so i think there is no any problem to using this library in Angular framework. But I hava no idea about that the analyze function doesn't work and block ui Thread and raise a crash to browser.  

Thanks for your any replies!
