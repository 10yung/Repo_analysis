Dear 

I am trying to use Threading with UE4 and Python, but whenever I start the thread UE4 crashes. Could you please help me in this matter?
My code is as follows:


     def capture_scene(self):
         tic = time.perf_counter()
         self.pawn.call_function('capturescene')

         toc = time.perf_counter()
         ue.log(toc-tic)

    def tick(self, delta_time):
        # get current location

        self.t += delta_time
        if self.t >= 1:
            self.t1 = Thread(target = self.capture_scene)
            self.t1.start()
            ue.log('exccc')
            self.t = 0
I am using UE4 4.19 Mac
Can you publish binaries for windows ue4.23 with embedded python 3.7 (preferred) or 3.7?

Thanks in advance:)
HI

Do you have USceneCapture implemented in Python?

Thanks
For programmer, it is easy to use the collision channel (ECollisionChannel ) instead of object types (EObjectTypeQuery). Collision channel can be user defined and more understandable. I know there's converting method in C++ engine code. I'm confused if there's python interface for programmers to use.
I found that this command didn't work in version 4.22 , Is there any improvement plan ï¼Ÿ
I was wondering if anyone has gotten pycharm or VSCode remote debug to work with UE4?  If so, can you share?  If not, is there anything else that works for debugging besides print statements?  Thank you.
Most changes are simple. I also changed methods that have deprecation warnings. Disabled the following functions

py_ue_fmenu_builder_add_asset_actions
The menu build system has been refactored.  Needs more work to figure out how to port this correctly.

py_unreal_engine_reload_blueprint
Reload functionality has been removed from the engine.

A few things need to be updated to work with UE v4.24.  I have done an initial pass, and will link that pr to this issue.
How can call third-party exe when executing a UnrealEnginePython script in the unreal editor
I have a Blueprint character that inherits from c++. Nothing fancy in the c++ side just a base class

In the character bp i have a Python actor component attached .
Here is the python module

```
import unreal_engine as ue


class Player:
    
    def begin_play(self):
        # get a reference to the owing pawn (a character)
        self.owner = self.uobject.get_owner()

        # the following two values were originally implemented as blueprint variable
        self.base_turn_rate = 70.0
        self.base_look_up_rate = 70.0 
        self.owner.bind_axis('Turn', self.turn)
        self.owner.bind_axis('LookUp', self.look_up)

        self.owner.bind_axis('MoveForward', self.move_forward)
        self.owner.bind_axis('MoveRight', self.move_right)

        # bind jump actions
        self.owner.bind_action('Jump', ue.IE_PRESSED, self.owner.jump)
        self.owner.bind_action('Jump', ue.IE_RELEASED, self.owner.stop_jumping)

        # bind sprint actions
        self.owner.bind_action('Sprint', ue.IE_PRESSED, self.sprint_pressed)
        self.owner.bind_action('Sprint', ue.IE_RELEASED, self.sprint_released)     

    def tick(self, delta_time):
        pass

    def turn(self, axis_value):
        turn_rate = axis_value * self.base_turn_rate * self.owner.get_world_delta_seconds()
        self.owner.add_controller_yaw_input(turn_rate)

    def look_up(self, axis_value):
        look_up_rate = axis_value * self.base_look_up_rate * self.owner.get_world_delta_seconds()
        self.owner.add_controller_pitch_input(look_up_rate)

    def move_forward(self, axis_value):
        rot = self.owner.get_control_rotation()
        fwd = ue.get_forward_vector(0, 0, rot[2])
        self.owner.add_movement_input(fwd, axis_value)

    def move_right(self, axis_value):
        rot = self.owner.get_control_rotation()
        right = ue.get_right_vector(0, 0, rot[2])
        self.owner.add_movement_input(right, axis_value)

    def sprint_pressed(self):
        self.owner.CharacterMovement.MaxWalkSpeed = 2000.0

    def sprint_released(self):
        self.owner.CharacterMovement.MaxWalkSpeed = 600.0

```

I have `shift` key assigned as Sprint binding
and when i press shift character  movement increases and returns to normal when not pressed.
It works fine in the packaged build but in standalone or PIE when i press shift the camera rotation seems to get faster each time i press shift.
