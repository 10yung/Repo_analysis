Because the default background of UIView is black, which makes the shadow invisible.

`let options = [
            .type(.up),
            .animationIn(0.3)
            ] as [PopoverOption]
        let popover = Popover(options: options, showHandler: nil, dismissHandler: nil)
        popover.show(passwordValidationView, fromView: sender as! UIButton)`


As you can see this custom view size keeps on increasing as it is open multiple times 

Is there a method or function to remove popOver programatically like after a timeout or without user clicking .. On certain action in the view(say select a row in a table view) .. The popover should remove. 
Pod install is still pointed to 1.2.0, needs to point to 1.2.1.
I'm getting this compiler error with 1.2.1 on the line:
fillLayer.fillRule = CAShapeLayerFillRule.evenOdd
Relate to issue: https://github.com/corin8823/Popover/issues/115

I've restarted xcode and my mac, but this issue cannot resolve. When I comment out that line, It's working well.
I use this library. TableView in popover doesn't scroll.
```   
let minPopoverHeight = CGFloat(264)

 lazy var popoverTableView: UITableView = {
        let tableView = UITableView()
        tableView.delegate = self
        tableView.dataSource = self
        tableView.tableFooterView = UIView()
        tableView.tag = SearchableTableViewTag.search.rawValue
        return tableView
    }()

    override func viewWillLayoutSubviews() {
        popoverTableView.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: tableContainer.bounds.origin.y, width: view.bounds.size.width, height: minPopoverHeight)
    }

func searchBarShouldBeginEditing(_ searchBar: UISearchBar) -> Bool {
        let popoverOptions = [
            .type(.down),
            .animationIn(0.3),
            .showBlackOverlay(false),
            .arrowSize(.zero),
            .color(.white),
            .dismissOnBlackOverlayTap(true),
        ] as [PopoverOption]
        
        searchPopover = Popover(options: popoverOptions, showHandler: nil, dismissHandler: {
            self.searchController.isActive = false
        })
        
        searchPopover?.show(popoverTableView, fromView: searchBar)
        return true
    }
```

That's way I use Popover. 
My Popover is using all screen so I'm trying set to use pre determinate size of Height

`popover?.frame.size.height = 300`

But this not works, when I print the value the original size keeping the same and the UIView baloon use all screen.
Hi there,
thanks for the great work, I like it very much

just wondering is there any way to change the size of the Popover after it was displayed with some animation.

I can change the view by doing this inside the view inside the popover

```
let newView = UIView()
guard let sv = self.superview else{  return  }
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5) {
   sv.addSubview(newView)
   self.removeFromSuperview()
}
```
which works fine but I would like to change the size of the popover accordingly from within the view inside the popover

any suggestions or corrections would be appreciated 
thanks again for the great work 
-Added a specific highlight bounds (highlighting will only occur in this rect)
-Also added the ability to have highlighting (on the fromView) and present the popover from a specific location at the same time.
