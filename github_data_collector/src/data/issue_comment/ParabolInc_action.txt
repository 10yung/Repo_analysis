- [ ] on dismiss, a settimeout is set for 3 minutes to re-open the toast

Hey @ackernaut you might want to fix a little spacing here or there, but i think this is safe enough to ship to prod. My only goal here is to not introduce any new patterns that will go away soon.

TEST - MOBILE

- [ ] - left nav shows "Upgrade" CTA on personal plan
- [ ] - left nav shows pro/enterprise when not on personal plan
- [ ] - left nav team name list looks good with 0, 5, and 20 teams
- [ ] TopBar has "Parabol" as the title for everything (see #3487)
- [ ]  clicking hamburger opens the menu (as does swiping from the left)

TEST - DESKTOP
- [ ] top bar hamburger collapses the left nav
- [ ] Search bar hidden for non-kanban routes
- [ ] search bar works for kanban + agenda list
- [ ] badges for notifications & meetings works
- [ ] clicking the meetings button opens a menu showing active meetings
- [ ] if no active meetings, has a link to create a new meeting & if clicked from a team dash, it sets that team as default

OTHER
- [ ] can upgrade to pro, after upgrading, the "Pro" badge shows up on the mobile left nav
- [ ] can downgrade from pro & the "Pro" badge no longer shows up
we have a document title, but that may not be the same thing as the page title that we show on mobile devices.

AC
- [ ] i think the cleanest way to do this is to have the `useDocumentTitle` hook accept a `pageName` 2nd arg.
- [ ] Mobile site has meaningful page names in the top bar

> Thanks for your reply! What I actually meant by this question was; for example each Monday at 1500pm we have a meeting. What I'd like to do is let Parabol send around a notification with the topics that are on the agenda every Monday morning at 900AM. So people can use the time to go through pre-reads and stuff like that and prepare well for the meeting in that way.
Is that something you facilitate? Thanks.

AC will be updated with additional thoughts and information from users.

### Acceptance Criteria (optional)
A lo-fi design where users can:
   - Promote a card to create a new agenda item
