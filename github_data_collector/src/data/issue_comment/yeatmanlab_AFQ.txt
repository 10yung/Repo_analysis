I am working with the AFQ_SegmentCallosum function and could not find any documentation or rationale for the ROIs used in this function. When mapping the ROI nifti files onto the MNI brain, they largely terminate in areas of cortex that make intuitive sense. However, different ROIs are used for superior frontal cortex and motor cortex, yet the ROI for the superior parietal cortex includes somatosensory cortex. Are the AFQ_SegmentCallosum ROIs based on fiber groups observed in previous studies? And additionally, is it reasonable to modify the ROI for superior parietal cortex to create a separate ROI for somatosensory cortex?

Thank you,

I am facing the similar NaN issue, mainly from the bilateral Hippocampal Cingulum tracts. The missing data were as high as 50% even in my control adult dataset. I have inspected them by overlaying the pair of ROIs and the cleaned FG on dtiFiberUI. It seems like those hippocampal cingulum fibers  can be tracked separately from ROI1 or ROI2, but not "long enough" to touch both ROI waypoints in the subjects with NaN. Therefore it returned out no fibers for these 2 tracts. Since the NaN are far more than those from right AF, I am wondering whether it's common. How can I dealt with it? Shall I completely get rid of the Hippocampal Cingulum tracts for everybody from the 20 fibers? 

Thanks.

Hi, is this repository still working on MATLAB 2018a? 
I keep getting an internal error at some stage and MATLAB is closed unexpectedly while I'm trying to run AFQ_example.m
I would be greatful for any help!

Thank you!
I am running AFQ_run with following options.

```
sub_dirs = { [config.patient '/dti'], [config.control '/dti'] };
sub_group = [1, 0];
afq = AFQ_Create('sub_dirs', sub_dirs, 'sub_group', sub_group);
[afq patient_data control_data norms abn abnTracts] = AFQ_run(sub_dirs, sub_group, afq);
```

When I run this, it crashes (toward the end of processing?) with following error message.

```

Hi AFQ team!
We have been analysing several AFQ processed datasets, and we have a suggestion for how the clip2rois parameter is working. 
Right now, for both the 'true' and 'false' options, the resulting tract profile is "normalized" to 100 divisions. The main issue we find with this is that the profiles (or averages) coming from two different clip2roi options cannot be compared, although both have the same number of divisions.

We think that it could be useful if the clip2roi=true option would have the 100 divisions, and the clip2roi=false option maybe 150 or 200 divisions. One way of getting rid completely of the parameter would be to assign 100 divisions between the ROIs always, and use 50 divisions from the ROIs to the GM in both ends. This way we always would have 200 divisions, and could easily select the middle 100 for the clip2roi segment of the tract profile (maybe another option for backward compatibility would be to maintain always the 100 divisions, but make sure that the middle 50-60 correspond to the clip2roi section of the tract profile).

What do you think? I can create a pull request if you think this change is worth implementing.
Thanks!

As suggested by @akeshavan at the AFQ-Browser meeting on 26 Mar 2018.
We are trying to run AFQ in deployed (compiled via mcc) mode, and having some issue inside AFQ_SegmentFiberGroups.m. It's running `which('mrDiffusion.m')` that doesn't seem to work in compiled mode.

We basically made following patch to AFQ to make it work.

```
diff --git a/functions/AFQ_SegmentFiberGroups.m b/functions/AFQ_SegmentFiberGroups.m
index 1968a82..ccb6023 100644

 % Initialize spm defualts for normalization

```

I am wondering, this piece of code can be updated to something like.

```
if isdeployed
    tdir = ...something that works in deployed mode..
else
    tdir = fullfile(fileparts(which('mrDiffusion.m')), 'templates');
end
```

Hello,

I am encountering some issues when running AFQ_run.

I preprocessed my data with FSL so I created the 'dt6.mat' file using the dtiMakeDt6FromFsl function. Then I tried running AFQ_run.

I have created this script to run AFQ_run for one subject:

sub_dirs = '/Users/Imaging/345/Pre_processed_DTI';
afq = AFQ_Create('run_mode', 'sub_dirs', sub_dirs);
[afq abn abnTracts] = AFQ_run(sub_dirs, afq)

Here are the results and the errors of this script:

Questions:
a) Is there anything wrong in the syntax of my script?
b) What are these errors I am getting and how can they be fixed?
c) What is each file in the "fibers" folder?
d) According to this example: http://yeatmanlab.github.io/AFQ/tutorials/AFQ_example#3, steps 3, 4, and 5 did not run for me. Is this correct? Also, I am not getting this message "mesh can be rotated with arrow keys", does this mean that something is not right?

Thank you!

Best,

Hi

Having problem here with Siemens Prisma 3T DTI/T1 data. 

1. dcm2nii -> dti.nii.gz bvals, bvecs and t1.nii.gz ->  dtiInit 
2. AFQ_example -> from dt6.mat 

Thanks for considering my request!

Just recently, I've not been able to use the AFQ_RenderFibers scripts because the command 'minmax' can no longer be found. 

```matlab
To use 'minmax', you might need:
  minmax - Neural Network Toolbox

Error in AFQ_RenderFibers (line 466)
    mx = minmax(coordsAll(1,:));
```

Any thoughts on why this may be happening?
