Hi! I'm trying to install ipynb on Ubuntu 12.04 using your cookbook. However, I'm running into the following error: 

```
================================================================================       
Error executing action `install` on resource 'package[libhdf5-7]'       
================================================================================       


Chef::Exceptions::Package       
-------------------------       
No version specified, and no candidate version available for libhdf5-7       


Resource Declaration:       
---------------------       
# In /tmp/kitchen/cache/cookbooks/ipynb/recipes/default.rb       

 29:    package pkg do       
        30:       action :install
        31:    end
        32: end



       Compiled Resource:
       ------------------
       # Declared in /tmp/kitchen/cache/cookbooks/ipynb/recipes/default.rb:29:in `block in from_file'

       package("libhdf5-7") do
         action [:install]
         retries 0
         retry_delay 2
         guard_interpreter :default
         package_name "libhdf5-7"
         cookbook_name "ipynb"
         recipe_name "default"
       end
```

Looks like `libhdf5-7` is not available on Ubuntu 12.04. I can add a fix in my own wrapper cookbook but would be nice to have this work out of the box. Can I request support for Ubuntu 12.04? I'm happy to submit a PR if needed. 

Thanks!

At https://github.com/rgbkrk/ipython-notebook-cookbook/blob/master/providers/profile.rb#L32, create_profile is called specifying that the group is identical to the user. If using a linux_group that is not equivalent to linux_user, this operation fails with error `can't find group for <linux_user>`.

After loading iPython notebook using the default attributes from the Vagrantfile I was getting the following error:

`WebSocket connection failed: A WebSocket connection to could not be established. You will NOT be able to run code. Check your network connection or notebook server configuration.`

I found this stackoverflow post that describes the issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22665809/how-to-configure-ipython-behind-nginx-in-a-subpath

And based on that post this nginx config seems to address the issue: `proxy_set_header Origin "";`

I'll be submitting a PR to fix this.
