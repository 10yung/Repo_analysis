I use UICollectionView with NHBalancedFlowLayout inside another UICollectionView because I must get the height of content in NHBalancedFlowLayout by this code:

```
[((NHBalancedFlowLayout *) self.filesList.collectionViewLayout) prepareLayout];
CGFloat collectionSize = [((NHBalancedFlowLayout *) self.filesList.collectionViewLayout) collectionViewContentSize].height;
```

But this function returns 0. How can I get the real size of content?

If you apply it for example 10k+ items it get stuck on:
linearPartitionTable:(NSArray *)sequence numPartitions:(NSInteger)numPartitions

- Fixes the [Issue of upscaled images](https://github.com/njdehoog/NHBalancedFlowLayout/issues/22) wich occurs if the partition algorithm assigns a single item to one row.
- Incorporates a fix for a crash on `[UICollectionView insertSections:]` from [Pull Request #24](https://github.com/njdehoog/NHBalancedFlowLayout/pull/24)
- It implements swipe in and out animations, when inserting or removing cells.

(Last one should be optional, but I didn't have time to implement that yet)


Running into memory issues and/or really slow performance on a large camera roll (10k items). Not really an issue per say, as I'm aware of the heavy computation going on, but I was wonder if you are seeing a significant performance improvement with the Swift rewrite?

I don't use supplementary views.

remove constraint on UIImageView in IB, and set the imageView.frame to cell.bounds to fix the bug on iOS7.1 building with iOS8. fix #28

Hi,

I've got this bug while  building with xcode 6, with iOS 8 SDK, running the app on  iOS 7.1.

Going to investigate if I've got enough time.

R.
