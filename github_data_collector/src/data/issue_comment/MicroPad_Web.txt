MicroPad has been locked in breaking-change + security update hell and the time to bite the bullet is now.

This is an almost working + almost fully tested update of a bunch of dependencies which involves the refactor of almost every epic in the entire app. I'm genuinely surprised I got as much of this done as I did.

Essentially the build scripts, redux, and redux-observable are being updated. All of those updates a breaking changes, hence the size of this PR. So far, almost all of the changes work except for some issues around search web workers, the sync epics haven't been tested yet, and the prod build fails because ['create react app' changed how service workers work](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/10/01/create-react-app-v2.html).

This also resolves #23
Currently the way data is sent down to note elements is convoluted and poorly engineered. It'd make development around that area of the app a lot easier if the children of the note viewer were smarter components that connected directly to the store.
It would be nice to have some sort of configuration/preferences pane to set things such as the default width for a note. It's nice to be able to have them be a uniform width without having to set the size each time.
The release notes say word wrap was removed to make it easier to use notes for lists and code.  However, I need to be able to write in paragraphs in order to jot down ideas, describe problems I'm working on, etc. The lack of word wrap makes this impossible.  I would like to see an option to enable word wrap again.


**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I'd like to be able to quickly switch between two notes at the same time (and even better, notes across notebooks). Having some sort of tabbed system so I can have more than one note open at the same time would be awesome.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Something like a plus button on the breadcrumb bar to open a new micropad view.

**Additional context**
To make it a less massive change to the structure of the application state, each tab could have its own unique `Store` with some IPC-style communication for shared state like if the same notebook is open in two tabs.
I really like the overall idea of MicroPad, yet I'm not a big fan of Markdown.
Would it be possible to integrate a visual rich text editor like [Quill](https://github.com/quilljs/quill)?
**Describe the bug**
Weird behaviour in drawing element, when leaving frame while mouse is pressed and releasing mouse in popup, but not in canvas. Lines get still drawn and if the mouse is pressed, dragged and release an additional line gets drawn between the start and release point of this movement.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behaviour:
1. Create drawing element
2. Start drawing
3. Leave popup while drawing
4. Enter popup, but nor drawing canvas with mouse
5. Release mouse
6. Reenter drawing canvas

**Expected behaviour**
Line gets finished

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Arch Linux
 - Browser Chromium, Firefox, Electron App
 - ÂµPad Version: v3.21.0

It would be great if users could export notebooks and notes as pdf files with all of the Markdown formatting remaining intact. That would allow users to refer back to the notes' content on a file-by-file basis and see the same formatting display that you get while in the program itself.
It will definitely be fantastic if this project can nativly work with apple pencil.


**Describe the bug**
Pressing TAB cannot be undone ^Z. All other keypresses I tried could be undone.

**To Reproduce**
1. Make new note
2. Press TAB
3. Try to undo by ^z

**Expected behaviour**
The TAB should be undone.

**System**
 - OS: Windows
 - Browser Chrome
 - microPad Version v3.19.0
