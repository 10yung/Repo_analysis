I was looking through some project regex and found this one [here](https://github.com/keybase/node-client/blob/589415d0ce4e2914a03810aeb1f43355ad761d26/node_modules/iced-coffee-script/node_modules/docco/node_modules/highlight.js/lib/languages/clojure.js#L92). It seems to use the \Z notation for an anchor but this is not a supported feature in the JS regex dialect.
This regex will match: 

Z


which I does not seem intended
Hello, 
keybase -d encrypt Adjorr01@twitter -m "Testing this out on you my friend. gpg encrypted I hope."

I get the following error when I post or track to username@twitter. 
debug: Full reply: {"status":{"code":100,"desc":"invalid name","fields":{"username":"invalid name"},"name":"INPUT_ERROR"}}
debug: ------- request to merkle/path -> KeybaseError: invalid name (error #100)
error: invalid name (error #100)

Config is filled out:
{
    "user": {
        "email": "jim@weasy.net",
        "name": "weasy",
        "salt": "blah",
        "id": "blah"
    }
}

I was able to push my key, and able to prove my twitter account. 
Suggestions?

Almost every subcommand fails with this error:

```
.../lib/node_modules/keybase/lib/merkle_client.js:539
          pathcheck({
          ^

TypeError: pathcheck is not a function
```

I think it happens whenever keybase calls `gpg2`. The rest of the log is [here](http://lpaste.net/146816).
I'm using keybase 0.8.22 with GnuPG 2.0.29 on NixOS.

If I pass a non-detached, non-clearsign signature to `keybase verify`, it checks the signature for me but does not tell me the content.

It appears that Keybase inherits GPG's tradition of calling this operation "decrypt", even though the content is not actually encrypted. The `keybase decrypt` command does what I want. Unfortunately, though, this command refuses to operate if my private key is not present, even though my private key should not be needed to verify a signature. It's also unintuitive to use "decrypt" for this -- every time I tell someone to use it for signature verification, they get confused and ask me if I meant "verify". Therefore it seems best for `keybase verify` to print the content, or provide a switch to print it.

Requires keybase/proofs@1db7586a1840ec3c3c0f54219c8f1ef5884e55d6 or later.

Decrypted output should include additional newlines to make it more user friendly.

An unsigned message decrypted outputs this:

```
This is a testdaniel@shadowbox:~$
```

A signed message outputs like this:

```
This is a testinfo: Valid signature from you
info: Signed 3 minutes ago (Mon Aug 24 2015 18:37:30 GMT-0500 (CDT))
```
