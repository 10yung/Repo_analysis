Hi, please check the flowing function:
```golang
func TestG2_Add2(t *testing.T) {
	_, X,_ := RandomG2(rand.Reader)
	fmt.Println(X)
	Y :=  new(G2).Add(X,X)
	fmt.Println(Y)
}
```
Then, Y is always bn256.G2((0, 0), (0, 0))



Depends on #52: Please review this first.

Depends on https://github.com/vuvuzela/alpenhorn/pull/11, and https://github.com/vuvuzela/internal/pull/2: these just move mock packages from alpenhorn to internal.

With this test running, you can run vuvuzela-client in another window connected to the local servers and send messages, etc.

It is skipped by default because it runs forever.

Window 1: `go test -v vuvuzela.io/vuvuzela -run TestRunVuvuzela`

Window 2: `vuvuzela-client -username alice@example.org -debug -home /tmp -url http://127.0.0.1:50620`

Dear @davidlazar,
Could you be so kind to generate ```.exe``` for the rest of us who are mere Windows users w/o compiler?
See questions inline. Depends on https://github.com/vuvuzela/internal/pull/1. Will later add tests for latency for #43 
I created an account on the site and received a token, but did not /register during the delay (24 hours).  Now I can not /register (it's too late) nor re-create the account using this very same address. If the address dead, or is there a way to receive a new token for it?

After registering with an email address on the site and receiving a token, I proceeded to run the client:
```
[2019-02-05 ☱ 13:19 ☴  ~]$ vuvuzela-client -username myusername@example.com
Failed to generate new Alpenhorn client: fetching latest dialing config: config expired on 2019-02-02 09:01:48.838394379 -0500 EST
```

go version go1.11.5 darwin/amd64
`echo $GOPATH=/Users/myusername/go`

The client should take into account the latency to the coordinator when deciding when to send its onion for a round.
We can make Vuvuzela immune to passive traffic analysis by implementing Karaoke's optimistic indistinguishability. This mostly involves changing the Vuvuzela client to send 2 messages in every round and to do something reasonable when messages are dropped.
