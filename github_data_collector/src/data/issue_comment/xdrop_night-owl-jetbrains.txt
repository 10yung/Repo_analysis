## Expected Behaviour

 ## What is the behaviour you were _expecting_
I just installed the them and it looks amazing but the font and color of the code is not applied.

I am expecting the code to look like this:

There seems to be a problem with the "Night Owl Carbon" theme.
I love this theme, but I have the problem that the directory names of directories containing changed files are almost invisible, and I didn't find a way to change their color.

See this screenshot as an example:
![ProjectExplorerColors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49159152/56653782-bafc5900-668e-11e9-834e-1dac5644f2f4.PNG)

I would expect a color that has a better visibility with the carbon theme's background.

IDE Version: WebStorm 2019.1.1
Material Theme UI Plugin v3.9.2
Night Owl Theme v1.4.0
using Windows 10
## Expected Behaviour

- folder node_modules and the subfolders should be readable

## Current Behaviour

- not readable color settings
- no setting to change this color

Now I've installed material ui and night owl theme.  All the git vcs changes shown in the gutter (and by files in the file tree) have dissapeared. 
This looks to be a bug as these are enabled in settings (see pic below). 
Hello

First of all, nice port of the original theme for IDEA. I only wish it had better support for Clojure language. Now function calls are highlighted as keywords and keywords are not highlighted at all, which feels incorrect.

I fine-tuned the theme a bit for Clojure and I believe others might like it too. However, I have no idea how to export the modifications out of IDEA to be PR friendly. Can you help with this?
