I would like to be wrong but it looks like Amethyst has no functionality similar to XMonad `toggleWS` from `XMonad.Actions.CycleWS`
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Actions-CycleWS.html#g:3

`toggleWS` allows quickly return back without thinking where you have been, so it would be nice to have such ability

## What's the problem?

Firefox window doesn't have same behavior as other windows when resizing. It's being animated. I'm quite sure it's a problem with firefox and not Amethyst as I also experience similar behavior with Spectacle or Rectangle.

When applying a layout such as Tall, Fullscreen or anything else, if Firefox didn't have the full size before applying the layout, it's not being resized properly.

Also, the animation is kinda slow, I wish I could disable it, but I didn't find the right settings in Firefox (searched through `about:config` with no luck).

## How can it be reproduced?

Download firefox, resize the window to a smaller window, apply a layout, lie down, try not to cry, cry a lot

## What applications are involved?

Firefox

## Has anything fixed it, even temporarily?

Applying the layout multiple times until window gets the right size, resize manually or use Spectacle or Rectangle multiple times

## dotfile (if you have one)

I don't have a dotfile, should-I?

## What's the problem?
I am unable to float the Android Emulator.

I believe it's related to #748 because the window title is empty when it is first created.
I also tried to create custom floating rule in settings with no success:

Note that I added an empty `bundleID` because the `qemu` application has no `bundleID` set, as I can see from the output of `lsappinfo`:
```

## System

## What's the problem?
Trying to switch layout to Binary Space Partitioning does nothing.  Switching to Binary Space Partitioning keeps the same layout as whatever I had previous to BSP.  Additionally, sometimes below the popup window when I switch layouts it may see things like `(Optional (numbers))`, or `nil`, or sometimes nothing below the popup.  I have tried using the shortcut to force-reevaluate the layout, and defined specific shortcuts to switch to BSP to no avail.

## How can it be reproduced?
Switch to BSP

## What applications are involved?
All

## Has anything fixed it, even temporarily?
No

## dotfile (if you have one)
Amethyst has a dot file?  How do I use it?
```
{

}
```

## Feature
Would it be possible to add keyboard shortcuts to increase or decrease screen padding? I work on a large monitor at home and I constantly need to change the padding in settings to push the windows away from the edges.

## What's the problem?

I'm using my laptop with 2 external monitors while at my desk, but unplug from them 10 times a day to go to meetings, which usually mess around my tiles and shuffles them all into one screen. 

## How can it be reproduced?

Set different tiling configuration on multiple monitors, then unplug those monitors.

## Has anything fixed it, even temporarily?

When I'm motivated enough, I switch back the windows from external screens to dedicated spaces and re-apply the tiling configuration that I had. 

## Suggested improvement

Could we have an option in Amethyst that automatically transfer any windows from "Screen X" into "Space X" if Screen X is unplugged? This would allow to virtually keep those screens, and therefore leave the tiling configurations untouched. When a user would go back to his desk and plug back his screen, the opposite would happen, moving "Space X" back to "Screen X" as if nothing happened.

Only conflict I could think of is if people use both Multiple Screens AND multiple Spaces, but if this stays an option and can be opt out that would allow those users to stay unaffected.

I had a quick look at other Issues, and it seems #896 could benefit from this approach as well?
EDIT: I kept reading past issues and it looks also very similar to request #786

since we already have:

mod2 + 1 | Throw focused window to space 1
-- | --
mod2 + 2 | Throw focused window to space 2
...
mod2 + 0 | Throw focused window to space 10

would be nice with we have to

mod1 + 1 | Focus space 1
-- | --
mod1 + 2 | Focus space 2
 ....
mod1 + 0 | Focus space 10
