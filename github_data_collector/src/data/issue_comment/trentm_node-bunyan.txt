Somewhat related to #591, there seems to be no way to apply serializer/masking logic to logs that simply provide a string, and not a JSON object. For example, the following log event will not use a serializer:

```
log.info('An email is here: test@example.com');
```

Related code:
https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan/blob/fe31b83e42d9c7f784e83fdcc528a7c76e0dacae/lib/bunyan.js#L949-L952

We have a use case where we use bunyan for logging both requests and messages in our node applications. What we would like to do is to be able to apply serialization/masking logic to _any_ log that goes through bunyan.

From what I've seen digging through the code, it seems this is not currently possible. Could you confirm that this is the case? And if so, will bunyan support this eventually? Also curious about any workarounds. Thank you!
## Description
Bunyan leaks out environment variables if **this** is not defined when log.info is called. This changes the default behavior to output the current stack trace as suggested here: https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan/issues/565

I've created a repository which reproduces this issue here: https://github.com/kamranjon/bunyan-leak

## Notes
Open to other solutions but this seemed like the safest option that also returns useful output.

I see you have way for people to compile it. But do you have a es5 compiled ready to go version in the repo?
I noticed that installing bunyan 1.18.12 normally in an empty project gives me a node_modules size of 3.83 MB, while installing with `--no-optional` gives me 440 KB. I think this difference is significant enough to deserve mention in the README.

Fixed a spelling mistake of the word 'cause' in Serializers in the Introduction section.
