Hi 

           I developed a web page to track face using tracking.js   . It is working fine on android phone, but when it come come ipad or iphone some video is not rendered properly, frame rate is very low. Not able to detect face at all. Any idea on whats happening?

This project seems great, but it seems PRs have not been merged since 2018, indicating too much stress landing on the initial contributors. Maybe you should actively seek some help from people with more time to spend?

Feel free to [take some inspiration from us at Sinon](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon/) as we have felt the pain of too many issues landing on our doorstep. We have entries for how to fund us using Open Collective, how to get started contributing and calls for additonal maintainers.
I tried the [Camera Demo](https://trackingjs.com/examples/face_camera.html), but it never loaded. I inspected the Console and saw the issue:

```
GET https://trackingjs.com/bower/tracking.js/examples/[object%20MediaStream] 404
```

There's some funny string concatenation going on.
I have a specific need for tracking different parameters in photos and videos. How can I create a data file like face.js, mouth.js, etc?
The mobile phone terminal has been unable to open the camera, but the PC terminal can open the camera. I hope you can help me. Thank you

Hello, I am trying to only detect if an image that a user uploads has a face or not. But on using, I get errors

```

Error trying to load tracking-min.js in Node: window is not defined.

The library assumes usage on the browser: can we decouple browser-specific parts out so it can be loaded in Node?
