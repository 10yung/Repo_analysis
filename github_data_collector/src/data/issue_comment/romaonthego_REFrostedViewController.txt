Hi @romaonthego 

I have been using your SDK in my old Objective-C project , i have integrated it successfully and working fine . 

Currently i am facing one issue with side menu. When we stretch the side menu towards right , it is moving all the way towards  right and get back to original position. 

Can you please look into this and suggest me best possible way . 

For your reference i am sharing my screenshots.

**B**ut  the scenario in my app is started from a UITabBarController. It's flow is like : UITabBarController -> DEMORootViewController -> UINavigationController -> some UIViewControlers ->DEMOFirstViewController->DEMOLeftMenuViewController.
**I** set "Hide Bottom Bar on Push" on the UIViewControlers and DEMOFirstViewControllerï¼Œ btu the bottom bars on these UIs does not hide !
**I** am a newer in ios development, and i am hopeless! could you help me sir Great romaonthego ?

How to pangesture working in mapview of gsm map. I can't swipe to show Left Menu in map view 
Thanks for watching :)
When I try to get topmost controller it always return REFRostedViewController ,but  I need to  find topmost controller from its child viewController .
I have this delegate method

```
- (void)frostedViewController:(REFrostedViewController *)frostedViewController willHideMenuViewController:(UIViewController *)menuViewControllerg
{
    [frostedViewController.contentViewController viewWillAppear:YES];
}
```

viewWillAppear only works after 2x open and close of sidenav. im calling this to set content after side nav is closed.

workaround:
```
- (void)frostedViewController:(REFrostedViewController *)frostedViewController willShowMenuViewController:(UIViewController *)menuViewController
{
    [frostedViewController setContentViewController:frostedViewController.contentViewController];
}
```
reassign contentview controller when viewing side nav
I did not find panGestureEnabled in the REFrostedViewController file, how to disable the skid menu

Any plans/ suggestions to port this library to React Native?

Anyway, thank you @romaonthego, it's great view controller which helped me a lot :)
