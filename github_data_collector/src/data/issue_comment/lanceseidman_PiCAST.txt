This project needs a license so it can be legally used/downloaded/forked.

Would it be possible to not to perform the system upgrade unconditionally? I'm not sure that all packages should receive their minor updates to make PiCAST work. But it takes a heck amount of time and risky to do without a backup.  

What can be done instead:

* [Y/n] to `apt-get upgrade`, and wait for response
* [Y/n] to `apt-get upgrade` with timeout defaulting to Yes
* Check if the system needs upgrade. If yes, stop and provide the option to restart with force flag
* Do not do automating upgrade at all, instead add "do apt-get upgrade" in Troubleshooting section in README.   

Thanks. 

PS. Still waiting upgrade to terminate.

Use "util" instead of "sys"

Hello,
I would like to uninstall PiCAST please. I prefer to start it manually.
I do not find any solutions ...
Its almost like my Pi 2 can't keep up? The Mplayer shows the program but has loads and loads of black and white lines on it.

It would be faster to compile software with the `-j4` parameter on `make` using multicore systems (Pi 2, 3). Checking if commands are successfully executed before continuing with the installation process will reduce unsuccessful installations due to errors.

PS: No need for `forever`, the server can be wrapped in a `while true` statement.
"sudo ./configure --arch=armel"
shouldnt it be armhf if its a pi 3(A/B)?
Hi there, 

Well, everynthing is in the title, I'm kind of a noob so not sure what could I say.

On a Rpi 3 with Raspian up to date, I downloaded the setup.sh file in my home folder, ran `chmod +x setup.sh`, setup.sh is now executable but nothing happend, so I tried `setup.sh` and `sh setup.sh`, but only get this in return `setup.sh: 8: setup.sh: Syntax error: newline unexpected`.
If I browse to `http://ip-to-your-Pi:3000` replacing with my ip, I have a connexion failure (in french : "La connexion a échoué").

I'm a noob but usually find my way, but now I have now clues what's wrong, but that it seems that there is an error, maybe at the 8th caracter, or line 8 ? 

Any help would be welcome.

Thank's in advance.
When i install forever it has this error
