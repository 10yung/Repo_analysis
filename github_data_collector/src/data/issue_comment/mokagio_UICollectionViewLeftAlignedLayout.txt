When I applied the layout to a collectionView with section headers, the headers except the first one were not correctly positioned. It seemed that the origin of the headers were the same as that of the first row of cells in the same section. Any suggestion? Is it a bug, or have I miss anything? Thx
fix #26
still digging, don`t know why
If there are 2000 data, sliding up and down, only in demo, kartun will not quit, in the project will be kartun and quit, because memory problems exit

如果有2000个数据，上下滑动，只有在demo中卡顿不会退出，在项目中会卡顿和退出，因为内存问题退出。
Hey,

First of all, thank you for awesome library! I noticed that the latest tag is 1.0.3 which added Swift 4 support but the podspec is still pointing to 1.0.2.


 //notice: fixed accuracy value problem
 previousFrame.origin.y = floor(previousFrame.origin.y);
当我有一个section的cell的宽度都为屏幕宽度的时候,这个section的cell就会错乱

" cell get wrong with  displacement when cell's width equal to device width" 
This is odd. I've been using this in a project for quite a while and it was working fine. I recently did a new build and now the collection view I'm using this for doesn't show any items. In the debugger I can see that numberOfItemsInSection is returning the correct (> 0) number -- but cellForItemAtIndexPath is never getting called.

I tried switching to the cocoapod and updating to the latest -- same thing.

Anyone else seeing this? Any thoughts?

Additional info -- I've been using estimatedItemSize and a cell w/ autolayout.

If I comment out the estimatedItemSize assignment, the cells appear (but are all sized the same).

Thanks
John
