I'd love to see @feathericons in Fontello. I've repackaged them using Fontello available here: https://github.com/okj579/feather-font.

The icons are licenced under the MIT License. Let me know if there's anything more you need.
Asset load error: "N.Wire" unavailable after asset load. 
cant load any fonts in your website
browser: Chrome

os: Windows

step-by-step instruction:
Download google material icons from https://github.com/google/material-design-icons.
Import all svg icons, about 2000 svg files.
When export font using my local Fontello server, error returned as 404, not found.
When export font using Fontello.com, it works fine.

After debugging through the source code, find out api.download.js await N.wire.emit('server:fontello.font.download', env); is executed even before font_build.js finishes output zipdata to disk.

When reduce the total number of svg files to below 500, my local Fontello server works.

It looks like with large number of svg files, the font_build.js is not able to finish the output job before emit the download event.

By the way, thank you very much for the excellent work on Fontello server.
Hi, when trying to load the website I get the following alert error:

Asset load error (bag.js): Can't open url /assets/bundle-fontello.en-US-8d00df3b19b3af122a6a1161b1fd43fc.js

When navigating to that file: http://fontello.com/assets/bundle-fontello.en-US-8d00df3b19b3af122a6a1161b1fd43fc.js

It seems to take a fairly long time to actually download that in the browser, but the file does exist.

Any ideas?
I wanted to share fontello.com with my friends on Facebook and discovered that Facebook appends the fbclid parameter to the URL example

http://fontello.com/?fbclid=IwAR26V6wYydvgBaZyM1gtoSycmk3q90dTbcubwHVivdfs-pimX7u7Kn-vgOOI

Clicking on the link serves up a `[400] Bad Request` error.

I checked previous issues here, but I couldn't find any mention of it.

Steps to reproduce: click on the link above or append any parameter to the URL on the fontello.com site.

I'm using Chrome 76 on Linux 

I'm trying to download selected icons, and in both Chrome and Safari I'm getting a Network Error. It says "The network connection was lost" during the download. Any suggestions? This happened both yesterday and today.

Hi, I tried giving a name value with case sensitive text for example: _My-Font-Icons_ and downloaded the zip file. I found that it converted the name to lowercase and named the files like _my-font-icons_
First thanks for your great tool!

Can you create an extra option for base64 encoding the woff and woff2 fonts and put the result in the css-file in the download-package?
Would be very nice. I now always need to do that as a second step.
Putting small (icon)fonts base64-encoded straight in css speed up the rendering of a webpage: (less server-requests and font is immediately available for browser when parsing the CSS when put in front of the CSS file)
Thanks in advance,
Klipper
FontAwesome 5 generate its web font using fontello but only the icons 0xf020 to 0xf0ff are visible with the generated TTF font on Windows desktop and, worse, also with Chrome when GDI rendering enabled (All Chrome versions on Windows Vista / XP and Chrome versions lower than 37 on windows 7+)
