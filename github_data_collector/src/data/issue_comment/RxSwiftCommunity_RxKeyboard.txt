When you run the sample project, hiding the keyboard exposes the message below. It also has a negative impact on keyboard disappearing animations. Can you see why?

2019-11-15 08:36:18.949460+0900 RxKeyboardRxKeyboardExample[11852:3243216] -[UIWindow endDisablingInterfaceAutorotationAnimated:] called on <UITextEffectsWindow: 0x10a80b400; frame = (0 0; 375 812); opaque = NO; autoresize = W+H; layer = <UIWindowLayer: 0x282c38ce0>> without matching -beginDisablingInterfaceAutorotation. Ignoring.
I've realised that on iPhone XS Max you can get >0 height of the hidden keyboard. So better compare keyboard height with epsilon nether than 0
Problems on the iPad, also affecting the RxKeyboard observer applied to other views when calling the keyboard from pageSheet. Is there a way to solve this problem?
- Update UITextView+Placeholder version to prevent crashing at iOS13
References: https://github.com/devxoul/UITextView-Placeholder/issues/68
At RxKeyboard.swift, following error occured in line 118 and 138.
```
'shared' is unavailable in application extensions for iOS: Use view controller based solutions where appropriate instead.
```
A simple instance of UIScrollView with UITextField in contentView. I can attach a sample project if it's needed.

```swift
RxKeyboard.instance.visibleHeight
   .debug("RxKeyboard")
   .drive(onNext: { [scrollView] in scrollView?.contentInset.bottom = $0 })
   .disposed(by: disposeBag)

scrollView.rx.observe(UIEdgeInsets.self, "contentInset")
  .debug("ScrollView")
  .subscribe()
  .disposed(by: disposeBag)
```

After assigning zero (keyboard hides) it reverts back to previous value. Output:
```
2019-07-16 13:16:14.546: RxKeyboard -> Event next(0.0)
2019-07-16 13:16:14.547: ScrollView -> Event next(Optional(__C.UIEdgeInsets(top: 0.0, left: 0.0, bottom: 0.0, right: 0.0)))
2019-07-16 13:16:14.548: ScrollView -> Event next(Optional(__C.UIEdgeInsets(top: 0.0, left: 0.0, bottom: 315.0, right: 0.0)))
```

Maybe, it's not `RxKeyboard` problem, however implementing it with raw `NotificationCenter` resolves the issue.
Changing `RxKeyboard`subscription code to async (code smell) also resolves the issue:
```swift
RxKeyboard.instance.visibleHeight
    .asObservable()
    .observeOn(MainScheduler.asyncInstance)
    .bind { [scrollView] in scrollView?.contentInset.bottom = $0 }
    .disposed(by: disposeBag)
```

Maybe I just don't understand something. Could u please share your thoughts?
Is it correct use first window in multi window app?

`UIApplication.shared.windows.first?.addGestureRecognizer(self.panRecognizer)`

Hi guys!

I use Carthage. And when I try to fetch dependencies I get this error:
```
*** Downloading RxKeyboard.framework binary at "0.9.2"
***  Skipped installing RxKeyboard.framework binary due to the error:
	"Incompatible Swift version - framework was built with 4.2.1 (swiftlang-1000.11.42 clang-1000.11.45.1) and the local version is 5.0 (swiftlang-1001.0.69.5 clang-1001.0.46.3)."

    Falling back to building from the source
``` 
and then below
```
*** Skipped building RxKeyboard due to the error:
Dependency "RxKeyboard" has no shared framework schemes for any of the platforms: iOS

If you believe this to be an error, please file an issue with the maintainers at https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxKeyboard/issues/new
```

Could you release a new version with a binary compatibly with Swift5?
Right now I just added the sources directly in my project and everything works. But..

Thanks!

Hello,

On iPhone X, Xr, Xs in the example when you tap the search bar and the keyboard appear there is a gap between the bar and the keyboard. The reason is because it's constrained to the safe area in MessageListViewController (96) : 
if #available(iOS 11.0, *) {
            make.bottom.equalTo(self.view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.snp.bottom).offset(-keyboardVisibleHeight)
          } else {
            make.bottom.equalTo(self.bottomLayoutGuide.snp.top).offset(-keyboardVisibleHeight)
          }

While this is intended behaviour when there is no keyboard this doesn't work when it open. I'm gonna try to fix it but if someone as a nice way to do it it would be great to have it in the example.
I try to hide keyboard by tap on tableview but it's not work !

any hint please .
Thanks
