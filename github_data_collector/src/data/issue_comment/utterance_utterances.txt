@jdanyow,

would it be possible to offer _utterances_ also for [GitLab Pages](https://pages.gitlab.io/)?

Many thanks for your help.
Hi mates,
I looked at client.js but I think to re-create a `<script>`-Tag in an SPA env is not the preferred way.

So I came up and _drafted_ an Utterances Vue Component which actually (should) do the same as the client.js but in the Vue-way. More precisely, it generates and updates the `<iframe>`.

Pls have a look at https://github.com/AskSinPP/asksinpp.de/blob/master/.vuepress/theme/components/UtterancesComments.vue

If you find any frictions, please let me know. Perhaps we could transfer this Component into your Repo or create an _official_ one in your org. Or we develop an entire Vuepress-Plugin for utterances ;)

PS: the project name is not very google-friendly :D 
Hi,
I wonder if you thought about a thread feature where ppl can answer to a specific topic.
So the idea is that a _thread_ is an Issue (with custom topic) and assign to a page using labels.
In addition we could mark a thread als "solved" by closing the issue.
I use Gatsby and love utterances on react-with-utterances. I have implemented useDarkMode in my site and would like to know of some way to switch between light and dark with this module and others. 
This could be done with useState  in React hooks but not sure how to do it any clues.
I would like to add the utterances discord server invite link to the site. https://discord.gg/gCtZ8m. 

Closes #182 

Added options to reverse order of comments and put the input form above comments, instead of below. As most of the time I expect either both or none of them to be used, they are handled by a common checkbox in the config generator.

Overall it seems to work, but I have not tested it on cases with hidden pages (I have not seen any).

Example config (from the `configuration-component`):
```html
<script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
        repo="[ENTER REPO HERE]"
        issue-term="pathname"
        theme="github-light"
        reverse-order="true"
        input-position-top="true"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script>
```



Fixes #182

```html
<script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
        repo="[ENTER REPO HERE]"
        issue-term="pathname"
        theme="github-light"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        sort="new" 
        async>
</script>
```
`sort` is not mandatory. And is default to `"old"`
It seems there's an unnecessary(IMO) horizontal padding on each side of the rendered comment box:

https://github.com/utterance/utterances/blob/6aec0b7607340748daa9394681c523388f86bf68/src/stylesheets/timeline.scss#L3

Currently this slightly breaks my blog's layout. Is there any option to remove this padding?
What is different about the github API for public and private repos that makes utterances not work for the latter?

Even if a public repo was used to collect issues, separately for a private repo, it's entirely possible that comments in the public issues could leak sensitive information about the private repo.

Thanks.
This is the one of the last two things that Utterances needs to beat Disqus & friends.
