Fix the `KEY_HOME` scan code. Currently incorrect. Reference list of scancodes: https://wiki.osdev.org/PS/2_Keyboard#Scan_Code_Sets
When I ran `make qemu`, I got something like this:

> ...
which: no qemu in (/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin...)
which: no qemu-system-i386 in (/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin...)
...

The error messages of the **_which qemu_** command should not be printed.
According to the GNU Make documentation ([5.1 Recipe Syntax](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Recipe-Syntax.html#Recipe-Syntax)):

> Any line in the makefile that begins with a tab and appears in a “rule context” (that is, after a rule has been started until another rule or variable definition) will be considered part of a recipe for that rule.

> A comment in a recipe is not a make comment; it will be passed to the shell as-is. Whether the shell treats it as a comment or not depends on your shell.

So I think we should change the _**shell comments**_ in Makefile to _**make comments**_.




According to Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volumn 3, Chapter 3, Section 3.5.1:

> The base address of the GDT should be aligned on an eight-byte boundary to yield the best processor performance.

Should we change `.p2align 2` to `.p2align 3`?
A few fixes for xv6. These are mostly infrastructure changes to paper over differences between environments, but also fixing an assertion failure in `mkfs` and a couple of small things in the kernel itself.

Please note that, about 10 years ago, someone created a git _tag_ called `master`; presumably this was an accident. This causes ambiguity when performing e.g., a rebase; `git checkout master` will check out the master branch as expected, but `git rebase master` (or even origin/master!) will rebase against the *tag*, which is most definitely not desired.

The `master` tag should probably be deleted, though I don't know how to do that using a github pull request; a repository owner can do it, however.
Use of -O2  produces strange results when single-stepping with gdb.
Use -O0 gives more predictable results.
Passing current offset into file is needed for drivers to handle random access devices (such as /dev/kmem).

This can be used in a lab, assuming students have implemented the lseek syscall first.
A simple modification which could have saved one hour
of my debugging time...
Since the constant 4096 is typically the size of a page, use a
named constant in order to make clear that this is not the case
here.

This respect the original code from Kernighan and Ritchie,
(The C programming Language, 2nd ed. Section 8.7, page 188).
