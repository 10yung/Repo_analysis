- Items do not appear in Google

**Steps to Reproduce the Issue**  
- Copy past Meeting Request in Outlook
- Paste on Future Date in Outlook
- SYNC OGCS
- OGCS tries to delete the newly pasted future Outlook Meeting Request
- OGCS does not create the meeting in Google

**OGCS Version**: v2.8.3-alpha
**Installed or Portable**: Installed

**Problem Description**  
I have configured 3 instances of ogcs to start at login time (in the registry Run settings) and since I upgraded to the latest alpha version, I sometimes get an error from 2 instances:
Application unexpectedly terminated!
The process cannot access the file 'c:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\OutlookGoogleCalendarSync\app-2.8.3-alpha\ErrorReporting.json' because it is being used by another process
The application stops after this

**Steps to Reproduce the Issue**  
start multiple instances of OGCS at the same time

**Problem Description**  
OGCS crashes after switching default data file in Outlook. First a message box appears saying default calendar has been selected and auto sync has been temporarily disabled. Immediately after that, another message box appears with 'Window handle already exists' (see screenshot).

4. Open Mail settings in Control Panel
5. Click 'Data files', select a non-default data file and click button 'Set as Default'. Confirm message box.
6. Close Mail settings
7. Start OGCS
8. Problem occurs

**Any other information**  
To reproduce it's best to have another valid data file (second mailbox) ready first.


**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I have a personal email address that is used with an exchange account. I have used OGCS more than once when I have a temporary need for a company I am working with, sometimes more than one at a time. Currently a paid subscription is only available by registering with the Google email address, which in my case, is temporary.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Allow another email address (in my case, my permenant one) to be used to register OGCS>

**OGCS Version**: v2.8.3.0
**Edition**: Installed
**Sync Direction**: G->O 

**Bug Description**  
There is a Google Calendar entry for a Webex meeting invite. I believe the meeting creator used the Outlook Webex plugin in their Outlook client to create the meeting invite. The meeting is a recurring meeting, which occurs every two weeks. Note this may be related to a bug submitted a few days ago where OGCS fails to properly sync Webex meeting content when the meeting was created using Gmail, not Outlook.  In this case the content with the meeting details is not garbled, but OGCS is creating duplicate entries in Outlook. It appears a duplicate is created every time OGCS syncs.

**Steps to Reproduce the Issue**  
1. Go to...
1. Click on...

**Any other information**  
I am attaching a .XIP with  .mht version of one of the duplicates created by OGCS (I can tell it is a duplicate, because OGCS assigns it to a category). and a .mht version of the original.

I have updated to the new version and now get this popup requiring to map some appointment timezone to my system timezone.
I don't understand why it is required.
My system timezone does not change. Maybe it could be read from my Windows or Outlook settings. At least I shall only have to set it once for all.
I find this popup quite annoying.
Do I miss something here?
