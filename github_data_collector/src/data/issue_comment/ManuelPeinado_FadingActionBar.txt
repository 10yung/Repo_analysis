As "compile" is going to be deprecated end-2018, this PR replaces with "implementation" that is the new usage.
does anyone has a documentation for this library 
I don't know how to use it

```
When I Scroll UP, toolbar is hide. When I Scroll DOWN, it shows toolbar . But when I Scroll DOWN, I want to show toolbar (ScrollState to the top). It have ScrollState.STOP. I thinks to check condition. `implements ObservableScrollViewCallbacks`

toolbar = (Toolbar) findViewById(R.id.tool_bar);
setSupportActionBar(toolbar);
getSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);
scrollView = (ObservableScrollView) findViewById(R.id.scroll);
scrollView.setScrollViewCallbacks(this);

@Override
public void onScrollChanged(int scrollY, boolean firstScroll, boolean dragging) {

}

@Override
public void onDownMotionEvent() {

}

@Override
public void onUpOrCancelMotionEvent(ScrollState scrollState) {
    ActionBar ab = getSupportActionBar();
    if (ab == null) {
        return;
    }
    if (scrollState == ScrollState.UP) {
        if (ab.isShowing()) {
            ab.hide();
        }
    } else if (scrollState == ScrollState.DOWN) {
        if (!ab.isShowing()) {
            ab.show();
        }
    }
}
```
Could you please add Gradle wrapper to simplify project build (from CLI)?

I have already integrated this library with an ScrollView in another activity and it works Fine but I also need to use this with and Expandable ListView.
There is no scroll on the header image when I try using the code in ListView Activity for my Expandable listview integration.

Can anyone suggest solution please.

Hello Team,
I loved the design layouts posted by your team.It would appreciate if you could include the steps to run the code in Android Studio SDK ! 
Thanks,
Irene

I have an EditText inside the ObservableScrollView and when i click on it and then clear its focus the header moves up depending on how much you had scrolled, this can be seen in the images below.

Before doing anything

Edit text is focused

Edit text loses focus and the image moves up

If anyone has any clue on how to fix this please let me know, thank you!
