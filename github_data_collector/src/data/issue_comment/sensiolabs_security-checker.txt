Adding in a line to reference the time that the Security Checker command was run as it can be useful for auditing when included in build plans. 
Since not open source Symfony CLI provides the same functionality.
This will allow users to run `vendor/bin/security-checker`, without the `security:check` part.
composer install is executed in "D:\WebProject\K&W\RROP2.Laravel\submodule.webservice-api"

```
 Executing script security-checker security:check [KO]
  [KO]
 Script security-checker security:check returned with error code 1
 !!  Could not open input file: D:\WebProject\K
 !!  The command "W\RROP2.Laravel\submodule.webservice-api\vendor\bin\" is either misspelled or 
 !!  could not be found.
 !!
 Script @auto-scripts was called via post-install-cmd
```
More and more people are used to use gitlab an other CI tools, junit integration would help a lot with that kind of integrations
Proposal to fix #115
Right now security-checker can only scan the composer.lock file in the current directory.

This is quite inflexible, i.e.:
1. One can't just pass a path to check.
2. It's not possible to pipe in info, e.g. curl https://example.com/composer.lock | security-checker [...] --infile -

Can you add an option to allow passing an input filename?
