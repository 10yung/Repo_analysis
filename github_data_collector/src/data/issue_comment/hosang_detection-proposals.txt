I am trying to replicate the repeatability plots. Running plot_recall_voc07.m only generates the recall curves. Using run_repeatability.m crashes immediately because the image names are stored without path in data/pascal_voc07_test_annotations.mat . Which script should I use?

Hi,

I wanted to ask whether you have considered adding **Proposal Failure Analysis** or something  like this to the overall analysis. 

For example, if the proposal method is missing ground-truth boxes, what are the different conditions it is  missing it?
