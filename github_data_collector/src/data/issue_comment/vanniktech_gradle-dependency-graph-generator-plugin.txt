I've been using the 0.6.0-SNAPSHOT version without problems for a while now (after #86 was resolved), but it would be so much more convenient if it was available in a public repository.

Any chance of a 0.6.0 release in the near future?

I tried latest release version `0.5.0` as well as snapshot version `0.6.0`. I tried running `dot` command manually and was getting permissions error, running it with `sudo` seemed to work ðŸ˜• 
if we were to add an `@Nested` to the generator property and declare the properties within it appropriately as inputs it should result in a proper up to date check.

looks like there was some mention to it there that remains in need of resolution as well.
As a [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl) adopter, I'd like to know how to configure this plugin using the Kotlin DSL.

[This plugin was identified](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/6790) as one of the most useful Gradle plugins. With Kotlin DSL 1.0 approaching shortly, it'd be wonderful if the documentation provided Kotlin and Groovy DSL samples. [Blog post with suggestions](https://blog.gradle.org/groovy-kotlin-dsl-samples).

Here are a couple additional resources:

 * [Migrating build logic from Groovy to Kotlin guide](https://guides.gradle.org/migrating-build-logic-from-groovy-to-kotlin/)
 * [Exemplar for automated samples testing](https://blog.gradle.org/documentation-samples-testing-exemplar)
 * [Join #kotlin-dsl channel in Gradle Community Slack for personalized help](https://join.slack.com/t/gradle-community/shared_invite/enQtNDE3MzAwNjkxMzY0LTYwMTk0MWUwN2FiMzIzOWM3MzBjYjMxNWYzMDE1NGIwOTJkMTQ2NDEzOGM2OWIzNmU1ZTk5MjVhYjFhMTI3MmE)

Thank you for providing a great Gradle plugin! â€”The Gradle Team
