bug: the logic for parsing $speed was backwards.
bug: temp file not removed on exit

enhancement: added -f and -t options to extract short clips from a long video

Is it possible to show progress? Some conversions take quite a while and it's hard to tell if things are still ongoing.

Following the readme, tried `-r 20@2` and it failed:

```
 ï£¿  gifify -r 20@2 -p 640:-1 richcomment.mp4 
Exporting movie...
(standard_in) 1: illegal character: @
(standard_in) 1: parse error
```
