I hate to duplicate closed issue, but it seems to be a common problem Somehow the one I have is different from everyone else's, I've found online. My issue is perfectly described here: https://github.com/haiwen/seafile/issues/2277
I am running Seafile CE 7.0.5 docker image with 80 port exposed on 8000 port of the host. I don't use SSL as I run this instance locally. But for some reason avatart address points to https:// instead of http://
So far I've tried every solution for missing avatars that I've found on forum and github. SERVICE_URL is set correctly to http://host_IP:8000

We are running seafile 7.0.5 and our users complained about getting `{"error": "Internal error. "}` when uploading files using the web interface.

It seems that there is a problem only with files with diacritic in names. For example: "čestné-prohlášení.doc"
Files without diacritic are not affected. Also, files uploaded using seafile client are uploaded correctly.

This error is reported in the **seahub.log**:
`seahub.api2.endpoints.repo_file_uploaded_bytes:52 get Failed to get upload temp file path from db.`

And following can be tracked in **seafile.log**:
`../common/seaf-db.c(622): Error exec prep stmt: mysql_stmt_execute failed: Illegal mix of collations (latin1_swedish_ci,IMPLICIT) and (utf8_general_ci,COERCIBLE) for operation '='.`

The various notifications that appear in the firefox browser are sometimes false. 

When saving a text or makedown file  from the firefox browser. The first notification of saving is ok (green) and the following ones are either orange or even red with a message telling us the file is not saved (although it has been saved).

I can't find this notification error in the chromium browser. 
Hi,

Running seafile-mc from your official Docker image, latest version (7.0.5). For some files, the file history doesn't load. The only log about this event is in seahub.log:

`[WARNING] seahub.views:867 file_revisions Wrong type of suffix_list: None`

I would be happy to help investigate.
Imho it would still be preferable to have the build instructions within the repository, so they always match the commit when checking out an older version.
## 环境说明:

服务器版本：7.0.5

## 重现过程
1. 点击资料转让
1. 前端显示 “Internal Server Error”
1. 后端seahub.log中出现 `[ERROR] seahub.api2.endpoints.departments:37 get 'CcnetAPI' object has no attribute 'list_all_departments'`

但实际可以正常转让资料。

I’m trying to use the api for creating a folder, I’m always getting the following error :

> Trying example.com…

Here is my cURL command :

`curl -d  "operation=mkdir" -v  -H 'Authorization: Token' -H 'Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8; indent=4' http://example.com/api2/repos/LIB_ID/dir/?p=/TEST`

I created a token before using : 

`curl -k -d "username=MAIL&password=SECRET" http://example.com/api2/auth-token/`

Which give me a valid token. I was able to create a lib using the API.


As per title. **When generating a password protected share link, _the user's own (account) password_ is pre-filled by default**. Tested with Seafile Pro 7.0.9 but worked the same in every prior version I have personally used.

**I do not think this is a sane or reasonable default**, as it makes it easy for registered users to _leak their password_. Instead, a randomly-generated password (new diceroll for every share link) should be pre-filled by default.

Additionally, a "copy password" link would be _nice to have,_ as currently the only way to get the password in a copy-able form after using the password generator feature is to have it mailed to yourself, which is unnecessarily cumbersome **and potentially insecure**.
