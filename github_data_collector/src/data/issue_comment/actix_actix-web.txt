A simple Chinese story for autor

"What do you say of a man who is loved by all the people of his neighborhood?"  

 "We may not for that accord our approval of him." 

"And what do you say of him who is hated by all the people of his neighborhood?" 

"We may not for that conclude that he is bad. It is better than either of these cases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad hate him."

Sorry for my poor English, but a Chinese old saying is 
```
“乡人皆好之，何如?”

“未可也。”

“乡人皆恶之，何如?”

“未可也。不如乡人之善者好之，其不善者恶之。”
```
I really hope the author can think more about himself, his wonderful project and the person who support him, but not the people who just want to judge others.
I recently started a project months ago  using actix-web to write back end server. 
I port the old java/Spring based to rust/actix-web based.
actix-web is great and I learnt a lot.
I didnt do any optimization and find out actix-web is very fast and write less. 
It is sad to hear you fed up with the project.
During the development of my project , I think I want to made some improvement of actix-web
as return. 
Anyway. Thanks 
You are a great person man. I did a pull request and interaction with you was perfect, you were very helpful. Also this library was way better then anything in rust except maybe compilation times.

"Big" guys are mad because you beat them in benchmarks and your unsafe code doesn't cause any relevant bugs. They are toxic because you are good man this is actually a compliment to you.

I understand that it feels bad to get attacked by a bunch of jealous losers. But I am sure there are many people understand and support you.

I saw the blog post from the security guy and It is pathetic you really shouldn't let losers like him effect you.

Reddit people are just a bunch of circle jerking losers. You shouldn't take them seriously.

Also fk you to all the undefined behavior fetishists and losers who caused this.
I learned about this story on the forum, I don’t know all the details, so I won’t say too much.
Also, I am not a supporter of the Rust language and do not do web development. But the fact that because of the pressure of people you felt so bad that you deleted your work sadly.

Remember that YOU are the developer of your brainchild
Remember that YOU decide how YOUR program works and how not to work
Remember that there are people who just TROLES and try not to pay attention to them
Remember that YOU are a programmer and are not required to obey any fictitious philosophies of the language.
The language has a tool you use and a point. Whoever disagrees is free to fork, not philosophize.

Yes, and just humanly hold on to each other. Sometimes in life there are moments in which we become weak and any words or events can break us.

I hope after a while you will come to your senses and continue to do what you love. It’s not necessary to restore everything. You can do it for yourself.

But remember, in addition to even perhaps smart but evil people, there are others. Unlike those who advised you verbally how to do you did.

In general, I do not know you. I did not use your work. But it seems to me to be just a kind word to support you.
Do not worry, come to your senses and let everything be fine with you.

Good luck and good mood of ideas and inspiration. Till! Ignore the trolls.

P.S.
Sorry for my English. I am from Russia and do not speak English well
Hi fafhrd91
I would love to use your actix-web framework, please publish. Actix-web is the only one, that is production ready framework for me. Please publish it, I appreciate your work a lot.

Thanks
@fafhrd91 Don't listen to the BS from the supposedly most friendly community ever [Rust]. I review many frameworks and Actix is head and shoulders above anything else I've seen in the rust community including tide which is being built by supposed community expert, numerous contributors and for months it's still not ready for production. Many people have used Actix in production with spectacular results. I wouldn't listen to the comments of several haters. If they weren't haters, they would roll up their sleeves and contribute to making it even better. Personally I don't want to see the framework go but do what's best for your own mental state.

Even if it's one person that loves and uses the project... you've succeeded. Change starts with impacting one life and I believe open source is the same. There are several advocates of Actix here and we'll continue to defend it. Don't be disheartened and discouraged, you can't save everyone but you can impact, influence, encourage and support many as you've done. Keep going, don't look back... I guarantee you, as I have, many will continue to fall in love with Actix, your work and effort. That's the reward and not the voice of a bunch of irritable critics that have not and probably cannot do better.
Second paragraph is identical for me,

I have heard pretty much everything by now. From "I am the CTO of this and that and I **DEMAND** you to fix my shit for free", to "I am going to stop using your stuff **unless** this and that", to "Fuck you, you son of a whore for doing this and that which **I** disagree with".

It's like, people need to shut the fuck up and stop acting like parasites. Pretty much 90% of GitHub is just parasite people demanding free consulting, free advice, free debugging, free bug fixing, etc. And nobody knows how to read, not even the README file in front of their faces. The mentality of GitHub is "I use your stuff therefore I **demand** you to pitch why I should use it". It's basically like people think they make **you** a favor, by using your stuff for free.

I took a 10 minute shit once and received 2 identical GitHub issue reports that both were in the FAQ, they don't even care to spend one second thinking for themselves. And people keep reporting issues which are self explanatory in plain text.

My advice is, **refuse** to take **any** shit unless you get paid hard golden cash. If anyone gives you the slightest shit, block them, ban them, delete their issues and go about your day. They are worthless parasites, that's exactly what they are. Fuck this whole "community" bullshit and communist free-for-all-but-nobody-pays-yet-infinite-free-stuff mentality.

People of GitHub don't understand how intellectual property laws work; some even believe whole heartedly that **they** own open source projects and that the projects belong "to the community". That's mindblowingly ignorant and incredibly worrying.

I say fuck all parasites and do what makes you happy. Show no mercy. You do you.
I do not know the back story here, just another aspiring Rustacean from the Python world and minor-league open source maintainer. This is the first time I have ever seen this happen and it saddens me all around. So, I would like to suggest another possibility of governance for this repo, used by Debian for many years, and recently chosen by the Python community as its post-BDFL governance method as well, which can take the pressure off of any single maintainer: Ranked Choice voting, aka the Condorcet method. With it, decisions can be made in an uncontroversial and graceful manner by `N` maintainers.

It's absolutely fair, you have my 100% support! You are the man who created it and if you so desire you should be the one who kills it for good. You don't have to be sorry, you don't owe anyone anything, especially in the open source community! 

I hope people will start thinking with their heads before writing _I know better_ comments! If you think you can do better, then hit that fork button and show it! Otherwise it's nothing more than just showing off.

I wish you the best! Go ahead, get the world!
