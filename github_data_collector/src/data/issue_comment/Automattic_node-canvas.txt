I'm having trouble with using packed .ttc files in node canvas.

The design of registerFont api does not seem to work with packed fonts, and I have tried numerous ways but it seems only selects the 'normal' weight.

I'm with node v13.5.0 on macOS Catalina btw.
## Issue or Feature

I couldn't install this package in my computer with Node.js v13.x, however I fixed it by downgrading Node.js to v10.18.0, but I still don't know why I couldn't use Node.js v13.x to compile (install) it.

First, I met **node-gyp rebuild errror** and **gyp ERR! stack Error: `make` failed with exit code: 2**:

```

As said in https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/issues/854 and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32898887/boost-no-longer-works-with-homebrew-on-mac-el-capitan/32929012#32929012 , I thought it may be a problem belongs to Mac OS X v10.11+, so I tried `npm install node-gyp -g` and `xcode-select --install`, but it didn't work.

I also tried many solutions which contains some similar errors output, such as https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/issues/788#issuecomment-234702763 , https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/issues/788#issuecomment-234702763 , https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/1694#issuecomment-499784965 , https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/issues/854#issuecomment-272637456 , etc. One of them looks like this:

```
xcode-select --install # I thought this was dumb, but was key to one of my issues 
npm install node-gyp -g
brew install giflib cairo libjpeg giflib pixman
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig
OTHER_CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include npm install canvas
```

However, it didn't work. :-(

## Steps to Reproduce

```js
// with nvm installed before
nvm install v10.18.0
npm install canvas
```

## Your Environment
* Version of node-canvas: 1.6.13
* Environment: macOS 10.15.1 (19B88)

Thanks.
The majority of issues opened in node-canvas are for installation help. This post is an experiment to see if we can help users help themselves to troubleshoot installations.

## Installation fails with a 404 in the log

#### If you're on Alpine Linux or another distro using [musl-libc](https://www.musl-libc.org/)
The log may look like 

```
node-pre-gyp WARN Tried to download(404): https://github.com/node-gfx/node-canvas-prebuilt/releases/download/v2.6.0/canvas-v2.6.0-node-v64-linux-musl-x64.tar.gz
```

Prebuilds are only available for glibc, not musl-libc. See https://github.com/node-gfx/node-canvas-prebuilt/issues/77, which includes information on building from source.

#### If you're using Electron

The log may look like 

```
node-pre-gyp WARN Tried to download(404): https://github.com/node-gfx/node-canvas-prebuilt/releases/download/v2.6.0/canvas-v2.6.0-electron-v3.0-win32-unknown-x64.tar.gz 
node-pre-gyp WARN Pre-built binaries not found for canvas@2.6.0 and electron@3.0.11 (electron-v3.0 ABI, unknown) (falling back to source compile with node-gyp)
```

There are no prebuilds available for Electron. Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki#installation-guides) for guides on building from source. See also https://github.com/node-gfx/node-canvas-prebuilt/issues/84 or https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/issues/1467.

#### If a new version of Node.js was recently released

The log may look like

```
node-pre-gyp WARN Tried to download(404): https://github.com/node-gfx/node-canvas-prebuilt/releases/download/v2.6.0/canvas-v2.6.0-node-v79-win32-unknown-x64.tar.gz
node-pre-gyp WARN Pre-built binaries not found for canvas@2.6.0 and node@13.3.0 (node-v79 ABI, unknown) (falling back to source compile with node-gyp)
```

We manually publish prebuilt versions of node-canvas, and it can take some time for us to catch up. In particular, Appveyor (used for Windows) is slow to provide new Node.js versions, so Windows prebuilds may be delayed.

You can see the list of available prebuilds here (expand the "Assets" section under the version you're trying to install): https://github.com/node-gfx/node-canvas-prebuilt/releases.

#### If you have an ARM CPU

Prebuilds aren't available for ARM. Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki#installation-guides) for guides on building from source. See also https://github.com/node-gfx/node-canvas-prebuilt/issues/69.

## I get a permissions error (`EACCES`)

Possibly your `node_modules` or an npm or yarn cache or temp directory is owned by a different user. Review the error log to see what folder you don't have permission to access. See #1429 for an example, or [any of these issues](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+eacces).

If you were trying to install with `sudo`, try without. (See [issues](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+sudo).)

## I get a `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` error

The log may look like

```
...was compiled against a different Node.js version using NODE_MODULE_VERSION 72.
This version of Node.js requires NODE_MODULE_VERSION 64. Please try re-compiling or
re-installing the module
```

This could mean you upgraded Node.js without re-installing canvas. Try running `yarn` or `npm install` again.

## Installation fails with lots of compiler errors, including `...was declared deprecated` and/or `no viable conversion`

You're probably trying to install an old version of node-canvas. Version 2.x is required for Node.js v6.x and later. Check if your package.json or lock file specifies a 1.x version.

```ts
//...
// width: 100, height: 100, scale: 2
	const canvas = createCanvas(width * scale, height * scale);
	const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
	ctx.scale(scale, scale);

	ctx.fillStyle = "white";
	ctx.fillRect(0, 0, width, height);

	if (dev) {
		ctx.fillStyle = "black";
		ctx.font = "12px Sans-Serif";
		ctx.fillText("dev", 4, height - 4);
	}

	ctx.fillStyle = "black";
	ctx.font = "12px Sans-Serif";
	ctx.fillText(`${width}x${height}`, 4, 16);
//...

## Steps to Reproduce

My repository: https://github.com/Kristonitas/imaginer
Earliest commit with the issue: https://github.com/Kristonitas/imaginer/tree/3f7564a73cf2f323755410d4115b4ce4d521d428
Edit the `index.ts` to have scaling enabled (I used `2`): `const imageStream = render(width, height, { dev, scale: 2 });`
When running locally, open http://localhost:3000/100/100

## Environment
* `canvas@2.6.1`
* `npm@6.13.4`
* `System Version: macOS 10.15.1 (19B88)`

## P. S.
While installing, I had to manually execute `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"`
Would make a simpler reproduction case, but since the issues is solved just by recompiling, I don't see it worth the effort.

I'm trying to install canvas on macOS Mojave 10.14.5. I executed `brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg` but there is still an error.

## Issue or Feature
When i type `npm i canvas` the following log appears:
```
MACBOOK:project user$ npm i canvas

Context: Creating png images using custom fonts

Not super familiar with node-canvas's c++ side of things so I may be way off but it seems there is some sort of caching going on.  I'm having an issue where some fonts within a family all render using the exact same font face (whichever font was registered first being the one that is used for all subsequent fonts). While digging, I found that these fonts have the same "preferred family name" and the same "style" properties within their meta info (using FontForge). Using FontForge to change the preferred family name, I was able to get these to work properly but thats not a solution for how we're using node-canvas.

https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/blob/d2d632402b7032fb0ff755be138d20b87766aff6/examples/font.js#L14

The above example hints that the family name and styles within the font's meta info will be used... Is there a way to override that behavior and provide pre-defined names instead of using whats provided inside the file itself? 

I'm using register font like this:

```
registerFont(localFilepath, { family: options.localFontName })
```
