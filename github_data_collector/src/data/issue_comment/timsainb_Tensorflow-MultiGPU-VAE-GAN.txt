Hi,
Just wondering if you have the VAEGAN weights available still (and are happy to share them)

Thanks in any case,
Arthur
I may be mistaken about that, but when I ran the code I got an error:
TypeError: No conversion path for dtype('<U19')

After googling I added this type conversion and everything worked fine.

Hya!
both google drive dataset links doesn't work.
The database of image should be found in dropbox image, but I can't get the file list_attr_celeba.txt.
There is a way to have it?

Greets,

Hey!

I have basically implemented a version of your model myself. I got it to work on MNIST but I also want to make it work on other datasets. 

My question is how did you find the optimal hyperparameters on the celebA dataset, did you do a grid search?

regards,


Riaan
Hi,
I found the code cannot produce the results showed in jupyter notebook.Is there any chance that you can update the codes ? Really need some details to make VAE-GAN works.
Hi,

I download your network and train it but the results are not good.
My results are so blurry and not human-like.

How many epochs are needed to converge?
I observed that  the results collapse after 70~80 epochs.
All hyper-parameters are same as your version.

Is there any optimization tip?
Any advice would be very helpful.

Thank you.
Normalizing the dataset to values in range [0,1], done by this line:
`faces = (faces/255.)`
doesn't seem to work properly, at least not with the visualizations. 
Is it meant to somehow improve the training process?

Really nice repo but appears prettytensor support is somewhat broken due to fast changing TF api

Some issues similar to https://github.com/google/prettytensor/issues/46

And the data is a bit harder to locate now due to downed links.  The attributes labels can be found here at least: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cadl/celeb-align/list_attr_celeba.txt
using explicit conversion to np.float32 and inplace scaling saved me ~8GB of RAM.
