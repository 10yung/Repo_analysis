- lubridate not an option, too many deps
- https://github.com/gaborcsardi/parsedate maybe, but no time zone support that I need
- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/anytime/ Rcpp and BH though, pretty heavy, though we do already import tibble, so Rcpp is already needed
e.g. 

```r
ch_defcategory(n = 60, cat = c("Open", "Closed", "Pending"))
```

generate a vector of 60 categories consisting of either the term "Open," "Closed," or "Pending"

Possibly allow variation to be controlled as well

```r
x <- DateTimeProvider$new()
format(x$date_time_between("1900-01-01", "1900-12-31"), format = "%Y-%M-%d")
#> [1] "1900-51-11"
```
https://github.com/joke2k/faker/#how-to-create-a-provider

e.g., could be maybe:

```r
library(charlatan)
FooBar <- R6::R6Class(
  "FooBar", 
  inherit = BaseProvider,
  public = list(
    foo = function() super$random_element(letters)
  )
)
x <- FooBar$new()
x$foo()
#> [1] "j
x$foo()
#> [1] "y"
x$foo()
#> [1] "f"
```
i opened an issue in R6 github repo a while back and winston responded recently https://github.com/r-lib/R6/issues/138#issuecomment-421476245 

I think i opened it with charlatan in mind. That is, methods from a parent class that children inherit i'd rather not show to the user just to make it a cleaner interface. 

Try Winston's suggestion ...
- I've seen duplicate names in the person-providers that I've worked with, e.g. fr_FR had "Margot" twice in the first_name_female vector. I can imagine there are duplicate names in other locales. A thorough sweep should be performed on all locales.
- All name vectors in all locales should be sorted alphabetically (for cleanliness). Many of the vectors already are. But a sweep should be performed.
I haven't been able to find an example in the faker packages of other languages, but then maybe I have missed existing stuff.

The idea would be to have something similar to MissingDataProvider but instead of replacing the picked values with NA's, it'd modify them slightly to make them invalid (for stuff that can be _valid_, e.g. phone numbers have a given format) or just different (e.g. for people names). I guess making an element _different_ isn't too difficult, but making it _invalid_ is a bit more effort.

Maybe in the vignette? An example where one would create a data.frame with missing data.
