Hello,
Thanks for this package. What is the best way to remove the shortcuts please? pip uninstall jupyter-emacskeys and reinstalling jupyter (through conda) did not work. Reason for uninstalling is that 'ctrl w' is a browser shortcut to close tab. 
Thanks
Love these bindings. Its so hard to switch between emac and jupityer.
However, once I start using some of the keys, I expect ctl-n, ctl-p to go up and down. Ctl-n works, ctl-p brings up the print menu...
Hi - any chance you can bump the version number and push the latest to the pypi repo?  The latest it has for [this is from October](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jupyter-emacskeys/0.2.3), and we're hitting the issue you fixed with 22e2a57 wrt python 2 compatibility.  Thanks!

Hey!

I was doing something like this in my `custom.js` and recently decided to turn it into an extension to be able to choose between the different key maps. I looked around to gather ideas and I took the `Ctrl-Y` re-map and line wrap ideas from here. The extension has now been integrated at https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/select_keymap (or here's my branch https://github.com/aiguofer/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/select_keymap) in case you're interested. I added a link back to here in the README to give credit.

Thanks!

First off, I love this, thanks a lot!

The "ctrl+n" shortcut doesn't work for me though, while "ctrl+p" does. I'm using Firefox both with and without keybindings for all GTK text boxes.

Any suggestions?
