Could anyone please explain the meaning of 'dictionary_size' and how it affects the speed? Thank you.

Good day!
When  starts compile.m , I have compile error:

**>> compile**

Respected Sir,
When I run following command 
datasets_feature(datasets, train_lists, test_lists, feature, c);
I got error:
Error using imread (line 349)
File "sun2.jpg" does not exist.

Error in imgread (line 12)
    I = imread(img);

Error in build_dictionary>(parfor body)
(line 49)
      img = imgread(filelist{perm(i)},
      p);

Error in build_dictionary (line 47)
    parfor i=1:num_images

Error in datasets_feature (line 31)
      c.feature_config.(feature).dictionary
      = build_dictionary(train_lists{i},
      feature, c);

how to remeove this error.
Thanks
Histogram refinement results in https://github.com/Ashwani21/Local-texture-descriptors are very promising.
Hi 
    When I try to extract lbp features and ssim features with Matlab2015b, the code cannot work.

Hi, I am trying to run your code in Matlab R2011a and having quite a bit of difficulty. Compile.m gives me several error messages such as "features/ssim/vggSsim/MEXfindnearestl2.cpp: In function 'void mexFunction(int, mxArray**, int, const mxArray**)':
features/ssim/vggSsim/MEXfindnearestl2.cpp:62: warning: deprecated conversion from string constant to 'char*'"

Then when I try demo.m, I get this type of error:
??? Undefined function or method 'matlabpool' for input arguments of type 'char'.

Error in ==> openPool at 20
  if(matlabpool('size')==0)

Error in ==> datasets_feature at 16
    openPool(c.cores);

Error in ==> demo at 24
datasets_feature(datasets, train_lists, test_lists, feature, c);

Could you please help?

Thanks,
