Creating configurePizza object doesnt require the last property to have a comma
Following the section "Ensuring authentication before placing an order"
I get these errors shown on console very briefly and i have already completed the tutorial.

> Error parsing a meta element's content: ';' is not a valid key-value pair separator. Please use ',' instead.

At:

> authenticate:8

And a error with an x in a red circle:

> Refused to load the image 'https//api.twitter.com/favicon.ico' necause it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "img-src https//abs.twimg.com https//*.twimg.com https://pbs.twimg.com data".

> At authenticate:1

 
It hapens when the line of code "NavigationManager.Navi..." runs
```
@code {
    [CascadingParameter] Task<AuthenticationState> AuthenticationStateTask { get; set; }

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var authState = await AuthenticationStateTask;
        if (!authState.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            // The server won't accept orders from unauthenticated users, so avoid
            // an error by making them log in at this point
            NavigationManager.NavigateTo("user/signin?redirectUri=/checkout", true);
        }
    }

    // Leave PlaceOrder unchanged here
}
```
If i coment the "NavigationManager.Navi..." line the error doesn't show in console, so must be something in that line but i don't know what. The user controller class runs on the server so if there is some error there it shouldn't show up that way in the browser console.

Maybe it is something to do with this code inside the user controller at "/user/signin" route:
```
await HttpContext.ChallengeAsync(
                TwitterDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
                new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = redirectUri });
```
This has nothing to do with Blazor, it's about aspnet core authorization, but even so, it's in the demo, so... maybe worth to fix. Or maybe it's not a big deal because the application works.

I'm following this workshop with net core 3.1. 

from [session 3 doc](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/blazor-workshop/blob/master/docs/03-show-order-status.md#polling-for-order-details)

> This uses OnParametersSet instead of OnInitialized or OnInitializedAsync. OnParametersSet is another component lifecycle method, and it fires when the component is first instantiated and any time its parameters change value. If the user clicks a link directly from myorders/2 to myorders/3, the framework will retain the OrderDetails instance and simply update its OrderId parameter in place.
> As it happens, we haven't provided any links from one "my orders" screen to another, so the scenario never occurs in this application, but it's still the right lifecycle method to use in case we change the navigation rules in the future.

but, when I switch between pages as follows 

- `myorders/1`
- `myorders/2`
- `...`

via inputing url in  browser,  it seems that `OrderDetails` component will always re-initialized. 

Is this doc outdated or do i something wrong? 


Hello,

3.1.1 is due by January 14, 2020 and 3.1 is out since the beginning of December.
Could you plan to upgrade this blazor-workshop to a 3.1.x version with .NET Standard 2.1 please.
Could you add some screen shots showing how to configure new keys from the Twitter developer console
After order is delivered, no need to keep calling api to get status.
I have built the solution in VS2019, then run BlazingPizza Server Debug, the console started ok. And Edge has appeared with address http://localhost:64590/
but it gives an error:

>  This site canâ€™t provide a secure connectionlocalhost sent an invalid response.
> Try running Windows Network Diagnostics.
> ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR

How to fix it?
I'm using Visual Studio Code and in the second preview document we are told to add the code for showing the dialog window `<ConfigurePizzaDialog>` but there's an error or tokenization issue that says this is an unexpected name and if it's intended to be a component then add a @using directive for its namespace. Not sure what the namespace should be which is why I'm using this to learn Blazor.
