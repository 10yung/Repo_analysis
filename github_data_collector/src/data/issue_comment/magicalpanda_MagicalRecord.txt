I am using core data in my app and when I update an app my last saved records in core data are lost. I can see that my database paths change every time an app runs. Can anyone pls help to find the reason for data loss? I am running the code with XCode 11 and iOS 13.2.
Hello,

As per my knowledge, by default implemented case-insensitive.

But i need to fetch records with case sensitive order.

thanks in advance.
I have an app currently live with high volume of daily users (100k +). Every time the app opens it tries to save a small json from an endpoint to coredata. It works 99.9% of the times but sometimes I get the following errors:
• The operation couldn’t be completed. (NSSQLiteErrorDomain error 13.)
• The operation couldn’t be completed. (Cocoa error 13.)
• The file “<DatabaseName>” couldn’t be opened.

from this block of code:
```swift
MagicalRecord.save({ context in
            User.mr_truncateAll(in: context)
            users.forEach({ user in
                if let item = Prize.mr_createEntity(in: context) {
                    item.name = user.name
                }
            })
        }, completion: { (_: Bool, error: Error?) in
            Log(error.localizedDescription)
        })
```
Any insights would be appreciated.

In [Cocoapods MagicalRecord](https://cocoapods.org/pods/MagicalRecord), We are unable to find the latest version. Please find the screenshot and let me know once it's available in Cocoapods!

Hello,

In iOS 12 beta 2 I face the following issue.

I call from UI a method to update some data in my database with the following code:

```
[MagicalRecord saveWithBlock:^(NSManagedObjectContext *localContext) {
    Item *theItem = [FriendItem MR_findFirstWithPredicate:aPredicate inContext:localContext];
    [theItem setSomeData:data];
}];
```

The problem is when this function is called multiple times, the app freezes.

The console output is:
```
Created new private queue context: <NSManagedObjectContext: 0x281da8000>
Created new private queue context: <NSManagedObjectContext: 0x281d992c0>
→ Saving <NSManagedObjectContext (0x281da8000): saveWithBlock:completion:> on a background thread
→ Saving <NSManagedObjectContext (0x281d90960): MagicalRecord Root Saving Context> on a background thread
```

That was working for 2 years.
Is something that I missing, or there are changes in core data in iOS 12?

Τhanks in advance.

Hi, I'm wondering if when retrying objects with: `MR_findAllWithPredicate:`, `includesPendingChanges` was activated ?

I've make another method using:

```
NSFetchRequest *fetchRequest = [[NSFetchRequest alloc] initWithEntityName:[Entity MR_entityName]];
fetchRequest.includesPendingChanges = YES;
fetchRequest.predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"issueId == %@", issueId];
NSArray *array = [Entity MR_executeFetchRequest:fetchRequest];
```
Thanks you in advance.
