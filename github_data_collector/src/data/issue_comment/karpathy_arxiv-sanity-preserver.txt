For example 0401304v1 is a valid ID of one the papers for cond-mat. It was  downloaded among first articles for condensed matter physics category. (btw, ´--search-query 'cat:physics:cond-mat'´ did not work and I hardcoded 'cat:cond-mat' into the fetch_papers.py) 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0401304v1.pdf

As  a result it is impossible to add the articles to the personal library. The icon is inactive (the JS UI gets 'NO' as a server response all the time because article ID doesn't pass validation)

When downloading less than the `args.results_per_iteration`, incorrect
totals are printed to the screen. This solves for this edge case.
Dear all,

I am looking for RSS feeds from `arxiv-sanity`, but unfortunately it seems that it is not provided. Does this feature sounds good to you? If yes, I can start developing it through a fork.

Regards,
Noël.
Currently, we have to create a username and a password to create a login credential. I think a Github Login option should be available.
this is potentially the same issue as  #125.
I just want to stress its urgency

Hi!

First, I want to thank you for this amazing website.

The top hype does not seem to change anymore, maybe the authentification tokens have expired or something? The last commit to the `twitter_daemon.py` is from march 2017 so that would make sense if the token had an expiration date of 2 years.
As i see this module deployed with flask. And too many users use it, so
how to fine tune resource allocation and schedule configuration ?
And are their some common suggestion guide to this kinds of applications ?
