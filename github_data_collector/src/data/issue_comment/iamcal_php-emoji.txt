I'm using:
`$string = $this->emoji->emoji_to_html($string);`

Here's a screen cap of the results while attempting to convert a tweet to HTML. Note how the US flag converts to HTML beautifully, but the IE flag doesn't convert at all.

* built using recent emoji-data with new emojis from 2017, e.g. FaceWith Open Mouth Vomiting
* support for skin tones
* support for compound emojis made of serveral single emojis, e.g. Family: Man, Woman, Girl, Boy
The using emoji_contains_emoji I noticed a number of maybe false positives, it's up for debate as you could use many of these symbols as emoji. Since I was working with a larger source of user generated content I opted to retrieve valid sources of emoji and Unicode characters. The following is the test scripts.

Two examples are

Detected as emoji ⤂ 

Not detected 3️⃣ as emoji

Not sure if any thing should be changed other than adding a few more emoji into the data set as the false positives for the most part look fine as emoji.
Thanks you for this amazing library.

Is there any emoji picker that corresponds with this library?? I mean the picker that produce the exact `span`? (Then I can convert it to native emoji with this library)
I found this repo in https://packagist.org/packages/iamcal/php-emoji
But now there is only "dev-master" version is valid.
maybe you should check the repo's "Integrations & services" page.
Parsing posts from twitter. Sometimes it adds extra emoji after some twitters emojis. I store data in MySQL with ***utf8mb4_general_ci*** collation
I've found that its useful to have a method for not unified emojis search.

Replaced span for img tag and added alt tag with emoji so the emoji can be selected and copied

This is useful if you want to support `:emoji:` syntax like GitHub.
