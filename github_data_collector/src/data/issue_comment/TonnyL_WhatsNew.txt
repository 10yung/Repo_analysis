Hi @TonnyL , when the WhatsNew fragment is recreated by the system (eg: Screen Rotation), all the fragment properties are reset, except "list" (the list of items).
That's because all the other properties are set via apply in the dsl, and "list" is the only one passed in the bundle and set in the fragment lifecycle (by lazy).
I have a list of 10 items, and the first few have icons. The last ones use WhatsNewItem.NO_IMAGE_RES_ID and everything is fine...until I add more than 10 items. Then the icons become mismatched.

Example:

new WhatsNewItem("Item 1", "This is item 1.", R.drawable.ic_whatsnew_check),
new WhatsNewItem("Item 2", "This is item 2.", R.drawable.ic_whatsnew_check),
new WhatsNewItem("Item 3", "This is item 3.", R.drawable.ic_whatsnew_check),
new WhatsNewItem("Item 4", "This is item 4.", R.drawable.ic_whatsnew_check),
new WhatsNewItem("Item 5", "This is item 5.", R.drawable.ic_whatsnew_check),
new WhatsNewItem("Item 6", "This is item 6.", WhatsNewItem.NO_IMAGE_RES_ID),
new WhatsNewItem("Item 7", "This is item 7.", WhatsNewItem.NO_IMAGE_RES_ID),
new WhatsNewItem("Item 8", "This is item 8.", WhatsNewItem.NO_IMAGE_RES_ID),
new WhatsNewItem("Item 9", "This is item 9.", WhatsNewItem.NO_IMAGE_RES_ID),
new WhatsNewItem("Item 10", "This is item 10.", WhatsNewItem.NO_IMAGE_RES_ID),
new WhatsNewItem("Item 11", "This is item 11.", WhatsNewItem.NO_IMAGE_RES_ID),
new WhatsNewItem("Item 12", "This is item 11.", WhatsNewItem.NO_IMAGE_RES_ID)

results in:

(ICON) Item 1 - This is item 1
(ICON) Item 2 - This is item 2
(ICON) Item 3 - This is item 3
(ICON) Item 4 - This is item 4
(ICON) Item 5 - This is item 5
Item 6 - This is item 6
Item 7 - This is item 7
Item 8 - This is item 8
Item 9 - This is item 9
Item 10 - This is item 10
(ICON) Item 11 - This is item 11
(ICON) Item 12 - This is item 12
Through utilizing Kotlin's extension function, it is now possible and optional for clients to add listeners for when users dismiss the dialog view. Additionally, documentation has been updated to reflect the addition. 
Is it possible to get a callback so I know when a user has finished viewing WhatsNew page?
I was implementing this library and first of all thank you for making my work a bit less with **WhatsNew** 
I am creating the instance for creating the dialog when a user clicks a card and with what I've encountered till now it seems like I am only able to create the dialog once, calling it the second time does nothing. Any solutions for this, I want the change to persist the whole time.
I am using code from example:
```
 with(whatsNew) {
            presentationOption = PresentationOption.DEBUG

            titleColor = ContextCompat.getColor(this@MainActivity, R.color.colorAccent)
            titleText = "What's Up"

            buttonText = "Got it!"
            buttonBackground = ContextCompat.getColor(this@MainActivity, R.color.colorPrimaryDark)
            buttonTextColor = ContextCompat.getColor(this@MainActivity, R.color.colorAccent)

            itemContentColor = Color.parseColor("#808080")
            itemTitleColor = ContextCompat.getColor(this@MainActivity, R.color.colorAccent)
        }
```

But unfortunately gets button with accent color every time
