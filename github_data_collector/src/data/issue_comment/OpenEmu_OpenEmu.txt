When I play any N64 game and save state for the second time OpenEmu freezes. I have to force quit and reopen the app. I tested this with multiple games and it freezes with all of them. Tried Super Nintendo, no freezing. Works fine. 

I was on 2.2 so I installed 2.1.1 by just dragging into applications folder then telling the system to replace the 2.2 file. Tried everything again and it still freezes. 

Running macOSX 10.15.2

It freezes with or without my PS4 controller plugged in.

Also, this didnt happen before I updated to 2.2 today. So maybe I need to do a more thorough down grade than just dragging the app into the applications folder. Any ideas?
Howdy. Thanks for adding GameCube support to OpenEmu, it's been a blast so far. I know it's been in the pipeline for a while so congrats and well done!

I'm wondering if we can expect support for other graphics backends for the Dolphin core, like Vulkan? I'm not sure which API that OpenEmu is using, I would assume OpenGL however as it runs similarly to Dolphin when I'm using OpenGL, i.e. some significant buffering and lag in heavy sequences like Metroid Prime's opening cutscene.

Vulkan however runs that cutscene much smoother when I use the Dolphin emulator outside of OpenEmu. I think support for Vulkan makes sense as Apple deprecated OpenGL and will probably remove support any day now (Vulkan uses the Metal API through a translation layer).

I'm no expert though and I could be completely wrong about all of this!

My specs:

OpenEmu v2.2
macOS v10.15.2
3.5GHz Quad Core Intel Core i7
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780M

Gamepad input glitches everywhere with v2.2. Reverted back to 2.1, and everything works fine. The gamepad I'm using is a RetroLink USB N64 Controller.

3 Steps to reproduce

1. Select gamepad as input in the controller menu
2. Assign buttons (*** Sometimes will not allow you to assign buttons, sometimes will ***)
3. Select a game, and open it.

# Expected Behavior

1. Game should function normally, buttons on gamepad should correspond with actions in game when pressed

# Observed Behavior

1. Some buttons do not function, in some games there is a hard drift to the left with analog stick, or several directions of analog stick not registering at all.

2. When assigning gamepad buttons, sometimes OpenEmu will allow buttons to be assigned, sometimes not. Quitting and restarting OpenEmu may allow you to assign buttons, but the issues with buttons and analog play as stated above still exist.

Examples: In Mario Kart 64, the analog stick does not register left or right. In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, there is a hard drift to the left.

# Debugging Information

- OpenEmu Version: 2.2 (No issues in previous builds with this gamepad and OS)
- macOS Version: Mojave 10.14.6

## 1 - Summary of issue

Xbox One controller (bluetooth, model S) is no longer working correctly. Analog sticks no longer mapped by the emulator.

## 2 - Steps to reproduce

1. Update OpenEmu 2.1.1 to 2.2;
2. Connect Xbox One S Pad by Bluetooth, using macOS Catalina official controller drivers. Pad with batteries fully recharged;
3. When trying to map the Xbox One controller, the analog L and R is no longer working properly. OpenEmu cannot map the analog sticks anymore or is mapping them in wrong places (e.g. when trying to map Y- axis for UP the emulator automatically sets Y- for LEFT, not allowing for manual correction);
4. Reverting OpenEmu to 2.1.1 solves the problem, when the Pad is fully working.

## 3 - Observed Behavior

1. Controller doesn't work via Bluetooth or wired;
2. Pad is brand new, used without problems in previous builds of OpenEmu;
3. The problem still continues even using third-party drivers (unofficial FranticRain's 360Controller);
4. The problem still continues in previous macOS release (Mojave, 10.14.5);
5. Neither updating or doing a clean OpenEmu installation seems to solve the problem. Only reverting to the previous version.

## 4 - Debugging Information

1. OpenEmu: Version 2.2;
2. Hardware: Mac mini Late 2014 with macOS Catalina 10.15.1.
OpenEmu Version: 2.2

Thank you for adding new system support.
OpenEmu is now becoming the most definitive reason to stay on Mac.

I have a question that some GC games need multiple discs, for example, "Baten Kaitos",
since the core is different from Mednafen, the .m3u method seemed not applicable.
Is there any method to support multiple discs GC games?

I moved my game library to an external hard drive, using the 'change...' dialogue in library settings.
I then later moved it back to the original location, using the 'reset' dialogue in library settings.

Everything moved over, but on clicking any game to run it, an exclamation point appears and it says a rom file couldn't be found. I can locate the files, they're all in the right place, but what has happened? How can I relink everything properly and automatically so I don't have to locate the file each time?

Thankyou for any assistance

- OpenEmu Version: 2.1.1

Summary of issue

I use Soundflower to be able to record system audio with screen recordings and also mic input (recording gameplay with audio and mic chat) but OpenEmu doesn't work well with such configuration.

# Steps to reproduce

1. [Install & Setup Soundflower ](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases)
1. Use OpenEmu with Built-In sound
1. Change output to Soudnflower device or Multi-Output Device, using Audio MIDI Setup or System Preferences > Sound > Output

# Expected Behavior

- Sound should comtinue

# Observed Behavior

- OpenEmuHelperApp hangs/crashes

# Debugging Information

```log
default	14:49:30.703626 +0000	OpenEmuHelperApp	AVAudioIONodeImpl.mm:706:_GetHWFormat: Unexpected number of channels in asbd: agg device (236) has 0, input sub-device (90) has 2 channels. Will query the formats again!

There is regression error. 
After upgrade from 2.0.9.1 to 2.1.1 my PS4 Bluetooth controller is lagging. Pressing key is send after period of time. Version 2.1.0 is same problem. I downgrade. I can easily test that situation.
 
# Steps to reproduce

Use version 2.1.0 or 2.1.1.
Connect PS4 Pad by Bluetooth. Mac on cable, Pad recharged fully.
Play Game (i play PS 1 ). Using saved state. About 10min need to be shown (that is crucial, first action is perfect)
I try disconnect between update. I use same options and machine and game. Everything between version is no touch. 
Downgrade to 2.0.9.1 
Issue is gone

# Expected Behavior

Play in 2.1.0 and have no lag after connect.

# Observed Behavior

Pressing key - 2-4 second delay. Even freezing app ;/

# Debugging Information

- Tested on: OpenEmu Version: 2.1.1 / 2.1.0 (wrong working) and 2.0.9.1 (good working)
- macOS Version: 10.15.1 (19B88)
