I hope to restore the previous node server setup feature, and now the node server will sometimes be slow.
I am in China, and friends around me have encountered this problem.

Using `eth_sign` and then verifying the signature (recovering the address) the recovered address in sometimes wrong.

E.g. Signing the data
`0x68bfc34d28afcb7ae03691816548965dffba6c427c79d15fe6ef548384395fb0`
with the address
`0xe3aAd2d4f9545D3cE53Bb5cd9Ca929a9f7995837`
the result of TrustWallet is
`0xa20bdcf11c4c689edba3af62c531240c09d365233cc7e8934ad9c8ea7085b37a1f781f59e558e8dc8f46cf56964f373deaf70b61bd2b896b87a49c8b293cc3311b`

Now if we recover the address we get
`0x4d8d9d89b133024249651d9161F52a8c0D9d4e7e`
Why should a enum name be repeated with the system name?  example: Hasher

currencyCode return like "USD", "EUR", and "JPY". [Link](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslocale/1642836-currencycode)
currencySymbol return like "$", "€", and "¥". [Link](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslocale/1642814-currencysymbol)

Currency use USD etc. as rawValue, so it should be currencyCode to initialize Currency.
