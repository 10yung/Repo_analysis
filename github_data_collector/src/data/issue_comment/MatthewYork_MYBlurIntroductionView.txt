My app needs to behave differently when the tutorial is being displayed. Is there a `Bool` property that I can check to know whether the tutorial is on or not?

i want to add dynamically panels, please help me

This is a great control. I have different background images on each panel. Is there a way to set text attributes for individual panels? Thanks!!

When support auto layout?

You should transform :
const static CGFloat kTopPadding = 30;
const static CGFloat kLeftRightMargins = 20;
const static CGFloat kBottomPadding = 48;
const static CGFloat kHeaderTitlePadding = 20;
const static CGFloat kTitleDescriptionPadding = 20;
const static CGFloat kDescriptionImagePadding = 20;

in public properties initialized with default values.

`sizeWithFont:constrainedToSize:lineBreakMode: is deprecated.

`skipStringWidth = [skipString sizeWithFont:kSkipButtonFont constrainedToSize:CGSizeMake(MAXFLOAT, MAXFLOAT) lineBreakMode:NSLineBreakByWordWrapping].width;`

Use boundingRectWithSize:options:attributes:context:

Any ideas?  I'm new to coding.  Thank you!

i have tried various way to check weather my app is getting UIImage or not, But there is some issue with ios 8.3 only, other version its running fine. kindly guide  me

thank in advance. 

-As it was before, if we set-up an MYBlurIntroductionView with a frame that was smaller then the screen size, then the background image set for the BlurIntroView would show outside the defined bounds. By setting clipsToBounds property, we can now avoid this issue.

I saw your note on Apple rejecting due to using toolbar implementation.  UIVisualEffectView with BlurEffect is the trick.
-  Create UIVisualEffectView
-  Set Frame
-  Add as subview
