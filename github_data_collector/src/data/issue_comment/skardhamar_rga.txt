I have a script that runs automatically on a server every day. Unfortunately, any time that server gets rebooted the script crashes because there's no one there to paste in the authentication code. I've used other packages in the past that have some kind of oauth_token$refresh() function. Any way to do that with this package?
I am trying to automate the date conversion of different columns in a table
here is what my table looks like
 DAsset1 PAsset1 DAsset2 PAsset2 DAsset3 PAsset3
1   38721   95.53   38812 1734.55   38812 1123.60
2   38722   93.55   38814 1705.95   38814 1093.50
3   38723   94.33   38817 1695.60   38817 1202.85
4   38726   94.70   38819 1699.75   38819 1197.65
5   38727   94.78   38820 1701.85   38820 1193.50
6   38729   90.55   38824 1624.50   38824 1217.55

So i want to change date format for DAsset1,DAsset2,DAsset3
in the following way

for(i in 1:n)
{
  if(i %% 2!=0)
  {
    Data[i]=as.Date(paste0("Data$DAsset",i),origin="1899-12-29",format=)
    Data[i]
    next
  }
}

But i am getting this error
Error in as.Date.default(Data[f]) :    do not know how to convert 'Data[f]' to class “Date”

I am working on generating report with R Sweave. When I try to fetch data from google reporting api `rga.open(instance="ga")`, error occurs `(chunk 1) object 'redirect.uri' not found`. I have been using rga under R and base RStudio environment with no problems. Does anyone know how to solve this issue under R Sweave environment?
When I go to authorise the RGA package with my user credentials, it pushes a pop up which once I click my account and details redirects back to local host and wont allow me to actually authorise the tool.
I believe this is because im running this tool on a server rather than local, but previouslly it would give me a link to copy into the URL rather than the pop up which seemed to work as wouldnt redirect to local host then? Any ideas on how I could push this behaviour instead?
Thanks
There is already a package on CRAN called RGA: 

https://cran.r-project.org/package=RGA

Having one called `rga` is therefore unlikely to be accepted, and even if it was it would be incredibly confusing!

In fact I think it's already confusing since if you google "rga package" this one is listed first, but this isn't the CRAN one.

Hi,

When trying to import the following data in R, R returns a table with the Handle User column missing.

`Sessions.by.user.by.month <- ga$getData(id, batch=TRUE, metrics = "ga:Sessions",
dimensions = "ga:Handle User, ga:Date")`

Is RGA able to import dimensions whose titles contain an interval?
Customised dimensions' names can be easily changed, but I may encounter difficulties with the standard ones i.e. event label.

Thank you in advance.

I keep getting this error code

Hi,

I am trying to install your package, however when I get to the part where I need to run the following lines:

```
install_github("rga", "skardhamar")
    library(rga)
```

I get this error:

```

Any ideas how I can fix this? Thanks.

When `walk = TRUE` and `batch = TRUE` are both used, and the daily results exceed 10,000 rows, the bulk operation incorrectly only retrieves the first 10,000 rows.

This appears to have been reported in various forms in the past: #21, #46, and #61. 

I believe I have fixed this issue in this branch of my local fork: https://github.com/tedconf/rga/tree/fix-batch

I've tested it on my end, and it looks good. But, before I submit a PR, I'd appreciate some additional testing from those who've also encountered this issue. 

In addition the batch fix, that branch also contains:
- Default to HIGHER_PRECISION data sampling - making results deterministic (the 'DEFAULT' setting is not)
- Update link to API v3 docs for max results size, correct syntax of error message
- Modify logic to to allow 'max' to be adjusted when 'batch' is specified (fixes issue of 'batch' option not working correctly with 'walk' option)
- Add 'walk' and 'batch' context to status messages
- Sync with mcf.R with core.R, where applicable
- Misc bug fixes
