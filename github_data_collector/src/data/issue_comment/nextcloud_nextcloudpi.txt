The default configuration of NCP with modsecurity seems to have an issue when handling vcard files.

Setup: current docker instance of NCP with modsecurity enabled, latest updates

Steps to reproduce:
1.  create new contact
2.  save contact (successful)
3. change contact data
4. request error 500 on saving the contact
5. data is lost after site refresh

Steps 3-5 are successfull with disabled modsecurity.

Solution:
- create exception for addressbooksync

The corresponding logfile/line:
`[Sat Jan 18 17:39:21.463016 2020] [:error] [pid 23201:tid 1817326624] [client xxxxxx] [client xxxxxxx] ModSecurity: XML parser error: XML: Failed parsing document. [hostname "xxxxxxxx"] [uri "/remote.php/dav/addressbooks/users/xxxxxx/xxxxxx/xxxxxx-2DA4-4988-8FC6-xxxxxxxxxx.vcf"] [unique_id "XiNCyZLwCYQ4v2CWduyWOQAAShg"]`
Hey Guys,

thanks for building this awesome projekt!
Will Nextcloud 18.0.0 be available soon?

Hi,
I have noticed that you already use postfix for sending notification emails ( https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/issues/147 ). What about adding full-fledged mail server?

I am a long-time user of Nextcloud (and Owncloud before that). Couple of months ago I have successfully launched an email server (postfix+dovecot+rspamd), FULLY INTEGRATED with Nextcloud. Your email (yourname@yourdomain.com) serves as Nextcloud account. New Nextcloud users automatically get their mailbox. Same login and password for Nextcloud and for email (IMAP and SMTP). You can use webmail in Nextcloud for accessing your mailbox without additional login.

I have followed this excellent tutorial:

https://123qwe.com/

The tutorial is not mine, I am just drawing your attention to it in case you would like to include email server in NextCloudPi. I am on Debian Buster. I have closely followed the tutorial and it works! I would only suggest to use Rainloop app, instead of default Email app. Rainloop has much better UI and does not require additional app "Auto Mail Accounts". As a theme for Rainloop, use https://github.com/LukWebsForge/NextRainCloud .


**Description**  
If the limit for ncp-backup is set to higher values (e.g. 60 in my case), the generation of meta information for all packages (to be shown in the web interface) can take very long (one `tar -I pigz -tf ...` process takes about 5s on my RasPi (for dataless backups) which results in 60 * 5s = 5min delay before the web interface is usable).
This is especially annoying, since no ncp-apps can be run from the web interface during that time.

Instead, it would be nice to cache that information (e.g. in a separate file per archive), so it must only be generated for new backups. Whenever a backup is deleted, the corresponding meta information should also be deleted.

### DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS, USE THE FORUMS

NCP and its extras are explained in the wiki, also make sure to read the articles in ownyourbits explaining NextCloudPi extras before asking. https://ownyourbits.com/category/nextcloudpi/

For asking questions, please use the forums. https://help.nextcloud.com/c/support/appliances-docker-snappy-vm

### PROBLEMS

Please, look at the FAQ before posting a new issue. Also, make sure it has not been asked before. https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/wiki/FAQ

Keep in mind that many problems come from faulty power sources and corrupted SD cards, so make sure this is not the case for you before reporting.

If you are running into problems, make sure to include the output of `sudo ncp-report`
-->

When I try to scan a path using the admin interface that contains a space , e.g. `username/files/dirname with space`, I get the following error: `invalid parameters`.

None of my below attempts worked:
`username/files/dirname with space`
`username/files/dirname\ with\ space`
`"username/files/dirname with space"`
`'username/files/dirname with space'`

Similar to issue #1036

**System information**
NextCloudPi  `1.20.1`
NextCloud `17.0.2.1`
<!-- Paste the output of `sudo ncp-report` -->

Implements #1047

At this point this is a quickly thrown together (untested!) implementation (10min effort :P ).
I'll iron it out in the coming days if Nacho likes the approach.
**Description**  
Actually it is possible to activate the sambe sharing function for all users which are created within the nextcloud instance. I would like to have only sambe release for selected user/users.

**Example**  
Nextcloud User 1
Nextcloud User 2
Nextcloud User 3

After selecting the navigation link I would like to have an selection field for which user/users I would like to aktive the samba sharing function.

Hi,
when executed on rock64, 3 out of 4 processes stop generating previews.

the last 4th process continues to load cpu and apparently yield new previews:
visible in htop as `/bin/bash /usr/local/bin/ncc preview:generate-all -n -v -p /<username>/files/Media/Photos/2019`



btw, in `ncp-report` one should probably consider marking "trusted_domains" also as *sensitive value*

At the moment the backup possibility of BTRFS snapshots is limited to either USB drive **OR** remote machine. To minimize the risk of data loss, I'd like to backup it to a USB drive **AND** a remote machine.

Enhancement for this would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks for the recent support to setup a second domain through ncp-config (#1025). By default if one runs the letsencrypt ncp-script, a `_` is preselected for both domains.

I just changed the first `_` to my desired domain and left the second domain as `_`. I ran into the following error:

**Error message**

<details>
<summary>Cannot issue for "_": Domain name contains an invalid character</summary>

```
