Hi All,

 In this code,   is it compulsory requires a bounding boxes information for test data  or not

please any one  help me on this doubt.

Thanking  in advance.

Hi All,
run.m file gives **\* Subscripted assignment dimension mismatch **\* to run.m file gives **\* Subscripted assignment dimension mismatch **\* error

Hi Ning,

Looks like there is one function missing for the scale_feature. 
Could you provide the file to reproduce the result?
Thanks

How can I reproduce the results for the case when the bounding box is given? Currently it seems that the code only calculates it for the case where bounding box is unknown.

So I found a slight mismatch between the results reported in the paper and the results I obtained running your code (didn't change anything).

If I run the code I get:

```
>> run
Accuracy = 82.0159% (4752/5794)
Accuracy of using oracle part boxes is 82.015878
Accuracy = 72.7304% (4214/5794)
Accuracy of box is 72.730411
Accuracy = 72.9548% (4227/5794)
Accuracy of prior is 72.954781
Accuracy = 73.2309% (4243/5794)
Accuracy of neighbor is 73.230929
```

I assume that these results (except the oracle one) are for the case of "Bounding Box Unknown". These results match the ones reported in [the paper](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~nzhang/papers/eccv14_part.pdf) except for the **neighbor** case.

The accuracy of neighbor is 73.89 in the paper, while 73.23 is reported by the code.

Can you clarify what caused the mismatch?

Thanks in advance

In the readme it says "Change rcnn path in init.m". But in `init.m` file there is no where to set it.
