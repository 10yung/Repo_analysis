With DigitalOcean Teams coming out, the usage of multiple accounts is becoming prevalent. Currently the project is limited to only one digitalaccount. Would like to see if we could also support multiple DO accounts just like how we support AWS.
I have komiser running on an ECS cluster and have provided the following credentials https://github.com/mlabouardy/komiser/blob/master/policy.json on a task role.

On top of that, I also specified the AWS_DEFAULT_REGION env var (eu-west-1).

Everything seems to be working, except the following permission errors:
- iam:GetUser is missing
-  support:DescribeCases is missing
- cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics is missing

They are clearly there in the list, so no idea why I am seeing this error

Hi there,

First off, just wanted to say that my first test of Komiser has been a pleasant surprise... you've developed a really clear/great UI!

Minor issue that I've encountered:

- Log into Komiser
- Left-column: click on Network
- Scroll down to "Cloudfront Incoming Requests"
- Mouse-over to a section on the Cloudfront graph. If there are more than 5 Cloudfront distributions, the list gets truncated:

Is there a way to zoom-in/dive in for a complete list of Cloudfront distributions, and number of requests they've received?

Thanks!

I was trying to run the project locally but only some of the get requests are getting through. Most of the get request are giving status code error 500.

### Description

Use [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) instead of the deprecated Godeps

### Changes proposed 

- Switch to go modules
- Delete vendored files
- Edited CI
- Edited Contributing guide
- Bump go to `1.13`
The instructions in your readme should be wget https://cli.komiser.io/2.4.0/windows/komiser -OutFile Komiser.exe. You need to state the outfile and that's its an exe.
Then it runs fine! 
Hi!

I'd like to ask for [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com) support for your application. I work for IBM and I'm extremely impressed with the work you've done and would love to help/guide whatever to get IBM Cloud support here also.

Never hesitate to reach out at awesome@ibm.com (yes really) directly if i can ever help.

Hi! I made an initial work of an [Helm Chart](https://github.com/spaghettifunk/komiser-helm) for this awesome project ðŸš€. I'd like some help to extend it for supporting other cloud providers because currently it supports only AWS ðŸ˜„ 
Once it's ready we can submit it to the official helm chart incubator.

What do you think?
