Hello,
for monitoring correctly our sphinx status, we would need to generate a sphinx configuration, with double "listen" instruction

listen                 = 127.0.0.1:9312
listen                 = 127.0.0.1:9313:mysql41

We can't find how to set-up our thinking_sphinx.yml to do so :/ 

It seems it isn't possible to add a "listen" instruction.

Is it ? 


I'm guessing it's not intentional that after_commit uses `DeltaCallbacks#suspended?`, whereas before_save was using `ThinkingSphinx::Callbacks.suspended?` ?  I think both should be using the former.
I'm having trouble getting specs that run Thinking Sphinx 3.2.0 to work on CircleCI. The first Sphinx spec passes, and all subsequent specs fail. All Sphinx specs are passing locally.

The app I'm using is running Rails 5.1, Ruby 2.3.1, RSpec 3.8.

My Sphinx support file for RSpec looks like this: 

```
module SphinxHelpers
  def index
    ThinkingSphinx::Test.index
    # Wait for Sphinx to finish loading in the new index files.
    sleep 0.25 until index_finished?
  end

  def index_finished?
    Dir[Rails.root.join(ThinkingSphinx::Test.config.indices_location, '*.{new,tmp}*')].empty?
  end
end

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include SphinxHelpers, type: :feature

  config.before(:suite) do
    # Ensure sphinx directories exist for the test environment
    ThinkingSphinx::Test.init
    # Configure and start Sphinx, and automatically
    # stop Sphinx at the end of the test suite.
    ThinkingSphinx::Test.start_with_autostop
    ThinkingSphinx::Deltas.suspend!
  end

  config.after(:suite) do
    ThinkingSphinx::Test.stop
    ThinkingSphinx::Deltas.resume!
  end
end

```

Instead of a `before(:each)` setting for acceptance specs, I'm calling `index` in a `before` block on the specs where `sphinx: true`. 

Example: 

```
describe 'Product Search', type: :feature, sphinx: true do
  before { index }

  describe 'Product search from /products' do
    before(:each) do
      visit '/products'
      click_link 'Filter'
    end

    it 'finds all the products when no filters are selected', js: true do
      click_button 'Run Filters'
      expect(page).to have_content('2 products found for: All Products')
    end
  end
end
```

My current CircleCI config installs `sphinxsearch`:
```
      - run:
          name: Install sphinx dependencies
          command: sudo apt-get install sphinxsearch
```

And runs the tests through this command: 
```
      - run:
          name: run tests
          command: |
            mkdir /tmp/test-results
            TEST_FILES="$(circleci tests glob "spec/**/*_spec.rb" | circleci tests split --split-by=timings)"

            bundle exec rspec --format progress $TEST_FILES
```

Are there any additional steps that need to be taken to get Thinking Sphinx to run on CircleCI?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
When running a rebuild in no-detach mode, the task `ts:rt:index` is not executed.

For example:

```bash
> /usr/bin/bundle.ruby2.5 exec rails ts:rebuild NODETACH=true
searchd is not currently running.

There are no problems in detached mode:

I would like that the rebuild task also generates the real time index files.
I just updated to Sphinx 3.1.1 and latest version of Thinking Sphinx

I've deleted all the indexes from the old 2.2.11 version, then did rake ts:configure, rebuild 
I get a bag of errors

Alongside this once its up and running I get

I have lots more errors

And of course nothing seems to work at all. 

The indexing seems waaaay faster than the v2 of Sphinx, so I am have no real idea if this is working. 

Anyone else found this issue or have an idea what to do?
