It's working with animation like example for me, I think segue didn't given properly in my project.
how to give showmen segue to menu view controller?
It's time for pull requests! Happy hacktoberfest!
I have added the menu through this code. in the menu view, I have one button to navigate to a second view controller. when I dismiss the second view controller menu dismiss icon is not visible in the menu view controller. Kindly help with this.
when menu button is pushed and menu drops it took 1-2 sec to being activated and everything moves down about 20-30 pixels after that
When i press the bar button to open the menu view, the same button when pressed is very small. I just can't make the tab button bar button bigger.

After that animation is finished in the two modes : Presentation & Dismissal , the UI doesn't respond :
- you can not select anything ..for example for the demo application you can not neither select the menu button nor scrolling the tableView.
