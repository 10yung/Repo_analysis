Hi This is related to the issue on the main github neuron-team/vscode-ipe#180 (comment)

I have install this fork and still cannot open the out panel
After I initiate the output panel, I can see the log stating the package is trying to "Starting a Jupiter Kernel at location /anaconda3/bin"

and it will say "Erro could not start: Jupyter could not be executed automatically"

I am on MacOs, Version 1.33.1 (1.33.1) and latest version of this fork

I am quite new to vs code, if you need more information, please tell me how i can get the system log for you. Thanks for looking into it.

sorry for duplicate comment/post for the same issue
Hi!
I switched from main branch to this beta version trying to solve 500 Internal Server Error when trying to run notebooks on a Jupyter server started from a Conda env.
While it seems to be able to start the server (even though I am not sure how to check that) VSNotebooksBeta keeps throwing this server error even for a 1-line notebook saying:

```python
import numpy as np
```

What can be the cause of it? Am I doing something wrong?
Is it odd that even after installing the beta version, I still experience same moduleNotFound error when I try to import a module that is in the custom environment.

Importing the module in the terminal after activating the environment works, but it doesn't for VSNotebooks Beta :cry: 
Wanted to open a thread for ideas for notebook innovation. I am working on a blog post to detail my ideas around a graph based notebook, it should be published within the next 2 weeks!
considering 2 python files under the same directory:

file1.py:

```
def fn():
    print("called")
```

file2.py:

```
# %%
import file1

file1.fn()
```

file2.py can be successfully executed by python interpreter, but if you execute the cell using VSNotebook you'll get an error:

> ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'file1'

This bug may be caused by the fact that the temporary jupyter notebook file is created under a temporary directory (unlike the one used by real jupyter which is permanent), and cannot find other python files in workspace.
Hi.
Most of my coding with Python is in a remote Jupyter Notebooks. I would like to execute code there.
In example, I would paste a link to running Jupyter Notebook session and when I execute code in VS Code - it passes it there.
I find that when I run same code segment twice, the results will be stored in new cell. Is it possible to add option to act like jupyter-notebook, that all output from running same cell will remain in same cell?
Same as issue 163 in  VSNotebook repo, request for jupyter plugin like experience. Very important feature 
I would love to add variable exploration to this extension. If you have some ideas on how you would like to see this implemented, please add a comment to this issue!
Fixes #13 

WIP, needs to be merged after #10
