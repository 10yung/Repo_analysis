dockerfile with arm64v8 arch
``` 
FROM arm64v8/alpine 
RUN addgroup -S  simon 
```
failed! error mesage:
```
standard_init_linux.go:190: exec user process caused "exec format error"
The command '/bin/sh -c addgroup -S simon' returned a non-zero code: 1
```

But if I run command in arm64v8 container
```
docker exec -it  arm64v8/alpine:latest /bin/sh
/ # addgroup -S  simon
/ # cat /etc/group |grep simon
simon:x:101:

And also if I use x86 64 as base image,  everything is ok
```

I met a problem that apk not found when I make alpine image on mips platform, and the error is below. 
I cannot find the apk source code, please give me a URL.

I don't know if this is a bug but today I got a weird result that can be easily reproduced.

I created a container with `--cap-drop=ALL` with the image 10.16.3-alpine.
Soon after I accessed the container terminal with the command:
 `docker exec -ti CONTAINER_ID / bin/sh` and I used a basic command:
`ping www.google.com`
I got the result
`ping: permission denied (are you root?)`
out of curiosity I tried
`ping www.google.com && yes` or `ping www.google.com; yes`
I received an absurd flood of the letter Y without stopping on my console. I had to restart my machine to get out of the infinite loop.

I believe that if this has no connection to the alpine image or cannot be resolved, I think the phrase (are you root?) Should be removed.

then i realized i can't even add pip or pip2

I can't manage to have a working fail2ban in `nginx:1.17.1-alpine` and I can't figure out which way to look for. Here is the relevant section of my Dockerfile:
```
RUN apk update && apk add certbot certbot-nginx rsyslog fail2ban
```
# Hypothesis 1: fail2ban does not run because of a system initialization error

There's no fail2ban in `/etc/init.d/` so I believe `fail2ban-client status` when it says that it:
```
Failed to access socket path: /var/run/fail2ban/fail2ban.sock. Is fail2ban running?
```
I tried to install `openrc` to start fail2ban manually but I am getting an even more puzzling behavior (though fail2ban now appears in `/etc/init.d/`): 
```
/usr/src/nginx # rc-service fail2ban status
 * You are attempting to run an openrc service on a
 * system which openrc did not boot.
 * You may be inside a chroot or you may have used
 * another initialization system to boot this system.
 * In this situation, you will get unpredictable results!
 * If you really want to do this, issue the following command:
 * touch /run/openrc/softlevel
```
I can't quite make sense of this message, for fail2ban appears in `/etc/init.d/` IFF openrc runs in this container. If openrc did not start this service, who did? I then tried the following: 
```
rc-update add fail2ban
rc-service fail2ban restart
 * WARNING: fail2ban is already starting
```
Does that mean that something else tries to start fail2ban not matter the presence of openrc. Is fail2ban visible in `/etc/init.d/` merely a by-product of the latter?

# Hypothesis nÂ°2 fail2ban does not start because some logs to parse do not exist

From what I read [here](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/issues/2204) fail2ban does not start when it cannot find the relevant log files for the different services. I tried to remove `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alpine-ssh.conf` alongside `/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf` in my **entrypoint.sh** to add only my own jail parsing `/var/log/nginx/access.log`. 

Some insights would help me figure out what I am doing (conceiving) wrongly
