when we click at index, we need use the right type, like NSUInteger.

In drawrect method, it will call -addBackgroundAndBorderLayerWithRect. but the sublayer in self.layer never be removed. if we switch the page a few times, self.layer will have too many sublayers.
To handle touch common segment, it is need to add a condition.
`if (segment != self.selectedSegmentIndex && segment < sectionsCount) {
            // Check if we have to do anything with the touch event
            if (self.isTouchEnabled)
                [self setSelectedSegmentIndex:segment animated:self.shouldAnimateUserSelection notify:YES];
        }else {
            //Handle the index not changed
            if (self.indexChangeBlock) {
                self.indexChangeBlock(segment, NO);
            }
        }`
and use the origin indexChangeBock to add a parameter to judge if the index is changed:
`typedef void (^IndexChangeBlock)(NSUInteger index, BOOL isChange)`
With minimal changes, it is easier for users to handle different events，I sincerely hope that the owner can adopt this submission to make it more convenient for developers
Khmer text is getting clipped. 
I tried changing the segment control frame size, but it doesn't help.
I see you have some attribute options like `kCTGlyphInfoAttributeName`, but I can't figure out which one to use or how to use it. Could you help ?

I have added HMSegmentedControl in my app. But sometimes its crashing with error (reported with Crashlytics):
** -[__NSArray0 objectAtIndex:]: index 0 beyond bounds for empty NSArray
-[HMSegmentedControl frameForSelectionIndicator]

Please look into this issue
Swift 4 
Do HMSegmentedControl support users dragging the view to change selected index ? 
HMSegmentedControl works fine except I cannot drag / swipe to change selected index
