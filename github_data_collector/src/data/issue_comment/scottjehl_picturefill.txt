Hi, what is the current status of this project? Is it still actively maintained?
Adding just picturefill doesn't seem to work for my case. I'm using picturefill with react and Gatsbyjs.
I see that using pf.mutations should make it work. 
If I include this file in my site though I get an error in IE

`Unhandled promise rejection TypeError: Assignment to read-only properties is not allowed in strict mode`

Is there something else I need to do to make it work in IE11?
Images in chrome are not loading ONLY when I emulate a mobile device(all devices). Images seems to load fine when i resize the browser and visit the site from real mobile devices.

Noticed this issue only happening in chrome. Seems to work fine with emulated devices in both firefox and IE edge

This is caused because of the images are downloaded as .jp2 extension even when the image from the server is sending as .jpg. Out of all 12 images on my site only 2 images load with .jpg and rest with .jp2

here is the code:
`<source srcset="<?=$data['large_image']?>" media="(min-width: 767px)">
<img class="img-responsive" srcset="<?=$data['small_image']?>" style="width:100%">
`

What is causing the images to load with .jp2? and how do i fix this issue?

Thanks
Hello, I am really struggling to get this to work.

Here is how I import the script:
`import picturefill from 'picturefill'`


Here is my html:
```
<picture>
        <!--[if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif]-->
        <source srcset="/static/guy.webp" media="(min-width: 800px)" type="image/webp">
        <source srcset="/static/guy.png" media="(min-width: 800px)">
        <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]-->
        <img srcset="/static/guy.png" alt="image desc">
</picture>
```

And since I am using vue.js in the ,,mounted" (its being executed when the DOM is rendered) method i have the following:
```
mounted()  {
   picturefill()
},
```

And here is the full error which I am getting:
```
Failed parsing 'srcset' attribute value since it has an unknown descriptor.
Dropped srcset candidate "/static/guy.webp"
```


Any ideas what I am doing wrong?

Thanks!

Hi,

I am using NextJS (react ssr) and tried to use your package.
There is an issue when trying to use it as it uses the window object.

How can I make it work in SSR?

Thanks!
http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/ seems to be two years old,the page says 

> Unfortunately, adding a src attribute with an external source to the img element in your picture element isn't a good workaround either, as any browser that exists today will fetch that src url even if it is not going to be used

Is it still the case ?
Hey, I noticed that picturefill gets 23M hits per month on jsDelivr, so I thought you might like this badge.
I set up picture fill example this way:

    `<picture>
    <!--[if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif]-->
    <source srcset="../resources/text-cloud2.png" media="(max-width: 768px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)">
    <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]-->
    <img srcset="../resources/beetle-22.jpg" alt="Some alt text">
    </picture>`

The img is loading (beetle), even when browser size is below the 768 css width & on retina desktop.
Why wouldn't the source image (text-cloud) be used?
Hi,

Some of the images included with the source of this project contain embedded ICC profiles which are copyright-protected and lack a Free license.

Specifically, these images are currently not legally free to redistribute:

 examples/images/art-large.jpg
 examples/images/art-medium.jpg
 examples/images/art-small.jpg
 examples/images/extralarge.jpg
 examples/images/extralarge.psd
 examples/images/image-384.psd
 examples/images/image-768.psd
 examples/images/large.psd
 examples/images/medium.jpg
 examples/images/medium.psd
 examples/images/small.jpg
 examples/images/small.psd
 logos/bocoup-lg.png
 logos/ricg-seal.png

 examples/images/pic-large.png
 examples/images/pic-medium.png
 examples/images/pic-small.png

 logos/bocoup-sm.png

The first group above contains an ICC profile owned by Hewlett Packard, and the latter two groups contain ICC profiles owned by Apple.

Most likely (I didn't check more detailed) those ICC profiles are all sRGB profiles which can simply be stripped, since for web use sRGB is the default color profile.

One way to inspect image files for embedded ICC profiles and its metadata is by use of the commandline tool exiftool, installed as part of the Perl distribution Image::ExifTool - i.e. on Debian-based systems by installing the package libimage-exiftool-perl, and on (Debian and) other systems by running "cpanm Image::ExifTool".
I am attempting a patch to enable FLIF support ...
```
<picture>
<source type="image/flif"
```
when I detect the FLIF type and a supported browser, I bail out of picturefill and instantiate PolyFLIF ( https://uprootlabs.github.io/poly-flif )

It's a work in progress ( still not perfect )
do you think my patch may end up in the official repo ?

FLIF has its own single-file multi-resolution responsive approach
