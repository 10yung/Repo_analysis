I was planning on reorganizing notebook names. Mostly removing spaces and maybe even the numbering. The spaces on file names are problematic and there is really no ordering in chapter reading (save for one or two exceptions).

@vincentdavis if you are not OK with this, please say...

The code seems windows dependent. Also lacks example files

The "Substitution Matrices" section of the cookbook should be merged or combimed with chapter 21 Advanced which covers Substitution Matrices. 

Show an example with the new Post vs Get with long URLs

From Biopython news

The Bio.Entrez interface will automatically use an HTTP POST rather than HTTP GET if the URL would exceed 1000 characters. This is based on NCBI guidelines and the fact that very long queries like complex searches can otherwise trigger an HTTP Error 414 Request URI too long.
