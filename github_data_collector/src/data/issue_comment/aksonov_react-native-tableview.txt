Hello, I'm trying to implement custom cells and am unable to change the cell heights. In the documentation you mention being able to manipulate cell heights, but I am not seeing a way to do that. The cells are always the same narrow height of the basic table cell. Help would be much appreciated
Hi.

On iOS 13, the whole table background color is white in dark mode and I can't seem to be able to change it:

When I press on each item, it seems the pressed color and text colors are correct:

Is there anyway to fix this behavior?
Hi,

This issue is not related to 'react-native-tableview'.  
We are creating a new private component library for our organization. 
I tried the following:
1. Component library itself as a separate project with react and react-native as peer dependencies in my project.
2. But having just the components code in component library is not useful because we have to add new code or fixes and we have to run the story book(Because of peer dependencies could not be able run story book).

Could you please help me with the model I have to follow for creating a react native library?

Thank you in advance.
- Added support for edit and custom edit button title on editing(swipe) of TableView item.
Code for reproduction is here: https://github.com/henrikra/react-native-tableview/blob/append-items-bug/example/src/screens/Example9.js

## What I would like to achieve
I would like to achieve that always when I add new items to the end of the list the list will scroll to the bottom. 

## What works ðŸ’š 

I can achieve that when using `Item` from this library.

## What doesn't work ðŸ”´ 

When I use exactly the same code except I use `Cell` instead of `Item` it will flash and also start from the top again and also it does not animate to the bottom.

## Conclusion

Looks like bug to me ðŸ˜¢ I would really hope this will get fixed because `Item` is too limited for me. I have to style the component. I can help also to resolve this issue if you guys point me to right place to look.

If this is not fixable do you have other suggestions on these kind of React Native iOS libraries?
Hi, I added handlers for reorder events, so now we can use reorderable TableView inside ScrollView!

P.S. Month passed from [my previous PR](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-tableview/pull/185), it would be great if you test and approve it too :)
@iRoachie Are you interested in the option to support rounded corners on the sections? I've got it to work for me but would like to know if this is something you want in this library before creating a PR.

I use RNTableView with custom cellï¼Œcell have touch-events tooï¼Œwhen I tap --> hold --> scroll --> release 
,it performance as expect , then when i quickly drag it and release immediately, it will call tap action. I find that, when single tap or drag and release, the behavior of RCTTouchHandler are the same touchBegan, touchMoveï¼ˆsometimes donâ€˜t callï¼‰, touchEndï¼Œin almost 0.05s. JS can not distinguish these two gesture. 

I tried calculate time, it doesn't work because these two cost almost same time; 
I tried to override shouldRequireFailureOfGestureRecognizer method in RCTTouchHandler, but I cannot     prevent the touchEnd event;

I look up iOS system UIScrollView, find out that system have a gesture called UIScrollViewDelayedTouchesBeganGestureRecognizer when this called, other gesture will be cancelled. Also I find docs in RCTScrollView, "For React scroll
 views, we want the default to be the same behavior as `UIControl`s",  so i'm so confused and looking forward for some help, please give me some advise, thanks a lot.
Is there a way to change an individual `<Item>`'s color without changing the color of the whole table?

`textColor` sets the color of the `TableView`, and using `<Item style={{color: "red"}}>` doesnt seem to work. I am looking to add a "destructive" button which is red and used to logout
Now animation hard-coded to false

Can you add property to change it?
