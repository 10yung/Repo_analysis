Hello. I use a WMS desktop application written in WindowsForms in my company. I would like to automatize entire order processing which takes place in this application. But I encountered a serious problem with UIRecorder. UIRecorder does not always display elements of list. I attached appropriate screens where you can see that there are two elements in a list but UIRecorder shows nothing. Could you tell me if it is a bug of WinAppDriver or application is written wrong? Thanks in advance for help

We have a problem with set text for Environment.newLine or "\r\n"
When sending "\r\n" Winappdrivers sets 2 lines instead of one line 
Set Text: "Hello guest\r\nwelcome to WinAppDriver"
Expected Text value "Hello guest\r\nwelcome to WinAppDriver"
Actual Text value "Hello guest\r\n\r\nwelcome to WinAppDriver"

But When we send \n only it works as expected
Set Text: "Hello guest\nwelcome to WinAppDriver"
Expected Text value "Hello guest\r\nwelcome to WinAppDriver"
Actual Text value "Hello guest\r\nwelcome to WinAppDriver"

What's the best way to set newline("\r\n") and new_paragraph("\r\n\r\n") using winappdriver?
When using FindElementsByXpath,the elements are not being returned,It returns null.
However,when used FindElementByXpath,the first element found is being returned.
Good evening!  

I've read some of the  posted questions regarding using some of the patterns with WinAppDriver and Selenium.  I was able to use the Toggle.ToggleSettings with the GetAttribute method but I was still unsure if it's possible to get the value of the ValuePattern pattern.

Here's the reason why I want to get the value of the ValuePattern.  I entered text into a control and the Text method in Selenium won't return the sting value I entered so I can validate the text value.  I was able to get text from other controls using the .Text method in Selenium (I'm using WinAppDriver with Selenium and C#).  The control type is a DataItem so I'm not sure if that plays a role in the way I can retrieve text from the control.

Is it possible to get that ValuePattern value through the GetAttribute method in Selenium or would I have to go through the System.Windows.Automation namespace?  I'm extremely new to windows automation so please be gentle.  lol.
Hello guys,
I'm using the winAppDriver to run my automation,using the latest stable version.
I'm facing one problem really weird, sometimes the TC fail with the following message:

"System.InvalidOperationException : Currently selected window has been closed"

What I do is:
Find one element, clear it, send a new value, send Key.Enter, get the window_handles and click in another button.
This TC work most of the time (95%+) but in some execution the windows just disappear (as you can see in the log bellow)

Any clue how can we handle this properly?
Right now I have marked this one as floky and have a retry logic on it, so no more problem but this seems to me as a issue in WinAppDriver itself.

very last log of WinAppDriver:

I want to expand the tree node. Not sure how can I do that using winappdriver. 
https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppDriver/blob/d7756298aab5863e03a23ebc684a58cc51720572/Tools/UIRecorder/UIXPathLib/UiTreeWalk.cpp#L218

Looks like it should be 
if (cid >= UIA_ButtonControlTypeId && cid <= UIA_AppBarControlTypeId)
Hello,

I want to send Keys to a textbox inside a combobox.
Problem is the combobox and descendant elements have the same Automation Id.
`Inspect` tool looks like this:
![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19973150/72065902-95c47f00-32df-11ea-8619-b42778001352.png)
[This is part of the 'Open File Dialog' from Windows 10 which my program uses]
All three elements (pane, combo box and edit) have the Automation Id "1148"
I want to address the third one directly to send the .Clear() command before sending new Keys.
So what i came up with:
`parentElement.FindElementByAccessibilityId("1148").FindElementByAccessibilityId("1148").FindElementByAccessibilityIdntByName("1148");`
Sadly this is not working. 
`parentElement.FindElementByAccessibilityId("1148")`
returns the exact same element as 
`parentElement.FindElementByAccessibilityId("1148").FindElementByAccessibilityId("1148").[...]`

The issue is why can i find the element itself when searching for descendants?

Hello,

when I'm using Visual Studio to test my app. When I run the test the app start in background and the test fail.

When i start the Test in Debug mode everything works fine. Window opens focused and in front. Clicks hit right buttons etc. Is this a problem with WinAppDriver or VS?

I found somebody else having the same issue here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55899601/vs2019-test-explorer-missclicks-due-to-wrong-focus
