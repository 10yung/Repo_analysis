When compiling with certain versions of GCC and Matlab, a lot of warnings come up regarding redefinitions of constants in cmath, math.h, or math.hh.

It compiles and runs fine, but it's annoying.

The candidates score at the output is the one obtained by the random forest regressor, not the one after the max margin is applied. This way, the proposals are not sorted by the available score, and this can be misleading.

We should save both scores to avoid any confusion.

Very big images (bigger than full HD) make the code crash. Not sure if it's the contour detector though, I should do a performance evaluation with respect to the size of the image, and individualized at each main part of the code.
