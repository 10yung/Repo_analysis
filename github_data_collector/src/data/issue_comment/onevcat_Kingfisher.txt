### Issue Description

I've encountered this problem when the app was running in the background, and this issue was reported from users in crashlytics.

#### Reproduce

```
Kingfisher                     0x101de3760 specialized Kingfisher<A>.decoded(scale:) + 751 (Image.swift:751)
Kingfisher                     0x101de81e8 closure #1 in closure #3 in ImageCache.retrieveImage(forKey:options:completionHandler:) + 724 (Image.swift:724)
Kingfisher                     0x101de56a4 thunk for @escaping @callee_guaranteed () -> () + 4392113828 (<compiler-generated>:4392113828)
```

This exception occurs inside `processImage (604) ImageDownloader.swift` and crashed in Kingfisher<A>.decoded(scale:) + 751 with attempt unwrap nil value (makeImage from CGContext returns nil)
Unfortunately, I can't provide you with the URL. because it stores on the local device.

It would be nice if the JPEG compression quality could be parametric.

I'd be happy to fix this issue, but I'm not sure where's the best place to add the parameter.
Hi everyone,

Kingfisher is an awesome library, but I can't seem to implement the following:

In order to resolve a slow/jittery UICollectionView on initial scrolling, I checked out Time Profiler and I believe the jitter comes from UIImageView.kf.setImage() which would make sense. I am already using the kingfisher prefetch method with .cacheMemoryOnly to prefetch the images used in the cells of my collectionview long before actually reaching the view where the uicollectionview resides. Then when I populate the cells I use UIImageView.kf.setImage() with the .fromMemoryCacheOrRefresh option, since I believe the lag is caused because it is loading the image from Disk and not fro Memory. 

However! when I print out the value.cacheType in the setImage completionHandler, the first results are "none" not "memory" as expected. It is only after scrolling up and down a couple of times that the cache type indeed becomes "memory". 

So my question is the folloying: 
- am I correct in assuming that loading my cell's images from memory instead of disk will improve performance of my UICollectionView?
- if so how can I force KingFisher to not use Disk or Network-fetching, but simply prefetch all the images in memory and load them from memory when the time comes. I simply cannot find the correct settings to achieve this behaviour.

Thank you!

### Issue Description

#### What

First of all I would like to thank you for your work on this awesome library! Thank you for open-sourcing it and for your continuous contribution. üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I have started experiencing issues when setting a fade transition for the images that I display inside a `UICollectionView` cell. Basically, I see 2 different issues:

1. Whenever I set the options to `[.transition(.fade(0.2))]`, the fade transition is visible, but there is a glitch. A millisecond before the fade in kicks in, a tiny version of the image that is about to fade in is displayed in the top left corner of the `UIImageView`, and it is on top of the placeholder (if set). This is the code that leads to this behavior: 

```swift
imageView.kf.setImage(
      with: profilePictureUrl,
      placeholder: UIImage(named: "placeholder"),
      options: [.transition(.fade(0.2))]
)
```

2. If I apply multiple options that also include a `DownsamplingImageProcessor` and a transition, the fade in never happens. This is the the options part of the code that I am using (as seen in the Cheat Sheet):

```swift
[
      .processor(DownsamplingImageProcessor(size: imageSize)),
      .scaleFactor(UIScreen.main.scale),
      .cacheOriginalImage,     
      .transition(.fade(0.2))
]
```

I don't believe I have experienced these issues in the past, and I am not 100% sure about the version that introduced this for me, but I can say that it's been like this since `v.5.7.0`, including the latest one `v.5.9.0`.

#### Reproduce

This should be reproducible with the code samples that I added above.

#### Other Comment

Please let me know if you need any additional info, I would be more than happy to help. Thanks in advance!

Cheers!

use this code to set image

`cell.imageView.kf.setImage(with: URL.init(string: icon))`

but imageView show image just before setted  when i set image like below:

` cell.imageView.image = uiimage(named: string)`

` cell.imageView.image = nil`

by the way, this happened a few times.

what should i do to clean image when the cell reused?
HelloÔºå
    When I turn off the network, then turn on the network, the pictures still can't be downloaded for a short time.
    Does anyone have the same problemÔºü

This is just a reminder that the issue described in #809 still persists and since it was closed I thought I ping it and give some extra information.

The problem about the URLRequest timeout
> Task <937CEFC3-1CFF-41BA-BD64-B00160F3EFC6>.<460> finished with error - code: -1001

happens in my macOS program where I have a basic tableview which shows a thumbnail for every entry which I load via Kingfisher from a server. After a certain amount of fine (and fast) loads the displaying of new images just stops and after the timeout expires (no matter how long I set it) the above error code is logged for each new image (no Kingfisher completion handler error btw). It at that point can only show the already loaded and cached entries.

The error code indicates a timeout on the request, but if I load the URL manually in a browser it loads fine in a few milliseconds and when I restart the app and start loading from where it stopped last time all images load fine until the next error arises. So I don't think it is a server issue.

The debugging is hard for me because as soon as I get to the point where the URLRequest is made in Kingfisher the timeout is in effect and after that time the debugger crashes on me.

Oddly enough, the "fix" commented in #809 with setting the activity indicator on the imageview only seems to push this threshold after which loading fails again a little bit further back (without after ca. 100 images; and with after ca. 250 images).

Note: The images are fairly large (around 4k) since thumbnails do not exist but I don't think that that is the key issue, maybe just causes the error to appear sooner.
Hello,
I have checked many issue regarding this with ref. https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/483 and https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/873

But I am not getting any solution for this.
Some Cell are resize correctly after I scroll, also if image is too small then it should be aspect fit to width & height will be scale automaticallly.

Also cell are not resize with `setNeedsLayout` or `layoutIfNeede` function.

Thank you,
