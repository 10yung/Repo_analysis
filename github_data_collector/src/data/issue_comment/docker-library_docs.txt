Is this change acceptable?
I received many requests to add a link to my [`install-php-extensions`](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer) script, many people find it very useful...
Per [some feedback from Holger](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2020-January/001779.html), I took the opportunity to rewrite/rephrase some of this to try and make it more clear how to reproduce the Debian tarballs with the `debuerreotype` tool, specifically around where to look to get the information required (timestamp, etc) to do so.

cc @h01ger (and fyi @paultag) would you be willing to take a look at this and see if I've done a better job? :innocent:
(I'd love to improve it further if you've got more feedback! :heart:)

Also, feel free to circulate this PR (or ask me to do so) on that r-b.o list if you think there'd be value in doing so, since I'd love to get more feedback on this! :+1:
The default for `CARGO_HOME` is `$HOME_DIR/.cargo`, but that isn't mounted, so it is discarded after every build. This moves `CARGO_HOME` to `/usr/src/myapp/.cargo` within the container, or `$PWD/.cargo` on the host.
