You use `switchMap` for all your side effects, so e.g. if you consider an `UpdateSideEffect` that triggers e.g. 3 actions and we want those actions to *always* be executed after each update, we need to use `flatMap` instead like following:

     fun UpdateSideEffect(companion: Companion, clazz: Class<Action>): SideEffect<State, Action> = { actions, state ->
        actions
                .ofType(clazz)
                // flatMap, because we never want to "lose" any side effect action!
                .flatMap {
                   
                    Observable.just(item)
                            .flatMap {
                                Observable.fromArray(
									Action1,
									Action2,
									Action3
								)
                            }
                }
    }

If we call e.g. 3 update actions, we will only get the side effects of the last action (if we use `switchMap`), but we will get all side effect actions if we use `flatMap` like in my example. Of course, if order of side effect actions is important we could also use `concatMap` as well...

**Question**
I'm unsure why you don't use `flatMap` by default, is there any particular reason for that? Or is there something speaking against using `flatMap` at this position instead at all?

Bumps `versions.dagger` from 2.24 to 2.25.2.

Updates `dagger` from 2.24 to 2.25.2
<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [dagger's releases](https://github.com/google/dagger/releases).*

> ## Dagger 2.25.2
> Known breaking changes
> ===================
> 
>    * The Kotlin change in `2.ii` (below) will break users who were passing in object module
>       instances into a Component builder method rather than using `@JvmStatic`. 
>       To fix this issue, remove the call to the builder method -- the module instance is
>       no longer needed and the Component builder method will no longer be generated.
> 
> What's new
> =========
> 
> 1. **Bug fixes**
>     1. Fix duplicate missing binding error messages. (2411074e)
>     2. Fix dagger-spi pom file from dependency cycle. (3699697c)
>     3. Fix issue with missing shaded deps from [release 2.25](https://github.com/google/dagger/releases/tag/dagger-2.25) (efe1b00a)
> 
> 2. **Kotlin support**
>     1. Qualifier annotations on fields can now be understood without
>       The need for `@field:MyQualifier` (646e0336)
>     2. `@Module object` classes no longer need `@JvmStatic` on the
>        provides methods.   (0da21807)
> 
> 3. **Performance Improvements**
>     1. Build performance: 
>         * `BindingGraph` creation (5c34d6d7, e92edf6b, a8a00fa9, 86eb76ff)
>         * `BindingGraph` validation (48db4f12)
>         * component generation (f1e2a274)
>     2. Runtime performance:
>         * `_Factory` proxy methods can now be accessed without
>           class loading the factory (a258d371).
> 
> ## Dagger 2.25
> **Do not depend on this release.**
>

Updates `dagger-compiler` from 2.24 to 2.25.2
<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [dagger-compiler's releases](https://github.com/google/dagger/releases).*

> ## Dagger 2.25.2
> Known breaking changes
> ===================
> 
>    * The Kotlin change in `2.ii` (below) will break users who were passing in object module
>       instances into a Component builder method rather than using `@JvmStatic`. 
>       To fix this issue, remove the call to the builder method -- the module instance is
>       no longer needed and the Component builder method will no longer be generated.
> 
> What's new
> =========
> 
> 1. **Bug fixes**
>     1. Fix duplicate missing binding error messages. (2411074e)
>     2. Fix dagger-spi pom file from dependency cycle. (3699697c)
>     3. Fix issue with missing shaded deps from [release 2.25](https://github.com/google/dagger/releases/tag/dagger-2.25) (efe1b00a)
> 
> 2. **Kotlin support**
>     1. Qualifier annotations on fields can now be understood without
>       The need for `@field:MyQualifier` (646e0336)
>     2. `@Module object` classes no longer need `@JvmStatic` on the
>        provides methods.   (0da21807)
> 
> 3. **Performance Improvements**
>     1. Build performance: 
>         * `BindingGraph` creation (5c34d6d7, e92edf6b, a8a00fa9, 86eb76ff)
>         * `BindingGraph` validation (48db4f12)
>         * component generation (f1e2a274)
>     2. Runtime performance:
>         * `_Factory` proxy methods can now be accessed without
>           class loading the factory (a258d371).
> 
> ## Dagger 2.25
> **Do not depend on this release.**
> 
> Depend on [release 2.25.2](https://github.com/google/dagger/releases/dagger-2.25.2) instead, which fixes issue [#1639](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/google/dagger/issues/1639).

The FAQ regarding reducers and side effects says:

> Technically speaking Reducer gets every Action from upstream before the registered SideEffects. The idea behind this is that a Reducer may have already changed the state before a SideEffect start processing the Action.

In looking through the code this behavior seems to hang entirely on the fact that PublishSubject stores its subscribers in an array, multicasts events to subscribers in array order, and the reducer is the first subscriber. I don't think that behavior is part of the public API for PublishSubject.  For example, see https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/1662#issuecomment-54387758

I'm still learning about RxJava and am even more naive about RxRedux so I may be missing something here.  If my observations are correct, I think the implementation of `ObservableReduxStore#subscribeActual` should be refactored to ensure actions are reduced before being multicast to the side effect subscribers.
