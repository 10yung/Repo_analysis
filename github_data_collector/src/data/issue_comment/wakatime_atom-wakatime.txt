1. In working around #90, I set the `WAKATIME_HOME` environment variable to a directory like `$HOME/.local/share/wakatime`. At the same time, I moved `.wakatime.cfg`, `.wakatime.db`, `.wakatime.log` into this directory.
2. When I next started Atom, I saw an error message that my API key was not found.
3. In the Atom settings view, I re-entered my API key.
4. I noticed the file `$HOME/.wakatime.cfg` was created, while `$WAKATIME_HOME/.wakatime.cfg` was not modified.

It seems that when atom-wakatime invokes the wakatime Python core, the latter correctly picks up `WAKATIME_HOME`, so that the .db and .log files are modified in the correct directory. But the Atom plugin reads and writes the .cfg file in the wrong place. [Searching the code in this repo](https://github.com/wakatime/atom-wakatime/search?q=WAKATIME_HOME) shows that the environment variable is not used.

For now I work around this issue with a symlink:
```
$ ln -s $HOME/.local/share/wakatime/.wakatime.cfg $HOME/.wakatime.cfg
```
I've combed through some of the other issues and have tried reinstalling the plugin, using different versions of the `wakatime` python package, disabled the `spell-check` plugin, turned debug logging on and off, and I still have problems on Ubuntu whenever I save a file. Seems to lock up on every invocation of the python module for whatever reason.

I'm running Ubuntu 19.04 with Atom 1.40.1.
I love waketime, thank you.
Using Atom, I became confused in settings.
I set Api Key, but the default message was shown instead of my Key. I thought something might be wrong, so I checked cfg file. It was fine.
I expected my Api Key was shown. I believe this would be best.
How do you think?
Hi, your app is great,
would be awesome to have these statistics shown inside Atom,
without leaving it.

Keep up the good work
