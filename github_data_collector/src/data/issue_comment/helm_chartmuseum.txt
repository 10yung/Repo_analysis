Installation instruction is invalid for the non docker mode
```
$ Chmod +x ./chartmuseum
$ mv ./chartmuseum /usr/local/bin
$ chartmuseum --help
```
Maybe a typo !

```
# on Linux
curl -LO https://s3.amazonaws.com/chartmuseum/release/latest/bin/linux/amd64/chartmuseum

# on macOS
curl -LO https://s3.amazonaws.com/chartmuseum/release/latest/bin/darwin/amd64/chartmuseum

# on Windows
curl -LO https://s3.amazonaws.com/chartmuseum/release/latest/bin/windows/amd64/chartmuseum

chmod +x ./chartmuseum
mv ./chartmuseum /usr/local/bin
```
I would like to deploy chartmuseum using AWS Lambda and API gateway. 

How can I reuse the same code by adding only `serverless.yaml` file ? 
Or should be a new software ?
fixed some spelling errors in the file
I am using chartmuseum v0.11.0 (v0.10.0 got same issue) and etcd v2.0.9
When I am running : 
```
chartmuseum --debug --port=8080 \
    --storage="etcd" \
    --storage-etcd-cafile="./cert/server.crt" \
    --storage-etcd-certfile="./cert/serverCrt.crt" \
    --storage-etcd-keyfile="./cert/serverKey.key" \
    --storage-etcd-prefix="/chartmuseum" \
    --storage-etcd-endpoint="http://localhost:2379"

```
The output is always empty , may be I am doing something wrong - but I have no exception or even some kind of logs.

Add testing for both versions, similar to what has been done in helm-push: https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push/blob/master/acceptance_tests/02-chartmuseum.robot#L11
@jdolitsky Can give more context on why the move. There was a talk that codefresh is not exactly reliable. This is just a placeholder issue to discuss and track this :)
We have added support for Helm v3 charts - https://github.com/helm/chartmuseum/pull/294 , but there are no acceptance tests for it yet. We need to add acceptance tests to make sure both v2 and v3 work with the latest chartmuseum
It was disabled here - https://github.com/helm/chartmuseum/pull/294#issuecomment-563297733
 
May be we can use `export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct`
Master branch CI is failing - https://g.codefresh.io/public/accounts/chartmuseum/builds/5dee7b5ce1d2dd41c91fb016 . 
I use chartmuseum v0.8.1(deploy in kubernetes cluster for chart version chartmuseum-1.9.0).
It can see my app's chart version this command
p.s. [CHARTMUSEUM URL] [APP NAME] --> couldn't expose our service..  sorry for that

`curl -s [CHARTMUSEUM URL]/api/charts/[APP NAME] | jq -r '.[].version`
Then the result example is this.
```
v0.0.1-20190129-1145-stable
v0.0.1-20190129-1145
```

I try to curl -s X DELETE for deleting chart.
`curl -s -X DELETE [CHARTMUSEUM URL]/api/charts/[APP NAME]/v0.0.1-20190129-1145-stable`
Then the result is this.
```
{"deleted": true}
```

But check list one more time, then the result is this.
```
v0.0.1-20190129-1145-stable
v0.0.1-20190129-1145
```

I try to DELETE curl once more.
`curl -s -X DELETE [CHARTMUSEUM URL]/api/charts/[APP NAME]/v0.0.1-20190129-1145-stable`
Then the message is this.
```
{"error":"remove /storage/[APP NAME]-v0.0.1-20190129-1145-stable.tgz: no such file or directory"}
```

I don't know what's the problem is
