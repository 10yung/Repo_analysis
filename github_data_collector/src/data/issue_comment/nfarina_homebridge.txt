<!-- If you have an issue with a plugin consider creating an issue in the plugin's github repo instead. -->
### Pre Steps
Homebridge 0.4.50 runs on Windows 10.  Only one Plug-in: homebridge-chamberlain v1.0.8. iOS13.3 iPhone 8 and iPad Air 3
<!-- Before opening an issue, please review the Troubleshooting Page on the Wiki to ensure that this is a new issue, and alternatively search the closed issues for similar problems. -->

<!-- Link to the Troubleshooting page on the Wiki - https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/wiki/Basic-Troubleshooting  -->

<!-- Provide a general summary in the Title above -->

### Expected Behavior
<!-- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->
<!-- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->

When Win10 is connected via WiFi the Home app status shows correctly
When Win10 is connected via Ethernet the Home app shows No Response.

### Current Behavior
<!-- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->
<!-- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->
Tried uninstalling and reinstalling both Homebridge and plugin in Ethernet mode only.  Tried alternate plugin MyQ2 with same results.

### Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
<!-- Please add a series of steps to reproduce the problem. -->

### Versions
<!-- Please run commands and include versions below. -->
- **Homebridge**: 0.4.50
- **Node**:       12.14.1
- **OS**:         Windows 10

### Configuration

This is a follow up to #2366

@nfarina you mentioned that you maybe wanted to combine the typescript migration with the hap-nodejs update.
However I think this introduces some more unnecessary delay to the process. So the following PR should be seen as just a suggestion to speed this process up.

In this PR I updated hap-nodejs to the currently latest version and adjusted some of the direct access imports, which caused some problems with the new project setup of hap-nodejs.

I tested it with a simple switch plugin and couldn't find any more problems. I followed development of hap-nodejs closely since v0.5.0 and thus know that we haven't introduced any API changes which could cause further problems. However I'm happy about anyone proving me wrong regarding this and help fixing it.

Homebridge is running smoothly (Version 0.4.50; oznu/homebridge docker / Synology).

I use some Philips Hue devices with a Hue Bridge (native HomeKit support). Homebridge adds some innr bulbs and tado° (v1) into Apple HomeKit (which woudnt show up in Apples Home.app otherwise).
Using my iPhone Home.app shows all devices as expected.
But on my AppleWatch devices connected via Homebridge (innr, tado°) often appear offline "now answer" until I also open Home.app on my iPhone and my watch updates status.
Why the differen status using watchOS or iOS?
Any suggestions?
sincerely,
paradeiser 
Currently the only way with Homekit to get fading Hue scenes (and all the other stuff the bridge can actually do) is to use Shortcuts on an iOS device to trigger the scene as part of something else. The problem with that of course if you can't use Homekit sensors to trigger the scene and you're' stuck using an iOS device.

Pushcut just created a server which you can run to get around this but it requires an iOS device with it running all the time in the foreground - not ideal and struck me as a bit daft when we have Homebridge running 24/7 - I suppose we could send Pushcut webhooks but again requires an iOS device.

Currently you can make scenes which blink, fade, change colour etc and put them natively on the Hue bridge. You obviously can't share these in Homekit. As they're on the bridge you can trigger them with the native API (the way all 3rd party Hue apps work) - we could use something like Hue Lights to easily create the complex scenes we want and then a Homebridge plugin which adds the scenes as switches and triggers them on the bridge when you turn the device on. 

I wouldn't know where to start so hopefully a talented programmer can step in...
Shortcuts in the homekit allow you to fully control devices via telegrams

I wrote a bot that receives updates and performs the specified actions

The problem is that shortcuts can only receive data, so automation should be launched every 5-10 seconds to receive updates via api telegrams

But, telegrams can also send updates via webhook, which can not be received through shorkat

I suggest writing a simple web server in the form of a plugin that can accept incoming connections, save data from telegrams, while simultaneously including a virtual switch to the homekit, which in turn can download this data from the internal web server

Thanks for attention
Hi.
I have used Homebridge since 2016 with no problems. 
Now I have introduced in config.json this module, in order to see an IP camera in Homekit:

{
                       "platform": "Camera-ffmpeg",
                       "videoProcessor": "avconv",
	               "cameras": [{
		       "name": "Videocamera",
		       "videoConfig": {
		       "source": "-re -i rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.0/play2.sdp",
                       "stillImageSource": "-i http://admin:password@192.168.1.0/image/jpeg.cgi",
                       "maxStreams": 2,
		       "maxWidth": 320,
		       "maxHeight": 240
                                               } 
                                           }]
                                 }

After restarting Homebridge, app Home says Homebrdige not responding. If I delete the script, Homebridge works fine. I don't understand why!!! Consider that the code is validated.
Hey guys,

I installed the [homebridge-http-webhooks plugin](https://github.com/benzman81/homebridge-http-webhooks)  
After installing it and editing the config.json homebridge won't start or restart anymore. If i'm deleting the configuration of the json it works. 

This is the content of the config.json file for the http-webhooks plugin:
```
{
            "platform": "HttpWebHooks",
            "webhook_port": "51828",
            "lights": [
                {
                    "id": "light1",
                    "name": "Light name 1"
                }
            ]
        }
```
The file is saved, i checked it for errors. But if i try to restart homebridge it doesn't work.

If i check the homebridge status with  `sudo journalctl -f -n 200 -u homebridge`  i see this error:

Any ideas?

### Pre Steps
Homebridge will not start  using RPI 3 because of missing Zwave plugin. With ssh running Homebridge command results in following - see output below + JSON used and versions running.



### Versions
- **Homebridge**: `homebridge 0.4.50  version`
- **Node**:       `node 8.17.0 version`
- **OS**:         Raspberry Pi3 

### Configuration
```{
    "bridge": {
        "name": "Homebridge",
        "username": "CC:22:3D:E3:CE:30",
        "port": 51826,

When I validate and restart the raspberry, I do not see my accessories appear in the Config UI X section and it is impossible for me to pair HomeKit to Homebridge.

Can you help me?

Thank you
