After run the tool some files will be deleted.

This is something expected? It is expected that we manually copy again the deleted files in the remaining steps?



Sometimes we have users, who have filenames in different case (from index) in their local copies. 
To find all files in wrong case, and make them as they are in index, I have added new option 'os-rename' - it doesn't make any changes in index, but rename files in filesystem.

And I also make some performance optimizations, it's good for big repositories. It gives about 10 times processing speed boost on my repository.
