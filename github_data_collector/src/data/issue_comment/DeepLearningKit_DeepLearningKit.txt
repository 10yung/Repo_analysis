Just starting and hence not head first too much.  But it may be the new Swift 3 break the whole thing.  I covert it but there is lot of changes.  and accept them does not work.  
I see in the code that 
 `MetalTensorDimensions(n: weight_shape[0], channels: weight_shape[1], width: weight_shape[2], height: weight_shape[3]).`
Shouldn't the width to be the last dimension since caffe uses a row-major format? It is fine when the image is squared but not the general case.
Dear,

Thanks for sharing your code!
I'm running ios demo app on iPhone 6 and getting ~750ms. Is it ok? I saw your video and you got ~90ms...

Hi,

I have create a library project to contain the common code.

Open the DeepLearningKit.xcworkspace file and the project structure is:

DeepLearningKit <-- contain all the library code and all 3 targets with respective unit tests(iOS, OSX and tvOS)
Examples <--contain the 3 example projects (iOS, OSX and tvOS)

Hi,

I'm super stoked to see DeepLearningKit. It is a great starting point for neural nets using Metal and swift. I had this idea since Apple revealed Metal the first time and it is great to see that someone has started to work on it :)

For me personally as I start to experimenting with DeepLearningKit and thinking of integrating it into real apps the first thing that comes to mind is: 
- Would be great if DeepLearningKit was a library (easy to drop into any project)
- A library with unit tests, bench-marking and other nice metrics 
- CI support that supports the collaboration and fast evolution/development

I don't know if someone is already doing something familiar, but my plans are:
1. Turn DeepLearningKit in a library project
2. Add unit testing
3. Setup travis for CI - build and testing
4. Publish in CocoaPods and Carthage
5. Change the example code to use the library instead of the common files directly

Cheers,
Rafael

Hi, 

I am trying to convert  trained caffemodel of size 33MB to JSON for deeplearning kit using caffemodel2json.py, surprisingly the size of the JSON output file is 10x, in my case it comes to 330MB. I feel accommodating that big file on iOS app will not be feasible option. Could you please guide me on how to procceed with this? Is there a way to reduce the file size by configuring py script?

Thanks   

Is Metal performing better than OpenCL and OpenGL (ES) when doing neural network computation?

Hello, 
I am a newbie in iOS and Deep learning. I went through the basics of Deep learning and Neural networks. The documentation doesn't say how to use this library? 

I have a model with me which was written using Caffe Framework. How can I integrate it with DeepLearningKit?

Any detailed documentation available online?

P.S
I ran the DeepLearningiOSDemo app which is working perfectly on my iPhone.

Any help would be appreciated.
Thank you.

Dear author, I have some question with metal programming about thread number and thread group number setting. I change the thredsPerGroup from (1,1,1) to (32,1,1), and change the threadGroups from 
(1,1,1)  to (number,1,1), where number is (vectorcount+31)/32. But I didn't see any change or improve at processing time. I wonder know did i do the right setting? thanks.
