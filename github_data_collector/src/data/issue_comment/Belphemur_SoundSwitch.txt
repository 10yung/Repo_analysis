Just this or are there others?

C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\SoundSwitch

Also is there a way possible to do a portable install which I could then backup that one location?

This thread from 2017 asks this question, I wonder if this has been developed any further?

Hello, I'm having problems trying to install SoundSwitch if "Install for me only" option is selected on the Select install menu. If I try to install for all users I don't have any problem.

I'm using Microsoft Windows Version 1903 (OS Build 18362.592)

PS: It's my firts Issue so hopefully I did it correctly
Hi,

We dropped it a couple of months/years (?) ago - i don't know anymore - but i'm looking forward to get it back implemented.

I will create a pull-request in the next few weeks.
I am on Windows Insider.
Everything worked well up to a couple of weeks ago.
Now: Every time I log in to Windows I have to right click settings and choose devices.
Now: Every update attempt fails majorly.

Hello, I'm using [Chocolatey Windows Package Manager](https://chocolatey.org/) to manage all of my installed software. SoundSwitch is the only one which I need to install/update manually outside this environment. Would be it possible to add support ? Thanks!
**User Story**
I have Razer Nari Ultimate and in this headphones whith wheel on it to regulate sound from chat (Default communication devive) and from Game (Default device). And a speakers so actually I have 3 devicec registerster on my system, but when I am using Headphones I should have:
Default Comunnication Device: Razer Nari Ultimate - Chat
Default Device: Razer Nari Ultimate - Game
When using speaker I should have:
Default Comunnication Device: Speaker
Default Device: Speaker

**Posibble Solution**
Make something like groups select 1 or 2 devices on group. 1 is default device, 2 is default communication device.
This {{{{may}}}} not be a problem on your end, but I was trying to donate and PayPal keeps generating an unknown error. It simply says "If you continue to encounter problems, please contact customer service." coupled with a yellow !. 

I tried several times. Both the button link and the banner link. May not be your issue, could be PayPal. Thought I would share none the less.

Hey, great application!

I was wondering if it was possible to be able to have an option to switch only communication devices for playback? I currently am using a Steel Series Arctis 7 along with separate microphone and speakers. The issue that I'm running into is that the Arctis 7 uses two different audio channels one for communications and one for the rest. When I'm using my speakers I would like to have my default playback (including communications) as one channel but when I switch to my headset I would like to change only the default  communications.

So the scenario looks something like this

HEADPHONES:
Arctis 7 Game - Default Device
Arctis 7 Chat - Default Communications Device

SPEAKERS:
Arctis 7 Game - Default Device & Default Communications Device (plays through speakers when headphones not connected)
