Hi, I have an error: 

[!] Cannot load main LinkedIn POST page
loadpage debug
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "social_mapper.py", line 755, in loadPage
    return emptybyte.join(response.readlines())
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'response' referenced before assignment
I have run social mapper in kali Linux. To my surprise it doesn't deliver the expected result.
1. facebook login has limitation
2. if i renamed billgate.jpg as renew.jpg it does not fetch any result. 
it claims to be a face recognition application rather we found this to be more profile name related search

The code is full of commented, un-used code. This PR removes it, and formats all python files
Even when not selecting LinkedIn (-li) I get the following error:


```
âžœ  python3 social_mapper.py -f company -i "SpiderLabs" -m fast -fb
[!] Could not authenticate to LinkedIn. cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object
```

The full dump is:

```

    declared_encoding_match = xml_re.search(markup, endpos=xml_endpos)
TypeError: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object
```

Seems to originate from the `login()` function, specifically the line parsing the LinkedIn page via BeautifulSoup:

`parse = BeautifulSoup(page, "html.parser")`
(https://github.com/Greenwolf/social_mapper/blob/master/social_mapper.py#L708)

I've got the latest version of BS installed:

```
 pip3 list | grep -i beaut 
beautifulsoup4          4.8.1     
```

I haven't dug much deeper, but seems odd to try authenticate to LinkedIn (i) when I'm not selecting it, and (ii) I removed the LinkedIn creds from the `social_mapper.py` file.

Any help greatly appreciated.
It seems every time i try and run the command "python -m pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt" it get's stuck on "Running setup.py install for dlib ... -" and will just eventually give me a whole lot of errors in red text. I have already installed all of the requirements to my knowledge. I'm running a kali linux machine that is up to date. Any help would be greatly apreciated. Thanks.
