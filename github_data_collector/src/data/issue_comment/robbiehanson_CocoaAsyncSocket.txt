can cocoaAsyncSocket be applied with Apple Watch app?

I am using "GCDAsyncSocket" in my project. My project A video conversation project using the Linphone library. And I also use socket connection. The application only works between devices connected to the local modem.

The socket I use in my application closes 3 minutes after entering the application background. I want the socket not to close as long as the application is running (unless the application is killed). My application doesn't have a backend. All communication, except for Linphone, only takes place via the socket.

How can I do that?

I've tried


```
    func socket(_ sock: GCDAsyncSocket, didAcceptNewSocket newSocket: GCDAsyncSocket) {
        print("connect succuess")
        print("connect to" + newSocket.connectedHost!)
        print("port" + String(newSocket.connectedPort))
        clients.append(newSocket)
        callIP = newSocket.connectedHost!
        sock.enableBackgroundingOnSocket()
        
        newSocket.readData(withTimeout: -1, tag: 0)
    }
```
尝试了很多方式，就是不行。
Hello!

I'm seeing a zillion deprecation warnings in GCDAsyncSocket.m when building on macOS Catalina targeting iOS 13 / Catalyst, such as:

I'm using GCDAsyncUDP stuff and it all seems to be working fine, and obviously no TLS/SSL, but things are working fine at this point.
Wanted to contribute this back , this adds Swift Package support to the library.

Through the above stack analysis, all the problems occurred in `libdispatch.dylib', which is related to the use of `dispatch_async'. Excuse me: What do I need to pay attention to when calling `writeData: with Timeout: tag: `method?
