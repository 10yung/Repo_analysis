Close #116 
What do you think about adding `GOTESTS_TEMPLATE` and `GOTESTS_TEMPLATE_DIR` environment variables that corresponds to the `-template` and `-template_dir` options?

When working with different projects, some might being using testing framework like https://github.com/stretchr/testify some might not. Having these environment variables available allows users to which between the template types easily especially when using it together with tool like https://github.com/direnv/direnv that can load/unload environment variables depending on the working directory.

Maybe what we can do is allow user to set the `template` or `template_dir` values via both flags and environment variables with the value of the flag takes precedence over the one from environment variables.

I can create a PR if you think this is okay.
First of all, very nice your project. I would like to contribute too, and I have some questions.

Do you have plans to generate the test cases too? Would be difficult to do it?

Do you have plans to generate separated test functions instead of the table style?
i want to mock http , should i import third-part package? example  gomock
Can these tests be generated to be run in parallel?

Our team is currently having a discussion over underscores being present in the generated Tests for `gotests`. These underscores appear to match the naming convention defined in https://golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Examples but that convention implies that is for Examples only, not Tests.

Wondering what discussion occurred that led to this convention in `gotests` applying for the generated Tests? We'd love to know!

In Intellij Goland, when I choose "Generate tests for package", I get this error:
`gotests fatal error: concurrent map writes`
then an infinite stack trace, and then this other message
`created by github.com/cweill/gotests.parallelize`

I don't really know if IÂ´m doing something wrong
On installation I receive errors.

https://github.com/google/go-cmp/ is more usefull then reflect.DeepEqual

I changed reflect.DeepEqual to cmp.Equal
and add to t.Errorf cmp.Diff for more detailed view of diff between got and want
for exmaple how it looks like
