Hi @curi0usJack ,
I have installed Luckystrike on my Windows 7. I have done all the setup successfully , the only problem that i am facing rite now is that i am generating a new excel file but I am not able to find the generated file on the mentioned folder path.

Can you Provide me a solution on this.


On a fresh install on a Windows 10 VM I try to run luckystrike.ps1 and I get the following:
`Could not find database at C:\Windows\system32\ls.db. Did you run the install script?`

I ended up moving ls.db from `C:\Windows\system32\luckystrike\` to `C:\Windows\system32\`
but that doesn't feel quite right.
Hi Jack,

PLease, could you make sense of the following: 

I have an .EXE reverse_tcp payload that i run on windows 10 x64, it does not flag Kaspersky nor Defender and I manage to open a meterpreter shell without detection.
 
When I infect an XLS or word document using LUCKYSTRIKE with the same FUD EXE, Kaspersky starts to detect the XLS file as virus. why detects the XLS document but not the EXE? and whether there is a way around it maybe encryption option if possible with domain name for EXE like Powershell script option in LuckyStrike. 

Thank you 

Hi,

First of all, thank you for developing this tool and for making it so user friendly.

I am trying to attach an .exe to a .xls file using either the Save On Disk or Certutil methods. I don't have any error when I run luckystrike, however when I launch the infected .xls file and enable macro, I have the following error.

(Save on disk method here, but I have the same error with Certutil)

I saw a previous issue where someone was having this error and so I went to check the AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/AddIn like you said. The .exe file is present on the directory but it is slightly smaller than the original one (115ko vs 122ko). 

When I try to run it manually, I have a windows error "This app can't run on your PC". So it seems that the .exe is somehow damaged during the process and so when the macro tries to run "Shell(pth)" it fails.

I am running luckystrike on a Windows 7 VM with PS v5 and Microsoft Excel 2016 and the previous captures are from a Windows 10 Host with Microsoft Excel 2016. The same error occurs when launching the .xls file on the Windows 7 VM.

Don't hesitate to ask if you need more details to help me on this issue!

Cheers

Having issues where it appears that I have stored a PowerShell payload within the catalog, but then it appears to go missing when trying to use that payload through the selection process.  Let me know if this is a user error and not using the tool properly.

the code was detected in runtime by windows defender, dont know if this is so with other AVs. but it was kill in runtime. any idea if this can be fixed?
Occurs in 1.1.7 when combining payloads. To repro, add the following cobalt strike payloads:

1) Powershell command / Metadata attack
2) beacon.exe (stageless) / Certutil attack

Generate file from template (calendar)
Specifically on my win10 test vm. no idea why.
Throws generic "Method 'Run' of object 'IWshShell3' failed" error. 
Produces file not found errors if not using correctly cased path (or at least drive letter).
