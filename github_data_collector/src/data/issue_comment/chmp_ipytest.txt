Hi, thanks for this great project!

I want to run doctest with cell magic, as follows:

```
%%run_pytest --doctest-modules
def foo(x):
    """
    >>> foo(2)
    4
    """
    return x*2
```

However, the output says  no tests found:
```
============================= test session starts ==============================
platform darwin -- Python 3.6.9, pytest-5.0.1, py-1.8.0, pluggy-0.12.0
rootdir: /Users/yohei_tamura/work/men
collected 0 items

========================= no tests ran in 0.02 seconds =========================
```
Currently the example notebook is more geared towards understanding the implementaiton details, than how to use ipytest effectively.
