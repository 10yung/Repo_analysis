whenever I put my gist id, the code section appeared but its execution pane do not show anything.
I found a little display issue after first line in IE browser, though with few knowledge about shiny.js and app.js...

I need to rewrite rNotebook to take advantage of recent advancements.
1. shinyAce
2. OpenCPU

The idea is to have a single column document with editable code cells, just like an iPython notebook. It should allow users to execute a single code chunk or the entire document.

I think this should not be very complicated. In fact, I already have an interactive single column version of the console, with output below, and I should be able to tweak it.

It makes a lot of sense to rewrite this app using AngularJS. The major advantages I see are:
1. Simpler and easily maintainable code.
2. Two Way Data Binding.

This should make it really easy to add additional features. As AngularJS already has an Ace directive, it should be fairly simple to implement this.

1. [livecoding.io](http://livecoding.io/3419322)

The JS code is currently all over the place split across multiple files and folders. I would like to organize it better. I want to keep the vendor libraries organized in their own folders, and all application related code combined into a single minified file.

I want to check popular HTML5 applications to see how they organize custom assets and vendor code. It would be good to follow an established convention rather than coming up with my own custom approach.

Eventually, I want to move my app development workflow to use a JS package manager like Yeoman, Jam, Volo or Bower. Just wanted to put that in here as well.

tooltip reads F4 to knit but code says CTRL+e

Also, on Windows in Chrome, CTRL+e does not work.  Rather it goes to the address bar and says "enter query".

For example, http://ramnathv.github.io/rNotebook/?c06d4f0488af3dbdedc4 should automatically load the contents of the gist.

I can extend this to load urls as well. The code is already there in `ace-shiny.js`, but needs to be cleaned up a bit.

When uploading a file in mac os, running rNotebook locally, it shows the path as `C:/fakepath`. Anyway, it seems to work.

The publish button doesn't work (mac os, chrome/firefox), if it is supposed to do that yet :)
