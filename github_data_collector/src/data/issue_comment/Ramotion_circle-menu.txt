A few updates to the demo app to support the light and dark modes of iOS 13. Added an icon, and cleaned up the code a bit.
I need to display single button in circle menu. by default single button not displaying, more than one button only displaying.
Hey, first of all you developed a nice library thank you for that. 
I changed my start and end angles to -90 - 90 because I want to use only top of circle.
It works very well but there is a error with closing animation. It still closing with 0-360 degree. 
How can I set start and end angles for closing animation ? 
Thanks.
Is not triggering at all?

```Swift
func circleMenu(_ circleMenu: CircleMenu, buttonDidSelected button: UIButton, atIndex: Int) {
        print("button did select: \(atIndex)")
    }
```
Hello,
some months ago I have already used CircleMenu in a Objc App. 
However, today I created the framework again with the latest files and it seems that some things have change: e.g. the normalIcon and selectedIcon properties are missing. (These changes are not mentioned in the changelog)

Did I miss something?

Thank you

Jan

`func circleMenu(_ circleMenu: CircleMenu, buttonDidSelected button: UIButton, atIndex: Int) {
    print("button did selected: \(atIndex)")
    
    let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)
    let annoucement = storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "FirstVC") as! FirstVC

           
  }`

This method is not working. please guide me
We used the previous version of this and it worked very well. Since the swift 3 update, we have a center button popping up in the center of the circle and rotates when a button is pressed. We cannot seem to find where to prevent this from happening. Love the animation of the buttons on the outside but prefer it without the center button animation. I will appreciate your assistance with this.
The menu pops up where the initial button (CircleMenu) is located.
It would be nice to pop it up in the center of the superview no matter where the initiating button is located (in a corner for example).

Very attractive animations. You've spent a lot of time on this. Thanks.
