As of this week, freegeoip has a new home at https://github.com/apilayer/freegeoip/

This repo will be archived soon and if you have inquiries going forward please open issues on that repo instead. The domain freegeoip.net is being transitioned to apilayer's infrastructure and we expect no service disruption, but if you find anything wrong please report to @apilayer.

I am done with running freegeoip after 9 years of its existence. :)
