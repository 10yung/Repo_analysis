How to slide to the next picture when zooming in? Currently, it can only be in the current unit
I've implemented to a website the Photoswipe library and everything works fine on the pc. Even with the chrome device tool, the photoswipe is opening up properly. But on phones it won't work. I've noticed that when I delete the bootstrap meta, it's working even on phones
meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"
but the problem is that the website is not properly displayed because of the lack of the meta. What can I do to make both the meta tag and the photoswipe lib work together?

On touch devices endless scrolling (start with first pic after reaching last) is only possible, if minimum 3 pics in the gallery.
Endless scrolling works on tapping the button, but not with swiping.

Hi, how to close the gallery on overlay tap ?
I'm using PhotoSwipe with Vue on this site : [eventlokale](https://www.eventlokale.ch/site/_eventlokale/1/Schweiz/40311/chicago_1928.html)

i have multiple galleries on one page and when i switch between galleries , the url doesn't get cleaned and the site refreshes. To recreate the problem 
- go ahead and open some of the images on the link above
- close that gallery and open the other one that is initiated by clicking on the image icon in the row where it says "RÃ¤ume"
- then close that gallery and you'll notice the problem, if it doesn't happen just redo the same steps will happen after the second or third try

i've added type="button" on the buttons that control the gallery so they don't trigger the form, but still getting the same problem

also to mention this is happening only on Chrome!

Am i missing something obvious or this is a bug ?
**Steps to reproduce**

1. Open a gallery in full-screen
2. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>Return</kbd> and <kbd>Space</kbd>
3. Exit full-screen mode

You can try this on your own [CodePen](https://codepen.io/dimsemenov/pen/gbadPv)

**Actual Behaviour**

The images that were active while pressing any of the mentioned keys will remain visible
and the full-screen mode cannot be entered a second time.

**Expected Behaviour**

No visible artifacts, working full-screen mode

**Notes**

I've added an event listener which prevents <kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>Return</kbd> and <kbd>Space</kbd> while PhotoSwipe is in full-screen. This fixes the issue in Chrome, but the problem persists in Firefox.

**Setup**

Windows 10.0.17134.1130
Chrome 78
Firefox 72 (Developer Edition)


How can I initialize the gallery without it automatically starting to view any pictures?  I need for the user to select from a gallery I'm displaying, and then start that way, but if I don't call gallery.init() first it doesn't work at all.

Thanks.
I've implemented PhotoSwipe [here](https://www.spiritualselftransformation.com/alchemy-rings) and it works great on desktop. The full images are 1080x1080. On mobile, however, it displays the image much much larger than the screen and thus I'm unable to even view the full pictures from my mobile device. How do I fix that?
when one defines: loop: false,
this definition indeed prevent him to loop back to the first photo, if he is sliding images with his finger. But if one uses the navigation arrows, the loop is still enabled.
If you use your mouse to click outside the element, it works just fine, and the photoswipe modal will close.

However, on mobile, if you simply touch outside, nothing happens.

Is there a workaround for this?
