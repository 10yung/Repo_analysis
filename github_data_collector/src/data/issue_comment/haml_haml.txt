Upgrading from Rails 5.0 to 5.1, with the following related gems:

```
rails 5.1.7
haml 5.1.2
tilt 2.0.10
```
and `ruby 2.6.5p114 (2019-10-01 revision 67812) [x86_64-darwin18]`

The app fails to boot with `uninitialized constant Tilt::ErubiTemplate`
I found the changes in haml 5.1.1 which seem to address this issue, but it doesn't work for me.
When an attribute has quotes, and we need to disable `escape_attrs`, the quotes aren't escaped correctly, this PR fixes it.
Regarding the same idea of #984, we're migrating an app to newer Ruby/Rails versions, and it seems that the 4.x behavior isn't complete with just `escape_interpolated_html`, as the attributes are being a little weird.

On 4.x:

```ruby
Haml::Engine.new(%{ %a{ :href => '/', :'@click' => "callback('a')" } link }.strip).render
=> <a @click="callback('a')" href='/'>link</a>
```

On 5.1.2:

```ruby
Haml::Engine.new(%{ %a{ :href => '/', :'@click' => "callback('a')" } link }.strip).render
=> <a @click='callback(&#39;a&#39;)' href='/'>link</a>
```

This change breaks the inline templates for libraries like Vue. Digging in the code, I find `escape_attrs`, which doesn't help on either version, both outputting:

```ruby
Haml::Engine.new(%{ %a{ :href => '/', :'@click' => "callback('a')" } link }.strip, :escape_attrs => false ).render
=> <a @click='callback('a')' href='/'>link</a>
```

Is this the expected output? I'm not seeing a case in which I would like to break out of the attribute value, I think this is a security issue.

I found that the `attr_wrapper` option can be assigned to a symbol that will wrap the attribute (single quotes by default), but this would break whenever the attribute value has the same value.

My proposal is to call inspect for the attribute value:

```
"callback('a', \"b\")".inspect
=> "callback('a', \"b\")"
```

Does that make sense? Should I start working on a PR or is it part of the spec or wontfix?

Currently `text.haml` files are html escaped. This PR fixes that.

Related to haml/haml#1014 and haml/haml-rails#163
On haml 5.1.1, all text in `.text.haml` files is html escaped. Using `escape_filter_interpolations` doesn't seem to help. This seems to be related: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8235

Is there any way to disable escaping on `text.haml` files altogether?
Ruby: 1.9.3-p392
Haml: haml-3.1.7
Rails: 3.2.18

I'm getting this error while browsing site. I tried to modify the method but didn't found the solution for the same.

Any help will be appreciated...

Hello Haml, 

Thanks for your AMAZING Project. 

I encountered a problem that I need to printfs a http headers on `pre` tag, like this:

```haml
.log-detail
  .segment
    .content-item
      %label Headers
      %pre
        :preserve
          <b>Request URL:</b> #{log.url}
          <b>Request Method:</b> POST
        - log.request_headers && log.request_headers.each do |key, value|
          <b>#{key}:</b> #{value}<br/>
```

but it output like this:

```
Request URL: http://giteewebhook.herokuapp.com/webhooks
Request Method: POST
      Content-Type: application/json
      User-Agent: git-oschina-hook
      X-Gitee-Token: baaba
      X-Gitee-Event: Push Hook
      X-Git-Oschina-Event: Push Hook
```

Expected like this:

```
Request URL: http://webhook.herokuapp.com/webhooks
Request Method: POST
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: github-hook 
X-Event: Push Hook
```

How to remove whitespace on ruby loop or do a ruby loop on preserve?

Rails Version: 3.2.2

Ruby Version: 2.1.9

Haml Version: 4.0.2

Thank a log

I've run into an issue when embedding html in an attribute in haml. 

if the attribute is a `SafeBuffer` (or otherwise `html_safe?` already) then any apostrophes don't get converted to `&#39`. I thought it should -- because although it is marked html_safe, that doesn't necessarily mark it as attribute-safe (hence the need for `'` to `&#39` conversion).

Is this something Haml should support? I've got a test for it (but no clue how to implement as yet). 

The alternative is that this change has to be done within the template itself (with something like `my_safe_buffer.gsub("'", "&#39;").html_safe`)
