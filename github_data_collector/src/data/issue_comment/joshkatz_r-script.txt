I am trying to call simple R file which will call hist function. 
But when I call this function, I am getting following error

> Error: No method asJSON S3 class: histogram
> 
> Execution halted
> 

below is my R code

```
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,6)

hist(x, col="lightblue")

```

and here is my index.js file
```

var express = require('express');
var R = require("r-script");

var app = express(); app.get('/', function (req, res) 
{      
	var out = R("example/sample.R")
  .data("hello world", 20)
  .callSync();
    console.log(out);

}) 
var server = app.listen(8081, function () {      var port = server.address().port   
   console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`)})
```


Similarly I cannot execute any other R function. example
`x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,6)
print(summary(x));`

I am getting error as below

> Error: No method asJSON S3 class: table
> 
> Execution halted

It seems that this project is no longer maintained, I've created a new project here: https://github.com/fridgerator/r-script
I am running the sync example code but got the following error:
 
if (child.stderr) throw child.stderr;
                    ^
Error in R script ex-sync.R
 'unable to install packages'


How to fix it
The npm package is not yet updated according to the latest version on the `master` branch. (don't know much about npm, but) Can it be made to update on every new pull request that is made to the `master` branch?
I've updated the path to `r-script` module to run `ex.js` from repo.


I personally have a Mac and was using the latest distribution of R at the time of writing (Version 3.5.1). When testing my R code and NodeJS code on a Windows machine for another user, I ran into a couple errors. Hopefully, the below is enlightening for others.

1) Adding R to PATH

I kept getting this error

```
events.js:183
     throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
     ^

Error: spawn Rscript ENOENT
   at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (internal/child_process.js:190:19)
   at onErrorNT (internal/child_process.js:362:16)
   at _combinedTickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:139:11)
   at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:181:9)
```
I believe NodeJS cannot call R through command prompt.
In order to resolve, you need to add R to PATH for Windows machines.

See http://yizhexu.com/2017/02/r-path/ with excerpt below

```
1. Verify R is installed in the following path: C:\Program Files\R\R-3.3.2\bin\x86
2. Open the start menu and type in “View advanced system settings”, click on “Environment variables”
3. Under “System variables”, select Path and click on edit.
4. Click “New”, and add the folder address for R to there (C:\Program Files\R\R-3.3.2\bin\x86)
5. Open windows power shell and type in Rterm or R.exe to launch R command line tool
```

**After adding R to PATH, you need to completely restart NodeJS.**

2) Security Issues

You may run into issues with R when updating packages/installing packages because of Windows Security. Make sure that you have granted full control of the R files for your user account.

https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-take-ownership-and-get-full-access-to-files-and-folders-in-windows-10/

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5059692/unable-to-update-r-packages-in-default-library-on-windows-7

I _believe_ the location is something like C:/Program Files/R/R-3.2.1/library, but I've honestly forgotten at this point. I think there was another location on the Windows machine that I had to change the permissions to allow R to download whatever packages were needed.

3) Synchronous vs Asynchronous Calls

I kept running into this error

```
These are the inputs: 2018-01-01, 2019-01-01, E, 2, 8
undefined:1
installing packages:njsonlite
^

SyntaxError: Unexpected token i in JSON at position 0

   at Socket.Readable.push (_stream_readable.js:208:10)
   at Pipe.onread (net.js:601:20)
```

If you look at the index.js and launch.R code within the r-script package, it is pretty revealing.

From launch.R we have

```
source(file.path(Sys.getenv("DIRNAME"), "needs.R"))
needs(jsonlite)
```

It seemed to me that the last output of R is what tries to get converted to JSON format to pass to NodeJS. However, I couldn't understand why `installing packages:njsonlite` was the last output (as it was from launch.R which I believe just calls the specific R script you need).

I experimented a LOT over 2 or 3 days and ended up changing to synchronous calls previously from asynchronous calls.

Within my code we changed from

```
         var plotType = "scatter";
         var fpmScatter = R(fpmMortalityPath)
             .data(req.query.startDate,req.query.endDate,req.query.formType,req.query.userLevel,req.query.userId,plotType)
             .call(function(err, a) {
                 if (err) throw err;
                 res.json(a)
             });
         }
```

to 

```
        var plotType = "scatter";
        var data = R(fpmMortalityPath)
            .data(req.query.startDate,req.query.endDate,req.query.formType,req.query.userLevel,req.query.userId,plotType)
            .callSync();
                console.log(data);
            res.json(data);
        }
```

After making this change, the code worked. I am still not sure why this was the case. I speculated that there might be differences between calls between Windows and Mac machines? However, I am not too sure of this theory.
I have a script that writes a csv. When I start my Node process fresh and trigger the R script the first time, the R script completes and the CSV is written. The second time I trigger it however, it just hangs. Any ideas what could be leftover from the first call (which should be exited by now)?
I got my R scripts to run when using node js + express in the NetBeans IDE. But when I use npm to install and start the application, the call fails. For debugging purposes, I modified the callAsync function to log to the console as follows:

R.prototype.callSync = function(_opts) {
  var opts = _opts || {};
  this.options.env.input = JSON.stringify([this.d, this.path, opts]);
  console.log("about to call R scripts. options: "+JSON.stringify(this.options));
  var child = child_process.spawnSync("Rscript", this.args, this.options);
  if (child.stderr){console.log(child.stderr); throw child.stderr;}
  return(JSON.parse(child.stdout));
};
and when I run using npm start I get the following log:

Warning in utils::install.packages(missing, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/",  :

Error in utils::install.packages(missing, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/",  : 
  unable to install packages
Calls: needs -> needs_ -> <Anonymous>
Execution halted

So it appears that the script is installing a package but doesn't have permissions.
After some more debugging, I see that the variable missing is equal to "jsonlite". So the launch.R script is failing at the line "needs(jsonlite)".

I tried going into RStudio and installing the package "jsonlite". That was successful but it didn't change this output.

It is strange that the script works fine from within NetBeans but not in the npm start context. Any ideas, please? This is a nice solution to the problem of linking to R. I hope I can get it to work.
THanks,

I ran npm install r-script in Users/<username>/Documents/workspace-neon/mss-server/ and was testing the example R scripts and javascripts. Specifically example.js with ex-sync.R.

My path was /Users/<username>/Documents/workspace-neon/mss-server/node_modules/r-script/example/ and I ran:
node ex.js

I kept getting 

```TypeError: Cannot read property 'data' of undefined
    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/linjo/Documents/workspace-neon/mss-server/node_modules/r-script/example/ex.js:6:3)

```

I believe the fix is documented in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50093298/r-integration-with-node-script-using-r-script

In index.js, the init function should be:

```
function init(path) {
  var obj = new R(path);
  _.bindAll(obj, "data", "call", "callSync");
  return obj;
}
```

Also, in ex-async.R you need to change summarize_each to summarize_all.
