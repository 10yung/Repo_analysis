Hello,

I was wondering if it would be useful to open an issue that would not be a real issue, but a way to collect info about the projects using RuntimeCompiled CPlusCPlus, such a [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) does in its [Gallery issue](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/2847).

Feel free to close this issue if you think this is not appropriate.

Thanks for this excellent tool!
For Debian 9.3 (amd64) In RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/Aurora/CMakeLists.txt at line 109, you missed the link with Xrandr. The correct line should be:
```
set(GLFW_LIBRARIES glfw X11 Xrandr pthread)
```
else this will produce undefined symbols like: XRRGetScreenInfo ...

For VS2015+ we always handle exceptions ourselves, as VS changed to always catching these before the app. However C++ exceptions are handled first by the app, so they don't get a chance for the debugger to catch them.
Reported potential problem with Atom and OSX not triggering re-compiles on file changes.

The splash screens in SimpleTest are not appearing in the XCode build, but are in the cmake one on OSX.

Workaround: Use cmake to generate project files.

Add MinGW support.

Move Systems, Renderer, and Common into SimpleTest project.
