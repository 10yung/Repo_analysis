Please let me know how to fix this @ZevEisenberg  @raphaelcruzeiro  @maxmeyers 

Made changes needed for running Razzle on Xcode 11 and Swift 5.1

@maxmeyers  @lauraskelton @raphaelcruzeiro 
This commit contains changes to the source files to update them to the most recent version of Swift (5)
I am getting the following error after i upgrade to Swift 5.0 (XCode 10.2)

SWIFT_VERSION '3.0' is unsupported, supported versions are: 4.0, 4.2, 5.0. (in target 'RazzleDazzle')

support swift 4
Simple swift 4 conversion and removed warnings.
Appstore not requires that in production build code coverage should be **disabled**. Further discussion on apple developer forum:

https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/81893

When you integrate RazzleDazzle with carthage it will return error:

> Invalid Bundle - Disallowed LLVM instrumentation. Do not submit apps with LLVM profiling instrumentation or coverage collection enabled. Turn off LLVM profiling or code coverage, rebuild your app and resubmit the app.  

After release to the store. Disabling code coverage in scheme setting fix this issue.

Added a LayerTransformAnimation for animating a CALayer's CATransform3D.
This project seems abandoned, there has been several PRs to address the warnings introduced in Swift 3.1 that has been untouched by the maintainer(s).
