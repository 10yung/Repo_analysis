when capturedVideo session in ending, the given url path contain "tmp".
**Question:** Is there any way to fetch the recorded video's **PHAsset**?
I'm trying to capture a photo on my device in the latest version of iOS (10.4.1) and I'm getting the following error:

    VISION: error media services failed, error (Error Domain=AVFoundationErrorDomain Code=-11800 "The operation could not be completed" UserInfo={NSLocalizedFailureReason=An unknown error occurred (-16811), NSLocalizedDescription=The operation could not be completed, NSUnderlyingError=0x1c3a42370 {Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-16811 "(null)"}})

I'm using the example in the library, where I've changed "PBJCameraModeVideo" to "PBJCameraModePhoto":

https://github.com/piemonte/PBJVision/blob/c09d34f524a9983e97555be92fa01d930d413dc9/Project/Vision/PBJViewController.m

Capturing video seems to work nicely... there I'm getting the video previewed in the view I've made. But in "PBJCameraModePhoto" my view is blank and I'm getting the above error.

Any suggestions as to what's wrong?
Hi developers. As I said in the title of this post. I want to capture from both cameras at the same time. I know that it is not possible on Iphone devices but i tried to switch cameras very quickly. Iphone waste a lot of time switching between cameras. I want to know if PBJVision could switch cameras more efficiently or record simultaneously from them. The ideal y to show in preview back camera and record frames from it, and record frames in front camera at the same time without previewing it and do not lose the front preview.

Thanks in advance.
`Cannot remove an observer <PBJVision 0x12b2be340> for the key path "currentDevice.torchMode" from <PBJVision 0x12b2be340>, most likely because the value for the key "currentDevice" has changed without an appropriate KVO notification being sent. Check the KVO-compliance of the PBJVision class.

Hi @piemonte, I've experience a subj problem almost in 90% cases. Do you have some solutions for this? 
How capture slow-mo with PBJVision ?
refactor device management to address reported issues:

i'll update the logic to match how NextLevel is handling this:

On iPhone 7 in video mode, PBJVision has an odd behavior, the video session keeps starting and stopping...
I looked for where this was coming from and realized the issue is all about audio. When deactivating audio, everything works properly.
Even more odd, when plugging in the iPhone headset, the issue also disappears (with audio **activated**), as if there was a problem with the builtin mic but not the headset one.
AVFoundation spits out an unknown error, so kind of hard to investigate.

Any idea why this might be happening?

Here are some logs (those keep repeating as the session starts and stops)

Hi,

When I try to end recording a video, the app crashes at `[_assetWriterVideoInput markAsFinished];` or `[_assetWriterAudioInput markAsFinished];`. This never happened to me before iOS10, but since it was release I've had to update my Info.plist file to include the newly required "Privacy" strings `Privacy - Camera Usage Description`, `Privacy - Media Library Usage Description` and `Privacy - Microphone Usage Description`. The crash happens only at first try, when the user is prompted by the to give access to the Camera and Microphone. If the user accepts both and continues recording the video, then tries to end video capture, the app crashes. If the user has already given these permissions before, the app will not crash and will work as expected.

So I'm guessing it's something to do with the permissions. Should I not wait for the popup to appear automatically? Should I somehow ask for the permissions before the video capture starts?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
