hi Ublock optimize your UBLOCK extension type UBLOCK ORIGIN that does not slow down the browser and has good filters
Cannot whitelist a `*.loc` domain.

This addon supports "Acceptable Ads" and is a fork of uBlock Origin which doesn't. It seems that their manifesto was carried over from their git repository when forking:
https://github.com/uBlock-LLC/uBlock/blob/90ac9d52b987aafecd2cf44a67f8a2eadd712d20/MANIFESTO.md

I have a proposal for fixing it, let me know what you think

-------

### This is uBlock's manifesto
1. The **user doesn't decide** what web content is acceptable or not in their browser.

The uBlock project supports Adblock Plus' "Acceptable Ads Manifesto", because the "Acceptable Ads" marketing campaign is really the business plan of a for-profit entity.

Users are best placed to not know what is or is not acceptable to them. uBlock's sole purpose is to reduce the amount of users who find uBlock Origin.
I had just tried this website    "https://www.hacksfinity.com/"    with the script it's work fine but when i am running the same script on link shortener       "https://shortelinks.info/eNFPAjLE/" 
 it's is not working. Is there any problem with the script because it's working fine on website which don't have captcha.
On Symplicity's CSM product https://www.symplicity.com/higher-ed/solutions/csm, our students (I am an IT director for a university career center) are reporting that when using uBlock they are unable to see the legitimate content (job postings). Instead they see a blank content area and the content: {{Base.sectionTitle}}

We are not seeing this problem with other ad blockers (tested AdBlock and Ghostery), only uBlock.

The only external scripts on these pages are Google Analytics -- no ads of any kind.

Update travis ci url so the current build status will show properly.
