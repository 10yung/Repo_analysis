Idea: add support for the [VNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing) protocol. There are two usage scenarios:

1. Act as a VNC server and provide the stream to incoming client connections (VNC viewers).
2. Connect to a VNC viewer running in listen mode and stream to it.

Scenario 2 would be very helpful for our [PalMA](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/PalMA/) software.
I'd be interested in using this on a Nvidia Shield TV.  Possible?
Hi,

very grate app, i use that to teach/show things on android (there are many neet apps for school environments ðŸ˜‰) from my physical device to the big wall. But is it possible to add an H264 mode with additional sound support so it can be also used for high framerates and does not require that much bandwith, our school wifi is much times quite over loaded when 30 pupils are online?

Grate
Hi, Please Add Quick Settings Tiles in Android Nougat (like OpenVPN)
It would be nice if one could run one/both cameras alongside/instead of the screen capture.
