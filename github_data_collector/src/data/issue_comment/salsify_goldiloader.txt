Dear author(s),

I have issue with pack of goldiloader with ActiveStorage.
When i tried to remove something AS or update i fell into "Stack too deep" error.
Through this gem we can disabling goldiloader auto-loading only for associations.
It will be best upgrade for gem if it possible to disabling auto eager loading for AS association. For example something like this:
**"has_many_attached :something, auto_include: :false"**

If u have solution please share.
Best regards.
Is there the ability to set goldiloader to set the whole application to `auto_include(false)` by default? I only want to use goldiloader for certain controller actions. I think I need something like:

```ruby
Goldiloader.config do |config|
 config.auto_include = false
end
```

Then when I want to use it I can do the following

```ruby
@posts = Post.auto_include # preferable
# or
@posts = Post.auto_include(true)
```
