**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
We were using the app and decided to test how it reacted to loss of internet mid use. If we suddenly lost internet connection, there was no feedback.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
We suggest to add a constant Network Manager (a singleton class) that informs the user when he is out of internet. This is just as a reminder, because if a user tries to use the app but doesn’t have internet, he could be waiting forever for it to load.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
We developed a version that works for our apps in Swift 5.0. We tried implementing it in SwiftHub to do a Pull Request but since it’s Swift 4.0, it had some issues. I’m adding some screenshots of our solution. The “Toast” class is simply a way to present messages in a Toast fashion like Android.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
If you are browsing the source code of a repository and you open a file which you didn’t intend to open, the app is completely frozen until it loads or you force close it. This also happens with file extensions which are clearly not supposed to be viewed (such as pdfs, wavs, mp4s, etc). 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A way to stop the load of any file that is not supposed to be open, a simple “Cancel” button while loading.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A cancel button on the loading screen and a check on file extensions which are not supported by SwiftHub.

Some icons (Snapshot below) are hard to understand, i had to press them and take a moment to see what changed to understand what was their purpose.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Perhaps a hover text with a description should be created when the user holds an icon.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
text fields below the icons describing their use. 


**Describe the bug**
Login is not working as expected, text fields should have constraints to prevent app from crashing.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to Login tab
2. Click on Basic login
3. Fill the fields with as many characters as you want, i tried 200.
4. When pressing login button, app will restart.


**Expected behavior**
The textfileds should have constraints to prevent this from happening, i also suggest limiting the characters to a-z,A-Z,0-9, and maybe some special characters.

**Describe the bug**
below method and variable are deprecated from 5.1.0.
- tapHandler
- yOffset

But currently SwiftHub using 5.0.3, and it will crash while app launch.
if comment out the tapHandler. and change the yOffset to the new var --> titlePositionAdjustment.vertical
