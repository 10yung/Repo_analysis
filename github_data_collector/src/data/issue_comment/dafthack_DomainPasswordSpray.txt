Hello,

I noticed when running in a loop with multiple domains it will fail. I solved this by commenting out the lines below as they will change the context from the provided $domain variable to actually pulling the current domain in the context of the powershell.exe window.

    $DirEntry = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry
    $UserSearcher.SearchRoot = $DirEntry


The title is a presumption of what the issue is based on my results below. It appears that when you have a password file, and a password within that file contains spaces, it does not return proper results (false negative).

In this sample, I'm using a PasswordList containing a single line, "a soapsud Touts the climber3". Note that there is no success message.
```
PS C:\Users\USER\Desktop\DomainPasswordSpray-master> Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -UserList C:\Users\USER\Desktop\single_user.txt -PasswordList C:\Users\USER\Desktop\single_pass.txt -OutFile C:\Users\USER\Desktop\results.txt -Debug

```

In this sample, I've tried the same user and same password, but now I'm using the password in-line and enclosed in quotes. This time there is a success message.
```

Change `Get-ObservationWindow` to grab the `lockoutObservationWindow` value directly from AD, in order to avoid commandline-based detections of `net accounts /domain` being run
I'm pretty sure this is my bug. Sorry.
â€¦ pwdLastSet date.

Added several parameters to handle generation of passwords based on the pwdLastSet active directory attribute. Guess formats include:

SeasonYY
SeasonYYYY
MonYY
MonYYYY
MonthYY
MonthYYYY

Optional switch parameters include functionality to formulate the password as lower case (initial caps is the default) and append characters to the end of the guess for guesses like (Fall2018!).
