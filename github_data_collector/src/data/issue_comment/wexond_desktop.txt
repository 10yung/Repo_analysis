The do not track option in most modern browsers shows websites a user does not want to be tracked, resulting in slightly better privacy. I'd like to use this feature, but sadly it is not included in wexond

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Implement a checkbox in the settings affecting both the DNT-header as well as the JavaScript function "navigator.doNotTrack" (both testable at [https://browserleaks.com/donottrack](https://browserleaks.com/donottrack))

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
None.

**Additional context**
None.

Right now, any downloaded .crx file is installed automatically.
It would be good to first show the user what extension wants to install (with name, icon, permissions, etc).

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A dialog appears, asking the user whether they want to install the application or not.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
None.

**Additional context**
None.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
More and more applications are becoming Progressive Web Apps, which most browsers can install.
I use some of those apps often, so support for installing them would be nice.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Full PWA support.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
None.

**Additional context**
None.
**Bug description**
Some web pages seem to have a transparent background. These pages have an issue with the browser not blanking the window after switching to another tab.

**To Reproduce**
Go to a site using a transparent background (ex. [https://materializecss.com/](https://materializecss.com/) )

**Expected behavior**
The page has a white background.

I think it is a very useful feature that I can drag files into the navbar in most browsers, which opens these files in a new tab. Wexond should also support this.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
When dragging a file into the navbar of the browser, it is opened in a new tab, like in most browsers.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
None.

**Additional context**
None.

**Bug description**
When right-clicking a link and opening it in a new tab in the developer tools, nothing happens.

**To Reproduce**

- Right-click the link

**Expected behavior**
The link is opened in a new tab.

**Screenshots**
None.

**Details:**
 - Operating System: Manjaro Linux
 - Wexond version: master (As time of writing)

**Additional context**

Most other browsers allow me to drag tabs out of the window, either to create a new tab or to put the tab into the other window. This is very intuitive and fast to use, so I'd love to see it in wexond.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
One can drag a browser tab out of the window to create a new window and drag a tab into another window to put it there.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
None.

**Additional context**
None.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Other browsers allow me to clear:
- Cookies
- Website settings (ex. websites I granted access to my location)
- AutoFill data

Also, other browsers allow me to clear data only in a specific time span.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
When clicking the "Clear browsing data" button, a dialog appears, asking for the time span and shows options what to clear.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
The "Clear browsing data" button just clears everything without an additional dialog.

**Additional context**
None.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Most browsers prevent websites from autoplaying media and sound automatically, by default.
When I, for example, open multiple youtube-videos in different tabs, I think it is very disturbing to see this non-standard behavour.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
By default, all media is prevented from playing automatically.
Via the settings, one is able to change the default behaviour.
Also, an option to change the behaviour per-site would be very nice.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
None.

**Additional context**
None.
When wexond is opened, it will check in the background if your credentials were leaked.
