I met with an problem when i try to import the program with intellij idea.

The error i encountered is 

`[error] java.io.FileNotFoundException: F:\NewFolder\code\final\akka-streams-example\target\resolution-cache\akka-reddit-wordcount\akka-reddit-wordcount_2.11\0.1.0 \resolved.xml.xml (系统找不到指定的路径。)`

i found that the version in build.sbt is that 

`version := "0.1.0 "`

maybe the version should be changed to "0.1.0"?
(sorry,my English is a little bad.)

I implemented the RedditAPI calls using akka-http
If it is useful I can submit a pull request, otherwise just posting here for reference
