I'm interested in using modules within my own project and the ability to define this as a dependency package 
Hi,

NotificationCenter integration?



Looks like you're tracking requests here - have you considered adding for UITextView?
Example
```
button.onTap(handler:{
    // do stuff
})
```

How do I clear this handler to avoid a leak when my VC is deallocated?
It would be reaaaaally nice to have life cycle methods:
viewDidLoad
will/did appear/disappear
etc.

Thanks for this nice kit!
