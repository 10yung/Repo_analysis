Do you have the official version? Sounds more like a bug in your launcher...

I am getting popup Fullscreen ads!
I removed and checked the ads are gone but when i install the framework i get ads after 24 hrs.
Please explain me this problem!
I've added new localization from the English and translated it to Dutch
A simple fix to accommodate the changes made by @rovo89 whereas he had enforced HTTPS on the server, but the HttpURLConnection class used by the Xposed Installer has issues with following redirects from HTTP to HTTPS.

I'm getting this error message when attempting to download or update Xposed modules in the Xposed Installer: 
> Downloading http://dl.xposed.info/repo.xml.gz failed: 302 (Moved Temporarily)

Using:  
Xposed Installer v2.6.1  
KitKat 4.4.2  

I've cleared the app data of the Xposed Installer, but it didn't resolve the issue.
Hey, it is not an issue but a question, I don't know how to reach you so I just typed it here:

I would like to ask to have xposed module working, do we have to use xposed installer?
Is there a way that we create a module; add it into target app's memory(I can sideload the apk as a zip and use reflection to get all the functions) and invoke `handleLoadPackage` directly?

I ask this because I am working on an research idea, here is what I did:
I sideloaded xposedbridge.jar to the target app's memory;
I wrote a simple module and sideload it to the memory as well(by using DexClassLoader).

Now I am stuck at this:
I would need to invoke `handleLoadPackage`from our module.apk using reflection; I got the function  handle but I would need to get the `llparam` to `invoke` it. 
I tried using reflection to get the static field `sLoadedPackageCallbacks` from `xposedbridge` and calling `new LoadPackageParam(sLoadedPackageCallbacks)` to instantiate the `llparam`, but it does not work.

Any ideas about this? Let me know if you need more information, I am glad to email/DM you somewhere with details.
It isn't immediately clear what license this project is under.
