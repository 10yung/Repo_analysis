When input rosdep install turtlesim, the error message below shows up. It seems that the std_srvs should be defined. Where can I find this? 

ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
turtlesim: No definition of [std_srvs] for OS [windows]

I tried the command below. The error message is stills there.
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=${ROS_DISTRO} -y --os=windows:xenial

I could not find the 2dnav_pr2 with rospack find and tried to install the package with choco install ros-melodic-2dnav-pr2. But it does not work.

Hi! I am working on a robotics project where I need to reconstruct a 3D image from monocular vision. I have planned to reconstruct 3D image from depth map. For this purpose, I have installed lsd-slam and ran examples successfully. Now my question is, is it possible to calculate actual distance of each point of an image from it's depth map that is generated from lsd-slam? 
fatal error: lsd_slam_viewer/LSDSLAMViewerParamsConfig.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.

Hi, I need a help in CNN SLAM. Is there anyone who already have the experience with CNN SLAM. I will be grateful. 
When I do rosmake lsd_slam while following the installation instructions I get this output in the console. How do I fix it?

Hello, I am trying to create a 3D thermal map as per the paper: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fe3a/9b89c0adcacb95581ad2e528e86b7d18c1f0.pdf
I am using an RGB camera Orbbec Astra and a FLIR E40 and they have been calibrated (intrinsic and extrinsic)
The process to create a corresponding thermal map is simple. For a keyframe: consider a pixel, get its 3D coordinates in the RGB camera frame using the inverse depth map. 
Using the extrinsic parameters, get the point in the thermal camera frame and reproject the point into the thermal image using its intrinsic matrix. The value of the image will give us the thermal value of the pixel of the image. 

Now, I have been looking into the LSD SLAM-core code and used Doxygen as well to understand it better. However, I'm unable to determine where and how do I start making changes to the code to get this thing working.

Any help would really be appreciated as I have a deadline for the same in a month.

Thanks
