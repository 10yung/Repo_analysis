Looks like there is two forward slashes. It's not breaking anything but it shouldn't be there.

@borekb as discussed [in Gitter](https://gitter.im/versionpress/versionpress?at=5d249fafd0e06b6675746d03).

To make third party plugins that use a custom database prefix (different than `$wpdb->prefix`) compatible with VersionPress, you can now define a property `prefix` in `schema.yml` in order to prefix the table name of the entity with a custom one.
Links to several plugin definitions by community members have been added as well.
I tried to create a wordpress docker image with versionpress on it. I'm only interested on versionpress files so I created a mount point of git on wordpress root folder (/var/www/html/.git) and versionpress db folder (vpdb) on wp-content folder (/var/www/html/wp-content/vpdb).

On the checklist says `This website is already versioned in Git` even though the .git folder and vpdb is empty.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8968902/59729888-d640aa80-9272-11e9-8548-4959ea683691.png)

And also when i tried to activate it, it will try to delete the mounted folders which throws an error since it is not a normal folder.

I'm proposing is instead of deleting the folder, it should only delete the files inside it.

Another thing is when the docker image is deployed under a load balancer, it will not be successfully activated because mostly of the load balancers have limits on response time.

Please take the above situations on your design so that versionpress can be used on docker images.

More power and God bless us all.
