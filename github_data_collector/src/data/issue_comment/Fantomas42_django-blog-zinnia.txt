I have not been able to trigger it myself, but I have seen it happen frequently in our error logs, especially with crawlers/security tests.
# Actual behavior
A new migration is created on Django 2.1/2.2 when manage.py makemigrations is run:

```
# Generated by Django 2.2.7 on 2019-11-22 21:11

from django.db import migrations, models


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('zinnia', '0004_on_delete_arg'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.AlterField(
            model_name='category',
            name='level',
            field=models.PositiveIntegerField(editable=False),
        ),
        migrations.AlterField(
            model_name='category',
            name='lft',
            field=models.PositiveIntegerField(editable=False),
        ),
        migrations.AlterField(
            model_name='category',
            name='rght',
            field=models.PositiveIntegerField(editable=False),
        ),
    ]
```

# Expected behavior
No new migration file is created.

# Steps to reproduce the issue

  1. install django 2.2 and zinnia
  2. run manage.py makemigrations
  3. Voila!

# What is the purpose of your *pull request*?

 - [x] Bug fix
 - [ ] New feature

# Proposed changes

The proposed change is *very* simple, and simply checks that the accessed variable is defined.

When setting a password on an entry, you go through the `EntryProtectionMixin`
, which renders an intermediate view (`password`). It uses an extra context attribute to render properly (namely, was the password correct). Hoever, it completely overrides the context, making all your context processors missing.

# Actual behavior

Missing context values. It ends up as
```
context = [{'True': True, 'False': False, 'None': None}, {}, {}, {'error': False}]
```

# Expected behavior

We have access to the whole context in the password view, with an extra attribute called "error".


# Steps to reproduce the issue

  1. Create en entry with a password
  2. Try to access something provided by context processors in the template that is not `error`
  3. Get a KeyError
