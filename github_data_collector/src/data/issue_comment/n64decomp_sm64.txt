First of all, many thanks for this invaluable project that non only it documents SM64's code, but also that it allows better hacks and translations.

Speaking of the last, I'd love to localize SM64 Shindou Edition in my language so that my fellow countrymen could play SM64 but this time also with rumble support.

But I don't see any word about the special edition, do you guys have any plan to reverse-engineer it?

Thanks again.
