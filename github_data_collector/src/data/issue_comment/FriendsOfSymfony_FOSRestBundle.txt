Partly reverts https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle/pull/2035 as version 2.x of this bundle is not compatible with Symfony 5.
Hello!
Now there are different options for messages like minWidthMessage, minPixelsMessage and so on.
But when using FOSRestBundle, validation message returns in very ugly way:

"Parameter "document" of value "Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\UploadedFile::__set_state(array(\n 'test' => false,\n 'originalName' => 'shedevr.png',\n 'mimeType' => 'application/octet-stream
',\n 'error' => 0,\n))" violated a constraint "The image width is too small (128px). Minimum width expected is 500px.""

And it's not catchable.
Does anybody know how to return just a text message "The image width is too small (128px). Minimum width expected is 500px." without technical info?
Hi guys !

I have some issues with my symfony project since few months. I have posted a message on  SensionFrameworkExtraBundle but since noone answered yet, I'm posting here a link to the original question : 
https://github.com/sensiolabs/SensioFrameworkExtraBundle/issues/649

So far the workaround seems to be to downgrade the version of SensionFrameworkExtraBundle but it could be cool if someone has an idea to solve this.

Tanks ! :)
We did update some projects for Symfony 4.4, but by this we also updated this bundle. This changed json responses; now null values are getting filtered. This was not expected for 2.5.0 => 2.6.0.

The default of this bundle was never different but did not working so fare:

```
    serializer:
        serialize_null:       false
```

So the default configuration is now working via the fix:

- https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle/issues/1996
- https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle/issues/922
- https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle/commit/54758949bff9fc520997415341323eebf3f54892

Maybe there should the consideration to change the default value inside 2.x and provide it correct inside 3.x.

This seems to be fixed in #2036; however, this is not merged yet.

Fix https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle/issues/2031
This bundle currently has integration with with the symfony `ExceptionListener` here:

https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle/blob/7705fa0af878f28d56a182dea4f18c1e0ab9cbbb/EventListener/ExceptionListener.php

In symfony 4.4 this class is [deprecated](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/a8a9e69488fdaf609fecacba66e056ffb8f25da8/src/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/EventListener/ExceptionListener.php#L28) in favor of [ErrorListener](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/a8a9e69488fdaf609fecacba66e056ffb8f25da8/src/Symfony/Component/Console/EventListener/ErrorListener.php).

A [Compiler Pass](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/a8a9e69488fdaf609fecacba66e056ffb8f25da8/src/Symfony/Bundle/TwigBundle/DependencyInjection/Compiler/ExceptionListenerPass.php) is used to use either one or the other.

This bundle needs support for both eventualities/listeners.
