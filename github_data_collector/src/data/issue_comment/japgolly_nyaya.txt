- [ ] Replace Scalaz by [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/)
- [ ] Make sure all dependencies are available in all platforms
- [ ] Employ [sbt-crossproject](https://github.com/scala-native/sbt-crossproject)
- [ ] Get rid of .scala sources under project folder; build.sbt should suffice.

Other libraries (like Boopickle) are depending on Nyaya, so it would be great to have a version published for 1.0.0-M1 so that these libraries can also be published for 1.0.0-M1.
