The matlab code in sr_extract_plane.m invoking source/EdgeDetectTest.exe generates only partial info 
vx	vy	vz	score	numLines
-0.99157554	0.12952947	0.00024355	650.54	47
0.76044877	-0.64939690	-0.00115497	488.17	39
-0.43647291	0.89971575	0.00172559	331.19	31
But expected is 4KB file as present in "cache\vpdetection\text\img_100_SRF_2_LR-vanishingpoints.txt"
The start , end and length of lines in 3 sets not present.
Tried in x64 machine.
Behavior in matlab code and CMD for the source/EdgeDetectTest.exe is same.
Any suggestion?
Thanks !
Hi,

First of all, thank you for the excellent work and code! I was trying to evaluate my own method with you quantification script. But there seems to be an error in the function compute_difference.m

At some point in the code the function tries to use variable warpedImage:

```
% Compute Structural similarity index (SSIM index)
45	% =========================================================================
46	[ssim, ~] = ssim_index(imgt, warpedImage);
…	
49	% Compute information fidelity criterion (IFC)
50	% =========================================================================
51	ifc = ifcvec(imgt, warpedImage);
```

But warpedImage was not defined before. I am guessing it should just be replaced with 'im' such that the code becomes
```
% Compute Structural similarity index (SSIM index)
45	% =========================================================================
46	[ssim, ~] = ssim_index(imgt, im);
…	
49	% Compute information fidelity criterion (IFC)
50	% =========================================================================
51	ifc = ifcvec(imgt, im);
```

Is this correct, or did you intend to have another preprocessing step which produces warpedImage?

Thanks again for the great work!

Cheers
hi all!
the code needs to execute EdgeDetectTest.exe , so it needs Windows SO. Is there a workaround or can anyone give the exe source code  so that I can compile it on linux? If not, anyone could give me another solution?
tnx

Hello,
The cvpr paper is an excellent work and I tried to run the code. However, it appears errors as follows.
??? Undefined variable "vision" or class "vision.ShapeInserter".

Error in ==> sr_extract_plane>sr_detect_plane_from_vp at 179
shapeInserter = vision.ShapeInserter('Shape', 'Lines','BorderColor', 'White');

Error in ==> sr_extract_plane at 48
modelPlane = sr_detect_plane_from_vp(vpData, img, opt);

Error in ==> sr_demo at 38
modelPlane = sr_extract_plane(filePath.dataPath, filePath.imgFileName, opt);

Error in ==> sr_demo_batch at 63
                imgHiRes = sr_demo(filePath, opt);

It seems some code were missing or I made some  mistakes to miss something. Would you help me solve it .Thank you very much! @jbhuang0604
