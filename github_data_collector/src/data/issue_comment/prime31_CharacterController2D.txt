## Issues
When changing Time.timeScale, the raycast on the ground doesn't work properly. It keeps bounce the character back above.

Normal (Time.timeScale = 1f)

Wrong (Time.timeScale = 0.2f)

Additionally, if the framerate is not capped to 60, the bouncing effect will be even more obvious.

## Possible Problem
When checking CharacterController2D.cs, in moveVertically(ref deltaMovement) function, something weird happens there.
deltaMovement.y was set to be skinWidth. Which possibly means the origins of raycast are set up wrong.
No idea why this only happens when Time.timeScale goes low.
Apparently the the ray distance is so small, that eventually the skin layer is already beneath the platform. It make sense to bounce it back to the surface, however, I don't know why it keeps going up instead of stops there.

Thank you very much for developing such a brilliant plugin!

Hi,

Since all objects change the same Physics2D matrix for collisions upon entering Play mode, if one character, like player, set some layers for trigger under CC2D's Trigger Mask, they will be overridden by any other character like enemies having different config for the same thing.

For example currently Player has Layers 1, 2 and 3 set in it's Trigger Mask and Enemy has Layer 4 and when I launch the game and see Physics 2D matrix, I can see Player collision matrix overridden by Enemy's. Hope I've made myself clear. From 

Is CC2D is designed with only main character using it in mind or am I missing something here? Any workarounds?

Thanks.
If you are on a slope and the top of the player collider hits another one way platform, it will push you down until you fall off of the slope.
Hi!
For some reason the "slope sticking" when going down slope doesn't work when going around on SpriteShapes. I still move horizontally that causes the body to "float" often. With fast enough speed (default 8), sometimes i can't jump when walking downhill because it's not grounded
I tried debug ray the resulting slope, it looks correct like when walking on BoxColliders. So, i'm not sure what's causing this.
The added downward deltamovement.y is also the same
How else can i try to figure out how to debug this?
Or, have anyone figured out how to make it work with SpriteShape?
Hi, when call Warp To Ground method from other script in OnStart() function Unity freeze always after click play game.

During some debug i'll found the problem. In the while loop the movement still continue infinitly with IsGrounded always false.

This problem occur only when in the Unity Project settings Physics2D AutoSyncTransform is set to False. If turn it to True the problem not exists. But, i need to turn off this settings for some reasons in my project.

Thanks
I'm having a glitch with Tilemap Colliders where if the player gets "caught" on the edge of a tile, they will slowly start rising up to the closest surface.

Any plan for ECS version?
Removes requirement of RigidBody2D as is no longer being used by the character controller.
The enemies in my game are regular enemies, but don't collide with the character. As far as I can see, this is supposed to work like that because of the nature of the character controller. So how do I detect when I have collided with the enemy? I just want for rigid bodies that collide with the character (player) to get the event OnCollisionEnter2D. Is there a way to do that?
Is this line in moveVertically only because CharacterController2D supports slopes?

if( ( isGoingUp && !collisionState.wasGroundedLastFrame ) || ignoreOneWayPlatformsThisFrame )
			mask &= ~oneWayPlatformMask;


In our game it causes wrong kind of movements because when player jumps he hits OneWayPlatform and jump stay short because of that. Is there any drawback if we leave it like this? (we don't need slopes)

if( isGoingUp || ignoreOneWayPlatformsThisFrame )
			mask &= ~oneWayPlatformMask;
