â€¦ the Chinese version

The document still remains little translationese.
I was goofing around with JS weirdness today, and I found this behaviour, which took me some time to explain to myself. Maybe it could be included in the file? 

It started off with the basic type coercion, which worked as expected:
```js
1 == true
// true
0 == false
// true
```
My initial assumption was that the value is cast to `Boolean`. For this simple example, that assumption would hold
```js
Boolean(1)
// true
Boolean(0)
// false
```

But it broke when trying the following:
```js
1.1 == true
// false
```

Given my original assumption, I was a bit confused because I know `Boolean(1.1) -> true`. 

But the true explanation to the first snippet is:
```js
Number(true)
// 1
Number(false)
// 0
```
Meaning that `true`/`false` is cast to and compared as `Number`. 
I am able to translate this language
Translation ready! 

Notes: 
- didn't translate the text of links with no French translations: so the user knows before clicking on the link that this content will be in English. 
- added a link in the `README.md` for the French translation, but not in the `README-zh-cn.md` file as the Translations block seems to have been omitted.
I am able to translate this language [yes]
I am able to translate this language! I'll start working on it =)
