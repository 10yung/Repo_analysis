GitHub changed the way Markdown headings are parsed, so this change fixes it.

Hi there,

I took your project as the base of a video tutorial about **how to organize the Gradle dependencies** and this is the result, I did a [Pull Request](https://github.com/arturogutierrez/kotlin-dagger-example/pull/1) for my fork with the changes but I'm also sending to you in case you're interested.

Feel free to close it if you are not interested.
Updated to Android API 25, Kotlin 1.0.5 and added latest RxJava to the build (as suggested by RxAndroid).
