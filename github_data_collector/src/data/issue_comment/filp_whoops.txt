We intend to follow up this issue with a pull request, if there is community interest. The purpose of this issue is to assess whether or not there is community interest.

[paragonie/corner](https://github.com/paragonie/corner) provides an interface and an accompanying trait to offer an [extended API](https://github.com/paragonie/corner#corners-extended-exception-api) to facilitate [high-quality error messages](https://twitter.com/acfoltzer/status/1074813646625169408).

If there is any interest, we'd like to send a pull request that automatically exposes the helpful messages if the exception caught by whoops implements `CornerInterface`.

... And that's pretty much it!

What do you think? We want to make PHP error handling more helpful to developers. This should align well with the goal of Whoops.
Reproduce:

Tested PHP version: `7.2.19, 7.3.6, `
Whoops version: `2.3.1`

I recently missed "space" into some configuration file.  With Whoops turned off, php output shows:

```php
php -r "include 'index.php';"
PHP Warning:  Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /home/www/public_html/config/dev/database.php:1)
```

But with Whoops enabled, I have no idea, which file to blame:

```ruby
PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Whoops\Exception\ErrorException: session_set_save_handler(): Cannot change save handler when headers already sent in /home/www/public_html/system/library/session.php:19

Is there something to be done?
taken from a recent travis ci build

```
1) Whoops\Handler\PlainTextHandlerTest::testReturnsWithFramesAndArgsOutput

Test code or tested code did not (only) close its own output buffers

2) Whoops\Handler\PlainTextHandlerTest::testReturnsWithLoggerOnlyOutput

Test code or tested code did not (only) close its own output buffers
```

we should check what we can do about that.
HHVM is used nearly anywhere and since php7 is a thing also doesnt has a real use-case anymore.

it was a great project to boost zend-php though.

we should drop hhvm and php5.x support and cleanup the code-base from hhvm workarounds (and drop hhvm ci).

do you guys agree? If so, I can provide a PR.
