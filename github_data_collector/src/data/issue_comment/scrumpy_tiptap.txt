Hello! 

I have some problems with customizing image alternative attributes.

After adding image into editor, i found how to get selected image or element node: 
```
const { selection, state } = this.editor
const { from, to } = selection
state.selection.node.attrs
```
But there is no documentation or information, how to edit already added nodes with image. If I try to change its attrs, html doesn't change. May be I need to rerender editor or node, but I don't know how.

Any help would be appretiated:)

As mentioned in title, empty content keeps empty html tags (p, h1, h2, ...), but through Placeholder extension class is added to content container when it's empty. Is there any method on Editor which can check for empty content which returns true/false or at least get content (there are only getHtml and getJSON methods mentioned in docs); based on this I could just update data to an empty string instead of empty html tags.
I can write custom method in my code which checks for content using getJSON result; I was wondering if there is already method for that, but it's missing from docs.

If you use link input within menu bubble, after clicking the input, menu bubble won't hide when clicking outside the menu bubble like usual.

**Steps to Reproduce / Codesandbox Example**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to https://tiptap.scrumpy.io/links
2. Select some text without links
3. Menu bubble appears, click Add Link
4. Input for link will appear on menu bubble
5. Click outside of editor, menu bubble won't hide

**Expected behavior**
Menu bubble hide if click outside editor

**Screenshots**
After link input active, click outside editor trying to dismiss menu bubble (mark with red arrow), but it won't close. Only able to close after placing cursor or selecting on other text.

**Environment**
 - OS: Windows 10 build 19041.1
 - Browser: Mozilla Firefox
 - Version: 71.0
 - Desktop

**Describe the bug**
When using the editor (e.g. using ENTER key) it's not working and we got error in the console:

```
Can not convert <> to a Fragment (looks like multiple versions of prosemirror-model were loaded)
```

Due to `prosemirror-model@1.8.2` and `prosemirror-model@1.9.0` loaded at the same time.

`tiptap-extensions` package requires strictly version `1.8.2` and other packages `prosemirror-model@^1.0.0, prosemirror-model@^1.1.0, prosemirror-model@^1.8.1` which resolves to `1.9.0`

**Steps to Reproduce / Codesandbox Example**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. install 
```
"tiptap": "^1.26.6",
"tiptap-extensions": "^1.28.6"
```
with Yarn. This will install `prosemirror-model@1.8.2` and `prosemirror-model@1.9.0`. 

2. When using the editor (e.g. using ENTER key) it's not working and we got error in the console

**Expected behavior**
Editor should work, there should be only one `prosemirror-model` package installed.


**Quick and dirty workaround** for users (it's not proper fix!) - use `resolutions` entry in `package.json`:
```
    "resolutions": {
        "prosemirror-model": "1.8.2"
    }
```
and install packages again.
This is in reference to https://github.com/scrumpy/tiptap/issues/69, which is closed but is still relevant for any project that requires a strict CSP (content security policy), such as a Chrome Extension or many enterprise apps.

Having both a render function and the template is required, as having only a render(h) causes errors with converting the node to JSON. It also makes the render(h) function more legible, as you have something to reference when reading the render(h) function. 

In that file, I added a comment that should further document why the render(h) function is embedded. 

How handle onselect event in Editor?? I added the links addition component from this [example](https://github.com/scrumpy/tiptap/blob/master/examples/Components/Routes/Links/index.vue).

But the `<editor-menu-bubble>` doesn't activate automatically when `onselect`

I found 1 solution for Double Click Event [here](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#view.EditorProps.handleDoubleClick).

Help me find a solution for onselect event handling.

My code from editorProps:

```
handleDoubleClick: () => {
    this.$emit('textSelectedEditor');
    this.onSelect();
}
```
My method onSelect:

```
onSelect() {
   this.linkMenuIsActive = true
}
```
The menu is now activated by component property `linkMenuIsActive`.
Hey, I got stuck with a small issue. I've been using TipTap with html pasted, something like: 

`this.html = myhtml` And then `this.editor.setContent(this.html)`

It always worked pretty good.

But now I found out that the editor removes all span tags.

Like in the beginning it would be `<p>Some text <span class="someclass">some text</span></p>` 

But after I got only `<p>Some text <span class="someclass">some text</span></p>`

Could anyone tell me how I can solve this, please?
I'm struggling with how to do this:

```
<figure class="is-left">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="alt text">
  <figcaption>Caption for image goes here</figcaption>
</figure>
```

The things I want to achieve here is to: 
* upload an image
* put it inside a figure element in the document
* be able to set a class on the figure element (for example is-left, is-centered, is-right)
* be able to write a caption for the image
* be able to add an alt-text for the image

I guess it involves creating a schema for &lt;figure&gt; but I have a hard time understanding how schemas work in general and with nested elements in particular. 

Has anyone done something similar to this and/or have some example code to show? I would really appreciate any help!
