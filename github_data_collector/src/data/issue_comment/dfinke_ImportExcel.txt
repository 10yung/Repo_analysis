To be clear.. this is picking nits...

Defaults are CSV

example reads:

    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------

    PS C:\>ConvertFrom-ExcelSheet .\TestSheets.xlsx .\data

    Reads each sheet in TestSheets.xlsx and outputs it to the data directory as the sheet name with the extension .txt




    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------

    PS C:\>ConvertFrom-ExcelSheet .\TestSheets.xlsx .\data sheet?0

    Reads and outputs sheets like Sheet10 and Sheet20 form TestSheets.xlsx and outputs it to the data directory as the sheet name with the extension .txt
Can I use this module to find something in Excel?
I want to do import-Excel | Where {$_. ------ }
And Then I want to update the records in Excel 

Does this module support this?

How to give a fixed interval of 00:05 seconds in this case. so that graph not looks linear


The range of MoreValidationParams  should be 'D2:D1001' instead of 'F2:F1001'.
I am switching from W7 to Server 2016 for work. Om my pc this function works without any problem, but on Server 2016 Export-Excel produces max empty rows in sheets. Together with this the coloring of rows --->  Where-Object {$_ % 2 -eq 1}   ----> does not work anymore, all is colored grey instead of odd rows. Powershell version 5.1 on both so I can not pinpoint the problem.


Using part of the data from one of the examples
```
----------------------------------------------
    | File: Movies.xlsx     -      Sheet: Actors |
    ----------------------------------------------
    |           A           B            C       |
    |1     First Name    Last Name    Address    |
    |2     Chuck         Norris       California |
    |3     Jean-Claude   Vandamme     Brussels   |

But in Excel the Second Line/Row is hidden

When I do import Excel I expect to only see only Jean-claude but I get both Chuck and Jean-Claude.

This is an account tracking sheet that I need to maintain account history but I do not always want to see it so we hide a row.  How can I make sure that I am only getting active (AKA Visible Accounts)

I have tried using open-excelpackage and import-excel and they both show all data.

Any advise is greatly appreciated.  Thanks

It looks as if **Conditional Formatting** with an **Expression** is not working correctly.
The rule is added but not applied.
When opening the spreadsheet, going to Conditional Formatting and opening the rule in Edit without changing anything, the rule is applied.

ImportExcel 7.0.1

PS: the value for ConditionValue is apparently accepted with a '=' in front and without.
Is that on purpose?

Code to demonstrate

```powershell
$xlsxName = '.\report.xlsx'
$wsName = 'TestSheet1'
$data = @'
Field1,Field2,Field3
1,2,A
3,2,B
4,4,C
5,10,D
6,3,E
'@

$sExport = @{
    Path = $xlsxName
    WorksheetName = $wsName
    ClearSheet = $true
    FreezeTopRow = $true
    AutoNameRange = $true
    AutoSize = $true
    TitleBold = $true
    PassThru = $true
}
$excel = ConvertFrom-Csv -InputObject $data | Export-Excel @sExport

$sCond = @{
    WorkSheet = $excel.Workbook.Worksheets[$wsName]
    RuleType = 'Expression'
    ConditionValue = 'IF(NUMBERVALUE(A2)>NUMBERVALUE(B2),TRUE,FALSE)'
    BackgroundColor = 'yellow'
    Range = 'C2:C6'
}
Add-ConditionalFormatting @sCond

Close-ExcelPackage -ExcelPackage $excel -Show
```
The expression after '&' in a pipeline element produced an object that was not valid. It must result in a command name, a script block, or a CommandInfo object.

I am now having to look at/review an alternative as I am on a time crunch with the project I am working on.

Even if there is an older version where this isn't an issue please let me know so I can use that while you fix the current one.
I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to apply conditional formatting rules to a pivot table. I did a search of open issues and found this comment. Am I interpreting it correctly that I can't use this module for such a task?

>Sorry.  I tried to answer your original question without testing it, and I've ended up misleading you.

>Because the way pivot tables are handled, there is no data in target sheet until you open the file in Excel and it processes the Pivot table, and this will cause all the formatting functions to fail
>You can use

>$Pkg.ProgramsPivotTable .Row(2).style.font.bold  = $true
>$Pkg.ProgramsPivotTable .Row(2).style.textRotation = 90 
>```
>But when the pivot table is created it will have a table style applied to it so the part of row 2 outside the table will get the formatting, but the bit you want won't. 
>Unfortunately the scope to format a pivot table, is limited to number format and table style.

dear all, i have a worksheet and format as table with such code:
```
![exp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31000620/70489857-ca55e700-1b37-11ea-947a-9559ae6b4816.png)

$file = "C:\Users\admin\Documents\testfor billing.xlsx"
$excel = Export-excel $file -WorksheetName sheet1 -AutoSize -PassThru
$ws = $excel.Workbook.Worksheets['sheet1']
#echo $ws.Name.ToString()
$dataArea = $ws.Dimension.Address
Add-ExcelTable -Range $ws.Cells[$DataArea] -TableStyle Medium1 -TableName invioce -TotalSettings @{"Server price" = "Sum"; "sum" = "Sum";"Storage price" = "Sum"} -ShowHeader:$true -ShowFilter:$false  -ShowTotal:$true
Close-ExcelPackage $excel
```
I have 2 questions:
1. Now i need to add "Total" in the first cell of subtotal row. i tried 'Set-Format' command, but i can't set the value. not this command?
2. i don't find a command to get the SUM value of subtotal, return's null. can we get the SUM values of subtotal?
