Hi,
Do we need to normalize the images of Facescrub and Megaface before feeding them to the model to get features? Thank you for reading.
Hi Feng @happynear ,
    Thanks for your efforts in FaceVerification, I'm currently trying to utilize ur code in Megaface dataset to measure ur AMSoftmax model,  since I use Ubuntu OS and caffe, I tested MTCNN on Linux which is all good , but I find that you are using a MTCNN windows project to finish align_facescrub.m , the hint you gave was 
`MatMTCNN. If you are not using Windows, you need to modify some of the codes to directly use the Matlab version of MTCNN. If you have done such a work, I'm glad to merge your codes.`  However I'm a little bit confused on these words,  what's the difference between MTCNN and MatCNN?  Also the [code](https://github.com/wy1iu/sphereface/blob/master/preprocess/code/face_detect_demo.m) in sphereface alignment use MTCNN(but v1 not v2), if I use MTCNN model in original repo, will the result  be the same? Or do you have any clues on how can I directly use the Matlab version of MTCNN? If you have the code, could you share it with me ? Many thanks.
Can any big-old help me?

The link of washed up list for casia is dead.
Can u upload a new one? 
Thanks!
Hello, I have some questions about the draw_curve.m code.
I just copy the code and use it in my computer. I changed the 'result_folder' and the 'feature_suffix'. But when I ran the code, I can not see the curve about the cmc.
The results are as follows:

So, how can I solve the problem. Thank you very much.
  Hi, I am curious how to use JointBayesian.m (I want to use the problem like this: run JointBayesian.m inputimage1.jpg inputimage2.jpg  and then it returns same or not). I've read the paper Bayesian Face Revisited: A Joint Formulation, it seems that I should first extract lbp features or LE features which I don't know how to do it. By the way, I have the pairlist_lfw.mat and get 89% accuracy after I run the code, which is not the way I want to use. Can you give me some advice? Thank you.
Hi,I am beginner,in path FaceVerification/BLUFR/demo_pca.m ,in the sixth line  what is blufr_lfw_config.mat,
excuse me, can you  sent the blufr_lfw_config.mat to me? thanks very much.
I used sphereface to extract features and I get rank1: 49%, and I have read another issue similar to my question. But I am confusing that if I can directly normalize the features by (x-min)/(max-min) rather than use the normalize_layer for each image.
I am doing a project on "Face Verification(Joint Bayesian) using transfer learning" in python. From where can I download lbp_WDRef.mat, id_WDRef.mat, pairlist_lfw.mat and lbp_lfw.mat files?
Hello,
I have the computational resource.
I can train the siamese network if you are willing to share the database and script.
Sorry for writing as an issue, couldn't find any other way to reach you
