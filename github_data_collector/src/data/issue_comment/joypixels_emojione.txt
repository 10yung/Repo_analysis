  I chose to complete the emoticon by passing the method `$('#content'). Data("emojioneArea"). getText()` gets the content, but the actual expression is not correct.

  An error occurred when I inserted the data table.

  Please Help me, Thank you

Escape `shortname` before matching against `ns.shortnames`.

I've Xiaomi Mi 9 with Android 
I would change to Emojione but when I install ttf for Android, the number character (0,1,2,3...) Change to orange emoji.
It's for that, I want fusion with Emojione and another police to text. Who can I do?
(Sorry to my bad English, I'm French)
I've been using emojione since v3 on my Android phone in different ways. From renaming and replacing the font in system/fonts to using the Magisk module and it's worked every time for the tens of times I've done it. But with v4.5 it doesn't work on Android 5 in any ways and all I see is black simple ones from the phone fonts itself. I've tried both the replacing way and Magisk module but it's not working. Surprisingly it works with no problem when I do it on Android 7.1.2 LineageOS custom rom.
I contacted Emojione support team and they advised me to submit my issue here and also to ask for help from @maximbaz in this case
Thanks
When I use the iOS font within my app (after changing the font family name as referenced in #363  to make it work), number characters are incorrectly mapped to emoji characters corresponding to the numbers, so instead of 1, 2, 3, etc... the font renders: 1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣

This is difficult to work around and the font should not convert plaintext numbers to their emoji equivalents.
Can EmojiOne be used in a Flutter app / with Dart?
If no, then what are the alternatives that work well across iOS and Android? 
# Why is this change needed?

Emojione does not replace emojis that are inside an `<object>` or `<span>` tag. This can be problematic in some scenarios. In our case this is problematic when processing content generated by an editor (TinyMCE), since the editor generates spans to format text.

I don't understand the reasons for avoiding the content inside these tags, but in our case removing them does not cause any problem and solve these issues.

# What's the change

The change makes the part of the regexes that match HTML configurable, so that by default it keeps the same behaviour but, if wanted, a new regex can be provided. In our case, the same regex without the <span> part.

The ugly part is that when the HTML regex is changed, the other regexes need to be recomputed, that's why I added the `computeRegexes` method, so you would use it like:

```
emojione.htmlRegexp = "<object[^>]*>.*?</object>|<(?:object|embed|svg|img|div|span|p|a)[^>]*>";
emojione.computeRegexes();
```

Making this more clean would require moving all the regexes inside methods and that's a bigger change.

The change allows to fix https://github.com/emojione/emojione/issues/537
Just a suggestion on vehicules direction as I've again came across this kind of "visual" blip (see attached screenshot from article https://medium.muz.li/building-better-products-by-exploring-workflows-and-design-processes-81c56659c914) 

Thanks for reading!

Can u fix it? Cant add to live project with these bugs...

Some android devices like Samsung phones have build in support for font customisation. Unfortunately the installation of a new font does not work from a .ttf alone and requires an apk.
I have no experience with programming. Please help @maximbaz
