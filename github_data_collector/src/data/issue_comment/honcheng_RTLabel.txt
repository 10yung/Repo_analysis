+[RTLabel extractTextStyleFromText:paragraphReplacement:] (RTLabel.m:926)
-[__NSCFString replaceOccurrencesOfString:withString:options:range:]: Range {0, 1} out of bounds; string

如富文本包含 color = 'red'  =号两边有空格就会crash, Range越界,必须写成color='red'
When using AutoLayout and building a UIView that contains one or various RTLabel, if you want the size of the UIView to depends on the size of the RTLabel, the RTLabel class needs to be extended in order to override the intrinsicContentSize function to return [self optimumSize].

It would be nice to have this feature added by default in the RTLabel class.
Currently, I have tried RTLabel with Truncating from the last position and found that If Label is multiline then Truncate tail will be applied to all lines. Looks so weird. 
Crash when setText contains @"<f =>" style strings.

can't display @"<ABC>" style strings.

你好 你这有崩溃问题

Only can change textColor when text also changed.

Hi,

I am using Varela Round font through out my project. I downloaded this library and added the VarelaRound-Regular.ttf to the resource folder , included "VarelaRound-Regular.ttf" to the info.plist file under font category.

I tried the following code
        NSMutableDictionary *row2 = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
        [
![screen shot 2015-07-11 at 9 26 38 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5028245/8632206/fdc47c9a-27ae-11e5-9ef5-df5774571f1b.png)
row2 setObject:@"<font face='Varela Round' size=20><u color=blue>underlined</u> <uu color=red>text</uu></font>" forKey:@"text"];
        [self.dataArray addObject:row2];
running this crashes.

The log i get is 
RTLabelProject[3300:70377] **\* Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSRangeException', reason: '-[__NSCFString replaceOccurrencesOfString:withString:options:range:]: Range {0, 1} out of bounds; string length 0'
