d:\Users>jupyter bundlerextension enable --sys-prefix --py dashboards_bundlers
**Error executing Jupyter command 'bundlerextension': [Errno 'jupyter-bundlerextension' not found] 2**

When I try to use conda I get:
d:\Users>conda install jupyter_dashboards_bundlers
Fetching package metadata ...........

**PackageNotFoundError: Package missing in current win-64 channels:**

Close matches found; did you mean one of these?

    jupyter_dashboards_bundlers: jupyter_dashboards

Thank you for your help
I get 500 : Internal Server Error in my browser with 'Deploy as Dashboard on Jupyter Dashboards Server' when notebook contains declarative widgets code.
Works fine otherwise.

Workaround is to manually 'download as Jupyter Dashboards Server bundle(.zip)' and then unizp/upload to server data folder.

All widgets are working once on the server.

Hello, 

I have installed and set up `dashboads_bundlers` with pip without any error (notebook 4.2, python 2.7 on a debian machine). `jupyter_dashboards` and `jupyter_cms` are also installed and running. 
However, the new options 'deploy as' and 'save as Jupyter Dashboards Server bundle' do not appear in the notebook.

I have the following warning: `[W 11:10:03.555 NotebookApp] 404 GET /nbextensions/widgets/notebook/js/extension.js?v=20170109110748 (::1) 1.43ms referer=http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Untitled.ipynb`
do you think it is related?
Thanks
Once a notebook is deployed as a local dashboard, you get 404s in the console on URLs like https://localhost/user/yiqun/files/local_dashboards/hello_world/static/nbextensions/widgets/widgets/css/widgets.min.css Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)

There is no static/nbetensions in my local_dashboards folder.
And according to my experiment, the problem is because my Ipython notebook version is 4.2.0 instead of 4.1.0
