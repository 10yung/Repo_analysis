I can't see any app nor host in Graphana dashboard. What do I need to do to enable MonitoringPlugin?
Thanks for excellent content on this  topic. I'm trying to run the application in the physical server in Ubuntu 14.04. I successfully completed till SBT Stage.

When I attempt to run the application using /common/run-scripts/run-all I'm getting the following error recorded in the log
./run-sales-write-back: line 3: ../../sales/write-back/target/universal/stage/bin/sales-write-back: No such file or directory

Similar errors in the other log files as well. What  could be wrong from my end, Advice.
