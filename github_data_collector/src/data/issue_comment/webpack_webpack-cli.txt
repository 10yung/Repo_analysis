**What kind of change does this PR introduce?**
fix, slight refactor, and some tests

**Did you add tests for your changes?**
Yes

**If relevant, did you update the documentation?**

**Summary**

The `info` package was having problems running with no args. I fixed this, did some slight refactoring, and added a few tests.

It is still unclear to me what the `customArgs` object is in the `info` package. It would help if someone could explain what that is meant for.

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**
no

**Other information**

<!-- Please don't delete this template because we'll close your issue -->
<!-- Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of webpack. -->

# Bug report

<!-- Please ask questions on StackOverflow or the webpack Gitter. -->
<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=webpack -->
<!-- https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack -->
<!-- Issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed. -->

**What is the current behavior?**
When using the `--display verbose` I don't get all output. It is truncated with `+ 2075 hidden modules`

**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
run `webpack --display verbose` on an app with thousands of dependencies

<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->
<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->
<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->
<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->
<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->
<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->

**What is the expected behavior?**
https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/ lists the options as:
> Select display preset (verbose, detailed, normal, minimal, errors-only, none; since webpack 3.0.0)

Since there are different detail levels. I expect verbose to be verbose and list it all.


<!-- "It should work" is not a helpful explanation -->
<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->

> If a webpack.config.js is present, the webpack command picks it up by default. We use the --config option here only to show that you can pass a config of any name. This will be useful for more complex configurations that need to be split into multiple files.

We should also pick it up when a `webpack.config.cjs` is present
**Describe the bug**

Installing webpack-cli@4.0.0-beta.1 still adds the latest webpack @4.x.x to the node_modules folder, even though it directly depends on webpack@^5.0.0-beta.3.

The dependency comes to play via `webpack-cli -> @webpack-cli/init -> @webpack-cli/generators webpack@4.x.x`

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to a new folder
2. npm init
3. accept defaults
4. npm install webpack@5.0.0-beta.11 --save-dev
5. npm install webpack-cli@4.0.0-beta.1 --save-dev

**Expected behavior**
I would expect it to only need the already-installed 5.0.0-beta.11.

**Additional context**
I'm trying to avoid [an issue](https://github.com/fsevents/fsevents/issues/301) with fsevents@1.2.11, which is an optional transitive dependency of webpack@4  (`webpack -> watchpack -> chokidar -> fsevents`). I'm willing to move to the beta of webpack 5 for this particular project, but I'm running into this issue with webpack-cli. With that version of fsevents being dropped into node_modules, I can't ever run `npm ci`, even though we don't actually use anything that would be impacted.

The getPackageManager function of the package-manager module, which was supposed to resolve the
default Package Manager. The expected behaviour is that if yarn is present, yarn is used else npm is
used. However, the logic didnt allow the ideal behaviour. As per the updated logic, we check for
local yarn. If present, we use yarn, else npm is used. Also, the spawn statement is eliminated and
so are the related test statements.

After bootstrapping and building using yarn, I ran the package tests and it returned the erro - **Package manager should spawn npm update from spawnchild**

>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been

> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.
