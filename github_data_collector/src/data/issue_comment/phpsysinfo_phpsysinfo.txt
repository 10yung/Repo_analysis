Hi there,

you can somehow get the raid status of an LSI 3ware raid controller displayed by phpsysinfo. In addition to the Megaraid, which is supported, many LSI 3ware 9xxx controllers are also operated.

The tw_cli ouput at different depths sees e.g. like this:
[tw_cli_output.txt](https://github.com/phpsysinfo/phpsysinfo/files/4070823/tw_cli_output.txt)

That should be able to be evaluated.

Best wishes

With ZFS it lists the filesystems individually, and it can get extremely messy when you have a lot of datasets, a nice feature would be to allow datasets to be collapsible into their parent dataset.  Maybe by any depth past the base dataset.

Example.  I call my pool "stuff"

stuff <= parent/pool
stuff/media <= dataset
stuff/media/movies <= collapsible
stuff/media/tvshows <= collapsible

Hoping to get some opinions on what you think.

Thanks!
Hey, I just want to let you know that phpSysInfo works on a CentOS 7 (almost) fresh install, with SELinux set to enforce, didn't have to mess with anything to get it to work.

Hi,

could you provide the origin of the used gfx files in terms of copyright and license?

First, a big big THANKS for this excellent tool, I'm using it for years for lots of projects and it's simply awesome! :) There's a gimmick I'm thinking about, and I would like to get some feedback here before writing this feature:
1. Load could be shown in page title, getting automatic value update which each refresh cycle.
2. Load could be shown as favion via a simple colour scheme (green, yellow, orange, red) or via some kind of bar graph.

**Advantages**
- user can see current status of multiple servers inside the browser without having to click into each tab
- user can see current status of multiple servers inside the browser even when having the tab "pinned" (which usually shows the favicon)
- could be implemented without touching core logic of phpsysinfo, maybe with a simple config switch

**Disadvantages**
??? (please comment)

Please comment if you like (or close if you thing it's not appropriate here).

Is it possible to check if the phpsysinfo is at the lastest version. Over stock function in php.
