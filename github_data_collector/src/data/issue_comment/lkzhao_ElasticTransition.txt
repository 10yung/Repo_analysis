Hi there, as title, How can I dismiss Menu screen without animation?

Hi,
I have a scrollview in the view controller that is using this library in. It seems I can't scroll through the contents in the scrollview.
Hi, I manually added ElasticTransition, but the effects does not show up!

How to use it manually or with Carthage?!

Please! I love this framework!
