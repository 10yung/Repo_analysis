I couldn't change the default gray color in any way.
Is there an option?


I have a heart image which is transparent from the inner part, when I use fave-button it colors the image itself (only the border line of the heart) which's reasonable because it applies the mark on the image itself, what I need to achieve is to fill the heart with red color for the inner part too, vector image is attached.

I have added constraints that fix bug, when FaveButton is untouchable when it is added to navigation bar as UIBarButtonItem(customView: FaveButton), this problem occurred on iOS 11 and higher.

```Swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, FaveButtonDelegate {
 
    let myButton = FaveButton(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 24, height: 24),
                              faveIconNormal: UIImage(named: "star"))
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        myButton.delegate = self
        navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(customView: myButton)
    }
    
    func faveButton(_ faveButton: FaveButton, didSelected selected: Bool) {
        print("Button pressed!")
    }
}
```

Not compiling in latest swift
I have added `UIButton` inside `UITableViewCell` and I change `UIButton` Class to `FaveButton` and when I set only `Delegate` then Dot animation works but when I create outlet then Dot animation doesn't works, it only show circle animation color.

Please guide me what I am missing?

Thanks

The `didSelected` delegate callback happens after a one second delay so that it matches the animation, but some applications need a callback immediately when the user taps the button. This patch provides the best of both worlds.
Button size not updating for iPad, It takes iPhone button frame.
