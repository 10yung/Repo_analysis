I am observing iCloud changes through `iCloudFilesDidChange` and what I am seeing is that calling `retrieveCloudDocumentWithName` actually triggers` iCloudFilesDidChange`, which causes `iCloudFilesDidChange` to be called over and over again if I call `retrieveCloudDocumentWithName` from within` iCloudFilesDidChange`.

What I want to do is: observe changes on a specific file, if there is a change, download the file and save it locally. However, due to the fact `iCloudFilesDidChange` is called over and over again if I call `retrieveCloudDocumentWithName` from within` iCloudFilesDidChange`, there's no way to stop that.

Maybe I misunderstood something fundamental - if so, sorry... Thanks for any help.
I shared my build with someone and they get stuck on saving (specifically somewhere around here, from what I gathered from my logs:

`// Get the URL to save the new file to`
`NSURL *fileURL = [[self ubiquitousDocumentsDirectoryURL] URLByAppendingPathComponent:documentName];`
`// Initialize a document with that path`
 `iCloudDocument *document = [[iCloudDocument alloc] initWithFileURL:fileURL];`
`document.contents = content;`
`[document updateChangeCount:UIDocumentChangeDone];`

My build works fine on my device, so I can't figure out if there's any cloud setting on their device that I'm missing.
Did anyone else get stuck here?
I rewrote this in Swift.

It's available here: https://github.com/oskarirauta/iCloudSync

Testing if delegate responds to deprecate method twice, when first one should use non-deprecated version at iCloud.m line 693.

if ([self.delegate respondsToSelector:@selector(iCloudFileUploadConflictWithCloudFile:andLocalFile:)]) {

should be:

if ([self.delegate respondsToSelector:@selector(iCloudFileConflictBetweenCloudFile:andLocalFile:)]) {

I tried to upload data.db file to iCloud and it showed uploaded successfully.

And it return YES when I  checked if there's db file in iCloud .

Now I retrieved the documentData by the method ..... retrieveCloudDocumentWithName..., How to transfer the documentData and save it into documents with name data.db?

------------

I got it. It's just for documents not for other files.

I get this error from the method "saveAndCloseDocumentWithName" after the "saveToURL" method.

Error while creating the document: -[iCloud saveAndCloseDocumentWithName:withContent:completion:]_block_invoke

[ERROR] Could not get attribute values for item ~LMD/iCloud~it~overit~iosapps~MyApp/Documents/Others/myfile.xml (n). Error: Error Domain=NSFileProviderInternalErrorDomain Code=1 "The reader is not permitted to access the URL." 
This library worked like a charm under xcode 8 and iOS 10, now that I opened the project with Xcode 9 and iOS 11 iCloud sync is really slow and blocks the main thread a lot. 
I already have tried many approaches like dispatching on a different thread (Not possible by the iCloud API) and trying to make as few syncs as possible... What could it be?
Thanks!
Hi,

I am running my app on iPhone and iPad. When I upload a file from iPhone, it is not appearing in iPad. The files are appearing individually w.r.t device.
I tested it on iOS 10, 11, it always return NO when app is just launched. After about 10s, it will work and return the right value. It's a very serious bug, hope you can look into it.
