Hello,

I'm a PhD student and i tried to compile your detta packages but i get this error :

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "rwth_pedestrian_tracking" with any of the following names:

    rwth_pedestrian_trackingConfig.cmake
    rwth_pedestrian_tracking-config.cmake

I searched in spencer project packages from https://github.com/spencer-project but no results.
This package seems to needed for biternion and skeletons_cnn_pytorch.

Maybe the package name has changed on spencer project?

Thanks for your help,

Best regards
