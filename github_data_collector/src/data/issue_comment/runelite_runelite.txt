There is no need to have the remove option on every furniture piece in your POH when not in building mode. It just adds visual clutter to the right click menu. in my opinion.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The solution would be to remove the 'remove' option from the menu when it is not needed (i.e. when not in building mode)

Closes #10602 

Added a more descriptive solution to the General Bentnoze clue step.
This update swaps the options for Board (slow) and Pay-Fare (fast) on the Brimhaven cart, if the Travel menu entry swapper plugin setting is on.

A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always
frustrated when [...]
Usually it's pretty common to skip through falo's dialog when he's telling you what item, and in some cases you may not recognize what item he's asking for since it's a riddle.
**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
Have the clue solver plugins display what item falo asked for if possible once you go through the dialog so you don't have to go back and reread/google
**Describe alternatives you've considered**

This would help with banking a lot as it would remove the need to right click or keep swapping the default mode when withdrawing a variety of items for farm runs etc.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
An option added to the menu entry swapper plugin that allows holding shift for the 'Withdraw all' option in the bank

I understand this is maybe not possible for technical reasons, but it would be nice especially for the Treasure box storing the numerous clue rewards which can be somewhat difficult to navigate and find the required items.
Currently (afaik) the Plugin Hub only refreshes when you re-launch the client. It's a minor QoL thing but it'd be nice to be able to refresh it in-client to grab plugin updates and new plugins.

Could be a manual refresh or happen automatically (on an interval or when you open the hub menu).

I've seen this kind of plugin on other clients and I'd find it useful, since I do a lot of raids, trying for my own personal pb's, but sometimes its hard to compare few runs as you don't see a breakdown for each room.

I'd like to see a highlighted line, after completing each puzzle/combat room, similar to what TOB has. For example:
Combat room Vanguards complete! Duration: 4:28. Total: 18:10
Puzzle room Thieving complete! Duration: 3:30. Total: 12:01

Times could be highlighted in red, so as to match floor breakdown times, which are on the osrs engine by default.

Currently in CoX you can see your own points and a percentage of the total point. It would be cool to see a leaderboard with everyone else's points in the raid

Is there some functionality in RuneLite where RuneLite clients can communicate between each other which might make this possible?
