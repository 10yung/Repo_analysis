not work in weak network/download failed after 70% or 80%
Hello,
I am facing this issue where the file being downloaded has moved to a different domain. The original URL returns a 308 and PRDownloader follows the redirection. However, it uses the same auth token. This does not work as the auth token is linked to the domain. Consequently, we get a 401 Unauthorized. On top of it, the client is unaware that a redirect had taken place.
Whenever I am downloading a file it is giving me a negative downloadID .
hi may i know is this library support for upload file to server (in progress line)?
I had a problem I took a long time to debug.  Turns out that calling Resume on a running download makes the download run twice, with 2 concurrent tasks accessing the same file.  So it always ends up corrupt or the result file is simply missing without any error, warning or whatsoever.

This is easy to avoid by checking the download status before calling Resume, but a better error reporting/handling would have saved me a lot of time.

I have device "Moto G Turbo" with 6.0.1 Android OS.
Some time its download early, some time its take time to download a file.
How to resolve this, I use Internet connection with 50 mbps speed

I'm using this library as follows:

_OnCreate:_
```
PRDownloaderConfig config = PRDownloaderConfig.newBuilder()
                .setDatabaseEnabled(true)
                .build();
PRDownloader.initialize(getApplicationContext(), config);
```
_OnMySartDownloadButtonPressed():_

```
int downloadId = PRDownloader.download(url, Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath() + "/Download", null)
                .build()
                .setOnStartOrResumeListener(downloadTask)
                .setOnPauseListener(downloadTask)
                .setOnCancelListener(downloadTask)
                .setOnProgressListener(downloadTask)
                .start(downloadTask);
        downloadTask.setId(downloadId);
```

Knowing that `downloadTask `is an object that implements all requested listeners, while downloading the downloader keeps calling the `onStartOrResume()` function, and never calls any other listener function.
