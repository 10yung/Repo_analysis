I see my app in Server,

but requesting it from Android

delivers

Apache log has no entry, and honestly I've no idea what's wrong here.
Any hints for me ? 
Thank you

we are trying to setup an Appstore in our workspace using hockey kit latest version.
Following things are done:
1.we have setup the wamp server on a windows system and when we try invoking the address:
   "ip-address" / "applicationname" / public 
2.Then we are able to see our listed applications (both android and ios) and we are also able to    download both ipa and apk files from above link.
3.Then we checked on an Android phone and there also it seems to work fine but when we are trying         to download files from iphone 6(ios 9.1) it is showing "could not connect to 160.110.68.199"
    any suggestions on what would have went wrong  and how to proceed

I am unable to get the Install Profile button to actually install the profile.  
I tried to follow instructions for the adding of new apps but it seems Distribute for Enterprise is locked down for only Enterprise Developer Accounts which would not really work for AdHoc/App Store Targeted apps.   I am downloading the Provision Profile direct from our member center from the Apple Developer Account.  
Is there something I am missing here?

I captured the following from the console:

profiled[328] <Notice>: (Error) MC: Failed to parse profile data. Error: NSError:
    Desc   : Invalid Profile
    US Desc: Invalid Profile
    Domain : MCProfileErrorDomain

is there any way to get HockeyKit working with Windows Mobile/Phone apps?

Fixed warning: The 'viewDidUnload' instance method in UIViewController
subclass 'BWHockeySettingsViewController' is missing a [super
viewDidUnload] call

I completely set up the server, and the application page was shown properly.

But after I click "Install Application" on iOS device (iPod Gen 5, iOS 8.3). It shows error pop up saying that "Cannot connect to <website>".

What I think it might relate is as follows
- What is the value should I have in .plist file? Right now I have something like `"https://website.com/subdir1/subdir2/app.ipa"`. I use https:// to access the build.

Any clue or suggestion on this problem? 

New to HockeyKit, trying it out as an alternative to Apple's overly restrictive changes to TestFlight. Got client SDK integrated and server setup.  I can go to app page on laptop and Download Profile and Download App buttons both work.  However, on my iPhone 6, iOS 8.2 test device neither work.  OK I just read that iOS 8 no longer supports manual installation/management of profiles, but that its handled automatically when installing an app.  Fine, but tapping the Install Application button also does nothing at all. If I copy the link, and paste it into Safari it asks "Open this page in 'App Store'" which sounds right, but again, clicking Open does nothing at all.  

[EDIT]:

I figured it out: iOS 8 requires both display-image and full-size-image keys to be present in the plist.

So now it asks me to Install App, and I get a greyed out default app icon on the springboard, but it doesn't seem to ever get downloaded, however the network in use spinner in the status bar remains active.

Ideas?

BarButtonItem initWithImage might introduce a new crash in iOS 8.3. 

Please confirm.

Propose:

UIImage *image = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"gear.png"] imageWithRenderingMode:UIImageRenderingModeAlwaysTemplate];
UIButton *button = [UIButton new];
[button setImage:image forState:UIControlStateNormal];
[button sizeToFit];
[button addTarget:self action:@selector(openSettings:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithCustomView:button];

hey guys,

I'm trying to setup HockeyKit for our app. In my public directory is following dir structure.

```
+- public
  +- com.company.app
    +- version1
      +- app.ipa
      +- manifest.plist
    +- version2
      +- app.ipa
      +- manifest.plist
```

In same way as described here https://github.com/bitstadium/HockeyKit/wiki/Server#distribute-and-manage-multiple-versions. However I'm seeing only last version of the app. 

I tried test stuff from https://github.com/bitstadium/HockeyKit/tree/develop/server/php/tests but with same result.

Is this issue or intended behavior (that was my initial understanding after reading the wiki page but the more I look into code the less I think this is the case)?

Cheers,
-Jan
