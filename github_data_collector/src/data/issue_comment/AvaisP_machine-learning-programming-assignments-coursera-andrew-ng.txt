for e.g. i have five layers:
first layer 30,2nd l 25,3rd l 25,4th l 10,5th 8000
during backpropagation delta value calculations i have d5=(11*800) so when i calculate d4 i have d4 of size(11*1) including bias. but for d3 my theta is 26*10but d4 is 11*1 and thats the problem. My question is should i include bias as well
