Error in train.default(x, y, weights = w, ...) : 
  At least one of the class levels is not a valid R variable name; This will cause errors when class probabilities are generated because the variables names will be converted to  X0, X1 . Please use factor levels that can be used as valid R variable names  (see ?make.names for help).

I think maybe I forgot something, I've installed anything of them but it still didn't work.

If I login using my developer account in instagram and provide the same credentials in 'R' language, I get the following error if I want to fetch another user comments / likes etc.:

`Error: User not found!`

So authentication is mine but want to see different public user's comments/likes.
Can you please advise what can be the cause?

I get the following error after running "instagram-r" code:

```
Error in media$data[[i]]$comments : 
   $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors
```

Can you please provide a quick help?
