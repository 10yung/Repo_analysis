To support using the Toree kernel with Spark 2.4.4+ I had to patch in support for Scala 2.12. This works for me now, so thought I would try merging it back.

We had some problems with the nexus repository in conjunction with the Apache Toree incubator.

The coursier dependency manager is incompatible with Nexus repository manager. We could not use the magics %AddJar + %AddDeps in a normal way.

With the Ivy dependency manager we had no problems.

Changes:

We introduced a new setting 'ivy-settings' where an user can link an ivy-configuration file
Maybe it is useful for other people, too.
The deps_dir option configure destination path of dependencies downloaded with AddDeps magic.

The Scala kernel accepts command line arguments, such as `--profile`, `--ip`, `--default-repositories`. It also supports passing settings to the Scala compiler, e.g. `-- -Xmax-classfile-name 170` (the last one in particular is very useful when running Toree from inside Docker images or on encrypted volumes).

This patch allows users to pass command line arguments to the kernel via:
```
jupyter toree install \
  --kernel-opts="-- -Xmax-classfile-name 170" \
  --interpreters=Scala,PySpark,SparkR,SQL
```

Not sure if `kernel_opts` is the best name though. `kernel_extra_opts` may be better since `--profile` is already being passed to the kernel.
The goal of this PR is to decrease Toree's startup time by breaking out the ScalaInterpreter initialization and running it in its own thread. If you count the startup time as the time it takes KernelBootstrap.initizalize to complete, I saw the average startup time go from 8.16s to 5.69s on my laptop. I started the kernel ten times with the original code and my changes.

This supports both Python2 and Python3 now. Just remember to export PYTHON_EXEC=python3 for example. You are welcome..
It looks like the TOREE-97 issue -- support for Spark Yarn was closed without definitive solution (or something went wrong on the way). Toree does support it, but it won't work if a user doesn't add manually in their kernel.json definition, the env vars for `HADOOP_CONF_DIR`. Without that env var, Spark doesn't know what to do with the option `--master=yarn` (set in `__TOREE_SPARK_OPTS__`). It would be desirable to have it by default, and this patch provides this functionality. 

Probably this is not the nicest way to solve the problem, because it  just hard codes more vars into the JSON file -- ideally it would be nice to have an interface to add or remove env vars from those files, however, `HADOOP_CONF_DIR`  and `SPARK_CONF_DIR`  look basic to be exported. Even for an Spark Standalone deployment, `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` won't hurt.  So, here it goes our 2 cents to improve a bit the situation.

I cloned the TOREE-97 into TOREE-438 to sign this issue.
