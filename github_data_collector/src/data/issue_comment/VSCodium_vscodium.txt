Thanks a lot for this app.

HI,

I updated VSCodium today and on opening was presented with a black interface and nothing showing. This is the first time I have updated since early last year, sorry I don't know for sure which version I previously had. I installed the latest version of VSCode and it runs fine.

I have now deleted VSCodium from my system and in the process discovered that your uninstaller is terrible as it leaves all the files apart from the uninstaller file and the desktop and start menu icons.

I am currently running the latest version of Windows 10 on a 32-bit system
running the command `vscodium --verbose` log this :

```
[main 2020-01-07T15:03:31.253Z] [storage state.vscdb] Trace (event): INSERT INTO ItemTable VALUES ('telemetry.lastSessionDate','Tue, 07 Jan 2020 14:11:06 GMT'),('telemetry.currentSessionDate','Tue, 07 Jan 2020 15:03:31 GMT')
```

Can we be sure it's not a sign that some telemetry stuff is still not disabled ?
 Hello!

I fell in love with **VSCodium** and what the community is doing with it!

But I think the icon could use some improvement.

I wanted to explore the good metaphor work that @jaredreich did for the current logo and expand it a bit. Keeping to the theme of _Codium tomentosum_, the algae, and the color voted at the time on #4 . Also maybe it could use some more expanded branding, like a logotype. Make the whole thing a tad bit more modern.

Sorry I don't know how to change or add a proper label, I'm not sure I have permission?

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: macOS 10.15.2
 - Architecture x64
 - Version 1.41.1
With `update.mode` set to 'manual' I have observed that VSCodium connects to a 'bc.googleusercontent.com' URL on startup which is the same URL it uses to check for updates from the menu bar.  The tooltip for the 'manual' mode in settings states that it should 'disable automatic background update checks.'
