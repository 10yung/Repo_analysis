Great stuff in addition to the `look-alike` module. I was wondering would it be possible to return the accuracy/match for results?

thanks
I was trying to use the debug option but it doesn't exist.  Looks like the NPM package is out of date and doesn't include the commit. Would be great if it was updated.

Hi,

Thank you for your work and interesting library! My question is: 
Is it possoble to get index of matched neighbours instead of array of matched attributes?

Based on README example I would like to get index (id) of a movie(s) insetad of listed attributes.

Many thanks,
Tomek

Saw your library on HN. Looks useful. Quick very minor suggestion: you say:

```
Where movies is an array of objects that have at least those 5 attributes. Returns the top
10 movies from the array. 
```

You should fill out this example with that sample data in movies so we could see it actually work. It wouldn't add much bloat to the README file and would lead to a much fuller understanding of the behavior of the library.

Thanks for making this available,
t
