Hello,

Now that Xcode 7 is out, it would be great to see `Sol` updated for iOS 8 or iOS 9. The `UISearchDisplayController` class been deprecated in iOS 8 with `UISearchController`, so when running `Sol` in iOS8  or later, the app doesn't work well (it takes several attempts to search and select the city to see the weather).
