When I run it 
The file “IOSBoilerplate.app” couldn’t be opened because you don’t have permission to view it.

Why?

Fix incorrect layout in SwipeableCell after tap + swipe

I have more than 1000 friend list in a UITableView. So if I scroll down its flickering with previous image almost 20+ times.
How we can avoid this flickering issue ? It's very annoying.

Few guys have already noticed the same issue but still no reply.

Hi everyone, I want to limit down the parsed results to just cities, towns, villages, states but not addresses, suburbs, countries, continents, oceans etc.

I couldn't identify which license applies to the iOS-boilerplate project, neither here in the repo nor in the project's homepage. Could you please add a LICENSE file and possibly a mention of the license to the README?

Using Grand Central Dispatch

Hi There,

On select of a fast cell within a table view, the selection colour is blocked by the opaque white background colour. Is there away to configure a fast cell to still have the traditional selection behaviour?  

I have increased the size of the results coming from the Twitter search example in AsyncCellImagesExample.m by changing the code as below

NSArray *keys = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"q", @"rpp", nil];
NSArray *objects = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"iOS", @"100", nil];
NSDictionary *params = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjects:objects forKeys:keys];

And when I run the code on my iPhone, if you scroll directly to the bottom of the table view, very fast, the images start showing some previously fetched and rendered versions, and then they quickly go back to normal. It is like there is some flickering, showing incorrect images. 

- Center on origin location and postpone directions calculation to after view appearance.
- Show progress indicator while calculating directions.
