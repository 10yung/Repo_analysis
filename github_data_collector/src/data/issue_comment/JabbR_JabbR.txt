JabbR is a great example of how to use SignalR, with the SignalR undergoing a redesign/rewrite by the aspnetcore team are there any plans to update/rewrite JabbR to take advantage of the new xplatform .NET core and SignalR core?
A question for the demo site developers here:

I was hoping to double check this before posting the question, however it seems the JabbR site is down.

As I recall, the JabbR site is just one single page - there's no reloading of internal pages as navigation happens. If you were to implement JabbR on a site where the user would be navigating through (unlimited) multiple pages, would you opt for redesigning with an SPA like Angular with WebAPI and drop Razor? 

That way keeping the chat area on every page without refreshing?

Or would you stick with MVC  and update the DOM as the site is navigated with something like Javascript?
