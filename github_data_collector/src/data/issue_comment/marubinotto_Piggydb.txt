Hello.
I've deployed piggydb with tomcat 8.5.3 on alpine linux 3.9.  Everything is fine but some problem on search text form. When I input unicode characters in search form, in post result pages the keyword was replaced by question marks.
Followed many instructions I've add utf-8 encoding support in tomcat conf files, server.xml and web.xml, as bellow.

server.xml:
"<connector ..... URIEncoding="UTF-8" .... >"

web.xml
uncomment    " <filter><filter-name>setCharacterEncodingFilter  ...  </filter> " section and 
"<filter-mapping><filter-name>setCharacterEncodingFilter ... </filter-mapping>" section.

But with no luck, when I input unicode characters in search form, the result page still got question mark which should be the unicode characters.
Could anyone help me, please?
I installed piggydb v7 on a server for the first tests and found a few problems:
1. I miss the button "Delete all fragments in this trash completely" in the #trash view. So I can not delete fragments completely!
2. I miss the calendar. Is it correct that this is no longer available?
3. on top left, I have only the text-link 'icon' instead of the favicon-icon (but for me not fatal)
I would also like to use piggydb as a journal. Is it possible to sort fragments to a journal-date (not the create-date)?
I've tried to follow this guide:

http://piggydb.jp/en/fragment.htm?id=76

but doesn't work on my server. 


```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 9.0\webapps\BaseDeConoc
imientoDesktop>java -cp WEB-INF/lib/h2-*.jar org.h2.tools.Shell
**Error: Could not find or load main class org.h2.tools.Shell**
```

Is there another way to reset owner's password?

I attached a file and then I deleted the reference to it in its parent text fragment. It still exists on disk.

How do I find and delete this orphaned file fragment? Is there a command to delete orphans? Do orphans get garbage collected automatically?

I am using Piggydb verseion 7.0
Although I like famfamfam icons, but maybe because of their small size, the UI is hard to navigate (it is hard to position your cursor to the desired feature).
* When the login page loads the focus should be on username
* When creating a new node, the focus should be in the title / body
* There should be keyboard shortcuts to most operations
It would be great if PiggyDB would index the entire html page which was linked to via a hyperlink
I have just run into Piggydb for several days, and I wish I have got to know it several years earlier. Piggydb is working as exact what I was looking for. I have even written a bare app with go the last year, but that is still a long way from what I expected. Thank you very much for your creation.

I use piggydb to manage some knowledge points or notes when I am reading papers and books. And a lot of TeX math is involved. I certainly want the TeX math rendering engine works correctly and fast.

Piggydb is now using mathjax as the TeX math rendering engine.
However, a new rendering engine [KaTeX](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX) developed by the Khan Academy.
The KaTeX renders TeX math much faster than mathjax, though KaTeX can still not handle as much type of expressions as mathjax.

So, I wonder if it is possible to **add KaTeX as an additional rendering engine** to finally enable the users to switch between the engines.

I need to rewrite content from a wiki in piggydb and the links are in square brackets, so I tried searchgin fo '[' but non-alphanumeric characters seem to be ignored by search. It would be really helpful if piggydb could find any character sequence.

I noticed the search only matches full words. (I tried searching piggydb.jp/en for formatting help and _formatt_ (note the double T) did not yield any results, but _formatting_ did.) This way I can only find fragments whose wording I can exactly remember, which is usually not the case.

**Edit**: I'm not sure what is going on, because _format_ matches _information_, but not _formatting_. Now it seems like a bug, not a missing feature.
