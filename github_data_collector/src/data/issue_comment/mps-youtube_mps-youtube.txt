**Before merging this PR we need to set up some tokens for Github Actions to be able to push to dockerhub**

# Dockerfile changes
We now build the Docker image from the source code in the repository instead of downloading the newest version of pip. This way we can release multiple images of different (and unreleased versions) through dockerhub.

# New mpsyt organization on dockerhub.
I've created a new organization for mpsyt on dockerhub. I'll have to somehow get in touch with contributors in the mpsyt org in order to add them to the org and sort out owner rights at some point.

# Github actions
This PR also adds a few simple workflows that lets us automatically build images when we update the master and develop branch of the repository. The images are pushed to the aforementioned newly created org.

In order to facilitate that, we need to set a dockerhub secret to grant push rights. However it looks like only @ids1024 has access to do that. I can add him as owner to the dockerhub org, then he can create a security token and add that to the repo secrets and then we can automatically perform changes here.

We could/should also set up some schedule based workflows which would check and rebuild the images if youtube-dl has been updated. As well as building tagged versions of the software as well.
Not sure if this repo is still maintained, but anyway:

Pulling and running the docker image results in the old version (from 2016), which doesn't work.

## Issue / Suggestion
It's possible now to allow [auto-builds on dockerhub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/) (integration with github) so that images are up to date automatically.
The save command when used without any argument will **always** save the new playlist name using the artist name in the first position(18 chars), completely ignoring the last_opened playlist, it doesn't matter if it exists or not.

```

I don't know if this is the best thing to do or not... from where I see it is not, because when someone is working(removing or moving things) inside a local playlist, the expected behavior would be to save that same playlist, not another one with some other name matching the first 18 characters of the first indexed title, this doesn't make much sense to me in this context. Probably would make sense in other cases like if the list is not a local playlist, but a search list for example, then the save command would be free to use the first 18 chars of index 1 to save the newly created playlist if none is specified.

Let me know if my logic is wrong or not from your point of view guys, thank you !

Hi,

I would gladly add a no-colors option; it can be useful if somebody wants to use mps-youtube with the default terminal color settings. What about it?

want to watch 240p videos. sending them to an old CRT. this used to work, but doesn't seem to anymore.
Now it says maxres is 360. many YouTube videos are still 240p.

Is there some list of programs or packages that I must install before mps youtube?

## Your Environment

Running on a raspberry pi 4 with raspbian buster.

## Issue
When either launched with "mpsyt set show_video false, playurl [URL]" or played using the "playurl" command inside mpsyt, the video is shown anyway, as if `show_video` was set to true. The expected behavior is that the livestream would be played normally, with audio only, like any other video. P.S. I tried it with mplayer, and the livestream didn't play at all, showing that the video length is 00:00 and immediately stopping playback after entering the command.

MPV version: 0.30.0

As noted in #331 and #964, there are no subtitles when opening videos with mpv through mpsyt. Since `mpv [link]` does show subtitles, the problem is likely in how mpsyt calls mpv, but I'm not sure exactly where. A temporary workaround is to add a new command, similar to the 'copy link to clipboard', except that the link goes to opening mpv directly. In the video list, typing `m <number>` will do `mpv [link]` and subtitles will now work.

This isn't the ideal solution (it imports `os`, check for whether mpv is installed is not implemented, no mplayer support), but there's hasn't been any progress on adding subtitle support, so this workaround might be useful for people at the meantime
Can you build a 32-bit exe please?

64bit OS can run 32bit apps but 32bit OS can't run 64bit apps. It doesn't make sense to build only 64bit instead of 32bit if you are gonna build for only one platform because 32bit apps can be run by both but 64bit apps can only be run by one of them.

Thanks!

I expected to work similar to how it works on google search for site exclusion.
i.e.
