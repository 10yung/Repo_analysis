- Does this kick in if there is a failure of any kind, or only if the local app does not work? 
- Does this check happen BEFORE it does a calculation on the to-be-backed-up data? Preventing unnecessary computation and early cancellation?

Work on getting the Sync UI into a releasable state. 
If reporting a bug:

1. __Can you describe the problem and bug in more detail?__

On some pages, `<hr>` tags are very small and do not span the width of the element they're in.

2. __How can we replicate the issue?__

Visit https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-supertrait-item-shadowing/11421 in Firefox or another browser. Notice the solid horizontal line. Alternatively, here's a hr tag: <hr>

Install https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/worldbrain/ into Firefox, and reload the page. The horizontal line is replaced by two tiny horizontal lines with endcaps (looks like a rounded rectangle).

3. __Expected behavior (i.e. solution)__

Memex doesn't alter the CSS of the page it's monitoring.

5. __Other comments__

This issue still happens with all keyboard shortcuts and ribbon disabled.
If reporting a bug:

1. __Can you describe the problem and bug in more detail?__
I visit a file url to a local html file on Chrome version 79 but the extension highlighter, sidebar and keyboard shortcut don't work.

2. __How can we replicate the issue?__
I have enabled "Allow access to file URLs" on Memex extension page. Chrome browser version is 79.0.3945.117. "Block third-party cookies and site data" is checked in Chrome's "Content Settings". Then, visit a file url to a local html file.

3. __Expected behavior (i.e. solution)__
Expected to see highlighter when highlighted some text and sidebar when mouse hover to right side or keyboard shortcut are pressed.

4. __Error stack (from extension crash page)__
DevTools Console on the file url page:
```
Uncaught DOMException: Failed to read the 'localStorage' property from 'Window': Access is denied for this document.

5. __Other comments__
`window.localStorage` is not available on file url page on Chrome version 79 and it is available on Firefox version 70.
If "Block third-party cookies and site data" is not checked in Chrome's "Content Settings", then window.localStorage and the extension seems no problem...

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

If reporting a bug:

1. __Can you describe the problem and bug in more detail?__

There are two vertical scrollbars
There is a horizontal scrollbar that probably isn't needed

2. __How can we replicate the issue?__

On macos:  
   System Preferences > General > Show scroll bars > Always
   Load Memex

Otherwise:  
  Load Memex


3. __Expected behavior (i.e. solution)__

Only show scrollbars when needed with `overflow: auto;`

If reporting a bug:

1. __Can you describe the problem and bug in more detail?__
I use padloc.app with Firefox 71.0 (64-bit) on MacOS 10.14.5 (18F132). When typing the passphrase, typing any key that Memex uses  as a keyboard shortcuts results in the sidebar appearing, and the input from the keyboard being shunted over to Memex. Quite annoying, when you are trying to type a passphrase!

2. __How can we replicate the issue?__

Create a free account in padlock.app and type in their input field (like "email address" or "passphrase") letters associated to a Memex keyboard shortcut. For me it's `h` and `c`, for example.  

3. __Expected behavior (i.e. solution)__
Typing your passphrase undisturbed. Memex does not appear unless summoned.

4. __Error stack (from extension crash page)__
This issue does not lead to a crash. 
If reporting a bug:

1. __Can you describe the problem and bug in more detail?__

I'm using Memex as a Firefox web extension. However, I'm not able to see the favicon. From the HTML source code, it looks like the favicon is not configured yet. I normally pin the Memex tab in browser and it would be great if we can display favicon to make the tab more recognizable.

2. __How can we replicate the issue?__
<!-- Please be specific as possible. Use dashes (-) or numbers (1.) to create a list of steps -->
<!-- Ex. Going to settings, every night at 3pm, when I go to search -->

Open Memex Firefox extention and see there is no favicon.

3. __Expected behavior (i.e. solution)__
<!-- What should have happened? -->

I should be able to see the favicon.

4. __Error stack (from extension crash page)__
<!-- Did the issue lead you to the crash page? -->

N/A

5. __Other comments__

I can help with adding the favicon if this change sounds reasonable to you.
Please provide support to read pages in 'reader mode' (akin to firefox/safari). That, alongside the excellent organization-annotation features, would make it the perfect reading tool.
Thanks!
1. __Can you describe the problem and bug in more detail?__
When, in the settings, I disable the `Show tooltip on every page` option, the extension disables the whole Highlighter functionality, therefore it stops showing the highlights I make in a page. I am trying to disable the tooltip because I only use the keyboard shortcuts and it is annoying/distracting.

2. __How can we replicate the issue?__
- Go to settings.
- Disable the `Show tooltip on every page` option.
- Refresh any page you previously had highlights.
- Highlights gone.

3. __Expected behavior (i.e. solution)__
The highlights still showing yet the tooltip not displaying when text is selected.

4. __Error stack (from extension crash page)__
N/A

5. __Other comments__
I only tried this using Firefox 71.0, but from my debugging it seems to be an issue with the extension.
I tried to search for similar open issues but I did not find any.
