Hi,
I'm working on StaMPS in step-2 I got the following error:
Error in ps_est_gamma_quick (line 221)
        ph_grid(grid_ij(i,1),grid_ij(i,2),:)=ph_grid(grid_ij(i,1),grid_ij(i,2),:)+shiftdim(ph_weight(i,:),-1);

I need your help to solve it.
I'm running the mt_prep_snap on Mac for the first time. It runs now for over 8 hours and there is no results or any error messages or even any change in the Terminal window?
I do not know if the process still running or how long it takes to be completed?
any idea?
Hi
I see that mt_prep_gamma has in line 143 an "end" and so It didn't ran completely, 
I commented this and the program ran ok, but I am concerned that I should have removed that "end"


Expand gamma description with more information on:
- expected precision of files double, float etc
- inform about precision flag in the stamps_gamma scripts 
- big versus Small Endian
- relative files sizes between ifg, lonlat etc.

In the p25 of the manual, chapter 4.8 does not have a content.
