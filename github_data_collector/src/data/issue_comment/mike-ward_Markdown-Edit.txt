How can I change the space before or after a paragraph in preview, sometimes I find the space is too much, I want the spacing to be more compact, how can I configure it?
```Markdown
### title
this is a test paragraph, everything is ok.
- item1
- item2
- itme2

New paragraph here.
```

Thanks.
Hey there, i recently discovered that Markdown Edit supports custom markdown engines and at first I was overjoyed since this means that I can use MultiMarkdown whenever I need footnotes :D

But sadly I discovered an issue:

The first line that is written in Markdown Edit is not parsed in the live preview. Please see the images below for reference:
![Second line and any after that is being rendered correctly](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32921815/66188510-b26d6d00-e687-11e9-986e-0ede095067a6.png)
![First line is not rendered correctly](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32921815/66188512-b26d6d00-e687-11e9-8c62-8d31ca6d78b3.png)

The first line of the file I am editing is not parsed by into the live preview. No matter what kind of markdown is used.

Versions I am using:
- Markdown Edit Version 1.35
- MultiMarkdown Version 6.4.0

Output of MultiMarkdown.exe --version:
```
MultiMarkdown 6 v6.4.0
Copyright ┬® 2016 - 2018 Fletcher T. Penney.
...
```

My multimarkdown configuration file (relevant lines only):
```
"CustomMarkdownConverter": "D:\\Program Files\\MultiMarkdown 6.4.0\\bin\\multimarkdown.exe",
"CustomMarkdownConverterArgs": "",
```

Additionally, if I parse a file which has markdown in the first line with MultiMarkdown manually it works just fine. `# Heading 1` turns into `<h1 id="1">Heading 1</h1>`

If I copy the HTML output out of Markdown Edit it is exported as `<p>﻿# 1</p>`.  Apparently the first line is **Always** rendered as regular text, regardless of the markdown tags that are present.

If I, on the other hand, put the Markdown on the second line and copy the HTML the following is my output:
```HTML
<p>﻿</p>

<h1 id="1">1</h1>
```

It appears that Markdown Edit puts a single, empty `<p></p>` tag around the contents of the first line, regardless of what the actual content of the line is, only starting the actual parsing afterwards.
This means you will only have one column instead of two. Perhaps adding another switch button?
When opening MDE it remembers the last state of the pane visibility, cycled through with `F12`. If the last state was preview only (i.e. the editor was hidden), files don't appear to get processed: the preview pane is blank and if `F12` is pressed to view the editor pane, the normal syntax highlighting isn't applied to the source.

Once the editor pane has been made visible (even if only briefly), this seems to trigger normal processing again and newly opening a file (or displaying the help with `F1`) result in expected behaviour once again.

Win10 Pro 1809 64-bit, MDE 2.35. I haven't tried other processing engines, but I'm using the default, non-GitHub, engine, whichever that is.

## It will not work (with 2 spaces)
```
* Parent
\s\s* Child 1
\s\s* Child 2
```

## It works with 4 spaces
```
* Parent
\s\s\s\s* Child 1
\s\s\s\s* Child 2
```

Anybody here, please go to [this topic](https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issues/7748/markdown-nested-lists-not-working-bb-8925) and ask Atlassian to make it works. It seem they are very stubborn to update to lasted markdown specs.
If I make changes to a Markdown file outside of Markdown Edit, it currently does not detect those changes, and I have to manually reload the file.  It would be much nicer if it watched the directory containing the file with a `FileSystemWatcher`, in case the file changed for any reason (external editor, pull from source control, etc.).  `FileSystemWatcher` is already used to watch for changes in the user settings file, template file, and snippets file, but not yet for Markdown source files that are being edited.

If any changes were detected, it should display a message box indicating that the file was modified and asking the user if they want to reload it (and discard any unsaved changes they might have, if any) or ignore it.

E.g. here's the dialog box that Notepad++ displays when it detects external modifications:

Note that some text editors will edit a file in-place (open, truncate, write, close), while other text editors will write out a temporary file and then rename it on top of the old file, and some others might delete the original before writing the new file; so making sure that all of those cases are handled correctly can be non-trivial.
`\%` in latex [generates](http://latex.wikia.com/wiki/Percent_sign_(LaTeX_symbol)) the percent sign (%). However, this appears to be unsupported in Markdown Edit.

For example, `$$30\%$$` renders "30" instead of "30%".
Hi guys,
best Editor ever, but one thing seems to be strange. Why do you escape some special chars?`These backslahes are _shown_ on other editors. I work parallel on NextCloud Notes-Addon. E.g. checkboxes look like
`  - \[ \] my note\!`
wich is not really nice.
Any chance do disable that?
Such as the title. I think changing it to a multi-tab editor like VS Code can make it easier for people to write documents. I often need to open several documents at the same time and write together. 
This is just a suggestion, I hope you can consider it. 
Hi!

Would you mind adding a Dutch spell checking dictionary?
For example: https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/dictionaries/tree/nl_NL

Thanks in advance!
