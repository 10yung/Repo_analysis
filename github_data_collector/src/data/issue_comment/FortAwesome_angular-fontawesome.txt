### Describe the problem you'd like to see solved or task you'd like to see made easier

It would be nice to have all icons being fixed-width by default to achieve better layouts in certain scenarios. As far as I know this is currently not possible.

### Is this in relation to an existing part of angular-fontawesome or something new?

FontAwesomeModule

### What is 1 thing that we can do when building this feature that will guarantee that it is awesome?

Provide configuration options for the FontAwesomeModule. Maybe by implementing a .forRoot() method, which receives a configuration. This could also include default icon style, so that it could be omitted in <fa-icon>.

### Why would other angular-fontawesome users care about this?

I believe this would make the work of other layout designers/programmers easier.

### On a scale of 1 (sometime in the future) to 10 (absolutely right now), how soon would you recommend we make this feature?

I've just found out that when I build my universal app all the svg code for the icons ends up in my server.js which I'm sure can't be good for performance as it's 1000's of lines of unnecessary code 

They are not in the client side build so how do I prevent them ending up server build.

### Describe the problem you'd like to see solved or task you'd like to see made easier

Upgrading 0.5.0 to 0.6.0 guide incomplete.

`this.icon$ = this.loadIcon().pipe(startsWith(defaultIcon));`

What is `this.loadIcon()` ?

Existing Part

Everybody needs to the point documentation.

### Feature request checklist

- [x] This is a single feature (i.e. not a re-write of all of Font Awesome)
- [x] The title starts with "Feature request: " and is followed by a clear feature name (Ex: `Feature request: moar cowbell`)
- [x] I have [searched for existing issues](https://github.com/FortAwesome/angular-fontawesome/issues) and to the best of my knowledge this is not a duplicate

I have successfully set up @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome@0.6.0-alpha.0 with angular 8 and loaded some icons.   The new alpha version looks solid 👏 👏 

That said, my specs are failing now with the error below.  This is presumably because my app loads the font library in AppModule, but my YsMainMenuComponent spec knows nothing about AppModule.

It would be very helpful if the readme here provided some guidance on injecting a FaFontLibrary into an angular spec correctly.

```
YsMainMenuComponent > should have link_to_home

### Describe the problem
I used angular fontawesome with mat-icon-button from Angular Material. Any other size other than default is having an offset.

```
<button mat-icon-button color="primary">
     <fa-icon [icon]="userIcon" size="2x"></fa-icon>
 </button>
```

Current Size: **2x**

Other icon on the left(Moon) is Material Design Icon. Which has proper alignment.

<!--- What happened? What are you seeing? How did you arrive here? -->

### What did you expect?

<!--- How would you like this to work instead? -->
I want it centre aligned inside button by default.

### Reproducible test case

**Question**
Now that the global icon library has been [deprecated](https://github.com/FortAwesome/angular-fontawesome/blob/master/docs/upgrading/0.4.0-0.5.0.md#migrate-from-global-icon-library-to-faiconlibrary) in 0.5.0, is there a recommended way as to how to set up an icon library in storybook?

Storybook stories have no module/Angular constructor.

I was previously doing something like this in my `.storybook/config.js` file:
```js
import { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core';
import { IMPORTED_ICONS } from '@app/icons';

library.add(...IMPORTED_ICONS);
```

There is use case when an action is performed on clicking on icon e.g: close icon, it would nice to hover effect on icon for this case.

I want to display an icon stack on my page, so this is what I have:

```
<fa-stack>
  <fa-icon [icon]="['fal', 'lock']"></fa-icon>
  <fa-icon [icon]="['fal', 'ban']"></fa-icon>
</fa-stack>
```

However, this renders completely empty: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7480500/64615471-8c2f1700-d3d2-11e9-8c13-0d032dfe99ec.png)

If I remove the `<fa-stack>` wrapper, the icons render:

My implementation as I understand it is completely in-line with [the documentation provided](https://github.com/FortAwesome/angular-fontawesome/blob/master/docs/usage/features.md#stacked-icons), so is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?

I'm running on Angular 8.2.3.
Font Awesome versions:

### Describe the problem you'd like to see solved or task you'd like to see made easier

A way to apply inset gradients on icons.

### Is this in relation to an existing part of angular-fontawesome or something new?

This is new for angular-fontawesome but not for Font-Awesome as described here:
https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/11925

### What is 1 thing that we can do when building this feature that will guarantee that it is awesome?

Make it easy to use 🌟 

### Why would other angular-fontawesome users care about this?

Because gradients are beautiful ✨ 

### On a scale of 1 (sometime in the future) to 10 (absolutely right now), how soon would you recommend we make this feature?

6 - This feature was easy to implement with the oldest version...
