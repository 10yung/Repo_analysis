Text with broken link: Deploying applications using Kubernetes Helm charts.

Link referred: https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-workshop-for-kubernetes/blob/master/03-path-application-development/306-app-management-with-helm

Fix suggestion: 306 to be replaced with 307
Current deployment method breaks when joining worker nodes.  Should use eksctl to match current EKS docs.
1.10 is not supported.  We should be using the most recent EKS version (1.14.7).

Hi,

I have an EKS cluster in Oregon, I want to setup another EKS cluster in Singapore for global deployment, so I want to setup federation v2 on EKS but I can’t find any information, and it seems that EKS doesn’t support Kubernetes alpha and the federation v2 is only available in alpha, are there other ways to use federation on EKS? If not, are there any other similar solutions available for global deployment?

Thanks
Gary
Hi Team,

I'm new in kubernetes domain, and looking for routing solution  where traffic can be routed to different apps on basis of sub-domain. 
 *.domain.com -> ELB -> ingress-controller(Nginx)-> app1.domain.com ---> app1
                                                                                 -> app2.domain.com ---> app2

Can someone suggest some reference.

Thanks

We're missing the step to remove the metrics server.  May be up for discussion what that actually buys us by removing it, aside from returning the cluster to its previous state.
