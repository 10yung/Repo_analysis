### Bug Report

Filling out the following details about bugs will help us solve your issue sooner.

#### Reproducible in:

PanModal version:

iOS version:

#### Steps to reproduce:

1. edit function
2. edit readme

#### Expected result:

We are going to use SwiftUI as Apple suggests, so PanModal should be supporting SwiftUI as well. 

#### Actual result:


#### Attachments:

Logs, screenshots, screencast, sample project, funny gif, etc.

### Description

After upgrading to the latest PanModal version, showing the pan modal no longer has background dimming animation. That is, while the modal animates up from the bottom, the black transparent background appears instantly without a fade-in effect.

Dismissing works fine: both the modal and the background has an animation for dismissal.

Expected: The dimming background should animate from alpha 0 to 1 when the pan modal is activated.
