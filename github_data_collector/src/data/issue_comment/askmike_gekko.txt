Possible update to Windows 10 Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) Related Setup steps or added information.  You may use this or not as you desire.

**Action taken** (what you did)
I was only able to get this to work by changing the version of node to 8.11.3.  I also had too make sure AVG Antivirus/Firewall/Windows Firewall settings allowed bash.exe/port 3000 TCP/UDP traffic. Unfortunately, I was all over the place resolving this issue so I can't provide steps.  The following are the steps I took to get things working that I was able to record, just in case you see some ideas to add to the documentation.  

sudo apt-get update
_**nvm use 8.11.3**_
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential

sudo apt-get install git

git clone git://github.com/askmike/gekko.git
cd gekko
npm install --only=production
cd exchange
npm install --only=production
cd ..

Hi there,

I'm trying to access the previous EMA for a calculation purpose.
I have the EMA but I also want to have access to the EMA that happened previously.

Is there a way to get access to this?


UPDATE: my bad, problem resolved.

[x] bug report

**Action taken** (what you did)
I started the bot at exactly 00:00 UTC. It ran fine for many weeks with virtually no drift. However, as soon as the Kraken API went down for 50 minutes, a problem occurred with the candle calculation. This is a 4 hour interval.

- The last tick calculated before the API went down was 08:00 UTC
- 4 hours later, at the next attempted tick, the kraken API was down at 12:01
- It retried again 8 times per second (that's a problem in itself), until 12:28. The bot then stopped reporting any errors.
- The next tick was attempted to be calculated at 12:51, and I have no idea why there was a 23 minute delay from the last error to the time when the next tick was calculated.
- Even though this tick occurred at 12:51, it calculated the tick at 12:00. It went back in time.
- The next tick occurred at 16:20, but calculated a candle timestamp of 16:00. I don't know how it arrived at 16:20 when the last attempt was at 12:51
- The next tick occurred at 20:20, and correctly calculated a candle timestamp of 20:20
- Every tick after this occurred at XX:20.

So there is a big problem there. After an API failure, the candle timestamp calculation goes wacky, and doesn't correlate correctly to the data coming in until 3 ticks after data has resumed.
In addition, since the API can be down for X number of minutes, the candle calculation is now X number of minutes drifted in time from original start. This throws the entire strategy off.


**Expected result** (what you hoped would happen)
Candle timestamp calculation should resume after an API failure at the next scheduled interval, based on the interval specified in the strategy settings.

**Actual result** (unexpected outcome)
Candle timestamp calculation resumes based on the a random time after API data resumes coming in.

Please advise how this can be properly addressed.
I'm thinking the bot needs some internal work on the candle, but in the mean time I think I could check for drift and if drift occurred, automatically stop and restart the bot on the next scheduled tick. I need to think how this could be accomplished.


Separate import jobs could retrieve data for overlapping time periods. 
Is there any way to reconcile separate datasets containing data from the same exchange for overlapping periods of time?

Thanks.

[ ] question about the decisions made in the repository

**Action taken** (what you did)
Run the update-binance.js script but I still can't see USDT in assets

**Expected result** (what you hoped would happen)
To see both USDT/BTC and BTC/USDT so I can decide if I want to accumulate BTC using USDT or rather accumulate USDT using BTC!

**Actual result** (unexpected outcome)
USDT only appears as currency not asset!


**Other information** (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, etc)

I run the script to update pairs from Binance, it works BUT I can never see any USDT as asset, only as currency. Why? I personally would like to accumulate USDT using BTC, how can I do that if I only see USDT as currency?
