The repo doesn't exists
The sentence `Ihr Eintrag wurde bearbeiten.` is wrong in german.
It needs to be `Ihr Eintrag wurde bearbeitet.`

I'm using Forem with PostgreSQL and experience 20+ sec delays after getting around 1000+ topics. The less topics the faster the topics controller loads.

Prior to this I've made sure I'm not querying any 3rd party services. I've looked for clues with rack-mini-profiler as well as pages like these:
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/909225/first-request-to-rails-app-is-very-slow
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/680302/how-can-i-find-out-why-my-app-is-slow
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23703792/rails-3-2-ruby-1-9-and-unicorn-the-first-request-is-very-slow-how-to-debug

[This line](https://github.com/rubysherpas/forem/blob/master/app/models/forem/concerns/viewable.rb#L21) touches the topic (changes it's `updated_at`) when the topics/show action is hit. If you are like me and you're implementing fragment caching in your views and you are using the `updated_at` column to determine your cache_key, the cache will be invalidated on every request. I don't see any reason that it should touch the record.

I know the gem isn't really maintained at the moment, but I can create a PR to change this behavior if somebody with merge power can confirm the current behavior is not desired.

Thanks!! :smile: 

after installing forem by default am not getting page title. and have seen some closed issues about page title which shows it has been implemented. so how can i use?

I follow the steps http://www.sitepoint.com/forem-rails-forum-engine/  said ,but nothing happend????Only the four Home Forums   Sign up  Sign in  and all can't be used,wait for help

im adding it to a new rails 4 app, then i changed the initializer to include my own application layout, which shares the same partial as the forum app-layout. the partial contains the about link, login and logout. 
these links are not working...they work in the main-app-layout though. rake routes is fine...what am i doing wrong here?

thx

There's anybody able to bundle the gem after add it to the gemfile ?

Hey guys, 

after installing `forem` my application suddenly started to behave strange. At first load everything works fine, but after reloading classes in development-mode, I suddenly get the following error: 

```
TypeError (superclass mismatch for class ArticleDecorator):
  app/decorators/contentful/article_decorator.rb:1:in `<top (required)>'

Strange thing: My `ArticleDecorator` is namespaced therefore this shouldn't happen. Also: Aren't engines like `forem` namespaced too, so that this should be happening?

Any advise would be appreciated...
