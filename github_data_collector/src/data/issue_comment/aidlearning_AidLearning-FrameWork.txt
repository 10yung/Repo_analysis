在我使用nmap扫描时出现错误
nmap: netutil.cc:3285: int route_dst_netlink(const sockaddr_storage*, route_nfo*, const char*, const sockaddr_storage*): Assertion `p != NULL' failed.
Aborted
我可以在局域网任意设备访问它，感觉非常的不安全
或者可以给它加个密码
Hello,
    When I use the AidCode to write the python project,I can run py3 but if I want to see the result such as print function I have to click the show log and it works normally then I can't get back to the code only I can do is to close the IDE and open it again.Is there any button to back the code editor?

Thanks
Hello,

I'm here to inform you about important Remi https://github.com/dddomodossola/remi updates. These changes comprises an API change: the Widget class is no more a container, and so it was removed the method *append* from it. The class Container have to be used in replacement to Widget.
Additionally, the Editor has different new improvements:
1. It now can load external additional widgets: there are available some OpenCv, Siemens and EPICS widgets. Maybe you can consider to create your own widgets set.
2. The events can now be connected to existing widget methods. It previously create a custom listener method. This allows widgets interaction during editing. In example, if I put an OpencvVideo widget, I can connect the event *on_new_image* to the OpencvThreshold.on_new_image_listener, and so, when a new frame occurs it automatically gets transferred to the Threshold, without writing code.

There are also different bug fixes.

Regards,
Davide
