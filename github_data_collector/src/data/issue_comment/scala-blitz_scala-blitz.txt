I downloaded scala-blitz to a cluster and am trying to run the BarnesHut.scala example. What commands do I need to run from where in the directory? (https://github.com/scala-blitz/scala-blitz/blob/master/src/test/scala/org/scala/optimized/test/examples/BarnesHut.scala) Thanks!
Will Android ever be on the roadmap? It has problems with Proguard due to java.lang.invoke. I was able to get around that, but then it turns out that java.lang.management.ManagementFactory isn't supported on Android. The problem occurs here:

``` scala
import java.lang.management.ManagementFactory
import java.lang.management.RuntimeMXBean
import scala.collection.JavaConversions._
val bean = ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean()
```

Hi guys, these changes were made during my semester project "BlitzViews" and are necessary for the next step: separating BlitzViews from the ScalaBlitz repository and using the latter as a dependency. The first change was made by Dmitry, the second is a small helper and the third was reviewed by Dmitry. Feel free to comment. Note: should I separate in 3 commits?
- Introduces a new Reducable operation: mapFilterReduce
- Add toOption for ResultCell
- Fix validateResult (remove legacy check)

Currently Kernels have no values stored in them, they only define methods
Making kernels objects instead of classes could potentially make operation invocation initialization faster, as Kernels will be loaded only once by jvm.

AFAIK it shouldn't affect performance of computation itself, as jvm stores statistics per-bytecode instead of per-class-instance.
