Working within projects, when logging time against a task, is there a possibility of providing a category per-project to classify the hours?  This would help using the time tracking feature to export the data for a format for invoicing, where the invoices need to specify a classification for time.

If a pull request would be welcome, I would be willing to provide this feature.
Is there a way whereas I can assign either a `Contact` or `Company` to a `Group` instead of a `Person`?  

The use case is to setup teams of `People` to manage one or more `Company` or `Contact` entries within the system.

+1 if the `Person` login details can be used to set the default `Group` assignments for the `Contact` or `Company`.
Good day.
We have a problem with our cummnuty server.
We've uploaded ppt file  185MB at server. But when we try to open it, there is an error
https://ibb.co/0rJ5Ck9

All files, like doc,xls,ppt,pdf can't be opened and can't be downloaded form the server. When we send external link to our clients, they can't download documents more 100 Mb.

How to solve the problem?

On what is based the user limit of the community edition? Is this an hard limit? What explain the difference with a development edition?
Browser doesn't load some images on community edition (self hosted on Ubuntu Server).
When I copy image link i get Sorry, the resource cannot be found.
The problem is that URL for theese images is in lower case ie. https://server.ip/products/projects/app_themes/default/images/product_logolarge.png

My server is behind HAproxy but this is isn't workin anyway I connect from LAN behind HAproxy.
After using the automated installer script at https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/server/docker/opensource/opensource-script-installation.aspx, not only does the script ignore any and all valid parameters, it also installs a paid edition of the server software, after fixing up invalid connection strings that caused the script to fail:

    # bash opensource-install.sh -ics true -icp true -ims false -ids false -dip 10.10.10.18 -es false -mysqlh 10.10.10.15 -mysqlrp ******

I only needed to install the Community Server, as the Document Server was already installed on another container, and I have separate servers for DB, Redis, and Erlang. The install script still attempted to install everything, and the dependencies of same (doc-server: postgres, redis, rabbit, etc)

After the install was cleaned up, I landed on a portal and was asked for a licence file, which does not pertain to the Community Edition in the slightest (!)

Using RHEL 7.4 x86_64
I am running docker image of Onlyoffice document server on Ubuntu. I also expose OODS to the internet via Windows VPS. I configured IIS to run OO via reverse proxy. IIS rewrites html links and disables  some ACCEPT_ENCODING headers values. Nothing fancy. I followed [this article](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/friis/2016/08/25/iis-with-url-rewrite-as-a-reverse-proxy-part-3-rewriting-the-outbound-response-contents/) to get it running in this mode. I works fine with nextcloud and bitwarden. OODS works fine to the point when I want to open some document. Link to the Editor.bin file is broken and loads via 
https://192.168.0.11:3223/cache/files/3067035540/Editor.bin/Editor.bin which is incorrect since this is local IP of internal server. I works fine when I open it from internal network: file is loaded via domain:
https://internalname.com:3223
so I suspect that IIS reverse proxy rewrite it somehow? But I browse through all the html and js files and can't find any mention of 192.168.0.11 IP. I think that this file is loaded via sdkjs file since this is only place with "Editor.bin" string, but again there is no IP as far as I can tell. 
So how this file is loaded really? How can I rewrite this url (or not rewrite if this is reverse proxy issue). 
I tried to run IIS with config from [OODS official configuration](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/document-server-proxy/tree/master/iis/proxy-to-virtual-path) but this is even worse since all of js files do not load at all. 
Hello,
we use the docker image of Community and Document server behind an Apache proxy-server.
When I want to share a document, the created shared link is broken because the hostname is just an underscore _
I attached a picture:
![onlyoffice_share](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16835576/59039461-30a23a00-8875-11e9-9f03-cd3fe68d3f7f.png)

We are using internal hostname and DNS-server. If i replace the underscore with the hostname, everything works as expected. 
Any suggestion how I can investigate this issue?

Version information (latest docker image):
onlyoffice.community.release-date: "20190515"
onlyoffice.community.version: "10.0.1.875"

Thank you in advance!
