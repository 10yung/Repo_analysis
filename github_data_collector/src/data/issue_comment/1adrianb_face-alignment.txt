Hi @1adrianb : thanks a lot for all of this. really appreciate it
I was wondering if its possible to get the aligned images. Your FaceAlignment class, as the name suggests, should provide such functionality, but I cant seem to find any examples that does the actual alignment.  
Would you kindly show us how to do this as well? 

Is it possible to use RetinaFace instead of SFD ?
Hello, I want to use my own network for face detection, so I tried to pass `face_detector=None` to `FaceAlignment` class, but it gives me an error.   

Is there any functionality to pass cropped faces or its bounding boxes to the `get_landmarks` method?
Hi

I need a clear picture with facial landmark numbers which are clearly visible for my research. Kindly help me asap,
It seems like we can crop faces here, but that the total purpose of this project is to detect faces rather than to actually align them. Are we aware of any other projects out there that go the last mile and use the result of this project to then crop/rotate/tilt/stretch the face to a canonical position and pose which can then be used for training in another network?
Hi @1adrianb .
How to get the multiple landmark predictions for the image with 2-3 faces in it, and how it chooses just single face from all detected faces after 'sfd' to get the landmarks?
Like the below output:

When dealing with single channel images, the following error was raised:

I see that it is a (68,3) numpy array. I am interested in the landmarks for the eyes. From the numpy array I am not able to infer which of those values are related to eye. Please help at the earliest possible. I am in need of this data for my PhD research

changed the built-in keyword to a generic name, using built-in keywords in python is a bad idea even if it is allowed.
