Hi,

Thank you for the great scripts!
Any chance to have support for Java8?

Looks like there is https://github.com/rraptorr/oracle-java8 already. I haven't checked how it works though.

script output:

Java 6 fails to package on Ubuntu 14.04.  Maybe issue started with 13.10 but I can't test at this time.

This is due to a dependency on packages that no longer exists.  The best I can tell is that they were dropped on 13.10.

Packages in question are lib32asound2 and ia32-libs.

lib32asound2 is likely just libasound2:i386 however ia32-libs was pulling in a bunch of other stuff and I don't know what the additional needed is there.

Using a fork of the script I was able to install Java 7 and Java 8 successfully.

Oracle has again changed the download process.  

changing line 507 from:

```
COOKIES="oraclelicensejdk-${JAVA_VER}u${JAVA_UPD}-oth-JPR=accept-securebackup-cookie;gpw_e24=http://edelivery.oracle.com"
```

to:

```
COOKIES="gpw_e24=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oracle.com%2F; oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie"
```

works for me.

This replaces #125

This will allow you to download and build Java 8 packages as well.

This is a fix for [issue #127](https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6/issues/127) based on my observation of the cookies required

Downloading is saving an HTML file with an error message instead of the JDK...

Hi, I obtain the following error on Ubuntu 13.10:

```

```

The following lines are the last lines of oab-java.sh.log:

```

dpkg-buildpackage: warning: build dependencies/conflicts unsatisfied; aborting
dpkg-buildpackage: warning: (Use -d flag to override.)
17708's retcode: 3
success
```

After some research I found that lib32asound2 is not present in ubuntu repositories starting from 13.10. This probably comes from the multi-arch switch on debian.
Probably some packages still keep lib32asound2 as dependency.
