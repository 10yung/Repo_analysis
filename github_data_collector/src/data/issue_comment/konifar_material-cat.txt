I'll update this project again to try new architecture, new layouts, new tools and Kotlin.
Could you please add Gradle wrapper to simplify project build?

why are you creating static object in Application class? is this good practice? I'd read that static object in android not desirable.

public static final FlickrApiService FLICKR_API = new RestAdapter.Builder()
            .setEndpoint(Constants.FLICKR_ENDPOINT)
            .setConverter(new GsonConverter(new GsonBuilder().setDateFormat(Constants.JSON_DATE_FORMAT).create()))
            .build()
            .create(FlickrApiService.class);

From where I could take the code to make the transition in PhotoDetail image ?

In the Detail Activity isn't it possible scroll fast from bottom to top. It stops below the image. Also a second fling gesture to reach the top edge of the image is blocking. Maybe its a bug in the design Support library?
