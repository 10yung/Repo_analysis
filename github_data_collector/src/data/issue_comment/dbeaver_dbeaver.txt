Currently it is not possible to create folders in the project root folder.
Also there is no Create Project item in navigator menu.
We need additional connection variables: `project.name` and `project.path` to be able to refer project resources in connection properties.
E.g. for ssh key files.

- Driver name

- Do you use tunnels or proxies (SSH, SOCKS, etc)? No

#### Describe the problem you're observing:

I select a default schema in the connection / Initialization / Default schema and in the dropdown menu of the editor called "Active catalog/schema" it is not automaticallý loaded. Each time I connect I have to select the default schema in the ""Active catalog/schema" combo again. In 6.2.1 it worked like a charm.
It happens both in oracle and ibm db2. I haven´t tried with other databases.

#### Steps to reproduce, if exist:

#### Include any warning/errors/backtraces from the logs
<!-- Please, find the short guide how to find logs here: https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/wiki/Log-files-->

Hi,

In the SQL Editor in Auto complete, include information about the index linked to the column. True when it exists, False otherwise.

Include information about the index on the existing card, where it shows information on the data type, precision, scale, etc.

Example:
![dbeaver-index](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/779883/72646752-a2874980-3955-11ea-91b3-d1fe6a471b36.png)

Apache Phoenix has "mixed" schema mode. Some tables are in schemas while others are not (they have schema NULL).
We need to support both ways in Generic driver.
We can create virtual schema `default` and put all orphan tables there. Generic meta model additions are required.

#### Describe the problem you're observing:
I'm trying to filter a foreign key column in the "Data" tab of a table by clicking the filter icon on the column header.
![011_click_filter_icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1968170/72602690-924c7b80-390f-11ea-9ff5-456ecccfcdba.png)


However, instead of displaying the "Filter by" dialog, an error dialog is displayed.
![022_error_dialog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1968170/72603028-29193800-3910-11ea-918a-bbd62f919cd2.png)

#### Steps to reproduce, if exist:
I can deliberately reproduce the issue by doing these actions:
- click the filter icon
- click "Define Description" in the "Filter by" dialog
- choose the primary key column as the description

However, it appears that with some tables the "Define Description" configuration is set to the foreign key table's primary key by default and the error occurs as soon as I click the filter icon. Perhaps that is due to an algorithm being unable to automatically deduce a suitable column to use as the description?

Use the following SQL to set up the tables to deliberately invoke the error:
```SQL
-- create reference table
CREATE TABLE reference_table (
    ref_id NUMBER(10,0) PRIMARY KEY,
    number_col NUMBER(10,0) NOT NULL,
    another_number_col NUMBER(10,0) NOT NULL
    )
;

-- create table with foreign key
CREATE TABLE foreign_key_table (
    id NUMBER(10,0) PRIMARY KEY,
    ref_id NUMBER(10,0) NOT NULL,
    another_col NUMBER(10,0) NOT NULL
    )
;
-- add foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE foreign_key_table ADD CONSTRAINT MY_FK FOREIGN KEY (ref_id)
    REFERENCES reference_table(ref_id);

-- insert data
INSERT INTO reference_table (ref_id, number_col, another_number_col)
    SELECT  level, (100 + level), 10000 + (111 * level)
    FROM    dual
    CONNECT BY
            level <= 10000
;
INSERT INTO foreign_key_table (id, ref_id, another_col)
    SELECT  level * 10, level, (111 * level) - 99
    FROM    dual
    CONNECT BY
            level <= 10000
;
```

Issue #6694 appears similar but in that case the issue was not reproducible.

The error log contains the following error:
