We create albums in Microsoft OneDrive by creating a new folder in the pictures folder: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2763488/71991609-70aa1080-31fa-11ea-955e-8d12b76f4bc5.png)

These show up fine in the files viewer and I can see the different albums but they don't show up in the photo albums view here: https://onedrive.live.com/?v=photos&id=albums 
(Clicking on all photos does show the photos in those albums)

Not sure if this is a limitation of the way photos are supported on onedrive, or the result of not populating some field on upload. 
After testing [master](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/commit/afe064f1fcc74fa1a6865bd7ca6f2934fc3a3d69) to see if it fixed the errors I had seen transfering contacts Google -> Microsoft, and reporting behavior [here on #786](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/issues/786#issuecomment-553969663), I figured I'd try another transfer type to see how that fared.

I tried transfering mail Google -> Microsoft. I tried with a Google account with lots of mail. I see a lot more output here compared to the contacts transfer, but unfortunately lots of Exception stack traces. The transfer is still running, and at this point I don't see any mail in https://outlook.live.com/mail/0/archive (assuming that's the right place to look).

I pasted 1000 lines of logs at http://distbin.com/activities/b0343e5e-2e73-4a79-abd4-886930d6b87e. There are a lot of mentions of things like:
* "com.google.inject.ProvisionException: Unable to provision, see the following errors"
* "Error in custom provider, java.lang.IllegalArgumentException"

Hiya.

I have a client that would like to use DTP to transfer data to a [Solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_(web_decentralization_project)) data pod.

I see that there is some code in here related to transferring contacts to/from Solid (which appears to have been started by @bwillard, who I met once at MyData 2018. Hi Brian!):
* https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/tree/master/extensions/data-transfer/portability-data-transfer-solid
* https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/tree/master/extensions/data-transfer/portability-data-transfer-solid/src/test/java/org/datatransferproject/transfer/solid

The thing is, I can't figure out how to use it when running the DTP Demo docker container using [Running Locally](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/blob/master/Documentation/RunningLocally.md) docs.

I have created a [public instance](https://data-transfer-project.app-demos.permanent.cloud) of the DTP Demo to test with.

I expect (hope) to be able to follow these steps:
1. Go to: https://data-transfer-project.app-demos.permanent.cloud/data
2. Choose 'contacts' from the data type dropdown. Click Next
3. Find 'Solid' in either/both of the 'from' and 'to' "Choose a Service" dropdowns.
    * But instead I only see "Microsoft" and "Google"

I looked into the Angular app, and I believe I learned that these options come from [the TransferService](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/blob/master/client-rest/src/app/transfer/transfer.service.ts#L13), which requests this API:
* https://data-transfer-project.app-demos.permanent.cloud/api/transfer/services/CONTACTS
    * Solid isn't listed in here either.

All this leads me to believe that perhaps the solid-related code from portability-data-transfer-solid isn't activated or exposed in the API, at least by default and in the build for the [docker hub container image](https://hub.docker.com/r/datatransferproject/demo/).

Does anyone know how I can make use of the Solid transfer extension for DTP? Ideally:
* I would see Solid as an option in the transfer contacts API: https://data-transfer-project.app-demos.permanent.cloud/api/transfer/services/CONTACTS
* I would see solid as an option in the demo angular app
* I could create transfers to/from Solid using the API

Appreciative to anyone who donates attention and help,

Hey there. I'm so glad this project exists. Thanks for working on it and helping me out.

I'm wondering if it's possible to run the [datatransferproject/demo](https://hub.docker.com/r/datatransferproject/demo) container image from docker hub, but in such a way that it listens for http requests, not https. This is because I'd like to access the running container through a reverse proxy that I'd prefer speak http to the application.

Currently, when I follow the instructions for [Run Locally](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/blob/master/Documentation/RunningLocally.md), and then issue an http request like this, I get an error:
```
$ curl http://localhost:3000
<html>
<head><title>400 The plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS port</title></head>
<body bgcolor="white">
<center><h1>400 Bad Request</h1></center>
<center>The plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS port</center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.10.3</center>
</body>
</html>
```

Of course, `curl -k https://localhost:3000` works, but only because of `-k`. I'd like to be able to run the image such that the above request succeeds with an HTTP 200 response.

I can see [in here](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/blob/master/distributions/demo-google-deployment/resources/config/api.yaml) that it's possible to configure the application such that `useHttps=false`. But AFAICT, this yaml file has to be built into the jar file that is run by this docker container, and that jar file in the docker hub image is preconfigured to have useHttps=true.

I'm a noob when it comes to Java. **Is there any way for me to run the docker hub demo image in a way that useHttps=false?** For example, by setting an environment variable and/or mounting a custom configuration file.

If not, would it make sense to add this as a feature to how the app boots up? I could pass an env variable pointing to my own common config yaml file (or alternatively env variables for each config like useHttps).

In lieu of advice or such a feature, the only way I can think of doing this without building/hosting a custom image is to somehow override the container image's command to:
* unzip the /app/demo-server-all.jar contents
* edit config/common.yaml (or api.yaml?) to add `useHttps: false`
* rezip the jar
* run the jar as the image otherwise would

Thanks for your advice!

Currently AppCredential keys are assembled in different ways between the transfer worker and the api:
- On the API the names are automatically derived from the service name https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/blob/228378c5d92cd5853e26080f4328161f6c154a97/libraries/auth/src/main/java/org/datatransferproject/auth/OAuth1ServiceExtension.java#L87
- On the transfer worker they are fully written out https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/blob/3555f624bf098fb41fd9fcb25836060f20e141c4/extensions/data-transfer/portability-data-transfer-google/src/main/java/org/datatransferproject/datatransfer/google/GoogleTransferExtension.java#L83

We should write a Util class which calculates the keys based on the service name and use it in both the API and the transfer worker.

In the photos importer, albums are always prefixed with `Copy of `. I know there's a `TODO` to i18n-ize it, but it would be nice if there were a way to omit the prefix altogether. 

We're planning to ask users to supply a name for the new album, and don't want `Copy of ` prepended to that. 

It's possible tools might want to name the albums themselves, e.g. `Flickr Export (04 October 2019)`.

Thanks for considering this!

They have a drive API maybe they have one specifically for photos as well? 
We recommend google-java-format in the developer documentation for the project but we do not currently automatically check contributions for code style. We should add a Travis CI step to check the formatting on each pull request.
