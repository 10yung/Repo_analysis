This is desirable to prove authorship, and because some AV/firewall software complains about unsigned executables. Electron builder signs too many files, including files that are already signed by Microsoft, etc., so select files are signed in `build.sh` instead.

More files could be signed, eg Windows modules.

This PR reworks the ping monitor to use traffic data from `wireguard-go` to infer whether a WireGuard tunnel is actually working.
This brings about extra timeouts:
- timeout for seeing an increase in received traffic over the tunnel - 5 seconds
- timeout for seeing any traffic in the tunnel - 120 seconds
- ICMP timeout - 15 seconds

The new connectivity checker will infer that the tunnel is working fine by _analyzing_ the traffic data. If there seems to be an issue, an ICMP packet will be sent to the gateway. No response will be waited for, connectivity will be infered by observing whether there was an increase in received traffic after the ICMP packet was sent. To aid in delivery, an ICMP packet is being sent every 3 seconds. 
ICMP packets will be sent to the server to see if the tunnel is working in the following conditions:
- if the last time traffic was received was more than 5 seconds after traffic was sent out over the tunnel
- If no traffic has been sent or received in the last 120 seconds

The changes above are expected to improve the connection stability (by not relying on ICMP responses being delivered 100% of the time) and decreasing the traffic overhead to verify connectivity (by inferring connectivity by counting the amount of traffic that's received over the tunnel). The newly introduced timeouts are subject to change after more extensive testing has been done.

These changes rely on https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app-binaries/pull/56

Currently, I cannot get Mullvad to work with [Windows Sandbox](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-kernel-internals/windows-sandbox/ba-p/301849). When running the Mullvad VPN app as the host, the sandbox never has internet connection when the Mullvad VPN app is active. I can get internet access inside of the sandbox if I disconnect from Mullvad.

This PR replaces the manual `mullvad_jni::FromJava` implementations with `jnix::FromJava` derivations.

Git checklist:

* [x] Describe the change in **`CHANGELOG.md`** under the `[Unreleased]` header. **Internal refactor, no user visible changes.**
* [x] Check that commits follow the [Mullvad coding guidelines](https://github.com/mullvad/coding-guidelines)

Hello guys and thank your for your wonderful job . I run android 9 (aosp) at 2019.10-beta2 with redmi 4a . 
I have -always on VPN and the battery drain is huge . is there any update coming soon ? is it known?
I know the typical Gentoo user would rather stick to wg-quick, but I wonder if anyone else is interested in an eBuild for Gentoo?
The app refuses to install on unofficial Lineage 14.1 ROMs (Android 7.1.2) with the error Android 5.0 min .... not sure what are the variables checked by the apk ... tested with Nexus 5 (hammerhead) and nexus 7 2012 WiFi (grouper)  
Hey I'm having trouble with the mullvad vpn client app for linux causing a memory leak in gnome-shell.

Here I have listed steps to reproduce as well as things I have tried to remedy the problem.

. Install ubuntu 19.10

2. Download latest.deb file from mullvad website here: https://mullvad.net/en/download/

3. Name of file after downloading: MullvadVPN-2019.10_amd64.deb

4. Install

5. Run the mullvad app

6. Notice gnome-shell freezes for a few seconds. Amount of time it freezes varies from time to time but no more than 10 seconds.

7. Open gnome-system-monitor

8. Notice a sizable increase in memory allocation to gnome-shell. It varies each time. I have noticed upwards of 1 gb being used. I wanted to be as accurate as possible so I am doing this as I type and in this particular instance I have noticed an increased of around 400 MiB

Steps taken to Fix:

1. Uninstall and reinstall mullvad -----Conclusion - Did not work.

2. Uninstall all extensions except for the 4 that I knew were working before the slowdown ----- Conclusion - Did not work.

3. Install older version of mullvad app -----Conclusion did not work.

4. Fresh install of ubuntu 19.10 -----Conclusion - Fixed slightly, the app still freezes gnome-shell for the length of time stated earlier but the memory leak is not as big or non existent. Right now I am seeing aproximatley 150 Mib left over. However after performing this test again gnome-shell shot up to using 1 Gib. All of this as reported by gnome-system-monitor

Thoughts currently: maybe some update to one of the libraries that the app relies on has caused a problem.

P.S.

    Hope this helps. Let me know if there is anymore information I can provide.

Hi ðŸ‘‹, loving Mullvad, thank you.

I just noticed that there was an update to the Mac client, but if I hadn't just manually opened the VPN to change locations, there's no telling how long it would have been until I noticed that there was an update. Please consider changing the icon, or popping up a message on start up/connection about an update, so that we can always stay up to date!
Can we get a label with the server ownership in the long list of the servers? That would be a nice little detail to have.
thanks
