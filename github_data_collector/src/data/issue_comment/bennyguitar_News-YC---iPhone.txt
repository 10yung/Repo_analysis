It would be really cool to have "Fold" as an option on the comment menu to collapse sub threads. 

Thanks for the awesome app. I wasn't able to run the code when I cloned it. Will this repo be updated to 3.3.0?

I cloned the repo and after doing pod install, I still get an error saying "Colours.h" file not found. Can you help?

This is an issue from a review. Here's the full text:

> Working again. Thank you guys! Dropped my star rating cause there us an issue where the app takes over music control. Gotta be able to listen to the music app and use this app.

When selecting to share an article on Twitter or Facebook nothing happens. Am I missing something or is this a real issue?  I am on version 7.1 if that matters.
