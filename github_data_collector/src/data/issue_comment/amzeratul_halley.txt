This engine looks really promising, just surprised there's so little documentation.  Is it just stored here for you to use, or do you plan on writing that out?
OS: Windows 7
Compiler: VS 2019 (16.3.10)
CMake: 3.15, version included with MSVC
Boost: 1.70
SDL: 2.0.10
Freetype: 2.10.0

I don't think I have the Win10 SDK installed.

I get a bunch of errors like the following when compiling:
``C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Include\um\combaseapi.h(229,21): error C2760: syntax error: unexpected token 'identifier', expected 'type specifier' (compiling source file H:\src\halley\src\engine\utils\src\support\StackWalker\StackWalker.cpp) [H:\src\halley\build\src\engine\utils\halley-utils.vcxproj]``
``C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Include\um\wbemdisp.h(1088,62): error C2440: 'default argument': cannot convert from 'const wchar_t [1]' to 'BSTR' (compiling source file H:\src\halley\src\engine\utils\src\os\os.cpp) [H:\src\halley\build\src\engine\utils\halley-utils.vcxproj]
``

This looks to be a Windows bug when /permissive- is passed to the compiler: https://github.com/Microsoft/krabsetw/issues/42

The BSTR stuff mostly leads me to StackOverflow answers where people don't seem to be able to spot that the compiler is complaining about a default argument; it looks like a similar issue though.


Fixed issue with asio on linux, the callback forasync_read_some never gets called on the client side. I think it might be a problem with asio on linux. Created work object to keep the service 'alive'. This caused an issue where DevConClient never hot reloaded resources
cling based C++ as scripting language / hot code reload
Why? Able to run C++ script in runtime or compile it for max speed ( as in example https://github.com/derofim/cling-cmake )

This is really hard to see with the default number of entities, but halley-test-entity example renders the whole spritesheet instead of an animation. Here is a screenshot with a single entity.

Hey I did cmake then make to compile Halley but with the make command I have `Importing ubuntub.ttf` and it takes a very long time. I'm using Arch Linux
This should fix a small bug in the family code, namely one that occurs whenever the following is given:
* A family contains 2 or more entities
* 2 or more of those entities are deleted and added in the same frame

This bug then lead to only one of the entities to be properly updated.

The steps within the code, that lead to this problem are as following:
```
toRemove = {1, 2}
entities = {1(old), 2(old), 1(new), 2(new) }
```
During the first iteration it picks entities[0] {1(old}} and finds it in toRemove, deletes it from there and swaps it with entities[3]{ 2(new) }, leading to the following situation:
```
toRemove = {2}
entities = {2(new), 2(old), 1(new), 1(old) }
```
During the second iteration, it picks entities[0] {2(new)} and finds it in toRemove, deletes it from there and swaps it with entities[2] {1(new)}, leading to the final situation:
```
toRemove = {}
entities = {1(new), 2(old), 2(new), 1(old) }
```
Which then leads to 2(new) and 1(old) to be deleted

This change buffers the swaps in a vector, before executing them all at once, ensuring that the swaps already executed don't change the result of later forward scans through entities.
I'm useing Window 7,VS2017,successfully compile halley-template example.
But while run the app,It says

Unhandled exception : Unable to load resource .../halley-template/assets/game.dat

I checked folder there is no game.dat file there,so what should I do to run a success example?
Been going through the code and noticed if you run halley-editor without a path it does `void EditorRootStage::createLoadProjectUI()`

The editor runs fine but I'm not seeing any of the ui thats in the config file and the console outputs

> Starting main loop.
> Input buttons binding not found: "list".
> N6Halley8Vector4DIfEE not found in UI style: button.labelBorder

Am I doing something wrong?
