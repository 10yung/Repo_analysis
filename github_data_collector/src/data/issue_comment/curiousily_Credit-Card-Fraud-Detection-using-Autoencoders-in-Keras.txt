Hi,
     I got your data now, but i have a question, could you please share the raw-data or show the way how you process the data? Thank you very much.

Regards!



```python
input_layer = Input(shape=(input_dim, ))

encoder = Dense(encoding_dim, activation="tanh", 
                activity_regularizer=regularizers.l1(10e-5))(input_layer)
encoder = Dense(int(encoding_dim / 2), activation="relu")(encoder)

decoder = Dense(int(encoding_dim / 2), activation='tanh')(encoder)
decoder = Dense(input_dim, activation='relu')(decoder)

autoencoder = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=decoder)
```

From the fraud_detection.ipynb, there's model using relu as last layer. However, the csv file contains negative values which relu cannot represent. I think the last layer of decoder should represent the input value. Wouldn't it be an issue?

Thanks.
