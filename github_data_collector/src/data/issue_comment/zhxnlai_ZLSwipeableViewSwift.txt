Is there a way we can swipe the cards in random directions for few seconds or a given time and then stop the animation? I am trying to achieve automatic swipe animation of cards in random directions on single button click and it should animate for few seconds and then stop it. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
I have tried but no luck

Hi, thanks for your great job! I notice that the latest version of ZLSwipeableViewSwift is ``0.0.8``.However, the version in specs repo is ``0.0.7``. Would you mind push your spec to specs repo so everybody can use this framework in swift 4 and later?
How to insert View to the back with animation? like rewind inserts View to front with animation!
Closure `swipeableView.animateView` is called multiple times. In my case with `numberOfActiveView` equal to 2 `swipeableView.animateView` is called 3 times for 1st view and 3 times for 2 view. This is incorrect, the correct behaviour should be 1 time per view.

As I found in your code it happens because of this:

```
open var nextView: NextViewHandler? {
        didSet {
            loadViews()
        }
    }
```

  ```
  open func loadViews() {
        for _ in UInt(activeViews().count) ..< numberOfActiveView {
            if let nextView = nextView?() {
                insert(nextView, atIndex: 0)
            }
        }
        updateViews()
    }
```

actually as I understand these lines are the root cause (they create a loop and `updateViews()` method is called 3 times instead of 1):
`if let nextView = nextView?() {`
`didSet { loadViews() }`


After rewinding, I am not able to interact with the top card(previous card) at all. When dragging, only the cards below it is being moved.
What function should I subclass to have this effect
