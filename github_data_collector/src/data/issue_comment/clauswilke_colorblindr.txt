I juist wanted to confirm that this package doesn't support continuous scales?  I'm not missing anything?
Hello,

I just wanted to give a short heads up about a minor issue I stumbled upon:

when playing around with this great package I just realized some unexpected behaviour with when using geom_label() in combination cvd_grid() -  somehow the color of this particular geom stays untouched:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(colorblindr)
#> Loading required package: colorspace

p <- tibble(label = 'test') %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_segment(aes(x = -1, xend = 1,y = 0, yend = 0, color = label))+
  geom_label(aes(x=0,y=0,label = label, color = label))+
  theme_void()

cvd_grid(p)
```

We should prepare a proper release. What is still needed? Here are some things I can think about:

- [ ] Move github repo to wilkelab. This allows us to add a pkgdown website and host it under wilkelab.org, as in https://wilkelab.org/isoband/ or https://wilkelab.org/ungeviz/.
- [ ] Check dependencies. Do we depend on the development version of cowplot, as the readme states? The listed dependency is >0.8.0, and the version on CRAN is 0.9.4, so this should be fine.
- [ ] No packages other than base R should be listed under "Depends". All other dependencies should be listed under "Imports".
- [ ] Update installation instructions in the readme.
- [ ] Review all vignettes.
- [ ] Remove the ggplot2 color scales vignette. It is outdated and there are other packages now that focus specifically on color scales, e.g. [paletteer](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=paletteer).

Something else?
Hello!

Do you think it would be possible to create individual functions for each of the colorblind types? I think that it is very useful to display them in a single grid, but it would also be nice to have some flexibility in how we present them.

Happy to help with a PR for this, and also with any help you might like in submitting this to CRAN - this is a super useful package!
Hi,
when I install the "colorbindr" package, I got the error: Does not appear to be an R package (no DESCRIPTION)
