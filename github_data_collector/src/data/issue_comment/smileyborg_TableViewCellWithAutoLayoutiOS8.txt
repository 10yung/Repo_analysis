Hi,
I'm working with UITableview for chat application it's working very well in update and insert cell but when scroll the tableview bottom to top tableview cell jerking and no smoothly scrolling.
*Note-> I'm not using storyboard and i've used to custom cells (Objective c) 
So Please any solution.
Regards

I was doing some testing with landscape mode on the iPhone X simulator which is why I revisited this project after a long time.

Not sure if you'll care about this PR but I did a quick port of the codebase up to Swift 3 & Xcode 8 (I also did an additional port to Swift 4 & Xcode 9 which is in a different branch).  

Hope it helps!
I've turned `bodyLabel`'s class `UILabel` into `UIButton`(As you can see in pic1 ~ pic3).  As you know, `UIButton` also has its intrinsic content size (just like `UILabel`). I just want to have the cell's subviews "exert pressure" and make the content view expand to fit them. But the cell height became same and, of course, went wrong(As you can see in pic4 and pic5). Can anybody tell me why and what should I do to solve this problem?

Fix Xcode 7.3 selector error and swift warnings

When using your demo as is with current Xcode 7.3 and e.g. iOS Simulator iPad Air 2 on iOS 8.1 (12B411), the margins are wrong compared to the separator insets:

<img width="768" alt="screenshot 2016-04-14 01 27 03" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1413291/14512546/3425b040-01e0-11e6-86b7-7b156c4d9373.png">

After trying this I used the nib instead and made the following adjustments (as you had hardcoded +/- 15 points as margins), which should work:

**CellIdentifier**: Preserve Superview margins checked
**Content View**: Preserve Superview margins checked
**Leading/Trailing Constraints**: Each leading/trailing set to constant 0, but pinned to superview's margin instead of superview

**Expected:**
Margins automatically adjusted

**Actual:**

I am trying this for about a week (!), do you know of any official way to get the margins right with iOS 8.1 and 8.2? Btw: Margins are broken when used in Form Sheets with iPhone 6+ in Landscape with iOS 9.x, too (they differ from the separator insets as well).

Any idea?

When I set the vertical insets to some higher value the contraints of the UITableViewCell break.
Not shure what is causing it.
It seems to be the size of cells content view. But leveraging that size upwards does't lead to a solution.

    Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. 
    Try this: 
        (1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; 
        (2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. 
(
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x17e97900 V:|-(16)-[UILabel:0x17e96600'Thonburi']   (Names: '|':UITableViewCellContentView:0x17d99fc0 )>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x17da1a80 V:[UILabel:0x17e96600'Thonburi']-(16)-[UILabel:0x17d9b1c0'Lorem ipsum dolor sit ame...']>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x17da2bc0 UILabel:0x17d9b1c0'Lorem ipsum dolor sit ame...'.bottom == UITableViewCellContentView:0x17d99fc0.bottom - 16>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x17e96fa0 'UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Height' V:[UITableViewCellContentView:0x17d99fc0(44)]>"
)

Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint 
<NSLayoutConstraint:0x17da1a80 V:[UILabel:0x17e96600'Thonburi']-(16)-[UILabel:0x17d9b1c0'Lorem ipsum dolor sit ame...']>
