I've moved away from using this in my projects and I'm redirecting people over to something new.

This is a pre-release version that I can use to deprecate behavior for our usage at heroku.

I don't know where that'll leave this project going forward.
As per GitHub's [blog](https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-04-06-deployment-and-deployment-status-enhancements/) and [documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments), there are now new options for deployments (transient, production, auto_inactive). This PR implements support for those options. 

Note that although the samples in `config_file.md` don't show entries such as `heroku_test_name`, those are still carried over in the payload. They would now better fit in the `provider_env_name` entry. 

`slack.coffee` and `hipchat.coffee` are unused and burried in the `docs` folder. They could be useful just as they are. 

With this new `HUBOT_DEPLOY_ADAPTER` env var, it is easier to leverage them
