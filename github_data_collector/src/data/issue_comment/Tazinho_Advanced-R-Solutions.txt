Hi,

Let me start by thanking you for this great handbook and the exercises! I'm new to the whole TidyEval and this book is really helping me.

While doing the exercises (and looking at solutions) for **section 19.3**, I came across two inconsistencies:

**Question 3**
You expect the following output (given in question)
`(x + y) + (y + z) - (x + y)`

Though I only could get the code to look like this
```
expr(!!xy + !!yz -!!xy)
x + y + (y + z) - (x + y)
```
This is also the solution. However, the questions seems to suggest you need the parenthesis around the first x + y which is confusing and made me spent 15 min trying to achieve just that :)

**Question 8**
Your question asks for the following output
`foo(a = x + y, b = y + z)`

But in your answer, you forgot to use the !! resulting in the output:
`foo(a = xy, b = yz)`

Keep up the great work!

The hard-coded first answer had the incorrect assignment of x resulting in only one line of output.

- [x] Sync subsection names
- [x] Ensure that exercise numbers go 1,2,3,.. in each subsection.
- [x] Ensure linebreaks between Q & As
- [x] Sync the text and the order of all exercises in the chapter between Adv R and Adv R Solutions.

Read through all exercises. Edit them if possible and mark their correct status (green = "think this solution is correct", orange = "this solution is definitely not correct or sth. is missing". If sth. is missing, try to includede a todo). Also document open points within the following checklist:

### [HTML](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/translating-r-code.html#html)
- [ ] The escaping rules for <script> tags are different because they contain JavaScript...
- [ ] The use of ... for all functions has some big downsides....
- [ ] Reason about the following code that calls with_html() referening...
- [ ] Currently the HTML doesn’t look terribly pretty, and it’s hard to see the structure...
### [LaTeX](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/translating-r-code.html#latex)
- [ ] Add escaping. The special symbols that should be escaped by adding a backslash
- [ ]  Complete the DSL to support all the functions that plotmath supports.

- [ ] All open points/exercises should now be reported explicitly under each bullet point above (maybe henningsway can solve one or the other, has a good idea for a new approach or has a more specific question to raise in an issue to Hadley. 

- [ ] Assign Henningsway

@henningsway 
- [ ] Read & edit all exercises.
- [ ] Report any new points while updating the list above. 
- [ ] Run a final spellcheck

@Tazinho and @henningsway 
- [ ] Try to resolve any of the reported issues above.
