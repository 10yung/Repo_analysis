not file **PDB.settings.targets** and **VCTools.targets** in repo!?

```
  <!--Import the settings-->
<Import Project="$(_NTDRIVE)$(_NTROOT)\vctools\PDB\PDB.settings.targets" />
```

```
  <!-- Import the targets -->
<Import Project="$(_NTDRIVE)$(_NTROOT)\vctools\VCTools.targets" />
```
Corrected headers in the file.
some suggested improvements to the README

Little grammatical changes in **_README.md_** file.

So, I used cvdump to dump my PDB file. I would like to understand what these values in S_PUB32 mean:

eg.
`S_PUB32: [0001:00001B80], Flags: 00000002, ___security_init_cookie`

I understand that `00001B80` means that `__security_init_cookie` is found at 00001B80 offset to the image base address, but I do not understand what the other values mean.
Dumb question time - how can I use cvdump.exe, and what would I use it for?
