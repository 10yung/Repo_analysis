Hi,  are there any plans for supporting [setShowBadge ](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationChannel#setShowBadge(boolean))in channel config? 

Thanks
Are there any plans to support setFullScreenIntent?
I know I can get asBuilder() and apply setFullScreenIntent but it is not desirable 

Thanks
I don't like it grey![](https://i.imgur.com/lFkTvoH.jpg)
In apps I tend to give notification creation responsibility to injectable interface that has a "Real" implementation. The interface is mocked in my tests. 

I could see this being a very big use case for this library in addition to the already great convenience. Since you're using Kotlin, this could just be an companion object extension that could be a `testImplementation` dependency. Something like:

```kotlin
Notify.withMock(context)
   ...
   .show()
```

Internally, it would use [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) or some internal class that isn't the real Android framework class. 
## Additional Notification Types
> **Note**: This is an ongoing discussion, planned notification types will be documented here.

- [ ] **STEPPER NOTIFICATION**
    A 'Stepper' notification type introduces the ability to step through a list of views -- it would be styled similar to the Google Maps navigation notification.
