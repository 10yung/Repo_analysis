Someone at Microsoft just thought it was a good idea to translate the English roles in French in the FR version of Sharepoint.
So, you need to modify in AutoSPInstallerModule.psm1
Line 3402 3403 3404 3409 3415 etc  "Full rights" to "Contrôle total" (yes, with ô)

Maybe the same one embedded a special char instead of space (twice) in the name of the Sharepoint 2013 Management Shell.lnk, namely: Microsoft SharePoint $spYear Products\SharePoint $spYear Management Shell.lnk

And in autoInstallerModule.psm1, line 2618, one more translation
"Full Access to Term Store" => "Magasin de termes avec accès total" (which means nothing in French BTW)

Additionally, Creating site Collection "http://portal" is failing everytime with accessdenied error. I have to create it by hand to go on.

Is there a reason to use CU5 for AppFabric exclusively for SP2013?
It works way better performance wise with CU7 + backgroundGC patch (http://www.jeremytaylor.net/2015/09/17/how-to-patch-sharepoint-distributed-cache-the-proper-way/)
Received this error "new-spwebapplication cannot bind argument be parameter applicationpool because it is null" after creating the my sites.  Digged deeper, found out that the variable $mysiteAppPool on line 3298 is not initialized and is used in some scenario.  I installed the web sites to non standard ports, not sure whether that caused the issue or not.  

Anyway, I manually initialized the variable $mysiteAppPool to the applicationpool in order for the script to continue.
Not a show stopper but here is how its behaving and if some one can provide better work around that will be great. 
Script will try to add managed accounts after provisioning CA and before creating any web applications and in case you don't have interactive logon enabled for those accounts it will fail to create local profiles. In my case accounts were not allowed interactive logon and were member of DenyInteractivelogon security policy. 
```

```
So after failed attempt to add first account in to the managed account script will not try to add rest of the accounts and  continues to create web applications and failed as it cant find the app pool account because it was not was not read in the step mentioned above ( adding managed account ) 
you will see some thing like that
```
Exception             : Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell.SPCmdletException: ApplicationPoolAccount is not found.

FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell.SPCmdletNewSPWebApplication
```
To avoid this I had to comment out the creation of local profile and it successfully added all the managed accounts and then was able to create web application with out any issues. 
```
line #2259
Start-Process -WorkingDirectory "$env:SYSTEMROOT\System32\" -FilePath "cmd.exe" -ArgumentList "/C" -LoadUserProfile -NoNewWindow -Credential $credAccount
```

we cant have interactive log on for any accounts other then admin and farm which will go away soon as well. Any suggestions or better solution will help others in the same situation ? 
is: 
$spVer = Get-MajorVersionNumber $spYear

should be:
$spYear = $xmlInput.Configuration.Install.SPVersion
$spVer = Get-MajorVersionNumber $spYear

I've recently setup SharePoint 2019 with limited database privilege (`dbcreator`, `securityadmin`) for setup account. During User Profile Service provision, I encountered the following error messages.

There is one suggestion from [Wouter Bleeker](https://blog.wobl.it/2015/11/add-spshelladmin-cannot-add-x-to-the-sharepoint_shell_access-role/) suggesting that the setup account should be granted to `sysadmin` which is impossible for my situation. I resolved this problem by running that two commands (Line 3371 and 3373) within elevated Farm account privilege which the AutoSPInstaller had already used this technique during creating User Profile Service application (the `CreateUpsAsAdmin` function).

Hope that this will be integrated to the master branch.
In a two node MinRole farm, you should be able to select just Application and Search for one server, and Front-End / Distributed cache for the other server.

However it still complains that is invalid installation scenario on web front end as shown here:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6610039/58831805-241ea700-8613-11e9-8802-acdf56f1d61e.png)

For several customers on different environments, we have the problem that the initial installation of SharePoint 2019 does not activate the Search Service Application. We install SharePoint 2019 with AutoSPInstaller and use a separate service account for the Search Service Application. Here is the error:

Exception : System.Management.Automation.MethodInvocationException: Exception calling "Activate" with "0"
argument(s): "Topology activation job died prematurely, the topology already is in Activating
state." --->
Microsoft.Office.Server.Search.Administration.Topology.SearchTopologyActivationException:
Topology activation job died prematurely, the topology already is in Activating state.
at Microsoft.Office.Server.Search.Administration.Topology.SearchTopology.ActivateSilently()
at CallSite.Target(Closure , CallSite , Object )

The problem can only be solved if the Search Service Application is created under the Farm account.
Are you aware of this problem and is there a solution that activates the Search Service Application under the Search Service Account?

Have previously created mysite host web app and site collection earlier in the process using the appropriate managed path. followed instruction not to include mysite host in the  user profile service provision section as it was created earlier in the process. Carry out the process by dragging the install xml onto AutoSPInstallerLaunch.
