Trying to reproduce UBSAN error of CRAN package bigstatsr: https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_bigstatsr.html.

I downloaded the tag.gz from CRAN and ran `rhub::check_with_sanitizers("bigstatsr_1.0.1.tar.gz")`.

I'm getting this: https://builder.r-hub.io/status/bigstatsr_1.0.1.tar.gz-be07b51f1e5245a29edc11fc9932c19e.
I don't know how to interpret this and I don't get the same error as on CRAN (don't get any ERROR? Just a WARNING not sure where).
I'm having a hard time interpreting these build results, and there is no artifact produced.

Can anyone help please?
It would be cool if the [rust](https://rustup.rs/) toolchain would be available on Windows, Mac and Linux images.
I've just run `check_for_cran()` and got this failure by email

```r
* checking package dependencies ... ERROR
Package suggested but not available: ‘covr’

The suggested packages are required for a complete check.
Checking can be attempted without them by setting the environment
variable _R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_ to a false value.

See section ‘The DESCRIPTION file’ in the ‘Writing R Extensions’
manual.
```

I actually don't need `covr` and should remove it from DESCRIPTION (if only [someone wrote a blog post to make me realize such issues](https://github.com/r-hub/blog/issues/48) :grimacing: ) but was wondering why covr was unavailable.
Thank you for making this package.  I receive the following note on `windows-x86_64-devel (r-devel)` similar to issues #51, #82, and #263: 
```

  Unable to find GhostScript executable to run checks on size reduction

Can this note be ignored?

I have tried to find the closest match on rhub to r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-clang.  I know from experience that the version CRAN uses does not support UTF8.   So I have been using  rhub debian-clang-devel  along with various other debian platforms.  When the tests run on rhub they pass, but on CRAN they fail.  This seems to be due to UTF8 support (or lack thereof).   As of now you can see it here:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_skimr.html

I know how to fix the issue, but I'm wondering why the tests pass on rhub or if I should be using a different platform. 
try to avoid warnings during check_for_cran when checking fedora platforms
Currently the rebuild of the of vignette outputs delivers a warning. 

Error: processing vignette 'Introduction.Rnw' failed with diagnostics:
Running 'texi2dvi' on 'Introduction.tex' failed.
LaTeX errors:
! LaTeX Error: File <framed.sty' not found.

Although it looks like some CRAN packages that I am dependent on are not available on the Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS platform because of openssl not being found. I have attached the link to the log and the first error report I found within that log.
