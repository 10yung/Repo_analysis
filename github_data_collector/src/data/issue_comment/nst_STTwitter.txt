After updating the to the latest iOS11 recommended XCode project settings there are a number of warnings.  This PR just cleans up the warnings so that the STTwitter source compiles without any warnings.
Twitter is turning off many legacy APIs, including:

User Streams
Site Streams
GET direct_messages
GET direct_messages/sent
GET direct_messages/show
POST direct_messages/destroy

STTwitter should be updated to take advantage of the new set of APIs *by June 19th*. Otherwise existing endpoints this library provides will become broken. If STTwitter will not be updated, I believe this library should be marked "unsupported"...
Hi,

thanks for the STTwitter library. I got some warnings _This block declaration is not a prototype_ for the library in a desktop project, I think it started with XCode 9.2. Most of them are easily to patch by applying the void in the empty declaration but some are not so easy to fix.
I could provide my humble corrections in a pull request...

Hey!

I did a couple of little changes on STTwitterAPI to be able to upload a video, from which I already have the NSData, directly to Twitter through STTwitter instead of having to upload it to a server in order to get the url (preventing to have to upload it and then download it, twice). 

Do you think you can add this changes to the repo? Or give me access to push it myself?

Thanks!

Firstly thanks alot for your efforts in this amazing library 

i was using it to make a simple twitter client app but i have a problem in saving the user account to the device settings after i log in to it on my app could you help please 
I was trying to send a request to the Twitter API with JSON data instead of the usual form-encoded data but was not able to find any method that I could do this with.

Is this not possible currently with STTwitter?
Hello

is it possibile to use STTwitter with [Twitter Kit](https://dev.twitter.com/twitterkit/ios/) or what is the best practice one has to follow to use it on iOS 11
Since the removal of Twitter from iOS Settings the only thing that is left is to authenticate through a web view...
Any chance of making STTwitter installable using Carthage?
