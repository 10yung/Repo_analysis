Bumps [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) from 3.10.1 to 4.17.13.
<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [lodash's releases](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/releases).*

> ## 4.0.0
> # [lodash v4.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400)
> 
> 2015 was big year! [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) became the [most depended on](https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491#file-01-most-dependent-upon-md) npm package, passed [1 billion](http://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=&author=jdalton) downloads, & its v3 release saw massive adoption!
> 
> The year was also one of collaboration, as discussions began on [merging Lodash & Underscore](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/underdash/underdash/issues/14). Much of Lodash v4 is proofing out the ideas from those discussions. Lodash v4 **would not be possible** without the collaboration & contributions of the Underscore core team. In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with [several members](https://github.com/orgs/lodash/people) contributing to both libraries.
> 
> For 2016 & [lodash v4.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400) we wanted to cut loose, push forward, & take things up a notch!
> 
> ## Modern only
> 
> With v4 we’re breaking free from [old projects](https://github.com/lodash-archive), old environments, & dropping [old IE < 9 support](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support)!
> 
> ## 4 kB Core
> 
> Lodash’s kitchen-sink size will continue to grow as new methods & functionality are added. However, we now offer a 4 kB (gzipped) [core build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0/dist) that’s compatible with [Backbone v1.2.4](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/3839) for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink.
> 
> ## More ES6
> 
> We’ve continued to embrace ES6 with methods like [_.isSymbol](https://lodash.com/docs#isSymbol), added support for cloning & comparing array buffers, maps, sets, & symbols, converting iterators to arrays, & iterable `_(…)`.
> 
> In addition, we’ve published an [es-build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0-es/) & pulled [babel-plugin-lodash](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash) into core to make tree-shaking a breeze.
> 
> ## More Modular
> 
> Pop quiz! 📣
> 
> What category path does the `bindAll` method belong to? Is it 
> 
> A) `require('lodash/function/bindAll')`
> B) `require('lodash/utility/bindAll')`
> C) `require('lodash/util/bindAll')`
> 
> Don’t know? Well, with v4 it doesn’t matter because now module paths are as simple as
> 
> ``` js
> var bindAll = require('lodash/bindAll');
> ```
> 
> We’ve also reduced module complexity making it easier to create smaller bundles. This has helped Lodash adoption with libraries like [Async](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/caolan/async/pull/996) & [Redux](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rackt/redux/pull/611)!
> 
> ## 1st Class FP
> 
> With v3 we introduced [lodash-fp](https://github.com/lodash-archive/lodash-fp). We learned a lot & with v4 we decided to [pull it into core](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide).
> 
> Now you can get immutable, auto-curried, iteratee-first, data-last methods as simply as
> 
> ``` js
> var _ = require('lodash/fp');
> var object = { 'a': 1 };

I'm trying to figure out how to use plugins (expire specifically) while using typescript.
The Store.set method doesn't accept a third parameter (expiration), even if I call Store.addPlugin(Expire)
Is it possible to check if a field was rewritten between when a value was retrieved and set? I see the update function doesn't do any of the checking. You could just assign a new Date, on writes, and compare them before settings.
Is there a way to clear store for only one namespace?

When I create multiple stores with different namespaces and I call clearAll on any of them,
it clears the data from all the stores.

````
var ns1 = store.namespace('ns1')
var ns2 = store.namespace('ns2')
ns1.set('foo', 'bar1')
ns2.set('foo', 'bar2')
ns1.get('foo') == 'bar1'
ns2.get('foo') == 'bar2'

ns1.clearAll()
ns1.get('foo')  //undefined
ns2.get('foo')  //undefined
````
