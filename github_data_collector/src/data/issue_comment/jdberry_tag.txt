Hi, 
First of all thank you for this very useful tool.
I'm a newbie so sorry if my question is dumb.
I'd need to batch tag a large amount of files (+200000)
The actual list of files works great but is not ok for this purpose, too many entries. I have the paths in a text file, is there's a way Tag could read this text file's files adresses and tag the files?
Thanks in advance
Found it helpful to have a command to invert tag(s).
Having bound it to a hotkey in Finder is a use case for me.
I would need to assign tags to files that contain the comma character, but I cannot find a way to do that. I tried escaping with '\', but this does not work.
It would be nice to be able to specify tags to ignore. For instance, say I tag some files as "archive". I could then run a search as normal but that do not include files tagged as archive. A sample of the command could look like this:

`tag -f Red Yellow Blue -i archive`

This would search for all files that have been tagged "Red", "Yellow", and "Blue", but that do not have the "archive" tag.
I'm trying to recursively add a tag all the files and folders in a path, which is working perfectly except that I have added a simlink to a directory on an external read-only drive, and it's now giving me the error `tag: The operation couldn’t be completed. (OSStatus error -8058.)`. Could you maybe add an option to not follow links?
Rixstep has released a new super-fast tagging app called Rixtag using proprietary xattr, not the default macOS tags: http://rixstep.com/1/20170808,00.shtml
The xattr is `com.rixstep.Rixtag`, and the tags are stored in binary plist as hex data.

Support possible? E.g. as `tag --xattr=com.rixstep.Rixtag <option> <tag(s)> <path(s)>`

In that regard, wouldn't it be easy to let users create their own xattr? E.g.:
`tag --xattr=com.github.jdberry -a <tag(s)> <path(s)>`
and so on…
Right now, if you add or edit tags recursively, it's also applied to the directories themselves.

It would be great if there was a flag or option to make it so that `tag` will not add tags to directories.
It would be useful to have a way to find files with tags matching a regex. As far as I understand there is no way to do it now.
