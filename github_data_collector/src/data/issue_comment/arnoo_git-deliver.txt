We need to invoke bash ourselves to make sure it is.

Ex: init-remote with sh as the shell will not work (it says remote already initialized)

There should be an option for not requiring the user to save the log file, just write it.

Useful if the remote-init scripts have changed

Hi,

Is there an option in git-deliver to change the default ssh port ?

Thanks

What do you think about an installation via brew (the missing PM for OS X : https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew) ?

Like : 

`$ brew install git-deliver`

Create a Formulae with Ruby : 

`$ brew create http://foo.com/bar-1.0.tgz
Created /usr/local/Library/Formula/bar.rb`
source : http://brew.sh/

During humantalks, you said to me that the gc manage 3 folders.

It could be great to add the ability to manage it

Provide an option for automate gc, could be wanted

Hi,

My question sounds maybe like a troll, I'm not here for that, this is just what will be better with git-deliver for example ?

I haven't tested it yet, but for the compatibility you just have to install git that's all ? (It can be a very good thing on Windows, because when you want to use Capistrano and you don't need a ruby env, install it on a PC it's just a waste of timeâ€¦)
