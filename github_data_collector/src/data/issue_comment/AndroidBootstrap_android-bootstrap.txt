The login credential "demo@androidbootstrap.com"  and  password "android" doesn't work.
I imported the android-bootstrap project from github, I run the application on android studio it gives me login and passwords ?? where do i find it?
There has not been a commit on this project for about a year, was curious if it was still active?

I can't run your project

It keeps telling me 

_Error:Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugManifest'. Manifest merger failed with multiple errors, see logs_

Please help!

I did a small research on the current Android RAD tools and frameworks. I included your project and I felt it's only fair to inform you and all the other projects generous developers of it:

I hope that you see benefit from looking at what others are doing and such. If you have any feedback please do let me know.

I'm also trying to gauge the interest of the community in having/building something on a bigger scale. Not sure what that should be so I built ~~an app~~ a [survey](https://sahal3.typeform.com/to/iQ5wBt) for it. I hope experienced Android devs such as yourself would take a look at. Thank you.

I get the error "The goal you specified requires a project to execute but there is no POM in this directory (/my app directory). Please verify you invoked Maven from the correct directory" whenever I try to build using maven.


Hello, I hava a customize activity, and want to use `BootstrapApplication.component().inject(this);`

I found the the interface `BootstrapComponent` has no `inject()` fit my activity, I add a new method.

Then I want to do the same thing in impl class `DaggerBootstrapComponent`, found it under AndroidStudio generate dir which I could not edit.

Question: 
- How to use dagger inject in my activity 
- Where is the source code of DaggerBootstrapComponent

Just a suggestion for an update: Android released (in beta) databinding, which makes the code A LOT more elegant.
Check out a great tutorial on http://www.anwarshahriar.me/scratching-the-surface-of-androids-new-data-binding-library/

Hey!
It's been almost a year that we got the teaser of having RxJava and Material in android bootstrap. I do realise that this is nature of OS development, but would be good if we can have some expectations set. Do you think these updates might happen anytime soon or should we not hold our breaths?

Thanks!
