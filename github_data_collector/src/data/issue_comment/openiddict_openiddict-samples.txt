I'd like for a hybrid sample to be added.
It's not clear how a hybrid app should be added (for example one with response type "code id_token").
Edit: Hybrid flow can be enabled by allowing both Authorization Code and Implicit Flow.

It's not clear as of right now how this should work, even though the documentation mentions it can handle hybrid flows. I do not see a way to implement this in the documentation. The Allow...Flow also don't contain a hybrid one? Does this mean it has to be a custom one and implement it myself? Would be nice if there was a sample doing this then as well.

I'd appreciate it if the client could be a Net framework 4.6.1 with Owin, since i'm currently trying that, but i have some trouble getting just the code to work. I noticed https://stackoverflow.com/a/33662736/7957165) that just code is not supported, so want to do code id_token.

Thanks in advance.
To avoid `Bearer error="invalid_token", error_description="The audience is invalid"` exception.
I am using OpenIddict with the implicit flow for my .NET Core 2.1 combined API and Authorization server that uses JWT Bearer authentication and everything is working great.  

Now I need to add a second resource server which is a separate .NET 4.6.1 Framework web application using Web API 1.  (This is a reporting API which has to rely on the full .NET Framework).  Now I want to secure my Controller endpoint with the [Authorize] tag and get this to play nicely with my main Authorization Server endpoint using JWT Bearer access tokens.

I've seen different ways of setting up JWT Bearer authentication to secure the controller in Web API 1 projects- from writing a custom [JWTAuthentication] attribute filter, to using Owin middleware.  

Do you have an example or suggestion on the recommended way to configure a .NET Framework 4.x Resource server which uses the original WEB API (not version 2) with JWT Bearer authentication and allowing it to talk to the main OpenIddict .NET Core Authorization Server?  The existing samples that show Resource Servers are all in .NET Core.


Hello,
on https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-samples/blob/master/samples/RefreshFlow/AngularApp/src/core/auth.service.ts  is a bug in my opinion. 
Starting at line 108. There should be a map to return the Observable<AuthTokenModel>. 
Or other functions have to be changed.
I couldn't compile this.

I think the right implementation is:

```
private getTokens(data: RefreshGrantModel | LoginModel, grantType: string): Observable<AuthTokenModel> {
    const headers = new Headers({ 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' });
    const options = new RequestOptions({ headers: headers });

    Object.assign(data, { grant_type: grantType, scope: 'openid offline_access' });

    const params = new URLSearchParams();
    Object.keys(data)
      .forEach(key => params.append(key, data[key]));
    return this.http.post(`${environment.baseApiUrl}/connect/token`, params.toString(), options)
      .pipe(
        map(res => res.json()),
        tap(res => {
          const tokens: AuthTokenModel = res;
          const now = new Date();
          tokens.expiration_date = new Date(now.getTime() + tokens.expires_in * 1000).getTime().toString();

          const profile: ProfileModel = jwtDecode(tokens.id_token);

          this.storeToken(tokens);
          this.updateState({ authReady: true, tokens, profile });
      }));
  }
```
