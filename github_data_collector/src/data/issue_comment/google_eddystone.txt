I want visitors to download my app when they come to radar of my office(Detect beacon). Is this somehow possible?

Would be nice to have beacons advertising credentials for connecting to a public Wi-Fi network
HI, Greetings.

I am emulating a beacon with ESP32, and i want to change TX power level to reach differents distances. how can i change TX power level?

I've already tried with estimote beacons and with them I can change TX power level from -18dbm to 4dbm. But i haven't be able to do it with ESP32 chip.

I am doing this with Eddystone protocol, more specific Eddystone-UID.

`EddystoneUid::EddystoneUid(const std::string& nid, const std::string& bid) {
    frame.len16bitServiceUuidPart = 0x03;   // <- 1 (data type value) + 2 (16-bit Eddystone UUID)
    frame.type16bitServiceUuid = 0x03;      // 16-bit Service UUID
    frame.eddystoneUuid = EDDYSTONE_SERVICE_UUID;
    frame.lenServiceDataPart = 0x17;        // Eddystone-UID full length (23bytes)
    frame.typeServiceData = 0x16;           // Service Data
    frame._eddystoneUuid = EDDYSTONE_SERVICE_UUID;
    frame.frameType = EDDYSTONE_FRAME_TYPE_UID;
    frame.ranging = 0x00;                   // TODO: ranging data
    memset(frame.nid, 0, sizeof(frame.nid));
    memset(frame.bid, 0, sizeof(frame.bid));
    memset(frame.rfu, 0, sizeof(frame.rfu));
    setBeaconId(nid, bid);
}`

That example code shows eddystone-uid frame, but I don't know how to change the TX power level.

in the line. 

`  frame.ranging = 0x00;                   // TODO: ranging data`


This is to change de level of RSSI at 1 meter,  It isn't what i want.
Hi All:
    I can't find nearby in setting -> google.  
    I found my google play updated, is nearby removed in this version? if removed, how to use eddystone for android phones.

    phone: huawei mate 10 pro
    system version: android 8.0.0 
                               EMUI 8.0.0
    google play service version: 12.8.72(040408-202717283)
Can anyone help me out about, Beacon configured as Eddystone EID is not even detected by Beacon Tool App.i am 
Using Beacon Tool App on Android device.


It may be an easy doubt.
Doubt is in the file of EID-computation in Eddystone-EID

1) in point "4 - Secure key exchange EID configuration", What does key pair means? Public and Private key of beacon? Where do they come/generated from?  These keys are also used in "Computing the identity key".

2)In "Registering an EID beacon with the resolver", It is said, 'The resolver then follows the same procedure to compute the identity key from its own private key and the beacon's public key.' The public, private key of beacon and resolver is changed compare to client's computing.

Can you please clarify all this thing?
What is the difference between Using ETLM Frame and Using EID Frame with TLM frame to encrypt the TLM frame's data and which one is better ? Is the latter one possible i.e. using EID frame to secure TLM frame's data?
I have been trying to use Google Beacon Platform's Nearby Notification using  multiple web url's and multiple app intents. At first I used to receive the last modified or added notification but after few tries I am getting randomized notifications i.e. either web url's notification or app intent notification whenever I turn on the Bluetooth in my device. Is there a valid reason like, if is there fixed duration for a particular notification for this or is it the beacon's fault ?

Targeting rule is set to default for all entries.

Could anyone help me with this?

Thank You in advance :)
