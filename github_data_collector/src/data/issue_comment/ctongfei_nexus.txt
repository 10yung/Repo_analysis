- jvm-ref-backend -> jvm-ref/backend
- Issue: #40
It somehow breaks again after the fix in #21.
I think the link should be: https://github.com/ctongfei/nexus/blob/master/jvm-ref/backend/src/test/scala/nexus/XorTest.scala

The diff: jvm-ref-backend -> jvm-ref/backend

Hopefully in Scala 3, with https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/4672, we could do
```scala
type Func1[X, Y] = [F[_]: Algebra] -> F[X] => F[Y]
```

For certain 2nd-order optimization algorithms, e.g. (Martens & Grosse, 2015 JMLR):
```scala
  def backward[G[_]: Algebra, X, Y](dy: G[Y], y: Y, x: X): G[X]
```
where `G[_]` encapsulates backward computations. Trivially `G = Id`.
Given `D[_]: DifferentiableAlgebra`,
```scala
  def jacobian[X, Y, `∂Y/∂X`](y: D[Y], x: D[X])(implicit J: Jacobian.Aux[X, Y, `∂Y/∂X`]): `∂Y/∂X`
```

How should we define `Jacobian.Aux` for all differentiable types?

Amazing idea from @kitsing:

A `LongTensor` tensor used as an indexer should not be typed as `LongTensor[U]`, instead it should be `IndexTensor[U, X <: Dim]`, where X is the single dimension which it is indexed against. This creates extra typesafety:
```scala
oneHot: TI[U, I] => TR[Append[U, I]]
argmax: (T[U], I) => TI[Remove[U, I], I]
```
Would be nice if it is possible to index tensors with other index-typed tensors.
After trying to build it, here is what I get: 
```
> ./build.sh 
PyTorch 1.0.0 at /Users/daniel/miniconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch detected
Operating system is darwin17
Copying include files...
cp: /Users/daniel/miniconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/lib/include/THC: No such file or directory
```

Taking a closer look into the `include` folder, here is what I see: 
```
> ls -lha /Users/daniel/miniconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/lib/include/

So there are `TH` and `THNN` folders, but no `THC`. Can this something specific to my operating system?
