Add an alt attribute if alt data is provided. This is part of fixing #735.

When trying to update recline and timemapper to the most recent TimelineJS, i was getting a 404 (Not Found) error relating to a final getJSON call to "nothing?callback=onJSONP_Data" 
Investigation showed that the data was already received, but not being added to the config.source, which resulted in a call to "nothing" the default source on the config object.

additionally I changed to the ajax call rather than getJSON based on the advice of the article that I cited in the comment:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1002367/jquery-ajax-jsonp-ignores-a-timeout-and-doesnt-fire-the-error-event

This seemed to work inside timemapper, but broke the timelineJS test:
http://recline.1zm.in/vendor/TimelineJS2/tests/test_extra_html.html

So i rolled it back to still use getJSON... I left the comment in there to start a discussion... what are the advantages of getJSON? do you agree in general with the advice from Husky on that stackoverflow link?

Translated "Swipe to navigate".

With this change, i can provide the timeline with the javascript stategy i want to render the dates, by indicating the url of the js file that has that logic in the "calendar" attribute of the timeline config.

I think this is a useful feature, i remember somebody needing a hebrew calendar and there is also the question in the faq about using relative times (1 month, 2 months, etc) rather than absolute dates. This is useful for both cases.

In a couple of days i might be able to implement a couple of examples.

Use the favicon.ico for [knightlab.com](knightlab.com), which has a higher resolution and is more likely to be up to date.
