Hi, are you interesting to create MATLAB toolbox from jsonlab? Because it's not very convenient to have jsonlab manually added to the MATLAB path. And it's not convenient at all to add jsonlab copy to every project where you use it.
I think that toolbox format is the best way to distribute, use and update jsonlab. Do you agree? And do you need help to create the toolbox?
