Use multi-stage build.
From 278MB to 99.2MB image size.
Add docker-entrypoint script for dynamic setup.
Add docker-compose file.
I have compiled successfully the project but when I am trying to start it, it exits immediately. I checked the webdis.log and I see the following:

webdis.log:28:[4898] 21 Oct 17:21:52 46 Invalid argument
webdis.log:29:[4898] 21 Oct 17:21:52 46 Connection failed: setsockopt(TCP_NODELAY): Invalid argument
Seems like the nested array cannot be handled?

My application uses /PSUBSCRIBE and waits for notifications about keys. Redis generates hundreds of events about keys. Data that gets out of webdis to my application is "mixed" - first some http chunks are sent, then all of headers, then http chunks continues.

Fucntion `http_schedule_write` schedules write event for every http_response but libevent does not preserve order of calls to `http_can_write`. In effect first are called callbacks that sends chunks, then headers, and then there are only chunks left. Similar situation might happen when a chunk would be too long to fit with one call to write in `http_can_write`.


Hi Nicolas !

When I try to set a value using a POST method with string content body and a ~700KB base64 encoded message, server respond with following error 
```
{
    "SET": [
        false,
        "ERR syntax error"
    ]
}
```
I guess this is because my content has some slahes in it...anyway I can set the value using the PUT method, but if I want to set an expiry time (/PUT/Key/EX/100) I get a syntax error as well. If I remove the /EX/100 value is set correctly.

Is it possibly to set the expiry time using PUT ?

Thanks
This adds support for the preprocessor flags that are usually passed as CPPFLAGS rather than a part of the CFLAGS.

This provides a way to start webdis with dynamic port allocation and
discover HTTP port number by simply grepping logs i.e. without need to
use netstat or sockstat that are not available on some architectures.

Dynamic port allocation is a feature that can be used to run webdis
ad-hoc for testing purpose.
