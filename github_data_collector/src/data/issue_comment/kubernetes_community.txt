Doing a little cleanup work on SIG-Docs' Google Doc.

Converting historical docs to markdown and stashing for the future. This also establishes a process that can be followed in the future to remove bloat from the current-year Google Doc for meeting minutes.

Inspektor Gadget (https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget) contains
a collection of gadgets for developers of Kubernetes applications. Its
main gadget, traceloop, uses BPF to record system calls performed by
each pod like a flight recorder. It can be used to see the last system
calls performed by a pod after it crashed.

It is available under the Apache license.

It is built on top of BCC (https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) and traceloop
(https://github.com/kinvolk/traceloop).

I am trying to setup a Network Policy for my Pods. I need to only allow Port 3301(on SCTP) & 443(TCP) as ingress. But Once NP is created , rule is not working.

NP.yaml==>
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: custom-networkpolicy
namespace: alpha
spec:
podSelector:
matchLabels:
role: web
policyTypes:

    Ingress
    ingress:
        from:
            namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
            app.kubernetes.io/traffic-policy: ingress-allow
            podSelector:
            matchLabels:
            app.kubernetes.io/web-ingress: allowed
            ports:
            protocol: SCTP
            port: 3301

Kubernetes configuration to enable SCTP support ==>

../manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml: - --feature-gates=AllAlpha=false,SCTPSupport=true
../manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml: - --feature-gates=AllAlpha=false,SCTPSupport=true
../manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml: - --feature-gates=AllAlpha=false,SCTPSupport=true

What you expected to happen:
As per NP, only port 443 & 3301 should be reachable from other pods with or other namspace set with required labels.

How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible):
Issue still exists.

Anything else we need to know?:
Once I removed the SCTP protocol from Ingress , rules immediately start working for other node.
I have tried to create separate rule for SCTP only but not luck.
