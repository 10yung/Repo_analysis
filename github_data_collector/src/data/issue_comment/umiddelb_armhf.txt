Hello!

Regarding the 

umiddelb/armhf/wiki/How-To-compile-a-custom-Linux-kernel-for-your-ARM-device

I wonder how does it work without ever specifying ARCH=arm in any make invocation, or ever mentioning it at all?

I doubt the tutorial expects the kernel is being built on some ARM host, so the host is likely x86, and we are building cross.

In this case, in particular, the recipe:

cd linux
make <default_config>
less .config

will try to find <devault_config> in  arch/x86 rather than in arch/arm, and should fail.

If ARCH=arm should be set in the environment, it should better be explicitly stated in the tutorial, I think.

What do I miss?
