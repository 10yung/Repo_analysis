Is there a syntax for calling methods implemented directly on the 'context'? A bare `function()` doesn't appear to do the trick
Currently working with `Option`s can be rather frustrating and clumsy because of the lack of support for closures inside templates. Adding support for closures would significantly improve the library's usability.
I don't see a convenient way to do the following:

{% if foo is defined %}
    {{ foo }}
{% endif %}
This doesn't work with askama. It works in tera.
Issue [#46](https://github.com/djc/askama/issues/46) is closed with "This has long been done." but it's either not the case or it's only the case for the match syntax from the same issue.

In tera/jijna2 lingo _defined_ is a _test_:
[tera tests](https://tera.netlify.com/docs/templates/#built-in-tests)
[jinja 2 tests](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#builtin-tests).
I couldn't find any tests in askama, don't know where to put this.

Code wise my _defined_ is rather simple:
```rust
pub fn defined<T>(o: &Option<T>) -> Result<bool>
{
    if o.is_some() {
        return Ok(true);
    }
    Ok(false)
}
```
The reason for using an Option is that in the template input struct everything a template refers to must always be defined anyway, so to satisfy a template with optional data, using the rust Option type makes the most sense.

Results are different in that the Err can also hold a value, so that's not something to use with defined anyway.
@fabianfreyer I think you missed the actual code generation stuff in askama_derive. I made a little progress, I think, but am running into different errors now having to do with how the askama_actix code is found for the generated impls. Can you take a look and see if you can figure this out?

I don't totally understand this yet, but it seems like this might be harder than I thought...
See discussion in #234. This is a first attempt at splitting out some of the integrations - I'm not sure this is the right way though.

- [x] Split out actix-web
- [ ] Split out gotham
- [ ] Split out rocket
- [ ] Split out iron
This allows static functions to be called from templates using an expression like `self::static_fn(arg)`. This fixes #196.

I haven't tested this outside of the 3 test cases I wrote, so maybe a little more testing should be done before merging this.
Updates the requirements on [gotham](https://github.com/gotham-rs/gotham) to permit the latest version.
