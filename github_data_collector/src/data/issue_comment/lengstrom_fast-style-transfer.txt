Excuse me,has VGG net been fine-tuned in your code? Tanks.
Updated some functions in src/utils.py that had been deprecated in scipy.

Also made unzip silent in setup. sh (this make unzip faster because it does not spend so much time printing all images uncompressed)
Not really an issue with the code but tell me please - is there a way to download these files somewhere else?
The hosting msvocds.blob.core.windows.net is really slow and file download can not be resumed!
Torrent file would be the best option in my opinion.
Thanks!
Did anyone ever figure out the parameters used for the pretrained models? Was the only weight changed the content weight to 1.5e1? The batch size might be problematic for me, but it's a starting point.
The code ran successfully on a file sized 234 MB, but the output was only sized 5.71 MB. Why?

Edit: The data rate of the original is 40509 kbps and the bitrate is 40669 kbps, but in the stylized file, the data rate is only 1742 kbps and bitrate is 1903 kbps. Frame rate and frame dimensions remained the same between them. The quality is quite poor on the stylized video.
I have been using https://github.com/hwalsuklee/tensorflow-fast-style-transfer to do some hobby style transfering. There, I train the models and come up with a .ckpt file that gets used; I am unable to use that file for this off the shelf. Is anyone aware of an easy fix so that I do not have to retrain models for hours on end?
While evaluating with the models provided in the google drive by @lengstrom it seems to lack the file "***.ckpt.meta" and "***.ckpt.index". The ckpt file provided looks like the "***.ckpt.data-00000-of-00001", but how can I find the meta file and the index file?
Hi, the code is successfully run on my GPU Nvidia 1060 Ti. However, it seems that the percentage of usage of GPU is low, which can be shown as the figure of GPU-Z. Is something going wrong with my training process?

Description:
This issue occurs when latest version of SciPy (1.2.0) is used while running this project.

Possible Cause:
Apparently, imread is deprecated and is moved to imageio.

Current Workaround:
Install SciPy version 1.1.0

Fix:
Can modify the code to use imageio.imread () instead of scipy.mis.imread()
Not an issue but is there any place where I can find more pre-trained models for style transfer? Also is there a platform where I can publish custom trained models?

Thanks
