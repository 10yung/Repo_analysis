Mostly minor changes/improvements.
**Please provide the following information**

### qBittorrent version and Operating System
v4.3.0alpha (maybe affects 4.2.1 too?) Windows 10 x64 qB "native" interface (not web).

### What is the problem
Cannot filter on *all* columns.

### What is the expected behavior
To be able to view a filtered list of any column, instead of blank = no results.

### Steps to reproduce
1) Enable columns `Tracker`, `Time Active`, and `Save Path`.
2) Enter part of what is seen into the `Filter torrent list...` input e.g. number of days an item has seeded.
3) Result is nothing instead of an expected list of filtered items.

### Extra info(if any)  
With recent changes to the transfer list, Maybe the filter system broke like the column ordering did? Maybe filtering works correctly under 4.2.1? Maybe the filter was never designed to apply to any column? The input box reads "Filter torrent list...", so the expectation to filter anything comes from that wording.

When renaming any torrent or its content (F2 key), I can only navigate the cursor with the Left/Right arrow. I am missing the ability to use the Up/Down arrow, where the cursor will be placed at the left or right end respectively. This is also the default behavior when editing file names on Windows.

It's very handy, especially when editing files, as pressing F2 will highlight the filename excluding the extension. Being able to press the Down arrow in this case, would place the cursor here `Filename|.ext`, and let me quickly edit from the ending of the filename. Right now, I can press the Right arrow key, which places the cursor to the right at the period: `Filename.|ext`
<4.1.5 ~ 4.2.1

I'm requesting some tweaks to two different but related features.

1) The Graph Period resolution appears to be arbitrary relative to the period options given (1m 5m 30m 6h 12h 24h) but don't actually reflect these periods in any obvious way.  The graph does have vertical divisions, so I would like to request that each division be made to reflect 1 period in length.  On a full 1920p wide screen, about 6 divisions are visible, so 6 periods (or 6 days) would be represented (at the 24h resolution).

2) Up/Down speed sampling is fixed at some arbitrary period which cannot be adjusted.  Note: Under `Advanced` -> `Transfer List Refresh Interval`, this value can be increased and will slow down how frequently the Up/Down speed values are visually updated (everywhere, including in the graph), but it does not adjust the sample period or decay of the value.  I propose that adjusting this `Refresh Interval` will define the sample period and average out the value over that period.  Alternately, a separate user option can define this value instead of using the refresh interval value.
(Experiment: Set the refresh interval to 10000 ms and you will see no smoothing effect. The value shown every 10 seconds is only representative of a one second sample period from the last ten seconds.)

Thoughts, questions?
I want to point out a security vulnerability, but I would probably prefer to not directly explain it in an issue. How do I contact you privately?

### What is the expected behavior
(type here)

### qBittorrent version and Operating System
4.2.1 Windows 8.1

### What is the problem
Can't download a file (or files) I newly enabled, because I get a "parameter incorrect" (back translated) error.



Apparently QBT wants to write this in a .unwanted sub-folder that isn't even created, for some reason. (Too bad this nuisance .unwanted feature still exists)
Something like this:
`2020.01.16. 1:09 - Fájlhiba figyelmeztetés. Torrent: &quot;<torrent-name>&quot;. Fájl: &quot;E:\Sorozatok\<torrent-name>\<subfolder>\.unwanted\filename.mkv&quot;. Indok: <torrent-name> partfile_write (E:\Sorozatok\<torrent-name>\<subfolder>\.unwanted\filename.mkv) error: A paraméter nem megfelelő`

### Extra info(if any)
This torrent was previously on another drive, but I moved it as I kept enabling more files I needed more space.



### What is the expected behavior
Download files normally
I saved the fastresume:

Have you been hacked?

Thanks
