when I use this function, I find a issue, you may run the code, and find it!
I think it is because the matlab cannot mark off the _**handle**_ and the _**number**_!
code:
x = [1,2,3,4];
y = [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4];
fig1 = Plot(x,y);
fig2 = Plot(x,y);
fig3 = Plot(x,y);
fig4 = Plot(x,y);
fig5 = Plot(x,y);% error
I am using this to create my plots but I encountered a problem that I cannot place three legends in a single row. it is always in front of the graph which is difficult to read for reviewers.

please solve my issue I will be grateful.

Creating of publication quality graphs - thats  what i need.
But i have so much subfigures plots.
Can i use PlotPub for this?
I am seeing an issue when a legend is created with markers. Whenever a line includes a marker, the text in the legend corresponding to that line turns gray. I am using R2018a. The problem can be reproduced with:

````
% generate the signal
f = 50;  % frequency
Vm = 10; % peak
phi = 45; % phase
t = [0:0.0001:3/f];
th = 2*pi*f*t;
v1 = Vm*sin(th);
v2 = Vm*sin(th - phi);
v3 = Vm*sin(th - phi*2);

% plot them
plt = Plot(t*1E3, v1, t*1E3, v2, t*1E3, v3);

plt.LineStyle = {'-', '-', '-'}; % three line styles
plt.Markers = {'o', '', 's'};
plt.LegendBox = 'on';
plt.Legend = {'\theta = 0^o', '\theta = 45^o', '\theta = 90^o'}; % legends
````

[export_fig](https://github.com/altmany/export_fig/) is a function to export figures with publication quality. It exports pdf without bounding box solving for example #10 (and likely #11)
_This is a duplicate of previously submitted issue #25, now closed_ 

* Add options to change text Interpreter and dimension Units
* Correctly detect legends (previous code did not work in Matlab2017a: I have not tested this change in previous versions)
* Don't throw a warning for ErrorBar plots
It will be highly convenient if it supports bar graph. Please add this feature if feasible. #
Hi, does PlotPub allow one to apply separate axes labels/axes properties to different axes on the same figure? If not, could you consider adding this feature? 

Can u make PlotHub support other plot type such as bar graph
