I want to disable **NSParameterAssert** in the application

I am using  **AFOAuth2Manager** using pod.

I want to disable the following lines in my project

  **NSParameterAssert(url);
  NSParameterAssert(clientID);
  NSParameterAssert(secret);**

Please check the following code contain in **AFOAuth2Manager.m** file

```
- (id)initWithBaseURL:(NSURL *)url
 sessionConfiguration:(NSURLSessionConfiguration *)configuration
             clientID:(NSString *)clientID
               secret:(NSString *)secret {
    NSParameterAssert(url);
    NSParameterAssert(clientID);
    NSParameterAssert(secret);

    self = [super initWithBaseURL:url sessionConfiguration:configuration];
    if (!self) {
        return nil;
    }

    self.serviceProviderIdentifier = [self.baseURL host];
    self.clientID = clientID;
    self.secret = secret;
    self.useHTTPBasicAuthentication = YES;

    [self.requestSerializer setValue:@"application/json" forHTTPHeaderField:@"Accept"];

    return self;
}

```

Could you please help me how to resolve this issue?


Request to support package integration through Swift Package Manager


Hi folks! I just came across this library when I was looking to add OAuth integration into one of my Objective-C projects.

It looks like the definitive OAuth 2 manager for Objective-C, however, with some [glaring bugs](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFOAuth2Manager/pull/136) that have pending pull requests, it looks like no one from the original team has been able to maintain it for a little while.

Is anyone from the original team still around? I'd love to help get those pending PRs merged if possible. :)

This is kind of a heads up, not sure a change can be made to AFOAuthCredential but I have noticed that with iOS 10.3 Beta that when I delete and re install and app the Keychain records are no longer there.  In My App users just have to login again, which is not as nice but it is what it is.
On 401 : authorization failed with expiration token, we need to ask for a new token (refresh_token)
It would be nice to have a complete integration of the oAuth flow in this framework.

If I'm correct a solution would be to overload AFHTTPSessionManager: dataTaskWithRequest

I'have made a first try but it is not working yet.



When using this pod in a swift project, I'm hitting an issue related to #107. This should fix it.

I don't know how to Integrate
