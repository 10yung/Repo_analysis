Hi, I'm developer of Mongo Go Models(mgm), It's a model-based wrapper of Mongo Go Driver that I'm trying to make it the Best ODM wrapper of Mongo Go Driver package.
Give it a try and let be in your README if you are ok with it :)
I wrote two functions and a struct to improve the readability of the code, and to make the writing of it faster.
You can find it in session_wrapper.go 


Storm is a great toolkit for boltdb, and I don't use bolt without it. I think it is an important option to mention as a viable alternative to mongo.
Fixes https://github.com/go-mgo/mgo/issues/533
Currently, mgo sends a {getnonce:1} request to mongod/mongos immediately upon connection regardless of the auth mechanism ultimately being used.
https://github.com/go-mgo/mgo/blob/3871eddd896b8b70fe630053af5e81f2c1e8ed53/socket.go#L193

Through MongoDB 3.6, this is mostly harmless as the allocated nonce eventually expires when the connection goes away, however with MongoDB >= 3.8 the MONGODB-CR authentication mechanism has been removed, and ideally the {getnonce:1} command would go with it.

In the interest of BC with existing tools using mgo, the getnonce command will be retained for the foreseeable future as a dummy command so that mgo based tools won't break, however we'd like to remove it eventually, and hope that by updating mgo we can do so.
Changed "introuced" to "introduced"
If socket was killed, it should be removed in session so that new socket can be setup for session.

As title indicates, this is useful to allow a scatter-gather query to return partial results when a non-zero number of replica sets are down.
Although no answers were given to this issue #489, I went ahead made the change I had in mind.
Also give an example of an error returned as a QueryError in
production, so you can see what e.g. the Message field may look like.
