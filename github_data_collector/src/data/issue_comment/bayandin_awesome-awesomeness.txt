Hola!
Somos un grupo de estudiantes de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) y estamos
haciendo una campaña de concienciación sobre el uso de licencias.

Razones por las que usar una licencia:

- Es FÁCIL de usar: escoge la licencia, copia el texto genérico y listo! Ya puedes usarla en tus proyectos. En el siguiente [link](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) puedes encontrar más información:
- LIMITAS qué usos pueden tener las personas para usar tu contenido, de esta manera evitas problemas de copias y plagios 
- Compartir es poder! Las licencias libres te dan credito en todo momento permitiendo que otros usen tu trabajo bajo TUS condiciones.
En el siguiente [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnmWFxlG2GA) se explican los tipos de licencias para que puedas escoger una que se adapte a tus necesidades

Hemos elegido la licencia MIT para este pull request. En este [link](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) puedes encontrar mas informacion sobre esta licencia

Gracias por tu atención! Esperamos que te haya servido de ayuda

Hello!
We are a group of students of Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) and we are working on an awareness campaign about types and uses of licences.

There are many reasons to use licences in your code:

- It's EASY to use: choose the licence, copy the generic text and ready! Now you can use it in your projects You can found more information in the following [link](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository ) 

- You LIMIT the uses of your code, in this way you will avoid possible legal problems about copies and plagiarism
- Share is power! The freeware licences give to you credit all the time. Allow third people use it with YOUR conditions

A database implementation isn't in the same category as programming languages.

We wouldn't list each YAML implementation as a language so why do we list implementations of SQL as languages.

I still do want all the databases and their awesome resources listed here, just in a separate list.
The great thing about awesome-x is that there is one place to go to find all things awesome. It is confusing that awesome-awesome has two. It would be good if this could be merged with sindresorhus/awesome to have a single place to go.

It does appear as though this repo was created 3 days before sindresorhus/awesome but it has about 5 times as many watches/stars/forks. Maybe you guys can fight it amongst yourselves to see who wins but to me the community has already chosen.
One super awesome list is more awesome than two separate moderately awesome lists.
It would be great to merge this one into the more prominent list https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome

Not volunteering, just saying.
Where should these go in the list? General? Both are primarily written in Python but are for many languages.
