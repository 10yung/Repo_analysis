Hi, I am having some trouble with what should be a simple thing (so I suspect user error). When I use plot_bar to create bar plots, it does not return the abundance values that I know are in the samples. Below is a graph showing a simplified example of this, where I plotted the sequence abundances by each individual sample. The samples all have 5000 sequences in them so the total should be 5000 but that is not what shows up in the graph. This data is a smaller subset of a larger data set but the issues appear no matter what version of the data I use. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have attached a zip folder with all the input files and script I used in this example.

Major fixes were misplaced backticks, which interfere with rendering.
Minor changes are removal of trailing space.
Hi,
 
Happy new year!
 
Since the relative abundance is recommended to do beta diversity analysis, I used the following codes to transform our phyloseq object to relative abundance. But when I check taxtab5 (below), I can still only see total abundance. Do you have any ideas on it? Also, the bray-curtis distances of using relative abundance and total abundance are exactly the same. Not sure whether it’s right. 
 
Toad5 is an object that has been removed the otus (counts <=4)
 
standf = function(x) {x/sum(x)}
Toad5.r= transform_sample_counts(Toad5, standf)
 
taxtab5<-table(tax_table(Toad5.r)[,"Phylum"], exclude = NULL)
taxtab5
 
Thanks,

I wonder if the "myBiomFile.biom" file exists on official pages.

I got the following error messages:
```
> my.physeq <- import("Biom", BIOMfilename="myBiomFile.biom")
Error in read_biom(biom_file = BIOMfilename) : 
  Both attempts to read input file:
myBiomFile.biom
either as JSON (BIOM-v1) or HDF5 (BIOM-v2).
Check file path, file name, file itself, then try again.
```

I am trying to import sampledata.csv that I have prepared as csv with location as variable. I am using the command
Sampledata = sample_data(Sampledata, row.names=sample_names(physeq))

I receive the following error "Error in if (errorIfNULL & is.null(out)) { : argument is of length zero"

How can I solve it?
Hi,
I am quite new to microbiome analysis and, frankly, quite at a loss as to how to proceed. So, I apologize is my question is naive or has already been answered elsewhere. I have just read a paper (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.02224/full) where they state that microbiome datasets are compositional and, therefore, methods usually employed for microbiome analysis are not appropriate. I am particularly concerned on data normalization, as the authors state that normalization methods such as those implemented in DESeq should not be used. My question, bluntly put, is, are they right? Are there methods implemented in phyloseq to handle compositional data?
Thanks in advance for your help
Hi,

I don't have a paired design like the examples provided above. I have multiple treatments/factors that I would like to use with the DESeq2 package.

head(sample_data(dat_exposure_gut)$Treatment)
Levels: 10% 20% 40% Acclimation control Field TCS

I tried the below code with my column "Treatment" (which has 7 levels), but it didn't really like it and gave this error:

exposure_deseq <- phyloseq_to_deseq2(dat_exposure_gut, ~Treatment)

it appears that the last variable in the design formula, 'Treatment',
has a factor level, 'control', which is not the reference level. we recommend
to use factor(...,levels=...) or relevel() to set this as the reference level
before proceeding. for more information, please see the 'Note on factor levels'
in vignette('DESeq2').

I went on to see if I could just ignore that message...

exposure_deseq <- DESeq(exposure_deseq, test="Wald", fitType="parametric")
Error in estimateSizeFactorsForMatrix(counts(object), locfunc = locfunc, :
every gene contains at least one zero, cannot compute log geometric means

I have also tried to just subset my phyloseq object to compare only two treatments at a time (I'm not sure if this is okay to do) and I get the same error! 

Is there anyway to do this, or maybe I've made a mistake? Victoria
Hi all, 

I am hoping to create a compositional barplot for each individual sample in a study. I have my data in a phyloseq, and I was able to create the compositional barplot for the top25 taxa across all samples using the code below: 

view_final_vst is my normalized phyloseq object. 
```
## get top 25 most abundant Families, merge remaining Families into "Other," and glom by Family
# Make a compositional bar plot
sort.tax <- sort(tapply(taxa_sums(view_final_vst), tax_table(view_final_vst)[, "Genus"], sum), TRUE)
length(sort.tax)
top.tax <- sort.tax[1:25] #what are the top 25 most abundant Families across the whole study?
write.csv(top.tax, "top25Taxa.csv")

bottom.tax <- sort.tax[26:length(sort.tax)] 
top.sub <- subset_taxa(view_final_vst, Genus %in% names(top.tax)) #get top 25 most abundant Genus
bottom.sub <- subset_taxa(view_final_vst, Genus %in% names(bottom.tax)) #get all other taxa
bottom.sub.m <- merge_taxa(view_final_vst, taxa_names(bottom.sub), archetype=1) #merge all other taxa into Genus "Other"
tax_table(bottom.sub.m)[,6][is.na(tax_table(bottom.sub.m)[,6])] <- "Other"
bottom.sub.m <- tax_glom(bottom.sub.m, taxrank="Genus")
match()
# Replace row name with genus 
## stacked barplots to compare proportional composition 
bottom.sub.rel <- transform_sample_counts(bottom.sub.m, function(x) 100 * x/sum(x))
df_long <- psmelt(bottom.sub.rel) # first change to long format
old.lvl <- levels(df_long$Genus)
df_long$Genus <- factor(df_long$Genus, levels=c("Other", sort(old.lvl[old.lvl!="Other"], decreasing=F)))

## Plot
ggplot(df_long, aes(x=Sample_name, y=Abundance, fill = Genus)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="stack") + 
  labs(x="Sample", y="Percentage of Sequences") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=genusPal, na.value="darkgrey") +
  scale_color_manual(values=genusPal, na.value="darkgrey") + 
  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=10), axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, size=6, hjust=1, vjust=0.5),
        legend.text=element_text(size=8), legend.key.size = unit(0.16,"in"), legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.title=element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Top 25 Taxa")
```

However, this just finds the top 25 taxa in the phyloseq object that I created. I was hoping to be able to make a loop that will run through each sample name in the phyloseq object and create an individual phyloseq object for each sample, then plot that phyloseq using the code above. However, I have been having difficulty figuring out how this loop would work, especially with phyloseq.  

I did some searching through the previous issues and found a way to view the top 25 in each sample ( #847 ), but this does not allow me (at least as to my knowledge) to convert into a phyloseq object with abundance data. 

I would really appreciate any help in trying pt put this loop together. I would also imagine that this could be helpful for individuals in the future that want to find the top however many taxa in individual samples. 

Thanks in advance for any help!  
Hi there,

I ran into an intriguing error with different datasets. For demonstration purposes, I'm trying to transform some abundance data with different functions. When I try to use the as.integer function within the transform_sample_counts function of the phyloseq package I get the following error message:

> euk2 <- transform_sample_counts(eukaryotic, as.integer)
Error in validObject(.Object) : invalid class “phyloseq” object: 
 Component taxa/OTU names do not match.
 Taxa indices are critical to analysis.
 Try taxa_names()

If I transform the same data using the log function I get no error at all and the transformation runs smoothly:
> euk2 <- transform_sample_counts(eukaryotic, log)
> 

I'm sure that the otu names match between the otu and taxa tables so I'm not sure what the problem could be. Can someone help?

Thanks!
Miguel


Hey,
running the code below
`soy <- phyloseq(ASV, sample_data(clean) ,TAX, phy_tree(fitGTR$tree))`

I got this output
`#otu_table()   OTU Table:         [ 974 taxa and 38 samples ]`
`#sample_data() Sample Data:       [ 38 samples by 16 sample variables ]`
`#tax_table()   Taxonomy Table:    [ 974 taxa by 6 taxonomic ranks ]`
`#phy_tree()    Phylogenetic Tree: [ 974 tips and 972 internal nodes ]`
But, my metadata has 85 samples and not 38. 
When running `sample_data(clean)` still has 85 samples.

Does anyone know why this could be happening?
