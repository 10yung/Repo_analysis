Migration to AVKit
Set the iOS target to iOS10 - therefore not backwards compatible but might be helpful for new comers. 

Cheers

Hi it's me again.

Thanks again for your great work!

First it will be great to add actions play next video and play previous video because we have already an array (playerVC.activityItems = [videoURL]). Like that with this design we will be able to go previous and next video :

![player_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23724339/49167144-14a56500-f335-11e8-9cca-11785b5a6e17.png)

If you want you can use theses assets below:

[next_video_button.pdf](https://github.com/mobileplayer/mobileplayer-ios/files/2625772/next_video_button.pdf)
[pause_button.pdf](https://github.com/mobileplayer/mobileplayer-ios/files/2625773/pause_button.pdf)
[play_button.pdf](https://github.com/mobileplayer/mobileplayer-ios/files/2625774/play_button.pdf)
[previous_video_button.pdf](https://github.com/mobileplayer/mobileplayer-ios/files/2625775/previous_video_button.pdf)

Hi,

First thank you for your job!

Please can you in the next release add key "centered" for an element which is a bool value with false by default and if you set it to true in .json config file then your element is centered horizontally ?

In fact I was unable to center my play button in my bottom bar without this parameter :(

I made changes quickly in my local project and it's work perfectly. You can see the final result on simulator iPhone XS Max on iOS 12.1 :

![bottom_button_centered_horizontally](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23724339/49166479-b9bf3e00-f333-11e8-915a-6ea0e7f7a06b.png)

In my VideoPlayer.json config file I can add this key "centered". An example:

  "bottomBar": {
    "backgroundColor": ["#ffffff"],
    "height": 65,
    "elements": [
      {
        "type": "toggleButton",
        "identifier": "play",
        "height": 65,
        "image": "video_player_play_button",
        "toggledImage": "video_player_pause_button",
        "centered": true
      }
    ]
  }

Don't hesitate if I can help.

Thanks.
The Youtube videos will play perfectly, but as soon as an ID "_-." contains the videos are not played. Does one have an idea for that?
