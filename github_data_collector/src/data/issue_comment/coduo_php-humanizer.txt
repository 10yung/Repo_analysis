Introduce support of English notation.

Currenlty 1*10^9 is represented as 1G, should be 1B (billion) and etc.
While testing i have a division by zero warning.
I'm running humanizer 2.0.0 on windows machine with php 7.1.1

**Executed code**

```php
print NumberHumanizer::binarySuffix(1025);
```

**Error**

Warning: Division by zero in vendor\coduo\php-humanizer\src\Coduo\PHPHumanizer\String\BinarySuffix.php on line 61
when passing equal time data to the "preciseDifference" method, error occurs
I would also being able to use the standard IEC binary prefixes such as "Mi" and "Gi" instead of "M" and "G" in BinarySuffix functions and to use a localized suffix as in french we commonly use "o" instead of "B" (we use "octet(s)" instead of "byte(s)").
I can understand that replacing "GB" by "GiB" by default is counterintuitive as it's not the most commonly used spelling so it could be achieved adding another parameter or usng a "tweaked" locale.
The result could be something like this:

``` php
echo Number::binarySuffix(1073741824 * 2); // "2 GiB"
echo Number::binarySuffix(1073741824 * 2, 'en-iec'); // "2 GiB"
echo Number::binarySuffix(1073741824 * 2, 'fr'); // "2 Go"
echo Number::binarySuffix(1073741824 * 2, 'fr-iec'); // "2 Gio"
```
