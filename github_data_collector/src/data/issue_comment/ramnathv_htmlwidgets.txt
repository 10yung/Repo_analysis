The `timevis` package uses the function `timevis_html` to add a custom zoom menu:
https://github.com/daattali/timevis/blob/be9756629bf12f5225d578d10c093d8f968f8551/R/timevis.R#L505

This works fine in combination with htmlwidgets::saveWidget selfContained=FALSE.
When using the selfContained=TRUE option however, the custom HTML is wrapped in `<pre>` tags, and is therefore not present in the output.

As a workaround, the generated HTML code can be adapted afterwards, but this is less than ideal.

Minimal reprex: https://gist.github.com/rfaelens/9dc31900c8e6601f2b978be4f5c4ec43
Referencing original issue: https://github.com/daattali/timevis/issues/87
a) Set max-height style instead of height
b) Removed timer that listens to resize event. It causes the error
element to change width/height momentarily and it's very disturbing to
the eye. The max-width & max-height properties are enough to handle the
resizing.
Is it possible to support multiple versions of JS dependencies with `htmlwidgets`?  

Due to a recent licensing change with `handsontable`, we're exploring whether `rhandsontable` could be updated to support different versions of the `handsontable` JS library ([more info here](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/6110)).
Dear htmlwidges developer,

Recently I encounter an issue when I putting htmlwidgets on my R shiny server code (such as using networkD3 or others like collapsibleTree), my other interactive plots implemented with plotly stop loading and disappeared on the interface.

I am wondering whether anyone else encounter this issue. I really want to incorporate the nice htmlwidgets to shiny apps.

Thanks in advance.
It it possible to mark a js library to be `async` loaded?

Like:
```
<script async src="script.js"></script>
```
Should solve #323.

Doesn't add background setting to `createWidget`, but `print.htmlwidget` instead 
I thought timevis could be included because it's getting popular and is a very different visualization than others (it's not a map or a plot). If you think there are too many on this page already, feel free to close this PR!

I couldn't find any instructions on how to add a page so I did the very bare minimum and also didn't run `make` 
This PR makes it possible for the dependencies .yaml file to point to `htmlDependency` objects that come from other packages, instead of just ones that are bundled in this package.

```
dependencies:
  - call: shiny::bootstrapLib()
```

I'm trying to add a DiagrammeR graph to a xaringan presentation, using `widgetframe::frameWidget()`, but the background color is set to 'white'. A `background` option was added to `saveWidget`, is it possible to add the same option to `createWidget`?
Good afternoon,

I'm having trouble creating a package's binary and running on another computer. When testing on the same computer where the torque was generated, the error does not occur:
``
Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3408
Warning: Error in value[[3L]]: Couldn't normalize path in `addResourcePath`, with arguments: `prefix` = 'htmlwidgets-1.2'; `directoryPath` = '/home/user/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.4/htmlwidgets/www'

It is holding the existing user name in the absolute path of the computer where the binary is being created.

I checked the whole code and there are no variables that have received the absolute path.
