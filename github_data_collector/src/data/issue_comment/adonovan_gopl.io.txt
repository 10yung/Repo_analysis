This code was confusing because it sets `err` even when `closeErr` is `nil`. The PR suggests a modification to clarify the behavior. Alternatively, perhaps adding a comment would be sufficient.
If you accept this patch and add continuous integration (CI) to your repo: 
* It will NOT spoil or compromise your examples;
* Two innocuous files are being added;
* Tests are going to be executed for 1.6x, 1.7x, 1.8x and master (devel). 
* It will help us if/when we translate the examples (variables names and comments). BTW: it might help you too.

Since it doesn't hurt, let me take the liberty of suggesting.

Thank you
