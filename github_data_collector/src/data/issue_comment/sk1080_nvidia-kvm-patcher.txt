Hi

Hardware:
CPU i9-9900K (all 16 cores useable for Windows DomU (VM))
RAM 64GB (Windows DomU 32GB)
Graphics: Nvidia RTX 2070 (Gigabyte) + 441.66 driver
OS: Windows 10 Enterprise 1903
Hypervisor: Xen 4.12 with Centos7

One thing: It was neccessery to add a new signtool path to your script.

One question:
Can I deactivate the testmode after the nvidia driver is installed? Or do I need to leave it on if I want to use the "selfsigned" driver?

BTW: BIG THX FOR THIS PATCH!
TiA

Drivers patch OK (once I have corrected the search path for signtool for newer SDKs) and appear to install OK, but give usual error 43

Windows 10 64-bit LTSC 2019 version 1809, with Quadro P620 passed through on XenServer 8.0 
I keep noticing the same exact bsod on win7, with/without using this repo's script on the windows7 guest.
Here my spec: 
- Windows 7 ultimate (with sp1) x64
- Intel cpu (core i3 2.0 GHz)
- Nvidia 920M
- Acer Aspire E5-573G-3825
I currently have popos! 19.04 (ubuntu basically with some minor changes), uefi is enabled in the bios.
Here is most of my [configuration.](https://gist.github.com/nordmagnus999/a0a90d07e171cd8510208c01e67905ab)
And here is the aforementioned [bsod.](https://imgur.com/a/Yh7cOAk)

I have created a Windows VM with 1903 and the latest WDK.
I have tried the Guide from this Website:
https://forums.unraid.net/topic/69670-guide-fix-nvidia-code-43-issue-on-nvidia-gpu/
The first Problem was in Powershell after this command:
Set Execution Policy to Remote Sign with "set-executionpolicy remotesigned" 
Then i started ./patcher.ps1 C:\NVIDIA\Display.Driver 
I got an error that i cannot execute the Script cause itÂ´s not remotesignd.
I Set : set-executionpolicy unrestricted
After this, your script start working until to the Part you create the cert.
Cert will be created, and then i get 2 error-messages, with the cert. (i can post screenshots if needed)
I copyed the "maybe" patched Driver to my VM on a Windows Server 2016 Host.
I started Setup, it start working, to the Box....installing drivers.
Then i got a message - installing aborted with an red X.
I also tried to install by .inf file...also not working.
In my opinion, there could be a Problem with Windows 1903.
Can you please give me a hint, wich Version i sould use, and wich WDK, or have you a Hint, how i can get this work with Windows 1903.
By the way, thank you for making all these possible, i hope, i can use my Nvidia P1000 in a VM soon. :-)

patching seems not possible.

[+] Unpacking nvlddmkm.sys
[!] Failure: Unable to unpack nvlddmkm.sys

Still error code 43. Using Matebook X Pro laptop with dGPU. Windows 10 sees device, drivers install fine, but drivers block it from starting (guessing because it's prime). Have extracted vbios from BIOS in bare metal Windows 10 before running VM.
When running the script from master, like:
```.\patcher.ps1 "C:\NVIDIA\DisplayDriver\430.64\Win10_64\International\Display.Driver\"```
I get the following error:

I'm getting this when running on files from the latest "430.64-desktop-win10-64bit-international-whql.exe" and also the older version I saw you tested on "419.67-desktop-win10-64bit-international-whql.exe"

Test Mode down at the bottom right says
`Build 17763.rs5_release.180914-1434`
Had some issues with the hard-coded paths provided not matching the correct path on my system. Seems more logical to use a recursive lookup instead, so the paths don't fail on some machines.
### Environment

* OS version: Windows 10 x64
* VGA: Nvidia 960M 
* VM: Virtualbox 6
* Host: Ubuntu 18.04 

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Download the driver from nvidia
2. Unpack them 
3. Run the powershell script in order to patch the driver 
4. Run the setup.exe 

**Expected behavior:** *What you expected to happen*

Solve error 43. 

**Actual behavior:** *What actually happened*

I am not able to install the driver, the requirements check is not bypassed. 
Also by forcing the installation through the "device manager" by selecting the .inf file, I am still getting the error 43.
