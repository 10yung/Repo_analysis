Deploying with the standard configuration and all recommended settings (no windows update) is failing with the following error:

```
{
    "status": "Failed",
    "error": {
        "code": "ResourceDeploymentFailure",
        "message": "The resource operation completed with terminal provisioning state 'Failed'.",
        "details": [
            {
                "code": "VMExtensionProvisioningError",
                "message": "VM has reported a failure when processing extension 'SetupWithoutWindowsUpdate'. Error message: \"Finished executing command\"\r\n\r\nMore information on troubleshooting is available at https://aka.ms/VMExtensionCSEWindowsTroubleshoot "
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Multiple attempts reproduce the same error.
This Script is not working in azure hope you will fix it soon!
First of all - thanks for all the efforts in getting this automated!

I can deploy and connect to an NV VM fine. I can download and install Steam, and the Battle.Net client and can start World of Warcraft, and even interact with it a bit over RDP.

However, when I try to stream the screen just goes black, and the streaming client either returns after a few seconds or hangs. I can hear game music playing in the first instance. Steam mention this specifically: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3629-RIAV-1617#blackscreen.

~~I've updated the latest NVidia drivers but: the download page warns that a restart would be required. I assume if I want to do that then I'll need a managed disk? Attempting it anyway (without restarting the VM) doesn't improve things.~~

~~The same Steam resource suggests a couple of other options, including testing and adjusting MTU settings. I'll be attempting those soon but~~ thought I'd raise this as an issue here in case it'd been seen and there was an obvious solution.

EDIT: I misunderstood the managed OS disk point. MTU settings are at what Steam recommend.

Hi
After deleting VM I've lost whole setup. What do you think to change "evictionPolicy" to "deallocate"?

I cant find the both PC in home stream.I can ping from cloud pc ip to my local pc .
Modified OS disk to SSD drive.

I wasn't able to connect with remote desktop.  On closer inspection it doesn't look like port 3389 is set in the NAT incoming settings.
### Hi. I try to run CS:GO with Steam and got an error with D3D. Look at the attachment. 
What do I need to do next?
