I'm sorry I'm new to Github, where do I find the code?
Thanks a million!
Hello, I want to know how to determine the value of the filtCutOff in Script.mï¼š

filtCutOff =5;
[b, a] = butter(1, (2*filtCutOff)/(1/samplePeriod), 'low');
acc_magFilt = filtfilt(b, a, acc_magFilt);

Hi!

Great code, thanks for sharing!

I have been having bad results with lower frequencies, even with 200Hz, and I wonder if it's because the signal is no good or if i'm doing something wrong. 

I noticed your samples have higher acceleration magnitudes and they describe a pattern, something very different from mine, that look like noise.

Do you have any insights that could help?

When we change stop time of spiral stairs dataset from 47 to 40, the plot generated is entirely wrong. Position in z-direction turns negative while it is positive and shows steps when stop time is  47. Steps in the initial time ( from 5 to 40 sec) should not change at all but that is not the case. The length of the step in the initial period changes and z of even the initial period becomes negative. Can you tell me, what's going wrong?
I have attached the screenshots for both the cases.

Greetings,

is there a way to port this code to be compatible with NGIMU hardware? 
x-IMU hardware isn't available anymore on the website.


Main thing is that the CSV files created by the NGIMU Data Logger/Converter contains the time in the first column; the matlab script accepts a 'packet number'. This packet number may be a sequence of integers, but not all packet numbers are "1" - step from each other (i.e. gaps exist).

How does the packet number relate to time?

Kind regards,
Thomas
Hi. thank you for the code. It is extremely use full for learning. I was wondering if I can use this code to estimate my UAV flight trajectory using same IMU readings from the Flight controller of UAV.
I want to visualise my own data IMU data how to change from .csv to .bin to allow matlab to read it ?
Hello, thank you for your fantastic code, I am trying to measure the length of each walked step, using insole sensor(pressure sensor) and IMU, data fusion is already done inside the IMU, so I have the three accelerations and the three angles which I am reading from a text file..I performed three step of length 
55 cm, 56 cm, 54cm each one,
I want to ask if anyone can help me to understand where are the errors to be corrected in order to have more accurate results

Firstly, thank you for your code. I'm new to matlab. When I run Script I get the following error:

Undefined function or variable 'xIMUdataClass'.

Error in Script (line 26)
xIMUdata = xIMUdataClass(filePath, 'InertialMagneticSampleRate',
1/samplePeriod);
