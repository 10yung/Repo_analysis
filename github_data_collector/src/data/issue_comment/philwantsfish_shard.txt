shard reads the presentation of a captcha for LinkedIn as a false positive
My current facebook password includes a bunch of very unusual characters. For obvious reasons I'll just put a range of characters that might include additional characters not actually in my password.

```
~`¬|><@+=*&^%£{}[]()
```

I'm not sure what the problem is, the result to the post still includes login links. Does facebook sometimes show captchas or something alike?

I'm not sure if this should be handled in any way. I wrote a test and used the above email to check to see if rejection would work. Turned out that facebook and linkedin treat this specific email in a special way.

I don't know if this should be taken care of or not. Just wanted to put it out there...
