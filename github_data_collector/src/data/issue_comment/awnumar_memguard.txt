**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Using guard pages has a tradeoff of taking up more unmanaged memory pages, which could be a potential concern in high traffic scenarios.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Would be nice if there was an option to skip use guard pages when creating `LockedBuffer`s. Can obviously keep using them by default but allow the user to pass in an option to avoid them. Whether this is exposed as part of the `Enclave` related usage should be considered, but could probably be handled separately, if needed.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Considered using `Enclave`, but in the expected traffic/usage patterns (cached keys, multiple concurrent users), it would likely lead to more unmanaged memory usage.

**Additional context**
