I want to create a java project,but the plugin create a scala project

For me, the most useful aspect of 'np' is the generation of src/main/scala, resources, test etc, because I use Intellij and have to do it manually otherwise. I'd like to be able to use the np command to do this, even if I have defined my build.sbt file manually. However, currently this seems disallowed:

```
> np
[trace] Stack trace suppressed: run last compile:np for the full output.
[error] (compile:np)
[error] existing project detected at the path /Users/ben_hutchison/swork/scala101
[error] Total time: 0 s, completed Feb 13, 2014 12:18:43 PM
```

The docs suggest you /may/, as opposed to /must/, mixin npSettings at the global ~/.sbt/build.sbt level, and suggests that if you do not, the settings are visible under a npSettings namespace.

In SBT 0.13, when I omit 'seq(npSettings: _*)' from the global config, I'm not able to access npSettings nor np in a project - see below. Please show an example of use in the docs, or else make it clearer it's mandatory.

```
[ben_hutchison@VIC009228M scala101 ]$ cat ~/.sbt/0.13/build.sbt

//IDEs download source code but not javadoc for dependencies
EclipseKeys.withSource := true

transitiveClassifiers in Global := Seq(Artifact.SourceClassifier)

[ben_hutchison@VIC009228M scala101 ]$ cat ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/build.sbt

//sync SBT project definition to IDEs
addSbtPlugin("com.github.mpeltonen" % "sbt-idea" % "1.6.0")

addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbteclipse" % "sbteclipse-plugin" % "2.4.0")

//quickly init new scala projects
addSbtPlugin("me.lessis" % "np" % "0.2.0")
```

```

If dir specified, np will create a target folder along with project folder.

And I think if the dir key is not specified, np should create a directory using project name by default.
