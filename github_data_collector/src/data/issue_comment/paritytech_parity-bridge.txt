<p><strong>HeaderMap::Drain API is unsound</strong>
Affected versions of this crate incorrectly used raw pointer,
which introduced unsoundness in its public safe API.</p>
<p><a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hyperium/http/issues/354">Failing to drop the Drain struct causes double-free</a>,
and <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hyperium/http/issues/355">it is possible to violate Rust's alias rule and cause data race with Drain's Iterator implementation</a>.</p>
<p>The flaw was corrected in 0.1.20 release of <code>http</code> crate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Integer Overflow in HeaderMap::reserve() can cause Denial of Service</strong>
<code>HeaderMap::reserve()</code> used <code>usize::next_power_of_two()</code> to calculate the increased capacity.
However, <code>next_power_of_two()</code> silently overflows to 0 if given a sufficently large number
in release mode.</p>
<p>If the map was not empty when the overflow happens,
the library will invoke <code>self.grow(0)</code> and start infinite probing.
This allows an attacker who controls the argument to <code>reserve()</code>
to cause a potential denial of service (DoS).</p>
