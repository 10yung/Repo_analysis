Swiss small/medium enterprise (KMU) template since 2013
Base part by @mblind

@mblind, ich war leider zwischenzeitlich abgelenkt. Ein paar Kommentare, was ich erst beim Ausprobieren gesehen habe: Ich
1. finde die Kontonummern in der Beschreibungsspalte (Description) eher nervig. Die eher gedacht für Zusätze wie "nach §x ..."
2. vermisse die Markierung der "Überschriften" als Platzhhalter (Placeholder)

Magst du da noch Änderungen für einbringen?

Just some bug fixes and thought I would park them here for any comments.
The first one should be OK.
The second one fixes a misunderstanding I had when trying to fix the focus when pages were selected, the original was not specific enough, worked OK when there was only one plugin of a kind so this commit fixes that and all plugins now use the same approach.
The last commit builds on the previous commit for register plugin_pages in that it sets a flag on the register sheet to indicate whether it should grab keyboard focus. This fixes an issue when reconciling an account that when done the keyboard focus may be on an other register.
This can be seen by having a couple of registers open, choose one to reconcile, OK on the start window and then postpone it. Depending on the order the registers were opened, the keyboard focus may be on another register observed by typing with no visible result.

@mtalexander complained in [gnucash-devel](https://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-devel/2020-January/044473.html) that 7853f5a24a4ed6e5cf32fdf6e5eba217a1e312cd had broken two features of OFX file imports, subaccounts and the ability to detect new accounts and ask if they should be created. This PR addresses and I think corrects both issues.
Reinstate Income/Expense/Transfer/Total, but rename to:

* Inflow from Income
* Outflow to Expense
* Outflow to Asset/Liability/Equity
* Remaining to budget

Behavior should be identical to previous release v3.7

* I'm happy to drop things/split things to some extent. If there are third party modules that I've failed to exclude, please let me know.
* I don't correct intentional misspellings (esp. in changelogs), although I would discourage people from including them -- it's better to only mention the intended spelling as opposed to the misspellings, people generally don't need to know how a word was misspelled.
* There are a couple of places where I'm inserting `[??]` into the code. That's because I absolutely couldn't figure out what was intended -- you obviously don't want that. I'll try to flag them in GitHub...
* There are probably a bunch of places where I've altered whitespace (because old/new words have different lengths). -- This isn't particularly intentional, the tooling I'm using doesn't actively consider this -- I have to manually fix up, I can if requested.
* This corpus appears to favor en-US, so I've generally enforced that.
* I also tend to enforce names, I may have guessed wrong, in which case I'm sorry.

(Fwiw, for a large and very old project, this isn't a bad number of changes.)

In the account hierarchy assistant the choice of account template was
decided by the your locale and so could be limited. Add two combos so
you can select account templates by language and region.
@fellen Frank does this do what you want?
Swedish organization bas.se creates standard account hierarchies for business. These are two implementations for GNU Cash (small and medium-sized business)
