Hi, I hope you will be fine. I am testing test_parse_all_data with kitti data set. However, there is an error on line 37 in parseAllData.m
netvlad_time_file = [root 'times.txt'];
 times.txt data file is not available. 
Please guide me as soon as possible. 
Matlab report an error when running initDecentrState.m in line 61:

T_O_W(1:3,1:3)*full_state{I}.p_W_lm'+T_O_W(1:3,4);

I think the problem maybe caused by mismatch of matrix dimension to plus,  so I replace 

T_O_W(1:3,4) with iron(ones(1,size(full_state{I}.p_W_lm,1),1),T_O_W(1:3,4)). 

It can pass, but I wonder is this correct? 
I just want to use the data in the article to see the result graph, but it hasn't been successful. Can you give me some more detailed instructions to get me to run the GIF diagram?Nowï¼Œi encouraged problem when i run rectify_stata.launch.
Hello, I have read the paper  "Data-Efficient Decentralized Visual SLAM" of you. And there has a question I can not understand. How to estimate the relative pose between robots, did the robot know the initial pose of other robots? Or is there have a common reference frame knew by all robots? Look forward to your reply, thanks.
when i run the command "catkin build",it appeared.i don't know what is the meaning?And where is the "runDistributedMapper",where is the "feature/logging"?i can't find these.mybe i make a mistake when installed.i can't run the simulation!please give me some advice,thank you!
