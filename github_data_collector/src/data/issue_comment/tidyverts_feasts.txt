From #70

Use a `difftime` to represent lags instead of the `cf_lag` class.
Store the interval elsewhere for plot breaks.
Add some of the functionality of `tsclean()` and `tsoutliers` from the *forecast* package.

Hi,
I think that the names of the functions `SEATS()` and `X11()` (or the associated documentation) can be misleadings since, if I'm not mistaken, in both functions the seasonal decomposition is made with X-13ARIMA-SEATS. In both case a pre-adjustment step is done to adjust from trading days effects, some outliers, etc. And a forecast of this pre-adjusted series is done. Then it is this pre-adjusted series that is decomposes with SEATS or X-11.  
Therefore, `X11()` doesn’t not perform a seasonal adjustment with X-11 but with X-13ARIMA-SEATS.

Maybe I should ask this other question in another issue but I was also wondering why the decomposition mode is forced with `X11()` (to additive) and not with `SEATS()`? By default X-13ARIMA-SEATS performs an automatic selection of the decomposition mode and the most common decomposition mode for economic time series is multiplicative.
At the moment the column name is given as `V1` if a function is passed, otherwise a named list will rectify this. I'm not sure if it's worth it, but I was thinking it might be nice to have some auto-naming of columns if a named list is not provided. 

So ideally the first function would return the same output as the second.

What do you think?

When asking for an STL decomposition, it should always use an STL decomposition. The current behaviour of calling Friedman's SuperSmoother for non-seasonal data is incorrect and can cause confusion and inconsistencies with features.

This will require re-implementing STL, and while doing so it would be worthwhile to add support for exogenous regressors.
Which lag is most appropriate? Old or new?
Which gives best ARIMA performance on M3/M4?
With @earowang:
Rather than accepting values, these functions should accept `...`, which computes the ACF/PACF for each column with the resulting column names matching the input names (rather than just acf)

Details for the type of `cf` used will be stored as an attribute for printing and plotting.

For CCF, it should evaluate all pairwise cross-correlations, with resulting names joined by `*`
This should use the distribution or hilo class from fable. These class definitions should probably be ported to feasts, thoughts @robjhyndman?
