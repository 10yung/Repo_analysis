Ran the r update according to screen shots provided on line. Trying to update 3.4.2 to current 3.6.2. Ended with: 
Running the installer now...

Followed by many:

HELP! It is making me crazy.

When using `updateR()` or `updateR(TRUE)`, I'm receiving this error:

> Error in file(con, "r") : cannot open the connection
> In addition: Warning message:
> In file(con, "r") :
>   InternetOpenUrl failed: 'A connection with the server could not be established'

I've allowed access through the firewall for RStudio and R. I've stopped my anti-virus. I'm also running as an Administrator.

I also tried `options(download.file.method = "libcurl")`.

None has helped.

`sessionInfo()` is:

As you probably know, `setInternet2(TRUE)` in the newer versions of R is _defunct_, so it is no fix.
Boy, `download_RStudio_CRAN_data()` can sure create a big request!  Rather than choose a range of consecutive dates I wanted to sample a few days from a wider range.  For instance, 5 random days over the past year.

I added `subsample=NULL` to the function parameters and this code to the function

```
  if (is.numeric(subsample)){
    all_days <- sample(all_days,min(length(all_days),subsample))
  }
```
If you like it, I'll issue a pull request.  Thanks. 
PS: I've never contributed to a package before.
The method is a bit sloppily written and saves a downloaded file with a name that derives from the URL. This is hugely problematic when it comes to URLs containing parameters. My method `install.from.url` in the package [`rbettersyntax`](https://github.com/RLogik/rbettersyntax) avoids this issue, by cleanly assigning random names. It allows one to unzip files when necessary and flexibly determines where the package root folder lies. Here is an example:

`install.from.url(url='http://mydomain.de/R/repositories?file=mypackage.zip&v=1.3&lang=en', unzip=TRUE);`

By contrast, `installr::install.URL` / `installr::install.packages.zip`, cannot handle URLs like this, which are quite common.
Hello!

I copied packages from old to new version of R, all went well. Next step, updating all packages, results in error. I assume it's a space in the directory path:

Error: '//server/username/My' not found'
Attempts to use freegeoip() now result in:

Error in file(con, "r") : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In file(con, "r") : cannot open URL 'http://freegeoip.net/json/155.186.245.217' : HTTP status was  '403 Forbidden'

If you navigate to http://freegeoip.net/json/155.186.245.217 in your browser, you receive this prompt:

i'm new user on R, i'm trying to use read.xls function, I installed "installr" package, "gdata" package, and "perl"
but still have the same error
[could not find function "read.xls"] 
Hello,

when I use either the CRAN or the development version of your package, I receive error messages and don't understand why:

```
R> installr::check.for.updates.R(page_with_download_url="https://cran.stat.unipd.it/bin/windows/base/", GUI=FALSE, notify_user=FALSE)
Error in if (there_is_a_newer_version) { : 
  missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed
```

even install::check.for.updates.R() leads to this error message.

Thank you very much for your hrelp!

Best regards,
Markus
Hello,

When I execute the code (end of this post)

Everything is fine, except when I try to execute

`wm`

I get

```
> wm
Error in grid.Call.graphics(C_polygon, x$x, x$y, index) : 
  invalid color name 'blackcat'
```
I am expecting worldmap instead.

Workaround is below .... please fix

```
wm$layers[[1]]$aes_params$colour <- "black"
wm
```

Code

```
install.packages(devtools)
library(devtools)
install_github("talgalili/installr", username="talgalili")
library(installr)
RStudio_CRAN_data_folder <- download_RStudio_CRAN_data(START = '2013-06-10',
                                                       END = '2013-06-17')
my_RStudio_CRAN_data <- read_RStudio_CRAN_data(RStudio_CRAN_data_folder)
wm <- pkgDNLs_worldmapcolor(pkg_name="timeROC",
                            dataset = my_RStudio_CRAN_data)
wm

```
Dear Sir,
R is running in local Driver D:/R/R-3.4.0

When I run **install.R(keep_install_file = TRUE, download_dir =  "E:\\R Project\\R Associated Programs")**
I get the following 
The file was downloaded successfully into:
 E:\R Project\R Associated Programs/R-3.4.1-win.exe 

Running the installer now...
'E:\R' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
[1] FALSE
Warning messages:
1: running command 'C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /c E:\R Project\R Associated Programs/R-3.4.1-win.exe' had status 1 
2: In shell(install_cmd, wait = wait, ...) :
  'E:\R Project\R Associated Programs/R-3.4.1-win.exe' execution failed with error code 1

Would you please advise.
Thanks 
Mohamed
