Using 79.0.3945.117 Chrome on macOS 10.15.2
Since using "Set Chrome as default browser" within Epichrome app will result in setting original Chrome app as default browser and thinking that is too much tricky to fix it, what about setting --no-default-browser-check in all Epichrome apps by default?
Next, what about an option during creation script which permits creating Epichrome apps that start in incognito mode by default?
BTW, really like your work
Hey @dmarmor, having an odd issue with an older browser I'd not fired up since before your last major updates. I was using [Proxy SwitchyOmega](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchyomega/padekgcemlokbadohgkifijomclgjgif?hl=en) to pass the connection through another ISP and found that when I fired it up and upgraded it to the newest Epichrome release, I now cannot go to any sites.  Furthermore resetting the settings hasn't helped... Any thoughts about digging into and resetting proxy/connection settings that might have been modified by such an app? I assume there's something somewhere b0rked in this regard, but I'm not finding it...
I use GCalendar as an EpiCrome app, 2.2.4 and since my Catalina upgrade it stopped sending notifications, which off cause is rather unhelpful. Also only one EpiChrom app shows up in preferences for notifications.
After upgrading to Catalina, Epichrome apps unfortunately no longer work for me. The issues seem very similar to routing issues experienced with Mojave (which were eventually fixed).
These are the two main issues I've been experiencing:
- An Epichrome app instance is often erroneously identified as the default browser instead of Chrome. (It's not always the same one.) Quitting the Epichrome app usually temporary fixes this. (i.e. Links route to the correct default Chrome while the 'problem' Epichrome app is not running.) The 'Stop further handling' option has occasionally done what it's supposed to, but usually doesn't. 
- Links triggered from within an Epichrome app open in that app instead of routing to open in the correct default Chrome browser. (If the default browser is set to something else like Safari, it seems to be less of an issue, but I haven't tested this extensively.)

Anyone else experiencing these issues with Catalina? Any suggested fixes? The problems seem very similar to what happened with Mojave so I'm hoping there's a fix for this. (I've tried deleting and recreating Epichrome apps with no success.)
After upgrading to Catalina, my vanilla Chrome instance won't  allow Google Hangouts to screen share unless I add Chrome to the System Preferences/Security & Privacy/Privacy list to permit "Screen Recording". 

I was able to add an Epichrome instance of Chome, but Chrome itself does not get added to the list in System Preferences. There is no manual way to add apps to the list. So, I cannot figure out a way to let Google Hangouts in Chrome screen share.

In the following image, the IGS app is an epichrome instance.

I'm trying to make an Epichrome app of Google Voice on Mojave. However on Mojave, Chrome has to request permission for microphone access. Epichrome apps neither inherit this permission, nor do they trigger the request for their own bundle/id.
Epichrome apps used to respond to the Google Chrome AppleScript interface, which I used extensively to automate and integrate them.

Recently I switched laptops and in the process recreated a few of them. Now I've noticed that they no longer seems to respond to the Chrome AppleScript API. For example (I have an Epichrome app for OpsGenie):
```
> osascript -e 'tell application "Google Chrome" to URL of active tab of window 1'
https://www.google.com/
> osascript -e 'tell application "OpsGenie" to URL of active tab of window 1'
38:48: syntax error: A property can’t go after this identifier. (-2740)
```

I've also tried specifying the ChromeEngine app inside the application bundle, but I get the same:

```
> osascript -e 'tell application "/Applications/OpsGenie.app/Contents/Resources/ChromeEngine/OpsGenie.app" to URL of active tab of window 1'
101:111: syntax error: A property can’t go after this identifier. (-2740)
```

Is it still possible to make this work? I found this feature extremely useful.

The apps I create with Epichrome have been intermittently either losing the custom icon, or losing the app name.

So a few minutes ago I noticed my "tulane.app" no longer showed the Tulane logo on the Mac app switcher, and instead showed the Chrome icon.

Then I quit and relaunched "tulane.app" and now the Tulane logo is back on the Mac app switcher, but the app name in the menubar has reverted to Chrome (not "Tulane").

I'm not aware of doing anything specific to update Epichrome or Chrome or my "tulane.app", so I have no idea what's causing this.

Thoughts?
I just upgraded to the latest public beta of Mac OS Mojave, which is being released in just a few days and I've found that it has broken Epichrome! I tried to characterize and research as much as possible, because I love the app so much, and I want to help out!

Issue: Epichrome browser apps now are preventing google chrome the main app, from being the default browser.
Result: All browser events are now sent to a random epichrome app.
Workaround: Remove all epichrome apps from my computer. Or manually re-create epichrome apps, which seems to resolve the issue. See details below.

Details:
When you create an Epichrome browser you are prompted if you want the new app to be registered as a browser. I always choose no on this option. Since I've updated to Mojave my epichrome apps are preventing google chrome the original app being the default browser. The end result of this is that when links are opened in apps they are directed to one of my epichrome browsers as the default app. The challenge is that I cannot go to system preferences: general and change the default browser to google chrome, it's not an option in that list. Just the random epichrome browser. To fix  this behavior I had to delete all my epichrome apps, and once they were all gone, then google chrome re-appeared as my default browser. 

Note: After removing all my epichrome apps the issue was resolved and I saw google chrome as a default browser in my system preferences: general tab, but as soon as I added one back, google chrome disappeared and the epichrome app became the default, overridding google chrome.

Note: I've tried 69 and 70 (beta) of google chrome with the same behavior.

Note: I just tried re-creating one of my epichrome apps and it did not cause the issue. It seems like upgraded apps are causing the problem. I can re-create all my apps, but it would be great if someone figured out how to resolve this issue, so we don't all have to re-create our apps.
Just a heads up here. Updated to the most recent build of Mojave and had an interesting issue arise. Each time I attempted to create an Epichrome app I was getting an AppleScript hang. I noticed that for some reason it was hanging Finder.  On relaunch of Finder, Epichrome proceeded naturally. I noticed that TotalFinder did not restart on relaunch so it seems like TotalFinder may have some issues that are causing some hangs or such - or it could just be Finder hanging altogether. Either way you slice it, Finder hangs are problematic.
