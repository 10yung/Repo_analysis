Ran the Xcode 10 migration wizard, no code changes.

We use this project as a submodule off a tag, it would be greatly appreciated if you could merge this a create a new tag from it so we can kill the Xcode warnings. Thanks!
I want to know if KVOController can be used in textField editing?

var textField: UITextField?
kvoController.observe(textField, keyPath: "text", options: .new) { (viewController, object, change) in
            self.SureButton.backgroundColor = UIColor.red
        }
When textField completes the editing, the first response is cancelled, and the color of the button changes.

But I want to realize that when textField edit, change the color of the button, how to use it?
