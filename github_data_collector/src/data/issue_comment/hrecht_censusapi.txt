Hi I found some errors when pulling multiple variables from ACS 5 yr data (11-16), and I believe this cause is that the census does not return the estimates in the same order at ZCTA level. And since the package just does a simple colbind for the variables, some of the estimates are mis-matched with the geoid's.

I tried to pull each indicator separately and merge them together by their geoid, everything looks fine then. 
The parameter names in makeVarlist are not particularly clear, especially varsearch. I'd like to rethink that function (and add more options) in a future release. Open to suggestions!
