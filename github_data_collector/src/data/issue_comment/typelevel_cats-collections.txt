According to @johnynek's review comments:

https://github.com/typelevel/cats-collections/pull/201#pullrequestreview-250248153
Any reason that `Heap.remove` doesn't return the min element in addition to the new Heap, i.e. `(Option[A], Heap[A])`?

I'm new to this repo, but would have guessed that was the much more common operation.

Perhaps a new `pop` method would be the way to add it?

This is simple and I need it, so I'll PR it if it sounds good, thanks!
