I noticed on the vmpooler VMs that ScreenSaverEngine seems to be using
an inordinate amount of CPU time (30-50%) so this change should disable
the login window screen saver entirely since there is no need for a
headless VM to have it running.

I have no idea if this is the best place to add this or not. I tried to build locally (first a 10.12 image since 10.13 is based on that) but I seemed to be missing some settings. :/
Attempt to make the uri settings for redhat mirrored repos configurable using environment.  This introduces following envs : 
PACKER_REDHAT_OS_REPO = someurl
PACKER_REDHAT_OPTIONAL_REPO = someurl
PACKER_REDHAT_EXTRA_REPO = someurl

These are translates to facts in the *.base.json.
Whenever unset or all are empty, we include the stock packer::repo class, otherwise we include the packer::community_repso class.  Last one include only those repos if the environment is set.
