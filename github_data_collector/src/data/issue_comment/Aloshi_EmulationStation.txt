Hello, 
I have a problem. I installed emulationstation on my old computer on windows 7 but I have square instead of the text.
Weird. Like if I don't have the typography.
Wich one is used? 
Can you help me?

Thanks a lot
Now that the Raspberry Pi 4 has 2 HDMI ports and you can hook up dual displays, maybe it makes sense to start a conversation about being able to support a 2 display interface, with 1 display dedicated for games, and a 2nd display used for settings and selecting games.  For those that don't have 2 displays but have an iPad, iPhone, tablet, or other screen that can remotely connect, it might be nice if you could use those devices to remote in and control the primary device.

I'd love to be able to use touch interfaces, a keyboard or a mouse to scroll through long lists of games and a game pad just isn't as good for those tasks.

It all started when I downloaded a theme that ended up being too large for storage and forced emulationstation to crash. I deleted the theme and reset it to carbon, reinstalled emulationstation and yet still crashing. Could use some help
Hi,

I'm looking for a way to have two controller simultaneously control ES and running emulators/games.
So for examples I want to be able to configure the D-pad on USB controller A, but use the fire buttons from controller B.

A friend of mine depends on the Adaptive Controller (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Adaptive_Controller) and in order to play games she needs AC and a second controller as well.

Thx
Hello,
I am running ES on a linux mainline kernel (retrorangepi, a retropie build for sunxi/Allwinner SoC).
My device have a RGB24 LCD connected and a HDMI out.
Currently ES is launching on the LCD. But the HDMI out only shows the console.

On Xfce dual screen works properly. I can select the primary monitor, arrange them left right and resolutions and so on.

I am trying to get this : 
- When HDMI is plugged in, switch ES to HDMI
- When HDMI is disconnected, switch back ES to LCD.

Or alternatively clone the framebuffer to both HDMI and LCD with LCD resolution (64
0*480) so that when HDMI is connected it can show the signal.

I am not sure how to do this. Should I try to make changes on ES source code so that it outputs to both framebuffer or support HDMI detection and switch? Or should I try to edit DRM driver code to clone framebuffers to both outputs?

First option looks like the right way to do it, but I am not sure if it would work only in ES and not in games?

Thanks!





Hi, I'm working on a project to integrate an LED matrix marquee with EmulationStation and RetroPie. Using the runcommand-onstart.sh and runcommand-onend.sh scripts in RetroPie, I'm able to change the LED matrix to artwork that matches the game that has been launched. That works just fine, video of that working here

I'd like to take it one step farther and also be able to change the LED matrix as the user is scrolling through games on EmulationStation (before launching a game). I do have an existing REST API ==>http://ledpixelart.com/pixelcade-api/ and just need a hook I can tie into to trigger my API based on front end scrolling events in EmulationStation. Specifically, my API would need rom name and platform name passed.

Would like to know if this is achievable and if so, any pointers where to get started would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
This allows the user to pass an API key for the gamesdb scraper. It works by letting users add scraper configurations to es_systems.cfg (maybe not the right place?)

Here's an example of what the segment looks like:
```xml
<scrapers>
	<scraper>
		<name>gamesdb</name><!-- only valid scraper name atm -->
		<path>api.thegamesdb.net/Games/ByGameName</path><!-- currently unused -->
		<APIKey>REDACTED/APIKey>
	</scraper>
</scrapers>
```

The idea is try to make scrapers as configurable as possible, but at the moment the only valid name is `gamesdb` and the only used child element of a scraper is `<APIKEY>`. The code I have works, but obviously this needs to be cleaned up. ~~For one thing, ratings, developers, publishers and genres aren't yet supported.~~ For another, it's a long way from truly configurable. But hopefully this is a good enough starting point for some feedback.

## Update
Basic support for scraping developers, publishers and genres has been added. Currently, there doesn't appear to be a way to access ratings through the TheGamesDB API. Fetching each requires a minimum of 3 synchronous API requests, at the moment. I expect that I'll want to make those asynchronous - similar to the image/thumbnail fetches - in the future. But it's a bit more complex than those because the fetched information is share-able between all games scraped with that scraper.

But I digress. Next up is refining the configuration files a bit.
With the release of RasberryPi 4 with 4k, what do you guys think of an all new UI? I always felt like the design looks outdated, especially compared to Apple tvOS, Netflix, PS4, etc.

I would love to do some layouts but have limited time only. I got something super sleek and simple in my mind.

Maybe you could make an open request where designers all around the world could send in ui/ux designs and you or the community votes for the best one?
As of 24th of June 2019, none of the two scrapers are returning any matches, nor throwing any error messages when failing to scrap.
This is a bit related to #549 but it would be extremely handy if we could use the Release Date of a scraped rom to sort it. It'd really make for a wonderful archival history of roms for a system.
