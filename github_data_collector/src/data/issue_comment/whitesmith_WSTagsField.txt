Hi , I am using the latest version of it , which can't be support the in the Arabic language It should support for english - start from left and the Arabic Language - start from right.



### Which version of the WSTagsField are you using? 
E.g. `5.2.0`

### On which platform does the issue happen? 
E.g. `< iOS 13.0`

### Are you using Carthage? 
no

### Are you using Cocoapods? 
no

### Which version of Xcode are you using? 
(`11.2`)

### What did you do?
I added WSTagsField as a new Package Dependency and when I compile I get an error that the minimum iOS version for WSTagsField is iOS 13. Upon looking at the Package.swift file I see the platform is listed as 13, but in the wiki it states iOS 9 in the minimum. I have used this library before but with Carthage and had no problems targeting platforms < iOS 13.
```
platforms: [
        .iOS(.v13)
    ],
```

### What did you expect to happen?
For it to compile.

### What happened instead?
It did not compile.

This pull request addresses issue #100. It adds a boolean toggle named `allowMultipleSelection` that allows a user to select multiple tags at once. 

```
let cities = ["London", "New York", "Chicago"]
let tagField = WSTagsField()
tagField.allowMultipleSelection = true
```

Also, a boolean toggle named `removable` is added that doesn't allow a tag to be removed. This is inside `WSTagView` and set with a setter named `setRemovable(tags: [String], removable: Bool = false)`. This method will throw an exception if called before any tags are added.

```
let cities = ["London", "New York", "Chicago"]
let tagField = WSTagsField()
tagField.addTags(cities)
tagField.setRemovable(cities) //removable set to false by default
```

 Finally, a helper function is created named `getSelectedTagStrings()` that gets all tags as a list of strings.

```
let cities = ["London", "New York", "Chicago"]
let tagField = WSTagsField()
tagField.getSelectedTagStrings()
```

### Which version of the WSTagsField are you using? 
3.1.0

### On which platform does the issue happen? 
E.g. `iOS11`

### Are you using Carthage? 
No

### Are you using Cocoapods? 
1.4.0

### Which version of Xcode are you using? 
Xcode 9.4.1

### What did you do?
I'm trying to allow multiple tags to be selected. What I have tried to do is override `selectTagView(_ tagView: WSTagView, animated: Bool)` in order to simply toggle the selected state of the tagView, but it seems like even when removing the block to unselect all of the other tags...

`tagViews.filter { $0 != tagView }.forEach {
	$0.selected = false
	onDidUnselectTagView?(self, $0)
}`
...they all still get unselected. 

### What did you expect to happen?
Multiple tags to be selected

### What happened instead?
They seem to all get unselected and then the tag the user selected is shown.

Allows users of the library to set the background color of a tag when adding it to the search field

```swift
tagInput.addTag(tag.name, backgroundColor: tag.color)
```

Hi, I'm trying to calculate the height the WSTagsField needs in my view, any way to get that easily? I tried using sizeThatFits, but it seems not implemented and  is returning 0:

        let fullSize = CGSize(width: width, height: CGFloat.greatestFiniteMagnitude)
        var totalHeight: CGFloat = 0.0
        totalHeight += titleLabel.sizeThatFits(fullSize).height // this works fine for a normal label
        totalHeight += tagsField.sizeThatFits(fullSize).height // returns 0
        return totalHeight

### Which version of the WSTagsField are you using? 
3.1.0
### On which platform does the issue happen? 
ios 11
### Are you using Carthage? 
no
### Are you using Cocoapods? 
1.4.0
### Which version of Xcode are you using?

How add only horizontal scroll on **WSTagsField**, not vertical? I think the horizontal scroll is much more usable than the vertical one. Is it possible to make only a horizontal scroll?
This request was mentioned in #75

Hi there,
Could you please add functionality for autocomplete for tags. 

Also if you don't have time to do that could you describe idea how it could be implemented so I could maybe start working on that feature.

Any help, suggestions are highly appreciated.

Thank you
