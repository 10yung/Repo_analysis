### Issue Description

Hi !

Thank you for this powerful tool :)

I am using Tabman in some controllers without troubles but in the following one, when I scroll on my UITableView (with correct constraints - as in Troubleshooting - and everything set as mentioned), the header view is going under and not adjusted correctly when hiding the navigation bar on swipe.

Thank you so much for helping me, and enjoy your day !
This my code for bar configure, but when I tapped button, color not change. What am I doing wrong ? 

```
   func topBarConfigure() {
        let bar = TMBar.ButtonBar()
        bar.indicator.isHidden = true
        bar.layout.contentInset = UIEdgeInsets(top: 10, left: 16.0, bottom: 0, right: 16.0)
       
        bar.buttons.customize { button in
            button.layer.cornerRadius = 4
            button.selectedTintColor = .white
            button.layer.masksToBounds  = true
            button.contentInset = UIEdgeInsets(top: 12, left: 16.0, bottom: 12, right: 16.0)
            button.selectedTintColor = .white
            
            
            switch button.selectionState {
            case .unselected:
                button.tintColor = .white
                button.backgroundColor = .gray
            case .partial(_):
                button.tintColor = .white
                button.backgroundColor = .mainGreen
            case .selected:
                button.tintColor = .white
                button.backgroundColor = .mainGreen
            }
        }
        
        addBar(bar, dataSource: self, at: .top)
    }
```

Please help me out with this bar length its length is larger then text size ..
Add support so that an indicator width does not have to equal the width of the button it is representing. For example:

- Indicator width to be the width of the button without the badge.
- Arbitary insets on the indicator width against the button.
