After upgrading an app to Expo 36.0.0 ("react": "16.9.0","react-native":"0.61.4") ScrollableTabView causes the app crash ("react-native-scrollable-tab-view": "^1.0.0").

Error:
```
Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops.

On tap it works fine, but on swipe, jerk observed while changing tabs.

ViewPagerAndroid is not used and causes an error in Expo 36.0.0
Hello;

let the user specify the font size for the text component in the tab.

Thanks

```js

// Default allowFontScaling:true

<DefaultTabBar allowFontScaling={false} />
<ScrollableTabBar allowFontScaling={false} />
```

用的AndroidX，需要react-native-viewpager 3.0以上版本，此项目中用的是2.0.2的，有什么解决办法吗？
<!--
  Thanks for reporting a issue!

  In order to be able to help out I need you to provide a
  reproduction repository. That means you !!! should !!! provide a reachable repository which reproduces the issue you're experiencing.

  This will greatly improve the chance for you to get the bug fixed and me to be able to find it.
-->

- [x] I have searched [existing issues](https://github.com/happypancake/react-native-scrollable-tab-view/issues)
- [x] I am using the [latest scrollable tab view version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-scrollable-tab-view)

<!--
  Describe your issue in detail.
-->
This isn't an issue so-to-say, but more of a start of a discussion around using https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-viewpager on iOS as well as Android, instead of `ScrollView`. I'm unaware as to if there's been a reason historically for not using this (and if so, then please close this!) or perhaps there's just not been the time and it's on the list of things to do! 😄

I'm aware that this project has only been using `react-native-community`'s `ViewPager` since `v1.0.0`, and previously `ViewPagerAndroid` was used (explaining the OS split), but if we're able to use `ViewPager` on both that could bring benefits to the project. It'd be great to discuss this!

## Steps to Reproduce
<!--
  Required. Let us know how to reproduce the issue. Include a code sample or issue will be closed.
-->
As this isn't an issue as such, there are no replication steps. However, if it's decided to move forward with this, I'm happy to bring my patch file into a fork of this repo and open a PR for review!

## Expected Behavior
<!--
  Write what you thought would happen.
-->
That both platforms use `ViewPager`, now it isn't only for Android 🤖

## Actual Behavior
<!--
  Write what happened. Include screenshots if needed.
-->
iOS still uses `ScrollView`, and Android keeps all the fun 😢
