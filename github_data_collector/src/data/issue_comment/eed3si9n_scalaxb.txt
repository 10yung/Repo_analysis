When trying to use `sbt-scalaxb:1.7.3` (or any number of previous versions thereof), I am getting the below compilation error when compiling generated sources for [this XSD](https://docs.radial.com/rom/Content/Topics/feeds/schemas/CommonTypes.xsd)

Note: this xsd includes other xsd definitions, but the problem occurs with or without the dependent files, so I'm excluding them for simplicity. 

I have attached the generated sources.  

[scalaxb-problem-sources.zip](https://github.com/eed3si9n/scalaxb/files/4040796/scalaxb-problem-sources.zip)


Other info
Scala 2.12.10
I've seen this on multiple machines, with multiple people in my organization. I think it may be related to the `dispatch` dependency.

Reproduce:

`$ sbt new eed3si9n/scalaxb.g8`

Then open the `sbt` prompt and type `compile` or `reload` or anything. The input is suppressed.

Field in XSD

`            <element name="X" type="integer" minOccurs="0"></element>
`
XML element:

`<a:X />`

Gives error while parsing:

`java.lang.NumberFormatException: Zero length BigInteger`
Fixes https://github.com/eed3si9n/scalaxb/issues/501

I'd like to suggest making the trait sealed by default. A sealed trait requires to have all the classes that it extends in the same file. Which is the case with `scalaxb`. Having a sealed trait makes it easier to spot errors because the compiler will drop warnings.
Hello,

We using `crossScalaVersions := Seq("2.11.8", "2.12.8")`.
When I `+compile`, clearly just one of the versions are generated.

Do I miss some special settings?


With big enums the generated fromString methods exceed the allowed method size and won't compile.
This PR splits the fromString method into multiple private methods with 500 lines each.

Could you help me please. I am using scalaxb v. 1.4.0. I use the attribute "maxLength" in my XSD, but string parameters ignore this attribute. How can i fix this?
Example: 
"
<xsd:simpleType>
<xsd:restriction base="xsd:string">
<xsd:maxLength value="128"/>
</xsd:restriction>
</xsd:simpleType>
"
Would be nice to be able to namespace runtime. Currently one needs to manually maintain compatibility between runtimes generated in different projects.
--no-runtime doesn't work very well as it still forces the project to have a single runtime version.
Hello,
We have a legacy JAXB project which converts XSDs to java classes. Recently we decided to migrate it on scala using scalaxb.
The XSD's are downloaded from below link under folder "4_ICH_ICSR_Schema_Files"

While running compile task I am getting below error
`Referenced type {urn:hl7-org:v3}CD was not found`
Kindly check to see if anything is missing in the configuration or what could be the issue.

My sbt configuration is

```
lazy val scalaXml = "org.scala-lang.modules" %% "scala-xml" % "1.0.6"
lazy val scalaParser = "org.scala-lang.modules" %% "scala-parser-combinators" % "1.0.6"
lazy val dispatchV = "0.12.0"
lazy val dispatch = "net.databinder.dispatch" %% "dispatch-core" % dispatchV

lazy val e2bSchema = (project in file(".")).
  enablePlugins(ScalaxbPlugin).
  settings(
    scalaxbPackageName in (Compile, scalaxb) := "generated",
    scalaxbDispatchVersion in (Compile, scalaxb) := dispatchV,
      scalaxbIgnoreUnknown in (Compile, scalaxb) := true,
      scalaxbAutoPackages in (Compile, scalaxb) := true,
      //scalaxbXsdSource  := file("src/main/xsd/E2BR3"),

      scalaxbPackageNames in (Compile, scalaxb)    := Map(

        uri("http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/") -> "coreschemas",
        uri("http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/") -> "multicacheschemas"),
    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(dispatch),
    libraryDependencies ++= {
      if (scalaVersion.value startsWith "2.10") Seq()
      else Seq(scalaXml, scalaParser)
    }

)
Compiling 

  ```https://difi.github.io/spike-elma/elma_wsdl.html```

give rise to a bunch of files. One of them (elma_type1.scala) is an empty package with no defintions containing only two lines:

```
// Generated by <a href="http://scalaxb.org/">scalaxb</a>.
package generated
```
and then the compilation ends with:
```
[error] Found names but no class, trait or object is defined in the compilation unit.
[error] The incremental compiler cannot record the dependency information in such case.
[error] Some errors like unused import referring to a non-existent class might not be reported.
[error]     
[error] // Generated by <a href="http://scalaxb.org/">scalaxb</a>.
[error] ^
