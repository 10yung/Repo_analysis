Hi,
I have used Snibox for a while and am always happy with it. Thanks.
But then today I installed Snibox on an ubuntu container (means no Docker version) and redirect outside traffic on port 443 to port 3000 of the container. If traffic from IPv4 client => redirect to container's IPv4 IP, works OK. If traffic from IPv6 client => redirect to container's IPv6 IP. But nothing listen on container's IPv6.

So I want to know if Snibox listens on IPv6 too, or I missed config something?

> ## 1.10.4 / 2019-08-11

> ### Security
> 
> #### Address CVE-2019-5477 ([#1915](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1915))
> 
> A command injection vulnerability in Nokogiri v1.10.3 and earlier allows commands to be executed in a subprocess by Ruby's `Kernel.open` method. Processes are vulnerable only if the undocumented method `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file` is being passed untrusted user input.
> 
> This vulnerability appears in code generated by the Rexical gem versions v1.0.6 and earlier. Rexical is used by Nokogiri to generate lexical scanner code for parsing CSS queries. The underlying vulnerability was addressed in Rexical v1.0.7 and Nokogiri upgraded to this version of Rexical in Nokogiri v1.10.4.
