Hi Fernando,
I am new to spike sorting and I would really appreciate if you could answer some questions that I have.

First of all, I want to sort the interictal spikes, which always last about 70ms, and most energy concentrate below 200Hz. The sampling_rate was 20000Hz, so each spike contains 1400 samples. I use the Do_clustering function following the step: 1. The spikes detected  and save in matlab variable (numbers*spike_length); 2. set index(time in ms), spikes(in uV), and save as 'someting_spikes.mat'; 3. run Do_clustering.  I can get some results,but I still confuse about them.

1. Do I need to do Get_spikes first ?
2. The raw each spike contains 1400 samples, do I need to do downsample function? How many samples should maintain in each spike is the best? Could you show me a rang?
3. I saw par.sort_fmin=300,par_sort_fmax=3000, is it suit for my sorting?
4. When each spike contains more samples, the inspk is larger. Dose it mean more coeffecients were chose to do separation? And how can I get the same picture as on wave_clus when I choose the 'spike features'?
5. Do I need to change other parameters?

Thank you very much.
I encountered this error when loading data:

Hi, I'm using Wave_Clus GUI to sort spikes of one channel data from microwire array recording of rat cortex. It generates first figure here: 
![2_fig2print_Ch16_GUI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17386229/63384618-e6c2ed80-c3a7-11e9-8c50-4c5820e17754.png)

For the same raw data, I run batch codes:
Get_spikes([dataPath '.mat']);
Do_clustering(['Ch16_spikes.mat']);
An it generates this:
![2_fig2print_Ch16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17386229/63384809-51742900-c3a8-11e9-960c-e4a2ac6d329d.png)

After a while, when I run the same batch codes, it keeps generating same one cluster result!
![fig2print_Ch16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17386229/63384870-710b5180-c3a8-11e9-903e-ec767355f4ab.png)

I use same parameters for these three cases.
I increased maxtemp = 0.5 to see if clusters were really unseperatable.
Other changed SPC parameters like this : stdmin = 4; stdmax = 15;
I know SPC is stochastic but at least I need to eliminate some noise ! (Cluster 0)
It seems it stucks within the same close-to-begining-temperature value (0.01)!
Can I at least force it to seperate 2-3 clusters ?
Changing max_clus to 2 or 3 does not work!

Could you please let me know if I can extract the detection threshold from already sorted data.
Thanks!
Todor

Firstly, thanks for providing this great toolbox!!!

I have some problem on the begining stage.Sorry I am new guy in this field so maybe I asked many silly questions. Any help will be appreciated! I tried to modify par.stdmin according to the original problem, but there was still an error, the error is as follows:

Wave_clus didn't find a sampling rate in file. It will use the set in set_parameters.m
Error using wave_clus>load_data_button_Callback (line 230)

    gui_mainfcn(gui_State, varargin{:});

In addition, I also found that the parameter of wave_clus data_handler.max_segments is 0.

I got the error below for a seemingly normal file

```
SPC v2.1 (14/2/2000) -- efficient KNN and mstree                     
SPC v2.0.1 (1/12/2000) -- StopRunAtBreak option                      
SPC v2.0 (1/11/1999) -- new param file + revised data structures     
-------------------------------------------------------------------

error:
at line 233 of 'param.c': N<=0
```

I ran this in a large loop with many similar files, yet this is the only one which yielded this result. even among files collecting immediately before and after this one. a little digging around shows that at the top of the 'run_cluster' code, when the tmp file is loaded, 
```
dat = load(par.fname_in); %Don't add path here, it needs to be added before.
n = length(dat);
fid = fopen(sprintf('%s.run',[par.file_path filesep fname]),'wt');
```
dat comes up 0*0, empty. despire the fact the _spikes file has spikes in it. Any thoughts?
Hi,
I just started to use Wave_Clus because I am interested in doing spike sorting on my data. In particular, my signals have been acquired in vivo using a probe inserted into the rat somatosensory cortex being anesthetized using urethane. The sampling frequency is 25 kHz.
I have two concerns. Firstly, I noticed that I always get a Cluster 0 containing a high number of 'not-assigned' spikes, even though those spikes have amplitude and shape highly similar to other spikes that, instead, got assigned to a specific cluster. In the following figure ('Ch_01'), I show you an examplel with a zoom on the electrophysiological trace. There are 4 spikes, two assigned to the red cluster (Cluster 2) and two assigned to the black cluster (Cluster 0). To me, it looks like they should belong to the same cluster so I wonder if this could be a matter of shape signal or of tuning of specific parameters (even if I already tried to play with SPC parameters such as min_clus). Do you have any suggestion about this point?
![Ch_01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52494548/60591393-ad560480-9d9e-11e9-9b54-3929c624900e.jpg)
Secondly, there are several cases in which I have a sustained activity where no isolated spikes are present (see figure below - 'Ch_12') and the activity is bursting with spikes very close to each other. In this case, just one cluster is detected even though there are events characterized by very different shape and amplitude. Again I tried to play a little bit with parameters' value but without any improvement.
![Ch_12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52494548/60592745-8e0ca680-9da1-11e9-9456-f26fa2e987f4.jpg)
Any help and/or suggestion would be very appreciated.
If you need other images or material to better document the issues, please ask.
Best,
Marta


Hi,

I ran batch mode with the default parameters for my silicon probe data. But the results weren't satisfactory; in particular, for one channel, which has a unit with a great signal-to-noise ratio, ideal for manual spike sorting, Wave_clus somehow ignored the largest and clean unit entirely.

This is the result of Wave_clus automatic spike sorting shown in Spike2. The large amplitude unit in the bottom channel is completely missing in the top channel for sorted units; only much smaller ones were counted.

![Image012](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6400352/60351976-cafe2500-99be-11e9-8939-df763768c4aa.png)


Now I'm trying to get better results by using GUI and changing parameters. But so far I haven't managed to see the large unit as a cluster in the GUI. Maybe I'm overlooking some very basic parameters. My best bet was `par.stdmax`, but even with 20-times bigger value, the large unit was still ignored.

```
par.stdmax = 1000;                     % maximum threshold for detection                                                                     
```

Can someone give me an advice?

Best,
Kouichi
Hi Wave_Clus team!

We wanted to ask you if you can implement Wave_Clus in the SpikeInterface project (https://github.com/SpikeInterface), which is the engine behind SpikeForest.

With @magland we are merging the SpikeForest and SpikeInterface implementation, so that SpikeForest will call the SpikeInterface sorter wrappers, which will only be maintained in one place.

The sorter wrappers are in this repo: https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikesorters and I made an issue for the Wave_Clus implementation where we can discuss the details (https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikesorters/issues/13).

Please let us know how we can help for the implementation. There should be plenty of examples among the other implemented wrappers. The matlab ones are kilosort, kilosort2, and ironclust.

Cheers
Alessio & the SpikeInterface Team
