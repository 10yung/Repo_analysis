Hi is it possible to integrate with redux and redux-form as that is how the rest of my site is built and i would require it to work with it
Hello,
As far as i see, the payment lib is used only for checking card type. This is done with a simple array in this lib (https://github.com/jessepollak/payment/blob/master/src/index.coffee#L5-L102). What do you think about integrating this inside `react-credit-card' ?

This would avoid the cost of QJ and payment. Currently those libs are bundled and almost not used ... tree shaking is impossible with those coffee generated files.

Cheers

Thanks for developing such a great tool. It's super useful. However, there are several other card types that are not fully supported. Can you add some more card type? or can you make a general card which is used for valid but not yet supported card.

Visa
MasterCard
American Express
Diners Club
Discover
JCB
UnionPay
Maestro
The functionality to allow setting of which cards can be used already exists in Payment.js, see this commit https://github.com/jessepollak/payment/commit/d9ddf82ec82016977712f9ace21d92df25c8d111. Can we please get this exposed?
Hi! First of all, really nice component üëç 

I just npm installed it and the two mentioned css dependency files are not located inside `build/` folder as stated on [README.md](https://github.com/JohnyDays/react-credit-card#how-to-install), but i could import them anyway because they are located at `source/` folder.

I guess that is not correct, because `source/` folder contain uncompressed files.

Any API or suggestions for setting the size of the credit card? In my case I'd like it to be able to shrink to fit inside a certain div.

I think VISA credit card is of type ***\* ***\* ***\* ***\*  (16 digit)

But Amex card has to be ***\* *****\* ****\*  (15 digit)

I would love to setup what placeholder I want to show through component properties

Hi there,

First of all I really like your react component and use it for my projects.
But I found an issue with it.
By default the credit card image looks like this:

Then when I type an existing card (e.g. Visa) the image changes to the following

Then if I remove credit card number so that it will be come unknown again please note a broken image of the credit card type in the top right corner.
