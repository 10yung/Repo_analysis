HI!
Does it work on an MSSql adapter?

How do I enable MSSQL database adapter support? The manual does not mention this. Is it even possible?
HI

I have been trying to install pluins from the Redmine plugins site but man I am having so much hard time with this, because whatever I try ends up borking the container with gem fails etc. So I am guessing that I am constantly hitting plugins that are not meant to be for v4.

I am wondering if we can make a good listing of working plugins for v4 under this topic.  So that we save time not waste time with trying to install unintallable plugins.


thanks
Related to https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineReminderEmails I wish, reminder functionality would be implemented. Hopefully it isn't a big deal :)
Hi together,

just recently I bought myself a Synology DS218+ NAS and found that it directly supports to install and run redmine from its Package Center. Since this redmine version is not the latest one I came across sameersbn/redmine on dockerhub. I tried to download and install it from the Synology docker GUI but after startup it gives me an database connection error. I've downloaded MariaDB and setup a database along with a user (equipped with the required right) and connected it to docker using the DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS and so on. Is there anything else I have to do in order to run it?
When using docker with a container orchestrator (kubernetes, in my case), most logging infrastructures will expect your containers to send their logs through STDOUT/STDERR.

In this image, we miss most interesting logs (typically, access logs) because they go directly to files. Moreover, the location where they go is a volume, which makes it way harder to symlink the logfiles to another location (such as `/dev/stdout` or `/proc/1/fd/1`).

It would be really convenient to have an environment variable that would allow all logs to be sent to STDOUT.
Upgrading from redmine:3.4.7 to redmine:4.0.0 causes unicorn to exit repeatedly.  This is due to the upgrade from ruby 3.3 to 3.4.  The files in /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/tmp/ need to be removed.

in redmine instruction page, sqlite can be used as the database, do we have any plan adding support for SQLite3?
