if u want to customize the bage size, set the badgeMinWidth property to a nonzero value, if u want to use the default size, just not set any value to the badgeMinWidth property.

thanks your project!,we use it in our project,we add tiny mode and backgroudimage for the JSBadgeView, also make some propriety can modify by user. Could you consider add it to your master branch?

Please center the Text inside the badge.
At least in iOS7 it is displayed wrong
