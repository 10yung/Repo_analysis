We received this feedback by email. CodeMirror uses it to delete lines but it is not cool: https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/blob/1cbf1f64001b36dc7115f6a36c0f919f59c434fa/lib/codemirror.js#L2889.

We can disable this one at least.
Hey,

Thanks for that awesome project. I am just starting to get to know it but I already like it. 

I have one question though: how can I host monod on a Subdomain on my server? I have forwarded traffic from example.com/monod/ to localhost:12345 and I get most of the page, but the log says it does not find some parts, since it is using the path without the Subdomain. Am I missing something?

Thanks for your time!
The idea of this PR is to add a name to Monod documents so that we can avoid to give them a name when bookmarking them, and also it should be ["unfurled"](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-unfurling-but-were-afraid-to-ask-or-how-to-make-your-e64b4bb9254#.wmnm2lo1k) in Slack. That would be a huge improvement while searching info within Slack.

## TODO

- [x] Basic feature
- [ ] Make it work in Slack
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Refactor document update (maybe in a separate PR)
Hey, do you think you still need to use custom version of `offline-plugin`?

The Xorg selection mechanism is currently broken with monod: when a middle-click occurs, the caret is moved at the cursor position and nothing more happens (same as a left click).

I would expect the current X selection to be pasted at the cursor location, and the caret not to move.

Tested on FreeBSD with Firefox 50.1.0.
## Purpose

Keep track of all the documents edited by a particular user.

## Proposal

A separate tab like [hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io), with a link to each document opened.

![history](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/472083/21274096/6c805f4e-c3be-11e6-8d72-f34278beec1e.png)

## When
When designing a large table with many columns.

## Outcome
The PDF export through CTRL+P doesn't respect the document scale and tables are cut off at the right margin.
A scroll bar appears but of course cannot be used in the PDF.

![print_pdf](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/472083/21273594/39db00e6-c3bc-11e6-97f0-89a5e38f6738.png)

The table is **scaled properly in the live rendering**.

![rendering](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/472083/21273598/41c1f288-c3bc-11e6-9bed-8aa19c5c445d.png)

This is **not the case for plain text** where too long lines are properly wrapped.

## Environment

- Linux Debian stretch
- Chromium  53.0.2785.143
- Monod version ff0b2d9
- Template: no template
## When
When **reducing one of the panel** to go from a split view of the code and rendered document to a single panel (or the other way around), the cursor is not at the correct position.

## Outcome
Clicking in the text to position the cursor will end up writing on the line below / above
This only appears until some text is typed in.
The cursor can then be moved to a correct location by clicking in the text again.

## Environment

- Linux Debian stretch
- Chromium  53.0.2785.143
- Monod version ff0b2d9
- Template: no template
For the last few months, I've been using a monod document to keep my daily journal.  Today, I tried to load it up and was told "We were unable to decrypt the document. Either the secret has not been supplied or it is invalid. We have redirected you to a new document."

The link I was using was a link that did include the secret, that I have inside another monod document, and it has worked consistently in the past.  When it failed, I searched through my browser history to find the link as I used it in the past.  It failed in the same way.   I am now unable to access my journal, which is pretty distressing.

All of the links to other monod documents that I have tried continue to work.

The document is https://monod.lelab.tailordev.fr/56dc0203-5ef0-45ce-a122-75351d5de4e0#{I removed the secret since I'm posting to a public github issue}
