I went to LI's opensource page. I liked the description of this project. But .. five years ..?

Although creating immutable objects is frequently better than creating mutable ones, creating immutable objects frequently is not as virtuous.

We use HashFunctions.fnv(Array[Byte]) (norbert code) for hash partitioning the graph data.
We serialize NodeId to a byte array, then this function scans the bytes and calculate the hash value.
HashFunctions.fnv is recursively defined. It takes one byte (key.head) to compute a intermediate value and creates a new array (key.drop(1)) of rest of the data and call recursively until all data are processed. It means we create an array per byte. Too expensive.
We can simply use a while-loop with the array index as the loop variable.

Hi My Name is Yosef, and i'm trying to work with norbert:
As a test i'm running the NorbertJavaNetworkClientMain and NorbertJavaNetworkServerMain 
I have a problem when i send a message from the Client to the server - in the zookeeper i;m getting the exception:
<B>
java.io.IOException: Unreasonable length = 1701999662
        at org.apache.jute.BinaryInputArchive.readBuffer(BinaryInputArchive.java:100)
        at org.apache.zookeeper.proto.ConnectRequest.deserialize(ConnectRequest.java:89)
        at org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxn.readConnectRequest(NIOServerCnxn.java:733)
        at org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxn.readPayload(NIOServerCnxn.java:485)
        at org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxn.doIO(NIOServerCnxn.java:521)
        at org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxn$Factory.run(NIOServerCnxn.java:262)<B>

And the server code never reach the message function handler

can you help?

Thanks,
Yosef

Hi,

I started an effort to publish all sna-projects artifacts to the public repo under common artifactId: com.sna-projects. Similar to norbert, kamikaze, bobo, zoie and sensei will be published in the same manner.

Please pull.

Chris,

These changes fix memory leaks in norbert and a build error with specs. You'll want to pull them into your repo sooner or later.

I am trying to use this library for a demo how we can use Zookeeper for load balancing, and came across this library.  It will be great if you can include some load balancing examples. For example, if I have a service deployed on multiple servers, how would I use this library to distribute loads?

There's RoundRobinLoadBalancerFactory that I tried, but don't know how I can make my services which are deployed on different machines to be managed by the balancer.
