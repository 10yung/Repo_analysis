No idea which blog causes it.
This is very useful for recognizing the blogs that are dead and no longer post content, so they can be safely removed. If the scan is limited and no new content within the limited span (days, pages) show No New Content instead. Right now there's no way to get that information. 
TumblThree is wonderful! I'm having good luck with it, except when it simply stops crawling.

I've simplified my configuration all the way down to crawling only one blog at a time, and it is often successful, even when downloading tens of thousands of files.

Occasionally, however, it just stops, and the message in the queue is sometimes that it was Downloading and sometimes that it was Skipping a file.

My settings are Concurrent Connections = 90, Concurrent Video = 10, Concurrent blogs = 1, Timeout = 60, Scan connections = 4, Limiting API to 55 connections per 60 seconds.

In the Settings file, MaxNumberOfRetries = 1.

I'm downloading everything, saving metadata as JSON, 50 posts per page, Downloading specified size (1280x1080) even if it isn't offered, and Dumping crawler data.

My internet access is speedy and reliable, I have RAM to spare, and I'm saving to an SMB share, for what it's worth.

When TumblThree stops crawling, the application hasn't frozen; if I click Stop, it stops and cleans up duplicates.

Any thoughts on how I can troubleshoot this? Or a settings change that might help?

Edit 1: Also, it _may_ be the case that this only happens near or at the completion of a blog; the last three times I ran into this, the Downloaded Files value was at least 99% of the of Number of Downloads.

Edit 2: I just saw it happen at the 80% mark, so that goes against my previous edit. Also, I'll mention that clicking Pause and then Resume has no effect.
My installation of latest TumblThree version doesn't save its settings or changes I make to Settings.

I have to manually edit the Settings.json file which is no big deal. However how can I save my account and password inside it, can I use direct strings or do I need to convert my password to some encrypted format and add it that way? Please help me.

Thanks in advance!

Since january 3rd, TumblThree is no longer able to find any data from flagged as explicit posts, it looks like these posts don't exist anymore. The total number of posts appearing in [number of downloads] column before crawling is correct, but these posts are missing, no infos neither in images, images_url or texts files after backup. Please, do you know a solution? Thank you for your help.

I'm not sure what tooling exists for this and keeping any discussions and stuff in place, but that could be advantageous.

Also it prevents crawler from being stopped and application won't exit. (UI is destroyed but rest of process is still running)
