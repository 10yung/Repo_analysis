Hello! When i try to load any scatch with this library i got an "avr-g++: error: createprocess: no such file or directory" error. Other scatches compiles normaly.
Currently, my device is detected as the following:
![72636362-2d207680-395f-11ea-8a77-6ea287627973](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16866223/72638505-d8cbc580-3963-11ea-9d2a-4b0fa31837f0.png)
In “Devices & Printers” (middle section), it shows up as “Unspecified”, but on the right it's listed as an "Input device".

How can I change it to be detected however I want?

Here's the relevant code:
```
#include <Arduino.h>
#include "HID-Project.h"

uint8_t rawhidData[255];

void setup()
{
    RawHID.begin(rawhidData, sizeof(rawhidData));
}

void loop()
{
    delay(2000);
    // Create buffer with numbers and send it
    uint8_t megabuff[100];
    for (uint8_t i = 0; i < sizeof(megabuff); i++)
    {
        megabuff[i] = i;
    }
    RawHID.write(megabuff, sizeof(megabuff));
}
```

With `HID().AppendDescriptor(&node);` I can specify a custom one, but how do I do that using RAWHID?
Hi mates, I need to create a "video controller" console and I would take advance of this project, does it supports encoder? Is the encoder classified as a default pheriperal for HID devices?
Thank you a lot
I'm having issues creating code to type a hot key Ctrl + Alt + m. I'm using keyboard testing software and it is only detecting the Ctrl and Alt key being pressed. the M key is completely ignored. 
I have this so far
`Keyboard.press(KEY_LEFT_CTRL);`
`Keyboard.press(KEY_LEFT_ALT);`
`Keyboard.press('m');`
`delay(100);`
`Keyboard.releaseAll();`

If I remove `Keyboard.press(KEY_LEFT_CTRL);` or `Keyboard.press(KEY_LEFT_ALT);` then it will type Ctrl + m / Alt + m respectively

If I change the alpha key to `p` or `a` or `b` or `c` (I havn't tested the whole alphabet) then it will work. 

In summary, I can't get Ctrl + Alt + m to work but Ctrl + m, Alt + m, and Ctrl + Alt +p do...



There are some basic HID versions working with low energy Bluetooth using the ESP32 but none is close to having the broad functionality yours has.

Hi. 
I am trying to write a sketch controlling an android device. Right-clicking an ordinary mouse generates a back event. But AbsoluteMouse.click(MOUSE_RIGHT); not working for me. Also, I was not able to find a key combination or key code for the events "Back" and "Home". Could you please help me?

PS. It seems that the "Back" event can be obtained using Win + Backspace, but I still did not understand how to get it.
Hello,

I'm working on using an Arduino to report a UPS is attached when using an external battery pack with my computer.  Is there any support for the UPS HID profile in this library?  If not, any thoughts that could point me in the right direction?

Thanks in advance!
Hi, I was wondering if anyone has tried to use this library with a blue chip (STM32F103C8T6) and had any success?
I am trying now and I received a HID.h file missing error.
I am trying to get the gamepad code working on a SAMD21 board and am having no joy. The code compiles and uploads fine, the board is identified in the windows usb controller setup but I get no data from the board. The same code works fine on a Leonardo. Also the keyboard and mouse examples both work fine on the SAMD21 just not the gamepad. I have tried multiple SAMD21 based boards and several computers with the same result.
