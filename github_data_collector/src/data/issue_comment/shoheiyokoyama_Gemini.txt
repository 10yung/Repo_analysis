Is there a way to programmatically set the scroll direction of the GeminiCollectionView?
I'm using to following code to set the flow layout in example project's scale up horizontal animation. The result of this setting is only shows about 40px width of previous item, and the next item is invisible while paging animation is done.

`        // Setting of UICollectionViewFlowLayout
        let layout = UICollectionViewPagingFlowLayout()
        layout.scrollDirection = scrollDirection
        layout.itemSize = CGSize(width: view.bounds.width - 120, height: view.bounds.height - 400)
        layout.sectionInset = UIEdgeInsets(top: 200, left: 80, bottom: 200, right: 40)
        layout.minimumLineSpacing = 10
        layout.minimumInteritemSpacing = 10
        collectionView.collectionViewLayout = layout
        collectionView.decelerationRate = UIScrollViewDecelerationRateFast`

However, if I trying to implement an action which scroll to the previous item when user click on the previous item. I'm using the following codes. The result comes out is the previous cell moved to center, and the next/last cell are displayed on right/left with 20px width respectively. 

`       func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, didSelectItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
        collectionView.scrollToItem(at: indexPath, at: .centeredHorizontally, animated: true)
    }`

How to do the programatic scrolling which can be same of the animation that performed by paging scrolling?
I have used Gemini cube effect in my scrollview image cell. After zooming  image when I try to swipe image it is lagging. it is working fine in UICollectionViewCell 
I can't use it with objective-c projects.
func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, didSelectItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) 

It is not getting called.
Hi.
Thanks for this awesome framework.
I implemented Gemini using Carthage.
I get this error at run time:
Unknown class _TtC720GeminiCollectionView in Interface Builder file.

On first line of this code:
```
        collectionView.gemini
            .circleRotationAnimation()
            .radius(400)
            .rotateDirection(.clockwise)
    }
```

At line 191 in GeminiAnimationModel.swift, The Method for backgorundColor has Swift Compiler Error.
The Error Message is as follows.
Message: Expression was too complex to be solved in reasonable time; consider breaking up the expression into distinct sub-expressions
It is possible to loop the rotation in order that at the end of the last cell it loops back to the first?
