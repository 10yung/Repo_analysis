Hi, you have get the camera orientation and location in world coordinate. Which are actrually relative orientation and location between frame t and frame t-1  .
So you have used 
pos = pos + Rpos*tr';
Rpos = R * Rpos;
to get orientation and location in global relative to the original pos. But it dosn't show me a correct trajectory.

Can I use the R and tr as relative pos, which can be added to posegraph3D ?
Like hier
relativePose = [tr,rotm2quat(R)];
addRelativePose(posegraph3D ,relativePos, informationmatrix);  
And then do some further loopclosure.
Are you familiar with the posegraph3D? Can i directly use the R and t to construct relative camera pose? 

I also need to get poses in form of [x y z qw qx qy qz] to build an occupancy map. What should I do to the R and tr. I really get confused for a long time.  

Could you please explain it to me? Thank you very much.
