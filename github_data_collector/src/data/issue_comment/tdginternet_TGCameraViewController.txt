Hi, I'm able to use original aspect to capture the full image as you can see in the code below. However, it doesn't apply to photo gallery when I click on it to select a picture from the gallery. As you can see in the screenshot below, the image from photo gallery still appears to be a square. How can I fix this? Really appreciate any input. 

` @IBAction func takePhotoTapped(_ sender: AnyObject) {
        let navigationController = TGCameraNavigationController.new(with: self)
        TGCamera.setOption("kTGCameraOptionUseOriginalAspect", value: true) 
        self.present(navigationController!, animated: true, completion: nil)
}`

Hi, I'm using TGCameraViewController cocoapod for my project. It works fine for the most part but sometimes black screen comes up when I click on camera button. I know a similar issue related to black screen was reported before and the suggested solution was to copy all resources. I checked my project and it already includes everything from the resources folder i.e. TGCameraViewController.bundle. Any idea how to fix this? Thank you!

I copied over the files to my project and tried to compile and I get errors related to this file:

TGCameraFunctions.m

any help is much appreciated.
