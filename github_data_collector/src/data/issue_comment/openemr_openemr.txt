try creating a database before install and choosing the appropriate option in setup before proceeding to credentials screen

the button shouldn't say create db and user since you've already set those up
be nice to get the calendar widget to float down the side as you scroll to later appointments in the day

also the date and other button bar at the top could come along for the ride too :railway_track: 
Two folders “acl”, “sql” and the file version.php were added to the main folder of the module. In the "acl" folder there is a file for the initial installation of tables and data for the module, as well as update files, as in "openemr". Similarly for "acl" permissions. For the first installation or upgrade, go to Modules -> Manage Modules for the module in which there are necessary folders, as well as the version.php file which indicates the initial version of the module for the database and asl rights.

This feature is optional. Also, to demonstrate this feature, I used the "PatentFilterEventHooktest" module as an example.
Since I had some spare time on my hands I decided to update ZendFramework to Laminas as ZendFramework is now officially abandoned. There are no API changes so all I had to do was refactor all of it and that was done in this commit.

I did not rename any functions or documentation and only redid the imports so if someone can do that for me while I work on the other project that would be great. Also dunno if I messed up the composer lock file in the process but I ran 'composer update' to fix the lock file

BS4 based.
Still tweaking Care Plan Sets.
Terminology for end-user is completely different: it should be intuitive for practices to deploy out of the box (famous last words).
Needs review.
Needs CSRF stuff.
Needs Patient Reminders integration.
Needs review to ensure MU2 reporting remains intact.

### I have installed it using the installation instructions of linux, but after installation when I try to login, then it shows always invalid username or password, but i am using the correct one. Please help to fix this, i don't know php otherwise i will try to fix the source code.
Waiting on Weno technical support to get back to me. We need to clear up why the message is failing to validate.

Up For Grabs demo pending when get twig updates in:
EXPEDITED:
Due date 1/1/20 (and needs to be in a 5.0.2 by then also). Note 5.0.2 does not have twig, but will not be difficult converting it to non-twig for 5.0.2 since it is only using twig in 1 script.(@bradymiller will work on getting into 5.0.2 patch when this feature is working and in main codebase)

Hi.

During work with the API we've found that the services of the data working with a limited amount of values, for example, ProviderService contains only 5 fields from the database (id, fname, mname,lname,username) there are a lot of other fields with info about user why we not return all of them?

Especially, the problem is with PatientService, the LBF enables to add custom files about patient dynamically, every customer can decide which fields be in "patient_data" table... why not fetching the data using `select * from` ?

If we want API will be available and helpful for new developers, I think it's important to return the maximum information as it possible (except security values). 

I'll be happy to hear your opinion about this issue.

Thank you.

Hi, adding the command 'composer install' broke the ci pipeline.
the php_codesniffer process generates multiple unexpected errors, it scans the vendor folder, and this is a strange behavior (vendor folder is marked as 'excluded') in phpcs.xml and phpcs_strict.xml.

[Here](https://github.com/zerai/openemr/blob/travis-issue/.travis.yml) my travis file.
[Here](https://travis-ci.org/zerai/openemr/builds/624849543) can see travis result.
