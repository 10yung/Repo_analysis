Hi,

I rewrote parts of CodePilot so it works with Xcode 9. It's available here: https://github.com/antmd/CodePilot/blob/master/README.md

It still needs some work to get all of the symbol functionality back to the original, but I haven't much time. It should be quite easy, now the approach for Xcode 9 is clear in the new code.

My main use case is the new 'switcher' function I added.

Do you think I should attempt a pull request, or rename the repo to something else (but still provide a link to this version)?

Best Regards

When the Main.storyboard (e.g. default, initial storyboard) shows up in the search results, it appears as a yellow folder and I can't open it directly. However, I can open other storyboards I've created this way (i.e. type "Ano.." for Another.storyboard, and then select it).

The Main.storyboard shows up correctly as a storyboard in the recent files list however. It's just when typing/searching that it appears as a yellow folder.

This is on the latest Xcode and OS, but I've had this issue for a long time on many versions of Xcode and many projects.

Thanks!

It seems that CodePilot doesn't render correctly on retina screens. The logo and others icons are blurry. Is this a known issue?

One of the great features of Xcode's "Open Quickly" is the option to choose where exactly to open the selected file, by showing the . This way, I can choose if I want to open in the Standard editor, in the Assistant editor, in a new tab, or in a new Xcode window.

"From the docs: For Option-Shift navigation (Option-Shift-click or Option-Shift-choose a file), Xcode displays a graphical navigation chooser showing the current layout. The chooser prompts you to open the file in any open editor pane in any window and tab, or to open the file in a new editor pane, window, or tab."

Is it possible we can see this feature coming in CodePilot?

I found my CPU usage was pegged at about 110% and the fan was going constantly, so I removed the plugin, which resolved the problem. Is there anything I can send you to help debug this?

There is a large delay between typing something and the results appearing and allowing the user to hit enter and proceed.

For myself, this causes me to press enter before the results have appeared when I'm using a search result I know will get me where I want.

Changing `DEFAULTS_SEARCH_INTERVAL_KEY` to a smaller float fixes the delay as expected but causes significant lag in the UI & action response.

I'd like to spend some time in instruments and see if I can figure out ways to improve this. This ticket will also allow open discussion of areas in need of improvement.
