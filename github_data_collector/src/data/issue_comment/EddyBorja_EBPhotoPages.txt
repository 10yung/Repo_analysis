how to show arrow dynamically but it shows only up words
its urgent thanks in andvance
I created a global class called `EBConfig` that allows developers to change different features of the user interface easily e.g font, font color, date formatting etc.

I also added a feature to load the comment avatars from a` NSURL` opposed to a `UIImage` incase there is networking involved. Feel free to change anything, I just had to change a few things to work for my project.
Hey @EddyBorja, are you still maintaining this control? I would like to use it, but I see lot's of things you use here were deprecated and that's kind of a show stopper to me... Any idea if you'll be able to keep working in this? If not I think it might be a good idea to find someone to transfer the project to :)

My app just got rejected with this message:

> Your app uses or references the following non-public APIs:
> 
> commentText

Searching my project for this string showed only the classes in your library. This is obviously a false positive from Apple since I used this library for the last couple of months and updated my app with no problems what so ever. You might want to rename the "commentText" method in EBPhotoCommentProtocol and the selectors that reference this method

I want to display videos from my webservices and that to in vertical scrolling, is that possible using this library?

Haven't remove commentsBarButtonItem from mutableLowerItems while checking commentsAreViewable.
Please refer to the last line at source code below from EBPhotoPagesController.m

solution:
change     [mutableUpperItems removeObject:self.commentsBarButtonItem];
to              [mutableLowerItems removeObject:self.commentsBarButtonItem];
- (void)updateToolbarsWithPhotoAtIndex:(NSInteger)index
  {
  NSArray *upperItems = [self.photoPagesFactory
                         upperToolbarItemsForPhotoPagesController:self
                         inState:self.currentState];
  
  NSArray *lowerItems = [self.photoPagesFactory
                         lowerToolbarItemsForPhotoPagesController:self
                         inState:self.currentState];
  
  NSMutableArray *mutableUpperItems = [NSMutableArray arrayWithArray:upperItems];
  NSMutableArray *mutableLowerItems = [NSMutableArray arrayWithArray:lowerItems];
  
  BOOL taggingAllowed = [self.photosDataSource respondsToSelector:@selector(photoPagesController:shouldAllowTaggingForPhotoAtIndex:)] ?
  [self.photosDataSource photoPagesController:self
            shouldAllowTaggingForPhotoAtIndex:index] : YES;
  
  BOOL activitiesAllowed = [self.photosDataSource respondsToSelector:@selector(photoPagesController:shouldAllowActivitiesForPhotoAtIndex:)] ?
  [self.photosDataSource photoPagesController:self
         shouldAllowActivitiesForPhotoAtIndex:index] : YES;
  
  BOOL commentsAreViewable = [self.photosDataSource respondsToSelector:@selector(photoPagesController:shouldShowCommentsForPhotoAtIndex:)] ?
  [self.photosDataSource photoPagesController:self
            shouldShowCommentsForPhotoAtIndex:index] : YES;
  
  if([self.photosDataSource photoPagesController:self shouldExpectPhotoAtIndex:index] == NO){
      taggingAllowed = NO;
      activitiesAllowed = NO;
      commentsAreViewable = NO;
  }
  
  if(taggingAllowed == NO){
      [mutableUpperItems removeObject:self.tagBarButtonItem];
      [mutableLowerItems removeObject:self.tagBarButtonItem];
  }
  
  if(activitiesAllowed == NO){
      [mutableUpperItems removeObject:self.activityBarButtonItem];
      [mutableLowerItems removeObject:self.activityBarButtonItem];
  }
  
  if(commentsAreViewable == NO){
      [mutableUpperItems removeObject:self.commentsBarButtonItem];
      [mutableUpperItems removeObject:self.commentsBarButtonItem];
  }

Wonderfull library, thank you for your effort. I found this method and "attributedCaptionForPhotoAtIndex" and try to used. It's very good for using with HTML attributes like <b>. But when I try to use with <a href="https://github.com">Click this...</a> it's not able handle open URL. I checked that part of code and see that using UILabel with setAttributedText. 

Is there any plan to adding this functionality for library in near future?

Hi i'm use loading images from URL it's posible use in this library? 

Hi,
I used EBPhotoPage in my project.Now i'm set all images and get pinch and zoom.But my requirement is no need to show bottom tool bar.I just shown images with their details only.So can handle that functionality.

Thanks,
Sudalaiyandi

hey guys shouldn't you call super in both viewWillAppear and viewWillDisapper ?
