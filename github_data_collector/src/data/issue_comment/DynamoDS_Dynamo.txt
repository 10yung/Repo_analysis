### Purpose

JIRA: https://jira.autodesk.com/browse/DYN-2289
GH Issue: https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/issues/9227

This fix prevents a crash when converting nodes to code in which at least one upstream node is a CBN that has static property invocations such as:
```
p = Point.ByCoordinates(0, 0, 0);
x = Point.X(p);
```
The reason for the crash was that the property was not found in the procedure table for the class. Since property getters internally compile to `get_propertyname(object)`, a method has been added that additionally checks for a static getter that accepts one argument (namely the class object), which in this example would be searching explicitly for `get_X(p)` instead of just `X`.

# Issue Description
Please fill in the following information to help us reproduce the issue:

### What did you do?
Tried to translate a mesh

### What did you expect to see?
A mesh that has been translated

### What did you see instead?
The following error:
Warning: Geometry.Translate expects argument type(s) (Geometry, double, double, double), but was called with (Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry.Mesh, int, int, int).

Which is ironic because it clearly states that Mesh is a subclass of Geometry and yet a method that applies to the parent class cannot apply to the child class. It violates all rules of object oriented programming.

### What packages or external references (if any) were used?
None


### Stack Trace
```
This was not a crash. Just a limitation of Dynamo

```

If this issue is **not** a bug report or improvement request, please check the [Dynamo forum](https://forum.dynamobim.com/), and start a thread there to discuss your issue.

## Dynamo version
2.3.0

## Operating system
Win 10
(e.g. Windows 7, Windows 8.1, etc)

## What did you do? 
1. Open new Dynamo file
2. Place Python node and open
3. Place any custom node(tested with springs.WatchDialog last)
4. Open custom node while python editor is still open
5. Able to press Run while in .dyf of custom node
6. Crash
(Fill in here)

## What did you expect to see?
I don't know if this has been reported before, couldn't find it. Would have been great if the Run button was greyed out maybe while in the dyf.


## What did you see instead?
Crash

Steps 1 and 2 of [Add Icons for a Zero Touch Assembly or NodeModel assembly](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Add-Icons-for-a-Zero-Touch-Assembly-or-NodeModel-assembly) are likely in the wrong order as later on in step 8 the `.resx` file appears to be within the `Resources` directory?

```
$(ProjectDir)\Resources\SampleLibraryZeroTouchImages.resx
```

It may also be worth adding a note that the `\` after `$(ProjectDir)` may not be necessary depending on your setup.
