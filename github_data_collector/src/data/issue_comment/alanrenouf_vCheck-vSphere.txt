Is there output or a switch i can enable to see why the email does not get sent ? I checked both our layers of filtering and the email is no where to be found at all. 

Please advise,

Thank you
A new major release (v7) should be targetted.
This should include:

- closing open issues
  - bug fixes
  - feature requests
- consolidate all pending PRs
- ??? 




I'm new to GitHub, I hope this is ment for asking questions and (maybe) getting answers.

I upgraded two of my four vSphere clusters from 6.7.0 11727113 to 6.7.0 14368073.
The one with essential license (3 ESXi) still works to run vCheck but the schedule now takes 10 minutes instead of 1 minute. 

The cluster with vCenter Standard contains 32 ESXi and before upgrade the report was executing around 15-20 minutes before done. 
After that the time increased with the number of upgraded ESXi.
When all 32 ESXi was upgraded (7 days) the report is taking days to finnish.

The step with most issue is General Information that in the last completed report executed in  2687 minutes of report completed time for 2843 Minutes, 

Any ideas how to troubleshoot or debug?

Filter for just one Cluster

Good morning, how could I filter the report for a single in Cluster of the Vcenter since I have a Vcenter and has more than 50 Cluster which makes the report an extensive one and cannot be validated quickly.

Thank you so much!
Hello,

I have upgraded my VCSA to 6.7 version and now unable to get the health check report for the upgraded vCenter servers.

Is there any additional changes do we need to do to fetch the health report for 6.7 VCSA.

 We have tried enabling the TLS 1.2 on the management server but still having the same issue.
#32 %RDY runs long and does not populate results in the report. No errors during run. 

Altering the %ready threshold does not make any difference. There are definitely VMs with high ready times in the VCenter server being connected to.

PowerCLI 5.5 Release 1 Build 1295336
Server 2012R@
VCenter 6.5 (Appliance)

Thanks!
