<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->

<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->
<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->

### Overview of the problem

The page keeps scrolling when resizing the element. Is resizing on mobile devices something that you would like to support? This is most likely a feature request.

<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->
I'm using re-resizable **4.11.0** [x.x.x]   
   
<!-- Could you please provide reproduced project on webpackbin with latest version rnd? -->

My **browser** is: Chrome for Android
   
I am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**? Pretty sure (went through active and closed threads).

### Description

When resizing element on a mobile phone (especially vertically), the page keeps scrolling. I tried using `e.preventDefault()` or `e.stopPropagation()` on `onResize` method, but it doesn't seem to have any effect.

### Steps to Reproduce

It is quite easy to reproduce using the available demo at [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/xp9p7272m4)

### Expected behavior

I would like to resize the dragged element, but the page should keep it's Y position.

### Actual behavior

The page keeps scrolling underneath the element.

This might be my fault as I'm not very familiar with css in general...

https://codesandbox.io/embed/new-platform-k2uhj

when resizing any of the divs they snap and become bigger than they were before unintentionally

I'm using re-resizable 6.0.0 on Firefox
