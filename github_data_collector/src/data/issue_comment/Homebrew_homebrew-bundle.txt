Running `cleanup`, then `cleanup --force`, then `cleanup` again to make sure it worked, I keep getting this error, but only on the run just after `cleanup --force` - also seems like it's not actually cleaning up since those packages are still around after the `--force`.  I'd expect `heroku-node` to stay because `heroku` demands it but the others should be gone or have similar warnings?

```

It would be nice for `brew bundle` to include subcommands to install/uninstall packages while keeping corresponding Brewfile up-to-date. Something similar to the add/remove functionality in bundler or npm. 

Is this feature significant enough to be considered for inclusion? If it's not high-enough priority, would a PR be accepted?

### Motivation
While `brew bundle` is great, keeping a Brewfile updated independent of the normal brew installation procedure is tedious/error-prone. It is especially painful when trying to maintain a consistent environment across multiple machines. 

A personal use-case: when testing new tools I tend to install and then quickly remove them once I decide they don't meet my needs. I'm inconsistent remembering, once I decide to keep them, to also update my global `.Brewfile`. The environments on my machines tend to slowly diverge.

### Proposal
Add two subcommands to `brew bundle`:

```sh
brew bundle add <package-name>
brew bundle remove <package-name>
```

Any `brew bundle` options would be applied to map to the correct Brewfile. The rest of the options could be passed through to the root install/uninstall commands.

#### Alternatives
Add npm-like `--save=<brewfile>` and `--save-global` options to `brew install`
- `+` Surfaces `brew bundle` functionality to more users. It's great, but hard-to-discover right now
- `-` Can't think of an unsurprising way for `brew uninstall` to clean up the correct Brewfile
- `-` Top-level commands now require a plugin, inverts control

Use `install/uninstall` instead of `add/remove` to maintain core `brew` jargon
- `-` Install already has a different meaning for `brew bundle`
- `-` Doesn't signal the Brewfile mutation as well as `add/remove`
