Hi,

I am Branko and I work for Manning Publications. I thought this book of ours might be a good resource for your list.

Thanks for considering it!

**Optimised classification of resources and updated some links. Detailed info (year and authors) for books. Not adding or deleting individual list items.**

Online books are books, and they are quite different from ordinary websites–more structured, focusing on a certain topic and few updates–so I suggest moving them from `## Websites` to `## Books`. (e.g. e.g. [R Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) ). I also updated links for some books whose newer versions are available, e.g. Hadley's [Advanced R ](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) and [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/)
The [ML workspace](https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace) is an all-in-one web-based IDE specialized for machine learning and data science. It is simple to deploy and gets you started within minutes to productively built ML solutions on your own machines. This workspace is the ultimate tool for developers preloaded with a variety of popular data science libraries and dev tools (e.g., Jupyter, RStudio, VS Code) perfectly configured, optimized, and integrated.
