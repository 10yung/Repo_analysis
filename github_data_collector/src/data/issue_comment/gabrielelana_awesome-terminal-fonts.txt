Hi, I really like these icons, but I'm having an issue. I can't get correct rendering on my Linux machine; I installed [media-fonts/fontawesome](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/media-fonts/fontawesome) first, then, this repo (following the Linux instructions) and it worked really good. But then I installed other fonts (from [portage](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage)), but I don't know what happened, now it is showing strange characters, for example [this battery icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/battery-three-quarters?style=solid) is showing this:

Very strange, right? But [this nice eye](https://fontawesome.com/icons/eye?style=solid) is showing correctly:

Do you have any clue about this? I will be thankful :)
I am on Mac OS Mojave, I am using oh-my-zsh+iTerm2+[powerlevel9k+awesome-patched](https://github.com/Powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k/wiki/Install-Instructions#option-3-install-awesome-powerline-fonts).

But now when I am trying to use the terminal, its having issue with the [emojis/unicode (the github shape, what is the right term?)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts/master/why.png).

Under the understanding (I might be wrong), that VSCode's terminal is reading the `.zshrc`. I am assuming that it read `POWERLEVEL9K_MODE='awesome-patched'`. I set the font to `"terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "'SourceCodePro+Powerline+Awesome+Regular',",` in `vscode's settings.json`.

Not sure where is the issue.  So I am posting all over for help. Anything will help.

Thanks

I am getting a `no matches found: /Users/myname/.fonts/*.sh` error when i start iTerm2. 

I followed all the instructions [here](https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts#how-to-install-osx)

Am i being super dumb here or am i doing something wrong. When i check for whether the font files are installed, i tried typing `echo "\uf015"`, and a home icon shows up, so the fonts ARE in fact installed, just not showing up in my iterm2.

Help please.

Installed this font using the windows method, however the font ins't appearing on the font list for wsl-terminal.
Hello,

I'm using Source Code Pro in my terminal and had some trouble in realizing that I had to change the name of the font in the config file since I used the Arch Package. I think Source Code Pro is a quite popular font for terminal output. Making it work by default will make it easier for a lot of people to use this font with PowerLevel9k for example.

I tested theses changes on ArchLinux running Linux kernel 4.16.11-1-ARCH. Everything seems to work properly despite of the presence of a conflicting font (provided by the ttf-ms-fonts package).

Thanks a lot for your work, keep it up !
I have the following two fonts specified in my 10-symbols.conf file to use the awesome-terminal-fonts:

    <fontconfig>
      <alias>
    <family>FiraCode</family>
    <prefer>
      <family>Pomodoro</family>
      <family>FontAwesome</family>
      <family>Octicons</family>
      <family>Icomoon</family>
    </prefer>
      <alias>
    <family>Roboto</family>
    <prefer>
      <family>Pomodoro</family>
      <family>FontAwesome</family>
      <family>Octicons</family>
      <family>Icomoon</family>
    </prefer>

If either of these fonts are set as one of the default fonts in Firefox, the fonts render as random symbols in Firefox. Not just the extra symbols, but regular letters and numbers too.

Elsewhere on the system, both fonts render fine, with the additional font symbols rendered as expected.

Not sure how to fix this. Is this an issue with Firefox or my 10-symbols.conf?


with solo user install and multi user install for powerline fonts i have 10-symbols.conf in multiple folders and i am getting lost about wich is effective. Also when you say "replacing PragmataPro with the name of the font you want to use in the terminal " you talk about one of the 4 fonts available in the .buid ?  I'm sorry it seems a stupid question but this is not obvious for me, and i have also to integrate it with Powerlevel9K that is not obvious too. I know when i'll succeed it i'll say it was obvious but now i'm lost and search a little help here after posting a lot of post in askUbuntu ^^

I'll delete this post as fast as i receive an answer that direct me a little as this is not a real issue .... sorry
