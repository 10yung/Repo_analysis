I have noticed that when a change that affects 5 or more keys will slow down UI rendering, 
UI rendering speed is fine when logging is disabled. 

I understand that logging should be disabled in production, just wondering if there is a way to overcome this issue. 

Disclaimer: Coming from Angular world 😁!

In libraries like NgRx, NgXs effects we always return an observable. 
I feel this code snippet 
```js
store
  .on('today')
  .pipe(
    debounce(100)
  )
  .subscribe(async date => {
    let users = await api.get({ since: date })
    store.set('users')(users)
  })
```

can be 
```js
store
  .on('today')
  .pipe(
    debounce(100),
    mergeMap( date => {
        return api.get({since: date})
    }),
    map( users => ({users})
  )
```

I did not put much thought into the syntax. I will try to test this and give you the results. For now, sharing this idea here.

I saw a couple of old PR and discussions about re-rendering the component only when the properties he subscribed too have changed and not on every store change.
Whats the status with that? what's blocking it?
I think it would be handy if Undux [used `React.forwardRef()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html#forwarding-refs-in-higher-order-components) to make sure that any refs attached to components created using `withStore` got attached to the wrapped component instead of the wrapper itself. Thoughts?
