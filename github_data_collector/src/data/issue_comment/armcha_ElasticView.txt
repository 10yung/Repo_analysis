Inflating a layout with ElasticView causes a layout exception and crashes. Can ElasticView be made to work with layout inflation? 
Wow, such a fantastic library! There's a slight issue I'm running into that I hope you can shed some light on. 

I am animating ElasticView in using animate()
After the animation is completed, ElasticView doesn't work correctly anymore. Sometimes, it stops responding to touch and is not elastic. Other times, it does respond but gets stuck in a position. 

Any idea why this is happening? Thanks! 
The min sdk version for using this lib is too high, can u decrease that to at least +16 or +17?
