Can you add switch or new tab for album artist, because right now its just painful to find music here. Instead of seeing for example ATB, i need to search through all ATB feat and etc.
So the thing is, that it's moving very slow so basicly white my finger is a the bottom of the screen, the tab is still halfway through so I need to wait for it till is get's to where I want it to be / I want to be in the playlist. Also, if it's at the bottom in a playlist, I can't see the tab anymore neither I can touch it. So I have to scroll several times within the playlist till that scrolling-tab appears again on the bottom right so that I can grab it and use it. And if you have a lot of songs just like I do it takes some time to scroll through your music several times with your thumb till that tab appears at the bottom.
And another thing is that I would really really like you guys to include is an option in the playlist for sorting the music like "a-z" within a playlist. This would be veryyy helpful. Thanks a lot,! I wish I could send you a Screenshot or a screen video so that you would better unter stand the problem I just described but nether the less I hope you got it right.

The app treats metered WiFis like any other WiFi connection instead of treating them as mobile data. The [isActiveNetworkMetered](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager.html#isActiveNetworkMetered()) check is what's missing.
I hav 1065 songs but only 1023 are read rest cannot be played but on other apps its working

The software that I use to download music uses the `;` character as divider for tracks that have multiple authors. Retro Player **interprets** this as a **single author** and doesn't find anything on internet (image, biography) because it searches for `author1;author2;author3` instead interpreting them as separate authors.
Hope this issue will be fixed asap cause it make frustrated such good app have these little mistakes in it

Add an option to select a theme which overrides the default selected theme if dark mode is active. 

- Keep the current setting for the theme
- add 2nd selection for the same themes
 - if 2nd selection is set, use this if system dark mode is active


Hi, I had used this wonderful app on my Pixelbook for months, until some time ago (a couple of months ago) the app just started crashing on the device. Rolling back to the old version still works fine, but I have to stay outdated in order to keep the app working. I am a beta tester, and even after trying the latest updates on my Chromebook, the app is crashing. 

I hope there is some way to fix this. If there is any extra information you need me to share, go ahead and tell me. I am willing to help!

Have a wonderful day :)

Whenever I change an album's date and/or use Last.Fm to find an album's art, it resets or stays the same.
