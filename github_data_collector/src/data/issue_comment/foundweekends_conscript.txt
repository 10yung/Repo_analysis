As `conscript/setup.sh` always executes `cs` as the last thing, the script's exit status will be 1, as cs fails due to no args are passed.

I'd like to see either

- cs execution be removed from the script; or
- offer setup.sh additional flag for stand-alone execution, to skip cs invocation.

Reasoning: automated install scripts referencing setup.sh report bogus failures.
It's impossible to run the conscript install script on any shell other than bash and expect it to work without making manual changes to the install script. 
When I run:
$ cs foundweekends/giter8

I get (after a minute or so):
An unexpected error occurred: Please check your internet connection.
Exception message: connection timed out: api.github.com/192.30.253.116:443 to https://api.github.com/repos/foundweekends/giter8/git/refs/heads/master

Internet connection is OK (can access that from other tools, e.g. curl)

have set proxy using JAVA_OPTS eg:

$ echo $JAVA_OPTS
-Dhttp.proxyHost=my.proxy.server  -Dhttp.proxyPort=1234 -Dhttps.proxyHost=my.proxy.server  -Dhttps.proxyPort=1234

plus everything else on my system seems happy proxy wise

I am on centos 7.3
Java 1.8


Neither the jar nor the shell script make the `cs` available in the terminal.
When conscript fails to find the default "master" branch -- or the specified branch if one is specified -- then it incorrectly reports "Repository not found on github" rather than reporting that it cannot find the branch.

Example:
Type: cs sbt/sbt
Result: "Repository not found on github" because there is no "master" branch

Type: cs sbt/sbt --branch 0.13.12  # from http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Scripts.html
Result: Result: "Repository not found on github" because there is no 0.13.12 branch

Type: cs sbt/sbt --branch 0.13
Result: works (at the time of this writing)

This was very confusing as a complete newbie trying to figure out what was going wrong until I realized it simply wasn't findng the branch.

My platform is windows 10, powershell version is 4.0:

I use admin command line, try to run setup.ps1, and get errors of SSL access:

```

I think it should do some setting for SSL connection, can not directly use System.Net.WebClient。
it should added something between those line in setup.ps1.
···
$wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
...
$wc.DownloadFile($url, "$CS/$LJ")
···

My platform is windows 10.
I set %CONSCRIPT_HOME% and %PATH% as the http://www.foundweekends.org/conscript/setup.html instruction.

My %profile dir%/.gitconfig file is:

```
# This is Git's per-user configuration file.
[user]
# Please adapt and uncomment the following lines:
    name = thinksource
    email = foretribe@gmail.com
[github]
    token = 513e6094d*****token*******faaa
```

Then I try to run conscript_2.11-0.5.0-proguard.jar via command line:

```
java -jar conscript_2.11-0.5.0-proguard.jar
```

I still get error 

```
An unexpected error occurred: Please check your internet connection.
You may need to generate a github access token.

```

This is actually a suggestion. Just crossed my mind that the official documentation already points to conscript to achieve one of the sbt features: [Scripts](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Scripts.html) (kind of an interesting circular dependency going on here), so I guess it would make sense that the two projects talk to each other about this possibility.

I have **sbt** configured to use proxy repositories as described in the [Proxy Repositories doc](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Proxy-Repositories.html). However, when I use **cs**, only the repositories defined in the launchconfig are used.

Can these be overridden to follow my proxy configuration instead?

When running multiple `scalas` instances (installed using conscript as described on http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Scripts.html) all of the are hanging and just reporting:

```
Waiting for lock on /home/brandl/.conscript/boot/sbt.boot.lock to be available...
```

Locking should be optional or different instances should not interfere which each other.
