I am using ZXingScannerView in my Activity. Id like to set the scan area to the whole extension of the screen. Is there any way to do it?

Thanks!

<me.dm7.barcodescanner.zxing.ZXingScannerView
            android:id="@+id/scanview"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            android:layout_above="@+id/backbutton"/>
Hi,

I really appreciate the project that you have put together here but I am having difficulty using it as my requirement is to read long barcodes with slightly poor camera quality.

Please could you let me know if there is a way to set the viewfinder to scan vertically and change the size of the rectangle without changing the screen orientation of the device? I have looked through all of the set options for the ZXingScannerView but cannot find anything that does this.

Thanks again for the great work.

I use the scanner in fragment, and i want to add an action-based scanner. I want to press on a button and then trigger the scan operation.
how can i use you library to make this happen?
Hi, I am trying to use your library for scanning QR Code as well as the core Zxing library to generate QR Code. However when trying to build i got this error message :
```
Manifest merger failed : Attribute application@appComponentFactory value=(androidx.core.app.CoreComponentFactory) from [androidx.core:core:1.0.0-beta01] AndroidManifest.xml:22:18-86
	is also present at [com.android.support:support-compat:28.0.0] AndroidManifest.xml:22:18-91 value=(android.support.v4.app.CoreComponentFactory).
	Suggestion: add 'tools:replace="android:appComponentFactory"' to <application> element at AndroidManifest.xml:5:5-26:19 to override.
```

My dependencies are :
```
dependencies {
    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.0.0-beta01'
    implementation 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:1.1.2'
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.12'
    androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test:runner:1.1.0-alpha4'
    androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.1.0-alpha4'
    implementation "com.google.zxing:core:3.3.0"
    implementation 'com.google.zxing:javase:3.3.0'
    implementation 'me.dm7.barcodescanner:zxing:1.9.13'
    implementation 'de.hdodenhof:circleimageview:3.0.1'
}
```

Does this mean that your library cannot be used together with the original Zxing library?
The camera opens but doesn't pick up the qr code 
Hi, 

i have this crash when read a qr code with a camera, is the same code that example FullScannerActivity.java

I read over the problem, and this is because the lib zxing:core use Java 8 and this is not support in api < 24. The solution is compiler zxing:core version 3.3.3.

It's possible?

or exist other implementation?

Thank you.
Camera.setPreviewCallbackWithBuffer
Will this method be used to get preview data in the future?

Add ability to zoom the preview so that terrible cameras have a much better chance of reading barcodes and QR codes.

I've tested this with a UMIDIGI A3, which has such a terrible camera that a small barcode cannot be read. Using the "zoom to max" feature implemented in ScalingScannerActivity.java, the otherwise unreadable barcode is easily read.
could you please any one suggest how to i increase laser line speed and laser line height ?
