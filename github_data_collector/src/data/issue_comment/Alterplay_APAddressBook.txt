I have noticed that when I delete a contact from the address book and then adding another contact, that it doesn't overwrite the removed ID and instead adds a new one. Is the `recordID` for an `APContact` always unique? I'm trying to sync up a custom domain model to an `APContact` sych that each APContact represents a 1:1 custom model and am using `recordID`. Is the record ID similar to that of `Identifier` in https://developer.apple.com/documentation/contacts/cncontact/identifier? 



IS there any plan to maintain this repo for Swift 4 as Xcode9 and Swift are released?
I am using APAdressbook  , when i load my contact i get "self.contacts = contacts" 
But in self.contact i get all the contacts get duplicate multiple times. How to resolve it.
Hi, 
**Question:** is there a way to filter which address book to show? 
**Problem:** If there are multiple accounts in the iPhone APAddressBook shows all the contacts regardless which account they belong.
Thanks

We're using `APAddressBook` to load native contacts to search against. However, for some of our users who have > 10k native contacts, the app seems to be consuming too much memory, causing an unexpected JetSam event and terminating the app.

Looking at the method where contacts are being extracted:

```
- (NSArray *)allContactsWithContactFieldMask:(APContactField)fieldMask
{
    NSMutableArray *contacts = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
    if (!self.wrapper.error)
    {
        CFArrayRef peopleArrayRef = ABAddressBookCopyArrayOfAllPeople(self.wrapper.ref);
        CFIndex count = CFArrayGetCount(peopleArrayRef);
        for (CFIndex i = 0; i < count; i++)
        {
            ABRecordRef recordRef = CFArrayGetValueAtIndex(peopleArrayRef, i);
            APContact *contact = [self.builder contactWithRecordRef:recordRef fieldMask:fieldMask];
            [contacts addObject:contact];
        }
        CFRelease(peopleArrayRef);
    }
    return contacts.count > 0 ? contacts.copy : nil;
}
```

Would it be better if we call this method using an `autorelease pool` and batching up contacts? Is there a better way to handle the large volume of contacts with `APAddressBook`?

I am getting the result of contact phonelabels as

[(null) ((null)) - 888-555-5512, (null) ((null)) - 888-555-1212]
We are facing an issue .Our requirement is that when ever there is change in Phone book we need to listen  for it and act on it based on last modified date. When i perform a change in Native phone book (i.e. one change) the call back is getting fired multiple times. Are we doing something wrong?

Is our understanding right that the call back will get called only once for a change
I have integrate with my app.But my app not build. I get error .plz help.

No visible @interface for 'ContactTableViewCell' declares the selector 'updateWithContact:'
