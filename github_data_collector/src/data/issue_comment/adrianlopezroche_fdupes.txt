Hi,

I have upgraded to Catalina & now fdupes is not working properly, i know for a fact i have duplicate files in at least 3 directories & fdupes is not picking this up.. 
I have brew installed & have updated all packages too but to no affect..
Just wondering if you are aware or if there is a work around to hand..

Many Regards
Jim :)
With size option, fdupes shows size of duplicate files in bytes which is not
always easy to read for a human. This new human-size option reports sizes in a
more readable format (B, KiB, MiB,...).
Add int is_first_timespec_newer(struct timespec first, struct timespec second).

Change time_t sorttime to struct timespec sorttimespec.

Change getmtime(char *filename) and getctime(char *filename) to return
pointer to newly allocated struct timespec (must be passed to free() after use).
Hello,
it would be nice to have an option to print a summary at the end of the run, showing information about
- time taken to run
- files kept
- files removed
- total sum of files removed sized (in human readable format)

probably some other info i'm not thinking of right now

I am looking to entirely suppress output to the console. Based on the documentation, I thought combining flags `-dNq` would achieve this, but information about retained and deleted files (the [+/-] syntax) is still printed to stdout. Is there a way to avoid this?
My most common important duplication error is having directories fully copied but with different names. So fdupes finds all the files that are duplicated but it is verbose output since it may be that the whole directory is duplicated which is sufficient information. In this case, it is just easiest and best to go in and delete one of those directories by myself. So is it possible to list say the top three offending directory duplications by size and not just number of files with a flag option?
Maybe `-w`

Current workaround: https://github.com/jbruchon/jdupes/issues/94#issuecomment-455416786
Would it be possible to have the output as a JSON file?
Thanks
Would it be possible to add the hash to the output?
It would be useful when comparing different directories.
Think different source code repositories where a sub-directory might contain common assets / code.
Need option for deleting files:
Keep old file (by file creation time) and delete others
Keep new file (by file creation time) and delete others

This parameter may be shortcut for ORDER and/or REVERSE ORDER parameters.
