animator!.moveY(50).animate(1.0)

Keep getting an error on the above line that says:

Argument passed to call that takes no arguments

Please Help!!! 

For example, I want a view repeat a "up-down animation".
code:
JHChainableAnimator *anim = [[JHChainableAnimator alloc] initWithView:view];
anim.moveY(10).thenAfter(0.2).moveY(-10).animateWithRepeat(0.2,5);

But the view will move down once and move up five times
Hi,

I tried to add this library in my project, but the last changes of the last commit does not appears actually if I browse in the code. Maybe, because the name of the last version (3.0.1) is the same as the previous one.

Please, fix it. Thanks
Hi, I find a bug about swift func, so I fix it.

In current implementation spring easing is just an **easeOutElastic** now. I want spring animation has _dampingRatio_ and _velocity_ parameters and to be implemented as a real spring animation.

Thank you.
Hello! I need to fade in a view while it is moving to its destination point.
So I setup it with zero alpha and start coordinates, then I need to move it to the destination in 1 second and change its alpha to 1 in 0.3 second.

Is there a possibility to do that?
**a.makeOpacity(1).animate(0.3).moveX(destination).animate(1)** doesn't work.
Hello!
Thank you for providing the animation library, which I recently used in my project, but I found a bug. Animation usually works normally. When I jump from the current App to the second App, and then jump back to the current App, any animation will be repeated.
Say you want to move something from Point A to Point B, but while it's moving, it now needs to continue on through B to C.

Is there a way to accomplish this currently?

Doing it in the animateWithCompletion block results in a stop and go..

(The functionality is built into UIView animateWithDuration w/ the UIViewAnimationOptionBeginFromCurrentState option)
