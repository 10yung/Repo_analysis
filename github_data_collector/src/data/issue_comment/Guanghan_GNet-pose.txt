After clearing some errors, I successfully runned the test.py in google colab and finally, it shows the message
**testing scales:  [1, 0.75]
output_image_folder_path:  dataset_lsp/results_cropped/**

But no images were found in the path. I have attached my input images in the path 
**dataset_lsp/images_cropped/** 

Are there any changes I have to do in input images or in its path? 
 
load('eval_MPII/Tompson Test Set', 'annolist');
load('eval_MPII/Tompson Test Set', 'keypointsAll');
load('eval_MPII/Tompson Test Set', 'RELEASE_img_index');
load('eval_MPII/Tompson Test Set', 'RELEASE_person_index');
Where i find it ??
Hi,

Where is this folder "Tompson_valid"?

Thanks!
Hi @Guanghan ,
Thanks for your great project.
Can you show to me your loss curve of your final model?
Below is my result when training GNet-pose with base_lr: 0.0001, batch_size: 4, after 3 days, trained 76 epochs.
![313](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11450887/40895781-50ab5818-67ec-11e8-9774-c902aff285d2.png)
It still cannot converge.
If you trained with other parameter in prototxt file, please tell me.
I'm waiting for your feedback.
hi! your work seems awesome, but it is really difficult to install the modified caffe.
is there any chance that you'll add a step by step explanation? or at-least some background as to what is needed before installing it?
Hi, @Guanghan  ,Thanks your great repo ,  when I run test.py  , the show of  result looks like bad  , I guess it may  have relationship with  the image resolution  , so ,how size  the imput image be set?
thanks for you code !but when i run
