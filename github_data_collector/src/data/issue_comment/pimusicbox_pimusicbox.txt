I've setup my musicbox and so far it's mostly working good. 

However I've set it up for both me and my girlfriend living with me. We are both using it, with different Spotify Accounts. She has a Facebook-created account so logging in with user credentials is very tedious if not impossible - so I've used my username and password for the web-search functions and spotify features of Pi MusicBox.

However, we both occassionally use it via Spotify Connect, and she can't since a restart always changes the /etc/default/librespot file's ARGs to use my username and password.

How can I change it to accept any user?
any stream i try to play go timeout 

also the default ones in streams
Hello i just installed music box 0.7.0RC7 on my raspberry b+

when turning on my raspberry everything look fine and then i am on raspbian loggin screen.
when trying to find setting.ini in the sd card i cannot.

and i do not anything from my spotify apps

any idea where i have done something wrong ?

First off, let me say that I'm both thankful for this awesome image, and I do love using it! So far I've found it mostly bug free for my uses (pretty much exclusively AirPlay and Spotify Connect). 

Recently, I've come across an issue where I will not see the Music Box in my AirPlay list or it will show up but give a "Cannot Connect" error, but, if I start a Spotify Connect stream, and then go back and AirPlay to the device, it works as normal, and AirPlay is fine. Seems a bit odd, but I figured I'd open an issue and make a note of it. I think for the most part it is a non issue, as it hasn't done it in a few days, but again, just making a note. 

The image is stock other than updating the underlying support for Spotify Connect that was suggested in another Issue.  
Have been trying to install an ftp server on my piMusicBox with no luck.
I run apt-get update and then apt-get install proftpd-basic but nothing.
I've tried this ssh and by attaching a screen and keyboard to the Rpi, same result each time.
Attached is the terminal output, you will see that update has errors.
Any suggestions?
Thanks,
TGit

Is this supported for the newest Raspberry Pi 4 model? I haven't been able to boot into it using the new model.
Love MusicBox.  I noticed two issues with it when casting to MusicBox from Windows Media Player (UpMPD):

1) The skip song back/forward buttons in the browser cause the warning shown in the attachment ('Problem looking up https:/...') and don't work; while the pause button in fact skips to the next song.

2) When it switches from one song to the next in the list it generates the Warning with 'Please file a bug', but it still works fine.

Cheers!

I would like to know if pimusic has scheduling capability? I would like to schedule the playlist should play at 6 AM every morning.

Please suggest
  
Im really new to pi, and only bought one for this project.

I bought a Raspberry Pi W
I've got it connected to my tv, but it doesnt seem to connect to my wifi. I have a router and inputted the wifi and password in the settings using a microSD card. If anyone can help or I should just buy a new pi lmk. Im struggling hard.

side note: i also tried connecting it to ssh just using raspbian but that was no go, maybe since im not sure what im doing

Ill give you $20 if you help me solve this issue. Ive tried for 2 days (but maybe u can do better since i suck)
It is currently not possible to start playing a different song when another is already playing when using Spotify connect; instead it must first be added to the song queue and the currently playing song skipped.

My apologies if this has already been pointed out.
