Hi @jlong,

I revamped `getserve` website to look like this:

![getserve](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/470401/21752290/24076c76-d5de-11e6-8b9c-7c5a962fa573.png)


So I hope if I can get access to upload the new code, and I am managing to release a new version soon.
Hi, I had to move a serve project to a new folder (with new name). Now it needs a few minutes to start.
Is there a way to find out whats causing this?

Thanks!

Hi,

I created an empty folder with `index.slim` page is rendered properly, but when I try to convert `serve convert` I get a file `html/index.slim` which contains html.

The only problem is the extension.

Unfortunately with Ruby 2.2 and ActiveSupport 3.2.19 (used in latest 1.5.2 Gem release) or 3.2.21 (used on Github master branch) the following warning is shown with Ruby 2.2:

`/.rbenv/versions/2.2.0/lib/ruby/gems/2.2.0/gems/activesupport-3.2.21/lib/active_support/values/time_zone.rb:270: warning: circular argument reference - now`

It would be great to get this warning removed by upgrading to a later version of ActiveSupport if possible.

As described in issues ##122 adding an `index.css` file will fail the following specs:

```
Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/router_spec.rb:23 # Serve::Router should resolve directory indexes
rspec ./spec/router_spec.rb:54 # Serve::Router should resolve directories without case sensitivity
```

If both — `index.html` and `index.css` files — are present within a directory the CSS file will be served as directory index.

Would be a nice idea to support Apache-style serverside includes? That way, it's super easy to migrate projects that use SSI, from forcing my fellow developers to install and config Apache (or nginx, which uses an almost identical syntax), to having them type `serve` :)

Example for good measure:

```
<!--#include virtual="inc/bottom.html"-->
```

This would include ./inc/bottom.html relative to the file being processed.

Actually I believe there is an actively-being-developed module for NPM, and a gem (no idea about the status) that handle resolving these SSI.

I successfully installed and ran serve under ruby 1.9.3p448.

Using Ruby 2.1.2, I get an an error:
