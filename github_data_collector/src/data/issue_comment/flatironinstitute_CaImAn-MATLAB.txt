Hello Developer,

I am using run_pipeline.m to analyse my video and found the following error message:
Error using parallel.FevalFuture/fetchNext (line 217)
The function evaluation completed with an error.

Error in run_CNMF_patches (line 121)
        [idx, value] = fetchNext(future_results);

Error in run_pipeline (line 127)
[A,b,C,f,S,P,RESULTS,YrA] = run_CNMF_patches(data.Y,K,patches,tau,0,options);  % do not perform deconvolution here since

Error in run (line 91)
evalin('caller', strcat(script, ';'));

Caused by:
    Error using get_noise_fft (line 13)
    Too many output arguments.

I am running the script on a tif video in matlab 2019. 

Many thanks,
Mingran
