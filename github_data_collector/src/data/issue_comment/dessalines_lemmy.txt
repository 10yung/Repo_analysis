Fixes #380 
The `next` button is always showing on the overviews. Should be hidden when there is not enough content to warrant a next page.
Similar to the way Peertube does it, post creation could have a language dropbown. That would allow users to filter by language, and only see those posts they can understand. This would make it easier to have multiple different languages in the same server/community.

Reddit doesnt support this at all, so users in other languages have to go to their own subreddit, and all the big ones are completely dominated by English. Honestly what you expect from an American company when it comes to language support, so I think we can do much better.
There might be a way using the husky pre-commit, checking for any changes in the translations folder, and altering the translation report generator to manually edit the README.

This should have a good method to replace text between markers: https://github.com/jonschlinkert/markdown-toc

```
img {
 -webkit-filter: blur(10px);
}
```
Would be cool if this could somehow be generated automatically. Here is some discussion about it.

A whole lot of component updates, based on issues mentioned in #389 

- updated a long of translation elements with direct string translation functions, this removes all the wrapper elements that are being added. (less elements in the DOM)
- updated default `<div>` to `<main>` and `<aside>` for the layout.
- added `for` attributes to all the labels and added `ids` to all the form elements these labels point to (still have some components to go.
- updated some level h5 headings to h2 and h3 (proper styling for these need to be added).
- quick fix: centered the loading svg for the page load
- added `aria-label` to the hamburger menu.
So on `main.tsx` and `community.tsx`, add a radio button to switch between post or comment view, with the sorting given by the other radio buttons.

Would be useful for the [announcements](https://dev.lemmy.ml/c/announcements) community.
