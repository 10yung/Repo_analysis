Following @atomotic's [comment in #1465](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/issues/1465#issuecomment-552466906), there should be a command-line argument to set the scheme, server domain and optional prefix to be used in the info.json `@id`, instead of the default "https://example.com/iiif/"

See [Image API 2.1](https://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/#technical-properties): the `@id` property of the info.json must be "The base URI of the image as defined in URI Syntax, including scheme, server, prefix and identifier without a trailing slash."
See https://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/#technical-properties (table after the paragraph starting with "The objects in the tiles list have the properties in the following table...")
For example:
vipsthumbnail  test.bmp -s 200x200 -o out.jpg
But it is not available now.

Hi, I have such an error, in the Linux system in the terminal when vips dzsave breaks in half and writes * Killed *. dmesg leads out of memory. What can i do?
## Background
We have a usecase of converting multipage tiff to png where the input tiff file can have multi-pages with each page differing in width and height. Since libvips does not have the support to convert multipage tiff(that differs in width & height) to png, we convert each page in tiff file to png and then join the pngs. 

## Issue
So for one of the customer file, we get the following error using `arrayjoin` or `join`

```
vips arrayjoin "yc_page_1.png yc_page_2.png" yc_whole.png --across 1
arrayjoin: not one band or 4 bands
```

```
vips join yc_page_1.png yc_page_2.png yc_whole.png vertical
insert: images must have the same number of bands, or one must be single-band
```

Is there any workaround of fix for the same?
Hi John,

> vips version : vips-8.7.0-Fri Aug 31 14:11:19 UTC 2018

Im calling VIPS API for thumbnail generation from Java using JNI . In some cases segmentation fault error occurs , which crashes the server . Im not able to reproduce the case .  Some of the traces are

Im thinking of handling the segmentation fault by signal handler . Is it advisable ? Any idea on how to handle this ?



I don't know if libvips can do this kind of operation. Any suggestion?
RFE Open for discussion

I notice libvips have some support for plugins

Would it be possible to make **heic** support a plugin ?

Context: as there still patent issue with llibheif and its dependency, it is not possible to include it in some distribution (Fedora, RHEL, CentOS...), or, only in some alternative repository (e.g. RPMFusion)

For now, I have to build 2 set of packages (in my repository)
- **vips** (without heic support)
- **vips-full** (with heic support and dependency on libheif from RPMfusion)

So user have the choice, but each set of packages create conflicts with the other (by design, only one can be installed)

Official repopsitories will **never** be able to provide heic support.

So, it would be nice, to be able to build heic as a plugin, which can be distribute in a separate (optional) packages, so
- **vips** (library)
- **vips-devel**
- **vips-doc**
- **vips-tools** (CLI command)
- **vips-heic** (requiring vips main package)
- ...

This will make downstream packager life a bit easier

Notice, this is what is done for ImageMagick (ImageMagick, ImageMagick-djvu, ImageMagick7-heic...)
The vector path currently uses a 16 x 16 -> 32 mul followed by a shift. We should experiment with 32 x 32 -> top 32 of 64. We could use the same precision as the C path.

See:

https://github.com/libvips/pyvips/issues/148#issuecomment-570721063

Similarly for the conv vector path.
When I convert the **tiff file to png**, I get the following warnings and error:

```
(bimg:24): VIPS-WARNING **: 12:59:21.306: Depreciated and troublesome old-style JPEG compression mode, please convert to new-style JPEG compression and notify vendor of writing software

(bimg:24): VIPS-WARNING **: 12:59:21.307: error in tile 0 x 1

(bimg:24): VIPS-WARNING **: 12:59:21.307: error in tile 0 x 2
```
---
```
Error: LibJpeg: Improper call to JPEG library in state 0
tiff2vips: read error
vips2png: unable to write to buffer
```

Since its a customer tiff file, I wont be able to share the file here :(
The above error is thrown when the tiff file is converted to png


## Details

Libvips version: `8.8.3`

Running libvips on alpine `v3.9`

We use [bimg](https://github.com/h2non/bimg) to talk to `libvips`



**Note**: I have checked the libtiff config for enablement of supporting old-styled JPEG
