I'd like to use the responsive mode from Dev Tools (a.k.a. "Device toolbar") to make a screenshot using pre-defined sized (e.g. 1280x720 px). Is this possible?

Is it possible to use this to open a new tab that's pinned?
I'm using profiles for quite some time, and opening a link with a specified Chrome profile is still not possible as far as I know. That would be a fantastic feature.
Switching or opening profiles might be handy features also.
I'am experiencing some unexpected termination with presentation mode. 

My environment. 
```
$ chrome-cli version             
1.5.0
$ chrome-cli chrome version
58.0.3029.33
```

Errors with presentation mode. 
```

e.g. activate tabs, replay XHR, print to the console, etc. (awesome project!)
Can this be done? Thank you. 

`chrome-cli open google.com` results in a new tab with "about:blank" in the title bar.
`chrome-cli open www.google.com` also does exactly the same.
but `chrome-cli open http://google.com` or `chrome-cli open http://www.google.com` works as expected.
Can you make it so that the http:// protocol is optional? If we need a different protocol we can type that in instead.
Thanks
