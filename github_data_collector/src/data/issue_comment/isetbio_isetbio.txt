I moved these to the skipped section of examples.  They seem to have to do with
calls of form: figNum = vcSelectFigure('GRAPHWIN');

I'm guessing this once worked but doesn't any more.  
t_codeISETPref was broken, because it was trying to use a key 'font delta'.
I recoded to use 'font size', which allows it to run.  But I don't see any actual
effect of the command.
When running my image metric calculations, I found it helpful to be able to fix the seed on the cone mosaic being generated. This way, I had the option to compare the same two cone mosaics for both the test and reference image. 

I achieved this by adding an optional "patternSeed" parameters for the cone mosaic class. The alternate way to do this would be to generate a single cone mosaic object, and then re-use it for multiple calculations. However, the way I was looping and traversing through image metric databases made that method difficult, which is why I added the option to set the seed.  

Do you guys think this might be a good addition to the class? 

I note in the comments that the cone mosaic is only fixed for a single FOV, if you regenerate with a different size the cone mosaic will change even if the seed is fixed.

Hi everyone,

I've been doing a lot of analyses with S-CIELAB/CIELAB in combination with ISETBio. Currently these two metrics are located in the ISETCam repository. Unfortunately ISETCam and ISETBio have some conflicts with each other and can't be on the same path. To get around that, I've been extracting the metrics from ISETCam and keeping them in a separate folder. 

This occasionally makes it difficult to share my code. I've been considering moving the metrics into ISETBio to make things easier and more consistent. 

However, I see two minor downsides of doing this; (1) we would have yet another duplicate of a function in ISETBio and ISETCam and (2) these metrics are currently meant to be run on display RGB images, so one could argue whether they truly belong in ISETBio. 

Do you guys have any thoughts on this? It's not a huge deal to have a separate "metrics" folder, but I'm wondering if there's a better way.


Only real question from the two folder sets:
t_code\t_codeISETPref - This script was listed as broken due to a missing script, however, it appears to execute? Is this still broken then, or is this an improper execution?
