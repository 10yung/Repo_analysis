It would be great if the voice over response could be set.
I added a button on interface builder. Set up click event. When changing the style, the animation is not working. The style does change, but without animation
Currently, if you call layoutsubviews while the button is animating, ` setStyle(buttonStyle, animated: false)` will be called and hence the animation will complete instantly.

 Since my button animates the view it is in, layoutsubviews is called several times during the transition and hence the button doesn't work.

For the `DynamicButtonStyle.arrowUp` I'm trying to round it but i end up with the arrow at the top instead of center. how come? Could you make it possible to adjust icon size and properly align it in the center

I'm trying to set an image as background, it works but the image is like stretched out - very ugly lol. Is there a way to fix that? or am I doing something wrong with the image?
