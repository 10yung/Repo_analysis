It looks like the number of times citr requests the full library from BBT can be optimized. For large libraries this should yield a performance improvement. 

I'm open to adding an endpoint in BBT that would allow testing whether the library has changed since last fetch, but to do this effectively, I must understand what triggers a re-read of the BBT-produced bib file, and whether it's cached on the citr end
It's frustrating when `citr` freezes your session so I thought I'd have a play with the `future` package. Results seem promising so far, so thought I'd report back, having alluded to the potential utility of having the initial bib read running in the background several months ago. Basic concept demonstrated in reprex below. Thoughts: welcome!

``` r

# exclude things to make reprex faster
exclude = c("My Library", "energy-and-transport")

# no future
tictoc::tic()
b = citr::load_betterbiblatex_bib(encoding = "UTF-8", exclude_betterbiblatex_library = exclude)

I have an issue with diacritics in the bib-file that citr creates from my Zotero references. I run Zotero and connect R to it directly. When I want to knit a pdf with a bib-file that includes diacritics, R throws the following error:

```
! Undefined control sequence.
l.93 (Ã…\nobreakspaceirok
                         Ã½ et al. 2011) 

Error: Failed to compile citr-test.tex. See https://yihui.name/tinytex/r/#debugging for debugging tips. See citr-test.log for more info.
Execution halted
```

However, when I paste the citation from a manual export, with unicode as plain-text latex commands, to the bib-file created by citr, the pdf is created perfectly.

The paper I use in this case can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10493-011-9442-8), but it is the case with any publication with diacritics.

Whereas its larvae and nymphs are less host-specific feeding on a variety of tetrapods, tortoises of the genus Testudo are principal hosts of adults. Ticks retained this trait also in our study under laboratory conditions, while adults were reluctant to feed on mammalian hosts. Combination of feeding larvae and nymphs on guinea pigs and feeding of adults on Testudo marginata tortoises provided the best results. Feeding period of females was on average 25~days (range 17-44), whereas males remain after female engorgement on tortoise host. Female pre-oviposition period was 14~days (3-31), followed by 24~days of oviposition (18-29). Pre-eclosion and eclosion, both together, takes 31~days (21-43). Larvae fed 5~days (3-9), then molted to nymphs after 17~days (12-23). Feeding period of nymphs lasted 7~days (5-10), engorged nymphs molted to adults after 24~days (19-26). Sex ratio of laboratory hatched H. aegyptium was nearly equal (1:1.09). The average weight of engorged female was 0.95 (0.72-1.12)~g. The average number of laid eggs was 6,900 (6,524-7,532) per female, it was significantly correlated with weight of engorged female. Only 2.8\% of engorged larvae and 1.8\% of engorged nymphs remained un-molted and died. Despite the use of natural host species, feeding success of females reached only 45\%. The whole life-cycle was completed within 147~days (98-215).},

As you can see, the latter contains a lot of extra characters, that even citr itself does not understand.

I would like to know how I can resolve this, because I like to create a new bib-file for each project I create, which then only contains the references used in that project.
When loading the following citation, the citr plugin does not correctly display the ü. The bib file is utf-8 encoded.

I look forward to your reply. Thanks.

Many thanks for develop the citr package.
I have a question:
I deleted my bib file, now i would like scan the references from my document and import from zotero the bibtex and save in a new .bib file, it is possible? 
I try to use:
citr::load_betterbiblatex_bib(encoding = "UTF-8")
But it import all bibliography from zotero and i can write it in a .bib file

many thanks
Reported by Karin Nilsson:

> It seems like the addin automatically sorts them based on year because it always places the 2010-reference before the 2012-reference in the markdown file. However, when knitting the document it sorts in alphabetic order based on the name of the third author, which places the references in the reversed order.

@article{Danielsson2010,
abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate executive functions in adults with intellectual disability, and compare them to a closely matched control group longitudinally for 5 years. In the Betula database, a group of adults with intellectual disability (ID, n=46) was defined from measures of verbal and non-verbal IQ. A control group, with two people for every person with intellectual disability (n=92), was chosen by matching on the following criterion in order of priority: IQ higher than 85, age, sex, sample, level of education, and years of education. Three types of tasks of executive functions were included on two occasions, with 5 years between testing sessions: The Tower of Hanoi, executively loaded dual task versions of word recall, and verbal fluency. Adults with ID showed significant impairments on verbal fluency and on the executively loaded dual task word recall task (at encoding but not at recall). There were no group differences on the Tower of Hanoi. No significant differences between the two test occasions were found. The results are interpreted in terms of individuals with ID having problems with speed of accessing lexical items and difficulties with working memory-related executive control at encoding, which includes shifting between tasks. There are, however, not necessarily problems with inhibition. The dual task results additionally imply that the adults with intellectual disability were more sensitive to strategy interruptions at encoding, but that dividing attention at recall did not have such detrimental effects.},

abstract = {Children with intellectual disability (ID) were given a comprehensive range of executive functioning measures, which systematically varied in terms of verbal and non-verbal demands. Their performance was compared to the performance of groups matched on mental age (MA) and chronological age (CA), respectively. Twenty-two children were included in each group. Children with ID performed on par with the MA group on switching, verbal executive-loaded working memory and most fluency tasks, but below the MA group on inhibition, planning, and non-verbal executive-loaded working memory. Children with ID performed below CA comparisons on all the executive tasks. We suggest that children with ID have a specific profile of executive functioning, with MA appropriate abilities to generate new exemplars (fluency) and to switch attention between tasks, but difficulties with respect to inhibiting pre-potent responses, planning, and non-verbal executive-loaded working memory The development of different types of executive functioning skills may, to different degrees, be related to mental age and experience. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

It is often the case that bibliographic information needs updating because of typos, first names as initials rather then in full, etc. Currently bibliographic entries are added to the local `.bib` file when the reference is inserted in the text. It would be best to make such updates in Zotero (as a master source) and then update the relevant entry in the local `.bib` file.

Would it be feasible to have a function that looks at the local `.bib` file and "refreshes" the entries from Zotero?
