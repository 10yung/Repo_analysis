This works fine in macOS, but on Windows 10, it fails. (R 3.6.1, everything up to date.)

Hi Pablo,

I tried to download some tweets from Spain with tweetsscores::getTimeline . Unfortunetely, it always runs into problems with special characters. I found your tutorial on special characters (http://pablobarbera.com/ECPR-SC104/code/12-encoding.html) and following it, I noticed that the issue does not happen using the tweetscores::searchTweets function as their special characters seem to be encoded properly. I compared the source code but could not spot the what´s wrong. Any help would be much appreciated! :)

Best, Niko
Hi Pablo, I spent a couple hours trying many solutions, so with no luck I think there's probably an issue. I'm not a good enough programmer to be much help, I'm afraid, but here's the best I can give you.

Something seems screwy because `estimateIdeology('jmrphy', oauth = my_oauth)` will throw the error `Error in estimateIdeology("jmrphy", oauth = my_oauth) : unused argument (oauth = my_oauth)`

But `estimateIdeology('jmrphy')` will throw an error for `Error in getOAuth(oauth, verbose = verbose) : argument "oauth" is missing, with no default`

It seems very strange to see both of these errors at once, especially because `getFriends('jmrphy', oauth = my_oauth)` works!

I couldn't even find anything about any getOAuth function. I also noticed the documentation is a little unclear about the oauth methods, with getFriends advising to fill the oauth argument with a list of credentials including access tokens, whereas other parts of the documentation advise filling the oauth argument with the saved handshake information. I've tried just about all possible combinations and the usual suspects such as restarting R, updating packages, etc. But no luck. 

Thanks for anything you can say about this, it's an incredible package. :-)
