Trying to add this view as one of my storyboard tabs but have issue with init (no way to call it from storyboard) and when I call from tab code it hides the tab bar.

Any suggestion?
Hi,

I am very new to iOS and Swift3, I want use this library and layout in my project. Can you send a sample how to use this in Swift 3.2, I am on all latest technologies. 
Your basic blur view setup can use up to 2GB of ram and crash an iPhone 7plus from memory allocations. 

Would be cool to see this working with Swift bridging :) 

üëç good job on the objc version
