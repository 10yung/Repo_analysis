I keep getting this error when use apple sign-in with scopes (email, name)
`invalid_request response_mode must be form_post when name or email scope is requested.`

I believe that you need to pass `response_mode=form_post` as query string when you redirect to  apple auth link `https://appleid.apple.com/auth/authorize?response_mode=form_post`
OAuth.io service and website are down. I'm not getting any response via support email, hence my post here. 
what is your_app_public_key in this  case 
How do I get Twitter public key? There is just consumer key, but in case if I use it, getting `unknown key` error.
I am using OAuth-js to share images on Facebook and Twitter.

However, I am running into an issue where forcing clearCache and cache: false doesn't seem to force users to re-login.

Ideally this is the flow am after:
- user clicks share
- logs into twitter/facebook
- image is shared
- user goes back to start
- user clicks share
- user has to log in again to share

See code below. I force both but the credientails are still retained once the user authenticates. Is this correct behaviour or have i placed the calls in the wrong place? (Code is exact to my working version but stripped of app specific messaging to the UI)

Thanks.

```

// initialize OAuth
OAuth.initialize('XXXXXXXXXXX');

// clear any previous logins 
OAuth.clearCache();

// logining into twitter
OAuth.popup("twitter", {cache:false}).then(function(twitter) {
	console.log("twitter", twitter);

	var formData = new FormData();

	// add the source of the image (needs to be raw binary with type added)
	formData.append('media', Utils.getBlob(image));

	// upload image to get media id
	twitter.post('https://upload.twitter.com/1.1/media/upload.json',{
		data: formData,
		cache:false,
		processData: false,
		contentType: false
	}).done(function(uploadResult){
		console.log("uploaded media asset to twitter ",uploadResult);
		// use media ID to post to user wall 
		twitter.post('/1.1/statuses/update.json',{
			data:{
				status:message,
				media_ids:uploadResult.media_id_string
			}
		}).done(function(postResult){

			console.log("posted to twitter ", postResult);
			if(postResult.id){
				console.log("successful submission to twitter");
			}else{
				app.showErrorPost();
			}

		}).fail(function(postFail){
			console.log("post to twitter fail ",postFail.responseText);
		});

	}).fail(function(uploadfail){
		console.log("failed to upload media asset ",uploadfail.responseText);
	});

}).done(function(loginResult){
	console.log("successful twitter auth ",loginResult);
}).fail(function(loginFail){
	// if the user denies log in
	console.log("failed twitter auth ",loginFail.responseText);
});
```
in code:

` result.post('1.1/statuses/update.json',`

in chrome console:

please help with the right url, i'm confused why the slash get urlencoded

I ran into an issue when trying to use the callback method as the example is incorrect. It took me a while to poke around `oauth.js` before I figured out how the callback method actually worked. Hopefully this update will prevent other people experiencing the same pain.

I wasn't sure if this is worth reporting to, since probably I may just need to use the Google's identity provider platform for SSO from the frontend, but just for a note, it seems Google login does not work anymore with oauth-js, (which I heard was working a few months back)

I was just wondering if this is just a matter of utilising `authorize` parameter when I am calling a .popup() method, to provide the `client_id`?
Hi,

I'm trying to figure this one out. The issue I can repeat every time now:

https://www.chambresdhotesfrance.com/cgi-bin/community.cgi?do=user_signup

1) Sign in with Facebook
2) Sign out
3) Go back, and sign in again (login page, or wherever, they all use the same). 

You will find you get the error:

Error: The popup was closed
Stack trace:
popup/q<@https://www.chambresdhotesfrance.com/new_design/members3.js:1:6552

4) Clear cookies, reload the page, and it works.
5) Log out, reload page, try again... and the same error

Very frustrating. Any ideas?

Cheers

Andy

Hello, I saw two other reports of this problem, but neither other report seemed to address the popup working 9/10 times, and failing 1/10 times with "Error: The popup was closed".

When a failure occurs, I can trigger a new .popup("facebook") with no problems directly afterwards (again, with a 1/10 chance that it will fail a second time).

* Whitelist is setup correctly (as evident that the popup works 9/10 times).
* Always triggered by a user initiated click.

Will attempt to use the raw FB javascript SDK login method to see if it's an issue with Facebook or OAuth.io
