Hello there, I don't understand how to set a custom tag for a file.
In your README.md file in the example "Read/write custom tags from a specific format" you declare a variable tfile which contains the File `var tfile = TagLib.File.Create(@"C:\My song.flac");`. Then you create another object called custom which you assign a custom tag `var custom = (TagLib.Ogg.XiphComment) tfile.GetTag(TagLib.TagTypes.Xiph);`. But after that this object is never assigned to the tfile, instead you call `rgFile.Save();` But rgFile has never been created...

It seems that on Windows, performers are separated only by semicolon, but TagLib# separates performers by both ; and / so it reads AC/DC as two separate artists, AC and DC. I don't have a generic workaround; only workaround possible is to exempt AC/DC specifically.

It would be nice to see this behavior change to be coherent with Windows, or if it's Windows that's wrong in reading the metadata, provide a way to read the performers string without separating them.
It might be slightly helpful to include an explicit reference to the nuget package: https://www.nuget.org/packages/TagLibSharp in the readme.

If you just do a search for 'nuget taglib', this package actually comes about fourth.  While the top one, seems to be variation (just taglib) that is still on version 2.1.0.

targets .Net Core 3.1
Am I missing something because I can't seem to find the tag for whether the file is 360?
I found a closed issue also about unicode [here](https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp/issues/140). It says the filename was messed up. But in my case it is not.

Most of files contains unicode characters can be read properly but some cannot.

For example,

The upper text should be “怒放的生命” while the lower is supposed be "汪峰".

Using the Microsoft provided `MusicProperties` class could give me the correct unicode result but that class has a little of issue about the artist.

Is it possible to read an audio stream (webradio)?

I tried this:
```csharp
string _url = "http://www.rockantenne.de/webradio/channels/heavy-metal.m3u";
TagLib.File tfile = TagLib.File.Create(_url);
```
But get an `TagLib.UnsupportedFormatException`.
I'm trying to modify the keywords in a file but can't because the file is marked as corrupt when loading:

reason = "Size of entries exceeds possible data size"

Other tools including Windows 10 File Explorer are able to modify the keywords and taglib-sharp can read them.  What's happening?  Is this a bug or expected behaviour, that is, is this file really corrupt but other tools don't care?

The file is attached.
Just checking. I have a scenario where the speech content resides in Azure BLOB storage and some C# handler code in an Azure function which will be downloading the stream of bytes and then determine the format of the file. Can TagLib help?

Thanks,
Sau
