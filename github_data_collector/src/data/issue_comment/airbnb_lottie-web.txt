In my case, I'm gonna have a marquee like animation which I intend to change the text on the fly.
The language used is _Persian_, also.

**Is that quit doable?**
**What configuration should I preserve and obey?**
My SVG animations using bodymovin and lottie are REALLY slow on safari. They are fine on chrome, but on safari they are terribly laggy.

Scroll down to the whit background to see. Section 3.

Im using AE 2019

im trying to export a json file but bodymovin says  "Could not export files is Preferences > scripting & Expressiones > Allow Scripts to write files and access Network enabled?" i dont find these preferences to change.
Hi comm, I'm struggling with a lottie animation I created on AE. The color of the text is missing in the export of Bodymovin, does someone know how to fix this?

I have created an animation in AE using illustrator layers and when I go to render my composition with body movin no JSON file is exported, I clicked to export html link which worked but that is it. what could be the issue?

Many Thanks, 
Christian
I wonder if bodyMovin can extract or export my "180 frame" animation into **two** 0-100 and 101-180 animations.
Hence we're gonna have two different animations at the end of the day.
I'm just aware that I can play from _a point to another point_ in my animation. But in my case I intend to have **two** JSON files.
Does anyone know why the 3D keyframes don't export? I'm more experienced with AE, but not so much with Bodymovin. Thanks!

I am working on my portfolio website right now (http://pixelbeast.hu/) and experiencing issues with  high CPU usage (really high on Chrome and high on Firefox). The forrest scene in the background is pretty complex and the CPU usage gets above 50%. This is a bug or is it normal?
