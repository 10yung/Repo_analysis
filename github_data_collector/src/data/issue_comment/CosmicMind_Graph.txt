Hi, im using the latest stable version on graph im my project (i also tried development branch but the issue is there too).
Since i updated to iOS 13, i am experiencing what looks like a bad error, which i will post here:

> [error] fault: One or more models in this application are using transformable properties with transformer names that are either unset, or set to NSKeyedUnarchiveFromDataTransformerName. Please switch to using "NSSecureUnarchiveFromData" or a subclass of NSSecureUnarchiveFromDataTransformer instead. At some point, Core Data will default to using "NSSecureUnarchiveFromData" when nil is specified, and transformable properties containing classes that do not support NSSecureCoding will become unreadable.

Now some specific error: these errors are related to specific graph classes.

I have no idea on how to solve this, and where to start, but it looked like a "Hey, you need to fix me asap or i can break your app and make it unasable".
Hope you can address this in the development branch you currently are, waiting for a response from you and keep up the good work, graph is awesome.
```swift
func cancella(at offset: IndexSet) {
        guard let intindex = Array(offset).first else { return }
        let id = dm.Storage[intindex].properties["id"] as? String ?? ""
        DataManager.Shared.cancellaPosto(id)
    }

func cancellaPosto(_ ID: String) {
        let operazioneSearch = Search<Entity>(graph: DB).where(.type("Posti") && "id" == ID)
        let operazione =  operazioneSearch.sync(completion: nil)
        
        if let opeDaCanc = operazione.first {
            opeDaCanc.delete()
            if let index = Storage.firstIndex(of: opeDaCanc) {
                self.Storage.remove(at: index)
                self.objectWillChange.send()
            }
        }

        DB.async {(Bool, error) in
            if let e = error {
                print(e.localizedDescription)
            }
        }
    }

Hi all,

when switching a project to Swift 5, I upgraded to Graph 3.1.1 (from 2.2.2 and now I get complaints like):

"Value of type 'Search<Entity>' has no member 'for'"

As the Graph examples and documentation still use examples with 'for', I suggest upgrading the documentation to the new API.
When I launch the app, the database storage isn't synchronizing, but after some other launch, the database is synchronizing correctly.
I'm using iCloud storage, but it doesn't work correctly.
I've enabled iCloud in the capabilities of the project and I use Graph(cloud: "fancyName") to initialize the database and after graphDidPrepareCloudStorage I load all the data.

I didn't found any documentation for the iCloud support, where can I find it?

Any help, please?
