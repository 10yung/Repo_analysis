Currently, setting the option ConstructorInitializerAllOnOneLineOrOnePerLine only breaks after the colon if the constructor initializer does not fit in one line. This behaviour even goes against the documentation of the option where nowhere a dependency on line length is mentioned. Therefore in my opinion this is a bug.

With this change ConstructorInitializerAllOnOneLineOrOnePerLine always breaks for BCIS_AfterColon regardless of line length.
Disable output in quiet mode and no modified files.

Quiet mode is very useful for scripting, when you want just the diff format output, or none if not exist.
In case of no modified files, git-clang-format will output to screen even though the `quiet` mode enabled.

This patch changes this behavior, so if `quiet` flag passes in - no output will be available, even if no modified files exists.
Previously, `scan-build.bat` relied on the PATH to locate the `scan-build` Perl script.  However, this causes trouble when neither are accessible via the PATH.  Instead, I propose that we explicitly pass the `scan-build` Perl script found adjacent to `scan-build.bat`.  It also seems counter-intuitive to me that explicitly invoking `/path/to/scan-build.bat` could instead run a different `scan-build` Perl script located via the PATH.
If you are an accomplished programmer and you have a brain, the bazillion lines of "notes" produced by the compiler are completely unhelpful. The notes clutter the output with identically poor/misleading information and make it very hard to find the real error.

This option suppresses those notes. It is not enabled by default, so clang behaves "normally" without the switch.
