Fix issue #35 which was caused due to a an animation added in commit b46e53a35aa4053df085af10bd72cf29b2ba4fa7.
**Summary**:
I am getting a `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` error in simulator and on device, by simply selecting a movie and then going back.

**Steps to reproduct**:
1. Run application in Simulator (tested on device as well)
2. Select on initial screen, a movie to navigate to detail screen.
3. Press back button to go the list of movies screen.

**Outcome**:
- Causes a crash `Thread 1: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=2, address=0x7ffee68fcfe8)`

**Expected**:
- To swipe back and allow you to scroll and function with the application as per normal
App always crash when touching in back menubar
I'm sure you know this already

i.e adding to Wishlist while using an iPad will terminate the application
Hi, first I have to say it is a nice job. Great SwiftUI example! 

One question, are you going to implement the trailer option of the film?

Thank you!
Click itemView in ScrollView , the app got a  crash.
in  MoviesHomePage grid style , click see all
in MovieDetail  keywords cell , click title area got a  recyle push/pop  then  crash

is it the iOS13's bug ?   

UserDetaultWrapper.swift -> public var wrappedValue: T {... never sets value

the get { return ...} is called but never the set {...} so the value stored in the UserDefault never changes 
If you tap a movie in the movies tab, then tap the "My Lists" tab, then switch back to the movies tab, the app forgets that you tapped a movie and resets to the standard view.

I'm currently playing around with TabbedView in a different project and would be interested on how you would solve this. As far as I understand views are supposed to be "disposable", but storing the state of the subviews in the TabbedView itself feels wrong too...
