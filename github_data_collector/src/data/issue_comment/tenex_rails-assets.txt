@joshjordan Could you please verify if `certbot`(?) is working adequately on rails-assets.org serving machine?

[The current TLS certificate](https://crt.sh/?id=2045205205) expiry is less than 30 days away (on 2020-01-26) and ACME client should have run the renewal/unless there's different threshold.
It appears that promise-polyfill compiles to an unrecognisable JS structure.

gemfile

`gem 'rails-assets-promise-polyfill', source: 'https://rails-assets.org'`

Error thrown

```
 couldn't find file 'promise-polyfill' with type 'application/javascript'
       Checked in these paths: 
         ...
         /path/to/gem/files/gems/rails-assets-promise-polyfill-8.1.0/app/assets/javascripts
```

The contents of the promise-polyfill javascript directory is:

```
javascript:
  promise-polyfill:
    dist:
      polyfill.js
    karma.conf.js
    rollup.umd.config.js
    src:
       finally.js
       index.js
       polyfill.js

```
I was upgrading my Rails project and noticed that new versions `rails-assets-spinjs-4.0.0` doesn't have `spinjs` file at all. Here's the structure of gem's folder

But old version does have `spinjs` file

That's why in my project I have such error 
`couldn't find file 'spinjs' with type 'application/javascript'`
https://rails-assets.org/#/components/mozilla--pdf.js

docs say:
```
//= require mozilla--pdf.js
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
```

However this did not work, by digging through the gem. 
I had to do:
```
//= require pdf.js.js
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
```

Also I have come across issues post requiring this 
(`Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined`).
 I believe this gem needs built with the prebuilt 'pdfjs-dist' https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js#using-pdfjs-in-a-web-application.

Gem metadata methods have changed. Local builds of rails-asset gems were failing with an error:

"NoMethodError: undefined method abbreviate' for #<Gem::Indexer:0x000000128f04f0>

The #abbreviate and #sanitize methods were moved to the Gem::Specification class in version 2.5.0 (https://blog.rubygems.org/2015/11/03/2.5.0-released.html). I've adjusted the worker code to handle the class correctly with the current version. However, I couldn't get this to work without updating the Ruby version (or make it work with newer versions than 2.2.3 because I don't have time to track down all the potential issues). I see this PR as a minor bugfix but the whole thing should be updated to a more recent Ruby version.

I do not know if this will also fix the path/String issue described in https://github.com/tenex/rails-assets/issues/421 because I was unable to reproduce that issue locally, but I think it is a distinct possibility.

While debugging an issue with `rails-assets-espi-a11y-dialog` found that, at version 5.0.0, file `app/assets/javascripts/espi-a11y-dialog/a11y-dialog.js` does not match the source code at the same version. The file seems to be of version 4.0.1.

```
$ md5 -q rails-assets-espi-a11y-dialog-5.0.0/app/assets/javascripts/espi-a11y-dialog/a11y-dialog.js
c4b40db289c16a4bf5677f29f2196386
```

Is there a way to validate the actual source for a converted gem?

Thanks!

I've got a project called helmsman (AngularJS menu system) which I'm trying to update in rails-assets to 0.3.0. I've tried adding it to the website a few times and it never updates, ie: it's still on 0.2.9. 

I've just cloned this repository and managed to build the gem manually with the following command;
`bin/rake 'component:convert[helmsman,0.3.0]'`

So I know it works, but it doesn't work on the website.
