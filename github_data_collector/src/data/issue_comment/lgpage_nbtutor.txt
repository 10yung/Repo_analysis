Hi ðŸ‘‹ !

This is a very cool extension! I wanted to try it out and as I am one of the project leads for mybinder.org (turns a Git repo into interactive, executable notebooks) checked if it would run there. This PR is the small addition needed to make it work.

It tells binder to install the conda package, done.

[Try it yourself](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/betatim/nbtutor/betatim-patch-1?filepath=examples%2Fusage.ipynb)

If you like it we can also add a badge like [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/betatim/nbtutor/betatim-patch-1?filepath=examples%2Fusage.ipynb) this to the readme for people to try out.
I've install in my python repository

./pip --proxy=proxy.utbm.fr:3128 install nbtutor
./jupyter nbextension install --overwrite --py nbtutor --sys-prefix
./jupyter nbextension enable nbtutor --py --sys-prefix

now in a notebook I have in a first cell :
`%load_ext nbtutor`

and in a second cell :
`%%nbtutor
blutch = 7
print (blutch)
`

then I execute the code in the first cell, nothing appends

And now in a second cell, nothing happends but I have this exception (just replacing my login by ...) in my javascript console (firefox):
`Exception in event handler for toolbar_rebuild.CellToolbar
InternalError

Hi, Logan,

I liked to try nbtutor with nbgrader. This is weird issue, after enabling nbtutor globally - I am unable to make anything with cells - especially create cell below current cell (by menu item `Insert -> Insert Cell Below` or by keyboard shortcut). I am sure this is nbtutor issue, because
- at another server with nbgrader (but not nbtutor enabled) it works normally
- at the server giving trouble, after disabling nbtutor, all is as it should be.

My actual software versions you can see from nbgrader issue https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader/issues/891, which I submitted today.

Edit: link to nbgrader issue
From https://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/forum/#!topic/anaconda/45fNK2ni_so:
>(Windows +Mac OSx) When i run "%%nbtutor -r -f" the GUI does not display on the right hand side. I have installed nbtutor and no error message is displayed.
Thank you for the help.
I notice that the [original Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/) application can be used with with "Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, C, and C++" programmes, though I'm not sure *how* it actually works...

Which got me wondering - will this plugin be able to work with other kernels? If so, to what extent might the approach generalise to other language kernels too, such as `R`?


``nbtutor`` makes notebook un-usable when both ``nbtutor`` and ``nbgrader`` ``create_assignment`` extensions are enabled. It is ``nbtutor`` that is breaking things with the following web console error:
```
too much recursion
  initEvents/CellToolbar.prototype.rebuild       nbtutor/js/nbtutor.min.js:48:1
```
I can't seem to get any of the visualization show up. I think I am doing as shown in the screencast but it doesn't work. Plus I get this when I try to turn on Memory or Timeline. What am I doing wrong? Thanks.

A cell's code is pointlessly re-run again via ipython to get the "<ipython-input-{0}-{1}>" `f_code.co_filename` set and the code cached. 

I don't know enough, yet, about the IPython API to do this better inside the debugger

Also include IPython's `out[]` output.
