Hi,
I see Rgoogleanalytics is not in CRAN anymore because lack of maintenance. I use the package a lot and I am willing to support keeping the package compliance to CRAN as a contributor.

I love this libraryâ€”it's made analyzing GA data so much easier for me.

There is a bug with how caching works. Currently, the result of a query is cached, regardless of the return status. The issue is that the next time the query runs (with `cache = TRUE`), you'll relive the error code, even if the error came from rate limiting. What's more, because of how `RGoogleAnalytics` builds up the cache file name, it's not obvious how to quickly delete just the right file. This means that if you've built up a solid cache of responses over time for historical reports, you either need to spend time discovering the filename or need to delete the entire cache.

I could see a couple of better solutions here:

1. Don't cache responses with error codes
2. Add a 'delete cache' function for particular query params
3. Use a library like `memoise` to make cache management easier

What do you think?
Hi, I am getting this issue when I use the following segment and it gives me this error


query.list <- Init(start.date = "2017-11-01",
                   end.date = "2017-11-30",
                   dimensions = "ga:pagePath",
                   metrics = "ga:pageviews", 
                   sort = NULL, filters = NULL,
                   segments = my_segment,
                   max.results = 1000,
                   table.id = "ga:104288048",
                   start.index=NULL)


# Create the Query Builder object so that the query parameters are validated
ga.query <- QueryBuilder(query.list)


# Extract the data and store it in a data-frame

ga_data <- GetReportData(ga.query, token, split_daywise = T)

Error in ParseDataFeedJSON(GA.Data) : code : 400 Reason : Invalid value ' 

My segment i have followed an example as below: i am looking to retrieve (i found an  example pulls the top 10 pages for the last thirty days, for visits that occurred on a mobile device


my_segment_element <- segment_element("deviceCategory", 
                                      operator = "EXACT",
                                      type = "DIMENSION",
                                      expressions = "Mobile")


my_segment_vector <- segment_vector_simple(list(list(my_segment_element)))


my_segment_definition <- segment_define(list(my_segment_vector))


my_segment <- segment_ga4("Mobile Sessions Only",session_segment = my_segment_definition)





I have some issue withe downloading data related withe the ga:keyword dimension  (which is actually not the direct Analytics dimension, but it is displayed correct in the API explorer or other API scripts). While downloading the query based on the bellow scrip:
`ga.query.init <- Init( 
  start.date = "2017-10-01",
  end.date = "2017-10-31",
  dimensions = c("ga:keyword","ga:date"),
  metrics = c("ga:impressions"),
  max.results = 10000,
  filters = "ga:medium==cpc",
  table.id = "ga:xxxxxx")`
The data.frame returns something strange: 
`                                                                      keyword     date impressions
9668 <U+0440><U+0430><U+0434><U+0438><U+0430><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+044B> 20171001         330
`
The keyword is not the proper value. 
Hi yes I get this error despite getting the success message va the webbrowser ...Authentication complete. Please close this page and return to R.

when i then to try to get the Token : Waiting for authentication in browser...
Press Esc/Ctrl + C to abort
Authentication complete.
Error in oauth2.0_access_token(endpoint, app, code = code, user_params = user_params,  : 
  Unauthorized (HTTP 401). Failed to get an access token.

whats odd is that I very carefully copied the ClientID and Client Secret to the RScript? ..any help much appreciated and thxvm for the R scripts and packages btw kind regards Andrew 
Hi, I'm basing my code off of this setup code:  https://github.com/Tatvic/RGoogleAnalytics/blob/master/demo/data_extraction_demo.R

When I try running it sometimes, I'll get this error:

```
> ValidateToken(token)
Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = handle) : 
  SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain

```

Has anyone else run into this?  I'm new to using R for API-related purposes, so if someone could help point me to a workaround for this I'd be very thankful!
Hi,

I guess this is due to me working in a corporate environment and thus the firewall is slowing down the connection.

I am getting the following error:

```
Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = handle) : 
  Timeout was reached
```

Would it be possible to allow to set the timeout value manually?

Thanks!
When i execute the code it gives me this error, Could you please help me solve this

Error in init_oauth2.0(self$endpoint, self$app, scope = self$params$scope,  : 
  Unauthorized (HTTP 401). Failed to get an access token.
The Init function does not work when it is passed a parameter `dimensions=NULL`, and it does not work when dimensions are unspecified (i.e. the default argument is used). However on page 5 of the CRAN documentation it states dimensions are optional in the Init function.

The call fails with `Error in if (!grepl("ga:` (...) `argument is of length zero`
Hi, can somebody point me to the right direction in order to authenticate using service accounts?

Thanks
