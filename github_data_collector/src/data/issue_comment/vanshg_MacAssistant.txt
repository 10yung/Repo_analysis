This fixes #82 

Open in Xcode 11.3 and `pod update AudioKit` which updates to 4.9.3
Which has a fix for Module compiled with Swift 5.0.1 cannot be imported by the Swift 5.1.3 compiler
Refer https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKit/issues/1940 for fix

When open the Repo in Xcode 11.3 Get the following error

`Module compiled with Swift 5.0.1 cannot be imported by the Swift 5.1.3 compiler: ~/MacAssistant-master/Pods/AudioKit/macOS/AudioKit.framework/Modules/AudioKit.swiftmodule/x86_64.swiftmodule`

When I click on my account and click allow for it to use my service, it crashes. I have given a video to show what is happening.

Is there a possibility to allow the assistant to open the browser, so it can show you stuff you asked for?

Could you release a new build?
Not everybody manages to build the code themselves :)
Since upgrading my 2015 Retina MacBook Pro to macOS Catalina v10.15 Beta (19A487m), MacAssistant crashes within a second of opening it. I'm not sure how to get a log of this, but the app basically doesn't open at all, and I'm sure it's got something to do with Catalina.
Hey. Any chance for continued development?

Did You find any alternatives? Thanks.
Sorry, this isn't an issue, just a question. I tried to find a more appropriate place to post this, but I'm fairly new to GitHub so don't know if there is such a place.

I'm just wondering if there's any known way to send commands to MacAssistant internally (without audible sound). I've been trying to figure out a script to use with Text to Speech and Sound Input, but no luck yet.

My end goal is to use this withBetterTouchTool, WebHooks and/or Automator to trigger Google Home routines with Calendar events and Touch Bar buttons.

Again, sorry if this is not the place for this. Please feel free to delete post or point me to the right location.

Thanks,
Olivia

The app just crashes in MacOS 10.14.3 whenever I click the mic button to speak
