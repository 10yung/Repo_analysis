For a tutorial I updated to the newer versions of Scala/Play and Binding.scala.

I create a Pull Request for that: [Updated Versions](https://github.com/Algomancer/Full-Stack-Scala-Starter/pull/12)

Here my little tutorial: [Binding.scala-Google-Maps](https://github.com/pme123/Binding.scala-Google-Maps)
Feedback is appreciated!
In index.scala.html you include 

```
 @scalajs.html.scripts("client",
        routes.Assets.versioned(_).toString,
        name => getClass.getResource(s"/public/$name") != null)
```

which includes the ScalaJSExample.  How would I create multiple JS applications and include them separately in my views?

2. How to create a multiple page web app: https://github.com/sadhen/Binding.scala-SemanticUI/tree/another_page

Thanks to this awesome starter and @Atry 's help, starting from here, I've already used Binding.scala in  my personal project and I'm ready to use it in production

Hope it will be helpful for other Scala.js newbies!
