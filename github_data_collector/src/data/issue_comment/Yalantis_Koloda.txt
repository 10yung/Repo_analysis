When I swipe fast enough, the following error occurs：

Fatal Exception: CALayerInvalidGeometry
CALayer position contains NaN: [nan nan]. Layer: <CALayer:0x281da62e0; position = CGPoint (0 0); bounds = CGRect (0 0; inf inf); delegate = <Koloda.DraggableCardView: 0x11591b140; frame = (0 0; inf inf); transform = [9.9999999747524271e-07, 0, 0, 9.9999999747524271e-07, 0, 0]; alpha = 0.7; userInteractionEnabled = NO; gestureRecognizers = <NSArray: 0x28130a370>; layer = <CALayer: 0x281da62e0>>; sublayers = (<CALayer: 0x281da6f20>, <CALayer: 0x281da7380>); opaque = YES; allowsGroupOpacity = YES; transform = CATransform3D (1e-06 0 0 0; 0 1e-06 0 0; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1); opacity = 0.7>

Can you give me some solutions?

## A feature request

###  What do you want to add?

Currently this library realties on [facebook/pop](https://github.com/facebook/pop), which is no longer being updated by the look of the repository's static pull requests. This is one thing prevents it from being updated for supporting things like Swift Package Manager.

### How should it look like?

If the required animations were added directly to this repository (and in Swift), it will prevent any issues as CocoaPods may be phased out in the coming year with Xcode 11.

I'll likely attempt this at some point in the future, but if anyone sees this who maintains or even uses this library and wants to attempt it I'd be very grateful!

I appreciate this may not be something that Yalantis have scope for at the moment; just wanted to list it as an issue for now.

I have a date picker in My screen and the koloda view reload when I select a new date and if I start switching date continues than the koloda view crash on   reconfigureCards() 

## A feature request

###  What do you want to add?

Add `gestureRecognizer` to `shouldDragCardAt` delegate method arguments. It will make easier blocking the swipe event, when the Koloda is inside a tableviewCell, and you don't want to mess with the scroll

### How should it look like?
    func koloda(_ koloda: KolodaView, shouldDragCardAt index: Int, gestureRecognizer: panGestureRecognizer) -> Bool 


## Report a bug

###  What did you do?

I set the delegate method to the following and all is working until I use the `revertAction()` method, after that this has no effect and the value returns to 0.5
```swift
func kolodaSwipeThresholdRatioMargin(_ koloda: KolodaView) -> CGFloat? {
      return 0.3
}
```

### What did you expect to happen?

I'm expecting for it to always be 0.3

### What happened instead?

After revert action it's like it reverted to it's default value

### Your Environment

- Version of the component: 4.7
- Swift version: 4.2
- iOS version: 12.1.4
- Device: iPhone Xs
- Xcode version: 10.1 

### Project that demonstrates the bug

The bug can be easily reproduced in your demo project by just adding the code above `kolodaSwipeThresholdRatioMargin`

## Report a bug

###  What did you do?

I added a view in Storyboard and added "KolodaView" as custom class.

### What did you expect to happen?

Module should automatically be set to Koloda

### What happened instead?

The module section stays empty and the app crashes when trying to load the view.
