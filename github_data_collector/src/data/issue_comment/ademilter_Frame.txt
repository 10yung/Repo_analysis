It looks like only getting the OAuth token is not enough, we should implement it with refresh token.
Currently notification code lives under tab content side inside Vue app. Because of that, if there is an event in one hour, I'm getting the same notification whenever I open a new tab. And this is quite disturbing. I would want it to see once, not everytime I open a new tab. I think we should create a [background script][1] for the extension and check the events there every minute. (And we should use `chrome.notifications.create` inside the backround script since the Notification API won't work inside that script.)

We can communicate between background script and Vue app with that API call: `chrome.extension.getBackgroundPage()`.

We can create a background script that checks the events every minute in background script, there is a step by step walk-through here: https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_codelab_alarms (The only difference, we shouldn't use `chrome.app.runtime.onLaunched.addListener` and use `chrome.extension.getBackgroundPage()` to call from Vue app)
 
**I can mentor someone who wants to work on that issue. You can leave a comment here if you want to work on that. I can provide additional information.**

Tasks can be separated with groups. 
I'm currently using Trello on my job and home projects. If we can integrate the Trello boards with the Frame, it will be useful. In this way, our task can be synchronized with Trello. In the same time, we can complete our the Trello tasks.

But firstly #5 new column feature must be active. I'll review the [API documentation](https://developers.trello.com/v1.0/reference) of the Trello.
I think there should be an export feature. It could be download to desktop or save to Dropbox-like systems. In this way the notes and tasks are will be portable.
