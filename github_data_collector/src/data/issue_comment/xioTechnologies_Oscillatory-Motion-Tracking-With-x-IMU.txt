I try the sample data, the project works well. But I don't know if this method works for real-time data.
Thank you!
Hello, 

I see in the code that it says it "pulls" the XIMU back to the origin when it's stationary. Do you know how I could remove this feature? 

Thanks,

Hi @xioTechnologies 

I have a question regarding the value for the beta and zeta of the Magwidck/Tahony ahrs. According to the documentation, the filter gains beta and zeta should represente the bias of the gyroscope.

In am working with the BMI160 IMU and I would like to have its respective gyroscope bias too, is this error the so called Zero-rate offset?

On the other hand, how do you know/calculate the time to get an estable output of the Madgwick filtering (its convergence)?

Thanks in advance,

Regards!
Undefined function or variable 'avifile'.

I am using latest matlab version.
During execution am getting above error message.
kindly let me know how to solve the same
Hello
I'm triing to realize tracking device via arduino. 
I integrate velocity but I have drift. As I understood you use Butterworth filter in matlab to remove drift.
Could you advice what filters should I use in arduino?
Hi, 
I am having some troubles using the code. 
It works perfectly with the dataset provided, but when I use the samples obtained from my own IMU  the output does not make sense . I think that this is due to the initial condition 'Quaternion=1 0 0 0', that represents  the Earth relative to the sensor. Probably I should set my own 'Quaternion' as an argument of the MahonyAHRS function.  
If this is right,  how do I find this quaternion?

Please let me know.  :)

Hi, 

Thanks for this awesome example.
I've tried running the demo data that you've supplied in the example but I'm getting very weird results.
Can you upload a walking example on the repo please?
Thanks.
