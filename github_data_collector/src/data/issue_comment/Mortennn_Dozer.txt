On 95% of time I see the basic functionality of mac by moving icons ith cmd pressed. And with 5 times I didn't realize what happens in last miliseconds of gif.
Tired different alphabet keys but none works. It seems that either ⌘ or ⌃ has to be involved. Is it by design? If yes would you please clarify the purpose a little bit?
I'm running Dozer 4.0.0 on a Mac running 10.15.2 and I can't make the preference pane open by right clicking the white dot in the menubar on my MacBook Air using the trackpad. However, if I plug in a mouse right clicking the white dot does open the preferences. Is this a known issue?

I don't use Airplay, so I have moved the tray icon into the Dozer hidden area, but I've noticed that it keeps coming back. I'm not sure what triggers it, just that I moved it yesterday and noticed later that it was back, so I moved it again, and it's there again this morning.

This seems to be happening when I am switching to full screen apps and back.
The CFBundleVersion (Info.plist) in 4.1.0 is set to 8. In 4.0.0 is set to 29.

This results in Sparkle thinking 4.0.0 is newer than 4.1.0.
