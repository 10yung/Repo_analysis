Dear Mr Gong,

I would like to kindly ask, if it would be possible for you to add a matlab code for the side window technique for a guided filter. This would be very helpful and interesting to test.

Greetings, Frank Bramkamp.
Hi,
    I am quite interesting in your paper and wonder to check the performance on real tasks. Could you please add some subroutines of the applications mentioned in your paper like image smoothing, image denoising.  That's mainly for avoiding using your codes with sub-optimal parameters. Thank you for your help. 
龚老师您好！请问会公布sidewindow版的导引滤波吗？我最近写文章用到了导引滤波，想替换成您的sidewindow导引滤波，谢谢
期待您推出更多版本的滤波器啊^_^
会有其它版本语言的滤波器么。
谢谢!
