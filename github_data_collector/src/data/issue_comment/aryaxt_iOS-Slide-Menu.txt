When you open the left slide menu you can see all the View Controller but you cannot click on the button, like if there were an invisible layer preventing to click. 
Does anybody know why this could be happening on the new OS of the iPad? 
On iOS 12 and on iOS 13 in the iPhone, it is working perfectly


Seems like it is adding an UITransitionView, upper of everything, the problems continues even if setUserInteractionEnabled is set to no in the transition view

Hello All,
 
   Currently, I am facing an issue related to the UI layout whenever I tap on the Slide Menu Button. This issue persists in all the post-iPhone X devices. The UINavigation Bar changes the position from the top ceiling to safe area ceiling.
An issue a client of mine faced was with loading interstitial ads on top of the root controller.

The current library doesn't present a way to clean up the menu from the superview.

This function is only invoked when we switch from the left -> right menu, or vice versa.

Provided a public method that can be invoked in such circumstances that will clean up either the left or right menu (whichever is active) as well as reset the lastRevealedMenu
how to use Slide navigationController in swift 4. please help to resolve the issue
I made a small change to tracking menu view horizontal position. It's helpful to customize main view's attributes while opening the menu view
after login home page coming and click on left menu bar button and viewDidLoad is called on "LeftMenuViewController". after that click on the profile button then again I want to click on left menu bar button this time viewDidLoad function not called. How to fix it?
Fixes the Xcode 9 warning `This block declaration is not a prototype.`. See [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44473146/this-function-declaration-is-not-a-prototype-warning-in-xcode-9).
According to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9251735/cant-drag-uitableviewcell-from-its-current-position-when-reorder) problem i got the same issue. After some investigation i fixed it with [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9264749/5790492) code. 

> Same problem, but with SlideNavigationViewController. [SlideNavigationController sharedInstance].enableSwipeGesture = NO;

> In new version of SlideNVC i have to move panRecognizer property to interface and make [SlideNavigationController sharedInstance].panRecognizer.cancelsTouchesInView = NO; in my ViewController. â€“ Nik Kov 4 mins ago   edit   

So, please, could you move a `panRecognizer` property to the interface? 


Check this thread in SO please
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48018095/xcode-9-1-and-ios-11-causing-crash

I posted the solution there:
Two lines must be in **viewWillLayoutSubviews** instead of **setup** method. 
```
self.enableShadow = YES;
self.enableSwipeGesture = YES;
```
