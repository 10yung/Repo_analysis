I'm a newer in Ubuntu, when I try `make `, I met error like this:
```
npm WARN Springseed@2.0.0 No license field.

```
how to solve this?
In an attempt to start Springseed with electron from the command line, I encountered the same issue as #212.

This PR make Springseed runnable

Springseed is currently, and for a while now - been in a state for which it is not fit to be used (if you can at all use it) and while I appreciate that this is not ideal - i can assure you I want to make something you guys deserve. Springseed should be something which everyone wants to use and it should be something I have maintained for these years but life has gotten in the way of that as I have navigated college and my first year at my role of a software developer.

Springseed should be back again by the end of the year. The milestone in this issue has a deadline for the first of January 2017 and I hope to have all things completed by then for a launch of Springseed, but do be aware I might have betas come out in the meantime.

I understand if people have given up on this, and I kinda see why you would have done, but let's make Springseed something that it hasn't been for the last year or so - stable and fun to use!

I'll be making issues that people can comment on for any new features and I would appreciate comments on these new features and such as time progresses to better gauge how the functionality should be. Again, sorry for the blackout period in the last year or so.

Springseed 2.0, 64-bit on Kubuntu x64 15.10

When attempting to Connect to Dropbox, I am prompted to login (no problem there) and then provide 2FA credentials (no problem there). Finally, as expected, Dropbox asks me if it's OK for you to use my account, etc. I choose "Sure / Yes / Yep", and see a URL like so: 

https://springseed.azurewebsites.net/callback/dropbox?code=-z5xUc6OLs<redacted>

At point, the page reads: Springseed conenction broken

Next, the browser opens another page (API Request Authrorization from DropBox again with a URI like: https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fspringseed.azurewebsites.net%2Fcallback%2Fdropbox&client_id=43ze2<redacted>) every 30-60 seconds unless I kill Springseed itself. 

Same result whether I set Chrome or Chromium to open HTML pages. 

Springseed cannot be installed on Ubuntu 15.10.  Attempting to install the .deb file downloaded from the website gives me the following error:

"Dependency is not satisfiable: libgcrypt11"

The following Error occurs while trying to add a new note. The app crashes, unable to recover the lost note contents upon relaunch:

I'm trying to edit old notes. After clicking on edit icon (pencil) the page are switching from presentation to edit and this is ok. But when I'm trying to write something (or just moving cursor for desire text to edit) the page is switching to presentation mode. This happens randomly. Sometimes I can write one word or litter and app switches to presentation and another time I can edit whole text.

The title says it all, never seen an editor without this and for me just this will make me switch :/ too bad because I really liked it so far

On which application was the SpringSeed logo made in?
