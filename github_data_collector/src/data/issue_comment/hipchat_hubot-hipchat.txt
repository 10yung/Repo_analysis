Something seems to have broken the `messageRoom` method, which ends up calling `send`. Using the `=>` syntax made the bot work again. This also depends on #304 to keep the disconnects from recursing.
Hi, I noticed the latest version available on NPM is `2.12.0-6` while on github the latest version has been bumped to `2.13.0`
By default, in the latest versions of on-prem HipChat, XMPP is disabled.  Unfortunately, the ability to turn on XMPP is something that Atlassian has stated will be removed altogether in the next version.  This basically means that simply turning on XMPP is not an option.

While attempting to connect to the HipChat server, I receive a repetitive list of the following messages:
[Fri Jan 05 2018 17:29:34 GMT-0500 (EST)] INFO Connection went offline
[Fri Jan 05 2018 17:29:34 GMT-0500 (EST)] DEBUG Disconnecting here

The messages do stop after about 15 seconds, and Hubot fails to respond to anything other than a break command.

Just for completion purposes, here's the output when executing the bot:

bin/hubot -a hipchat

While I have seen a few others having password problems, I did verify that the password for the user in question is indeed known and working.  Any ideas on how to resolve this issue?
Hi
question regarding:
"From your existing HipChat account add your bot as a new user. Stay signed in to the account - we'll need to access its account settings later."

That's my first hubot on hipchat, I can't find where to add the hubot inside the hipchat account.
didn't find hubot in the integrations page  and the link in your page for adding new user is broken..
when I'm trying to create new user I can only create user with a specific email, can't see any place to create hubot user



any idea?

thanks !


Hi everyone,

I'm getting some troubles using robot.enter. Every time my bot joins the channel, the robot.enter code triggers 3 times. Any ideas?
If you tell hubot not to join public rooms it only applies at start up not when the bot is running, this way the bot will only join a room whilst it is running if the room is not public.

Hi dev team, 
I setup and deployed hubot on an ec2 linux instance and NOT HERUKO. when running the bot, it was able to connect and join the room. however when calling the bot in the room, I don't get any reply. I allowed ALL for INBOUND\OUTBOUND ports of the ec2 instance. Can you help me what additional things i need to configure? Also how does HipChat sends request to Hubot in the background if the HipChat API does not know where to send it? 

Thanks. @
See https://confluence.atlassian.com/hipchatkb/hubot-stopped-working-on-hipchat-server-v2-0-7-and-later-867181545.html

This needs to be somewhere in the README I think, or hubot won't work on new Hipchat instances.
I have been trying to devise a way to get the HipChat Room ID from the XMPP JID. I am using ```roomNameFromJid()``` to get the quais room name, but this is not the actual name of the room as far as HipChat is concerned. The end goal here is to use a Hubot clone to determine the Room ID and therefore API ID, so that the HipChat API can be used for a specific room.

This is not an issue, per se, but I would like to hear your suggestions.
hi,

In README file as below, where to define it? now the issue when I send info to bot in room, no response but there is debug info on log output, any configuration I have missed?

Scripting Gotchas

robot.messageRoom syntax is as follows

robot.messageRoom("1234_room@conf.hipchat.com", "message");
````

when I test in room, the debug info seems fine.
