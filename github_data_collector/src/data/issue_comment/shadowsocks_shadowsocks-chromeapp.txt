Can u please update this i want to use it for ChromeOS
- Prajwal

虽然现在chromebook已经支持ssr的app，但还是希望能更新这个插件
请问能加上chacha20 , auth_sha1_v4_compatible 这类的加密协议吗?

在ChromeBook上运行还可以,但是不支持chacha20 这类的加密协议,期待更新! 


谢谢
能否支持随浏览器自启动并且上次随上次配置启动一个配置文件
否则每次启动浏览器都要打开插件并按一下启动
Migrate from CoffeeScript to standard ECMAScript 6. A lot of new features available in ES6, on the other hand, it helps JavaScript programmer (but non-CofeeScript programmer) to contribute.

If it seems okay, I can submit a pull request to keep JavaScript(`/lib`) code but remove CoffeeScript (`/src`). The second stage, I propose, is to use asynchronous `promise` to gain speed boosts. 

not sure if this could be useful. travis ci can upload compiled zip so people can skip the compilation themselves.
I could try to make a working .travis.yml

Much faster than JS library and supported well by Chrome.

However, AES-CFB is removed from W3C draft and not supported by Chrome :(
