JetBrains has just released a new open-source font called [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono).

I was asked in a powerline [issue](https://github.com/powerline/powerline/issues/2052) to report this here. I'm running Ubuntu 18.04 with regolith. After `apt install fonts-powerline` a lot of fonts didn't show up, so I had to install manually from the repository, but even after that the pause symbol in the spotify segment would not load, so I ended up manually declaring it. 
Hi Community,

# Objective
I would like to introduce one line copy and paste way like `nvm` install script for those non-window users. As the original section requires multiple lines to copy and paste.

Here are my idea and a simple sh script. Hope this idea can save time for developers when they are setting up a new environment.

How do u think?

# power-line-fonts
```console
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/powerline/fonts/master/get-fonts.sh | sh
```

# nvm
```console
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash
```
I downloaded the whole repo as a zip and opened the `.ttf` files in `Font Book.app`. The install prompt appears but after clicking "Install Font", no fonts called "Anonymous Pro for Powerline" or "Anonymice Powerline" are listed anywhere, and the font called "Anonymous Pro" is missing the additional glyphs.
that would probably be helpful if one has no font manager or so
The fonts are in the public domain.

Thank you for your work!
Hi,

I used Fedoras package manager DNF to install powerline-fonts, but the fonts don't appear in my fonts list?

Any idea what could be causing this?
