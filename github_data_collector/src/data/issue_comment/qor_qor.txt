I'm about to start a new project, and I would like to use QOR features, specially the admin dashboard. Will this work with the Go ORM code generated from [SQLBoiler](https://github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler)? 

Hello!
I have a small question. In my project I want to get in the admin records from an external database. I get this data from Grpc. How can I draw them in the admin panel?

```
	r := adm.AddResource(&models.Notification{})

	r.FindManyHandler = func(result interface{}, context *qor.Context) error {
		getNotification := notificationGRPC.GetNotificationsReq{}
		res, err := notificationAccess.Client.GetNotifications(notificationAccess.Ctx, &getNotification)

		if _, ok := context.GetDB().Get("qor:getting_total_count"); ok {
			*(result.(*int)) = len(res.Notifications)
			return nil
		}

		var notificationViews = make([]models.Notification, len(res.Notifications))
		for i, v := range res.Notifications {
			n := models.Notification{}
			n.Title = v.Title
			notificationViews[i] = n
		}
		result = &notificationViews
		return nil
	}

```

```
type Notification struct {
	Title     string `json:"title"`
	Text      string `json:"text"`
	Type      string `json:"type"`
}

```

So I heard some company is using this so I come to take a look.
You have nice stars on github....mmm ok, let's see "Get Started"

the first thing that you do is copy paste the main.go file
and that file has 

"github.com/qor/qor"

unused import! so from the start the compiler will complain.

removing it gives

importing it for sides effects just starts and ends the server

### Can you please update the "Get Started" page so new developers like me can start using whatever you're selling ....


I have searched in google for documentation or learning video or more example about qor-auth
but I found nothing
unfortunately qor-admin without qor-auth is unusable ! 
can any body make video or something else about using
qor/auth with qor/admin
and qor/auth-them

can I use qor-admin with another auth plugins?

Hello It is more question than issue: 
I am trying to implement custom Resource that reads the data not from DB but from some customzied source: it implements `FindManyHandler` and `FindOneHandler` callbacks . And everething is fine but I can not find a posibility to use a general paging data like offset and page number and must reimplement the logic from 

https://github.com/qor/admin/blob/master/searcher.go#L251

in my FindManyHandler to have a pisibility to use paging . otherwise i can not extract this info from current context .

i have changed qor admin to propagate paging data the same way as You are propagating 

`	context.SetDB(db.Model(s.Resource.Value).Set("qor:getting_total_count", true))`

but may be there is a more elegant solution for this
