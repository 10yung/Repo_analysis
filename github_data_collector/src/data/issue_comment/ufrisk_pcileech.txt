I am wondering if there is a reference or piece of code I can look at that can help me get a base address of a process running on target computer using pciscreamer r02? The code I am looking at uses an old version of the project and the function is no longer valid it seems. I just want to add some offsets to the base address so I can read and write to some parts of the memory. 
Since this question is asked multiple times (#70) and I am curious about this as well, I researched it a little bit and came across several resources (i.e. research papers):

"Detecting Peripheral-based Attacks on the Host Memory": https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/bitstream/11303/4494/1/stewin_patrick.pdf

"Can Hardware Performance Counters be Trusted?": http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~mckee/papers/iiswc08.pdf

Hi,

I'm working on a demo of pcileech + PCIeScreamer R02 on an hp elitebook laptop running Win 10 1809/10.0.17763. The whole rooting process was working perfectly yesterday until today when I tried to reharse my demo, and it doesn't work anymore.

Symptoms: pcieleech works normally with patching, e.g. I was still able to dump memory, probe memory and run `patch -sig stickykeys_cmd_win`. Pcileech consistently fails to install the KMD:

```
root@xxxx:~/pcie/pcileech/files# ./pcileech wx64_pscmd -kmd WIN10_X64

KMD: Code inserted into the kernel - Waiting to receive execution.
^C
```

Sometimes the target kernel BSOD's or freezes but most often nothing happens. I've tried with the windows version, both 4.3 and 4.2 versions give the same results. I wanted to go the ntfs.sys way but it looks like this one is not available on more recent windows versions.

I'm still baffled why it worked yesterday and not today. I tried removing/adding windows patches, verifying the wiring, trying from my linux computer, with/without power plug, changing the pcie flat cable, tried with WIN10_X64_2 (fails too).

Right now I'm updating to Win 10 1903, hoping this would change something. I have another laptop with 1903 where the attack works.

Any idea of possible problems I have overlooked?

Thanks


Hi Ulf, I've flashed my PCIeScreamer R02 with pcileech_pciescreamer_xc7a35. My target machine and analysis machine are separate devices, both running Windows 10. The PCIeScreamer shows up correctly in the target machine's device manager. When I run a probe, it does detect my 16GB of RAM, but fails to read every single page:

```
> pcileech -device fpga -v -vv probe

DEVICE: FPGA: PCIeScreamer R2 PCIe gen2 x1 [400,0,750] [v3.4,2500]

Memory Probe: Completed.
```
On some boots I've noticed it only seems to detect 4GB (progress reports 4096 / 4096, and 1048576 failed pages) but I'm not sure if that is relevant.

Other commands such as display fail as well:

```
> pcileech -device fpga -v -vv display -min 0x1000

DEVICE: FPGA: PCIeScreamer R2 PCIe gen1 x1 [400,0,750] [v3.4,2500]

Memory Display: Failed reading memory at address: 0x0000000000001000.
```

I've tried reflashing the board, and also reseating it in different slots (x1 and x16) with no changes.

I double checked my BIOS configuration, I disabled IOMMU and SVM Mode (virtualization) early on but there are other options that may be relevant (the 4GB memory option under PCI settings looks interesting but does not seem to have any effect) The board is an msi b450 tomahawk, here are some of the relevant options:

Any suggestions to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Hello,

I am very interested in using the Total-Meltdown vulnerability as memory-acquisition method.

Some questions i have are:

- The meltdown vulnerability was only for Intel as far as i know. Is the totalmeltdown also for AMD processors?

- Is it possible to use it in virtual machines or does it need to be a physical PC?

- How could one obtain that specific windows 7 version?
Hello, in the release notes is written that experimental feature user mode injects are added. Does that mean dll-injection?
Hi

I am using the ac701/ft601 platform, and it seems I have successfully flashed the device. I am running the toolkit on a windows pc.

When trying to run any pcileeh command it just returns - “PCILEECH: Failed to connect to the device”.

Any idea how I can go on and debug the system?

Thanks!
Hey,
i'm trying to follow the guide for this project.
I'm using AC701 board and the FT60x usb 3.0 convector. After i build a bit file and programmed the device (all seems about right) i tried running a few commands from the pcileech.exe and got the error about the FTDI FTD3XX.dll missing error. i have downloaded and added them and then the message changed to 
"FPGA: ERROR: Unable to connect to usb/ft601 device [0, v0.0, 0000]
PCILEECH: Failed to connect to the device"
i got this messages when running the  "pcileech.exe kmdload -kmd win10_x64 -device fpga -v" command i saw on another issue online.
how can i verify the connection to the board? (in order to verify the cable is fine or the converter)
i didn't saw anything regarding this error online so i'll be thankful for any advice or solutions :)
Thanks!! 
hi ufrisk
I used pciescreamer R02,When i running pcileech under Windows, everything was fine.

and I compiled pcileech,leechcore,ft60x under the raspberry pi

Once an pciescreame device is inserted the driver will create a device object in /dev/ft60x0

when i run  "./pcileech kmdload -kmd win10_x64"

give me "PCILEECH: Failed to connect to the device."

what's wrong?

By the way, how do you run pcilceech on Android, like linux? Also use ft60x?

Waiting for a reply. Thank you.

I am using a SP605/FT601with a PCIe to M.2 Key adapter on a Laptop.
Pcileech is version 3.7.0 and the SP605 firmware is: 2.2
Host machine is Linux and target OS is Win 10.0.17134
VT-d is disabled in BIOS
If I stop the boot at the boot menu I am able to read memory.
However if I attempt to do the same on the Win 10 sign in screen I get a lot of these errors:

**Device Info: FPGA: Bad PCIe TLP received! Should not happen!**

Do you have any idea what might be causing this and a possible mitigation ?
