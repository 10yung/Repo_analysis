I removed the line about the MathOptInterface version this notebook is based on since we are not directly using MOI anywhere. I hope that's ok.

Some of the links are broken due to pages being moved or deleted over time. Here are some I have found till now:

- [ ] Missing figure in Chiwei Yan - Cutting Stock
- [ ] Author website link in notebooks by Shuvomoy Das Gupta
Credits to original authors can go inside the notebooks.
Opening this to keep track of notebooks which haven't been updated yet for the big renaming in JuMP 0.13.
Ping @Shuvomoy 

It would be nice to have some sort of tests on the notebooks to make sure they produce the expected output and don't suffer from bit rot over time. 

You can embed metadata in .ipynb files. I added a "keywords" entry to the DualNumbers notebooks. Is this useful? How can we make the notebooks indexable and searchable?

Develop a policy for licences, what we accept, recommend, etc. Creative commons is applicable to documentation and educational materials, but not applicable if the notebook contains code itself that is meant to be reusable.

- Berkeley nonlinear
- IAP2015
- NRM example

Don't have a TSP one as a notebook I think, but we should.
