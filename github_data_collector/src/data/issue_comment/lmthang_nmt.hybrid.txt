I read this paper and I am trying to implement a model which also use the mixture of character and word embedding. I wonder how to handle the relation between character and word embedding.
What I know is that when we input a source sentence to the neural network, there may be an unknown word in it or it maybe not. When we input a sentence that does not have an unk, its embedding would be directly from a lookup table. And the parameters of the character-level encoder does not have  effect on the training objective. Then should I use the gradient that is calculated from this sentence to update the parameters of the character encoder?
How should I update the parameters of the character encoder? 

Hi. I like this code but i am not an expert in Matlab. Please i would like to have this implementation in Pytorch for more comprehension as Developer. Thanks in advance. 
Will the `NMT` integrated in the `CoreNLP` codebase in java? This would help to use the pre-trained models as other CoreNLP models and to train new models as well using the current codebase and java utilities.

Thank you.
Hi,

I could train a new hybrid model without any error messages. But when using the `./scripts/2-test.sh` the following error message appears at the end:

```bash
# Loading data src from file data.hybrid.50/id/test.mk
  src 1:Во петокот <unk> <unk> многу православни Срби се подготвија за <unk> со <unk> на <unk> со желби за добро здравје, среќа и богатство.
  src end:Овој закон во пракса ќе направи да биде невозможно за поголем број од вкупно повеќе од <unk> партии во <unk> да учествуваат на изборите.

  tgt end:The new legislation would effectively make it impossible for the <unk> of Bulgaria's more than <unk> parties to participate in the polls.
