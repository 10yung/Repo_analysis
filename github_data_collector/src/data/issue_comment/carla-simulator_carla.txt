Hi,
Thanks for your work. I'm currently working with Carla 9.0.6 and I was wondering if the minimum value generated by depth sensor can be modify because it seems to be always equal to 3, is it correct?
Max value 1000 and minimum 3.

Thanks,
Best regards

Is it possible in CARLA? I only see the option for setting the FOV, but not the exact camera matrix itself. Or the distortion

**Version**: 0.9.7
**Platform**: Linux (Probably all platforms, but I cannot test)

There seems to be an issue with the way "framerate" is set with the `config.py` script found in the util folder of the PythonAPI. Specifically, when setting the value to 0, in order to regain the variable framerate of the server an error occurs. 

> Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "../util/config.py", line 251, in <module>
    main()
  File "../util/config.py", line 222, in main
    if settings.fixed_delta_seconds > 0.0:
TypeError: unorderable types: NoneType() > float()

This same error occurs when trying to use `-delta-seconds` or the "default" flag, `-d`. The only way to recover variable framerate seems to be restarting the server. It also seems that the `-benchmark -fps=xx` flag for `CarlaUE4.sh` does not set the framerate for the server. Maybe this was removed from previous versions? Is there a full changelog for releases to help with determining the breaking changes?

Lastly, this may need to be a separate issue, but when setting the framerate for the simulator, only certain dynamics seem to change appropriately. For example, it seems the water ripples, spectator camera controls and even vehicle controls are influenced by the framerate. However, the ephemeris model (or sun dynamics) is unchanged by the framerate/simulation time. I'm sure there are other dynamics that may not change appropriately, but I haven't had a chance to dig any further.
#### Description
PythonAPI content is now indexed correctly. 
PythonAPI documentation has been updated. The following classes have been modified: 
- carla.Actor
- carla.ActorAttribute
- carla.ActorAttributeType
- carla.ActorBlueprint
- carla.ActorList
- carla.ActorSnapshot
- carla.AttachmentType
- carla.BlueprintLibrary
- carla.BoundingBox
- carla.Client
- carla.DebugHelper
- carla.Location
- carla.Rotation
- carla.Transform
- carla.Vector2D
- carla.Vector3D
- carla.WeatherParameters
- carla.World
- carla.WorldSettings
- carla.WorldSnapshot

Fixes #  

None. 

#### Where has this been tested?

  * **Platform(s):** Linux 18.04.3
  * **Python version(s):** Python 2.7.17 and 3.6.9
  * **Unreal Engine version(s):** 4.22

#### Possible Drawbacks

Visualization issues may arise. 
Should be examined within a few time to check misprints and look for improvements.

Hi,

In the current version of Carla 0.9.7 the new Traffic Manager is not able to connect to a remote server, only to a local server (localhost). That is because in code a 'localhost' is used for the connection.

If you change that 'localhost' with the IP where the server is, the traffic manager can connect. That means that then we need to compile again with 'make PythonAPI'.

The line to change is: 

https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/73f91e0bfc7ca7c8ec65357600becb1cdd80fc10/LibCarla/source/carla/trafficmanager/TrafficManager.cpp#L115

I use manual_comtrol.py. How do I set the first appearance of a car to any location? Help me
Hello there, simple question.

Is there any example that I can build on top of to record 3D-LiDAR like data on the simulator. I'd like to collect a static-scene dataset to work with 3D Laser scans.

I tried to look in the documentation but there are no examples, and the ones provided in the distribution are too big to just hack and go.

I've searched for `point_cloud_example.py` but it looks that it has been removed from the latest distributions.

Thanks a lot!
carla ver0.9.6

manual_control_steeringwheel.py is used.
I want to increase the number of pygame windows to 3 as I want to actually drive.
I want to use three monitors to see not only the front but also the left and right. Is there a way? Help me.
Hi,

Im new to carla but trying to build a map that can support a 30 min drive an oval track would work i dont have access to roadrunner (i wish i had so easier..) so i started with town4 tried to extend the long straight i was doing ok till i tried to use it to see the result event if it wasnt done.. well it didnt load... i saw a video the guy was using a racetrack generator object that was making the process a lot easier.. i find in the carla doc its missing a lot of step by step and the full process even if that would build a simple track just wish roadrunner wasnt costing that much.. any help or video or anything to put me on the right track ?

thanks a lot !
To reproduce, in a town with bridges, driver under a bridge, e.g. in town04,
we can see that the ceiling below the bridge is marked to class 6 with is a lane marker,
although the other side is a road(class 7), we may not prefer to define them as class 6.
