This package depends on `meteorhacks:unblock` which breaks with `fibers` 3.x as included in meteor 1.8.1+

As this package seems to be unmaintained, are there are active forks the community should be aware of?
"Oops, looks like there's no route on the client or the server for url: "http://localhost:3000/." 
it added to the bottom of every page in the project after updating meteor
I want to do some my own logic (bulk create data) when user click the 'submit' button.

but it seems the view is generated by autoform, i don't know the template name for the creation page. e.g. Template.templateName.events({.....})

i tried to add the AutoForm.hooks in Collection, but it's not working.

What can i do? Thank you
Hi, I'd like to know how to modify the left sidebar: for example I don't want to let the option "New" for the Posts bar.

Hi! 
Great package, thanx for sharing!

I want to add a 'subadmin' to administrate their subset of users collected inside a specific ROLES group. So I made my first user a 'superadmin' in Roles.GLOBAL_GROUP to make it administrate them all.

```
superadmin (also admin in Roles.GLOBAL_GROUP)
    admin A (in Roles.GLOBAL_GROUP and in a custom group)
        user 3 (some role in a custom group)
        user 4 (some role in a custom group)
     admin B (in Roles.GLOBAL_GROUP and in a custom group)
        user 6 (some role in a custom group)
        user 7 (some role in a custom group)
```

how is the best way to make the 'admin' role only get access to users of their own ROLES group? and how could we restrict acces to specific collections in the left navigation bar of the admin panel?

thnx!!!
Hello!

I am very happy with using this package as an admin panel in my project.
In my project, I have been using aldeed:collection2-core and npm package simpl-schema since aldeed:collection2 is deprecated.

When I installed this packages in project, I got the following error message:

`W20170902-02:37:05.014(8)? (STDERR) Error: Invalid definition for pick field.

I noticed this happened by collection2 package installed as an dependency of meteor-admin.

How can I solve this problem?

Thanks
Hi, I want to build a n app and i am looking at using this package to build my admin.
Is it still being maintained or it is near it's end?

Thanks

i'm first time in yogiben admin ,i want to hide the menu from left side bar if user not in the role "sale" or "document",Example .  so how can i do ? or have other library for this one.
Hey @yogiben, thanks for the awesome admin module! What would be the best strategy to change the default table length? 10 is quite low and makes one click around too much..

Best,
Kris
