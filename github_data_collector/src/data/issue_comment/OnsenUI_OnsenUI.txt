<!--
The issue list of this repo is **exclusively** for bug reports and feature requests. For simple questions, please read the docs (https://onsen.io/docs/guide/js/), or ask a question on Discord (https://discord.gg/JWhBbnE) or the forums (https://community.onsen.io/).

Reporting a bug?
================
Where possible, you must provide a working demo where the issue is reproduced. In order to quickly do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to https://onsen.io/playground/
2. Select a framework and a template
3. Modify the template until the issue is visible
4. Hit "Report an issue" button to open Github issue page. You need to be logged in on Github.

This uses the latest release of Onsen UI. In case the issue is not reproducible in desktop browsers, just follow the previous steps and also modify the platform version at the end (you can also open the mentioned site on a device).

If you cannot reproduce the issue on the Playground, please fill out the template below with as much detail as possible.
-->

__Environment__

Onsen UI Version:
- 2.10.10

Framework:
<!-- e.g. Vue 2.5.0 -->
- react 16.8.6

Framework binding:
<!-- e.g. vue-onsenui 2.5.1 -->
- react-onsenui 1.11.2

Additional libraries:
<!-- e.g. jQuery 3.3.1 -->
- 

Platform:
<!-- e.g. Android 8.1 Cordova, iOS 11.3 Safari, Windows 10 Chrome -->
- cordova-ios 5.1.1

__Encountered problem__
<!-- Outline the behaviour you're seeing, and what you would expect to see -->
I build a smartphone app with onsen, react on cordova for iOS and Android. On all iOS devices I encounter very bad touch sensitivity when tapping on any HTML `<input>` or `<textarea>` element.  Meaning you need to tap multiple times (3-6 times) on the inputs to focus them in order to type.

On Android it works like charm. When calling my app via iOS Safari (not in the cordova container) it also works nice and smooth.

As a workaround I added touch handlers on the inputs parent elements to extend the hitbox of the inputs. This works OK but has horrible side effects on certain devices (also new iPhone 11 on iOS 13.3)

I didn't find any similar issue and also nothing in the docs how to use inputs properly for a touch device.

__How to reproduce__
<!-- Write a detailed step-by-step on how to reproduce your issue -->
 1. Setup a sample app with the library versions from above
 2. Insert an input field
 3. open the app on mobile safari or better build a cordova app and run it on an iOS device

I build  an application with osen and Angular and after packing on Cordova I am having bad display problem with the following devices.

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

postcss-apply was also added since postcss-preset-env does not support
the @apply rule:
https://github.com/csstools/postcss-preset-env/issues/50
Hi,

Just something to be aware of. If you substitute class-based state for `useState` in react and attempt to use it to store your `routeConfig` you'll get an outdated version of the route stack resulting in a "page stack is empty" error and a blank page when trying to pop a page.

This can be fixed by using a functional state update but it's quite a difficult issue to reason out. 

e.g. this will fail:
```javascript

  const [routeConfig, setRouteConfig] = useState(RouterUtil.init([{
    component: Home,
    props: {
      key: 'home',
      pushPage: (...args) => pushPage(...args)
    }
  }]))

  const popPage = (options = {}) => {
    const config = RouterUtil.pop({
      routeConfig,
      options
    })
    setRouteConfig(config)
  }
```

However, changing the popPage function to this will work:
```javascript

  const popPage = (options = {}) => {
    setRouteConfig(routeConfig => {
      const config = RouterUtil.pop({
        routeConfig,
        options
      })
      return config
    })
  }
```
