After render the JSON ÔºåCan I edit on the webpage  such as modify some key's value and I can save the modify to the original JSON data

This pull request adds backers and sponsors from your Open Collective https://opencollective.com/jquery-jsonview ‚ù§Ô∏è
  
  It adds two badges at the top to show the latest number of backers and sponsors. It also adds placeholders so that the avatar/logo of new backers/sponsors can automatically be shown without having to update your README.md. [[more info](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/wiki/Github-banner)]. See how it looks on [this repo](https://github.com/apex/apex#backers).
We have also added a `postinstall` script to let people know after `npm|yarn install` that you are welcoming donations (optional). [[More info](https://github.com/OpenCollective/opencollective-cli)]
You can also add a "Donate" button to your website and automatically show your backers and sponsors there with our widgets. Have a look here: https://opencollective.com/widgets

  P.S: As with any pull request, feel free to comment or suggest changes. The only thing "required" are the placeholders on the README because we believe it's important to acknowledge the people in your community that are contributing (financially or with code!).

JSON Viewer chrome extension, shows the JSON path on hover, is there a way to get the same in this ?

I'm including this in an application that has clean-css as part of its build process. When building a production build the build process get clean-css to "throw on warning" which is designed to prevent any issues with CSS unknowingly getting through to the production build (I guess). 

It has started failing on jquery-jsonview because the css file has a sourceMappingUrl definition at the bottom of it but there is no sourcemap actually provided https://github.com/yesmeck/jquery-jsonview/blob/master/dist/jquery.jsonview.css#L56

I don't know if it's easy in your build process to just remove this comment line but if you could point me in the right direction I might be able to take a look with a PR if I get a chance. 
Should not create inner logic if collapsed:true is given, should initiate inner logic only when tree is collapsed. (only on click)

Currently if you get the content of the DOM element processed by JSONView it includes the - (dash) for toggling nodes. Would be really useful to get back the clean object though, say, `JSONView('json')`.
