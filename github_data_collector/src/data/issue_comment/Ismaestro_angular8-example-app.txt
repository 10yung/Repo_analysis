> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

**Describe the bug**
When hero details page is entered directly in the browser the page is breaking in multiple places.
Moreover javascript is not working in entire page

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. run the project with npm run build:ssr and npm run serve:ssr
2. Copy and hero details page link by copy link address
3. Open that in a new tab
4. Now do a empty cache and hard reload
5. Page will break

**Expected behavior**
It should load the page just like when it is open from the home page. On performing hard reload in every page application should work as expected but in this page hard reload is breaking its layout and functionality

```
Demo app is rendered on server and page source shows it too. It is not just
` <app-root>...spinner</app-root>` and kinda runs with JS disabled
But I cloned the repo, ran npm  install  and npm run deploy , deployed page is just a normal SPR.
**Describe the bug**
Content Security Policy is not implemented properly due to many things, e.g. usage of 'unsafe-inline' for CSS & scripts. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/angularexampleapp.com

**Expected behavior**
Some of the CSP things could be added, examples would include `frameAncestors: ["'self'"],`, removing `"'unsafe-infline'"` from `scriptSrc`, setting `upgradeInsecureRequests: true` for blocking loading of active/passive content over insecure FTP/HTTP.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: any
 - Browser: any

**Additional context**
Due to Angular's Universal inline CSS rendering we actually can't achieve 100% CSP, so the `"'unsafe-inline'"` for CSS must be there, but others could be improved based on the Mozilla Observatory scan.

It would be useful to show how you would approach pre-rendering.

Thank you
