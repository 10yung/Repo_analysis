Hi @maxime,

Thanks for contributing this library, and for linking to it in [your answer on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15448149/googlemaps-gps-location-is-always-offset-in-china). That answer was deleted on the grounds of SO's policy requiring more explanation than simply a link to the solution, but [I managed to get it undeleted](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/289411/first-timers-answer-pointing-to-open-source-code-and-disclosing-affiliation-de).

To satisfy SO policies though, would you be able to edit your answer and explain a bit more about how it works?

Thanks,
Dan

Or do I need to use [eviltransform](https://github.com/googollee/eviltransform/issues/6) for that?
