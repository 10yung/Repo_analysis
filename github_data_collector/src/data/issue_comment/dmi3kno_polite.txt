- Function for creating turn-key scraping bots within docker container: accepts url, how often it should be monitored, where to save results (DB, s3bucket).

- is there a need for “polite POST”?

- can it be extended to enforcing polite behavior on server side, i.e. running alongside, say, plumber or shiny (other R operated web services)?

- could there be python project based on [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/), [`ratelimit`](https://pypi.org/project/ratelimit/), and memoization with [`functools.lru_cache`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache)
