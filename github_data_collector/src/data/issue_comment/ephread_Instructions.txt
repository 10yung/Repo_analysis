After I updated to xcode11, the new build system didn't work. An error occurred with below message
"Multiple commands produce '~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/LIKE-hgpysltcapxaaqbkjnoggrxhteud/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/xxx.app/Assets.car' "

I think the reason is "s.resources = [ "Instructions/**/Assets.xcassets"] " in podspec file, which will lead pod create a copy script like this "${PODS_ROOT}/TrueSDK/TrueSDK/External/Assets.xcassets". And the name of "Assets" is multiple with the main target's image xcassets.

I think you should remove the "s.resources = [ "Instructions/**/Assets.xcassets"] ", and put the Assets.xcassets into the "resource_bundles" tag, which will create a bundle to fold the assets.xcassets.
**Describe the bug**
 When I was using 1.2.0 and Xcode 10.2 it was working fine. As I switched to Xcode 11.2 and 1.4.0 version of Instruction. I found a crash while assigning a delegate to CoachMarksController instance.   

**To Reproduce**
Assign a delegate to an instance of CoachMarksController. In Xcode 11.2

**Expected behavior**
 It should display coach mark views smoothly.

**Environment:**
 - Xcode: 11.2
 - Device:  e.g. iPad 9.7- inch 
 - iOS version: 13.2 
 - Dependency Manager:  Carthage  


**Describe the bug**
When I use this line, 
`self.coachMarksController.start(in: .window(over: self))`
New Version of 11.1 is showing the following error:
`Value of type 'CoachMarksController' has no member 'start'`

**To Reproduce**
In the previous version of Xcode, it was working. But not working in Xcode 11.1

**Expected behavior**
I have seen inside CoachMarksController class. start method actually exists. But still, Xcode is showing this error message.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I need Dark Mode support for your framework. 
Is not a problem... but is nice to have

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Well, a good way is just to have a flag to disable dark mode, but by default, this should be supported.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Access to setup the background colors

Updates Package.swift in order to work as a iOS dependency via SPM in Xcode 11

Many people will be moving away from CocoaPods and Carthage and using Swift Package Manager (Dependencies). Can you please add support? Thank you!
**Describe the bug**
I am using the pod of latest versions of Instructions(1.3.1). There is a random crash happening which is frequent. Attached here the screen shot. The crash is on 225 line number in file **CoachMarkLayoutHelper**. Here is the code:

`let segmentIndex = Int(ceil(2 * pointOfInterest.x / frame.size.width))`

Looks like at some moment, the `frame.size.width` is 0 which makes it crash. 

**To Reproduce**
Happening randomly and not reproducible

**Expected behavior**
Crash should not happen

**Describe the bug**
iPhone XS Max - the positioning of the body view is off. It's not centered properly as expected. All other device screen sizes work perfectly. Its off by -10px.

**To Reproduce**
Create some views in views controller and run iphone xs max on simulator.

**Expected behavior**
The cutouts need to be precise without adjusting manually.

Hi there. Is there a way to configure the framework to not add an overlay? I know I can set the overlay background colour to clear visually mimic this but not including it in the first place would be preferred. Thanks!
When I use instructions on a landscape app, coachmarks are sometimes place with reference to the whole window not the safe area that takes into account the notch.
