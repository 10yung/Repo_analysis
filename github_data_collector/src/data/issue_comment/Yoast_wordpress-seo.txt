Fixes #6770

There are two methods (`WPSEO_Capability_Utils::get_applicable_users` and `WPSEO_Capability_Utils::get_applicable_roles`) added to the free codebase because they are needed in premium. In premium we call them three times in the same class. There is no need to have them in free (for now) and therefore it would be wise to move this methods to the class that needs the methods. 

To reduce complexity and unexpected behaviour it would be nice to not have this methods as public static utils. This will improve the testability. When there is need to have them available as utilities we can decided to make them act like utilities. But that is a decision that needs to be made when the situation asks for it.

### Todo:
- [ ] Move the methods to the premium class
- [ ] Stop having them public and static
- [ ] Also move the tests for these to premium
1. indexables feature build was taken from [yoast-dist](https://github.com/Yoast-dist/wordpress-seo/commit/32a2e2d3644ffdcb11390ad97a571d8c39856480)
2. Make sure that Open Graph and Twitter are enabled in SEO settings but nothing is filled in Open Graph settings.
3. Check that Author Archives are enabled.
4. SEO title in Author Archives is filled in with defaults` %%name%% Author at %%sitename%% %%page%% `.

Check author archives meta settings output:

```
<title>admin Author at Local WordPress Dev</title>
<meta property="og:title" content="admin Author at Local WordPress Dev" />
<meta name="twitter:title" content="admin Author at Local WordPress Dev" />
```

It is not expected to get `twitter:title`

The issue is also reproduced for Date archives.

### Please give us a description of what happened.

Splitting this out from https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/pull/14184#issuecomment-574139900

Users are not supposed to know what terms like "pagination" or "paging" mean. The related WordPress setting just says "Break comments into pages ..." and doesn't mention pagination at all. The current wording used in the plugin is potentially confusing and I'd like to propose to avoid terms like "pagination" or "paging" entirely. 

### Please describe what you expected to happen and why.
A simpler, clearer, wording.

### How can we reproduce this behavior?
- go the WordPress Discussion Settings and make sure "Break comments into pages ..." is checked
- go to the Site Health page
- see the related test:

<img width="851" alt="Screenshot 2020-01-15 at 09 54 20" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1682452/72419406-0e628a00-377d-11ea-8731-7c0f12e8e0a7.png">

- see the text "Paging comments is enabled"
- the current term "paging" sounds more related to computer memory management 
- "pagination" would be more correct but it's still a technical term
- a simpler, clearer, text should maybe just use the same wording used by WordPress for its setting, e.g.: `Comments break into multiple pages`


### Technical info

<!-- You can check these boxes once you've created the issue.
- If you are using Gutenberg or the Classic Editor plugin, please make sure you have updated to the latest version.

#### Used versions
* WordPress version: N/A
* Yoast SEO version: trunk 12.9-RC2


### Additional info
Checking some translations, I see in most of the cases "paging comments" is translated as "comments pagination". For example:

Original English string: Paging comments is enabled ...
Italian: La paginazione dei commenti ...
French: La pagination des commentaires ...
Spanish: EstÃ¡ activada la paginaciÃ³n de los comentarios ...

The related WordPress setting is translated as follows:

Original English string: Break comments into pages with 50 top level comments per page ...
Italian: Dividi i commenti in pagine con 50 commenti di primo livello per pagina ...
French: Diviser les commentaires en pages, avec 50 commentaires de premier niveau par page ...
Spanish: Separa los comentarios en pÃ¡ginas de 50 comentarios por pÃ¡gina ...
Dutch: Reacties over meerdere pagina's verdelen met 50 reacties per pagina ...
