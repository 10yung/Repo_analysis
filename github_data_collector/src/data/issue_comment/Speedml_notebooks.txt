I ran my dataframe that I have been working with successfully through speedml and had the following error:
sml = Speedml(data_train, data_test, target='binarytarget', uid='Id')
AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'endswith'
Good afternoon,

After "**sml.plot.xgb_importance()**" line I receive an error message: "FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'output/xgb.fmap'"

The same is after the line: "**sml.slug()**", where I receive the message: "FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'C:/ ... / ... /output/titanic-speedml-e17.06-m82.44-s84.51-f79.48.csv'".

Do you know why this might be the case?

Thank you very much in advance!

Kind regards,
first:
can we input data like this?
Speedml(Xtrain, '../input/test.csv', target='is_attributed')
in which, Xtrain is preprocessed train data.
second:
how can we parse time(UTC)  columns?

On line 124, Spee`d`ml is typed as `Speeml`
Hi, I would like to use this call:
wine = pd.read_csv('https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/downloads/winemag-data_first150k.csv')
but am unable to do so.  Other websites exposing public datasets allow this.  Am I doing something wrong?
I copy 
"sml.feature.density('Age')
sml.train[['Age', 'Age_density']].head()"
in your titanic-sulotion-using-speedml and ran in myself machine.but the ipython told me 
"KeyError: "['Age_density'] not in index""
