Hi,
This is BY-FAR my favorite notebook extension. 

But, I prefer the functionality of **jupyter lab** (multiple tabs, navigation bar and templates).

Any chance you can make this extension available for the **lab** as well  üôè. 
This will be legendary!!

Thanks!
When running in Appmode, cell in scratchpad will also be hidden. Is there anyway to ship with a different CSS file from main window so it will still show up.

Really great extension. It is more useful in Appmode! +1 for more than one cell
This PR is a workaround for issue #7, where this extension sometimes breaks if jupyter-vim-binding is installed at the same time.

It seems that whenever this extension loads before jupyter-vim-binding, the shortcuts get overwritten causing this extension to break. The loading order of the extensions is nondeterminstic, so the bug only appears some of the time. I don't know enough about Jupyter internals to figure out a proper fix, but for now, a good workaround is to wait 2 seconds to force jupyter-vim-binding to finish loading before we register our shortcuts.
For Mac/Linux users, using "ctrl-b" may cause conflict with native keybindings for cursor moving. Thanks.
How can I change the shortcut keys for scratchpad?
I want to launch the scratchpad with `Cmd+b`.
Hi minrk,
I found when scratchpad is enabled the `all shortcut for open the command palette` do not work.
I tried adding a new shortcut. Still not work.

Do you have any idea, what I did run?

Thank you very much!
Hi,

I find myself often wishing to (re-)execute a single line or expression of a nb cell. This small change adds two shortcuts which allow exactly that:

Ctrl-Shift-Enter: executes current line (or currently selected lines) in the scratchpad immediately
Ctrl-Shift-Alt-Enter: copies current line (or currently selected lines) into the scratchpad

If you like this idea and are willing to merge such a change, I can extend the docs, too.

Cheers!
Hi,

So (AFAIK) currently we have only one cell to draft with. This is great but has some limitations. Are there any limitations on running more than one cell in the scratchpad? so If you are in the scratchpad an ALT+ENTER will run the current cell and open a new one below. Is that Doable? 

Great extension, really boosting the productivity. Thanks!
This could be really useful but mostly (it sometimes seems to work) my 'run cell' command just runs the cells in the main notebook, even when the scratchpad is open. might be nice to have the option to change the scratchpad run command to avoid any interference? or
I really like scratchpad and would like to use it with my [sos kernel](http://vatlab.github.io/SOS/doc/documentation/Notebook_Interface.html) where the kernel used to evaluate a cell can be selected from a button to the top right corner of the cell. Unfortunately, scratchpad, when opened, would cover the right half of the screen and the kernel-switching buttons. 

Is it possible for you to update scratchpad so that I can move it around, preferably to the left of the notebook? Something like the toc2 panel would work great for me.

Also, I like scratchpad so much and I am attempted to make it part of the SoS frontend. The benefit for users would be that they do not have to install another extension and I might be able to stop the increment of `execution_count` for scratch statements. I am not sure if you would like this approach though.
