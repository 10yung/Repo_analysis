Whenever I open a webpage in external browser, it doesn't choose the default browser I assign, but rather chooses its own default browser.

Right click on open in external browser. The external browser it opens is a default that you haven't set. I set TOR as my default browser, yet defaults to some other browser besides TOR: Vivaldi, Opera, Chrome, Waterfox, even Falkon.

But it doesn't open the default I assigned.

- The nativefier website I natified is an public site, but it happens on any site I natify.


Why 'proxy-rules' doesn't work?
For issue [#851](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/851)

- Removed the _**nativefier-postFixHash**_ appended to the generated app name.
rcedit.exe failed with exit code 1... every website
hi 
how to store data and save login details after close desktop application with nativefier?
### Description

Name argument gets interleaved into electrum download path

### Steps to reproduce issue
```
$ npm install nativefier -g
$ nativefier -name "Google Voice" "https://voice.google.com/"
Downloading tmp-3522-0-electron-vGoogle Voice-darwin-x64.zip
Error: GET https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/download/vGoogle Voice/electron-vGoogle Voice-darwin-x64.zip returned 404
Error: Failed to find Electron vGoogle Voice for darwin-x64 at https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/download/vGoogle Voice/electron-vGoogle Voice-darwin-x64.zip
```

### Workaround
Don't use the name argument.

### Description

It is preserving the previous settings for a given URL even when you specify different ones.

### Steps to reproduce issue
Example:
1) **nativefier https://hangouts.google.com --maximize -name hangouts**
2) open the app and then remove the generated folder
3) execute the same process again with different options: **nativefier https://hangouts.google.com --clear-cache -name hangouts**
4) open the app and it will be maximized again

### Details
- Version of Nativefier: **v7.7.0**
- Version of node.js: **v12.13.1**
- OS: **Manjaro Linux**

Downloading tmp-1-0-electron-v5.0.10-linux-x64.zip too slow and it will fail,

If the URL is displayed, we can use the download tool
Not many details to add, I already configured my nativefied app with `--internal-urls ".*?"`, but the desktop notifications keep redirecting to the browser. 
Is it config-related or is it something I need to do differently in my app ?

I am using Pusher to send desktop notifications

EDIT: I'm guessing the problem comes from the fact that the notification is outside of the app context and so it automatically redirects to the browser because windows takes care of the redirect and not electron.
Does anyone knows how to fix this ? Can I handle that inside pusher ? With a special link ?
### Description

3. Launch the app
4. Log in to any Teams account
5. Once the application is loaded, refresh the page (twice?)
