On `sway version 1.2`

I have bound `$mod+[` and `$mod+]` to `move container to workspace prev` and `move container to workspace next`.

I would like next or previous to be the same number, relatively speaking each time.

In other words, if I am on workspace 1, and only have items on workspaces 1 and 3, and move a window to workspace next, I want that to go to 2, not 3.

Currently, workspaces are automatically closed when there are no windows in it. I think the simplest solution to this problem would to disable that behavior. **Is there a way to set a workspace to require manual destruction instead of it being dynamic?** If not, would you be amenable to a patch that allowed setting workspace properties to do this?

A large motivation of this is helping use 'physical' space as a memory aid.
Sway's pointer is blurry when using fractional scaling in comparison to other clients(e.g. `output * scale 1.5`). By sway pointer I mean the pointer for window resize/swaybg/window drag (swaynag is fine!).

crisp version over swaynag

It's really hard to capture on a screenshot, but a blurry cursor is a bit larger, so I guess scaling wasn't applied to it?

sway version: `sway version 1.2-9d827ef4 (Jan 18 2020, branch 'HEAD')`
Hello,

I'm currently testing the 1.3 version, and I have found a what I think could be a bug : When a popup is spawned by a `XWayland` window and I close it, Sway refocus the window that spawned the popup. Unfortunately, the keyboard is not sending any input to the window even if sway is marking this window as being currently focused.
I can reproduce this issue with several application on current release-candidate like `vscode` for instance.

Let me know if I can provide some details about this issue !

```
> swaymsg -t get_version
sway version 1.3-rc3
```


Example is that you two 1440p monitors next to each other with the right monitor rotated 90 degrees.
Currently when i move the pointer in the middle 
However, it would be great if the position of the cursor would be relative to the size of your monitor. 
Example: You leave at the middle of the central screen at cursor position Y (1440/2). You will then have the cursor at Y 2560/2. In practise this would mean your cursor would never be blocked when you move around your monitors if a monitor is adjacent it can figure out relative target position on the other end.

I'm not sure if this should be an option on the input pointer or per output.

```

* Configuration File: Happens with default configuration

Steps to reproduce:

Run the popover example code found here: https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/popover.html#menu-popover (reproduced here):

It is more obvious if you change the border width on line 46 (for the app window) to something smaller, like 10.

Once the window opens switch to floating mode (Mod+Shift+space in default config). Then click on the button to make the popover appear. Although the popover displays outside of the parent window, it doesn't seem to receive mouse events, and if focus_follows_mouse is enabled, as soon as you move over the popover, the parent window (and the popover itself) loses focus. Clicking also seems to send the click event to the window underneath the popover.

With sway 1.2.

I have the following in my configuration file:

`for_window [app_id="deadbeef"] move window to workspace 9, floating enable, resize set 1280 800, move position 1280 0`

But when I start dead beef, the window goes to the visible workspace on the monitor configured for workspace 9 (it is correctly floating, positioned and resized).

I have the following workspace configuration:

```
workspace 0 output DP-5
workspace 1 output DP-5
workspace 2 output DP-5
workspace 3 output DP-5
workspace 4 output DP-2
workspace 5 output DP-2
workspace 6 output DP-2
workspace 7 output DP-4
workspace 8 output DP-4
workspace 9 output DP-4
```

If I set workspace 4,5 or 6 it will go to monitor DP-2, but on the current visible workspace.
If I set workspace 7,8 or 9 it will go to monitor DP-4, but on the current visible workspace.

It is to be noted that it creates the correct workspace in the tab bar.

So, if I configure it to go to workspace 9 and have workspace 7 visible on my left monitor. After opening the app, it will be on workspace 7, but I'll have 7 and 9 in the tab bar of the monitor.

If I remove `floating enable` or `move position 1280 0` it goes to the correct workspace.

I hope the explanation is clear.
Right now output configuration might still be applied in several steps (several commits). Make it so it's applied in a single commit.

When playing a youtube video in firefox, the video region is continuously updated while on other workspaces.
This was discovered while running wayvnc. The FPS printout indicated that there was damage even though nothing was happening on the screen.
So, this is a weird one, and frankly might be hard to demonstrate over video capture, and I don't have a high-enough fidelity camera to try to take a in-person capture. I'm not even sure it's going to come through after YouTube gets done with it.

~~This only happens when the scale factor is integer and~~ It seems like it started around the GL_LINEAR change going in, though it's unrelated (it occurs at non-integer scales).

Note that the flickering:
- seems to only repro with Netflix (haven't had a chance to try other video)
- seems to be worse when there is more to render on the screen (and seems to trigger when I change tabs, or cause a big redraw maybe?)
- generally stops if the tab remains in focus, or I move the mouse around on it a bit, or sometimes even if I just use the keyboard to shift focus away from it

Chrome is my only XWayland client right now, so I don't have data for other XWayland clients. (VSCodium seems to be triggering some edge Intel GPU condition that keeps hanging anything graphical).

So... if you have a 4K monitor, load this video in 4K and go to 1:04-1:10, you should actually be able to see it relatively clearly. The effect is considerably more pronounced in person: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUiAoL8LAt8&feature=youtu.be
