**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When profiling template-heavy code, the symbol names are almost always clipped by the flame graph boxes. It makes it difficult to identify the hotspots at a glance, and one has to hover over each box to identify the function.

The View > Prettify Symbols feature only seems to work with standard library classes.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like a prettify feature that collapses the template parameter list of my own classes to `<...>`. Ideally, the depth of the collapsing would be configurable.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I checked for `perf record` options that could do this, but couldn't find any.

**Additional context**
None

Mozilla reported that they store their `.so.dbg` in a compressed format (i.e. `.so.dbg.gz`. Apparently hotspot/elfutils ignores these file during lookup. It would be ideal if we would include these files and decompress them transparently as needed.

Your application is perfect in x86 arch, but in embedded, it has a issue to used.
Can you develop analytics based on perf.script? Follow the steps of your document analysis to analyze the embedded perf.data, most of the time hotspot didn't work.
And many Android app can use simpleperf to get perf script, it's hard to use hotspot to analysis android app.

Did anyone try to build hotspot on Mac?
The use case is to create a perf report on a remote machine and later use hotspot on Mac to have a better gui experience. 

I've tried and stucked with the dependencies `elfutils` (I suppose it is https://sourceware.org/elfutils/). It wants gcc with `__thread` support but the one I installed using Homebrew does not support it. I wonder if anyone managed to solve this problem or found a workaround.

Many HPC admins are moving to [spack](https://spack.io/) as a package manager. It would be really awesome to have a [spackage](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html) for hotspot (and heaptrack couldn't find an issue tracker...).


I'd like to be able to right click on a function and have something that says "open editor".

That should do a shell and execute a command which passes the file name of the function to an editor command.

For bonus points, make the editor configurable with some kind of format string that allows me to insert the line number of the function.

For example, I want to be able to run
  codelite <filename> -l <linenumber>
so that it switches to my IDE, opens the file, and jumps to the right function.

thanks
**Describe the bug**
apparently the appimage breaks on systems that don't ship with Qt 5.10 or higher?

**To Reproduce**
try to run the appimage on an older ubuntu lts to check

**Expected behavior**
it should work

I need to debug power consumption issues on armv7 device with Yocto Linux. It looks like Hotspot is perfect tool for the job except that I cannot find any way to record/present battery voltage or/and discharge rate (`current_now`) .

Is it possible to record battery voltage or current, as presented in battery syfs directory, and then display it on a timechart graph?

show a warning on the summary page when we encounter accurate samples - these can have broken backtraces, see: https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/11/6/257
when dwarf unwinding overflows the stack copy, we should try to stitch the backtrace to a previous more-complete stack
