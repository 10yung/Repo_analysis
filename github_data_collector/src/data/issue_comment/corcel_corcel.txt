### Description: I can't extend user meta model to change its table..

first i tried:
namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Corcel\Model\Meta\UserMeta as Corcel;

class UserMeta extends Corcel
{
    protected $table = "wp_usermeta";
    public $timestamps = false;
}

didn't work

then i tried:

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Corcel\Model\Meta\UserMeta as Corcel;

class UserMeta extends Corcel
{
    public $timestamps = false;

    public function __construct(){
        $this->table = "wp_usermeta";
    }
}

didn't work either

This is because i'm using one only connection to my DB in Laravel, no prefixes, i need it that way.

Thanks
I hope you love my 18 character contribution! Thanks for all your great work!  :D

Since there is a way to query post using meta... is there a way to query Category using their meta ?

Just a quick fix for the PHPDoc of the `Metafields@saveMeta` function

### Description:
Using this with no real issues, but one thing is getting me stuck.

One of my post types has a Relation field with a post ID stored (like a belongsto in laravel)

for example, post type Child has a relationship pointing to Page (storing the id)

Is there a way in this package to make a query to get the Child posts of a Page ?
I don't think I can use hasMeta for this, maybe because it stores the relation in a serialized format ?

Like this: a:1:{i:0;s:3:"274";}

(the id is just 274 but acf stores it as an array as there could be many)
The method returns the first 400 characters of the main content.
