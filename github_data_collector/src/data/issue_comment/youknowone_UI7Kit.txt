I know you don't have iOS 6 devices, but do you have iOS 10 to check? ;)

Since April, I have no devices to test any patches anymore.
Because I don't think this library has many users these days, I suggest a guideline for bugs and patches.
- Any bug reports will be just archived - I don't have any way to solve it.
- Any patches doesn't look suspicious will be accepted - I will considerate real users. If there is new problems, you can go back to older version or suggest reverting.

Any volunteer - is there someone, really? -  who want to take over this project also will be appreciated.
We will watch the project together for a while and I will grant every permission.

in : _tintColorUpdated->setTitleTextAttributes

when i've set the tint color, the color to be display may be wrong. 
I think, the title state is not the 'UIControlStateHighlighted', may be the UIControlStateSelected, so the background color for 'selected' part will be same to the text color.

when i have change the state and the attribute color,  it works.

This is may my bad, so can you send the result for me?

as title

I got the following errorï¼š

```
Undefined symbols for architecture i386:
  "_FBTokenInformationExpirationDateKey", referenced from:
      -[PFFacebookTokenCachingStrategy cacheTokenInformation:] in Parse(PFFacebookTokenCachingStrategy.o)
      -[PFFacebookTokenCachingStrategy expirationDate] in Parse(PFFacebookTokenCachingStrategy.o)
      -[PFFacebookTokenCachingStrategy setExpirationDate:] in Parse(PFFacebookTokenCachingStrategy.o)
```

Base on the parse.com forum the issue is -ObjC flag. I found the only library using the -ObjC flag is  UIKit7 library. Is there a way to bypass this problem ? Thanks

I only install UI7PickerView to my project,and pick view doesn't show text. It's background is white and not translucent.

The frame is not correct when i edit the  ABPersonViewController...

Current behavior: The table view cells are white, where as the areas between the grouped table view cell sections are black and its headers and footers unreadable

Expected behavior: Areas in between uitableview sections should be white, like IOS 7 grouped table view styles.

How to reproduce this bug: simply make a uitableviewcontroller in the storyboard with a bunch of static cells and sections, and set random headers and footers. No code necessary.

Hi, You finished the <code>UI7PickerView</code>.Why no <code>UI7DatePicker</code>?We would like that.

I follow the solution to "removing the text on back button" stated here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18870128/ios-7-navigation-bar-custom-back-button-without-title

This solution works under iOS 7, but using UI7Kit under iOS 6, even the back arrow disappears.
