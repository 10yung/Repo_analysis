This is related to #316.
Two proposals below.
The proposals are not strongly tested and are for Apache only (I'm not expert in nginx).
If you are interested, I can test them better, fork and propose formally. Apache only.

If you have per directory permissions only (.htaccess):
```
# use mod_rewrite for pretty URL support
RewriteEngine On

# Backend requests
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/admin$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/admin/
# If a directory or a file exists, use the request directly
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
# Otherwise forward the request to admin/index.php
RewriteRule . admin/index.php

# Frontend requests
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/admin$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/admin/
# If a directory or a file exists, use the request directly
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
# Otherwise forward the request to index.php
RewriteRule . index.php

# if $showScriptName is false in UrlManager, do not allow accessing URLs with script name
RewriteRule ^(admin/)?index.php/ - [L,R=404]

# ...other settings...
Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride None
Require all granted
```

If you can write a complete VirtualHost configuration and want to keep separate web directory:
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName app.example.com

    # Frontend
    # ==============================
    DocumentRoot /path/to/yii2-advanced/frontend/web
    <Directory /path/to/yii2-advanced/frontend/web>
        # Use mod_rewrite for pretty URL support
        RewriteEngine On
        # If a directory or a file exists, use the request directly
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        # Otherwise forward the request to index.php
        RewriteRule . index.php

        # If $showScriptName is false in UrlManager, do not allow accessing URLs with script name
        RewriteRule ^index.php/ - [L,R=404]

        # ...other settings...
        Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    # Backend
    # ==============================
    Alias /admin /path/to/yii2-advanced/backend/web
    <Directory /path/to/yii2-advanced/backend/web>
        # Use mod_rewrite for pretty URL support
        RewriteEngine On
        # If a directory or a file exists, use the request directly
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        # Otherwise forward the request to index.php
        RewriteRule . index.php

        # If $showScriptName is false in UrlManager, do not allow accessing URLs with script name
        RewriteRule ^index.php/ - [L,R=404]

        # ...other settings...
        Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

Note: sorry, but the external configuration linked at the end of the document is an overkill and in contrast with the Apache recommendations. I filed a bug to Oleg about: https://github.com/mickgeek/yii2-advanced-one-domain-config/issues/16
### What steps will reproduce the problem?

under docs/guide/shared-hosting or similar

### What's expected?

common/config/bootstrap.php should also have paths altered from frontend to www and backend to www/admin

environments/index.php should also have paths altered from frontend to www and backend to www/admin

### What do you get instead?

Internal server error if try to run site without these changes

### Additional info

| Q                | A
| ---------------- | ---
| Yii vesion       |
| PHP version      |
| Operating system |

Lets say env1 has a file "somefile" not present in env2. When initializing env1 and then initializing env2 the file "somefile" must be removed by init script.
### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Execute `yii fixture/load User` with the following configuration:

```
'components' => [
    'db' => [
        'class' => '\yii\db\Connection',
        'dsn' => 'sqlsrv:Server=...;Database=yii2advanced',
        'username' => 'sa',
        'password' => '...',
        'charset' => 'utf8',
        'tablePrefix' => 'tbl_',
    ],
],

```
### What's expected?

Fixture's data should have been loaded into the database. If I switch to the local MySQL database, the data is loaded successfully.
### What do you get instead?

> Exception 'yii\base\InvalidParamException' with message 'Table not found: []'
