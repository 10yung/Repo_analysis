PowerShell 5.1 on Windows 10.
PSGitHub 0.15.179

The module uses the FollowRelLink of Invoke-WebRequest / Invoke-RestMethod. This does not exist prior to PowerShell 6.

Should you wish to retain support for PS 5, I wrote an implementation of this as an example. You can find that here:

https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Windows-PowerShell-Scripting-Third-Edition/blob/25406afc2395e0e5d68e3f26219a4f42b098baa6/Chapter13/2.2.4_Invoke-WebRequest_FollowRelLink.ps1

Thanks!
# Improvements / Enhancements

- [ ] - New cmdlet `New-GitHubOrganization` specifically for users of GitHub Enterprise Server ("GHES")
- [x] - New cmdlet `Get-GitHubOrganization` specifically for users of GHES
- [ ] - New cmdlet `Set-GitHubOrganization` specifically for users of GHES
- [ ] - Class Definition
- [ ] - Test Coverage

The goal of this PR is to begin implementing functionality for GHES administrators to easily manage GitHub Organizations.
The cmdlets could be used to retrieve the list of .gitignore templates and download one.
```Get-GitIgnoreTemplateList``` would contain something like this:
```powershell
function Get-GitIgnoreTemplateList {
[CmdletBinding()]
param ()
return (Invoke-WebRequest -URI 'https://api.github.com/gitignore/templates' -UseBasicParsing).Content |
ConvertFrom-JSON
}
```

```Get-GitIgnoreTemplate``` would be like this:
```powershell
function Get-GitIgnoreTemplateList {
[CmdletBinding()]
param (
  [String]
  $TemplateName
)
}
Invoke-WebRequest -URI "https://api.github.com/gitignore/templates/$TemplateName" -UseBasicParsing |
  Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content |
  ConvertFrom-JSON |
  Select-Object -ExpandProperty Source
```

I can submit a PR with the changes if this is something you'd want to include.
We need to add formatting files for object output, to ensure that useful data is displayed by default. As a prerequisite to this, we will need to build out a GitHub data model (probably using PowerShell v5 Classes), and map the GitHub REST API output to the data models.

**NOTE**: This work item is exempt form the contribution guidelines, which state "no XML." :smile: 
# Priority Work Items
- [ ] Formatting file for GitHub Repositories
- [ ] Formatting file for GitHub Users
- [ ] Formatting file for GitHub Issues
- [ ] Formatting file for GitHub Gists

We need to add operations for GitHub Gist code snippets.
# Gists

https://developer.github.com/v3/gists/
- [x] List out all Gists for the authenticated user
- [ ] List starred Gists for the authenticated user
- [ ] Star/unstar Gists
- [x] List out all public Gists for a specific GitHub user
- [x] Get a specific Gist
- [x] Create a new Gist
- [x] Delete a Gist

We need to add PowerShell commands to the PSGitHub module that support repository migration and import of external revision control repositories.
# Repository Import

https://developer.github.com/v3/migration/migrations/
- [ ] Invoke a repository migration from an external service
- [ ] List in-progress migrations
- [ ] Get status of a specific migration
- [ ] Download a migration archive
- [ ] Delete a migration archive
- [ ] Unlock a repository
