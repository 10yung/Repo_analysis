Used 1.5b 2774 on ipados 13.3.  When I save a state and then try to re-open the state (tapping on the picture snapshot) while in game the app crashes.  If I re-open the app and launch the “recent save state” it opens and runs fine.  This happens on multiple games with multiple emulators.
# Overview

Adds a GitHub action bot to automatically squash and merge approved pull requests

## Requirements

1. Code owners approvals meet setting for repo
2. Any required tests/checks in GitHub repo settings are passed
3. Pull request has the `autosquash` label

## Detail

This action runs on PR open, update etc. It will only execute though if all pre-conditions are met which are configured in the settings from GitHub.

The GitHub API has a flag called 'mergable" which means there are no conflicts, all peer reviews and automation bots are passed etc. Basically, does the PR have a green checkmark.

If so, this bot will squash and merge the PR.

## Why squash and merge

1. The history is maintained in the meta-comments
2. Squash is easier than rebase for XCode projects with Apple's shitty Xcode project format which is a pain in the butt to rebase
3. Why rebase and not merge though? The main reason is the clarity of reading history. A bunch of merges to and from developing into a feature branch are difficult to follow. The small changes are largely irrelevant once a feature branch is merged into master/develop, and in the event of regression, it's easier to find the 1  squash commit to undoing rather than tracing a zig-zag of merges between a feature branch and develop.

The current develop commit is trying to source the following url template for downloading the covers: https://img.gamefaqs.net/box/X/X/X/XXXXX_front.jpg

This no longer works as the host name has changed so the automatic cover downloads are no longer showing up correctly in the app.

The new URL template that appears to work is as follows:
https://gamefaqs1.cbsistatic.com/box/X/X/X/XXXXX_front.jpg

This new template has been tested with various titles that have artwork that is not showing up correctly in Pv anymore and results in the correct artwork being shown.

There should be overclocking support for N64 emulation, it would help some specific games run better, because with the current controls (d-pad, correct me if I'm wrong), some games really do not play well if they're dropping frames and they use frameskipping. Some FPS games are really affected by this, some almost becoming unplayable at times. If possible, try to handle it somehow in the way emulators like 1964 GE/PD and 1964 UltraFast handle overclocking. It could improve perfomance in all N64 games. If the goal is to keep accuracy, then it's not really required to implement such a thing, but it would improve playability.
### What does this PR do
This will set the device's native FPS and allow for the Emu cores to self-manage their FPS' based on their self.emulatorCore.frameInterval for a smoother sync experience. [UIScreen mainScreen].maximumFramesPerSecond will list the max device FPS for 30fps on iPhone 4, 60fps for the 5> and 120fps ProMotion devices accordingly. Should also help and work on tvOS, to regulate between 50, 59.94 and 60.0, but this is currently still untested.

(Btw noticed that the self.emulatorCore.frameInterval settings for the cores should also be revisited to report a more accurate 4-6 decimal fps, at some point.) 

### Where should the reviewer start
Check out the visual frame limiting on ProMotion devices with the Genesis Core using the scroll test on the 240p suite. The Mednafen core is not able to scale to the native Promotion FPS and is still locked to a 60fps max.

### How should this be manually tested
Swap between the old and new lines of code and check the Xcode GPU debug for reporting of the max FPS and check visually if the new version looks "smoother" on ProMotion devices.

### Any background context you want to provide
Continued process to improve the V-Sync behavior in Pv.

Any thoughts @JoeMatt @jasarien @braindx ?
hey guys,

i found a very annoying bug when emulating PSX (and i think all other platforms). my setup is as follows: iPhone 11 pro -> screen mirror to Apple tv 3 -> some projector in my bedroom. whenever i enable screen mirror, sound keeps playing but only the latest frame before enabling airplay is displayed (video stuck). without airplay mirroring, it's all good

<!--- What did you expect to happen? --------------------------------------------> 
### Expected: 

i should be able to see the output, not only the latest frame 

<!--- What happened instead? ---------------------------------------------------> 
### Actual: 

only the latest frame before enabling airplay is displayed (video stuck)


<!--- What are steps we can follow to reproduce this issue? ---------------------->
 ### Reproduce:  

1. Run a PSX game
2. Enable screen mirroring to any AirPlay device (i used ATV 3 and 4)
3. Hear sound but only see the last frame before enabling mirroring
