Notebook 3 had mixed print statements for Py2 & 3, changed all to Py3. 

My first pull so hope I'm doing this right, there are lots of edits in the comparison that I don't understand, its confusing considering I just added brackets in a few places... Wondering if its due to copies or something about underlying code, any help with my understanding greatly appreciated 
Hi,

In this notebook: https://github.com/mikkokotila/jupyter4kids/blob/master/notebooks/numerical-computing-is-fun-2.ipynb you use the 'is' keyword to compare numbers.

This should be avoided, because Python's semantic does not guarantee that '1 is 1'. In fact, in the CPython implementation, this is only True for integers lower or equal to 256:

```
>>> a = 257
>>> b = 257
>>> a is b
False
>>> a = 256
>>> b = 256
>>> a is b
True
```
decimnals -> decimals
- Translate README.md
- Add translated cover image (later link can refers to it)
This project is very interesting and I believe that it can be a motivation for brazilian students. I think that more contributions can be added if more people could understand the texts. So I propose to translate content to brazilian portuguese as it be published and suggest changes according brazilian speakers use it.
