My application need to show the menu equally by the width if total width is lesser than the total screen width, else it should occupy its needed space.

For Example:

```
Scenario 1:
Screen Width - 350
Total Menu width of 5 items - 250 (50+50+50+50+50)
Since it is lesser than screen width so my menu width need to spread equally - 350/5 -> 70

```
```
Scenario 2:
Screen Width - 350
Total Menu width of 5 items - 360 (60+50+60+70+120)
Since it is greater than screen width so each and every menu need to occupy in their own width itself.
```

Also my application supports orientation so in single view controller itself there will be possible of having two different sets of menu width.

I am using PagingViewControllerDelegate widthForPagingItem in-order to assign width for each and every menu, but problem with this is PagingSizeCache which fetch the width from delegate for the very first time and cache it. Because of this every time it stick to the same width even though inside delegate function i have a logic to change the width based on screen width.

Is there any work around to solve my problem?
I am experiencing crash on iOS 12.1, 12.4.2. Please see below attachment for error log.

Here is the way I set up: 
```
func setUpView() {
        // Instantiate
        pagingViewController.dataSource = self
        pagingViewController.delegate = self
        
        // Customize the menu styling.
        pagingViewController.menuItemSize = .sizeToFit(minWidth: 80, height: 47)
        pagingViewController.menuHorizontalAlignment = .center
        pagingViewController.menuTransition = .scrollAlongside
        pagingViewController.font = Font.Regular.of(size: 12.0)
        pagingViewController.selectedFont = Font.Regular.of(size: 12.0)
        pagingViewController.selectedTextColor = Color.Black.instance()
        pagingViewController.indicatorColor = Color.DarkGreen.instance()
        pagingViewController.indicatorOptions = .visible(
            height: 3,
            zIndex: Int.max,
            spacing: .zero,
            insets: UIEdgeInsets(top: -0.5, left: 0, bottom: 0.5, right: 0)
        )
        pagingViewController.borderOptions = .visible(
            height: 2,
            zIndex: Int.max,
            insets: UIEdgeInsets(top: 0, left: -100, bottom: 0, right: -100)
        )
        
        // Make sure you add the PagingViewController as a child view
        // controller and contrain it to the edges of the view.
        addChild(pagingViewController)
        containerView.addSubview(pagingViewController.view)
        containerView.constrainToEdges(pagingViewController.view)
        pagingViewController.didMove(toParent: self)
}
```

Here is how this library is used.
1. Paging view is init on viewDidLoad
2. I download array of dates from api
3. After I downloaded, assign reusable paging view controller which depending on dates
4. Then reload and select the appropriate controller using paging `select(index: index, animated: true)`


Did I do something wrong? The weird thing is, it's only happening at iOS 12. Not at iOS 13 latest.

**Development Machine** : Xcode 11.3
**Parchment Version** : 1.6.0
I'll use the **cities** example on the front page as reference.

If you enable VoiceOver on your phone you can select one of the cities in the menu by tapping it. By "flicking" left or right you can navigate city-by-city in the menu (typical UICollectionView behaviour). (When you have found your city of choice you double tap and that city will get selected in the menu and the page scrolls.)

The problem is that the "flicking" to go city-by-city works maybe for two or three items. Then there seems to be some unexpected behaviour from Parchment which makes the VoiceOver not going to next city, but instead jump to the next container on the entire page (typically the first element on the current page). 

Any help would be much appreciated! Please tell me if you need some more details.
Currently, there is no delegate method like `canShowPageAtIndex: `, which could prevent from scrolling to a specific page without reloading the whole datasource and removing that page completely.
In some cases,  It is useful to be able to get tab selected event even if the same index to currently selected index is selected.  For example, using it to scroll top or refresh data. so I would propose this delegate method.
when page first appears, PagingViewController only show the first cell, the next cell will appear after swipe.

i use Parchment 1.7.0. How do i fix it?
Is there anyway to hide the page menu (on the top) when there's only one page?
something like UIPageControl
`hidesForSinglePage = true`

seems PageView sets height constraint on page menu (the CollectionView) and i couldn't find a way to override that heightAnchor except subclassing PagingView and override the entire setupConstraints()
Is it possible to scroll vertically. Thanks
Hi @rechsteiner you've done a great job, this is an awesome library.

I'm facing one issue with size of Menu item when orientation changes, I have implemented `widthForPagingItem` for dynamic sizing cell but this method is not getting called when orientation changes and all menu item uses cached size(I guess). I have also tried to invalidate layout of collection view in `viewDidLayoutSubviews` but it didn't ask me for new size.

Is it expected behaviour or is it a bug? and what if I want to resize items when orientation changes? if I call `self.pagingViewController.reloadMenu()` in `viewDidLayoutSubviews` it asks for new size but doesn't apply it. can you guide me through it?

Thanks
Hi all!

I've just released and **iPhone** app with a Parchment based pagination controller. Some users are using the app in iPad in the iPhone compatibility mode and the app starts crashing for them. I'm not able to reproduce the issue but I know that _**It only happens in iPad devices running my iOS app in compatibility mode.**_ 

This is the crash trace:

Hope you can help me ðŸ¥ºThis bug is annoying me an some of my users.
