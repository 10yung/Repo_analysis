I'm using ubuntu 32bit, and didnt support chrome but chromium still support it.

or where i can change it?
F-Droid install successfully, however it can install APKs from its repository.

The error is "`This Android rom does not support ACTION_INSTALL_PACKAGE!`"

I understand it must implement system calls to `chromeos-apk` tool and register new chrome app. I think it is a important step to make this solution more relevant.

Good job! â™¥
I tried using Roblox and Geometry Dash Subzero but it would stay at the loading screen, then crash. However with 2048, the app worked fine. I thought that using mobile portrait would help, so I tried Color Switch, But the same problem occurred. I reinstalled both the app and ARchrom but nothing worked. Please help as this chromebook is the only laptop I have. Thanks!
Running 64-bit Chrome, version number 78.0.3904.108. I attempted to install ARChon in hopes of running an app, and got two errors:

- Line 5:   `"minimum_chrome_version": "32",` returned `'minimum_chrome_version' is only allowed for extensions, legacy packaged apps, hosted apps, and packaged apps, but this is a shared module.`
- Line 8:  `"arc_build_tag": "arc-runtime-38.4410.120.43",` returned `Unrecognized manifest key 'arc_build_tag'.`

I need an extension or plugin that recognizes text for example -10.35 and sends an alert in the form of popup or something that makes noise
In my app, to upload files i need a folder which is read like sdcard/download
or anyway a .ini file where I can tell to the wrapper a particular directory to point to and manage 
files inside the app. I hope this can be possible to be done.

Hello @vladikoff  I have a keen interest in your project, Archon Runtime but when i try to download Archon 2.1 x86 the download page says that "Error 403". Please tell me what to do.

Hello,

If we install Android apps with this tool, are the apps isolated through a virtual machine or LXC container?
Is it possible to run Android apps in Chromium and Chromium OS or just Chrome and Chrome OS?
Maybe this information could be added to the readme.

Thanks.
