Function `strncasecmp` returns `0` when two strings are identical. So to go inside the if branch when two string are identical the `strncasecmp` result needs to be negated. 
I had not realized, sorry for no comment.
This will allow you to see a table of serialized content (like now with json)
On a high-DPI machine, using firefox, input and select elements are way smaller than other elements (see attached image). While this is most likely a bug in the browser in combination with invalid scaling settings in gtk, fixing it shouldn't break behavior for other setups.

@vrana I have a question on line 14 of `plugins/table-structure-actions.php` that you might be able to help me with?
Adds features to export in the pgsql driver.

Partially fixes [bug#587](https://sourceforge.net/p/adminer/bugs-and-features/587/).

- export constraints (except TYPEs, to be added)
- first create all tables, only then create all FK constraints (avoids reordering CREATE TABLE statements on order of their FK dependency)

This plugin hashes a column ending with "_md5", "_sha1", "_hash" etc. which is useful for passwords.
These are functions that are extremely common names and have conflicts when including adminer with or via another set of code (example: Laravel) 

This example package creates a route in laravel that loads adminer.php

The command linked to here does a replace to fix the function issue, but it is not very cross platform compatible. There are very few options for doing this replace, none that are cross platform and efficient.

I have combed through many of the plugins for adminer and I have not found any issues with this update.
