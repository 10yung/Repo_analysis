when pager loads tableview in the first child view controller leaves space from both sides but if I switched tabs then it acquires the screen as I wanted.

here is the screenshot of a simulator for understanding:

And after switching tabs and as expected:

my whole setup is normal tableview has nothing done in that its just a view and
here is XKPager setup

        settings.style.buttonBarBackgroundColor = appBlueColor
        settings.style.buttonBarItemBackgroundColor = appBlueColor
        
        settings.style.selectedBarBackgroundColor = appBrownColor
        
        settings.style.buttonBarItemFont = UIFont.appRegularFontWith(size: 16)
        
        settings.style.selectedBarHeight = 4.0
        settings.style.buttonBarMinimumLineSpacing = 0
            
        settings.style.buttonBarItemTitleColor = .black
        settings.style.buttonBarItemsShouldFillAvailableWidth = true
            
        settings.style.buttonBarLeftContentInset = 0
        settings.style.buttonBarRightContentInset = 0
            
        changeCurrentIndexProgressive = { [weak self] (oldCell: ButtonBarViewCell?, newCell: ButtonBarViewCell?, progressPercentage: CGFloat, changeCurrentIndex: Bool, animated: Bool) -> Void in
            guard changeCurrentIndex == true else { return }
            oldCell?.label.textColor = self?.oldCellColor
            oldCell?.label.font = UIFont.appRegularFontWith(size: 16)
            
            newCell?.label.textColor = .white
            newCell?.label.font = UIFont.appMediumFontWith(size: 16)
        }

       override func viewControllers(for pagerTabStripController: PagerTabStripViewController) -> [UIViewController] {
        let child1 = UIStoryboard(name: "Home", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "childViewController1")
        
        let child2 = UIStoryboard(name: "Home", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "childViewController1")
        
        let child3 = UIStoryboard(name: "Home", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "childViewController1")
        
        return [child1, child2, child3]
    }

Xcode version: 11.2.1
swift version: 5
ios deployment target: 10.0
XLPager updated
Hi, 

I am making use of ButtonBarPagerTabStripViewController, when we click on the tabs, changeCurrentIndexProgressive value is being set first and then the viewDidAppear() of first child tab is called, whereas while we swipe, viewDidAppear() of first child tab is called first and then changeCurrentIndexProgressive value of 3rd party library is being set first. Can you please make the behaviour of swipe similar to that of click of tabs.

Thanks.
I noticed the API could be made clearer through the use or Swift's type system, and also removed the need to make an O(n) check and assert.

Since Xcode 11 includes Swift Package Manager, it would be nice to support it

I see that Settings should be called before viewDidLoad is called.
But in my case, I need to dynamically change the tab and text colors.
Is there any way to update the Style Dynamically?
How do we do that?

Thanks!
### Environment (version): 
- XLPagerTabStrip: 9.0.0
- Xcode: 11.2.1
- iOS: 13.2.3

### Description
`moveToViewController(at index: Int, animated: Bool)` is called when tap tab items, but not called when swipe to change index.
I think that this method has to be called when also swipe to change index.
Or my operation has some wrongs?

```swift
class MyPageViewController: ButtonBarPagerTabStripViewController {
    
    // XLPagerTabStrip function: add ChildViewControllers
    override func viewControllers(for pagerTabStripController: PagerTabStripViewController) -> [UIViewController] {
        let child1VC = CustomViewController()
        let child2VC = CustomViewController()
        return [child1VC, child2VC]
    }
    
    override func moveToViewController(at index: Int, animated: Bool = true) {
        super.moveToViewController(at: index)
        // This method is called when only to tap tab items,
        // not called when swipe to change index.
    }
}
```
fix type at `README.md` for setting property
Would it be possible to document a bit more how to use Segmented type with XLPagerTablStrip

From https://github.com/xmartlabs/XLPagerTabStrip#segmented and https://github.com/xmartlabs/XLPagerTabStrip#connect-outlets-and-add-layout-constraints is not clear to me.

ButtonBar is clear.
Thanks.
