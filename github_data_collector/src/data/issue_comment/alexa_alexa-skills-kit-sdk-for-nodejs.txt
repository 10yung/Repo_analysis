Hi,

using `ask-sdk-core` I have the following code for a custom skill:

```
const skillBuilder = Alexa.SkillBuilders.custom()

exports.handler = skillBuilder
  .addRequestHandlers(
    LaunchRequestHandler,
    CreateReminderIntentHandler,
    WhichBinIntentHandler,
    HelpIntentHandler,
    CancelAndStopIntentHandler,
    SessionEndedRequestHandler,
  )
  .addErrorHandlers(ErrorHandler)
  .withApiClient(new Alexa.DefaultApiClient())
  .lambda()
```
But I am getting the following error:

`Cannot read property 'apiEndpoint' of undefined` and it turns out this is because `serviceClientFactory` is empty in the `handlerInput` as a result of DefaultApiClient making an empty object?

At a complete loss here.

Please add documentation/features to allow for Dynamic entities to work for NON-MUSIC slots and thus catalogs.
It seems that Amazon has not provided the info and/or capabilities for this to work, after lots of investigation. 
the issue is that Dynamic entities requires you to first create a catalog for the target slot. Docs state:
"To use dynamic entities, ensure that your skill has a static catalog with defined slot types and slot names."
Then, when you actually try to create a catalog, you must choose a type from the following list: "AMAZON.MusicAlbum", "AMAZON.MusicGroup", "AMAZON.Genre", 
"AMAZON.MusicPlaylist", "AMAZON.MusicRecording", "AMAZON.BroadcastChannel". If your slot is not music related, youre out of luck.
So maybe, you think you can just pick an arbitrary type and go from there, but then you find that they have restrictions on what 
the catagory entities can look like which of course will all be music specific.
This "Dynamic entities" feature is such a common use case, that I cannot believe how poorly documented and difficult it is. 
My app contains a simple, dynamic list of items for each of my users. They can edit that list. Then, I want alexa to ask them to pick one of the items on their list. 
So of course, the slot value (list_item) expects them to say one of those items
and then match it to the correct/closest one. So, I should be able to respond with a dynamic entitly list of their current list.
Unfortuneatly this simple and common task has proven to be nearly impossible. Id appreciate any guidance
and I hope Amazon publishes MUCH clearer documentation for the steps of how to achieve this.

Could you please create an example Alexa skill that's built as an express app, which shows how to pass request / context to handlers and how to verify the signature, instead of a lambda-only example? I'm dependent upon using Express to power my Skill (handling incoming https requests). So, it'd be helpful to see a best practices for building a skill this way.

It would be useful to have a utility function for escaping rich text, for constructing strings to pass into `Alexa.RichTextContentHelper.withPrimaryText()`.

## Expected Behavior
Something like `escapeRichText("a & \\ b")`, which would return `"a &amp; \\\\ b"`. It would implement the rules [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/display-interface-reference.html#xml-special-characters).

## Current Behavior
We can't use `escapeXmlCharacters` from `SsmlUtils`. It tries to prevent characters from being encoded twice, which would mess with valid text, e.g. if you wanted to display a sample of HTML code to the user like `&amp;`.

In any case, this isn't a standard HTML-encode, because of the `\\` requirement.

## Possible Solution
See above.

## Context
Nice to have, but not essential.

## Your Environment

I want to update dynamic entities from a non-launch intent.

## Expected Behavior
<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->
<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->
What I really want is:
  1. (User) "Alexa, ask Board Game Bot to teach me Catan"
  2. (Alexa) "Catan is played by..."

Where the game type (e.g. Catan) can use entity resolution and be resolved against a list that is loaded at runtime (e.g. to resolve to Settles of Catan).

What I'd be happy enough with:
  1. (User) "Alexa, ask Board Game Bot to teach me game rules"
  2. (Alexa) "What game would you like me to teach?"
  3. (User) "Catan"
  4. (Alexa) "Catan is played by..."

## Current Behavior
<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->
<!--- Include full errors, uncaught exceptions, stack traces, and relevant logs -->
<!--- If service responses are relevant, please include any -->
<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->

The only way I have seen to get the dynamic entities loaded in is from the following interaction:
  1. (User) "Alexa, open Board Game Bot"
  2. (Alexa) "Welcome! To learn the rules of a game, say teach me the rules of any game."
  3. (User) "Teach me the rules of Chess"
  4. (Alexa) "Chess is played by..."

Where saying "open Board Game Bot" triggers the launch intent that updates the game type entities.

## Possible Solution
<!--- Not required, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug -->
<!--- or ideas how to implement the addition or change -->

For the ideal use case: I'd want an interaction similar to what IFTTT uses where I can provide an endpoint to return a list of options at runtime specific to a user.

For the good enough use case: Perhaps load in the entities when the dialogState === STARTED then use addDelegateDirective(currentIntent) to transition to the next dialog phase.

Hello 
The AWS CodeCommit Repositorys doesn't have an URL which ends with ".GIT"
e.g. 
`https://git-codecommit.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/XXXX-Alexa-Template`

Unfortunately in the ASK CLI is a Check that a Valid GIT URL must end with .GIT
Its in ask-cli\lib\utils\url-utils.js    Method: isUrlWithGitExtension 

If i modify this check, the ASK CLI works very fine with CodeCommit Repositorys.
e.g.
ask new --url https://git-codecommit.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/XXXX-Alexa-Template

Would be very fine if someone could fix this issue.

Kind Regards
Stefan
