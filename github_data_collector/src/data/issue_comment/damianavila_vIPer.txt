I don't now how easy you can hook with JS, hiding all the menu of a notebook and having native menubar/menu/icons... etc would be quite cool.

I don't find how to close split view. 

Also , a split view is not attached to a tab, so if you change tabs the split beneath  stay the same. Is it by design ? 

I would have put split inside tabs, and not tabs inside split. Does what I say make sens ?

In both horizontal and vertical view, slide mode and html, latex is not rendered.

Again on OS X. 

On os x, youtube video does not appear neither in tab, nor in html view.

On Mac OS most shortcut use `cmd-`  instead of `ctrl-` reloading is `cmd-r` and doing it show :

```
QAction::eventFilter: Ambiguous shortcut overload: ?R
```

In command line... and does not do anything.
Note that ctrl key does exist,
then this is a complicated Qt-issue as if I remember correctly qt use `Meta` for `cmd` key and something else for `alt`, I have to check.

`prev`, `next` and `reload` icons disappears when no tab is selected. Which change the toolbar height and is a little disturbing.

I would suggest preventing no-tabs and always fallback on at least one tab that is the dashboard, or the help.

This is more UI-related and a small detail.
Qt application ofter use the `unifiedTitleAndToolbar` to look more like native applications.

See [qt blog](http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2007/03/11/new-mac-os-x-stuff-for-43/) for screenshot.

Tabs should use [PySide.QtGui.QTabBar.documentMode()](http://www.pyside.org/docs/pyside/PySide/QtGui/QTabBar.html) 
when each tab is a separate document. 

Even if I am on a notebook, when clicking on any related action it says : 

This tab is not an IPython notebook. 
Both on master and rel-0.13 of ipython.
OS X - 10.7

BTW as a whishlist action should be disabled when not on notebook tab.

Again sorry for the spam, i'll open more issues to keep each separate.

Sorry i'll throw issues here as I am testing, otherwise i'll forgot to report it later. 
Sorry for the `__future__` spam...

Unable to get to dashboard when serving over https.
