复现步骤：克隆下来之后，直接运行，然后点击切换黑夜模式就会出现第一图的闪退，我修复了之后，在点击就出现第二个闪退。

It is hard, but necessary to announce, there is no more apk upgrade in the future, as the title says. 

I'm sorry for that.

Before the version v3.2.0 released, I've received an email from [Zhihu](https://zhihu.com), said that I have infringed upon their copyright and asked me to remove the content of Zhihu Daily in the Paper Plane app.  

So after the code refactoring, I decided to stop the maintaining. And here, I make an apologize to [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/),  [Guokr](http://www.guokr.com/) and [Douban](https://www.douban.com/).

If you just want to learn the code, you can fork it and develop by yourself. But, I suggest that it should be used only for study, no commercial activities. Code issues and PRs are welcomed, but you know, apk will not be upgraded and published anymore.

At the end, thanks to the contributors, the starers, the users and so on. Thanks!
