I've noticed that script updates app icon properly, but there is an issue on iOS >= 11.0.
Probably more recent versions stopped using app icon files scattered in the bundle
and started using those from .car file (which is not updated with overlays).

Also:
- show app version and build number in main scene
- add shared build scheme
- update project settings (suggested by Xcode)
- use Launch storyboard


The solution is not so pretty as before (sorry), but works.
I just downloaded this project, built it and then examined the app package.
See screenshot.

Trying to get this script to work with Xcode Bots. It works. Almost.

I see the generated icons in XcodeServer/Integrations/Caches/[number id]/DerivedData/Build/Products/[...]

But not in:
${BASE_PATH}${XCS_BOT_ID}-${XCS_BOT_NAME}/${XCS_INTEGRATION_NUMBER}/ 

So they doesn't show up with my IPA-file.

Hi, I see that in the script, as version is taken the build number, and as build number is taken the number of commits.  I changed the script with this code in order to retrieve the correct info:

```
version=`/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Print CFBundleShortVersionString" "${INFOPLIST_FILE}"`
build_num=`/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Print CFBundleVersion" "${INFOPLIST_FILE}"`
```
