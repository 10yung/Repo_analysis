Hello Everyone,

Since MySQL is removed from the opensource version in version 3.0, and all users are stored in MySQL as the default storage, I guess we will have to migrate that to SQLite that is the new default storage for config and DF users. But there are no documentation at all about upgrading from 2.x -> 3.x, nor any release notes in the Wiki for 3.x.

Are there more breaking changes or things to consider when upgrading? Is the upgrade process automatic? Database migrations moving from MySQL to SQLite and so on?

Documentation about this is really required.

Thanks!
I have several stored procedures in a firebird 3.0 database. Trying to access any of them does not succeed. 

Feedback from the system is always an empty resource, for both _func or _proc:

{
  "resource": []
}

If I try to access any of them with its name e.g.: https://my-server/api/v2/fbdb/_func/SP_DELETE_INVOICE
 
or https://my-server/api/v2/fbdb/_proc/SP_DELETE_INVOICE

I always receive: 
{
  "error": {
    "code": 404,
    "context": null,
    "message": "Function 'SP_DELETE_INVOICE' does not exist in the database.",
    "status_code": 404
  }
}

I tried flushing the cache via the admin console and also from the command line with: 
php artisan cache:clear

But I did not find any way to see or access my stored procedures.

Postgres 10, PHP 7.3, Ubuntu 18.04

"continue" targeting switch is equivalent to "break". Did you mean to use "continue 2"?
```

File: vendor/dreamfactory/df-core/src/Database/Schema/ColumnSchema.php:124

Fixed by commenting out `continue` temporarily.
Just tried deploying 3.0 beta using the deployment script on an Ubuntu 18.04.2 server (using commits merged to master branch on July 19).  Script works great, but getting a few warnings on screen right at the end, after entering credentials for the MSSQL database connection.

As a platform.sh user, all of our web application databases are restricted to local access. This means that in order to connect you must SSH into the machine or create an SSH tunnel.

This is a common feature built into reporting tools such as RJ Metrics which assume that database access will be restricted in such a way.
