You didn't support Debian Linux! So I made a Debian Variant for wifi-password here:
https://github.com/Sliicy/wifipassword
The code (if you can please add to this repo to make it more complete):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

WIFI="$(iwgetid -r)"
#Create a variable called "WIFI" equal to the name of the current Network.

echo ${WIFI}
#Print out the Wi-Fi Name.

awk '/psk=/{print $NF}' /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/${WIFI} | cut -c 5-
#Print out the saved password of this wifi and trim the results (so you don't see "psk=").
```
When running `Show-WiFiPassword` under either admin or normal user I get this:

```
On the computer can not find the configuration file "key = clear".
```

When running `Show-WiFiPassword` under either admin or normal user I get this:

PS C:\Windows\system32> Show-WiFiPassword
