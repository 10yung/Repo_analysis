I just set up AzureAD authentication via OIDC, with External Groups, and found the docs somewhat confusing/multiple places to look and pieces of information to pull together.

Would it be worth having a central place for that - maybe adding some additional details to the jwt_oidc_providers page?

I also got the AzureAD piece working with UPN, which is more "standard" for us anyway than email, and requires a few additional steps that I'm happy to document if people think it'd be helpful.

Instead of calling SetBarrierConfig in #8172 this updates the logic in `adjustCoreForSealMigration` to correctly set the barrier and recovery configs. I think this fixes the issue in #8172 and another issue where auto->auto migrations were not getting the correct config.
- move duplicated names to constants
- improve error handling for test
I was not able to get #8164 correctly merged after the new website update so opening a separate PR for this.

Closes #8164

Updated docs to show that the Oracle DB plugin now supports static roles. Note that this should not be released until the Oracle DB plugin is released.

We have a requirement where we need to know the OIDC JWT client_id before we provision `identity/oidc/role/:name` in Vault. Currently the `client_id` (JWT `aud` field) is set to a unique/random value.     

This PR is to allow admins to specify/override the client_id when they create a role. For example:

`vault write identity/oidc/role/test key="test" template=@/test.tmpl client_id="LGRQlm0PNl9EmETRuMIiXGw8Gi"`

Also tried with overriding the `aud` field in template file, but that field is not allowed to be overridden.
