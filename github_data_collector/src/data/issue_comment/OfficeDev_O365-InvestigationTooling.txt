I made the following changes:
- Removed YAML metadata from readme
- Added a YAML file with the metadata info

These changes allow us to automatically update the Office gallery (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/gallery) with information for this tool. This means whenever this tool is referenced in the Office Developer Portals, the user will be seeing the most up-to-date information.


It looks like the link (https://github.com/OfficeDev/O365-InvestigationTooling/blob/master/gettingstarted) is broken.  The link is found in the README.md file under "Prerequisites for the Activity API".
Could you be so kind and let me know how could I decrypt/decompress the data in the "action" and "condition" fields. I am getting results, but I can't tell what's what. Much appreciated. 
"no" changed to "not" - Line 27
Microsoft Secure Score Improvement Actions points to this repository to download EnableMailboxAuditing.ps1, but the file appears to be missing?

suggest to include RecipientTypeDetails  in check
```powershell
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize Unlimited `
| Select Name, AuditEnabled, AuditLogAgeLimit,RecipientTypeDetails  `
| Ft -a
```
Getting all mailboxes instead of only 1000 does not appear to cause any issues. Tested on a tenant with over 50,000 users.
2-4 years average age, no new commits. Many problems with these scripts and MFA. Typical MS.
Updated the code to mirror the new default auditing set of Microsoft as described in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/enable-mailbox-auditing
Exported the check to a CSV file for large environments.
Set-Mailbox on ExternalDirectoryObjectId because this is the Azure AD object and is always unique in the environment
Was having issues running into Get-MsolUser error, and unknown parameter errors using the original script so I made some adjustments for anyone who needs a version to use with the Exchange Online Powershell Module:
