For lossy encoders theres usually some parameter controlling compression. Instead of using hardcoded settings, or manually tuning such, I’ve been working on a [tool that I call Imager](https://github.com/imager-io/imager) that tries to find the *best* compression/file-size tradeoff automatically.

Just curious to get some usage feedback and all. :)

Bumps [chrono](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono) from 0.4.9 to 0.4.10.
<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>

*Sourced from [chrono's changelog](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).*

> ## 0.4.10
> 
> ### Improvements
> 
> * `DateTime::parse_from_str` is more than 2x faster in some cases. ([@&#8203;michalsrb](https://github.com/michalsrb)
>   [#358](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/358))
> * Significant improvements to no-std and alloc support (This should also make
>   many format/serialization operations induce zero unnecessary allocations)
>   ([@&#8203;CryZe](https://github.com/CryZe) [#341](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/341))
> 
> ### Features
> 
> * Functions that were accepting `Iterator` of `Item`s (for example
>   `format_with_items`) now accept `Iterator` of `Borrow<Item>`, so one can
>   use values or references. ([@&#8203;michalsrb](https://github.com/michalsrb) [#358](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/358))
> * Add built-in support for structs with nested `Option<Datetime>` etc fields
>   ([@&#8203;manifest](https://github.com/manifest) [#302](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/302))
> 
> ### Internal/doc improvements
> 
> * Use markdown footnotes on the `strftime` docs page ([@&#8203;qudlibetor](https://github.com/qudlibetor) [#359](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/359))
> * Migrate from `try!` -> `?` (question mark) because it is now emitting
>   deprecation warnings and has been stable since rustc 1.13.0
> * Deny dead code
