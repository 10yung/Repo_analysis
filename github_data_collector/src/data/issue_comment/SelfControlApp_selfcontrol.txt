I ran into the same issue as #358, after happily using Self Control on several different devices. The only things that were different than usual were 1) that I set the time to 1 Day, and 2) the lid was down when the time passed. After the day had more than fully elapsed, Self Control was Off and had no window visible, but the websites were still inaccessible.

I tried all the steps listed, fully uninstalled Self Control, killed the Self Control process that was running, *and* double checked the /etc/hosts file to make sure that the addresses had been removed. Still couldn't access those sites.

**Rebooting solved the issue**, so the blocks must have been stored in a temporary file somewhere (as the #358 poster indicated) or in memory. I don't feel like pulling apart the Self Control app to figure out why this happened, but it might be worth investigating, as a few of my friends have run into the same issue and been mystified as to why. 
This will allow us to test our new blacklist without having to wait 15 minutes.
Could this be fixed theoretically by using a timer that is not local, maybe an internet based time? Or having an internal timer that isnt based on the computers time settings?

Culprit: unsatisfiable constraints causing non-deterministic behaviour as AppKit attempts to resolve conflicting restraints. 

Fix: set constraints on bordered scroll view rather than table view

I've noticed this primarily with sites that are run from the same company/network.

For example, if I block Facebook.com, WhatsApp doesn't work.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is this anyway around this?
Right now I have no idea how to use the whitelist function and still keep the Spotify and Dropbox apps running.

Would be nice If you could select apps to block not to block.
Some of my blocks are circumvented in Firefox with DNS over HTTPS turned on.
Strangely enough, one of these blocks (theguardian.com) which was previously circumvented now isn't after putting the full url (https://www.theguardian.com/uk) into the blacklist.

What's going on here? Is this something that's fixable?
When a block is running and trying to add a new site the message "Error -103  Attempting to add host to block, but no block appears to be in progress" is displayed. Occurred when running a long block, attempting to uninstall and reinstalling. 
Fixed bug where a user could easily use this control path to cause
SelfControl to remove existing block session, giving easy backdoor.
So I wanted to start writing a script to start a block according to my schedule. So I looked up how to start a block in the terminal and I found that if you run this command in the terminal

`$ sudo /Applications/SelfControl.app/Contents/MacOS/org.eyebeam.SelfControl $(id -u $(whoami)) --install`

it will start a block. But my problem is I mistakenly ran this command twice while the block was active, then suddenly it cleared my current block. You can see this [here](https://imgur.com/a/g8yYBV2)

This is a major problem for me because now my brain knows a way to get out of the block. If I ever "need" to go onto YouTube or something, I find myself just clearing the block. Can this be fixed?
