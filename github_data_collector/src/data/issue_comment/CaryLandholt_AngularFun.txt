Let‚Äôs get started with automated dependency management for AngularFun :muscle:



This pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point. I will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, **as soon as you merge this pull request**.

**I won‚Äôt start sending you further updates, unless you have merged this very pull request**.

<summary>üôà How to ignore certain dependencies</summary>

In case you can not, or do not want to update a certain dependency right now, you can of course just [change the `package.json` file back to your liking](https://github.com/CaryLandholt/AngularFun/edit/greenkeeper/initial/package.json).

Add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don‚Äôt want to update right now.

```js
// package.json
{
  ‚Ä¶
  "greenkeeper": {
    "ignore": [
      "package-names",
      "you-want-me-to-ignore"
    ]
  }
}
```

<summary>üë©‚Äçüíª How to update this pull request</summary>

```bash
  # change into your repository‚Äôs directory
  git fetch
  git checkout greenkeeper/initial
  npm install-test
  # adapt your code, so it‚Äôs working again
  git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'
  git push origin greenkeeper/initial
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>‚ú® How the updates will look like</summary>

As soon as you merge this pull request **I‚Äôll create a branch for every dependency update**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services to check the new version. Using the results of these tests I‚Äôll try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.

```diff
-  "underscore": "^1.6.0"
+  "underscore": "^1.7.0"
```

In the above example you can see an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).
When the test services report success I‚Äôll delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken ‚Äì everything is fine.
When there is a failure however, I‚Äôll create an issue so you know about the problem immediately.

This way every single version update of your dependencies will either continue to work with your project, or you‚Äôll get to know of potential problems immediately.

```diff
-  "lodash": "^3.0.0"
+  "lodash": "^4.0.0"
```

In this example the new version `4.0.0` is not included in the old `^3.0.0` range.
For version updates like these ‚Äì let‚Äôs call them ‚Äúout of range‚Äù updates ‚Äì you‚Äôll receive a pull request.

Now **you no longer need to check for exciting new versions by hand** ‚Äì I‚Äôll just let you know automatically.
And the pull request will not only serve as a reminder to update. In case it passes your decent test suite that‚Äôs a strong reason to merge right away :shipit:

Good luck with your project and see you soon :sparkles:

Your [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io) Bot :palm_tree:

Hi, these changes need to work together with https://github.com/CaryLandholt/grunt-hustler/issues/20 to work properly.

For example, if we place a image file to src/images/foo.png or src/styles/images/bar.png, and then we want to reference it in src/index.html or src/styles/styles.less, then bug will appears if we run 'grunt prod'.

Obviously, the foo.png and bar.png was renamed as foo.xxxxxxx.png and bar.xxxxxxx.png, but <img src="images/foo.png" /> in src/index.html and background-image:url(styles/images/bar.png) in src/styles/styles.less  not updated.

However, the 'bust' task in grunt-hustler need to be upgraded for this purpose

Hi,

src/index.html need to be excluded for watch:basic task, because it should be processed by watch:spaHtml task, in which the template:indexDev will handle the <% %> content

```
        # Run tasks when monitored files change
        watch:
            basic:
                files: [
                    'src/fonts/**'
                    'src/images/**'
                    'src/scripts/**/*.js'
                    'src/styles/**/*.css'
                    'src/**/*.html'
                    '!src/index.html' ## in order for watch:spaHtml
                ]
                tasks: [
                    'copy:app'
                    'copy:dev'
                    'karma'
                ]
                options:
                    livereload: true
                    nospawn: true
            ...
            spaHtml:
                files: 'src/index.html'
                tasks: [
                    'copy:app'
                    'template:indexDev'
                    'copy:dev'
                    'karma'
                ]
                options:
                    livereload: true
                    nospawn: true
```
