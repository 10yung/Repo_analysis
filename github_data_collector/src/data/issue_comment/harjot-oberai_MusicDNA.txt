When I change the language of the phone to arabic, the seekBars does not appear
can you fix in your library the orientation by adding this attribut
```
<com.h6ah4i.android.widget.verticalseekbar.VerticalSeekBar
 android:layoutDirection="ltr"
 ...
>
```

Hello:) while we use this application, we find some errors.

1. When we press the button to save DNA, the save pop-up appears, but it does not  save at SavedDNA. Does this version not work because it's a beta version?
2. I- phone is IOS. Is this compatible with IOS?
3. To turn off the MusicDNA app while we are using other app, we should enter the MusicDNA app to stop singing. For better use, please create an x-mark on the top bar.
4. We've written a Korean-language version of 'how to use tutuorials', where can I add this?
5. We have translated the four files within the project: app/proguard-rules.pro_Korean.md., Gradle.properties_Korean.md., LICENSE_Korean.md., README_Korean.md, so where can we add these files?
6. We want to add Korean-language to this app, but we don't know the code well, so if our translations are helpful for people, can we took a picture of the screen which are translated into Korean? Also, If it helpful, we'll send you a translation document or upload it.
.

^_____^ Thanks for your contribution to make this app better. Thank you and we are expect you to modified these errors. Have a good day!

[Question] Maybe a dumb question but does this player can really play soundcloud streams? I can't see any soundcloud integration in the app.
With the last release (and code commit) dating back to 5/2017, I wonder if you still maintain this app, @harjot-oberai? Will there be future development?
Nothing was found from soundcloud 
I think this app should add other language.
play any song, and browse through other apps.. and after few minutes music stops and default player page open with buffering icon and default titles..
