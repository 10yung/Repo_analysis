Since im new to this field, im struggling to test my own labeled data with your tool. I was wondering if you could provide a workflow, on how to use your tool or better, on how to integrate own labeled images, if this is even possible? I understand, that the examples have stored the x/y coordinates of the anatomical landmarks, but i dont know, in which order shall these landmarks be stored in the mat. double, also i dont understand, what the im file stands for, which is also provided in the example file.
In any case, i dont want to steal your time, but would be glad for an answer.
