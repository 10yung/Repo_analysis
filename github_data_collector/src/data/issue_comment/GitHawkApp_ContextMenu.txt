Hi @rnystrom, this PR implement the #44.

* Add a delegate method to check allow tap to dismiss. (If no delegate, default can be tap dismiss)
* Add a `delegate` property for some use case, for example, when wrapped the delegate pattern to `Delegate Proxy` with RxSwift.

If there have any suggestions or concerns, please let me know. ðŸ˜ƒ Thanks.

This needs testing on a real device, as the simulator/accessibility inspector do not support testing this, so let's hold off on merging before testing this.

Hey, @rnystrom 

I think it would be nice to update `tintAdjustmentMode` like Apple UI controls do.
If you wish I can create a **PR**, just two lines of code:

- on appear
```swift
UIApplication.shared.keyWindow?.tintAdjustmentMode = .dimmed
```
- on disappear
```swift
UIApplication.shared.keyWindow?.tintAdjustmentMode = .normal
```
