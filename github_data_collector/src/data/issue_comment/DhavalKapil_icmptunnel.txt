It runs correctly on both ends, but when I try to `ssh -D 4444 root@10.0.1.1` nothing happens:

on server I run `sudo ./icmptunnel -s 10.0.1.1`, on client `sudo ./icmptunnel -c serverip` and I have:

```
$ route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
10.0.0.0        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     600    0        0 wlp2s0
serverip    10.0.0.1        255.255.255.255 UGH   0      0        0 wlp2s0

```
and
```
$ ip a show tun0
13: tun0: <POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1472 qdisc fq_codel state UNKNOWN group default qlen 500
    link/none

       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::9971:42bb:d660:fd84/64 scope link flags 800 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

what am I doing wrong here?

note: strangely enought if I try: `sudo ssh -D 4444 root@serverip` I get prompted for password when I set on server to never ask for that...
```
# cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config|grep Password
PermitEmptyPasswords no
PasswordAuthentication no
```







This is another issue but can also be related, sometimes when I press ctrl+c I get this on server side
`[DEBUG] Read ICMP packet with src: 10.0.0.29, dest: 10.0.0.12, payload_size: 24, payload: x�` or `[DEBUG] Read ICMP packet with src: 10.0.0.29, dest: 10.0.0.12, payload_size: 24, payload: '�D�#�@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx�` pls give me some hint, thanks!
add some ways to get back to normal Routing table.
on Client i dont have internet , also i `ping 4.2.2.4` or `8.8.8.8` but failed .

As you can see `payload_size` is very small and hence viewing any page is almost impossible , any workaround this problem?

there should be some means of encrypted (one-time) authentication (per ip) so not everyone can use the icmp proxy server.


If a machine ping me during the program is launched, icmptunnel crashed with this error:
