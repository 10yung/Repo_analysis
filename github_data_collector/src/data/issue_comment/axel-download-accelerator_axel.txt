while running './configure' in git bash, an error appeared like this:
configure: error:  is required.

[config.log](https://github.com/axel-download-accelerator/axel/files/4038999/config.log)

When at the end of each download session, `axel` frequently connects to and disconnects from the server.
This has 2 problems:
1. It actually make the speed lower due to the time used connecting;
2. Some servers will ban you if you frequently connects and disconnects to them.

So if a connection is finished, you should not make any new connections.
This implementation parses the $HOME/.netrc (or a file specified by the
user) through the `--netrc[=file]` or `-R[file]` options.

It uses a simple FSM in order to parse the file and find the credentials
corresponding to the FTP host, or uses the "default" entry otherwise,
if any, according to the specification found on [1]. Tokens not
applicable to axel usage were not considered.

Initially this was going to be a typo fix, but as I read more I noticed several miswordings which may be confusing to non-native English speakers, so I have changed them.
I'm using Axel on OSX 10.14.6 and having trouble resuming an incomplete download. Resuming an interrupted download appears to work until the progress reaches 100% and at that point things seem to just hang – for some unknown reason Axel isn't able to finalise things. 

The way I have been experiencing this is when the cable to the external HDD (where I have been downloading to) is accidentally knocked off. Axel appears to be able to pick up from where the download got interrupted but for whatever reason it can't finish the task in the end at which point I have to manually kill Axel.

Here is an example output:

```

The code should try to read as much as possible, so an abstraction is required to use the already read part that is not headers, before continuing reading from the socket.
Basic Metalink support should not be difficult.

If possible, avoid XML parsing.
