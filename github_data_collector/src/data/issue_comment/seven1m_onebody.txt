The project has a very cushy rating, but it doesn't seem like there's anywhere I can go to see the list of features. There's a wiki and FAQ, but there's really nothing there other than a cautionary warning about the check-in feature being very broken.

Could use some help.

I tried to install using Vagrant, but I am getting errors. 
---------------------------------------------------------  
  default: Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.27-3ubuntu1) ...
    default: ++ npm install -g yarn
    default: /tmp/vagrant-shell: line 13: npm: command not found
The SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status. Vagrant
assumes that this means the command failed. The output for this command
should be in the log above. Please read the output to determine what
went wrong.

I fixed the problem by modify vagrantfile and make install suecessed.
but I still get error that bixed in in 810e96b

Webpacker can't find application.js in /vagrant/public/packs/manifest.json. Possible causes:
1. You want to set webpacker.yml value of compile to true for your environment
   unless you are using the `webpack -w` or the webpack-dev-server.
2. webpack has not yet re-run to reflect updates.
3. You have misconfigured Webpacker's config/webpacker.yml file.
4. Your webpack configuration is not creating a manifest.
Your manifest contains:
{
}

We have a family with an apostrophe in their name, they show up correctly on the site but in the printed directory they appear with the HTML entity inside their last name (like "O&#39;Neal").  Image attached showing what it looks like.

It is possible to specify one or more "roles" for a group membership, e.g. "leader", "student", etc.

These are just simple strings. Currently the only way to set these strings is via import/sync, and there is no way to view them in the UI yet.

(Roles were added to meet a need of our pilot church's check-in software and never fully exposed.)

Would like to have email message send html+text.

When using checkin feature with no label set it displays a Print Tags button and errors saying LabelWriter can not be found. It would be great if no label was set if this button could read just "Checkin" and not check for connected printer :smile:
