What is the use case for multiple hosts?

I cannot seem to find any information on when you should use multiple hosts. Is it for an Enterprise Cluster or a HA deployment?

If it is for a HA, then how do you specify the relay server for writes?
The commit https://github.com/node-influx/node-influx/commit/6a47c91dea2d1e5f4fcefbeff199d461c5463a64 breaks the clients that passed the port inside "host". An example:

```js
{
  host: 'somehost:8086',
}
```

This ends up being `http://somehost:8086/:8086` because "host" is actually treated as "hostname" (without port) under the hood. Naming issue. In fact, the `host` object from `this._getHost()` was always broken even prior to that commit:

```
Host {
  backoff:
   ExponentialBackoff {
     options: { initial: 300, max: 10000, random: 1 },
     _counter: 0 },
  options: {},
  url:
   Url {
     protocol: 'http:',
     slashes: true,
     auth: null,
     host: 'somehost:8086',
     port: '8086',
     hostname: 'somehost',
     hash: null,
     search: null,
     query: null,
     pathname: '/:8086',
     path: '/:8086',
     href: 'http://somehost:8086/:8086' } }
```

Now that it is relying on `host.url.pathname`, boom.

My suggestion: rename "host" to "hostname", or remove the "port" option and let users concatenate both together into "host". [Deprecate 5.x](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/deprecate) and release 6.x.
