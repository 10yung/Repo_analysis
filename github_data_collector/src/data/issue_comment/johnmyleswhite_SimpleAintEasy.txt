- OLS vs LAD regression with single extreme outlier
- Sparsity example for Lasso
- PCA of data without the column means removed produces a PC that is basically the aggregate mean
- Conditionals are Gaussians does not imply the join is MV Gaussian

How do you want to handle citations?

In the README, only basic summary statistics are mentioned: mean, median, mode and I'm guessing std. dev, variance, correlations, etc are also to be included. I'm curious about how far out you are interested in extending material. What about 
- [histograms](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/51718/assessing-approximate-distribution-of-data-based-on-a-histogram/51753#51753), 
- [linear regression](http://camdp.com/blogs/machine-learning-counter-examples-pt1), 
- common estimators of stat models (I'm thinking $\hat{p}$ in a binomial model),  
- problems with PCA,
- using KNN in high-dimensional sparse spaces, etc. 

I'm guessing I'm asking: who is the audience of the text? Are we interested in an intro text, or advanced text?
