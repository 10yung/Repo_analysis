I'm not fluent in gradle as well I'm not fluent with conversion groovy to kotlin gradle.

It took me some time to find corresponded groovy code for the configurations.
when you add     
   ` metrics {
        git() 
}`
It should populate git branch and username into metrics.
But they are not being populated.

implementing #93 
Abstract the creation of `CustomPublishers` with a configuration like:

```
class CustomPublisherConfiguration : PublisherConfiguration {
    override var name = "CustomPublisherConfiguration"
    override var publishBuildMetrics = true
    override var publishTaskMetrics = true
    val publisher: Publisher? = null
} 
```
This will help us to include custom publishers in the HybridPublisher and have a better syntax in the main publisher configuration
I can not exec gradle clean. Folder "build\reports\talaiot\timeline" is lock

When you run Gradle sync in AndroidStudio you will see a very long line of requested tasks(in our case it is 10k characters). It contains a lot of generateDebugSources tasks for each module in the project. As a workaround, we can check tasks names

Reproduce:
1) Open Android Studio
2) Click sync now

Add new Dashboard for Prometheus and update the publisher to fit requirements of release 1.0.0
