If I'm not wrong, this tool is for when you have a container that crashed, but it doesn't have the necessary debugging tools when you want to ssh into it.

I think it would help to have a "Why?" section in the README
Hello,

I successfully built `crashcart`  from sources, but I am now struggling getting through the next step (Building `crashcart.img`). Running `build_image.sh` produces those errors:

```

```

Nevertheless, a Docker image is built:

``` 
# docker images
REPOSITORY                             TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
crashcart-builder                      latest              2d7bcd31ce5d        About a minute ago   493MB
```

Trying to run this image manually (by copy-pasting the command from `build_image.sh`) produces the following errors:

```
# docker run --privileged --rm -i \
    -e "PACKAGES=${PACKAGES}" \
    -e http_proxy="${http_proxy}" \
    -e https_proxy="${https_proxy}" \
    -e ftp_proxy="${ftp_proxy}" \
    -v "${PWD}"/vol:/dev/crashcart crashcart-builder /dev/crashcart/build_crashcart.sh
...
error: Package ‘Agda-2.5.2’ in /dev/crashcart/store/c9bqkl3z13zwsrganhkmrf1d195d57by-nixos-17.09-17.09.2754.66b4de79e38/nixos-17.09/pkgs/development/haskell-modules/hackage-packages.nix:726 is marked as broken, refusing to evaluate.

a) For `nixos-rebuild` you can set
  { nixpkgs.config.allowBroken = true; }
in configuration.nix to override this.

b) For `nix-env`, `nix-build`, `nix-shell` or any other Nix command you can add
  { allowBroken = true; }
to ~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix.

(use ‘--show-trace’ to show detailed location information)
```

Any idea what is going wrong/what am I doing wrong?

Note: I am using Linux Mint (Ubuntu-based) in a Virtual Box. I have successfully used this setup before together with Docker.

Thank you,

Brice.
As far as I understand the instructions, there is no way to run this software as side container in Kubernetes (I think that it is truth for other orchestrations, but I am less sure).
