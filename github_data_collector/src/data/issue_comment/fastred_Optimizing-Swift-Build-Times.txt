From WWDC 2019 seems that having third-party dependencies incorporate distribution through SPM will help "a lot??" for build time. I'll keep developing my issue and contribute on my findings. Thank you for this repo!
The use case provided for why one would have dSYM generation on is rare and should be opt-in. A lot of people leave dSYM generation on and don't realize it's adding 5+ seconds to every incremental build.
I think Chinese developer is more.So, if you want have a Chinese README.I have a little help to you.I will write it. @fastred

Would be worth checking if moving code into extensions causes longer compile times.
