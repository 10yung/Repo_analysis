Limitations to what resources API Gateway can reach within a VPC.

For instance, you are unable to do basic proxying from a regional, edge-optimized or private API Gateway endpoint to a web service hosted within a VPC without an NLB deployed and placed upstream of that service. There are several problems with this, namely, you are forced to use an NLB, instead of an ELB or an ALB which are L7 load-balancers.

You also cannot proxy to a web service hosted on an EC2 instance that is in a private subnet. The EC2 instance has to be publicly accessible.

here is the offical document from "https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/":

""Data transferred "in" to and "out" from Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift , Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX), and Amazon ElastiCache instances or Elastic Network Interfaces across Availability Zones or VPC Peering connections in the same AWS Region is charged at $0.01/GB in each direction."

the data transfer cost should be single direction, so in the picture No.5, should be 0+0.01 instead of 0.01+0.01 in each direction.
