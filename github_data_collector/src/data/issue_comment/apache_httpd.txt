Sorry for the spam :)

The original pattern for creating the pid file was:
open_create(pid_file)
write(pid_file, pid)
close(pid_file)

But if a power outage occurs between open_create and write, the file will
be empty and httpd will refuse to start afterwards unless the corrupt pid
file is removed.

This patch uses the pattern:
open_create(temp_pid_file)
write(temp_pid_file)
close(temp_pid_file)
rename(temp_pid_file, pid_file)
which is guaranteed to be atomic, provided that temp_pid_file and pid_file
are located in the same file system, which this patch does by creating
a temporary file name with the pattern:
    pid_file_name + random_suffix

While 'protocol' (HTTPS) part of it looks a bit hacky, I think this deserves to be included one way or other, it's pretty much helpful when running behind (popular nowadays) reverse proxies. Basically, this one extends mod_remoteip to support RemoteHost, RemotePort and RemoteProto, allowing for mangling Host header, using different ports and transitioning HTTPS to HTTP.

More details (and configuration details) here: https://alex-at.ru/blog/apache-mod_remoteip-mod_rpaf

I'm ready to work on that to bring it to the applicable state if something is wrong with it. HTTPS part surely looks hacky, so I'm eager to get expert opinions on how to make this proper.
This completes the option of setting the remote user by the authentication
mechanism which actually verified the user.

One possible usecase is that a proxied (upstream) server performs the
authentication, but the access log of HTTPd does not contain this information.
The upstream server can pass this kind of information back to HTTPd and both
servers will have consistent access logs.
The Apache's index page has been ugly for ten years. It's time to make it more HTML5

I use responsive layout in this index file which makes it look more beautiful on phones.
