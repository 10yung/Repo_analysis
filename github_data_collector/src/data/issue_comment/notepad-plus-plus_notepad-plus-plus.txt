### Description of the Issue
The string 'User defined' is sometimes used in the UI, while 'User-defined' is used in other places.  'User-defined' is the typical preference.  I was going to submit a quick PR to fix this, but I see from CONTRIBUTING.md, it is preferred to submit an issue report first.  So here it is. :)

Also, in 'Open User Defined Language folder' the singular for 'Language' is used in the UI, instead of 'Languages'.  I can fix that in the same PR, or submit a separate issue if you prefer.

Finally, there are numerous inconsistencies between using initial-caps and not using them within the menuitems.  I can fix those inconsistencies in this issue as well, or file a separate issue report if you prefer.

The last tab in the Preferences dialog box is 'MISC.' (all caps).  I recommend we simply change it to 'Miscellaneous'.

I'm willing to do all the work if you like as a small 'thank you' for creating and always improving Notepad++.   :)

Just let me know if you're interested in me doing this for you, and how many issues/PR's you want.

Version Tested: 7.8.3
**Steps to reproduce:**

Check `View -> Word Wrap`.
Search for a word in the current document (file A).
Switch to another tab.
Double-click a line in the Find Results window.

**Result:**
File A is activated, the search-term is selected *but the relevant line may not be visible.*
IOW, the visible lines do not change.

Probably related to https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/9387dcdaef19289af87f24639bf7336526d027f5 (which is a major improvement in general).

Thank you.

Can delete these icons and create these two entries in the context menu?
It will be much more convenient than these terrible buttons, which only take up space in the "Folder as Workspace" window

### Description of the Issue
Npp is a good editor. Integrate vim-style editing is good for programmers.

I'm new to vim as well and found Vim is very interesting, however, I've used Npp since its released for a long time. Is there anyway to integrate these functionalities.

I found there was a plugin for Npp to behave like Vim but it is no longer in development.

Thanks

### Description of the Issue
When documents opened during startup of Notepad++ either via command line or because they are restored from a previous session, syntax highlighting is inactive for some documents. This happens at least for .nsi and .nsh files (NSIS) and in versions 7.8.2 and 7.8.3.

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue
1. open some .nsi file
2. close Notepad++
3. open Notepad++ (.nsi file reopens automatically)

### Expected Behavior
syntax highlighting is active, text is colored

### Actual Behavior
syntax highlighting is inactive, text is gray

### Description of the Issue
I noticed that making a small change via the Style Configurator makes many large unrelated changes to stylers.xml

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue
<!--- Set of steps to reproduce this issue -->
1.  Start with a fresh N++
2.  Open Style Configurator
3.  Launch N++ -> Go to Settings -> Style Configurator -> select Default theme (Global Styles, Global override) -> change Font name from 'Courier New' to a different font (I prefer 'DejaVu Sans Mono' when using Windows) ->check 'Enable global font' if unchecked -> check OK
4. Exit N++
6. Compare stylers.xml to stylers.model.xml
6. Notice all the unexpected differences between those 2 files

### Expected Behavior
Expected just a small change from the default font.  I think this was the effect until recently.

### Actual Behavior
Significant unexpected changes.

### Description of the Feature Request

### Description of the Issue
When I'm shutting down windows and some file open in Notepad++ needs to be saved (in my particular instance it was a file no longer on the file system) all tabs were closed except for that file and I was presented with an option to save.  Once I saved and allowed the shutdown to continue, upon restart and reopening ++, all my previously opened tabs were still closed.   

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue
1. Open some on-disk text file
2. Delete the text file.
3. Shut down/Reboot Windows.
4. Windows indicates that Notepad++ is preventing the shutdown
5. Cancel the shutdown and switch to Notepad++.
6. Note that all tabs have already been closed despite the "Remember current session for next launch" option having been toggled on.

### Expected Behavior
Save all my session's open tabs INCLUDING the tab that I was forced to save during shutdown.

### Actual Behavior
All tabs were closed.  Notepad++ stared up as a blank slate with only a "New" tab.

### Debug Information
don't have any
