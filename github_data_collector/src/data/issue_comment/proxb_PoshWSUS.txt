I'm trying to implement the following as a scheduled task:
1.) Approve all updates with status "Needed" for a given `ComputerTargetGroup` _test_group_ (this is the group with the test systems that shall get all needed updates immediately)
2.) Approve all updates that have been approved for the _test_group_ and are older than N days for a given _prod_group_ (this is the group with the productive systems that shall get all updates after they have been approved for the test systems for N days)

I'm done with part 2 but am struggeling with part 1, because I can't get the list of updates with status "Needed" for a given computer group. It seems like `Get-PSWSUSUpdate` is missing a parameter or I am looking at the wrong commandlet?

Can you give me a pointer how to achieve this? If the feature is not yet implemented I could look into it.
Correct built in help error in port listing. Changed 8350/8351 to 8530/8531.
Many of the cmdlets do not include a `$wsus` check, so that there occurs some ambiguous errors caused by loss of connection. Therefore a check is added for all cmdlets although they do not interact with `$wsus` variable directly.
Is it possible to add a -credential option for connecting to a WSUS server with an alternate username?
This is more of a feature request, not sure how to mark it as such.
Who is it possible to set "Same as Parent"? like here:
https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windowsserverdocs/blob/master/WindowsServerDocs/administration/windows-server-update-services/manage/updates-operations.md#to-approve-multiple-updates

An alternative would be set "NotApproved" to "All Computers":
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ms752788%28v%3dvs.85%29
> PS: InvalidOperationException


I would like to Get and Approve updates which are already approved on some groups but not on the TargetGroup.

First Idea:
Get-PSWSUSUpdate  -ApprovedState NotApproved -ComputerTargetGroups [TargetGroup]
> I get zero updates out of this Request

Second Idea:
Get-PSWSUSUpdate -UpdateApprovalAction NotApproved  -ComputerTargetGroups [TargetGroup]
> The NotApproved is not supported by UpdateApprovalAction

Is this a missing feature or i am requesting this the false way?

Set-PSWSUSConfigSyncSchedule -SynchronizeAutomatically $true
is wrong in the EXAMPLE 3. Correct version is 
set-PSWSUSConfigSyncSchedule -SynchronizeAutomatically:$true

Example reproduction:

1. Run 'Get-PSWSUSUpdateFiles' without having previously connected with Connect-PSWSUSServer

2. Warning in response = 

> "WARNING: Use Connect-**Posh**WSUSServer for establish connection with your Windows Update Server"

I'm new to GitHub.  Is it the "done thing" for something like this to write a pull request with the necessary adjustments made? 
Hi, 

how can I show Number of updates per WSUS group? If I use:

$Computerscope = Get-PSWSUSClientsInGroup -name "XXX"
Get-PSWSUSUpdateSummaryPerClient -ComputerScope $Compuperscope

Thats show all clients computers in WSUS

Thanks

When applying update to a group, is there a way to apply to sub groups "Apply to children"? I am using the following command:
`
Get-PSWSUSUpdate -ComputerTargetGroups 'Test' -FromArrivalDate "$($Date.Month)/1/$($Date.Year)"| Approve-PSWSUSUpdate -Action Install -Group $AllComputers -PassThru
`
