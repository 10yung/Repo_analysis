with regards 
ioannis 
hi tomlooman,

I tried to compile this for the first time, and the code from this commit gave me some trouble:

I "fixed" it by adding extra parenthesis on the first set of AND conditions, like this

```
if ((!Actor->IsA(ALevelScriptActor::StaticClass()) && !Actor->IsA(ASMutator::StaticClass()) && Actor->GetRootComponent() != nullptr &&
				Actor->GetRootComponent()->Mobility != EComponentMobility::Static) || (!Actor->IsA(AStaticMeshActor::StaticClass()) && !Actor->IsA(ALight::StaticClass())))
```  

Now it compiles just fine.

Thank you
How do i setup the Zombie patrolling ? For some reason patrolling doesnt work..the only thing that works is when the zombie follows a player..
I've been working my way through your excellent `Unreal Engine 4 Mastery: Create Multiplayer Games with C++` course recently and figured I'd try swapping out the Pawn Sensing implementation for an AI Perception one.

It works quite well. However, it's not without issues:

- The stimulus max age functionality doesn't really work. I don't think this impacts this game too much, because you get a similar game play experience with `LoseSightRadius`, allowing you to shake off a zombie by running further away. You cannot check to see whether a stimulus has expired in `OnTargetPerceptionUpdated` unfortunately. It could be made to work by getting additional actor info on every tick. But... not ideal.
- The hearing config uses `bDetectFriendlies = true` as a bit of a hack. Not using this doesn't detect you as an enemy, because for some reason the hearing sense differs from the sight sense in that it doesn't use the AI Controller's `GetTeamAttitudeTowards`. I think this is a bug in the engine.

I don't mind if this doesn't get merged, however, it'd be great if you could let me know if this implementation is correct. If it is, at the very least hopefully it'll save somebody else some time figuring out how to swap out Pawn Sensing :).
I am able to compile the code with no problem, but when i try to edit the game mode...

Lets say all i did was added one line with 0 code and i get errors... please review images... image one is normal code from github complie works fine.. image two is one line added with tons of errors..how does this happen? I tried reinstalling VS,,, generating project files again...

Hi, Tom!
Why does it happen? I use Win7 x64. To be able to choose one of the in-game menu (after Esc pushed down) I need to use "Windows" button first - then the menu becomes clickable and sees my mouse aiming. Hope you can explain it :)
Unfortunately in 4.19 Native was removed and FNativeFuncPtr was introduced. This requires some minor changes in SGameMode.cpp and SGameMode.h

408: Func->SetNativeFunc((**Native**)&ASGameMode::BeginPlayMutatorHack);

Also UObject* Context was added as first parameter, this needs to be adapted in definition and declaration.

BR
Can any one show me how to rebuild the source or fix the problem that it keep saing that cant rebuild Thank
It keep say that it not the right version
