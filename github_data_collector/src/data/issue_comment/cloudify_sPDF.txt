Almost a duplicate of #46 but I hope this should compile, have updated travis descriptor.

Basically the title. Just updated everything to run with 2.13, fixed a few errors that arose.
image-quality <integer> => When jpeg compressing images use this quality
image-dpi <integer> => When embedding images scale them down to this dpi
Hi Federico,
I have created a patch to enable sPDF to auto detect xvfb-run, if it exists it will run wkhtmltopdf using xvfb-run. This would allow sPDF to run in a headless Ubuntu 18.04 server or any other debian headless server.

Hi
I was not able to run sPDF in Ubuntu 18.04 as WKHtmltopdf is unable to run in Debian as headless. The suggested  approach was to use xvfb.
Could sPDF be improved to allow it to run with xvfb? Below is a sample of the command 
 xvfb-run -- /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf --lowquality http://www.google.com google.pdf

I did a fork of the project. I can't a good place to expand the api, hence i did a hardcode to add "-- /usr/bin/wkhtmlpdf" as the argument, where the path is "xvfb-run".
I created an implementation for wkhtmltoimage, but was unable to test because wkhtmltopdf/image seems to be hanging in the tests.

Please review and comment about anything.

Basically I just copied and pasted the Pdf and PdfConfig classes and changed some strings here and there. I could simplify the implementation by simply extending those classes and only overriding `findExecutable`. But I can't test this, so this'll have to do for now.
I'm trying to configure the DPI option but can't find any option to do so.
Is there a way to add your own parameters by overriding something? 
Currently PdfConfig.toParameters is hardcoded so I can't change what parameters are used. 
Maybe adding a`val custom: Seq[String] = Seq()` that can be overridden in the PdfConfig? 
The test that hangs is OutputStreamDestinationDocument / "pipe process STDOUT into destination stream" 
Is required https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/issues/1508

This library works on my mac just fine.

But, on, ubuntu 14.04, I have it installed like this:

``` shell
$ which wkhtmltopdf
/usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf

$wkhtmltopdf -V
Name:
  wkhtmltopdf 0.9.9
...
```

I am using it like this:

``` scala
val html: String = "<html> .... "
val pdf = Pdf("/usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf", PdfConfig.default)
val destination = File.createTempFile("html2pdf", ".pdf")
val exitCode = pdf.run(html, destination)
if (exitCode != 0) Logger.error(s"PDF generation task exited with non-zero exitCode=$exitCode")
if (destination.length() == 0) Logger.warn(s"Generated PDF is empty")
```

But, I see that exitCode is 1 and the generated PDF is empty.
What's wrong? Why is it silently failing? It does not print any other helpful debug info at all! How can I make it print debug info and underlying error?
