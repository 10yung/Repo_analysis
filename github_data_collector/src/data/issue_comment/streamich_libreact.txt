*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

## :rotating_light: The automated release from the `master` branch failed. :rotating_light:

I recommend you give this issue a high priority, so other packages depending on you could benefit from your bug fixes and new features.

You can find below the list of errors reported by **semantic-release**. Each one of them has to be resolved in order to automatically publish your package. Iâ€™m sure you can resolve this ðŸ’ª.

Errors are usually caused by a misconfiguration or an authentication problem. With each error reported below you will find explanation and guidance to help you to resolve it.

Once all the errors are resolved, **semantic-release** will release your package the next time you push a commit to the `master` branch. You can also manually restart the failed CI job that runs **semantic-release**.

If you are not sure how to resolve this, here is some links that can help you:
- [Usage documentation](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/usage/README.md)
- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/support/FAQ.md)
- [Support channels](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#get-help)

If those donâ€™t help, or if this issue is reporting something you think isnâ€™t right, you can always ask the humans behind **[semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/new)**.

### Invalid npm token.

The [npm token](https://github.com/semantic-release/npm/blob/master/README.md#npm-registry-authentication) configured in the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable must be a valid [token](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/working_with_tokens) allowing to publish to the registry `https://registry.npmjs.org/`.

If you are using Two-Factor Authentication, make configure the `auth-only` [level](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-two-factor-authentication#levels-of-authentication) is supported. **semantic-release** cannot publish with the default `auth-and-writes` level.

Please make sure to set the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable in your CI with the exact value of the npm token.

If you create a child with a style (even an empty one) like this:
```
    render() {
        return (
            <SizeSensor onSize={this.onResize}>
                <div style={{}}>
                    {this.props.children}
                </div>
            </SizeSensor>
        );
    }
```
SizeSensor throws the error below. Removing the style attribute fixes the issue.

Hello,

I give a try for this : <OutsideClick>, but it show this error : `Uncaught TypeError: root.contains is not a function    at index.js:35    at Array.some`

This is because root is equal to the element a this point, and el does not have a contains function.

Error with `Wrapper = styled('div')({})`
```jsx
 <OutsideClick onClick={() => setOpen(false)}>
        <Wrapper>
```

Works with 
```jsx
<OutsideClick onClick={() => setOpen(false)}>
      <div>
        <Wrapper>
```
It seems that the ref is not handle correctly. I'll switch to https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useOutsideClick.md for now, but I prefer this way instead of the react-use one
Create `<iframe>` component that renders children in an iframe; all events should still work.
