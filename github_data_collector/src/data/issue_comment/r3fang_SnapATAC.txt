Hello,
When I try to create a snap object with the following command

```
x.sp = createSnap(
	file=c("RJ_ATACseq_from_cellranger.snap"),
	sample=c("Pancreas_190724"),
	num.cores=1
	)
```
it gives me the following error
```
Error in data.frame(barcode, TN, UM, PP, UQ, CM) : arguments imply differing number of rows: 0, 8241
9.
stop(gettextf("arguments imply differing number of rows: %s", paste(unique(nrows), collapse = ", ")), domain = NA)

lapply(as.list(seq(fileList)), function(i) { createSnapSingle(file = fileList[[i]], sample = sampleList[[i]]) })
2.

1.
createSnap(file = c("RJ_ATACseq_from_cellranger.snap"), sample = c("Pancreas_190724"), num.cores = 1)
```
In addition, in the console it is showing the following error
```
Epoch: reading the barcode session ...
[1] "Warning @readSnap: 'BD/name' not found in  RJ_ATACseq_from_cellranger.snap"
An open HDF5 file handle exists. If the file has changed on disk meanwhile, the function may not work properly. Run 'h5closeAll()' to close all open HDF5 object handles.An open HDF5 file handle exists. If the file has changed on disk meanwhile, the function may not work properly.

```
I ran the `h5closeAll()` command but the problem continues. I looked into #78 and updated rhdf5 to rhdf5_2.28.1 but the problem continues. Can you please let me know how to solve the issue.
Hi,
When creating gmat, is it possible to just make counts under a promoter region of a gene, instead of everywhere on the gene?

Thanks!!!

can anyone help with this - kind of emergent analysis...much appreciated...
Hi, 

Is there any way to find DARs between different samples (ie, compare DARs between different samples as opposed to different clusters)? I've read in my different samples into one snap file and called peaks for each sample, but can't figure out how to get the DARs because there is a cluster.pos option but not a sample option in the findDAR step. 

Thank you!
Hi~ 
    I got my data(.bam file) at http://atlas.gs.washington.edu/mouse-atac/data/. And I generated snap  file using the bam file according to your instruction.
    But I don't have a CSV file that conatin the information as  your example (atac_v1_adult_brain_fresh_5k_singlecell.csv, http://renlab.sdsc.edu/r3fang/share/github/Mouse_Brain_10X/atac_v1_adult_brain_fresh_5k_singlecell.csv) 
    I'm wondering how can I perform barcode selection under this circumstanceï¼Ÿ

Best,

Dear developer (Rongxin),

I am impressed by the package that it can compute the peak-to-gene link. You mentioned in the tutorial that '# convert the pair to genome browser arc plot format'. What is the visualization tool you used?

Many thanks,

Dear developer,
I used the runMACS to get the aggregated peaks for each cluster, and the question is whether the peaks are normalized by the cell numbers or total reads in the cluster. For example, if I want to show differential peak-to-gene connection, and the cell numbers among clusters are quite different, the overall peak values are already quite different. Thus I have a concern that the comparison may not be as unbiased (at least in visualization). Is it possible that normalization could be made after the aggregation of the peak?

Thanks for creating such a great package: it is efficient, versatile and well documented!
Hi, 

I am having trouble running the function "runJDA". I was looking at the man, and pretty much searching everywhere in your repo and online, but I haven't found a solution. Was this function discontinued on the last "SnapATAC" update? Thats the one I am currently  running 

Thank you!

Hi,
Do anyone know why I identified no DARs under the threshold of FDR<0.05 using snapATAC ?

I analyzed my human 10x genomics scATAC-seq data according to '10X Adult Mouse Brain' tutorial and tried to find DARs by:
```
DARs = findDAR(
        obj=x.sp,
        input.mat="pmat",
        cluster.pos=cluster_i,
        cluster.neg=NULL,
        cluster.neg.method = DAR.method, #knn or random
        bcv= 0.4,
        test.method="exactTest",
        seed.use=10
    );
```
However, no significant DARs were identified for each cluster.
Do anyone have the same problem?

Thanks!
Hi Rongxin,

SnapATAC is an awesome package for single cell ATAC-seq analysis. After peak calling by MACS2, I am wondering how can I generate the bdg or bigwig file of a subset of nuclei based on combined peaks.

Thanks,
