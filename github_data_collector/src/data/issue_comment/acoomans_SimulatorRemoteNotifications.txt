Hi, thanks a lot for this library !

didReceiveRemoteNotification: fetchCompletionHandler is called even if the app is in background when I send a notification from your iOS Simulator Notifications. (on 4s 9.0)

In your documentation, you said:
`Note that if you send a notification while the app is in the background, application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: will only be called when you bring the app to the foreground.`

How to call it only when I bring the app to the foreground ? 


My application is written in React Native. How should I bind this library with my app? Any clue?

I'm getting this error: 

`ld: library not found for -lObjC`

Is there a Cordova/Phonegap available? 

How easy/hard would it be to use it in Cordova apps?

Hello!
First of all, I'd like to thank you for this nice tool!

I'm trying to simulate some notifications on an iOS 9 device, which supports a [new payload size limit of either 2KB or 4KB](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/TheNotificationPayload.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH107-SW1). However, SimulatorRemoteNotification seems to truncate the payload after a certain amount of bytes (256?), which results in the following error:

```
SimulatorRemoteNotification: error = Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=3840
"Unterminated string around character 313." UserInfo={NSDebugDescription=Unterminated
 string around character 313.}
```

I tried multiplying the values of the following constants by 8, but this seemed to have no effect:

```
UIApplication+SimulatorRemoteNotifications.m\SimulatorRemoteNotificationsBufferLength
ACSimulatorRemoteNotificationsService.m\SimulatorRemoteNotificationsServiceBufferLength
```

How can the code be modified to support the increased payload size?

P.S.
I know the payload I'm testing is valid because it gets delivered successfully through APNS when testing with a real device.

(Edit: updated the link to the documentation where the payload size is discussed)


Currently the NSTextView replaces any input quotes with quotes that break the JSON validation.

So `"key":"value"` becomes `“key”:”value”`. This just disables that in `applicationDidFinishLaunching`.
