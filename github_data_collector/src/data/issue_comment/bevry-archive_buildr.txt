As of v0.8.2, the command-line tool supplies a minimal build handler argument to the "process" method. This handler has the effect of overriding any build handler which may be configured. The changes in this pull request have the following effects:
- omit the command-line tool build handler, so that the configured or default build handler is used
- bind any configured build handler to the Buildr instance (previously, only the default handlers were so bound)
