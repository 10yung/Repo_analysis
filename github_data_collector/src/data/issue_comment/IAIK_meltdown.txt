you are wrong using cygwin you can run all the commands and get successful results.  
Hi,

If I run 'memdump' with 1st argument omitted, I get the following error:

> dell@dell-OptiPlex-7050:~/mtech_project/meltdown$ $ taskset 0x3 ./memdump  -1 0xffff916b80000000 
Error converting physical to virtual address

So to get over this, I run the 'secret' binary to get some random physical address. That address is 0x383d7c810.
Then in one terminal window, I keep following command running( RAM size:16 GB):

> dell@dell-OptiPlex-7050:~/mtech_project/meltdown$ ./memory_filler 15
[+] Press any key if you are done reading the secret

In other terminal window, I run the following command:

> dell@dell-OptiPlex-7050:~/mtech_project/meltdown$ taskset 0x1 ./memdump  0x383d7c810  100  0xffff916b80000000 
[+] Physical address       : 0x383d7c810
[+] Physical offset        : 0xffff916b80000000
[+] Virtual address       : 0xffff916f03d7c810

As can be seen, I am not getting any memory dump. 

Am I doing anything wrong?

Also, the reading speed of 'reliability' is around 1 read/3.5 secs.  I tried altering various parameters given at the end of the README but it didnt make any significant changes. Is this the normal speed?

User applications using libkdump may use memory incorrectly and
cause segmentation fault. Our handler never checks for the source
of segmentation fault and always redirects them into
`libkdump_read_signal_handler`.

GCC, MSVC and CLANG provide intrinsics for all the low-level assembly
operations attempted. Additionally, the 'meltdown sequence' can be
expressed in C code (as per the paper) with the appropriate volatile
statements. Finally, usage of MFENCE is not needed when using RDTSCP as
the latter is already serializing.
