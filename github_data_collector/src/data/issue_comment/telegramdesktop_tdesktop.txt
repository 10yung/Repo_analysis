### Steps to reproduce
1. have account with about 50 active channels and 2-3 chats, i think it's important
2. uptume 48h also important
3. go to view as guest some group chat with activity 500msg/day by click @somegroup without join
4. opens last messages, for example
message 1 18:00
message 2 18:15
message 3 18:45
message 4 19:00
message 5 19:15  **<-** this message shows less 1 second and disappears
5. go to **Shared Links** of group, i know that last message contains hyperlink and seeing it here! right click on it and **Go To Message**
6. and i see in chat
message 1 18:00
message 2 18:15
**message 5 19:15** 
message 3 18:45
message 4 19:00

I can say that watching a chat without joining does not always display the latest messages

nothing disappears

as above

win10 x64 1909, latest telegram desktop, this bug about 6 months

### Is your feature request related to a problem?
No

### Describe the solution you'd like
I know that "delivered to device" check has not been implemente dbecause Telegram is available for multiple devices. But I think that the user could have the possibility to activate this feature, specyfing that the "delivered to device" check popups when the message is delivered to at least one device. I think there's nothing wrong with such a feature, users would have the ability to enable/desable it in the chat settings (for example).
### Steps to reproduce
1. Pre-requirement: 
1.1 mac os with multiple users.
1.2 telegram with the same account on multiple devices (phone+mac)
2. Log into one mac os account
3. Launch telegram
4. Open dialog with person [p]
5. Keep telegram with opened dialog on front
6. Lock screen via apple-icon menu
7. Log into another mac os account (without telegram running on this account)
8. Have [p] send you messages

### Expected behaviour
[p] does not see your status as online
[p]'s messages are not marked as read until I open telegram on phone or log back into first account
I get notifications of [p]'s messages on phone


### Actual behaviour
[p] sees your status as online
[p]'s messages are marked as read
I don't get notifications of [p]'s messages on phone

### Configuration
**Operating system:**
macOS catalina 10.15.2 (19C57)

**Version of Telegram Desktop:**
v 1.8.15

**Used theme**:
default

### Is your feature request related to a problem?
Only the forwarding doesn't have keyboard hotkey. It will be better to have it for only keyboard using.

### Describe the solution you'd like
Add a hotkey combination for forwarding. Ctrl+ up&down to select message and Ctrl + shift  + F to pop up a window choose forwarding to.

Thanks
### Is your feature request related to a problem?
Some times chat participants are sending annoying images/gifs. You can delete such message locally but he/she can send it later over and over again.

### Describe the solution you'd like
Save hash of images/gifs in locally deleted message. Check for this hash before showing images in newly arrived messages from any participant. Images can be substituted with button to download blocked image manually.
