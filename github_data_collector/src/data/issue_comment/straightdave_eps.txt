Would be lovely to see a Desired State Configuration Composite Resource wrapper around `eps`.

Would allow one to be able to declaratively state/instantiate files from `eps` template. Something akin to the following DSC pseudo-code could be used for config management of a node's service configuration, for instance:
```
$epsBindingParams = @{
...
}

EpsTemplate MyConfigFile {
    Name = "someConfig.ini"
    Path = "someConfig.ini.eps"
    Binding = @epsBindingParams
}
```

And, given the same input `-bindings` and `-path`, the final eps output ought to always be the same (ie pure function), so comparing the hash of the eps output against any existing target file-on-disk should suffice as the Get and Test scenarios of a DSC Resource's required {Get, Test, Set} methods.

Also, thanks @straightdave for your efforts re: `EPS` PowerShell module in general- much appreciated!
Error output should be better and more helpful for template writers.
See #21 for details.
This should be done at the same time as better documentation for template troubleshooting (see #22) 
At least:

1. How to debug a template.
1. How to get verbose output.
1. General idea of how the templating system works.
