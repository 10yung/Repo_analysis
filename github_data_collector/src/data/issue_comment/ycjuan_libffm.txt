In the implement, there are almost no comments. It is hard to read and learn. 
It is known that C codes is harder to read than python lang.  That there are no comments make learner much harder. 
All in all, the implement is unfriendly. Please add necessary comments. At least, the members of structs would be commented. 
Thank you on behalf of everyone
for learning ffm, I would like to find a tf version of ffm.
How to output AUC-ROC on console?

Hello!

I'm about to finish a generalised wrapper for "predict" and "ffm_load_model" function in Java. It would be great if you will review my code and then add it to your library if you deem it fit.

Thank You
`g++ -Wall -O3 -std=c++0x -march=native -fopenmp -DUSESSE -DUSEOMP -c -o ffm.o ffm.cpp

Are there any plans of incorporating bias and linear terms in this new re-factored version ? 
I know they're included in v114 on the website but if I'm not mistaken they're still not on master (I think?).
Thanks !
Hi @guestwalk !

Thanks a lot for the awesome library. It's certainly made my life a lot easier.

Since we get a segfault for files that are too large, is there a way to learn from chunks of data? In other words, can an existing model be updated with new data?

Thanks again,
Sorry for being ignorant, can I put `float` type value in the input data?
Can two field have the same feature id, which means the feature id is associated with field?
