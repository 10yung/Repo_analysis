When my Twilio account trial period ended all SSH logins started failing with this misleading error:

    Invalid token. try again

Its not helped by the lack of information on the Authy Dashboard regarding the linked Twilio account.

There are several security issues with this implementation of token checking (https://github.com/authy/authy-ssh/issues/40 or https://github.com/authy/authy-ssh/issues/30).
Are there any plans to implement a pam module like google authenticator? I believe it is a more standard and less error prone way of implementing the authentication checking.

Since installing authy-ssh, I've noticed that the normal Ubuntu banner (which displays how many updates might be pending, and whether a reboot is necessary) no longer shows on logon. Why would authy-ssh prevent from this displaying, and is there a way to unwind this or display both authy-ssh's banner, and the original Ubuntu one?
Whenever I try and add new public keys using `ssh-copy-id`for new remote clients to a server that uses `authy-ssh`, it will give me three immediately failed attempts to enter the authy generated token into the terminal, without giving me the possibility to check authy for a code and entering it. Is there a better way to send keys to an authy-hardened ssh server, do I need to disable authy temporarily, or are there some other options I should be using I'm not aware of?
I was using authy-ssh on a gateway server in AWS, to talk to other machines that weren't accessible from the public internet, before I found out about https://github.com/authy/authy-ssh/issues/30. Allowing port forwarding without the second factor in my use case was the same as having no 2-fac auth at all. That's a pretty big deal, and if it can't be fixed, I'm surprised it's not documented in the README.

https://github.com/authy/authy-ssh/issues/40 might also be a big deal for a lot of use cases.
I am using Bitvise to access my ssh. But when I open sftp, it can't open. Any suggest?

`register_user_on_authy()` currently failed if email contains "+" (e.g. kazuki.suda+authy@gmail.com

Very interesting project! 

Have a security question, have you had the "Shellslocker" in mind, or maybe this bug is already solved (don't know). Even with a patch, there are still a lot of servers out there without the patch and still with this vulnerability. Maybe a quick solution would be to patch the bug with the installation script.

Still, wonderful project!

Hello!
I really like this script but would like to get a log of the login attempts so that I can forward this to fail2ban.

Would that be possible?

Will OneTouch be supported in authy-ssh ?
