Hi,

Thanks for the excellent work on this. Do you know how to stop the toolbar menu from  hiding while scrolling down ? and if possible how to change the font-size of the code cell ?
Whenever I include code in a heading cell, the size of the code doesn't react to the fact that it is a heading cell

``` # `getData.py` ``` gives the same output (visually) as ``` `getData.py` ```
