When I read “boss_train.py”,I found a constant named "FILE_PATH".I can't find its value "./store/model.h5" in any folders.Is it a forein file?

Thanks in advance.

As the title says, can this project work on Windows10?
I run the boss_train.py, but there is an error called "AttributeError". It says that, 'ProgbarLogger' object has no attribute 'log_values'.
Does anyone know how this problem happens?
Thanks!
I have accomplish the model's train and evaluate,the evaluate result is 93%,but when I predict face on my camera , the process will think of all the faces as me . I should how to the problem。
