I'm trying use [Support authorization options on request ](https://github.com/twitter/twurl/pull/131)

When I run with a user without `$HOME` directory, in the case www-data (apache user),  I'm getting the error:

```
/var/lib/gems/2.5.0/gems/twurl-0.9.5/lib/twurl/rcfile.rb:6:in `expand_path': couldn't find login name -- expanding `~' (ArgumentError)
	from /var/lib/gems/2.5.0/gems/twurl-0.9.5/lib/twurl/rcfile.rb:6:in `directory'

```

I belive that is correlated this bug in another ruby project.

[# fixes: couldn't find login name expanding tilde (cont.)](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-puppet/pull/1082/commits/46af93aab03cf41aa086797849f9819ee555c048)

As workaround,  I change RCFile class

```rb
module Twurl
  class RCFile
    FILE = '.twurlrc'
    class << self
      def directory
        @@directory ||= '' 
        #@@directory ||= File.expand_path('~')
```

### Expected behavior

Send request without `.twurlrc ` file

### Actual behavior

twurl crash and print a error message

### Steps to reproduce the behavior

- install a php + apache setup on linux
- install twurl
- create php script with a `shell_exec` command executing twurl with all authentication options


Since macOS now ships with zsh by default, it would be nice to have a shell completion formula.
Enhancement idea - enable individual apps and entries in .twurlrc to be labelled. I currently have about 25 apps and accounts and frequently forget which is the correct token I need to switch over to.
In the code/command below, note that my first parameter has two dashes (per this video: https://youtu.be/SF22GlA_nZU) and my second parameter erroneously has _no_ dashes.

When I entered this in twurl:
`twurl authorize --consumer-key xZNotMyRealKeyJO consumer-secret tYNotMyRealSecretNotMyRealSecretNotMyRealSecretzj`

twurl gave this misleading message:
> Authorization failed. Check that your consumer key and secret are correct, as well as username and password.

twurl should have told me: Syntax errorâ€¦
I was wondering if it'd be possible for one of you to add an argument to twurl that lets you specify your .twurlrc directory? I'd do it myself but I'm not really a ruby guy... I found my way around well enough to hard-code in where I needed it to look though, so not exactly urgent, but I think it'd be cool and if either of you agree and have the time it'd be really good.

Something like -P /home/user/.twurlrc would be super. 

Note: the reason for this request is that I'm calling twurl from another service that strips out all ENV stuff, including location of homedir.

By executing Twurl with a pre-loaded access token and consumer keyset while including a "--pretend" or "--only-generate-http-headers" option it would output a string simply consisting of the HTTP Authorization header. Developers could then use Twurl as a pipe for shell scripts with the ultimate destination of curl for the additional features it offers as an HTTP client.
