ConvertTo-CamelCase #3 Fix ConvertTo-CamelCase so that it works with strings that have multiple instances of cmdlet names

There's a bug in ConvertTo-CamelCase where only the first cmdlet is properly converted.  Other cmdlets in the string get converted, but they lose the hyphen.  

Please no one fix this.  I have coded the fix and will be giving a live demo of the pull request during Techstravaganza tomorrow.
