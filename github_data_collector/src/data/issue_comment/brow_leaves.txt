Hi,

How to enable zooming option.

Observed a weird issue. Scanned documents are not rendering. We can't see any content. But when we zoom in/out, we are able to see the content but content is upside down (90 degrees) to actual document.
Could you please help here.

I saw a closed issue with a commit that fixed #3. It did so by breaking iOS 3.0 support. Even though I don't think anyone uses iOS3 anymore I still added retina support without breaking build for that platform. Just look at the code and see if you want it in the main repo.

New example that shows how to render an UIView in the context. closes #33

In the examples project, every page is rendered using core graphics. I have a UIView want to displaying in the next page, it's a grid view layout page. How to make it to show at the next page in the - (void)renderPageAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index inContext:(CGContextRef)ctx method?
