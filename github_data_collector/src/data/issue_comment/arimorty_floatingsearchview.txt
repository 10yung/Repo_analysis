For home action clickListener method never gets called.

```
searchInputView.setOnHomeActionClickListener(new FloatingSearchView.OnHomeActionClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onHomeClicked() {
           Log.d(TAG,"Home action clicked");

            }
        });
```
Instead of using a static Arraylist like :   
 private static List<ColorSuggestion> sColorSuggestions =
            new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(
                    new ColorSuggestion("green"),
                    new ColorSuggestion("blue"),
               ....));'

To use a list with the most recent searches as suggestions.

Error inflating when using in android 4.3
I changed "compile" to "implementation" in README.md, because it's deprecated.

I got one FloatingSearchView(id: search_bar, and I have no other view with the same id or other FloatingSearchView) in the third page of the four-paged viewpager. In the second loading of the third page(I click the third page then first page and the third again), , I ran it and got `java.lang.ClassCastException: android.view.AbsSavedState$1 cannot be cast to com.arlib.floatingsearchview.FloatingSearchView$SavedState`. After searching for the solution and didn't got the one for my case, I try to change the id to another like "search_bar_test" or else and it worked. I thought there might be a view with id "search_bar" or other reason...(haven't checked the source code)
Text action menus without icon automatically go to the overflow section because of [the line 178 in MenuView](https://github.com/arimorty/floatingsearchview/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/arlib/floatingsearchview/util/view/MenuView.java)
```
List<MenuItemImpl> localActionItems = filter(mMenuItems, new MenuItemImplPredicate() {
	@Override
	public boolean apply(MenuItemImpl menuItem) {
		return menuItem.getIcon() != null && (menuItem.requiresActionButton() || menuItem.requestsActionButton());
	}
});
```

I don't think `menuItem.getIcon() != null` is nessesary because option `always|withText` without icon is possible
