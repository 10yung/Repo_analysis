added nbformat to environment file to make reoccurring "Notebook JSON is invalid" go away.
created environment file using the repo's `environment.yml` and was getting the below error quite frequently.
```
[E 22:54:05.375 NotebookApp] Notebook JSON is invalid: 'application/vnd.bokehjs_load.v0+json' does not match any of the regexes: '^(?!application/json$)[a-zA-Z0-9]+/[a-zA-Z0-9\\-\\+\\.]+$'
    
    Failed validating 'additionalProperties' in display_data['properties']['data']:
    
    On instance['cells'][5]['outputs'][1]['data']:
    {'application/javascript': '\n'
                               '(function(root) {\n'
                               '  function now() {\n'
                               '    return new Date();\n'
                               '  }...',
     'application/vnd.bokehjs_load.v0+json': '\n'

                                             '  function now() {\n'
                                             '    return new Date();\n'
                                             '  }...'}
```  

some searching indicated to install `conda install -n bokeh nbformat`  

and problem seems to have gone away
tutorial 10 explicitly links in the CSS from cdn.pydata.org.  When we stop having the empty CSS files there, it will break.

Also, the version of the CSS and JS being linked in the tutorial is old.  Probably need to search for 'bokeh-\d+\.\d+\.\d+' and replace it with the version set in envioronment.yml
