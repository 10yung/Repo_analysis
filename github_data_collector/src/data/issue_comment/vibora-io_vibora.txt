Wanted to give vibora a try but whenever I run "vibora new project_name" which is how the docs says how to create a project, it says that the command is not recognized. I have it installed in a virtualenv.

**Describe the bug**
My  code:
@app.route('/', methods=[ 'POST'])
async def execute_function(request: Request):
   request_body = await request.json()

Run Test is ok , But   some times   go wrong !  "Stream already consumed"
So  I changed   request_body_byte = await request.stream.read();  but  also !

Is the framework still maintained?

 Vibora is such a lovely framework who is fast ,and elegant .However I couldn't find any information about CORS in docs . I mean , it's regretful that if here's such a fast framework but you can't use it to build cross origin apis ,isn't it ?

Will you provides CORS supports in future? OR this feature is already exists and I just miss something in docs. Looking forward to replies, thanks.
I want to implement token authentication in my application.

The best practice for this would be to enter a `return` inside the hook of` Event.BEFORE_ENDPOINT`?

I mean something like this:
```python
@app.handle(Events.BEFORE_ENDPOINT)
async def before_response(request: Resquest):
    authorized = False
    if not authorized:
        return Response('Please log in.') 
```

If that's not the best way, could someone give me a better example?

When I try to install it I get an error saying I need Visual C++ 14 but I can't find v14 anywhere on the web. Could you direct me somehow?
