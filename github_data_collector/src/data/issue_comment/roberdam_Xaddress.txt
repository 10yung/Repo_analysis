For encoding the coordinates into Xaddress you have to currently use tables based on territory of states. This system has some disadvantages:
* it's unclear which table use for disputed or occupied territories like Crimea or Kosovo (requiring use of e.g. Serbian table for Kosovo could also make the adoption of Xaddress hard there),
* when there is new independent state, you have to update the whole system to include it (including independent implementations),
* it cannot be used for encoding something being outside of jurisdiction of any state (like high seas).

Possible solution (but you can came up with your own):
* to use instead the "territory" of natural time zones (or US military time zones) - 24 regions marked e.g. with name of a greek letter (Alpha, Beta, Gamma,... starting from UTC+1)
* The P2 numbers can start on (-90, -8) as 0000 and continue by (-90, -7) as 0001, (-89, -8) as 0017 until (90, 7) as 2700 for UTC+0 (or Zulu/Omega). Positions in other time zones would be recalculated to UTC+0 and marked with their name in the final address. This could be calculated by an algorithm both by hand and by machine.

This could encode everything what can be encoded now, but it wouldn't require change because of occupation or establishment of a new state. It could additionally encode any position on Earth (including those on high seas) and theoretically also positions on another planets and moons (introducing regions by 15Â° of longitude).

What do you think or do you have another idea how to solve the issue?
There ought to be a collection of test cases suitable for regression-testing both encoding and decoding and for validation of new implementations.
I tried the demo site and my location happens to have assigned an address like WHO SUCKER and WHO ROBBERY. I am certain nobody would want to have those words in his Xaddress (or any geocoded location). I quick search in en.csv and adj_en.csv shows there are many inaproppriate words.

This looks awesome. I will build an Android app for this project.
Awesome work!!

In large buildings with lots of small apartments, you may share the same geographical location as 10 neighbours. This would limit it being used by postal services without a combination with a appartment number or similar.
