this model can not do faceswap with blinking and opening mouth ？how to solve it ？
Hi @YadiraF! Thank you for your great work!
I was using your code to generate some 3D faces from images. On viewing the mesh in Meshlab/Blender, I observed there are some ridges and grooves on the surface of the face. That is, the surface is not smooth, but instead has ups and downs. On zooming in, I noticed that this is because the vertices were selected in such a manner. The triangles were forming the ups and downs. Please see the images:

How do I make the surface smoother and eliminate these ups and downs?

- Is it possible to generate multiple face 3D information maps on a single picture containing multiple faces at the same time?
Hi, author,
I was confused that how to make triangles.txt file. I also want to know how to make it although you publish it.

I tried PRNet with pretrained model. But some problem were found as attached image. It seems that uv cannot fit the predicted mesh very well. As a result, we can see two nostrils, which is so weird. Anybody can help me out? I would be appricate that. 
Hi all,
     we are unable to run using python 6.3.8 and tensorflow 2.0 versions we are getting following errors
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow.python.util.framework'
Which version this application works? please provide... 
Thanks in advance,
MSLB

3 d reconstruction results of Iterative Closest Points (ICP), how detailed test?The reconstructed evaluation in your article is NME normalized by outer interocular distance, but how to do it?
if you have method optimize it , for example, the function "render_texture"  spends 8s
Hi, it is a great project , i am really thankful for it.
i want to know how can i improve its fps when i am running it in webcam. Right now, i am getting only 1 or 2 fps. Please tell me how can i improve it for real time purpose.
is anybody know how does the uv_kpt_ind.txt generate?
