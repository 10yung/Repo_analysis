Fixed the README.md markup formating :)
Fix typo.

wouldn't it be better to use https://vagrantcloud.com/ instead?

you wouldn't have to include the url of the box and it's easier to version it

"[Getting Started](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki#getting-started)" says to find the template.html file, but I haven't found where to download it. I searched the files I cloned from https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss, but wasn't able to find it.

I thought perhaps I was downloading the wrong thing, so I searched for something else to download. In the "[Getting Started section in the faq](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki/FAQ#getting-started-how-do-i-work-with-these-files)" step 1 says to download the whole project, but the link doesn't lead anywhere.

Hi

This url seems to be down: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/558452/vagrant/package.box

Thanks
Matt

As posted on the OOCSS forum: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/object-oriented-css/m5m_SbCLoCc
The issue I had was with checkboxes and radio buttons...as long as my HTML was like the examples, it was fine, but sometimes I like to wrap my <label> tag around the checkbox or radio button, e.g.:

```
<label>
  <input type="checkbox"> Check me
</label>
```

And if I want to use the style shown in the docs, I just need to add the hanging-indent class:

```
<input type="checkbox" id="checkbox1">
<label for="checkbox1" class="hangingIndent"> Check me</label>
```

If anyone has any other ideas I think it would be good to discuss them, but in any case I think both styles of HTML should be supported.

I'm happy to update the documentation file as well if this pull request is accepted. Thank you.

During running win-start.bat I get   " Error: Connection timeout. Retrying... " after the command " ssh auth method: private key "
Any ideas?

hi there,

I was just setup a download vm, vagrant, tortoises etc, and i download the latest .zip file from git, then i unzip it, and then i open 
oocss-master\oocss\start\ 
and double click win-start.bat, then i let it download something box. and after it completed, i use putty login 127.0.0.1 port 2222
and use the command: make build under 
oocss-master\oocss folder, 

then the command runs, and success,

and it outputs a build folder, which contains some example html files, but they seems missing a doc.css, and the things are broken to me, and when i looked into the css folder, nothing there... what have i done wrong? Please advice.

Thanks,
Viggy

The google group would probably be a more appropriate place to have this kind of discussion, but my membership is taking a while to approve.

In this simple example of buttons with icons, a few questions appeared, and the best option didn't seem clear. Please advise your preferred answer, and if necessary explain why.

The questions are the following and are explained here: https://dpaste.de/FF2D#L10,48,87
1. **.class.combination VS .longClasses VS child selector**
2. **(*) selector VS extra .content class VS multiple selectors**
3. **Child VS Descendant selectors**

EDIT 1: For each question select an option, for example:
1C
2A
3B

EDIT 2: If you are wondering why the button text is wrapped in a span, the objective is to keep the icon and the text equally vertically-aligned: http://jsfiddle.net/5WCSz/11/
If you know a better way, please let know.
