The example for SwitchTransition isn't a complete example, the FadeTransition element isn't defined anywhere which takes from the explanation of SwitchTransition.

I changed out the FadeTransition for CSSTransition and defined the fade classes to remove any unnecessary confusion.
Hello beautiful humans,

I'm using ReactCSSTransitionGroup on a mobile website. This animation works perfectly fine with every navigators but Safari.

```
const backgroundTransition = {
  enter: 'animated',
  enterActive: 'fadeIn',
  leave: 'animated',
  leaveActive: 'fadeOut',
};

const Modality = ({children, isDisplayed, onClose}) => (
  <Fragment>
    <ReactCSSTransitionGroup
      transitionName={backgroundTransition}
      transitionEnterTimeout={300}
      transitionLeaveTimeout={300}
    >

```
I mean it works but it's not smooth at all, it appears in two times. Do you have any idea ?

Thanks :)
> What is the current behavior?

I am working on an app built on Cordova and Electron (for Android and Windows use). The transitions are working (with a 450 ms timeout) on localhost but when I run the project on Electron and Android, the transitions are not working (like a 0 ms timeout). 

> What is the expected behavior?

It is possible that this library not work with Electron and Android?

> Code:

App.ts:
```
                <HashRouter>
                        <Route render={({location}) => (
                            <TransitionGroup>
                                <CSSTransition key={location.pathname} timeout={450} classNames="fade">
                                    <Switch location={location}>
                                        <Route exact path="/" component={Basket}/>
                                        <Route path="/manualentry" component={ManualEntry} />
                                        <Route path="/checkout" component={Checkout} />
                                        <Route path="/orderreceipt" component={OrderReceipt} />
                                        <Route path="/paymentscreen" component={PaymentScreen} />  
                                    </Switch>  
                                </CSSTransition>
                            </TransitionGroup>
                        )} />                                            
                </HashRouter>
```

App.css:
```
.page {
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    flex: 1;
	height: 100%;
}
  
.fade-appear,
.fade-enter {
    opacity: 0;
    z-index: 1;
}
  
.fade-appear-active,
.fade-enter.fade-enter-active {
    opacity: 1;
    transition: opacity 300ms linear 150ms;
}
  
.fade-exit {
    opacity: 1;
}
  
.fade-exit.fade-exit-active {
    opacity: 0;
    transition: opacity 150ms linear;
}
```

And in the components, I added a div in the beginning that calls the class "Page".

Thanks
> What is the current behavior?

I manage my front-end routes with @reach/router at present. And also use react-transition-group to manage the animation. When I first navigate into a component and click on an `<a>` element with an anchor, the animation will be triggered, which makes the anchor doesn't work at first click. But everything goes right after the first click. When I refresh the current page and do the same stuff, the animation also doesn't be triggered so the anchor could work.

> What is the expected behavior?

When I first navigate into a component and click the element with an anchor, the animation shouldn't be triggered. Otherwise, the anchor wouldn't work for the first time.

> Could you provide a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) demo reproducing the bug?

Sure, here is the demo(Please be sure to run this demo in a new window otherwise the anchor wouldn't work in CodeSandbox's iframe):  
[Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/transitiongroup-sko0c?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark)  
All you need to do is to click the page1 link one first, Then click the article link. Now try to click the content list on the right of the page to observe what happen next. You will find that the first click triggers the route changing animation which causes the anchor doesn't work.

I have tried to animate views that are lazy loaded with `React.lazy();`

i have just picked the example at [link](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/with-react-router/) and modified the Components to be lazy loaded.

then i suspect when trying to unmount `React.Suspense` breaks something. [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/csstransition-react-router-dqqwq)

> What is the current behavior?

When using `CSSTransition` with `in` set to `false`, I don't see any class names get applied to the child element.

> What is the expected behavior?
I expect there to be some class applied by default.

My use case is along the lines of a slideshow where there is one slide showing at a time, but for purposes of SEO, each slide should always be rendered in the DOM. Below is a Sandbox illustrating the basic idea. In the sandbox, you can see that no class names are applied by default, and once you do a full rotation through the slides, everything is good.

(also, ignore the fact that there's no animations/transitions, just illustrating the absense of default classnames)

> Could you provide a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) demo reproducing the bug?

https://codesandbox.io/s/trusting-dan-clrid

If there's another way to be doing this, let me know. I might be misusing `CSSTransition` in this context.

# Timeout prop is still mandatory while addEndListener is in use in TypeScript

## Expected behaviour
- **timeout** prop shouldn't be required when **addEndListener** is used. According to docs.

## Actual behaviour
- **timeout** prop is always required
> What is the current behavior?

Use of <SwitchTransition> results in Error
`A cross-origin error was thrown. React doesn't have access to the actual error object in development. See https://fb.me/react-crossorigin-error for more information.
`
everywhere ive tried to use it.

> What is the expected behavior?

`<SwitchTransition>` just works
