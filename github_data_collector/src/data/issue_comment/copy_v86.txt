This closes #297. It automatically builds libv86 with Travis CI and publishes it to GitHub Pages.

I only added ACPI build, but normal build can also be added if needed. File, as well as sourcemap, will then be published to `gh-pages` branch.

However, compaling fails because of some error (at least on Travis CI on my repository):

```
java.lang.NullPointerException: No warning class for name: ambiguousFunctionDecl

```

It is interesting that even without any modifications to `Makefile` (in final version I did some modifications to include sourcemap), it fails. So it may be problem with newer version of Closure Compiler.
I tried to use Arch Linux via v86 on your website to download the v86 sources via git, and it failed.  The way it failed, it looks like there are files that the the Arch Linux image thinks it has that aren't available to it.

Going to https://i.copy.sh/arch/usr/lib/git-core/git-remote-https I get this:

I know this occurs for these files:

- https://i.copy.sh/arch/usr/lib/git-core/git
- https://i.copy.sh/arch/usr/lib/git-core/git-remote-http

I first noticed this problem a few months ago, and at the time I ran a few other commands and was able to find some other files that also appeared to be missing from the server, but I didn't write up an issue at the time, and now I don't remember which files they were.

Can you automatically build `libv86.js` on Travis CI at every commit and publish it to some server or GitHub Pages? This would be very good because users then won't need to install and configure Closure Compiler and other build dependencies.

Can you also configure `Makefile` to also build sourcemap file for `libv86.js`?

Also, the version on [your website](https://copy.sh/v86/) is very old (from 2018). Can you also update it?
So I was in the middle of setting up Windows 2000, and before it could show drives to install Windows on, it got a BSoD. I retried, the same thing happened again.
It has the error code "0x0000007B (0xF2463848,0xC0000034,0x00000000,0x00000000)"
and says "INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE".
The ISO I have has worked in the past for every emulator I've used, and I even tried retrying it via VirtualBox & QEMU, the ISO works.
I decided to try setting up Windows 2K since the furthest edition of Windows uploaded for the public was Windows 98, and I wanted to try something new as well.

I've been trying to figure out how to get the Arch Linux image to be able to connect to the internet the way the Linux 3.18 image does, but I can't figure it out.  I found an old issue which indicates that the Arch Linux image could connect to the internet previously, but running `udhcpc` (as is done for the Linux 3.18 image) tells me `-bash: udhcpc: command not found`, running `busybox udhcpc` (because the `udhcpc` binary on the Linux image is a symlink to a `busybox` binary) tells me `udhcpc: SIOCGIFINDEX: No such device`, and running `dhcpcd -w4` (as described in #23) results in this:
```
dev: loaded udev
no valid intervaces found
timed out
forked to background, child pid \<number\>
```

I've tried several times to dig into this more, but I'm having difficulty understanding it.
Originally noted in issue #286 

**To reproduce:** On the Windows 98 demo, play a wave sound file, and as it is playing, hover the cursor over the play button.
**Expected:** The tooltips should show up immediately and the sound playback should be uninterrupted.
**Observed:** The sound is interrupted, and only when you move the mouse does the tooltip animation start to update, and the next sound fragment is played.

Other kinds of animation also produce this effect, e.g. opening the start menu, opening menus, and minimising the window.
I have a x86 Windows 98 ISO I have used to boot to on your website.
It works perfect on VirtualBox, except when I tried it on your website, it went fine, until it started downloading display and VGA drivers by default. It all became packed into small pixels, and I made it send CTRL+ALT+DELETE, which rebooted the OS, only finding out the display and VGA were screwed forever.

I converted it to a .IMG file, it works perfectly, so is it that .ISO files are supported, just not stable, or is it that it's just my ISO?

I found it on [winworld](https://winworldpc.com/), and I am not sure if it has been modified slightly or if it's v86.
Hi,

I'm trying to upgrade to a later seabios (https://git.seabios.org/cgit/seabios.git/snapshot/seabios-rel-1.12.1.zip) but getting no where, getting blank screen after updating seabios.bin and vgabios.bin, which options did you use to compile the current version ? (I see you removed the config file here https://github.com/copy/v86/blob/765fc7f06ea6ddf8710ed160af715f7977bf0b92/bios/seabios-config ) which indeed doesn't "fix" the issue 


Any clues would be helpful :)
