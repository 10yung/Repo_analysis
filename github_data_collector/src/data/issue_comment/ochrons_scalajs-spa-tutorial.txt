This tutorial is one of the few and better resources to pick up some scalajs. The modal, however, doesn't work when upgrading to scalajs-react 1.4.

Perhaps the whole project can be updated to latest versions of everything.
-- sbt 1.2.8
-- sbt-scalajs 0.6.28
-- play 2.7.3
-- scala 2.12.8
-- scalajsDom 0.9.7
-- scalajsReact 1.4.2
-- react 16.8.6
-- jquery 3.4.1
-- bootstrap 4.3.1

- updated english gitbook docs
this tutorial is awesome, thanks!

I'm new to Play and some of the libraries here so some of this is dumb pattern-matching (`InjectedController`) that may not be the right way to do things.

I also disabled CSRF checking because it was 403'ing all requests; it will probably be good to fix that before merging.

Moving the `Settings.scala` into `build.sbt` to be idiomatic SBT 1.x style is a possible addition as well.
- Korean translation completely rewritten (#74)
- Made a small change on `the-client.md` to reflect change from the code
The Korean translation of the documentation seems to require a lot of fixing overall, from simple typos and grammatical mistakes to ambiguous and sometimes downright wrong wording.

Hi, I am new to ScalaJS React, Diode, etc. and trying out this project, and am building a search dialog that I want to contain a table of results. All is fine -- I can capture the Keyword (represented as a first class model object), do the search, and map the results to a Results object in the model, but I am having trouble nesting the result table in the search dialog, as the result table is currently tied to the Results object and I can't initialize the results child table component from the parent search dialog, as it looks as if the framework only supports a single model proxy inside a render method:

https://gitter.im/ochrons/scalajs-spa-tutorial/archives/2016/06/23

    def render(p: Props) = {
      Panel(Panel.Props("Search"), <.div(
        bss.formGroup, ^.marginTop := 20,
        <.label(^.`for` := "lookupField", "Keyword"),
        <.input.text(bss.formControl, ^.width := 200, ^.id := "keyword",
          ^.placeholder := "type keyword search term(s) here",
          ^.onBlur ==> findNearby(p.proxy)),
        <.br,
        <.p(p.proxy.value.getOrElse(Keyword("","")).id)
        // HOW DO I DO THIS? SearchResultsTable()
      ))
    }

Do I need to artificially create a new aggregate model object that captures both the query Keyword from the search dialog and the Results from the dialog's table, or is there another way that I am completely missing?

Thanks in advance....
I did as a documentation said and installed the latest jsdom npm package(v11.0.0) but I've got an error when running the tests: `TypeError: jsdom.createVirtualConsole is not a function`. I had to downgrade to v9.0.0 to make the tests run. 

The documentation should specify the version of jsdom that the app relies on(and it probably should be updated I guess). If you are ok with adding `@9.0.0` to the documentation I can do a quick PR.
Is it possible to include static assets (namely images), served from Play and referenced from Scala.js code? Tricky because—when, for example, using [sbt-digest](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-digest) to fingerprint assets—the final asset name isn't known and reverse `Assets` routes and `AssetsFinder` can't be used. Soliciting ideas or guidance here since my searches haven't turned up anything.
scalajs-react [1.0.0](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react/blob/master/doc/changelog/1.0.0.md) is just around the corner. Are there any plans to upgrade this tutorial to such release?
