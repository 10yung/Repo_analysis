If you rotate the iPad, you'll get a frame deranged.
When a view is rewinded after swiping left or right, the tap gesture doesn't seem to work. Can you guys please have a look?
For example first card green color, second card white color and third card yellow color . so first we swipe right .so now top view is white card after we swipe left so now top view is green card how can it possible? Also I want to get index of current card suppose current card is green then I am getting reference of second card white and not green ones that is current index of active card am not getting. How can I get index of current active card?
I have try to implemented zlswipeview into swift but data source method not called I try multiple ways but method required 
func nextView(for swipeableView: ZLSwipeableView) -> UIView
not called.

 `
let swipperView = ZLSwipeableView(frame: self.swipeView.frame)

        self.view.addSubview(swipperView)

       swipperView.delegate = self

        swipperView.dataSource = self
`

please let me know if I doing something wrong.

Thanks
