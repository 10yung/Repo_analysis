I can't seem to get this to compile. 

Code: 

```
  val q = sql("select * from users") // two columns: "name" and "comment"
  println("1 Query: "+q.sql)
  println("Returns: ")  
  q() map (_ get "name") // won't compile
```

Error message: 

value get is not a member of shapeless.::[String with shapeless.labelled.KeyTag[String("name"),String],shapeless.::[String with shapeless.labelled.KeyTag[String("comment"),String],shapeless.HNil]]

Using PostgreSQL. Driver: postgresql-42.0.0.jar. I built by project using SBT "hello" and working my way from there. Also using sbt-eclipse to create Eclipse project definitions (added system properties to eclipse.ini, added the driver's jar file to my system's PATH variable for it to be able to find the PostgreSQL driver). I'm trying to use Eclipse to run my project, but the same happens using SBT from console. I'm quite the noob, but I've tried collecting as much info as possible. 
The database is hosted locally and is called tut_sqltyped1, with a schema named public. Doesn't matter if I omit the schema property or not.

Currently using a schema to qualify the table name e.g. "SELECT \* FROM schema.table" doesn't work. The parser is actually the easy part, if I just parse and ignore the schema, I get an error message of the kind "Unknown table XXX". It seems that this is because only data about the current schema is being loaded. If this is the case, what strategies might be used to get all relevant schemas? All? Lazily load the schema on first encounter? Configure schemas to load in a config file?

Hi All, is sqltyped still actively maintained ? 
Thanks 

Is there any chance shapeless can be "embedded" under the sqltyped package so as to allow the use with libraries dependent on shapeless 1.x? (ie, spray uses shapeless 1.x and there is little chance it well get upgraded anytime soon.)
