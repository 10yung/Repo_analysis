When I run it like:

`./shinatra.sh 8080 index.html`

the page keeps loading. As soon as I terminate it with Ctrl+C, the content is served. Is this the intended behaviour?

There's no value in keeping it open other than causing some browsers and commands to hang. This will force-close the connection after the response is sent.
shinatra fits perfectly into our "basic CI" needs, which are:
1. Receive webhook upon Github push;
2. Execute a script to update and build remote git repo in our VM;
3. All that with ridiculous small memory/cpu footprint usage.

However, there is this concern about how secure is shinatra. Should we be exposing it to web as we are? How likely is it to receive some weird request enabling attacker to run malicious sh code through our shinatra instance? Is it even possible?
Ran on Arch Linux and you had to provide it

Out of date documentation. Works fine on Windows 10 with Linux subsystem installed. Example: https://twitter.com/coolstarorg/status/797200322259132417
