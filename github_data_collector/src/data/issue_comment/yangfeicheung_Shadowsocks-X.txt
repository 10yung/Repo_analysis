I choose auto mode to start shadowsX,but all my request is transfer in the socket.
eg. I open ip.cn with auto mode connected to us-ca-8, then i got my ip-address was 104.245.44.232 which in "Los Angeles, California, United States".
I've registered the shortcuts but they stopped working once I reopen the software. Any solution for that?
If you create a new Shadowsocks configuration with KCPTUN enabled, leaving the Shadowsocks `port` field with its default value `0`, you will not be able to save the configuration as it doesn't pass the program's validation.

I think in this case, `port` field can be safely ignored since this is already configured on KCPTUN server-side.
