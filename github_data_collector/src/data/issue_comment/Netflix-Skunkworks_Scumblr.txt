hello, 
i am new to both ruby and scumblr,
I am always getting the error, once i run a google search task.

Unable to run task google . Error: execution expired ["/home/scrum/.rbenv/versions/2.3.1/lib/ruby/2.3.0/net/http.rb:880:in initialize'", "/home/scrum/.rbenv/versions/2.3.1/lib/ruby/2.3.0/net/http.rb:880:in open'", "/home/scrum/.rbenv/versions/2.3.1/lib/ruby/2.3.0/net/http.rb:880:in block in connect'", "/home/scrum/.rbenv/versions/2.3.1/lib/ruby/2.3.0/timeout.rb:101:in timeout'"



please help me out!

First of all, sorry for making yet another one of these. I've noticed a few closed issues already along these lines, but the suggestions in those haven't worked in my case. I'm not quite sure what I'm missing.

I have both installed on the same box, and both are listening on their default ports of 3000 and 8000. Both Scumblr and Sketchy work individually; I can task searches and generate results with Scumblr and generate screenshots with Sketchy. I have it configured correctly _enough_ that Sketchy gets the request from Scumblr, as I can follow the Sketchy ID to get the capture information:

`{
    "callback": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/results/63/update_screenshot", 
    "capture_status": "LOCAL_CAPTURES_CREATED", 
    "created_at": "2018-10-05 15:20:37.728428", 
    "html_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/files/pastebin.com_33.html", 
    "id": 33, 
    "job_status": "COMPLETED", 
    "modified_at": "2018-10-05 15:20:59.791822", 
    "retry": 0, 
    "scrape_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/files/pastebin.com_33.txt", 
    "sketch_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/files/pastebin.com_33.png", 
    "status_only": false, 
    "url": "https://pastebin.com/*ACTUAL_URL_HERE*", 
    "url_response_code": 200
}` 

If I follow that callback link, I get a page that displays "OK". However, there are no attachments on the page for the Scumblr result. Here are the relevant parts from my config files (if I'm missing any, let me know):

Sketchy's config-default.py:
`BASE_URL = 'http://%s' % os.getenv('host', '127.0.0.1:8000')`

Scumblr's config/environments/development.rb:
`Rails.application.routes.default_url_options[:host] = "http://127.0.0.1:3000"`

Scumblr's config/environments/production.rb:
`Rails.application.routes.default_url_options[:host] = "*Box's public IP*:3000"
Rails.application.routes.default_url_options[:protocol] = "https"`

Scumblr's config/initializers/scumblr.rb:
`config.sketchy_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1.0/capture"
config.sketchy_use_ssl = false`

I know I'm missing or misconfiguring something, but I can't figure out what. Thanks in advance!
Hi,

appreciate your help
Hi, I've been needing to run a specific task through the tor network so I immediately remembered torify. So I was wondering where is the task's triggers and where I should place the torify command to do so. Of course, if there's a smarter solution (and I'm sure there is), let me know.

Following the guide and setting up my First Sync Task, I get the following error after executing. Any thoughts?

Id | 21
Eventable | Task 2
Action | Error
User | ¬†
Source | Task: Github Repo Sync
Details | Could not parse System Metadata for users/organizations, skipping


This is more an advice. You should add some screenshot to let people know there is a UI. People loooooove nice thing üòç 
I need to use repositories discovered by Github Legacy Search as input for Github Code Analyzer. I am unable to find any documentation within the Wiki about how I could do this.
