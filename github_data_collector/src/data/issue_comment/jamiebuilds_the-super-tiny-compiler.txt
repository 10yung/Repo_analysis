This assign might be unnecessary.
There is actually another infinite loop in the code. When testing, I found that this would hang.:
`console.log(lexer("add"));`
This is caused by the while loop for names assuming that there is always a character following text. This patch fixes this by adding a space to the end of the lexer input, which is used to cause these while loops to exit.

Just fixing an unclosed array :+1:
Hey, Jamie, thank you for this awesome project. I created a Chinese translation for this project. 

The project URL: [the-super-tiny-compiler-CN](https://github.com/YongzeYao/the-super-tiny-compiler-CN)

Added Chinese translation.


Example:

function add(a,b) { 
     return a + b
}

There are many kinds of tokens. such as line break, When judging that there is no token, the code position should be added automatically


Hi @thejameskyle,

Really cool project. :) I noticed a handful of tiny typos while reading through and figured they're worth fixing. Let me know if any of these changes don't make sense!
Fixes infinite loop in case when number or letter appears outside of parentheses.

`/some-regex/.test(undefined)` always returns true

For example:
- `(add 1 2)5`
- `(add 2 3)abs`
