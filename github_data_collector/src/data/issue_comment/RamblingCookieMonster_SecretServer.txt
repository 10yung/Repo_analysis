Add Support to grab a Secret which requires comments

"Get-Secret : Secret server returned error The requested Secret requires a comment when viewed."
Add support to parse a comment to the Secrets, which require them and retrieve the comment.
Is it possible to search by Folder ID using the `-SearchBy` parameter in the `Get-Secret` cmdlet?

I need to retrieve all secrets within a given folder.


Is it possible to access the siteid for a secret?  I want to update this on set-secret.
Get/Set config are creating a SecretServer_$($env:USERNAME).xml and the psm1 is looking for SecretServer.xml. If you want to implement a config per user I would store it in ~ \SecretServer

see https://thycotic.force.com/support/s/article/PowerShell-Add-Update-Secret-Example for example.

import-module secretserver
...\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\secretserver\SecretServer.psm1 : Failed to import function

Running PS V5. 

When trying to set this up I was given errors that the P drive didn't exist.

In SecretServer.psm1 on line 1462 the following command is trying to look for a mapped drive.

Import-Clixml -Path "P:\Scripts\SecretServer\SecretServer\SecretServer_$($env:USERNAME).xml"
