Hi I am making a web browser and I want to implement multi tab feature, so I downloaded HGPageScrollview and tried to run it in Xcode 6 but it got the following error.
![screen shot 2015-05-08 at 2 58 45 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7972666/7533868/a29c5c50-f592-11e4-8bf7-84f56cfeeeaa.png)
Can you please tell me the solution for that. 

if yes please tell us some steps... thank you

Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the sample project
2. Using the '-' button, delete all the pages
3. Add one single new page using the '+' button
4. Attempt to delete that page with the '-' button

There's a crash in pageScrollView:viewForPageAtIndex:, "Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSRangeException', reason: '**\* -[__NSArrayM objectAtIndex:]: index 4294967295 beyond bounds for empty array'"

I'm trying the base implementation, but just can't seem to find a way to get this to work.

In my h file.
``
# import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
# import "HGPageScrollView.h"

@interface MyScrollViewController : UIViewController <HGPageScrollViewDataSource, HGPageScrollViewDelegate>``

and m:

`#import "MyScrollViewController.h"`

`@interface MyScrollViewController ()`

`@end`

`@implementation MyScrollViewController`

`- (void)viewDidLoad`
`{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
    HGPageScrollView *pageScrollView = [[[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"HGPageScrollView" owner:self options:nil] objectAtIndex:0];
    [self.view addSubview:pageScrollView];
}
``

In your markdown you note 

> least the required method in this protocol: pageScrollView:viewForPageAtIndex: But I dont really see anywhere that details this.

I tried mimicing what  was in the sample file but I keep returning:

> 2012-09-10 14:25:48.913 MyScroll[21002:c07] **\* Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '**\* -[__NSArrayM insertObject:atIndex:]: object cannot be nil'
> **\* First throw call stack:</blockquote>

Can I disable scrolling on two screens? I need to scroll no more than one.
