Something like this should work:

``` sh
docker run --rm -it -v "$GOPATH":/go -w /go/src/github.com/YOURUSER/YOURREPO -e "GOPATH=/go" iron/go:dev go build
```

User must replace YOURUSER and YOURREPO, but easier than explaining vendoring. 

Added no bin option to prevent weird error.

The docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/worker -w /worker iron/images:... command will not work in Windows because $(pwd) is a Unix command.

To correct this issue, the actual path needs to be entered in.

> Yes, the main differences : Understand that you need a standalone version of your gems / you need a require_relative of the bundle setup and a require for the different modules you uses / and also payload

These are ruby specific. Would be great to document the changes required for other runtimes to switch over to get people using this. 

Make example/docs for:
- [ ] Node
- [ ] PHP
- [ ] Java
