I was having some problems with WSL so I restarted WSL, but afterwards, Extraterm no longer works with WSL (regardless of the WSL configuration in Extraterm -- I've tried using the default shell or specifying one, and setting or not setting the start directory, but it never starts up). WSL does work in its default terminal, and both cmd and PowerShell (5 and 6) work in Extraterm. 

I see the following lines in the log:
~~~
2020-01-18 16:56:03.593 DEBUG [[Main]proxy-session-backend #0] serverPath: /home/zarainia/ptyserver2.py 
2020-01-18 16:56:03.603 DEBUG [main #0] handlePtyCreate ptyId: 1, sender.id: 1

~~~

ptyserver2.py doesn't exist in my home directory in WSL, so it obviously can't find it, but I'm not sure why it's supposed to be there? 

Also, if I try to open a new WSL tab in Extraterm, it shows a Javascript error popup saying ERR_STREAM_DESTROYED:

Ctrl+6 (or actually _any_ Ctrl+number key) are not passed through to vim, or a normal terminal.
A very long command (`BACKEND=postgres pytest --tb=short tests/api/common/experimental/test_trigger_dag.py::TestTriggerDag tests/jobs/test_backfill_job.py::TestBackfillJob::test_trigger_controller_dag tests/jobs/test_scheduler_job.py::TestSchedulerJob::test_scheduler_verify_pool_full -x` in this case) means the label/number and controls for a frame aren't visible. 

Version 0.48.0

It'd be nice to have a default layout on startup. I tend to open the same few windows in a fairly long period of time as I'm developing the same things for potentially a couple of months.

It'd be nice to have a way to, when opening the app, have it open to the things I'm currently working on via a config/settings option.
If frames are active, when trying to activate a pipenv subshell the system pauses for around 30 seconds, then prompts a success-frame but never activates the (pipenv) subshell.

If frames are turned off everything works fine

Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems that every none zero exit status gets framed, 
don't get me wrong I like the functionality but it would be nice to have more control over them.

in vscode integrated terminal getting annoying num above prompt and non zero exit bugy, only when I source integration scripts in ~/.config/fish/config.fish :

Font rendering in Windows is really smudgy. It looks bolded even though bold is not selected. I tried many different fonts and they all looks bolded, blurry, and smudgy. Also, don’t size doesn’t look right. Very small for 14px size. Can this be fixed? I really the app but the font is a downer. 
Hi,
I love this terminal! It's by far the most feature rich, superb and the drag and drop of the tab to pane is a must have!

I often use command longer than a screen width. Everytime I use the backspace key the display is messed up. Sometimes the cursor goes the line above the command I'm on, sometimes it display text that is not what it executes when I press enter. I could even edit the prompt header.

I'm on Fedora 31, extraterm 0.48.0, zsh 5.7.1, oh-my-zsh 534ec60.
I tested with bash, it is the same.

When extraterm-commands 0.48.0 is disabled, I can edit long command line without any issue.
It was partially mentioned in https://github.com/sedwards2009/extraterm/issues/157
Please make it possible to configure the tab name in session types.
From my practice, i use separate session tabs configured for managing exchange / powercli / just powershell, and they all look alike after opening, sure i can rename, but that works only till application restart.

Hi everyone,

Once I install Extraterm, every shell opens in a new window like this https://i.imgur.com/LYm3ogd.png
It doesn't matter if it's windows cmd, powershell, git bash, cmder - I cannot figure out how to set it up to open within the Extraterm window. There is a cursor in the Extraterm window but it does not accept any commands. Right now all Extraterm seems to do is launch another window and nothing more.

Is it supposed to work natively out of the box? Is there something basic I am missing here? I've read all the documentation and searched github issues but can't see any mention of my issue.

I'm not sure if it's relevant or not but here are the developer errors:
