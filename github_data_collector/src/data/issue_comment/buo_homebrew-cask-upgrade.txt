I got this warning while upgrading using `brew cu -a`:

```Warning: It seems there is already an App at '/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app'; overwriting.```

I assume that `homebrew-cask-upgrade` issues `brew cask install --force` instead of `brew cask reinstall`. Would it hurt to use `reinstall` instead? I'd strongly assume this would get rid of the warning.
Looking over your code, you install all updated Casks to /Applications, even if they were installed using the --appdir=path parameter and resided somewhere else. Could you update the command to rectify this? If that isn’t possible for some reason, I’d settle for the ability to specify or exclude Casks with the command, perhaps via config file.
