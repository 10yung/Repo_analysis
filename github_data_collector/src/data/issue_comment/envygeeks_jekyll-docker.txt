## Description

Attempting to run with jekyll/jekyll:pages produces the error "jekyll 3.8.5 | Error:  superclass must be a Class (Faraday::DeprecatedConstant given)".    I think it just started in the last day or so.

## Steps

- Create a Dockerfile containing: 
    FROM jekyll/jekyll:pages
    CMD jekyll serve --port 4002 --watch --incremental
- Run the container

## Output
    Configuration file: none
    jekyll 3.8.5 | Error:  superclass must be a Class (Faraday::DeprecatedConstant given)


## Expected
Jekyll to launch.
Note that this error does not happen with jekyll/jekyll:builder.

- [x] This feature is not on the latest version

## Request

I think a great addition would be to add support for more architectures than x86_64.
According to [here](https://blog.docker.com/2017/11/multi-arch-all-the-things/), it would only need to add a manifest list with all the supported architectures and since alpine/ruby already support a few maybe the exact number could be included here?

## Examples

armhf, ppc, sparc, etc.

Hi, I'm making updates for Open Collective. Either you or a supporter signed this repo up for Open Collective. This pull request adds backers and sponsors from your Open Collective https://opencollective.com/jekyll-docker ❤️
  
  It adds two badges at the top to show the latest number of backers and sponsors. It also adds placeholders so that the avatar/logo of new backers/sponsors can automatically be shown without having to update your README.md. [[more info](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/wiki/Github-banner)]. See how it looks on [this repo](https://github.com/apex/apex#backers).
You can also add a "Donate" button to your website and automatically show your backers and sponsors there with our widgets. Have a look here: https://opencollective.com/widgets

  P.S: As with any pull request, feel free to comment or suggest changes. The only thing "required" are the placeholders on the README because we believe it's important to acknowledge the people in your community that are contributing (financially or with code!).

  Thank you for your great contribution to the open source community. You are awesome! 🙌
  And welcome to the open collective community! 😊
