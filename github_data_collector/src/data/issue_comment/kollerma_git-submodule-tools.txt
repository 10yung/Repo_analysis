`$ git rm-submodule foo/bar`

If `foo/bar` is an empty directory, this will delete the superproject's `.git` folder.
Having this feature is useful when you want to use submodules as content addressed dependencies. Currently `git submodule add --depth 1 <hash>` or `git submodule add --depth <tag>` doesn't work.

There's a bug in rpull where SOMETIMES it will decide to delete all of the submodule directories and then re-pull them.

No work is lost; the submodules were all up to date each time I've seen this happen. But a LOT of time is lost! It takes on the order of 45 minutes to pull all of the submodule repositories over the VPN.

This is a pretty serious showstopper bug for me. What would I need by way of logs to try to track this down? My assumption is that the "delete submodules that have been removed" is screwing up. My first thought is that the "rewind" was rewinding too far, but it really shouldn't be rewinding so far that the submodules aren't defined -- looking at the history, it should have only rewound a few commits.

A related bug that's frustrating is that git-submodule-tools forgets the branches that the submodules are set to. We have each submodule set to track particular branches explicitly (using .gitmodules), and so the heuristic that tries to "guess" the tracked branch is often wrong. But at least that's easily fixed. Could the fact we're specifying branches in .gitmodules be breaking something?

Here's an example of the output of a session that killed the subfolders:
