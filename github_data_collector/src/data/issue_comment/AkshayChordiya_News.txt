Gson is not really Kotlin friendly because it doesn't understand about Kotlin null safe types. 

Moshi is made by Square and have kotlin support by codegen or reflect which requires kapt.

JetBrains made own json serialization library. https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization it have own compiler plugins for it. 
Since the repository is heavy on Kotlin and coroutines, we can continue the trend by replacing Glide dependency with [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) which is Kotlin and coroutines first and is much light weight than Glide and doesn't use annotation processing ðŸŽ‰

1) implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-test:$coroutinesVersion" needs to be testImplementation. As for right now, it is very unneeded libraries because it wouldn't break anything.

2) implementation "androidx.arch.core:core-testing:$lifecycleVersion" needs to be testImplementation too.
