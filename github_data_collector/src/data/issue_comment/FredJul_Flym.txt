Flym 2.3.1 crashes on start (Android 9)
Cleaning cache and reinstalling Flym didn't help, still crashing...

It'd be great to be able to configure links to be opened in an incognito mode; either all or using a site matchlist.

This would be useful for sites that pop up ads after the first few articles, or that you just don't want to be accepting/sending cookies to/from.

Would anyone else find this useful, and if I implemented this is it something that would be accepted into mainline?
Please add a setting allow users to set a specific amount of space they want to be filled up with their rss feeds for offline viewing with full text retrieval. So users can set whether they want 500mb,1gb, 10gb etc.
I have enabled the option for full text retrieval on all of my feeds yet only a few articles from each feeds are downloaded with full text retrieval. I assume this is because you do not want to occupy that much space on a users device.
I think it would be awesome if Flym would let me add some stories to custom favorites or at least allow me to tag them. As there are a few stories that i would like to revisit later politics, sports etc and having them mixed up together like it is currently makes it quite difficult to find the stories I favorited.
[Feature Request]Add TTS function, and podcast function
Hi All,
is it possible to implement vibration alert, warning sound and alarm sound (continuous sound) for the arrival of new articles for certain sources?
Thanks
In addition to the share option it would be helpful to have a fast way to copy the link of the current article to the clipboard. A suffestion would be by doing a long tap on the headline of the current article when in article view.
Thanks! This is a great app.
Some video platform like Youtube or [Peertube](https://joinpeertube.org) use the [Media-RSS](http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss) extension to provide metadata about the videos. They generally do not use the whole tags available, but provide tags for the video description, the thumbnail, and the number of views.

It would be amazing if Flym could at least display the thumbnail and the description for videos.

The moment you started observing reality, you hopelessly polluted any conclusions you might make about it. The anthropic principle guarantees that you are NOT seeing the universe in most typical state. But used correctly, this highly controversial idea can be extremely powerful. So, how do you correctly use the anthropic principle?

What do you think?
Refresh interval can be variable to save batteries and/or bandwidth. It starts at lower limit (e.g. 10 min, 1 hour). If new entries were **not**  available the interval gets doubled until it reaches upper limit (e.g. 24 hours, 48 hours). If a new entry appears the interval is set to lower limit again.

Both lower and upper limit are customizable.
