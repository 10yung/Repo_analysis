Hi , 

I installed abot but during the installation it could not migrate DB, I migrated manually , but when I start abot server and go to localhost:4200 address it keep giving me "Exit Status 1" error.
My PostgreSql version is 9.5.4

Thanks for your help

I have been using boltdb to allow golang projects run on desktop and mobile.

It's a kV store and so different then postresql.
But it run great on servers, desktop and all mobiles.
It's 100% golang.

It ultimately would allow abot to run on mobile.

Not sure how the maintainer ( s) feel about this.

But it allows having master / master data replication by using raft, which is very useful because users can run and edit whilst offline. New records will get merged when back online.

Also I use storm as a nice wrapper on top of boltdb. It very easy.

Performance wise it's also very fast in reads.

Anyway, enough said about it. It really comes down to if portability to mobile is wanted

Have a look at bleve.

It's a great golang library with stemmer that handle all languages.

It uses boltdb underneath but that's not needed to help improve the stemmer functionality.

I've tried several times in so many ways to install Abot - but the dbsetup.sh keeps me from testing anything. I have postgres 9.5.3 running passwordless - but on port 5433.

the dbsetup.sh script keep failing to parse what I give it:

```
testProject$ cmd/dbsetup.sh postgres:@localhost:5433
    [ok] checking for psql binary
    [ok] checking postgres connection
    [--] checking for database
          database missing. creating it
   [err] creating  database
         could not create  database

   [cmd] psql -w -h 'localhost' -p '5433' -U 'postgres' -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -c 'create database '

ERROR:  syntax error at end of input
LINE 1: create database 
                        ^
```

Many errors like this - I ended up doing a search and replace in the setup script changing 5432 to 5433 everywhere - which got it installed - but running:

```
testProject$ abot server
2016/08/20 23:17:05 could not start server. could not connect to database: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:5432: getsockopt: connection refused
exit status 1
```

I can see it's still trying to use port 5432? I've tried changing PORT it in abot.env with no luck

Hi,

While running the server using 'abot server', I am facing an issue with the following error message

failed to retrieve version number. json: cannot unmarshal number into Go value of type core.PluginJSON

It seems to throw the error while communicating with the url 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egtann/abot/master/plugins.json

Can anybody please help in resolving this?

Kind Regards,
Satya

There’s going to be a new, much simpler plugin API. You can see an example [here](https://gist.github.com/egtann/8dc174ab9fdc776e4fabc0356d15d772). Notably, Command+Object triggers will now be assembled automatically from example sentences. Read the comments in the linked example—it’s really powerful. The current API will be deprecated but not removed until v1.0.

This should lay the groundwork for a visual plugin builder with a drag-and-drop interface.

Humans are rarely precise typists, so Abot v0.3 will add support for spelling auto-correction and expand slang (e.g. "ur," "lol") and emoji into the terms they represent (e.g. happy, sad, or snowman).

Strings used within Abot that are displayed to users, e.g. "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that." should be pulled out of the code and moved to a strings.go file located somewhere in `/base`, for easy modification.
