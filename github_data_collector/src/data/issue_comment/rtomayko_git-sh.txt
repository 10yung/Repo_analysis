I'm curious if there's any fork that's actively maintained.
`git worktree` introduced in git 2.5: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree


From https://github.com/thoughtbot/gitsh I loved the feature of using `enter` to get the current `git status`. It feels very natural and a handy shortcut.

(I do like how most commands, i.e. also arrow keys, are given to the normal systems prompt, that should not change in its base.)

As long as the user is only viewing one commit, it's best to show the full commit info.
