firstly,i download  OpenSubtitles corpus directly from here: http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/download.php?f=OpenSubtitles/en.tar.gz
secondly  i unpack the archive in\DeepQA-master\data\opensubs,
lastly, i run main.py --corpus opensubs, but it show that "Loaded opensubs: 4 words, 0 QA"
what is wrong with me? 

Does it already add a sample when decoding?

I want to change BasicLSTMCell to BasicRNNCell 
but it tell me
NotFoundError (see above for traceback): Restoring from checkpoint failed. This is most likely due to a Variable name or other graph key that is missing from the checkpoint. Please ensure that you have not altered the graph expected based on the checkpoint. Original error:

Key embedding_rnn_seq2seq/embedding_rnn_decoder/rnn_decoder/output_projection_wrapper/multi_rnn_cell/cell_0/basic_rnn_cell/bias not found in checkpoint

Dear All,

I had tried to run the DeepQA web server under https protocol, but unsuccessfully. Two ways had been tested including:
1. Apache2 https to http proxy —> no response
2. runsslserver with ssl cert and key files —> /chat not found, GET /chat HTTP1.1 404

Any suggestion?

Thanks a lot and have a nice day!

Best regards,
Yuanfu
hello, I want to know if the function **loadEmbedding(self, sess)** is for using my own word2vec file for my data set?  I didn't see the code call this function in use, so i wonder if you can explain some main idea on it?
While running python main.py, I am getting below error.  What could be wrong?

Failed to load the native TensorFlow runtime.

for some common reasons and solutions.  Include the entire stack trace
above this error message when asking for help.
I git clone DeepQA in my server(ubuntu) and trained with GPU.
then I test it in the server,I send a “hi” and get a “hi” as response.

however, when I download the whole code(with model) from my server to local pc(mac osx),
then I do the same test : I send a “hi” and get a “I i i i i i” as response. And no matter what I send I always got this wrong response.

I have set the server tested in CPU, my local pc also run in CPU. Both are py3.6 ,both are tensorflow 1.4.

So ,could anyone tell me some possible reason? thx very very very much!
