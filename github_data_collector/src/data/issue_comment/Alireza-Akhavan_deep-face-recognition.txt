Hi Alireza,
It seems that data in iran-seleb.ir is not accessible. Is there any problem with that site?
Hi alireza and Thank you for your useful code.
I have a small dataset and i want to retrain and update your pretrained model (20180204-160909) on own dataset. Please guide me about this
Hi Alireza and thanks for sharing your slides.
I run the codes successfully and now I want to transfer it to C++ one. As I know (And also implemented before) we can use .pbtxt and .pb files to do so by using OpenCV. But the model which david sandberg used in his work has different formats. Do you have any idea helping me transferring the code to C++ one?
Thanks again
