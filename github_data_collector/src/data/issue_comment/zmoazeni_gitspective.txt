Currently only the body of issues and pull requests is shown. For issues, both the title and the body is shown.

For simple PRs where the information is contained in the title (and in general, for proper context, and for consistency), it would be helpful to also display the title.

While we're at it, perhaps the titles should be formatted differently from the body -- say, as bold, or something similar.
This is related to #3. Would it be possible to have separate controls to show/hide issues vs. pull requests?
Letting the user to set a GitHub token will allow them the use the tool more frequently , and it can do more expensive analysis.

See https://github.com/coala/gh-board and https://github.com/coala/git-task-list for two tools which allow user to set GitHub token
It would be nice to include the time as well as the date in the cards. I tried looking in [site.coffee](https://github.com/zmoazeni/gitspective/blob/master/coffee/site.coffee) but couldn't figure out how to change it. If you gave me some pointers, I'd gladly submit a PR :)

Right now only repo watching events are included. It would be nice to have the starring events as well.

I really like the timeline design but I think a project level showcase of multiple people would be nice to have in the future. 

I know IE is such a petty nuisance, but just to report an issue that it will alert "Username is required" on IE. I don't know what may have 'caused it since it doesn't seem like there should be an IE bug on getting input out of textfield with the libraries you are using. 

All the comments (and issue text, and probably others) look ugly because they're not being formatted the way they were intended.
