Battery info applet shows invalid information

Expected Behavior
I would expect that Energy Full is less than Energy Full Design. And, that Energy Now is less than Energy Full, and Energy Now / Energy Full = % charged.

Current Behavior
The battery info applet one of two sets of information:
1.
State: Charging
Energy Full Design: 42.00 Wh
Energy Full: 121.27 Wh (94%)
Energy Now: 121.27 Wh (8%)
Energy rate: 0.03 W
2.
State: Fully Charged
Energy Full Design: 42.00 Wh
Energy Full: 121.27 Wh (94%)
Energy Now: 39.71 Wh (100%)
Energy rate: 0.01 W

Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
I leave the laptop charging almost all of the time, and often leave it in sleep mode instead of off. The battery info applet one of two sets of information (that I've noticed). I haven't investigated what happens when I let the battery discharge.

Context
It is hard to have confidence in the numbers reported since the Energy Full value is about 3 times larger than the Energy Full Design value. While it is possible that the battery is charged to 3 times the amount of energy it was designed for, is that really the case? Also, it isn't clear what 121.27 is 94% of, or 8% of, for that matter. Also, why is 39.71 Wh fully charged (is that considered 100% of 42.00 Wh)?

##### Expected Behavior
Screen resize should occur automatically 

##### Current Behavior
Screen resize does not occur. User must change resolutions manually.

##### Possible Solution
N/A

##### Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
1. Deploy KVM VM using QXL / Spice
2. Connect to VM using a Spice Client like remote-viewer
3. Resize screen


##### Context
A few CPU cycles back, Spice/QXL decided to change the way they resize screens and seem to have forgotten to coordinate this with desktop manager developers. 

As consequence a number of developers have been playing catch with the change

Hello,

I really would like libsysstat will be able to print different values in numbers not only diagrams. Do you plan to do it?
Setting the brightness from the command line is not working. GUI is working fine.
```
[lpereira@l-pc]$ cat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness 
9
[lpereira@l-pc]$ cat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness 
9
[lpereira@l-pc]$ lxqt-config-brightness -s 10
[lpereira@l-pc]$ cat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness 
9
```

##### Expected Behavior
The brightness changes to the set level.

##### Current Behavior
The brightness isn't set.+

##### Possible Solution
Probably the app quits before the brightness is actually set.

##### Expected Behavior
`.desktop` files in `/usr/share/applications/` show in the LXQt menu however adding `NotShowIn=LXQt;` should hide the desktop item from the menu according to the freedesktop specification, yet still allow it to be seen in other desktop environments.

##### Current Behavior
After adding `NotShowIn=LXQt;` the item is still displayed in the menu even after a logout/login, session restart, or reboot.

##### Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)

1. Create a desktop file in `/usr/share/applications/`or modify an existing one such as this:
```
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Name=AlsaMixer
Type=Application
Comment=Show ALSA Audio Mixer
Terminal=true
Exec=alsamixer
Icon=multimedia-volume-control
Categories=AudioVideo;Audio;Mixer;
Keywords=Settings;Audio;
NotShowIn=LXQt;
```
2. restart computer
3. find `AlsaMixer` in sound and video menu


##### Context
Some menu items may not wish to be visible in all available desktop environments available to the system.

I have a Lenovo laptop that's usually plugged into a docking station with 2 external monitors (3 total, including laptop screen). The laptop is almost never unplugged from the dock, but one of the monitors is often switched to my other machine via KVM. The expected behavior is for the laptop to either switch to 2 monitors when 3rd monitor is showing input form another PC or to remember it (which is usually does, but not always).

Occasionally LXQT forgets about the 3rd monitor and disables it, requiring me to manually reenable it in lxqt-config-monitor. When this occurs, it also seems to forget the monitor position, requiring me to manually drag/align it in the "Monitor Settings" UI. This UI is also wonky and not user-friendly, often requiring several attempts to get it pixel-perfect (otherwise I got partial monitor overlap, or ~20-30 pixel misalignment between monitors). Moreover, some settings have no effect at all (even though they should) until the alignment is changed.

One example of such setting is which monitor is selected as "primary". Changing primary monitor has no effect until I also drag the displays around in the UI so the system realizes that something has changed. Often (when system accidentally resets the primary monitor because of the KVM), this means that I have to drag/apply the changes twice (once to move them out of alignment so that the system realizes that something has changed, and 2nd time back to where they were to fix the misalignment I caused for the sole purpose of making primary display change take effect).

I've also noticed that despite saving the settings for alignment (as the GUI allows), applying saved settings afterwards doesn't always seem to have an effect, requiring the awkward drag-and-drop via clumsy UI again.

There are several issues at play here, changing either one would be a huge quality of life improvement, but I'd prefer a change to all:
1. Accept a text-based config file I can reuse instead of trying to drag-and-drop the alignment via UI (hopefully something I can trigger via terminal/command)
2. Fix the issue with primary display change getting ignored until screen alignment also changes (this may be an xrandr bug since I've seen similar behavior when working directly with xrandr)
3. Make the system more resilient to extended monitor disconnection/connection, so it doesn't randomly forget a monitor. Or, like Mac, remember several previous configs and automatically pick the most sane one based on connected monitors.
4. Fix whatever issue seems to make saved config not get applied.

1. Configure several monitors (3 in my example, in following horizontal configuration: [laptop: extended][desktop: primary][desktop: extended/kvm])
2. Switch right-most monitor to different machine
3. Wait until LXQT goes into sleep/standby
4. Reactivate LXQT, the appearance/disappearance of right-most extended monitor may cause it to forget about it, may also cause it to forget which monitor is primary and switch the left-most laptop screen back to primary (this can also sometimes occur during reboot, despite saving the config). Applying older config from lxqt-config-monitor may have no effect, requiring manual reconfiguration - which will forget the position of the extended monitor and require pixel-perfect drag-and-dropping via the awkward UI.

This issue affects me because I have to realign my monitors at least once a day, and it's time-consuming/frustrating, especially with the poor UI. Accepting a text-based config file would improve the issue for me, even if the bugs were unsolved (since I could map it to a bash command).

When using a smaller screen (eg. netbook) it's sometimes necessary/desirable to make the [virtual] display larger and panning across. Whilst doing this the lxqt-panel is no longer at the bottom of the new 'virtual' display.

It would be 'nice' if the panel remained at the bottom of the 'virtual' display.  When at first instigated the panel looks great, but as you use the mouse to pan a larger 'virtual' screen, the panel is 'unstuck' from the bottom and gets in the way.

This was tried first on Lubuntu (as request related to Lubuntu), then on opensuse tumbleweed.

On Lubuntu 19.10 [updated] I use `xrandr` to view my displays (1280x1024 [landscape] and 1024x1280 [portrait]) resolutions and names, then used the command
`xrandr --output HDMI-0 --panning 2304x2304`
to make my display 'pan' using the mouse. On execution there is no change, but now the mouse causes the virtual display to pan across the display, but the lxqt-panel is now unstuck and moves with the background & windows. It still operates perfectly, but it's no longer on the edge of the display.  It also hides any windows positioned to cross, or be underneath it.

On opensuse tumbleweed (snapshot 23-Jul-2019) with two 1920x1080 displays, I again used `xrandr` to check resolutions and view names, then using the command
`xrandr --output DVI-I-1 --panning 2400x1400`
I got the same result (same experience in tumbleweed as Lubuntu).  What I wanted, but any windows underneath the panel was hidden, and panel wasn't as 'nice' to use.

Whilst I'd expect this issue cannot be resolved in `lxqt-panel` for the reason mentioned by Tsujan in https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt/issues/1175#issuecomment-254019597  (forgive me if I'm wrong; "X11 dependency"), possibly this could be a feature-request for Monitor.Setting (Display Settings) that it handles a larger display (what I've described as virtual display) as a solution, or maybe not override what the OP & I tried to do using `xrand`.

Personally it doesn't impact me. It'll probably only impact a small number of users who use older netbooks, but it could also be a useful feature for CAD & other users that need a far larger virtual screen than they actually have providing greater functionality.
