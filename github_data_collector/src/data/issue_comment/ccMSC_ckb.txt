Will this have Corsair Harpoon RGB support?
Before downloading and opening the software my m65 would work fine with my Mac. After I downloaded it, the mouse's right and left click stopped working and now the middle scroll button works as a weird click. Even after quitting the software the mouse's left and right click buttons will not work at all.
I am trying to configure some bindings on my Corsair Scimitar Pro for the music software Sunvox. There, you need to hold Shift while dragging to connect modules. It would be nice if I could, for example, bind `+lshift,+mouse1` to "Key 1 down" and `-mouse1,-lshift` to "Key 1 up".

If there is such a function, please tell me how to get there.
Hi,
Could you add support for AIO's please?

Thanks, Jamie

Will this have Corsair Harpoon support?
The mouse randomly gets unresponsive during the screen log-in and connecting it into a different USB port, does not solve the problem. The only way to "fix" this issue is to do a reboot.

This issue also happened today on my brand new XPS 13 9360. The mouse became unresponsive as soon as I installed the ckb-next drivers and did a reboot. This is not an isolate case because I have the same issue on my PC Desktop I7-2600K.

Both machines are running Debian Stretch (Stable branch) 64 Bit with MATE GUI.

After running quick install I receive error:

> ckb-next-master/quickinstall: line 245: 2327 Abort trap: 6 "$APP" --close > /dev/null 2>&1
