I have javascript code along with plain content in my summernote. now, (1) when I do code view in summernote, put javascript code and come back to normal view, it loads the javascript content(basically it has form) outside the summernote. (2) Also, when I am saving it to DB, it doesn't give me that whole JS content along with other content at the controller.

my content with JS code sample which I want to save to DB.

Insert link modal **Open in new window** `checkbox` design is wrong also when try to `click` in `text` _Open in new window_ and box the `checkbox` not working. Design is look like this http://prntscr.com/qooyj2 `checkbox` `label` render without `for` `attribute` also `input` `checkbox` haven't any `ID`.

I found html below like this.

```
<div class="checkbox">
	<label>
		<input type="checkbox" checked aria-checked="true"> Open in  new window
	</label>
</div>
```

It should like this

```
<div class="checkbox">
	<label for="newWindowCheckbox">
		<input id="newWindowCheckbox" type="checkbox" checked aria-checked="true"> Open in  new window
	</label>
</div>
```

I want to set up a development environment locally from git repo for debugging. 
There doesn't seem to be instructions to do that in the docs, so can someone point towards that please?
there are scripts given but adding some steps to install and build would help newcomers to setup the environment for contribution. 




Summernote does not support any back-to-edit mode mechanism in code view when it is initiated on Airmode. How about to make pressing ESC key for returning? Or, it has to be prohibited to add code view button on Airmode, at least.

<img width="1149" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-15 at 12 33 21 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/579366/72402719-57253d80-3793-11ea-92a0-31d82eb23224.png">

I have run across some strange behavior in the codeview.activate call.
I have implemented summernote, using airmode, however, also have the possible need for codeview.

Since, in this version 0.8.12, the two are not compatible, I created a work around.
I use a button to trigger a javascript call, in where I grab the current summernote code, than destroy the current summernote instance, than copy the code back into the textarea, and reinit summernote, thus recreating the summernote editor, this time with airmode set to false.

This works flawlessly.
However, when i reinit, passing the codeview.activate call in the init callback, I get unexpected behavior. 

The first time I do this, it actually works perfectly. However the issue comes into play when I toggle from airmode, to toolbarmode, back to airmode, than back to toolbar mode.

After doing this, the code is lost, and replaced with the default `<p><br><p>.`

This issue only occurs when using codeview.activate in the init callback, and only happens when I toggle back and forth two times.

Im sure this is a bit confusing to explain, so I have reproduced the issue in the jsfiddle provided below. 

https://jsfiddle.net/v2w54mcj/

Simply visit the jsfiddle, and click the button above the editor that says, switch to advanced mode.
Than click the same button that now reads switch to design mode. Than once again click the button stating switch to advanced mode, and you will see that the previous html is replaced.

I did manage to work around this issue by replacing the codeview.activate call with a jquery trigger click on the code view button instead, and this prevents the issue from happening.
$('.note-icon-code').trigger('click');

Since I have a work around, Im not waiting for a fix, just wanted to bring the issue to your attention.

#### Description of your Issue or Request:
1. The first line in Summernote will automatically be unselected after select all and changing the font size
2. If I type the first line then copied it, paste the copied line several times, then changing the font size back and forth, all the lines will be selected but the size of the first and the rest is different.
#### steps to reproduce (Add more if necessary):
// Steps for the first issue
1. Go to Summernote example: https://summernote.org/deep-dive/
2. Typing some lines (It is important that these lines mustn't copy and paste from other sources) then select all and change the font size:

If I change the font size, only the last two lines are changing.

// Steps for the second issue
4. Remove all the lines.
5. Typing the first line, then copy and paste it several times.
6. Select all then changing the font size back and forth until the issue happens e.g. change the size to 9 then 24:
