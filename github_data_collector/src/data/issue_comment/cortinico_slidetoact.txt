Thanks for the library! But how to make slideToActView run immediately in a completed state?
I was thinking that could be useful to let users choose icon style. 

We only need one parameter to override the line 87 on SlideToActView:
```
/** Outer color used by the slider (primary) */
    var outerColor: Int = 0
        set(value) {
            field = value
            mOuterPaint.color = value
            mDrawableArrow.setTint(value)  ->> This line should to be removed or at least have some other public function to modify it
            invalidate()
        }
```

I'll also use this issue to ask for a way to use icon's which are images, not drawable vectors, just drawables. Could be this possible? Thanks! :D
I want set drawable background instead of color to button  ( app:inner_color="@color/colorPrimary")
## What kind of issue is this?

UI bug on Android 7.1.1 Samsung Tablet (of course it's a Samsung)

## Details

I cannot replicate this issue on emulators or actual devices. It seems to be an issue with `trimPathStart`/`trimPathEnd`. Notice how the check mark appears briefly after resetting the view.
