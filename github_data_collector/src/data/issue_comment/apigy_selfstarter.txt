Has anyone managed to get this to actually run?

What OS, DB?
What version of Ruby/Rails?
Do all the tests run?
If this doesn't "run", is there a fork that does??


cannot load such file -- sass
(in /home/.../app/assets/stylesheets/main.css.scss)

Hi,

I am planning for a contribution for this repo and configured the application in my local But when I run the test suite all the test cases are failing because of deprecation of mass assignment for rails 4

- Update Ruby to 2.3.0
- Update Rails to 4.2.6
- update Json gem to 1.8
- update jquery-ui-rails to 5.0
- update shoulda-matchers to 3.0
- Update rails_config
- Install Annotate gem

use one of the two: 
- http://circleci.com/
-  https://codeship.com/ 

that is free for the projects  open source 

how to do  integration?

It has all the previous changes so this should be merged into the master.

Just making a pull request. You should review it and merge if you tried it on your end and it was working.

My apologies ahead of time - I'm new to Ruby/Rails - but figured I could just follow the directions and get this running on Heroku.... Almost... 

Seems like the video placeholder file works on my localhost - but NOT when running in Heroku - I know it's something to do with assets - but not sure what. Any guidance would be appreciated.

Here are the working and non working sites with image inspected...

Simple line instructing user to cd into the selfstarter project.
