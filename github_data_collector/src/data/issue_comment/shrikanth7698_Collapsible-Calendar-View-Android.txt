I am not able to change the size of the event, I don't know if there is a way to do this or not
Can't able to set event dot size. Android resource linking failed.
i want to select previous days so, how can i do for that?
too much skipped frames , how to fix it
Is there a way to change the event dot to a drawable?

Adding Events with .addEventTag(yyyy,mm,dd);



## Remove events from the adapter.  
### Expected behavior and actual behavior: Actually isn't possible to remove events or clear adapter.



## Calendar view not refreshed after calling Calendar.select(Day) method.
### Expected behavior and actual behavior:
1. By default, the calendar is showing the current month and selected the current date. (Ex: Nov 10)
2. I will navigate the calendar from the current month to next month (But now the selected date is Nov 10 and showing the calendar for December)
3. Now, If I set the Date like Calendar.select(Day) for the previous month (10th Nov 2018) or next month (10th Jan 2019) it set the date correctly but the calendar view not refreshed.

Kindly let me know is there any issue or any workaround for this issue.
Thanks in advance.
