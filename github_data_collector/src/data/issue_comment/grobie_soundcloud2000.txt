Tried to install as the readme instructed, but when executing got such error:
```

I was able to install soundcloud2000 on Korora 24 (Fedora) but when I try to run it I get the following error

In the `~/.soundcloud2000` folder there are serval mp3 files that are actually the songs from soundcloud. They should not be kept there as many songs on soundcloud are under copyrights. A possibility could be that they will be deleted right after listening. This will slow down the player but soundcloud2000 would be more on the legal side.

I apologize if this I overlooked the solution or missed the obvious answer.

It would be nice to be able to just pass a soundcloud url as a command line parameter and have the app play that particular track. It would be even nicer if it got the suggested tracks playlist and kept on playing the next suggested tracks after that.

As soundcloud2000 dosen't support repeat on/off feature, I think it's more intuitive to make the first song of the playlist to be played when the last one is over. For now, when the last one's over, the player just repeats that particular song.

I guess we can achieve this by adding simple conditional statement (whether current one is the last song of the playlist or not) to the next_track function of player_controller.rb, but I'm not sure how to exactly achieve that. Can anyone give me little guideline or make a patch for it?

Ruby gem has not been updated since 2013, need to get it up to date.

Mocks were never mocked out, need to mock them out.
