Running on OSX 10.13.6.

I have in my profile:
`export CLOUDSDK_PYTHON=python3`

when I run the command
`datalab --verbosity=debug create new-instance`

I get
```

Hi,

My datalab instance is very slow to respond. It is an instance that I am working with for few weeks.
Execution of one cell takes long. Last week there were Google Cloud issues - so I was assuming that it will be resolved. No GCP issues now and it is still very slow.
the machine is 32  vCPUs
Any advice on how to make it work?

Thanks,
Eila

Hi,
First, this is a great tool, saves me a lot of time working with bigquery.

Now to my question/issue/feature suggestion (you tell me which one it is).
I want to connect to datalab using my vscode editor (which now has excellent support for notebooks).
The vscode way to do this hash 2 steps:
- Run the notebook on the remote datalab kernel - this works fine, I can execute the code on the remote kernel (which makes sense since datalab is based on jupyter)
- Connect to the remote file system via ssh to be able to save the notebook on the remote workspace - this doesn't work since the host OS of datalab is missing some of the requirements.

What's the best way to go around this?
Hello,

When using datalab connect command, i get the following message: 
```
Error: Unauthorized
which does not have access to Cloud Shell 3026254.

```
When connecting with ssh, i get the following message: 
```
Connection Failed
You cannot connect to the VM instance because of an unexpected error. Wait a few moments and then try again. (#79)
```
I tried creating a new machine and received the same message. 
Any advice?

Many thanks,
Eila

The `datalab beta create-gpu` command is broken. The reason for this is that:

1. Since `/root` is read only, configuring docker for use with gcr as root will fail.
2. The `cos-gpu-installer` container (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cos-gpu-installer) requires a more recent version of the NVidia drivers.

Everything works fine after changing the following:
- Updating the nvidia drivers to be compatible with the cos-gpu-installer docker image. Using version 418.67 which is the same as [her](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cos-gpu-installer/blob/4b6856e474bd873ceef9c715ee831f578896f1a4/scripts/gpu-installer-env#L4).
- Changing the home directory for the `cos-gpu-installer.service` to one that is writeable.
- No longer running `docker-credential-gcr configure-docker` before the `wait-for-startup-script.service`.
I have created some custom datalab docker image to install python libraries we use often. The Dockerfile is shown below. The libraries however do not seem to be available on Jupyter after creating datalab instances using this image, since Jupyter uses different python binaries from some specific environments:

```bash
!which python
/usr/local/envs/py2env/bin/python
!which python3
/usr/local/envs/py3env/bin/python3
```

What would be the correct way to install python libraries in a custom docker image, or how can I prescribe the python binary I want to use with datalab please?

Thanks

- Fixed issue for the GPU instance in which it does not start because it fails to pull down the docker container (https://github.com/googledatalab/datalab/issues/2133)

- Updated the NVIDA driver to 418.67

- Added ExecStop and ExecStopPost to the datalab service so systemctl can be used to stop the service.
Hello,

I am using datalab notebooks for the first time and trying to git push them into the repository.

I have created a test notebook, clicked commit button there:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13776707/60695501-7dc90880-9f14-11e9-9d5a-6f027e8c16de.png)

Then, I don't see the option to push the committed notebook to the cloud repository. It is so weird. I don't know how to resolve this. Please help. Thank you.
