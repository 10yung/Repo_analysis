Hi i see that you use Anko lib, but i recently read that it is a deprecated library:

https://github.com/Kotlin/anko/blob/master/GOODBYE.md

Have you planned to remove this lib and update your code?

any thoughts on when it will be production ready?

In MainActivity.kt, starting with Chapter 8, the http link gives me this error in MainActivity->onCreate:

> weatherapp W/System.err: java.io.IOException: Cleartext HTTP traffic to api.openweathermap.org not permitted

I propose changing the http://api.openweather... URL to https://api.openweather...

Where does the id come from?
