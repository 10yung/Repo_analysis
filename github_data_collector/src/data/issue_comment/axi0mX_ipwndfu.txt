My ipad 3 won't work because it's not supported, could you update it?
It's been 3 months now since you released this tool, axi0mX. That's great, but many of us haven't been able to use it, as our devices are not supported AT ALL, even though checkm8 works for them. Of course, an accomplishment like yours certainly deserves time off, but now that you've had a nice long break, PLEASE PLEASE  **PLEASE** work on getting more SOC's supported, I have a 4S and SE and neither work. If you need donations, by all means tell me where I can go, I'd do anything to be of help. Please don't leave us out in the cold.

future SoC support: s5l8940x, s5l8942x, s5l8945x, s5l8747x, t7000, t7001, s7002, s8000, s8001, s8003, t8012
Please suport s8000 device

I'm using macOS 10.12.6 Sierra and iPhone 5s. I can't get into pwned DFU mode needed for iOS 10 downgrade (Vieux). No matter if I use sudo or not, the results are the same. 
Is there anything I can do about it?
Linux can see my iphone 5 in dfu mode all up until the point that i execute ./ipwndfu -p

output:
` *** checkm8 exploit by axi0mX ***
Found: CPID:8950 CPRV:20 CPFM:03 SCEP:10 BDID:02 ECID:0000029B1419EDF1 IBFL:00 SRTG:[iBoot-1145.3]
ERROR: No Apple device in DFU Mode 0x1227 detected after 5.00 second timeout. Exiting.'

im using parrot os (i believe it's based on debian 10)

any ideas on why this might be?

Hey there,

I've seen evidence in the field that checkm8 in fact does work with later versions of the iPhone, we just need a copy of SecureROM to know the proper pointer tag and pointer authentication codes.  Opening an issue to track in case those become known.
