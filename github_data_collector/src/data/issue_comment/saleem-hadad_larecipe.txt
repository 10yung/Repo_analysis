**Describe the bug**
I can't seem to create new paragraphs or a simple blockquote
typically, I would have expected a double-space to instert a <br/> tag; a double-linebreak to create a new paragraph; and > to inster a block quote. no seem to be doing the trick.

Is this by design or have i missed something?

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

create a page
write a line of blurb
add  a double space to insert a <br/>
write some more blurb
add two linebreaks 
write some more blurb
prefix last blub with >
notice that none of the three tags had any effect.

**Expected behavior**
A forced line break, a new paragraph and a blockquote on the last line of blurb.

*I've not tested all the standard MD tags to see if any others aren't there.

I got white screen when i installed larecipe with existing project. i didn't find any error on console, after i find the problem because this code `:class="{'expanded': ! sidebar}"` when i try to remove it the page content is being displayed but the sidebar is not displayed.

There are two parts to this PR :
1. Added support for remote asset URLs when adding assets with `LaRecipe::script()` or `LaRecipe::style()`
2. Fixed issue where favicon links are added to the template when the config option `larecipe.ui.fav` is empty (default value)

**Part 1 - Remote Asset URLs**
Our product uploads all of our built assets to a CDN on deployment. We add assets to LaRecipe through a service provider like so:

```php
        // Add js scripts that will be injected into the larecipe layout
        $scripts = webpack_mix_collection(['larecipe', 'larecipeStyles'], 'js');
        foreach ($scripts as $key => $script) {
            LaRecipe::script('larecipe-' . $key, cdn_asset($script));
        }

        // Add css styles that will be injected into the larecipe layout
        $styles = webpack_mix_collection(['larecipeStyles'], 'css');
        foreach ($styles as $key => $style) {
            LaRecipe::style('larecipe-' . $key, cdn_asset($style));
        }
```

There is a massive performance improvement if LaRecipe can simply add the remote URL as the src of the scripts/styles instead of routing through the ScriptController/StyleController endpoints.

I wasn't sure if this feature should be switched on/off through a config option. Let me know if you think I should add that.

**Part 2 - Favicon Fix**
I noticed that with the default value of `''` for the `larecipe.ui.fav` config option, the template still added the `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" />` and `<link rel="shortcut icon" />` tags, which caused the browser to make requests to the root URL of our application. The fix makes these conditional based on the config value not being falsey.
**Describe the bug**
There is a (new, only appeared last few days to my knowledge) XSS issue which is exploitable on IE (I know.. but still) with the TOC.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '/docs/1.0/overview?"><script>alert("test");</script>'
2. See error, exploitable in IE, but does include urlencoded string in others

**Expected behavior**
Should not include unsafe HTML from URL on to page.

Did I miss something?
**Describe the bug**
When adding any blade directives inside of code blocks for my documentation, Larecipe tries to execute those code blocks as actual PHP code. If there is an undefined variable in the docs or a syntax error, the page will throw an error.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Add a blade directive such as `@if` to your .md file
2. Try and view that documentation, you will get an error

**Expected behavior**
Expected Behavior would be to see the documentation file, but instead I get an error

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: MacOS Mojave 10.14.4
 - Browser CHROME
 - Version 77.03

**Additional context**
I just upgraded to the latest version of Larecipe and this is happening now, it was not happening when I was using version 1.0.

If anyone could help me figure this out, I would really appreciate it :) Thanks!

**Describe the bug**
Laravel syntax rendering will report an error

```php
// 输出内容，被转义过的
{{ $var }}
// 输出未转义内容
{!! $var !!}
{{-- Blade 注释，不会被输出到页面中 --}}
// 三元表达式的简写，以下相当于「isset($name) ? $name : 'Default'」
{{ $name ?? 'Default' }}
// 等同 echo json_encode($array);
@json($array);
// 禁用 HTML 实体双重编码
Blade::withoutDoubleEncoding();
// 书写 PHP 代码
@php 
@endphp
@csrf // CSRF 域
@method('PUT') // HTML 表单伪造方法 _method
// 服务容器注入，后调用 {{ $metrics->monthlyRevenue() }}
@inject('metrics', 'App\Services\MetricsService')
```
The above code will report an error
