In v0.2.2.
Hi,

I managed to create a trelliscope that is able to have a state that sort certain cognostics automatically in acending or decending order and select what labels to display by default.
For example

```{r}
state = list(sort = list(sort_spec("Transition_Name",dir = "asc"),
                                     sort_spec("DataStage",dir = "dsc")),
                         labels = c("Transition_Name","DataStage","bqc_rsd","Area"))
```

May I ask if it is possible to set a state that has filtering capabilities ?
For example, create a state that filters "Area" between two values ?






Thanks for your nice work !

when figures get more, a search button which can search figures by key words with exact match or fuzzy match may need. Hope this will be added in upcoming works!

All the best !

I am attempting to plot a 3D plotly scatterplot in Trelliscope and have received various errors. One of which is, "the list does not contain 2 elements", and the other I have come across most recently is, "panel not written - must be trellis, ggplot, or htmlwidget object." From these errors, I am gathering that Trelliscope does not support 3D plotly images, is this correct? If my assumption is correct, does Trelliscope support any interactive 3D plotting options? I have attached an image of my test code for review.

Hello ! I have a little problem. I have tried trelliscope on some teaching platform, and it worked great. After that i tried same code in Rstudio(just for playing around with it), and it ended up with no plot. I can save a plot, but i can't see it in viewer or browser. And there were no error messages. I use R 3.5.2, ubuntu 16/04 and downloaded trelliscope package today. Maybe i did something wrong ? Thank you for your help!

Hi, 
Thank you for this very useful package
In this tutorial of trelliscope: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u9G7XGUVXI
One can modify the panel function through the interface. Is there a way to do it with trelliscope-js?

Hi,

I do like the package and the functionality as replacement for facet_wrap. Do you have an idea how facet_trelliscope might replace facet_grid?

Best regards,
Jürgen


Hi, I have install trelliscopejs package from R CRAN, try to follow Datacamp sample (gapminder data), but after processing progress bar: "writing panel", the chart not show anything.. My R version and RStudio is at the subject.

I'm using facet_trelliscope from the trelliscopejs package for data visualisation. It works fine when my ggplot has one layer. But if I introduce a second layer it doesn't facet correctly. Example:

```
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(trelliscopejs)    

# Basic stat summary table using iris
stat_sum <-
  iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise(l_mean = mean(Sepal.Length))

#Standard ggplot with facet_wrap 
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Petal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_vline(data = stat_sum, aes(xintercept = l_mean)) +
  facet_wrap(~Species)

# Use facet_trelliscope. Data from stat_sum does not facet
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Petal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_vline(data = stat_sum, aes(xintercept = l_mean)) +
  facet_trelliscope(~Species) 
```

See this question on stack:

First off, this package is awesome. Ive made this pull request because there is a small issue when using it with flexdashboard.

When using this package with flexdashboard the presence of a margin causes the bottom bar not to be visible, and removes a core part of the functionality. Changing this fixes the issue.

Is there any reason why there is a 30px margin?

Best
