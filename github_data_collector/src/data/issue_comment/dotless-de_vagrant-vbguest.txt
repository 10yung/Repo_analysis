Environment:
```
Windows: 10 ver. 1803
Virtualbox version: 6.0.12r133076 # The same error occured for Virtualbox 5.2.26
Vagrant version: Vagrant 2.2.4
```

Using latest debian stretch (9.9.1) vagrant box:
```
  config.vm.box = "debian/stretch64"
```

And latest vagrant-vbguest:
```
vagrant-vbguest (0.19.0, global)
```
When running `vagrant up` or  `vagrant vbguest` I got following error:
```
The following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.
Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed!

apt-get install -y linux-headers-`uname -r` dkms

Stdout from the command:

Reading package lists...
Building dependency tree...
Reading state information...


Stderr from the command:
