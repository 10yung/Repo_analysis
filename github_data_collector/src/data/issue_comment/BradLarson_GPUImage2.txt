Hello,

I am trying to add Toon filter to my images but it does not look like the live video view from the examples. 

I tried this one;
`let toonFilter = SmoothToonFilter()
        let testImage = UIImage(named:"1.JPG")!
        let pictureInput = PictureInput(image:testImage)
        let pictureOutput = PictureOutput()
        pictureOutput.encodedImageFormat = .jpeg
        pictureOutput.imageAvailableCallback = {image in
          self.imageView.image = UIImage.init(cgImage: image.cgImage!)
        }
        pictureInput --> toonFilter --> pictureOutput
        pictureInput.processImage(synchronously:true)`

and this one;

`let testImage = UIImage(named:"WID-small.jpg")!
let toonFilter = SmoothToonFilter()
let filteredImage = testImage.filterWithOperation(toonFilter)`
 
they all same. It put filter but effects are very low. I tried to change threshold and quantizationLevels but it same.

What is the problem ? How can I use this filter like FilterShowcase app video preview. ?

Thanks! 
Hi @BradLarson , now I am working on a filter of video streaming service. Thanks for you developing of GPUImage, it helps a lot. But when I testing the videos, I found that in specific video resolution, frame will be corrupted. 480p(480 * 852) is broken but 720p(1280 * 720) is fine. It looks like buffer stride's problem but not sure. For iOS, the same video works well.

Below is the broken image

And if you need the video to reproduce, please tell me. I could send you in mail or attach in this thread.

Best regards,

This upgrades the Swift language version to 4.2 (also tested with Swift 5.1 on macOS and Swift 5.0.1 on a Raspberry Pi).
This is to avoid crash when `shaderCache` is mutating and lookup happens

Hello @BradLarson ,
I am working on a video editing app using GPUImage which is quite helpful thanks to you. But I am facing this issue of  in ShaderUniformSetting  ->restoreShaderSetting function which I am unable to solve. Also in fabric its showing a GPUImage block destroy helper  issue occurring very often to users . If any of it seems known or if you can help then it will help me get out of a great trouble. Thanks

Hi, very excited to use the framework but I'm running into an issue. I'm using AVPortraitEffectsMatte to generate a "cutout" of a picture. It uses the CIFilter below

![maskCode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5865896/62074015-7a6d2800-b207-11e9-8bfc-6d57f868eb04.png)

Then I apply a filter like such:

![filteringCode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5865896/62076713-f36f7e00-b20d-11e9-9ab5-b6e9c27d3c55.png)

The cutout works great but when I go to add a simple filter like Brightness, the background no longer stays transparent, as seen with the images below. I've tried using a UIImageView as well as a RenderView.

Before:

After:

Is there anything I can do on either end (masking or adding filters) to keep that transparency? I'm planning to do some real time filtering as well as one time outputs. Edit: This also happens with any PNG photo that has a transparency.
I have lut.png file and i wanna apply this png file to image by filter. but in gpuimage2 i can`t find  GPUImageLookupFilter for lookuptable file. is it possible to use GPUImageLookupFilter in gpuimage2??
When macOS 10.15 will be released, I'll port some of my apps to macOS.
Brad do you know maybe if iOS-GPUImage2 is compatible with this?
