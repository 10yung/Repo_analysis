We are facing clashing implementation issue with facebook/folly (https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/compression/Zlib.h).

Please check the above logs, ioapi.h (https://github.com/marmelroy/Zip/blob/master/Zip/minizip/ioapi.h) is trying to include "zlib.h". It is resolved to "Zlib.h" from the folly.

Can you please change the import to "Zip/zlib.h"?
Hi, unfortunately I receive an error from apple when delivering the application. The error is:

> ITMS-90535: Unexpected CFBundleExecutable Key - The bundle at '/MyApp/Zip/Info.plist' does not contain a bundle executable. If this bundle intentionally does not contain an executable, consider removing the CFBundleExecutable key from its Info.plist and using a CFBundlePackageType of BNDL. If this bundle is part of a third-party framework, consider contacting the developer of the framework for an update to address this issue.

I tried changing the CFBundlePackageType to BNDL and removing the CFBundleExecutable from the Info.plist of the framework, but then the main application can't be installed anymore.
HI team, can I use this library to zip a video file with .mov/.mp4 format ?
Did this lib worked on project using xcode 11.1 + swift 5.1 ? I saw the commit on master about this but the release note didn't. Thanks guy. 
Can you please create a new TAG? The 'minizip' fix in master branch isn't released under a new tag. Thanks!
Please implement the import of the framework with the Swift Package Manager.
Hi, 

I am finding the error "could not find module 'Zip' for architecture 'armv7'; found: arm64" when I added zip framework and compiled my code.

Can someone help me with this?

Hello, I hope to provide support for Xcode 11 SPM.
If the URL's for unzipped files don't start with "file://" they can cause problems if
they are passed into other parts of iOS (eg share sheets).

Changing the URL constructor to generate file type URL's also correctly handles
paths with spaces. This eliminates the manual handling of these that's currently done.
