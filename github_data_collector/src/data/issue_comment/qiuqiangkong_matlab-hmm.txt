您好，是这样的，我看到了您的工具箱，冒昧的打扰您一下，因为我最近在研究HMM
我遇到了下面问题
1.连续型隐马尔可夫（CHMM）中 我的观测序列是4维的，这个到底是多观测序列，还是一个观测序列啊
2.对于多维数据，进行kmeans聚类，以及求取前向后向算法，这个具体该怎么对应，能否向您请教请教
麻烦您了！
Hello, yes, i saw your toolbox, take the liberty of bothering you because i recently studied HMM
I have encountered the following questions
1. The Continuous Hidden Markov (CHMM) in my observation sequence is 4-dimensional, this in the end is a multi-observation sequence, or an observation sequence ah
2. For multidimensional data, kmeans clustering, and seeking forward backward algorithm, the specific how the corresponding, whether to ask you to ask

Dear Mr.Qiuqiang Kong,

I would like to do Cross Validation to choose the best parameters such as # of states and  # of observation.
-My data is 9 dimensions because 3 for camera data and 6 for IMU dataset. is it possible to use more than 2 dimensions dataset?
-how can i use the test dataset in your code, did you provide the code or i should write by myself?
 thanks in advance.
