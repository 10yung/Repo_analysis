how to set Cancellable TRUE/False? 
Hi,
Can anyone explain how to use this fantastic library in a home widget?
I am having problem in adding this view to the remoteView in my AppWidgetProvider.
Thanks in advance

1. Add the following to your attrs.xml file (in res/values):

``` xml
<declare-styleable name="ProgressWheel">   
        <attr name="pwText" format="string" />
        <attr name="pwTextColor" format="color" />
        <attr name="pwTextSize" format="dimension" />
        <attr name="pwBarColor" format="color" />
        <attr name="pwRimColor" format="color" />
        <attr name="pwRimWidth" format="dimension" />
        <attr name="pwSpinSpeed" format="dimension" />
        <attr name="pwDelayMillis" format="integer" />
        <attr name="pwCircleColor" format="color" />
        <attr name="pwRadius" format="dimension" />
        <attr name="pwBarWidth" format="dimension" />
        <attr name="pwBarLength" format="dimension" />
        <attr name="pwContourColor" format="color" />
        <attr name="pwContourSize" format="dimension" />
</declare-styleable> 
```
1. Add the following code to the root view of your layout:
   `xmlns:ProgressWheel="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/com.visualdenim.schooltraq"`
2. Add the widget code in the appropriate place in your xml file. Here's a sample implementation:

``` xml
<com.todddavies.components.progressbar.ProgressWheel   
    android:id="@+id/pw_spinner"     
    android:layout_width="200dp"    
    android:layout_height="200dp"   
    android:layout_centerInParent="true"   
    ProgressWheel:pwText="Authenticating..."    
    ProgressWheel:pwTextColor="#222"   
    ProgressWheel:pwTextSize="14sp"   
    ProgressWheel:pwRimColor="#330097D6"   
    ProgressWheel:pwBarLength="60dp"    
    ProgressWheel:pwBarColor="#0097D6"   
    ProgressWheel:pwBarWidth="5dp"   
    ProgressWheel:pwRimWidth="2dp" /> 
```

create an ProgressWheel and setText with \n
lines overlap

AndroidStudio complains on xmlns:ProgressWheel="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/com.visualdenim.schooltraq", says

```
In Gradle projects, always use http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto for custom attributes.
```

Upon accepting the suggestion it works fine.

After adding the project as a dependency, when I run my application in an Android device it installs two applications, one of them is the actual application and the other one is the sample app from Progress Wheel. I cant figure out how to solve this.

Hello. When I build gradle, it keeps showing me this error: "Attribute "radius" has already been defined". After a little research I discovered ViewPagerIndicator library also uses "radius" attribute. They conflict.

So how can I successfully build both of them?

there seems to be large layout problems, you cant use fill_parent, wrap_content and even dp wont scale between resolutions. Client says it appears as a tiny dot for him even when ive specified 58dp, wonder whats going on ? 

@Todd-Davies please publish aar to Maven Central,Thank You.
