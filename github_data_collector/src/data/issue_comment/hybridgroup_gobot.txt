Please support Adafruit VEML7700 Lux Sensor - I2C Light Sensor

https://www.adafruit.com/product/4162

It is I2C so it should be fairly easy.

Both C and Python implementations exist.


What I have done:
1. Installed gort with homebrew
2. Ran `gort arduino install`
3. Ran `gort scan serial`
3. Ran `gort arduino upload firmata /dev/tty.usbmodem14201 -b uno`
4. Installed gobot with `go get -d -u gobot.io/x/gobot/...`
5. Copied _Hello, World of Things_ code example to `main.go` file (changed `"/dev/ttyACM0"` to `"/dev/tty.usbmodem14201"`
6. Ran `go run main.go`

Got error:
```
# github.com/go-ble/ble/darwin
../../../../go/src/github.com/go-ble/ble/darwin/device.go:67:12: cannot use d (type *Device) as type ble.DeviceOption in argument to opt:
	*Device does not implement ble.DeviceOption (missing SetConnectedHandler method)
```
Add delay for Run function of StepperDriver and create common sleep function.
Testing on the actual machine has been completed.

Issue: https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/issues/712
I've been trying to use the example provided https://gobot.io/documentation/drivers/pir-motion-sensor/ but used a different pin. The code can be found in https://play.golang.org/p/f1UQDG1htvP 

However, using the /dev/ttyACM0 gives me an error saying that the directory is not found. it looks like most of the search result is pointing to Arduino. I checked /dev/ folder and the one that I can see that close enough is /dev/ttyS0 and /dev/ttyAMA0.

I tried both but it gives me the error of :

I'd love to see support for ESP32 at some point. Based on https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/issues/301 it sounds like it might be straightforward once the upstream support for ESP32 is handled within firmata https://github.com/firmata/arduino/issues/315, but figured I'd open this issue to track this request and see if I'm missing  anything else.

Thank you for gobot ❤️ 
current adapter hard coded loading only the first joystick. added a new adapter that would allow for arbitrary joysticks based on id
Run function of StepperDriver does not working properly because there is no Sleep function.
This function calls step function very first cycle and should have a sleep like Move function.

Current Move function which has a sleep: https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/blob/master/drivers/gpio/stepper_driver.go#L214

Current loop of Run function without Sleep:

It would be great if gobot framework could contain built-in functionality for apps instrumentation, i.e. measuring resource usage, timings, histograms and counters for various operations, etc.
I'd recommend taking a look at [github.com/VictoriaMetrics/metrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/metrics) as starting point. It is easy to use and it integrates well with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) ecosystem.
Add new i2c feature for grovepi.

I use this code with the grove ultra sonic ranger : https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Ultrasonic-Distance-Sensor.html

Mainly based on : https://github.com/DexterInd/GrovePi/blob/3b43647a4c87a892578a6818d8d55d16d932edba/Script/multi_grovepi_installer/grovepi3.py#L191

Feel free to comment, accept or refused it ^^

btw : nice project ;)
