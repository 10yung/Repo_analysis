Hi,
I have a view controller scene in my story board. How can I use the KalView in order to display the calendar in to the controller scene?
Thank you

I wish to set the bounds of the Calendar to half the screen size. I do not wish to have the inbuilt tableview of the Kal Calendar view. Please help!

Thank you.

markTilesForDates  does not work,  and there is no dot for event on particular date.

I have used kal calendar and it was successful on iphone 4 and iphone 4s but when i tried to run it on iphone 5 (which is 4-inches) the window of the application and the status bar are shifted down and the app is not working in full screen
And here is a screenshot of what happens

Thanks
