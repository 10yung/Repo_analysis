Can we have Header checkbox with label
I am able to show checkbox in header. Is it possible to show text beside that or before that
 
how to disable paste for single column? `selectable : false` worked when i tried to paste for single column.
but when I copy data from two columns and try to paste on column besides the one having `selectable : false`, it allows me to paste.

AllowPaste option suggested by 6pac in Copy/paste doesn't work #575 didnt worked for column configuration.
beforeunload on slickGrid is not getting called for Firefox and Chrome.
It gets called for IE
I am getting this error even though code for AutoTooltips is there in my file.
Divide by zero issue on line no-1035,1058. The code follows-
 shrinkLeeway = 0,  Line no-1035
 var shrinkProportion = (total - availWidth) / shrinkLeeway;  Line no-1058. 


Hi,

I just want to place the search filter above the header column.Would be more helpful if it is solved.

Thanks in advance..
