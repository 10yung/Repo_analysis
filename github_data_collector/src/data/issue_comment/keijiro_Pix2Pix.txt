Hi Keijiro,

first of all thank you for your all your contributions!

I am using Unity3D 2019.2 on Windows 10 and the newest version of Pix2Pix does not work anymore. The rendering issue is there again. What I did so far:
1. I updated my Nvidia driver
2. I checked my .pict file if is in the StreamingAssets directory
3. I updated my PostProcessing plugin to 2.1.7 (I checked almost every version)
4. I rebooted my PC
5. I tried a completely different PC with same configuration

Since I was testing your previous version of the Pix2Pix Unity project, I checked the older version with Unity3D 2019.2 and it works like a charm. Sadly, the newest version is producing only this picture:

Hello Keijiro

Great implementation and optimization. Learning a lot about GPU compute by studying this code. 

I am trying to get this to run on an iPhone X. I believe it could, just need to limit the kernel usage. 

I might implement this myself and offer a drop down enum setting for mobile and desktop. 

Have you any suggestions where to start in the code. I'll then make a pull request so you can see if it's worth it. 

Regards
