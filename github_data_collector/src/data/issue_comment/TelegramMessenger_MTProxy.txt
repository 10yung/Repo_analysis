I follow [README.md](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/MTProxy) but it gets stuck at main loop

`# ./mtproto-proxy --ipv6 -u nobody -p 8888 -H 443 -S 2df9886999c6ea3b1fb3e34a8c5593af --aes-pwd proxy-secret proxy-multi.conf -M 1`

`# uname -a`
`Linux berbidvps 3.16.0-10-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.16.76-1 (2019-11-12) x86_64 GNU/Linux`
It is Debian jessie 64-bits VPS, on Hetzner.
It worth mentioning that i also run Openvpn on this VPS.
When I set it to 3 like this:
```
./mtproto-proxy -u nobody -p 8888 -H ***** -S ********* --aes-pwd proxy-secret proxy-multi.conf -M 1 --max-special-connections=3 --verbosity
```
only 2 devices can connect and these two devices cannot download anything.
If I'm wrong, how can I limit connections to server to only 3 users?
Could you compile the binaries for aarch64 architecture? To be able to run the service on a hosting like Scaleway.
And make the appropriate docker container to run on this architecture.....
A few minutes after running MTproxy I receive an error as below:

I tried update/upgrade my VPS OS, even reinstalled os and this problem not fixed yet.
Hi
I just saw new type of proxies

How can I make a secret like this
will officail MTProxy support this or I should change my server client?
explain for an amature please :)
Hello,

I have just finished the installation of MTProxy. I can connect to it but there is no transfer. Proxy Settings page shows it online and the blue check icon is there (TDesktop) however I can't send or receive any messages.

The server is hosted on DigitalOcean and firewall is stopped.

Please advise.

Regards

hi

im from iran

i set up proxy by this instruction :
https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/MTProxy
and cant connect to it with my DSL ISP
but it works fine with Mobile operators internet (IR MCI & Irancell)

i have 4 Hetzner & OVH servers and all of them have this problem 

is it because of Iran's telecommunication infrastructure firewall?

any solution?
I have a mtproto proxy like this:
server: sth.example.come
port: xxx
secret: some secret
and when I change the A record (IP) of the server to another IP, the telegram app cannot connect to the new IP and it still tries the old IP! the problem remains until I close the telegram app and reopen it! but I'm always setting the TTL for the record to 10 seconds and I think the app should lookup for DNS every 10 seconds, but it wouldn't.
how can this problem be solved? any idea?
