This updates to the devel branch of ggez (v0.5).

This fixes #75 ðŸŽ‰ 

Known issues & things to fix before merging:

* [ ] some of the text is misaligned
    * actually, the alignment seems to differ per-platform, so I'll look more into this
* [ ] only works on nightly since `ggez` uses `edition = "2018"`
* [x] ~~the shield powerup is not positioned properly~~
* [x] ~~does not work on macOS 10.14 (https://github.com/ggez/ggez/issues/478#issuecomment-437574823)~~
* [x] ~~remove SDL deps and guides~~
    * ~~`ggez` no longer uses SDL2, but now uses `winit` and `glutin` instead~~

Things to consider:

* ~~Should we remove `FiraMono` from the repo? `ggez` now bundles `DejaVuSerif` by default~~ removed

No need to merge now, this is here so we can fix things as they come.
Note: this is all on a separate `wasm` branch.

Things that need to happen:

- [x] Extract ggez business logic to its own crate (`ggez_backend`)
- [x] Add wasm backend, with extern functions to drive execution of the game
- [ ] Figure out if we can come up with an abstraction layer for the view, so we can share more code
- [ ] Document every method in the root library
Instead of playing the sounds at the same time, it queues them. Therefore, the sound is played multiple times after the enemies are destroyed.
