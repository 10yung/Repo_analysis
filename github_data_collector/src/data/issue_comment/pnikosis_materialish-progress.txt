hi! I think your project is really great! I appreciate to create great open source project. as a IT university student, Thanks to your project, I'm getting to know a lot.
while studying your project, I would like to be a little help to your project! I find a typo in your READ.me.  'Usage' subtitle, "you can create your own progress wheel
in xml like this (remeber to add .....)" I find a typo "remeber". I think you made a mistake. I'd appreciate it if you could correct this typo. please reading my issue.
I hope you will always be happy. 
 Fix #25 #52 
As "compile" is going to be deprecated end-2018, this PR replaces with "implementation" that is the new usage.
  <com.pnikosis.materialishprogress.ProgressWheel
        android:id="@+id/progress_wheel"
        android:layout_width="90dp"
        android:layout_height="90dp"
        android:layout_centerInParent="true"
        wheel:matProg_progressIndeterminate="true"
        wheel:matProg_rimColor="#ff0000" />

and in gradle 
    compile 'com.pnikosis:materialish-progress:1.7'

is there anyway to show value inside the progress bar other than fill it radius 
spin() does not work after I set at least once setInstantProgress(SOME_VALUE). If I do not call setInstantProgress at all spin works as intended. I used ProgressWheel along with "in.srain.cube:ultra-ptr:1.0.11". In pull to refresh (ptr) mentioned I use first linear progress. Right before ptr is going to be refreshed I turned off linear progress and start spin(). It does not work. I have tried to setProgress(0.0F) and setInstantProgress(0.0F) before calling spin(). It also does not help. I have tried to post spin() in Handler. No help as well. 
Add attribute/setter for Paint.Cap.ROUND for progress bar, because I have done it through reflection

Hi, 

I got an crash on the setbackgroumd for the ProgressWheel and it shows me that is nosuchmethoderror.

Fatal Exception: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: com.pnikosis.materialishprogress.ProgressWheel.setBackground API 4.0.4

Is there any solution for that?
