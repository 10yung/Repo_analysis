Hi,

I'm looking for the proper way to change the background color for a ButtonFormItem, but there doesn't seem to be anything built into the framework, and I was wondering if there was a proper way to do this. I tried doing it while overriding reloadForm() but it didn't have my custom color the first time the view loaded.

Thanks,

-Paul
How to implement the multiple selected from options?
Thanks for this amazing library. I'm trying to build a form with `SegmentedControlFormItem`, however the item alignment seems to be a bit off.

After viewcontroller with OptionPickerFormItem viewDidLoad  , it's possible update UI for add or remove items? 

`CocoaPods` and `Carthage` are awesome tools and make our life really easier, but there are some devs who still don't know how to use them. 

It would be cool to add the _Manual installation_ guide in your `README.md`. You can take a look at my [iOS Readme Template](https://github.com/awesome-labs/iOS-readme-template) to see how you can do it.

Add Switch See/Hidden password property on PasswordText! See project: https://github.com/PiXeL16/PasswordTextField

How to modify item? Example? I would like to add this feature to your code.

Would it be possible to extend this library to allow developers to specify custom fonts in the tableView cell?

Not sure if it's just me, or..is there no functionality for a required OptionPickerFormItem?..

For example user switch On/Off some option and and new section with some content will occur/hide in the current table

I try to find out how to get selected value , but have not a clue. Could you give me a hint how to do
In SignUpViewController.swift   maleOrFemale: ViewControllerFormItem 
if let x = context.returnedObject as? SwiftyFORM.OptionRowFormItem
 we can get title of user selected, but is there a way  to get  identifier  1(male)
OptionRow("Male", "1"),
OptionRow("Female", "2"),

Thank you very much
