- Dump-Server Version: 1.3.0
- Laravel Version: v6.7.0
- PHP Version: 7.3.0 , 7.4.0
- OS: MacOS Catalina 10.15.1

### Description:
```php
dump('this text is displayed in web output');
dump('this text is displayed in dump-server output');
```

While `php artisan dump-server` is runnig,
first `dump(...)` result is sent to the output of my application, and the next dumps appears in the dump-server output! 

The issue exists in MacOS, but same code is ok on other linux-based os.

anything to be considered?
As Symfony 5.0 just came out we could update this packages as well.

There aren't really tests in the package, so let me know if stuff broke.
I'll gladly fix it.

Any plans to provide auto-reload the dump.html file so the developer can immediately see the `dump()` calls without hitting F5?

This should be easily done by serving the dump.html file with browsersync:
```browser-sync start --server --files "./dump.html" --index dump.html```
But the html dumped does not have body tag and browsersync requires a body tag to embed its script.
In the most case, user just want to see the output on current request. This will be helpful if user can see the dump without scroll too much

If I use "**php artisan dump-server --format=cli**" with a json API, it will output the dump in response instead of the CLI.
I'm not sure if this is connected to #34, or not. I have noticed that when working from the command line and dumping or dd'ing, it is not outputting all items.

I have noticed this in conjunction with the `hyn/multi-tenant` package also being installed. It appears if I remove either this package or the multi-tenancy package, things return to working normally. I have posted an issue in their repo as well: https://github.com/hyn/multi-tenant/issues/713

However, I am having a hard time figuring out where the conflict is occurring. While diving through the code, nothing stands out, and also while triggering a manual exception after dumping, there doesn't appear to be any code run from the multi-tenant package.

Any thoughts as to what might be causing this, or where I might look further to try and debug this? Thank you!

**Update:** after further debugging, it appears this issue remains, even without `hyn/multi-tenant` installed. So perhaps my suspicion of a conflict with that package was premature.

Also, I wanted to clarify that this is the case when the dump-server is NOT running. Everything outputs fine when it is running.
Hi!

I get inconsistent results with my laravel valet. Below code dumps to dump-server every so often but not on each request. If I remove dump then of course code works as expected each time.

Any ideas what might be the reason for such behaviour?

```
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class TestController extends Controller
{
    public function test(Request $request)
    {
            
        $e =  [
            'foo' => 'bar'
        ];

        dump($request->all());

        return $e;

    }
}
```

Thanks!
It would be helpful to have an option to hide the info block:

```
 ------------ -------------------------------------- 
  date         Fri, 14 Dec 2018 06:42:36 +0000       
  controller   "HotelsController"                    
  source       HotelsSearchService.php on line 315   
  file         app/Services/HotelsSearchService.php  
 ------------ -------------------------------------- 
```
In my case I need to dump a lot of data in array, and this blocks take all the space on the screen, make it not comfortable to read and require to scroll a lot. It would be nice to have an option to not show this block.
