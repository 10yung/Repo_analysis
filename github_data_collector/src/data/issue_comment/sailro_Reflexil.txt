The problem was first found https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy/issues/1235, and I found the same problem exists in Reflexil
My referencing assembly has type in an attribute:

class Test
{
    [FaultContract(typeof(TypeInAnotherAssembly))]
    public TestMethod()
    {

Compiles to IL as:

  .method public hidebysig instance class Test 
          TestMethod() cil managed
  {
    .custom instance void [System.ServiceModel]System.ServiceModel.FaultContractAttribute::.ctor(class [mscorlib]System.Type) = (...full type name with assembly and public key token here...)

This public key token stays without any changes after removing strong name from the referencing assemblies. Preventing it from loading.
Hello guys,

I think it will be useful If the Method Definition window had a way to search for specific operand. Since I was looking for specific operand - which is a label text value- and I had to read the whole instructions of the method(18370) to find it.

Many thanks.



Hi, I've been using your plugin for .Net reflector for some time now and I really like it, saved me a lot, still I'm not sure if current version 2.2 has option to export and later to import methods, for example I have two dll files (same app , but feature removed) with same code except for one method which contains over 2000 instructions, so copying and pasting instructions is very hard job to do and mistakes can slip anywhere. So you get my point.
So far I only found out that I can inject new method into class, copy instruction from old dll and paste them and configure operand references because they got reset when copying. 

I hope you can help me which would save me a huge amount of time.

Thank you.
Regards.
One can currently (V2.2) set operand display base. Which affects both operand and offset columns.

I suggest to split that into two items in the configuration window: Create a separate "offset display base".

Offset in HEX and operand in DEC would speed up my workflow.
Similar to #98, when trying to "Replace all with code", I get the error `An assembly with the same identity 'mscorlib, Version=2.0.0.0, culture=neutral, PublicKey Token=b77a5c561934e089' has already been imported. Try removing one of the duplicate references.`

This is a unity DLL, so I tried loading in the bundled `mscorlib.dll` and `System.dll` as suggested in #98, but got the same error. So I tried removing my system's versions of those dlls, but still got the same error.

Could it have something to do with this reference?

Also, how do you change the return type of a method? I see the parameters tab, and a new parameter can be given the `isReturnValue` property, but what name should it be given?

Great tool by the way, thanks in advance for any help.
Reflexil works with .Net Core 2.0?

Thanks

This is the error message. It happens to me always when i try to modify some dll twice



After clicking on this field (http://prntscr.com/gzsm00) and browsing it's info with Reflexil and then saving the assembly (no changes made), 2D array is replaced by 1D array - http://prntscr.com/gzsmo8

Specifications for both fields are exactly the same - Array, Default, Default.

Is there any way to fix this?

Dll is here - https://www.dropbox.com/s/972ds2g0v79p54h/Original.rar?dl=0
The original dll has Debug Directory PE section, but after editing and "Save As" it's gone, so we cannot generate pdb files for those dlls. I'm using ILSpy + Reflexil v2.1.
