Kinda strange that Forsaken Remastered needs that... :/

Passing in a `VkFormat` that hal doesn't yet support results in `Illegal instruction (core dumped)` on linux, presumably because the enum result is not valid.

It looks like many of the `mem::transmutes` that convert to Rust enums are unsound. I didn't do an exhaustive search, but I did find these: https://github.com/gfx-rs/portability/commit/694474f46c5d8225107019ebf7650a5fa68d7241






Dolphin runs great when running using libportability (rather than the default packaged MoltenVK).

However there is one graphical glitch appearing in several games : **the player shadow is duplicated in the top left corner of the screen**.

It looks like an issue specific to the libportability layer – as it doesn't show when using MoltenVK (or another Dolphin backend). I hope this is a good place to report such issues.

## Screenshots

### Wind Waker

Notice the boat shadow on the top-left corner of the screen, in the sky.

### 1080° Avalanche

Notice the surfer shadow on the top-left corner of the screen, under the HUD.

## Testing environment

- Macbook Pro 13" with integrated graphics
- Intel Iris Graphics
- macOS 10.14.3
- Dolphin 5.0-9896
- libportability v0.6

Tested by running `LIBVULKAN_PATH=$HOME/gfx-portability-0.6/libportability.dylib /Applications/Dolphin.app/Contents/MacOS/Dolphin`.
This is natively supported on macOS/Metal and helps reducing the number of render pass switches.
