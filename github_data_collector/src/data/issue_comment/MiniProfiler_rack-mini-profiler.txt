This PR allows Rails application to use mini profiler without any of the monkey patches that mini profiler ships with, instead mini profiler will rely completely on [`ActiveSupport::Notifications`](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_instrumentation.html#subscribing-to-an-event). 

To use the non-patches version in your Rails app, add `config.mini_profiler_without_patches = true` to your environment configurations file(s).

There will be some differences between the patches and no-patches versions, for example most importantly measuring SQL/actions/render time won't be as accurate, and there won't be a `Net::HTTP` "step" because there is no official API that we can use to replicate what this patch does https://github.com/MiniProfiler/rack-mini-profiler/blob/master/lib/patches/net_patches.rb.
Recipe for using `Rack::Deflate` is not suitable for use with Rails 5+: #242
There was an update [#258](https://github.com/MiniProfiler/rack-mini-profiler/pull/258) with disabling of compression when mini-profiler is used with `Rack::Deflate`, so I think it would be better to replace that stale recipe with description of this behaviour
It seems that mini profiler is no (with version 1.1.0) dumping various internal errors into console, and profiling of XHR requests doesn't seem work any longer.

Errors dumped in startup

Since Rails 5 has parametrizied query statement like this:
`SELECT * FROM 'items' WHERE 'item'.'id' = $1 [['id',123]]`
So in panel we see `$1` instead of `123`
Params are not shown in rack-mini-profiler panel. This commit is a hack (ONLY FOR POSTGRESQL) to see params. Like this we can add for other DBs.
P.S. May be commit needs refactoring for optimization
Hello! All parameters of database query are not shown in profiler web window.
There is 
`SELECT  "items"."id" FROM "items" WHERE "item"."category_id" IN ($1,$2,$3) LIMIT $4;
`
But I need:
`SELECT  "items"."id" FROM "items" WHERE "item"."category_id" IN (11,12,13) LIMIT 20;
`
Why params may be filtered? In other project all is normal.

Rails 5, Ruby 2.5.1, Postgresql, **rack-mini-profiler 1.0.2**

Based on @nateberkopec 's recommendation, this change would display the Active Record queries hitting its query cache.
It would be useful to create a callback once the request completes which can take the timing data and do something with it (i.e. check if the page load took > n ms and log if so). Ideally it's a config setting that takes a proc/lambda and calls it with some neat hash of timing data, but if that's too expensive it could just use `page_struct`. It would be called somewhere around here:

https://github.com/MiniProfiler/rack-mini-profiler/blob/cc2620ba6d1c8e289d37bac20b35575396887ffa/lib/mini_profiler/profiler.rb#L336

It might also make sense to stick it in a `Thread.new` block to avoid taking too large of a performance hit.
It might be just me, but I would find it useful to see the name of the controller, not just the name of the action.
Hi,

First of all thanks for all great work put into the project, it's awesome!

One thing I was struggling with, is that I can't really use it standalone, outside of request scope as there's too much coupling happening in the rack middleware layer. I was wondering if there were any plans to refactor it (i.e. with the move towards `MiniProfiler/ui`)? Maybe also something I could help with.

Best,
Leszek
