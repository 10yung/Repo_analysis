## What did you do?

I have three major problems:

1. When presenting/dismissing my ViewController there seems to be this white background behind my 2nd ViewController but I would like to just cover my first ViewController with the 2nd without any white views.

2. My image disappears after the user starts swiping down behind my views when instead it should not change its position (preferred dismiss animation) until the view actually dismisses. Same things goes for the add-Button in the bottom right corner.

3. Like in the preferred dismiss animation my the backgroundView(lightGray View in the 2nd video) should dismiss a bit fast then the other subviews. I tried using the cascade-modifier but couldn't get that effect.

## What did you expect to happen?

This is how I would like my animation to look like: https://streamable.com/8wxco

##  What happened instead?

The problem is that it looks like this: https://streamable.com/1k7fj

I also have this question on Stackoverflow with my code ( and bounty): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59684779/swift-hero-animation-to-dismiss-view







@JoeMatt 

## What did you do?

I present a modal with ```vc.modalPresentationStyle = .overCurrentContext ```
The presentingVC is a chat app VC with a list of chats. The chatCell's have a titleLabel who's heroId is the same as the Modal VC's navigationBar titleLabel.

The presentation animation works beautifully there's no problem here. 

## What did you expect to happen?

When I dismiss, I don't want the same **match** animation that was used to present the modal. Instead I want it to dismiss normally with the default iOS modal dismiss animation.

To achieve this, I set ```hero.isEnabled = false``` in my modal VC right before calling ```dismiss(animated: true..)```

##  What happened instead?

Instead what happens is the modal will dismiss, I briefly see the my presenting VC with the cell that was tapped having it's subviews out of position. Then the view goes black. I debug the view hierarchy and it appears as if even my root viewController is dismissed so there's literally no rootVC in my viewhierachy.

How do I fix this to have a normal dismiss without Hero match animation?

## What did you do?
Using Hero's progress update functionality when dismissing a VC on a pan gesture causes many issues. 

- If you use the code in the example project (see below), the first issue is that on a fast pan, the screen freezes because the snapshot stays on the screen. 

- Some people suggested, that explicitly putting `Hero.shared.cancel()` and `Hero.shared.finish()` on the main thread fixes this issue.  This is partly true, but it introduces an other issue: now the screen won't freeze on a fast pan gesture, but the animations are skipped. On fast pans, the modifiers are ignored and the panned view snaps to its place in the parent VC in a strange buggy way.

- The only fix that solves these problems is to put finish and cancel to the main thread, and also detect fast pans and delay the dismissal manually, which is a really ugly, hacky, ad-hoccy solution.

## What did you expect to happen?
Using the code below should be able to handle pan gesture based VC dismissal, even when pan gestures are really fast.

## Demo Project (Hero Examples / ImageGallery)
```
@objc func pan() {
    let translation = panGR.translation(in: nil)
    let progress = translation.y / 2 / collectionView!.bounds.height
    switch panGR.state {
    case .began:
      hero.dismissViewController()
    case .changed:
      Hero.shared.update(progress)
      if let cell = collectionView?.visibleCells[0]  as? ScrollingImageCell {
        let currentPos = CGPoint(x: translation.x + view.center.x, y: translation.y + view.center.y)
        Hero.shared.apply(modifiers: [.position(currentPos)], to: cell.imageView)
      }
    default:
      if progress + panGR.velocity(in: nil).y / collectionView!.bounds.height > 0.3 {
        Hero.shared.finish()
      } else {
        Hero.shared.cancel()
      }
    }
}
```

PS: In my humble opinion, this is a really common use-case for Hero and I really want it to work seamlessly, but I was unable to figure it out on my own. Send help.

Hello,
I used hero transition in my application to match view from one view controller to another view controller , unfortunately I forced an issue with visible views ; both views in first and second view controllers have a background color with alpha component so after open the second view controller , the first one still visible under the second view controller ,please note that second view controller has a clear background and these properties 
1- modalTransitionStyle = .coverVertical
2- modalPresentationStyle = .overFullScreen 
To solve this issue we should change the opacity for first view controller to be 0 . Please check the attached SS

## What did you do?

I have a ViewController that has a subview with an AVPlayerLayer playing a video. To this ViewController I add a NavigationController as a child view controller, containing a rootViewController that has a view with an heroID. I have set the navigation controller heroNavigationAnimationType to .fade, and have set isHeroEnabled to true. The backgroundColor of the NavigationController and its rootViewController are .clear, so that I can see the video playing behind the NavigationViewController. The her animation works as expected, however during the animation the video turns black until the animation finishes. I have tried all possible combinations of setting .noSnapshot on the views, however nothing seems to be working. I suspect there is something with snapshotting going on that's the cause of this issue?

**How can I keep the video playing during a transition of the NavigationViewController?**

## What did you expect to happen?

I expect the video to continue playing

##  What happened instead?

The video shows black when I push a ViewController on the NavigationController. When the animation finishes the video is playing again. I suspect snapshotting is the cause of the issue, however this is pure assumption.

I redid the migration as per #594 , it also resolves #611 . Additionally, it added quite a few redundant roundtrip helper functions so I removed them.
