```
//func (l *ChannelList) Bucket(key string) *ChannelBucket 
idx := uint(h.Sum32()) & uint(Conf.ChannelBucket-1)  //其中 ChannelBucket = runtime.NumCPU()
```
只有当x=2^n(n为自然数)时，a % x = a & (x  - 1 )才成立，
又服务器cpu至少我见过有10核12核的

那么这里就计算出的idx会有问题吧

file path: message/redis.go

``` go
reg := regexp.MustCompile("(.+)@(.+)#(.+)|(.+)@(.+)")
```

This match for "*"@"*"# or "*"@"*", but for the file like *.conf, comment(#) is not required.

So, it's a good idea for change to the following

``` go
reg := regexp.MustCompile("(.+)@(.+)")
```

1. Modify absolute dependency path to relatvie path , when to fork gopush-cluster project, can save project to anywhere, will not dependency origin project .
2. Add config field mid_use_long_timestamp (default is yes), let user can select long or short timestamp to use. Because redis ZADD score dose not support whole int64, so when use long timestamp as mid, it will lead mid has been changed when save private message to redis, if use short timestamp , it will be work. For some business the short timestamp as mid is enough.
