This breaks with xcode 11.

Everything is good until I upgrade XCode to 8.3, and I got an error like this
xcrun: error: unable to find utility "PackageApplication", not a developer tool or in PATH

I googled this. It seems XCode 8.3 removed PackageApplication according to this

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43094380/whats-the-replacement-for-xcodes-packageapplication

https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-43163

Seems we need a fix for this?

From Xcode 8.3 “xrun PackageApplication” is removed and must replaced by xcodebuild --exportArchive ...
I had a problem with Makefiles when passing in the notes flag as `make` strips newlines from the content of variables. Instead of fighting with `make`, I added the `--notes-file` option to help me with this problem.
I get the token and appId on fir.com.  Then  I use  ipa distribute:fir -u xxxxxxxxxx -a xxxxxxxxx, get the error :    error: 784: unexpected token at 'Cannot GET /api/v2/app/info/xxxxxxxxxxxx?token=xxxxxxxxxxxx&amp;type=ios
'. Use --trace to view backtrace    
How to resolve it?
