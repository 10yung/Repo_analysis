Hi, sorry to open ticket for my question , actually I intend to made modular ESC in way that controller + gate driver is separated from Mosfets pcb , hence I could increase module ampere by adding parallel Mosfet in the Mosfets pcb, I really appreciated to have your advise or if you know open HW/SW sources let me know
The currently used Opamp is the OPA335 from texas instruments.

Hopefully we can find something less expensive.

The requirements for the opamp are probably:
- Low offset voltage
- Speed faster then the targeted maximum PWM frequency to be able to sample the current on the phases (>30khz)
- Rail to rail

Anything else?

Can anyone help with this search?

Strip uses currently an SOT23-5 3v3 regulator.

It should be changed to a SOT-223-4 package as it is cheeper and can handle higher current.

The regulator is on the same board as the power-stage that will elevate the temperature so we will most likely need more headroom.
