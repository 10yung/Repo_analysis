I had the error "<class 'AttributeError'> 'str' object has no attribute 'decode'" and no result, when trying to use patator tcp_fuzz. The attached fix made it work, but I'm not an expert at all in python, so I am not sure this fix is correct. It seems to work at least for human-readable protocols, meaning when the exchanged data contains printable characters.

Help me please. thanks

This is the payload iam using:
python patator.py http_fuzz url=random.site method=POST body='username=FILE0&password=aaa' 0=/path-to-list/usernames.txt accept_cookie=1 follow=1 -x ignore:fgrep='Invalid Username'

The candidates are all the names inside the usernames.txt list. So i guess something its not right.
Idk if this issue belongs here but i search everywhere online and i cound't find an answer.
Thanks
Hi!

I added the CHAIN\d+ keyword for simultaneous iteration of payloads e.g. burp pitchfork.

Example: patator.py dns_forward name=FILE0.FILE1 server=CHAIN2 2=./resolvers.txt 1=./targets.txt 0=./dns.txt

Above use case demonstrates subdomain bruteforce while simultaneously rotating dns servers to avoid throttling limits.
For some reason since I upgraded my kali to the latest version of patator it's not working anymore.
Even issuing a simple start command of patator causes it. (so just using command patator)
"Segmentation fault"

Tried fixes: 
-complete reinstall of patator
-using with python 2 and 3 also
-reinstalled my full kali from scratch, upgraded all components, triggered same problem

Cobalt Strike Team Server support added.

Vendor page https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-setup-collaboration

Based on https://github.com/RomanEmelyanov/CobaltStrikeForensic/blob/master/L6_CST_pass_check.py
Consider the following output:
19:18:29 patator    INFO - 0        28    0.014 | thisisasuperduperlonguser:password |     1 | \MERCY (Windows 6.1 Build 0)
19:18:29 patator    INFO - 0        28    0.020 | thisisasuperduperlonguser:123456   |     2 | \MERCY (Windows 6.1 Build 0)

The first one is a successful login and the second is not. There is no way to filter on a successful login?

PS: you can't use timing as an source. 
For HTTP >= 2.0 raw_requests (see below), the parsing fails with '_Invalid HTTP version (HTTP/2.0)_'.

```
POST /path HTTP/2.0
HOST: example.com

foo=bar
```

The underlying parsing library (BaseHTTPRequestHandler) does not have a support for HTTP/2.0, see https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Lib/http/server.py#L312 (which sort of make sense as this library is intended for running basic HTTP server and may not support it in near future either).

Current workaround is to replace HTTP/2.0 with HTTP/1.1.
Same behaviour on Python 2 or 3.   
Hello. Really not enough official docker image. Now i use next docker file:
```
FROM alpine:3.8

RUN apk update
RUN apk add --no-cache git py2-paramiko py2-curl curl py2-pip py2-impacket py-mysqldb freerdp freerdp-libs freerdp-dev py2-psycopg2 py2-crypto py2-asn1 py2-asn1-modules py2-snmp ospd-ikescan unzip nano
RUN pip --no-cache-dir install ajpy pydns ipy
RUN git clone https://github.com/lanjelot/patator.git

WORKDIR /patator

ENTRYPOINT ["./patator.py"]
```
Maybe it help and you make image in hub.docker. 
Hello. Now, if i want see a progress of brutefocre, i must press Enter or send keypress by automation script. I think it will be useful, if some param allow see work progress every N secs/mins. Like i will press Enter by interval.
