PR is similar to #767 with the updated set of dependencies.  Using the Go modules allows to build the project without having to install additional tools (`godep`), it also makes unnecessary to have a large copy of dependencies' code in the `vendor` subdirectory.  The Go modules also allow the project to be checked out and built in any directory (independent of the `GOPATH` tree).  
Can confd exit when a watch is lost on an etcdv3 backend?
I have a yaml file format like:
```
sshd:
  pubkeys:
    user1:
      - key1
      - key2
    user2:
      - key1
```
Then I would like to use confd template to generate a config file based on it.
Looks like confd doesn't like the formate, I tried the following template:
```
{{range gets "/sshd/pubkeys/*"}}
{{.}}
{{end}}
```

But it returned nothing.
Could someone take a look? 

Thank you

Redis connection:
`redis-cli -s /var/run/redis.sock`
And my configuration is stored in database 4.
So, I try:
`confd -onetime -backend redis -node /var/run/redis.sock/4`
But return the fatal:
> ./confd[24209]: FATAL dial tcp: address /var/run/redis.sock/4: missing port in address
Of courseï¼ŒI also configured the confd config file, and try again.

Is it my method wrong? OR Does confd not support selection database in redis unix connection? 
There are some open PRs that haven't been addressed, and many issues here and there. 
This is a new backend that uses the filesystem as a KV store.

It adds a new config option `max_file_size` to limit the size of files it will read to avoid unbounded reads.

This defaults to 16KB, which may still be too high.

The value of the key is the content of the file, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

Although not implemented, this probably should have a "prefix" value so that keys like "/myapp/database/url" could be relative to the "prefix" eg:

Prefix = /srv/config
Key = /myapp/database/url
Actual File Path = /srv/config/myapp/database/url

Currently, if you set `DYNAMODB_LOCAL` dynamodb will point to localhost, can'r point it to something else i.e using links or even a different port.
