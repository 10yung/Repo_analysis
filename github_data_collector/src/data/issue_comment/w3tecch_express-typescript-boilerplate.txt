I think that that `tslib` package should explicitly be listed in `dependencies` of `package.json`
https://github.com/w3tecch/express-typescript-boilerplate/blob/62c17993526eeffb4e64c2269da3ba4aa043a52a/package.json#L41


I had to change to 3.0.7. Previously, I had missing bcrypt module.

<summary>Changelog</summary>

*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/v4.0.14/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.0.14 - April 13th, 2019
> Chore/Test:
> - test: remove safari from saucelabs - 871accc
> 
> Bugfixes: 
> - fix: prevent RCE through the "lookup"-helper - cd38583
> 
> Compatibility notes:
> 
> Access to the constructor of a class thought `{{lookup obj "constructor" }}` is now prohibited. This closes 
> a leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.
> 
> This kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described
> in [#1495](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). We will **not** increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented, 
> and because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version
> and the issue may not be resolved on many systems). 
> 
> 
> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.0.13...v4.0.14)
> 
> ## v4.0.13 - February 7th, 2019
> New Features
> 
> - none
> 
> Security fixes:
> 
> - disallow access to the constructor in templates to prevent RCE - 42841c4, [#1495](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495)
> 
> Housekeeping
> 
> - chore: fix components/handlebars package.json and auto-update on release - bacd473
> - chore: Use node 10 to build handlebars - 78dd89c
> 
> Compatibility notes:
> 
> Access to class constructors (i.e. `({}).constructor`) is now prohibited to prevent
> Remote Code Execution. This means that following construct will no work anymore:
> 
> ```
> class SomeClass {
> }
> 
> SomeClass.staticProperty = 'static'
> 
> var template = Handlebars.compile('{{constructor.staticProperty}}');
> document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = template(new SomeClass());
> // expected: 'static', but now this is empty.

Hi, 

I really like this project and have found it useful a few times. As I've been learning nodejs and graphQL it's been a very useful resource for me. I'm still learning everything.

Does the author continue to evolve the project? Keep libraries upgraded, etc?

Look forward to seeing this project evolve and keep updated.

Thanks
I just saw in https://github.com/santiq/bulletproof-nodejs/issues/3 that the event-dispatch library is no longer maintained

See: https://github.com/pleerock/event-dispatch#readme

The suggestion is to look into https://github.com/KeesCBakker/Strongly-Typed-Events-for-TypeScript



Just for other people that come here from https://github.com/w3tecch/typeorm-seeding, this is out of date.

Please check the commits as the Readme is also out of date. Check this PR for something a bit more helpful. [PR Readme](https://github.com/w3tecch/typeorm-seeding/pull/13)
