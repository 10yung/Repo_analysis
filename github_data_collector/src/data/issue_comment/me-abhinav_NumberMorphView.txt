Hi, I couldn't use this library, I get index out of range in 

func updateAnimationFrame()
Sometimes at pNext and sometimes at pCur

let pCur = endpoints_scaled[_currentDigit];
let pNext = endpoints_scaled[_nextDigit];

I am using Swift 4 with Xcode 9.2

Hi, thanks for this great library!

Are there any plans to add Swift 4 support?
