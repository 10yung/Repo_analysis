Trivial, yay or nay?
Previously, the Hy files would be bytecode compiled before the
compiler's dependencies were installed. In additon, the revamped
version properly propogates the optimization level and generally is a
bit cleaner.

Fixes #1864.

This solution wasn't nearly as bad I thought. (Please forgive minor formatting issues atm, literally typed this whole thing out on a phone.)
Right now, if you run `setup.py install` without installing the dependencies first, then the install will fail. This is because all the Hy files are compiled *before* installation, but in order to compile them the dependencies need to be present.

Unfortunately, fixing this isn't particularly pretty. As it stands, setup.py doesn't install the dependencies *at all* thanks to this [ever-open setuptools bug](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/456). Right now, the setuptools install command does this:

- Gathers the distribution information.
- Builds a binary egg.
- Asks easy_install to install said egg, which will also install dependencies.

In order to install the dependencies prior to compiling the Hy bytecode, one of the following would need to be done (in combination for working around the issue mentioned above):

- Figure out some way to reliably iterate through the dependencies and install them first. This would probably involve copying a bit of small code from easy_install.py.
- Get easy_install to install only the dependencies first. I like this approach, but I'm trying to figure out how to do it without calling egg_info which would involve going through the manifest *twice* on install.

Of course, we could always just say the install command is broken. This isn't as insane as it seems, because right now the only reason you'd be forced to use the install command is for distro packaging, in which case the dependencies will already be installed. In all other cases, `pip install .` is superior in every way.
Closes #1831.

@hylang/core, recall that the two-week rule doesn't apply for releases, so I need at least two approvals to make this release.
Not sure this qualifies as a bug, but with my python hat on I'd expect let to be able to assign to n symbols returned as an n-tuple from a function, using python's standard tuple unpacking idiom.

So you can do this:

```hy
  (let [p (returns-tuple foo bar)                                                                                                                                                                          
        first-element (first p)                                                                                                                                                                                              
        second-element (second p)]                                                                                                                                                                                                
    (blah blah blah)) 
```

But you can't do this:

```hy
  (let [(, first-element second-element) (returns-tuple foo bar)]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
    (blah blah blah)) 
```
Hy fails to find hy modules when used in an embedded Python version.

given two files main.py and foo.hy

> import hy
> import foo

`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named foo`

Any chance support for this or pyinstaller can be added so we can create stand-alone Hy programs?
You'd think from the name, or from the word "traverse" in its docstring, that `walk` does some kind of recursive descent into its argument. It doesn't.

It looks like the function was inspired by Clojure, and by "inspired" I mean "literally copies part of the docstring", which could be a licensing issue (even if the Eclipse Public License is compatible with our license, we would need to keep track of the chain of copyright). Here's the Clojure implementation:

```
(defn walk
  "Traverses form, an arbitrary data structure.  inner and outer are
  functions.  Applies inner to each element of form, building up a
  data structure of the same type, then applies outer to the result.
  Recognizes all Clojure data structures. Consumes seqs as with doall."

  {:added "1.1"}
  [inner outer form]
  (cond
   (list? form)
     (outer (apply list (map inner form)))
   (instance? clojure.lang.IMapEntry form)
     (outer (clojure.lang.MapEntry/create (inner (key form)) (inner (val form))))
   (seq? form)
     (outer (doall (map inner form)))
   (instance? clojure.lang.IRecord form)
     (outer (reduce (fn [r x] (conj r (inner x))) form form))
   (coll? form)
     (outer (into (empty form) (map inner form)))
   :else
     (outer form)))
```

The Clojure implementation makes it clearer what `walk` is supposed to do: `(walk inner outer x)` should work like `(outer (map inner x))`, except `x` can be of several types that aren't supported by Clojure's `map`, and the return value of the `map` is reboxed in whatever collection type `x` started out as.

The Clojure implementation also makes it clear that the `outer` parameter is totally superfluous, because `(walk inner outer x)` is equivalent to `(outer (walk inner identity x))`. Why does it exist? Why did the programmer write `outer` in every branch instead of just wrapping the whole `(cond ...)` in `outer`? Why would a programming language that enthusiastically promotes side-effect–free programming be named after closures? There are some questions that man is not meant to know the answer to.

Here's the current Hy implementation:

```
(defn walk [inner outer form]
  "Traverses form, an arbitrary data structure. Applies inner to each
  element of form, building up a data structure of the same type.
  Applies outer to the result."
  (cond
   [(instance? HyExpression form)
    (outer (HyExpression (map inner form)))]
   [(or (instance? HySequence form) (list? form))
    ((type form) (outer (HyExpression (map inner form))))]
   [(coll? form)
    (walk inner outer (list form))]
   [True (outer form)]))
```

Two bugs are now obvious: in the first and third branches of the `cond`, the return value is not reboxed, and in the second branch, `outer` is called on a `HyExpression` instead of the reboxed collection.

So here are the changes to `walk` that appear necessary:

- Give it a better name.
- Remove the `outer` parameter.
- Rename the last argument. `form` suggests it is an unevaluated expression of some kind, which it might be, but it doesn't have to be.
- Fix the bugs.
- Improve the docstring.
- Ensure that it supports a wide variety of data structures.
In the current documentation the set of symbols I can reference in core hy is split into multiple distinct sections in the left-hand-side index: "Built-Ins", "Hy Core", "Extra Modules Index", and "Contributor Modules Index".  The "Hy Core" is further subdivided into "only one open at a time" lists of core, sequence, and itertools functions.

Especially with the built-in/core split this makes it more difficult than I'd like to navigate the system: I don't especially care if `instance?` is a built-in, or part of the core library, or supplied by itertools, when I just wanted to know what the function signature was.  

(OK, that one is kind of a gimmie when it comes to figuring out which section, but definitely things like `filter` or `name` are way harder to guess.)

Anyway, it'd be great if there was a single index that listed all those items so that I could scan the list to find what I'm looking for, click it, and get the right docs immediately.  In the Common Lisp HyperSpec (CLHS) this is their symbol index – it only covers symbols, as in functions, global vars, etc, and not, eg, syntax discussion, or anything like that.

I am not familiar enough with Python documentation generators to know how/if this can be done, and I'm unfortunately not in a position for a couple of months due to USA related work issues to be able to contribute to make this happen.  Sorry.
`'f"{a}"` raises `NameError: name 'a' is not defined`.
The AST walker in `hy.contrib.walk` doesn't see inside of an f-string, so the `let` macro built on it will fail when the inlined code references a let-bound variable:

```
hy unknown using CPython(default) 3.7.5 on Darwin
=> (require [hy.contrib.walk [*]])
True
=> (let [a 1] f"{a}")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "stdin-15ddbd2ca7b71de7866cc45806e8764b30264dcd", line 1, in <module>
    (let [a 1] f"{a}")
NameError: name 'a' is not defined
```

"unknown" is "master as of the time of submission"
