Dear sir,
I try to use the back trajectory functions to draw picture.
I try to use "@param map.res" to change the base map. You give us three chioce in this parameter "TRUE","hires" and "state", but I want to use a higher resolution base map which have the states boundary in my study region like the [map.res = "state"].
I see the source code of the "openair" package, but I still don't know how this function run.
Maybe, my IT skill is poor.
So, could you tell me how to change the base map to my needs if the "openair" package has this function now?
Thanks

Dear sir
I have the precalculated back trajectories for my location stored. I am not able to import the precalculated back trajectory into the system.
The response is coming like this. Kindly help me.

l1itraj <- importTraj(site = "newmanali", year = 2016, local = "c:/users/pavan aditya/Documents/R/TrajProc/")
Error in UseMethod("close") :

Hi,

When using the percentileRose function, sometimes white bars occur in the center of the plot.
What do these bars mean? Should they be removed and how can they be removed?

Thanks in advance.

minimal working example using example data:
http://www.openair-project.org/Downloads/ExampleDataSets.aspx

`df = read.csv("OpenAir_example_data_long.csv")`
`library(openair)`
`percentileRose(mydata = df)`

Hi, 

Last few days I've been using the function importKCL(), it was working  but today after typing for instance:
> mary <- importKCL(site = "my1", year = 2000:2009)
 
I've got this error:

Error in load(con) :

Good morning, 

I have had an issue when trying to plot one particular month in the timePlot( ).  I want to look at one pollutant, and "Stack" they years for October to see how things vary over the years.  Generally it works, but there are formatting issues.  The pane on the left of each plot normally displays (or used to) the year for which the data relates to.  More importantly the bottom left corner of each plot displays 01-Oct, but no other ticks along the x axis.  This will not change no matter what nuber of date.breaks or date.format combination is used.

Has anyone found a way around this?  I am running openair 2.6-6 in RStudio.

The code I am using is something like: 
timePlot(selectByDate(mydata,month = 10), pollutant = "benzene", stack = TRUE)

Hi David,

I'm wondering what kind of distance measure is used to calculate clustering with corPlot() and if some references are available.

Thanks for the info and for openair.

Hi Prof. davidcarslaw,
When I use the selection of "windflow" in the timePlot, the error “3: In max(dat[[ws]], na.rm = TRUE) :
  no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf” occurs , and the corresponding erros appears in the figure as" Error using package 1 "x" and "units" have length>0"
The corresponding codes are as follows:
timePlot(photochemicalperiod,pollutant=c("O3","ws","wd"),windflow = list(col = "grey", lwd = 2, scale = 0.1)).
Thus, how to solve this problem? Also, how to use the windflow in the timePlot? 
Thanks a lot 
Best wishes, 
Gen


Hi.
I was used to plot timeseries with timePlot: several variables, ungrouped. Very useful. 
In the openair version 1.8-2 the function automatically adjusted the ylim for each variable, so that it was possible to display variables with different ranges.
Now I'm migrating to openair 2.6.5, an the y-limits are fixed, they are the same for the different variables, so that it is not possible to display e.g. pressure and temperature.
Am I missing something?
Thank you very much
Hi,
I use the openair package a lot for air quality analysis so thanks heaps for developing it.  I live in the southern hemisphere and previously I've had no issues with using hemisphere="southern" when using type="season" in a function.  More often now it doesn't seem to work and the seasons end up wrongly labelled in the plots.

For example, the command below, produced the following image.
> scatterPlot(seas2,x="soi",y="iod", type="season", hemisphere="southern", linear=TRUE) 

![Scatterplot_hem_southern](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45218985/64734776-63766100-d53b-11e9-8035-6752d8d19884.png)

Winter here is JJA and summer is DJF!  Has something changed or is there something I'm missing?  The timeAverage function is also not labeling the seasons correctly for the southern hemisphere in the resulting dataframe.

I use openair for other types of analyses, which often include rainfall.  It would be really useful to have "sum" as an option in the statistics call so that I can get monthly/seasonal totals of rainfall from the daily data.  

Regards,
Kathleen

Hello,

I am using the openair package version 2.6-5 to analized air quality monitoring data. In particular, I am interested to use the function **TheilSen**. I have already installed the openair package version 2.6-5 as is shown in the figure.  
![OpenAir](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19626443/61912173-02e58300-aeff-11e9-9aa8-0bbc78863fbe.png)
When I try to use the **TheilSen** function, I get an error (see figure below):

In R studio:

And in R:

The data that I used for this is the following (the time is in TUC format):
