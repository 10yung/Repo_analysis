very simple query.

my ISP gave me shared ip.
then how it will help me to connect with my godaddy domain? or LIVE IP (for direct ip connection?)
I cannot start the tunnel, I always get an error. I did everything by the instruction in Running section and this is where I am stuck on: 

`$ tunnel -config ./tunnel/tunnel.yml start-all` - command
`tunnel: command not found` - I get this error

What should I do? I would like to use this for my school project. Thank you for any help.
As the heading says, pretty simple question. Having some trouble getting connected from a certain location and I suspect it's port related. 
Hello, I have been playing around with this and it seems to be working well and easy to set up, maybe to easy. Then it occurred to me that my server isn't only allowing "known" clients to connect, but just anybody who happens to know the server IP.

How does one restrict what clients are allowed to connect to a server?

Thanks!
I'm trying to set up tunnel to my machine behind nat. Server that I'm using has external ip and domain name.
On the client I'm getting:

`level 0 msg dial failed network tcp addr 10.10.10.10:8000 err tls: oversized record received with length 20527`

Where 10.10.10.10 is the server's public ip, port 8000 on the server is open.
On the client, on request I'm getting:

`level 0 action round trip failed addr 95.150.97.128:58987 host 10.10.10.10:8000 url / err client not subscribed`

95.150.97.128 is the host I'm doing the request from.
My client's tunnel.yml:

```
server_addr: 10.10.10.10:8000
tunnels:
    djangoapp:
        proto: http
        addr: localhost:8000
        host: my-domain.co.uk
```


```

Hello,
When I'm using the `-clients` option server side,
I always get the following error:

> device ID invalid: incorrect length

It seems that the client cert ID uses base32 to encode sha256.
However, after trimming '=' at the end,
the 32-byte fingerprint has only 52 characters in base32.

So what is the correct form of client cert ID?
Change "tuneld" to "tunneld".
root@tunnelclient-VirtualBox:/home/tunnel-client# ./tunnel start-all
configuration error: failed to parse file "tunnel.yml": yaml: line 1: mapping values are not allowed in this context
root@tunnelclient-VirtualBox:/home/tunnel-client# cat tunnel.yml 
server_addr: 13.229.203.69:5223
    tunnels:
      webui:
        proto: http
        addr: localhost:8080
        host: webui.my-tunnel-host.com
      
root@tunnelclient-VirtualBox:/home/tunnel-client# 

>> whenever i tried to run the client above error , I'm new to this kindly help me 
I have been experiencing some issues when the Internet state changes (with connectivity to without connectivity)... apparently the client doesn't reconnect to server. A single restart on any side recovers the tunnel.

Any insights?
