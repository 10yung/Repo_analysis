Xcode 10 fail build atlas pod because it have info.plist duplicate.
#1435 introduces messages cache in `ATLConversationDataSource`. One issue is that it gets `objectChanges` but don't `updateMessages` at the same time. If there are messages coming between the time `objectChanges` is got and the time `updateMessages` is called inside `performBatchUpdates`, the number of sections will not be consistent between the changes made in the `performBatchUpdates` closure and after the update completes, which leads to a crash.
This PR fixes the issue by `updateMessages` right when `objectChanges` is got.
According the the documentation comments above `ATLConversationViewControllerDelegate messagesForMediaAttachments`
```
If `nil` is returned, the controller will fall back to default behavior. If an empty
 `NSOrderedSet` is returned, the controller will not send any messages.
```

However returning an empty set will cause the location message to be set. This PR fixes that so that functionality matches the documentation comment
pod install changes might be the version of cocoa pods I'm using.

For our implementation of Layer, we'd like to use a custom presentation for avatars for conversations that involve more than two participants. This allows for those avatars to be squares.

Presently, all avatars are forced to be rounded due to [this line](https://github.com/layerhq/Atlas-iOS/blob/55055fa37dca431848f2636e226b071b020b4157/Code/Views/ATLAvatarView.m#L245) in [`ATLAvatarView.m`](https://github.com/layerhq/Atlas-iOS/blob/55055fa37dca431848f2636e226b071b020b4157/Code/Views/ATLAvatarView.m).

The following changes were made to facilitate square avatars:

* Add [`shouldApplyRounding`](https://github.com/layerhq/Atlas-iOS/pull/1446/files#diff-549bf36b88dff5721e72ab84b55e04f5R54) property to `ATLAvatarItem`
* Default it to `YES` in [`LYRIdentity+ATLParticipant`](https://github.com/layerhq/Atlas-iOS/pull/1446/files#diff-0eb7659ab309504bdaa44adb4a759872R42)
* Query this property in `ATLAvatarView`'s [`layoutSubviews`](https://github.com/layerhq/Atlas-iOS/pull/1446/files#diff-74161f962dd375a1949fe202bc7e19f6R245)

This prevents the view controller from crashing when Apple's UICollectionView bug for inserts manifests itself.
• When tapping on the camera button, it gives the option to choose “Last Photo/Video”. When selecting this option, the action sheet disappears but the messageInputToolbar never reappears. This fixes that issue.
