Hi,
Will this tableview needs solution to handle iPad floating keyboard? 
cheers

On an iPad with a hardware keyboard and the shortcuts bar enabled:

If the scroll view has a bounds of:

CGRectMake(0, 138, 787,  327)

and the keyboard has a bounds of:

CGRectMake(0, 713, 1024, 55)

Then the bottom inset ended up being -107, which would make the bottom content of the scroll view inaccessible.
Getting an error 
Unknown class _TtC8Swiftapp28TPKeyboardAvoidingScrollView in Interface Builder file
I view the  code, and I realize that such as TPKeyboardAvoidingScrollView always to find it subviews to resign fist responder, but when the text field is not the subview, it doesn't work. so I think we can add a  touch block to TPKeyboardAvoidingScrollView, and call it in (touchesEnded: withEvent:), I can set this block to do my custom event

Hi Team 
I am facing this issue on my storyboard.  Please give a solutions or resolved this issue
  
file:///Users/vvishwakarma/appinventor/Projects/AVDESH/H2oPharmarcy/ios/source_code/H2OPharmarcy/H2OPharmarcy/Resources/Base.lproj/Main.storyboard: error: IB Designables: Failed to render and update auto layout status for HistoryVC (AhN-ep-Ly9): dlopen(TPKeyboardAvoiding.framework, 1): no suitable image found.  Did find:
	TPKeyboardAvoiding.framework: required code signature missing for 'TPKeyboardAvoiding.framework'

On latest version pod file
I have a tableView with Dismiss on Drag set in the storyboard. If I 'drag to dismiss' the bottom contentInset is never restored after the keyboard goes away (and other weird things happen after that). 

The keyboardRect in the keyboardWillHide notification always has a height of zero and the code in TPKeyboardAvoiding_keyboardWillHide ignores the notification in that case. If I tap in the tableView or close the keyboard another way things work normally. If I comment out the first four lines in TPKeyboardAvoiding_keyboardWillHide then things work normally even for 'drag to dismiss'

I'm observing this on an iPad on iOS 11.

Is it safe to comment out those four lines? 
I am using this amazing library TPKeyboardAvoiding for many years but now I am having problem in iOS 11's. That is new property "safeAreaInsets" which is being introduced by Apple with the release of iPhone X. But TPKeyboardAvoiding doesn't obey the safeAreaInsets and hence doesn't scroll exactly when keyboard appears.

Please resolve this issue.
