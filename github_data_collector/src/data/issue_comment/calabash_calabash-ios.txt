I am trying to dismiss a springboard alert on the client using 
device_agent.dismiss_springboard_alert("Continue") 
When I checked with device_agent.springboard_alert_visible? 
It returned false even when the alert was present on the screen 
This always worked and is working with all other versions except for ios 13
Currently I am trying to input a password in a textfield placed on a springboard alert. But command keyboard_enter_text() throws with "Keyboard is not visible", however keyboard is present on screen. Auto dismiss springboard alerts is disabled.

I looked into the code and it seems that query for keyboard into docked_keyboard_visible? function fails to get the right value.

The setup used for testing is:
- iPhone 7 (iOS 13.3)
- Xcode 11.3
- Ruby 2.6.3 (with rbenv)
- calabash-cucumber-0.21.10
- run_loop-4.5.2
- macOS 10.14

```

My Xamarin Forms application interacts with some hardware and needs permission to use Bluetooth and/or USB to function at all, so we end up triggering a permissions dialog at startup. It caused me to bump into [this issue](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Managing-Privacy-Alerts%3A--Location-Services%2C-APNS%2C-Contacts), but I think this is an inelegant solution.

If there are things that can go wrong if the application does them before Calabash finishes loading, I feel like loading Calabash should either block until it finishes or provide some mechanism to notify me it is finished. For example, I wouldn't mind inserting a loading page to my application and have "Calabash is complete" part of the criteria for that page's dismissal. That would allow me to notify the things that communicate with hardware it's OK for them to progress.

A delay works, but is inelegant. I have to guess how long, and environmental changes could make this problem rear its head again.
Xcode 11.0

Manually tapping on field I see keyboard on simulator. On ios 12 everythings are work as expected 
When I'll building my calabash-target having an error, Apple Mach-O Linker Error Linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) in the Xcode workspace.
can you help me how to resolve this error? Thank you.

This is my first time running UI tests with calabash and I am running into an issue with the DeviceAgent.

running `start_test_server_in_background` in calabash-ios console is giving me the error `Could not connect to the DeviceAgent service.`

Any help would be appreciated, thank you

This is my first attempt at testing iOS 12. I'm running into problems with installing the device agent. 
iOS - 12.1
Xcode - 10.1
MacOS - Mojave
calabash-cucumber- 0.21.5

I've seen some other codesigning errors related to provisioning profile before and was able to fix them but I can't make any left or right of this exception. Please take a look.

Hello everybody! 
I have just tried to run our tests on the newest simulators
iPhone XR and iPhone XS Max and it was launched and seemed to work but experienced the issue with device resolution (it started to run but when it went to tapping on some element it used wrong location for it and tapped on near one). Let me explain why I think that the issue is related to this. I compared iPhone X where resolution is equal to 1125x2436 pixels and XR (828x1792 pixels), so I was able to use query ("* index:0") for getting the first child element from the whole view and received the same size for some element in pixels. It hasn't to be like that because of different screen sizes (resolutions). To prove that I compared iPhone SE with iPhone 8 where resolutions are not the same and query returned to me different sizes of the chosen element. Please let me know if somebody knows any solution.
Thanks in advance!
By the way, I used calabash-cucumber #0.21.6
