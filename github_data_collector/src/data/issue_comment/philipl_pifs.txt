When launching `./configure` on Ubuntu Server 18.04 x64 (EC2 on AWS) it gives me this error: 
```
./configure: line 4310: syntax error near unexpected token `FUSE,'
./configure: line 4310: `PKG_CHECK_MODULES(FUSE, fuse >= 2.8)'
```
Fuse packages I have installed and them versions:
```
libfuse-dev 2.9.7-1ubuntu1
fuse 2.9.7-1ubuntu1
```

We could look for each `n` bytes in pi, thereby making it take exponentially longer, but it would enable much better compression. 

Maybe we could also do multiple passes, storing the metadata in pi as well, with a higher compression setting, and so on and so forth. 

It'd also be really nice to implement a separate compression tool, rather than a filesystem, like `zip`, so that we could compress single files.
In the readme it talks about knowing the location of your file in pi but the output data is just a bunch of random characters when i open it with a text editor.
i think pifs can then achieve 200% compression
The README states _"They said 100% compression was impossible? You're looking at it!"_

There's a fundamental flaw in this statement:
`Compression % = 100 * ( 1 - ( Compressed Filesize / Uncompressed Filesize ) )`

So for instance we compress 100 MB of data into a 20 MB archive, then we have a compression of:
`100 * ( 1 - ( 20 / 100 ) ) = 100 * ( 1 - 0.2 ) = 100 * 0.8 = 80%`

In order for us to have a 100% compression, we'd have to compress our files down to 0 bytes.

We still require massive amounts of storage to index the digits of pi and we still need storage space for the software that is supposed to calculate the digits of pi in order to retrieve our information.

So it's probably best to state that this method is **almost 100% compression** instead.
As you probably already know, in three days [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) compliance must be implemented for all storage solutions that process data of European citizens.

In your README I noticed the following line:

> π holds every file that could possibly exist!

This sounds extremely alarming as it looks like in three days use of this technology will be considered illegal. Please advice on how I would go about removing my personal data from π.
"They said 100% compression was impossible? You're looking at it!"
instead of compressing files, I'm ending up with files about 53846 times bigger than there size
The README says that
>One of the properties that π is conjectured to have is that it is normal, which is to say that its digits are all distributed evenly, with the implication that it is a disjunctive sequence, meaning that all possible finite sequences of digits will be present somewhere in it.

My organisation requires all software to be formally proved to *always* give the correct output. The fact that it is conjectured is not enough. Please add a unit test that proves the normality of pi.
