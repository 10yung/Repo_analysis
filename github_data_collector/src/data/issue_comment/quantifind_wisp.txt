I was looking forward to trying `wisp` but after importing the project into Intellij IDEA and launching the console, when I type `import com.quantified.charts.Highcharts._` I get an error `error: object quantified is not a member of package com`.
Really a cat image for the logo.

I have successfully added Wisp dependency on my All Spark Notebook (https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/all-spark-notebook). In other words, I am able to import the following apis without any problems:

> import com.quantifind.charts.highcharts.Highchart
> import com.quantifind.charts.highcharts.Highchart._
> import com.quantifind.charts.Highcharts._

In addition, the following command works fine for me:

> val myplot = areaspline(List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), List(4, 1, 3, 2, 6))
> myplot.toJson

In fact, it generates something like:

> {"series":[{"data":[{"x":1,"y":4},{"x":2,"y":1},{"x":3,"y":3},{"x":4,"y":2},{"x":5,"y":6}],"type":"areaspline"}],"exporting":{"filename":"chart"},"yAxis":[{"title":{"text":""}}],"plotOptions":{"areaspline":{"turboThreshold":0}},"credits":{"href":"","text":""},"chart":{"zoomType":"xy"},"title":{"text":""},"xAxis":[{"title":{"text":""}}]}

However, it is not obvious to me how to tell Jupyter to convert the above JSON into a real plot?

I realize this project is no longer under active development, but could you release 0.0.5 artifacts on the maven central repository? The current version is 0.0.4 https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/quantifind/wisp_2.10/

Please and thanks!

Suppose I plot sth; eg. the following: 

``` scala
Highcharts.areaspline(recall, precision)
Highcharts.xAxis("Recall")
Highcharts.yAxis("Precision")
```

It starts running the server and hangs in there: 

```
[info] INFO  [2016-05-28 16:35:30,037] org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server: jetty-8.1.13.v20130916

```

How can I stop the plot server without restarting sbt? 

I am trying to plot "scatter" chart and I am setting a label for every Data object - 

```
  def createSeries(clusterName : String, wordPoints : List[WordPoint]) =
    Series(
      data = wordPoints.map(
        point => Data(point.x, point.y, name = Some(point.word))
      ),
      chart = Some("scatter"),
      name = Some(clusterName)
    )
```

But label (Data name) is not showing. If I am using another chart, f.e. "spline", I can see labels.

By manually editing the generated .html and changing:

```
<script type="text/javascript">$.ajax({url: '/check', dataType: 'jsonp', complete: function(){location.reload()}})</script
```

to

```
<script type="text/javascript">$.ajax({url: '/check', dataType: 'jsonp', complete: function(){}})</script
```

It worked

Seems like a while since the last release

Currently, `BoxplotData` has fields specifically for {min, q-0.25, median, q-0.75, max}, but another popular box-plot gives the mean, and +/- a 0.95 confidence interval (based on t distribution for sample mean).   Or sometimes +/- 2 standard deviations, etc.

Ideally, `boxplot` would allow a selection of alternatives for generating the box and the mid-line.

Currently the x/y bounds of the plot seem to be set automatically, and I can't change them.  It looks like that may require some tweaks to the javascript as well as the scala layer.
