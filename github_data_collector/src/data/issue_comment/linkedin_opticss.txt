<summary>Release Notes for 3.0.0</summary>

<h1>3.0.0 (2020-01-16)</h1>
<p><a href="https://urls.greenkeeper.io/christopherthielen/typedoc-plugin-external-module-name/compare/2.2.1...3.0.0">Compare <code>typedoc-plugin-external-module-name</code> versions 2.2.1 and 3.0.0</a></p>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>emptycomment:</strong> Remove empty comments on source reflections that are being merged, just in case.. not sure if this is even necessary! (<a href="https://urls.greenkeeper.io/christopherthielen/typedoc-plugin-external-module-name/commit/bd9b5cd">bd9b5cd</a>)</li>
<li><strong>typedoc0.16:</strong> Some fixes for 0.16.x (WIP) (<a href="https://urls.greenkeeper.io/christopherthielen/typedoc-plugin-external-module-name/commit/0089d19">0089d19</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>typedoc0.16.4:</strong> Support typedoc 0.16.4 (<a href="https://urls.greenkeeper.io/christopherthielen/typedoc-plugin-external-module-name/commit/02aa15a">02aa15a</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>BREAKING CHANGE</h2>
<p>This plugin no longer attempts to work around the two comment problem in order to identify a comment as module documentation.  I recommend using the <a href="https://urls.greenkeeper.io/TypeStrong/typedoc/issues/603#issuecomment-569133556" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/TypeStrong/typedoc/issues/603/hovercard"><code>@packageDocumentation</code></a> annotation going forward.  The <a href="https://urls.greenkeeper.io/TypeStrong/typedoc/issues/603#issuecomment-569133556" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/TypeStrong/typedoc/issues/603/hovercard">issue comment</a> states that TypeDoc will continue to support the two comment legacy mechanism.</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<pre><code>/** @module foo */
</code></pre>
<p>After:</p>
<pre><code>/** @packageDocumentation @module foo */
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>/** @packageDocumentation @module foo */ /** for typedoc */
</code></pre>
