Cached repository not used because, setLastCacheTime not called. Where can I called that?
App can't load data from the URL , gives 404 https://joe-birch-dsdb.squarespace.com/s/team.json
Why didn't use directly AndroidSchedulers and Schedulers from RxAndroid?
Hello,
the build fails with
> /clean-architecture-koin-boilerplate/data/src/main/java/org/buffer/android/boilerplate/data/BufferooDataRepository.kt: (3, 21): Unresolved reference: Completable

I like your example a lot and I want to take it as a template for my own app (that fetches board game infos). I was wondering (with regard to clean architecture and 3 tier architecture) whether there is no domain layer (pres-domain-data) or if you just didn't highlight it specifically (like in your first clean-android-architecture example).

Thank you very much, 
Christian
Could you please update to the lasted version of koin
Thanks in advance!
   Hello,

   I will use your template for a new project at work and we have decided to update its dependencies. I have updated all library versions and migrate everything to AndroidX, including tests. There is a changelog file with all the changes and I have added a plugin for checking dependency updates.

   I hope you find it useful,
                                               Xavi

Hello, I want to say, wow, really good boilerplate code. But it would be awesome if you could make it as online generator, because refactoring packages can be tedious
The current configurations for Travis CI causes the build to fail since the SDKs specified different from the ones being used in the project.
Hello, can the app use Kotlin Extension Functions to map the data in the Remote and Cache modules instead of using a Mapper interface? Maybe this will not be _clean_ in some way since the function will only apply to the Data Models that have been specified but in my opinion it's one less object we have to create or mock. Your thoughts @hitherejoe ?
