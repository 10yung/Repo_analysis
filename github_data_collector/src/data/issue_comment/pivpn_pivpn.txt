As the topic says, I am getting this error when starting the installation. I have installed osmc on it and a plex server.

Hello,
I have set up a Pi with Pi-Hole and OpenVPN using pivpn.io. All is working perfectly and the extensive information I've found in forums has been very helpful. I've run into an issue. The default ip scheme in OpenVPN is 10.8.0.0 and I'd like to change it to 10.8.1.0 as this is a second Pi on my network serving the same purpose. I have modified the openVPN.conf file:

> server 10.8.1.0 255.255.255.0
> push "dhcp-option DNS 10.8.1.1"

and my remote testing system connected via vpn receives a 10.8.1.x address and connects fine. It is able to resolve local dns (systems I've added to dnsmasq) but not anything outside of my network (Internet). The log file for pihole shows the following:

Dec 30 09:48:21 dnsmasq[1079]: query[A] www.raspberrypi.org from 10.8.1.2
Dec 30 09:48:21 dnsmasq[1079]: forwarded www.raspberrypi.org to 127.0.0.1
Dec 30 09:48:21 dnsmasq[1079]: reply www.raspberrypi.org is 104.22.0.43
Dec 30 09:48:21 dnsmasq[1079]: reply www.raspberrypi.org is 104.22.1.43

but the remote system errors out: This site can't be reached. www.raspberrypi.org took too long to respond. ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT
Hopefully I'm not missing something simple--I've searched quite a bit and haven't found any similar information/solutions.

Futher info:
Kernel IP routing table
Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
0.0.0.0 10.0.0.1 0.0.0.0 UG 202 0 0 eth0
10.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 255.255.252.0 U 202 0 0 eth0
10.8.1.0 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 tun0

I am unable to ping my gateway, 10.0.0.1 which leads me to think that it isn't routing from 10.8.1.1 vpn gateway to 10.0.0.1 gateway, then out to the Internet.

Thank you for your help.
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Yes; When I decided to change my Public DNS Address to the one I desired to use instead, I wasn't able to located nor edit the "Default.txt" text file in the directory stated in the answer (`/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/Default.txt`). *NOTE: this may be because I am trying to perform this operation on my Raspberry Pie 3.*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
As I rummaged through my `/etc/openvpn `folder, I found the `server.conf` file and was able to access it and change the appropriate settings detailed above.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
N/A.

**Additional context**
For some reason, I wasn't able to edit the contents of the `server.conf` file without going into the terminal and sudo-ing the edits myself:

In other words, (from the home directory) just copy and paste this into the terminal:

`sudo nano /etc/openvpn/server.conf`

Then, just edit what you want!


Thank you all,
Aviel

**Describe the bug**

The if statement at: https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn/blob/8d9bb3422b4f608011ca4ac6b741268d71eaedc3/auto_install/install.sh#L490-L496

Is always evaluated to True as an echo will always produce a new line even if a var is empty. 

**To Reproduce**
Just try this part of the script alone: 

```
#!/bin/bash
if [ "$(echo "${availableInterfaces}" | wc -l)" -eq 1 ]; then
	IPv4dev="${availableInterfaces}"
	echo "::: No interface specified, but only ${IPv4dev} is available, using it"
else
	echo "::: No interface specified"
	exit 1
	fi
```

**Expected behavior**
Script should bailout if it cant find any available interface as well.

found this while reviewing test branch code, Will be submitting a fix for this today, latest tomorrow. 
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
On test branch when choosing VPN Protocol user should do yes for wireguard, or No for OpenVPN. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Instead of of a yes/no selection, a radiolist defaulted to wireguard would be better and more intuitive. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Instead of Yes or No Buttons or radio list, having 2 buttons wireguard and OpenVPN can be good as well.. however not really sure how to do it with whiptail as i am not that good with it.

**Describe the bug**
When performing an unattended install (--unattended) install.sh exits unsuccessfully and immediately when there are non-existent old configuration files. The error text is:

> cp: cannot stat '/tmp/OLD_UFW': No such file or directory

In this specific example it is due to ufw not being installed and enabled. The lines causing the issue are 1058-1061:

`$SUDO cp /tmp/noUFW /etc/pivpn/NO_UFW`
`$SUDO cp /tmp/OLD_UFW /etc/pivpn/OLD_UFW`
`$SUDO cp /tmp/INPUT_CHAIN_EDITED /etc/pivpn/INPUT_CHAIN_EDITED`
`$SUDO cp /tmp/FORWARD_CHAIN_EDITED /etc/pivpn/FORWARD_CHAIN_EDITED`

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Start from clean system install (without ufw)
2. Create file /etc/pivpn/setupVars.conf
3. Fill-in /etc/pivpn/setupVars.conf as appropriate:
`INSTALL_USER=pi`
`UNATTUPG=unattended-upgrades`
`pivpnInterface=eth0`
`IPv4dns=`
`IPv4addr=192.168.1.2`
`IPv4gw=192.168.1.1`
`pivpnProto=ufw`
`PORT=1194`
`ENCRYPT=256`
`APPLY_TWO_POINT_FOUR=true`
`DOWNLOAD_DH_PARAM=false`
`PUBLICDNS=[REDACTED]`
`OVPNDNS1=1.1.1.1`
`OVPNDNS2=1.0.0.1`
4. Run unattended installer
`bash install.sh --unattended`
5. See error
> ...
> cp: cannot stat '/tmp/OLD_UFW': No such file or directory
6. Check exit code
`echo $?`

**Expected behavior**
Installation to continue progressing and error not thrown to console

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Yes, once PiVPN install process complete, if the static IP params are not removed, the Pi will not reconnect to mesh network. So we must remove the dhcpd added lines

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Offer a choice to set a static IP or not. If user select Yes, the actual way to configure is continuing. if NO is selected, it continues like a non-raspbian device do.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
None

**Additional context**
We use RPI over AREDN mesh network to provide Internet access to certain in mesh devices. Configuring static IP in PiVPN just keeps the device out of network on reboot. We use DHCP reservation instead of fixed IP because in case of IP collision, IP of the nodes can be changed to mitigate problems.

I have followed the process out line in 
how to add multiple ports (say 1194,943 and 443 in UDP and TCP for load balancing etc.) #178
but is it not loading all the /etc/openvpn/*.conf files and openvpn is not listening on the additional ports I have configured with each .conf file. The /var/log//openvpn.log shows only the server.conf file loading.

Is there an updated process for the Buster kernel 4.19 release of Raspbian?
Hello,

thank you for that great installation script!
But I‘ve got an issue with it:
I set up an openvpn-server with TCP because I had a few problems with UDP in the past. When I use the public ip-address, I don‘t have connection problems. But when I use the public domain of my FritzBox, the following message is shown in the terminal while connecting to the vpn:
```

SIGUSR1[connection failed(soft),init_instance] received, process restarting 
Restart pause, 5 second(s)
```

Although I can connect to the vpn and use it, it takes some time to establish the connection.

I searched the internet but the result weren‘t very helpful.

So, how can I solve that problem?


Thank you for your answer in advance.
Creating this to keep track, and in case community wants to help out with Distro Testing. 

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Master Branch is currently supporting a lot more distros/Versions than Test branch, some getting deprecated, others still LTS. 

https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn/blob/05b189486d0a8b8c1c1bae1000fdd3c2e44644ce/auto_install/install.sh#L100-L138

Test branch needs to be tested in different versions of raspbian, Debian, Devuan with both OpenVPN and Wireguard to make sure all is fine and then added to the list of supported OS (#889)

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Test with different systems, and report back results. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

I personally like to quickly disregard older versions, however in this situation at least LTS should be supported. 

**Additional context**
N/a
