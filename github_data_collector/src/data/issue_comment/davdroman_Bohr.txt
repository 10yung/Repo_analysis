While building with Xcode 8.3.2, following compiler warning is received:


.../Pods/Bohr/Bohr/BOTableViewController.m:54:1: Method possibly missing a [super awakeFromNib] call


Trying to use BOChoiceTableViewCell in Swift3 and set optionValues but its throwing a "no member 'optionValues'"?
Does it support adding an icon on the left side of the cell, similar to the iPhone settings  ? or should i edit the source code so it supports adding an icon ?
Update cocoapods to 1.1.1 and
 pod 'Bohr', '3.0.0'

Bohr will have path issues.

need to remove subdirectory Bohr and use quotes 
```
#import "BOTableViewController.h"
```

The labels and fields in Section 2 of the demo app are not aligned. The accessory view is slightly misaligned on the Y axis. The blue text field should be moved down a couple of pixels, it seems:

I create a  `BOButtonTableViewCell` and set `destinationViewController` for it, but after go the destination view controller and then go back to Bohr controller, the item's title disappears!

``` objective-c
        [section addCell:[BOButtonTableViewCell cellWithTitle:@"Sample Text" key:nil handler:^(BOButtonTableViewCell *cell) {
            cell.mainFont = [UIFont fontWithName:FONT_MAIN size:18];

            SampleViewController *dvc = [[SampleViewController alloc] init];
            cell.destinationViewController = dvc;

        }]];
```

How to solve this issue?

The `footerViews` method always returns the cached array, once it has been created for the first time. This causes a crash in `tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForFooterInSection:(NSInteger)section` if you change the number of sections of the table after the `footerViews` array has been created

I set the property for a variable with numberOfDecimals = 2, however I can type or enter the big number: 10,0000. It is still okay. Is this a bug?

Allow the ability to set a custom NSUserDefaults object instead of using standard defaults (e.g. if an app extension wants to shared defaults using an app group, one might want to initialize an NSUserDefaults object with a custom suite identifier).
