We multi-bytes users want to treat UTF-8 as is like Yajl(Ruby). 
FYI, Yajl(ruby) doesn't quote UTF-8 strings.

This patch quotes not UCS-2(UTF-8) but only UCS-4(UTF-16). 
Thanks

Hi,
my CPU usage goes up when I pass big HTML to com.twitter.Json.json.quote
do U have any clue about this issue ?

Currently, the scala-json won't process mutable map correctly in Scala28 branch. Maybe you want to add few lines to support them just like my branch.

Hey there

If I want to depend on this from a scala project, what's the best way to do it?

Is it published in a repository anywhere? or do I need to build and push to a local repository? (The build system I'm using, scala's simple-build-tool, seems to look for dependencies in a default local ivy repository at ~/.ivy2   -  I tried 'ant package' and 'ant push' to publish here, but didn't do what I wanted... the latter fails with "unknown resolver push")

Anyway some basic instructions in the README would be great, especially for us rubyists looking into scala, who're still getting used to the java toolchain...

Cheers muchly
