I am working on a project that is using MKNetworkKit version 1 with a ton of deprecated functions. My app references MKNetworkEngine and MKNetworkOperation which don't exist in the new version so it's not an easy swap. How do I upgrade to version 2 of MKNetworkKit?
in delegate function didCompleteWithError，activeTasks has enumerateObjectsUsingBlock，alos  in runningTasksSynchronizingQueue，activeTasks can revmoeObj or addObj。enum activeTasks in a queue，revmoeObj and addObj in runningTasksSynchronizingQueue。 i think there need o lock
MKNetworkEngine observeValueForKeyPath:ofObject:change:context:

[UIApplication sharedApplication].networkActivityIndicatorVisible =
    ([_sharedNetworkQueue.operations count] > 0);

Will throw a issue what is "UI API called on a background thread".

MKNetworkEngine.m   line 185.

Unix method strptime_l() can not process the the date after 2038.  When i try to use it to convert the date string '2050-12-30 00:00:00', i get an amazing result '1969-xx-xx'

is that support ipv6 of iOS? AppStore reject!

When I use startUploadRequest to upload image data to server, it throw a exception:
"Upload tasks from NSData are not supported in background sessions"

the code is such like that:
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MKNetworkRequest *request = [self.host requestWithPath:@"MyUrl" params:finalSendParams httpMethod:@"POST"];
[request attachData:data forKey:@"img" mimeType:@"image/jpeg" suggestedFileName:@"img.jpg"];
[self.host startUploadRequest:request];
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in function -(void) startUploadRequest:(MKNetworkRequest*) request;
use the backgroundSession like that:
request.task = [self.backgroundSession uploadTaskWithRequest:request.request
                                                      fromData:request.multipartFormData];

maybe we can only upload files "fromFile" in backgroundSession rather then "fromData".

how can i cannel all request
