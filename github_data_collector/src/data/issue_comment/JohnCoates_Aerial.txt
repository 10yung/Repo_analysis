#### Description of issue / Feature request

I just downloaded the newest version on Aerial today, and I have lost the ability to click the right arrow key to cycle through the scenes. I was hopping this could be looked into, or if this is a 10.15.2 issue I would just like to be aware of that. Thank you.

#### Feature request

It would be great to have a "stream external source" feature.
For example video streams 
I'm thinking of red bull daily highlights or YouTube videos etc etc etc.
I know I can download videos to a specific location and it will play them aka I could do it with a daily cron but I'd prefer to have an option to paste in a list of urls or some form of json etc

I'm not profound in swift else I would do a PR, but maybe you can point me to the right direction and I'll at least try to implement it and contribute to this awesome project <3 


It would be nice if there was a setting to show the current battery level or to hide it if the battery was fully charged
I would like to set the clock to a monospaced font but not the extra message under it. 
I liked the idea of the spanned mode for multiple-displays but the resolution is too low when spreading across 3 monitors. The independent mode works well but when you have all the videos selected, the 3 that it picks can be completely unrelated to each other.

Since the videos are already grouped by location and by day/night- could we have an option for the Independent mode to select 3 videos from the same group, for my 3 monitors?
ie. All the 3 of the great wall videos, or even all 6 of the china day videos could be shown simultaneously. Or all 3 monitors could pull from the day time set of San Francisco for example, showing different aspects of the same city.

In the current version, I saw a dessert, a city and an urban park from different locations when I tried it just now..

Even better would be getting to choose our own groups, but I imagine that UI would be too complicated / not worth the effort.
Running macbook pro 2018 13" with Catalina and Aerial 1.6.2. Not running any external monitors.

Some videos do not run full screen and only appear in the lower left hand corner of the screen.. Sometimes the same video runs fine.. All videos selected are downloaded and in the cached folder.  Log and screenshot of issue attached. Is this a known issue? Thanks!

I've always used the text in the left corners, but today I was looking at it and thought it might be interesting to see what it would look like centered on the top and bottom (time on top, description on bottom, or vice versa)
For anybody delivering classroom-style training workshops, it can be difficult to get everybody back into the room on time.

The best way I've found to do this is to put a countdown timer, in minutes, on-screen. 

It puts the onus on the participant to work out when to be back, so they won't be the one walking in late. 

Everybody knows where they stand by just looking at the screen, even the trainer.

This would also give the screensaver project some free advertising because many people will want to know "where did you get that!"

Bonus features for me would be-

a) allowing tapping the up or down arrow on the keyboard to add or delete minutes
(saves opening the preference box to change time from say the prev. 60min lunch to 15min pm break, just tap or hold up or down key; also allows you to quickly time a class exercise)

b) play a sound when the timer reaches zero
(airplane seatbelt sign turn-on sound ;-)

c) minute display flashes (and or changes colour) when it reaches zero

d) if you could get a screensaver to transmit over a web-meeting from the host's machine, that would be pretty cool for online lessons (maybe this is already a thing, I can't recall)

Love this thing, thank you to the team ⭐️👍😀

Edit- FYI, I use a hot-corner to activate the screen saver.
