Sample browser does not use `AppLinksFeature` to launch market place intents.  Crash occurs when `AppLinksFeature` is not being used.

Using the current locale aware classes, we are able to change:
- the app's base configuration locale at app startup

- all activities context configuration when they restart

However, in Fenix we have some singleton classes(ex:Settings.kt) that get their strings from appContext, which will be unchanged during app runtime, even though we selected a new locale from our language list. We need a new method that updates the base configuration
## Preconditions:
Have some progress on Fennec Nightly.
## Steps to reproduce
1. Replace Fennec with Fenix using a [build](https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/tasks/index/project.mobile.fenix.v2.fennec-nightly.2020.01.17.revision/e4eba42b93d58586b2afb6e13d3e57b37a5209c3).
2. Use the `adb shell am start -n org.mozilla.fennec_aurora/mozilla.telemetry.glean.debug.GleanDebugActivity --ez logPings true --es sendPing migration --es tagPings ab1test` command in order to trigger the`migration` ping.
### Expected behavior
The migration ping is generated.
### Actual behavior
The migration ping is not generated and the `Attempted to submit unknown ping 'migration'` is displayed in logcat.

### Device information

* Android device:  Google Pixel 3a XL(Android 10), Google Pixel XL(Android 10), Motorola G4(Android 6.0.1)
* Fenix version: Nightly migration build 2, 01/17.
