Can i hide controller before full presentating, press or swipe?
In my project I have a more complex view controller hierarchy with embedded view controllers containing a table view. In order to dismiss, when the scroll view of the table view is scrolled to the top and further I use:

```swift
func scrollViewDidScroll(_ scrollView: UIScrollView) {
    SPStorkController.scrollViewDidScroll(scrollView)
}
```

But `presentationController(for controller: UIViewController) -> SPStorkPresentationController?` will return nil in my case as the modally presented view controller is some levels higher than the view controller containing the scroll view.

The code looks recursively for the presentationController until it finds it or the parent property of the controller is nil.
Hi,
I'm integrating the pod in an objective-c project, but I'm facing several issues.

I have the following code:

SPStorkTransitioningDelegate * transitionDelegate = [[SPStorkTransitioningDelegate alloc] init];
    transitionDelegate.storkDelegate = self;   <---------- ERROR
    transitionDelegate.confirmDelegate = dialPad;
    dialPad.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationCustom;
    dialPad.transitioningDelegate = transitionDelegate;

The error is:
Property 'storkDelegate' not found on object of type 'SPStorkTransitioningDelegate *'

Any advise?
There is no option for disabling swipe gesture during runtime. For example, I have a UITableView with editing mode and reordering cells. While moving cell down SPStorkController fires UIPanGestureRecognizer and dismisses the screen. 
Hi, 
Is it possible to disable transform of root view? 
I want to achieve a state that the root controller will not change its size or position (including corner radius).

Hi, first of all, I have to say that your project is fantastic and works so smoothly.

This pull request is about to add a new feature, and this feature is about to dismiss this view using the pan on UIScrollView.

I hope it can help others with the same problem.

Would be nice to make the colors on the close button editable. This patch should do the trick.

If present controller 

```swift
class TextFieldController: UIViewController {
    
    let textField = UITextField()
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        self.view.backgroundColor = .white
        self.view.addSubview(self.textField)
    }
    
    override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewWillAppear(animated)
        self.textField.becomeFirstResponder()
    }
}
```

 with `SPStorkTransitionDelegate`, animation for parent controller accelerate. If remove 

```swift
self.textField.becomeFirstResponder()
```

all work correctly. 



Is it possible to enable user interaction during transition?
Is it possible to present UIImagePickerController as SPStorkController? When I try to do this it presents in full screen.
