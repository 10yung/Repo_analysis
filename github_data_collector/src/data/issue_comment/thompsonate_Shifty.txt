Hi,

First thank for your amazing work on Shifty I love it !!
I use it everyday nothing to complain about really ðŸ˜„ !

I've configured Shifty to disable **night shift** and **true tone** when starting Photoshop.
That way I'm sure my screen calibration will not be affected.

But one last thing can **break** my screen calibration, which is monitor brightness.

I've found this CLI solution: https://github.com/nriley/brightness

The precision is awesome to get perfect calibration.
I was able to set the brightness to **0.716** which is impossible with the keyboard or the slider.

But there is some down sides to this solution:
- **MacOS settings Automatically adjust brightness** have to be disabled
- it's not automatic (can forget to do it and break calibration)
- using CLI is not accessible to everyone

So I was thinking about how Shifty disable **true tone** for an application.
It could be use to set a specific brightness per application programmatically! ðŸ˜„ 

I hope you like the idea!

Cheers
I have disabled night shift for the TV app (10.15.1) but it's still kicking in when playing a video fullscreen on a secondary display. If I move the mouse to make the controls appear then night shift suddenly disables but then kicks in again as soon as the controls fade. Doesn't seem to be a problem when I'm not using another display.

In Catalina, system color tint presets are here, including a greyscale one. Maybe this might be a fit? This would be awesome to have such option. Triggered after a certain time or even (and maybe I'm overthinking it) linked to the new Screen Time feature. What do you think?

Edit: Just like in Android with the Digital Wellbeing system app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wellbeing. By the way, love this app. Thanks for doing it! I'm available for testing if you need some :)

I don't know why but especially after the computer wakes up from sleep Shifty may stop responding because of high CPU usage. From a sample it seems to be stuck responding to accessibility events which seems to be fired non stop?!?! I really have no clue....
It'd be great to be able to optionally hide the menu bar icon out of the box and not rely on third-party menu bar managers.
I use Parsec (https://parsecgaming.com/) which, when connected to another machine, spawns a Parsec Game Window.  I'm unable to disable night shift on just the Parsec Game Window, and the logs say "Could not obtain bundle identifier of current application" whenever I try to click the option moused over in the screenshot.

Disabling for the regular Parsec window works fine - but that doesn't also disable night shift on the actual game window - and my games look much better without night shift on!

Please let me know if there's any other information you'd like.

It would be nice if Shifty would also change the Terminal profile when (un)setting Dark Mode. This would only require a check box, two input fields for the theme names and some AppleScript. :-)

Hi there, I'm curious if it's possible to use Shifty to disable Night Shift if a certain app is running at all - rather than just when it's in focus. 
Thanks for your great work, it is really handy!

It's great to toggle Shifty by using custom shortcuts, but an Alfred workflow can make it more visually straightforward, I'm not a programmer, it's hard to make this happen. If you are an Alfred user as well, please help! 

For specific features, please check [this workflow](http://www.packal.org/workflow/amphetamine) (on Packal.org) for [Amphetamine](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12) ï¼ˆMac App Store), it can toggle on/off and toggle on for a certain period.
