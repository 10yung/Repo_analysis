If you put `{ a: "w", b: "hello", c: 123}` into the inspector it gives an error: `SyntaxError: Unexpected token (4:3)`

There's some debate as to whether this is actually a bug, since it's technically a block scope with labels... However the Node REPL and Chrome Inspector parse it in the way one would expect..
something like this:

```ts
 tensor.set([2, 3, 2], 0);
```
http://propelml.org/docs/#Tensor[Symbol_iterator]


Currently the dataset is specified as a string:
```
pr.dataset("cifar10/train")
pr.dataset("iris")
```
It would be better to use actual functions for each. example:
```
pr.dataset.cifar10("train")
pr.dataset.iris()
```
This allows for type checking on the components of the datasets - that is cifar10 has `{ images, labels }` and iris has `{ features, labels }` - thus the docs will better reflect the information people need.

`splitName` should default to `"train"`

Add test and avoid repeating the string "// New Notebook. Insert code here."  in the code.
cifar10/train is 150mb and mnist/train is 50mb - accessing a single element from either of these will trigger a download of the whole set.

Ideally we can split these datasets into ~ 2mb chunks so they can be downloaded progressively. If only one batch is inspected (like for debugging) only 2mb will be used.

I've already split cifar10/train images into these files and uploaded them (using [this script](https://gist.github.com/ry/6a284a67eb0118f97b97889ee0309e76))

src/mnist.ts can be removed completely.
