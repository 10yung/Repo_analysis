I forked your project a while back to make a blog for myself and added some extra features. I was thinking that you might benefit from this feature this I built, a way to link together articles into a series.

Take a look at my site for an example. [Robotodos](http://blog.daydevelops.com)

You can select "series" in the navbar to see the available series (only one currently) and select a series to see the articles for that series in reverse chronological order. Also note that when you are viewing an article which is a part of a series, there is a "next article" link in the sidebar to help users progress through the series in the right order.

On the admin dashboard, I added a "series" tab to the left navigation menu. You can view all series available or create a new series. Editing a series will allow you to edit the title, description, add or delete articles to the series, and change the order of the articles via drag-and-drop.

![admin_dash_series](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38594177/68535460-965f8a00-031d-11ea-8411-f1cec35d491a.png)

If you think this is a feature you would like to have, let me know and I can start working on it for you.
Generating optimized autoload files

The environment file is invalid!
Failed to parse dotenv file due to unexpected whitespace. Failed at [PJ Blog].
Script @php artisan package:discover handling the post-autoload-dump event returned with error code 1
when I try to deploy the application on the server I get an error 500.
It seems to have to do with the font numito
