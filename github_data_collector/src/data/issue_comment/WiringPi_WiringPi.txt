add options for cross compiling

## What I did
As I needed to work on this work a 64 bit kernel where `/proc/cpuinfo` was not filled, I changed the function to use `/proc/device-tree`. I could test it on the RPI cm3 compute module in 64 bits and 32 bits. 

## I am not sure about
The "old way" part

WinStar displays (WEH002004ALPP5N00000, WS0010) has multiple char tables and init options for it.
Hello

I think it would be great to use Internal oscillator as well as PLLD source (500MHz) for GPCLK when frequency selection allows it. I also provided a MASH option -not enabled yet- for some future release.

Regards.
At moment there's no way to free a LCD handle. 
Hi,

I found a tiny bug in preventing the update of the sample rate in function myDigitalWrite (data1 instead of data0). The 250 SPS definition was missing too.
Finally, I think it would be cleaner to have the gain definitions (in ads1115.h) consistent with the ADS1115 datasheet.

Check it out,
Roudy
