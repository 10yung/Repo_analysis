please suggest me. 



Background color of forwardingView is being adjusted to blend in with the background color provided by OS so that it can handle touch events. Recent iOS updates have shown to discard the transparent view to be considered for touch handling callbacks.
I'm trying to write a function that checks if the device is an X model, so that it removes the Globe key.  I'm using DeviceGuru, but having problems.  If anyone has a quick solution, let me know please!
I'm making a keyboard with another view that will have some snippets.  I'm starting with just 8, like this:

I'd like to have these buttons behave like the normal keyboard keys do, with their wonderful pop-up behavior and their proper resizing across devices and all that.  So, I figure I should make a subclass, like `class SnippetKey: KeyboardKey`

There's coding wizardry on this keyboard the likes of which are a bit beyond me, so I learn by changing things here and there, guessing, and then actually seeing what it does.  So, I went into `DefaultKeyboard`, and changed the QWERTY row to just three keys, hoping that they'd magically display like my above picture.  They did this:

Any advice would be very much appreciated.  Until then, I'll be poking and prodding the code.  Thanks!
