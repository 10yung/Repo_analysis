Seems like there's some gotchas when it comes to what parts of Rust you use and how large it can cause your wasm output to be.

The current wasm output file size is 88kb before wasm-gc and 71kb after. This has been bugging me for a few days and I haven't looked into it until now.

A basic hello world I created was 17kb before wasm-gc and 103 bytes after which sounds much better.

After disabling some code, i've found a few factors that seem to heavily change the wasm output size.

**Creating a `vec!` causes ~8.5kb of file size.**

I disabled a bunch of code to get down to this point. I haven't recreated a minimal example yet though.


**Indexing a `vec!` by a random number causes an extra 31kb of file size (totaling ~40kb)**
This seems to take up more than half of the final wasm size. If I index the vec by a hard coded number less than the vec's length, the file size remains at ~8.5kb as noted above. But if I hard coded a number >= the vec's length, the file size increases to 40kb too.

I'll post any more findings I have here. Hoping someone can enlighten me on ways to keep the file size down and perhaps as to why indexing a vec costs so much?

i tried cell phone's browser can't get the view of game.
if the mobile browser not supported for wasm?
