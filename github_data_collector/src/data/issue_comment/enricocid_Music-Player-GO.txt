## How to contribute?

I'm opening this issue to ask users to **contribute to translations**. 
This issue will be updated every time new strings will be added. There will be 2 sections:
 - Newly added translations since latest release
 - How to add new translations

## Newly added translations since latest release (4.0.1)

```
 <string name="precise_volume_pref" translatable="false">precise_volume_pref</string>
 <string name="precise_volume_pref_title">Precise volume control</string>
 <string name="precise_volume_pref_summary_on">Disable precise volume control</string>
 <string name="precise_volume_pref_summary_off">Enable precise volume control</string>
```

## How to translate all the strings

1. Download the [strings](https://github.com/enricocid/Music-Player-GO/blob/master/project/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml)

2. Edit it using Your preferred editor

3. Note: do not translate strings containing the _translatable=false_ attribute. Just delete these strings from the file.

4. Send me the file. How?
    - By sending a pull request
    - If you have no idea how to do it just attach the xml here or send it via email specifing the language
    - Don't worry about errors or other shiz, I'm here to assist You if needed

Here is video showing the problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc5-dqmNDg
If you just open the player bar and click on artist name, artist page shows number of his tracks fine. But if you open Folders -> {some_folder} and then open the track and artist's page, number of his tracks is the number of tracks in the folder instead.
Is there any way to sync back the lastplayed timestamp from device to the PC? 
I've been using Vinyl as my music player for a while now, and I'd like to use yours instead as I quite like the new user interface.
I found shuffling my entire library often repeats some songs while almost never playing others, just due to how shuffling works on Android. I get much better variety if I shuffle just the songs I haven't listened to in the past month or so, which was a really nice feature of Vinyl.
This might require keeping a database though, since Android doesn't seem to keep file access timestamps. I haven't written software for Android, so I don't know how difficult that would be.
At the moment I'm most of my folders, the songs seem in any random order.

Add a button to sort by taged track Nr or filename

There should be no gap when the track starts over again (gap-less playback)
My favorite app would become even more fun if it would be able to play ogg vorbis files.
#### Components
The component I want to suggest is an inbuilt equalizer for Music Player Go app


#### Proposal Description
An equalizer which is an electronic equipment that reduces frequency distortion is a necessary component in a music player application. This component allows users to adjust the music to whatever way they want it; rock, jazz, bass blast, etc. A music player without this feature isn't complete at all. After clicking the 'equalizer' option on the Music Player Go app, I found out that there was no equalizer in the app. So, I am suggesting that an inbuilt equalizer should be added to the music app. This equalizer can be designed in any form but should be of good quality which can serve the user appropriately.

#### Mockups / Examples
Below is a mock-up of my suggestion, it is a screenshot from another music player application

#### Benefits
- If implemented, this feature will help users to adjust their music to however way they want it.
- It will also attract more users who are interested in equalizing their music

#### Conclusion 
This component may be a bit common but it is a very important component for a music player application.
I hope the developers can consider adding this component.
