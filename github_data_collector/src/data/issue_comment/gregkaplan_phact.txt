Implicit expansion was introduced in Matlab R2016b. (You can read about it [here](https://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2016/10/24/matlab-arithmetic-expands-in-r2016b/))

This can lead to problems as 

1. MATLABAutoDiff that this toolbox is sitting on top of does not support implicit expansion (yet). It will be address in the future, but in the mean time, one can follow the suggestion given [here](https://github.com/sehyoun/MATLABAutoDiff/issues/2).
2. We proceeded to adapt the new feature (it is just syntactically nicer since you do not have to use bsxfun), so some of the example files might not work with matlab release prior to R2016b. Example files were check to run without a problem with R2015b, but codes will be reviewed to double check.

[Pontus Rendahl](https://sites.google.com/site/pontusrendahl/) pointed out that schur_solver is wrong for discrete time.

The flag for continuous/discrete time remains from earlier, but it is not intended for the current toolbox, and is probably wrong. I will decide whether I will correct it or take it out, but in the mean time, the solver should not be used for discrete time models.
