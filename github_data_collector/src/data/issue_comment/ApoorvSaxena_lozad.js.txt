This PR will allow to picture tag like this.

```
<picture
    class="lozad"
    data-iesrc="https://example.org/foo.jpg">
    <source type="image/webp"
            data-srcset="https://example.org/foo.webp"
            class="lozad" />
    <source type="image/jpeg"
            data-srcset="https://example.org/foo.jpg"
            class="lozad"/>
    <img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,/some_lqip_in_base_64==" />
</picture>
```

With this code, I can use a lazy-loaded `<picture>` tag, with an LQIP and delegate the lazy-load to the `<source>` tags inside the `<picture>` tag
Hi, I've looked at the source and could not find .observe() defined. I may have missed it tho.

However I would ask: is lozad using this? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/observe or just a same name internal function?

Please and thank you
Hi there!

I'm using this plugin in WordPress and everything is working fine. I've created a post carousel (using Glider-JS) including the post-thumbnails. My issue is, that the first image of the carousel won't load and I don't know why. The first image still has the data-src and the loaded class is not added. It also only happens in Chrome. 

I've created a similar pen: [https://jsfiddle.net/42n8pzkc/3/](https://jsfiddle.net/42n8pzkc/3/)
Strangely I can't reproduce the issue here although it has the same JS and HTML.

Do you have any ideas which could be the issue? Thanks in advance!

edit: My WordPress Images have a src="" before lozad initialization. If I use a placeholder instead, everything is working fine. So I guess I should't use a blank src?

replace `append()` and `Object.assign`, so no need to add pollyfils for IE
I have installed lozad.js, but no images are loaded. lozad.js has been installed through npm. 

Hereâ€™s the JS code.

```
const observer = lozad('.lozad', {
  load: function(el) {
    console.log('Loading element');
    console.log(el);
  },
});
observer.observe();
```

And the HTML markup.

`<img class="lozad" data-src="/static/dist/images/sequence/image-name.jpg">`

lozad.js is triggered. I get console logs with the right elements, and `data-loaded="true"` is injected in the appropriate `<img>` tag. But no `src` is injected, no image is loaded.

The `<img>` tag looks like this once lozad.js is triggered.

`<img class="lozad" data-src="/static/dist/images/sequence/image-name.jpg" data-loaded="true">`

I am lost here, any idea?

Link to ParentNode.append() pollyfill with explanation about when it is required was added to the README file. This PR references this issue: https://github.com/ApoorvSaxena/lozad.js/issues/215


Adding Some improvements to documentation.
I'm giving lozad a try after reading your featured CSS Tricks article, and I love it. There's only one issue: it breaks responsive-loader generation of any jpg specified in an HTML file (I'm doing responsive images with data-srcset and data-src as per documentation). CSS background jpg are fine. 

## Expected Behavior
- without lozad everything works fine and responsive-loader creates the responsive images, they turn fine in bundled code

## Current Behavior
- with lozad, only CSS jpg and HTML png work. any other jpg in HTML is a 404 because it won't be generated.

## Possible Solution
- I have no clue sorry

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
- is better to link you to my repo so you can check all the config (master and lozad branches).
https://gitlab.com/gacallea/gentlewashrec
- the master builds fine
- lozad branch has the issue

## Context
- trying to use lazy loading for responsive images

## Tested on:
* Browser Name and version:
- (all latest): chrome, firefox, safari, opera, brave, vivaldi.
* Operating System and version (desktop or mobile):
macOS Mojave (latest patch)

## EDIT:
this responsive-loader https://github.com/herrstucki/responsive-loader
Picture tags are not working in IE11.

## Steps to Reproduce
If you go to demo site https://apoorv.pro/lozad.js/demo/ and scroll to the picture tag example you will see the next error by IE console:
`SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'append'`
`File: lozad.min.js, Line: 9, Column: 323`

## Possible Solution
I solved with the this pollyfill, but there may be better solutions
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ParentNode/append#Polyfill

If you could include in the documentation the best solution for this and solve the problem in the example page it would be great, thank you!
