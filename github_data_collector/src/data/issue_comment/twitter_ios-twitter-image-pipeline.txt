Thanks for sharing TIP!
Looks very very impressive!

Currently, I use [PINRemoteImage](https://github.com/pinterest/PINRemoteImage) in my app (and enjoy it very much!). If I may, I wanted to ask the following:

1. What were the reasons you felt that PINRemoteImage would not be good for the Twitter iOS app?
2. What are the key differences to consider when choosing between both?

Thanks again for sharing this library!
Hi guys! You published this library very conveniently since we just yesterday started seeing problems with our image caching over at Forza Football. Reading your description, they are similar to yours, and everything this library does seems to fit us very well, so we are evaluating it right now.

However, there is one problem that pretty much every image caching library on iOS suffers from - how to handle updated/outdated images. I would like to ask you if it's possible (or how you would solve) an updated image residing on the same URL as before.

For example, if our servers set a `max-age` of 3 days - will the library discard the image after 3 days and request a whole new one, even if it's the same image? We sometimes need to update an image on the same URL, so we can't set a too high max age. But we still would like the HTTP-caching functionalities. Ideally, after 3 days, the library would request the image, and if it gets a `304`, it just keeps the same image in the cache and refreshes the TTL.

Looking at the process you describe in your README, it seems to me that the library will never attempt to refresh an image if it's already in the cache. Is this true?
