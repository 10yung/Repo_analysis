I was using the example you have on testing an EventEmitter and I discovered that my test was passing because the test runner could not find an expectation. Try changing the expect inside the subscription to be something you know will fail (like expect false to equal true) and your test might still come back that it passed.

Maybe I just have something setup incorrectly so I'm sorry if I'm wrong about this but I just wanted to give you a warning.

In angular-2-samples/unit-test-scenarios/event-emitter/event-emitter-spec.ts folder, can you explain the code there?

My understand about your code would be: you called the function sayHello() in the code manually.
1. why don't you use mouse event function like click(). Of course, I don't know if there is such click function exist.
2. why put child.sayHello(); after child.greeting.subscribe()?
3. Can you explain how the done function work here? Is there any other way to handle asyn problem. I have heard that angular2 make it more easier to deal with the problem.
4. When I looked at your blog: http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/viewarticle/angular-2.0-unit-testing. I still have some questions. Can you recommend me some reference to learn Angular2 an Angular2 unit testing?
