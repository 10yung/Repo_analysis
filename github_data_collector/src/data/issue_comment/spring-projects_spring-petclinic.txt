add age form
fix logging status, search ( last name -> first name)


Add using -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments to the notes for how to set up using MySQL.

It seems newer versions of Spring may fork the JVM that runs the webserver, and this causes issues with passing properties like -Dspring.profiles.active. This advises a fix.
Attempting to migrate from maven to gradle build 

Is there any chance that this project would be converted to the Gradle build system? Seems like Gradle is the future and it would really come in handy to see how such a project would utilize it.

I tried converting it but as this is the first real spring project I've dealt with, I cant wrap my head around all the configuration files :)
Spring petclinic previously had a really good [documentation](http://docs.spring.io/docs/petclinic.html) for beginners like me, but it`s outdated now. I have no idea on how it is working ... as it does not have proper documentation. Presentation attached is also very old one.

**_WITHOUT PROPER DOCUMENTATION(README) ITS NOT VERY DEVELOPER AND BEGINNER FRIENDLY._**
This documentation must have all howtos and how is it working in boot app...
Following can be some pointers....
1. Testing(Types of testing done)
2. Profiles
3. Internationalization
4. Validation
5. Explaining package structure.
6. SQL scripts
7. Caching
8. Templates
9. Application Configuration
10. JMX

 
I think documentation must also have a section of what is the difference between legacy spring app and this one: 

Following can be noted differences:

- Previously, app followed **3 layer architecture**, which is now outdated.(Why I don't know)
- Current package structure is also very VERY different, previously all entities were stored in `org.springframework.samples.petclinic.model`.
- Now, all settings are stored in application-* properties.
- Where did many things go.... it seems magic.... 
and so on....

Please make sure the documentation is very detailed like [this](http://docs.spring.io/docs/petclinic.html). but with much more details.
Nowadays the master branch is holding the Spring Boot version of Spring Petclinic, it would be great to update the presentation referenced by the readme.md:
