i´m having this problem when i try to use `<Select /> `
i tried put the key in object ... ex: 
 ``
`const test = [ { id: 1, name: Carlos, key: 01 }, {id: 2,  name: Maria, key: 02 } ] `
 doesn´t work

tried put in Select 

`<Select key={test.id} options={test} /> `
 doesn´t work

what i have to do to solve this problem?"`
**What would you like to be added**:

Provide Yup field information to component.

**Why is this needed**:

Since we are able to define a Yup schema in the `Form` component, it would be nice to use that information not only for validations, but also to render my input components. For example, if I mark a field as [required](https://github.com/jquense/yup#mixedrequiredmessage-string--function-schema) in the schema, the component could use that data to render a required indicator. Same applies to other things, ie. [label](https://github.com/jquense/yup#mixedlabellabel-string-schema). 

**Is your enhancement request related to a problem? Please describe.**

I don't like to pass props like `label`, `required` and `maxLength` to form components if I already have a schema definition that describes the expected behaviour of the Form.

**Additional context**

Also had the same issue with [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik):

- jaredpalmer/formik#1241
- jaredpalmer/formik#712

<!-- If possible complete *all* sections as described. Don't remove any section. -->

**Description of bug**

Error when creating a submit function for the form:

Type 'SubmitHandler<DataContent>' is not assignable to type 'SubmitHandler<FormContent>'.
  Type 'FormContent' is missing the following properties from type 'DataContent': email, passwordts(2322)

**To Reproduce**

Create a page with Form Element and SubmitHandler function in the same file:

Example:
```
...
const handleSubmit:SubmitHandler<DataContent> = (data) => {
    dispatch(signInRequest(data));
  };

  return (
    <>
         <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
...

```

**Expected behavior**

It shouldn't raise any error

**Exception or Error**

Type 'SubmitHandler<DataContent>' is not assignable to type 'SubmitHandler<FormContent>'.
  Type 'FormContent' is missing the following properties from type 'DataContent': email, password  TS2322



**Environment:**

O.S Ubuntu 19.0.4
Node v 12.13

 - Browser [e.g. Chrome (69.0.3472.3), Firefox (62.0.3)]
 - Node [e.g 8.9.1]
 - Etc
-->

**Additional context**

It worked when I changed the Form.tsx to:

```
export interface FormProps<T> extends Omit<HTMLFormProps, 'onSubmit'> {
    initialData?: object;
    children: React.ReactNode;
    context?: Context;
    schema?: ObjectSchema<object>;
    onSubmit: SubmitHandler<T>;
}
```

**What would you like to be added**:

Is there an idea to integrate with MAterial-UI library

**Why is this needed**:

<!-- A clear and concise description of why is it needed. -->
Since MAterial-UI is now widely used, it would be great to integrate this library with material-ui.
**Is your enhancement request related to a problem? Please describe.**

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->

**Additional context**

<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the enhancement request here. -->

**Description of issue**

So many times I faced form not been submitted when using Schema because I made a mistake with field names or something like that. Is there any way to catch all the Yup errors in the Form component?

**Usage example**

```jsx
export default MyForm() {
  return (
    <Form onError={errors => console.log(errors)} schema={schema} /> 
  );
}
```

**UPDATE**
It also could be a debug flag, that prints in the console a message with all validation errors.
```jsx
<Form schema={schema} debug />
```
**What would you like to be added**:

Some sort of render props support for all basic field types to customize their rendering without having to deal with all of that `registerField()` boilerplate in custom components.

**Why is this needed**:

I'm using [`react-bootstrap` forms](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.com/components/forms/#forms) and as you may know, Bootstrap requires some wrapping for e.g. good-looking checkboxes.

Unform's [rendering of checkboxes](https://github.com/Rocketseat/unform/blob/cd0367c6cda74c3595f025374f4839b57570afef/lib/components/Check.tsx#L42-L50) doesn't quite cut it, but having a render prop would make it pretty simple to fix, and the refactoring isn't honestly very complicated either.

Just refactoring the final rendering bits out of each component into a function that returns react nodes (i.e. a render prop function), and allowing passing it as a prop to the component should be enough.

If this sounds sane, I could do the dev legwork.

When I click on an input and make a change, the value is fixed to the 'value' attribute.
