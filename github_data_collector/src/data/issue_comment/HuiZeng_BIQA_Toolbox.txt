Hello,wonderful u!

I want to train the model on the LIVE dataset and test on TID2013. However,they have different label.(dmos for LIVE,mos for TID2013). I noticed that some articles will give that:

"A nonlinear mapping based on a logistic function(always applied to FR measures) is applied for transforming the quality measure into a certain range.We randomly split the TID2013 into 80% and 20%, 80% is used for estimating parameters of the logistic function and 20% for testing the transformed prediction scores."
So I find the FR measures transform method in http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/linzhang/IQA/IQA.htm


However,when I use the above method, the test results SROCC is so low and so different with the other cross dataset test results. I want to ask if you know the certain method of transforming  DMOS to MOS? or any advice for me? Thank you very much!!!
