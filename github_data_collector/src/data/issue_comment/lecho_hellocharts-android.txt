Hello ... I don't know if it's a problem, but when I have equal Y-axis values ​​on my line chart, it just doesn't show anything on the chart.
See example below

 List<PointValue> values = new ArrayList<PointValue>();
   values.add(new PointValue(0, 2));
   values.add(new PointValue(1, 2));
   values.add(new PointValue(2, 2));
   values.add(new PointValue(3, 2));
Hi, 
I set the label of a point visible only if the point is selected and works fine. I'd like to know if it is possible select the point from the Java code (to associate it with another button on click for example) and not only tapping on the specific point
Thanks and Congratulations on this beautiful library!
Hello,
Is there any option to start the graph from (1,1) rather than (0,0). I want my X and Y values to be minimum 1 not 0. 

Please help me out. 
The bubble's radius will now scale to the appropriate value even if
viewport calculation is disabled.

This addresses issue #400

You can set isValueBackgroundLabelEnabled = false, but this ruins the alignment of the labels.
isValueLabelBackgroundAuto doesn't apply the slightly darker color, instead it applies a dark gray.
valueLabelBackgroundColor does nothing
Is it possible to have zoom event detection? 
I would need it because I want to show points on my graph, when zoom is increased.
Can you also get the number of visible points/values on graph?
I've tried to change the size doing : valueTableTextSize() but looks like it's not changing, is there any way to change the size or do it a little bit bigger?
Also tried doing :

```
columnData!!.axisYLeft = Axis()
.setHasLines(true)
.setAutoGenerated(true)
.setValues(example)
.setTextColor(Color.BLACK)
.setTextSize(20)
```

But it doesn't work.
