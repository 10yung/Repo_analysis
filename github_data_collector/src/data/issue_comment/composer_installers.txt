Here is an extract of my composer.json:

```
{
   ...
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "https://packages.drupal.org/8"
        },
        {
            "type": "package",
            "package": {
                "name": "ckeditorplugin/codesnippet",
                "type": "drupal-library",
                "version": "master",
                "dist": {
                    "type": "zip",
                    "url": "https://download.ckeditor.com/codesnippet/releases/codesnippet_4.5.11.zip",
                    "reference": "master"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "package",
            "package": {
                "name": "harvesthq/chosen",
                "type": "drupal-library",
                "version": "master",
                "dist": {
                    "type": "zip",
                    "url": "https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/releases/download/v1.8.7/chosen_v1.8.7.zip",
                    "reference": "master"
                }
            }
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "ckeditorplugin/codesnippet": "master",
        "harvesthq/chosen": "^1.6",
...
    },
    "extra": {
        "installer-paths": {
...
            "web/libraries/{$name}": [
                "type:drupal-library"
            ],
        },
    }
}
```

Expectation: both libraries should be installed in `web/libraries` but only codesnippet lands there and the chosen library goes into the `vendor` directory. I guess this is because that library comes with a composer.json which declares the type as library which seems to overwrite my type drupal-library.

I've then tried to add `"harvesthq/chosen"` to extra / installer-paths / web/libraries array but that made no difference.

My question is: how do I get the chosen library into the web/libraries path?
Hello,

Composer supports overriding the vendor location using `vendor-dir`.
There is no equivalent for packages handled by `composer/installers` so everything goes to the folders specified in 'installer-paths`.

I recently made a tiny wrapper here: https://github.com/vever001/composer-installers-dir
Which, as stated, can be useful in many cases like building the project to another directory for a production release.

Would you be open to accept this feature inside `composer/installers`?
If so let me know and I will work on it.

Thank you
With Craft 3, plugins added via composer live in /vendor, not `/craft/plugins` so some installs are failing. This change for Craft 3 users will clear the problem up.

I am attempting to install on a Vagrant 2.2.4 VM running Ubuntu/bionic64 (Windows 10 Pro host machine). Other packages install fine, but this one returns "Plugin installation failed," attempts to roll back, and then fails to delete the contents of its installation directory.
