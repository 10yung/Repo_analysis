Resolved deprecation error in datamatrix.php: "Deprecated: Array and string offset access syntax with curly braces is deprecated"
How can i call SetAutoPageBreak() in the Footer method?

The problem i have is that i can have a dynamic height to the footer and i can only obtain that height in the Footer() method. In this case i can't set the AutoPageBreak because the footer is called after the body method.

Is there any workaround this?
Thank you

If we use transforms and a page is ending inside a transformed part, the transformation is applied to the footer, but seems to be stopped afterwards, so it doesn't continue on the next page.

Simplified code example:
```php
// Start transform
$pdf->StartTransform();
$pdf->Rotate(15);

// Output some multi-line text that causes a page break.
$pdf->writeHTMLCell(0, 0, '', 260, $html, 0, 1, 0, true, '', true); // <-- Page break within here

// Stop transform
$pdf->StopTransform();
```
See the [slightly changed version of example001.php here](https://gist.github.com/Harmageddon/a6e7a7e09fd0e06984ba46d08a7d3db3). This results in a PDF like 
[example_001.pdf](https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF/files/4023525/example_001.pdf). You see that there is a rotated text at the end of page 1. The footer is rotated along with the text (but shouldn't be, because it has no own rotation). The second part of the text on page 2 instead is not rotated at all (but should be, because it's inside the transformation).

Is there any way to save the whole transformation stack before printing the footer and restoring it afterwards?
hello after updating to tcpdf 6.3.2 i get warning on method tcpdf.php line 7801 with message " unlink(..\..\...\temp/__tcpdf_393737b5201efd77eec80f86fca55b63_imgmask_alpha_af7077161af0ed4509f4b792149d0a9a)" No such file or directory

after commenting out that line, the issue gone....
i hope theres a better fix for this
hello,

we have a serious issue since the update to version 6.3.0. we have two static images that we include in the header. when the pdf is rendered they are deleted from the filesystem. so every new pdf does not have these files anymore. i tracked this down to this commit: https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF/commit/b41a5ca3114c18214ec2871fb68923e6d7bb9e92

the images are added in this way:

    $this->resourceDirectory = getcwd() . '/data/content/';
    $this->Image($this->resourceDirectory . 'image.png', 371, 60, 164, 60, '', '', 'T');

and then in _destroy() they are deleted from the filesystem. how can we avoid the deletion of these files?
I noticed an odd behavior of `MultiCell`s in transformations (especially scaling). It doesn't occur in `Cell`s, but I suppose it might occur as well in other elements that are modified to fit the page dimensions.
Within a down-scaled part of the document, positions such as (230, 50) are still visible on a standard A4 page, because the dimensions get scaled down according to the transformation. However, TCPDF seems to force elements into the 210mm width of an A4 page, without scaling this page dimension or the margins. I modified example_013 from the documentation to illustrate my case, the code can be seen [here](https://gist.github.com/Harmageddon/3d95cc38ce4173d9be2119d7e20b156e). The resulting PDF is 
[example_013.pdf](https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF/files/3992548/example_013.pdf)


Tested with TCPDF 6.2.11, 6.2.26 and `master` branch at 9fde7bb (6.3.2).

Has anyone else encountered a similar behaviour with TCPDF and has an idea how to solve this? I have debugged this for some time now and suspect that it has something to do with the position and width calculations inside `MultiCell`, but I'm not sure how exactly this can be fixed.
I've an tinymce editor on my PHP webapp to save "precompiled" content (text/images).

I've saved an old entry with some text and a image link. This is the HTML view of tinymce editor.

    <p>This is an image</p>
    <img src="http://mywebapp.com/files/image_1.jpg" />

Then a button named "Create PDF and SEND"...create the A4 pdf version of my tinymce content (using TCPDF) and send via email.

All ok when my app was on http. Now we migrated to http**s** and when i generate PDF, image disappear from PDF....i need to manually change (in html view of tinymce editor textarea):

    <img src="http://mywebapp.com/files/image_1.jpg" />

to:

    <img src="https://mywebapp.com/files/image_1.jpg" />

adding **s** to src. there is a solution to fix this problem on TCPDF?
Hello,

I am using TCPDF for generating form field PDF dynamically. We have long text options (i.e. "Feed water introduced through openings or connection used for relief, water column or water level gauge glass on cast iron boiler") in database and its **not wrapping** in select box in PDF. Another issue is its **adding white space** at the end of options text. If you have option like "Option 1" (8 character) then its adding 8 white space.

I have tried same code from this example https://tcpdf.org/examples/example_054/ and just added more text to select box options and its not working too. Please find attached PDF and see "Select2" for what I am talking about.
[example_054.pdf](https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF/files/3968233/example_054.pdf)

Waiting for solution because due to this we are stuck.

Thanks in advance.
As in subject. All versions prior to 6.2.21 are not affected.
From 6.2.22 when you use the same image many times in your pdf only first appearance is supported properly. All following links to the same image are not visible/broken.
In my opinion code from TCPDF::_destroy() should not always delete images stored in cache located at K_PATH_CACHE setting. If you need more info please let me know.
