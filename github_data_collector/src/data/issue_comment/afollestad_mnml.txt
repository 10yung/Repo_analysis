Great app looks like Google's homegrown apps.Also a dark mode and a separate black theme would be great

**Describe the Bug:**

Hi, just using this to record the screen on my Chromebook Pixel and the video is squashed.  Res says 1700x2560.  Should probably be the other way around?

This is probably due to the app not supporting landscape mode?
It would be nice if F-Droid integration could be made but it seems that [you don't want to have it integrated into F-Droid(?)](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues/860#note_168609285)

So I guess it would be nice to add at least a note on the readme why this is the case (and maybe add some F-Droid alternatives like [ScreenCam](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.orpheusdroid.screenrecorder/)).

This way people relying on [F-Droid](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=screen+recorder&lang=en) will be happy, too. :wink: 

Thank you in advance and also thank you in case you change your mind!

:pray:

**Describe the Bug:**

Screen isn't recording

**To Reproduce:**
1.

2. 
3. 

**Expected Behavior:**

Nothing, While I was started to recording. It send me a error message "MNML was unable to prepare for recording. prepare failed". I don't know why, I'd hidden my device's display cutout. Maybe that's why.



**App Version:**

1.0.13
 
**Affected Device(s):**
 
Google Pixel 3 XL with Android 10.0 (Same was with Android 9.0)
 
**Describe the Bug:**

When a video is being recorded horizontally, the result has some problems with the orientation, which you can see here: https://youtu.be/HbjhARgaGLw 
 
**To Reproduce:**
1. Rotate your device into horizontal position.
2. Record a video.
3. Watch it.

**Expected Behavior:**

Recorded video must be the same orientation as it was recorded.

So the app isn't crashing on me but even if I force stop the app, restrict battery, and turn off mobile data in background, I see a MNML sending to CrashAlytics item in my internet traffic every once in a while.

I cannot find any evidence the app is crashing unless you need a different wide bug report or something

I wonder if it's the QuickTile keeping something alive?

I just want to know why it wants to send a log out to the CrashAlytics server SO OFTEN (I don't care that it does I understand why it does for data to improve)
After recording when I click on ðŸ›‘ button the recording would stop but the button doesn't change state or toggle back to record shape and background color.

**To Reproduce:**

2. Launch Google assistant. 

**Expected Behavior:**
I was expecting to record my phone using Google assistant for testing and tutorials. 
I am willing to provide more infos to fix the issue .

Thanks . 
I have a gaming phone (Razer's Phone 2) capable of 120 frames per second. Other gaming phones are coming out now with 90 FPS. I was hoping it would not be too much trouble to record at these framerates (at least 90).

If this is unfeasible or unwise, I'm understanding so please let me know. :) Thanks
