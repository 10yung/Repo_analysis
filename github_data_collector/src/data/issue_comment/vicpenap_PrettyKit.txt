Xcode 6, iOS 8, using PrettyTableViewCell and the app is crashing related to KVO on line 481 -
any idea?

```
- (void) observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context 
{
    if ([keyPath isEqualToString:@"frame"]) 
    {        
        UIView *contentView = (UIView *) object;
        CGRect originalFrame = contentView.frame;

        float shadowMargin = [self shadowMargin];

        float y = contentView_margin;
        switch (self.position) {
            case PrettyTableViewCellPositionTop:
            case PrettyTableViewCellPositionAlone:
                y += shadowMargin;
                break;
            default:
                break;
        }
        float diffY = y - originalFrame.origin.y;

        if (diffY != 0)
        {
            CGRect rect = CGRectMake(originalFrame.origin.x+shadowMargin,
                                     originalFrame.origin.y+diffY,
                                     originalFrame.size.width - shadowMargin*2,
                                     originalFrame.size.height- contentView_margin*2 - [PrettyTableViewCell neededHeightForPosition:self.position tableStyle:_tableViewStyle]);
            contentView.frame = rect; // --> crash here!
        }
    }
}
```

Fixed support for cell instantiation from storyboard.

Hey,

I've added 'Install app' button into your README file. Anyone could try your sample application right in browser. Look how it's working!

Hello everyone,

I use PrettyKit in one of my apps at the App Store. I have 500 active users and the app crash by some people (iPad 2, 3, 4 / iOS 5.1.1 - iOS 6.1.3). 

0x00082903 -[PrettyTableViewCellBackground drawRect:](PrettyTableViewCell.m:317)

Has everyone else the problem? I can't simulate the problem on my test devices.

I've got a custom PrettyKitTableViewCell subclass which I'm trying to get a dropshadow on (grouped table view) and when i set the dropsShadow property to YES in cellForRowAtIndexPath no shadow is created.  I'm still relatively new to iOS, so i'm just wondering if anyone can suggest some things I should check that I may have missed?

This is an iOS 5 - 6 app btw, using the latest version for download from this repo.

Thanks 

Hi vicpenap,
I actually planned to send you a private message but I did not find any way to do this so Im writing this post.

I am starting a new iOS application and I think PrettyKit is what i need for my application. My application requires animated insertion and deletion operations but PrettyKit is not support those operation as I see. I would love to make required enchantment on PrettyKit but my enchantments are changing usage of the PrettyKit a little bit.

Usage Changes;
1- User of this library will not need to call "prepareForTableView: indexPath:" method of PrettyTableViewCell under "tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:" method of UITableViewDelegate.
2- User needs to use a class named PrettyTableView instead UITableView

Enchantments;
1- PrettyKit will support adding and deleting cells with animation. (Corners of cells will animate like native UITableViewCell class).
2- PrettyCells can be designed in interfaceBuilder. (Their appearance will not be able to edited in interfaceBuilder but their content will be).

If you are okay with these changes I will upload my changes with their documentation soon.

I was trying to get the library working with EZForms which uses interface builder static cells in their examples to create forms with TableViews.

I could not get pretty kit to work this way so i made the following cateogry and setup the view in -willDisplayCell

This is not an issue but can you add a new cell that has a textfield with a label. I made a custom cell with the norma UITableView but i would like to use your code. I can't add the label + Textfield in your cell. I've tried a few thing.

ps. I don't care for the performance issue.

Thanks,

The vertical shadow on the left of a grouped 'middle' PrettyTableViewCell is not consistent. It seems to be slightly rounded, as seen in this screenshot from the example app (with the background changed to white):

It is less noticeable on the right side:

This is pretty small but still noticeable.

Setting a table and the cells background colors to transparent shows some ugly separators in between the cells. For some reason there is space between each cell, and a UIView in between each with a pixel height of 1.
