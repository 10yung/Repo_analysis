I have installed FengNiao. When I try to run the command I am getting the following error
    my OSX version is 10.15.1 (19B88)          
```
This copy of libswiftCore.dylib requires an OS version prior to 10.14.4.
zsh: abort      fengniao

```
Hi,

I don't have access to install this in /usr/local/bin, is there any other solution to perform with this tool FengNiao

执行./install.sh保存
localhost:FengNiao test01$ ./install.sh
error: product dependency 'CommandLineKit' not found
error: product dependency 'CommandLineKit' not found
cp: .build/release/FengNiao: No such file or directory
不知道要怎么解决
组件化工程该如何遍历呢,我尝试遍历我们组件project,发现无法遍历出来,bundle中其实有未使用的代码的


For example , I have a image named 'Landscape@2x.png' , and another 'Landscape~ipad@2x.png'.
It will delete the last one.
Currently, you have to supply exclude paths via inline arguments `fengniao --exclude Pods`. However, in situations when your app displays assets based on image names returned by API you will want to exclude a lot of files/paths.

It will be handy to have an `.ignore` like file similar to `.gitignore` so that each time I run `fengniao` I won't need to remember which files I need to exclude.

This file could be called `.fengniaoignore` and be structured similarly to `.gitignore`. 

Let me know what you think about it and I can make a PR for it.

Thanks for the handy utility! 
When using FengNiao via command line mode, I would have a --verbose argument in order to see what file/resource is currently scanning.
喵神，使用宏引入的图片名也会遍历出来（其实当前也会使用）。
