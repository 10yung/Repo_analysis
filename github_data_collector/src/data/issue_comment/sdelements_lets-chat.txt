I'm trying to upload my cert for my website in Python and I got the error. I use Heroku's free dyno for my hosting.
files.vagrantup.com redirects to hashicorp-files.hashicorp.com which is [no longer active](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/9847). 

The preferred way to access boxes is to refer to them with their [shorthand name](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/boxes.html).
hi,i install let chat on my server
when i want start it with `npm start` i see this error:
`
Error:csp must have at least one directive under the "directives" key
`
I am interested to install Lets chat and put it in each of my  employees computer.   But I only want the communication to be between me and my employees.  I don't want my employees to be able to use Lets chat to communicate among themselves. 

I want to setup Lets chat to be my private chat to my employees.  Is this possible to setup in the configuration in the server.
There is no documentation regarding IPv6 support for let's chat. Specifically how does one specify an IPv6 listen address? By default it appears that let's chat doesn't listen on IPv6 addresses on the HTTP interface but I could be wrong. The default should be changed to listen on all addresses IPv6/IPv4.

I would be more than happy to issue a PR documenting how to specify an IPv6 address if someone can provide me with the proper syntax.

Thanks
