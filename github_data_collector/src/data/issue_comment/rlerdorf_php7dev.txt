Hi,
I wanted to use the same installation for multiple site projects. 
Is there a way to do that or do I have to install a separate instance.

Thanks
When I add a "host" and "to" values to the "sites" section of  php7dev.yaml it creates a configuration file for nginx but not Apache. I'm running the following commands in customize.sh:

```
sudo service nginx stop
sudo apachectl start
newphp 71
```
Is there a way to automatically create an Apache site? Or have I missed something in my setup?
How can I assign a default bridge interface? I added the following line to the Vagrant file:
**config.vm.network "public_network", bridge: 'en2: Wi-Fi (AirPort)'**

 but when it boots up it still asks me for the interface to bridge to:

Relatedly, the Atlas-hosted image doesn't have the latest versions of makephp/newphp in /usr/local/bin. Could it be updated so the more plug-and-play type users are working with the right code?

For this update to work, there will need to be a /etc/php72 directory added with relevant ini files.

According to a documentation, there should be a phpext script to enable/disable PHP extensions:

> And a second helper script, phpext enables or disables an extension for the current version of PHP.

But looks like it's not included in the repository.

https://github.com/rlerdorf/php7dev/search?q=filename%3Aphpext returns 0 results.

The reason behind this issue might be an unavaiable version of the box (1.0.0). When I try to add this version to vagrant, I receive the following message:

> The box you're attempting to add has no available version that
> matches the constraints you requested. Please double-check your

> that the provider you wish to use is available for these constriants.

> Box: rasmus/php7dev
> Address: https://atlas.hashicorp.com/rasmus/php7dev
> Constraints: 1.0.0
> Available versions: 0.0.1, 0.0.2, 0.0.3, 0.0.4, 0.0.5, 0.0.6, 0.0.7, 0.0.8, 0.0.9, 0.1.0

Added more options for the shared folders to allow setting owner/group/permissions on files/folders.

I needed to add this to my local VM to make a Symfony project to work in a shared folder, so did a PR in case it's useful for someone else - I have my project in my computer at `~/Projects/my-project`, and I sync it to the VM at `/var/www/my-project`.

With this change, you can have this in your `php7dev.yaml`:

```
folders:
    - map: /Users/me/Projects/my-project
      to: /var/www/my-project
      owner: www-data
      group: vagrant
      mount_options: [dmode=775, fmode=664]
```

The tests I did were just checking that when you add the options, they get applied, and when you don't, the defaults are applied. If you provide invalid values, it gets stuck for a while when trying to mount the shared folders and then fails, but the VM is created anyway.

Note: didn't add the parameters commented out to the `php7dev.yaml` file, because I saw the `type` option is usable and it's not in that file, so I did the same.

I am getting the following error: Can you please help ?
