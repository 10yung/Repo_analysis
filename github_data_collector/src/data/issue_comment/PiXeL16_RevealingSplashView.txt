I got an issue with heartBeat animation.
My code is this:

The HeartBeat isn't stopping to beat, I've tried several times with .heartAttack = true or with the finishHeartBeatAnimation() but its not working properly.


Please update to swift 5

Can I add loading indicator  before revealingSplashView.startAnimation() is called ? I am using RevealingSplashView when fetching data from Internet, I am using twitter style. but unfortunately if the request time is to long it will make the like freezing. so can I add something like UIActivityIndicatorView below the logo or somewhere else in RevealingSplashView?

I am new in programming I am sorry if this is trivial
 - bump version
 - bump `.swift-version`
 - update podspec
 - update Podfile
 - update project to recommended settings
 - convert framework to Swift 5
 - convert sample to Swift 5
 - fix warnings

```
$ pod lib lint

 -> RevealingSplashView (0.8.0)
    - NOTE  | xcodebuild:  note: Using new build system
    - NOTE  | [iOS] xcodebuild:  note: Planning build
    - NOTE  | [iOS] xcodebuild:  note: Constructing build description

RevealingSplashView passed validation.
```
I would like to make the transition slower .
How can i control the time of the transition of the splash view ??
