a just fix some issues to run fine with new version of sinatra


It would be great if you could build a new gem version and push it out to rubygems, so we dont have to point our Gemfile to master on the github repo.

This causes a "TypeError: can't convert nil into String" when you just
try to do something like curl -X POST http://mycijoe/

See issue #65

Hi is there any reason why the errors aren't shown in the json? 

I've added it locally shall i do a pull request?

When I run CIJoe with Sinatra 1.2.7, I'm getting this:

```
:public is no longer used to avoid overloading Module#public, use :public_folder instead
    from /home/ethan/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290@fhsclock/gems/cijoe-0.9.2/lib/cijoe/server.rb:12:in `<class:Server>'
/home/ethan/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290@fhsclock/bin/cijoe:19: stack level too deep (SystemStackError)
```

The first error is easily fixable, but I'm not sure what the deal is with the SystemStackError.

I was having some trouble getting the Campfire notifications going (see: https://github.com/defunkt/cijoe/issues/73), so decided to write my own stop-gap notifications using the example ruby code 37Signals provide & the build-worked / build-failed git hooks.

I can get these to run fine when calling from the command line, but they fail when being called by cijoe.
I thought it might be that it didn't like running ruby scripts (although I would have thought it should respect the shebang?), so I switched for simple shell scripts (echo a string to file), but still no dice.

Both the ruby script & the shell script run fine from the command line, but don't seem to get called under cijoe.

I'm running Ubuntu 11.04, so not sure if this might be related to https://github.com/defunkt/cijoe/pull/69 ?

I can't seem to get the campfire notifications going.
I set the campfire settings in the .git/config, as per the docs, but when I run I get "Please check your campfire config for /path/to/project."

I've tried quoting values, using the campfire room number rather than the room name, and playing with the SSL option, but nothing helped.
Is there somewhere I can debug the issue? All I get back from WEBrick is the above message & there's nothing useful in the .git/builds/latest.

I experienced some difficulties while trying to start the cijoe server on my local machine (OS X). The set call on line `103` got stuck in recursion. This could be solved by passing the third parameter named `ignore_setter`.
