**What is the purpose of this Pull Request?**

This is an analysis (take 1) to start the conversation to understand how Twitter API suspension might have impacted Rosie's level of engagement.

**What was done to achieve this purpose?**

I used time series analysis, particularly an autoregressive model.

**How to test if it really works?**

An overview of the methodology would be a good start.

**Who can help reviewing it?**

**TODO**
This is just a template to help you make your point clear with this PR. :)

**What is the purpose of this Pull Request?**

Newcomers might choose one of those three options, not all of them. That is why the options should be reorganized.


**What was done to achieve this purpose?**

Added some "or".


**How to test if it really works?**

It is just how it is documented, not how it works.


**Who can help reviewing it?**

Anyone. Btw I believe we could hear from users if it is understandable.


**TODO**

Drink two liters of water a day. :)
We must consider this repo will receive newcomers from different background. Some with experience on Git and GitHub; some who has never opened Terminal/Command Prompt.

Considering this, I thought it would be nice to have a guide divided into chapters instead of a simple `README.md` -- chapters teaching how to install and use Git and GitHub, `serenata_toolbox`, Jupyter etc. And `README.md` would be the index.

I could provide this. 

What do you guys think?
**What is the problem?** 

As this repo is designed to assist either collaborators with experience in Python or newcomers, it is advised to have a version of Serenata's datasets which do not need Docker.

**How can this be addressed?**

Create a script to download, clean and translate datasets without Docker. Perhaps we could use Serenata's old version of doing it -- the version in which Docker was not required.

**Who could help with this issue?**

I can develop this, bit I believe it is already done if we get that old version script.

**Labels**

Enhancement.

Roadmap:
- [x]  running the jupyter server without docker
- [ ] running everything with docker

Nice to have:
- [ ] running with _conda_ (as suggested by @willianpaixao [here](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/notebooks/issues/3#issuecomment-433603488))

Today to run with docker you can either:
```
$ docker-compose up
```
or something like:
```
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $PWD:/notebooks -v $PWD/data:/notebooks/data okbr/serenata-notebooks jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser --allow-root
```

would be nice to have this documented
