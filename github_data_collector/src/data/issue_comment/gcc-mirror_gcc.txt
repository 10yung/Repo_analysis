make gate_tm_init more robust and avoid this bug:
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=87162


Accept braces (cases 12 and 13)

__visit_invoke can call __get directly, since the fact it was called means each variant has the correct index.
The file dump-parse-tree.c in gfortran is intended for use in debugging and documenting the gfc_code and gfc_expr data structures generated by the gfortran front-end. However it does not do so in an unambiguous manner because indenting is inconsistent, blank common is missing, format statements contain missing information, and keywords can be mistaken for identifiers and sundry problems such as '-' in keywords. This patch is intended to address those problems and dump the structures to the standard where it may be machine read and used as the basis of a tool for modernization of Fortran code or conversion between language source codes.

Testing:
The patch has no influence on the core of gcc. It only affects the Fortran front end when -fdump-parse-tree is specified. The output format may be tested using the package:
https://github.com/jrrk/dpt-parser.git

This patch was applied to the gcc-7-branch. The trunk was not building correctly at the time this patch was prepared.
