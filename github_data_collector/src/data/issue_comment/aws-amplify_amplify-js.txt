Auth.currentCredentials() shows correct identityPoolId but when I try to publish or subscribe it throws the error
```
TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating '_a.identityPoolId')]
- node_modules/@aws-amplify/pubsub/node_modules/@aws-amplify/core/lib/Credentials.js:193:12 in __awaiter$argument_3
- node_modules/@aws-amplify/pubsub/node_modules/@aws-amplify/core/lib/Credentials.js:41:31 in step
- node_modules/@aws-amplify/pubsub/node_modules/@aws-amplify/core/lib/Credentials.js:17:100 in rejected
```

I was working on a project from scratch and had simply added default auth config with phone number as username, nothing custom. I didn't implement the signUp confirmation yet so I manually verified the test user from AWS console.


**Expected behavior**
SignIn works perfectly so it's expected that pubsub would also work correctly given the right permissions are set.

** Which Category is your question related to? **
Authentication
** What AWS Services are you utilizing? **
Cognito
** Provide additional details e.g. code snippets **

It looks the URL used to launch the federated OAuth flow is hardcoded with `http`
https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/blob/9fc0e596/packages/auth/src/OAuth/OAuth.ts#L91

It would be a more ideal UX to open the FB app directly to complete the auth flow if the user has it installed, instead of going through a mobile browser. If we were able to supply the protocol, we could utilize FB deep links to complete the auth flow in the app.
** Which Category is your question related to? **
 Storage.
** What AWS Services are you utilizing? **
Cognito, Auth, Storage.

I am using aws amplify Auth and storage in web application. I am using Storage.get to download a file from S3 bucket. How to track progress of the download?
**Describe the bug**
We are seeing random fails when connecting to a subscription. There are no errors, looking at Chrome dev tools WS socket, it looks like the socket connects, but no data/messages are sent back.

The subscription is a standard subscription to GraphQL.

**To Reproduce**
I'm afraid this one is somewhat hard to reproduce. We are using the very latest version of `amplify-js` and the most recent changes to subscriptions in the library has not changed anything in relation to this.

I know this does not make it easy to debug on, but my hope is to get pointers on how to track any message sent back and use that to better understand when the socket fails. I have studied the source code and cannot find anything in there that was helpful (probably due to my lack of understanding the related code) but we do have `error` configured, though as mentioned, no error is thrown.

Maybe others have seen similar behavior?

**Expected behavior**
That the library connects without issues and at least throws an error if it does not have a stable connection so that we can attempt to re-connect.

**Update:**
I was able to catch messages sent in the console when this happened again.

1. The client sends the GraphQL query to start the subscription.

![Broken subscription](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/467330/72658679-3ff87280-3982-11ea-97a4-a529654c1363.png)

2. The client receives `start_ack` and after that silence.

Nothing is changed in the code for things to break. The component is otherwise stable and this is just happening randomly once in n times. This happens across all our components and for multiple users. We feel like it was more stable in the past, but we can't say as this is as mention hard to monitor on.
_Description of changes:_
- `amplify-authenticator` first pass data-test attributes
- Clean up constants to gain parody with legacy UI libs
- Clean up css variables for input styles

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Integrating Step Functions is not currently supported, but is something I find myself using

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would love it if Step Functions were to become officially supported to be provisioned and given access in the Amplify CLI.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I'm currently manually integrating the CloudFormation behind the scenes, or alternately using Terraform as a completely separate side application which then gets called from Amplify Apps.

**Additional context**
AWS Step Functions is a very powerful solution for a lot of backend processes that I have behind the apps I write. To be able to natively use it in Amplify would be such a big time saver. Looks like the CloudFormation itself for it is pretty easy, but using Lambdas in the state machine is something I'm still figuring out and I'm guessing is the more difficult implementation blocker to overcome.
**Describe the bug**
I recently updated my aws-amplify version to the latest (2.2.2) and now all my tests are failing with the error `ReferenceError: document is not defined`. The issue seems to be with the `@aws-amplify/analytics` package. A workaround for the time being is to add a resolution in my package.json to resolve the analytics package to an older version (pre version 2.x.x) seems to work.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1) run `yarn add aws-amplify` in your React Native app
2) run `yarn test`
3) Get error about document not being defined.

**Expected behavior**
Expect the analytics package to be able to correctly determine that the tests aren't being run in a browser and handle accordingly.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Describe the bug**
I use React Native. And I want to use Push Notifications. But I get errors. 

**To Reproduce**
0. I'm trying to configure Android. React Native ver: "~0.61.4"
1. Start with:
```
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
amplify configure
```
2. I use Expo Bare Workflow.
`yarn add aws-amplify aws-amplify-react-native`
3. Run:
`amplify init `
4. Setup Analytics:
```
amplify add analytics
amplify push
```
5. Setup Push:
```
yarn add @aws-amplify/pushnotification
react-native link @aws-amplify/pushnotification
amplify add notifications
amplify push
```
6. And add to android/build.gradle:
```
 dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.3.0'
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.2.0'
}
```
7. Also update maven url as the following under allprojects> repositories.
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven {
            // All of React Native (JS, Obj-C sources, Android binaries) is installed from npm
            url "$rootDir/../node_modules/react-native/android"
        }
        maven {
            url "https://maven.google.com"
        }
    }
}
```
8. And add to android/app/build.gradle
```
dependencies {
    implementation project(':@aws-amplify_pushnotification')
    implementation fileTree(dir: "libs", include: ["*.jar"])
    implementation "com.android.support:appcompat-v7:${rootProject.ext.supportLibVersion}"
    implementation "com.facebook.react:react-native:+"  // From node_modules

    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-core:12.0.1'
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:12.0.1'

    addUnimodulesDependencies()

    if (enableHermes) {
        def hermesPath = "../../node_modules/hermes-engine/android/";
        debugImplementation files(hermesPath + "hermes-debug.aar")
        releaseImplementation files(hermesPath + "hermes-release.aar")
    } else {
        implementation jscFlavor
    }
}
```
9. And add to the bottom of the file: 
` apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'`
10. And add to android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
```

      </activity>
      <activity android:name="com.facebook.react.devsupport.DevSettingsActivity" />
    </application>
```
11. And to App.js
```
import Analytics from '@aws-amplify/analytics';
import PushNotification from '@aws-amplify/pushnotification';
import aws_exports from './aws-exports';

// PushNotification need to work with Analytics
Analytics.configure(aws_exports);

PushNotification.configure(aws_exports);
```
12. Build
```
yarn start
and
yarn android
```

Logs and errors:

The Kotlin Gradle plugin was loaded multiple times in different subprojects, which is not supported and may break the build. 
This might happen in subprojects that apply the Kotlin plugins with the Gradle 'plugins { ... }' DSL if they specify explicit versions, even if the versions are 
equal.
Please add the Kotlin plugin to the common parent project or the root project, then remove the versions in the subprojects.
If the parent project does not need the plugin, add 'apply false' to the plugin line.

Hello guys, 

I've my app protected with the Authenticator component, something like this:
```      
<Authenticator                                                                                                                    
        authState={loginState}                                                                                                          
        hideDefault={true}                                                                                                              
        amplifyConfig={config}                                                                                                          
        onStateChange={authState => setLoginState(authState)}                                                                           
      >                                                                                                                                 
        <App authState={loginState} />                                                                                                  
        <CustomSignIn />                                                                                                                
        <VerifyContact />                                                                                                               
        <ForgotPassword />                                                                                                              
        <Loading />                                                                                                                     
        <CustomSignUp signUpConfig={signUpConfig} />                                                                                    
        <CustomConfirmSignUp />                                                                                                         
      </Authenticator>
```
And inside the App component I've my routes
```
const App = props => {                                                                                                                                                                                                             
    return <StateProvider initialState={initialState} reducer={mainReducer}>                                                                   
      <Router history={hist}>                                                                                                           
        <Switch>                                                                                                                        
          <Route exact path={`/`} component={HomePageWrapper} />                                                                        
          <Route exact path={`/aaa`} component={AAAA} />                                                          
          <Route exact path="/bbb" component={BBBB} />                                                            
          <Route exact path="/ccc" component={CCCC} />                                                           
          <Route exact path="/unauthaccess" component={UnAuthAccess} />
          ....     
```
And I want `/unauthaccess` to be accessible unauthenticated. I'm trying to avoid having one App component for auth urls and another for unauth urls. Is there a way to make an exception so that Authenticator ignores certain URLs?

Thanks
**Describe the bug**
The `JS.browserOrNode()` function uses eval-like expressions that prevent amplify-js from running when a strict Content-Security-Policy is in place. The eval-like expressions I'm talking about are `new Function("...")`, which are not allowed in a Content-Security-Policy, that doesn't allow `eval()`.

This leads to the following error message in the browser (in this case Firefox):
> Content Security Policy: The page’s settings blocked the loading of a resource at eval (“default-src”). vendor.js

This prevents us from using any of the functionality provided by amplify-js. I believe the issue was introduced with commit 52bd2877bee66b934885e6726b68c8a926c28c3d, which changed the functionality in `browserOrNode()` to use `new Function()`.

**To Reproduce**

1. Have a page with a Content-Security-Policy that defines `default-src 'self';` (`script-src 'self';` should also work), see `Sample Code` for the one we are using.
2. Include any `amplify-js` package that uses `JS.browserOrNode()` (in our case `@aws-amplify/auth`).
3. See error in the browser's console (and possibly on the page), the package will not be working as expected

**Expected behavior**
`amplify-js` (or rather `browserOrNode()`) should not break any Content-Security-Policy that forbids `eval()`

**Screenshots**
Error in Firefox console:

**Additional context**
We ran into this issue when we upgraded from `@aws-amplify/auth` 1.3.3 to 2.1.3. The last version that works is 1.4.3, anything after 1.5.0 is not working.

**Sample code**
Our Content-Security-Policy:
```
default-src 'self';
connect-src https://cognito-idp.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com;
object-src 'none';
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
base-uri 'none';
```

I hope I didn't forget anything. If there's anything else I can do to make the issue more clear or to provide additional insights, please let me know.
