[Zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) is a zsh package manager.

This will save users the time of figuring out how to install the package and only have it run `dircolors` once per install / update.
$ diff -Nur .dircolors <(wget -o /dev/null -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trapd00r/LS_COLORS/master/LS_COLORS) | wc -l

$ grep -E '^\..+' .dircolors | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -D

I am using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I followed the setup instructions.

Here is my LS_COLORS:

But the correct colors do not show up for the file extension when I am viewing that are available where Windows is mounted:

The colors are displaying fine as long as I am not in the /mnt folder or any of its subdirectories:

Any ideas what could be going wrong?

Here is the relevant portion of my .bashrc:

UPDATE: I think the issue is with the files being executable:

Could someone please explain what is going on here?

Thanks!



The install instructions say 

```
wget https://raw.github.com/trapd00r/LS_COLORS/master/LS_COLORS -O $HOME/.dircolors
echo 'eval $(dircolors -b $HOME/.dircolors)' >> $HOME/.bashrc
. $HOME/.bashrc
```

Which is correct (it works). But the instruction above them says to add 

```
eval $( dircolors -b $HOME/LS_COLORS )
```
to the .bashrc, Which doesn't work, unless of course you pair it with 

```
wget https://raw.github.com/trapd00r/LS_COLORS/master/LS_COLORS -O $HOME/LS_COLORS
```

The URL seems too long such that it is more than 80 columns.
* Manifest.in
* Pipfile
* Pipfile.lock
* requirements.txt

maybe others
Should be some kind of metadata, but maybe not in the existing metadata group

Edit: This was originally about `.vcf` and `.vcard` extensions but it sprawled into something much more ambitious.

I'd rather have an explicit close for every open fold marker. Right now it's
pretty random where any fold is explicity closed or not.

Indentation of the comments is also pretty out of whack. Sometimes a thing is indented,
sometimes not. Probably the thing to do is just kill all the indendtation. Idk.

I recognize that probably 99% of people out there aren't using these, but I am,
so I'll get around to this eventually.
