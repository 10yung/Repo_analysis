This PR is a replacement for #101; the intent here is to simply wrap up the loose ends rather than adding much new content.

All of the review comments to date in #101 have been addressed except https://github.com/spacetelescope/notebooks/pull/101#discussion_r324758630 which requires a bit of additional explanation to resolve.

@eteq -- you can close #101 now if you want.
I just noticed this: the deploy machinery stopped working at some point because of this error (see an example log of this by going to the deploy stage of https://circleci.com/gh/spacetelescope/notebooks/146?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link):
```
remote: error: File notebooks/MAST/TESS/interm_tesscut_requests/astrocut.zip is 216.03 MB; this exceeds GitHubâ€™s file size limit of 100.00 MB
```

I'm not sure why this appeared now when it didn't before, but the short-term fix is simply to prevent that file from getting sent to github pages.  This may be as simple as adding it to the gitignore, but might require manually deleting it at the end of the notebook. 

Just to confirm, though @mustaric, this file is not critical for people *viewing* the notebook, right?  Rather it's just there as a side effect of the notebook?

(Potentially related to #103 although maybe not because this could be a genuine desirable artifact as opposed to "unneeded" parts.)

Currently CircleCI shows the green check even when the notebook build fails. I think @jbcurtin has already corrected this in #116, so it might just need that to be merged, but just in case I'm making the issue to ensure we don't drop it if that doesn't turn out to fix things afterall.
For the TESS how to use DVT files we should connect to the tutorial on how to locate the DVT files in the portal. 
Updated the Circle CI Integration to compile each notebook individually before building all the pages. Failures are reported when the notebook cannot be built for some reason.

With this update, CircleCI was also update for `spacetelescope/notebooks`

3 notebooks have outdated parameter values:

https://github.com/spacetelescope/notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/DrizzlePac/align_to_catalogs/align_to_catalogs.ipynb

driz_sep_bits,final_bits='64, 32' should be  '64, 16'

https://github.com/spacetelescope/notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/DrizzlePac/sky_matching/sky_matching.ipynb

final_bits='64' should be '16'

https://github.com/spacetelescope/notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/DrizzlePac/optimize_image_sampling/optimize_image_sampling.ipynb

driz_sep_bits,final_bits='64,512' should be '16,512'

Tried to retrieve TIC targets by either TIC id or RA+Dec. It doesn't seem like it's working at all... Here'a screen shot of the retrieved targets, which are all pretty far away from the input RA and Dec. 

Thanks.
The link to the drizzlepac handbook is broken in the aligning multiple visits notebooks, so I'd imagine this occurs in other notebooks as well. 
I added a notebook on programmatic wats to perform unit conversions as provided by http://www.stsci.edu/hst/nicmos/tools/conversion_form.html. I put this notebook in a new directory NICMOS, so that any future NICMOS notebooks can be added there as well.
