## Issue

I find it frustrating that I can open a collapsed heading by clicking the "folded" symbol in the left-hand gutter, but that the toggle disappears and I can't recollapse it after. I know the commands to close and open are available, but I would like to have the toggle show all the time (or at least on hover) as when writing code with indents. 

## Proposed solution

I would like to either by default or optionally enable heading folding toggles displayed for all headings that would show expand/collapse state. 

## Alternatives

I haven't yet found another package that includes this feature for Markdown, though the feature is part of the core in similar circumstances. 

As you can see in this screenshot, if I indent the UL, I can get the desired behavior from the heading, but obviously, that's different Markdown.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I organize my .md files into categories, which each have their own subfolder in /_posts. Octopress used the subfolder name to populate the "categories:" field in Frontmatter. 
Using "{dir}" in the frontmatter template does not work.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Populate the "Categories:" field in the files frontmatter with the name of its subfolder. E.g.: /_posts/example becomes "Categories: example" upon file creation.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Only alternative Ive come up with is putting an empty "categories:" field in the frontmatter and fill it by hand.


**Describe the bug**
I upgraded Atom from 1.38.something to 1.40.1. After upgrading, the TAB key is just adding the spaces, but not indenting the bullet.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open a markdown file and start a list using a dash `-`, a space then type.
2. Hit ENTER to go to the next line. A dash is correctly inserted for the next list item and the cursor is to the right of that by 1 space.
3. hit TAB to indent the list item.
4. 4 spaces are inserted after the dash, the dash has not moved over.

**Expected behavior**
I expected the list item to indent as a whole, to the right, dash and all. For the past year I've used this on a daily basis - I could click in the middle of the line of a list item and hit tab and it would indent the whole thing. Now it's just inserting spaces with no recognition.

**Screenshots**

**Additional context**
I tried uninstalling and re-installing the plugin but it made no difference.


When I write md in Chinese and generate TOC, the link of anchor will be translation to random code. Although I know it's automatic translation, but can I display it in Chinese by configuring it to be untranslated?
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Just reviewed a colleagues PR and spotted this... which he tells me is inserted by this table formatter.

```md
|:--------------------|:------------------|:---------------|:----------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
```

I believe this bases it off of the length of the columns, but if the length changes, it makes this a little redundant unless you keep reformatting...

**Describe the solution you'd like**

The following should be sufficient:

```md
| :-- | :-- | :-- |  :-- | :-- |
```

I can see the benefit of what it currently does (legibility as a plain text file), but could be configurable based on preference.
**Problem** 
Need to maintain extensive wikis of concepts and hard to get into the "flow" if I have to maintain the links manually.

**Solution**
Implement support for WikiLink syntax like in `SoyWiki` http://danielchoi.com/software/soywiki.html (below is taken from "CamelCase WikiLinks rule!")

 * Besides being the original, CamelCase is the most elegantly minimalist approach to linking wiki pages together -- "with no additional markup whatsoever," as Ward Cunningham put it.
 * It encourages you more than other wiki link patterns to create wiki pages with succinctly descriptive names that are easy to remember.
 * Because the link pattern is so minimal and succinct, writing wiki links interrupts your flow of thought less than other wiki link patterns.
 * CamelCase wiki links are less noisy than other link patterns in raw plain text form. This also contributes to flow.
 * The CamelCase link pattern is very conducive to storing wiki pages in plain text files: the page names can map directly to Unix file names without any awkward character escaping or munging.

Must be able to refactor while auto maintaining all usages (see "Wiki refactoring" section in link above).

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Have done extensive research and tried all I could. Using Confluence for years but it is quite heavy and does not support `markdown`.


Can we integration uploader? Example by qiniu uploader, aliyun oss.
Sorry couldnt find this anywhere, but you think there could be an option to customize spacing between ordered (and maybe unordered) lists? 

so
<pre>
1.
1.
1.
</pre>

becomes

<pre>
1. 

1.

1.
</pre>

On github, a single line spacing does show.

Thanks.
An improvement to do those things on save (need to add a checkbox for this option in configuration) could be good.
Currently image width, height and align are editable, but ignored when entered:

Inserts:

`![Hello](/images/2016/07/hello.jpg)`

I think either those fields should not be editable, or it should insert an html image tag with those attributes, right?
