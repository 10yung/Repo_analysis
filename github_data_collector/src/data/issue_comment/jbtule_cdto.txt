I'm setting up a new Mac laptop and I installed `cd to` in my Applications folder. However, when I'm in Finder and open `cd to` via Spotlight, it opens the stock Terminal app instead of iTerm. I've used it like this in the past, but can't remember if I had to do something special to get it to work.

I have set iTerm as the default terminal through its menu. I'm on OSX 10.15.1 Catalina.

Thanks!

Hey, everyone interested in this project.
Since author don't have time to update this repository and in pull requests I see a lot of valuable contributions - I created a fork and merged most important PRs there (#13, #14, #21, #22), cleaned up code a bit and released latest code-signed binary. Tested on macOS 10.12 Sierra and iTerm2 3.0.10.

@jbtule thanks for your project, it is pretty awesome, feel free to merge/cherry-pick some of my commits if you'll decide to update your upstream.

as close i could get it ;) as it uses a downscaled 64 or 32@2x icon

Yosemite is default, edit Info.plist to change

Didn't do anything to the code or the project. Just updated the icon to look good in Mavericks.

The current icon look very out of place on OS X Mavericks. Would you be open to an icon that looks more similar to the Finder's other toolbar buttons?
