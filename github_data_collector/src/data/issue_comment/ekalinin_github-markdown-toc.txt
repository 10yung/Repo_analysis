I'm not getting the expected results: 
- MacOS 10.14.6
- .md files generated w/ [Typora](https://www.typora.io/)
- GitHub Desktop app used for git client
- [the Github file](https://github.com/seamusdemora/PiFormulae/blob/master/CreatingRationalMusicLibrary2.md)
 
Here's what I've done: 
1. `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc/master/gh-md-toc -o gh-md-toc`  
2. `chmod a+x gh-md-toc` 
3. `./gh-md-toc /Users/seamus/Documents/GitHub/PiFormulae/CreatingRationalMusicLibrary2.md > new-with-toc.txt` 
4. `cat new-with-toc.txt`

After a select+C&P into my .md file & uploading, this doesn't render properly on my github page:

 (https://github.com/seamusdemora/PiFormulae/blob/master/CreatingRationalMusicLibrary2.md) 

GitHub wiki pages can have spaces in the name. This is not supported by gh-md-toc. Filenames cannot have spaces.
```
# First
### Third
```
becomes

```
   * [First](#first)
         * [Third](#third)
```

and github renders it in one line (see https://github.com/elimohl/test/blob/master/README.md)
I have  a README.md 

I wanted to create TOC

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc/master/gh-md-toc
chmod a+x gh-md-toc
cat README.md | ./gh-md-toc -
```

Sometimes it shows the contents, but sometimes it return blank. I cant understand why sometimes it works and sometimes not

The _added by_ footer shouldn't be added when inserting the table into the md file unless the user specifies otherwise.
Hi, love this tool. 
Is it possible to add an option to generate a list of items starting with a dash rather than an asterisk?



First time doing this, hopefully, you consider it for merging.

I tried to do a sed append, however, OSX sed requires a new line. It got really tricky and I abandoned it in favor of just generating the TOC files and deleting them. Dirty but works and keeps your repository clean of backup files.
Would it be possible to not back up the README.md using a command line switch? We already have git?
I've been working on some dynamic blocks for Gutenberg (dynamic in that they output html in the render_callback of block registration). Any headings I insert into the content in this way are not picked up by Easy TOC. Not inserted into the TOC at all.

I'm using the shortcode, not automatic TOC insertion. 

I think this is because the shortcode runs before the blocks are rendered and builds the TOC against the stored post content, not the actual final output.

Is there anything i can do to easily change easy TOC so that the shortcode just adds filters to insert the TOC that run on the final content?
