When I was finding Typescript web app example half year ago, I got an idea why not mix TypeScript-Node-Starter, TypeScript-React-Starter, and TypeScript-React-Native-Starter together.

Then I tried my best to build such a template in Typescript and wonder if anyone would like it?

Any issue and comment is welcome.



my project is git clone https://github.com/tassdr/react-native-template.git

downloaded there and trying to run in my macOS but error remains like this 

Admins-MacBook-Pro:react-native-template admin$ react-native run-ios
error iOS project folder not found. Are you sure this is a React Native project?. Run CLI with --verbose flag for more details.
Admins-MacBook-Pro:react-native-template admin$

please help me
Starting react native 0.57 react-native-typescript-transformer is not required. Check [here](https://github.com/ds300/react-native-typescript-transformer/issues/77#issuecomment-421318966).
setState is asynchonous. If next state is dependent on it's previous value, you should pass an update function to setState, in stead of object. 

Reference:
https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#state-updates-may-be-asynchronous
Added setup instructions for users who do not use yarn
ts-jest problems fixed: https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/user/react-native/
These are safer forms of setState in this instance since we are
computing state based on previous state.

You did not declare the type of the style file when creating the style in hello.tsx in your readme file,
Why did I have this error when I created my own style
The current Example (0.54.3) out-of-dated and doesn't works with latest react-native.
Actually, I have to init new fresh project instead of upgrade directly, then integrate with typescript.
update rn-cli.config.js to confirm to new metro config structure used by react-native 0.47.0
