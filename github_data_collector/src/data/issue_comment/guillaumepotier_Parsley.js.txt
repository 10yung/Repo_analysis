There should be an [easy way to bypass validation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59559304/how-to-prevent-parsley-validation-when-submit-form/59568567).

Currently, the return value of the `form:validate` and `field:validate` are ignored, but it could be nice to allow skipping validation.

# Create date comparison validator
I find a problem when I use **parsley.js** to compare between two inputs with type **month** or **date**
```html
<input type="month" id="from" name="from">
```
or
```html
<input type="date" id="from" name="from">
```
the problem is that **parsley.js** compares just between years but it doesn't take into consideration days or months when it compares 
## for example :
I want to make sure that the date in the input **from** must be near than the input **to**
```html
<input type="month" id="from" name="from">
<input type="month" id="to" name="to">
```
so I write these two functions to try to fix this problem

Hello, I want to use a group validation ("Correctly fill at least one of these blocks") as : 
[https://parsleyjs.org/doc/examples/custom-validator-events.html](https://parsleyjs.org/doc/examples/custom-validator-events.html)

But when i submit the form empty, nothing is validate.

 Can you reproduce this problem on the official documentation ? 

Best regards





I have a multi-step form with most of the code based on the multi-step example on the site, and when pressing enter on the first field group shows the validation errors on the next group of fields too. Any insights on how to work around this?

Demo of the issue here: https://jsfiddle.net/budji/qv1y372a/20/

TIA

Hello,

I am using Flatpickr as my date UI. Everything is working fine on a desktop application, however, when I test my site on a mobile browser I get a bug. 

Steps
--------
1) Pick a date
2) Hit the submit form; this validates all inputs
3) The date input html is as follows:

` <input class="input datepicker-dob" placeholder="Select Date" type="text" name="dateOfBirth"
                         data-parsley-date data-parsley-validate-if-empty data-parsley-required="true">`

"datepicker-dob" is simply the class to which Flatpickr attaches. I get the below error even if I remove the data-parsley-* attributes.

![IMG_3100](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50425391/62417070-d5a37e00-b63e-11e9-8e4f-cd492d5ddaad.jpg)

Flatpickr is set up as below:

```
     const currDate = new Date();
    const newdate = new Date(currDate);
    newdate.setYear(currDate.getFullYear() - 17);

    flatpickr(".datepicker-dob", {
        dateFormat: "d-M-Y",
        maxDate: newdate
    });
```




This error goes away when I request the mobile site, so I am not sure what is going on here.

I have recreated this issue on safari, and chrome, both on an iphone device.

Any ideas on what could cause this issue?

Thanks






Hi,
my page does have a fixed header.
Therefore, when there is a wrong entry in a field of the form or a mandatory field not filled, page scrolls to the first field with an error.
Unfortunately, this field is covered by my fixed header and therefore not visible.
Is there a way to change this with some kind of offset to this scroll function?

Please let me know if you have any idea.
BR
Jürgen

In Internet Explorer Parsley only accepts dates in ISO format. If you're using an other format for the date, like e.g. the German’s default "31.12.1970", parsley will not accept the date in IE11 – you have to type in "1970-12-31".

Because CodePen blocks IE 11, I have to paste the example here:

```
<input type="date" id="date-of-birth" name="date-of-birth" placeholder="" value="">
```



Actually, if you add for example a `data-parsley-length="[4, 4]"`, the message is very odd. I propose to add these two new validators for a better messaging.
