Added the `chalk` theme from https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/blob/master/schemes/Chalk.itermcolors which can be previewed by doing `Ctrl + F` "chalk" on https://iterm2colorschemes.com/

I also [wrote a converter for `.itermcolors` files into ConEmu styles](https://github.com/Cobertos/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/itermcolors2conemu.py) (based on your template, thanks for that btw). It'll spit out the ConEmu styles on stdout using the most compatible colors from the `.itermcolors` file (because it doesn't map 1 to 1). Figured it might be useful to you. If interested I can convert it to a proper `.exe`.
Screenshots for ayu-dark and ayu-mirage are mixed up. This commit renames the screenshot files so that they will give a proper representation of the color scheme.
I was able to install the themes using the .\Install-ConEmuTheme.ps1 command, however they are not showing up in the settings when I try to select colors. If I attempt to import them again, it states they are already imported. 


They show up in the config.xml I believe (attached as zip) but do not show in the color selection
