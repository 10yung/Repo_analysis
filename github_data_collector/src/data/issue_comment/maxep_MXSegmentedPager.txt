Selected segment control with selection indicator displays to left or right instead of center.

* When selecting any segment, it scrolls to left or right side of the screen.
* I have used this library before and it was working properly. But after updating pods it is not working as it was before.

Selected segment should display in center of the screen not on right or left of the screen.

Is there any way to make it working as it was before ?
Can you please help me out for this issue ?

#### Screenshot
I added some pages from story board, I want to ask can I remove some pages from them in code?
Adding an image to the segment button to the left side creating a scrolling issue.

    override func segmentedPager(_ segmentedPager: MXSegmentedPager, selectedImageForSectionAt index: Int) -> UIImage {
            return UIImage(named: image[index])!
    }
    override func segmentedPager(_ segmentedPager: MXSegmentedPager, imageForSectionAt index: Int) -> UIImage {
            return UIImage(named: selectedImage[index])!

    }

Why version 4.0.0 support from iOS 10.0? Is it possible support from iOS 8.0?

in latest version didSelectViewWith change name in didSelectViewAt and it's not fired on pages change anymore, is there some work around for having similar behaviour or it's a bug?

following class protocols:

class MyViewController: MXSegmentedPagerController, MXParallaxHeaderDelegate {
