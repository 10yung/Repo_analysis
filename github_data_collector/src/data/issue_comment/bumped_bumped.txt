Hi, when I use bumped it change my `package.json` order, for example I have:

```json
{
    "scripts": { ... },
    "dependencies: { ... },
    "devDependencies: { ... }
{
```

And after bumped, it changes into 

```json
{
    "dependencies: { ... },
    "devDependencies: { ... },
    "scripts": { ... }
{
```

Is there any way to change only the version of the `package.json` without change all of it?

Thanks
This alias is available for customizing git commit message.

`%s` is the way used at lerna projects, looks a better naming.

I would love to contribute and pull some issues, but I would rather not fumble around in coffee. The code base is relatively small, so I could quickly go through and convert it, but if you want to go through and convert it I'm not going to raise any objections.
