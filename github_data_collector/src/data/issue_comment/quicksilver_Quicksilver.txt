Whether this is entirely related to Catalina or not, I can't say.

Prior to the new macOS I had some scripts for iTunes actuated from the keyboard. Moving to Catalina, I modified the scripts to work with the new 'TV' application. Going to the 'Scope' tab under 'Trigger', I then replaced 'iTunes' in the applications list by 'TV', with 'Enabled in selected applications', but the script wasn’t triggered by the shortcut.

Selecting 'Enabled in all applications' makes the triggers work and, bizarrely enough, selecting 'Disabled in selected applications' also works.
Hi, I associated a shortcut to trigger the opening of finder (CMD+E). In Mojave this fails to bring focus to that window as you can see in this screen cast https://d.pr/free/v/vDXOJi

Somehow thew "open" trigger is only able to change the focus of the menubar, which is useless (and odd).

I have used this shortcut for years in previous OSX versions, and it is only now in Mojave that the problem present itself. 
**Describe the bug**
If I try to copy and paste something in iWork (Pages specifically), it will instead paste the object I copied previously.  This doesn't happen with text, only sometimes with objects or groups of objects.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Pages.
2. Make two sets of objects: a rectangle, some text, and an equation.  (I'm not sure which of these are actually required but this seems to work.)
3. Copy the first set, and paste somewhere else.
4. Copy the second set, and press paste.
5. When you paste, the first set will show up instead of the second.
6. Quitting Quicksilver seems to stop this behavior, and turning off the Clipboard plugin also seems to help after a restart of Quicksilver.

**Expected behavior**
When I copy an object, it should be available to paste right away.

**What version of macOS?**
10.13.6 

**What version of Quicksilver?**
1.6.0

This should force some lingering UI things onto the main thread. These have been warnings for a while, but under Catalina, they will crash QS.

Progress toward #2497
Hello, I am almost certain I am posting in the wrong place but I am new to this stuff and I can't figure out where else to post it. I am sorry to be contributing to any unwanted chaos. If someone would like to tell me how I should have known where to put it, then next time I will know how to look for the information more effectively. In any case please direct this to whoever should be aware of it.

I'm not making a google account and this also doesn't sound particularly appropriate for that.

I was just copying and pasting large Adobe Illustrator files (>500MB) into my clipboard for image editing work. Quicksilver was storing these files in its clipboard, and then subsequently saving them to disk using `[QSLibrarian saveShelf:]` every time the clipboard changed (`clipboardChanged` notif).

This was causing QS to hang indefinitely (writing a 1GB file to disk every time I copy/paste)

Solutions that come to mind:

1. Have an option to limit the filesize saved to the QS clipboard
2. Don't save the clipboard to disk *every* time the clipboard changes, but either:
     a) save it periodically (e.g. every 30s) if anything's changed - downside is some things might be lost if QS crashes before saving the latest clipboard
     b) Use some binary file format for saving to disk and only make incremental edits. Or maybe just something like SQLite to 'insert' new items at the top of the list and 'pop' old items off the bottom of the list.

Open for discussion, but noting this issue here now

Finder has a setting in the "Get Info" window of a document that can set a document as a "Stationery pad", basically a template file. With this setting, every time the document is opened, it's copied and the copy is opened. Quicksilver does not follow this behavior, and always opens the template document itself.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to a document in Finder.
2. Open "Get Info" window for the document.
3. Make sure the "Stationery pad" checkbox is checked.
4. Open the document from Finder to see expected behavior.
5. Open the document using Quicksilver to see erroneous behavior.

**Expected behavior**
A copy of the document should be created and that is what should be opened (I'm not sure whether Finder handles this normally, or instructs the opening application to make a new copy).

**Describe the bug**
I assigned a trigger to "Search Artists" for the iTunes plug-in but when I press the keys, nothing happens. It's probably a bit early to report, but I'm using macOS Catalina Beta 1. I've added Quicksilver to "Accessibility" and "Input Monitoring" in the Security & Privacy prefs pane. Also, when I try going to "Run" in QS and type in "search by" I get the attached result ("Search Contents of (null)")

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Install the iTunes Plug-in
2. Assign a trigger to "Search Artists", eg: Cmd+Shift+Ctrl+A
3. Press trigger keys, nothing happens
4. Tried rebooting and relaunching QS, no love :(

**Expected behavior**
Quicksilver dialogue opens with "Search Artist" icon showing

**Describe the bug**
If the "Current Document" proxy object is brought up in the first pane when a non-document based app (e.g. Safari) is frontmost, four error message notifications are immediately dispatched to the Notification Center. This happens even if the "Current Document" proxy object is only momentarily in the first pane while the user is typing to select something else (e.g. the "Current Web Page (Safari)" proxy object).

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Safari and make it the frontmost application.
2. In Quicksilver, bring up the "Current Document" proxy object in the first pane.
3. See one notification banner reporting the error pop up.
4. Open Notification Center and see that there were actually four identical notifications sent and that macOS merely collapsed them when showing the popup banner.

**Expected behavior**
Ideally, a single notification would be sent only if "Current Document" was still selected in the first pane when the focus moves from the first pane to the second pane. That way, if "Current Document" was in the first pane temporarily while the user was in the process of selecting something else, the user will not be bothered by unnecessary error notifications.

One way this could be achieved would be to queue up the error message notifications in an internal buffer and then use some simple conditional logic to see if the queued notifications should actually be sent at the appropriate time. To make it generalized and extensible, this queue could keep track of both the notification message properties and the conditions to test (with true as the default, of course). Plus, using queue would make it easy to detect and skip any duplicate notifications that might have been generated, so that only one copy of each unique notification message is ever sent.
