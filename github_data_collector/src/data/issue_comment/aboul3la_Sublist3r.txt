Docker file added and readme updated 
The extra "<BR>" come from https://crt.sh/ when the SSL certificates has more than one DNS name on the certificate.
Also, the current regex is matching "<A style....." which are checked on the loop (unnecessary)
Hello,

I noticed when I save output and I noticed the output included <BR> and this impacted my script when I tried using this output. Now I have since made changes to adjust for this so it does not impact me but I figured I let you know.

Sorry i made a mistake in my last PR, i thought the Threatcrowd's DDOS protection is targeting to everyone,but i found it seems just targeting the ip from china mainland(maybe there are more other areas, not just China mainland).
And if  i use the ip from Hongkong, DDOS protection didn't work
So i change the code, make sure that whereever the user is, Sublist3r can always extract subdomians from Threatcrowd correctly  :)  
Wish you can merge it. :)
Have a nice day! :)
If you want to run this as a part of your scripts, you want only final results without banner.

I'm adding -q --quiet parameter to show only final result.
Internally I'm using the existing `silent` variable with one exception.
When I run the script with google as the only search engine, I don't get any domain in return. Is google blocking the request?
Here is the output
