Based on this (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:BS), there should be a Bahamas island state/district for New Providence.
The UK data for subregions, pulled from the ISO data is using UK cities mixed in with UK Counties _(UK Counties are the equivalent of U.S. States)_

Lancashire (County), Bradford (City), Essex(County), Manchester (City), Leeds (City).

This list is not what would be seen in a drop-down selector for State or Region in an online checkout for example.

Address line 1: **My Street**
Address Line 2: **Flat Name**
City: **Manchester**
State: _Should be Lancashire (The County) but we also have the option for Manchester (City) in there._
Zip (Post Code):  **MA01 3LK**
Country: **United Kingdom**


I noticed that the issue was raised in the past and closed but the issue is genuine as a UK citizen that list is not pure regions, its cities and counties all mixed up, what that would be used for who knows, and I believe it is missing West Yorkshire.




As in 2011, the regions in Ivory Coast changes from 18 to 14.
Therefore, is it possible to update it to the latest state list of Ivory Coast?

Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Ivory_Coast#Regions_before_2011

- continents and sub-continents
- Only EN and DE are currently supported locales

Would it make sense to include information about continents in Carmen?

[Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/) has a nice database of [countries with their corresponding continent code](http://www.geonames.org/countries/) ([parseable file](http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/countryInfo.txt)). I ran a little script and it turns out all `Carmen::Country.all.map(&:code)` are included.

These APIs would be useful:

``` ruby
europe = Carmen::Continent.coded('EU')
# <#Carmen::Continent name="Europe">

europe.countries # Alias: `europe.subregions`
# [<#Carmen::Country name="Andorra">, <#Carmen::Country name="Albania">, <#Carmen::Country name="Austria">, ...]

netherlands = Carmen::Country.coded('NL')
# <#Carmen::Country name="Netherlands">

netherlands.continent # Alias: `netherlands.parent`
# <#Carmen::Continent name="Europe">
```

I could work on this.

(this issue related to issue #100 )

in the directory of /locale in carmen, there are 2-letter code directories for each languages. (I guess they are languages and not countries. fix me if I am wrong.)
but some of directory names are country code, not language code.

so far country codes are 'China' & 'Japan'. they should be 'Chinese' & 'Japanese'. ('zh' & 'ja')
### list of names in /locale directory.
- cn:country 'China'    (lang = zh )
- cs:lang       'Czech'
