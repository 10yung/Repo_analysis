in place of WorkingMesh

Current document is limited, do you have any video tutorial or step by step approach. It will be helpful. 

The old version is working in 2019.2.7f but the new version.

Thank you. 
A LoD group of 5 levels was generated from Simplygon on local grid.
The resulting prefabs were copied into a basic scene.
The LoD Group prefab was attached to the HLoD Root public input of the Volume Script which is attached to the automatically added LODVolumeNode0 object.
The "Enable HLOD" button was clicked.

No geometry renders during play in the editor, with a basic FlyCamera moving in the scene.

I'm not sure if the LoD prefabs were connected to the AutoLoD system in the correct way, by attaching the group prefab to the HLoD root.

Hi, trying to use AutoLOD with lowpoly project, but generating mesh with the default QuadricMeshSimplifier results in smoothed mesh. I spent hours trying to learn the code and trying to pinpoint the exact part where the smoothing feature is done, but couldnt find it. 

Removing these files from the QuadricMeshSimplifier script results in sharp mesh, but all the colors of the model are lost.
 meshSimplifier.UV1 = inputMesh.uv;
outputMesh.uv = meshSimplifier.UV1;

Hope that helps to solve the problem!
Loving these plugins so far, but running into some issues with SceneLOD on one of my projects. It's a relatively large project, and is split into multiple scenes that are loaded additively on top of each other (using the plugin https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/advanced-multi-scene-cross-scene-references-47200 - though I suspect the same issue would be present just using Unity's built-in additive scene system).

As far as I can tell, SceneLOD doesn't handle multiple scenes appropriately. I've tried to make some local changes to the code base to get it working properly, but haven't been able to get it fully functional yet. Is multiple scene support something that might be handled at some point, or should I start considering coding our own HLOD system?
As an alternative to an automatic LOD generation for individual assets, could Imposters perhaps be implemented in their stead?

With the advent of the new Shader-Graph situation, I would think this would be in the cards for LOD, right? D:


PS: I just wanted to yell from the top of my lungs that YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!!! -- Thanks for looking into this LOD stuff! -- I've been wanting to make larger worlds, but Unity has been very adament about crushing my dreams on this... :(
Demo Please! Dont Know How to use Scene LOD at all.
might it be possible to at-some-point think about linking/reaching out to some time-served battle-tested UAS solutions and making sure they know about the project?  It would seem to be in Unity ecosphere's ethos and gives them every chance to get involved.

I think HLOD is most important part of Game Making. Because perfomance is most important part of Game.
Unity lightmap are belong to scene. How can I bake lightmap in HLOD?
and/or default the Quadric simplifier to preserve borders
