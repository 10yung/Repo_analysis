Hi

The InstrumentsCandlesFactory is not working for "monthly" granularity. Works fine for weekly and daily granularities.

Using parameters below.
```
params = {
    "price": "M",
    "granularity": "M",
    "from": "2005-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "to": "2017-07-01T00:00:00Z",
    "dailyAlignment": 17,
    "alignmentTimezone": "America/New_York",
    "weeklyAlignment": "Friday"
}
```
Say instrument is "AU200_AUD"

Basically, calling line below:
client.request(factories.InstrumentsCandlesFactory(instrument=instrument, params=params))

Running line in Interactive Window in VSCode (using WinPython)  yields error below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

I've just run the script for daily & weekly data - so pretty sure OANDA is working fine.
Regarding #145 : Missing `distance` parameter on `StopLossOrderRequest` and  `StopLossDetails` implemented

OANDA docs are not 100% clear about where the parameter is supported. The TakeProfitOrderRequest names `distance` in it's header but in the details nothing is found. Placing a TP-order using `distance` fails with an error. 

I raised a question at OANDA regarding this: docs wrong or is it not implemented (yet)?

2019-07-17: update from OANDA: they are looking into this ... 

2019-07-29: update from OANDA: _this parameter is not public yet and may contain bugs. So it is not recommended to be used by any script or third-party application._

Bottomline: it can't be used in a TakeProfitOrderRequest !
Hello,

Is there a way to make StopLoss and TakeProfit orders as a pip difference based on the Market order instead of a set price.

The current method only allows you to put in a price for the StopLoss and Take Profit.  I would like to be able to use a constant SL and TP for my trades.


Thank you,
