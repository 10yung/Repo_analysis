cling based C++ as scripting language / hot code reload
Why? Able to run C++ script in runtime or compile it for max speed ( as in example https://github.com/derofim/cling-cmake )
Also: May be used to improve modules compile time 

> **HOT code reload**
> possible approaches:
> 
> store app state
> fix cling undo for files

> IDK how to do it, but you can create child cling::Interpreter


Hi,
Does this game engine support multiplayer features?
Right mouse button is 1 while middle button is 2 in imgui:

I am unable to build the atomic engine. i am getting an error when i try to clone the git recursively as well as regularly.

Hi everyone,

I'm new here, and so far have not been able to run this engine.

AtomicGameEngine page says:

> "Atomic Editor binary downloads are not currently available. Build from source for your platform using these instructions."  

I compiled it without any error , but it can't run correctly.  AtomicEditor.exe get: "Error executing main.js"

Can somebody give me a binary download link for windows?  please

Lol that was weird that you were using the imessage logo in your markdown file. I feel like it is copyrighted and it's just off-putting to see it used somewhere else..

So I replaced it with a royalty free message logo ðŸ˜‚.. Hardly a noticeable difference to those who don't use apple.

Hope you like the change I made.. If you don't accept my pull request plz change the icon it makes my eyes bleed

ok love you bye ðŸ’‹
Since you're going to install the icon to a location compliant with [freedesktop.org standards](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html) you don't need to specify the icon file extension in the `.desktop` launcher. It will be found anyway.

This facilitates the use of non-PNG (e.g. SVG) app icon themes.
Cf. this [example `.desktop` launcher](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#example).
Where can i find a example of Multiplayer Game for your game engine?
