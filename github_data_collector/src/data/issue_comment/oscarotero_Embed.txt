I created a folder name it embedcode in that folder I installed the embed/embed 
```
Nixas-MacBook-Pro-3:embedcode Yanick$ composer require embed/embed
Using version ^3.4 for embed/embed

```
I created a file embedcode/test.php and add the code 
```
<?php

use Embed\Embed;

//Load any url:
$info = Embed::create('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP1xn5wHtxE');

var_dump($info->code);

?>
```
But I get `500 Internal Server Error`

`Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)`
Can any one tell me how to install Embed without composer. I read this 
`If you cannot (or don't want to) use composer, just include the PSR-4 autoload.php file in your code.`
but where to include this and do I have to download the files or just use it.
Hello, 
I love this tool, unfortunately it's not working for exemple on this web site : https://www.udemy.com/

I read somewhere that : The fix is to add the user-agent in the request headers.

Hope it can help 

Cheers
Is there any Embed alternative for node js ? I think this package really awesome...
# Changed log
- Fix failed assertions during unit tests work.
- Because of the TLS `handshake` [issue](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/6339), it should have set the current PHP versions during Travis CI build.
- Drop `php-5.5.x` version support because the handshake issue cannot be solved.
And these versions are so old that we should not maintain that.
- Let the package require `php-5.6` version at least and define this setting inside `require` block in `composer.json`.

Got an error with this url, but it works with demo:

Hi,

I love this library. However it seems to keep files open after a curl request. I cannot seem to find where exactly but it varies between 2-6 files after a request. 

(It looks like it is something in the CURL call).
Hey, first of all, fantastic library! I'm using it to power https://github.com/benjamminf/craft-embedded-assets and it's working amazingly well. So cheers üëç 

Sometimes the width/height (and aspect ratio) properties are `null` but the embed code has a defined size. For example, no dimensional values get extracted from Google Maps links, but the resulting embed code includes an `<iframe>` with the width/height set to 600√ó400.

What do you think about extracting these values from the embed codes as a fallback? Using `DOMDocument` you could parse the HTML, query for an `<iframe>` and get the width/height attribute values (and style properties incase width/height are set there). Though I'm not sure what scope you've set for this library, or whether something like this would be reliable.

I'm currently doing the above in my project and would be happy to open a pull request implementing this here.
When I retrieve soundclouds infos from url, getTags always returns the same:

array(8)
    string(6) "record"
    string(6) "sounds"
    string(5) "share"
    string(5) "sound"
    string(5) "audio"
    string(6) "tracks"
    string(5) "music"
    string(10) "soundcloud"

I notice that the soundcloud adapter is just the Webpage class, maybe we could add another adapter and override the getTags method ?
