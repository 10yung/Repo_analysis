Hi, I have some experience in the .NET and Bot framework, I've been developing (amateur) for quite a while. Recently I wanted to create a more complex bot and add some machine learning to it, so I found BotSharp.

(First of all I want to point out I've read all the issues before writing this one)

Following the documentation I've cloned the repo and used docker-compose to integrate Articulate UI, to test some agents and see how it works. I open http://localhost:3000 but nothing appears. I can see in the Docker command line that the URL is open but nothing shows.

And, a begginer's question: Do I have to create my own project and link it to BotSharp or is the BotSharp project a bot in itself?

Sorry for the lack of knowledge, I just discovered your wonderful platform!

Thanks in advanced


Did anyone tried to import agent from Wit?
I tried to use the instructions for other platform just replacing platform in meta.json with "Wit" but it generated error 
Read settings from C:\BotSharp2\BotSharp\BotSharp.WebHost\Settings
Loaded Platform "BotSharp.Platform.Dialogflow"
NLU engine: BotSharpNLU, Agent Storage: AgentStorageInFile.

When running in Visual Studio, the application started but shows those:

Cannot load type "BotSharp.Platform.Rasa"

Cannot load type "BotSharp.Platform.OwnThink"
Loaded Channel "BotSharp.Channel.Weixin"

And Articulate-ui gives an error : Error: agent head missing


Hi,
by some reason I won't be able to have the project running using the instructions

I matter what I did, it won't run and generate the about error.

Any suggestions?
Also, is Articulate UI is still supported? If not, what is the alternative for UI?

Hello!

I'm fairly new to Machine Learning in general, so this may be an easy fix, but I'm getting exceptions when trying to train the AI. Specifically a null reference exception on line 131 in PlatformBuilderBase.cs in the Core project.

From the documentation, it wasn't exactly clear how to setup an agent and then what training data to use to really get started with training the AI. I created a zip file with a "meta.json" file and a file called "agent.json", both of which have the same file contents:

{
    "Id": "test",
    "Name": "test",
    "Platform": "Dialogflow",
    "ClientAccessToken": "test",
    "DeveloperAccessToken": "test",
    "Integrations": []
}

This was the only way I was able to get it to start working at all, but maybe this is where I went wrong? Do there need to be 2 files? What contents need to be in the files?

I think this project is great! I just need a bit of help getting everything setup to be able to debug locally so I can start adding to the project. I am not using Docker.

Hi there,

I am new to programming and have started learning C# about 3 months ago, I have never programmed anything before this time period.

After making a calculator and some other basic programs I really wanted to learn how bigger applications work and learn how to upgrade and modify them.

Since I love the A.I part of programming this chatbot seemed like the place to begin.
Yet after snooping around I wanted to test the actual bot and that is where I am stuck now.

I can compile solutions in every separate folder to a separate .exe file yet when I run it it starts VS 2017 and shows the code instead of a UI screen where I can chat with the bot?
Is there a way to compile all into 1 single .exe file?? Or am I thinking wrong and I need to do something else to make it work?

I also keep getting 6 warnings when trying to run it in VS, tried looking up the fault codes yet for now It is not understandable for someone that is just starting out in this field.

Kind regards from this newbie in programming.


I am trying to see how mature the Natural Languange Understanding is.  I have looked into LUIS some but don't like having to pay a fee per call or relying on an external resource and RASA seems very difficult to use from .NET Core but is very robust.   Is there any more documentation on this?
