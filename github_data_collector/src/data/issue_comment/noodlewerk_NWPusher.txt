Hi,

I am not able to send push notification any more from Pusher Mac app. It was showing Notification error: APN invalid Token. please give the solution for the issue  
In iOS 13 it is required to set `apns-push-type` to `background` if we want to use silent push notifications, otherwise notifications won't be delivered.

Is there a way to set that header?
iOS 13 requires the `apns-priority` header to be set to 5 when sending background (`content-available = 1`) notifications. If the header is left off, it defaults to 10 and the push fails. So currently whenever you send a background notification with Pusher in iOS 13, it fails.

Rather than having the app set this header automatically, I'd prefer to be able to add headers manually so that we can test with other APNS header types.
In file NWAppDelegate.m at row 247 is code:
`case 3: return [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSince1970:300];`
but I think correct code should be:
`case 3: return [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:300];`
Seeing if anyone would be interested in adding dark mode support? 
Quick Thank You:
@noodlewerk thanks so much for offering this service. Its help has been immeasurable in demonstrating quick validation for application handling, especially for mutating payloads.

I noticed that (Given I'm in dark mode) if I edit additional content outside of the default payload directly in the payload JSON it appears in black which is difficult to see given the dark mode background.

The work-a-round is to paste raw unformatted text from another editor which appears as white foreground text on existing background. But if many other people are running into this problem, I'm happy to tackle if I get time this week.
Payload sizes now are 2k. However, pusher is hard-coded to 256 bytes. In addition, if your payload is > 256 bytes pusher will just blast the payload into the allocated buffer for notification types 0 and 1, going past the end of the buffer.


Hi!

I wish I found this project sooner. Thanks so much for making this!

I added a little 'Format' button to format the payload for easier reading:

Merge if you like it. It's my first ever contribution to a macOS app so it may be sub-standard, although I tried looking carefully at how the other buttons were created.

Keep it up!
Hi, everyone !
I saw in the issues of the project a request about the icon and that's why I have created this icon for Pusher App which I believe looks better than the current icon.

Have you ever had this problem?  when just connect then push it works well but after a while maybe 1h  the connect is exist then push success but doesn't coming in device,When Reconnect using pusher it works well... Who can tell me why and what should my server colleagues do in JAVA
Took me a bit too long to realize to actually check the AppDelegate for the constant to update ðŸ˜…

Feel free to suggest improvements to the messages.
