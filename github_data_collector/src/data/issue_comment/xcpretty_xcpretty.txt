There appears to be support for attaching screenshots to html reports, but no support for the same feature when using jUnit reporting. This would be a nice-to-have feature for fixing failing CI test runs (namely Azure Devops).
Xcode supports more stuff to performance test than just "wall clock time", it would be cool to also see those in the formatted output

if CodeSign error ,xcpretty not reporting.
The enlarging of screenshots does not work correctly if there were more screenshots taken in one test. Opening any screenshot will enlarge the first one, since wrong index (which is always zero) is used.

I opened a PR #343, but got no response. So I am closing it until someone takes care of this project. This issue should archive this bug for the future.

The last time a pull request was merged in this project was (as of this writing) almost exactly a year ago -- #335.  The [list of contributors](https://github.com/xcpretty/xcpretty/graphs/contributors) doesn't show anything promising either, and their names don't seem to be among the comments in [the most recently-updated pull requests](https://github.com/xcpretty/xcpretty/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).

Has the project been abandoned?
Is there any flag to ask xcpretty not to swallow output of Running script steps?
When submitting my bundles to git (for reasons...) I got a warning that `features/fixtures/xcodebuild.log` is over 10MB big.

It might be nice to exclude the test fixtures from the gem.
Since a while, XCUITest can take screenshots by itself and "attach them" to the `.xcresult` file for inspection in Xcode. I use that to snapshot the state when a UI test fails:
```swift
    override func recordFailure(withDescription description: String, inFile filePath: String, atLine lineNumber: Int, expected: Bool) {
        let screenshot = app.screenshot()
        let screenshotAttachment = XCTAttachment(screenshot: screenshot)
        screenshotAttachment.name = "\(name)-screenshot"
        screenshotAttachment.lifetime = .deleteOnSuccess
        add(screenshotAttachment)
        super.recordFailure(withDescription: description, inFile: filePath, atLine: lineNumber, expected: expected)
    }
```

This seems to be ignored by xcpretty, even when specifying the `--screenshots` command line argument.
Could not find a valid gem 'xcpretty' (>= 0), here is why:
