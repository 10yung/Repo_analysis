Curious what the best practice is for running diff versions of MySQL using Vaprobash w/Vagrant? Is there a simple way like there is for switching Node versions?
I've updated this script to reflect the updated Vagrant box version for ubuntu - ubuntu/xenial64. I originally made most of these changes a couple of months ago, and didn't think to make a pull request. If any other maintainers for this project's base fork can test/confirm my changes work on their end, that would be great - I am more than happy to provide further explanation and edits if required.
I have a few libraries that rely on the ZIP extension
http://php.net/manual/en/book.zip.php 

It would be useful if either `--enable-zip` is included if there is more people who need this or to have a way to define a list of extensions though the config script to be installed.
This pull request specifically targets the upgrade of Ubuntu from 14.04 to 16.04.

Here are some key topics that this upgrade has impact on, which is important to users for this version:

- Docker has been changes to Docker CE
- MongoDB has been updated to versions 3.2 and 3.4 (2.6 had EOL in 2016, 3.0 is troublesome)
- Updated repository and version (to 9.6) for PostgreSQL
- MySQL versions has been bumped to 5.6 and 5.7. 5.5 is no longer available

To test this branch, please make a checkout of this branch (to reflect the version changes in the Vagrantfile) and change your configuration in the Vagrantfile to the following:

    # Config Github Settings
    github_username = "Repox"
    github_repo     = "Vaprobash"
    github_branch   = "feature/ubuntu-16.04"
    github_url      = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/#{github_username}/#{github_repo}/#{github_branch}"


I'd appreciate any feedback if you have trouble with the builds.

Vaprobash need a full update to ubuntu 16.04, this mean update for a lot of scripts, a lot of PPA... a full renew of this project


When trying to install Vaprobash 1.4.2 with PHP 5.6 this error is shown and only PHP 5.5 is installed.
```
Cannot add PPA: 'ppa:ondrej/php5-5.6'.
```

When setting up a new vagrant instance i can no longer install php 5.6 - it fails on the ppa and reverts to 5.5.

Possibly due to the deprecation of ppa:ondrej/php5-5.6? Now have to use the ppa:ondrej/php version which bundles all 3 PHP versions in one.
The problem is weird. I am running vaprobash at my office macs ( 8 macs all runs on sierra ). The problem is when I start the mac at morning and do vagrant up then the sites does not work. Once I ssh to vagrant and check status then I see that nginx is working fine. 

But If I run `sudo service nginx restart` then everything start working fine. 

This is really weird and it's happening to all our machines in the office. 

Any suggession to fix this issue?

Ubuntu now forces all packages to be sign on secure firm, so it can broke old installations.

This PR fix that problem, added new keys from mariadb repository, and set current SO version to avoid install version mistakes.
