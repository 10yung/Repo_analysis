I am running Mac OS Sierra 10.12.6.

When I bring up the vm it errors on creation

I've defined a readiness probe that's supposed to run a shell script as documented in
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes#define-readiness-probes

It works when deployed to GKE, but on kube-solo the pod never transitions to "ready" state. After some debugging, it looks like the script is never executed.

I'm trying to deploy the cockpit container (https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit) to a kube-solo cluster, but can't figure out how to use cockpit's authentication mechanism with kube-solo.

When I deploy to google container engine - I can login to cockpit using the cluster's "admin" username and password which I can look up using `kubectl config view `.

How can I set up equivalent credentials in kube-solo?


Ps. I asked the developers of cockpit: 
https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/issues/6549

and they suggested another workaround - which is to run kube-apiserver with  --insecure-bind-address or --basic-auth-file

but I'm not sure how to do this either 


Something quite peculiar is happening with dashboard / heapster. The graphs stop being rendered after roughly 24h. I have checked the logs of individual pods and I can't see anything unusual. Has anybody else seen this behaviour?

Hi all,

I heard a lot about kubernetes and I wanted to try it. Hence I discovered kube-solo and wanted to use it to learn kubernetes. However, my laptop is behind a corporate firewall, and I can't get kube-solo to work, because corectl is failing, as it can't download coreos images. After I briefly switched to a public network and downloaded things, I was able to start my local kubernetes cluster. However, after I got back to the corporate network, and re-tried the things (Kube-solo -> Up), it hanged at "Waiting for Kubernetes cluster to be ready. This can take a bit..." (I waited one hour...):

```
knezn@mac001 % /Applications/Kube-Solo.app/Contents/Resources/up.command; exit;

```

As far as I can see, there are no logs that could point me to direction why kubernetes are slow to start or hanging.

I have `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` set in my `~/.zshrc` which get sourced anytime kube-solo starts something. However, it seems that no tool used by kube-solo honors those settings. 

Since we're not the only company using proxies (but not in production), and kube-solo is aimed at developer's machines, it would be great if the whole toolset honors proxy settings.
Hi devs!
I'm trying to figure out why kube-solo is not working and I've found that after trying it seems that the HD was not created. I've tried to created and I've received an error about openpgp. Here you can see the details:
```
ksolo start

And here you can see the content of the logfile:

```

What can I do in order to start the VM and start working with kubernetes via kube-solo?

Best,
I was trying to change Docker storage drivers and see if it fixed an issue I had with my application, but when I tried to stop the service with `sudo systemctl stop docker`, I couldn't start it again (`sudo systemctl start docker`). I tracked the issue to the `docker.socket` unit, but couldn't debug further. This issue on Docker looks really similar: https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/25098. Can anyone reproduce this?
