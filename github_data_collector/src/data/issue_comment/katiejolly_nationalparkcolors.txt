I don't have a clear idea at this point but I'm thinking:

- [ ] Use the colorblinding chrome addin to see what the palettes look like for different types of colorblindness
- [ ] Mark in a table in the readme whether or not a palette is safe for the main types of colorblindness

Open to other ideas, too.
Hi Katie, Love your package!! I just added an ability to make the color palette discrete (like your base package) or continuous. Thanks again. You don't have to "accept" the changes if you don't want to.
