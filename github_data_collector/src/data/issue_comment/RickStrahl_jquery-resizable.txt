If I have  table with horizontal scroll, columns are not resizable.
I have opened a pdf file in Chrome in an iframe, and the resizing stops when I drag over it. "pointer-events: none" isn't working.
I also tried to put a transparent absolutely-positioned div over the iframe but the event still doesn't fire.
The only ugly workaround I found was to hide the iframe when the drag starts and show it again when it ends.
Works fine on Firefox and EDGE.

I don't know when I'll have the time to make an example. Maybe in two days.

what if the parent resizes and the splitter goes out of view?
Hi,

I just upgraded from version 0.18.0 to 0.20.0 and my application broke. 
**Error message: .resizable is not a function**
I use CommonJs for internal module import. I imported jQuery without CommonJs from outside:

**index.html**
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Test page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="panel">
    <div id="list"></div>
    <div class="win-size-grip"><i class="fa fa-signal"></i></div>
  </div>

<script>
  <script src="resources/jquery/jquery.js"></script>
  <script src="index.js"></script>
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

**index.js:**
```
(function($) {
 'use strict';

  global.jQuery = $;

  require('myApplication/testEvent');
})(window.$);
```

**testEvent.js**
```
(function($) {
 'use strict';

require('jquery-resizable-dom');

$('#panel').resizable({
            handleSelector: ".win-size-grip",
            onDrag: function(e, $el, newWidth, newHeight) {
                $("#list").height(newHeight - 140).width(newWidth / 2 - 30);
            }
        });

})(window.$);
```

What is the problem? Did I miss something?
When I using version 0.18.0 it is working fine.

Thank you,
Best regards,
Rómeó Nagy
When resized element is centered it should change it's width/height two times faster (on each Drag event).

Looking at the Horizontal Splitter Panes example http://codepen.io/rstrahl/pen/eJZQej

Although the right panel has `min-width: 200px;` set, it seems you can still drag it beyond the minimum width. Is there something I'm missing?
