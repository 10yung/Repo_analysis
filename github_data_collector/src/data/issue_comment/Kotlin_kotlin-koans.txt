Related to #173.

* `build.gradle` file has been removed.
* `build.gradle.kts` file has been added with content equivalent to the former `build.gradle` file.
* ~Gradle wrapper has been upgraded to the current Gradle version 5.2.1 because of better and more stable support of _Kotlin DSL_.~
I'm just wondering - if the project is build by _Gradle_, why not to build it via _Gradle **Kotlin DSL**_? Wouldn't it be more appropriate?

I've already did it in my fork of the project (see [build.gradle.kts](https://github.com/sw-samuraj/kotlin-koans/blob/master/build.gradle.kts)), so I can prepare a pull request.
Add complete tests for before, after, equal for each of the date values year, month, dayOfMonth.
It is very difficult for beginers to understand so please include proper commenting

There seems to be a bug with the test(s) for 
`fun Shop.getNumberOfTimesProductWasOrdered(product: Product): Int`

I've tried the the following two solutions:

Provided solution:
```
fun Shop.getNumberOfTimesProductWasOrdered(product: Product): Int {
    return customers.flatMap { it.getOrderedProductsList() }.count { it == product }
}

fun Customer.getOrderedProductsList(): List<Product> {
    return orders.flatMap { it.products }
}
```

My original solution:
```
fun Shop.getNumberOfTimesProductWasOrdered(product: Product): Int =
    customers.flatMap { it.orders }.flatMap { it.products }.count { it == product }
```

at the following two sites:

- https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/Collections/Compound%20tasks/Task.kt
- https://try.kotlinlang.org/#/Kotlin%20Koans/Collections/Compound%20tasks/Task.kt

and I get 

> Assigning single elements to varargs in named form is forbidden

Just to add, I tried the same solution in the Playground at https://play.kotlinlang.org/ (using the same code from Shop.kt and simplified code from TestShop.kt) and it runs fine, giving the correct result.

I've attached the file with code copied from Playground.
