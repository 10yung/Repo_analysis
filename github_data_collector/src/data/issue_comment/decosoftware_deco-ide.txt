Windows Version of Deco IDE . !!!Please
Is it possible to debug code with break points like VS code?.
When I update to React 16.5.2 and React-Native 0.57.0 the IDE breaks with the following error:
`You are currently running io.js v5.7.0.

    React Native runs on Node 8.3 or newer. There are several ways to         
    upgrade Node.js depending on your preference. 
    nvm:       nvm install 8.3 --reinstall-packages-from=node               
    Homebrew:  brew update && brew upgrade node  
    Installer: download from https://nodejs.org/`

I have Node.js 8.12 installed
Is there something wrong with my Internet?
I am a Chinese developer。
not sure from where deco console is loading the node from, i uninstalled and installed node again, if i run node -v in terminal, it show 10+ version, from where is the 5.7 coming from in deco console, shouldn't it use the current mac terminal?

also the compilation fails, react-native run-ios works like a charm, however in deco i get this:

I’ve been trying to get deco-ide up and running from GH. Did fork and followed all steps on the readme file, but they just don’t work. 
Any interested on stepping forward to help it??
I've current try to port `deco` to windows.
