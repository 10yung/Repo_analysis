just updated to the latest 1.0.2.7 version and now gitee is crashing on launch (the github icons appears and disappears)

running on MacOS high sierra 10.13

on the mac console app i found these logs

```

like the title says, when i press the V on notifications it sometimes causes the main window to close 
tested this on 10.12/10.13

it might be related to when gitee is checking github for updates
instead of pressing the notification to open it and then pressing the V in the main window, we should have an option that opening any notification will also remove it from gitee
testing this on 10.13/10.12
all gitee notifications can't be swiped to the side to dismiss and they have no close buttons
that means that when i open my mac i need to see all the notifications i missed 
also, when you get a notification it closes the main screen
希望可以把通知合併至macOS內建的通知
I just want to switch to my other account, so how can I sign out?

Or if you want, you can implement something like an account manager.
This would be really useful to mute some repos and/or organizations that I am a part of but that don't need to fit into my daily workflow.  I'm guessing others would also find this useful.

Also, just wanna say that I really love Gitee and have been looking for something like it for awhile, so thanks!!
Please do a release for 10.10 
Is it possible to use token instead of account and password here? Thanks.
When using a dual-monitor setup the windows always opens in the main screen
