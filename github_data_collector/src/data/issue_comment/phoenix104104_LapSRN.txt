hello, can I train this code in CPU not GPU?  
if I train it in CPU,which part of code do  I need to  modify? 
And　how many days do I need to train?
thanks for your code.As you mentioned in the paper,the training dataset is t91 and bsd 200.However,the dataset is t91+bsd200+g100...  So ,what is the result for your paper? Is is consist of General 100?
Some thing wrong when I use 3 channel bilinear kernel. Following is the 2 upsampling results and original images.

My init code is followings:

function net = add_USN_noise(net, layername, varname, parname, filter_size, scale)
% --------------------------------------------------------------------
    crop_default = 1;
    stride_default = scale;
    net.addLayer(layername, ...
        dagnn.ConvTranspose('upsample', stride_default,'crop', crop_default,'hasBias',false), ...
        varname{1}, varname{2}, parname);    
    
    f = net.getParamIndex(parname) ;
    filters = single(bilinear_kernel(4,3,3));
    net.params(f).value = filters ;
    net.params(f).learningRate = 1;
    net.params(f).weightDecay  = 1;
    net.params(f).trainMethod = 'adam';
end

Do you have any idea of this problem? Thank you.

Thanks for your code,  I can't reproduce the result with my own model when training the T91 BSDS200 and General100 images. The PSNR of Set5(x4) only 29.7.  but the papers PSNR of Set5(x4) is 31.54. Can you provide some details about the training parameters ? 
How many epoch can be trained to achieve the effect of the paper？
Thank you for your answer.
