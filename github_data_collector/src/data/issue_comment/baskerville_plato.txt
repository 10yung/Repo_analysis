I've noticed when I define words in a pdf, they are often just one "Levenshtein" away from a dictionary entry (e.g. the pluralization of "credence" → "credences"). Fuzzy search is a great solution for this, but the "fuzzy" option does not  stay enabled after it has been used. 

Given that a Levenshtein distance of ≤ 1 is fairly conservative and will only rarely result in a false positive, I propose to make an configurable option to have fuzzy search on by default. (I wonder what has higher probability: getting a false positive from the dictionary, or users searching for words that are just one "Levenshtein" away. Plurals definitely seem to be common). I'm not 100% sure if this is a good idea in practice, however. 

First of all — that you for your reader! It is much cleaner and faster than internal Kobo's one. It should become the standard one, hands down!

I was wondering is there any chance of adding FB2 support? It is rather simple XML format with no DRM. And quite popular in among Cyrillic readers.

Could it become possible in one of upcoming versions?

Many thanks in advance!
Enabling together "Invert Colors" and "Make Bitonal" glitches, only one half is bitonal and the other half has it's colors inverted.

Hi,
Just a feature description I would like to see one day
Koreader uses an interesting way to sync progress across devices, I guess it would be great for plato

https://github.com/koreader/koreader/wiki/Progress-sync

And the selfhostable server

https://github.com/koreader/koreader-sync-server

Koreader host their own server, for users without any sysadmin knowledge


Once again, thanks for your great job !
Hi

One great feature Koreader has is the ability to access OPDS libraries, do you plan to add such a feature ?

Thank for your work, once again
Beforehand, thank you for a great software. Compiles clean, installs clean, smooth. My favorite reader on the kobo glo HD.

Applications are also great. 'Sketch' is very useful, and works better than an equivalent on my iphone 7+!

Was wondering: do you plan on adding new applications?
A reversi for instance ...?

Could try to make one myself, even if I'd have to translate my c++ knowledge to rust... which requires some time!


It would be great to have thumbnail previews in the book list (as in nickel, I guess it is a reduced version of the first page).
a big **Thank you** to @baskerville for plato and other great contributions to free software. Thanks again.

I would like to know if you are going to support translations anytime soon. Not a big deal to have the ui in english but it would be great.
