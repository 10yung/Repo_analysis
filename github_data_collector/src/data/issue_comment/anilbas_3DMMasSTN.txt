 I have read your paper but I don't understand  â€˜ computing the Tutte embedding with conformal Laplacian weights for UV graph'   that you mentioned in your paper .Could you kindly share the code ?  Or just give me some advice about it ?And I try to use matlab's Toolbox Graph,but my result is very different from yous

Thanks for your work and codes.
I can't find the imdb.mat file in this demo, can you provide the download link or tell me how to generate this file?
Thanks~
hi @anilbas,
Thank you for your contribution!
I followed your readme to run the code,but I can't run the training code.Could you please give me some advice on the questions below?
In dagnn_3dmmasstn_init.m line 7. This xavier(1,1,4096,16) should be the algorithm that initializes the network weight, but I run the prompt without definition.
Thanks in advance!
Hello,

Thanks for the awesome work! I'm a complete noob in the 3d modelling world so a lot of things fly over my head unfortunately. Please can you tell me how you produced "geometry.png". Is there some code i could look at to help me get that geometry image. I'm trying to produce it by looking at your current code but no luck. 
Hi, Anil
What's your label of training data looks like? It is the same as the label in demodata.mat?

thanks very much
