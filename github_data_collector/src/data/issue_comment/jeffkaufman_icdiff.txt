The test

    check_git_diff gitdiff-only-newlines.txt 4e86205629~1 4e86205629

assumes that it's run in the icdiff git repository, which is not always the case. It assumes a repository to already exist, sets configuration options, and refers to certain commits.

I'm maintaining icdiff for Alpine Linux, where the project is part of the aports repository, and we build from source archives. In those circumstances, the current git repo is aports, not icdiff, which it then also modifies (git config). The tests obviously fails.

It would be better to create a small repository with known contents and run the tests in there (similar how git tests itself).

Another issue is that it runs `git difftool --extcmd icdiff` before exporting `pwd` to `PATH`, causing the command to fail.
Handling errors there makes sure that actions influencing error reporting apply for both direct calls of the `icdiff` script as well as via entrypoints.

Addresses my comment on #156.
It keeps reinstalling 1.9.4 
It might be nice to use https://github.com/holman/spaceman-diff if available to display image diffs
diff provides `-i` option to ignore case-only differences. It would be great to have that option in icdiff as well. 
```

[diff]
  color = auto
  tool = icdiff

[difftool "icdiff"]
      cmd = /usr/local/bin/icdiff -r -IF '.*(pbgo|pbdoc|pbswagger|pbcpp|lock)' --strip-trailing-cr --line-numbers $LOCAL $REMOTE


```
As a user of the program I would like to run the program with a flag, that displays all supported encodings, such that I can choose the right one easier.
Colors can be now specified via environment variable `ICDIFF_COLORS` using the same format as in command line.
Hi, I wanted to have a man page for icdiff so I created one by manually converting the usage message and other info from the README. I've decided to share this with you, so that you maybe could include it in the project.

Unfortunately I couldn't yet find a proper way, to get setuptools to automatically add the file to the machine's manpath.

The file can be rendered by running `man ./icdiff.1` after cloning the repository locally.
`icdiff` is great!
But do we have any plans to expose the APIs like [`difflib`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/difflib.html)?
