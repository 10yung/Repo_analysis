Hi, I am trying to use a custom handle that has a drag event drag item created with PlainDraggable (https://anseki.github.io/plain-draggable/). Do you have an idea as how I could bind the drag of the slider with the drag of the item?

Here is a basic slider with a custom handle and the draggable item.

Thanks
iPhone 8+ iOS13.3 Safari: PrevNext Buttons change z-index when swiping  

When I use wrapAround = true, pageDots = false, the z-index of the previous/next buttons changes whenever I swipe left or right. The result is that the buttons hide behind the slides temporarily. This creates a choppy visual effect as the buttons appear & disappear. 
I know this topic has already been discussed, but I couldn't find any solution to fix it. 
Flickity works like a charm to me, by enabling the option `watchCSS: true` and using media queries. The only problem I've got is about dots: the number of dots (according to groupCells) is not refreshed after resizing / changing device's orientation. It is correct only at initialization.
Flickity is breaking when route is changing

Hello,
Is it possible to disable draggable on a specific cell? Rather than the whole carousel as with (draggable: false).

I have some content that will go inside only one of the cells that have their own drag operations and currently the Flickity carousel is overriding them.
Thanks
It looks like dragMove and dragEnd are both called on dragEnd in iOS 13.
previousDragX and dragX become the same value because of the dragMove call.
dragEndBoostSelect when called, evaluates to zero.

This primitive solution only reassigns previousDragX when dragX is changing.

Code was working fine till all of the sudden we have the CSS & JS blocked. Checked console and here's the error: 

The resource from “https://unpkg.com/flickity@2/dist/flickity.pkgd.min.js?ver=dist” was blocked due to MIME type (“text/html”) mismatch (X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff)

Could you advise we should do?
Using 'Fade', 'Wrap Around' and 'Auto Play' together when only 2 items exist in the slider causes a visual bug when transitioning between slides. Test case provided below. The issue rectifies itself when more than two slides exist.

It's a very specific use case, but never the less is still a problem that should be fixed. I don't have the means to look into this myself, so hoping the greater community can pose a suggestion/fix.

Hi!
I was looking for a library to help me making a little image carousel, with autoplaying. I was not satisfied with bootstrap's one, and a friend told me about Flickity. I wanted to have a carousel that autoplays, without arrows, without dots, and most importantly that does not pause on each slide. I managed to get really close to what I wanted with free scroll, autoplay, draggable, etc, but unfortunately, afaik, Flickity does not support "not pausing on each slide".

So this is my suggestion: add an option like `pauseOnSlides: boolean` or `continousScrolling: boolean` or something like that.

What do you think of it ? is it doable and will it be added?
Thanks!
(Sorry for my English ^^)
All slides are set to `aria-hidden="true"` after destroying carousel. This is not necessarily the state I want. In my particular use cases I'm only using the carousel on small screens. I want all my slides visible at once on large screens, so if I destroy on a resize event, the aria-hidden attribute is incorrect.
