Hi, thanks for this open source project. Like it so far but cannot get some wanted behavior. 
I want to use single circular bar for multiple cases, or dynamically change its **current progress**. 
But, as soon as I start animation there is no way to reset it to another value to start new animation. 

For example I tried to start animation from **0.6 to 0 in 600** seconds.
After some user progress, I want to reset animation without waiting it to finish all 10 minutes, for example, to **progress 0.8 and animate to 0** in 300 seconds.
But it just starts from previous animation last position and resets timer to 300 even if very small portion left, it divides that portion into.. 300 seconds. 
Im trying to set its inital value too, not only duration.

 I tried so far
```swift
popupProgressCircle.progress = 0.8 // Doesnt work if animation in progress
popupProgressCircle.set(progress: 0.8, duration: 0)  // Also doesnt work if animation in progress
popupProgressCircle.set(progress: 0.8, duration: 0.000001) // This just breaks everything, may be because next part is called immediately, and code execution is faster than 0.000001

popupProgressCircle.set(progress: 0, duration: 300) // This works, but because of above part doesnt work, it is just making  slower and slower every attempts remaining part
```
So I want to achieve - either reset/stop animation in order to safely set new progress value, or just set progress value and it is automatically stops all current animations.
On top of that, there is no way to check if any animation is currently ongoing without waiting progress delegate~ But its just minor issue

Using Swift 5.1 and XCode 11.
