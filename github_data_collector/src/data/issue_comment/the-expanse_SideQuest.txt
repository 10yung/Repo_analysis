Noticed this today setting up github releases. Looks like a pagination issue. I can't scroll in this dropdown either. I went into dev console and confirmed it's only loading these repos.

Maybe even with an IP entry field if it has changed/never connected before. It should skip the `adb tcpip 5555` part and just attempt the `adb connect <IP_address>` to gain a connection without having to connect the headset. This could still fail if the headset has restarted but could prove useful in a lot of cases. 
Drag-and-dropping apk files from the Windows explorer to the SideQuest window: this is often painful in SideQuest v0.8.4.  Most of the times the message "Drop files here!" does not appear and dropping the file does nothing.  I found out that if you aim precisely for the "connection status" green/red dot in the top-left corner, then it works as expected.  It also works if you aim for the status bar, provided there is one visible now.

What I expect is that it should work if you drop the file anywhere in the SideQuest window.
Since you can get device information through adb,
it should be possible to remove the restriction of having only 1 android device running while using SideQuest.
Would be helpful to have a [chocolatey installation package](https://chocolatey.org/) for sidequest. Would make installation easier, since a lot of software is reachable through that installer.

Sidequest is great - although with the large number of new apps being offered and updated, it would be benefitial if in the "Currently Installed Apps" section, that the version of the APK is included in the listing. 
Many apps / games cannot be backed up or resorted with SideQuest but can via `adb backup` & `adb restore` as described here. https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/ej46ar/psa_how_to_backup_restore_save_games_that/

Would be great to have an option in SideQuest to facilitate this method so users (especially inexperienced or non-technical ones) donâ€™t have to use the more complicated command line methods.
make the app full screen size when you open it. 
Hello everyone, I would like a new filter to list only the games/apps with selected compatible device... Oculus Go or Oculus Quest or Gear VR...

Thank you!
make an adb command preset possible so users can input a set of commands and save them in sidequest, for example these commands to record at a better resolution and better quality: 

```
    adb shell "setprop debug.oculus.capture.width 1536"
    adb shell "setprop debug.oculus.capture.height 1536"
    adb shell "setprop debug.oculus.capture.bitrate 160000000"
    adb shell "setprop debug.oculus.foveation.level 0"
    adb shell "setprop debug.oculus.foveation.usev2 1"
```

you could then just run all of them at the click of a button

EDIT: I am referring to the adb commands section with wifi adb and things like that
