CocoaPods 1.0 support - Drop the deprecated `exclusive` flag from Podfile

I just trying to run the sample app and facing a problem with the Podfile - Just need to remove a deprecated flag from the Podfile and now the pods installing fine.

Thanks,

There is no documentation in the code.  And the README is pretty lean.

It's hard to know what values to provide to the properties of the spring.  Ie, what are the units of the values.  Eg, how should I be determining velocity for the spring?

While using RBBSpringAnimation I noticed that movement was quite jerky in the initial phases of the spring animation.

To combat this I increased the "sampling rate" specified in RBBAnimation's values method from 60 to 120.  Eg:

```
- (NSArray *)values {
    RBBAnimationBlock block = [self.animationBlock copy];

    CFTimeInterval duration = self.duration;

    return [RBBBlockBasedArray arrayWithCount:(NSUInteger)(duration * 120) block:^id(NSUInteger idx) {
        return block(idx / 120.0f, (CGFloat)duration);
    }];
}
```

The results seem to be smoother animations.

I'm not a math/signal processing whiz but I think this is an example of the [Nyquist rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_rate).

Perhaps this could be made a property on RBBSpringAnimation.  As in some situations I think 60 would be fine but others a higher value is going to produce smoother results.

Not sure whether this is animation's or Apple's fault but if you attach a RBBSpringAnimation to an AVPlayerLayer weird stuff happens. Same animation works fine everywhere else.

This adds `RBBRubberbandAnimation`, which is an alternative to `RBBSpringAnimation` and `CASpringAnimation` that is optimized for `CGPoint` animations and correctly handles the `velocity` paramter, even if ∆x or ∆y are 0.

``` objc
RBBRubberbandAnimation *rubberband = [RBBRubberbandAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@"position"];

rubberband.from = CGPointMake(0, 0);
rubberband.to = CGPointMake(0, 0);
rubberband.mass = 1;
rubberband.damping = 10;
rubberband.stiffness = 100;
rubberband.velocity = CGPointMake(400, 0);
```

`RBBSpringAnimation` will remain as an alternative to `CASpringAnimation`.

The current naive implementation performs poorly for overdamped oscillations.
