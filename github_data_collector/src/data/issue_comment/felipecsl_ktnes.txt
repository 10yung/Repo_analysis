Hi,

Since this app is Apache 2 licensed, are you considering the fact to add it to [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)? There is a strong community behind.

You can find some documentation [here](https://f-droid.org/docs/).

Otherwise, if you don't want to work on the inclusion of this app by yourself, would it be ok for you if someone else do it for you?
See discussion on #11 and https://github.com/SourMesen/Mesen/commit/4d96c1333467272bcd4927f59d37144cab92ea87 for an example implementation on Mesen
Can you post apks when you update your app so mobile users can get this emulator easier.

Is this coming to Google Play?

And can it load headerless roms like the Mesen emulator

Sorry if this is in the wrong section, I'm new to GitHub
So that we can't accidentally save game A and restore into game B
