I opted-in and got my resume but it won't let me share. It says user not found. 


It looks like the project list is not sorted by stars, what is it sorted by?

Thank you for this awesome project!

I noticed that my GitHub resume did not list repos to which I had push access. 
- My resume link - http://resume.github.io/?sudo-suhas
- Unlisted repos:
  - https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig
  - https://github.com/booleanapp/elastic-muto

I checked the [relevant GitHub documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-user-repositories) and it has a query parameter to request all repos. This will include repos of which I am either 'owner' or 'member'.

This PR adds the query parameter to the API request. I was able to confirm the behavior with GET API requests:
- Default type - 'owner' - https://api.github.com/users/sudo-suhas/repos
- Type - 'all' - https://api.github.com/users/sudo-suhas/repos?type=all

I have not tested this locally but I am reasonably confident that this should work.
Information is a non-countable noun so it should say just "information", not information_s_. :-)
Since this only uses public data, I see no reason this app should require opt-in. Why do we need anyone's permission to publish _already public data_?
