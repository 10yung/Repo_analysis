hello  thank you for your project, and i found a bug when i run demo on my phone not simlulator. shorter to say that the memory increase with a high speed . i alloc 5 gif instances - -  unfortunately,the memory has been over 200MB



IOS7.1    OKï¼Ÿ

Support set animation repeat count.

When refreshing the image view's image when the view is not showing, I used
[view performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(setImage:) withObject:[UIImage imageWithData:imageData] waitUntilDone:NO];
But still crashed, Xcode reports:
This application is modifying the autolayout engine from a background thread, which can lead to engine corruption and weird crashes.  This will cause an exception in a future release.
