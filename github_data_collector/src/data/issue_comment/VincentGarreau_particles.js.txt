How can I make particles.js work so that when I change pages in my website, the particles background does not refresh from page to page? I just want the content on the page to refresh. 
Hi, I really like this project and was wondering whether it could be made into a cross platform screensaver?

Thank you!
Getting a crash when I call destroy, then use the same element to create Particles again.
pJSDom should be set to empty array, instead of null, to prevent null reference on 2nd time through on line 1517 at `pJSDom.push(new pJS(tag_id, params));`
Hi I’ve never coded before but I’m using elementor and Wordpress to build a website and I’m trying to change the particles to images, I’ve uploaded the image to imgur and am using that url under particles - image and have set the particle type to image. The particles show up as all the different types other than the image. Is there a way to resolve this? 
I am aware of the way of destroying particles as described in #63 
After destroying, it is not possible anymore to initialize and start particles because of the error ```TypeError: Cannot read property 'push' of null ```

Codesandbox example: https://codesandbox.io/s/quirky-black-yc3fg

How to reproduce: 
1. click on start button to start the particles (everything is okay)
2. click on destroy button to destroy the particles (everything is okay)
3. click on start button to start the particles again (not working)
We had ParticlesJS working @ https://digital.insightdesign.com.au/, overlaying the full width/height image slider.

However, it stopped working today with no changes made to the site.

The console says: Uncaught ReferenceError: particlesJS is not defined

We are calling:

`<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/particles.js/2.0.0/particles.min.js" defer data-deferred="1"></script>`

There are no resources generating a 404, and no other JS errors in console.

Help appreciated.
I choose a GIF as my particle image, but it doesn't play on chrome.
hi guys ... 
how to add particle.js library into joomla website???
please answer .. 
After installing this package via npm, how can I import it to my .js file? I want to load it from node_modules.

`import 'particles.js'` does not work.
I have to copy `particles.js` to my folder like this:
```
node_modules/
  particles.js/
    particles.js
src/
  js/
    myfile.js
    particles.js // copied from above
```
then: `import './particles.js'` and now it works, but it's very inconvenience.
Hello, I wanted to know if it possible to make particles rotate on theirselves ? Not only a single rotation but I want it to rotate constantly, because when you put square and triangle,  it isn't beautiful. Thanks for help.
