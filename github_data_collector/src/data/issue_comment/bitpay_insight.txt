If someone has a balance showing for BCH in a blockchain.info wallet, but that same wallet and TX does not show on bitpay's explorer https://insight.bitpay.com/, what could be the cause(s) of this? (i.e. proprietary wallet format unique to bitpay or BCH cannot be searched on the above link?) Thanks
P.s. the BCH explorer listed in this page doesn't work (returns handshake error) https://blog.bitpay.com/bitcoin-cash-insight/

Unable to get details on whether this transaction in other places. Any idea how to resole this issue?
BTC.com have supported LTC mining pool, our pool URL's [https://docs.pool.btc.com/](https://pool.btc.com).
API link: [https://docs.pool.btc.com/](https://docs.pool.btc.com/)
I am currently working on a specification for on-chain aliases that look like this: James#5721; to help convey payment information in a more convenient manner, particulary in verbal contexts.

Here's a link to the draft spec: https://gitlab.com/cash-accounts/specification/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md

Would the insight server be a good place to add support for looking up such aliases?
I've successful installed the explorer and it's running now, but it's very slow, even on insight official page it takes like 3~8 seconds to load an address info as you can see on this page:

Is it really this slow? It's almost useless... Any alternative?
