- Where functions signatures specified arg of type `*const c_char`, the data is
  sent here everywhere as `CString`, while `options_json` was passed as `*const i8`,
  causing that sometime, a random character were added to end of this string, making
  it invalid JSON and eventually throwing `serde_json::Error` then converted into
  `WalletStorageError::ConfigError`.
- Sometimes when running tests with `DatabasePerWallet` strategy, one test expects
  that a wallet with name `walle1` does not exist before it's supposedly destroyed
  at cleanup, but when the test attempts to create this wallet, it fails on
  `WalletAlreadyExistsError`. Adding `1`ms delay at the end of testing function `_cleanup()`
 solved this issue.
- Add some error logging on failures before a specific error is mapped into
  a more generic error such as `WalletStorageError`.

MultiWalletSingleTable Postgres wallet has default DB name 'Wallets'. This allows the name to be configured during wallet creation, open and delete as well as when init'ing the storage type.

This replaces my previous PR https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1979
