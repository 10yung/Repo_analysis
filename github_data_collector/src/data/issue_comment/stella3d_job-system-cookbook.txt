Such as:

```
Library/PackageCache/com.unity.properties@0.1.14-preview.2/Editor/Serialization/Generation/CSharpGenerationBackend.cs(9,24): error CS0234: The type or namespace name 'Serialization' does not exist in the namespace 'Unity.Properties' (are you missing an assembly reference?)
```

The easiest fix seems to be to remove the Entities package and add the Mathematics package manually.

Hi, Than I added new field in PositionUpdateJob struct [https://github.com/stella3d/job-system-cookbook/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/AccelerationParallelFor.cs](url) line36 the —Åubes stopped moving. My code:

    ```struct PositionUpdateJob : IJobParallelForTransform
    {
        [ReadOnly]
        public NativeArray<Vector3> velocity;  // the velocities from AccelerationJob

        [ReadOnly]
        public Transform[] trans; // here

        public float deltaTime;
        
        public void Execute(int i, TransformAccess transform)
        {
            //trans[i].LookAt(Camera.main.transform.position);

            transform.position += velocity[i] * deltaTime;
        }
    }```


Hi
I am working with VR projects and I am very interested in learning C# Job System and Burst Compiler to use them in my own VR ones to optimize PC 3D Assets and Performance for VR devices ( mainly Oculus Quest), for it, Could you add any VR examples to this repo?
Thanks for your time

solved by this
https://talk.olab.io/t/get-errors-when-grabbing-webcamtextures-color-information-into-color32/654/4

More specifically by inserting this in the Update method
 if (!isInitialized && m_CamTexture.didUpdateThisFrame)
        {
            m_Data = new Color32[m_CamTexture.width * m_CamTexture.height];
            m_NativeColors = new NativeArray<Color32>(m_Data, Allocator.Persistent);
            isInitialized = true;
        }
        else if (isInitialized && m_CamTexture.didUpdateThisFrame) {
....//rest of Update code
}
Is there a way to work with Unity3d on  Windows 10, version 1803

I can open it but i am not able to open cloned project, it crash an says: 

> The project is on case sensitive file system. Case sensitive file systems are not supported at the moment. Please move the project folder to a case insensitive file system.

**Solve problem**:
1. Delete cloning repo.
2. Open PowerShell{Admin}, create new folder and go there
3. Check folder on Case sensitive file system:
`fsutil.exe file queryCaseSensitiveInfo C:\my folder `
IF "Case sensitive attribute on directory  C:\my folder is disabled" 
THEN go to step 4
ELSE you need manualy change all files in cloning repo with command:
`fsutil.exe file setCaseSensitiveInfo C:\folder\filename disable`
4. Clone repo in new folder
5. Profit

line 36: "we can't use bools in NativeArray<T>, since the type must be blittable"
Could byte's or short's be used instead of int's to reduce memory usage?
