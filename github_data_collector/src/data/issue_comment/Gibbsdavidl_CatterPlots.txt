Not sure if this is the ideal implementation, but I've been using this workaround to allow for custom x-axis and y-axis ticks. 

```
x <- -10:10
y <- -x^2 + 10

meow <- multicat(
    xs = x, 
    ys = y,
    cat = c(1,2,3), 
    catcolor = list('#33FCFF','#FF0000'), 
    canvas = c(-0.1,1.1, -0.1, 1.1), 
    xat = seq(-10, 10, by = 5), 
    yat = seq(-100, 10, by = 50)
    );
```
How can I use my own kitty's face as catterplot points?? 
...would be awesome!
Please add more! :joy_cat: :joy_cat: :joy_cat:
