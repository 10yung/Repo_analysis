Hi,

Not sure if anyone is familiar with running the Splash-2 benchmarks. (Repo is Splash 3 but it is Splash 2 with the patches).

Below is the link to the repo I am working off of to test this out for performance. Splash-2 provides a makefile and my struggle is getting the CMakeLists file to basically do what Splash-2's make file is doing.

Is there a way to run the splash-2 make file from the CMakeLists? Or should I try to configure something inside of ${SOURCES} by just putting EVERY file needed by Splash 2 into one directory??

Thanks for your help!
The vagrant box does not support vmware; it only supports virtualbox.

If a different box is chosen, then either vagrant provider can be used.

For instance, this is the error that I get (since I do not have virtualbox installed):

```
$ vagrant up
Bringing machine 'IncludeOS' up with 'vmware_desktop' provider...
==> IncludeOS: Box 'ubuntu/bionic64' could not be found. Attempting to find and install...
    IncludeOS: Box Provider: vmware_desktop, vmware_fusion, vmware_workstation
    IncludeOS: Box Version: >= 0
==> IncludeOS: Loading metadata for box 'ubuntu/bionic64'
    IncludeOS: URL: https://vagrantcloud.com/ubuntu/bionic64
The box you're attempting to add doesn't support the provider
you requested. Please find an alternate box or use an alternate
provider. Double-check your requested provider to verify you didn't
simply misspell it.

If you're adding a box from HashiCorp's Vagrant Cloud, make sure the box is
released.

Name: ubuntu/bionic64
Address: https://vagrantcloud.com/ubuntu/bionic64
Requested provider: ["vmware_desktop", "vmware_fusion", "vmware_workstation"]
```
This makes SMP always-on, makes the RNG shared and makes the SMP worker code platform independent.
There are some things cropping up that gets annoying after a while:

Chainloader spams like crazy, even though it shouldn't be saying anything at all. Indeed, if you build qemu without the "Oh no, it's a 64-bit ELF check," you can boot without the chainloader at all.

The bridge needs to be setup before you can even run boot:
https://github.com/includeos/IncludeOS/issues/2173

If you write a bogus network driver name you get a silent exit from vmrunner, even with -v.

The incantation to create a build folder is getting long:
```
mkdir -p build
pushd build
conan install .. -pr clang-6.0-linux-x86_64
source activate.sh
cmake ..
popd
```


This PR let's you schedule normal threads automatically to free vCPUs. If you create a normal thread on another CPU, it will not get delegated, unless you enable automatic migration there as well. Automatic migration is in other words PER-CPU. Each CPU can have its own decision making regarding potential thread migration.


I am attempting to compile the hello_world example following the instructions in the wiki, on a Fedora installation. I have installed all the listed dependencies. I am running the following command: `conan install ../hello_world -pr gcc-9.2.1-linux-x86_64 --build`
With the corresponding conan profile:
```
[build_requires]
binutils/2.31@includeos/toolchain
[settings]
os=Linux
os_build=Linux
arch=x86_64
arch_build=x86_64
compiler=gcc
compiler.version=9.2
compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
cppstd=17
build_type=Release
[options]
[env]
CC=/usr/bin/gcc
CXX=/usr/bin/g++
CFLAGS=-msse3 -mfpmath=sse -O2 -g
CXXFLAGS=-msse3 -mfpmath=sse -O2 -g
```
Which gives the following error:
```

When I copy out the cmake command, and remove the '-j4' flag, I get a bunch of syntax errors:

I am currently using a newer version of gcc than the instructions (9.2.1), could that have something to do with it? Any help would be appreciated!
Trying to get the time it takes for a program to run, but having no luck within the simulator. First image is the program being ran in IncludeOS and second image is showing results when ran outside IncludeOS. Any ideas why the timer isn't working inside IncludeOS?

When I run IncludeOS on qemu and use RTC::now() the time returned is always the boot time, it seems like __arch_wall_clock() is not updating either tv_sec or tv_nsec. __arch_system_time() does return incrementing values. Am I doing something wrong here? What can I do to further debug the issue?

```
#include <os>

    printf("RTC::boot_timestamp %lu\n", RTC::boot_timestamp());
    printf("RTC::nanos_now %lu\n", RTC::nanos_now());
    printf("arch_wall_clock().tv_sec %lu\n", __arch_wall_clock().tv_sec);
    printf("arch_wall_clock().tv_nsec %lu\n", __arch_wall_clock().tv_nsec);
    printf("ctime %lu\n", time(0));
  });
}
