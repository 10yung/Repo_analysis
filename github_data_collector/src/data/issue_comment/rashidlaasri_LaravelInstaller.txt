Let's add this for avoid error in local setup!
If you install https://github.com/BePsvPT/secure-headers

it breaks :
```
Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self' 'report-sample' 'sha256-8bLztrDF3NUpheSuvAzpebgX1DpPJEfhmUHKTwGF4qA='". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-Q3bUuBSAWh0O1CpiRKNTeMH7SoUlbiSyS/jupbEdWLY='), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution.

wizard:1 Refused to send form data to 'http://example.com/install/environment/saveWizard' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "form-action 'none'".
```

There are no elements on the page with ids close_alert and error_alert
after installation wizard finished .

i got this error :

Hi everyone,
i noticed a problem with the installer working on localhost.
It works fine only if after saving .env details I stop and restart the application. 
If I try to go ahead after saving the details for the connection I'll receive:
**SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] Connection refused (SQL: select * from information_schema.tables where table_schema = homestead and table_name = migrations)**
.env file is updated but the procedure continue to use the old data.
Any solution for it?
Thanks :)
