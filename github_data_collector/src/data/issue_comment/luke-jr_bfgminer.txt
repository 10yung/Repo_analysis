hi i buyed a  new future bit miner moon lander2 scrypt miner i set the pool info correct but it says that cannot reach the pool trying in 15 seconds iam from aisa help me plz i cannot mine
Keep running into this issue, I found a work around a couple days ago but it was super late into the night and can't exactly remember all the steps I took. When running bfg/moonlander start I get this error

Failed to sanity check in lowl-vcom.com. c windows_usb_get_string():508
Every time that I open bfgminer and type in my pool url (I am using Slush's Pool) my user name and my passcode it looks like it is going to load but then bfgminer closes. I am running bfgminer-4.3.0-win32
just merging
Current url was 404'ing. Found new [url](http://fpgamining.com/documentation/firmware.html) with the `x6500-overclocker-0402.bit` bitstream.
I have spent two days now reading posts and trying different stuff to get this working and still stuck..  lol  
  I am trying to run a small stable of s9 miners for solo mining on my own full node.  I realize chances are slim to none on mining a block.   Any help would be greatly appreciated! Willing to tip! 

Here are the errors I keep getting
Pool 1 slow/down or URL or credentials invalid
 [2019-03-19 18:48:05] Pool 0 slow/down or URL or credentials invalid
 [2019-03-19 18:48:05] No servers were found that could be used to get work from.
 [2019-03-19 18:48:05] Please check the details from the list below of the servers you have input
 [2019-03-19 18:48:05] Most likely you have input the wrong URL, forgotten to add a port, or have not set up workers

Here is what I have so far but I have tried SO many different things
bfgminer -o stratum+tcp://localhost:8332 -u test -p test --stratum-port=3333 -S bitmain:auto --set btm:model=S9 --no-longpoll
pause

here is the bitcoin config
server=1
rpcuser=test
rpcpassword=test
rpcallowip=192.168.1.1
rpcport=8332
listen=1
daemon=1
gen=0

I found if I put a bitcoin.conf in the AppData/Roaming/bitcoin folder that BFGminer starts a second pool.  Tried so many things to get this working..  Thanks for any help!

I'm getting this message from time to time. I'm running under Windows 10 on a *very* slow system. I tried different versions of bfgminer. It happens in 4.8, 5.0 and 5.5.
The system stops as it would be an error.
Any idea what to do about it?
hello. i'm new at mining but running into some problems. i am running bfgminer 5.5.0 on osx with a gridseed orb. i'm unsure of why it keeps crashing.

`bfgminer -S noauto -S gridseed:all  -Q:1000 --set-device gridseed:clock=800 --scrypt -o stratum+tcp://us.litecoinpool.org:3333 -u davidjames212.1 -p 1`

i'll take all the assistance i can get:)


I am working on developing a multi-protocol miner FPGA using Xilinx Ultrascale.
Is there some documentation on how I can use BFGMiner to manage this custom setup?
i.e. 

1. How auto detection works.
2. The functions called by the S/W to assign work to devices and to monitor progress.
3. Etc. Etc. Etc.

I am figuring out if any version of bfgminer is able to support Avalon 4.1/ A6. I find the two Avalons are not listed on the README of the bfgminer. Have any of you try on that?
