I want to know the meaning about the drug_drug matrix.I don't understand the 0 and 1 in the matrix.Thanks a lot!
Hello，Professor luo. The third line of  \DTINet-master\src\leml-imf\src\python\train_mf.py, which writes "import __train_mf as c_train_mf". How can I get _train_mf.py. 
Dear Yunan,

I was wondering what is the output of the DTINet. Is it only AUROC and AUPR?
Can we have Prediction scores of drug–protein interactions (XZY<sup>T</sup>) as an output? Is it the mean Z-score following train_mf ?

Thanks a lot!
