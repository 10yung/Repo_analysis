I just discovered Eve. When I go to play.witheve.com it says "Hello, world" on the right-hand side. But when I press the run button, it just disappears. Even though I did not change anything and the checkbox for the hello world code is ticked. I tried deleting the cookies, did not work.
I'm trying to figure out where the database is within this codebase and it appears to be tightly integrated with the DSL... Is that true? Can someone point me to the right place and maybe give a little explainer about how the Eve database works?

P.S. I've been enjoying reading through the [`level-fact-base`](https://github.com/smallhelm/level-fact-base). Curious about similarities.
I got scared by the commit https://github.com/witheve/Eve/commit/005c4787699ad4afdc6eec4bd0eb6cf7cb0d8d97 telling Eve 0.3 alpha won't be developed any further.

What's the current project status and how will/could the future look like? Any plans?
I wanted to play around with Eve a bit for fun since the language sounded interesting and if nothing else it's one of the most impressive esoteric programming languages I've seen so far.

Although when I pulled up the quickstart guide, I quickly ran into problems.

First, when I clicked the checkbox in the top-right of the second code block, the entire display on the right disappeared. The "Hello, World" text was gone. Hitting the run button at the top of the page didn't fix it, although hitting the reset button brought back the "Hello, World" text.

Upon clicking the checkbox in the top-right of the third code block, the "Hello, World" disappeared once more. Once more the run button did nothing. However clicking the reset button **only** displayed the text "Hello, world" -- not the "Ciao, world" that I now expected since a record exists with the name attribute.

I tried to use the inspector to figure out what was going on, but the quick start didn't make it obvious at all how to use this tool. I can click in the large gray expanse and my only option is "not drawing?" -- which does nothing but highlight the two lines of code which should be adding `div`s to the page. I can also click on the "Hello, world" text and I get four options: "Find events", "Why this?", "Too few? Too many?", and "Not drawing?". Clicking any of these just redirects me to the first block of code. There's no obvious way to see the current database state to verify the `[name: "Celia"]` record even exists.

After a significant amount of aggravation, I tried adding the commit statement to the first code block:

    bind @browser
      [tag: "div", text: "Hello, world"]
    
    commit
      [name: "Celia"]

When I did this and hit the reset button, suddenly "Ciao, world" appeared! It seemed at first as though the order of code matters (which from my understanding shouldn't be the case with Eve)

However I then tried enabling the fourth code block (which should print "Hello, Celia") and something even stranger happened: "Hello, world" went away and I was left with only a single "Ciao, world" line. Repeatedly enabling and disabling this button had no additional effect, but hitting the reset button brought back the "Hello, world" message. After bringing back the message, toggling the fourth code block again (to either enable OR disable it) once again broke the display by removing "Hello, world"

After all of this, I finally noticed that the run button was now doing something. After resetting, the display showed both "Hello, world" and "Ciao, world". If I then hit run, "Hello, world" goes away. I then have to hit "reset" again to bring it back.

I then noticed one more oddity: I now tried unchecked EVERY code block (including the first) and hitting "reset". The display then showed both "Hello, world" and "Ciao, world" -- even though no code blocks were checked.

I refreshed the page and performed the same procedure and verified that this functionality was reproducible for me every time. I even tried in an incognito tab so my extensions and cache would have no effect.
Hello,
 Under the heading **Some examples**, the second sentence has a misprint. Change "in this this manner," to "in this manner," to correct. Thank you. Good day.

In TodoMVC, if you create two Todos, double-click one to edit, then while in editing mode click the toogle-all button, it breaks - both elements become hidden and stay that way, even while moving between tabs.

For your information and action.

When playing with [eve quickstart](http://play.witheve.com/#/examples/quickstart.eve) I noticed that disabled code blocks aren't becoming enabled when clicking the checkbox at the top right. Looking at the **SENT** blocks in the developer panel I see `eve disabled`, but they seem to work when I edit them and then enable them.
In the version deployed at http://play.witheve.com/#/examples/quickstart.eve the hover text for sidebar expand/collapse button is reversed. Look through the repo for the offending code but could not find it.
