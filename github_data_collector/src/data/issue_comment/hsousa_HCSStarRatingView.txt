Due to this issue I am unable to submit this app to App store.
I hope this library could support other event instead of only ValueChanged. It help we build better UI/UX. When user swipe their finger over the rating bar, we can display a description for each value:
1. Oops! too bad
2. Not good enough
3. Good
.... and so on

That is my idea.

Hello, 

First, thanks for sharing this library with us, it's really great. 
I'm facing a problem which my tap gesture seems not to be recognized by the UIView.
I did a quick search in the list of closed issues and I found out that I should change is `enabled` property to `false`. 

I did it and set `UserInteractionEnabled` to `true`, but even so my tap gesture still don't work. Do you have any idea what I'm doing wrong? 
Here's the full code

`        reviewsNumber.addGestureRecognizer(UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(self.openReviews(_:))))
        reviewsNumber.isEnabled = false
        reviewsNumber.isUserInteractionEnabled = true`
When using half stars, the rating is aways rounded up like so:
For a value of 2.1, the rating view shows 2.5 stars when it should show only 2 stars.

Any properties that handle this? Any way to change that behavior if not?
