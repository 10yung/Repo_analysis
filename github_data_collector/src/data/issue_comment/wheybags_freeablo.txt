Hi!

The window opens but nothing is displayed. I can see the window border - the border is rendered - but the rest of the window is "see through". If I move the mouse I can hear sounds - apparently I move the mouse over click sensitive content - but I see nothing as the window is "transparent".

Seems to be a bug.

OS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
