Hi,

first, thank you very much for sharing this template. I find it very useful to my master thesis typesetting. 

I would like to know how can I add some appendices that dedicate to show some tables at the very end of the document?

I tried to add these lines to the` main.tex`:
```
...
\printbibliography{}
% the above stays unchanged while the following is added in attempt to include some appendices
\appendix
\chapter{An appendix}
\input{pages/appendix.tex}
\chapter{Another appendix}
\input{pages/appendix2.tex}
\end{document}
```
However, the output is not what I was expecting. I would like to have one thing: such entries 
```
A. An Appendix ...................................... xx
B. Another Appendix ...............................  xx
```
in the ToC. 
Second thing: "An Appendix" and "Another Appendix" starts with a new page respectively after the bibliography, just like two new chapters in the main matter. The title on the new pages should be something like "A. An Appendix" and "B. Another Appendix". The tables in "An Appendix" should have numbering A.1, A.2, etc. while tables in "Another Apendix" have B.1, B.2 etc.  And these tables should be listed in the "List of Tables" page.

How do I achieve that? Thank you very much again for your help!

fixed heading style (sectioning & section)
added \phantomsection for hyperref to correctly reference page in PDF
There is a new requirement for the disclaimer: https://www.in.tum.de/en/current-students/administrative-matters/thesis-guidelines-and-topics/
The disclaimer now does not include the department:

"I confirm that this bachelor's thesis | master's thesis is my own work and I have documented all sources and material used."

The title and cover still need to include the departments name.
The links to the Logo files in README.md are now broken. I'm referring to this part of the README : 

> Download the TUM logo from **here** and save it to logos/tum.pdf.
> Download your faculty's logo from **here** and save it to logos/faculty.pdf.

Unfortunately, I could not find the updated links on https://portal.mytum.de

An example for a  Sperrvermerk would be nice

A pseudo code example would be nice.
