How to install trailofbits/CTF source in kali linux
as title
no other changes.  All this does is (hopefully) make the published html version match the actual markdown content.

I think this is correct but I'm a gitbook newbie so please make sure it passes the smell test...

Pull request #40 supposedly fixes broken links, but this change isn't reflected in the web-facing version.
The malware analysis course by TML is down right now. I was able to get the link from Internet Archive. However, I just wanted to ask whether you could replace it with [RPISEC's course](https://github.com/RPISEC/Malware/). Is the TML course significant enough to keep it? Does it offer something different? I really don't know how to judge, I defer to your infinitely better judgement.

If it is, I'll submit a PR to update the TML course links.

Thanks for this wonderful resource!

In several places throughout the guide, there are links to PDFs that point to files stored in this repo. Some of those links are wrong, because the 'ctf' directory in the path sometimes appear twice, for example Vulnerability Discovery -> Auditing Source contains links to PDFs for Essential C and TAOSSA Chapter 6: C Language Issues. Those links are:

```https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/ctf/vulnerabilities/references/EssentialC.pdf```
```https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/ctf/vulnerabilities/references/Dowd_ch06.pdf``` 

They should be:

```https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/vulnerabilities/references/EssentialC.pdf```
```https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/vulnerabilities/references/Dowd_ch06.pdf```

Other pages have the same issues, they are:

Vulnerability Discovery -> Auditing Webapps
```https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/ctf/web/workshop/siberia.zip```

Should be:
```https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/web/workshop/siberia.zip```

Exploit Creation -> Binary Exploits 1
```https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/ctf/exploits/references/formatstring-1.2.pdf```
```https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/ctf/exploits/references/tr-2007-153.pdf```

Should be:
```https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/exploits/references/formatstring-1.2.pdf```
```https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/exploits/references/tr-2007-153.pdf```

Exploit Creation -> Binary Exploits 2
```https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/ctf/exploits/references/no-nx.pdf```
```https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/ctf/exploits/references/acsac09.pdf```

Should be:
```https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/exploits/references/no-nx.pdf```
```https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/exploits/references/acsac09.pdf```

Those are the links that I found, but I'm sure I could have missed a few. Thanks for the awesome resource!
i've spent more time than i'd like to admit trying to build one, and finally did successfully, and here is how to do it on osx:

- install gitbook by running `npm install gitbook-cli -g`
- download this project and extract it
- inside it run 'gitbook install'
- download Calibre application https://calibre-ebook.com/download
- move the `calibre.app` to your Applications folder
- create a symbolic link `sudo ln -s /Applications/calibre.app/Contents/MacOS/ebook-convert /usr/local/bin`
- if its still gives an error after creating a symbolic link you can add it to your PATH to fix it `export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/MacOS
`
- now it should work, inside the directory run `gitbook pdf`

i think thats about it, good luck.
key_buf (32bytes) is too small to hold the all content of the key file (56bytes).

added Black Hat Python

Each lecture and each exercise should have its own, independent subsection. That would both make the guide easier to read and lower the bar for people to contribute modules.
