Data related to CI status is only displayed in PRs, not commits
Cannot see first line of an Issue as you type it, also cannot see the Issue title. 

If I compare the appâ€™s user activity for
someone in my organization I only get non-private activity
I'd lile to see my most importan org at the top, not the one that starts with A
When I open a repository using the ioc:// url structure, the app doesn't let me navigate through that repository backwards, only forwards. That means I can't star the repo or look at other branches or see the author's other repos. For that, I have to open the author's profile page. 
GitHub added reactions to PRs, issues, and comments. They've also [made an API available](https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-05-12-reactions-api-preview/) to retrieve reactions. It would be absolutely fantastic if this was supported in ioctocat. I find myself viewing issues in the browser just to see what the reactions were for a given comment.
I recently purchased ioctocat, so this might be just the newbie speaking, but I can't figure out how to return to code comments I made and edit them. The comments don't appear in the code after I put them in, I have to go to a browser to see them. And since I can't find them I cannot delete or edit them.
Thanks for any help you can provide.
Steps to replicate:

1) From your feed, view a repository someone has starred
2) Raise the share sheet, select Slack, edit (or not; doesn't seem to matter)
3) Tap "Post"
4) App crashes; Slack post not sent

Expected behavior:
1) App should send post
2) App should not crash
It would be great to have true iPad Pro support - full resolution (not scaled up iPad version), split screen support etc.....
These could simply work like labels and milestones - the user could add a project label to an issuer remove it, but otherwise couldn't edit the project.
