Added functions setCursorAtHelp and printAtHelp not using y coordinates
**Describe the bug**
When npkill finishes searching it displays 0mb releasable space, despite showing multiple node_modules folders. On folder deletion, the program hangs. After five minutes, I killed the process with task manager and found that it succeeded at deleting the folder, but got stuck anyways.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Run cmder
2. Run npkill
3. Select a node_modules folder and hit space

**Expected behavior**
The program shouldn't hang. Also, it should be able to calculate folder size.

**Screenshots**

 - OS: Windows 7
 - Version 0.6.0

**Additional context**
I suspect it may have something to do with file paths, you can see in the screenshots that the first part of the path uses one type of separator, and exactly after $PWD it switches separator type.

After a really long time (about half an hour) the program managed to unhang itself, after deleting a really small (< 1mb) node_modules folder. Also, after "unhanging", it calculated the size of two other really small node_modules folders. I was thinking maybe my hard drive was having some trouble, but Crystal Disk Info is reporting good HDD health.
Instead of [`rm`-ing the folders](https://github.com/voidcosmos/npkill/blob/071db250f4d10767824c89d44bbcc727a6bdc7f4/src/services/linux-files.service.ts#L31) when a delete is triggered, it would be helpful to have an option that [trashes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trash) them instead such as `--trash`. This is much safer and reversible.
**Describe the bug**
On MacOS, I get the following error when attempting to delete files:

> The directory cannot be deleted. Do you have permission?

 Have tried with sudo and non-sudo accounts

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Run npkill with or without sudo command. 
2. Attempt to delete an item from the list displayed 
3. See error

**Expected behavior**
Item is deleted with no error

 - OS:  MacOS 10.15.1
 - Version: 0.6.0

**Describe the bug**
Running `npkill` resulted in prompts for access to my: contacts, pictures, and calendars. I promptly stopped the process!

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Launch terminal.app or iTerm2 (v3.3.7)
2. `$ npx npkill`
3. See screenshot:

**Expected behavior**
Yes, by running `npkill` I granted access to my system. However, I didn't expect the package or its dependencies to be compromised by malware.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I'm always frustrated when I see `mb` (millibits) instead of `MB` (megabytes)

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'd like to change `mb` to `MB` and `gb` to `GB`.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I have not considered any alternatives.

**Additional context**
Files to change:
* \_\_tests\_\_/result.service.test.ts
* src/constants/main.constants.ts
* src/controller.ts
* src/services/results.service.ts

Pull Request Link: https://github.com/voidcosmos/npkill/pull/55

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Would be awesome to be able to hold shift + cursor arrow to skip 10 or 20 line positions because scrolling through thousands of directories takes a long time.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Trying to exclude folders but that doesn't work as mentioned [here](https://github.com/voidcosmos/npkill/issues/19).

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open a terminal
2. Run `npx npkill`
3. The bottom-left corner displays a message: "Cannot read property 'path' of undefined"

**Expected behavior**
npkill runs normally and displays a list of directories

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

 - OS: MAC OS X 10.14.6
 - Version: npkill v0.6.0


**Describe the bug**
--help does not print the list of commands out of view

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open a terminal with a height less than 25 rows (v0.6.0)
2. Type `npkill -h`
3. You can see how the last rows do strange things, and omit the output of commands that do not fit in the terminal.

**Expected behavior**
It is expected to list all available commands as shown [here
](https://github.com/voidcosmos/npkill#options) regardless of terminal size.

**Screenshots**

 - OS: Tested in Arch. I imagine it applies to all systems.
 - Version: Probably since the --help command was implemented.

**Additional context**
May need to change the system by which the command list is printed :(
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Using the `exclude` option logs an error `excludeDirs.flat is not a function`. This is because the `.flat` method user [here](https://github.com/voidcosmos/npkill/pull/44/files#diff-03dc3fc6bad605160a87e47ee854b23dR67) [only exists from node 11.0.0](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat). 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'm not sure if other similar newer methods are used elsewhere in the code, but it'd be nice to document the node versions required. Ideally though, it'll be nice to use alternative methods that exist in older versions, or a polyfill. This would make the library more portable

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
It works without `exclude`. In my local `node_modules/npkill`, I added [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50993569/4255034) polyfill from stackoverflow.

A more robust polyfill can be found [here](https://github.com/jonathantneal/array-flat-polyfill/blob/master/src/flat.js).
