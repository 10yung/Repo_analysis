I run brook like:

```
sudo ~/bin/brook_darwin_amd64 vpn -l 127.0.0.1:1080 -s myserver:8888 -p "mypass"
```

Is it possible to exclude some hosts(like taobao.com) from proxy, just visit directly?
I have a windows server 2012. I tried to install brook windows GUI client, it was successfully installed, but when I start it, nothing happened. No error, no dialog, nothing. I tried with several versions, including the latest one and several others published in 2019, but none works. Need your help
I want my website to support Trojan and brook at the same time. I've been focusing on brook for a long time. I only recently learned about Trojan because they support connecting to databases. Do you have any plans to support databases！

### Discussion
I have a server at home with a lot of virtual machines.I set up the service on one of the virtual machines and mapped the ports to the public network.When I connect with the client, the connection fails, and there are a lot of TCP requests that take up memory.
I use the command line operation, do not know where the problem, I am a beginner, I hope to get guidance.

### Expected Behavior

### Current Behavior

### Detailed Description

I hope brook can provide R-Proxy like FRP

In this way, it is convenient to manage the intranet server for NAT by using only one brook software

For example, server "A" is through NAT and server "B" is on the Internet.

server A: 22 to server B: 222  through brook  

Ssh server B: 222 is access server a: 22

Thank you

* Server Operation System Language: English
* Client Operating System: Windows 10
* Client Operating System Version: 1909 18363.535
* Client Operation System Language: S-Chinese
### Expected Behavior
I use same OS both in office and home(includ same os version, language, 64 bit).
After author update Brook to v20200101 , I update brook to v20200101 from ver0601 both on my home PC and office PC. (**I uninstalled old version(0601) before install v20200101**)
### Current Behavior
After v20200101 installation and run brook GUI, these two PC both alert `FormatException : Bad UTF-8 encoding 0xb4(at offset 0)`
I think I solved this alert with @txthinking 's help ---- use GLOBAL mode.

The reality is ，my office PC works fine, after use global mode once time , no matter if I use which mode , the alert('FormatException : Bad UTF-8 encoding 0xb4(at offset 0)') disappeard.

But my home PC show a new alert --PlatformException(error, open NULL:The system cannot find the file specified., null)
I need get help again.

### Discussion

On a multi-user Linux machine, my Brook password is clearly visible when someone else runs a 'top' command. Any user (not just root) can do this. Is it possible to add an option to specify the password on stdin instead of on the command line? After all, file permissions are easier to control :-D
PS: I am using v20190601

====================================================
I'm not sensitive to the speed of network parsing. I would like to add a function to check whether the linked IP address belongs to the outside of mainland China. If so, go to the proxy. Instead of the current whitelist blacklist mechanism.
