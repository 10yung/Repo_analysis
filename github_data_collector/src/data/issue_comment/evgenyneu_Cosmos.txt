Half of the rows displayed are correct but the other half created from the reused cell is not correct.

iOS 13 introduced a new default modal presentation style that allows the user to dismiss with a downwards gesture. Unfortunately this interferes with dragging from one star rating to another in Cosmos.

To reproduce:

1. Add a `CosmosView` to a view controller and present it modally on iOS 13.
2. Attempt to drag your finger from one star to the next

Expected: the star rating changes as the user drags her finger

Actual: the star rating does not change

A few observations:

* I am using the latest version of Cosmos and iOS 13.1.1
* The `CosmosView` works as expected if the view controller's `modalPresentationStyle` is changed to `.fullScreen`
* On close inspection, a drag gesture does allow for value changes of half-step increments, but as soon as the gesture leaves one star for the next star, the gesture is dropped.
* Setting the parent scroll view's `canCancelContentTouches` to `false` does not seem to help.
* Setting `passTouchesToSuperview` to `false` does not help.
With XCode 11 GM around the corner. are there any plans to support SPM with a `Package.swift`
I am building a feedback rating application. And this is the current configuration which I am using, 
* Library setup method: CocoaPods
* Xcode version. 10.3
* OS version. iOS 12.1

On default, I would like to load ZERO filled stars. I tried to check the documentation etc but couldn't able to find the appropriate solution. 



Hi @evgenyneu, 

First, I want to say thanks so much for such a great star rating control. I'm trying to figure it now for days and maybe you know the answer (at the end you the author of the repository).  :)
My question is how to modify each `cosmosView` rating independently in a custom `UICollectionViewCell`, and afterward save the changes.

I know how saving works using `UserDefaults`.
But I don't know where to call the functions (load & save) after I modify the rating on the cells, so each cell rating is modified independently from the other one.
I did tried it in multiple `UICollectionView` methods like` didSelectItemAt indexPath`, and `cellForItemAt indexPath`
This is my Custom `UICollectionViewCell` of course some unnecessary code I left out.

```swift
class ProductCell: UICollectionViewCell {

//MARK: - Properties
 fileprivate let kDefaults = "key"

lazy var ratingStar: CosmosView = {
        let cosmosStar = CosmosView()
        cosmosStar.settings.filledImage = UIImage(named: "starFilled")?.withRenderingMode(.alwaysOriginal)
        cosmosStar.settings.emptyImage = UIImage(named: "starEmpty")?.withRenderingMode(.alwaysOriginal)
        cosmosStar.rating = 0
        cosmosStar.settings.fillMode = .half
        cosmosStar.settings.updateOnTouch = true
        return cosmosStar
    }()

override init(frame: CGRect) {
        super.init(frame: frame)
        saveStarRating()
        loadStarRating()
    }

// MARK: - Methods
   func saveStarRating() {
        ratingStar.didFinishTouchingCosmos = { rating in
            UserDefaults.standard.set(rating, forKey: self.kDefaults)
        }
    }
    
func loadStarRating() {
        guard let loadValue = UserDefaults.standard.object(forKey: kDefaults) as? Double else {return}
        ratingStar.rating = loadValue
    }

}
```
Also, This is how the `UICollectionViewCell`s  look in the simulator:

Thanks in advance. :)




Is there any feature to increase touch area. If I increase Cosmos:UIView width and height it does not stay at the center and aligns to top.

The idea is to improve the UX so a user can easily touch and give stars/ratings even if he touches 10px away of Cosmos view.
I was using the different colors for different values  (Ex: for 1 :Red, 2: green, 3: orange 4:purple 5:black) but when I scroll downs the cell in table view it is duplicating the color and how to store all values in an array when ratings automatically changes please find the solution for this duplicate colors
HI,
I have a problem with Cosmos star rating when I put it inside an UIAlertController. The UIAlertController don't show my CosmosView and i don't have any log. This bug appear on device with iOS 11.4 but it work with iOS 12.+. I didn't try with older version.

Thanks.
