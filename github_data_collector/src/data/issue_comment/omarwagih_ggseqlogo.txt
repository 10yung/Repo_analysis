how do the method calculate the Height by bitsï¼ŸCould you tell me the formula
Hi Omar, here is my modification to support data.frame input and hence better support for facet_grid.
Fixes issue #8 
By removing redundant scale_x_continuous and coord_cartesian arguments from the output of geom_logo.

It would be wonderful to be able to pass in custom x-axis labels. For example, if I am making a consensus sequence around a start codon, we want the "A" of "ATG" to be position 1.

Currently this is challenging in ggseqlogo because geom_logo includes a scale function, which is inconsistent with ggplot2's separation of concerns.  I don't think that it is necessary, as in my hands that scale argument does not change the resulting plot.

Could we remove scale from geom_logo, and then if necessary create a scale_logo function with start position as an argument?

Hi,
I've started using ggseqlogo for these plots and it's great.

There's now EDLogo, an alternative means of plotting sequence logos to highlight depletion as well:

Is it possible to implement the EDLogo algorithm detailed there:

in ggseqlogo?

Thanks

This is a great package with a lot of flexibilities!

But When I tried to adjust the width of the letters, the x axis moved!
Notice the alignment between the ticks of `ggseqlogo` plot and the sequence letters in following plots.  
If I used default `stack_width`, which is `.95`, I've got:

Then if I set it to `.5`:

The vertical grids became a little bit narrower, even though not so obvious by eyes.

But if I set it to `0.01`:

Note the relative positions of the ticks to the sequence letters, it is exactly what I want!

The sequences were plotted by `ggplot2`'s `geom_text`, and the plots were arranged by `gtable`:
```r
library(ggplot2)
library(ggseqlogo)
library(gtable)
library(grid)
# ... generating the  plots
g   <- gtable(unit(1, "npc"), unit(c(.7, .05, .05, .2), "npc"))
g   <- gtable_add_grob(g, gcurvgrob, 1, 1)
g   <- gtable_add_grob(g, gtable1grob, 2, 1)
g   <- gtable_add_grob(g, gtable2grob, 3, 1)
g   <- gtable_add_grob(g, glogogrob, 4, 1)
grid.newpage()
grid.draw(g)
```

If I just try to solely plot with `ggseqlogo`, with `stack_width` `0.95`:

For `stack_width` `0.01`:

You can easily tell the different padding from the first tick to the left border. Of course, as a single plot, it is completely OK, but I expect the `stack_width` shouldn't affect the tick positions so that we can better align the seqlogo to other plots.

By the way, the motif length is actually 9 (marked in the plots), the rest regions are filled with zeros.

Thanks!
