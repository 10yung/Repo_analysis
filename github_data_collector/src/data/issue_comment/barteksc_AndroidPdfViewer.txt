I face this issue when extracting latin text with pdfium. Some chars are not correctly displayed. I see pdfium use UTF-16LE and I guess I have to decode it to ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8. Tried some methods, getting bytes first and then converting bytes to string, without success. Someone have a better hint for this and also for replacing Unicode chars like hyphen char (dashes) when extracting text?? Thank you.
