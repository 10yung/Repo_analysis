=== CLEAN TARGET FuzzyAutocomplete OF PROJECT FuzzyAutocomplete WITH THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION (Release) ===

My Xcode version is  8.2.1, there were two issues


Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "_OBJC_CLASS_$_DVTTextCompletionInlinePreviewController", referenced from:
      l_OBJC_$_CATEGORY_DVTTextCompletionInlinePreviewController_$_FuzzyAutocomplete in DVTTextCompletionInlinePreviewController+FuzzyAutocomplete.o
      objc-class-ref in FuzzyAutocomplete.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)


I'd really love to use fuzzy autocomplete in my apps Info.plists as well.

Hello all,

first of all thanks for the great plugin, i have been using it for quite a while but i had to disable it recently.

I have a question that annoys me so much that i had to turn of fuzzy autocomplete for swift files:

When i work in a method and the class has a variable named the same as another class, then the scoring will always select the class and not the variable (even if the entered prefix starts with a lower letter), it never selects the variable which i want and always the class. The setting "Require prefix set to 2" doesn't solve the issue.

The problem is the wrong suggestion even works for the method/propery matching but will now return a function pointer instead of the call, and it takes a lot of time to just remove the unwanted code that was inserted.

It would be great to know how i can tweak it to fix this issue.

I would greatly appreciate support.

Florian

Example:

```
class SyncManager{}

class Test{
    let syncManager = SyncManager()

    func foo(){
       synMan <---- Codehinting will always select SyncManager with a higher score than syncManager even if it matches more characters
    }
}
```

On xCode 7.1.1, open a stand alone .swift file not in a project.
typing 
let replacement = (fullPath as NSString).
looking for 
stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString
but it is no where to be found.
desired output is:
let replacement = (fullPath as NSString).stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString(oldName, withString: newName)

I’m seeing large amounts of identical messages being printed during normal usage. From a session of about 30 minutes usage I have 1334 identical messages logged by FuzzyAutocomplete.

Is this needed for release builds or something that we could compile out? Obviously fixing the real issue would be the nicest fix :smile_cat: 

For example, notice how that there’s several messages during the same second:

Last one wouldn't merge cleanly with master and felt a bit meh so I started over.

Xcode feels a lot better with non-blocking turned on!

Changes:
- Added checkbox in Experimental options to enable Non-blocking mode and set delay. Defaults to `off` and `0.1` seconds.
- Uses a `dispatch_source_t` timer to start delay after typing
- `_fa_bestMatchForQuery` will now bail out if the prefix changes (i.e. a new keystroke happens when it's in a middle of matching). This could be implemented a bit nicer
- Matching no longer blocks main thread if non-blocking is on

Haven't been able to crash it yet!

Caveats:
- Disabled inline preview for non-blocking as we see super weird reverse typing issues when the user types in a matching completion 
- I couldn't figure out a nice way to get `dispatch_source_t` into `objc_setAssociatedObject` (wrapping in `NSValue` didn't appear to do what I wanted), so it's `static`

Hello,

thanks for the great plugin. It works awesome in Objc.

However i feel struggling in the Console or when using swift, e.g. it always shows the Class instead of the variable and replacing false/true with other stuff.

I would greatly appreciate if it could be selective disabled e.g. in the console, for swift or for objc 

Thanks 
Florian

Surprisingly, the plugin becomes slower on newer versions of Xcode. Need to re-evaluate performance bottlenecks. Last big performance optimisation was done when Xcode 5 was still around :)

Initial investigation of performance under Xcode 7.1 shows that getting a priority factor has (only now, or had it always?) a synchronized part, and can make parallel processing slower than single thread when many items pass the filtering.

Also, it takes surprisingly long (even given it does synchronize) and the priorities do not change when narrowing down.
- [x] use single thread for getting priority factors
- [x] cache priority factors for narrowing down
- [ ] make filtering before populating the cache also parallel
- [ ] investigate how Xcode filtering and scoring changed
- [ ] identify other bottlenecks

After install FuzzyAutocompletePlugin by building this repository. I go to Xcode plugins directory
~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins and couldn't find the plugin
