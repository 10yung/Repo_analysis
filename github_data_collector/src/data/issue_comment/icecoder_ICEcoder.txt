When you hit the "Update" button in the settings menu for any reason, no matter 
if you change anything or not, the password field in the user config file is updated and the 
slashes"\" are stripped and PHP can't properly read the hashed password without 
the dollar signs escaped.
adds ../date/ at the beginning of the settings file, then it is displayed
`../data/../data/../data/../data/<?php
$ICEcoderUserSettings = array(
,`
I fixed it for 
'go-localhost-root'
`if (is_writeable("../data/".$settingsFile)) {
            if ($settingsContents != 0) {
		$fh = fopen("../data/".$settingsFile, 'w');
		fwrite($fh, "../data/".$settingsContents);
		fclose($fh);
            }`
but for ftp-manafer.php there are no ideas yet
Hey all, it's been a while since I've used this tool so it could just be me not setting permissions correctly.

I can't edit anything in the Root directory of ICEcoder (var/www/html).

I used the WATCH command on that directory and saw everytime I tried there were changes to this file: /var/www/html/ICEcoder/data/error.log

Opened her up and found this:

A non well formed numeric value encountered in /var/www/html/ICEcoder/lib/requirements.php on line 9

Is this an issue with php, or just permissions?

I downloaded Version 7, set a password and updated the settings to my preferences.
(editor theme eclipse, pugin sidebar on the right). After that A logged out and tried to log in again.

All it does, is loading the LogIn page all over again. The password is correct. There is nothing shown in the developper tools.
When you press Unlock sidebar the lower section (with Terminal, Github etc) overlaps the backup button

If you type a command such as `cd ..` into the terminal it will freeze. It seems to be related to this regex, as if you comment it out you can use the terminal fine:

However, the path displayed in the prompt doesn't match, so that needs fixing too.
If ICEcoder is unable to write the dir/file, detect if it's due to lack of owner, group or permissions.

Based upon findings, offer the user the option of ICEcoder fixing the issue by recursively changing owner/group to the web servers' user and fixing any permissions (dirs to 755, files to 644) along the way.

If the user confirms, state it'll do this, please wait a few seconds, then try saving your dir/file again.

This should be a one time hit to resolve this common issue users face.

It'll work by setting a task for processes/system.php to pickup and run on it's next run. Note that it relies on this process running in the background, so also should check if it's running and if not, inform the user on how to enable it. A timestamp of last run would be a good idea, we can detect if it ran in the last few seconds.
This isn't a great solution to ensure code regression, remove as it's an incomplete and faulty solution.
There isn't always a `$doNext` var to concat on and need to further check JS works in all processes.
Setup ICEbox as a solution and integrate wih ICEcoder including instructions on use.
