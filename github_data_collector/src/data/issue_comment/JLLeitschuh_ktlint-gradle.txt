Now git tasks are always added to avoid I/O on Gradle configuration phase.

Closes #284 
Possibly a duplicate of #279, but I'm unable to specify a custom path for the `editorconfig`. This doesn't seem to work:

```
ktlint {
  ...
  additionalEditorconfigFile = file("/quality/.editorconfig")
}
```

If it's of any value, I put up a commit so that you can see the full code: https://github.com/saket/press/blob/5f83d1e65ead269c761b965493d6a615851f2734/quality/lint.gradle#L15
We would like to have the option to choose the location for reporter, which in ktlint is optional, but in plugin it's hardcoded and not available for setting.

```
        project.layout.buildDirectory.file(project.provider {
            "reports/ktlint/${this@BaseKtlintCheckTask.name}.$fileExtension"
        })
```
**Problem Description** 

When running ktlintCheck or ktlintFormat, if code style errors are found, the error message is not specific when the task fails, just mentioning a non-zero exit value after running the `JavaExec` in the runLint task.

This can cause some confusion and it's not very specific.

**Suggested Solution:**

Output error message when ktlintCheck finds code style errors: 
"Ktlint found X code styles errors, please fix them before continuing"

Output error message when ktlintFormat is not able to auto-correct: 
"Ktlint found X code styles errors that couldn't be auto-corrected, please fix them before continuing"
Currently format tasks works the same as common lint tasks, except that they may modify inputs. This leads to the several problems with this tasks caching: #302 or #194 

Possible solutions to this problem:
- actually run lint tasks first, don't fail the tasks, then run format only on files with files violations. Format task is never cacheable, but uses lint tasks reports as input.
- something else?

@JLLeitschuh maybe something else comes to your mind how to solve it as well?
Followup of #101:

Plugin should detect if composite builds applies plugin as well and run git hook over "files-to-commit" in such projects.
Followup of #101:

Plugin should detect if `buildSrc` module applies plugin as well and run git commit hook over files to commit in this module.
Followup of #101:
Current implementation only adds a git hook, when `.git/` folder is located in Gradle root project folder. But quite often project has non-gradle top folder. Plugin should add a way to define non-standard `./git` folder location.
Steps to reproduce:

1. Use `addKtlintCheckGitPreCommitHook`  task on windows
2. Commit badly formatted files
3. Ktlint will not check any commited files and will allow you to commit the badly formatted file.

Issue seems to stem from the fact that `git diff` generates file names with forward slashes while gradle uses backward slashes. When [comparing the paths](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/ktlint-gradle/blob/9a980883542b5aab1123be517c911e6709aa79c5/plugin/src/main/kotlin/org/jlleitschuh/gradle/ktlint/GitHook.kt#L148), slashes do not match and thus no files get checked.

As a workaround I have added ` | sed 's/\//\\/g'` to my hook to just replace backslashes in the bash script, but proper fix should probably be made (ignore slashes when comparing files). 
**A bit of context**
Due to some problems with Android `SafeArgs` Gradle plugin I had to add additional source sets into feature modules (Gradle sub-projects)
```
    sourceSets {
getByName("test").java.srcDir("${project.rootDir}/app/build/generated/source/navigation-args/debug")
    }
```

**Ktlint Issue**
Now I am experiencing an issue where `filter` configuration seems to be ignored and checks `...Args` classes that are located inside the `generated` folder (I am not sure if this is related to the above change, but 100% reproducible).

I have added to root `build.gradle.kts` file:
```
filter {
   exclude("**/generated/**")
}
```

However ktlint gradle still seens to check classes in `generated` folder
```
/Users/igorwojda/StudioProjects/android-showcase/app/build/generated/source/navigation-args/debug/com/igorwojda/showcase/feature/album/presentation/albumdetails/AlbumDetailFragmentArgs.kt:26:30
```

Since this class is generated by `SafeArgs` Gradle plugin I have no control on code format and naturally, I want it not to be checked by ktlint.

Also, note that after adding the same source set to different modules this file is checked 3 times.

**Reproduce**
Here is the branch to test it
https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/tree/ktlint-filter-not-working

1. Open this project in Android Studio
2. Build project, so `AlbumDetailFragmentArgs` is generated (`Build` -> `Make project`)
3. Run ktlint `./gradlew ktlintcheck`

Result
```

Expected result
All checks related to `AlbumDetailFragmentArgs.kt` would be ignored (due to filter rule). Also is this class would not be ignored I would expect no duplicated checks.
