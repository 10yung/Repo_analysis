how i can request data when the user goes to next page instead requesting the entire data at once.

Thanks in advance. 
please help
if you have multiple tables and pagers on the same page, I noticed that pagers are affecting each another. It appears a scope isolation issue.
Integration with angular-1.6.4 give the following error.

Here is the HTML,
```
<table class="table table-striped" at-table at-paginated at-list="serverList" at-config="config">
  <thead></thead>
         <tbody>
		<tr>
			<td at-implicit at-sortable at-attribute="id" width="150" at-initial-sorting="asc"></td>
			<td at-implicit at-sortable at-attribute="alias"  width="250"></td>
			<td at-implicit at-sortable at-attribute="host"></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<at-pagination at-list="serverList" at-config="config"></at-pagination>
```

And, here is the JS,

```
WebServices._get(ConstantService.GET_ALL_SERVER).then(function(value) {
	$scope.serverList = value.data;
	console.log($scope.serverList);
	$scope.config = {
		itemsPerPage: 2,
		 fillLastPage: true
	 }
	 $timeout(function() {
		$scope.$apply();
	});
}, function(reason) {
	console.log(reason);
}, function(value) {
	console.log(value);
});
```


This is the error and due to this the pagination is not working.
```

Kindly address this issue. Thanks in advance.
I'm able to hide a column's contents by adding `class="hidden-xs hidden-sm"` but the header, which is generated using `at-title="Name of Column"` doesn't get hidden like the column contents do. 

Is there a way to hide both the `<th>` and the `<td>` for the column while still using `at-title` to create the table headers? 

This is what I'm currently doing, which hides the column contents, but not the column header:
`<td at-attribute="transList" class="hidden-xs hidden-sm" at-title="Name of Column">`

Is there something like `at-class` that adds the class to both the header and contents? I tried the following, but it didn't work:

`<td at-attribute="transList" at-class="hidden-xs hidden-sm" at-title="Name of Column">`
Hello,

I have tried to use webpack to bundle my angular app. I used `require("angular-table")` to include this package in the project after using npm to install this package (v1.0.4). However, I kept getting error of module not found. Any advice on this? 

Thank you
Use quoted object retrieval instead of property-based, which allows
for arbitrary key names in the at-attribute directive.
Above enhancement will help in api dependant pagination.
Crowding up data in an array while initiation is not Api friendly.

Hi, 

The version constraint for angular in bower.json is currently stuck on the 1.2 branch. Is there any known incompatibilities with more recent versions? If not, could the constraint be updated accordingly?

Thanks in advance for your feedback.
