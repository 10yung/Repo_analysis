I am trying to run a code. For this purpose, I have download that code from [github].(https://github.com/kopepod/ADCSF) Whenever that code tries to check mexopencv. It shows an error

[error 3] please make sure gcc >= 4.4 g++ >= 4.4 is installed ...

Following is the description of system
Window 10
Visual Studio 2012
Matlab 2017a
opencv 2.4.10
mexopencv (install from your folder LIB)
i use opencv3. 4.1
i have a problem please help me, error message:

Hello, I use 
MatlabR2019a 
OS X 10.14.6
opencv 3.4.1
when I make use matlab , here is an error:

I do not known how to deal with this error, please help me.
`detector = cv.SIFT('ConstrastThreshold',0.04,'EdgeThreshold',10);
[keypoints1, descriptors1] = detector.detectAndCompute(im1g);
[keypoints2, descriptors2] = detector.detectAndCompute(im2g);

matcher = cv.DescriptorMatcher('BruteForce');
matches = matcher.knnMatch(descriptors1,descriptors2,2);
Goodmatches = [];
for i = 1:length(matches)
    tmp = matches{i};
    if (tmp(1).distance < 0.6*tmp(2).distance)
        Goodmatches = [Goodmatches;tmp(1)];
    end
end
`
when I do matches,in fact,I found that the two points below do not match :
keypoints1(Goodmatches(i).queryIdx).pt;
keypoints2(Goodmatches(i).trainIdx).pt;
however,these two below match :
keypoints1(Goodmatches(i).queryIdx+1).pt;
keypoints2(Goodmatches(i).trainIdx+1).pt;
After successful installation there is no output from cv.getBuildInformation() function in Octave 5.1.0 on Windows 10. The only difference from instructions for installation for this Octave version is the path C:\dev\octave\mingw32\bin. What can cause this?
Hi, I followed your instruction at this [(https://github.com/kyamagu/mexopencv/wiki/Installation-(Windows,-MATLAB,-OpenCV-3))]
My OS is windows 10  64 bits X64 processor, while the cmake version is 3.13.0 and   Visual studio version is 14 2015.   In attempt to configure using x64 option, it returns error and when I used the default  Win 32, it configured.  Having done the configuration and the generation, I opened the  C:\dev\build\OpenCV.sln file and the from the release option. I could only select Win 32 and not x64 as you shown in the link.  I tried to follow other steps in MATLAB command line and what the following error was the outcome on  implementing themexopencv.make('opencv_path','C:\dev\build\install', 'opencv_contrib',true)

Error using mexopencv.make>pkg_config (line 333)
OpenCV library path not found: C:\dev\build\install\x64\vc15\lib

Error in mexopencv.make>mex_options (line 265)
    [cv_cflags, cv_libs] = pkg_config(opts);

Error in mexopencv.make (line 82)
    mex_flags = mex_options(opts);

 I want to believe that my inability to resolve the x64 and win32 options is reponsible.  How can I resolve this problem?  Many thanks in anticipation of your help.
Thank you.
I followed the installation instructions, but the E:\dev\build\install is not include x64.
Can you help me solve the problem?

Hello, 

When I do brew install opencv3, it automatically installs opencv version 3.4.5. Is there a way I can specify the version of opencv3 to install?

Thanks!
Can I install mexopencv by Matlab Runtime?

Or the other way around, can I include mexopencv/opencv functions into a Matlab standalone application?
