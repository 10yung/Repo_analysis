Not sure why this would happen. We need to review PSEventViewer as this should be a silent error.

so I've modified [PSWinReporting/Examples/RunMe-Reporting.ps1](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWinReporting/blob/master/Examples/RunMe-Reporting.ps1) to fit my needs, and am getting strange results.

First, because I'm not sure how pertinent it is, here's the output of auditpol on my domain controllers:

Under the section for "**AD Computer Changes Detailed**" happened, I have results that show these things, but I wish there was a more adequate explanation listed:

under **Field Value:**
`TERMSRV/<PC Name>`  -- _Terminal Server?_
`CmRcService/<PC Name>` (directly followed by `CmRcService/<PC FQDN>`) -- _Config Manager Remote Service?_
`WSMAN/<PC Name>` -- _Web Services for Management?_

even if I add those to ignore, I'm still left with unclear results:
**Action:** A directory service object was modified
**Field Changed:** objectClass
**Field Value:** 1.2.840.113556.1.3.30 -- _Computer?_

**Action:** A directory service object was modified
**Field Changed:** userAccountControl
**Field Value:** 4096 (and another for 4098)

**Action:** A directory service object was modified
**Action Details:** Value Deleted (followed by another entry that says "Value Added")
**Who:** NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
**Field Changed:** userCertificate
**Field Value:** %%14672 -- _DNS changes?_

[Here](https://github.com/neztach/pswinreportingconfig/blob/master/RunMe-Reporting-3.ps1) is my sterilized copy with my modifications (I added a ton of notes to keep track of the windows events and what they mean.

The last thing I would request is to somehow consolidate all changes that occur when a user is created or deleted.  Having a dozen lines to show all the things that were created/modified when a user is created is a little cumbersome to read.  I should emphasize I **AM NOT COMPLAINING** I love the tool and its potential, just a humble request.
I'm using version 2.0.11, and have set up event forwarding.
Events are coming through and I've set up the task to trigger RunMe-TriggerOnEvents.ps1.
I've configured my email settings in RunMe-TriggerOnEvents.ps1:
                    From             = 'ADChanges@XXXX.com'
                    To               = 'steve-work@XXXX.com' 
                    CC               = ''
                    BCC              = ''
                    ReplyTo          = ''
                    Server           = "smtp.XXXX.local"
                    Password         = ''
                    PasswordAsSecure = $false
                    PasswordFromFile = $false
                    Port             = '25'
                    Login            = ''
                    EnableSSL        = 1
                    Encoding         = 'Unicode'
                    Subject          = 'Event Changes for period <<DateFrom>> to <<DateTo>>'
                    Priority         = 'Low'


smtp.XXXX.local is a working internal SMTP relay, which does not require authentication.

When the script gets triggered, nothing happens. I've tried manually running it with the same parameters and get the following errors:

I have also tried connecting to office 365 with a login name and password, but get the same error.
Possible to pass through credentials to save to SQL server?
I have a sql server not on domain, and in another domain that would need its own credentials passed.
When lockout happens it often happens that lockout is reported on one DC and then transferred to PDC. This means 2 events for 1 real event. 

Maybe some kind of duplicate checking - if Event ID, User, Computer, Action, and only RecordID/Controller doesn't match merge events.

Is there a way to include only specific accounts and groups in monitoring? I know there is an ignore type parameter, but didn't see anyway to specify sensitive groups and accounts only. 
Not sure if this is possible - but is there a way that you can NOT send an e-mail if no changes happened?

If this is running every hour - there's no need to know that nothing changed.
Sometimes SubEvents can have fields within fields.

While Data property was extracted by Get-Events and split using new line there is still question whether we should try and split that data based on: into a separate hash and put it as properties into Event. Same could be done with Message just in case.
