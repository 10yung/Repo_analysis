What it is going on?
I  want to know if this algorithm has a python version
I want to run an anomaly on time series.
my codes are below:
> temp<- c(.0980, .0897, .0982, .0123, .0244, .0897)
> anom<- ts(temp, frequency=1, start=c(2006, 1))
> anom
Time Series:
Start = 2006 
End = 2011 
Frequency = 1 
[1] 0.0980 0.0897 0.0982 0.0123 0.0244 0.0897
> AnomalyDetectionTs(anom, max_anoms = 0.2, direction = "both", alpha = 0.05,
+   only_last = NULL, threshold = "p95", e_value = FALSE,
+   longterm = FALSE, piecewise_median_period_weeks = 2, plot = TRUE,
+   y_log = TRUE, xlabel = "Year", ylabel = "Temperature", title = "AnomalyTemperature",
+   verbose = FALSE)

but i kept having an error stating:
"Error in AnomalyDetectionTs(anom, max_anoms = 0.2, direction = "both",  : data must be a single data frame."
Please i need help!
Thank you

I noticed that the algorithm allows me to output the estimated value for each found anomaly. Could someone help me understand how this estimated value is calculated? This question arises as I got negative expected value for certain anomalies and was curious as to how these are calculated.

Thank you!
After installing dependency and the project, I follow the simple example in README:
```
data(raw_data)
res = AnomalyDetectionTs(raw_data, max_anoms=0.02, direction='both', plot=TRUE)
res$plot
```
When I run `res$plot`, an error occurs:
`Error: Column `x` is a date/time and must be stored as POSIXct, not POSIXlt`
Does anyone know how to solve the problem? Thx

I have successfully run this on multiple dataframes but occasionally don't receive output or an error.  Upon researching the issue I think the error comes from the following line in the source code:

xgraph <- ggplot2::ggplot(x_subset_week, ggplot2::aes_string(x="timestamp", y="count")) + ggplot2::theme_bw() + ggplot2::theme(panel.grid.major = ggplot2::element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = ggplot2::element_blank(), text=ggplot2::element_text(size = 14))

when I run this and on a dataframe where I don't receive output from the AnomalyDetectionTs function  I get the following error:

Don't know how to automatically pick scale for object of type function. Defaulting to continuous.
