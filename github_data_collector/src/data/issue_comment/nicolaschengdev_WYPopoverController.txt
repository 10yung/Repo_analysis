After the actual machine test, the starting speed of about 100ms is improved.
This change will not cause any problems.
I have few warnings in Xcode 9.0.1
It will be nice to fix them

I was doing iPad project, found that after the introduction of a problem,
Can you add iPad adaptation later
Wrong method was getting called. After some research on swizzling, I found that this method should be called instead.

I set every color property of the theme to clear color, but the color of top and left borders is still gray.

And I found the following line in the WYPopoverController.m, the color should be customizable.

``` objc
[[UIColor grayColor] setFill];
```

I have integrated WYPopoverController in my app. Continuous click for opening WYPopoverController crashing my application. It's happening with the demo too. Just keep on clicking the Center button in the demo.

```
