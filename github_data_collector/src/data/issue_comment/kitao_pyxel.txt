Fix vague translations
I am implementing a simple integration with with the Pymunk physics engine and I am wondering if you have any interest to integrate it with pyxel as an optional module (e.g., pyxel.phys) or if should I keep it as a separate project installable using pip.

What currently works:
* Functions to draw pymunk.Shape's using pyxel rendering engine. 
* API to create pymunk objects using functions similar to the ones in pyxel (e.g.. phys.rect, phys.line, phys.tri, phys.circ)
* An automatic mainloop for users that simply want to run the simulation without any game interaction akin to pyxel.show()

What I may implement in the future
* Creation of joints, motors, etc
* Integrating texts and images
* Simple event system to register collisions and physics events
* Simple scheduler to manage animations and events
* Particle effects

**Describe the bug**
pyxeleditorのサウンドエディタで再生中に音の長さをundoなどで短くするとクラッシュします。
Crash when shortening the length of sound with undo etc. during playback with the sound editor of pyxeleditor.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. `pyxeleditor`を起動する
2. サウンドエディタに切り替える
3. 2つ音符(?)を入れる
4. クラッシュする
<div></div>

1. Start `pyxeleditor`
2. Switch to the sound editor
3. Insert two notes
4. Crash

If you put only one note and then undo it will not crash, but you will hear an audio that disappeared.

When running the example "02_jump_game.py" with Python 3.7.3 on Debian 10, segmentation faults happen seemingly at random.

I'm always frustrated when trying to rotate pyxel.blt()..I may be very new to Python but not coding and I cant figure out how to rotate this image Ive created and loaded properly into the engine because of a lack of documentation. Can I wrap a pyxel object, specificially the BLT function to rotate and manipulate at will without using the pyxeleditor because there is insufficient documentation on how to make it work as well. In two days Ive waded through a lot of code and nothing is written well enough at the moment. I just want to make a spaceship with a vector and that can spin on at the center of its location. Retro asteroids or a retro version of Geometry Wars is my end goal.


**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
I would like to rotate or find all the coordinates of pyxel.blt() objects. Should I use numpy or another engine?

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.
To rotate(pyxel.blt()) and within my rotate class calculating all the new coordinates like a picture or 2D object is my dream but at least find all points of my pyxel.blt object or image and manipulate how I wish within my window.
Ive managed to rotate my spaceship around a point or any given points I want but it always faces up and I could potentially use blt(x, y, img, u, v, w, h, [colkey]) and then negate W and negate H to create the illusion of graphic spinning upside down and mirroring vertically. But I would like to avoid this as it would potentially make my code unusable in the future.

Please more documentation on how to use Tilemap and Pyxel Editor and thank you so much .. so far everything looks so good but I cant manipulate it well enough for my specific liking. I believe updating documentation maybe to say this works as a linear game instead of a 2D game would be an important thing to note. I'm sorry if I sound mean but I'm very new to Python and almost done with my game.

Hello.
I was developing a game with pyxel today.
And  I found a bug when using tilemap().get().

I thought it might have happened because of the complex code in the game, 
and I experimented with simple test code, but I got the same error.

test code
```
#CODING UTF-8
import os, sys, re, random
import pyxel
class Window():
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 160
        self.y = 96
        pyxel.init(self.x,self.y,caption = 'test',fps = 10)
        pyxel.load("./001_sause.pyxres") #The same bug happened with any source file
        pyxel.run(self.main,self.draw)
    def main(self):
        a = pyxel.tilemap(0).get(0,0)
    def draw(self):
        pyxel.cls(0)
        pyxel.bltm(0,0,1,0,0,20,16)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    w = Window()
    w.main()
```

error code
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "D:\pyxel_data\001_Moneytest.py", line 24, in <module>
    w.main()
  File "D:\pyxel_data\001_Moneytest.py", line 16, in main
    a = pyxel.tilemap(0).get(0,0)
  File "C:\Users\Myname\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\pyxel\__init__.py", line 657, in tilemap
    _tilemap_bank[tm] = Tilemap(core.tilemap(int(tm)))
OSError: exception: access violation reading 0x00000004
```

If this is a bug in pyxel, I want you to fix it.
