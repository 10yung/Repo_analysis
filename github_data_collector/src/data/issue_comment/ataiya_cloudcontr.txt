Hi @ataiya @jjcao ,

Firstly thank you for sharing your work. Really helps the community to do a test run and importantly understand a paper. So my sincere thanks to you. However, I have a question. In the code you calculate the average face area with GS.average_face_area (it also says its an implementation of Oscar08). But I couldn't find the implementation. How are you doing it? Can you please let me know?

Regards,

while working on eg_skeleton_laplacian_rosa.m the second step requests to input a Normfet text file,could u provide some insight on how to convert .off file to such a form, so that i could work on my own point cloud of a model.
Warning: Name is nonexistent or not a directory: toolbox

Undefined function or variable 'read_mesh'.
Error in eg_skeleton_laplacian_rosa (line 20)
[P.pts,P.faces] = read_mesh(P.filename); 
Are the mex files build to run on linux? I am running the example and am getting the following error:
