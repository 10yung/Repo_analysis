### Description

Thanks for this great add-on, I'm coming from Chromium / vimium... Would it be possible to add similar functionality - by typing `gi`, the first input on the page is focused? Very useful for sites like Google Maps.
Every time I type one of the keybindings documented, firefox defaults to searching for words on the current page that match the letters typed. 

I'm sure this is something dumb (not a problem with vim-vixen), but I've spent the past hour trying to turn off this default setting. As an example, if I want to scroll and I type `h`, it will just search for the letters on the page with an `h` in them.

Please help -- I'm on MacOS with the latest version of firefox.
I'm using vim-vixen (the latest) with `Mozilla Firefox 71.0` on Linux, Fedora 30.

I've added some custom bindings e.g.:
```
    "x": { "type": "tabs.close" },
    "J": { "type": "tabs.prev" },
    "K": { "type": "tabs.next" },
```
Now when I press `x`, `J`, or `K`, the behavior will repeat - e.g. `x` instead of closing a tab will close every single tab until Firefox exits.

Or, `J` will put me in an infinite `tabs.prev` loop, cycling through every single tab until I exit Firefox.

This broke during a Firefox upgrade - I'm trying to figure out which one, based on my previous upgrade history. Is this anything seen before, any ideas how I could solve it?

I'm a regular pocket user and I'm wondering if it's possible to have an add to pocket key combo build into vim vixen. I don't mind implementing it myself if someone points me in the right direction.

### Description
The idea is to make it so that the shortcuts proposed to open links only use the left side of the keyboard. Sure it would increase the length of the shortcuts in most cases but if you have only one hand on the keybord it would be nice.
For those with one hand on the mouse and the other clicking on f : it would be faster
For those not using the mouse if could be faster too

Of course special care will have to be taken for the different kind of keyboards out there

Thanks for reading !

### Failure Information (for bugs)
You can see the pictures I uploaded. I circled the repeat button.
This button with change between show and hide, but in web display it is one.
But vim-vixen will generate two buttons.
A button generated by vim vixen blocks another.

I installed this extension and opened Wikipedia.
This image is displayed on the website before I press F.
