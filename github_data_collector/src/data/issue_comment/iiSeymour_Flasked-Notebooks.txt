Hey this is great stuff - I'm really excited by this concept.

I just tried running your example (made no code changes) and somehow got this error ZMQSocketChannel object has no attribute 'execute'. 

Is this something you have run into before? Could it be my IPython version?

Thanks!

Yep, I used flask at the beginning of nbviewer, but we definitively need something async
to handle many requests in parallel hence we moved to tornado.

Cool, using ipython/ipython#5639 and ipython/ipython#5720 nbconvert should get the ability to run the notebook on the fly which will then only be a config option on nbviewer.
your input on it would be great. It won't be enable by default for obvious performance reasons, and also because most of the time we won't get the library installed.

Yes, work great locally for me.

> Notebooks are rendered within the existing flask site using the normal templating approach.

I'm not sure I get what you mean here. Can you develop ? Do you think we can do better in nbviewer itself ?

> Pages can be developed by starting the IPython Notebook server in the notebooks directory.

I do not get that either, do you mean that your app is serving files from the local filesystem ?
