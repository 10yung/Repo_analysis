I need to convert the last 5 pages of a docx file to pdf.

I have two questions:

1. how to count the total number of pages of a docx file by code?
2. is it possible to tell last 5 pages without knowing the exact number of pages of a docx?


How easy would it be to use a different version of LibreOffice? v6.3 breaks certain formatting for a handful of documents while v6.2 appears to be more reliable.

Taking a look at the Dockerfile didn't make this immediately obvious, so I'm here instead ðŸ˜„ 
Using the latest version, I am trying to convert some old DOC/XLS/PPT files into PDF and everything works fine, but not the images (I have the same files in the new formats and the conversion is correct)

Having a look at the logs doesn't look like any error...

I included the converted file and a ZIP of the original one
[test.doc.zip](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/gotenberg/files/3983520/test.doc.zip)
[test.doc1576757500369.pdf](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/gotenberg/files/3983509/test.doc1576757500369.pdf)



Thanks, 


#45  Expected Behavior

Hello, I set the print title in excel and set the top two lines as the title. But I found that when the output is pdf, this setting does not take effect. Can you consider adding this function?Thanks.

## Your Environment
<!--- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->
* Version used:6.1.1
* Operating System and version:centos 7


when invoking the /convert/office endpoint, I send a list of files (POST form-data)

if all are valid (office format etc.), the call succeeds with 200 OK
if one or more are invalid (e.g. .zip file) the call still succeeds with 200 OK - it should return 206 PARTIAL CONTENT or 400 Bad Request


Replaced others with singular form "other"

I am using the gotenberg docker to convert a docx containing relative file links into a pdf.
The link path are not kept through the convertion:
For a link `file:///./annexes/dir/file.xlsx`, after convertion, the link is transformed into `../../.././annexes/dir/file.xlsx`  instead of `./annexes/dir/file.xlsx`

## Expected Behavior

For a link (in the OOXML) `file:///./annexes/dir/file.xlsx`, after convertion, the link is should be `./annexes/dir/file.xlsx`

## Current Behavior
For a link `file:///./annexes/dir/file.xlsx`, after convertion, the link is transformed into `../../.././annexes/dir/file.xlsx`  instead of `./annexes/dir/file.xlsx`

## Possible Solution
Not really sure what the issue is, i haven't looked much into the code of the conversion yet. It may be due to the command used to launch the conversion (The link is correct when i use `unoconv -f pdf testing.docx` to do the conversion). 
Maybe launch the command from inside the temporary directory created

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
[testing ll.pdf](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/gotenberg/files/3836006/testing.ll.pdf)
[testing ll.docx](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/gotenberg/files/3836007/testing.ll.docx)

I joined a docx (and the converted pdf) where the issue is visible. To reproduce:
1. Create a docx with a link to a file or download the docx file provided
2. Launch the conversion to pdf
3. Check the link in the pdf

## Logs (LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG")
Not really useful here, except for the command launch to convert
```
{"level":"debug","msg":"executing command: unoconv --user-profile ///tmp/45281 --port 45281 --format pdf --output /gotenberg/tmp/BNKaM8uNWfGsAzpvkbQzMDlvuDvFqvyO/0qH9WdO4R3yHZGmppRreJEGa36S8h8xe6.pdf /gotenberg/tmp/BNKaM8uNWfGsAzpvkbQzMDlvuDvFqvyO/testing.docx","op":"xexec.LogBeforeExecute","time":"2019-11-12T12:04:10Z","trace":"BNKaM8uNWfGsAzpvkbQzMDlvuDvFqvyO"}
```

## Context
This is for delivering a archive containing the pdf and a list of assorted xls files which can be opened from the pdf (or the docx) instead of needing to browse through the folder to find the right one  

## Your Environment
I reproduced the issue with a simple `docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -e LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG" thecodingmachine/gotenberg:6` and a curl post request `curl --request POST --url http://localhost:3000/convert/office --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' --form files=@PATH_TO_FILE/testing.docx -o ./result.pdf ` 

Hey, guys. It could be cool if during PDF merging or even in separate endpoint we can change size of PDF to normal if pages are too big. 

## Expected Behavior
Every page in the document will be resized to "normal" size. Especially big pages. 

## Current Behavior
Currently, nothing changed. 

## Possible Solution
Resize every page in PDF is they are too big. 

Hello in Quick Start Section says em that 
the API is available in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

When my docker image is up my http://localhost:4000 says me 

> "an internal error has occurred: please contact technical support"
I have run a image with a docker-compose file. So you know that I write in compose file anything to view the API?.

Best regards
