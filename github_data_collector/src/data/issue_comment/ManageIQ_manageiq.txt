Opening this as WIP for now pending a better description and more testing ...

This gets us very close to solving https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-pods/issues/353
Followup to https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/19732, this updates the specs under spec/tools and spec/lib to use `RSpec.describe` on the outer describe block.
As a user, I want to import buttons with their associated dialog by executing this from the CLI -` bin/rake evm:import:custom_buttons -- --source /tmp/cfexport/buttons/CustomButtons.yaml
`
As a user, I cannot see anywhere in this file that indicates what dialog to associate with the button. I imported the dialogs and then ran this command and there is no association.

Using the  command above, the YAML doesn't contain a key for the dialog and the API doesn't allow a dialog to be retrieved or specified. MIQEXPORT contained a day called `dialog_label`.


Create a Event that will check for 'Service Request Finished' and fetch `Service Request ID'

When  service_provision_request is finished (request_state="finished") I would like to update SNow_requestID with the service_provision_request status (using SNOW API)
If two Catalog Items in a Catalog Bundle are not dependent, as a user, I  want the two different Catalog items in Catalog Bundle to execute in parallel to reduce execution time of the bundle.
Regex Validator displayed when the Catalog is ordered, Add a custom per-field "validation failed" message. 

Add a custom per-field "validation failed" message rather than displaying the entire regex to be validated


When testing the changes done to the migration workflow, we identified a few issues that are fixed by this pull request.

1. If the virtual machine is powered on  and doesn't have an IP address, it will stay in the `waiting_for_ip_address` state until timeout. And the timeout will fail the migration. We register the IP addresses of the VM in `preflight_check` method and check the list is not empty.

2. When an error occurs, the infra_conversion_job cancel the migration_task, that in turn cancels the job. It leads to a duplicate cancellation.

Please implement a rich text label control that we can use to provide free text. The label control should allow:

- Free text input.
- Ideally a small subset of Markdown (e.g. lists, headings, sizing), or something equivalent.
- Ideally allow for dynamic updates, like other dialog controls.

Currently there is no way to add a simple, basic label control to service dialogs. In order to provide guidance to users, you need to either make use of the help tooltips (which are not immediately obvious), or create a workaround such as a disabled textarea field.



There is functionality to add Lifecycle Events and the functionality is documented. Want to see them in the timeline.  Want to see list of events that have occurred with VM object.

As an admin, i want to be able to send the provision request through the api, providing the details of the user the request should be run by instead of the admin user. (Admin impersonating the user)
