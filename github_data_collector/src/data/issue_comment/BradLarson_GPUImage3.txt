I call GPUImage method from another class(Filter.swift) with completion handler.

```
let toonFilter = ToonFilter()
      let filteredImage = image.filterWithOperation(toonFilter)
      completion(filteredImage)
```

and I use completion handler to put on imageView but sometimes with some images it crash with this error **Failed loading image texture**
Hi,

Is there motion detection in this library? If it has, how can i use it?
Fragment Function(zoomBlurFragment): argument uniform[0] from buffer(1) with offset(0) and length(12) has space for 12 bytes, but argument has a length(16).'
how can i fix this . and Motion blur code commented . is it work ?
validateFunctionArguments:3485: failed assertion `Fragment Function(vignetteFragment): argument uniform[0] from buffer(1) with offset(0) and length(40) has space for 40 bytes, but argument has a length(48).'
Hi,

I have an iOS project that uses GPUImage to load .acv files to manipulate images. I was just wondering if it would be possible to implement the Tone Curve feature in GPUImage3?

Thanks

I have an application which is displaying video stream.
in the application AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer() is using to display separate video
I found AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer() is not return for 10 minutes at least when I kill the application after start capturing with following code

```
      phoneCamera = try Camera(sessionPreset: .vga640x480)
      phoneCamera.runBenchmark = false
      phoneCamera --> renderView
      phoneCamera.startCapture()
```
I took the code from the sample code
it happens iOS iPhone 13.x only
the problem is not happened on iOS 12.x or iOS iPad 13.x

Thanks!
Hi,

I try to add some noise overlay to an image with the following:

var picture = PictureInput(image:UIImage(named:"IMG_3331.jpg")!)
var blendImage = PictureInput(image:UIImage(named:"Noise.jpg")!)
let opacityFilter = OpacityAdjustment()
let blendFilter = OverlayBlend()

opacityFilter.opacity = mySlider.value

blendImage --> opacityFilter --> blendFilter
picture --> blendFilter --> renderView

blendImage.processImage()

When the opacityFilter.opacity is 0 then I see the Noise.jpg completely (expected that I don't see it at all), and when opacityFilter.opacity is 1 then I see the Noise.jpg only slightly as an overlay.

What is the issue?
This isn't an issue, but more of a question. Is there a way to attach the GPUImageFilters to a running AVCaptureSession?
Can anyone please guide me through implementing GPUImageSkinToneFilter  using this GPUImage3 framework. Thanks in advance.
Seems like there is no implementation for AverageLuminanceExtractor() which I was using from GPUImage2.  I'm trying to get the overall brightness from the camera.  

Any suggestions?  Or, is this something that might be implemented soon?
