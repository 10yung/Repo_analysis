Do you think it would be possible to insert `;` at the end of lines that are not followed by an indented block?

This would allow the infamous postfix operator problem to go away:

``` scala
import sys.process._

"mkdir test" !
println("Done.")
```

Different from:

``` scala
"mkdir test" !
    println("Done.")  // now interpreted as an argument to `!`
```

Another refinement would be that if the next line starts with an indented operator, it has the same semantics as if the whole block was surrounded by parentheses in normal Scala:

``` scala
val r = 2
        + 2
        - 1
```

i.e.,

``` scala
val r = (2
        + 2
        - 1)
```
