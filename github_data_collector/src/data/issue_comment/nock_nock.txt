Fixes #1836

@mastermatt @paulmelnikow, sorry but I had to make a new PR because I fucked up git when doing a rebase. Would be great if you could release this ASAP so that we can fix https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/issues/316

## The devDependency [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) was updated from `16.0.0-beta.47` to `16.0.0`.

</ul>
<h3>BREAKING CHANGES</h3>
<p>Require Node.js &gt;= 10.13</p>
<hr>
<p>Use Git notes to store the channels on which a version has been released.</p>
<p>This feature change the way semantic-release keep track of the channels on which a version has been released.<br>
It now use a JSON object stored in a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-notes" rel="nofollow">Git note</a> instead of Git tags formatted as v{version}@{channel}.</p>
<p>The tags formatted as v{version}@{channel} will now be ignored.<br>
<strong>If you have made releases with v16.0.0-beta on branches other than the default one you will have to update your repository.</strong><br>
<strong>If you have never used v16.0.0-beta nothing has to be done in your repo.</strong></p>
<p>The changes to make consist in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding all the versions that have been released on a branch other than the default one by searching for all tags formatted v{version}@{channel}</li>
<li>For each of those version:
<ul>
<li>Create a tag without the {<a class="user-mention" data-hovercard-type="organization" data-hovercard-url="/orgs/channel/hovercard" href="https://urls.greenkeeper.io/channel">@channel</a>} if none doesn't already exists</li>
<li>Add a Git note to the tag without the {<a class="user-mention" data-hovercard-type="organization" data-hovercard-url="/orgs/channel/hovercard" href="https://urls.greenkeeper.io/channel">@channel</a>} containing the channels on which the version was released formatted as <code>{"channels":["channel1","channel2"]}</code> and using <code>null</code> for the default channel (for example.<code>{"channels":[null,"channel1","channel2"]}</code>)</li>
<li>Push the tags and notes</li>
<li>Update the GitHub releases that refer to a tag formatted as v{version}@{channel} to use the tag without it</li>
<li>Delete the tags formatted as v{version}@{channel}</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Git CLI version 2.7.1 or higher is now required</p>
<p>The <code>--merge</code> option of the <code>git tag</code> command has been added in Git version 2.7.1 and is now used by semantic-release</p>
<hr>
<p>Regexp are not supported anymore for property matching in the <code>releaseRules</code> option.</p>
<p>Regex are replaced by <a href="https://urls.greenkeeper.io/micromatch/micromatch#matching-features">globs</a>. For example <code>/core-.*/</code> should be changed to <code>'core-*'</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The <code>branch</code> option has been removed in favor of <code>branches</code></p>
<p>The new <code>branches</code> option expect either an Array or a single branch definition. To migrate your configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to publish package from multiple branches, please the configuration documentation</li>
<li>If you use the default configuration and want to publish only from <code>master</code>: nothing to change</li>
<li>If you use the <code>branch</code> configuration and want to publish only from one branch: replace <code>branch</code> by <code>branches</code> (<code>"branch": "my-release-branch"</code> =&gt; <code>"branches": "my-release-branch"</code>)</li>

Your [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io) Bot :palm_tree:

**What is the expected behavior?**

Expected that the following would block requests to `https://domain.com`
```
nock('https://domain.com');
```

**What is the actual behavior?**
It doesn't! It looks like the scope will only intercept the request once a complete interception (scope, request, reply) is in place.

**Possible solution**
Perhaps update the docs to clarify this? I don't really have a position on whether it should block requests to that domain or not without a full setup, but I do feel that this should be documented b/c the shape of the process made me think that the scope was sufficient to block requests to that domain :) 

The current implementation only supports `req.setTimeout`, but Node.js
allows for `options.timeout` to accomplish the same.

https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v12.x/api/http.html#http_http_request_url_options_callback


This is a bigger task, so I'm just adding a draft PR here to show with actual code what I'm referring to.

This is a follow up to #1846.

Such mistakes in the type definitions is likely to be the symptom of not validating the type definitions against the actual project.

Running TypeScript on the JS-code would help fix that.

Also enforcing best practices on the JSDoc comments will help.

On top of that, if you like, one can now generate the type definitions from ones JSDoc comments: https://dev.to/voxpelli/how-to-use-typescript-3-7-to-generate-declarations-from-jsdoc-a95 That way one can keep it more DRY, at the disadvantage of some more complex type expressions not being possible to define in JSDoc alone. Then one can combine the two though I believe.
Hi.
I'm having a hard time getting around this. I'm using Moch, Chai, Chai-Http and Axios.

One idea I had was to try to strip out the offending header(s).
In my unit test I think the Content-length header is getting set somewhere and I'm not sure how to strip it out or get around this issue.

Any ideas? Thanks!

**Context**

I'm trying to mock requests of a scraper I built that uses Puppeteer. I'd like to be able to mock the requests the Puppeteer browser makes to test the scraper properly. Just to clarify, I don't mean mocking requests _inside_ the Puppeteer browser environment, I'm hoping to mock requests in the tests that launch the browser.

The Puppeteer API has a [nice `setRequestInterceptor` hook](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#pagesetrequestinterceptionvalue) that `nock` could take advantage of. It _seems_ to have most of the features required for a full nock-compatible API but I'd appreciate if someone familiar with the `nock` codebase could chime in.

**Alternatives**

I haven't found any decent nock-compatible library out there that could help with Puppeteer.

**Has the feature been requested before?**

After searching the issues, I don't believe so.

**If the feature request is accepted, would you be willing to submit a PR?**

_Maybe_ (I can try but I can't commit to anything, I'm afraid I don't have the time)

I am facing same thing. I am not able to get headers inside 
```
nock(...).reply(function(uri, requestBody) {
console.log(this.req.headers)
})
```

I tried using `.matchHeader()` but inside this too.. no headers are coming.
but during `recorder`,  `nock` is able to capture `reqheaders`. I am really stuck and don't know what to do.


| Software   | Version(s) |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Nock       |     10.0.1       |
| Node       |     10.16.0       |
| TypeScript |            |

New Relic (https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic) is overwriting _http.get_ and _http.request_ like you do in https://github.com/mastermatt/nock/blob/master/lib/common.js#L102. But when _http.get_ is calling _http.request_ like here, a call to _http.get_ will call _http.request_ twice when using nock in a New Relic test. 

To prove that this is not native Node behaviour (at least on Node 12):
```js
const http = require('http');

function request() {
  console.log('http.request', arguments);
}

http.request = request;

// our request function is not called
http.get('http://google.com', () => {});
```

Looks like this change in https://github.com/mastermatt/nock/blob/master/lib/common.js#L102-L104 works:
```js
const req = newRequest(proto, overriddenGet.bind(module), [
  input,
  options,
  callback,
])
req.end()
return req
```
