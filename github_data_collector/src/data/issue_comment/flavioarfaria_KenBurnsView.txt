Hi, 

Encountered an issue when trying to upload a new build of an app to Google Play Console:

> New permissions added
> Warning:
> 
> Users that have the APK with version code XX may need to accept the android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE permission, which may result in them not upgrading to this version of the app.
> 
> Tip:
> 
> Ensure that the new permissions are necessary, and consider mentioning these permissions in the What's new in this release text.

Since this is a permission I did not explicitly add I investigated the AndroidManifest.xml of my app and Google was right. 

The manifest merger report stated:

> uses-permission#android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE
> IMPLIED from /Users/jesper/Developer/_android/iap-core-android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:2:1-18:12 reason: com.flaviofaria.kenburnsview has a targetSdkVersion < 4

I'd imagine this is unintended and would love to have a fix for where the targetSdkVersion is 
[4 or higher](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_PHONE_STATE).

Note for anyone else having this issue, there is a quickfix:
`<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" tools:node="remove"/>`

Hi @alaeri 

is there any way to change animation on aniamtion complete and also change image with time duration?

Thanks (_)
Hello! Please, add my app to your list. Thank you!
My scenario is actually i'm using this kenBurnsView in collapsing toolbar and bellow collapsing toolbar i have viewpager and tablayout.  I'm changing the image as  

```
mViewPager.setOnPageChangeListener(new ViewPager.OnPageChangeListener() {
            @Override
            public void onPageScrolled(int position, float positionOffset, int positionOffsetPixels) {
                changeHeaderImage(position);
            }
```
the problem is when i touch the screen for swiping viewpager image moves arbitrarily until i stop touching it.

Unable to start activity as it giving RuntimeException plus
Error in inflating class com.flaviofaria.kenburnsview.KenBurnsView.
Error caused by android.view.InflateException.

Please resolve.


I was playing with this but found when the KenBurnsView size is being animated (I'm actually animating the weight of other views which is causing the KenBurnsView to resize) it goes kind of crazy.  It seems the drawing does not take into account the fact that the KenBurnsView size has changed between frames :-(
hello ,use the project in  open android studio,android studio  show info : Error:(59, 0) No such property: ossrhUsername for class: org.gradle.api.publication.maven.internal.ant.DefaultGroovyMavenDeployer,what it's mean,Hope to reply,thanks.

Hi,  I would like to set a time to start the animation after this is opened? Is this possible? Thank you
Add getter methods like 
`boolean isPaused()`
`boolean isPlaying()`
Thanks
