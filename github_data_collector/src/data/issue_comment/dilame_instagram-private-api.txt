 - `enc_password` was added and is now supported
 - **Controversial:** I've also updated the constants, because this version was one of the first to use the `enc_password` but this isn't very important and can be removed.

**YOUR QUESTION HERE**

So, I'm making an Instagram chatbot. When a user sends 'hello' to the user, it replies 'hello!'. It works perfectly.

But sometimes, the bot account doesn't know a new user account and it throws the following error:
`IgExactUserNotFoundError: User with exact username not found.`

This error comes from the code which try to reply to the user. And it happens when the bot receive a "DM Request". By looking for a few hours, I could find the solution myself, but the problem is that I can't reproduce the bug, since I need a new instagram account for each test (else it won't trigger a dm request).
So I was wondering if you'd know how to do that:

* when a message is received from the FBNS client, detect if it's a real message or if it's blocked by a DM request.
* automatically accept the DM request.
* send a message to the user.

I don't know if that's possible and if so, I very much hope you know how, @Nerixyz...
🙏🙏

I am developing an Progressive Web Application , by part of this App ,user is able to search an Instagram page and fetch all public info about page ( followers, following , bio, ...) , Since this app will have a lot of users, if a lot of user call to back-end at the same time and back-end code call to Instagram private api based on one specific account then Instagram platform will banded this account , so I am ganna to know that is it possible to force user Login in through Instagram OAuth and when user received access token then we use this Token for login and fetch data from Instagram directly  on client side?

I would like to know if it wouldn't be possible to create a real object-oriented library, a bit like [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).
For example, a `User` class, with the following properties:
```js
username: string;
followers: User[];
followed: Boolean; // Whether the client is following they
biography: string;
// etc...
// methods:
send()
follow()
block()
// etc...
```
And for example, for the message event (using your library, @Nerixyz):
```js
client.on('message', (message) => {
	message.author; // User
    message.reply('content'); // shortcut for message.author.send()
	// so we can do
    message.author.follow();
});
```
I don't know if making a library like discord.js for instagram would be possible, maybe it's not at all the same and I'm imagining impossible things but it would still be great to be able to do that.
Currently it's not optimized at all.
When you want to send a message you have to fetch the thread, something like that would be more optimized, I think:

## Question

Hi

I am trying to get all of my following

I follow 7500 people(the maximum allowed)

but when i tried to get them all i get only 7395

The 105 missing is the 105 users whom i followed first (5 years ago)

This is the code

```
friendshipsRouter.get('/getAllUserFollowingFast/:username', (req,res ,next) => {
    (async() => {
        const targetUser = await ig.user.searchExact(req.params.username);
        let feed = ig.feed.accountFollowing(targetUser.pk);
        let allResults = [];
        let currentPage;
        do {
            currentPage = await feed.items(); //
            currentPage.users.forEach(user => {
                allResults.push(user.username);
            });
        }
        while(feed.isMoreAvailable());

        res.send({allFollowing:allResults, number : allResults.length});
    })()
});

```

Does anyone have an idea how to solve this?
Is this wrong version code  or does it changing for different countries?
Because when I check on Instagram's original App User-Agent is;
Instagram 117.0.0.28.123 Android (27/8.1.0; 440dpi; 1080x2030; Xiaomi/xiaomi; Redmi Note 5; whyred; qcom; en_US; 180322800)

**YOUR QUESTION HERE**
I have an angular client
And node js server uses this api
When I sent a request from the client with username and password, it goes to the server, but then the server needs the sms code sent to the client. 
How do I ask it from the client ?

Is it possible ? I am making an http post request but it doesn’t support multiple interactions in one request

We have a business account and we have uploaded a list of products on facebook and we can tag these products on our Instagram post. Like in the picture below 
 ![Screen Shot 2019-12-24 at 5 02 38 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5880982/71414228-5b1bdf00-266f-11ea-848f-5b5b325a3393.png)

Is it possible to tag products on Instagram posts using this API?
