Welcome
Is it possible to change the DPI for JPG?
For now I have to deal in the following way, but it slows down work, because the image must be sent to the server to change DPI in PHP.

JS:
```
var pdf = $('#pdf_area > .ol-viewport')[0];
	
	
domtoimage.toJpeg(pdf,
 { 
 quality : 1
 }
 )
  .then(function (dataUrl) {

	 // alert(dataUrl);
	  //########################################################
	
	$.ajax({            // ajax
    type     : "POST",
    url      : "dpi_change.php",
    data     : {
              ajax_dataUrl : dataUrl,
			  ajax_pdf_zoom_terrain_number : pdf_zoom_terrain_number
			   }
    ,
     context: this,
        
    success : function(callback) { 
	
	
	var link = document.createElement('a');
        link.download = 'Teren_numer_' + pdf_zoom_terrain_number +'.jpg';
        link.href = callback;
        link.click();
	
	                        }  //success
    
               });     //ajax     
```

PHP:

```
$ajax_dataUrl = isset($_POST['ajax_dataUrl']) ? $_POST['ajax_dataUrl'] : '';
$ajax_pdf_zoom_terrain_number = isset($_POST['ajax_pdf_zoom_terrain_number']) ? $_POST['ajax_pdf_zoom_terrain_number'] : '';


$path = $ajax_dataUrl;

$del_string = 'data:image/jpeg;base64,';
$path = str_replace($del_string, "", $path);
$path = base64_decode($path);
$image = substr_replace($path, pack("cnn", 1, 180, 180), 13, 5);

$enc = base64_encode($image);
$callback = $del_string.$enc;
echo $callback;
```

### Use case: description, code 
I'm using `dom-to-image` to generate little cards for users on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)

See https://repl.it/@micahlt/GetThatDesc for the full project.

### Expected behavior
It'll generate a PNG of the `card` div and download it.  

### Actual behavior (stack traces, console logs etc)
```Error while reading CSS rules from https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/css/materialize.min.css 

SecurityError: Failed to read the 'cssRules' property from 'CSSStyleSheet': Cannot access rules

Error while reading CSS rules from https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Mono&display=swap SecurityError:

cannot fetch resource: https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/1882674_60x60.png?v=, status: 0
```
(And no, it doesn't download the image)

### Library version
I'm using the latest version.

### Browser

- [ ] Chrome 49+  



I went a problem, it's work on android.But the resolution ratio is lowly. So I modified some source code, then it's success.

Can I submit my changes?


- ionic4
-cordova9



Instead of hardcoding node_modules and bower components into the build tree, simply specify them as yarn package.json dependencies.

Updated the karma config to pick them up from the new location.
Removed bower as a installation tool in favor of the npm packaging
### Presence of GNU Licensed files

Some of the files in this module seem to be licensed under GNU General Public License.
Hence, we are unable to use this module for our proprietary software. 
Is there a workaround for this or are there any alternatives?

Hello, I has a problem,the picture is not really clear. How to improve the image quality? Can you add a option, like scale. We can scale the canvas before render.
Hello all,

I'm using this library to generate images from node, with 1200x600 dimensions. This node contains several small images, at least 4 other small images. 

None of those small images  appear in the generated image. 

Here is my code: 

```
            domtoimage.toPng(document.getElementById('main'), { quality: 0.95, width:1200, height:600 })
    .then(function (dataUrl) {
        var link = document.createElement('a');
        /*link.download = '{{file}}';
        link.href = dataUrl;
        link.click();*/
        var img = new Image();
        img.src = dataUrl;
        document.body.appendChild(img);
    });
```
On Firefox, I have a problem for fetching resource (Javascript error). It does not work. 
On Chrome, It's working, except there is no image. 

In a local environment, this works perfectly. 

Someone has an idea? 

Thanks all,

Alexander
