  Issues on GitHub are only related to problems of Swagger-Editor itself. We'll try

### Q&A (please complete the following information)
 - OS: Windows 10
 - Browser: chrome
 - Version: 79.0.3945.117
 - Method of installation: npm running node express to serve swagger
 - Swagger-Editor version: 3.7.1
 - Swagger/OpenAPI version: OpenAPI 3.0.1

### Content & configuration

Example Swagger/OpenAPI definition:
```yaml
# your YAML here
```

Swagger-Editor configuration options:
```js
SwaggerEditorBundle({
        url: "myfile-api.yaml",
        dom_id: '#swagger-editor',
        layout: 'StandaloneLayout',
        presets: [
          SwaggerEditorStandalonePreset
        ],
        plugins: [
          TransmitSpecOnChangePlugin
        ]
      });
```

### Describe the bug you're encountering
We have a swagger doc with lots of external file references.  When loading the doc in chrome it dumps out a bunch of errors and the api endpoints are not loading.  Here is a detailed output of the first error: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25829792/72365899-62ef0200-36b6-11ea-920a-ec7ba5c2c5cf.png)

Perhaps it's this line:

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. install swagger editor standalone dist and run it with node - express
2. Add ref to external .yaml files
3. Run the server and open a chrome browser
4. See errors

### Expected behavior
It should work like it does in firefox or edge.  No errors in those browsers.



I have a swagger editor hosted locally on some https url.
My Api's are on http. when calling the api i am getting above mentioned error.
Is there any way i can avoid (**TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource**.) which seem due to CORS or un-matched schemes.
On my calling api i have have added CORS exception for my swagger api url which is on https but still getting same error.
Any way i can avoid this error by changing something in swagger editor hosted locally
### Q&A (please complete the following information)
 - OS: Docker container in Linux
 - Browser: Chrome
 - Version: Version 78.0.3904.97 (Official Build) (64-bit)
 - Method of installation: Official Docker image
 - Swagger-Editor version: `latest` tag in Docker Hub
 - Swagger/OpenAPI version: OpenAPI 3.0

### Content & configuration

**Example OpenAPI definition:**
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: 'Test'
  version: 1.0.0

paths:
  /test:
    get:
      responses:
        '200':
          description: 'OK'
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: integer
                minItems: 3
                maxItems: 5
```

### Describe the bug you're encountering

The Swagger Editor is ignoring the `minItems` attribute of an `array`-type response when auto-generating example values. Currently, only one item is being generated regardless of the `minItems` declaration in the schema.

### To reproduce...

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a new API specification
2. Copy/paste the minimum example in this issue
3. Refer to the right-panel with the API preview
4. Open the `/test` endpoint path and verify the example value being generated for the response

### Expected behavior

Auto-generated example value showing at least `minItems` elements in the array. For the example in this issue, it should be showing something like this: `[0, 0, 0]`.

### Screenshots

Copied oauth2-redirect.html from the swagger-ui
project into the dist folder and updated the
Dockerfile to include the file where it could
be served by nginx. This page is called by the
authroization server after the user is redirected
back. The page should add the access token provided
by the auth server to subsequent request.

1. Pulled the repo and created a local docker image
```
git pull https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor
## After making my changes
docker build -t swaggerapi/swagger-editor .
docker run -d -p 80:8080 -v $PWD:/tmp -e SWAGGER_FILE=/tmp/swagger.yaml swaggerapi/swagger-editor
```
seems to load correct `yaml` definition that only exists on my local machine in current dir.

### Q&A (please complete the following information)

 - OS: Arch Linux
 - Browser: Firefox and Chromium
 - Version: Respectively 70.0-1 and 78.0.3904.70-1
 - Method of installation: Installing what, my browsers? Through pacman. I did not install the swagger editor as I used https://editor.swagger.io/.
 - Swagger-Editor version: Whatever version was live on 2019-10-31
 - Swagger/OpenAPI version: Not relevant

### Content & configuration

Whatever is used in production; you know this better than me.

### Describe the bug you're encountering

When trying to import a URL into the editor (through File -> Import URL), no error is given when the URL given does not return a swagger file. More specifically, I tried loading some json file from some project on Github into the swagger editor, but, being the bumbling fool that I am, directly used `https://github.com/some/project/blob/master/some/dir/something.swagger.json`. Of course I should have used `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/some/project/master/some/dir/something.swagger.json` (and this did work). However, when the first link did not load successfully, no error or warning or feedback of any kind was given.

### To reproduce...

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to https://editor.swagger.io/
2. Click on "File" -> "Import URL"
3. Input `https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore/blob/master/src/main/resources/openapi.yaml`
4. It fails silently, without error.
5. Retry with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore/master/src/main/resources/openapi.yaml`
6. It works.

### Expected behavior

An error message, ideally one giving a noob-friendly explanation of what went wrong.

### How can we help?
I'm not certain if this is a bug or working as expected.  I'm trying to determine the most efficient way of describing examples for a ContactPoint that could be of type email or telephone.  If I reference an example from the components within a schema then the value object from the example is also depicted in the rendered response body.  I've tried removing the value object from the example component, but this is interpreted as invalid.  If I reference the example from the components within the response body directly, the rendered example correctly depicts the intended structure of the example.

### Describe the bug you're encountering
The object name in the preview is the last of the `allOf`, masking the allOf. Even more, navigating to the included hyperlink leads to another (non-superimposed but partial) representation of the object.

### To reproduce...
Fill in above example and examine result in preview.

### Expected behavior
Instead of the name of the last $ref in the `allOf`, have an anonymous name or a list of "`allof -> ...`"

### How can we help?
I am usin WSL on win10. installed swagger and swagger-editor globally using npm. 
I am following a beginner's tutorial where i just created a basic API from scratch using `swagger project create <project> ` followed by `swagger project start`.
issue is i cant open the editor - running `swagger project edit` i get an error for no browser to open the endpoint url on WSL, leaving that aside as a WSL configuration issue, i tried opening the url http://127.0.0.1:10010/#/edit in chrome but i only get a "Cannot GET /" error. 


 ### Content & configuration

### Is your feature request related to a problem?
Our swagger file has more than 3000 lines. Its very good that I can jump to the definition of a model or path by clicking the little arrow in the UI-preview window. It would be great if the inverse would be possible. 

Sadly I do not have any good proposition on how that could work. Maybe I if could push a keyboard button and click on the definiton or something like this.

Just an idea to help out users with large files.
