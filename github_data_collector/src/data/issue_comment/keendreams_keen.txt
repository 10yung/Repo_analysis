I added an improvement to the id_in code ...
[https://github.com/sparky4/16/blob/master/src/lib/16_in.c#L870](url) ^^;

what do you think of this? ^^;?

So first of all, I am really excited about this release. I have find a lot of fun in porting things and changing games for modern systems and such. I have a few issues and some things I wanted to bring up, just for discussion and general interest.

First, the way you have to compile it. There are multiple versions of Borland C++, and many companies have owned it, changed it, etc. Even with a version number and compiler name, it is proprietary and commercial, and I didn't want to go searching for different versions and such as I'm not sure who owns what and what versions are good or popular. It is very confusing. My recommendation with this is to go with something more easily accessed for free, like Visual Studio, GNU C compiler, Eclipse, NetBeans, anything really. I'm not sure how porting project and build files would work, whether it would be a simple task or whether it would take re-writing parts of the project. I would be willing to help in any way that I can. Even so, I think for any future endeavors, changing compilers may be a good idea. Unless there is something I am missing and I'm just stupid. :laughing: 

Another thing is the PIRACY.SCN file. I was curious as to how this worked. It looks like a bunch of characters that doesn't make any logical sense as far as I can tell.

Also, what are the various branches for? They are fairly recent, so I assume they have a good reason. The README is the same though...

Lastly, is there documentation on the files needed for the full game, as well as the file formats used in said game? I don't own the game physically, and I haven't checked the files but I assume it would be useful to know if the graphics files were this, the audio was this, etc.

Thanks for doing this, and I hope good things will come because of the source release! :smile:
