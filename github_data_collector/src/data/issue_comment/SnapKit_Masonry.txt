### Issue Description
我们SDK使用的1.0版本，我参照最新版本Masonry分类在SDK中增加了一个VIew的分类以支持safeArea,在SDK中正常运行，当SDK加入其它项目，且该项目也有Masonry（1.0）时，safeArae的调用会崩溃在该项目的 MASViewContraint 的 setSecondViewAttribute: 方法中，进入了NAAssert.
lldb信息如下：
(lldb) po [secondViewAttribute isKindOfClass:MASViewAttribute.class]
 nil
(lldb) po [secondViewAttribute class]
MASViewAttribute

(lldb) po MASViewAttribute.class
MASViewAttribute

手动注释NSAssert 且拷贝上方代码: 
_secondViewAttribute = secondViewAttribute;
UI正常如预期显示。。。。求解啊。。。
