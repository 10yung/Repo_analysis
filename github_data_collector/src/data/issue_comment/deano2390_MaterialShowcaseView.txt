the library's dismiss text is not working in sequence mode.Only got it text poped up last time.
This occurs for example with #88000000 (a dark mask).
Color.parseColor("#88000000) returns -2013265920.

Furthermore, while generally a good practice, there is no need to guard against unset values here, as the three color values are guaranteed to be set by the constructor of ShowcaseConfig.

Solves #184  and #17 
Hi,

great library! A couple of things I'm trying to do and wanted to know if they are bugs are something I am doing wrong:

* I tried setting ContentTextColor to white but it came out grey. I think its using some disabled version.
* I would like the dismiss and skip text to be on the same line instead of one below the other.

Will these changes require a fork? 

I having a navigation drawer with header and 2 custom linearlayouts, i need to add showcase for these view. how can i implement it.

It should be optional to get bottom margin for Navigation bar especially when the app uses full-screen mode with hiding Navigation bar.

Does anyone know how to draw canvas with full height including navigation bar? It doesn't overdraw even I set canvas bitmap's height for full (measured height + navigation bar height).

I'm revisiting a project I was assisting with from about a year ago. I was the last one to work on the project and there have been no changes to it since.

I pulled the project from Github and tried to build it in Android Studio but I keep running into this error during the gradle sync even when I update and revert the gradle version I'm using:

```
Could not find MaterialShowcaseView.aar (com.github.deano2390:MaterialShowcaseView:1.1.0).
Searched in the following locations:
    https://jitpack.io/com/github/deano2390/MaterialShowcaseView/1.1.0/MaterialShowcaseView-1.1.0.aar

I never had this problem at all the last time I worked on this project. What could be the cause of this?
In this library, how we use button in material showcase instead of dismiss text
I have implemented all the classes of this library in my project and its working fine for all the views. But still, I am not able to target the menu item of the Navigation Drawer. Can anyone help me on this as it is too much hampering my task?

some of my general implementations are

**In my Menu XML**
`   <item
                    android:id="@+id/solved_questions"
                    android:checked="false"
                    android:icon="@drawable/ic_description_black_24dp"
                    android:title="@string/menu_solved_questions"
                    app:showAsAction="ifRoom"
                    app:actionViewClass="android.widget.TextView"/>`

**In my JAVA class**
` viewsolvedQuestion = (TextView) navigationView.getMenu().findItem(R.id.solved_questions).getActionView();
showcaseView("Tap this to open solved question", "515", viewsolvedQuestion, LessonListActivity.this, new RectangleShape(900,200), null);`

**And my Method is**
`public static void showcaseView(String text, String id, View view, Activity activity, Shape shape, IShowcaseListener listener) {
        MaterialShowcaseView.Builder builder = new MaterialShowcaseView.Builder(activity)
                .setTarget(view)
                .setTitleText("")
                .setTargetTouchable(false)
                .setDismissOnTargetTouch(true)
                .setShape(shape)     
                .setDismissText("Got It")
                .setContentText(text)
                .renderOverNavigationBar()
                .singleUse(id)
                .setDelay(70);
        if (null != listener)
            builder.setListener(listener);
        builder.show();
    }`
In talk back mode the content behind the overlay is been readable. Need to focus only the overlay content in talk mode. Please share the code snippet to resolve. Thanks in advance.
