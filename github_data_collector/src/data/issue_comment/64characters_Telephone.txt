Our PBX is using RTP Port Range 10000-20000, but Telephone App has RTP Portrange hardcoded in https://github.com/64characters/Telephone/blob/master/Telephone/AKSIPUserAgent.m -> "accountConfig.rtp_cfg.port = 4000"

RTP Port Range should be freely configurable
When a call is made from an external source like opening a URL or from the Contacts app, the first enabled account in Telephone is used. Telephone should present a dialog for selecting an account for such outgoing call.
Telephone seems to be the most sleek and minimal (in the positive meaning) app I could find. Unfortunately in combination with an AVM Fritzbox the user experience is currently rather low. IMHO we have at least the following topics to improve:

- [ ] Support all [HD codecs](https://avm.de/service/fritzbox/fritzbox-7590/wissensdatenbank/publication/show/1008_Unterstutzte-Sprach-Codecs-bei-Internettelefonie/) instead of limiting codecs to G.711 only #68 
- [ ] Support internal [call transfers](https://github.com/64characters/Telephone/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=transfer)
- [ ] Support Fritzbox address book (although a web research only reveals articles explaining that this is not implemented on the Fritzbox side)

Probably there is more.

Are there plans to improve those topics? For example the current solution to force G.711 as codec works and reduces the call quality (compared to e.g. Zoiper). Being able to select the codecs to use for a SIP account would probably already help here.
I have a jabra headset and I connect using bluetooth. The headset works great, it is visible in the bluetooth selector and it is connected. I configured the bluetooth device in the telephone app as the input and output device. 

When I start bluetooth and then the telephone app all works. But after some time, later in the day when I get a call the headset is not propertly intialized. This also happens when I start a call. I can head in the headset that the headset starts to connect (little beep), however it seems to bee too late for telephone app or something. I get not audio and my phone partner neither. The solution then is to quite telephone app, restart and then it works. 

It seems to me that I did not have this problem a year ago, it might have been introduced with some bluetooth changes in MacOS 10.14. Is this a known issue? What can I do about it?
When we run out of "credit" with our VPBX provider, placing a call fails with a "Service Unavailable" error.

The error message is only visible for about half a second and then vanishes as the call window is closed almost immediately. All that's let is a "0 sec" history entry.

When a call fails, the history should say "Service Unavailable" instead of "0 sec".
We have a configuration with two accounts (with separate VoIP providers).

If we use a short and soft ringtone, we often miss calls (because we're not wearing the headset at all times).
.
If we use a long and loud ringtone, it stops us hearing the other party if a call gets in on one account while there's an active call on the other.

Possible solutions which occur to me:
a) Allow configuring a 2nd ringtone to use while there's an active call (other products use a short "beep" to indicate a call is waiting).
b) Show vistual indications but no ring for the 2nd call.
c) Just deliver a BUSY signal on the 2nd call and don't ring.

(Unfortunately the two providers use very different user ids, so we can't use issue #172 as a workaround)
Hi,
I've set the tel: protocol handler to Telephone.app using RCDefaultApp.
When I open a tel: link, Telephone opens, but doesn't start a call.
How do I fix that?
In Germany, it is common to include the local dialing prefix in parenthesis even when international number format is used, for example: +49 (0) 123456789. Because Telephone just ignores parenthesis, it incorrectly calls the number +490123456789, but the zero should be ignored and the +49123456789 number must be called instead.
Hello,
during call, if I transfer the call to other number I hear calling in my ears and recipient answer to me not to transferring call.

Thank you
My SIP provider needs ue to send a SIP INFO event to emulate hook flash before sending call transfer invite.

that SIP INFO must contains a header with "c: application/hook-flash"
and SDP with "Signal=hf"

Is it possible to implement as an option of Telephone.app?
