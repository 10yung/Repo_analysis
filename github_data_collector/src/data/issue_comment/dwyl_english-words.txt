Fixed #71 and ran sort script.
Inital is in `words_alpha.txt`, which is incorrectly spelled. words_alpha.txt:inital

https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=inital&go=Go&ns0=1

This should be fixed.
The example for words_dictionary.json is read_english_dictionary.py, but that file uses words_alpha.txt
Could you create separate files for the types of words listed above?
Clearly, "words_alpha.txt" is missing a lot of words from "words.txt" that only have letters, no numbers or symbols. 
Why is that? 
How was "words_alpha.txt" generated? 
All words from original words.txt that begin with a lowercase alphabet.
Hi i just wanted to know if you can make a clean version of the file removing curses and such
There are words like "isn" "aren" "wouldn" - smells like a bug?
I see that in the file words_alpha there are the (wrong) words:
isnt
arent
wouldnt

and that these (right) words are not included:
isn't
aren't
wouldn't

Is this intentional?
