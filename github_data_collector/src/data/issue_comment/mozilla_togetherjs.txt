When I build a static copy of the client and include the files on my website, there appear to be conflicts with other libraries on my website (e.g., after I click the togetherjs button to start a session, I encounter the error "uncaught typeerror $(...).selectric is not a function" when I try to make selections in my selectric dropdowns but works fine until _after_ I start the togetherjs session).

I don't encounter any conflicts/errors like that when I reference https://togetherjs.com/togetherjs-min.js instead of the local, static copy. Does anyone know the cause of this?

onSubmit is clientsided as does not pass through as a realtime event.
I have an animated CSS event that occurs on an onSubmit event, however the only one who sees it is the person who clicks the button.

CSS animations do however work with the onChange event.
When single user is open canvas and draw some data.After this he refreshed it then data is not getting as simpler to multiple users present in it.
fixes #1160 
readme typo fixes. nothing major.

minor typo fixes. PR raise later.
HI All,

In these commits I have made few changes which are actually required for handling :

- Randomly changing element id in DOM tree for dynamic elements. The ID field is quintessential for executing actions on remote side.

- Apart from session storage I have also added coockie and cache synchronization to allow people to take advantage of logged -in user cobrowsing.

- Also added support for changing visibility of any element like show or hide.

- Fixed few bugs like in case of hash change detection currentUrl wasn't properly getting updated and during documentClick removed setTimeout to make it synchronous.
Fixes #1157

Fixed a handful of references in the site:

1. https://mozorg.cdn.mozilla.net/tabzilla/tabzilla.js is returning an XML access denied response. I found the original file in wayback machine (Jan 2017) and moved it to local.
2. https://mozillalabs.com/ links are returning an SSL cert error (configured for *.github.com?). Secondarily, /en-US/ is returning a 404. I've altered the links to include "www" and removed "en-US" so that they still resolve.
3. The link to the IRC logs is dead. Could not find a replacement, and so I removed the link and contextual sentence.
4. The drawing jsfiddle is 404, I replaced the link with one from the wayback machine.
