My situation:
I've created a custom eCommerce app.

shop.localhost uses the system db and is the admin panel to create shops
shop1.localhost uses tenant db #1 
shop2.localhost uses tenant db #2

Feature request:
I'd like to be able to clone a shop including the current data.

Ideas:
A sloppy way I can think of is creating a dump of the current database, change the database name and reimport it using DB::unprepared(file_get_contents("backups/test.sql"));

I'd like to hear suggestions that point me in a better way, possibly using functions from this package.




When I run `php artisan tenancy:migrate`, the first website migrated successfully, but the next one throws an exception :

```
ayoub:stock ayoubbougsid$ php artisan tenancy:migrate 
Migrating: 2020_01_12_110036_add_variant_to_sell
Migrated:  2020_01_12_110036_add_variant_to_sell
Migrating: 2020_01_12_110036_add_variant_to_sell

In Connection.php line 452:
                                               
  Call to a member function prepare() on null  
```

I tried to debug the internal code, but without success, couldn't figure out why this happening.
__Description__


Hello,
I have a problem when creating a website indeed I get this error.


The command "apache2ctl -t" failed. Exit Code: 1(General error) Working directory: /var/www/html/blog/public Output: ================ Action '-t' failed. The Apache error log may have more information. Error Output: ================ AH00526: Syntax error on line 18 of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-le-ssl.conf: SSLCertificateFile: file '/etc/letsencrypt/live/app.atomsit.site/fullchain.pem' does not exist or is empty


I don't understand because default-le-ssl.conf is my application.
In addition when I type apache2ctl -t directly on my server I get "Syntax OK"

__Error log__

__Description__

Hi! Im getting this error after installing and adding tenants:
Database [tenant] not configured.

Tried it both ways: generating tenants automatically and adding a new tenant by hand. 
I created a system DB with two tables: 
hostnames
websites

I have already an active CRM running and trying to add this module afterwards. 

I have two tenants in the websites table. How does this module determine to check for the  database "tenant"? I think it should search for a database with my unique uuid name? bdb6d07caa5847b18b5ac8d34d720905 The one that is created by the system user.. 

early-identification is running and does work. 

I think the only issue I have is that the right database is not getting selected.. 

---

__Actual behavior__
My website is showing. I can post a login but getting this error:
Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'tenancy.users' doesn't exist (SQL: select * from `users` where `email` = me@me.nl limit 1)

So its looking for a tenancy db that doesn't exists. The one that exists is bdb6d07caa5847b18b5ac8d34d720905...

__Expected behavior__

Showing login screen.

Hi.

__Description__

In an installation with Spatie Permissions package, getting this error in this scenery:

- No tenants configured
- Database default connection set to `system`
- System connection defined in config/database.php
- Tenant connection not defined in config/database.php
- Fallback hostname configured as mpevendas.test with force https true
- Role, Permission and User models setted up as documented in [Tenancy](https://tenancy.dev/docs/hyn/5.4/spatie-laravel-permission)
- Removing (for test) trait UsesTenantConnection from User model doesn't take any effect
- Error occurs when accessing main site

Appreciate any help. Thanks!

__Description of your feature__

If we use managed databases from DigitalOcean, they support only caching_sha2_password as auth plugin for mysql. We should add in config the option of what auth plugin tenancy should use.

---

__Proposed behavior__

Hyn\Tenancy\Generators\Webserver\Database\Drivers\MariaDB:42

```
return $connection->statement("CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS {$config['username']}@'{$config['host']}' IDENTIFIED WITH {$config['auth_method']} BY {$config['password']}'");
```

where auth_method should be mysql_native_password or caching_sha2_password

__Current behavior__

Hyn\Tenancy\Generators\Webserver\Database\Drivers\MariaDB:42

```
return $connection->statement("CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS {$config['username']}@'{$config['host']}' IDENTIFIED BY '{$config['password']}'");
```

Hi!

I have a weird issue when using this package with spatie/laravel-event-sourcing. When I am running tests with PHPUnit everything fails after the first test.

Illuminate\Contracts\Container\BindingResolutionException: Unresolvable dependency resolving [Parameter #0 [ <required> string $storedEventRepository ]] in class Spatie\EventSourcing\EventSubscriber
Looks like the singleton binding for the EventSubscriber isn't used/ran after the first test is run. The class doesn't receive the required $storedEventRepository parameter when created, which should contain the value in the config file (config('event-sourcing.stored_event_repository')).

If I hardcode a fallback inside the class the tests run, but this isn't a viable option obviously...

```php
namespace Spatie\EventSourcing;

final class EventSubscriber
{
    /** @var \Spatie\EventSourcing\StoredEventRepository */
    private $repository;

    public function __construct(string $storedEventRepository = '')
    {
        if ( ! $storedEventRepository ) {
            $storedEventRepository = config('event-sourcing.stored_event_repository');
        }
        $this->repository = app($storedEventRepository);
    }

    // Other methods
}
```
My test isn't related to any functionnality provided by either of the two packages.

I know this is most likely not an issue with this package in particular, nor with spatie/laravel-event-sourcing but maybe a functionality that is used by both packages and therefore creates a conflict?

Hoping you have an idea of where this could come from, because I'm shooting dd() in the dark right now 😅

Happy holidays!
```
        // Create New Website
        $website = new Website;
        app(WebsiteRepository::class)->create($website);

        // associate the website with a hostname
        $hostname = new Hostname;
        $hostname->fqdn = $fqdn;
        app(HostnameRepository::class)->attach($hostname, $website);

        // make hostname current
        app(Environment::class)->tenant($website);



        $process = new Process('sudo docker-compose run php php artisan passport:install');

        $process1 = new Process('sudo docker-compose run php php artisan db:seed');

        $process->run();
        $process1->run();



        $tenant = new Tenant($website, $hostname);
```

This artisan commands not working :(

How can I exec artisan comand on my aws, I don't install php on instance so 
```
        Artisan::call('passport:install');
        Artisan::call('db:seed');
```

Will be not working.
__Description__

This is __not an issue__. This is a workaround / tutorial I found to get tenants identified with 
```
php artisan tenancy:run schedule:run
```
What `schedule` run does, it basically loops through every scheduled commands, and creates a process for each one.

---

__Example__

* First lets create our ExampleCommand:
```shell
php artisan make:command ExampleCommand
```

* We are going to make this command Tenant Aware. Let's change the signature to accept a `website_id` option
```php
protected $signature = 'example:command {--website_id=}';
```

* We will take tenant awereness example from [Tenant Aware Tinker Command](https://tenancy.dev/docs/hyn/5.4/commands#tenant-aware-tinker-command). The `ExampleCommand` should look like this:

<details><summary>app/Console/Commands/ExampleCommand.php</summary>
<p>

```php
namespace App\Console\Commands;

use Illuminate\Console\Command;
use Hyn\Tenancy\Contracts\Repositories\WebsiteRepository;
use Hyn\Tenancy\Database\Connection;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\ModelNotFoundException;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Exception\RuntimeException;

class ExampleCommand extends Command
{
    /**
     * The name and signature of the console command.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $signature = 'example:command {--website_id=}';

    /**
     * The console command description.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $description = 'Example Command - Tenant Aware';

    /**
     * @var Connection
     */
    private $connection;

    /**
     * @var WebsiteRepository
     */
    private $websites;

    /**
     * Create a new command instance.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
        $this->websites = app(WebsiteRepository::class);
        $this->connection = app(Connection::class);
    }

    /**
     * Execute the console command.
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function handle()
    {
        $website_id = $this->option('website_id');
        try{
            $website = $this->websites->query()->where('id', $website_id)->firstOrFail();
            $this->connection->set($website);
            $this->info('Running Command on website_id: ' . $website_id);

            $this->commandHandle();
            
            $this->connection->purge();
        } catch (ModelNotFoundException $e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(sprintf('The tenancy website_id=%d does not exist.', $website_id));
        }
    }

    /**
     * Execute the console command.
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function commandHandle()
    {
        // You are now Tenant Aware
    }
}
```

</p>
</details>

* Then we need to register our schedule into `app/Console/Kernel.php`:
```php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule
    ->command(ExampleCommand::class)
    ->daily();
}
```

* Finally, we need to inject the `website_id` option to the command's options. We will use the `before` helper to modify the called command:
```php
$schedule
->command(ExampleCommand::class)
->daily()
->before(function (Schedule $schedule) {
    $tenant = app(\Hyn\Tenancy\Environment::class)->tenant();
    $event  = $schedule->events()[0];
    $event->command .= sprintf(" --website_id=%d", $tenant->id);
});
```

There we go! Feel free to try it and tell me if it works or you have issues with it.

### Warning: This has been tested with only one scheduled task. Behaviour with multiple tasks is unknown. Feel free to try it :)
__Description__

Setting up a tenant APP with fallback domain.

`My regular routes: `

```
Route::group([
    'middleware' => ['web'],
    'domain' => config('tenancy.hostname.default'),

], function () {
       Route::get('teste1', 'TestController@index');
       Route::get('teste2', 'TestController@index');

});
```

`My tenant routes:`

```
Route::group([
    'middleware' => ['web'],
], function () {
       Route::get('tenantTest', 'Tenants/TestController@index');
});
```

Relevant config: 

Eager and auto identification is on. Global override is false (it could be true as i am using global routes for specific domain).

__Actual behavior__

Getting 404 on tenant `tenantTest` route. I went to 404 page and: `dd(app(\Hyn\Tenancy\Environment::class)->tenant());`

__Returned my actual tenant!!!!!__ I was about to go crazy. Changed configs, re-installed the package etc etc etc. `php artisan route:clear` did the trick. All routes are working.

__Expected behavior__

My main domain routes are __HUGE__ really, and they probably should  be cached. But if I cache them I can no longer access tenant routes because they are inserted 'on-the-fly' and not if routesAreCached!

Maybe one way of dealing with this is checking if  `if ($this->app->routesAreCached()) {` if they are tenancy should de-serialize them, add tenant routes and re-serialize ? Don't even know if that is possible, just wondering.

Best,
Pedro
