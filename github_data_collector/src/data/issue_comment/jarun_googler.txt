With the latest version from master, I run `./googler -N --debug  test` and get this output:

The debug output is [in this gist](https://gist.github.com/kenficara/d3a3e649c648d5869ca9a4d182c647df).

OS is MacOS 10.14.6 (Darwin 18.7.0), Python version is as shown above, and locale i set as follows:

```
LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"

LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
```

This is a somewhat frequent complaint (#207, #218, and scattered on hijacked threads). 

There's a fairly obvious solution for this — a goddamn pager! (For some reason I haven't thought of this until now, maybe because of the XY problem — users were always suggesting a dynamic number of results, which is both unnecessarily hard to implement and a poor fit for our paging model, and I was caught up in why that's a bad idea instead of tackling the root cause.)

More concretely, we just need to pipe output into `less -EFX` (`-E` — `--QUIT-AT-EOF`; `-F` — `--quit-if-one-screen`; `-X` — `--no-init`). A tried and true paging technique.

There are two problems with `less -EFX` that are worth mentioning:

1. If user quits early, the rest of the output is lost. We can of course implement a "repeat" command (`r` is conveniently still available) to repeat the current page's results, which largely mitigates the problem. This does mean we can't make paging the default, though. It has to be behind an option (`-P`, `--pager` should be good enough), and discoverability would suffer.

   Discoverability is a really hairy problem for a program that pledges to leave no trace on user's disk. I guess we could suggest the option *once* in each interactive session where the output is ~longer~ way longer than a screenful. That shouldn't be too annoying for people who don't want it, right?

2. `less` is universal enough, with one catch: BusyBox's `less` doesn't have `-F` or `-X` [1] (I'm not even sure if it supports ANSI escapes, haven't tried). A simple preflight with `--help` should shake that out though. I'm not aware of any other `less` implementation except the most common one found in both Linux and BSD.

@jarun Let me know your thoughts.
