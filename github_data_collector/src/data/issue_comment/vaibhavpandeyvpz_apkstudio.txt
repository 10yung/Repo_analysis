When there are 2 emulators or 2 devices are connected at, that time, it shows error.



Suggestion:
Please add the Run button, and by pressing on that, it will Build, Sign app, and install.
it will perform 3 actions in a single time.

Please add the ability to add extra options for compiling and decompiling..
example, --force-all --keep-originall --aapt2  and so on.

On Mac OS.
I closed all windows and there is no left bar to get them back.
I tried uninstalling and removing plist files, and reinstalling but it did not revert.

Is there another way to restore the windows?

Possibly a screenshot is here...

The first time I have opened Apk Studio, It has shown config window. I have set path parameters and used It, this was the first and last time It worked, because It continuously crash at the start, no error message no splash screen, just an immediate crash after the launch of ApkStudio.exe.

On windows log I see that program fails to open due to Qt5Core.dll error 0xc0000005

ApkStudio 5.2.0 x64 
OS: Windows 10 x64
I made a change to the file, and clicked the build button.

Result: The build is going unchanged.
Expected result: The build is going with the changes (as in version 4.0.3)
