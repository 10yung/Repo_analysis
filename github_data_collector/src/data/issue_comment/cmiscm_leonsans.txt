It says webGL for the pixi impl but haven't figured out how to bring it to three, is that even possible?
I love this font. But this font does not have enough characters.
Please add character:

- ả, ã, ạ
- â, ấ, ầ, ậ
- ắ, ằ, ặ, ẳ, ẵ
- ọ, ỏ
- ố, ồ, ộ
- ơ, ớ, ờ, ợ
- ụ, ủ, ũ
- ứ, ừ, ự
- ẹ, ẽ, ẻ
- ề, ế, ể, ễ, ệ
- ỉ, ĩ, ị
- ỳ, ỷ, ỹ, ỵ

Thank you !
Slightly more content and also the description now always ends with a full stop.

Please review.

Love this project

But I'm having a hard time getting the same responsiveness as on leon-kim.com

Could you share the code for that here?
Amazing work here! Sorry to ask this as it's not an issue with the project but my own question for working with Leon Sans.

How can I create an animated weight change as shown in the README so that each letter becomes thicker after the previous one?

I just can't figure it out and I don't know where else to ask. Thanks!
Hello,
is it possible to bind it to the viewport for a responsive size of the canvas/font?

If he character "Ø" and "ø" are added, you would have the complete alphabet for the danish language :-)

Very cool project. Can you please add the missing Lithuanian diacritics. All of them are these:

Ą Č Ę Ė Į Š Ų Ū Ž ą č ę ė į š ų ū ž


Is there any implementation to reverse the animation as though the text is being deleted one character at a time?
