I'm trying to install MarqueeLabel using CocoaPods on macOS. I have other dependencies, and I've updated my podfile to include `pod "MarqueeLabel"`
I've also tried: `pod 'MarqueeLabel'
`

### Expected Behavior
<!-- Your expected response from MarqueeLabel -->
Scrolling to stop after a defined number of iterations
### Actual Behavior
<!-- What actually happens -->
Scrolling won't stop


Here is my custom class:
```swift
class CustomMarqueeLabel: MarqueeLabel {
    var maxNumOfScrolls: Int?

    var currentNumOfScrolls = 0

    override func labelReturnedToHome(_ finished: Bool) {
        super.labelReturnedToHome(finished)
        currentNumOfScrolls += 1

        if let maxScrolls = self.maxNumOfScrolls, currentNumOfScrolls >= maxScrolls {
            self.shutdownLabel()
        }
    }
}
```

Setup:
```swift
    let titleLabel: CustomMarqueeLabel = {
        let lbl = CustomMarqueeLabel()
        lbl.type = .continuous
        lbl.textColor = .white
        lbl.font = .systemFontRegular(points: 16)
        lbl.trailingBuffer = UIScreen.main.bounds.width
        lbl.animationDelay = 2
        lbl.textAlignment = .center
        lbl.fadeLength = 10
        lbl.maxNumOfScrolls = 3
        return lbl
    }()
```

This CustomMarqueeLabel is currently contained inside a UITableViewCell.  Calls to shutdownLabel() seem to have no effect at all.

Have I missed something?

I have kludged a way to do this but it would be nice if there were an elegant way to do this :)

### Steps to Reproduce the Problem
<!-- If specific steps would help to describe the problem, please include them! -->
1. Clone the latest MarqueeLabel from Zip
2. Import MarqueeLabel.swift manually into project
3. Import QuartzCore.framework in build.phase link binary
4. Used MarqueeLabel where is needed
3. Clean project
4. Run project on simulator - iOS 11.3; iPhone 8 Plus
5 error on line 1153 - Could not cast value of type 'CAShapeLayer' (0x111186cc0) to 'CAGradientLayer' (0x111187260) from MarqueeLabel.swift

Is there something that I have missed or have done wrong??

Any help is much appreciated :)
Is it possible to keep the current scrolling position or state after layout changes?

For example: scrolling is about 50%, the frame changes from (100pt x 20pt) to (101pt x 20pt). At the moment the animation restarts from the beginning. Maybe a property "keepScrollingPossition: Bool"
Hi guys, i'm using this little variation in my application to force a label to scroll even if the text fits inside, to create a "banner" effect. I don't know if it's in the interest of the project, merge it if you see fit.

When using continuous-type, linear animation curve label settings, a zero-length delay causes an animation jump at the end of each scrolling loop. See issue [#22 at the MarqueeLabel-Swift repo](https://github.com/cbpowell/MarqueeLabel-Swift/issues/22).

[Relocated from the MarqueeLabel-Swift repo]

Thanks a ton for this lib! I've implemented it in a project I'm working on and it works great.

What, in my opinion, would make it even more user friendly is if he/she would be able to manually scroll the text left/right within the label by dragging the text.

What do you think?
