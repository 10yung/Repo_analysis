basically all the dependency gems are way ahead of the time, so you pretty much can't install it in new applications. also rails5 seems not to be supported.

I'm trying to run Social Stream with Rails 4.0.9 using this repository https://github.com/beder/social_stream, but I'm getting this error when I try to see the index page, any guide on how to resolve will be appreciate it!

No route matches {:action=>"passthru", :controller=>"omniauth_callbacks", :format=>nil, :provider=>:facebook} missing required keys: [:provider]

in [Profile.rb](https://github.com/ging/social_stream/blob/master/base/app/models/profile.rb#L94)  the following construction is present

``` ruby
birthday.present? && !birthday.blank?
```

but Rails defines `present?` as 

``` ruby
def present?
  !blank?
end
```

so why to call it twice?

Actually I'm using rails 4.2.1 version. I want to install social_stream. How can I make it possible? Please help me I shall be very thankful to you.

I'm getting this error when I try to install the social_stream-base

In Gemfile:
    social_stream-base (>= 0) x86-mingw32 depends on
      devise (~> 1.2.rc) x86-mingw32

```
devise (3.4.1)
```

Hello,

Version 1.X.X of social stream provides a button in contacts to invitate friends with e-mail.

In version 2.x.x this button is not present anymore...

Could you help me to add it? (how, where, ....)

TIA

When there were thousands of users for suggestion, this method seems like cost 2-3 second. Then I google how to get random records by sql in rails, here is the result I got: 

``` ruby
  Model.first(:order => "RANDOM()") # postgres example
```

In this way, the solution could be

``` ruby
 candidates = candidates.order("RANDOM()").limit(size)
```

This will more faster then the original code.

But different database get different rand function. See detail in this url:
http://www.petefreitag.com/item/466.cfm
I don't know how many kinds of database SocialStream need to support. With a support list, it might could optimize it with a method to get current random func for current database.

Anyway, for somebody who got this problem, could just use the decorator to rewrite this method.

hi there
after configured the paperclip in procudtion.rb file and upload it with heroku, i succeeded upload the files to amazon, but....
the website still shows the image URL of the root directory so all images/attachments are not viewable/downloadable

what do u think?

BTW, 
documention to configure the paperclip is incorrect.
I have followed this link:
https://github.com/ging/social_stream/wiki/How-to-deploy-social-stream-to-heroku
and set like it said:

  config.paperclip_defaults = {
    :s3_credentials => {
      :s3_host_name => 's3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com'
    } 
  }
and it still upload files to heroku instead of amazon.

googling a bit showed me this to be done (I advice to update if this is correct by you)
# In console for new projects don't forget to set the correct S3 data
# $ heroku config:set S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
# $ heroku config:set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
# $ heroku config:set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key

  config.paperclip_defaults = {
    :storage => :s3,
    :s3_credentials => {
      :bucket => ENV['S3_BUCKET_NAME'],
      :access_key_id => ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],
      :secret_access_key => ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    }
  }
