I'm exporting PDF's in my Rails 6 application in a Cronjob with the crono gem. This for itself works fine, my styles are applied to the table etc:

```
def perform
        view = ActionController::Base.new
        view.extend(ApplicationHelper)
        view.extend(Rails.application.routes.url_helpers)
        # include helpers and routes
        view.instance_variable_set("@clinic_image", Configuration.first.image)
        view.instance_variable_set("@meal_triplet_week_vollkost", Meal.this_week_vollkost)
        view.instance_variable_set("@meal_triplet_week_schonkost", Meal.this_week_schonkost)
        view.instance_variable_set("@meal_triplet_week_vegetarisch", Meal.this_week_vegetarisch)
        view.instance_variable_set("@clinic_name", Configuration.first.clinicName)

        pdf = WickedPdf.new.pdf_from_string(
            view.render_to_string('meals/exportMealsCurrentWeek.html.erb', layout: 'pdf_week.html.erb'))

        save_path = Rails.root.join('pdfs','filename.pdf')
        File.open(save_path, 'wb') do |file|
            file << pdf
        end
    end
```

My problem is the following:

When I call the action to render the PDF from the controller, the ActiveStorage Image from my database gets displayed without problems:

`<%= image_tag(@clinic_image, size: "400x64", alt: "BDH Klinik Braunfels") %>
`The @clinic_image is defined from my database in the default content for the application:

```
if Configuration.first.image.attached?
   @clinic_image = Configuration.first.image 
end
```
But in my PDF which is generated in the cronjob, I get the two following errors:

If I keep the image_tag in the view I get:

> **Can't resolve image into URL: undefined method `polymorphic_url' for #<#:0x000000000 Titel anhand dieser ISBN in Citavi-Projekt Ã¼bernehmenc119c28>**

If I try to use the wicked_pdf_image_tag instead of normal image_tag helper I get the following error:

> **no implicit conversion of ActiveStorage::Attached::One into String**


So I either need the proper URL (where I first have to download the image I think) or I need the ActiveStorage Image as a string.

I tried some "solutions" or better workarounds from the GitHub repo, but it doesn't seem to work for me (maybe I did something wrong, not sure).

If I use the normal path to the image in my assets folder it*s working, but I always need the image which is set in the configuration.

Is there any solution to this problem?

Re: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59206847/wickedpdf-and-wkhtmltopdf-hangs-in-rails-depending-on-text

## Issue description

When generating a PDF sometimes, it hangs and never completes, forcing me to have to shut down the rails server and restart it. I have been unable to figure out a pattern in the HTML file that is causing this to happen because I can run the same command and arguments that Rails run and it works just fine. So I'm not sure if this is an issue within Rails or wkhtmltopdf.

Here's an example of it hanging in the rails console and me having to use ctrl C to shut down the rails server.

As mentioned in my stackoverflow post, if I comment out the `exe_path` within my `config/initializers/wicked_pdf` then it works just fine. However, I am using a custom `exe_path` to leverage `xvfb-run` so that I can render charts in my application.

Here's what my `exe_path` looks like: `exe_path: Rails.root.join("bin","wicked_pdf").to_s`

and here's what `bin/wicked_pdf` looks like: 

```
#!/bin/bash
xvfb-run -- /usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf "$@"
```

I am also using this in Rails development, so I'm not sure if the same thing happens in production or not. Either way, I can't make it to production (production doesn't matter) if I can't create what I'm trying to do in development mode.

## Expected or desired behavior

Generate the PDF document and render it to the user's browser.

## Issue description
I'm trying to implement a PDF version of my forms which are created via the plugin **jQuery formBuilder v2.1.2**.

However, **wicked_pdf** does not recognize the formBuilder function: `$('#fillable-form').formRender(formRenderOpts);`

It returns the error `TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function` (I used [this](https://github.com/mileszs/wicked_pdf/issues/725#issuecomment-492521451) code snippet to debug javascript via console logs).

Please see my [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59047968/wicked-pdf-gem-does-not-execute-formbuilder-rendering-function) question for more details.

## Expected or desired behavior
The form should be rendered out upon generating the PDF but it does not recognize the `.formRender()` function of formBuilder.

I tried [debugging](https://github.com/mileszs/wicked_pdf#debugging) and .formRender() works well in plain HTML format.
