After updating ckb-next no longer works with my Corsair Strafe RGB after it was working fine on Mojave.
The software claims I should enable the ckb-daemon in Security > Privacy > Input Monitoring but I never get the prompt and nothing is there (with no way to add software to it)

Things I've tried:
- Restarting ckb-next multiple times
- Restarting the Mac
- Unplugging/replugging the keyboard multiple times
- Running the ckb-next-daemon restart shell script in Package Contents

Neither seem to do the trick, it's a shame because I love this software and this was essential to getting my media keys working on the strafe.

Version: macOS Catalina 10.15.3 Beta (19D62e)

Hardware:

* Corsair K70 LUX Red LED
* Corsair CH-9304011-AP, SCIMITAR Pro RGB

When ckb-next is running my keyboard is stuck at full brightness, and when I try to change the brightness setting, either by pressing the brightness button on the keyboard or by changing it in ckb-next, the mouse brightness changes instead, and the keyboard is unaffected.

Changing the brightness setting for the keyboard affects the brightness setting for the mouse, the values seem to  be locked together.

When I quit from ckb-next the brightness button on the keyboard works as intended.

I believe that what I am encountering is a bug within ckb-next, but as this is my first time writing an issue report in Github,  I could very well be wrong. 

I recently installed Debian 10 XFCE on my computer and added my usual applications and customizations. Since there is no official package for Debian, I compiled ckb-next from source via the instructions. I've done this before, never had any problems. Everything seems to work fine--I can change button macros, mouse speed, RGB theme, etc. However, when my computer is idle, and xscreensaver starts, the lights on both my keyboard and mouse turn off. The only light that stays on is the little brightness icon on my keyboard. When I move my mouse to get rid of the screensaver, either the mouse or the keyboard will light back up, but never both. The only way I've managed to turn the lights back on is to either unplug and plug either the mouse or keyboard back in, or go into ckb-next's settings and switch to a different RGB theme and back again to the one I had set. While this is not a dealbreaker for me, it is a minor aggravation, so I thought I'd bring it to your attention.

Also, I've experienced this in the past, but for whatever reason, if ckb-next is set to autostart in XFCE, when I log into my user account, the main setting screen always appears, even though it is launching with the --background command. I've tried to delay the start (an option in the settings), and I've also tried autostarting a shell script instead of the default auto-launcher with both --background and --session tried--neither seem to make any difference. I don't know if I should make a different issue report for this or not. 

My keyboard is the K68, and my mouse is the Scimitar Pro RGB. I'm not sure what other information would be helpful, but I would be happy to provide it. As I said earlier, running Debian 10 stable with no packages from testing or backlogs. 
Hello again,

I was recently looking into basically this blog the other day.

https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/systemd-service-hardening.html

I was running systemd-analyse security and was met with a huge list of exposed.

These are basically a set of permissions to sandbox the systemd unit a basic amount.

To test this, I ran 

sudo systemctl edit ckb-next-daemon.service

[Service]
<capability restrictions>

sudo systemctl restart ckb-next-daemon.service

I then just checked the general functionality and things all seem to work just fine. This can go a lot further but for now it's gone from somewhere of 9.5 exposed to 6.9 MEDIUM.

What do you think?

K95 RGB. Using Linux Mint 19.3.

Under Performance, assigning colours to some keys is broken. See attachment.

1. Doesn't work.
2. Doesn't work.
3. Doesn't affect anything.
4. Affect both Mute Off and Macro Recording Off (see photo - sorry for bad quality, but you can see both mute and MR buttons are cyan).

Using the app, I'm not able to assign a color to the Vol Up/Vol Down buttons. It appears that when I do, they values are assigned to the Play and next buttons immediately below them. 

The Vol buttons do light up as expected on the built in schemes.

Using v0.4.2 on MacOS 10.14
K68 RGB with FW 3.24.
- [X] Headset recognized by daemon
- [X] Headset recognized by GUI
- [ ] RGB Control <- Getting errors when sending the message so working on that (uncomment the usbsend and it'll stall)

Fixes #81 

If you wanna test if the daemon picks up your headset, please do and let me know if I need to add more usbid's for respective headset

@tatokis since you did the RGB part. My IRL schedule is pretty free all Thursday (CST) and most of Tuesday afternoon if I need to get on IRC to help with testing.

## What is the program's current behavior?
Currently the program requires a Kernel extension to be loaded to function properly. This requires the user to manually go into System preferences and allow the Kext to load. 

## What would you like it to do instead?
Apple has said that Kernel extensions will be deprecated in a future macOS release. The new way to make IO Drivers is using [DriverKit](https://developer.apple.com/system-extensions/). This allows the driver to run in user space, so the user will not have to manually allow the kernel extension. This will improve usability, as well as system stability. 

## Any other notes & comments?

I saw ckb-next support Corsair LL120 fans!
Would it be possible to support QL120 fans as well?

QL is the newest LED fans from Corsair and they use Lighting Node **Core** for LED control. (LL fans use Lighting Node **Pro**. I just want them to stay on a spefic color. 

I'm not a programmer, but I'll help you whatever I can.

Thanks


## Any other notes & comments?
The ckb-next is available in Solus, as `ckb`, as well as a devellopement version as `ckb-devel` (Same version for both currently, as far iÂ´m aware)
https://dev.getsol.us/D7355
Despite that, It is not mentionned in the wiki : https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next/wiki/Linux-Installation
