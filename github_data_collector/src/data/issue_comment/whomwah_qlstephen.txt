I installed qlstephen with `brew cask` but it doesn't work on YAML files.

Here is a non working file:

[pouet.yml.zip](https://github.com/whomwah/qlstephen/files/3997869/pouet.yml.zip)

look at this example:

I get a lot of plain text files with various extensions such as `.1` or `.inc` and currently they only show the icon in QuickLook.  Looking at one such file with `mdls` I see it has a dynamic type.  But the content type tree includes public.data.  Would it be possible to extend support to ALL filetypes?

```
$ mdls wget-log.2 
...
kMDItemContentType                 = "dyn.ah62d4rv4ge8xe"
kMDItemContentTypeTree             = (
    "dyn.ah62d4rv4ge8xe",
    "public.data",
    "public.item"
)
...

$ mdls function.inc 
...
kMDItemContentType                 = "dyn.ah62d4rv4ge80w5xd"
kMDItemContentTypeTree             = (
    "dyn.ah62d4rv4ge80w5xd",
    "public.item",
    "dyn.ah62d4rv4ge80w5xd",
    "public.data"
)
...
```
I've been using this great plugin for a long time, thanks so much!

I just upgraded to OS X Catalina and I am having the following issue. I was not having this issue 2 days ago, before I upgraded the OS.

I have many text files that I have generated and I have given some file extension (say for example .gt but the problem occurs for a number of different extensions). Prior to the OS upgrade, I could QL those files just fine. But now all I see when I activate QL is a generic file icon rather than a preview.

If I take one of those files and remove the extension (or change it to .txt), QL generates a preview no problem.

I've tried reinstalling QLStephen two ways. (1) using homebrew, and (2) by downloading the latest version and copying the QLStephen.qlgenerator directory to /Library/QuickLook/. Then I run 'qlmange -r' but no luck. In my ~/Library/ directory, there is no QuickLook folder/ and I ran a find command in the terminal to see if OS X Catalina is hiding a Quicklook directory somewhere else, but I did not see one.

If I run
`'mdls -name lKMItemContentType <file name.gt>`
The output is
`lKMItemContentType = (null)`

Same thing if the file extension is removed, or changed to .txt

If I run
`qlmanage -m | grep public`

The result is:

> public.data -> /Library/QuickLook/QLStephen.qlgenerator (1.4.4 - loaded)
  public.movie -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Movie.qlgenerator (903.2)
  public.x509-printable-encoded-archive -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Security.qlgenerator (55139.0.1)
  public.xml -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Text.qlgenerator (903.2)
  public.font -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Font.qlgenerator (903.2)
  public.x509-certificate -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Security.qlgenerator (55139.0.1)
  public.vcard -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Contact.qlgenerator (903.2)
  public.html -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Web.qlgenerator (903.2)
  public.plain-text -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Text.qlgenerator (903.2)
  public.audio -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Audio.qlgenerator (903.2)
  public.xhtml -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Web.qlgenerator (903.2)
  public.json -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Text.qlgenerator (903.2)
  public.svg-image -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Web.qlgenerator (903.2)
  public.image -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Image.qlgenerator (903.2)
  public.rtf -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Text.qlgenerator (903.2)
  public.comma-separated-values-text -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Office.qlgenerator (40)`

If I force qlmanage to use the QLStephen.qlgenerator:

`qlmanage -g /Library/QuickLook/QLStephen.qlgenerator -c public.plain-text -p <file name>`

I see a preview. It also works if i run the command above with -c public.data.

Any ideas?
Hello!

I've updated the project files to generate a 64-bit build that's handy for macOS up to and including Mojave and essential for Catalina. The project files have also been updated to build under recent versions of Xcode.

That said, Catalina will require a Developer ID-signed build, or it'll reject the plug-in.

I was hitting an issue with the penultimate phase of the build, so I've tweaked the file copy target path slightly. I'm note sure why this was necessary: Xcode was escaping the tilde, causing the copy to break.

Cheers,

Tony
I'm not very familiar with Objective-C, but I'd be happy to submit a PR with some direction on what to do.
On the Public betas of Mac OS X QLStephen.qlgenerator stopped working. I've attached a screenshot with the message I'm receiving:

<img width="420" alt="Screenshot 2019-07-09 at 08 58 07" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1749648/60864349-02c16400-a22c-11e9-8775-9940b74e541a.png">

I haven't found a workaround.

Thank you.

I've used qlstephen before on another Mac, and I know there's a theme option.

I can't seem to find anything about it on the entire internet.

Is there any secret documentation I'm missing?

Thank you.
