Hi Guangchuang, 
When i run the followed code, i can not obtain the clade subtree. Do you know the reason? Thanks for your help!

library(ggtree)
library(tidytree)
nwk <- system.file("extdata", "sample.nwk", package="treeio")
tree <- read.tree(nwk)
p <- ggtree(tree) + geom_tiplab()
viewClade(p, MRCA(p, tip=c("I", "L")))

The error information is as followed:
Error in UseMethod("MRCA") : 
  no applicable method for 'MRCA' applied to an object of class "c('ggtree', 'gg', 'ggplot')"
In addition: Warning messages:
1: In get_clade_position_(treeview$data, node) :
  restarting interrupted promise evaluation
2: In get_clade_position_(treeview$data, node) :

3: In get_clade_position_(treeview$data, node) :

**Hello, Respect Dr.Yu**
I'm appreciated your masterpiece of ggtree while there is a problems perplex me，and i sincerely looking forward to your reply.   
#**Question**:
 Alouthgh i got my result with my codes, i recived a Warning message when i used gheatmap of ggtree. 
Warning message: attributes are not identical across measure variables; they will be dropped.
I had verified the name of tree file and the name of data for gheatmap.  The row names of attributes and variables of tree file don's make any different. 
the code is below:
#**CODES**
`tre<-read.newick("GENE2.nwk",node.label = "support")`
`data<-read.csv("GENETYPE.CSV",sep = ",",row.names = 1,
                 header = T)`

`pp <- ggtree(tre) + 
  geom_tiplab(size=3,align = T)+
  geom_nodepoint(aes(color=support))+
  scale_color_gradient("ML Tree Bootstrap Value",high='Pink', low='orange')+
  theme(legend.position='left')+
  geom_treescale(fontsize=3, linesize=1, offset = 0.1)
gheatmap(pp,data,offset = 0.3,color = "BLACK")`
#**Addition**:
There is my screen shot of  my data(gene type.csv) and tree. And I apologize for Mosaic because personal reasons.

How can i fix it? Thanks for your time.

Dear Guangchuang

I am a huge fan of ggtree, thanks for developing this amazing tool! I just tried to annotate my tree with some additional metadata according to https://aschuerch.github.io/posts/2017-04-24-blog-post-1. In principle it is working, but R throws an error at me for the length of the aestetics (_Error: Aesthetics must be either length 1 or the same as the data (10608): colour)_). I don't understand why this is happening. I have a newick file and a metadata file and the metadata file only contains 2 columns:

> tail(meta)
                                  name                            category
9561  SV61                                                     non-database
9562 CP010063.1 Enterococcus cecorum   database
9563 CP010062.1 Enterococcus cecorum   database
9564 CP010059.1 Enterococcus cecorum   database
9565 CP010061.1 Enterococcus cecorum   database
9566 SV661                                                   non-database

Now since I derived the metadata from the alignemnt file that was used to create the newick tree, the number of sequences must be the same. Yet, the newick file data seems to be longer as the meta-data. Why is that and is there a work around? How else can I annotate the two different categories? I need to have each individual leaf annotated. 

Thank you so much for your help!
Best wishes,
Tse


P.S.: Also, depending on what parameters I change I get the following error message: _Error: Must request at least one colour from a hue palette._ But If the length was the same I could solve this easily. And if you have the chance to reply today I would appreciate that very much - I'm a bit in a hurry... :-)
``geom_treescale`` interacts oddly with the fan layout:

*  If you give x and y they are actually interpreted as r and theta (polar coordinates)
* The units for y are are not degrees, radians or anything else standard, but based on the number of tips in the tree (i.e. 1 point of y is 360/n degrees where the tree has n tips)
* The scale line rotates as y changes. The above two points are manageable, but this means tinkering with a vector graphics package is basically essential if you want to place the scale

MWE:

```

library(ape)
library(ggtree)

a.tree <- rtree(100)

# small and large x values scale the tree
ggtree(a.tree, layout='fan') + geom_treescale(x = -50)
ggtree(a.tree, layout='fan') + geom_treescale(x = 50)
# y values rotate the line
ggtree(a.tree, layout='fan') + geom_treescale(x = 7, y = 15)

```


Hello!

Codeml does not produce separate mlc files anymore, the data are merged with the general output file defined in codeml.ctl. I was wondering if I could see an actual mlc output file so I could make my own that I can then use with ggtree? I need to plot the dN/dS values along branches and read.codeml does not seem to work with my rst file or general output files.
Thanks!

Hi @brj1, I wanted to use your density trees plot (as requested in #134), that has not made it yet into `ggtree`. Sadly, already the installation of it fails: 

```{r}
# Sure, we've installed tidytree
library(tidytree)

# Install @brj1's for of ggtree
devtools::install_github("brj1/ggtree")
```

This results in an error:

```

Apparently, the `tidytree` has its interface changed. I hope you, @brj1, can fix it :+1:.

Sorry Guangchuang for using your repo for this Issue. It is just that forks do not have their own Issues...

Hi @GuangchuangYu, thanks for `ggtree`! There is some behavior that I think may be incorrect. I hope you can fix that, or my misunderstanding :+1:. Cheers, @richelbilderbeek  

Here is the reprex:

```{r}
library(ape)
library(ggplot2)

# Here I create two trees. In one tree, taxon 'C' is the outlier. In the other tree, taxon 'B' is the outlier
tree_1 <- ape::read.tree(text = "((A:2,B:2):1, C:3);")
tree_2 <- ape::read.tree(text = "((A:1,C:1):2, B:3);")

# Show it in a picture:
plot(tree_1)
plot(tree_2)
```

![tree_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2098230/51738822-57af5a80-2090-11e9-9ca0-35c5d770c4f1.png)

![tree_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2098230/51738823-57af5a80-2090-11e9-9a75-24b1495cbd09.png)


```
# Combine the trees
trees <- c(tree_1, tree_2)

# Show them overlapping
ggtree::ggtree(trees) + ggtree::geom_tiplab()
```

The tree created by `ggtree` shows that C is the outlier in both cases:

This is a plot I would have expected, in which B and C are outliers each once:

Hello,

First of all, thanks for making this super awesome package! Not sure how I haven't discovered it before now, but I love it. Thanks!

I was wondering if it would be possible to add a feature in the msaplot function to color the residues by similarity? Even just a white to black gradient showing which residues are more conserved within the alignment would be really helpful to have. Not sure how complicated it would be to implement, but it would be very helpful! Thanks again!

Regards,
Ben
Hi there,

I would find very useful if it would be possible to add values to gheatmap cells.
The gheatmap function allows to easily display a matrix of cells colored from values taken in a dataframe. However, I can't find a way to display the values from which the colors are drawn. As an example, the regular heatmap.2 function include the "cellnote =" argument which read a list of strings that will be displayed within each color cell.

Looking forward to hear back from this suggestion. Let me know if this require more details.

All the best, and thanks for the great work you guys are doing.

Adrien
