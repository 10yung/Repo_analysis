Tested with Boost versions 1.59 and 1.71.
Work in progress:

- [x] Move from vector of vectors to boost::multi_array
- [x] Unify interface, clean clean up magic numbers
- [x] Precalculate offsets for better performance
- [ ] Backward save compatibility
- [ ] Unit tests for regular and edge cases
Any playtested feedback would be appreciated.

Changes so far:
- the AI will now consider attacking multiple units
- the preferred strategy now is to avoid collateral damage, if possible, rather than maximizing enemy damage only
- the AI will now consider blocking enemy shooters
- some generic cleanup and refactoring

The code is full of temporary hacks and logs and whatnot, please do not review it just as far as coding style goes just yet.
Helps in selecting skills for AI heroes
Merging this pull request starts 0.100 release cycle. There is already a release draft for 0.100~beta1, merge commit of this PR will be released. No new features and re-factorings will be accepted until 0.100 release.
So this is very dumb fix, but I need some confirmation from AI guys before I merge it to develop.

UPD: to clarify what exactly I trying to fix. Problem is that VCAI use VisitObj goal to visit hero and when hero become invisible after FoW change it's cause crash since apparently ```VCAI::heroMoved``` used ```validateObject``` for enemy heroes. Apparently ```validateObject``` doesn't remove ```lockedHeroes``` goals when ebemt hero is no longer visible.
Needs some testing to make sure AI logic has not changed. Conditions which could trigger for goal not being neither abstract nor "elementar" or being both at same time are probably most prone to potential  errors. Need to make sure new VCAI::decomposeGoal conditions will trigger under same  circumstances as old ones.

Branch is good to review now as next commits will rather contain cosmetic changes unless I remind myself something else with high priority that should be fixed.
Did not plan to make PR, but Travis did not put automated build for branch. Hopefully this time it will work.
Goal of this branch is to replace static enemy hero AI value with separate goal designed for visiting special objects and evaluating them using separate fuzzy engine.
