In the first few lines of _$youtube-video/youtube-video.js_ the initial URL value is hard-coded and the youtube video Id is appended to the string as follows:

_url: "**http**://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id=" + id_

Chrome policies seem to have blocked the use of this protocol for some types of requests. This can be overcome by just changing it to "https". This might be easily overcome with a try/catch of some sort, but I have not tested it.

Thank you for this project! It was very helpful for me!
I run the example script, and the script tries to load the http://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id=Q4-MnX5PfO8 url, but it gets blocked by the browser because of a Cross Origin Request problem?
This makes sense to me, but are you able to get rid of this limitation?

Been using the library perfectly for a while. Today the callback function is not being called. omgig.com is experimenting similar issue. Did something change youtube-side?
