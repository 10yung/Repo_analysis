Since there are so few comments, and the wiki is in terrible shape, is FIDO dead?
I am facing issue in compiling the code and begin installation , As I am getting couldnot found Aes_Crypto.cs error. I checked the github history and found it was deleted. Please let me know how I an compile the code 
I tried to run this. 
1) Windows : there is no installation file.
2) Linux : Even after changing the permissions using chmod +x <file>, it says permission denied for all .cs files.

Please help asap

Thanks and Regrads

Hello Developers,

I am a graduate student at SJSU and for our senior project my team and I were thinking of contributing to FIDO open source project. I had a question which I hope the developers do not mind addressing. I noticed in the wiki it mentioned that Bro/Snort were listed in the "in progress/planned" category. Before we begin our work, have you guys already began working on integrating these detectors? I would greatly appreciate a response back.

Thank You,
Prabhdeep Singh

Hi there, 

I'm a researcher studying software evolution. As part of my current research, I'm studying the implications of open-sourcing a proprietary software, for instance, if the project succeed in attracting newcomers. **Fido** was in my list. However, I observed that the software history of when the software was developed as a proprietary software was not kept after the transition to Github.

Knowing that software history is indispensable for developers (e.g., developers need to refer to history several times a day), I would like to ask **Fido** developers the following four brief questions:
1. Why did you decide to not keep the software history?
2. Do the _core developers_ faced any kind of problems, when trying to refer to the old history? If so, how did they solve these problems?
3. Do the _newcomers_ faced any kind of problems, when trying to refer to the old history? If so, how did they solve these problems?
4. How does the lack of history impacted on software evolution? Does it placed any burden in understanding and evolving the software?

Thanks in advance for your collaboration,

I'm not sure in what context the class is used, but the method of encryption in Fido/Fido_Support/Crypto/AES_Crypto.cs is insecure, as outlined by [this StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35137678/security-of-aes-encryption-with-constant-salt).

Also, there is no recognition of the original author of the class, which I believe is copied almost verbatim from [this StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/202011/encrypt-and-decrypt-a-string/2791259#279125). The original author should get recognition, even if it is a bugged implementation. Copying it directly and adding your own copyright notice on it is in direct violation of its license, Creative Commons, under which all StackOverflow content is licensed.

In "Fido/Director/Director_Helper/The_Director_HostDetection.cs" source the line "if ((sHostname == null) && (sHostname == String.Empty))" in "HostDetection" method is buggy, the case is impossible to succeed. 

Find one to review this project's codes. There are many bugs. 

Leave using email as the error logger and find a cleaver way. Also leave using "Console" as the main trace environment.

Recheck "Responsegroup" method. It has really buggy if statements
