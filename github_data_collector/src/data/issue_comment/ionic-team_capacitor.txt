Now you can run npx cap open android to launch Android Studio
```

I am able to successfully build and run the application however when I attempt to send a HTTP request using the cordova-plugin-advanced-http plugin, I get the following warning in the console

```
Native: tried calling HTTP.post, but the HTTP plugin is not installed.
Install the HTTP plugin: 'ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-advanced-http'
```

I have ensured that the plugin has been installed by running both the commands
```
ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-advanced-http
npm install @ionic-native/http
```
and removing the Android platform and rerunning the command `npx cap add android`
but I run into the same issue

## Expected Behavior
<!-- Describe what the behavior would be without the bug. -->
Migrating an ionic 4 project to capacitor and including the cordova-plugin-advanced-http plugin to be able to successfully make HTTP calls within the application

## Sample Code or Sample Application Repo

N/A

## Reproduction Steps

<!--  Please explain the steps required to duplicate the issue, especially if you are able to provide a sample application. -->

1.) Take an existing Ionic 4 project which makes use of the cordova-plugin-advanced-http plugin
2.) Migrating the project to a capacitor project 
3.) Running the built application on a device and attempt to make a HTTP call with the plugin

## Other Technical Details

`npm --version` output:
6.13.1

`node --version` output:
v10.16.3

`pod --version` output (iOS issues only):
N/A

Not currently listed as a known incompatible plugin in the capacitor docs
https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/cordova/known-incompatible-plugins
* use same duration for long and short toasts on ios, android and web (closes #2175 )
* make `short` the default on all platforms
* make android and ios actually use the duration option
* I used this test app to test the toast duration: https://github.com/pwespi/toast-test/
inputPlaceholder is set as text, so users have to remove it before typing, it should be a placeholder that automatically gets replaced when you start typing. 

since it might be considered a breaking change, I've added it to the 2.0 milestone
Implements feature request #1621 

It can be one of 3 positions: 'top', 'center' or 'bottom' (the default).

## Current Behavior
Last week i implemented push notifications with FCM (via Android "native" functionality and PWA). It worked without a problem. Today I tried again and i got the following error message in my console: 

Msg: ERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): FirebaseError: Messaging: This browser doesn't support the API's required to use the firebase SDK. (messaging/unsupported-browser).
    FirebaseError: Messaging: This browser doesn't support the API's required to use the firebase SDK. (messaging/unsupported-browser).

After closing the app and removing the app storage in the device settings it works fine again. Only after a reinstall of the app it will return to the error seen above.

I console logged DeviceInfo. On first app install the platform is set to web. After removing the storage of the app the platform changes to android (like it was before the issue). My app will try to register PWA notifications when "web" is returned. If "android: is returned it will send a FCM token to my backend that saves it. 


## Expected Behavior
I expect it to implement the Firebase SDK after first installation of the app and registrate for Android Push Notifications. I also expect DeviceInfo to return android as platform after I installed the app.

## Other related information

My project uses a external url to load the app. To do this my Capacitor,config.json looks like the following (on the website itself everything works fine):
` 
{
  "appId": "com.dialogPoc.app",
  "appName": "build-angular",
  "bundledWebRuntime": false,
  "npmClient": "npm",
  "webDir": "www",
  "cordova": {},
  "server": {
    "url": "https://myapp.com"
  }
}
`
My app uses the generated service worker from Angular. My app also registers FCM for PWA in this generated service worker.

Code that i use to register my app for FCM notifications with Android and Capacitor:

```
import { Plugins, DeviceInfo, PushNotificationToken, PushNotificationActionPerformed, PushNotification } from "@capacitor/core";
const { PushNotifications } = Plugins;
registerCapacitorNotifications( ) {
        PushNotifications.register();
        PushNotifications.addListener('registration', 
            (token: PushNotificationToken) => {
                console.log('Push registration success, token: ' + token.value);
                this.addPushSubscriber(token.value); <-- sending token to backend
            }
        );
    }
```
This is the first time submitting a issue ever and English is not my first language. If anything is not described the way it should be or if there should be more information please let me know.
Add 2 plugins.
Wechat auth login and pay.
Alipay auth login and pay.
Currently, android done.

## Describe the Bug
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the feature request is. Please include if your feature request is related to a problem. -->
The problem I am having is that when I schedule a local notification for a future date, the notification will be displayed with the time the local notification was created as the timestamp, not the time the notification was scheduled.

## Platform 
<!-- Leave these checkboxes EMPTY until after the issue is created. Once the issue is created, check one or more boxes for the platform(s) where this feature should be added. Note that certain features may not be supported on some platforms (i.e. no web API is available, etc.) -->

- [x] Android
- [ ] iOS
- [ ] Electron
- [ ] Web



Rather than simply calling `call.success()` on iOS as soon as a user requests permissions (regardless of result), this adds a completion that allows the user to `await` the result in their app and passes back the response or error.

Also adds an `unregister()` method in case the user wants to stop the app receiving push notifications
Most plugin docs have an Example section, and every one of them is different. 

- Some of them use the plugin inside a class https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/apis/geolocation#example
- Some of them use the plugin inside an `async methodName`, which is not proper javascript https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/apis/filesystem#example
- Others use the plugin API directly https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/apis/keyboard#example
- Some plugins don't have an Example section https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/apis/motion

The docs should be consistent in the code samples
