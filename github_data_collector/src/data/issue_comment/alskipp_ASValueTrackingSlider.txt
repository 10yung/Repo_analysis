Hi,
First I like ASValueTrackingSlider.

But Its very difficult to drag slider to exact value 
example  I want to set value to 15.00 value, for ASValueTrackingSlider 0.00 - 100.00 value its take lot of time to reach set 15.00 value.
If you return multiple line string with line brake "\n" in delegate, popup view will have implicit animations.

To fix it, modify line 93 in ASValuePopUpView.m
`_textLayer.actions = @{@"contents" : [NSNull null],@"bounds" : [NSNull null]};`
 Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[ASValueTrackingSlider name]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x10218d2a0'

I am trying to create a slider programmatically (not using storyboard), but the popup value does not work. When I create it on the storyboard, it works fine, but defining it programmatically creates the slider with no popup... any ideas?
Hi,

Can you add Carthage support please?
