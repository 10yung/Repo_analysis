Thanks
So I have already downloaded a course last month and say for example the course got updated yesterday and I wanted to download the updates. When I did try to download it, it was correctly identifying which lessons are already downloaded but when it came to the newly added lesson, it downloaded it but instead of just downloading that new lesson, it downloaded all other lessons after it.

I think this happens because the comparison of the already downloaded lessons and new lessons are just via filename and since there's a number prefix on the downloaded lessons, it will bump up the number starting from the new lesson added 'til end.

Not sure what's the best approach on how this can be avoided/fixed. Probably when doing filename/title comparison remove the prefix?

Thanks.
