Replace the deprecated function dplyr::tbl_df() with tibble::as_tibble() and make corresponding changes to the text
Also load tibble package to use as_tibble() function instead of deprecated dplyr::tbl_df() function.
Maybe it will be reasonable to change this:

> We'll call plot from inside the R command with which evaluates "an R expression in an environment constructed from data". 

to something like this:

> We'll call plot() using R command with(). It evaluates "an R expression in an environment constructed from data".

... ideally to add parentheses for all function names in the lesson to improve readability.
I took me while to understand this sentence. Together with whole question from exercise, it sound even worse.
p.s. **the lesson itself is perfect, thus I'm typing this here.**

I had a great time and honestly couldn't wait every time I dived into the introductory lessons in the Programming in R section. However, in the Getting and Cleaning Data module, I've been consistently frustrated during the script exercises, where essentially I have to guess how to combine two functions I've basically never used into a very specific permutation. When I submit() and get it wrong, all I'm told is to re-read the notes I've already read that give no more clues for how to get it right or read the (frankly) pretty badly written documentation that doesn't get me any closer to what I'm supposed to do. This is particularly bad in the unit on cleaning data with tidyr. It's a frustrating loop to just trial-and-error your way through every imaginable argument until you finally get something rightâ€”of course, with zero knowledge about why you got it right in the end. This needs a thorough update.




I'm trying to learn R on the swirl package "Least Squares Estimation" and am having two problems.
1) It mentioned using the manipulate function but when I've tried to use it, it says that it can't find the function. 
2) In this lesson, I've had to plot regression lines and there are parts where it wants me to view the formulas for the slope of the regression line. 
However, I a having difficulty doing this. I believe it said earlier that I can access it by clicking on the gear function on the upper left of graph but it is not appearing.
Thanks

The following accepts an invalid answer, it should only accept (0), but accepts (4,0)
