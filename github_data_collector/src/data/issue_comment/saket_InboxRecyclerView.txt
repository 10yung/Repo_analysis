Making `ExpandablePageLayout` extend `RelativeLayout` was a mistake because it can be terrible at performance. Now that v2.0 is around the corner (#34) with breaking changes, it might be a good time to do this.

The fix works for any amount of items above the content, though with no support for items below.

When the InboxRecyclerView is inside a NestedScrollView, there are lots of issues, such as the ExpandablePage expanding from farther down the list than wanted, and the items all being pushed down and replaced with blanks. Not sure if it's inherent to the NestedScrollView but it wasn't happening with regular RecyclerView.
Listening to nested scrolling events would make it much easier to support scrollable child Views rather than asking users to manually do it by [intercepting pull-to-collapse gesture](https://github.com/saket/InboxRecyclerView/wiki/Pull-to-collapse).
