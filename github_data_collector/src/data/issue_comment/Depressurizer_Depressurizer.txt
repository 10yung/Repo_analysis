Dear Sir,

Thanks for all of your contributions to the project as Depressurizer _was_ quite useful in the _past_ and now half or more of its functions are "obsolete" thanks to Steam (Valve) integrated what once was only available via Depressurizer within their Internal Browser with the "New UI" so that Depressurizer is **not** needed anymore for the majority of the users (especially novice) as now Steam Client does it _"Better"_, don't shoot the messenger for saying the truth.

Why? One word as **"Dynamic Collections"** literally kills any need for Depressurizer as it's lightning fast compared to all the shenanigans Depressurizer using with constant "Needy" application to ever manualy updating the SharedConfig.vdf whereas new Steam Client does it On-the_Fly with unparalleled ease on user's end making your baby now halfway _defunct_. This is not a bad thing but a **PRAISE** to your application as Steam (Valve) recently also embedded half of functionality what _Augmented Steam_ offers (https://es.isthereanydeal.com/) which is merely used now for ITAD Price checking as half of its functions are either implemented within Steam Servers or at test phase like https://store.steampowered.com/labs/.

So what now? Simple as "Time for a Change" as it's _[Adapt or Die]_ situation at your hands for Depressurizer as Steam Library will also evolve taking more functionality from here. By functionality Depressurizer already lost these:
* Genre AutoCat
* Tags AutoCat
* Flags AutoCat (at least half of it)

because they were **"Internal"** to Steam Data as Steam Client now does it AUTO-matically without the need for manual Depressurizer Update Cycles thanks to _Dynamic Collections_. What's left for Depressurizer is all **"External"**(~ish to focus on) functions like:
* HowLong AutoCat
* User Score AutoCat (Steam now uses Meta Score but expected to support User Scores as well)
* Platform AutoCat (even if it's Internal Data, Steam doesn't care again _for now_ as VR has it)
* **Custom** AutoCats such as Publishers, Developers, Curators and Language...

And that's why Depressurizer Future lies within those functions Steam will _"Never"_ implement. And even if Depressurizer now has SAME functions for now Steam Client has, it's time to remove or "Update" them so that they'll create _Dynamic Collections_ instead of **Scraping** and doing manual labor for each entry which is _totally Inferior_ to Dynamic Collections. Humble suggestion is just to analyze current Steam Library actions over "Sharedconfig.vdf" (or other files involved) to **MiMic** _Dynamic Collections_ via Depressurizer Interface without actually scraping anything.

So instead of _lost functionality_, remove such defunct code to "Lighten" the application more (both in terms of Size and **Speed**) and focus on **Custom** Filters where Depressurizer is still providing `Unique Experience` compared to Steam Client will ever will. You can try to _"Resist"_ but this won't change the inevitable as Steam actions made _Discord_ take huge damage, (Enhanced) Augmented Steam lessened, Depressurizer being pushed away.

Why this plea? Simple as long time not used your baby after spending weeks on manual updates to get nearing _perfect_ arrangement on a thousands of games Steam library, and now decided to re-use Depressurizer to make "Final Changes" to updated Library to see `Depressurizer is what it always WAS, with its bugs and so forth` and it saddened me deeply. As a _Bug Report_, did you know that your Depressurizer-v4.12.1 **CAN'T** import thousands of games data whereas Depressurizer-v3.1.0 **DID** it without any complaints? Sorry to say but when did such _"Downgrade"_ began to happen even if _Changelog_ says otherwise?

And even sadder to see _both_ can't import data correctly so that even if Data is there within https://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails/?appids=500 (For Example) Depressurizer **CAN'T** import Year AutoCat from whatever servers you're using as v4.12 got connected to a Akamai Node (which Steam uses) whereas  v3.1.0 got connected to [Elisa Oyj](https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip/193.229.113.138) (what?) Server for what purposes for same data with minutes apart of execution. All because just wanted to use "Year AutoCat" for later bought games where thousands of games fallen into `Unknown Text.`

Again, thanks for all of your hard work and contributions so far as this was an _Abandoned_ Project that you _Forked_ later merged (took over) with main as followed your progress through /r/Steam. Even if above has lots of criticism, it's form of _Tough Love_ as really don't want Depressurizer to become abandoned again in the light of Steam Library taking over your functionality. Just suggesting to **ADAPT** so that Depressurizer can be better than ever focusing and improving what's left instead of trying to compete with _"Dynamic Collections"_. Also even if Steam Client Library is a Web Script (so that it's Disabled with -no-browser switch unlike Old UI), it's _Faster_ than Depressurizer supposed to be an Executable needing .NET Framework.

It's still your choice but heed my warning...

Best Regards.

Depressurizer latest (4.12.1)

Start the application and it throws a Fatal Error.
Deleted %appdata%/Depressurizer in case old data (It's been a while since I used the program) was breaking things.
Started program, and it throws the same error

**Describe the bug**
After saving the profile and verifying the file is in the userdata folder, starting Steam Beta will not show the new categories. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Close Steam
2. Save profile
3. Open Steam
4. See error


**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Windows 10


The problem I have is that scraping my 8000+ games will take forever because as of now scraping will crash with an exception after a few dozen games read (known issue from what I've read).

Won't it be possible that depressurizer has a database included? Maybe there could be a possibility for users to submit their databases and then merge them.

Seems like a cool tool, but unusable for me at the moment, sadly.
I'm not having any of the other issues people seem to be having with the beta. My categories were not deleted. However, if any of them end with a ? and were generated using depressurizer I can't select them. If I create a category in steam and end it with a ? it works fine.
Using depressurizer version 4.12.1, I removed and edited some categories and export the config with steam closed, then open steam and my edits do not appear to have been applied (no change in collections area or on game pages). I'd guess they are storing the information differently now? 
This closes #162.

This is a dirty implementation for #162, including hard-coded, non-reusable, no tests, etc. I originally planned it as new functions or a new user option.

I see that the compression ratio is about 4%, which is huge. Database writes are infrequent, but it seems to occur at startup, and perhaps multiple loops when a particular operation.

Thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32943899/can-i-decompress-and-deserialize-a-file-using-streams.

**Describe the bug**
Editing autocat from an old profile causes fatal error, program will terminate

**To Reproduce**
1.: EDIT AUTOCATS
2.: Select this autocat from the list

**Expected behavior**
Beeing able to at least view the autocat and fix the offending value

**Screenshots**

**Additional context**
-

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Database.json looks obese (tens of megabytes) when users have downloaded data for all.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Extended `database.cs`, use `zipFile` to read/save `database.json.zip` file. This database is not often written. The old database file can be packaged to new at first startup.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
N/A.

**Additional context**
It is a good income for size, reducing disk space usage, write time (for low speed disk) and SSD loss. Even with the fastest compression, it still works well.
**Describe the bug**
As title.

**To Reproduce**
1. Start Depressurizer v4.12.1, whether or not to create a profile.
2. Wait, you may manipulate other windows (like Browser, in maximized) at the same time, which may miss the Depressurizer window(s).
3. Apply and fill the Steam web key.
3. Close and restart Depressurizer.
4. Clicking the Stop button in the download games list window when the key is asked.

**Expected behavior**
1. N/A
2. Re-enable this.ShowIcon and ShowInTaskbar alleviates this problem, but if you can show the main window and then load the profile (`LoadProfile(Settings.ProfileToLoad, false);` in `FormMain_Load`), it would be better.
3. If you can explain its utility and delay the filling of the key (like option on profile), it is friendly to newer users.
3. You are asked again about the key, it is not saved, it is troublesome.
4. It work, though it does not continue. This may be because `ShowDialog()` in `\src\Depressurizer\CDlgUpdateProfile.cs`, and it is called by `LoadProfile` from `FormMain_Load`, the main form is not loaded.

**Screenshots**
N/A.
