This is actually not an issue but I really want to know that how is your dialog shadow does not appear on the status bar. I'm trying to accomplish this task from past 1 week. Please help
I tried this piece of code:

        val galleryIntent: Intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT)
        galleryIntent.type = "image/*"
        val intentPickerSheetView = IntentPickerSheetView(this, galleryIntent, "Share with...", IntentPickerSheetView.OnIntentPickedListener { activityInfo ->
            bottomsheet.dismissSheet()
        })
        bottomsheet.showWithSheetView(intentPickerSheetView)

It works, but on landscape I get this tiny bottom sheet:

How come?

Attached sample project.

I get so many errors.
I tried to overcome them, and still got errors:

 bottomsheet在平板设备上宽度不能占满，盼解决
### Context

We are still using this library and recently migrated to AndroidX. It seems though the Jetifier is not handling correctly some parts leading to a crash. 

```
Field 'androidx.fragment.app.Fragment.mContainerId' is inaccessible to class 'androidx.core.app.AccessFragmentInternals' (declaration of 'androidx.core.app.AccessFragmentInternals' appears in base.apk)
       at androidx.core.app.AccessFragmentInternals.getContainerId(AccessFragmentInternals.java:9)
```

### Contents of the PR

It would be great if this PR could be merged in or at least a new branch is created in order to allow any users with AndroidX use it as well! 
Hi All.

I am not sure if this is a known problem, but I could'n find anything similar. I hope someone can help me.

I am Using a BottomSheetFragment to show details from certain Object. But the thing is that in some cases I need to change the visibility of a few elements to "GONE", like there are things that need to be show when the Fragment is expanded or in peek state. But when is removed an element, the BottomSheetFragment expands. And in some times doesn't let me get dismiss the Fragment.

Thank you for your attention.
in landscape orientation when i expand bottomsheet and changing orientation my menu has many space from bottom of screen and i must to sweep again to resolve this problem

MenuSheetView icon  is not showing
Hi folks, would you accept a pr contribution to allow rounded corners like the new material spec?
I was trying to achieve showing the bottomsheet on the view of UnityPlayerActivity, which is the default activity exported from unity, but I found the bottomsheet couldn't be seeing unless I rotated the phone.It means the bottomsheet was Instantiated  but be covered by the view of unity.I wonder if there is anything I can do with bottomsheet or the preset of bottomsheet conflicts with unity-exported activity.
Here are my codes:
 mUnityPlayer = new UnityPlayer(this);
 setContentView(R.layout.unity_layout);
 linearLayout = (LinearLayout)findViewById(R.id.unity_player);
 linearLayout.addView(mUnityPlayer.getView());
 mUnityPlayer.requestFocus();

in my click function I use it like this
 ExploreFragment exploreFragment = new ExploreFragment();
//explorefragment is a child class of BottomSheetFragment
exploreFragment.show(getSupportFragmentManager(),R.id.unity_bottomsheet);
