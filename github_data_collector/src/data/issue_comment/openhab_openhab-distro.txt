Remove Jetty redirect rule to the former dashboard
since the UI will be served at the root path.

Depends on https://github.com/openhab/openhab-webui/pull/178

Signed-off-by: Yannick Schaus <github@schaus.net>
Largely from a discussion with @kaikreuzer - the issue with the installation/update scripts is that the URLs for the various distributions (snapshots, milestones, stables) are hardcoded.  This creates the following issues;
1. If something deviates from established norm (such as the 2.5.x downloads), the scripts become unusable without manual changes on the user's end.
2. The scripts have no idea what versions are available and depend on the user to enter the version they want (whether it's available or not) and in the correct format (2.5.0-snapshot, etc).
3. If we ever change providers or URLs, the update scripts break until someone either manually makes a change or redownloads the newest script (with the updated URLs).

I'd like to propose a file in the distro repo that will describe all the various openHAB versions available, some metadata about the version (useful for the scripts) and the download URL for each.

That way the installation/update scripts (including openhabian) can, at runtime:
1.  Know the download URL for each version
2.  Be able to display a list of versions for the user to choose
3.  Have extra meta data for the version that the script can use (such as a sorting order, version category [stable, milestone, etc] - rather than relying on parsing the version number - allows the version numbers to vary in format if we want).

Although I really don't care what format the file should be (comma delimited, xml, json) - I'm going to suggest json...

The following could be an example file:
```
[
	{
		"version": "2.5.0-SNAPSHOT",
		"downloadUrl": "https://ci.openhab.org/job/openHAB-Distribution/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/distributions/openhab/target/openhab-2.5.0.zip",
		"addonUrl": "https://ci.openhab.org/job/openHAB-Distribution/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/distributions/openhab-addons/target/openhab-addons-2.5.0.kar",
		"meta": {
			"title" : "2.5.0 Snapshot"
			"category": "snapshot",
			"displayOrder": 51
		}
	},
	{
		"version": "2.5.0",
		"downloadUrl": "https://bintray.com/openhab/mvn/download_file?file_path=org%2Fopenhab%2Fdistro%2Fopenhab%2F2.5.0%2Fopenhab-2.5.0.zip",
		"addonUrl": "https://bintray.com/openhab/mvn/download_file?file_path=org%2Fopenhab%2Fdistro%2Fopenhab-addons%2F2.5.0%2Fopenhab-addons-2.5.0.kar",
		"meta": {
			"default" : true,
			"title" : "2.5.0 Stable"
			"category": "stable",
			"displayOrder": 50
		}
	},
	{
		"version": "2.4.0",
		"downloadUrl": "https://bintray.com/openhab/mvn/download_file?file_path=org%2Fopenhab%2Fdistro%2Fopenhab%2F2.5.0%2Fopenhab-2.4.0.zip",
		"addonUrl": "https://bintray.com/openhab/mvn/download_file?file_path=org%2Fopenhab%2Fdistro%2Fopenhab-addons%2F2.5.0%2Fopenhab-addons-2.4.0.kar",
		"meta": {
			"title" : "2.4.0 Stable"
			"category": "stable",
			"displayOrder": 49
		}
	},
	// every old version supported
]
```

Basically  you have each version and it's download URLs.  The meta data can then be used by the scripts for display purposes (the 'default' would be the current default distribution to download, the title is something to display, the category describes stable/milestone/snapshot and the display order can control the ordering in the UI).

Thoughts?

FYI - I can certainly submit a PR for this file (assuming against master not 2.5.x) and then followup with PR on the windows update scripts (and I'll change the windows installation [@kaikreuzer we still need to talk about that one btw]) but would like someone to do the linux side and pull in whoever does the openhabian side as well..

Pure question - why is openhab-cli in the linuxpkg rather than part of the distro?  I'd like to create the windows equivalent to it - while I can do that on the windows installer, seems like this ought to be more of distro thing?
As discussed [here](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/pull/1043#issuecomment-573330300) it would be good to move the zigbee feature file to the zigbee binding so that everything remains consistent with the libraries defined in one place.

After upgrading from 2.4 to 2.5 using APT package, all mqtt items in the PaperUI have no decimal points and no decimal value. The value is rounded to the nearest whole number.

kind regards
After upgrading from 2.4 tot 2.5 using APT package on Raspbian (Raspberry Pi 3) the logs in /var/logs/openhab2 aren't updated anymore. The last entries in both openhab.log and events.log are items related to version 2.4 going "down".

Did I miss something while upgrading to 2.5 or are does Openhab2 2.5  stopped using the logs in /var/logs/openhab2? (on Raspbian)

kind regards

Erik
The demo app for the 2.5.x branch misses `rest/swagger.json`. It also misses the `/rest/extensions` (Visible in PaperUI as the menu entry Add-ons is missing) and seems to miss some other rest apis as well. I couldn't directly see why they were missing or is this intentional? I will continue looking into it, but if it's intentional of if someone has an idea that might cause this, that would be helpful.
Currently, it seems that Docker HUB tagging for OpenHAB is not according to best practices and semantic versioning.

For example: the tag 2.4.0 was updated 5 days ago, although there was a much older original version of this tag (and probably several versions in between).

A tag that gets updated like this should be called "2.4-latest" or "2.4.x", clearly marking that this is continuously updated.

If there is a patch release of OpenHAB, which is then released as a Docker image, its tag should follow the patch version of OpenHAB (e.g.: 2.4.1). Docker tags like this are supposed to be immutable and only image-building error fixes should change it (if they happen at all).

With the current system, deployments behave unpredictably because several, slightly different versions can easily be present on my developer machine and on deployed environments (without being obvious why this happens)
Last moments of 2019 to be on the cutting edge of technology ;-)

I have done a clean install of the IDE, and made sure that all repo's are at the latest commit, in order to test out the IDE install itself, and the demo.app. Something is broken

First of all, the bndrun file needs to be altered slightly to remove the missing ui.paper and and the reference to transform.map (this bundle still references smart home).

Secondly, when starting the demo app, the runtime does not go further than :

```
Welcome to Apache Felix Gogo

g! 14:05:16.518 [pool-8-thread-1] INFO  o.o.c.service.AbstractWatchService:170 - Loading script 'demo.js'
```

Nothing else happens, even as all bundles are loaded :
