https://github.com/lxtGH/Fast_Seg This repo contains the pytorch version of ICnet which **5 point higher** than origin paper.
hello, I want to train ICNet with pascal voc dataset in caffe. I have changed the number of class in .prototxt, and written the solver.pototxt according to  the paper. But the loss also around 0.5, and the accuracy is too low.
Because my GPU is 8G memory,  I can only set mini_batchsize to 8, but by setting iter_size to 2. So the batch size  is 16. Can you help me.
Looking forward to your reply！
How do you set the weights for different classes when calculating loss? I train the model using the weights I give. But the model still learn the detect the background. Can you introduce the method you use?
Hi, 
I once used this script to test the speed of ICNet in Matlab :

 tic;
 score = net.forward({input_data});
 temp = toc;

But I got the result of 15.6fps on 1080ti without other programs running, the result provided by the author is more than 30fps, then I used the scripts provided by the author in Caffe, the result is 31fps on 1080ti, which is lager than the original result, I was confused about it. Can you help me?

请问您有打算发行tensorflow版本的代码吗
Does your Cityscapes test dataset have labels?I have downloaded a label without a test data set from the official website.So I can't get the test mean IOU

Hello ! could you porvide me the training parameters set? beacause  I train the model ,I found it can not reach the paper performance . Thank you ！
why the input image size of cityscapes is 1025 x 2049?
Shouldn't be 1024 x 2048? The original image size is 1024 x 2048 in cityscapes dataset.
The performance of icnet_cityscapes_train_30k.caffemodel is better than icnet_cityscapes_train_30k_bnnomerge.caffemodel, however the trained model is supposed to output the latter model file. How is the conversion done between the two model weights and what's the reason behind it? I couldn't get it from the information in the note provided. Thanks!
