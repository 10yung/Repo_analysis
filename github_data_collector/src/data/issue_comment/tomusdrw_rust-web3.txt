Hi, 

I'm attempting to query a contract's public mapping `(bytes32 => Struct)` to the retrieve the variables of a `Struct { address addr, uint256 mynum }`.

```
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: InvalidOutputType("Expected single element, got a list: [Address(0x75dd74e8afe8110c8320ed397cccff3b8134d371), Uint(1337000000000000000000000000)]")', src/libcore/result.rs:1192:5
```

I can see the correct variables there, but don't know how to access them. 

I tried the below based on other solutions (https://github.com/tomusdrw/rust-web3/issues/47 and https://github.com/tomusdrw/rust-web3/issues/115) in the closed issues with no success.

```
186 |         let result: (Address, H256) = new_tx.query_contract().unwrap();
    |                     ---------------   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected tuple, found struct `std::vec::Vec`
    |                     |
    |                     expected due to this

``` 

Or a similar error: `expected tuple, found struct web3::contract::QueryResult`

Thank you in advance.

Having a quick glance to the dependencies I see you depend on hyper directly, would it be a big effort to use reqwest instead? is one of the most used http clients this days and provides a nicer API, on top of that they already went through the effort of making it work with web assembly which seems like a major effort that this project doesn't look very motivated to take. Reqwest would act as the abstraction layer that makes the switch from a hyper backend to browser fetch at compile time.  
Nicer http api plus wasm support, sounds like a nice deal right?
Hi,

I am trying to execute `simple_log_sub.rs` in the example but it stops around the contract deployment(around l.23). The compile is properly done though it hangs. In ganache log, the contract deployment is done but rust code stops at the deployment code. Actually, `simple_log_filter.rs` seems to have the same behavior.
Do I miss something to run them?

What I did is following the instruction written in the readme but I am using the beta version of ganache-cli.
 
Thank you

Hi,

is there a method to create an account based on an existing private key, similiar to
[https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.0/web3-eth-accounts.html#privatekeytoaccount](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.0/web3-eth-accounts.html#privatekeytoaccount) so that is possible to us HDWallet keys or simple local keys as an starting point?

thx

I noticed that Geth 1.9.6 added support for specifying block hashes for some methods (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/19491).

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1898

In my code, I've been passing the block number through, but passing the block hash through will give consistent answers if a re-org happens in the middle of some calls.

I think functions that have `block: Option<BlockNumber>` in their args would need to change, but I haven't thought about exactly how yet.
