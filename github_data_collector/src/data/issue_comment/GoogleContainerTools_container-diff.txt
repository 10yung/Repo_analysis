### Expected behavior
`container-diff diff` does not panic due to concurrent map writes

### Actual behavior

https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-diff/blob/bca8ca4edd015e66f7da6e684f99af2f45813894/cmd/diff.go#L118
Will cause a panic due to concurrent map writes 

This is because `processImage` is called in two goroutines. 
`processImage` eventually calls `util.unpackTar` which has unsynchronized access to `util.hardlinks`

### Information

- container-diff version: I'm trying to figure this out (it's the kaniko kokoro build)
- Operating system: I'm trying to figure this out (it's the kaniko kokoro build)

### Steps to reproduce the behavior
1. I haven't seen this error locally; only in the kaniko kokoro build
### Expected behavior

A ready to run docker image containing `container-diff` on DockerHub or GCR or another public registry.
Allows for using `container-diff` conveniently via `docker run` without prio installation.

### Actual behavior

`container-diff` must be installed locally manually before it can be used.

### Information

There is an [inofficial image on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gridx/container-diff) but can it be trusted?

### Expected behavior
Cache directory to be within `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` and default to be within `$HOME/.cache` i.e. `$HOME/.cache/container-diff`  

### Actual behavior
Cache directory is on `.container-diff/cache` which is a non-standard location.

### Information

- container-diff version: 0.15.0
- Operating system: Arch Linux

### Steps to reproduce the behavior

1. Use container-diff
### Expected behavior
container-diff diff daemon://<local_image1> daemon://<local_image2> --type=history
above command shows the diff 
### Actual behavior
fails with fatal error
### Information

- container-diff version: v0.15.0
- Operating system: Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS

### Steps to reproduce the behavior

1. container-diff diff daemon://<local_image1> daemon://<local_image2> --type=history


Additional information : docker images on local are approx 2GB + in size

### Expected behavior

do not try and pull images that are already locally available

### Actual behavior

trying to pull images from someware and failing due to authorization issues

### Information

- container-diff version: v0.15.0
- Operating system: ubuntu 19.04

### Steps to reproduce the behavior

1. install

```console
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/container-diff/latest/container-diff-linux-amd64 && chmod +x container-diff-linux-amd64 && sudo mv container-diff-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/container-diff
```
2.  use it

```console
container-diff diff 5a00b471a0c3 467490b19f1d                                                                                                                                                                         [17:39:30]
ERRO[0003] error retrieving image 5a00b471a0c3: UNAUTHORIZED: authentication required; [map[Type:repository Class: Name:library/5a00b471a0c3 Action:pull]]                                                                                                             
error retrieving image 5a00b471a0c3: UNAUTHORIZED: authentication required; [map[Type:repository Class: Name:library/5a00b471a0c3 Action:pull]]
```

It goes without saying, the images ids are correct and those correspond to images in my computer.

I've also tried with names and names + tags
### Expected behavior
When running
`container-diff diff <path to tar file1> <path to tar file2> --type=file`
multiple times from different directories (modifying paths to tar files as needed to point at the same tar files), I expected to get the same correct output summary.
### Actual behavior
Changing dirs and running `container-diff` for the same pair of tar files produces different diff summaries.
### Information

- container-diff version: v0.15.0
- Operating system: linux

### Steps to reproduce the behavior

Notes before reproducing
The provided image tars have one file that is different that is
`/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts`
In the process of building the image, some files were generated and deleted. So the final image does not contain the following files:
`/var/cache/fontconfig/d589a48862398ed80a3d6066f4f56f4c-le64.cache-6`
`/var/cache/fontconfig/7ef2298fde41cc6eeb7af42e48b7d293-le64.cache-6`
`/var/cache/fontconfig/3830d5c3ddfd5cd38a049b759396e72e-le64.cache-6`
`/var/cache/fontconfig/4c599c202bc5c08e2d34565a40eac3b2-le64.cache-6`

1. Copy the pair of tar files with my existing directory structure.
`$ gsutil cp -r gs://container-diff-test .`
2. Run the container-diff tool from the first location.
`$ cd container-diff-test`
`$ container-diff diff tests/contrib/rbe-test-xenial_repro_test_test_img1_outs/img_outs/rbe-test-xenial-with-pkgs.tar tests/contrib/rbe-test-xenial_repro_test_test_img2_outs/img_outs/rbe-test-xenial-with-pkgs.tar --type=file`
This produces an output saying that the non-existing files (from above) are different between the two images. Also it says nothing about the actual file that is different.
3. Run the container-diff tool from another location (assuming your current dir is `container-diff-test`.
`$ cd tests/contrib`
`$ container-diff diff rbe-test-xenial_repro_test_test_img1_outs/img_outs/rbe-test-xenial-with-pkgs.tar rbe-test-xenial_repro_test_test_img2_outs/img_outs/rbe-test-xenial-with-pkgs.tar --type=file`
This produces the correct output saying that only `/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts` is different.
I would like to see if this change makes sense. If so, please let me know what tests I should add and where
So right now the --type=file only reports if the file contents are different, but not if the metadata are different. Supporting file metadata diff will be useful in development/debugging related to file permissions, timestamps in containers.
With the latest release, `container-diff --help` doesn't print anything as it should (see https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-diff/issues/301#issuecomment-478742411)

### Expected behavior

```bash
container-diff --help
container-diff is a CLI tool for analyzing and comparing container images.

Images can be specified from either a local Docker daemon, or from a remote registry.
To specify a local image, prefix the image ID with 'daemon://', e.g. 'daemon://gcr.io/foo/bar'.
To specify a remote image, prefix the image ID with 'remote://', e.g. 'remote://gcr.io/foo/bar'.
If no prefix is specified, the local daemon will be checked first.

Tarballs can also be specified by simply providing the path to the .tar, .tar.gz, or .tgz file.

Usage:
  container-diff [command]

Available Commands:
  analyze     Analyzes an image: [image]
  diff        Compare two images: [image1] [image2]
  help        Help about any command
  version     Print the version of container-diff

Flags:
      --format string      Format to output diff in.
  -h, --help               help for container-diff
  -v, --verbosity string   This flag controls the verbosity of container-diff. (default "warning")

Use "container-diff [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Actual behavior
```bash
$ container-diff --help
Usage of container-diff:
```
### Information
- OS: Tested on ubuntu 18.04, 16.04, and archlinx (see issue linked above)
- container-diff version: v0.15.0

### Steps to reproduce the behavior
 Install container-diff as specific for linux in the README.md, and then run `container-diff --help`.
