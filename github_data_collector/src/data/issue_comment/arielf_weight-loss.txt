Hi Ariel,

I have created a Dockerfile which installs all the dependencies required to run this script and also updated the Makefile to add some make docker commands.

I renamed the file `ariel.csv` to `root.csv` due to it looking for the username :

```
mv ariel.csv root.csv
```

Then I run the following make command :

```
make docker-score-chart
```

or the abbreviated command is :

```
make dsc
```

It will then build the docker container if it doesn't exist and then generate the `scores.txt` and `root.scores.png` files.

I was hoping to be able to use your repository to help with doing similar machine-learning but with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Symptoms.

Instead of adding in weight we instead add in a digestive symptom score which is calculated by an app called [Cara](https://cara-app.com/)  :

> The symptom score is calculated on the basis of the symptoms tracked with Cara. The value can be between 0 and 100. The higher the symptom score, the more severe are the digestive problems in the region.

There was a discussion earlier today on Reddit about using Machine Learning to troubleshoot IBS symptoms :
https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/9f1w46/im_working_on_a_startup_to_find_individual/

and it reminded me of your Weight Loss machine learning repository I looked at a while ago, any way let me know what you think!


I think I must have collected the data wrong, but here's the SO question.

https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/298151/making-sense-of-the-results-of-machine-learning-feature-selection

Here's an example of the data format I tried to mimic (ariel.csv)

```

Edit: Do you think I should reset the counter to 0 (it increases or decreases by 25 for win or lose) with every new player?

Example:

```
# playerName playerID
arbitrary-date, 0, # NOTE Erased characters on every first game because they impact the score of a game before. Might be easier to explain with math. No n characters on the first line because n-1 game is missing.
same-date, 25, a b c d e f g h
same-date, 50, a b c d e f g h
# playerName playerID
same-date, 0, #??????? Go back to zero here?
same-date,- 25, a b c d e f g h
same-date, 0, a b c d e f g h
```
Hey Ariel :) I saw that you're answering questions through issues. I hope this is the best way to reach you.

I love this project! I'm using it on Clash Royale like this

```

Everything's working great. I can generate a score chart and see the best cards overall. But what I noticed in username.train is something like this

```
    -1202.00 | giant10 valkyrie9 minion_horde12 rage_barbarian3 chr_witch7 lightning6 bomber12 zap12
```

I'm assuming those are the most commonly played cards? Or is that the best possible deck combination, because it has the greatest negative weight (-1202) meaning it wins against the player more frequently than any other combination?

I guess I'm asking the significance of the number on the left and how the features are chosen on the right side, and from there I can work toward finding the best 8 card combination. Thanks for any help you can provide!
Love this N=1 work. I've done Atkins and took my weight from 232 to 208 - but since then I'm back around 214 and looking to kickstart my own journey.
Would love to hear what you've learned since mid 2016.
