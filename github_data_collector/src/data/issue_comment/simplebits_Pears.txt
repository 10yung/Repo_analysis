Does Pears support LESS?

In your readme: 

Pears is an open source WordPress theme. I'll admit the code 
is a bit rough, initially based on the default **'twentyone'** theme.

Did you mean Twenty Ten? 

disclaimer: i am a github noob so i apologize if this is not the place to ask this.

I noticed style.css is probably just from the old TwentyTen theme, but I'd like to use it. It's in the theme's root folder and I have added a reference to it from header.php. I can see the style sheet if i go directly to the url, but the site doesn't recognize it. 

Is it because it has to be a .less file? I tried to change it to that too but no luck. 

Is anyone using a custom style sheet for this? I don't want to have to ftp screen.less every time i have a change.

Can't seem to figure out how to replicate the static welcome page from pea.rs in my local Wordpress installation. 

Any ideas? 

I was looking for a way to use Sass snippets rather than CSS snippets so I did some digging and discovered a very useful API for compiling CSS using preprocessors. (http://divshot.com/alloy)

I've modified the functions.php file to include the following configurations:

``` php
// Setup for CSS preprocessors
// Possible options here:
// css, sass, scss, less, stylus
define("STYLE_TYPE", "scss");
define("COMPASS", true); // if you're using Sass/scss, will you be using compass?
```

Simply update those to use your CSS preprocessor of choice.

Hopefully this will be useful to others.

<p>I haven't done extensive testing on which special characters, but my case caused fairly serious issues. I'm creating a style guide and wanted to mark up <code>pre</code> and <code>code</code> outputs. The example output is:</p>

<pre>
<code>&#60;?php </code>
<code>echo 'Hello World!';</code>
<code>?&#62;</code>
</pre>

<p>When I used this initially, the page treated the angle brackets as closing tags, which then caused everything below to act oddly. In the Pears HTML field, I replaced the angle brackets as follows:</p>

<pre>
<code>&#38;#60;?php </code>
<code>echo 'Hello World!';</code>
<code>?&#38;#62;</code>
</pre>

<p>When I update the page, this fixes the page but the Pears HTML field replaces the entities with the characters they would render to, causing subsequent updates to be broken again. I don't know how many other special characters do would do this or how many of those would cause page issues after submission.</p>

Hi Dan,

I just made small commit to my fork, to focus display on your Pears project. As I want to use Pears to show some accessibility snippets I need and want to improve some small accessibility details. You used reset and doubled it by outline: none to links. So I put it back and made it greenish to be nice with your great layout. Check this out, hope you like. If you don't maybe you could just remove outline: none from everywhere, to leave default focus enabled?

All the best!
Dominik

After a couple days of use I felt the difficulty of editing the patterns on the front end without having tab and shift+tab in the text areas so I added it. 

Now you can use LESS and it will compile to css on the fly =)

updated jquery version in use. adding jquery color to help with user
feedback. textarea flashes red for invalid LESS and green for valid.

changed single layout a bit: notes up top, less to left, css to right, html below.
