Could someone please merge the current master in the feature branches (especially the react-intl branch)?
Currently a merge as recommended in https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/blob/master/docs/recipes/how-to-integrate-react-intl.md throws some merge conflicts and I'm not really sure if the other changes are compatible with the current master, which is 104 commits ahead.

First, I am not sure how to exactly add Material UI support.
I added by doing this in client.js
```
<App context={context} insertCss={insertCss}>
        <MuiThemeProvider>
          <CssBaseline />
          {route.component}
        </MuiThemeProvider>
      </App>
```
Please tell whats the right way to integrate material UI. 
Material UI applies styles well when server starts. But at next refresh none of styles defined inside component are applied.  I apply component wise styles using.
```
const useStyles = makeStyles(theme => ({
  root: {
    color: 'red',
  },
})

export function example() {
const classes = useStyles()
return (
<div className={classes.root}> Hello</>
)
}
```
Please help.
I would like to show mapped posts from an API inside the OwlCarousel component (import OwlCarousel from 'react-owl-carousel') the code works just fine, but only outside the OwlCarousel component. Thanks

`renderPost = () => { return this.state.posts ? this.state.posts.map(data => ( <div key={data.id} className="item"> <div className="heading">{data.subject}</div> <div className="content">{data.message}</div> </div> )) : "Loading..."; };`

`render() { return ( <div className="container"> <OwlCarousel className="owl-container owl-theme"> {this.renderPost()} </OwlCarousel> </div> ); }`

The code works only when i put the function outside the OwlCarousel component.

`render() { return ( <div className="container"> {this.renderPost()} </div> ); }`
We've built our app based on this starter kit with redux added. We've done some tweaks over time but it's not too far away from the original setup.

That said, as our app grows (24 routes, lotsa components) it's getting very slow to build and bundle. Adding cache-loader provides some relief but it still feels like I'm swimming through pudding most of the time.

Do you have any advice on where to look? Is it just the size of the project or could it be that I need to investigate our dependencies?
