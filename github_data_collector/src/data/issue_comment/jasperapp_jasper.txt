This patch makes it possible to resize side panes (streams and issues).

Related to #123
I set up a stream that contains PRs from my team that have not yet been reviewed (`review:none`).  The search query I have works as expected on Github, but the stream never removes PRs once they have been reviewed. 
Similar to #120, but in addition to window position and size will also restore maximised window states on Microsoft Windows, full-screen windows on macOS, and delegates responsibility for that to the `electron-window-state` library.
If I set the maximum number of records as lower value, Jasper will delete exceeding old data.
If run the `VACUUM` command, it will keep the DB file to small size.
The default GHE config set `PathPrefix="/api/v3/"`. 

However, when the http request is processed by `path.normalize()`, it adds an extra "/" at the beginning and result to requestPath="ghe.yourcompany.com//api/v3/user". This cause a validation error.

I can make it working by manually remove the leading `"/"` from the config screen step 3. But I think this should be fixed at the code level.

(This could be a duplication of exiting issue around GHE, but I am not sure. so allow me to open a new issue.)
I'd like to use Chrome Canary or Vivaldi instead of Safari.
I wasn't be able to find a solution for this myself.

BTW: The browser painel could be automatically hidden. As we are not using it.

Cheers.
Similar to issue #72, it would be good if Jasper would update itself when labels change on issues.

I added a label to an issue that _should_ make it disappear from a stream (as the stream has `-label:<label I just added>`) but even after a while (and clicking "Load Issues" doesn't seem to help nor restarting streams) the issue is still not showing the tag I added and remains part of the stream.
I'd like to hide the Issues and PRs that merged or closed on the stream specified with the "is: open" query. At present, issues and PRs that have been displayed once remain after merging or closing.

My environment is as below.

* OS: MacOS Mojave 10.14.3
* Jasper Version: 0.7.1


This used to work, it was fixed earlier [here](https://github.com/jasperapp/jasper/issues/11), but there seems to have been a regression. I donâ€™t believe I can filter out the activity using the search syntax, so it would be great to have a fix for this.
