Also what is the difference between https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:software.amazon.awssdk%20AND%20a:ses and https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:software.amazon.awssdk%20AND%20a:sesv2 ? i did not find any mention of this, why only ses has this v2 extension ? other services do not propose it.

Thank you

how can i use sdk to frame capture
A user wrote that they were trying to:

Interact with S3 bucket for transferring files from one directory to another directory in same bucket using Python

**Which AWS services, if known, should this code example use?**

* Amazon S3

**Which AWS SDKs or tools, if known, should this code example use?**

* AWS SDK for Python
The Go dev guide's Lambda examples (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/lambda-go-example-configure-function-for-notification.html) use node.js. They should be in Go as requested by juanignacio@gmail.com.
Feedback from one of our users:

The "Managing ASP.NET Session State with Amazon DynamoDBManaging ASP.NET Session State with Amazon DynamoDB" topic, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/sdk-for-net/v2/developer-guide/dynamodb-session-net-sdk.html, includes information about using DynamoDB to manage session state.

However, using DynamoDB for .Net session state is pretty useless unless you can delete the data. This is session state data which will accumulate very quickly. Expecting someone to roll their own solution for calling DeleteExpiredSessions is overly complicated and doesn't match the hassle-free nature of DynamoDB and this documentation. There is currently no documentation for using Lambda to delete expired sessions either. Better yet, why doesn't AWS.SessionProvider.dll provide a ttl field so that expired sessions will automatically be deleted within 48 hours? The documentation here is incomplete and without an easy way to delete large amounts of expired sessions this should not be implemented in a production environment.

This example would use the following services:

* DynamoDB
* Lambda

This example would be for the following SDK:

* AWS SDK for .NET
