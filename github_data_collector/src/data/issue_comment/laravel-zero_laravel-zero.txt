@pxgamer Do you think you can start work on this? I have collision, larastan ready for laravel 7.
One of the deprecations in PHP 7.4 was to deprecate the computation of invalid characters in base conversion functions. This causes the Logo module test to fail on 7.4 with a notice.

The PHP deprecation notes state:
> Passing invalid characters to base_convert(), bindec(), octdec() and hexdec() will now generate a deprecation notice.

This appears to occur when loading the font in [the Zend Text `Figlet` class](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-text/blob/master/src/Figlet/Figlet.php#L1095), I'm not quite sure if this is an issue with the Zend Text package, or the `big.flf` font pack we provide with Laravel Zero's Logo component.

---

I've now tested using the built in `zend-framework.flf` file that the Zend Text package provides, and the text is successfully output. So I think that this is an issue with the `big.flf` file we provide. I've also now tested a few others. Not sure why there is an issue with `big.flf` specifically. ðŸ¤”
This doesn't seem to be clear, but I think it should be addressed since it's focused on being a console-only version of Laravel. 

What are the speed comparisons with running Laravel Zero compared to running the standard Laravel framework or even Laravel lumen (which already suggests it's super fast)?

There was nothing in the docs on how the self-updater gets the git location. 

When i installed the self update the default search location for the update was `file_get_contents(https://packagist.org/p/....`

How can i point it to the right private github location?
the name in composer.json is the github org. and repo name

Is there something i might be missing in the composer file, or another settings file to set te location?
Hey, 
My laravel-packer command-line tool is working fine but what if I can give an option to the user to set the application name while installing or after installing.

Like currently if you install a packer, then you need to write 'packer' to use this CLI but I want to give functionality to the user so that he/she can use any name like 'pkr' or 'packr' whatever they like.

So it is possible and if yes then how?

Thanks for this awesome framework.
Hello,

I cannot seem to find a way to test if a task output it generated in the tests. I tried searching the issue section of the repo and googling my issue, but I couldn't find any answer that is useful. I hope you could help me out.

As requested hereby a [gist](https://gist.github.com/wotta/bf6aa696a79cf14b01ba82570b2f89cb) with my files.

I hope that somebody can help me to figure this out.
This seems to be out of date with the current version of Laravel Zero.Â 
1. There is no app/DefaultCommand.php. Creating one doesn't work, so I moved it to app/Commands.
2.  "php application rename weather" is deprecated, should be "app:rename"
3. When I ran "php weather", this error occurred: "Symfony\Component\Debug\Exception\FatalThrowableErrorÂ : Class 'NunoMaduro\ZeroFramework\Commands\AbstractCommand' not found"Â 
4. After attempting to adapt to how I think it's supposed work (creating new command called "WeatherCommand", adding zttp use statement), and running "php weather weather" I received this error: " BadMethodCallExceptionÂ : Method App\Commands\WeatherCommand::getContainer does not exist."


I give up.
Hi,
I installed the `barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper` according to recommendations from issue  https://github.com/laravel-zero/laravel-zero/issues/132.
I have dependencies:
```
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1.3",
    "barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper": "^2.6",
    "doctrine/dbal": "^2.9",
    "illuminate/database": "5.8.*",
    "illuminate/view": "^5.8",
    "laravel-zero/framework": "5.8.*"
},
```
When I try run `php <my-app> ide-helper:generate -M`, I got error: `Call to undefined method Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth::guard()`. Detail stderr: https://gist.github.com/Sorbing/803274ff90b84a40af696c349a253469 .
Please tell me can I use ide-helper?
Thanks.
Hello,
I installed laravel scout.
Then followed instructions here:
https://www.algolia.com/doc/framework-integration/laravel/getting-started/installation/

then:
php app-name scout:import
gives me an error
There are no commands defined in the "config" namespace.
Note: When publishing php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Scout\ScoutServiceProvider" nothing happened although I got the message that it was successfully published. Maybe I need to add something in my config/app.php file?
Thanks.

If i run php application app:build application
 

I get the follwing in return:
