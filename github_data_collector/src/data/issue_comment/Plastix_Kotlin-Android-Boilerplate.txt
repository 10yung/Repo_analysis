when i use subscribeWith in kotlin, it called  is not a subtype of Observer<in Any!>!,do you know why?
I like the boilerplate and I plan on basing my app off it, however I have a bottom navigation view with multiple views for my app, so I'd like to see a Fragment example for MVVM. I'm still learning and I fear I will do it wrongly then I end up leaking and only finding out while in production.
