Has anyone heard of this before? Sorry for skipping the template it's super late and I've been banging my head against the wall with this. If nobody has heard of anything I will rewrite this with all the versions and stuff. Basically if there is an error in pug, rather than display it in the console the route will just 404. Thanks

**Pug Version:** 4.0.1

**Node Version:** 11.15.0

Hi, I have a little problem and I will be happy for any help.

## Input Pug
hero.pug
```pug
.hero
  .container
    .hero__container
      +headline('We buys')('headline--white headline--center')
      include ../layouts/layouts
      
      block hero
```

I am trying from another page to use more content. But embedding the structure is not going as it should.
At the same time, if you do not use the include (_include ../layouts/layouts_), everything becomes normal.

page.pug
```pug
...
block main
  include ../../common.blocks/navbar/navbar
  include ../../common.blocks/hero/hero
    prepend hero
      +headline('Another')('headline--white')
      include ../../common.blocks/layouts/layouts
...
```
if need layouts.pug
```pug
section.layouts
  .layouts__left
    +cart('Product 1', 'Qui tempore dolore perferendis inventore impedit nam odio odit corporis totam maxime?', '24', '#0')
    +cart('Product 2', 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit elit adipisicing maxime?', '20', '#0')
    +cart('Product 3', 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Qui tempore dolore perferendis?', '8,5', '#0')
    +cart('Product 4', 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.', '16', '#0')
  .layouts__right
    +cart('Product 5', 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Qui tempore dolore perferendis inventore impedit nam odio odit corporis totam maxime?', '18', '#0')('cart--v')
```

## Expected HTML

```html
...
<div class="hero__container">
  ... headline
  <section class="layouts">
    <div class="layouts__left"> ... </div>
    <div class="layouts__right"> ... </div>
  </section>
  ... headline
  <section class="layouts">
    <div class="layouts__left"> ... </div>
    <div class="layouts__right"> ... </div>
  </section>
</div>
...
```

Instead of expected behavior, all content is embedded in layouts__right

## Actual HTML

```html
...
<div class="hero__container">
  ... headline
  <section class="layouts">
    <div class="layouts__left"> ... </div>
    <div class="layouts__right">
      ... headline
      <section class="layouts">
        <div class="layouts__left"> ... </div>
        <div class="layouts__right"> ... </div>
      </section>
    </div>
  </section>
</div>
...
```

Thanks.

Dependency Hierarchy:

ctorName in index.js in kind-of v6.0.2 allows external user input to overwrite certain internal attributes via a conflicting name, as demonstrated by 'constructor': {'name':'Symbol'}. Hence, a crafted payload can overwrite this builtin attribute to manipulate the type detection result.

**Pug Version:** 2.0.4
**Node Version:** v12.13.1

In my attempt to do housekeeping for pug, when trying to upgrade package `with` to the latest version, I found an issue in pug-lexer tests.  More specifically, pug-lexer's dependency,  as of acorn version 6.0.0, acorn walker has been separated into a standalone npm package called acorn-walk.  This is documented at https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/blob/master/acorn/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes-1

I have created a PR to fix the issue: https://github.com/pugjs/pug/pull/3201


Side note: the reason package `with` in pug-code-gen couldn't be upgraded to the latest version, turned out to be the helpfulness of the older version of `with` by installing an older version of acorn that would supply `acorn/dist/walk` to pug-lexer's tests.  Once the pug-lexer test is fixed to use acorn-walk, then `with` in pug-code-gen could be upgraded to its latest version, eliminating one more out of date dependency.  I can add the `with` upgrade to the above PR as well.  Let me know.


This is to address the breaking change documented at https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/blob/master/acorn/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes-1

As of Acorn 6.0.0, acorn walk module has been split into a separate npm package.

**Pug Version:** 2.0.4

**Node Version:** v10.15.0

Once I added Pug to my project, Github started to complain about a vulnerability in a dependency.
```
└─┬ pug@2.0.4
  ├─┬ pug-code-gen@2.0.2
  │ ├─┬ constantinople@3.1.2

  │ │ ├── constantinople@3.0.2 deduped
  ├─┬ pug-filters@3.1.1
  │ ├─┬ constantinople@3.0.2
```
Github suggests to use: `"constantinople": ">=3.1.1"`
closes #3173
