I’m using SVSegmentedControl in our app and we’d like to have the text for the non-selected or non-active position be semi-opaque. I’ve really tried for a long time to figure this out without success. Would you be willing to provide any direction on setting the opacity on the non-active label? 

Includes #65, #66, #67, #71 and #74 among others.

Currently distributed as separate `SVSegmentedControl@PTEz` pod.

...the header files with xcode doxygen-like comments

You may want to change the image on the Github page to include a new flat switch, if you so desire.

Dear Sir,

I am considering using your (excellent) SVSegmentedControl in one of my iPhone apps, along with the appropriate attribution (of course).  I am having difficulty, however, setting all segments to the OFF state, something like this:

```
[mySVSegmentedControl setSelectedSegmentIndex: UISegmentedControlNoSegment]
```

or even:

```
[mySVSegmentedControl setSelectedSegmentIndex: -1]
```

Your code does not seem to allow this (exception error, plus segment index is NSUInteger (unsigned integer)).  Is it possible to get around this?

Please advise.

Best regards,
R. Preston

@samvermette noticed that this hasn't been very active lately. If you don't have time to maintain it I'm happy to help. However I've diverged a bit in my fork (flat UI etc): https://github.com/zodio/SVSegmentedControl. Any thoughts on how to keep this going?

Thanks

I want to increase the numberOfLines for the title. If the segmented control height is 48 & restricted width , then how can I make the title to spread over two lines.
Please help.

textShadowColor is not well, if have images
