Encrypt and Decrypt the response string from and display it on the Encrytion Tab
Hi, I'd like to ask for opinion.
I'm currently using Xcode 10.1 with minimum version of iOS 8 and currently on swift 4.2
I notice that since April 2019, this library has set the minimum iOS to iOS 9.
Is there any option for me to keep using this library and maintain the minimum version of iOS ?

Thanks for your help :)

there is a exmple  https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html  .
.swift-version file won't work if netfox nested in anther pod. 
I am trying to build my application on `AppCenter` but getting this error:
```
error: /Users/runner/runners/2.163.1/work/1/s/Pods/Target Support Files/netfox/netfox.xcconfig: unable to open file (in target "netfox" in project "Pods") (in target 'netfox' from project 'Pods')

```

I have used both:
`pod 'netfox'`
and
`pod 'netfox', :configurations => ['Debug', 'Release']`
but still getting the error.

I have also tried both Xcode 11.2.1 and 11.3 versions but still getting the error.
First of all, thank you all for your efforts in this library. It's a need for every platform. 

As a feature request, it could be nice if this library supports tvOS. I'm not sure why it's not supporting because there is no complicated UI in the library. Most of the jobs are handled by the Foundation API. 

Best.

Steps to reproduce:
- Shake to open log view
- Press settings button to open settings screen
- If you shake screen in settings view log screen will be pushed again
- Go back to log view
- If you shake screen in log view log screen will be pushed again

If you don't go to settings, shaking will hide the log view.

Platform: iOS 13
I ahve just installed lates `Debug` config with `CocoaPods`:

`pod 'netfox', :configurations => ['Debug']`

After navigating to settings screen close button doesn't work.
In our app we are listing documents directory for user that he can pick some of file saved there.
Using netfox is causing that we are displaying session files saved by netfox.
That's why I've prepared small PR that is saving netfox files inside temporary directory
I have ran across an interesting problem in an app that has Netfox integrated.

When I implement the following method from the `URLSessionDataDelegate` protocol, the `Netfox`'s implementation of `URLProtocol` will make the request hang until the `timeoutInterval` is reached and then it's reported as a timeout, even though the request is actually made.

What's interesting is that it only hangs if I call the completion handler with `nil` as a means to not allow the redirect. If I call it with the `newRequest`, everything works as expected.

```
    func urlSession(_ session: URLSession, task: URLSessionTask, willPerformHTTPRedirection response: HTTPURLResponse, newRequest request: URLRequest, completionHandler: @escaping (URLRequest?) -> Void) {
        completionHandler(nil) // if redirect is allowed, everything works
    }
```
I've faced with a problem that some API request fail with **The request timed out** error. I don't know the reason, but some requests also take longer than usual. For me, this only appears on iOS 11 and works fine on versions above.

If you use Firebase analytics it also fails:
```
 6.9.0 - [Firebase/Analytics][I-ACS901017] Encounter network error. Code, error: -1001, Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1001 "The request timed out."
