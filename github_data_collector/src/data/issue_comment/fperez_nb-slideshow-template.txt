Hi Fernando,

First of all, thank you so much for the great work!

I was trying to run the `install-support.ipynb`, but got this error:

```
fatal: destination path 'X:\WinPython3\settings\.ipython\profile_default\static\custom' already exists and is not an empty directory.
```

Basically because 1) I need to use IPython Notebook to run the .ipynb file, and 2) whenever I start the ipython notebook, the folder `static\custom` got created and is non-empty.

Could you please help?

Thanks!

Shawn
