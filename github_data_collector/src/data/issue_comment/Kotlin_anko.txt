Gradle doesn't resolve these for 0.10.8:
 
            anko_sdk                   : "org.jetbrains.anko:anko-sdk28:${ver.anko}",
            anko_sdk_listeners   : "org.jetbrains.anko:anko-sdk28-listeners:${ver.anko}",

Works fine if I use sdk27.  I have jcenter, google, and jitpack.io as my current declared repos. 

Any suggestions? Thanks!
I can just set (title,items,onClick) three params,I need to know the callback when the selector is canceled,what should I do without implement alertBuildFactory?
Jetbrains repository server does not works and dependencies updating fails with error:
```
BUILD FAILED
P:\android\projects\anko\anko-jetbrains-alt\update_dependencies.xml:29: The following error occurred while executing this line:
P:\android\projects\anko\anko-jetbrains-alt\update_dependencies_idea.xml:141: The following error occurred while executing this line:

```
So this way the repository server url was replaced by maven
Avoids listeners with generics like [AppBarLayout.BaseOnOffsetChangedListener](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/appbar/AppBarLayout.BaseOnOffsetChangedListener.html) in material desing library

Current signature parser could not properly process generics and throws 
 ``` java.lang.IllegalStateException: Invalid classifier type: TypeVariable(name=T) ```

After fix we will be skipping these listeners
Add `dp()` functions to convert `dp` more easily.
For use listeners add **implementation "org.jetbrains.anko:anko-sdk25-listeners:0.10.8"** in build.gradle

I've used this project and it's great, but I won't write new code using it.  Good luck to you if you do.
`inline fun <T: View> Context.include(layoutId: Int, init: (@AnkoViewDslMarker T).() -> Unit): T {
    @Suppress("UNCHECKED_CAST")
    return ankoView({ ctx -> ctx.layoutInflater.inflate(layoutId, null) as T }, 0) { init() }
}
inline fun <T: View> Activity.include(layoutId: Int, init: (@AnkoViewDslMarker T).() -> Unit): T {
    @Suppress("UNCHECKED_CAST")
    return ankoView({ ctx -> ctx.layoutInflater.inflate(layoutId, null) as T }, 0) { init() }
}
`
I use include to help me of inflating View in custom view, and recyclerView's item ,but some times is not simplyï¼Œ for example:
when i want to inflate an RecyclerView item, i will call Inflater.from.inflate(R.layout.xxxx,parents, false);
when i want to just create a View, i will call Inflater.from.inflate(R.layout.xxx, null, false);
when i want to create a custom View,i will call Inflter.from.inflate(R.layout.xxx, this, true);

but anko not support to put the enough parameters to select.

also:
i want to create a Linearlayout by anko in activity, but don't set it to ContentView ,I can't call Activity.include instead of Context.include,   so i must force convert 'Activity' to 'Context', that makes me entangled

If I use 
    `text = "I want new line.\nHere is the new line."`
this is printing as 
"I want new line.
Here is the new line."

but if I use 
    `textResource = R.string.newline`
this is printing as 
"I want new line.\nHere is the new line."


As per the responses and updates, the project seems to be discontinued.
It would have been great if they announced it officially and/or mark the repository as deprecated, this would make us clear to architect/migrate our project on other UI platforms.
