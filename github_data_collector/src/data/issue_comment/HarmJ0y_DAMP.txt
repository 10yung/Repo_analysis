Please add a 'remove options' to the Add-RemoteRegBackdoor.ps1 script, so that we can do cleanup when we are doing abusing the feature (e.g. at the end of a redteam mission).

Also just curious, for the SID can you use a computer account or would it only work for a user sid? id rather not tie the access to a domain account if i can help it (computer account seems more stealthy and also easier to share).
Where are all the rest of the powershell scripts from the talk?

On Windows 10, the `Decrypt-AES` and `Decrypt-Byte` functions have an `IV` parameter that conflict with an alias name of the parameter `InformationVariable`:

```
Decrypt-AES : The parameter 'IV' cannot be specified because it conflicts with the parameter alias of the same 
name for parameter 'InformationVariable'.
At C:\Users\user\Documents\RemoteHashRetrieval.ps1:1282 char:30
+     $LSAKeyStructPlaintext = Decrypt-AES -Key $TmpKey -CipherText $LS ...
+                              ~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : MetadataError: (:) [], MetadataException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : ParameterNameConflictsWithAlias
```
Changing the `IV` parameter to `InitializationVector` fixes the bug.
Hi @harmj0y,
Think I found a tiny bug so proposing a quick fix 
(and added pipeline support for multiple objects while I was at it...)
Really cool stuff as usual. 
THX
