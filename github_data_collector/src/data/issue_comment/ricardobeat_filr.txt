This pull request changes the value of the license property in `package.json` to a standard, machine-readable SPDX license identifier.

I'll be honest: This is a semi-automated pull request. I started by using [dat](http://dat-data.com/) to review metadata for all packages on [npm](http://npmjs.com), looking for packages updated sometime in the last year that don't use a valid [SPDX license identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/) in `package.json`. I used my own npm module, [spdx-correct](https://github.com/kemitchell/spdx-correct.js) to guess what license you were after, [`"MIT"`](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). A quick manual check and a few shell scripts later, and this pull request was born.

npm doesn't require that you use a valid SPDX identifier, but it's strongly recommended. (Try `npm help 7 package.json` and search for “License”.) Other source code package managers, like Maven for Java and RubyGems for Ruby, recommend the same. 

Why care about SPDX? A machine-readable standard makes it possible for programs, rather than just people, to review a module or even an entire codebase to make sure that licenses are compatible. Whatever the reason—strong personal conviction, company policy, terms of a business deal—SPDX makes it easier to collaborate with others when licenses can be a problem, and helps take open-source software to more places. Given that [npm has a ton of modules](http://www.modulecounts.com/) but also handles dependencies in a novel way, I think a little license hygiene could help npm build amazing new relationships between communities that lawyers have long kept apart.

Though this PR was semi-automatic, my responses to any questions you have won't be. I can't give legal advice over GitHub, but I'm happy to answer questions about SPDX or point you to good resources on related problems.

Thanks for your contribution to open-source software!

Just installed for first time, never had this working before.  First test was to upload a jpg, but received an error saying 'SSL is required'.

```
$ filr candm.jpg 
Uploading candm.jpg...
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<rsp stat="fail">
    <err code="95" msg="SSL is required" />
</rsp>

Error uploading file.
```

Is this something I'm doing wrong on my end, did flickr change their interface, or is it something wrong with filr?

Thanks for the help,

you could store meta data ( file name/s and type in the exif ) jpg essentially being a zip file anyway , also you could have a actual image of what the file represents, say a picture of the radiohead album or whatever :)
