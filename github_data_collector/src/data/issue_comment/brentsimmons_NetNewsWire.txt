When an embedded video is playing and the NetNewsWire window is closed (not closing the app, just the window) the audio continues to play in the background. My expectation as a user is that the audio would not continue to play. 

To reproduce in version 5.0.3 (2618): 

- Begin playback of an embedded video file ("About that Easy Pay Video" from http://feedpress.me/512pixels)
- Close NetNewsWire window (cmd+w)
In `FeedlyEntry` and similar, we should use let as often as possible instead of var.
Preferably, make it useful or burn it.
If an item points to a PDF file rather than a web page it fails to load in reader view.  It wold be great if a pdf is detected it is just loaded and displayed rather than failing.

 This is related to #1542, which prevents PDF items from being available at all if auto reader view is on. 
Following this slack conversation: https://netnewswire.slack.com/archives/CPNED2D7Y/p1578781781063200 

We can implement a deeplink handler for most common occurrences of services that have an iOS app and are linked to in articles. 
The slack conversation mentions Twitter, I think YouTube is also a good candidate for the initial phase. 

For every service there should be a resolver that knows how to remap a url into a deeplink. 
For example, the Twitter one will remap `https://twitter.com/pschiller/status/1194616375681015809` into `
twitter://status?id=1194616375681015809`.

A feature flag should control wether we will deeplink into the app or just present SFSafariViewController. 
For services with multiple popular apps, like Twitter, Maps, Reddit, we can include a setting for preferred option. 

Most of the code should be in the `Shared` folder, as it can be easily reused between platforms. Each platform should on its own decide what to do with the resolved URL. 

I'll pick this up for its initial phase. Let me know if you have any remarks. 
To do after 5.0 ships.
The lines that show up on a empty feed have spacing that doesn't match the spacing when there are items in the list.  (The line spacing doesn't match any timeline layout size that I can see.). Example:

If an item is both unread and starred, only the star is shown.  Both tags should be shown in that case.  In lists it appears that there's enough room for both icons to appear on the left side, one above the other.  

Alternatively, the yellow star and blue circle could be stacked to show both tags.  This approach could be extended if additional tags are added later, as is done in the Finder
It would be great to have a number next to the Starred smart playlist entry showing how many items are in that list.  It would make sense to me for that indicator to be a number bubble but in yellow instead of blue or grey.
