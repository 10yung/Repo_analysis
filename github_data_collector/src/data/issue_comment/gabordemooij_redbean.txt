Just an idea: optionally create indexes when using R::findLike() to put indexes on the criteria fields.
Allow multiple parameters for R::bindFunc, or just allow a plain SQL snippet like SHA1( ? ) instead of just SHA1. We might just scan for a '?' to determine if the function needs to be processed or not.
Hi might not be the right place.

But trying to understand RedBeanPHP, one thing i can't figure out tho, if i use the ownLists.

Is there anyway with find to only get ownEntrys with a specific value, ex, let's say i did a layout like this

Username
Birthdate
ownInfo - > ownInfo.age - > ownInfo.location

And i only want to get beans where the age is let's say 30, is there any way to do this with redbean, or do i have to get a list from the ownInfo table and then use ex the user_id to get the rest of the data?
