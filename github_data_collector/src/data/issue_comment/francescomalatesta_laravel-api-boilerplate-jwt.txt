Can't login to nova, not getting any errors just refreshes the page
Hi everyone....

I am facing the an issue when I am trying to do a password reset. I am passing the required parameters in postman body. Upon tracing, I have found that when API is called in response it gets **password.passwords** instead of getting **password.reset**. and at the end hits **throw new HttpException(500);** . I am following all the steps but it seems that something is missing would really appreciate any help on this one.. .
