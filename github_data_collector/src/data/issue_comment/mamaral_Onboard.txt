In my project, the images didn't fill the entire screen, leaving 64 gaps at the top of the screen



I want to do every page have their own background .. how ?

As the title,, how to disable the onboardingViewController`s bounce when scroll to the end page .
Is there any way I could get accedd to imageView that holds background image to change its content mode?
I wanted to know how can I open an Onboard screen using a UIButton for example in storyboard?

Thanks
How to add multiple action buttons?
Using Onboard I saw that skip button text was not vertically centralized in the page control as in the bellow image.

after some digging I could see it is because PageController and SkipButton does not have the same height as you can see bellow.
