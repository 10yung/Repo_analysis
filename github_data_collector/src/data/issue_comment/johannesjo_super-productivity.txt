Repeated tasks are limited to the day of week, but there is no reminder for the specific time. Pomodoro only allows duration based reminder. It would be nice to have an alarm clock-like feature for repeated tasks.
Hello, I noticed the following behavior:
**Fist suggestion:** When I mark as done my task and save the work log to Jira, the task goes to the done list.If i pull the task back up again to work on it, the work time should be reset to 0 but it continues from where it was left. It would be easier to manage the working sessions on that task. Also when i want to finish the task by using this approach the Started day of work should be changed to the current day. (If it is not clear I can provide more info).

**Second suggestion:** Also it would be a nice feature if you finish a task and move it to review, or done you should set the Remaining Time on the task in jira to 0.


Hi!

I could not find a setting that's quite common in similar apps - custom day end hour. For now it counts a day as finished based on 00:00 to 23:59 I quess. 

My schedule is shifted forward in time, I wake up late and go to bed late, so my "day" is more like starts at 13:00 and ends at 04:00 roughly. This messes app's calculations up, as it starts counting time towards the next astrological day, though logically I'd like it to count it to my current 'logical' day, if that makes sense

When I start tracking time for a task when the language is set to English. then go to edit the time spent on that task from additional info.
A list of the days that I worked in shows except for the date of the day we are in. (That's the right behavior)
That should happen even if I change the language to Arabic.
and vice versa. 

### Current Behavior
<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->
<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->
The list of days shows the date of the day we are in.
That happens when The language selected is Arabic and the time tracing started while the language is English and vice versa.

1. Select the English language.
2. Create a task in any project.

There is no output

**THE CASE**
I noticed that to get the app to log you work time you have to mark the task as done.
Sometimes there are tasks that take more than one day to finish because of poor planning. 
Therefore i suggest that the app can log you work automatically in Jira after you hit the Finish Day button.(I noticed that it doesn't do this now)
It would be a very helpful feature.

If needed I can help on this topic. Thank you for the great software and making things easier for all of us!

After I fill in my credentials I click test credentials and I receive the message Login successful! Welcome {{user}}! that seems a bit weird.
I am using **Jira v7.0.11 in an offline environment (server)**, because the API may differ from version to version.
I run in Jira the JQL and indeed it is getting al of my issues. But when using the app at this method: mapToSearchResult, in jira-issue-map.util.ts the res.response is a html page containing the title, Board-JIRA, meta data, and all of jira plugins (looks like it's getting Jira's first page)
Also i ran debug on jira and couldn't seem to get any network trace of the app calling jira but no traffic was detected when searching for issues, maybe this would help me debug the process.
I can't seem to find any network traffic in the console, but i get the following message when i try searching for a task: "To prevent shut out from api, access has been blocked by Super Productivity. You should probably check you jira setting!"

### This is a separate problem that could be connected
Also when i try to press CTRL+SHIFT+J it says TypeError: Cannot read property 'send' of undefined.
The output on this one is TypeError: "Cannot read property 'send' of undefined"

How does one end the day and still get the tasks on the next day that one marked as repetitive? When I finish the day the list goes blank.
Snap! A critical error occurred...

I totally dig the new task menu (for scheduling tasks, editing notes and attachments and setting up repeatable tasks :heart: ). However, I can't find a way to add sub tasks anymore. Is this on purpose?
### Current Behavior

Currently, when selecting a Primary Color for a project, some colors will keep the background of the application white, but others will give it some colorisation with a fade effect.

I find the background color very distracting and out of line from what I expect in an application. I end up using very pale colors as the project's primary color to avoid this issue.

### Expected Behavior

My expectation is to have a a checkbox on the project's theme tab where I can select between automatic background color or white (or dark-grey if using dark mode).

Thanks!
