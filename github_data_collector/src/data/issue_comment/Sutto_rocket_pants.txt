In `kaminari 1.0` they removed method deprecated `num_pages` in favor of `total_pages`. Issue: #148 
Is it planned to add support for rails 5?
Hi. a new version of `Kaminari` was released recently and looks like something is broken now. `pagination` section is missing, `kaminari_spec.rb` fails now. 
Hi, can someone add support for [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/)?

Thanks!

The latest commit on the `master` branch is dated September 22, 2015, while the latest commit on the `2.0-rewrite` branch is dated December 15, 2013.

I hate to be _that_ guy, but is RocketPants still being maintained? I'm not using it much anymore, but I still have some projects that depend on it and I'd love to know what the future of this gem is.

Much :heart: either way.

NOTE: Hence Rails 5 expects locale path as Rails::Paths::Path. So, we
should be using config.i18n.load_path to load locale files.

Is it ok to use RokectPants with the project generated by rails-api new?
I also wonder even if I can use it with rails-api, it might not be a good idea needs a lot of tweaks.

Made a few changes to make RocketPants support Rails 5. 

Hello!
I can see that rocket_pants returns a json object which is built from `model.errors`. Is there any way to also include response of `model.errors.full_messages` in the same response?

Thanks in advance
