Just wanted to let you folks know, you have all done some amazing work and I want to thank you for your contributions to this project. I don't know what happened back in January, and I can't easily explain the 'mysterious things that have seemed to happen since then...' but I'm willing to provide and share what I have been relentlessly developing.

I studied a lot of Michael's scripts in addition to the scripts here on Master... my goal was to create an installation utility that works without needing to use the MDT GUI. I managed to do that, and included AD integration / WG selection, credentials testing and validation, registry creation, recursion, enabling multiple deployment shares, including details in the GUI I put together to compile a live working version of BITS with either standard MDT or the PSD Master.

I've emailed Mr. Niehaus a few times, and though I'm certain he's on the cuff about what I've done or continue to do...

I've thrown everything I could think of at this process I'm now sharing.

I'm sure there's quite a bit that I didn't do right... I'm certain I may have even upset some people with the level I went to make a point, or to create this... Seems to be a recurring theme in my life or in general. Fact of the matter is...

I'm out of steam. And frankly ? I feel as if I'm much less fighting entropy and much more just fighting myself at this point. Sort of falls under 'diminishing returns'... and I could use some help.

I hope the principle of what I managed to do is what matters most.

Double-clicking on a Task Sequence in the PSD Wizard, creates duplicate entries nested below the selected Task Sequence.

If a space is present in the path of the MDT installer file, the resulting arguments being passed to MSIEXEC.EXE will not be correct and will prompt the following:

Removing the space from the path allows the installer to install MDT.


Fixed/Standardized capitalization, spelling errors, punctuation, and grammar.(Comments, Log/Verbose Messages)

Reworded some phrases for clarity.

Expanded cmdlet aliases for readability (dir > Get-ChildItem, where > Where-Object, foreach > ForEach-Object)

Worked through all files except for scripts folder.

The Write-PSDInstallLog -Message on line 688 of the New-PSDWebInstance.ps1 file refers to "now exiting" 

elsewhere this phrase precedes a break command, but here there is none. 

I don't know enough about what's going on to figure out if the log output is incorrect or if there is a missing break. 


The user is able to hit the OK button to start the imaging process on the TS Selection pane, even if the user hasn't selected a Task Sequence. This results in the process failing. The image attached shows the error

While WinPE looks to see if the missing files from ADK 1809 are missing, would it be an easy fix to have those files auto added by the hydration kit if it detects ADK 1809? If not, could we get a URL to the file location to make the user's life a touch easier?

If you leave off the .ISO file extension in the hydration pack, the installer cannot find the file and throws errors but does not cause the script to fail.
If there is an existing ADK installation left running in the background, the ADK installer throws a 1618 error, which causes the hydration script to fail.
There is an error In ADK and ADKPE detection

Here two functions works in FR-FR and en-US OsCulture
