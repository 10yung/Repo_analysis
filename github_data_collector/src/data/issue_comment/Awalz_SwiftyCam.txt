I am having issues using the shouldUseDeviceOrientation = true property when on a flat surface.   

It works fine if I hold the camera up and respects portrait or landscape, but when I take a pic of a flat horizontal surface, I can't rely on the image being the correct orientation.  

Would be great if I could simply pass a value when I know the orientation I want.  
I am using this SDK and getting an error in the status bar. 
Here is the details and video link.

- migrated to swift 5
- Changes iOS build target to 10
- Compiles for Swift 5 

Working and compiling using Swift 5. If you are interested in merging this to master, I can fix the conflicts. Thanks,

When opening up the camera, audio from bluetooth headphones lowers to a weird lower, and lesser quality volume.  Sometimes it just cuts off. Once the camera closes, the audio sometimes returns back to it's normal volume.

I tried messing around with AVAudioSession.CategoryOptions for iOS 10+ but can't seem to get  the settings right.

Has anyone else tried opening the camera while listening to music using bluetooth headphones and noticed this?
Hello guys, thank you for your work. Is it possible to compile your pod for Swift 5 because i'm blocked with the new Xcode :/ Thank you very much
