Also in VSCode (latest, not Insiders) that line of code is highlighted differently once rendered from Markdown, I think it's ok to expect some differences since my editor has a dark background and the rendered Markdown has a light background, but here a method's name is no longer of a different color as far as I can see, and that seems a bit too much of a difference:

In visual studio code it is possible to attach an xsd to your xml file for autocompletion.
I noticed that this feature is not available in the monaco-editor. Therefore I would like to make a feature request for autocompletion based on an xsd schema.

visual studio code examples:

It would help me out a lot if you could implement this feature into the monaco-editor.

Basically some import statements in Python aren't highlighted properly.

Please include `/node_modules/` in `.gitignore` for the samples that have a `.gitignore` file, as appropriate.

After I copy the sample into my own repository and run `yarn install`, if I didn't check before running `git add .`, I would have added everything under `node_modules/`.
Hello.

I have modified the package.json file in the [example](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor-samples/tree/master/nwjs-amd) so that the workers run in the context of nodejs. I need this change because I have other workers that handle datagram sockets (dgram lib).

Is it possible to load Monaco Editor with this option in nwjs?

Thanks in advance.

Hi,
I tried to remove the tooltip that says 'cannot edit in a read-only editor using CSS. But, it seems that the CSS although applied is not working.

Given below is the screenshot of the issue that I am facing:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20411595/71613806-64a4ca00-2bce-11ea-9e8e-e7912a33e2f6.png)


Below given is the editor options that I am setting

`value: this.configOriginal,
    language: 'json',
    theme: this.theme,
    scrollBeyondLastLine: false,
    contextmenu: false,
    readOnly: true,
    cursorWidth: 0,`

And given below is the CSS that I am trying to use to hide the tooltip:
`.monaco-alert {
  display: none !important;
  visibility: hidden !important;
}`

Can anyone please help me solve this? I have been struggling with this since a long time.

Thank you so much.
