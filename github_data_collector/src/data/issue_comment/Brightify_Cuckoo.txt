I've been trying to use Cuckoo on a tvOS project with Carthage, and noticed there wasn't a tvOS target, so I created them based on their iOS counterparts, changing only a few settings to their tvOS specifics, such as the base SDK and supported platforms.

Related to https://github.com/Brightify/Cuckoo/issues/321
Hi all,

My team wants to slowly integrate the Cuckoo framework into our project for generating mocks. We want to support tests that still use our own mocks and new / refactored tests that use Cuckoo mocks. The problem we are facing is that there are conflicts between mocks we wrote ourselves and mocks that Cuckoo generates e.g. same classname for the mocks and it also reduces readability because itâ€™s not immediately obvious if you are working with Cuckoo mocks or not. 
Is it possible / is there a way to add a prefix to the classnames of the generated mocks e.g. generating a mock for protocol Abc will generate CuckooMockAbc / CKMockAbc?

Thanks in advance!
To reset all Mocks without specifying Mock instance.
I think this is what was meant? The double negative threw me

I am using Xcode 11.1 and swift 5. 
Mac - 10.14.6 Mojave

I am using Cuckoo "1.1.1" and I start getting below error. I resolved the error using suggestion but once you build it will show again.

<img width="480" alt="Screenshot 2019-10-22 at 4 55 23 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40563563/67281473-18ae1880-f4ed-11e9-9167-085fd571463c.png">

2- One more issue is:

**Value of type 'Class' has no member 'function':**  even though function has the internal access level. 


If anybody else facing same issue? please help.
