I get this error always:

```
Unexpected error while processing request: Content-Length header was 1747, but should be 1757
/Users/alexd/.rbenv/versions/2.1.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.1.0/gems/rack-1.5.2/lib/rack/lint.rb:631:in `verify_content_length'
```

If my post is very small, I get it with some types of characters like `"` but they are all UTF-8 plain text. 

When I fix all the character issues, I still get the error when trying to display the whole post. 

toto doesn't work with ruby 1.9+ but it fixed in the repo but not published. Particularly this [line](https://github.com/cloudhead/toto/blob/master/lib/toto.rb#L341). @cloudhead it shouldn't take more than a minute to publish

Hi,
Great repo! I couldn't find anywhere in toto.rb where a 304(Not-Modified) header was being sent -- this is to take advantage of HTTP Caching. Just wondering if it's being done some place else.

Thanks
Santosh

hi.pls see below.how to fix the issue?

as3:~# cd toto-blog
as3:~/toto-blog# ls
articles  config.ru  public  Rakefile  README  templates
as3:~/toto-blog# thin start -R config.ru
config.ru:2:in `require': no such file to load -- toto (LoadError)

Hello,

I don't know if this counts as an issue, but I can get dorothy to work fine on localhost:3000 using thin, but when I set it up using heroku (following all available tutorials that make it look so simple) I get this: 
http://spatablog.herokuapp.com/

Internal Server Error
(<unknown>): could not find expected ':' while scanning a simple key at line 5 column 1
WEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/2.0.0/2013-06-27) at spatablog.herokuapp.com:8

I think it is a Rakefile issue(even though the error says unknown, all similar errors on google seem to be rake-related), but I have made no changes to it. I have tried cloning dorothy multiple times.

But here is the begining of the Rakefile anyways:
require 'toto'

@config = Toto::Config::Defaults

task :default => :new

desc "Create a new article."
task :new do
  title = ask('Title: ')
  slug = title.empty?? nil : title.strip.slugize

  article = {'title' => title, 'date' => Time.now.strftime("%d/%m/%Y")}.to_yaml
  article << "\n"
  article << "Once upon a time...\n\n"

...and so on

I want this to work and I don't know what to do because I am new to ruby and heroku.

UPDATE:

I found out that it works the first time. So it is only after I push any changes that this happens. I still don't know what could be wrong though :/

Please help!

Steph

Could you please maintain this repository, or transfer it to someone else? Last commit is an year ago..

I don't know what smart-mode does, it's not documented (even link to documentation could be helpful)

I really like toto's simplicity and approach, but I want to use it for non-blog sites - e.g. just a bunch of static pages, usually hierarchically arranged.  The biggest issue I think would be having custom URLs without having to require dates as part of the path.

Are there any features / forks which support this?

I found the following issue, but it got closed a long time about with no action:

This change should allow partials to be rendered using syntax like:

```
<%= render 'sidebar', :partial %>
```
