Backport of IBUS protocol changes already implemented in BF.

The PR created on request of FlySky - they want to have receivers compatible.

New FlySky receivers (AFHDS 3 and latest AFHDS 2a) are using 4 bits free bits in every channel to pass additional data, thus increase total passed channels to 18.
Missing logic has been implemented - it is still compatible with 14 channels receivers.

The fix is critical because if new channels are being send in the frame they are causing invalid value recognition.
Information about change I got from first hand - talked directly to FlySky.

Hello, i can't set "PWM RX INPUT" in betaflight, i set it but when i restart it reset "PPM RX".Why this?
2.5.0 and 2.5.0 RC1 version dont working on CC3D, v2.4.0 is working and flashing, but if im flashing v2.5, i have only green led after and no USB device.
im using configurator v2.5.0
# A - Description

This is a feature or enhancement request to add a new serial RX protocol. This would be to enable the Yuneec Serial protocol allowing people to use their commercial Yuneec ST16, ST24 and/or ST10(?) radios with cleanflight based DIY drones. 

While this is probably a relatively small group of people who want to do that, I also think this feature would be fairly easy to add because there is already existing code for the protocol for the PX4 firmware (see the ST24 source code here: https://subak.io/code/ardupilot/ArduCopter-3.5/modules/PX4Firmware/src/lib/rc/).

I know the code works to get RX channel data from the yuneec rx because I used that code linked above as an arduino library and programmed a esp8266 to convert the output from that channel data into PPM. It would be nice to not have to have an additional microcontroller to interface the Yuneec RX to a Cleanflight compatible FC.

When the multicopter is armed and take off to flight and move the sticks of aileron or elevator too fast or agreesive position, and the drone starts move, but in this time the board disarme and you have to turn off the switch and re-arm again.

1 - Arm the quadcopter.
2 - Take off.
3 - Move the sticks of aileron or elevator too fast.
4 - when the drone calculates the angular motion he desarm.
5 - It only occurs when the gyro calculate the angular motion. If you move the sticks of controller
and hold the drone it looks fine.

List of parts:
SP Racing F3 Deluxe. (FC)
Firmware - Cleanflight 2.5
ESC - Sky RC 12a
Receiver - FlySky i6 mode PPM
Motors: 2300kv GOOLRC

Standard settings. Loop time and Gyro 

Observation. If the Super rate is 0.70 up. Cause this issue.
In Betaflight 3.5.7 is the same problem!!!!

Hello,

When ı flash the stabil hex from git to SPRACINGF3 board, everything work well. But when ı flash hex file created by cygwing, the configurator gives the following error;

2019-02-10 @ 20:27:43 -- Serial port successfully opened with ID: 24

2019-02-10 @ 20:27:45 -- MultiWii API version: 1.40.0

2019-02-10 @ 20:27:53 -- No configuration received within 10 seconds, communication failed

2019-02-10 @ 20:27:53 -- Serial port successfully closed

Edit1: Betaflight is working well when build with cygwin and connects to betaflight configurator, but cleanflight does not connect.

Using the latest 2.5.0 Cleanflight firmware and SPRACINGF3 deluxe board, I want to be able to enable the ALT hold (BARO) mode. But it is not listed in MODES tab.
However when I go to SENSORS tab, the barometer values are logged correctly...
Do I need to enable it via the CLI command? Or how do I do it?
