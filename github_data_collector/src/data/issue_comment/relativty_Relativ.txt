In Arduino IDE, when trying to compile the code, and error message, "min was not declared in this scope" pops up. Any Solution?

The Full Error Messages:

As the result of living in China, I can't connect relativty.net for more detail to build this great project.
Could you please post the content in that web site on github ?
Does this headset support Asynchronous Timewarp (Reprojection)?
Hello, trying to compile the sketch I get the following error:


**************************************

main:133:9: error: 'VectorFloat16' was not declared in this scope

         VectorFloat16 down;

         ^

main:134:28: error: 'down' was not declared in this scope

         mpu.dmpGetGravity(&down, &q);

                            ^

exit status 1
'VectorFloat16' was not declared in this scope

How can I correct it?

Thanks, regards
Following the **Microsoft Compiler Warning (level 4) C4239**

The **relativ_osvr_plugin/Relativ_OSVR_Plugin.cpp** code fails to compile on any OS except Windows with this error:
```error: cannot bind non-const lvalue reference of type ‘serial::Timeout&’ to an rvalue of type ‘serial::Timeout’ ```

To resolve this, **Кзобьтовскый** created this fix:

 ``` 
Line 57
relativ.setTimeout(serial::Timeout::simpleTimeout(1000)); 
```

replace the whole of Line 57 with this:

```
serial::Timeout sto = serial::Timeout::simpleTimeout(1000);
relativ.setTimeout(sto);
```
