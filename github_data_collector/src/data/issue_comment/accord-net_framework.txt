This line in code seems to yield index-out-of-range errors with rectangular matrices. By changing it to use the `Min` of the rowCover or the costMatrix length, the errors are avoided and correct results generated.

**Issue description**

If a user subscribes to `NewFrame` event, `Bitmap newFrame` will be null on line 531.

```
System.NullReferenceException: 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object.'

newFrame was null.
```

https://github.com/accord-net/framework/blob/d0ac7f2f6e7a6c63685bfe7c1fcc15a377013a50/Sources/Accord.Controls.Imaging/AForge/VideoSourcePlayer.cs#L520-L575

Should it be this instead?

```cs
newFrame = (Bitmap)eventArgs.Frame.Clone();
```

**Issue description**

what im trying to do is to predect a variable based on multiparameters
let's say i have the following table : 

__A___B___C____D__
| 0.1 |  0.8  |   0.4  |  A |
| 0.2 |  0.7  |   0.5  |  B |
| 0.4 |  0.9  |   0.7  |  C |
| 0.5 |   0.0   |   0.8  |  c |
| 0.9 |0.14 |   0.9  |  A |
|  1.0   |  0.8  |   0.3  |  B |
| 0.0    |  0.5  |   0.4  |  D |
| 0.2 |0.01 |   0.2  |  D |
| 0.8 |  0.4  |   0.5  |  A |
| 0.7 |  0.7  |   0.8  |  B |
| 0.9 |  0.9  |   0.7  |  C |
| 0.1 |  0.3  |   0.7  |  D |
...
...


and i need to predect the value of D based on A,B, and C
can any one put some examples ?
