Show and hide animation not implementedÔºåUse Vue transition-group animation, but not compatible

Hi,

I've prepared Angular integration for your project. It would be nice to add it to "Usage with Frameworks" section next to Vue and Ract. [Link](https://github.com/KamilPuczka/ngx-animate-css-grid)
When I add a custom style to an element with JS like
`node.style.transform = "rotate(" + (Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) - 10).toString() + "deg)";`
and then do an action that animates the grid, the previous rotation is lost. 

I guess this is due to the fact, that the animation mechanism uses transform for itself and just overwrites everything that was there before. 

Is it possible to keep all previously defined styles and only _add_ the transforms for the animation of the grid?
Hello, 

first let me thank you a lot for providing and supporting such an easy to use library. 

I'd like to use it within one of my Gatsby projects. Gatsby compiles a static version of each page/route and therefore the build fails if the code tries to access `window`.

Usually, we can come around this issue by checking for `typeof window !== 'undefined'` before it is used anywhere, but that doesn't work in this case. It seems `window` is accessed/required right after importing. Can you follow me?

Sadly, I'm not really sure how to resolve this problem, but I'm trying to investigate the webpack build.


Great library! We have implemented this library to our website but are having some problems with animation jankiness on lower end smartphones. As you can see in https://www.conforama.es the header uses this library to animate a collapsing/expanding effect during scroll. Do you have some suggestions we could add in order to make animations smoother? We have already tried the "will-change: transform" rule however this resulted in more not less jankinness.
can't find in docs the answer
In the app I'm building I have a CSS grid layout with a side panel and a main content container. I want to be able to toggle this panel (ie, hide it) by clicking on a handle. I'm trying this library in order to be able to animate the CSS grid changes. What I do, is adding a class that sets the first grid column to `0`. 

```scss
.layout-landscape {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: minmax(400px, 21%) auto;

    &.layout-landscape-collapsed {
        grid-template-columns: 0 auto;
    }
}
```

The desired effect is that the panel slides off-screen. The result of using this library is that it looks like it shrinks/expands (ie, panel content doesn't move to the left of the screen, it remains in place while the panel shrinks). I wanted to ask if it's possible to achieve the desired outcome of having the left panel slide off-screen.

Also, a possible bug, while the panel is shrinking, the content disappears. When the panel expands, the content is visible (and as I mentioned, remains fixed in place while the container expands).
I am very new in CSS.
I am using react with your library, I am rendering some text inside the grid cell on click, But I want to render it after the cell got bigger, But I am unable to do that. It gets rendered instantaneously after the click. Is there any way in your library to achieve this.


First off, üëèüëèüëè. This library is awesome and ridiculously easy to use!

I'm noticing that when i add elements to the grid in React, they simply pop into existence rather than animating in in some way. Is this as expected or is there some way to get an animation in this case?

As an example i've modified the codepen from the readme to add new elements to the grid whenever you click somewhere within the grid (like on an element).

Thanks!

Edit:
Just looked at the vanilla codepen and noticed this is also how it works with the add card button, so i suppose this is as expected. So this is more of a feature request than a bug i suppose.
