updated files to work in swift 4 projects

All tests pass in Xcode 9.3
Add @objc on methods that call #selector. Can you add on you code and update the podspec?

Thank

When controller was popped, the collectionView cell object still retain by PeekPop.
Hi,
I would like to show you some changes in code. I was working with your library and it's fantastic, but also have some drawback.

I implemented showing viewController instead of view's screenshot to let me show viewController and it's loading action. Without this I had barely few things loaded then.

I changed the name of delegate method to suit Swift API guideline.

I saw that in normal cases the gesture you have to make to call commit action is like lying your finger on the screen, so I wanted to lower this requirement and make magic numbers smaller.

It would be nice if you could answer my questions somehow. :)

Great job üëç 
@marmelroy How to use PeekPop swift file in Objective C project ?

I used swift library with bridging header in my objective c project but there seems to a problem with source view registration for 3D Touch.

When i converted this file i found this method under ForceTouchDelegate
- (void)registerFor3DTouch:(UIView \* _Nonnull)sourceView viewController:(UIViewController \* _Nonnull)viewController;

Now i do not know how to use this method to register source view for 3D Touch.

Awesome framework btw!

Peek shows viewController with UIScreen bounds instead of PeekPopView's bounds. So what I end up with is the clipping of the my actual viewController's view (and not the whole view itself). 

Works well on a 6s though.
