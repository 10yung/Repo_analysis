Not working in XCode 7. No menu, no function. 

support Xcode 6.2

Hi
It is not working on Swift,
I tried with: `NSLocalizedString("", comment: "")` and nothing happens.

Added the UUID of Xcode 6.0.1 (6A317).

After disable in Xcode 6,  the Lin plugin disappear and I can't see it even though reinstall it.
Reinstall using Alcatraz, crash Xcode.


- Add custom detector like `XXLocalizedString(key)`;
- Select `Localizable.strings` ad default when add new key/value;

tried with both 5 and 6 build tools.  
any ideas?

thanx in advance

I messed up one of my project's xcodeproj file and recreated again but now lin is showing pop up empty I can't even select a Localizable file. The strange thing is that while in other projects works fine if I start the one that doesn't work and show the Lin pop-up it won't work in any project until I close xcode and re-open it again

[From the Docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/LoadingResources/Strings/Strings.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000051i-CH6-SW1)

> Note: It is recommended that you save strings files using the UTF-16 encoding, which is the default encoding for standard strings files. It is possible to create strings files using other property-list formats, including binary property-list formats and XML formats that use the UTF-8 encoding, but doing so is not recommended. For more information about the standard strings file format, see “Creating Strings Resource Files.” For more information about Unicode and its text encodings, go to http://www.unicode.org/ or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode.

are there any plans to support UTF16, or is there any particular reason Lin works with UTF8 only?
