In v3 When I run `script/play` the music script successfully runs but something happens during the `web` script 
however I am able to run `script/web start` manually and it works below is the SEGFAULT error I am receiving.

```
play/vendor/gems/ruby/2.0.0/gems/kgio-2.8.0/lib/kgio_ext.bundle: [BUG] Segmentation fault
ruby 2.0.0p195 (2013-05-14 revision 40734) [x86_64-darwin13.3.0]

... [Stacktrace shit] ...

./script/web: line 5: 45770 Abort trap: 6           bundle exec unicorn -D -c config/unicorn.rb
```

Let me know if the rest of the stacktrace might be of use it is really long and I didn't want to bore anyone

This adds in the ability to queue SoundCloud URLs. SoundCloud support was added to MPD sometime at or around 0.17.x, along with a lot of other goodies. For that reason, I'm pulling out the Holman Gist, and properly `brew install`ing the official formula.

There are a few quirks to queuing that I think are attributed to the underlying ruby-mpd library. And, of course, additional quirks because most of this code assumes an actual file path. Rather than use `TagLib`, we'll call out to the SoundCloud API to fetch information. I could add a couple of new database tables to minimize the calls to support this, I guess.

I don't know who's interested in the ping. @holman @thedaniel @maddox @dreww seem like good candidates. Happy  to talk offline for the rationale, e.t.c.

I've noticed that org members that were not publicizing their membership were S.O.L.

They get this error:
![You don't seem to be in correct GitHub Organization](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/17129/127704/cKQ2rMIXbjmYeg7/Screen%20Shot%202013-11-18%20at%205.39.02%20PM.png)

The problem goes away once they hit "Publicize membership" button for themselves on the org members page. So that's the good news: we have the workaround.

I believe that a more appropriate way to check membership is
`GET /orgs/:org/members/:user` as [described in Organization Members API.](http://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/members/#check-membership) Then you'd display "the day the music stopped..." error if response status is other than **204.**

I am running Play off `v3` branch, FYI.

Maybe mention the MYSQL_PASSWORD bit in the readme. If you run through once, then add it, the blank password has already been written to the `play.yml` file.

This is v3.

Perhaps we could barf a little more output when installing things via brew? I thought something had frozen on the bootstrap, so thinking maybe we could resurface these lines in the brew output to show progress

Meow.

Caveat: I'm treading in deep waters given my rudimentary Ruby knowledge so forgive me if this goes astray. Also, this error is in the context of the Cocoa client, but I believe the issue may lie in the play app so bear with me.

I've set up the v3-channels branch and am trying to use the downloaded Cocoa client. Upon clicking the "Get Your Play Token" button, my browser opens, navigates to the Play app, does the oauth dance with Github and I'm taken back to a page that tells me I'm not in the organization. I am the owner of the organization listed in my play.yml so there's some issue there. That's problem 1.

If I repeat this process, when the browser navigates to http://<myapp>:3030/token, I'm presented with a "This page does not exist" error. That's problem 2.

Apparently, my user is still created because I can revisit the Play app and I have a user account. When I look at the settings for that account, there is a generated auth token. However, attempting to use this token makes the Cocoa client shake angrily. Now, this could be a problem with the client and not the Play app itself, but I wanted to tell the whole story.

I'm willing to take a shot at fixing this, but need some pointers as to where to begin to tackle it.

Just ran across this after updating homebrew and trying to install mpd

```

==> Caveats
      As of mpd-0.17.4, this formula no longer enables support for streaming
      output by default. If you want streaming output, you must now specify
      the --with-libshout, --with-lame, --with-twolame, and/or --with-flac
      options explicitly. (Use '--with-libshout --with-lame --with-flac' for
      the pre-0.17.4 behavior.)

      As of mpd-0.17.4, this formula has renamed options as follows:
        --lastfm            -> --with-lastfm
        --libwrap           -> --with-libwrap (unsupported in OSX >= 10.8)
        --enable-soundcloud -> --with-yajl
```

Removes leftover parts of the old PlayQueue. Fixes #323

this and that and minor changes :cool:
