Typically rotation is set to null for many videos but sometimes it can be set to 0.
Rotation = 0 shouldn't swap the width and height in my opinion. This has caused problems by returning incorrect resolution for some of the videos we have. 

I can send a fix for this if you agree this is an issue. 
My fix is to add `rotation == 0` check at

I've been able to create mp4 videos using this gem and it uploads without any issues to iPhoto, Twitter, iMovie, etc, but for some reason the same mp4 video is not able to be sent over iMessage. When I try to send an mp4 video I've generated with this gem it just causes iMessage to "hang" or stall.

It looks to me like there might be some sort of format issue with the MP4 video because I am able to send other MP4 videos not converted using this gem through iMessage successfully. 

Here is the options hash I am using:
options = {
video_codec: "libx264", frame_rate: 30, seek_time:start_time ,duration:duration, resolution:"640x360", audio_codec:"aac", audio_stream:"stereo", video_stream:"yuv420p", colorspace:"yuv420p"
}

Does anyone know the proper options to get a MP4 video that is compatible with iMessage? 
Can it be the ffmpeg version I'm using? 

Anything that can point me in the right direction would be appreciated. 

         

Hello, sometimes when I try to create thumbnail (`gif` from mp4) I got error
`Failed encoding.Errors: no output file created. Full output: [mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2 @ 0x56115bc2c940] moov atom not found\n/path/filename.mp4: Invalid data found when processing input\n"`
But it's happening not always, but verry often nearly 1 of 3 transcoding return error.

code that I use

    video      = FFMPEG::Movie.new(file_path)
    video.transcode(thumb_path, custom: ["-ss", "#{(video.duration.to_i / 2) - 5}", "-s", "320x240", "-t", "10", "-hide_banner"] )
Is this possible with this gem or ffmpeg in general? 
How to encode video to m3u8?
With v3.0.0 of the gem, one could do the following to get a screenshot of a RTMP stream

```ruby
    ffmpeg_stream = FFMPEG::Movie.new "rtmp://piczel.tv:1935/live/1"
    ffmpeg_stream.screenshot path
```

But with the newer 3.0.2 version this is now broken and now we get the following error:
```
Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - the file 'rtmp://piczel.tv:1935/live/1' does not exist
```
This commit e9e11230c5419cdf904256074f5caad590c98cc5 in particular seems to be source of the problem, perhaps it should be reverted? Or just add `rtmp` to the regexp list in there.

Add `x264_vprofile_level`, `constant_rate_factor`, `reference_frames`, `strict` to encoding params
I'm considering using this gem for a project, and noticed that the current version of ffmpeg that I just installed via brew is 4.0.1, which seems quite farther along than version 2.8.4 referenced in the README. 

Have you been following along with the ffmpeg releases and just not updated the version referenced in the README? Just wondering. 

I figured I'd ask now before it bites me later.
gem "streamio-ffmpeg"

cannot load such file -- streamio-ffmpeg

Is there any plans to add GIF helper method?
