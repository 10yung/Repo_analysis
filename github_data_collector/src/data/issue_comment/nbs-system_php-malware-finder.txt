I am running the script with
./phpmalwarefinder /var/www
And it is detecting all my wordpress files as DodgyStrings or ObfuscatedPhp or DodgyPhp.
When I check them, I don't see any problems...
What am I doing wrong?
Hi. Any idea why when running scans the script seems to detect obfuscated PHP and hidden items in almost all image files?

HiddenInAFile /images/qYSKBv9ccEHa6wawII6B.jpeg
ObfuscatedPhp images/t92uhwrCGuY55f4z3mHq.jpeg

Any idea how i would validate this? or stop it from happening?
* Individuals rules are generated from utils/generate_whitelist.py
* Globals whitelists data are generated from https://git.spip.net/_outils_/yara-spip

Could solve  #89 
Hello

Could be nice to add [spip](https://git.spip.net/spip/spip) (or gihub [mirror](https://github.com/spip/spip) support. I've a PR but maybe some question to be correct. I use generate_whitelist script to generate and have some questions :
* Rule are not private at https://github.com/nbs-system/php-malware-finder/blob/master/php-malware-finder/utils/generate_whitelist.py#L38
* False condition is added in https://github.com/nbs-system/php-malware-finder/blob/master/php-malware-finder/utils/generate_whitelist.py#L40 but on https://github.com/nbs-system/php-malware-finder/blob/master/php-malware-finder/whitelist.yar this condition is missing. Must be conserved ? 
* generate_whitelist.py doesn't look to support multi version. Then a file manage all included version. I'm not sure about this use way.

Thanks a lot
I wonder if there's a better way of doing this. 
Hi,

I cloned the git repo but I'm missing the instructions how to use it. Can you please add more details to the readme how to use it if I download it from git?

Thanks
This PR is a rewrite in Go of the old and ugly shell script. It adds huge performance improvements, as well as a few enhancements like allowing to exclude common files from the scan, or to set the max filesystem operations per second the application will perform.

It does not pass the CI tests as `go get "github.com/hillu/go-yara"` seems to fail to compile the module, probably due to the location YARA is installed in, but `tests pass on my machine` :trollface:. I didn't look much into solving this issue, if you have any ideas feel free to tell me or to add commits to that PR.

This somehow solves #65.

Hi, running generate_whitelist.py and mass_whitelist.py result in similar errors:

```python
Server:utils username$ ./generate_whitelist.py 
Usage: ./generate_whitelist.py name_of_the_rule_and_version folder_to_scan
Server:utils username$ ./generate_whitelist.py x2engine ~/Desktop/X2CRM-6.9/
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./generate_whitelist.py", line 22, in <module>
    rules = yara.compile('../php.yar', includes=True, error_on_warning=True)
yara.SyntaxError: ../php.yar(371): undefined identifier "IsWhitelisted"
```
This is using yara-python-3.7.0 and Python 2.7.15 on OS X.

It's probably me, but just in case...

Currently, we're not detecting a lot of @wireghoul's [htaceess-based webshells]( https://github.com/wireghoul/htshells ). It would be nice to improve the situation :)
