Hi,

When I run the command **mosql --collections collections.yml --skip-tail** for importing data from Mongo db to Postgre, I am getting the following error.

**`rescue in block in copy_data': uninitialized constant MoSQL::Schema::PGError (NameError)**

SQL Tables are creating successfully. But the data is not imported.

Any idea about this issue? 
Connects to https://github.com/stripe/mosql/issues/107
_Is this project dead? I see no updates in a few years and all the pull requests are stale. Should I bother fixing the tests in my PR and trying to integrate it?_

## Summary

I'm starting to use mosql to migrate from mongodb with mongoose schemas to postgres. This diff has a number of improvements that were necessary for my migration:
 - Support for foreign keys on nested schemas
 - `ObjectId` is now stored as `bytea`
 - Support for array types
 - Support for `:default`, `:notnull`, etc
 - Better bulk insert support (and perf) via the the use of `Sequel::Database##multi_insert`

## Examples

This corresponds to the following:

```
var ChildrenSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: { type: String }
});

var TestSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: { type: String },
    tags: [{ type: String }],
    balance: { type: Number },
    meta: { type: Object },
    children: [ ChildrenSchema ]
});
```

```
alphaflow:
    test:
        :columns:
        - id:
          :source: _id
          :type: bytea 
          :notnull: true
        - name:
          :source: name
          :type: text
        - tags:
          :source: tags
          :type: text array
        - balance:
          :source: balance
          :type: int
        - meta:
          :source: meta
          :type: jsonb
        :meta:
          :table: test 
          :schema: alphaflow
        :children:
          :meta:
            :table: test_children
            :schema: alphaflow
          :columns:
          - id:
            :source: _id
            :type: bytea not null
          - name:
            :source: name
            :type: text
```

## Testing done

A bunch of manual testing, including on some rather complex schemas.

_Note this diff is not safe to integrate, as it broke most of the unit tests_
My company just used MoSQL to migrate our production MongoDB into Postgres but we needed it to support SSL for Compose.io, which it didn't seem to handle yet.  Hopefully, this may be helpful for others trying to use this project in the future.

I have not written Ruby for a while, but I needed this for a project, and it seems to work. This adds the possibility of selecting a specific value using an array selector [0]. This is especially useful for projects where there are arrays where you always just want the first value, rather than creating a Postgres array. 

Hello,
Im very interesting in this approach. I would like to know if you still use this method in Stripe or you can say something new about this. Thank you.

Full table scans ðŸ˜¢  It would be great to be able to specify columns that need to be indexed in `collections.yml`. 

I've been doing testing with this tool to migrate data from mongo db and this one of the issue that I have yet to find out a solution... been wondering a while looking for a solution... but there's no clear solution until now. Please find the stack trace in the attachment..

mosql version unknown (but when I try to uninstall the mosql, it mentions the version of mosql-0.4.3
ruby version: ruby 2.2.4p230 (2015-12-16 revision 53155) [x64-mingw32]

I made a changes to cli.rb under this folder  C:\Ruby22-x64\lib\ruby\gems\2.2.0\gems\mosql-0.4.3\lib\mosql  to delete "USR2" at line 27 from the list to fix issue of running mosql.

Hope to hear from you guys
