Thanks for making the great tool & writing the detailed tutorial!

I am now using it to help count cells. But I have a question about how to generate the `roi.tif` in `Analyze_ROIs.m`. This is the process I inferred: first I generate an ROI channel and combine it into the raw tif image as one single file. After the whole process, I will obtain the transformed tif file, then I split the roi channel out of the transformed tif file. This roi channel itself would be `roi.tif`. Is it correct? If so, I wonder whether there is available scripts to do this? Thank you!

Hi,

Thanks again for creating this tool, it is working great for me.
However, I was wondering if it would be possible to have other brain templates instead of the wireframe/braingrid? for instance a see trough brain in which you can highlight different brain areas.

The https://github.com/AllenInstitute/cocoframer package has this option but is coded in R and cannot indicate probe points in the 3D brain.

an example that I would like to use would be something like this...

I understand if it is to much to ask.

kind regards,

Yawende
Thank you for this great tool, it is awesome!

It is clear though that its designer bear particular interest in cortical and subcortical recordings - in order to make the probe mapping work in the cerebellum, the top of the brain has to be re-called 'CBX' (Allen alias for cerebellar cortex) rather than 'Isocortex':

Display_Probe_Track.m, l.122:

`isoCtxId = num2str(st.id(strcmp(st.acronym, 'CBX'))); %num2str(st.id(strcmp(st.acronym, 'Isocortex')));`

I guess the universal acronym to use should be 'grey' or 'root', I will let the author decide.

Thanks again!
First of all, thanks a lot for making this tool available! I was wondering if there is a way to make it work with sagittal slices? 
Hi, this is very impressive work and tool developed by the authors. Thank you! 

We in our lab use Multi-electrode arrays to record from awake freely interacting SD rats and ICR mice. As  I see, the brain coordinates for this program are derived from Allen brain atlas which is a C57 mouse atlas. Thus, would be useful to find regions using your method for ICR mice and do u have any suggestions on how to use your method for SD Rats?
Hi,

Can you give me some insights in how you creaed the brainGridData.npy file?

Thanks!
Currently, only hierarchical search of a region is possible, which is fine, but it would be nicer to have an opportunity to just start typing a name of a region and have the parsed options to choose from.
Thanks a lot for the great tool! 
It would be amazing to have an opportunity to add multiple probes, and also have a possibility to set restrictions (for example posed by the shape and height of the headplate used), so that the programme would not allow to set probe locations and angles that would not be possible in the real setup.
