Hello

If I try to run the latest in-built version of Wash/Reaver I get this error:

<a href="https://imgur.com/egMnrDl"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/egMnrDl.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

So I downgraded to v1.6.1 which runs o.k., but than I get new problems. If I run Reaver on it's own, it just won't associate:

If I do the association manually than I get this:

<a href="https://imgur.com/gcP5f7v"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gcP5f7v.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

Wifi chip that I'm using is Realtek RTL8812AU. Injection and everything else seems to work just fine. Anyone knows what could be the problem here?
The first problem was:

> wash -i wlan1
> [X] ERROR: pcap_activate status -1
[X] PCAP: generic error code
couldn't get pcap handle, exiting

Problems solved by comment https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x/issues/265#issuecomment-441272085

There is now a second problem

> wash -i wlan1
> [X] ERROR: pcap_activate status -8
> [X] PCAP: no permission to open the device
> couldn't get pcap handle, exiting

When attempting to use Reaver on macOS:

sudo reaver -i en0 -b 14:A5:1A:09:7F:A3 -F -vvv

I have tried moving closer to the router, too.

Are there any other mac compatible pieces of software that I can use to handle authentication? (aireplay-ng isn't supported, it seems)
Hi,

I am still learning about all the details having said that I've been able in the past to get the pin for a PSK enabled routers.

This time I am encountering this issue with reaver stuck at 99.99% and keeps on repeating the same key after its done so many keys. I was reading the following link and someone suggesting I should modify the code to bypass this problem but I am not sure why the latest version still have this as a problem when it goes way back?

https://code.google.com/archive/p/reaver-wps/issues/195

From the link above, I sort of understand what the problem is but I would like to know what is the right way to fix this issue and if there is a simple solution since its been a long while.

I am using Reaver v1.6.5 in latest Kali.

Here is my reaver command line for a Broadcom router with PSK enabled:-
reaver -i wlan1mon -b xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx -c -k -v -S -N

When I rean reaver initially it always displays the msg: Found packet with bad FCS, skipping, then it starts
and after 15 hours or so it got stuck at 00003432 the first 4 pins are:0000

Now if I try reaver to start with a specific pin it just keeps on repeating in an endless loop.

Thanks.
Trying to compile Reaver using my Android LG G3 D855 that has LineageOS.
Linux localhost 3.4.113-Lineage-ga7e8977 #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Jun 13 17:39:39 UTC 2018 armv71 Android.

I was hoping that I would be able to compile wash/reaver latest source on Android and then use nexmon drivers https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon to turn my Android phone Broadcom wireless card into monitor mode (or use an Android supported external USB Wifi card).

However the Wash/Reaver source code did not seem to compile successfully at all.

===

I installed Termux android app. I then installed make, clang (6.0), libpcap, libpcap-dev.
./configure seemed to create a config.status and config.mak

However, when trying to do a 'make' I get the following error.

wpsmon.o: In function 'monitor':
/data/data/com/termux/files/home/reaver-wps-fork-t6x/src/wpsmon.c:331: undefined reference to 'ualarm'
wpsmon.o: In function 'parse_wps_settings':
clang-6.0: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
make: *** [ Makefile:123: reaver] Error 1

====

According to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23447616/ualarm-equivalent-android-bionic-libc
it says the following:

ualarm() is not implemented in Android version of libc, bionic (check Bionic unistd.h). Moreover, ualarm() is obsolete.

The answer is in the Linux ualarm() man page: This function is obsolete. Use setitimer(2) or POSIX interval timers (timer_create(2), etc.) instead. â€“ fadden May 3 '14 at 18:58

====

Can we change wpsmon.c:331 to use timer_create instead of ualarm by default or something?
or if the OS is android (or does not support ualarm)? or is there a better way to compile it?

Thanks

Could the following:
"ENC" encryption type (WPA / WPA2 / OPN)
"CIPHER" (CCMP / TKIP)
 "AUTH" (PSK)
Please be added to the wash -j Json output for all networks as seperate values.
(Including wash -a all open/encrypted devices)

Similar to what airodump-ng outputs.

Thanks
From my little understanding on the subject once first four numbers of the pin have been correctly guessed by Reaver or bully it will then proceed to bruteforce the other 3 as the 8th digit is the checksum of all 7 ? Did i get it right ? I have noticed that there might be few routers with WPS that do not follow that pattern as either reaver or bully gives: Exhausted second-half possibilities without success. Would it be possible to add a switch to carry on with the second part of the pin cracking the same as a first part?
I have a laptop with a bcm4360 wireless chipset.
I installed the broadcom-wl drivers and enabled it's monitor&injection mode based on the instructions at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Broadcom_wireless#Setting_broadcom-wl_in_monitor_mode
following that i performed a check using the `airodump -i prism0` command, which seemed to suggest it was constantly capturing packets, identifying beacons, handshakes, and when supplied with the "--wps"  flag, it identified wps data as well.
using airodump to actually dump the packets data into a file and having wash use that file produced proper information about the networks, similar to what airodump was showing.

the issues are:
* wash does not work with the interface directly, it just does nothing.
* when supplying the info to reaver directly based on the file captures, it gets stalled at "waiting for beacon" and does nothing.

What are your thoughts about adding an easier method to output the WPS configuration methods in json,
for example 
`"wps_config_methods": "2084", "wps_config_methods_str": ["Label", "Push Button", "Virtual Display"],`

according to Wireshark the bit values for the WPS configuration methods are 
```
.... .... .... ...1	USB
.... .... .... ..1.	Ethernet
.... .... .... .1..	Label
.... .... .... 1...	Display
.... .... ...1 ....	External NFC
.... .... ..1. ....	Internal NFC
.... .... .1.. ....	NFC Interface
.... .... 1... ....	Push Button
.... ...1 .... ....	Keybad
.... ..1. .... ....	Virtual Push Button
.... .1.. .... ....	Physical Push Button
..1. .... .... ....	Virtual Display
.1.. .... .... ....	Physical Display
```



Hello pin crackers!

For the last few days I tried to crack this PIN running on a router RealtekS 2.0 WPS. I am using latest 1.65 reaver. Wash -i wlan1mon shows that WPS is not locked. It seems like the full PIN has been found, please see description below:

I am running a command:

./reaver -b xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx  -p 97423171 -c 6 -i wlan1mon -vvv -N -T 2.00 -r 1:5 -w

without N option the transaction would just fail, I can only reproduce this result above by adding -N. I tried using this method to connect with the router to get the PSK: 
https://miloserdov.org/?p=138
But It would not allow me to connect either.

I am out of ideas at the moment, any suggestions ?
