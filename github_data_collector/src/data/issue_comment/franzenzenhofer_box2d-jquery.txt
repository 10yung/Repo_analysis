GitHub changed the way Markdown headings are parsed, so this change fixes it.

Hi and thanks for this great plugin.

Is there a way to change the gravity direction according to the accelerometer of iOS or Android devices?

apply requestAnimationFrame

apply translate3D

I like your plug very much.. but it not have the option named containment ( moving elements inside a div )  that is in jQuery.throwable.Please include this option so , i can make my game easly!!

Hi!

I'm trying to rotate divs to use them as static diagonal obstacles.

The css rotation values seem to get overridden as soon as I make the div participate in the physics simulation. This makes sense for dynamic objects. But I imagine there should be some way of rotating static elements? 

To re-cap: Is it possible to give static elements custom rotational values and what would the correct syntax be?

Hi!

I checked all the examples, but there wasn't anything on how to create some irregular terrain. I would be fine with just drawing a straight line with some diagonal ups and downs, but what is the methdod/syntax of doing something like that with box2d-jquery?

I love this library, and really want to use it for a bio section on my site.
It would be nice to be able to set the container div that the object should stay within the bounds of. This way I could have the "photo balls" to fall and bounce around my bio section without falling out of view.
Is this a planned update? Or is there a setting for it I am missing?

According to jQuery, Opera v12.12 and older may sometimes report offsetWidth and/or offsetHeight less than zero on some elements. Therefore, the check if an element is loaded should not simply evaluate for 0/false, since negative numbers will incorrectly evaluate as true.

Is there a way to disable gravity and let the balls just move constantly without dropping?
