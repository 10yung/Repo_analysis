When processing a gif with gifsicle I'd like to be able to remove the transparency and replace it with a solid background color. Can a flag be added to do this? If this is already possible then can the documentation be improved to describe this use case? Thanks.
Just for fun I compiled it with wasm and built a React interface over it, is there any interest in having the wasm fork https://github.com/marvinirwin/gifsicle-wasm be part of the repo?

I found it fun to make and I would be willing to clean up the code up and maintain it.  There's a demo 
https://marvinirwin.com/gifsicle-wasm/   I'm just wondering if it's worth the time

At the time of writing this, the Web Worker version isn't pushed but will be soon
It would be nice to have an option for scaling images in respect to just the smallest side.

And also, it would be very nice to have the option to skip pictures that already are larger or smaller  than what you're scaling to.

Example:
A.gif 500x180px
B.gif 220x400px
C.gif 500x320px

gifsicle --batch --resize-smallside 256 --enlargeonly -i *.gif

Would resize A to 712x256, B to 256x466 and skip C. --shrinkonly would of course instead only affect C and resize to 400x256.

I'd use this because of Google photos - it only automatically backups images with a smallest side of 256 pixels or larger, and I have a humongous amount of animated gifs I'd like to backup, but many of them are too small, and there's hundreds if not thousands of gifs with different resolutions in various folders.
Hi , 

I am working on a service that resizes gifs with gifsicle. Through my tests , gifsicle works great so far, but I have this particular image that is giving me problem.

Normally when I resize it with gifsicle , there is no error , and I can visually validate it is correctly 
resizing the image and the animation is working fine on my ubuntu machine.

But when I try to check the same file on macos , it is very weird that it is slow and animation stops after a while.

I don't know this is related to gifsicle but if I test the original file ( not resized with gifsicle ) 
animation works without any problem.

So I wondered and tried to play with the result file and saw that one of the `giftools` is giving error like `GIF-LIB error: Image EOF detected before image complete.` . I think error comes directly from 
`libgif` . I am using latest released version `1.92`  of gifsicle.

Here is the command that I am executing to generate the problem
```
root@efd81c1062e9:/u/apps/site# gifsicle --resize="201x202" -o - original.gif  | gif2rgb -v

gif2rgb: Image 1 at (0, 0) [201x202]: 201 
gif2rgb: Image 2 at (2, 6) [196x190]: 189 
gif2rgb: Image 3 at (3, 6) [194x190]: 189 GIF-LIB error: Image EOF detected before image complete.
```

I am attaching the problem gif file. Can you help me to understand what is wrong with the resizing operation or there is nothing wrong with it. 

Thanks !!!

This should solve #138
I am confused how exactly to go about enable multi-threaded support.  `./configure --help` mentions an option to _disable_ threads, but does not mention how to turn it on.  Just using regular `./configure; make install` and trying `-j8` seems to still only use 1 thread, which makes me thing it's not actually enabled.
Also, `./configure --enable-threads` doesn't seem to do anything either
I've tried gifsicle on a sample of images and it is working amazing. It's fast, transforms images that other libs can't handle and the results are compatible with webP conversion.

There's however one feature I'm missing, which is resizing to specified dimensions (both width and height) while preserving aspect ratio.
As far as I can tell, existing modes produce images that either preserve aspect ratio and don't *exceed* the dimensions, satisfying at least one (width or height) of them OR break aspect ratio and fit the dimensions exactly.

Basically what I'm looking for is gifsicle to fill the missing pixels to match the dimensions. Here's an example with a blue fill: https://ibb.co/z5GRnYb

Is this something that could be easily added?

Make right-clicking on a window go to the previous frame, for symmetry's sake.

$ man gifview

> Left-clicking on a window goes to the next frame; right-clicking on a window deletes that window.

Rather cruel. How about instead:

> Left-clicking on a window goes to the next frame;
> Right-clicking on a window goes to the previous frame.
mplayer has a handy -fs option, so should gifview.
xli(1) has a handy zoom option, so should gifview.
