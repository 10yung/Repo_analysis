I am new to python. As the code was written some 4 years back, I am not able to use some functionalities. Currently I am using Python version 3.7.3 and it no longer supports pandas.rpy.common. So I am importing pandas2ri from rpy2.robjects to tackle this. 

In the function convert_datafiles(datasets_folder)  in the loop for var in robj, I am replacing first myRData = com.load(var) with myRData=pandas.ri2py(var).
But I am not getting any success in it.  Please help me out in this.
Hi, 

Could you share chapter 9 and 10 as well? Or do you intentionally deleted them?

Thanks!
Hi, Thank you very much for doing this. I found the figure in out[67] in Chapter 6.ipynb might have wrong axis names. The y label should be percentage of total variance, and the x label should be component. 

Hi thanks for sharing the notebooks! Could you please share the .csv files that you use for the analysis?


I'm the first author (Max). Thanks for doing the translations to python. I'd like to offer any top-level help that I can (e.g. "why did you do it that way" or "what exactly does this do").

There are probably a few models not in scikit-learn but we can probably find something fairly similar.  

One request though... please try not to copy/paste a lot of text directly from the book. Our publisher might go apeshit over that.
