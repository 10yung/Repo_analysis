Following #109, I've started working on v7, which is now available with the beta tag. You can install it like so:
```
yarn add react-use-gesture@beta
```

### 📕 [Docs](https://use-gesture.netlify.com/)

React-use-gesture has a proper [documentation website](https://use-gesture.netlify.com/)!

### ⛱ Sandbox
You can play with v7 options in this sandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-use-gesture-v7-oft72

### ✅ New features

#### All gestures
- Added `threshold` config option that will prevent the gesture handler to fire if the gesture displacement hasn't breached a threshold.
- Added `elapsedTime` to `state` that will contain the elapsed time of the gesture (from start to end).

#### Coordinates based gestures
- Added a `axis` config option that can accept `'x'` or `'y'` and that will result in the handler only being fired when the gesture is initiated along the specified axis. 
- Added a `lockDirection` config option that when true will lock the gesture movement in the first intentional axis.
- Added bounds `{top, bottom, left, right}`
- Added rubberbanding to simulate gesture elasticity out of bounds

#### useDrag
- Added `threshold` config option that will prevent `useDrag` to fire if the gesture displacement hasn't breached a threshold.
- Added a `filterTaps` config option that will fire the drag handler with the `tap` attribute set to `true` if the user has tapped and released with a displacement inferior to `3`.
- Added a `swipe` state option that will help users identify if the gesture was a `swipeLeft|Right|Top|Bottom`. Swipe recognition can be customized with `swipeVelocity` and `swipeDistance` config options.

### ⏳ Progress
- [x] Support refs
- [x] useWheel
- [x] useScroll
- [x] useMove
- [x] usePinch 😭
- [x] Integrate `onStart` / `onEnd`
- [x] Pass on traditional handlers (`onClick`, `onMouseMove`, etc.)
- [x] Test new features 🤯
- [x] Comment code 😞
- [x] Write new docs

If there's any other features you would like this lib to support, this is the right place!
Any plans?
