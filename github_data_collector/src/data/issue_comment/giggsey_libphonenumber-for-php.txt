+5215611684411  need parse 15611684411 
but show 5611684411

https://giggsey.com/libphonenumber/?phonenumber=%2B5215611684411&country=&language=&region=

use metadata 8.11.1

When I tried to parse +22505855515, I get following result 
```
PhoneNumber {#255
  #countryCode: 225
  #nationalNumber: "5855515"
  #extension: null
  #italianLeadingZero: true
  #rawInput: null
  #countryCodeSource: 4
  #preferredDomesticCarrierCode: null
  #hasNumberOfLeadingZeros: false
  #numberOfLeadingZeros: 1
}
```

In above result Leading zero is removed... 
If I use `numberOfLeadingZeros` then this is causing issue for other numbers.

First of Thanks for this package i've been using it for years now and really love it.

Here in the Netherlands more than 90% of the 60M mobile numbers (06) are in use thats why we have a special range for data-only devices. This new number is a 12 digit number and starts with 079 (including leading zero)

**National:** 097123456789
**International:** +3197123456789

**Formatted National:** 097 12 34 56 789
**Formatted International:** +31 (0)97 12 34 56 789


This new range is used for:
- Machine to Machine (M2M)
Independent working devices that communicate with each other automatically. Examples: smart energy meters, navigation systems, mobile internet dongles on laptops, e-readers and blood pressure meters.

- Machine to Human (M2H)
Independent working devices. Examples: security or alarm systems that call the security company, cars that call the emergency number after a collision.

- Human to Machine (H2M)
Independent working devices that someone sets remotely. Examples: security cameras and thermostats.

- Human to Human (H2H)
Connections where people choose a programmed number to communicate with others at the touch of a button. Examples: telephones in elevators for automatic connection to an emergency service, tablets that only send text messages, apps and emails.

See #263 
[Symfony polyfill](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/polyfill-mbstring) could be required instead of native mbstring extension.
This could ease package installation.
While I understand the rationale behind #119 ,`giggsey/locale` dependency could lead to inconsistency for people which are already using the intl extension, and is useless for people which have up-to-date ICU.

As such I think you could add `giggsey/locale` (and `ext-intl`) in the `suggest` composer section and make the `Locale` class a variable (don't know how to do this properly though).

WDYT?
