Hi, I work for Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio as the HMIS Data Analyst and HUD has recently released its updated spreadsheet of every Continuum of Care's (a Continuum of Care is a geographical region that coordinates homeless services) System Performance data for years 2015 through 2018. 

There is a lot of meaning and things to be aware of in the data and I'd like to discuss maybe helping to contextualize it if this would be an area of interest for Tidy Tuesday. I'll be at RStudio::conf if you would like to talk about it in person.

The data: [link](https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/5691/system-performance-measures-data-since-fy-2015/)
Series of short videos that explain about the "System Performance Measures": [link](https://www.hudexchange.info/trainings/system-performance-measures/)
Actual specs for the System Performance Measures: [link](https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3894/system-performance-measures-introductory-guide/)
Shapefiles for where all the CoC boundaries are: [link](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/coc/gis-tools/)
The links in the table [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019) are broken. For example, the christmas music data link points [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2019/data/2019/2019-12-24) instead of the correct page [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-12-24)
Information is Beautiful released the raw datasets for a bunch (all?) of their data visualizations:

There seems to be some issues with the dog_descriptions data as reading it via readr gave wierd codes for states.

Example ids and state codes

id | contact_state
-- | --
41330726 | 89146
38169117 | 85249
45833989 | 12220
45515547 | 12220

Is this deliberate to help practise cleaning the data / or a text field  having a comma is not quoted?
It looks like the name fields for the records contain commas and may be this is the issue.
Or should we read in the data using a quote parameter.
Thanks,
Pradeep
R data package: https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/claremontrun. 

From the README:

claremontrun is an R data package that provides data from the [Claremont
Run](http://www.claremontrun.com/) project. This project collects data on [Chris Claremont’s](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chris_Claremont) iconic run on [Uncanny X-Men](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Uncanny_X-Men).

claremontrun includes 7 data sets relevant to the Claremont run:

  - `character_visualization`, counts of character speech, thought,
    narrative, or visual depictions
  - `characters`, descriptions of character actions
  - `comic_bechdel`, whether or not an issue of another (non-X-Men)
    comic series met the Bechdel test
  - `covers`, data on covers of issues of Uncanny X-Men
  - `issue_collaborators`, data about other collaborators on each issue,
    such as editors
  - `location`, locations that appear in each issue
  - `xmen_bechdel`, whether or not an issue of Uncanny X-Men met the
    Bechdel test

Data on the Soviet Space Dog missions from the 50s and 60s. Collated by Duncan Geere. 
For details check out my [repo](https://github.com/committedtotape/soviet-space-dogs).

It contains 2 CSV files of cleaned and tidied data ready for use (dogs_clean.csv and flights_clean.csv).

I've also written 2 blog posts on how I [prepared the data](https://davidsmale.netlify.com/portfolio/soviet-space-dogs-part-1/) and [visualised it](https://davidsmale.netlify.com/portfolio/soviet-space-dogs-part-2/).

I think it's a fascinating subject, I hope you consider it!

Thanks!

From Data is Plural:

> Last month, Nature released findings and response data from its fifth survey of science graduate students. The questionnaire covered demographics, motivations, ambitions, satisfaction, mental health, and other topics. More than 6,000 students participated, including 1,000+ each living in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. Related: Nature’s editorial board calls for “urgent attention” to students’ mental health.

The PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) is a world-wide study conducted every 3 years by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to assess the knowledge of 15-year-old students in reading, maths, and science.

The data of the 2018 assessment were released today (Dec 3, 2019) -- it's a huge dataset with individual-level data with plenty of things to play around with.

Hey JT,

From looking at some of these coordinates and addresses you can tell a lot of the rows in the Week 49 dataset have an inaccurate `state` field.

Reprex:
`tickets %>% filter(location == "4300 CHESTNUT ST") #my apartment building`

notice they all have the same lat/lon, but supposedly come from 6 different states, none of which are PA.
