Allow downloading fonts cut down to only specific characters via the `text` parameter: https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started#optimizing_your_font_requests
I've downloaded OpenSans using your Web app, and I noticed it says that they are version 17.
The question is, where is this version coming from? I searched around on the google fonts website and the github page and all I could find for OpenSans was this:

There is no mention of the number 17 anywhere.

To get points on google PageSpeed Insights, you need to add the font-display: swap property.
In order not to enter it manually.
Thank you very much! Can I give you so money?
The Reboto regular (400) is smaller than the light (300) version
Hello,

Is this a wordpress plugin? if no, can we expect it please?

There is a similar plugin: https://github.com/asadkn/selfhost-google-fonts

Unfornately, it does not support multisite either.

Thanks
If the generated `@font-face` rule contains an empty string for `src: local('')`, the font files won't load on Android devices and therefor only the fallback fonts are displayed. 

It's not that the fonts just don't get displayed, if you take a look at the network tab in the dev tools you can see they are non existent (not even a 404, there's just nothing). It doesn't matter which browser you use on your phone (I tested Samsung and Huawei with all browser variations), on mobile devices the fonts just won't show. However, on desktop it works (tested in Firefox, Chrome, Edge, IE11, Opera on Mac & Windows).

The code snippet I used on my Website:
```
/* oswald-regular - latin */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Oswald';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: url('../fonts/oswald-v24-latin-regular.eot'); /* IE9 Compat Modes */
  src: local(''),
       url('../fonts/oswald-v24-latin-regular.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'), /* IE6-IE8 */
       url('../fonts/oswald-v24-latin-regular.woff2') format('woff2'), /* Super Modern Browsers */
       url('../fonts/oswald-v24-latin-regular.woff') format('woff'), /* Modern Browsers */
       url('../fonts/oswald-v24-latin-regular.ttf') format('truetype'), /* Safari, Android, iOS */
       url('../fonts/oswald-v24-latin-regular.svg#Oswald') format('svg'); /* Legacy iOS */
}
```

After removing the empty `local('')`, everything worked perfectly everywhere. 

I therefor would advise to remove the `local('')` from the `@font-face` rule everyone will copy-paste, if it is empty.
It'd be cool to be able to customize the filenames, so that they don't end up 100 characters long when I select many charsets.
It would be nice to be able to receive an alert (by email ?) when a font is updated (Last modified: ...).

Updates are automatic while using Google Fonts cdn but using google-webfonts-helper means we must watch periodically if files have been updated.

Thanks.
