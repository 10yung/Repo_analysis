does it have plan to develop websocket io game engine?
Currently when creating a new component manager, there is a lot of boilerplate code to handle the SoA nature of the data (allocating, deleting). It would be very helpful to have some helper code somewhere to automate this process more.

One of the biggest issues with the bitsquid engine is that they have their content-compilers built into the engine instead of having them separated. This causes issues such as not being able to run different compiler chains at the same time since the compiler server hogs one port that is predefined for everything to use.

Instead a separated compiler-chain would be a much more viable solution. Either by linking in libraries from the engine and having separated compiler layers above that or simply by using a common data library for file serialization.
