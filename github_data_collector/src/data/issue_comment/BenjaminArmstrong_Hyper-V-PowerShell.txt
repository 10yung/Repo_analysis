The Factory.ps1 does not write log files. Thus, errors in larger environments are difficult to understand. Can this be activated or installed?

No matter what I put into the "DIR" variable, it wouldn't take the text. It may be because of a space in the folder name, I don't know. However, proposed fix:
`$workingDir = (Get-Item -Path ".\").FullName`
Setting it to that actually did it for me. While I know this will only work for those who make sure everything is grouped, most of us would know to do that anyway... I hope?
Hi Ben,  I know you do not support [Convert-WindowsImage.ps1](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Convert-WindowsImageps1-0fe23a8f) from the TechNet Gallery.  However, I am trying find out what changed from 1703 to 1709 of Windows 10 that breaks the image converter.  Something changed in the API WimApplyImage from Wimgapi.dll

Any assistance you can provide would be appreciated.

This change breaks the vhdx creation in Hyper-V-PowerShell scripts on Windows 10.

I could try to modify to use the Convert-WindowsImage.ps1 from the NanoServerImageGenerator on Windows Server 2016 disk, but I am unsure about the licensing of that script. It says:

```
Use of this sample source code is subject to the terms of the Microsoft
license agreement under which you licensed this sample source code.
```

I know there is someone at Microsoft knows what changed with this API in 1709. 

Here is the error you get when running the image factory on Windows 10 Pro 1709.

```
Exception calling "Apply" with "1" argument(s): "The directory or file cannot be created"

Just tried rebuilding my vms for the first time in a while (since moving to 2016) and noticed that none of the VMs boot. I am getting an error that, when digging, seems to be related to secure boot. Seems that Gen2 VMs default to secure boot enabled. 
What do you think about add support to create images based on updates downloaded from WSUS?

It will allow control what updates will be installed.

Not sure if this makes sense, but if it does then it would be great to handle Nano too

It appears that when starting with the Windows 2012r2 evaluation ISO image it can't convert this to a WIM ready for building.. Have I missed something here ? Or do I need to build a fix ?
