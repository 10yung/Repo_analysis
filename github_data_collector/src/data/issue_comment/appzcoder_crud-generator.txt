I had a problem with adding policy authorizeResource method to a generated controller because the methods didn't use implicit binding. E.g. for model Site

```
    public function show($id)
    {
        $site = Site::findOrFail($id);
        return view('sites.show', compact('site'));
    }
```

needed to be

```
    public function show(Site $site)
    {
        return view('sites.show', compact('site'));
    }
```

Should you consider converting to latter convention, which would support the default policy stuff https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/authorization#via-controller-helpers ?
I just want to add this for future reference for all those who  are planning to use this library and gets this error. 

How to replicate : 
**Using JasperReport Studio**
1. Create a report
2. Create multiple parameter field
3. Drag it to "details" area
4. Compile to jasper file

Then create a php script that processes the jasper file.Pass a parameter value with comma(",")

Output : The first parameter field value will render fine but the rest of the values of the parameters will show null. 

<h3>Solution : Remove the comma( "," ) string in your parameter value</h3>

## Work Done
* Added `.idea` dir to gitignore for jetbrains users.
* Upgraded composer file to support Laravel 6 dependencies.
    * Added the `laravel/helpers` package to suppport functions like `str_singular`.
* Added return type to `TestCase` base class `setUp` function.
* Revised tests to expect command output the newest way detailed in [Laravel's docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/console-tests#expecting-input-and-output)
    * Removed lines in test case base related to old command output assertion implementation.
    * Removed `teardown` as it isn't needed anymore after removing above.

Seems to get tests running again. Let me know what you think. Installed locally to a laravel 6 project and was successfully generating CRUD via the commands.
   Symfony\Component\Debug\Exception\FatalThrowableError  : syntax error, unexpected '{'

When using a custom template path the method has a double slash in the full path to the stub.
I believe a feature to purge or rollback the changes is needed. 

Can you work on something like crud:rollback --tag=blog 
Also, add a feature to tag crud:generate command so to rollback.
