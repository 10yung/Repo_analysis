When running php artisan make:migration:pivot the use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema; doesn't get imported on the pivot migration file.
Hello,

Quick question please as I am not sure I understand your doc.
When we generate the schema, shall we use the Laravel migration names?
https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/migrations
ie:
dateTime
boolean
bigInteger 

and so on...

Thank you.


Laravel uses bigInteger instead of integer for ids now, so should the pivot table

Change in Laravel 5.8 - ids have to be changed from integers to big integers
This is just a question. Is this project still maintained? At the moment of this comment, Laravel already at version 5.7
dump autoloads takes very long time in big app, so I suggest moving it after the model is created so developer can work on the created model sooner.
Using make:migration:schema, it takes up to few minutes before cli creates the model and it's even getting longer.

It's just an empty class, whata takes so long?
