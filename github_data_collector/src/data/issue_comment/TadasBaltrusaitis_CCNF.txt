Hi~， I check the training code， the patch type is always 'reg', and How can I train gradient patch expert.
Does grad patches work well. Has any one try that?
PDM training:using Create_pdm_wild is ok and new model worked.
but patch training: combined_XXX_YY.bat (in prepared_data dir) did not contained;and others such as
cofw_0.5_1.bat are 29 points. is it worked?
