```

Start with `-log stdout -agree=true -conf=/etc/caddy/Caddyfile -root=/var/tmp -quic`, test HTTP/3 with:

```

Removing the "log" line solves the problem. But logging is working (for HTTP/2). Changing the "proxy" line to a "root" line also works. An "error" line doesn't involve the problem and give me these error log:

```
2020/01/17 22:32:34 [PANIC /http3-test] caddyhttp/httpserver/responsewriterwrapper.go:55 - *http3.responseWriter is not a closeNotifier
```
This PR will fix #2505 and #2977.

I updated the const names in `caddyhttp/replacer.go` which creates a little diff churn.  The naming was a little inconsistent.  I couldn't help myself.  :smiley:

Is `{http.request.tls.client.cert}` useful as `string(cert.Raw)`?  I ported the v1 behavior, but it seems like that byte slice should be encoded to printable text.  I'm not sure what it's used for.

Second commit may be off-topic, but it's trivial.  Let me know if I need to revert it.

I'm new to Caddy, so suggest any changes.
There's a lot new/changed in beta 13 (expected rollout on or before January 20)! Mostly with the Caddyfile. These notes are a draft documentation of what has changed.

I will be writing proper Caddyfile documentation to go on the website between now and then.

The Caddyfile will continue to be improved and worked on over the next few beta releases.

The final version of these release notes will be published on the release page when it is tagged.


------------------------


The enhancements in this release include the following (likely-breaking changes indicated by ⚠️):

## ⚠️ Path matching is now exact by default, not prefix.

Previously, this would proxy all requests within `/api/`, such as `/api/foobar`:

```
reverse_proxy /api/ localhost:8080
```

That is now treated as an exact match. To get path prefix matching, simply append `*` to the path:

```
reverse_proxy /api/* localhost:8080
```

The prior way of assuming prefix match made exact matching awkward/difficult.


## Within multiple instances of a directive, the Caddyfile adapter internally sorts them in descending order of specificity of their path matcher.

Consider these two directives:

```
reverse_proxy /api/* localhost:8080
reverse_proxy /api/v2/* localhost:8081
```

Previously, the second proxy would never be used because the first matcher (`/api/*`) is a superset of the second one (`/api/v2/*`).

Now, the second one will be prioritized if the request is in the `/api/v2/*` path. Internally, it's just as if you wrote the second one first.

This reordering only occurs if a single path matcher is used. Appearance order still takes precedence otherwise.


## ⚠️ The `rewrite` directive is mutually exclusive with other rewrites.

Previously, all matching rewrites would be evaluated. Now, only the first matching rewrite will be evaluated.

Consider these rewrites:

```
rewrite /docs/json/* /docs/json/index.html
rewrite /docs/*      /docs/index.html
```

The result of the first one is captured by the second one, and thus the only rewrite that is actually realized is the second one.

Now, rewrites are mutually exclusive, as there should be no reason for more than one rewrite. (Rewriting signifies the intent to reroute, or internally redirect, a request, which should need only be done once, thanks to the power of request matchers in v2.)


## New `route` directive evaluates directives in appearance order.

With the `route` directive, you can evaluate a batch of directives as a single unit in the order you specify. Normally, directive order is hard-coded into Caddy so that order of appearance in the Caddyfile doesn't matter, which makes a correct Caddyfile easier to write. But the order of evaluation of HTTP middleware _does_ matter. So if you have a specific need to deviate from the hard-coded order, you can override the internal ordering on a case-by-case basis with the `route` directive.

For example, [this problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59252769/caddy-rewrite-and-redir) can be solved easily and intuitively with an explicit route:

```
rewrite /titi /toto.png
route {
	file_server /toto.png
	redir https://anotherwebsite.com
}
```

Basically, a route block evaluates HTTP handlers literally.


## ⚠️ Matcher syntax has changed from `matcher` and `match:` to simply `@`.

Before:

```
matcher post {
	method POST
}
reverse_proxy match:post localhost:7777
```

After:

```
@post {
	method POST
}
reverse_proxy @post localhost:7777
```

This makes matchers easier and more fun.


## ⚠️ Environment variables can be substituted at either adapt-time or runtime.

To substitute environment variables as a preprocessor, use `{$VAR}` syntax:

```
{$APP_DOMAIN} {
	root * {$SITE_ROOT}
	{$OTHER_DIRECTIVES}
	file_server
}
```

That form will expand environment variables before parsing begins. This means environment variables can also expand to multiple tokens.

To substitute environment variables at runtime, continue using the standard [Caddy placeholder](https://caddyserver.com/docs/conventions#placeholders) syntax:

```
https://{env.APP_DOMAIN} {
	root * {env.SITE_ROOT}
	file_server
}
```

Notice how the site address is prepended with `https://` here; this is needed because the Caddyfile adapter doesn't know what `{env.APP_DOMAIN}` will evaluate to until runtime, so it needs a hint to know whether it's the scheme, domain name, port, or path of the address in order to construct the underlying JSON config.

You can use both forms in a Caddyfile. The first form is substituted before parsing, and the second is propagated into the final JSON and substituted at runtime.


## ⚠️ HTTP route matchers are evaluated sequentially instead of all at once.

Previously, all matchers in a route list would be evaluated at the same time, then matching routes would be chained together to form a "composite route" that handled the request. This meant that the route would be decided before any handlers have a chance to modify the request and alter the route. This approach was more declarative in its philosophy.

Now, route matchers are evaluated sequentially. This means that handlers which modify the request might affect which later routes get matched. This approach is more procedural in its philosophy.

For example, consider the following routes:

```json
[
	{
		"match": {
			"path": "/foo"
		},
		"handle": [
			{"handler": "A"},
			{"handler": "B"}
		]
	},
	{
		"match": {
			"path": "/bar"
		},
		"handle": [
			{"handler": "C"}
		]
	}
]
```

Previously, a request to `/foo` would have only matched handlers A and B, and could never reach C (unless A or B changed the request to `/bar` and then issued a "rehandle" to start over).

Now, a request to `/foo` could still reach handler C if handlers A or B change the request's path to `/bar`. Previously, this was impossible (without a rehandle) because it was already decided which routes matched and which didn't. Rehandling was very error-prone, though, so we got rid of that.

This new sequential logic may have slightly more cognitive overhead when trying to understand it, but it grants more flexibility in how routes are handled, especially as far as rewrites are concerned, and makes it easier to write correct routes.

It is still possible to batch routes together under a single match using [subroutes](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/http/servers/routes/handle/subroute/).

## New `handle` directive enables more sophisticated route composition.

If you're coming from nginx land, you are familiar with configs like this:

```
location / {
	proxy_pass ...
	...
}
location /bar {
	root ...
	...
}
```

Loosely speaking, this hypothetical config would serve static files for all requests in `/bar` and would proxy all other requests.

In Caddy, a rough equivalent would be:

```
handle {
	reverse_proxy ...
	...
}
handle /bar* {
	file_server ...
}
```

The `handle` directive contains any other HTTP directives, but only the first matching handle block is evaluated. Like `rewrite` is now, `handle` is mutually exclusive to other handle blocks on the same level.

By the way, you can nest `handle` (and `route`) directives, so although they work similar to nginx's location contexts, they are not limited to just paths! You can use any request matchers including headers, IP ranges, query strings, regular expressions, and more.

## ⚠️ New `order` option replaces `handler_order`.

The `handler_order` option let you specify the list of directives in any order you wanted, or in appearance order, but was hardly useful.

With `route` and `handle` directives, this option is not needed anymore. Instead, there's a new option called `order` that allows you to specify the order for a single directive. For example:

```
{
    order php_fastcgi last
    order redir before rewrite
}
```


This is especially useful when developing a new directive, you won't have to change the Caddy source code.

## ⚠️ `redir` now comes before `rewrite`

Before, rewrites would come before redirects (because redirects are "terminal" handlers which we try to put toward the end of the chain), but that is often problematic in practice.

Using `rewrite` is like saying, "I accept this request, but I need to transform it internally before I use it."

However, using `redir` is like saying, "I reject this request, please send it to me differently before I act on it."

Thus, I think it makes sense to put redir first in the chain, for example this real use case on the Caddy docs site:

```
redir   /docs/json   /docs/json/
rewrite /docs/json/* /docs/json/index.html
rewrite /docs/*      /docs/index.html
```

If redirects need to be issued later in the chain, one can either use `order` option (described above) _or_ use the `respond` directive to manually issue a redirect (respond comes toward the end of the chain).

```

The no matter what change I do to the config, I `POST /load` again, caddy will throw error:

```
ERROR	admin	stopping current admin endpoint	{"error": "shutting down admin server: context deadline exceeded"}
```

Then caddy dead, I can't even `caddy stop` it.

### Shorthand Placeholders

| Shorthand  | Replaces                        |
|------------|---------------------------------|
| {tls_cipher}      |  {http.request.tls.cipher_suite}              |
| {tls_version}      |  {http.request.tls.version}              |
| {tls_client_cert}      |  {http.request.tls.client.cert}              |

### Comments

1. ~~It's not clear to me if I should be using dashes or underscores for these placeholders.~~
1. Should the "client" placeholders be renamed to "peer" to match `tls.ConnectionState`?
1. I've renamed several items to be clearer (`issuer` vs `i-dn`).

I'm willing to work on a PR once we agree on the details.

### Revisions 📓 

- Use underscores instead of hyphens.
- Changed "i.e." to "e.g."
- Add underscores instead of mashing words together
- Removed `http.request.tls.client.cert_escaped`
- Changed `http.request.tls.client.cert_raw` to `http.request.tls.client.cert`
- Removed `http.request.tls.client.valid_*`
- Note that the `http.request.tls.client.fingerprint` is a SHA256 checksum.
- Use lowercase for `http.request.tls.version` result.

### Removed Items 🗑 

```text
{http.request.tls.client.cert_escaped}
	The client certificate in PEM format (url-encoded).
{http.request.tls.client.valid_end}
	The end date of the client certificate (e.g. "Jan 02 15:04:05 2006 UTC").
{http.request.tls.client.valid_days}
	The number of days remaining before the end date of the client certificate.
{http.request.tls.client.valid_start}
	The start date of client certificate (e.g. "Jan 02 15:04:05 2006 UTC").

As requested in [this forum thread](https://caddy.community/t/proxy-cache-with-redis-storage-and-serving-stale/6689/2), I want to be able to use caddy as a reverse caching proxy which makes an service more resilient to outages of the origin server, so that if the origin goes down or responds with errors, caddy serves old content.

Specifically:

1. I only want http 200 responses to be cached 
2. If an origin server responds with http 5xx, I want to serve stale content from the cache.

Also attaching a corresponding nginx.conf which achieves what I want for reference.

[nginx.conf.gz](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/files/4006859/nginx.conf.gz)
This adds support for small step certificate authority on the same machine.

In the case where small step is not configured locally it will provision a local small step configuration. This will include the password in plain text, this is unavoidable I believe.

Specifying the `ca.local` is a special case it will use the local small step configuration.

Caddyfile

```
test1.sarge.com:9443 {
  tls {
    ca ca.local
  }
}
```

Some minor nitpicks - small step added a dependency on `newrelic`.
A random warning is generated by certmagic when attempting to delete expired certificates.

I use `reverse_proxy` and `rewrite` handle to proxy admin rest api endpoint `localhost:2019` as path `localhost:2020/caddy2-api`, then I use the endpoint `'localhost:2020/caddy2-api` to add route for other server and will wait the connection reply forover

the step to report
save the below content to `caddy.json`, and `caddy2 run -config caddy.json`, then use the last section curl code check this problem
```json

  "disabled": false,
  "listen": "localhost:2019",

} } 
}
``` 
Get the first route from `example-sever`
```sh
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:2019/config/apps/http/servers/example-server/routes
```
Add Route to `example-sever`
```sh
# Add Route through reverse proxy api. if without -m timeout param the connection will wait for forever
curl -i -m 5 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"handle": [{ "handler": "static_response", "body": "response" }]}' -X POST http://localhost:2020/caddy-api/config/apps/http/servers/example-server/routes
# Check routes and found the route had been added
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:2020/caddy-api/config/apps/http/servers/example-server/routes
# Add Route through api, this is fine
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"handle": [{ "handler": "static_response", "body": "response" }]}' -X POST http://localhost:2019/config/apps/http/servers/example-server/routes
# cehck routes and this is fine
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:2019/config/apps/http/servers/example-server/routes
```
Del Route from `example-sever`
```sh
# Delete Route through reverse proxy api. if without -m timeout param the connection will wait for forever
curl -i -m 5 -X DELETE http://localhost:2020/caddy-api/config/apps/http/servers/example-server/routes/2
# Check routes and found the route had been deleted
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:2020/caddy-api/config/apps/http/servers/example-server/routes
# Delete Route through api, this is fine
curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:2019/config/apps/http/servers/example-server/routes/1
# cehck routes and this is fine
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:2019/config/apps/http/servers/example-server/routes
```

Adds support for loading a custom root ca file via the caddyfile.

```
tls [off|<cert> <key>] {
	load <folders...>
	protocols <min> [<max>]
	ciphers <list...>
	curves <list...>
	alpn <list...>
        ca <url>
        ca_root <file>
}
```
