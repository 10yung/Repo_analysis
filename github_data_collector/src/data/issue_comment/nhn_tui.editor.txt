<!-- BUG ISSUE TEMPLATE -->
## Version 1.4.10
<!-- Write the version of the tui-editor you are currently using. -->

## Test Environment
<!-- Write the browser type, OS and so on -->
Mac OS, Safari

## Current Behavior
<!-- Write steps to reproduce the current behaviour in detail.
You can add sample code, 'CodePen' or 'jsfiddle' links. -->
In Safari, when you add checkbox (Task) in WYSIWYG mode, when you move the cursor to the checkbox, the pointer is not changed to "hand" icon. But in Chrome, it will changed to "hand" icon when point to the checkbox

## Expected Behavior
Same as Chrome that show "hand" icon when mouse over checkbox.
<!-- Write a description for future action. -->

## Version
1.3.0

## Development Environment
Windows and Mac: Chrome, Firefox, and edge.

## Current Behavior
When a user puts a \<mark> tag in the markdown tab it shows the text highlight correctly on the preview, but when the tab is switched to the wysiwyg the highlight disappears. The tag is no longer on the text when you go back to the markdown tab.

## Expected Behavior
The mark tag stays in place like html tags or is a special type like italic and bold.
##  Description
If after a Line there is a ```<br>``` and after that some other text, the getMarkdown function add an extra ```<br>```.

## To Reproduce
1. Go to https://nhn.github.io/tui.editor/latest/tutorial-example01-editor-basic
2. Switch mode to WYSIWYG
3. Add a Line with toolbar button
4. Press enter
5. Add some text
6. Switch mode to Markdown
7. Switch mode to WYSIWYG
8. Repeat from 6 how many times you want

## Version
1.4.10
hey @nhn! A quick question about some funny behavior. I'm finding that when I copy paste content (and maybe sometimes when I've been typing a lot) it's not possible to scroll to the very top (or sometimes) bottom of the editor. I usually need to start over, refreshing the page, or move the cursor blindly to the bottom to add a bunch more newlines. Do you know why this might be happening, and how to prevent it? Thank you!
