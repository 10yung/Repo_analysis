Hi, I cannot build docker-sync with ubuntu instruction on arch. Is there a guide somewhere that I can look up as with ubuntu instructions I am getting the following error:

```
File "/tmp/unison-2.51.2/src/system.ml", line 1:

### Error

When docker sync is started in the background, which is default since 7e324508c12103621af42774f8045479867c7ee8
rsync logs by deault to `./.docker-sync/daemon.log` in the local directory, enabled in d9187726986e1175b24babcfed009af27c5977cd. 

If the local directory or file is synced, this information is logged to that log file, which causes the log file to be synced itself, which causes another write to the log file and so on. This ends up in a "sync loop" which consumes remarkable CPU resources (depending on the size of the log file which is always appended).

This can be avoided by excluding that log file from syncing in the config file (in `sync_excludes`), but it might make sense to exclude it already by default or mention it in the default config.

Hi, 
I am trying to setup docker sync in Windows. I have gone through `https://docker-sync.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html` but was not successful in making it work. Then I decided to subscribe for windows insider slow ring with wsl2 to see if thing were different be in both attempts I cam to the same problem that looks like this.

I kinda see that it can't find a volumes directory but am not sure what to do to get it to work. Please help spent 20 hours fiddling with it but can't get it to work. Thanks in advance.

```yaml
version: "2" # Version of docker-sync, not docker-compose.
options:
  compose-file-path:
    - 'docker-compose.yml'
    - './config/docker/docker-compose-elasticsearch.yml'
    # - './config/docker/docker-compose-kibana.yml'
  compose-dev-file-path:
    - './config/docker/docker-compose-sync-backend.yml'
    - './config/docker/docker-compose-sync-frontend.yml'
```

Our project uses `compose-file-path` as a way for developers to optionally enable docker-compose configs.  In this above example, the developer has opted not to run kibana.  This works well for that purpose.

The problem is that `docker-compose` is now hampered as it cannot interact with the elasticsearch container.  Running `docker-compose ps` will not show the elasticsearch container as it's not contained in the default `docker-compose.yml`.  The workaround is to manually specify all compose files currently enabled, e.g. `docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml -f ./config/docker/docker-compose-elasticsearch.yml ps`.  This gets tedious and defeats the simplicity of using `compose-file-path`.

Possible solutions:
* Wrap docker-sync-stack as an indirect interface to docker-compose.  Running `docker-sync-stack ps` would be expanded to `docker-compose` with all `-f` files specified in `compose-file-path`.
* A simpler option would be offer a docker-sync-stack CLI option to print out all compose-file-path.  This approach would allow a bash alias to format the returned list and pass the options to docker-compose.  Then at least, the list is programmatically driven.

### Error/Feature Requestion/Docs
When using `native_osx` all files belong to group root.
This is known and documented, but it would be nice if it could be fixed.

Looking at the `unison` sync strategy code, it's not possible to set the group with `unison`.
I wonder if it's possible to do something with `native_osx` by having the right user and group on the sync container.

### Docs
After just discovering that this project has a patreon how do you feel about adding some kind of information about how to support the project in the readme.

While I'm happy for Github to have implemented sponsorships. The UI pop-up isn't very clear. I got confused clicking through to the `Apply to the beta` link. Which leads you to joining the waiting list.

Love to put together a PR if you agree with adding something to the docs. I'm sure those in the community who can, would love to help support where possible.
