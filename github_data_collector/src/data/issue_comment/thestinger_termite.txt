If a URL is quoted the URL passed to the browser contains the end quote character:
Example:

'http://www.freedesktop.org/' , if hovering over the URL the following text is underlined and sent to the broweser if clicked:  http://www.freedesktop.org/'
Note the ending single-quote character.

 
Added a new flag, `-x` or `--greedy` to signal that the user wants to redirect unused termite arguments to exec's command.

Usage:
`termite -ex nvim myfile.txt`
`termite -e nvim --greedy myfile1.txt myfile2.txt`
`termite -ex nvim -- -xyz myfile.txt` (`-xyz` will be redirected to nvim, since they are placed after the `--`. If they were placed before, termite would error out claiming to have found a unknown option, which makes sense)
I have `urgent_on_bell` set. When using swaywm (Wayland), the window does not get urgent state. It works under i3wm (Xorg).
If in an url ends in parenthesis+dot, it uses it for opening the link (e.g. `(https://github.com/thestinger/termite).` will open `https://github.com/thestinger/termite/).`
I saw that VTE has add bidi support, as did gnome-terminal. [https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/issues/53]()
since termite is a VTE-based terminal, is there a way to add bidi-support to termite as well? 
if someone would want to direct me, maybe I will try to implement that myself. 
I don't have any experience with gtk/vte but i know my way in c++.
I liked the look of xterm, and wanted to try to make termite look like
that, so I wrote

	font = Fixed 9
	
But the result looks nothing like xterm.	

I played with [this](https://github.com/Difrex/gosway/tree/master/swaymgr) project and noticed that its spiral layout doesn't work with termite. The source of this issue is termite itself: sway thinks termite's window has size of 0x0. Other VTE-based terminals' size is determined correctly.
I'm using URL selection a lot via Ctrl-Shift-Space and then hitting `u` until I get to desired URL so I can copy it. But for some reason it doesn't work with a particular text (it's an RSS summary).  
Reproduction:  
1. Copy this text to a file:

2. In `termite`, `cat` that file.
3. Press Ctrl-Shift-Space and hit `u` several times - termite skips "https://oper.ru/video/audio/interview_napoleon16.mp3" URL. Works fine with similar URLs in other UTF-8 texts with Cyrillic characters, but not with this one.

I am trying to install termite on Ubuntu 18.04 following [this guide](http://epsi-rns.github.io/desktop/2016/09/19/termite-install.html). Compilling and installing VTE goes fine, but termite itself fails to compile. There is a series of error messages on undeclared methods. The full output is [here](https://pastebin.com/kVxHhzfT).

Any clues on what may be wrong?
