It is a bit not clear whether encoder has own internal buffer like C library.
This panic happens when I feed empty `next_out_array` slice, and want to use `BrotliEncoderTakeOutput` result to write data without using own temporarely storage.

So just wanted to clarify if `BrotliEncoderCompressStream` can be used with empty `next_out_array`

P.s. it also seem to happen only when I push multiple chunks

Hello, Cargo.toml lists BSD OR MIT, however LICENSE file contains only info about BSD... Who is right?
