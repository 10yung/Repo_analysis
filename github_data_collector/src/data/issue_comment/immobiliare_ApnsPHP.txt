From sample_push_many.php lines 45-47 a comment reads:
```
// To speed up the sending operations, use Zero as parameter but
// some messages may be lost.
```

What is the technical reason for messages getting lost?

I’m looking to speed up the performance of my sending (it’s too slow for production) and after reading a [Technical Note](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2265/_index.html) from Apple, they suggest to avoid checking for an error response every time I write. So instead of checking every time, I’m going to do it at some interval (i.e. 25,000 sends).

Knowing this, does it make sense to have a write interval in this use case? My original thought was the write interval’s purpose was to give the fread() enough time to capture an error response. But that may not be the intention, as it could be there to prevent some sort of sending limit via the socket.

```

```
any idea why the above error is throwing?
Hi, I've changed some PHP keywords to comply with [this standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/#25-keywords-and-truefalsenull) in PSR2. It's admittedly a small fix but I hope it helps!
Hello

after the translation of website to utf-8, push no longer sent
Writes: Internal error (127 by written in instead of 105 bytes)

If I try to send in Latin, it sends 3 push (i received its push-messages) and writes its an error.

If I try to send a Cyrillic symbols at UTF-8, then I get an error and the push does not come.

If in the Push.php file I change the line 
$nLen = strlen ($aMessage ['BINARY_NOTIFICATION']);
to $nLen = mb_strlen($aMessage ['BINARY_NOTIFICATION'], 'latin1');
push in Latin comes successfully and there are no errors

Cyrillic does not reach (but does not show errors)

$ nLen = mb_strlen construction ($ aMessage ['BINARY_NOTIFICATION'], 'utf-8'); 
Does not help. how to be?

(sorry fo my english)
Fixes #59, as well as an issue I ran into where code was attempting to load PHPUnit classes using the ApnsPHP autoloader.
I would propose that the classes are structured under a namespace.
Like Immobiliare\ApnsPHP
While using userNotificationCenter didReceive to get clicks on a notification, I can't seem to get these custom properties anywhere? Is this not what these properties are for? I'm trying to use it so I can direct the user to a specific page of the app based on the set property. Any help is greatly appreciated.
Hi,
I've two types of tokens long and short
First I got invalid token back and then I upgraded the library and now I get back invalid payload size.
All Tokens are 64 bit but one is 72 bit.

Please help me
https://github.com/immobiliare/ApnsPHP/blob/f7c9c2c29e413a65d3580421bf3bb4809fd671e2/ApnsPHP/Message.php#L78

We see some users 108 char length push token in our database. So I think we must change this line.
is it possible to send push with image? Using this library?
As i read it should be possible from ios 10+ https://www.appboy.com/blog/ios-10-rich-notifications/ 

> iOS 10 brings support for rich content in push notifications, empowering you to deliver significantly more engaging content directly to your users. You’ll be able to deliver compelling content that includes images, GIFs, and videos

Could you please leave a couple of words about push with images for the beginner?
