I tried numerous times.
First batch of tracks loads, but when pressing "Load More", all that happens is that spinning circle animation appears. It does not load more tracks regardless of how long I wait.
Why does player use **>>** as an icon for next track instead of **>|**?
I believe that first one is more widely used as "fast forward" button while later one usually represnets the "skip to next track".
Even emoticons named "fast forward" ( :fast_forward: ) and "next track button" ( :next_track_button: ) reflect that.
In my oopinion it would be good to change current button icons for the ones that better indicate their function.

<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [lodash's releases](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/releases).*

> ## 4.0.0
> # [lodash v4.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400)
> 
> 2015 was big year! [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) became the [most depended on](https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491#file-01-most-dependent-upon-md) npm package, passed [1 billion](http://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=&author=jdalton) downloads, & its v3 release saw massive adoption!
> 
> The year was also one of collaboration, as discussions began on [merging Lodash & Underscore](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/underdash/underdash/issues/14). Much of Lodash v4 is proofing out the ideas from those discussions. Lodash v4 **would not be possible** without the collaboration & contributions of the Underscore core team. In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with [several members](https://github.com/orgs/lodash/people) contributing to both libraries.
> 
> For 2016 & [lodash v4.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400) we wanted to cut loose, push forward, & take things up a notch!
> 
> ## Modern only
> 
> With v4 weâ€™re breaking free from [old projects](https://github.com/lodash-archive), old environments, & dropping [old IE < 9 support](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support)!
> 
> ## 4 kB Core
> 
> Lodashâ€™s kitchen-sink size will continue to grow as new methods & functionality are added. However, we now offer a 4 kB (gzipped) [core build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0/dist) thatâ€™s compatible with [Backbone v1.2.4](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/3839) for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink.
> 
> ## More ES6
> 
> Weâ€™ve continued to embrace ES6 with methods like [_.isSymbol](https://lodash.com/docs#isSymbol), added support for cloning & comparing array buffers, maps, sets, & symbols, converting iterators to arrays, & iterable `_(â€¦)`.
> 
> In addition, weâ€™ve published an [es-build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0-es/) & pulled [babel-plugin-lodash](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash) into core to make tree-shaking a breeze.
> 
> ## More Modular
> 
> Pop quiz! ðŸ“£
> 
> What category path does the `bindAll` method belong to? Is it 
> 
> A) `require('lodash/function/bindAll')`
> B) `require('lodash/utility/bindAll')`
> C) `require('lodash/util/bindAll')`
> 
> Donâ€™t know? Well, with v4 it doesnâ€™t matter because now module paths are as simple as
> 
> ``` js
> var bindAll = require('lodash/bindAll');
> ```
> 
> Weâ€™ve also reduced module complexity making it easier to create smaller bundles. This has helped Lodash adoption with libraries like [Async](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/caolan/async/pull/996) & [Redux](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rackt/redux/pull/611)!
> 
> ## 1st Class FP
> 
> With v3 we introduced [lodash-fp](https://github.com/lodash-archive/lodash-fp). We learned a lot & with v4 we decided to [pull it into core](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide).
> 
> Now you can get immutable, auto-curried, iteratee-first, data-last methods as simply as
> 
> ``` js
> var _ = require('lodash/fp');
> var object = { 'a': 1 };
></tr></table> ... (truncated)

Soundcloud posts don't seem to autoplay; they just stop the player until I manually go and hit play again, and then a second time. I see the soundcloud player flash, and then start playing.

Like this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/chillstep/comments/bf50bz/big_gigantic_feat_angela_mccluskey_the_little/
Has anyone tried implementing a Spotify button in case the songs are on Spotify? 

I would love to implement if you'd like . . .  
It would be good to have the option to automatically skip tracks that have votes below a certain threshold.

The main use case would be because occasionally tracks are posted in the wrong subreddits, the moderators won't necessarily remove those posts but the community will down vote them so they have 0-1% upvote.

But also if I wanted to just listen to high quality tracks, then I might want to choose to skip everything below 60% upvotes for example.
This file is linked to from the README but it doesn't exist.
