When focusing on a contentEditable TextLayer, the blinking cursor doesn't show up, although it behaves correctly otherwise.

Interestingly, if setup is set to true, it does show up.

Example that will reproduce:

```
# The layer
text = new TextLayer
  width: 200 # nonessential to reproduce
  height: 200 # nonessential to reproduce
  contentEditable: true
  text: ""

# Focus and behold.... no blinking cursor :'(
text._element.focus()
```

Framer keeps lumping all my text together.

Here's my code:

```
{TextLayer} = require 'TextLayer'

book_summary = $.Book_Summary.convertToTextLayer()
verses = $.Verses.convertToTextLayer()
```

I'm pretty sure I'm doing it right, but maybe note. This is my first time using this.

Having an issue just making one of the words bold in my layer. Any ideas?

I set a TextLayer with width, height,or any size come with autosize.
But when I copy the layer it didn't copy all those size as well,
all of them reset their size.

I'm using textLayer to create a convo UI. I'm wanting to use  `autoSize` and `autoSizeHight` together, but there seems to be a default width being applied? is there a way to have the textLayer set both width and height based on the content?

click square two times - when it goes to default state, animation is not right

First off, great module, I use it extensively! I've noticed that if I convert a Sketch layer with `convertToTextLayer()`, I have to do `layer.color = layer.style.color` in order to prevent the text from being set to `'red'` if I copy it via `layer.copy()`. Not sure if this also applies to other CSS styles, but I also noticed that a converted text layer does not keep the original layer's index in the layer list.

Hi there!

First of all, thanks a ton for your Framer module, I use it quite a lot. I stumbled upon a bug in Chrome though, I know it might not be great to test Framer prototypes in Chrome but I figured I'd report it :)
