When I rotate the screen, the unsaved data are gone. This happens on several Samsung models, including A9s.
1. Right now the program apparently could not search folders by name, only files are searched. Could please folders be made searchable too?
2. When file is found, it is quite often to me when I want to open the parent folder containing this file and not the file itself. The parent folder is shown in search results but it is not clickable/open from search results.

Can these two points please be addressed?
As it is now, it requires two presses of the back key to exit the app.

As I am sure you have your reasons for this, a nice addition for some would be the additional option of a single long press of the back key to exit the app.
When a search reveals multiple files with the same name in different folders and all of them are selected for "Copy To", only one file is copied to the target folder (or all copied files overwrite each other, not sure).

Would be nice, if the copy to method would rename the files automatically,
for example by adding a suffix to the filenames.

I can't move or copy something from Internal Memory or SDCard, to any Root Path.

(example: data/data/org.mozilla.firefox)

In the preview of the folder says "0 items", if I open it, nothing happens.
I'm using Simple File Manager version 6.3.2, installed through FDroid on an LineageOS 16.0 (Android 9).

I have a `.bin` file that I want to open with Gadgetbridge.  
Gadgetbridge is allowed to read external storage:

    # dumpsys package nodomain.freeyourgadget.gadgetbridge | grep STORAGE
          android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
            android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: granted=true

In most directories below `/sdcard` it works as expected: I tap the file and it opens in Gadgetbridge no problem. But in some directories Gadgetbridge fails to read the file. In logcat I can see an IOException thrown by Gadgetbridge:

    java.io.IOException: Unable to retrieve metadata for: content://media/external/file/17053: Unable to retrieve name for: content://media/external/file/17053

So, it apparently has problems reading that file...!? _(Where does the 17053 come from? Can I trace that back to the file system? Maybe that may help to debug or to make sure that Gadgetbridge is trying to read the correct file?)_

From a root shell (through adb), the FS permissions look exactly the same...

    drwxrwx--x  3 root sdcard_rw     <- for the directory
    -rw-rw----  1 root sdcard_rw     <- for the file

The only difference in this case: The directories, where Gadgetbridge is not able to read the file, are synchronised using *Syncthing...*  
And it seems like I can reproduce this. If I start synchronising a directory, which was fine for Gadgetbridge, will make it unavailable for Gadgetbridge.

I'm not sure if that is a bug in Simple-File-Manager, or an issue in Syncthing or in Gadgetbridge, but if I use the internal file manager to open the `.bin` file with Gadgetbridge it works just fine... Opening photos in synced directories also works fine through Simple-File-Manager.. (Not sure what else to test..?)

I already suspected Syncthing's `.stfolder` may cause the problem, but when I manually create that directory it still works fine..

Do you have any ideas what may cause this problem? Let me know if I can help debugging things :)
add "display line#" option to File Editor
If you are copying more than one file it takes quite a lot of taps to switch back and forth between different folders. 

My suggestion for improving UI:
Make a home where you have shortcuts to internal / external SD, favorites (feature request by user tippi which I highly recommend), root (if phone is rooted), remote folders (if implemented) and open these folders in new tabs. Make small icons to identify place (internal SD, external SD, network, cloud storage or custom icon if set) and name tab with path or last part of path if too long. To access folders either allow tapping on label or swiping left / right.
Please allow for more than two open tabs (up to 12?).

That was the way it was done in ES file explorer (I already mentioned I loved that app, version 3.2.5.5 if you want to have a look to get the idea). I still think it was the best user interface of all file browsers apps out there before they started spying on everything.

Thx
