As we are using this plugin to get a quick view on how much we are commiting, (and also we are using StyleCI) would be nice to ignore somehow the auto-commits made from some code review tools...

Thanks!

When trying to run `tiny-care-terminal` inside a pane in GNU Screen (using either `screen` on its own or `byobu` with the GNU Screen backend), `tiny-care-terminal` doesn't draw within the pane, but overspills its boundaries (see screenshots below). This only happens when using the cool-retro-term emulator ([link](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term)), and not in the default terminal.

- **Node Version**: `v9.5.0`
- **tiny-core-terminal version**: `1.3.2`
- **Shell**: `fish`
- **Terminal Program**: `byobu` (GNU Screen backend) or `screen` running in `cool-retro-term`.
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

When running in `byobu`:

When running with `screen` on its own:

Just a small feature request, but it's easy to lose track of the Pomodoro timer if we don't keep an eye on the terminal. Having a bell ring on completion would help keep track of the elapsed time.

- **Node Version**: `v6.11.4`
- **tiny-core-terminal version**: `1.3.2`
- **Shell**: `bash/dash`
- **Terminal Program**: `GNOME terminal`
- **Operating System**: `Linux (Ubuntu 17.10)`

Thank you!

Just as a sanity check, did you run `npm install -g git-standup`? A lot of the installation
problems we're seeing is because that step was skipped.

If you _did_ run it and you're still having problems, follow the template below to ensure a more accurate response to your issue.
Yes, I did these things.

- **Node Version**: `node --version`
v. 8.3.0
- **tiny-core-terminal version**: `npm info tiny-care-terminal | grep version:`
1.3.2
- **Shell**: `bash, zsh, fish, something else?`
zsh using `oh-my-zsh`
- **Terminal Program**: `tmux, iterm, terminator, cmd, something else?`
iTerm
- **Operating System**: `Mac, Windows, Linux, BSD, Really, something else?`
macOS 10.12.6

I am getting an error `Could not open directory directory:  ~/Desktop/Git_Repositories/YelpCamp`
All my repos are in one folder on my desktop. Not certain what happened. It wouldn't log commits to YelpCamp yesterday, updated today and it tells me it can't open the directory. I would assume it is something wrong with the directory itself but I've checked permissions and all seems well.

I also just updated Node to the latest version. Maybe that's the issue?

`git-standup` is installed and I did not use `yarn`.

Thanks for your help! I love this.

Thank you!

Uses [node-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-storage) to keep track of pomodoro history. Stores each pomodoro with it's start and end date.

The Pomodoro mode is awesome! 
It would be awesome if there was a total pomodoros done count that shows how many pomodors were accomplished during current day.
Hey @notwaldorf! Thanks for taking the time to build and open source this awesome tool! I love it.

I tend to keep my terminal split into multiple panes, and I noticed the commits graph seems to have rendering issues when in smaller viewports, so I thought it would be helpful if I could easily hide it via environment variables (sort of aligns with #109). I do still like having the total number of commits easily visible for a given day and week, so I added them to the Today and Week box labels when the commits graph is hidden. Here's a quick look:

The PR itself mostly just consists of introducing the new config value and adjusting the size of the boxes accordingly, as well as adding the total number of commits to the box labels.

Let me know what you think!

This is definitely a nice-to-have, but it would be great if Tiny Care Terminal resized dynamically when you changed the size of your Terminal window!

- **Node Version**: v8.1.2
- **tiny-core-terminal version**: 1.3.1
- **Shell**: bash
- **Terminal Program**: cmd? I have no idea.
- **Operating System**: Linux

I've done a little shell script to put in my terminal's initial source file (.zshrc in my case):

```bash
# Tiny care terminal
export TTC_SAY_BOX="ironman"
export TTC_WEATHER="VÃ¡rzea Grande, Brazil"
export TTC_GITBOT="gitlog"

function work() {
  answer="Y"

  if [[ -z "$1" || ("$1" != "-y" && "$1" != "-Y") ]]; then
    echo -n "Wanna start work? (Y/n) "
    read answer
  fi

  if [[ -z "$answer" || "$answer" = "Y" || "$answer" = "y" ]]; then
    echo -n "Tell me some local git repos (separated by comma): "
    read repos

    ttc_repos=""
    ifsbak=$IFS
    IFS=","
    for repo in `echo "$repos"`; do
      if [[ "$ttc_repos" != "" ]]; then
        ttc_repos="$ttc_repos,"
      fi
      ttc_repos="$ttc_repos$HOME/Projects/$repo"
    done
    IFS=$ifsbak

    TTC_REPOS="$ttc_repos" tiny-care-terminal
  else
    echo "Ok, if you need me, just enter 'work'. See ya..."
  fi
}

work
```

If it isn't helpful, please just close this issue.
