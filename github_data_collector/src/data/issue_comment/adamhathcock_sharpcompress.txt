The API example shows how to create a .tar.bz2 file

```
using (Stream stream = File.OpenWrite(tarbz2Path))
using (var writer = WriterFactory.Open(stream, ArchiveType.Tar, CompressionType.BZip2))
{
	zipWriter.Write(Path.GetFileName(filename), filename);
}
```

Since there's no ArchiveType.None, How can I compress a single file to .bz2 directly? Similar to unix command `bzip2 -9 test.txt`



In reader, it is judged that the tar file uses gzip stream.

But in archive, the. .tar.gz file becomes a gzip file.

At this time, all entities are empty.

I couldn't find anywhere in tararchive to set up its file stream.
SevenZipFilePart.GetCompressedStream skips all the previous files in the Folder. This involves decompressing them and discarding the decompressed data. So when reading the content of the Entries in order we keep decompressing the same data that we have already decompressed for every subsequent entry in the same CFolder! May I suggest that the folder stream be cached, e. g. by only re-creating if we need to read an entry earlier in the folder than the last one, so we don't end up like Shlemiel the Painter.

>    Shlemiel gets a job as a street painter, painting the dotted lines down the middle of the road. On the first day he takes a can of paint out to the road and finishes 300 yards of the road. “That’s pretty good!” says his boss, “you’re a fast worker!” and pays him a kopeck.
>
>    The next day Shlemiel only gets 150 yards done. “Well, that’s not nearly as good as yesterday, but you’re still a fast worker. 150 yards is respectable,” and pays him a kopeck.
>
>    The next day Shlemiel paints 30 yards of the road. “Only 30!” shouts his boss. “That’s unacceptable! On the first day you did ten times that much work! What’s going on?”
>
>    “I can’t help it,” says Shlemiel. “Every day I get farther and farther away from the paint can!”
Hi All

     I need to know that RAR file is password protected or not before it upload to the server.Can you please give information on this.

Thanks & Regards.
Thus when using ReaderFactory.Open I get an error of

> Cannot determine compressed stream type. Supported Reader Formats: Zip, GZip, BZip2, Tar, Rar, LZip, XZ
Hello, I am getting exception 

```
SharpCompress.Common.InvalidFormatException: Invalid Rar Header: 251 at SharpCompress.Common.Rar.Headers.RarHeaderFactory.ReadNextHeader(Stream stream)
```

SharpCompress: 0.24  
[examples.zip](https://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress/files/3778746/examples.zip) contains two rar files. Can extract them using 7zip or WinRar (5.71)  but no luck with SharpCompress =(

Maybe these are RAR 5 archives which are not supported at the moment (it is stated in TODOS list on a main page)


Need to use async IO now.  Guidance for ASP.NET spells it out: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/performance-best-practices

Look to where ValueTask can be used
Unable to extract certain .rar files.  Getting error message "Invalid Rar Header: 131" But i could extract few files with same code. Unable to extract files compressed using WinRAR 5.61 (64 bit)
