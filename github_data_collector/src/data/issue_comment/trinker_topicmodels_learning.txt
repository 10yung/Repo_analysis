I'm a little new to programming in R; I'm just trying to do a simple ANOVA for my lab's ant abundance data based on microhabitat. We don't have an equal number of samples for our microhabitat but I thought R was robust enough that it would not be an issue. Also, another labmate and I temporarily deleted some of the extra samples so the sample sizes would match, but that did not fix the error. I've attached some of the data I've been using as an example.

Here is the code where I've been running into issues:
poca_d18<-file.choose()
fit_aov1<-aov(poca_d18$poca~poca_d18$hab,data=poca_d18)
summary(fit_aov1)
TukeyHSD(fit_aov1)
I can't get past the second line of code because I get the error message "Error in eval(predvars, data, env) : invalid 'envir' argument of type 'character' "
I'm sure it's something simple that I've just glossed over. I've done ANOVAs in the past. I don't know why this is giving me so much trouble. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks.

I am getting an error. Can you explain why? Thanks.
