### What version of `dep` are you using (`dep version`)?
<!--
  If you installed `dep` via `go get`, report the version instead with
  `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/golang/dep && git describe --tags`
-->
```
dep version
dep:
 version     : v0.5.4
 build date  : 2019-09-29
 git hash    : 1f7c19e
 go version  : go1.13
 go compiler : gc
 platform    : darwin/amd64
 features    : ImportDuringSolve=false
```

### What `dep` command did you run?

<!--

Paste the output of the commands you ran in here, making sure to pass -v for maximum context.

-->
```
dep ensure -v
```

### What did you expect to see?

successful -- this is my first time using `dep`

### What did you see instead?

It hang:
```
dep ensure -v
# Bringing vendor into sync
```
After a long time (20m - 1h) (I have been uninstall and reinstall `go` and `dep` and test this all day), I hit ^C and get:
```
dep ensure -v
# Bringing vendor into sync
c^CSignal received: waiting for 1 ops to complete...
grouped write of manifest, lock and vendor: failed to export github.com/hashicorp/vault:
	(1) failed to list versions for https://github.com/hashicorp/vault: : signal: interrupt
	(2) context canceled
	(3) context canceled
	(4) context canceled
``` 
There is a bad link on the master branch readme (https://github.com/golang/dep/blob/master/README.md) in the section for Windows users looking to download dep.

The link is bolded in this sentence below and currently points to https://go.equinox.io/github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep which returns a 404 code

- On Windows, you can download a tarball from **go.equinox.io**.

Update vendor/golang.org/x/sys to 33540a1f6037 which brings in necessary freebsd/arm64 bits.
### What does this do / why do we need it?
This is an alternative proposition for using personal access token with dep

### What should your reviewer look out for in this PR?

### Do you need help or clarification on anything?

### Which issue(s) does this PR fix?
This could be a suitable solution for #264

Howdy! NetBSD support would be amazing. Thanks!
Hi,

Is there any issue with the package ?

Cheers,
