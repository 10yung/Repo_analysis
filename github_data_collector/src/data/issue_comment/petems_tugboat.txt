We use tugboat on our build server which spins droplet before running our test. I started noticing the error **Failed to create Droplet: found unpermitted parameters: backups_enabled** during droplet creation.

I am able to reproduce the issue in my local machine as well after I installed Tugboat 4.1.0 and ran **tugboat create pearkes-www-002 -s 2gb -r nyc3 -i 45439794** from the terminal.

Following is the debug info:-

* You can disable colour output for Thor with the environmental variables with `THOR_SHELL=Basic`
* However, this only works for `say ‘hello’, :green`, it won’t apply for custom strings with colour constants in them
* So we add the environmental lookup to our colour code as well!
* Closes #93
* Stops bundle-audit from complaining
* Thor updated for dependancies (0.19.4)
Right now we haven't kept parity with DigitalOcean's new API features in the API gem we're using  Barge (See #249, #248)

At the time we moved, DigitalOcean didn't have a Gem for the API.

Now there is! https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet_kit/

The API for accessing is almost 1:1, plus it's maintained by DO themselves. It would make sense to move over to this so we don't have to implement all the new endpoints in barge.

If this is already in the works that would be wonderful. If someone is already working on this feel free to comment here.

It would be nice if the ability to list and remove  snapshots of a droplet  using the tugboat app as the site is workable for me but annoying to work with from an accessibility stand point, plus the command line is better for me to see if something broke.

Thoughts?

I'm new to tugboat and am loving it.  I wonder though can the block storage thing be supported now that it is out of beta? I know  that digital ocean's api supports  that and I've ben using it. However tugboat for me is an easier interface as I  can control my droplet on my mac with out using digital ocean's less then stellar website for screen readers. I should add I used homebrew to install tugboat, so hope that helps a bit.

I'm a member of 2 DO teams and I can only see Droplets for one of my teams.

It would be nice to also support manipulation of domain records matching just the domain name instead of the domain id like the api supports

While the colorized output of `tugboat droplets` is nice when visually inspecting the output, it can cause problems when one wants to use the command in scripts (either logging information to a file, or using it to check the status of a droplet).

An option to disable color would be helpful, as would making `tugboat` behave more like other software that automatically disables color codes when `stdout` is not attached to a tty.

When running `tugboat ssh` there is no way to tell tugboat output from ssh one.
