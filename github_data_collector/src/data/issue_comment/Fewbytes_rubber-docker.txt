are they still on?
rawgit is dying :/
We should probably switch to GitHub Pages
got two issues when tried to build the packer image on eu-central-1:

1. `amazon-ebs:   Process: 4204 ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker daemon -H fd:// --storage-driver overlay (code=exited, status=125)` the docker service fails to start with overlay storage driver
2. `amazon-ebs: E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)
    amazon-ebs: E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
` failed to apt-get update

Added a packer template to generate lab VM on VMware using Ubuntu
16.04 as base.  Made minor changes to bootstrap.sh to accomodate
more recent Ubuntu release including installing extra packages
required for Ubuntu 16.04 and to skip update of grub menu.lst, which
no longer exists. Added preseed.cfg file to create sudo-enabled
ubuntu account required for lab.  Added README.md to document usage
and edited top-level README.md to refer to VMware as well as AWS.

(Build procedure tested for both VMware as well as existing AMI packer script,
which is renamed but otherwise unchanged.)
Hi!

Your docker lab is excellent.  Some of us work with VMware, hence prefer to use a VMware virtual machine image rather than Amazon for the lab exercises.  I committed changes containing packer files to generate VMware images and will submit a PR in a few minutes for your consideration.  I verified that the script changes do not affect generation of AMIs, which still work as before.  

I hope that once this PR is accepted it will make rubber-docker more accessible to the VMware community including folks at VMware itself. 

Thanks again for the great work.

Hi folks ! 

Please, find attach here a set of modifications so we can run these awesome examples on Azure.

- Add instructions on how to build an image on Azure

Please let me know if this is ok,

Thanks,
