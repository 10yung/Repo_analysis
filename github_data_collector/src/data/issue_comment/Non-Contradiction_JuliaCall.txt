This PR wants to support more Julia plot packages in RMarkdown document like PyPlots.

If the PR is finished, then things like 
```
using PyPlot
# use x = linspace(0,2*pi,1000) in Julia 0.6
x = range(0; stop=2*pi, length=1000); y = sin.(3 * x + 4 * cos.(2 * x));
plot(x, y, color="red", linewidth=2.0, linestyle="--")
title("A sinusoidally modulated sinusoid")
```
should give a plot in a julia chunk in an RMarkdown document.


<!--- Did you remember to include tests? Unless you're just changing
grammar, please include new tests for your change -->

I can run the following code in Julia 1.2.0 console and it works fine - that is, it saves the figure as expected.

using PyPlot
clf();
ioff();
x1 = collect(0:0.1:2)
x2a = 1 .- 0.5*x1
x2b = ifelse.(2 .- 2*x1.>=0, 2 .- 2*x1,0)

fig, ax = subplots();

ax.fill_between(x1,x2a,color="red",linewidth=2,label=L"x_{2} \leq 1 - \frac{1}{2}x_{1}",alpha=0.3);
ax.legend(loc="upper right");
ax.fill_between(x1,x2b,color="blue",linewidth=2,label=L"x_{2} \leq 2 - 2x_{1}",alpha=0.3);
ax.legend(loc="upper right");
ax.set_xlabel(L"x_{1}")
ax.set_ylabel(L"x_{2}")
savefig("example-01a.png");

But when I run the same code inside a code chunk in rBookdown with Julia as the engine, the saved chart is blank, only showing the x-axis and y-axis.

```{julia,engine.path="./Julia-1.2.0/bin"}
using PyPlot
clf();
ioff();
x1 = collect(0:0.1:2)
x2a = 1 .- 0.5*x1
x2b = ifelse.(2 .- 2*x1.>=0, 2 .- 2*x1,0)

fig, ax = subplots();

ax.fill_between(x1,x2a,color="red",linewidth=2,label=L"x_{2} \leq 1 - \frac{1}{2}x_{1}",alpha=0.3);
ax.legend(loc="upper right");
ax.fill_between(x1,x2b,color="blue",linewidth=2,label=L"x_{2} \leq 2 - 2x_{1}",alpha=0.3);
ax.legend(loc="upper right");
ax.set_xlabel(L"x_{1}")
ax.set_ylabel(L"x_{2}")
savefig("example-01a.png");

```

My apologies if this is a trivial issue, and would appreciate any suggestions to address it.
I am curious about whether can I use JuliaCall in R parallel scripts?
Should I initialize Julia by `julia_setup` in each R parallel process?
Hello, I had the same problem as issue #112.[failure by setup,same message and also some brutal hanging]. But I also had success setting up JuliaCall on another install of R on the same machine...I can post the logs if needed.
All in all, I have 3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.5.3 and 3.6.1. Only 3.5.2 works.
That installation is special : it is referenced in my (windows) path variable and is also the target for such instructions as R CMD install. 
Does that help?

Explore the possibility of supporting [arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/r) in JuliaCall. Need to use [Arrow.jl](https://github.com/ExpandingMan/Arrow.jl) as a dependency.

- [ ] Add Arrow.jl as an optional dependency.
- [ ] Add R package arrow as an optional dependency.
- [x] Have a simple implementation for vectors  (may involve copies at the current stage).
- [ ] Set up the CI tests.

## Related Issue

#114  is about the efficiency of data transfer betwen Julia and R. The mechanism currently involves data copying in the transfer process. Since we have mechanisms provided by [arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/r) and [Arrow.jl](https://github.com/ExpandingMan/Arrow.jl), it is natural to try to figure out a no-copy mechanism in JuliaCall.

Kind of like Conda.jl, it would be nice if JuliaCall could install its own version of Julia.
Julia version 1.1.1 at location D:\Julia\Julia-1.1.1\bin will be used.
Loading setup script for JuliaCall...
Error in .julia$cmd(paste0("Base.include(Main,\"", system.file("julia/setup.jl",  : 
  Error happens when you try to execute command Base.include(Main,"D:/R/R-3.6.1/library/JuliaCall/julia/setup.jl") in Julia.
                        To have more helpful error messages,
                        you could considering running the command in Julia directly

How can I fix this error？


I often experience R session abortion (but not every time) when using JuliaCall for caculation but could not figure our the exact reason.  

Last time, when I want to quite R and hit "ctrl d", I get the waring like bellow, but not the usual questiong asking me to save R work space. I have no idea what it means, maybe it is speicific to my working environment. Sorry currently I could not provide a reproducible example.

Dear "JuliaCall" developer:

I run the following code in my Rstudio:
install.packages("JuliaCall")

> devtools::install_github("Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall")  # get the development version of JuliaCall
> library(JuliaCall)
> julia=julia_setup(JULIA_HOME = "/Applications/Julia-1.1.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin")
> f=function(k){
>     julia_command("@rget k;")
>     return(k)
>  }
>  f(3)

The error comes:
> Error: Error happens in Julia.
> BoundsError
> Stacktrace:

I found "@ rget" can read the global variables (defined before entering R functions) into Julia, but cannot read the local variables defined after entering R functions. How can I read local variables?

Thank you.
