When I try to plot the points,
PlotOnStaticMap(lat = c(36.3, 35.8, 36.4), lon = c(-5.5, -5.6, -5.8), zoom = 10, cex = 4, pch = 19, col = "red", FUN = points, add = F)

I get the message:
Error in MaxZoom(latR, lonR, size) :
  argument "size" is missing, with no default

Hi Francisco. I love the tutorial and want to fork the repo. I'm currently creating a variation on it in RStudio. I'm wondering if you're not interested in licensing your work, using one of GitHub's many options. If not, why? Thanks!
