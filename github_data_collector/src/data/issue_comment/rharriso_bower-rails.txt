Can help me to fix this out. I am getting this issues while running "rake bower:install['-f']"
Hey guys,

I'm using 0.11 here with rails 4.2.9 and I have the following configuration:

```
BowerRails.configure do |bower_rails|
  bower_rails.install_before_precompile = true
  bower_rails.use_gem_deps_for_bowerfile = true
end
```

The thing is, when I run ```rake bower:install``` the dsl code is run before the actual configuration initializer, causing the gem to use the default values instead of the ones within the initializer. 

Am I missing something?

ps: I'm trying to install components from a gem
I've added `"openseadragon": "~2.2.0"` to my `bower.json` file.  This script ships with a source source map file.  When I load the page in Chrome with the developer console open, it makes a request for the map, but it's not delivered:

```
::1 - - [13/Jul/2017:14:02:38 CDT] "GET /openseadragon.min.js.map HTTP/1.1" 404 23067
```
Hi

When using inside a Docker container one should use the CLI option -allow-root everytime.

`docker-compose run web rake bower:install['-allow-root']`

Can this be configured inside the initializer as, for example:

```
BowerRails.configure do |bower_rails|
  bower_rails.allow_root = true
end
```

If it already exists would be awesome, if not would be a great addition.

Thanks in advance.


Hello, would you make possible or if already possible add an example for using bower-rails outside rails?

That would be very handy for example with static website generators like [awestruct](awestruct.org/).
Similar to `bundle outdated` it would be useful to see which packages have new versions.

This, and/or seeing a Gemfile.lock equivalent file w/ versions would be very helpful.

Hey guys, I added an option to add ignore dependencies in the `.bowerrc` (`ignoredDependencies`) 
like

```
ignored_dependency 'jquery'
```

See https://github.com/bower/bower/pull/1394 for background information

Whenever I add new package I have to call rake bower:install. That command will install everything from the beginning and it's not efficient. I do not see anything in the instruction that guide me to install 1 package only.
