I'm a programmer from China.I start to learn this project,it's very hard to understand .So I buy a book about this project which was wrote by your team ,but it is a published in 2003. Is this book have a new vision ? I want to buy another.Please give me a website
I'm a Junior programmer and I want to update this project and put it inside Dot42 and we can also use everything android studio does in C #.
Although I set my SharpDevelop language to English the error output console text is in French!
I am on Windows 7 x64 PC trying to open a 3rd party C# project file. As the project file needs BuildTools v15 to be installed on a machine I have installed it by downloading MS official small file internet installer.

But when I try to open a project created in Microsoft Visual Studio upon opening it gives me error:

"The tools version 15 is unrecognized. Available tools versions are 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0"

I guess it has something to do with the way BuildTools 2019 are installed cos the previous version 2015 (actually version 14) which has offline installer has been correctly recognized by SharpDevelop.

I read somewhere that it may help to uninstall any previous BuildTools versions (in my case it was just the previous one, that is BuildTools 2015) but it did not help - BuildTools 2019 is still unrecognized by SharpDevelop.

Is there a solution to this? Like setting the path to the actual BuildTools 2019 folder/.exe somewhere for the SharpDevelop?
If you want search GameWindow_KeyUp word in [Form] - have error. #develop v5.1
Здравствуйте, может быть я очень тупой, но как этим, блин, пользоваться? Я скачал. Никаких установочных файлов, любой .bat файл не запускается, открывается на секунду консоль где я успеваю увидеть "git не является системной командой". Что делать?
I have a SharpGL.openGLControl control installed on a MDI ChildWindow in WinForms. Although the ChildWindow's border is sizable, it cannot be resized using the mouse as the mouse does not "catch" on the ChildWindow's border to extend them.
If the SharpGL control is removed, then the ChildWindow's borders become sizable again.
Would anyone have a suggestion how to circumvent this ?
Thanks in advance.

can i use sharpdevelop.core in my .net core projects?
hi my name is willian diego i'm from
Brazil and I love sharpdevelop.
I come here to suggest some improvements

When he opens a project, he should make sure the files are not being used by other processes, if so, show the user and ask if he wants to terminate the process using the file.

When it opens a file, it should check whether in the folder where the project is located, it has read or read and write permissions and suggest to the user where to save the project if it is read only.
can save to my documents.

during conversion sharpdevelop does not copy ad library dependencies to the bin folder of the converted project, if that would be good.

Thankful .
