The notebook isn't running properly in its binder environment.
I'm receiving this error

Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-install-r_uybfy_/scikit-bio/ 
Deblur notebooks from @jgeier. 

The newest version of ipymd (0.1.2) does not work with ipython notebooks, but works fine with jupyter. We should update to the newest versions of ipython and jupyter to take this into account.

This adds the script to pulldown the information from EBI.

@wasade I've added comments to the original bash script so it is easier to follow. Do you mind taking a look to make sure that they're accurate? Thanks!

We will begin to produce 18S sequencing data for participants and need a processing pipeline to produce those results.

@ellexis will work on this


Addresses issue #147. This is a first pass, roughly based on the sckit-bio contributing.md.

There are a few issues which need to be addressed here:
- Who is the target audience for IPython Notebooks?
- Format and documentation standards for IPython Notebooks
- Contribution of analyses outside the lab.
- Scope of sharing IPython notebooks.

As we start to expand analyses and contributors, we need contributing guidelines. These probably need to cover the following areas:
- Requirements for testing code (i.e. separate logic and plotting, plotting does not need to be tested)
- What data can be hosted on GitHub, and where alternative data should be hosted
- Structure for IPython Notebooks
- Whether IPython Notebooks represent a tutorial of how data was generated, or if they need to reflect all data generated.

Not a pressing issue right now but would be great to have for the time when we need to re-generate these figures.

These utilities looks really useful for other project out from the American Gut scope.

Also, removing the IPython dependency will help to make them more general.
