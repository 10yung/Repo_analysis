This updates a number of asset-related dependencies, including a switch to `sassc`. It works, but downside: `sassc` breaks jruby support due to native extensions. We can choose to make `sassc` and `sprockets` development dependencies, so that jruby is only supported with precompiled assets. But then the jruby travis build would still fail. Alternatively, we have to hack conditional dependencies into gollum: `sass` for jruby, `sassc` for MRI.
When comparing [many wikis](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#wikis), one can't even start to compare, without first having to deploy the solution.
Requires https://github.com/gollum/rugged_adapter/pull/39
Gollum version:
Gollum 5.0.1b

With an asciidoc page the history links `http://wiki/Home.md/c4b30797a2bd78d6165bb1d08772e2e0b3321105` and compare links are broken because they refer to `<page>.md` (file extension is always .md) and not to `<page>.asciidoc`, if i manually change the URL to `.asciidoc` everything works as expected.

See https://github.com/rails/sprockets/issues/565#event-2696215187

This will also allow migrating to `SassC`, as the old ruby `sass` gem is deprecated.
Currently mathematical typsetting is provided by mathjax, which potentially has a small bug due to the discontinuation of the CDN #1390.

However, for a few reasons, mathjax is possibly less preferred than KaTeX for typesetting. In particular, the KaTeX project has more github stars and contributors than mathjax. Further, KaTeX demonstrates that they are faster than mathjax.

Currently gollum's mathematical typsetting is hardcoded to be provided by mathjax, e.g. with the flag `--mathjax`. 

Is it possible to have `5.x` also support KaTeX provided typesetting?
Work on 5.0 is evolving steadily. This is to document various tasks that still need to be performed before we can cut the release. Any help, also with documentation, welcome!

- [ ] Resolve the remaining issues under the [5.x milestone](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/milestone/9)

  * Note: this currently hangs on a forthcoming release of `rugged`.
- [ ] Update the following files in the root of the repository:
  - [ ] `ISSUE.md`
  - [ ] `HISTORY.md`
  - [ ] `README.md`
- [ ] Update the project wiki (remove any old information on limitations, security, etc., and update information on new features and funcationality that's current in the wiki [Release Notes](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/5.0-release-notes))
- [ ] Compile and package static assets, making sure they run out of the box
  - [ ] Review and cleanup image assets
- [ ] Release new version of the adapters
- [ ] Release new version of gollum-lib
  - [ ] Set adapter dependencies correctly in `gemspec` and `Gemfile`
  - [ ] Set default adapter correctly
- [ ] Release new version of gollum
  - [ ] Set adapter and `gollum-lib` dependencies correctly in `gemspec` and `Gemfile`
  - [ ] Check adapter selection in tests
  - [ ] Review/cleanup licenses
Github's [Primer.css](https://primer.style/css) has been added to gollum for styling (implemented in https://github.com/gollum/gollum/pull/1393). This issue is meant to track any styling issues that can be improved upon, but also as an open invitation to improve the styling more generally.

- [ ] [Use Primer to style the breadcrumbs](https://primer.style/css/components/breadcrumb)
- [ ] [Box overlays](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/issues/1381)
Gollum currently uses custom dialog modals (upload, rename, new). When the switch to Primer CSS has been merged, we should look into deprecated these custom modals for Primer's [Box--overlay](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/components/box-overlay/). At the moment this package is still experimental.
I want to collect some suggestions for improvements regarding mobile devices here:

* editor is not usable on my Android with Chrome (v 71, Android 9)
  * I use swiping to type on the virtual keyborad. Doing so **deletes** characters from the editor text area.
  * Situation got worse with latest changes by @dometto (don't get me wrong! Awsome work @dometto ! Really appreciate your improvements!) Now als without swiping on the keyboard sometimes characters disapear. Hard to describe. I can't add empty lines at all, get immediately deleted.
* File upload is not really usable.
  * On the edit page, I cannot drag'n'drop files to the editor area on a mobile
  * Clicking the upload button and then the select file button only shows me limmited options on Android 9 as a file source (Camera, Camcorder, Downloads directory)
* Copy and Paste does not work
  * https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/issues/3761

That's what I found so far. I could also investigate some of the issues, just don't know when I can find the time.
