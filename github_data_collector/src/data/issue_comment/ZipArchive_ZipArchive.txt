Hello, I'm getting this error trying to open a very large (9gig) zip file. I tried unzipping the file via the command line using unzip and it errors out. Now if I use ditto to unzip it it works just fine and if I double click it, it unzips fine. 

What is the difference between unzip and ditto, and how can I tell if the zip requires ditto vs. the SSZipArchive libraries?
Hi, I create a zip file of any Macos application file (.app file, e.g. Adobe Illustrator, ) using the SSZipArchive:

       let _=SSZipArchive.createZipFile(atPath:zipFilePath.path,
                                                   withContentsOfDirectory: fileURL.path,
                                                   keepParentDirectory: false,
                                                   withPassword: nil,
                                                   andProgressHandler: { (read_files, total_files) in
                                                    let progress=Double(read_files)/Double(total_files)
                                                    self.update_progress_of_zip(progress:progress, 
    finished:read_files==total_files)
                })

If I then unzip the same file using :

      let _: Bool = SSZipArchive.unzipFile(atPath: fileURL.path,
                                             toDestination: destinationURL.path,
                                             preserveAttributes: true,
                                             overwrite: true,
                                             nestedZipLevel: 1,
                                             password: nil,
                                             error: nil,
                                             delegate: nil,
                                             progressHandler:{(entry, zipInfo, readByte, totalByte) -> Void in
                                                
                                                let per=Double(readByte)/Double(totalByte)
                                                self.update_progress_of_unzip(progress: per, finished: false)
                                                
        }, completionHandler:completionHandler

The application file is corrupted and won't open on Macos Catalina. I assume something happens with the codesigning as perhaps some files or folders are not preserved as they should be. If I use Swift/Objective-c FileManager zip tool to zip the file:

      try? fileManager.zipItem(at: fileURL, to: zipFilePath, shouldKeepParent:false)

 and then use SSZipArchive to do the unzipping everything works fine and the application is not corrupted. The thing is I would like to use SSZipArchive consistently but I have trouble getting this to work. any suggestions as to what may be wrong? Thanks for your help. Cheers, Trond
I have an app that uploads a zip file of logs periodically. I use AES encryption on the zip file. Starting about 5 weeks ago, the uploaded files are now corrupted and can't be extracted. The messages I'm getting are similar to the bug that prompted v2.2.2, but I'm running v2.2.2 with these issues.

I'm not 100% that the issue is iOS 13 related, but we have been using v2.2.2 almost since release, and the corrupted zip files roughly start around the time of iOS 13's release. And given that v2.2.2 uses Apple crypto, it seems possible that Apple may have changed something, or exposed an option that changed the behavior.

Reverting to ZipArchive v2.1.4 (before the Apple crypto) has resolved the problem; The zip files can now be un-zipped again.

Here's a sample of how I use ZipArchive:

```
let documentsURL = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first!
let logsURL = documentsURL.appendingPathComponent("SomeLogs")
let zipURL = documentsURL.appendingPathComponent(fileName ?? "SomeLogs.zip")
let success: Bool = SSZipArchive.createZipFile(atPath: zipURL.path,
                                                       withContentsOfDirectory: logsURL.path,
                                                       keepParentDirectory: false,
                                                       compressionLevel: -1,
                                                       password: aPasswordString,
                                                       aes: true,
                                                       progressHandler: nil)
```

If there's anything I can add that would be helpful, please let me know.
I use ZipArchive lib to unzip zip files in my app. it work well on ios 12, but it can not unzip zip files on ios 13. 
I used fileManager to check my zip files permission (Writable,Readable,Executable). before unzip all permission is enable.  but after handling the file by function(unZipFileAtPath: toDestination: progressHandler: completionHandler), the permissions are enable and getting the error info: can not open the file.

is there any wrong!
Original file is `Rápida dissolução no trato gastrointestinal (TGI).png` 
Unzipped file is `Ra╠üpida dissoluc╠ºa╠âo no trato gastrointestinal (TGI).png` 

Because of that app is unable to find right file. 

(SSZipArchive (2.2.2))
Hi,
I am unable to zip the file in unity2019.1.10f1 in iOS. It always shows zero bytes.
No error is shown.It works fine in Unity 2018.2.8
Is there any fix regrading this.
I put one png file in a folder
when  us  
+ (BOOL)unzipFileAtPath:(NSString *)path
          toDestination:(NSString *)destination
     preserveAttributes:(BOOL)preserveAttributes
              overwrite:(BOOL)overwrite
         nestedZipLevel:(NSInteger)nestedZipLevel
               password:(nullable NSString *)password
                  error:(NSError **)error
               delegate:(nullable id<SSZipArchiveDelegate>)delegate
        progressHandler:(void (^_Nullable)(NSString *entry, unz_file_info zipInfo, long entryNumber, long total))progressHandler
      completionHandler:(void (^_Nullable)(NSString *path, BOOL succeeded, NSError * _Nullable error))completionHandler;

to unzip it return error: Error Domain=SSZipArchiveErrorDomain Code=-2 "failed to open file in zip file" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=failed to open file in zip file}

when .png file change to .txt file it work
I'm using version 2.2.2, and unzipFile(atPath: toDestination:) always returns false on the simulator. On my iPhone 8Plus, it works flawlessly.

I've debugged the error and it seems the function fopen64 is always returning NULL.

I'm currently on macOS Catalina 10.15 (19A583) and Xcode 11.2 beta (11B41).
