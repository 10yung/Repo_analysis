# Description

## Current Behavior
* `ListIDPGroupsInOrganization`
  * expects to be provided with `ListOptions` with `Page` value as `int`
    * https://github.com/google/go-github/blob/master/github/github.go#L193
  * returns response with type `github.Response` and `NextPage`, `PrevPage`, etc, values as `int`
    * https://github.com/google/go-github/blob/c74e92b2275cbb12471ed0fd6204dac07e130943/github/github.go#L399
* However, unlike other GitHub APIs, `GET /orgs/:org/team-sync/groups` return a page that is not numeric
  * For example: `Link: <https://api.github.com/organizations/<redacted>/team-sync/groups?per_page=100&page=X%274<redacted>0000000000000000000000%27>; rel="next"`
    * I've redacted from 274 to 000..., but its basically an alphanumeric string
  * Resulting `github.Response` will have `NextPage` with value as `0` since its expecting `int`
  * Pagination does not work, since `NextPage` is always `0`

## Expected Behavior
* `ListIDPGroupsInOrganization` should paginate properly

Hi I am trying to fetch all the repos (including private ones) including their PRs and Reviews. I am authenticating using my personal access token that has SSO enabled for the organization whose repos I want to fetch. But for some reason it only works for public repos and I dont see any private repos in my results

Here is the code

```go
        ctx := context.Background()
	ts := oauth2.StaticTokenSource(
		&oauth2.Token{AccessToken: "my-token"},
	)
	tc := oauth2.NewClient(ctx, ts)

	client := github.NewClient(tc)

       prs, _, err := client.PullRequests.List(ctx, "org-name", "private-repo-name", nil)
	checkErr(err)

	for _, pr := range prs {
		fmt.Println(*pr.Title)
	}
```

I get an error saying `GET https://api.github.com/repos/org-name/private-repo-name/pulls: 404 Not Found []` if I try to fetch the PRs of a private repo from that org

If however, I try a public repo it works.

I am able to access these repos on github

Am I authenticating my client correctly?
Adds an extra parameter to DownloadReleaseAsset `followRedirects`. This will tell the client to follow one level of redirects when downloading the asset.

Solves #1378 
## Context

The [`PushEventRepository`](https://github.com/google/go-github/blob/ac9200d19f35fee922744b768dd393140a9939c8/github/event_types.go#L698-L733) struct is missing the `archived` and `disabled` booleans that you can see present in [Github's documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent).

## Requested Change

I'm going to submit a PR adding those fields to the struct.
Hi,

I think the `DownloadReleaseAsset` method should follow the redirect by default and to make it optional to return the redirectURL.

I read the discussion in https://github.com/google/go-github/pull/312, and I understand that a new `http.Client` needs to be used, but I don't understand why the api had to change.

It seems to me that most users of this method don't care where the file comes from and they will all have to write similar logic to perform the download after the redirectURL is returned.

What do you think? I would be happy to contribute the code.
Added [this](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/pages/#update-information-about-a-pages-site) API functionality.

For reference : [Issue](https://github.com/google/go-github/issues/1361)
I am trying to add custom domain to Github Repository by enabling github pages but I can not find right method for this in the documentation. 

[Here](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/pages/#update-information-about-a-pages-site) is the API documentation for reference.
