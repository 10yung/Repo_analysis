Is there a changelog somewhere to show what's new in 2.0?
Requesting support for SELECT INTO Statement. https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_select_into.asp

Thanks
Currently if I want to check only for the existence of some records, I have to fetch the records and test the count, while we can do the check directly on the db and save some network traffic.

Suggestion:
var isFound = db.Query("Table").Where("Some Conditions here").Exists();
var isNotFound = db.Query("Table").Where("Some Conditions here").DoesntExist();

Similar to https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/queries#aggregates
It's pretty easy to just add this method via extention but I was curious why this method signature isn't in the query builder.

```
public static void OrderBy(this Query source, bool ascending, params string[] columns)
{
    if (ascending)
    {
        source.OrderBy(columns);
    }
    else
    {
        source.OrderByDesc(columns);
    }
}
```

Reasoning is that SqlKata is used for programmatically building queries, having this method compacts 8 lines into one or a single messy line into a cleaner one if you dare to use the discard var for a ternary since query is a mutable `_ = ascending ? source.OrderBy(columns) : source.OrderByDesc(columns);`
Hello everyone

I am trying to insert multiple records from a local database, to an online database, the local database is firebird, and the other one is mysql, I tried this:

`var baseQuery = connect.Query();

var data = baseQuery.Clone().From("CAIXA");

connectOnline.Query("CAIXA").Insert(data);`

connectOnline = online database connection
connect = local database

the tables are the same, the only difference is that the online database table has one more column called id_on

Can someone help me?

I would need to do this with update too
I am using the following line of code to insert a record into DB, `employeesInformation` parameter is of type `Dictionary<string, object> ` and has 33 parameters.

`await sqlKataDB.Query("TBL_EMPLOYEES_INFORMATION").InsertGetIdAsync<int>(employeesInformation);`

I am getting Parameter count mismatch error. As far as I have seen online, this error occurs when you Invoke a delegate function with wrong parameters (I am not sure here). I tried making the fuction sync instead of async but that didn't help. 

I saw an open StackOverFlow ticket with the same error but with no answer, the OP was intructed to get RawSql and Bindigns, I can get you that if that helps (But I don't know how, instructions would be great!)

Any suggestions?
SqlKata Version: 1.1.7

.NET Framework: 4.7.2

Observed Behavior: After compiling a query that contains multiple clauses (and nested query), the final clause which is a group by is silently removed from the clauses collection.

Expected behavior: The group by clause is added to the resulting SQL and not removed from the clauses collection. Additionally, if the compiler cannot add it, an informative exception is thrown.

Suggestion for enhancement for AsDelete and AsUpdate:

It would be nice to support Top/Limit to explicitly set how many records to update or delete if multiple matches are found based on Where. I also like to use Top/Limit to make sure only 1 record is affected if others were added immediately before I ran the query, just to be safe.

Sql Server supports DELETE TOP, MySQL supports DELETE LIMIT.
