Hello,

I tried googleing around, but it seems there is no support for socket activation in spray-can.

https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.socket.html
http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket-activation.html (quite old though)

Is this something that can be added easily, or hacked into it from the client side?

Hello! 

I think I may have found a bug when dealing with HEAD requests to spray-can. The [documentation states](http://spray.io/documentation/1.1.2/spray-routing/method-directives/head/):

> By default, spray-can handles HEAD-requests transparently by dispatching a GET-request to the handler and stripping of the result body. See the spray.can.server.transparent-head-requests setting for how to disable this behavior.

But it doesn't say that the `head` directives won't be processed as all when the setting is `on`. I've made an example repository with instructions on how to reproduce what I see as an error or undocumented "feature" [here](https://github.com/EdgeCaseBerg/spray-head-error-example)

The steps to reproduce are in the README file in the linked example. Is this the expected behavior? If so, where is it documented?




Currently the HttpServer only watches for timeouts for the _initial_ part of a response, i.e. once a chunked response is started the following response chunkes can be separated by "infinitely" long time periods, without triggering a timeout...
