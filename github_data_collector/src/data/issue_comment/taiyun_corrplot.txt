Hello, corrplot guys,
I'm using this package for my project and it's really a wonderful tool.
But I found that the p-values output from "p.mat <- cor.mtest(M)$p" have bugs, that means some calculated p values are higher than the correct ones, which are validated by SPSS.

If the bugs can be solved that will be great. Thanks a lot for developing this package.

Same question as these guys(https://github.com/taiyun/corrplot/issues/122#issuecomment-371790268).The range is correct, but the colour palette is white-blue and not the expected red-white-blue
`corrplot(corr=cor(CorOb.av.exp),method = "color",order = "hclust",tl.col="black",addrect=4,addCoef.col = "grey",cl.lim = c(min, 1), is.corr=FALSE)`

@taiyun @yihui @COS-Editor 
Thank you for developing the **corrplot** package. I like the feature that this message pops up when loading the package: 
```{r}
library(corrplot)
```
> corrplot 0.84 loaded

As an R package developer, how did you make it appear? 
Thanks!
Hi, I enjoy using this package. I ran into some issue with color display today.

I notice the color of some of the cells are not displayed according to the color label. For example, the positive values in column 1 and 2 should be red not blue. I wonder anyone else run into this issue? 
Hi there,
I am facing the same problem as #122, and have been struggling with this otherwise great package!  I do want to use this package, but also have control over the displayed range and colors.  Would have been nice if the authors had considered this feature!

Are there any work-arounds to properly limit the correlation range to anything other than [-1,1] and also map to the full range of specified colors?

Thanks!
I would like to be able to plot multiple corrplots on the same page.  Is there a recommended way to plot them using ggpubr or gridExtra packages, preferably ggpubr. Below is an example:
```{r}
library(ggpubr)
data(mtcars)
M <- cor(mtcars)
set.seed(0)

##  different color series
col1 <- colorRampPalette(c("#7F0000", "red", "#FF7F00", "yellow", "white",
                           "cyan", "#007FFF", "blue","#00007F"))
col2 <- colorRampPalette(c("#67001F", "#B2182B", "#D6604D", "#F4A582",
                           "#FDDBC7", "#FFFFFF", "#D1E5F0", "#92C5DE",
                           "#4393C3", "#2166AC", "#053061"))
col3 <- colorRampPalette(c("red", "white", "blue"))
col4 <- colorRampPalette(c("#7F0000", "red", "#FF7F00", "yellow", "#7FFF7F",
                           "cyan", "#007FFF", "blue", "#00007F"))
wb <- c("white", "black")

par(ask = TRUE)

## different color scale and methods to display corr-matrix
plot1=corrplot(M, method = "number", col = "black", cl.pos = "n", title='cutoff')

ggarrange(plot1,plot1)
```
Which produces the following error:
```{r}
Warning messages:
1: In as_grob.default(plot) :
  Cannot convert object of class matrix into a grob.
2: In as_grob.default(plot) :
  Cannot convert object of class matrix into a grob.
```

Again, I want to emphasize that my main goal is to use ggpubr or gridExtra

I love corrplot, but was running version 0.84 with R 3.5.2 (Mac) until last week.
I updated to R 3.6.0 GUI 1.70 El Capitan build because some tools were no longer working, but now corrplot will not perform a couple of tasks:
1. I can no longer plot large correlation matrices (17000x17000). I know it's big, but it always worked until now, it just took 30 minutes to render.
I get the message: Error: vector memory exhausted (limit reached?)

2. I can no longer extract the order of columns from such large matrices (with AOE or FPC clustering, using corrMatOrder. Again, it used to work before. But now I get the same message as above.

I am using the exact same code as before, on the same datasets. Help? 
Minimal reproducible example:

```
M <- cor(mtcars)

diag(M) <- NA

corrplot::corrplot(M, method = 'shade', 
                   is.corr = T,
                   cl.lim = c(-1, 1))
```

produces:

```
Error in if (any(corr < cl.lim[1]) || any(corr > cl.lim[2])) { : 
  missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed
```

I want to represent my correlation results by corrplot, but found that the labels of correlation coefficients on the right of the legend overlaped with legend
This warning " **stop("color limits should cover matrix")** " have some issues,
while the code only used the comparison of greater than the min and smaller than the max, in order to determine should it be raise the warning and stop the program.

Would that be inclusive, such as if user provided a custom limit c(0, 1). Then, there might be chance that getting 0 or 1.
In the current design of the program will restrict the user to use this range, unless they specify with c(-0.001, 1.001).

The current code is

`

if (any(corr < cl.lim[1]) \|\| any(corr > cl.lim[2])) {
          stop("color limits should cover matrix")
}
