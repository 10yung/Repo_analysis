**Description**
I still haven't been able to reproduce this crash consistently but it been happening every now and then according to our Crashlytics. Also we haven't changed anything significantly with out cluster implementation so I'm not sure what could be causing it.

Hi,
Would it be possible to add a SwiftUI Example of how to incorporate Cluster into a project in SwiftUI project in Xcode 11?
Thanks a lot!
<!--- Provide a short summary of your issue in the Title above. -->
With a minimum interaction it re-clusters the spots. also the groups are different each time when the map comes back to same location and same zoom level. it should always do the same groupings. 
1. There should be a variable for sensitivity which should control the clustering sensitivity on zoom change.
2. algorithm should be updated so that it should do groups same each time for same location and same zoom level.

### Issue Description
I would like to display the user's location with the standard updating blue dot while using Cluster on a mapview, but I cannot figure out how to do this. 
I have tried to figure it out in the example app as a base solution, but checking the User Location box for the map in the storyboard doesn't add it. I have also tried to programmatically add it using:
```
mapView.showsUserLocation = true
```
but this doesn't work either (though I may have put it in the wrong place).

I am guessing this is a simple fix that I am just not seeing; any help would be much appreciated!
### Environment

- **iOS Version**: 12.3.1
- **Device(s)**: iPhone 8

**Description**
Calling `MKMapView.showAnnotations(:MKAnnotation)` will zoom the map appropriately to show the annotations passed in, however the cluster manager will never cluster those annotations again (even after calling reload). I tried using the function in 2 ways:

1. When a cluster is clicked: `mapView.showAnnotations(clusterAnnotation.annotations, animated: true)`
2. When the annotations are initially created: `mapView.showAnnotations(newAnnotations, animated: true)`

In the first case the annotations from the cluster are never clustered again. In the second case no annotations are ever clustered.

### Issue Description

I tried almost everything and don't know, why I am not getting this thing to work. So I added a custom annotation view, subclass of ClusterAnnotationView. Its size is 50x50. I added the Delegate method:

`func cellSize(for zoomLevel: Double) -> Double {
        return 80
}`

And this is my configuration: 

`clusteringManager.delegate = self
        clusteringManager.shouldDistributeAnnotationsOnSameCoordinate = true
        clusteringManager.minCountForClustering = 2
        clusteringManager.shouldRemoveInvisibleAnnotations = true
        clusteringManager.clusterPosition = .average
        clusteringManager.maxZoomLevel = 15`

But I still ending up with this overlapping:
