Added ability to set config values from environment settings.
Create config values if they don't already exist.
Added xmlpoke ability to allow setting other values in the config files.
Changed config values to be hierarchical to make the config cleaner.

I would like to have the ability to apply environment specific config transforms to the app config file.  This can be done using code like this:

But I am not sure how that would work with PowerShell remoting since it's using an assembly that would probably have to be copied down to the server.

Also, I would like to have the ability to have the config transform file sitting on the deployment server with my deployment scripts vs having to have them sitting in the source repository or in the zip file. This is because they would probably have sensitive settings in them.

Thoughts?

Any script CMD or BAT for install AppRolla, using PowerShell.exe ?

Maybe use "Powershell -command" for use script ps: 

(new-object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://raw.github.com/AppVeyor/AppRolla/master/install.ps1") | iex

For example:

https://github.com/DannyDouglass/DCStreetHockey.Original/blob/master/deploy/runner.cmd

Might be a good idea. Batch jobs seems to be a commen enterprise thing. 
Surely most stuff should be event driven, but theres a lot, i mean ALOT of old batch jobs out there.
