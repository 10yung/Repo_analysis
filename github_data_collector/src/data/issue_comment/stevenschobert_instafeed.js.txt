I implemented instafeed to a website I am working on and I found an issue. There are multiple videos on the feed but one of the videos is missing and I don't know why.

This is the instagram url of the company: https://www.instagram.com/urbanelectriccompany/
This is where I implemented instafeed: https://www.urban-electric.com/archive

This is the code I am using for instafeed:

```javascript
var instagramFeed = new Instafeed({
	userId: *****,
	accessToken: *****,
	get: 'user',
	target: 'instagram-feed-inner',
	resolution: 'standard_resolution',
	sortBy: 'most-recent',
	template: '<a href="{{link}}" target="_blank"><span class="overlay"><span class="overlay-date">{{model.created_time}}</span><span class="overlay-click">Click to open on Instagram</span></span>{{model.template}}</a>',
	filter: function(image) {
		if (image.type == 'image') {
			image.template = '<img src="' + image.images.standard_resolution.url + '" />';
		} else {
			image.template = '<video autoplay muted loop><source src="' + image.videos.standard_resolution.url + '" type="video/mp4"/></video>';
		}
		return true;
	}
});
instagramFeed.run();
```

I am using the latest version of Instafeed.
There is an IG TV item added onto an IG feed, when I click on 'posts' on the ig account I can see it however the poster image of that video does not display on the instafeed integration like other videos seem to display. 

Is there a solution for this? 
Currently this issue is just to collect information regarding the new API and what it would involve to update instafeed.js to use it.
**UPDATE (@stevenschobert):** This thread has turned into a conversation about how Instafeed.js is going to work with Instagram's [new API restrictions](http://developers.instagram.com/post/133424514006/instagram-platform-update).

Currently, new Instagram API clients are not able to fetch much of the data that Instafeed.js relied on to work, and we are evaluating options for how to handle authentication going forward. Credentials created before the API restrictions went live are not affected for now.

**Original Post**:
I'm working on a client project (built on Shopify platform) and am looking to pull in their Instagram posts by user. I have it all setup - but it will not pull in my client's account. When I plug in my personal Instagram account userId & clientId, everything works perfect so I know it's not an issue with how I have it set up. Are there any known security settings that will prevent instafeed from working on a specific account? To note, the account I'm looking to pull in has a very large following.. not sure if that has anything to do with it?

Here's the set-up I have for reference (includes liquid language as used on Shopify, so just ignore that): 

<!-- Instafeed -->

```
{% assign instafeed_img = '{{image}}' %}
{% assign instafeed_link = '{{link}}' %}
{% assign instafeed_likes = '{{likes}}' %}
{{ 'instafeed.min.js' | asset_url | script_tag }}
<script type="text/javascript">

var userFeed = new Instafeed({
    target: 'instafeed',
    get: 'user',
    userId: '260149935',
    clientId: 'xxx',
    limit: '10',
    sortBy: 'most-recent',
    resolution: 'standard_resolution',
  template: '<div class="grid__item large--one-fifth"><a href="{{ instafeed_link }}" target="_blank"><img src="{{ instafeed_img }}"><span class="likes"><span class="icon icon-heart" aria-hidden="true"></span>{{ instafeed_likes }}</span></a></div>'
});
userFeed.run();
</script>
```
