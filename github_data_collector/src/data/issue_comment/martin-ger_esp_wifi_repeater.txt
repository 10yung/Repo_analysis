Hi, I'm familiar with programming in arduino IDE but not with this kind of source codes which need BUILD. I'm looking for a tutorial for newbies to make them able to build binary file from this kind of repositories.
Steps to reproduce:
1) switch on wifi repeater and connected a device on it.
2) switch off the device
3) open a telnet connection and send "show stats" : the device is still displayed

Is there a reliable way to know which devices are connected?
Dear Martin,

I'm using a relay on GPIO14, so I defined:
gpio 14 mode out
So far this worked and I can control my relay with the commands described in the readme file.

When the devices is powered, the relay always is set to high for a fraction of a second, then it is set to low. Is there any chance to avoid this during the start up phase of the ESP8266?

Best Regards and Merry Christmas
Gisbert
Hi Martin,
I done repeater using your code to extend WiFi of my home router with details as Gateway IP: 192.168.1.1, Subnet : 255.255.255.0, DNS: 192.168.1.1. In our IoT project, server is connected to router with reserved dynamic IP 192.168.1.51 and other nodes are connected with static IP assigned, say 192.168.1.10. I am using repeater for one node (say static IP 192.168.1.10), but my issue is when connecting this node to repeater, it provides network details as Gateway IP: 192.168.4.1, Subnet : 255.255.255.0, DNS: 192.168.1.1, dynamic IP say 192.168.4.2. so server cannot able to connect with 192.168.1.10 because repeater makes it as say 192.168.4.2. how can make 192.168.4.2 same as 192.168.1.10. How to route it.
When i first flashed my esp8266, i opened the wifi connections and i could see "MyAp". After i configured it i couldn't see the connection. I tried everything. Flashed it using different settings, different binaries etc. but nothing worked. The esp8266 is not problematic because i tested some other things on it and it worked just fine. Can someone help me fix the problem?
I'm interested in your mesh realization, that allows to retranslation network traffic through mesh. I want to use it in my project based on esp32 but with some modifitaction. My probles is I can't find any source code of it.

Is your realization close and I can use binary firmware only?
In other case where can I find source code of mesh?
Dear all
    I meet one problem about the line:  dhcps_set_DNS(WiFi.dnsIP());
   from feedback of arduino IDE:   conversion from 'IPAddress' to 'ip_addr*' is ambiguous
   I check everywhere but not find answer. 
 Thanks for read , prefer your answer. 
NAT table full" and "LmacRxBlk:1" problem!

Excuse me
The above question! Concrete solution! What!
Hi, 
A few things really, but the first is, for the meshmap topology output, could you make the output of this respond to a set mqtt command?
So that I can get a synchronized response from all the routers (and my other nodes) at the same time.

Next is, is there some trick to getting the router to connect to the mqtt broker by NOT using an IP address? My routers do not seem to connect if I use a hostname.

Lastly, I found that I needed to change the WDS setting on my main ADSL router in order for the ESP8266's were allowed to connect. 
Do you have any information as to why the WDS setting should be a problem?

Regards,
Robert


Hi This project is amazing and I want to contribute but I noticed there is no developer documentation also this project doesn't not seem to use platformIO or Arduino   ...so no clue how to start ....is possible to provide documentation ...like which module does what and how compile /build .........even better if its possible to convert to platformio project
