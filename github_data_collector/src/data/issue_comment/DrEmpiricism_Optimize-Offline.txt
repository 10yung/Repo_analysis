**Describe the bug**
Unable to run Sysprep when using any version of Optimize-Offline above 3.2.7.5. Using 3.2.7.5, I can successfully Sysprep and capture the image but the newer versions produce an error.

**Screenshots**

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]
Having to manually add group policies after installing is kind of a pain. I'm not sure there is a way to do this currently but it'd be nice to have it. (A way to insert group policies directly into the ISO that is)
**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
Something like the registry templates dir.
**BUG:**
Import-Module : Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection.
Parameter name: index
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [Import-Module], ArgumentOutOfRangeException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.ImportModuleCommand
 
**System:**
Windows 10 all x64 versions

**Script Version:**
4.0.0.2
Currently a non-script error is thrown: `WARNING: "Windows.iso" does not contain valid Windows Installation media`.

Users will mostly be downloading Windows 10 ISOs with the `MediaCreationTool1909.exe`, as that is the safest option at the moment, it seems.

I have looked for official ms urls, but they seem to have been replaced with redirects to the download tool.

Offline-Image

> Does not perform any changes to an installed or live system nor can it optimize a live system.

Understand why you only support WIM and ISO files.

I just want to use the Offline-Image for already _extracted_ by DISM (or WinNTSetup) to another partiton Windows Image.

Three Option: "Offline" path that the **System Preparation** has not started yet.

Can you provide literally _**Offline-Image**_ support for Windows Image on disk partition If the System Preparation haven't _yet started_? 

> %Windir%\Setup\State\State.ini
> ImageState=**IMAGE_STATE_GENERALIZE_RESEAL_TO_OOBE**

I would really like to use your great tool on my german win installations too
and i bet thats not just me :)

So is there a way for "not-programmers" to help with all the localisations ?

Maybe some one whho understand whats going on here clould write a small "How-To"
I would love to support this Project.
because why not
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
It would be good to support Windows 10 16299 RS3

**Describe the solution you'd like**
All the feature removal to work

**Additional context**
Reason behind that: 1709 is considered the last version of W10 to not screw up latencies and is the best what you can get for gaming and security all together

with ISO or extracted OS files It starts failing on the below step:

I got this list from the XML file used in a previous version of the project. I figured it'd be useful to re-include in JSON format.
