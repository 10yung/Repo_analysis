Not properly working in iphone6/6plus devices

I tried to view the Line Graph screen by second time and it gets crashed in the below method.
- (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect 

Could I use iOS plot for realtime (30 redraws per second)?

Says "chat" a couple times; should say "chart"

Removed JSON kit has a required library and used NSJSONSerialize since as of iOS 7 this library has issue using the isa pointer. As well, fixed a bug that when the last data item is null the legend wouldn't show up.

Hello, 

Once I downloaded and tried to run the Xcode project, I got the errors shown below in the screenshot: 
![screen shot 2013-10-27 at 8 58 22 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2131591/1416249/43ffcd42-3f42-11e3-98ee-7f3593438f5d.png)

The Legend titles are not displayed when the last data value is null.

```
    {
        "data": [
            8,
            9,
            2,
            null,
            null,
            null,
    null
        ],
        "title": "Gas"
    } 
```
