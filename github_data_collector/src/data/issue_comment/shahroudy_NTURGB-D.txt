The matlab script is quite slow and hard to be parallel. I write the python parser to extract the skeleton data to numpy array , making the data loading more efficient and easier.
Hi Shahroudy
Could you please provide me the Action-Part Semantic Relevance-aware (APSR) framework code for experimentation.
Thanks

Hello, I'm a graduate student collecting a dataset about skeleton and pose estimation. I want to label the  true 3d joint position in the world coordinate. I want to know what is the method that your team label the 3d joint position. did your team use Kinect SDK? thanks. 
I want to know where I can download the code of APSR-framework mentioned in NTU-RGBD120 paper. Thank you very much.
