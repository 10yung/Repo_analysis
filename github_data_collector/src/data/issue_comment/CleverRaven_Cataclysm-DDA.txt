**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**  
What the game currently calls a flintlock rifle is clearly supposed to be a musket, given it's accuracy and (lack of) range (Also see #37203 on the matter of range, as they should have more dispersion and more range), that is a smoothbore weapon, not a rifled one. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**  
The name of the weapon should be changed to "Flintlock Musket".

**Describe alternatives you've considered**  
Changing the stats (more accuracy, a _lot_ more reload time) to actually represent a flintlock rifle and adding an actual flintlock musket as a different item. Or first changing the name of the current item and then creating a new item to represent a flintlock musket.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**  
Most flintlock weapons impart a lot of energy on its projectiles and they can travel a long distance. They absolutely can't _hit_ the broad side of a barn at those distances, but they can travel it and cause quite a bit of damage to whatever else they hit.

Flintlock weapons in the game have surprisingly high accuracy (low dispersion), relatively speaking, but very low max range, when it should be the reverse.

**Describe the solution you'd like**  
Dispersion should be increased, and so should range, allowing for a gun that can theoretically shoot longer distances, but will be wildly inaccurate at those, and can only be relied to hit something useful if there are a large cluster of enemies there (which given the noise it can cause would mean attracting said horde, but that's what you get for using a flintlock at a range)

**Describe alternatives you've considered**  
Nothing seems viable.

**Additional context**

#### Summary

 ```SUMMARY: Content "Adds a radio tower to  Hub 01"```

#### Purpose of change

Makes sense for a highly important military research installation to have its own radio tower.

#### Describe the solution

Its just a normal radio tower included into Hub's overmap special.

#### Summary
SUMMARY: Features "Adds steering indicator to remote controlled vehicle and allows to see through it's camera(s)" 

#### Purpose of change
This change intended to make remote controlled vehicles more useable and controllable

#### Describe the solution
Lightmap processing was changed to use controlled vehicle's cameras and mirrors.
Indication of turning direction was tweaked to account remote-controlled vehicle position.

#### Describe alternatives you've considered
Do not use remote controlled vehicles at all, because in current state its almost impossible to drive it.

#### Additional context
There is video of controlling 1-tile sized remote vehicle inside of research facility building - https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/eq8kjz/wip_making_remote_controled_vehicles_usable/

#### Summary
`SUMMARY: Balance "Buff cooked buckwheat fun from -10 to 0"
`
#### Purpose of change
Cooked buckwheat had extreamly low enjoaybility value, brobably an oversight when using coppy-from from raw buckwheat.

#### Describe the solution
Adding one line of code with fun value of 0

#### Describe alternatives you've considered
Changing it to 1 or 2 as some people might enjoy buckwheat

#### Testing
Run the game, everything works. 

#### Additional context
My first PR. Please be gentle

#### Summary
```SUMMARY: Balance "Razorclaws & mutant fish drop mutant meat"```

#### Purpose of change
Fixes #36974 

#### Describe the solution
Added two harvest entries for mutant fish and shellfish and added Razorclaws and the mutant fishes to them.

#### Describe alternatives you've considered
Making a ```mutant_fish``` food item and related crafts.
Not changing it.

#### Testing
Spawned and butchered razorclaws and mutant fish.

#### Summary
 ```SUMMARY: Balance "adjusts house food spawns."```

#### Purpose of change
adjusts the food loot in the SUS groups and house palette to remove duplicate spawns in multiple sources.

#### Describe the solution
Taking the kitchen as a whole, I've removed duplicating item spawns. So for example, you don't end up with multiple jars of honey and jugs of oil scattered around the kitchen.  This will need more work but I've caught the big ones.

I've restructured item_groups further down the item_group chain for spawn frequency and compatibility between the groups.

Finally, I've adjusted the spawn chances in the houses as well.  The pantry had a chance to repeat that's been removed and I've adjusted the fridge from 100% to 80% until we can get more variations added.

In general now, a house offers 1 to 4 days of food depending on its pantry spawns (1-2 from the fridge and then additional days from the pantry).  A lot of the fridge food spoils quickly so this will drop off as time advances since the majority of food is fresh.

This makes house raids more valuable earlier in the game for the fresh foods, and then you'll need to push further in if you want to stock up on shelf stable goods.

#### Describe alternatives you've considered
Not messing with the SUS_fridge group, but it had some overlap with the other groups.   


#### Testing

Used the debug item_group tests to look at results as well as random sampling from the game maps.  


SUMMARY: None

Fixes #37194

# Describe the bug

After reading an area's Restaurant Guide, it showed everything expected, except there were additionally a bunch of Desolate Barns now on my maps. Seemed wrong.


# Steps To Reproduce

1. Use Restaurant Guide
2. Notice all the Desolate Barns

# Expected behavior

Doesn't seem like Desolate Barns would be in a restaurant guide.

# Screenshots
