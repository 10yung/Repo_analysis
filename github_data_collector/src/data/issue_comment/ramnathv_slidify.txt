There is a 404 for http://slidify.org/about.html - hope this is the right place to report this
@ramnathv Is it possible to randomize the quiz questions and answers options?
Hi,
I apologise if this issue has already been addressed elsewhere.
How do I add separator slides? You know slides that mark the boundaries of segments in the presentation deck?
My slidify presentation looks great when I knit it and view it in RStudio, or when I open it in my browser via RStudio. However, when I publish it to RPubs, I get a blank page.

Having searched for a fix, the advice is to change "mode : selfcontained" to "mode : standalone" in my .Rmd file, and also to create a file called ".RProfile" (in the working directory containing the index.Rmd file that gets knitted), which contains only the line "options(rpubs.upload.method = "internal")".

Making these changes has achieved nothing. Also I know I can publish to RPubs because I've published other stuff there. Where do I go from here?

I think I am running into the same issue as issue #498. However, when I try adding: 

lib_cdn: "https://cdn.rawgit.com/ramnathv/slidifyLibraries/master/inst/libraries"

the problem is not resolved. 

To be clear: my slides render in RStudio preview, but not when I pop into browser. When I run slidify(), I observe the same problem: just a blank white screen.  

It would be really nice to get this working; otherwise, I'll need to convert to a different framework in a very short time period (I'm reusing an old deck for an updated presentation).

Thank you!

UPDATE: I also tried downloading the directory you mention in #498 and load that instead of the git directory, however that produces the same behavior. Also, this is all with mode: selfcontained. When I switch to standalone, everything, including the RStudio preview, is blank. 

UPDATE 2: I have also tried publishing to git and then downloading the directory. Still the same behavior. 

I also noticed that the the source for the HTML is present, however it is just not rendering. 

UPDATE 3: My git repo is here: https://github.com/joehoover/testdeck/tree/gh-pages

UPDATE 4: I am now able to view the presentation in a browser. And, I am able to open and view the index.html file generated by slidify(). However, I am developing on a remote machine. When I download the deck directory, I still see a blank html file (even though the html code is present). Note, I can only preview in browser when mode: selfcontained. 
Hi,

I am building a slidify deck now but I got error saying "Error in function_list[[k]](value) : object 'GGally' not found" after I run this. vn[,1:5] %>% as.data.frame() %>% ggpairs()

Does anyone know how I can code slidify for music? I have an original and I have the remix and I want to use slidify to go back and forth between the two.

Thank you!
Is this project abandoned?
I'm looking for an as easy as possible way to publish RMarkdown presentations to github but couldn't set it up properly.
Each time I try publish() I'm shown a github page saying page is not there and that theres been switch in address: Subdomains of github.com are deprecated for GitHub Pages. They will not redirect to github.io for new GitHub Pages sites. 
I want to insert a chemical formula in the text for example

bla bla H2SO4 bla bla ....

I have tried to insert latex formula in the text

bla bla $\chem{H_2SO_4}$ bla bla

but it didn't displayed correctry
