Alacritty 0.4.0, delta 0.0.15

All light themes are broken.
Somehow `--minus-color=xx` does not set to xx, but adds xx.
`--minus-color="#000000"` shows minus diffs with no color.
Are there any plans to support side-by-side viewing?
Do this when the `.mjs` javascript file extension is recognized in bat, see #78, cc @devsnek.

When committing e.g. a patch-file in a git repository that has a line
which contains `--- ` only, `delta` fails with the following error (as it
expects such a line to contain keywords for the diff):

```
thread 'delta::tests::test_diff_in_diff' panicked at 'byte index 2 is out of bounds of ``', src/libcore/str/mod.rs:2017:9
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace.
```

This patch changes the diffing behavior to ensure that lines containing
`--- ` only won't be parsed.
Git recently added `--color-moved` support, to colour moved code: https://stackoverflow.com/a/48166435/463761

Would it be possible to add support for that in delta?
See https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy/issues/271 for an explanation, since it's the same issue.
It appears that delta has some trouble finding the end of a hunk:

Note how "Submodule"'s first character gets removed by delta.

Using delta 0.0.14.
It would be awesome if the file name / function / chunk header, that delta displays before each file / function / chunk, would be fixed / pinned to the top of the screen and just the file content would scroll. When scrolling into the next file, its file name header would scroll up until it takes the place of the previous file's header, at which point it would be fixed / pinned to the top of the screen, and so on. That way it would always be obvious which file, and inside that file which function, I am looking at. I think it could simplify larger reviews quite a bit.

There is a sister-feature-request for bat: sharkdp/bat#754 and nushell: nushell/nushell#389
Maybe you can find a solution for this together with the bat and the nushell devs?
If files are renamed and modified, `delta` will output the renaming twice.
For instance, given the following `git diff` output:

```
diff --git a/one.rs b/two.rs
similarity index 99%
rename from one.rs
rename to two.rs
index 50fc1ba..37f64c4 100644
--- a/one.rs
+++ b/two.rs
@@ -19,7 +19,6 @@
 ### Examples

 These are changes:
-one:
+two:
```

then `renamed: one.rs ‚ü∂   two.rs` will show up twice

This PR assess that by resetting the file names on each `FileMeta` state entry.
