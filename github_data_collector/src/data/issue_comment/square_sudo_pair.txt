```

Using `deny(warnings)` is really bad idea since software would stop compiling after compiler update.

Please use `-D warnings` in CI instead.

Closes #46.

Pushing the work so far, but I'll add tests when I have a moment.
For maintainability I'd love to be able to specify group names in addition to GIDs for gids_exempted.

My rust-foo is superficial at best but I'm thinking this should be doable by extending is_sudoing_from_exempted_gid() , what do you think?

Right now sudo_pair does not show who approved/is watching the session, would be nice to have that in there.


We should make it easier to install this plugin.
When I get time, I'd like to do fuzz testing.

`sudo-plugin`, despite its generic name, currently only supports creating IO plugins, and not policy plugins.  Would you consider policy plugins to be in-scope for the crate?

PS: Many thanks for releasing sudo-pair, and making sudo-plugin available as a reusable crate.
