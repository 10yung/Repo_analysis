加载数据过快会崩溃，
（能多暴露一个设置滑动最大速度的接口就更好了）

AndroidX is replacing the Support Library. Android-ObservableScrollView does currently not work with AndroidX.
ObservableWebView has call NestedScrollView.onInterceptTouchEvent(event) in onTouchEvent and  then NestedScrollView's mLastMotionY will changed to Y coordinate value of  this event's,but this value maybe is bigger than NestedScrollView's max height(when scrolled the WebView),which cause the bug that when I clicked some area inside WebView but it scroll to bottom.
Hi,
Hopefully you can answer me. I havent managed to solve this for month.
I did a mix of flexibleRecyclerViewSlidingup and ViewPagerTabRecyclerViewFragment, it means i have a fragment sliding up or down to the bottom with pager containing recyclerViews.
I noticed while scrolling up of down that my recyclerView item get clicked in same time which i would like obviously to prevent.
In face looking at ViewPagerTabRecyclerViewFragment , there is the same behavior : if we try to start a slight scroll on recyclerView, it can be seen on your samples that a click is triggered in the same time.

Could you advise a workaround to avoid this to be triggered while moving up or down?
Thank you for your feedback

I have developed one project and used this library but when i make signed apk then it is showing error like:

Error:(42, 57) error: package com.github.ksoichiro.android.observablescrollview does not exist
Error:(43, 57) error: package com.github.ksoichiro.android.observablescrollview does not exist
Error:(44, 57) error: package com.github.ksoichiro.android.observablescrollview does not exist
Error:(45, 57) error: package com.github.ksoichiro.android.observablescrollview does not exist
Error:(56, 85) error: cannot find symbol class ObservableScrollViewCallbacks
Error:(70, 5) error: cannot find symbol class ObservableGridView
Error:(310, 41) error: cannot find symbol class ScrollState

App is working fine if i run it in device via ADB. It shows this error when i try to generate signed apk

please provide me solution



Right now in this example if we pass 99 items or any odd number of items and then scrolls then it creates issue, please resolve it
You know that ripple you get when you hit the top or bottom of a scrollable view? Well, for the sticky header examples, the top overscroll ripple is cut off by the header itself. The bottom one works fine. Also, part of the scrollbar gets obscured behind the header. I'm not sure if this is solvable without major layout changes.
This not an issue exactly but a question. What is the difference between ObservableScrollView vs Collapsing Toolbar ?
I am trying to integrate the `FlexibleSpaceToolbarScrollViewActivity` functionality in my app. I want to make the toolbar title gravity will be horizontally center when the page load and when translate ends the title will be at the same place according to current tutorial/example. I think the following codes are placing the title from start to end.

ViewHelper.setPivotX(mTitleView, 0);
ViewHelper.setPivotY(mTitleView, 0);
ViewHelper.setScaleX(mTitleView, 1 + scale);
ViewHelper.setScaleY(mTitleView, 1 + scale); 

Is it possible to make the title at the fixed center aligned position?
