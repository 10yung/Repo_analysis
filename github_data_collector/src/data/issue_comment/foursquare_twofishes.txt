first of all thank you for this amazing project. second, my issue is with when im trying to build the project and pants i giving me the following error:
12:36:56 00:02   [jvm-platform-validate]
12:36:56 00:02     [jvm-platform-validate]

FAILURE: Problem locating a java distribution: Failed to locate a JRE distribution with minimum_version 10.0.1.0.10, maximum_version 10.0.1.0.10

i have jvm version 10 installed, i have also went to the pants.ini and tried modifying the minimum and maximum version requirements to my current version, however it seems that pants cannot find my jvm installation. any thoughts?
Hey... I've been working on a project which requires Reverse Geocoding and TwoFishes is best for this. Client has a J2EE environment running on Tomcat on Windows. 

Currently, I'm running twofishes on another server and consuming its JSON API.
He asked me if I could have the twofishes running on the same server on Tomcat.?

Is this possible?
Link goes here: http://twofishes.net/binaries/server-08_21_2016.jar and I receive a 404 Not Found
Here's my problem. I'm sending a JSON encoded requests to twofishes server. It's deployed from github repo as is - totally vanilla, no changes. Twofishes is used to map users locations as provided in their profiles to geographical points. That's mapped automatically, no human interaction.

One request I'm sending contains such query: **St. Paul** and the other request contains a rather similar query: **St. Paul, Minn.**.

The interesting part is that while the first one correctly maps to St. Paul in Minnesota, USA, the other maps to the city of Minden in Germany.

In other words, I'm asking is there any guide to debugging the differences between what I expect (a city in USA) and what I get (a city in Germany). 

At this point any document specifying what's correct and what's not would be rather useful. 

The geonames database exposes US postal codes as an alternate name with language "post".

Is there a way to include this name during the index building phase?

I have a 2gb Ubuntu VPS and I'm trying to run twofishes on it. I cannot start twofishes because it usually crashes with an `OutofMemoryError`. I see two variations:

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded
```

or

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
```

I have upped the # of mapped files with:

```
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count = 131072
```

And I am starting twofishes by restricting the java memory allocation pool:

```
java -Xmx1g -Xms500m -jar server-assembly-0.84.9.jar --hfile_basepath INDEX_DIRECTORY
```

I tried variations of memory pool size (ie, `Xms1g`, `Xms800m`, etc) without success. I also have swap space set to 256mb, although I don't think it's helping.

Are there any optimal settings I can use to get it running on my 2gb instance?

Wen trying to build the server using `./sbt server/assembly` two dependencies aren't found:

```

```

Any suggestions as how to solve said problem ?

My attempt to refactor the dupe sorting logic has led me to discover some very dumb choices made in the design of `scala.math.Ordering`

It's also impossible to test any of this because everything is defined inside a method. TODO: factor out orderings into a trait etc, do not merge until then.

```
$ ./parse.py -w .

No timestamped index folder was created under `./indexes/`. For a single country (I tried with MX), it worked fine.
