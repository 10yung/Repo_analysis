An article just came out suggesting redshift should be blue shifting https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2019/dec/17/not-such-a-bright-idea-why-your-phones-night-mode-may-be-keeping-you-awake

**Describe the bug**
When switching to a workspace with a Java application open (such as one of the JetBrains IDEs) in the i3 window manager, redshift is momentarily disabled. It starts working again after a few seconds. I have no idea if this is redshift's fault or i3's, but I decided to open an issue here first. If it turns out not to be something that can be fixed on redshift's end, I will open an issue with i3 instead.

- [x] [I have checked the FAQ](https://github.com/jonls/redshift/blob/master/README.md#faq) and my issue is not mention there. There is a simillar issue mentioned in the FAQ, but I thought this was worth raising since it only happens when the programs are used together in a specific window manager.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Start an i3 session
2. Run redshift
3. Open a java application
4. Switch to a different workspace
5. Return to the workspace with the java application to trigger the bug

**Expected behavior**
Redshift should stay active like it does in other window managers or desktop environments.

**Software versions (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Linux
 - Redshift version: 1.12
 - Distribution: Arch Linux 5.4.1
 - Redshift installed from: AUR (yay -S redshift)

**Describe the bug**
I accidentally closed the Redshift that was running in the tray on Ubuntu 18. I then went to restart it via GUI. I got the following error message:

> Unknown location provider `geoclue'


**Expected behavior**
I expect it to start, as it always does on startup.

**Software versions (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Ubuntu 18
 - Redshift version: 1.11
 - Distribution: Ubuntu
 - Redshift installed from: probably via `apt-get`

Extend redshift-gtk's "Suspend for" menu with a "Custom" option, which pops up a
dialogue for the user to enter a number of minutes (up to a maximum of
720,  i.e. 12 hours).
When i start the service with `systemctl --user start redshift` it crashes with the following log


- [x] [I have checked the FAQ](https://github.com/jonls/redshift/blob/master/README.md#faq) and my issue is not mention there.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Install redshift, wlroots and sway version 1.1-rc1-51-gf5d1c272
2. Set `adjustment-method=wayland` in `.config/redshift.conf`
3. Start logging with `journalctl --user -u redshift`
4. Start the service with `systemctl --user start redshift`
5. See error

**Expected behavior**
Automatic wayland display detection

**Error output/logs/screenshots**
```

```

**Software versions (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Linux
 - Redshift version: 1.12
 - Distribution: Ubuntu 19.10
 - Redshift installed from: PPA

**Possible Fix**
By using the following service file redshift starts normally as a user service and works
```
[Unit]
Description=Redshift display colour temperature adjustment
Documentation=http://jonls.dk/redshift/
After=display-manager.service

[Service]
ExecStart=env WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0 /usr/local/bin/redshift
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```
Probably there's a better way to fix this issue
I am using the precompiled version for WIN
I got the following issue
Unable to save current gamma ramp.
Failed to start adjustment method wingdi.

I am a developer of simillar app and setting windows gdi was working in previous builds of win 10, I am sure. I was wondering wether other apps solved the issue. Maybe you know wingdi api better than me and you will be able to find the solution.
duplicate screen is working, independent screen is working. it will be something about the two screens in extended mode. 

AppVeyor's GCC no longer supports `localtime_r()`:

We need to use `localtime_s()` on Windows.
**Describe the bug**
Gui pops up saying I am out of options...

- [x] [I have checked the FAQ](https://github.com/jonls/redshift/blob/master/README.md#faq) and my issue is not mention there.

**To Reproduce**

2. run  redshift-gtk -l 52.37:4.9 (for example) or redshift -l ,,, or redshift -c  ,config/redhift.config (with a config file with manual coordinates)
4. See error
