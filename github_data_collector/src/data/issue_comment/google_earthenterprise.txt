Scons uses python 2.6 on EL6. This causes issues with installing specific dependencies. 

For example: GitPython is required for building both open and portable, however, since portable is built using python 2.7, you must install GitPython on both python 2.6 and python 2.7 which, if done using yum (as install instructions suggest) causes python2.6 GitPython to work incorrectly. 

To Reproduce:
- cat the scons executable and notice that the shebang specifies the system python.

Expected Behavior:
- Scons explicitly uses Python 2.7.
- Installation instructions specify that python packages be installed on Python 2.7 

This fix was already merged into master (5.3.4) but there was talk of wanting to merge this into 5.3.3 if possible. So here is the PR if we want to do that, @tst-ccamp @tst-rcrihfield @tst-dsugar 

We'd probably want release notes updated as well, but it looks like there's still an open PR for that, so I'm guessing best to handle it there @tst-mswartz .

The original issue is https://github.com/google/earthenterprise/issues/1604

Verification steps:
1. Set up a reverse proxy to a GEE Server with a WMS-served map
2. Do a GetCapabilitiesRequest to the proxy server, and see in the response that OnlineResource points to the proxy server.
3. Viewing a WMS source should work wether using a reverse proxy or not.
Fixes an intermittent failure in the integration tests where an asset finishes building before the test can check that it's in progress.
Added an option to config for setting the maximum allowed percentage difference between the size of the cache and size of the dirty map.
Implemented check for whether or not to prune the cache when Add or Remove is called determined by whether or not the percentage difference of cache and dirty map size exceeds the configured limit.
The flag indicating whether a database is the default is stored in the publish_context_table. However, if the Open GEE installation is upgraded from an older version (such as 5.1.2), the publish_context_table may be empty. This causes some queries to return no results, making it appear as if published databases were not published at all.
**Describe the bug**

The slack landing page doesn't load and it is controlled outside of the earthenterprise admin group. 

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Click on the link on the GitHub home page for the repo or here: http://slack.opengee.org. The page doesn't load

**Expected behavior**

A page loads allowing the user to sign up for the Slack chatroom

**Additional context**

One solution would be to migrate the slack chat over to Gitter. We have evaluated this before, but it was mostly redundant between the 2 services, so didn't keep it around. However, now that the Slack link is not stable, I believe it's worth revisiting.
Trying out a new system - PRing rsts separately from published files to streamline review process. Opinions welcome!
Refactors the job loop to make it easier to retry failed commands. This PR should not include any function changes; only refactoring and new unit tests. The unit tests were written as early as possible during the refactor and used to ensure that changes did not break or change functionality.

Addresses #1608 

To verify:
Build and publish a map or globe
Use cutter to create a polygon-based cut with Polygon Level (under Advanced) set to 24.

Note: If your polygon is not very small, then the cut will take a very long time. Zoom all the way in before making the polygon (or use a very small polygon from a KML file).

I performed my testing for this on CentOS 6.10.
