Added SPM and update Example project
Trying to quick scroll for top bounce triggers a false color change. Added a video for more context. A UIImageView added to top scrollView for the sticky effect.

Implementation is as in the example, without Swizzling.

The first view controller in my `UINavigationController` has a transparent `UINavigationBar` (by setting the background image to `UIImage()`) with a dark image underneath - the status bar is set to `lightContent` correctly. 

The second view controller sets the `UINavigationBar` background image to `nil`, and sets the background to light grey (in the `viewWillAppear()` lifecycle method) but the status bar remains `lightContent`, when it should display as the default black.

Is this desired behaviour for this module?
Hi,
For iOS projets it's will be great to make your component [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) compatible

Take a look at these articles: 
- [Ruthlessly Simple Dependency Management with Carthage](https://bit.ly/2IWvGks)
- [Carthage Tutorial: Getting Started](https://bit.ly/2zes4dN)
- [Making Carthage-compatible Frameworks with Swift](https://bit.ly/2tXUofp)
- [Swift Cross Platform Framework](https://bit.ly/2ysgETA) (section [Configure targets for Carthage](https://bit.ly/2tZUOSt)) üëç

On your `README.md` add [![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-Compatible-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)  on top and add section for the installation with Carthage.


It would be cool if you had an example project showing how Bartinter works
