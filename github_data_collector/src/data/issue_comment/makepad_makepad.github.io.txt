Cool project! Is it a Rust UI lib that powers the tabs, text editor, etc? Or is it built from scratch for Makepad?
Selecting text takes a significant time to catch up to the moving cursor.

Hey bro... I accidentally left the online makepad demo running overnight and when I checked the Task Manager in chrome (I'm testing on a Parallels Windows 10 VM, this morning, ) I noticed that the memory had grown substantially..

In case you hadn't noticed this I thought I would report it.

While I'm here I have a question... Your turtle graphics implementation.. did you write that from scratch or port it in from somewhere?  If it's borrowed do you mind sharing the original source location?  Thanks.

/W
for example, when transitioning via `setState('selected', false, {dx: this.dx})` to state below, how can I animate `Bg` props with different timing functions than `Text` props?  Is there a way to configure this in the state tree or a lower level API?  I'm assuming nested states are not possible?  I can imagine how to do manually in the `pixel ()` render call but that's no fun!  Considering falling back to rapidly setting multiple states in consecutive frame updates to coordinate the animation, but that feels kind of wrong too...  

```
    ...
    selected:{
	duration:0.3,
	time:{fn:'ease',begin:0,end:10},
	to:{
		Text:{
			dx:0,
		},
		Icon:{
			dx:0,
		},
		Bg:{
			color:'#00000010',
			dx:0,
			selected:1,
		}
	}
     ...
},

Is there a particular config/command you are using for msdfgen?  

Has the included fontencoder source deviated from [Chlumsky/msdfgen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen)? wondering if output from latest (v1.4) ought to work.

Playing around with HUD like UI, need me some Inconsolata :)

@makepaddev, if helpful, I can PR in a few more open-source fonts.
with the following js program:

```
y = 1
y += 2
y *= 3

console.log("hello, world")
```

I find that makepad says `can't find variable y` at the line containing "hello, world"

If I type

```

y = 1
y += 2
y *= 3

console.log("hello, world")
```

The error is reported in the middle of the line containing `y *= 3`

Both times I would have expected the errors to occur at the first occurence of y

I just watched your Revision 2017 seminar and was quite impressed!  I updated README.md to link to the seminar so folks could more easily get a sense of makepad's capabilities.
