This patch allows for longer names. Tested with longest name telegram supports (255 chars)
This resolves an issue where users with greater than or less than signs in their name appear to be html encoded.

Using reply feature on the notification was deminiaturizing the main window, even if the user was on other application, or even in full screen view.

Things get especially weird when in full screen mode. The window deminiaturizes and covers the screen and then goes into the background.

This is my (real bad) implementation of the issue #154.

It adds an option in the general settings view and its value is a bitwise operation of `2 << 29` (the next after `HandleMediaKeysSettings`). I wasn't sure why you started shifting from 1 to 2 so I kept it.

It also, obviously, isn't the best way to implement that option with the maximum sticker size hard-coded in every `blockSize` assignment, but I suck at Objective-C and am not sure I'd do it better without having a lot of time to spend.

The downside is you can't zoom it; I guess the more user-friendly thing would be to make it zoom like an image (perhaps with a full-screen dimmed overlay) on mouse click; the user would still have an option to view all stickers in the stickerset by calling the context menu.

It looks like that:

Feel free to ditch it, just wanted to share with whomever is interested.

Thanks for the awesome project, I've been using it for years. <3

P.S.: I also managed to keep stickers from being shown completely and displaying emoji characters instead, like in the conversations list, but I guess it's not worth a separate pull request. See https://github.com/hatarist/telegram/commit/071fcabebf1fb9b737eabefc5d6ee5bac4399d11


Certain substitutions of emoji for ascii faces were inconsistent, some had a hypen nose, some didn't. I added a version without a hyphen nose for all substitutions that only had the hypen nosed version.

Very simple one.

PLEASE can this be merged, so that we can start a bit more community effort on this project :-)

Thanks
