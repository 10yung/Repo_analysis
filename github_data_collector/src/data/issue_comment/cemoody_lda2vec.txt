I got here from the blog article at https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/05/27/lda2vec/#topic=38&lambda=0.33&term=

I notice that sometimes phrases are considered such as 'classified information' or 'drone strikes'. Since word2vec is at word level only, how did you tackle phrases? Thanks
As we know, Plexity can  evaluate lda model performance. 
What about lda2vec? Is there any code can be referenced? 
thanks! 
when I run lda2vec_run.py Ihad this error "cannot import name 'print_top_words_per_topic' from 'lda2vec' (C:\Users\Asus\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\lib\site-packages\lda2vec__init__.py)" can anyone help me ?
many functions and files are missing in lda2vec library (which is installed using pip) for which I had to move around files from git to the folder where lda2vec is installed. And there were many other spelling and paranthesis mistakes (from python3 point of view). But I am not able to find a function/file by name move. which is necessary in order to run lda2vec_run.py
the error generated is 
File "C:\Users\Sudheera\Downloads\lda2vec-master\examples\hacker_news\lda2vec\lda2vec_model.py", line 3, in <module>
    from lda2vec.utils import move

Spacy v2.0 has added a language submodule in its API. 
Please use `nlp = spacy.load('en')` or `import spacy.lang.en` instead.
I’m trying to adapt this example to my own tweets data, but I got really confused about the loss function calculation.
The calculation in the code is not identical to the formula in the paper.

The above two pictures show the Loss function formula in paper, but in the code, it only contains the first part of the sum, `L^d`. There is a dubious calculation of `l` underlined in the following picture, which I think might be the second part, but it’s not added to the loss before loss.backward().

And I had to add a multiplication of `-clambda` to the original `prior` code (right under the red line in the above picture), because the returned value of model.prior() is actually a minus value of the formula (5) without the lambda factor. 
I don’t know Chainer, so it’s very hard to decide whether `l` was calculated correctly as the second part of the sum and could be readily added to the `loss` before `backward()`. It's also hard to decide the intention of the `fraction` variable and whether it should be multiplied to the `l` part of the sum too. Actually, I tried adding `l` to `loss` without multiplying it to `fraction` but didn’t get the expected result.
To get preprocess.py running for Hacker News, I did the following from the lda2vec root:
```
mkdir ./examples/hacker_news/lib
cp -r ./lda2vec ./examples/hacker_news/lib/
```
In the hacker_news data/preprocess.py file I added the following:
```
import sys
sys.path.append('./lib')
```
In the hacker_news lda2vec module in /lib , I added the following to `preprocess.py`:
```
import spacy
spacy.load('en')
from spacy.lang.en import English
# from spacy.en import English
```
In my python environment I did the following:
```
python -m spacy download en
```
Note that pandas is a requirement.
Then, in lda2vec/exampels/hacker_news you can run `python ./data/preprocess.py`
Will update if I get everything else working.
Just found that in the twenty_newsgroups example, the downsampled word list is never used after calculation: https://github.com/cemoody/lda2vec/blob/b7f4642b750c6e792c07d177bd57ad36e65bb35c/examples/twenty_newsgroups/data/preprocess.py#L46

I fixed this by moving the downsampling to an earlier place and changing all the later "pruned" to "clean", but some preprocessing results like `vocab.pkl`, `corpus.pkl`, and `vectors` are still not influenced by the downsampling and the further solution (if needed) seems not straightforward.
I build and install correctly ``setup.py` at the rooth,
No problem with running script in lda2vec folder, but when i try to run `lda2vec_run.py` in twenty news group example folder it return : 
```Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "lda2vec2.7/lda2vec-master/examples/twenty_newsgroups/data/preprocess.py", line 17, in <module>
    from lda2vec import preprocess, Corpus
ImportError: No module named lda2vec```
Add the path with sys.path.append() doesn't change anything .
