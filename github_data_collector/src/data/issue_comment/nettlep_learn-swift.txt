Hi. Thanks for the awesome work.
While reading through the comments I found some typos which I fixed in this pull request.

Hi,
In tuples example there is this example:

`// We can also specify the type in order to avoid inferrence`
`let someOtherTuple = (Double(100), Bool(false))`

I think comment for example is not true because type of `someOtherTuple` is still inferred from content. Right example for this comment would be:

`let someOtherTuple: (Double, Bool) = (100, false)`

In this way we are avoiding inferrence and we will get error if we specify content with wrong type.

Hi, nettlep:

I already started translating this project into localization `zh-TW`([正體中文](http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/繁体中文)).
Current process of translation are `README.md` and `1a. The Basics.playground`, the branch was hosted here: [translate_zh-TW](https://github.com/tsunghao/learn-swift/tree/translate_zh-TW).<br />

If you are OK with that, I will continue my translation on that `translate_zh-TW` branch and merged into my forked `master` branch later. If not, I will remove the public translation branch, thanks for your learn-swift project.
