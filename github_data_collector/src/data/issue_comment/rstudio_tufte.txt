I'd expected that pandoc will work inside the `tufte::quote_footer()`. But it didn't: it is aligned, but not converted.

```

In `.html` version (i tried `html_document`, `ioslides_presentation`, `slidy_presentation`) citation is converted but not aligned:

> `r tufte::quote_footer(' [@dorian10: 3]')`
```

But it did work with the `tufte::tufte_html: default` output:

So I think, that it should be somehow written or changed [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/tufte-quotes.html).

Here is the bibtex entry that I used:

This is a question and issue that has not received an answer on Stackoverflow after a day. 
[floating TOC in tufte book](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57846247/floating-toc-in-tufte-book)

Since I posted it I've confirmed it in another approach to standing up a stock tufte book. I believe this is real, although I confess that I'm still learning.

Here is a few-line modification to the index.Rmd file for the demo:

```

```
Inclusion of toc: true works. The **top_float: true** insertion results in the error:

```
Error in rmarkdown::html_document(..., extra_dependencies = c(extra_dependencies,  : 
  You must use a theme when specifying the 'toc_float' option
Calls: <Anonymous> ... html_chapters -> base_format -> html_document2 -> <Anonymous>
Execution halted

Exited with status 1.
```
This happens with the toc lines where they are shown and also as an argument to the tufte::tufte_html: line.

I don't see that the need to include a theme is included in the toc section in the "Definitive Guide" book. In any case, addition of a theme in what I think is the normal way doesn't help.  I'd appreciate some help. 

I have written and am currently using a variation of tufte format starting from (the award-winning!)  [programmingforpsych](https://github.com/CrumpLab/programmingforpsych/blob/master/index.Rmd) but I think I'd prefer to stick with the standard tufte package. But only if I can include the floating toc.

Thanks in advance for your help.

stackoverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56754848/footnotes-not-converting-to-sidenotes-using-tufte-tint

I am using the tufte/tint R packages to produce html documents using Rstudio-server (v1.2.1335) and R version 3.6.0 on a x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu platform.

Footnotes inserted using `^[side note]` are shown in the main body with the superscript in the correct location but no footnote in the margin (or anywhere else).

References/citations are correctly rendered as sidenotes and does using `margin_note()`.

I updated the tufte and tint packages and rmarkdown to the newest versions, as well as pandoc.

I previously rendered the same document on a Rstudio-desktop installation on a windows machine running pandoc at a version below 2.x which produced the expected format for the sidenotes inserted using a footnote. Updating Rstudio and pandoc to it's most recent release on that windows machine resulted in the document no longer being rendered with correct footnotes/sidenotes.

I am not getting an error messages nor am I familiar enough with what is going on under the hood to even know where to start to figure out why the newer pandoc version doesn't seem to render them correctly and/or how to fix the issue or create a workaround.

Any suggestions?

\pagestyle{headings}

```

I am not sure if there is another option. But introducing \pagestyle in only one chapter of the 10 chapters of the book, the header style is applied to the entire book. I think that may lead to problems in case that I want to have a different header in the appendix or introduction chapter. 
Is there a way to apply the changes to only the chapter where \pagestyle{headings} is written?

Example Rmarkdown in tufte html:

```
* Test test
* A-GPS^[*Assisted-GPS*] circuitry and sky-facing antennae
* test test 
```

Document knits OK, Footnote is rendered in the margin, but the margin is not aligned with the margin over and below. 

(Rstudio 1.2, all packages updated to newest versions, macOS 10.14.1).

(BTW: Thanks a lot for all the great work on various aspects of everything R-related! <3)
The Tufte pdf handout rendering seems to have an issue aligning 'margin figure' and main text. I believe the top of the 'margin figure' should align with the first line of the text after the {marginfigure} markdown block, but it doesn't. The html rendering is good. (i am not sure whether this is a pandoc problem or tufte package problem though.)

Hi,

Is there a way to number the sections via the YAML header?

Thank you!
Thanks for the terrific package—and for the whole knitrverse!

I wonder if there's a bug that affects links placed inside fig.cap when working with LaTeX (tufte_handout or tufte_book). Here's a MWE:

~~~r
---
title: "Minimal Working Example"
output: tufte::tufte_handout  # but tufte::tufte_html is fine
---

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse venenatis fringilla libero at tristique. 

```{r fig.cap="A plot of the famous [cars data set](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/cars.html)."}
plot(cars)
```

Aliquam ut enim sodales, semper libero nec, bibendum velit. Pellentesque ultrices magna justo, in faucibus orci consequat sit amet.
~~~

This gives me the result:

Whereas substituting `tufte::tufte_html` seems to work as expected.

Digging into the generated `.tex` file, it looks like the problem is the link just hasn't been converted from markdown to LaTeX:

```latex
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{MWE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-1-1} \caption[A plot of the famous [cars data set](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/cars.html)]{A plot of the famous [cars data set](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/cars.html).}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-1}
\end{figure}
```
Thanks for the great package.  I am using it to write a bookdown book with HTML and PDF output.

My problem is that I am trying to center a margin figure instead of accepting the defaul of left-align.  PDF output works fine, but HTML output does not handle the below snippet properly:

```
{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', fig.asp=.75, 
fig.margin = TRUE, out.width = "30%", fig.align = "center"}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Output puts figure in center of main text instead of centering in margin:
