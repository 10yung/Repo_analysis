**I'm submitting a Repo corruption report**

Unlike GitHub, GitLab has stricter fsck requirements and so does my Git installation. When I tried to clone this repo, I got the `zeroPaddedFilemode` errors. Eventually I changed my `.gitconfig` to ignore the errors but when I pushed to GitLab, it rejected my push because of these errors. Unfortunately, I can't change GitLab's config of my repo forked from this.

## Repro

```
$ git fsck --full --strict

## Solution

The only known fix is to rebuild the repo using Git's `fast-export` and `fast-import` commands.

```sh
git fast-export --all | (cd ../empty-repo/ && git fast-import)
```

Here's the [`zeroPaddedFilemode`](https://stackoverflow.com/q/14700502/1526863) Q/A on StackOverflow for further reference.

**Note:** _I know that we probably won't rebuild the repo since the SHAs change but I'm putting the issue here for the future reference._
