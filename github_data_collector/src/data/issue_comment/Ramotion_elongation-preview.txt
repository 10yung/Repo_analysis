Is it possible to use this library on a current project that does not utilize the storyboard and everything is coded including tableviews and collection view and its corresponding custom cells. 
Is it possible to show the detailviewcontroller with a navigation bar?
elongation-preview implement using pod file, and when i push -> error like this 

Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: '-[UITableViewController loadView] instantiated view controller with identifier "ViewController" from storyboard "Home", but didn't get a UITableView.'
while holding and touching a cell to show the middle info section the constraints or animations get ruined .. is there any way i can fix this help me out..
