How do i disable x16r algo in the mining program please do let me know as my machine is mining only x16r
the attachment shall give you an idea of the error that I am facing

the setup runs smoothly on 2 gpu & 3 gpu rigs but on a 5 gpu rig it just stalls

This will allow a much better fine tuning in with pool we will mine each algo considering a autoswitch multi-algo setup. Sometimes the "generic" threshold is too low or too high for an specific algo.
I want to mine phi2 on bsod only
and, x17 on yiimp
But, your miner is mining phi2 on bsod and yiimp both. How can i turn off phi2 on yiimp?
Also want to mine hsr on zpool. but when i enable zpool its mining all 2 algos phi2,x17 and hsr on zoop.
please suggest how to edit.
lyra2v2 fastest
In current miner setting its mining Top Rev/Day
I want to mine the algo with top Profit/Day
In fact, Its better to consider net profit excluding Rev/day-Power-PoolFee-MinerFee
