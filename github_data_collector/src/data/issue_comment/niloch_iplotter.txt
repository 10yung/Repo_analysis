First of all this is a great library that implements really well into the jupyter notebook.  I could see this working really well with Flask as well.  I generally use pandas for my analysis.  Would you be open to adding pandas integration into iplotter or accepting a PR with pandas integration.  I have roughed out the idea in my fork https://github.com/WaylonWalker/iplotter.  I would like to include most of the pandas dataframe.plot() methods, as well as new features from the JavaScript Libraries.
