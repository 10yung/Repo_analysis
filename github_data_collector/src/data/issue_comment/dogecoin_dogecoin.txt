I am trying to use the new wallet (version 1.14.2), but when I send dogecoin to other addresses txid is not recognized in the block explorers and also does not start the configuration, it is infinitely 0 confirmations, it has been 5 days. 0 confirmations, the fee charged was 1 DOGE, I'm using dogecoind and dogecoin-cli is there any way to fix this problem? I really want to use the doge wallet in this version, I've tried 1.14.0 too, and the bug also happens the same way.

Estou tentando usar a nova carteira (versão 1.14.2), porém quando eu envio dogecoin para outros endereços a txid não é reconhecida nos exploradores de blocos e também não inicia a configuração, fica infinitamente em 0 confirmações, ja faz 5 dias que esta em 0 confirmações, a taxa cobrada foi de 1 DOGE, estou usando dogecoind e dogecoin-cli existe alguma forma de corrigir esse problema? eu quero muito usar a carteira de doge nessa versão, , ja tentei também a 1.14.0, e o bug também acontece da mesma forma.
Why are the rewards still high! DOGE is being hyper inflamed, and yet the mining rewards are still super high. I know that miners are important but flooding the market with coins is not the solution.
 
I dont know man, im just worried that DOGE will still be the way it is, DOGE is still having a small bit of growth but I really want to help it increase in value.

You know your stuff more than me so I might be wrong, but what is the reasoning? Could the rewards not change? Are you taking any actions in increasing DOGE value?
Dogecoin: Spot's Version
---

Spot thinks Dogecoin can validate 100k+ tps because [Dogecoin transactions are logically sequential but validate in logarithmic time](https://word.site/2019/11/25/rtxi/).

### what

Time is running low! A few fat cats had a clever plan. They sent out their minions to run circles around the neighborhood dogs, making them all confused and angry at each other.

Spot used to play chase with lots of cats, and he knows how they think. They hate the idea of being outsmarted.

**Spot's 3 Requests**

* Commit to sunset segwit and P2SH on a reasonable timeframe
* Remove the block limit immediately (4 weeks)
* Resync with BSV upstream until Satoshi's opcodes are implemented and rigorously verified

Or else,

* Dogecoin SV forks off of Dogecoin and disables segwit/P2SH soft fork validation on **December 28, 2019**.

## Expected behaviour
The dogecoin chain merkelizes all data necessary for verification and has no block limit. 

## Actual behaviour
The dogecoin chain currently snips signatures and p2sh data and has a block limit. Additonally, some opcodes appear disabled.

I do `sendtoaddress` via rpc of dogecoin client v1.14-rc-1 on Ubuntu

`"{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"method\": \"sendtoaddress\", \"params\": [\"$address\",$amount] }"`

And some of my reponses returns txs however they never appear in blockchain and have 0 confirmations unless I push transaction hex in https://live.blockcypher.com/doge/pushtx/

Here is example of this transaction

`https://dogechain.info/tx/0fb6a740b8e1e19d4a3b466d590602577d35c74b38001c13fee52c04bd54b5a9`

```
stdClass Object
(
    [result] => stdClass Object
        (
            [amount] => -20.005
            [fee] => -1
            [confirmations] => 0
            [trusted] => 
            [txid] => 0fb6a740b8e1e19d4a3b466d590602577d35c74b38001c13fee52c04bd54b5a9
            [walletconflicts] => Array
                (
                )

            [time] => 1573568266
            [timereceived] => 1573568266
            [bip125-replaceable] => unknown
            [details] => Array
                (
                    [0] => stdClass Object
                        (
                            [account] => 
                            [address] => DRAXeUEhQTpCQGRuqFGhT4DbwSUzRKk2Ai
                            [category] => send
                            [amount] => -20.005
                            [vout] => 1
                            [fee] => -1
                            [abandoned] => 
                        )

                )

            [hex] => I will remove this line for security reasons
        )

    [error] => 
    [id] => 
)
```

Difference between wrong transaction and normal that wrong transaction [bip125-replaceable] => unknown
And normal is [bip125-replaceable] => no

After some transaction appear to be broke all next sendtoaddress transactions never appear in blockchain as well

Any solutions? How to avoid this?
I would recommend you guys(devs) to remove and edit the readme info on this page.
