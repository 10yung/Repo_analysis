I would like to specify the correct DTD for the XML file used. How should I do this? Right now I consider enhancing AEXMLOptions.DocumentHeader with 3 additional optional values which would allow specifying the correct settings for the DTD (see eg. https://xmlwriter.net/xml_guide/doctype_declaration.shtml). Any better idea? 

Many thanks in advance!

Hi, I have the following XML in Data class.

I am trying to convert the above Data object to AEXMLDocument for xml and it is missing few elements. 

let data = try Data(contentsOf: url)
                                                    let xmlDoc = try AEXMLDocument(xml: data)
                                                    Print.print("VCD Downloaded Doc is.... \(xmlDoc.xml)")

Can you please check it?
Did anybody face this issue? It looks like `XMLParserDelegate` sometimes doesn't call `parser(_ parser: XMLParser, foundCharacters string: String)`
Didn't see this issue in the documentation but it's only hitting the first node in my XML document.  For example I have multiple "Alert" nodes 
```
<CTAAlerts>
<TimeStamp>20171127 11:47</TimeStamp>
<ErrorCode>0</ErrorCode>
<ErrorMessage/>
<Alert>...</Alert>
<Alert>...</Alert>
<Alert>...</Alert>
```
Even though I'm using a for loop it only returns the value I want from the first node and ignores the rest.  Am I missing a feature that's not mentioned?
I'm trying to understand the preferred way to access declared namespaces. I can get a dictionary of the declared namespaces from the root element's attributes. Is there a more direct way?

Also, if process namespaces is set to true, I can't find anywhere where the namespace is saved. #34 covers this; am I correct in understanding that the namespace is just removed and discarded?
Hi Everybody how can write `CDATA` by `AEXML`
Hi,

Thanks for this nice library!
I'm having some trouble sending json within my XML document though.
When I add a child element with a json string value e.g. `{"serviceAction":"xxx"}` the AEXML library returns `{&quot;serviceAction&quot; : &quot;xxx&quot;}`

Is it possible to make a flag on AEXMLElement that lets you disable the escaping?
