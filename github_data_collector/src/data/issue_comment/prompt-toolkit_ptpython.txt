Installed ptipython but see an error saying `prompt_toolkit` version is too high.

Manually installed a compatible version (2.0.9), but I can't highlight and copy text on this version of `prompt_toolkit`.
I don't see any documentation, just the readme file ?
For example I would like to change Function keys to Alt (I use Tmux screens and the function keys take me to screens), how can I save the options I select with F2.
Sorry for posting this as an issue but I don't know where else to look, I've not see a reddit page or blog or forum etc. 
Thanks in advance. 
I have the following script in a file [simplified from the actual case]

```
# /tmp/test.py
from collections import defaultdict
a = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(list))
a[1][1].append(1)
print(a)
```

When I execute these in the ptpython REPL, everything works fine - prints out 
`defaultdict(<function <lambda> at 0x7f8ecc06a488>, {'1': defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {1: [1]})})`

When I try to execute this script from the command line as 

`ptpython /tmp/test.py`

an error is thrown:

```

NameError: name 'defaultdict' is not defined
```


I am in a virtual environment (though leaving my virtual environment doesn't change the error).  I am using ptpython version 2.0.6, installed with pip, on ubuntu 18.04, with python 3.6.3


When I run this file with `python /tmp/test.py` , `bpython /tmp/test.py`, and `ipython /tmp/test.py`, each of them correctly prints out my defaultdict - only ptpython throws this NameError


Let me know if any further information would be helpful!

Styling appears to demand a prompt_toolkit.styles.Style rather than a dict, and
works with one, but the assert demands a dict.
1. anaconda for python 3.7
2. pip install ptpython
3. ptipython
4. input below command
   %pylab   #it will use matplotlib backend: Qt5Agg
   x = np.linspace(0,6,1000)
   y= np.sin(x)
   plt.plot(x,y)

the Figure1 window rised, but show nothing.

Thanks
Recently cleaned my machine (Mac OSX El Capitan) of all python distros and reinstalled Python 3.5 only. After this, entering the command ```$ptpython``` fails with the following error:
```
-bash: /usr/local/bin/ptpython: No such file or directory
```
Tried ``` pip uninstall ptpyhon``` and then ``` pip install ptpython``` , which installs everything again, but command ```ptpython``` still fails with the same error. Also tried removing ```/usr/local/bin/ptpython``` directory and trying fresh install with no luck.

How can I fully remove ptpython from my machine and get it working again with my new python installation?
I ran into a strange issue while using [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) with ptpython. When attempting to use the packing function p32 this error came up.

I'll be happy to provide more context if that will help solve the issue.

The custom color scheme is a dictionary.  I tried the classmethod `Style.from_dictionary()` but it didn't work either.
