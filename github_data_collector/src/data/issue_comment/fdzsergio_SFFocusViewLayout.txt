How do I change the background color of the layout? Change on `collectionView.backgroundColor` has no effect.

<img width="387" alt="screen shot 2017-04-18 at 8 23 35 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17073950/25146647/ec92905a-2474-11e7-83c9-c1bb1b76a777.png">

And is it possible to have the layout end at the bottom of the `collectionView`?
Thanks for the assistance.
Hi Sergio, firstly thank you for this repo. How can I do parallax effect for this pod like UltraVisualApp ? I'll be glad, if you help me.
This fixes #16. Basically it is a workaround for a weird Xcode 8.2 behavior which might not get fixed but instead defined as the new expected behavior, so we should update the framework.
I have just tried to install version 3.1.0 via Carthage but it failed. It looks to me as if this is a similar issue to https://github.com/ninjaprox/NVActivityIndicatorView/pull/102 which is basically a strange Xcode 8.2 behavior. I think specifying only Swift 3.0 instead of 3.0.1 will fix this.
Is there by any chance a possibility to change the background of the collectionView? In color or Image? Once the user has scrolled through the content, there is a grey space of half the screen. Doesn't look too good. Any idea?
Downloaded the example project. Run. Lldb crash. Fail.
I used cocoapods to install but I cannot locate any documents to show how how to use this pod please help
This fixes an NSInternalInconsistencyExceptionn that occurs when using SFFocusViewLayout with AsyncDisplayKit. The commit message has more details.

With the new iOS 10's pre-fetching strategy the layout is overlapping cells
