Just came across üëÜ as I was setting up a mac from scratch today.

The end of an era :(  ...will miss the glasses icon in the menu bar

`spectacle` has been a great productivity tool.. Thanks for all the work you've done
Undo function does not work on double monitor setup. When I move app from screen to screen I cannot undo it.
I really like the tool and I use it for years, lately I got a to work on a windows pc, and I actually think that the way the snap is working on windows is better. It is hard to explain exactly the shortcuts, but it feel very natural.

Do you think it will be possible to implement a windows mode?
Currently, Full Screen actually triggers the native full-screen that takes over all monitors. I very often find myself using Shift-Option-Maximize on windows to make them take up the entire screen without entering the native full-screen mode.

If none of these words are actual terminology that's meaningful (sorry!), here's the difference I mean. Fullscreen currently does the same thing as the green dot here:

I would love to see an additional option to do the Shift-Option variant of that same green dot.

Thank you for the work you put into this app, I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è 
To Save Battery:

Turn display off, and not put the system to sleep!
`$pmset displaysleepnow.
`
Allow the user to configure/set his own combination of keys for this!
I think it would be nice to add an option to make the window full height on the current display.
I'm wondering if this feature already exists or not!? if not, Don't you think that it would be beneficial for many people to have that feature!? 
I'd love to be able to switch focus to a specific window by typing a few letters of its title - this would entail enumerating all active windows (and Cocoa compliant tabs) and having a separate hotkey to pop up a search widget (which could hang off the menu, like the Spotlight of yore), but would be a godsend for those of us who have RSI and/or trouble moving their hands to and fro the keyboard (no more Cmd-Tabbing everywhere)
I press from menu, or use key combination for going to pushing window to next display, but it does nothing, I hear just default mac sound for unsupported key combination (like in terminal if you type control+z).

I have:
- MacOS Mojave 10.14.4
- Spectacle 10.14.4
When I try and run Spectacle, I get an error message saying, "Build Error: Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code".
