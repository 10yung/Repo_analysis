Does ECSlidingViewController supports underLeftViewController to be on top of topViewController
Hello I need to pass values from One to another controller but I am not getting any lifecycle method called Neither viewDidLoad() NOR viewWillAppear() Please Help Me for Two Methods -- 

1> Called Single Time and 

2> Every Time When We Scroll View.

Delegate method never works like lifecycle method.
I am able to get the pan gesture to work very well with the slider, however, when I added an interactivePopGestureRecognizer to dismiss a view controller that was pushed, I experience weird issues.  If I do the following, I get a black screen while transitioning via interactivePopGestureRecognizer. 

1)  Add pan gesture to slider: [self.view addGestureRecognizer:self.slidingViewController.panGesture]; 
2)  Add interactive pop gesture to a view controller (call this PushedVC) that will be pushed
3)  Use pan gesture to open and close slider
4)  Open PushedVC, use pan gesture to go back.  Notice black screen.

Any help would be nice, this has been a pain in my ass for the past two hours.

Hi,

I've run `pod install` on Examples directory as `Podfile` is there but it has shown this error:

`Invalid 'Podfile' file: [!] The specification of 'link_with' in the Podfile is now unsupported, please use target blocks instead..`

What should be done to get it install the pod?

CocoaPods version 1.1.1
Xcode 8.1 (swift3)
macOS Sierra 10.12.1

Great work, btw!
