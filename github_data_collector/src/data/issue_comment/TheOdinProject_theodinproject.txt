Fix #1021 issue
Removed fixed height to cause profile card to not stretch image (See screenshot below: green circle with "B" inside).

Profile card image will decrease in total size, but in my opinion this is a more aesthetic display of the image.

I believe I've fixed this issue I was having (in chrome):

https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject/issues/1021


At different sizes the profile card stretches the image inside.

I believe this could be solved just by adding a `<div>` around in it. Happy to work on this.
