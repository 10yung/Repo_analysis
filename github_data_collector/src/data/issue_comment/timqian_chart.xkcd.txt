again, something to scratch my own itch. Maybe it can help with #41 .

Thank you!!
I'm trying to use the latest version (HEAD, not released) using Webpack and I get this error. Using the latest official npm release doesn't have this problem.

Hey @timqian! 👋

Just wanted to reach out about funding your work on `chart.xkcd`.

@transitive-bullshit and I are both open source maintainers, and we're exploring new ways to make OSS funding a viable source of income.

We're currently looking at building rate-limited SaaS APIs on top of existing OSS libraries, reserving the majority of profits for the original authors. [We've built a few](https://saasify.sh/#/showcase) at this point, but want to keep adding more.

I think `chart.xkcd` would be a great fit, and I'd love to use it to build a SaaS API for rendering graphs to images. We'd handle dev, auth, billing and support so you wouldn't have to do anything.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 🙏

Fix #42 

Due to `options` wasn't passed in `Line` object, it was getting `options.dataColors` as the `[ ]` empty due to which it wasn't getting any colors to plot

**Screenshot before and after this change**
I was using `index.html` charts example to test things out, so i had used the empty `options` for `Line` chart to replicate
