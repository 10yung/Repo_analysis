text1.svg text2.svg can not be shown in demo

Hey Master, Can you add it to support macOS?
Was running the _leaks_ instrument on an app I'm working on and it says there's a leak in the line:
```
document = Snowflake.Document(fileName: someFileName)
```

Also tried running the _leaks_ instrument on the example project and it is identifying leaks when rendering some shapes. For example choose _Misc_ and then _path_s2_. 

Not sure what to do with this. Can it be safely ignored?
