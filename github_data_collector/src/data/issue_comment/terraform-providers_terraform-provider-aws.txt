Running a typical upload of file to S3 results in large memory usage when file size is large. Example below : 

```
resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "object" {
  bucket = "your_bucket_name"
  key    = "new_object_key"
  source = "path/to/file"
  etag = "${filemd5("path/to/file")}"
}
```

When uploading a large **file of 3.5GB** the terraform process increased in memory from the typical 85MB (resident set size) up **to 4GB** (resident set size). The memory size remains high even when waiting at the "apply changes" prompt.

It looks like the use of **filemd5()** function is generating the md5 checksum by loading the entire file into memory and **then not releasing that memory** after finishing.  

The problem is increased when processing multiple files (using a fileset() function for a for loop) e.g. : 
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "files-store-ibm-ilmt-bigfix" {
  for_each = fileset("${path.module}/files-for-uploading/", "*")
  bucket  = "your_bucket_name"
  key     = "files-uploaded/${each.value}"
  source  = each.value
  etag    = "${filemd5("${path.module}/files-for-uploading/${each.value}")}"
}
```

**Environment :** 
Fedora Linux 29 on a 8GB RAM laptop (runs out of RAM easily with this issue).

```
terraform -v
Terraform v0.12.13
provider.aws v2.45.0
provider.null v2.1.2
```


**Expected Outcome :**
Create the md5 checksum reading file in buffers of sensible size.  I tried running the "md5sum" utility under linux (fedora 29) on the 3.5GB file and this 1.3MB  (resident set size).  That would be a good example of how to implement the checksum.

**Workaround :** 
My current workaround for this may help others with problem. Its not ideal in that it is using a shell command but works well for now. Use alternative below : 

```
resource "null_resource" "files-store-upload" {
  triggers = {
    always_run = "${timestamp()}"
  }
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "aws s3 sync ${path.module}/files-for-uploading/ s3://${aws_s3_bucket.files-store.id}/uploaded-files/"
  }
}
```

The _amazing_ example of creating an EKS cluster and then connecting terraform to it on the [aws_eks_cluster_auth](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/d/eks_cluster_auth.html) documentation should be updated with a warning indicating that it will prevent imports from working, pending https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13018 .

### Terraform Version

N/A documentation issue

### Affected Resource(s)

* aws_eks_cluster_auth
* aws_eks_cluster

### Terraform Configuration Files

See example on documentation at https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/d/eks_cluster_auth.html

### Expected Behavior

Examples on documentation should not break anything without warning.

### Actual Behavior

The documentation example breaks terraform imports, even for unrelated providers/resources.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create an EKS cluster and set up a kubernetes provider following the example on the documentation
2. Attempt to import a resource (`terraform import ...`)

### References

Closes #7332

### Description
Adds support for kinesisanalyticsv2 API which enables supporting the Flink runtime as requested in #7332.

This is a breaking change as written, so I would like feedback on the best way to go about adding this support. My best alternative approach thus far is to make a new resource type, perhaps a `kinesis_analytics_application_v2`, with the new schema defined here.

I have refrained from updating the documentation until the issue of where support for this new API should live is resolved.

This is my first contribution. I tried to follow the contributor guidelines, but please let me know if I missed something.
