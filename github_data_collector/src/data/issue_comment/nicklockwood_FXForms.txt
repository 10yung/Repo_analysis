Allow resolving FXForms as a dependency through Carthage
For the normal textfield, i was able to change the font and color by using 

    "textLabel.textColor": textFieldTheme.color, "textLabel.font": labelTheme.font, "textField.font": textFieldTheme.font, "textField.textColor": textFieldTheme.color

But when I tried to change the font for gender field, it says that the gender field doesn't have a key call textField. In this case is there any way that i can still change the font and color for the selected gender that is displayed?

Hi,
When using European numerical pad, decimal point is a comma (and not the dot we all know and use).
So when entering a number to a cell of numeric/float type , the "setValue" function inside FXForms.m convert it to double and basically remove the dot and practically convert it to int.
To handle it, the "double value" need to be replaced with NSNumber formatter. 

This is the problematic line of code:
                value = [(NSString *)value length]? @([value doubleValue]): nil;

These are the lines that can be used to replace the above:
                NSNumberFormatter *nf = [NSNumberFormatter new];
                value = [(NSString *)value length] ? @([[nf numberFromString:value] doubleValue]) : nil;

The result is a numeric number (with a dot instead of comma).

Thanks

Hi!

I've got different background colors on different settings screens and do not know how to set them the same.

I am working on Navamsa application (https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/id1125810120).
My settings screen uses FXForms.

In storyboard I created a viewController: SettingsViewController
class SettingsViewController: FXFormViewController {
    override func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) {
        formController.form = SettingsMainForm ();
    }
}

class SettingsMainForm: NSObject, FXForm {
    var settingsLocationForm: SettingsLocationForm?
    func settingsAboutFormField() -> AnyObject {
        return [
            FXFormFieldTitle: "Help"
            ,FXFormFieldType: FXFormFieldTypeBitfield
        ]
    }
}

class SettingsLocationForm: NSObject, FXForm {
}

The background color of viewController: SettingsViewController in storyboard is set to (244, 244, 244) DeviceRGB.

In simulator bg color of main settings form is (244, 244, 244), but bg color of about form is (239, 239, 244). And I stuck.
Basically, I want one section of the form to consist of only a single UIView. I created a subclass of FXFormBaseCell and added a UIView as subview and gave it as FXFormFieldTemplate. But the form is still showing a field with a textfield. 
Is there a way I can set the field to be my custom UIView?
I want to add weekdays on options picker but I want to display them with first 2 letters after they are picked (on main form).

Can I use 2 transformers, one for the picker and one for the main form?

or maybe any other way?
I have an array of objects that is structured so that each object has a uid and a name as well as some other information. Ideally I would like to provide the array as a datasource, but have FXForms only display the name as an option. Then when one or more are selected, I would ideally like to have a new array of objects ( rather than just names ) is this type of behavior possible using FXForms, my apologies for being vague, I really love the build in functionality, just trying to figure out if I can use it.

This changes was to fix crash in the Swift Application when array item is NSNull.

Steps to reproduce the crash
1. tap multiple times the 'Add Item'.
2. prepare empty field a plurality.
3. Any tap an empty field.
4. crash in 'setValue'.
