When using OpenJDK 11 on CentOS 7, I see warnings about illegal reflective access operations that show up after startup.

Output from systemctl -l status graylog-server:

## Context
I have not done any testing on this and the service seems to startup and run.

## Your Environment
Graylog server 3.1.4+1149fe1
JRE: Oracle Corporation 11.0.5 on Linux 3.10.0-1062.9.1.el7.x86_64
Deployment: rpm
OS: CentOS Linux 7 (Core) (centos)
Arch: amd64
This adds a missing `DateTimeUtils.setCurrentMillisSystem()` to avoid
a sporadic test failure in `DBJobTriggerServiceTest`.

The `SearchesCleanUpJobWithDBServicesTest` is using
`DateTimeUtils.setCurrentMillisFixed()` to set the time to a specific
value. This requires the usage of `DateTimeUtils.setCurrentMillisSystem()`
to reset the time to the current time. Otherwise tests running in the
same JVM using the current time might fail.

I noticed that the `DBJobTriggerServiceTest#deleteCompleted` test method
failed from time to time on a new Jenkins worker machine. This is
probably due to a changed execution order because the machine is faster
than the older worker machine. Still, strange that it didn't show up
earlier.
Store Alert search timerange and Event type (Alert, Event, Both) in
local storage, letting users come back to the page and have the same
settings as last time they were there.

Fixes #6796
This PR makes some improvements in the UI around support for Lookup Table Parameters in Filter & Aggregation Alerts, and also removes two warnings from the developer console:
- `Warning: Failed prop type: The prop `children` is marked as required in `<<anonymous>>`, but its value is ``null``.`
- `Warning: validateDOMNesting(...): <h5> cannot appear as a descendant of <p>.`

Adds frontend validation to multiple aggregation condition. Doing the validation in the backend didn't really work, since a non-valid expression tree won't be parsed by Jackson and can't be validated in a custom way in the same way other configuration is.

This is how it looks like while editing the form:

And this is after the server answers with a 400 error:

Fixes #7149
In the context of a dashboard there are four related actions, to configure the dashboard (Edit, Save, Save as, Share). "Edit", "Save" and "Save as" create a notification, on a successful save. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46300478/72613283-63de9880-392f-11ea-9aae-d6b6d23a76f0.png)

This is not the case when the user successfully configuring the sharing. The user receives no feedback. Showing a notification will increase the usability and is consistent, in the context of the other actions.

I had a look at #7146 (Context menu for fields is off in search sidebar for long field names) and could not really find a dynamic solution.

We are using `react-window` to render only a part of the probably large field list. The related list component needs to render the list items with `position: absolute`. Which means there is no elegant way to define a dynamic width for the list. There is also no way to have list items with a dynamic height, otherwise wrapping the list items would be a possible solution.

Another possible solution, is setting the Dropdown placement to `bottom`. It would fix the described behaviour, but is not working perfectly for list items near the bottom of the browser window. I also prefer a consistent placement of the field action context menu.

The only workaround I can image right now is setting the list width based on the field with the longest title. but this solution requires some not so dynamic calculation and feels kind of hacky.

Because we plan to implement an overlay solution which opens the context menu near the cursor, increasing the lists width seems to be the most pragmatic solution right now. This works for field names with a length of up to 60 characters.

This PR fixes the behaviour described in #7211 (allowing negative numbers for refresh and cycle interval) regarding the full screen dashboard config modal, mainly by adding a HTML form element.

I had to adjust the form submit inside the related tests, because submitting the form by triggering a click on the save button results in the following error:
`Not implemented: HTMLFormElement.prototype.submit`.

Fixes #7211

## Motivation and Context
<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->
<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->

Prior to this change, the search controls consisted of icons only. This
required the user to remember their meaning or waiting for the tooltips
to appear.

This change is aiming to improve this by:

  - Adding text to the load/save buttons
  - Putting other options into a dropdown and adding text
  - Renaming "Empty search" to "Reset search"
  - Fixing the "Reset search" functionality

Fixes #7168.
Fixes #7162.
