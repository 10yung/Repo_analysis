I intend to test Skyline to monitor anomalous behavior of cpu usage across several instances hosted on the company's DC.

I fully understand how to config skyline to find anomalous behavior of a server cpu vs its timeseries.

What I want to achieve is to find anomalous behavior of this instance vs the rest of the servers as a function of time. It will help us flag unwanted behavior of a distributed system that allocates more work (or harder computation) to that instance.

For example: the mean cpu for all servers is 30%. one instance is now at 40% for 1 hour. 
Whereas if this cpu behavior could be found anomalous against its timeseries - after 1 hour of that usage - it will be flagged as normal.    
In my case, because the 40% is compared against 30% - it would definitely be flagged as anomalous for the entire cycle.


When attempting to start analyzer with ./analyzer.d start the test run fails getting attributes on a series object. 

Not expecting a response, going to detail my investigation here and hoped someone would post if they had any clue. 

```[user@skyline bin]# ./analyzer.d start

Skyline is crashing every time it reaches 2k Metrics. Analyzer.log stops recording any metrics. While horizon logs are working fine. Please advise on how can i fix these issues and are there any alternatives available in the market that I can look into.


Add the option to parameterize the sending of emails.

Not handling it causes analyzer to crash.

At the moment when f.ex. carbon-relay will be restarted
on the other side listener will end up in infinite loop
reading 0 bytes all the time.

When a recv returns 0 bytes, it means the other side has closed
(or is in the process of closing) the connection -

Set some realistic expectations for users, after all how many people expect to see things instantly in this regard.

Added the ability to allow for multiple skyline nodes to use the skyline
graphite namespace sharded by hostname like carbon.relays.
