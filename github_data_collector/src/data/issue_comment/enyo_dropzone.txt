Question, is there any option for minimum upload file in dropzone parameters, currently I just found the maxFile.

Thanks,

https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/blob/4e20bd4c508179997b4b172eb66e927f9c0c8564/dist/dropzone.js#L978

I can't figure about what i should pass to this method to get everything work.
Now I have:
`let mock = {
                    name: item.original_name,
                    size: item.size,
                    dataUrl: item.relative_url,
                    type: item.mime_type
                };
                drop[0].dropzone.addFile(mock);`

and have folowing errors:
```

I want to give users the possibility to choose a different file after they already have chosen one.

In its default state only the space around the thumbnail is clickable and allows a new file selection.

I know how to make the thumbnail clickable but I don't know how to make that click open the file explorer again.

Is this even possible?
In init i will be setting following 

      var mockFile = { name: data.image_name, size: 12345 ,photoId:data.id};
                          // dzClosure.files.push( mockFile );
                            dzClosure.options.addedfile.call(dzClosure, mockFile);

                            dzClosure.options.thumbnail.call(dzClosure, mockFile, 'http://localhost/sss/public/storage/'+data.image_path+data.image_name);

it works fine .
The problem is when i upload multiple files to server and after success if i click remove file then i dont get name of the server file and photoid.

Is there an option to set image name and additional mockfile detail upon success of file
                       
Hi,
I have been trying to pause my overridden Dropzone.confirm in an attempt to eliminate the ugly native browser confirm dialog but nothing works the only way I can pause the execution for a cancel upload confirm is to stick a native browser confirm in Dropzone.confirm and that pretty much defeats the purpose of this.   I am sure the intention of Dropzone.confirm was to allow the use of things like bootbox.js or others or even bootsrap modals.
Maybe for the next version make the confirm event a promise like they do with fine uploader?  
Hello,

I am using Dropzone.js to upload files in my application, using chunked uploading, with a Node.js background.

Locally everything works fine, but in production uploads are extremely slow. If I upload chunks one by one, it is really slow, and if I use parallel uploading, it completely blocks for large files. Any idea of what could cause this difference between development and production? Thanks!
I setup Dropzone according to the docs and it keeps trying to make a GET request to the page it is setup on.

Not clue why this is happening as I'm using basically completely barebones.

```
  <div
      id="dropzone"
      class="dropzone"
    ></div>
```

```
      options: {
        url: `${this.$http.defaults.baseURL}/uploads`,
        withCredentials: true,
        maxFiles: 1,
      },
```
I see many topics/threads/details on ways to fix the exif issue, but nothing I've tried works?
Maybe I'm doing it wrong or missing something easy?

Can someone provide the steps to implement and where to change the code?

Thanks!!
I want to get the queue length after the user has finished adding files.

I'm able to do this with the undocumented **addedfiles**, but it only works correctly if the user adds files with the file picker.

If user drags / drops then **addedfiles** is called before **addedfile** and the returned queue length is zero.

Think this is same issue - but doesn't look like it was ever merged https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/issues/1235
