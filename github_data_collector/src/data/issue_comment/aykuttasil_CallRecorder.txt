I need to upload it

I want to save audio file in encrypted form that how it could be done that every body could not open audio file .only those person can listen file who has password to open file.

Actually, I intend to pass the audio stream to an external API in real-time. Is there a way I can possibly do that?
Thanks in advance.
Regards.
what the mean is it? the number in the end of recorder filename.
such as that: "1859617116" in "CallRecorderTestFile_outgoing_-1859617116".
And how to edit this path
First, thanks for what you have done.
And then, there has a bug  in `CallRecordReceiver.kt`. See the code below:
```
// Derived classes could override these to respond to specific events of interest
protected fun onRecordingStarted(context: Context, callRecord: CallRecord, audioFile: File?) {}

protected fun onRecordingFinished(context: Context, callRecord: CallRecord, audioFile: File?) {}
```
But, in `Kotlin`, they can not be overrided by subclass, you need to add `open` after `protected`. 
I have forked you project and fix it, you can check it [ShawnXiaFei/CallRecorder](https://github.com/ShawnXiaFei/CallRecorder)

Thanks again.
