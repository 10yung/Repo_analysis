where are the connect services (Identity Services)?

IdentityUrl/connect/authorize
IdentityUrl/connect/userinfo
IdentityUrl/connect/endsession

At my job we can only get docker using windows containers working but it seems this example uses Linux containers.. I am new to this and I have gotten the project work on my home machine. How hard is it to switch  ? Do I just change the sql MySQL etc.. all to grab a windows image instead of Linux or is it more complex than that?  
Any specific reason why AddEventBus instance is not resolved using the ServiceProvider ?

 return new EventBusServiceBus(serviceBusPersisterConnection, logger,
                        eventBusSubcriptionsManager, subscriptionClientName, iLifetimeScope);
First of all, thank you for this awesome project and colaboration.

I followed all steps from this tutorial and have all services running helthy:
https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/wiki/Deploy-to-Local-Kubernetes

But when I try to apply solution described in **Known issues** don't work on MacOS Catalina.

I'm running in kubernetes (docker desktop). But how http://10.0.75.1/webmvc should be work? I patched ConfigMaps and restart services according tutorial.

Someone have any idea?
Which the best strategy running e debug using Ubuntu with VsCode?
The ideia is learning with this project, make ajusts e etc..
Hi, after I do pull the latest version, i have this new problem below...
The ng serve not running...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16004192/71910065-f8871080-314f-11ea-9b1c-4bca620891a9.png)

  I would like make changes in WebSPA projeto running in background full projeto com docker-compose, for consuming the api endpoint.

Notes:
-- OS Ubuntu 18
-- IDE VS Code


In the RemoveBackStackAsync method the following expression is evaluated before every loop iteration `i < mainPage.Navigation.NavigationStack.Count - 1`, and the `NavigationStack.Count` will change, right?

This means that not all the previous items in the stack will be removed.
For example in a stack of fourth items only two items will be removed

```
        public Task RemoveBackStackAsync()
        {
            var mainPage = Application.Current.MainPage as CustomNavigationView;

            if (mainPage != null)
            {
                for (int i = 0; i < mainPage.Navigation.NavigationStack.Count - 1; i++)
                {
                    var page = mainPage.Navigation.NavigationStack[i];
                    mainPage.Navigation.RemovePage(page);
                }
            }

            return Task.FromResult(true);
        }
```

I changed the previous method to the following

```
        public Task RemoveBackStackAsync()
        {
            var mainPage = Application.Current.MainPage as CustomNavigationView;

            if (mainPage != null)
            {
		var navigationCount = mainPage.Navigation.NavigationStack.Count;
                for (int i = 0; i < navigationCount - 1; i++)
                {
                    var page = mainPage.Navigation.NavigationStack[0];
                    mainPage.Navigation.RemovePage(page);
                }
            }

            return Task.FromResult(true);
        }
```
Maybe I'm missing something but I had to change the implementation for the second approach.
Hi,

I moved WebSPA to app services while keeping every other service running on Azure Kubernetes services. The first time I tried to click on login it tried to navigate to localhost:5105 for authentication and of course failed because there is no identity service running on the app service plan nodes(at least this is my understanding). 

I changed IdentityUrl in "appsettings.json" to the AKS API server address, i.e. http://AKS API Server Address:5105, but now it times out when I click on login. The message I received is below. 

_"This site canâ€™t be reached AKS API Server Address took too long to respond."_

I am allowing all (ports, sources, protocols, destinations) inbound and outbound security rules for the NW security group in the AKS infrastructure Resource Group.   Outbound IP Addresses for the App Service itself is limited to 4 IPs though and I don't seem to be able to add other IP Addresses to this IP list. 
what could I be missing or doing wrong? TIA

*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.3.0 - September 24th, 2019
> Fixes:
> 
> - Security: Disallow calling "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" directly - 2078c72
> - Disallow calling "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" directly - 2078c72
> 
> Features:
> 
> - Add new runtime option `allowCallsToHelperMissing` to allow calling `blockHelperMissing` and `helperMissing`.
> 
> Breaking changes:
> 
> Compatibility notes:
> - Compiler revision increased - 06b7224
>   - This means that template compiled with versions prior to 4.3.0 will not work with runtimes >= 4.3.0
>     The increase was done because the "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" are now moved from the helpers
>     to the internal "container.hooks" object, so old templates will not be able to call them anymore. We suggest
>     that you always recompile your templates with the latest compiler in your build pipelines.
> 
> - Disallow calling "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" directly - 2078c72
>   - Calling "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" directly from a template (like in `{{blockHelperMissing}}` was 
>     never intended and was part of the exploits that have been revealed early in 2019 
>     (see https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). *It is also part of a new exploit that 
>     is not captured by the earlier fix.* In order to harden Handlebars against such exploits, calling thos helpers 
>     is now not possible anymore. *Overriding* those helpers is still possible.
>   - If you really need this behavior, you can set the runtime option `allowCallsToHelperMissing` to `true` and the
>     calls will again be possible
> 
> Both bullet points imly that Handlebars is not 100% percent compatible to 4.2.0, despite the minor version bump.
> 
> We consider it more important to resolve a major security issue than to maintain 100% compatibility.
