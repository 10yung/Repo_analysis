## Question

Is it possible to retrieve scan response data with this library? My device sends an extra scan response packet with some data that I would like to read while scanning.

I'm not sure, that is a bug in this library, but I would like to find any information or opinion, that can help!

## Prerequisites

I connect a peripheral device to a phone (ios/android) and then get a large amount of data from the device using notifications. (Stream this data by subscribing on one of the characteristics - device.monitorCharacteristicForService). As the device, I use an emulator on "bleno" library.

- [+] I am running the latest version
- [+] I checked the documentation and found no answer
- [+/-] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed

## Expected Behavior

I need no automatic and unexpected disconnects on IOS if the connection is good (signal and so on). As currently in android - everything is fine. 

## Current Behavior

Stably disconnections on IOS in 1-2 minutes after connection. Connection time until disconnect is random but as rule max is 2 minutes.
On android everything is okay and the connection is not interrupted and there are not any disconnects.	

By the way, I saw similar behavior with my Mi Band 4 and the official app on IOS. On Android, everything is okay too.

### Steps to Reproduce

There are two situations:

1) Just connect a peripheral device to the IOS device (bleManager.connectToDevice, bleManager.discoverAllServicesAndCharacteristicsForDevice) and wait. In 1-2 minutes device will be disconnected automatically (device.onDisconnected listener get device object and error = null) with next logs:

```
[RxBLEKit|DEBG|07:55:53.167]: CentralManager(10804420368) didDisconnect(from: Peripheral(uuid: A3F1E5A5-8D4B-C689-F87E-D706FB898478, name: Optional("my-mac")),
error: Optional(Error Domain=CBErrorDomain Code=6 "The connection has timed out unexpectedly." UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=The connection has timed out unexpectedly.}))
```

2) Connect to a device, subscribe to notifications and start streaming data from device to phone. Then in 1-2 will be a disconnect. For example, here I managed to get 712 notifications and then there is an unexpected disconnect (device.onDisconnected listener get device object and error = null):

```
[RxBLEKit|DEBG|08:07:37.102]: Peripheral(uuid: A3F1E5A5-8D4B-C689-F87E-D706FB898478, name: Optional(“my-mac")) didUpdateValueFor(for:Characteristic(uuid: 6CA841C2-CE94-443C-BF2E-5F0790402164, id: 10739225088),
value: Optional("fc8481fc7ff6fc7ec2fc7f37fc8004fc84c9"),
error: nil)
[RxBLEKit|DEBG|08:07:37.103]: Peripheral(uuid: A3F1E5A5-8D4B-C689-F87E-D706FB898478, name: Optional("my-mac")) didUpdateValueFor(for:Characteristic(uuid: 6CA841C2-CE94-443C-BF2E-5F0790402164, id: 10739225088),
value: Optional("fc88effc8e2dfc8b5efc83dbfc80f9fc7c93"),
error: nil)
[RxBLEKit|DEBG|08:07:37.825]: CentralManager(10752780240) didDisconnect(from: Peripheral(uuid: A3F1E5A5-8D4B-C689-F87E-D706FB898478, name: Optional("my-mac")),
error: Optional(Error Domain=CBErrorDomain Code=6 "The connection has timed out unexpectedly." UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=The connection has timed out unexpectedly.}))
Unhandled error happened: Connection error has occured: -
 subscription called from:
```

Sometimes I can get 2500 notifications without disconnects, but it's a really rare situation...

### Context

I tried finding something on the internet by this error code and message and found next:

1) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32588325/ios-bluetooth-le-code-6-the-connection-has-timed-out-unexpectedly
2) https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/f/nordic-q-a/9224/ios-8-disconnection-code-6-the-connection-has-timed-out-unexpectedly
3) https://github.com/innoveit/react-native-ble-manager/issues/555

Looks like it's some problem or feature of apple devices, but I believe that there is a solution because it's really strange. I'm not so good at the BLE topic and probably missed some important detail and as a result, have this situation with disconnects on IOS.

But I believe that there is someone who knows what to do or had this situation too! And wait for your help or opinion :)

## Question

So I am able to find find the devices I am looking for, I am able to list the services and characteristics, however, I do not see the battery service (0000180F-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb) in the list of services returned. Should I expect to see it in the list?

I've tried:
`this.manager.monitorCharacteristicForDevice(
                    device.id,
                    '0000180F-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb',
                    '00002a19-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb',
                    (err, characterisitic) => {
                      console.log('this.manager.monitorCharacterstic');
                      console.log(
                        'monitor char - ',
                        device,
                        characterisitic,
                        JSON.stringify(err),
                      );
                    },
                    'monitor_battery',
                  );`

but I get:
`Service 0000180F-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb for device ? not found`

Can anyone help me get a read on the battery level of my device?
Hi everyone, I'm using this library to monitoring Characateristcs from two different devices on Android. 
In particular I'm monitoring for 4 Characateristcs at devices (So I have 8 elements to monitoring). 

I have tried to print the data monitored and I don't have the same numbers of data for all Characateristcs. I have notice that sometimes I read the same Characateristc more time compared to the others. How can I fix this problem?

```
async notifications() {
    this.battery(this.device1, this.device2)
    this.devicesMonitoring(this.device1, this.device2)
  }

  devicesMonitoring(device1,device2) {
    
    const service = this.serviceGeneral();

    //TimeStamp 
    this.monitorTimeStamp = device2.monitorCharacteristicForService(service, this.TimeStamp, (error, characteristic) => {
      if (error) {
        this.error(error.message);
        return;
      }
      const buf = Buffer.from(characteristic.value, "base64");
      this.timeS = [0].map(index => buf.readInt16LE(index))
    })

    
    this.monitorRightAccelerazione = device1.monitorCharacteristicForService(service, this.Accelerometro, (error, characteristic) => {
      if (error) {
        this.error(error.message);
        return;
      }
      const buf = Buffer.from(characteristic.value, "base64");

      const [...acc_dx] = [0, 2, 4].map(index => buf.readInt16LE(index));
      this.arrayAccelerazioneDestro.push([this.timeS, ...acc_dx].join(":"))
    })

    
    this.monitorRightGiroscopio = device1.monitorCharacteristicForService(service, this.Giroscopio, (error, characteristic) => {
      if (error) {
        this.error(error.message);
        return;
      }
      const buf = Buffer.from(characteristic.value, "base64");
      const [...gyr_dx] = [0, 2, 4].map(index => buf.readInt16LE(index));
      this.arrayGiroscopioDestro.push([this.timeS, ...gyr_dx].join(":"))
    })

    
    this.monitorRightMagnetometro = device1.monitorCharacteristicForService(service, this.Magnetometro, (error, characteristic) => {
      if (error) {
        this.error(error.message);
        return;
      }
      const buf = Buffer.from(characteristic.value, "base64");
      const [...mg_dx] = [0, 2, 4].map(index => buf.readInt16LE(index));
      this.arrayMagnetometroDestro.push([this.timeS, ...mg_dx].join(":"))
    })

//......

Hi,

I'm getting BleError: Operation was rejected when i'm trying to fetch data using below script.
```
device.readCharacteristicForService('00001820-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb', '00002a80-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb')
              .then(finalData => {
                console.log('finalDAta', finalData.value)
                let buff = new Buffer(finalData.value, 'base64');
                console.log('buff', buff)
              }).catch(err => console.log('errondevice:', err))
```
Following is the characterstics json.
```
{
  value: null
  isNotifying: false
  isIndicatable: false
  isNotifiable: true
  isWritableWithoutResponse: true
  isWritableWithResponse: false
  isReadable: false

  uuid: "00002a80-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"
  id: 8
}

How can i resolve this?
Hello, my first post on github so i'm sorry if something is wrong with formatting/rules

I'm designing an app that connects via bluetooth to an heart rate sensor and with this library i successfully connect and read the values from it.

My issue here is that this one service is notify only (no permissions to read or write) and the only function from the library that i managed to use was monitorCharacteristicForService.

Everything was good until the program got complex. The issue here is that i can only get the values INSIDE the monitor function and take it outside of it with setState (which causes automatic render etc etc).

Any suggestions on how i can have full control on that "buf[1]" variable on the image? all the values i get are correct, i just want to not use setState or manage to get values from the characteristic outside the function so i have more room to work with.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59606460/71892799-c969a280-3141-11ea-83d5-dd0de922fd4a.png)

Once again sorry for the noob question since it's not really a library issue but more like i don't have the skills to completely understand the documentation of monitorCharacteristicForService.

Thanks in advance for all the help you can provide!

PS: i tried using redux to copy the state instead of changing it but without success

After device.connect() and even after discoverAllServicesAndCharacteristics(), readCharacteristicForService does not work. But getting charactaristics by digging in does?

The first does not work:

```
async readDoorCharacteristic() {
    this.openDoorCharacteristic = await this.device.readCharacteristicForService("947cd7c8-e2cb-11e9-81b4-2a2ae2dbcce4", "947cda5c-e2cb-11e9-81b4-2a2ae2dbcce4");
}
```

This one does:

```
  async readCharacteristics() {
    this.openDoorCharacteristic = null
    
    if (this.connected) {
      const services = await this.device.services()
      for (let i = 0; i < services.length; i++) {
        const service = services[i];
        this.log.push('Service uuid: ' + service.uuid)
        const characteristics = await service.characteristics()
        const openDoorCharacteristic = characteristics.find(c => c.uuid === "947cda5c-e2cb-11e9-81b4-2a2ae2dbcce4")
        if (openDoorCharacteristic) {
          this.openDoorCharacteristic = openDoorCharacteristic
        }
      }
    }
  }
```
But I would prefer not itterating through services and caharactaristics, when they are known to me...

Any ideas why this doesn't work?

ps. The serviceUuid and CharactaristicUuid are not the same, but close :-)


Thanks.. Regards, Thomas
Hey guys, first I would like to thank you for building such tool, which is great! :)

I have an error on IOS,

1.11, IOS13

While scanning I can access device name, but the result of the promise I don't.

```ts
const connectedDevice = await device.connect({ requestMTU: 80 })

// device.name === Good name
// connectedDevice.name === null
```

I also miss a lot of data, a seen on my screenshot.

Maybe you could help me ?

Thanks a lot

Hi,

Did you saw that and is it planned ?

error React Native CLI uses autolinking for native dependencies, but the following modules are linked manually:

Wondering where does the bug comes from,

I'm trying to write `0b00000001` to a device Uint8 characteristic (maxBytes == 1), and end up with `'49'` on the other side. Probably something stupid :).

Writing strings do work properly.

I'm using the [moddable](https://www.moddable.com/) framework with [this basic example](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/tree/public/examples/network/ble/wifi-connection-server), trying to set the `control` characteristic:

Thanks for the great lib!
