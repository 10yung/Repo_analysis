You are now able to set the path for NuGet restore of Cake dependencies explicitly.

Example batch call:
```
powershell -command ".\build.ps1 -CakeDir \"./tmpCakeArtifacts\"" 
pause
```
This would restore all Cake dependencies (like `Cake.exe`, ...) inti the `tmpCakeArtifacts` directory instead of the default `tools` folder. It is espacially useful if you execute the buildscript in your workspace where you already have a folder named `tools` and you don't want the script to delete the content every time it runs.
Due to `-target=$TARGET $DRYRUN "${SCRIPT_ARGUMENTS[@]}"`, the script seems to pass both "Default" and the actual target argument of the call which then returns the following error:
```
Multiple arguments with the same name (Target).
```

This happened while running in a docker container from ```pomma89/dotnet-mono:dotnet-3-mono-5-sdk``` which runs some version of Debian I believe and the simple call
```sh
RUN ./build.sh -Target=Clean
```
.
make sure nuget can be executed
fixes #44 
fixes #43
when build.sh is used under cygwin it tries to use mono which fails
e.g. 
```
./build.sh -c Debug
```
fails with an error
```
More than one build script specified.
For usage, use parameter --help
```

It looks like this build.ps1 file is getting out of sync with the latest version?
On a fresh clone, running `build.sh`, I get the following error. What should be my next steps to deubg or otherwise resolve?

``` bash
btomasini@btomasini-laptop02 ~/D/g/example> ./build.sh 
Could not load file or assembly or one of its dependencies.
System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly or one of its dependencies.

Could not restore NuGet packages.
```

Here is my config:

``` bash
btomasini@btomasini-laptop02 ~/D/g/example> lsb_release  -a
