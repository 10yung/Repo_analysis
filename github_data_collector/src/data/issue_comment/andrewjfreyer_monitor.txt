monitor detects my xiaomi mi band upon launch and seconds later starts and keeps reporting 0% confidence for it. What's up with that?

Hello,
Today I've trigger the scan but I only got 2 devices from 4 scanned

Later I restarted monitor and it scanned the 4 correctly.

What could be causing this? This happens to me from time to time but restarting monitor fixes the problem.
Hi,

I am using monitor.sh for home assistant. For this I created a docker container out of monitor.sh
The scripts runs fine for a while, then it just stops doing anything. No further logging, no updates within mqtt. If I check the .pids file and compare it with the running processes it looks that a few of the internal startet processes are no longer running. Any idea what I can do?

Lukas

The walkthrough should be updated to account for the "buster" version of rasbain. Sorry I didn't know where to put this.
Hi!  Great tool!  Just starting to use it.

It would be awesome if you could support HA MQTT Discovery, as outlined here:
https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/


Trying to get this set up with Cloud MQTT and keep getting the following error: "warning: mqtt broker refused connection - check username, password, and host address" 

I have started the whole process from scratch twice, have the correct username and password, and still cannot have any luck. Suggestions appreciated.
I have monitor.sh working on a raspberry pi zero w, and it is detecting my phone well.  I'm running it with -r -a.  Now I'd like to also have it recognize my electric bike, which has a VESC that speaks BLE, so this should work.  I got the MAC address and added it to `known_static_addresses` (just like my phone), but it does not seem to be picked up.

My `known_static_addresses` looks like this (obfuscating actual MAC addresses):

    11:11:11:11:11:11 phone
    22:22:22:22:22:22 ebike

When I look at the log that monitor.sh outputs, the ebike is consistenly failed to recognize with confidence 0.  However, what's weird is that when the ebike is off, then I see the following output:

    [CMD-NAME]  22:22:22:22:22:22 ebike  Unknown

But when I turn the ebike on (i.e. it's bluetooth module comes online), I see

    [CMD-NAME]  22:22:22:22:22:22 VESC BLE UART Unknown

Note that `VESC BLE UART` is the name of the BLE device in the electric bike (e.g. when I connect to the ebike with my phone), so somehow monitor.sh must have learned that name.  However, the confidence for ebike stays 0.

What am I doing wrong?
Hi there,

I installed the monitor service according to the manual.
If i do a manual search with hci tool I can see the TrackR.
But if I enter the device in known_devices no results are found.

Hi @andrewjfreyer and all the other skilled ppl here üëç 

First I must say this looks as the perfect solution for what I want to achieve, and from the readme I see you've done a he** of a job creating this nice script!

I got this up and running on my RPi 3b+ (currently 6 pcs of Zero W on the way by DHL) and got MQTT installed, configured and finally up and running... puuuh...

I'm currently in a steep learning curve regarding both MQTT and Monitor at the same time and also trying to understand the readme correctly. Still, I have some questions which are unclear to me.

1) 
I want to detect **any** MAC address passing a Monitor station to know if and whom was in that particular room. It should detect both mac's from'known_static_addresses' and unknown/guests. Can I do that, and what switch do I need to run Monitor with?

2)
Can I run the script with multiple switches? If yes, how spcifically do I update the script to boot up and run with these switches?

3)
For presence of the family arriving and departing, what switch is best for this? And, can this be combined with question 1 ?

In advance, thanks for taking the time to answer my questions :)


I haven't dug into it enough to see how much effort it would be, but I'm hoping that we can have `KNOWN DEVICE STATES` push out messages about the known beacons in addition to the known static addresses?

I've currently got home assistant pushing out a `KNOWN DEVICE STATES` when it starts up which makes it so that home assistant gets the current status of the known static addresses (i.e. our phones), but it doesn't report anything on our bluetooth trackers which are in the known beacon addresses (our cheap bluetooth trackers). I'm not sure if its just because we are using cheap trackers (or if its just normal for these type of devices), but I couldn't get them working in the known static addresses because they don't respond to the name query like our phones do.
