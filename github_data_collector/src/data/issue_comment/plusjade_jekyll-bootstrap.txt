is there anyone have the some problem ？
On my github repository for I am using github pages to generate static website and to change the default site configuration I have changed _config.yml file.

before:

author :
name : Name Lastname
email : blah@email.test
github : username
after:

author : Saurabh Kukade
name : Saurabh Kukade
email : saurabhkukade@gmail.com
github : saurabhkukade
But still changes have not reflected on generated website. I have pushed this changes to github repository.

for tag and category link, can not find the target

http://rawbin-.github.io/tags.html#IA32-ref

http://rawbin-.github.io/categories.html#HTTP-ref
When I try to use markdown nested list, it doesn't work.
E.g. 
```
* A
  *a
  *b
```
it shows (it is bullet points, use star to express here)
```
* A
* a
* b
```
However, when I check the source code, it looks like normal.
```
<ul>
<li>A
    <ul>
        <li>a</li>
        <li>b</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
```

Does anyone know how to fix this?
Trying to use "Minimal" theme from the GitHub theme selector, but no luck.

Also attempted the fix in #308, but no luck either.
the request path is  http://localhost:4000/assets/themes/bootstrap-3/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css
,but the real path is assets/themes/bootstrap/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css.
please change

somehow we are on github, we GET(get the GIT) and there is absolutely ZERO .git files left behind to pull upates with. This is normal syntax. mebbe soneone should flag down linus on this? 

you cant pull updates if theres no control files left behind. see subversion for examples.
