Running this code the process gets interrupted.

```
import openml as oml
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sklearn

# Download Streetview data. Takes a while the first time.
SVHN = oml.datasets.get_dataset(41081)
X, y, cats, attrs = SVHN.get_data(dataset_format='array',
    target=SVHN.default_target_attribute)
```

`Process finished with exit code 137 (interrupted by signal 9: SIGKILL)`
I have 12gig of memory free, can't figure out why I am getting this interrupt.
