I'd like to filter a column by review requests to users only (not teams). For example, I'd like to show PRs that requested review from @diegohaz, with the option to exclude teams of which I'm member.

The problem is that I'm part of a team on https://github.com/Automattic whose review is **always** requested because it's the owner of the codebase. The repository has plenty of new PRs every day. It's impossible to keep track, so I ended up turning off the notifications on GitHub. But that also means that I won't be notified when someone requests my review (not my team).
It seems like I can't filter with multiple users/orgs. Unsure if this is a feature request or a bug.

Currently, it's possible to zoom in by pressing <kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>+</kbd></kbd>. But we have to press <kbd>Shift</kbd> in order to produce the <kbd>+</kbd> character. It took me some time to figure that out. Most apps allow us to use <kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>=</kbd></kbd> instead.

My menubar is full. Even with "menubar mode" turned off it still appears up there. It should not force an icon up there.
It would be wonderful to list and manage Stars and Watches. E.g. look at all Starred repositories, swipe left or right to unsubscribe, etc. From what I can tell, most other apps that have similar funcitonality either don't do it well or don't do this at all.

Love the app, thanks!
Hey guys,
I'm really amazed at the brilliant product you're working on, however, there's a bug bothering me every time I start my OS up; It resets to "Sign in with Github" mode and I should sign-in every time.

Not sure why it's like that. Feel free to ask for any information you to debug this.
Thank you

```bash
OS: Windows 10, macOS Mojave (Same problem)
DevHub version: 0.93.0
```
Some users have both their open github accounts and also work to a company that uses Github enterprise. it would be great to aggregate both accounts into DevHub and better manage the flows from the different repos.
It won't start when I open it normally but I'm getting this when I try to run devhub from the terminal:
```
A JavaScript error occurred in the main process

The primary goal is to increase user productivity, so it can do everything inside the app instead of opening a new browser tab. Open an issue, close, add/remove labels, assign, read comments, leave a comment, etc.

The secondary goal is Growth Hacking. GitHub will show the app name on each comment, which will probably make more users discover the app:
