Automate and simplify the release process as much as possible.

Release distros and source:

* `release` @ Ubuntu
   * [ ] create release directory (script parameter overrides variable)
   * [ ] initiate https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dvorka/mindforger/build/artifacts build from `master`
   * [ ] run all `distro-*.*` scripts
   * [ ] download Appveyor Win installer artifact
   * [ ] list all distributions and status
   * [ ] update Debian PPA (build PPA and upload new version)
* tarball @ Ubuntu
   * [ ] `distro-tarball.sh` ... clean tarball build (machine w/ all prerequisites installed)
      * [ ] arg: release directory
      * [ ] clean clone (`master`)
      * [ ] build directory
      * [ ] dependencies build
      * [ ] tarball archive directory > release directory
* .deb @ Ubuntu (maintain revision sequence)
   * [ ] `distro-deb.sh` ... clean `.deb` build (machine w/ all prerequisites installed)
      * [ ] arg: release directory
      * [ ] clean clone (`master`)
      * [ ] build directory
      * [ ] dependencies build
      * [ ] tarball archive directory > release directory
* .rpm @ Fedora (maintain revision sequence)
   * [ ] `distro-rpm.sh` ... clean `.rpm` build (machine w/ all prerequisites installed)
      * [ ] Fedora VM up and running as prerequisite
      * [ ] OPTIONAL: build on Fedora to ensure `ldd` and ability to build
      * [ ] `scp distro-rpm.sh`
      * [ ] `scp deb.sh`
      * [ ] `ssh` to VM and run `distro-rpm.sh`
         * [ ] alien
      * [ ] download rpm > release directory
* .installer @ Windows
      * AppVeyor > release directory

Awesome piece of software 
Would be awesomer if it had RTL support in notes (even maybe in node titles...) 
Could be maybe a simple attribute of the note - that simply wrap the whole note into a `<div dir="rtl">` ?
