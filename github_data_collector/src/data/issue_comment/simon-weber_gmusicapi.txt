Hi with this PR I want to propose a replacement for the deprecated validictory module.
fastjsonschema module seems to be faster than jsonschema module too.
Thanks for this amazing project
I've been using this function to remove playlist entries successfully, but I notice that according to the documentation, the function remove_entries_from_playlist():

> Returns a list of entry ids that were removed.

However, it seems that the function will basically return whatever is specified as the input parameter. As a simple example:

```python
api.remove_entries_from_playlist(u'hello')
```

Will return `[u'hello]'`, where I would expect it to return `None` since no playlist entry ID exists with this value. Is my understanding correct here?

I'm using version 12.0.0, but from the changelog I believe this also applies for the latest version.

Cheers!
This might be an incredibly stupid issue, but it looks like users that don't subscribe to google play music aren't able to search for songs based on video_hits or extract a youtube video.

Is there any possible workaround for this, or do you absolutely have to sub to GPM?
I currently have a GPM subscription alongside thousands of tracks that I've uploaded and I want to use gmusicapi to tell me what tracks I've uploaded vs what have been added from the subscription.

I've pulled out a diff of the keys in a track that I uploaded vs a track that I added via subscription. 

**Fields in added_track not in uploaded_track**
trackType
explicitType

trackType has a numeric value of either 4 or 8.
explicitType has a numeric value of either 1, 2, or 3.

Whenever there is trackType, there will be explicitType. However I have come across some tracks that have only explicitType from this pair. For these that only have explicitType, they look to be songs that I purchased from iTunes Music back in the day.

1. Do you know the significance of these fields (trackType and explicitType)? 
2. Can these be used to accurately determine a track added from a subscription? From my investigation it seems so.
3. I am thinking of adding a PR to include a function to report on tracks added from a subscription - thoughts? 

I myself am migrating away from GPM so I want to know what tracks to add to my new streaming platform. Others might find this beneficial too - it could be used in a migrating tool from one platform to another.
Hi, I just installed a docker container which is basically a wrapper for your api. (jaymoulin/google-music-manager) The issue I had was a lot of duplicate tracks getting uploaded which google music seemed to miss. From what I gather, this seems a common problem. 

I was just wondering if it would be an idea to add an option to tag the mp3 files on successful upload or keep a list, so they're skipped on future upload calls? I'd love to get this working, but as it stands, it's unusable for me. Let me know your thoughts. Thanks!
As you may have heard google has released a new service called youtube music which has lots of similarity with play music. There are news that google eventually plans to replace play music with youtube music.

The good thing about youtube music right now is less authorization headache and new information like destinction between singles and albums.

would be really good this library supported it.

Just as a recommendation and knowing everyone's opinion.

I can' t seem to get Webclient.login() to work. I have a account with 2fa auth. I tried with an app password or my regular password.
Mobile client and Music manager work without issue.

I am using the webclient because it has report_incorrect_match and the other clietns don't have that.

Is there a workaround in the meantime?

Thanks.
Currently the Web Client only supports uploading album art. It would be nice if we could also change the song's metadata. I see that's already documented in the protocol section, so it makes me wonder why it's not implemented in the library.
Been using everything fine until a few hours ago, when any call to `get_stream_url` returns 403 with `'X-Rejected-Reason': 'DEVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED'` when using `Mobileclient.FROM_MAC_ADDRESS`

I'm able to do everything but `get_stream_url`.  Using an actual Android ID seems to work, so Google may have changed something to stop us using MAC addresses?  Makes no difference if 2FA is enabled or not.

This is probably a dupe of #584, sorry.
I'm just curious and because there hasn't been an issue about it yet I though I'd create one :)

Basically, google also keeps taps on every played track over at [https://myactivity.google.com](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity?product=16).
This does not apply to gmusicapi however (I'm thinking of `Mobileclient.increment_song_playcount`)

The only reason I'm curious is (well partially because of OCD :D) because I'm not sure how this could affect machine learning related stuff (radio stations, IFL, etc.).

Does anyone know more about it?
