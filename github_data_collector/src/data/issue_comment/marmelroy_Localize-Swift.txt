Hi,

I use this librairy to manage language in my app, but unfortunately, it works half as required.
i create few files (Localizable.strings) in multiple languages, but when i test it on french for example, it loads the danish translation.
How can i fix it, what do you need to help me ?
Thanks

Hello Team
I faced a very wiered issue. While generating localize string if my string has % then it will automatic adding space before the %.

ex:- 

CSV file text
"max_amount","The maximum amount is Rp%@","Jumlah maksimum nominal adalah Rp%@"

Localizable string  
"max_amount" = "The maximum amount is Rp %@";

See the space after Rp, There is no space in content csv file.

Thanks.




 
Since pluralization use String class function `localizedStringWithFormat` which 

> Returns a string created by using a given format string as a template into which the remaining argument values are substituted according to the user’s default locale.

..so it takes **user’s default locale**. For example if you have the device with English, but in app choose Russian, it will take the plural type for English, but plural string for Russian. We know, that for English used only `one` and `other` types. For Russian used all (one, two, few, many..). But the app, in that case, will return only `one` and `other` for Russian.  

It goest to a correct `.stringsdict` file, but ignores plural categories, which are not used in device's current language.

The problem is because when changing language in app, we substitute bundle and then use this bundle to take localized string. But in order to use pluralization we need to use only one available function for this: `localizedStringWithFormat`. And it uses the device localization.

It seems that it's a bug because `String.localizedStringWithFormat` always use categories for current device language even if `UserDefaults.standard` added a recent key for `AppleLanguages`.

Workaround:
Is to use custom implementation of pluralization.
I have a Swift app which have more than 7000 lines of translations (from .xliff files).

Every translations is generated through the Storyboard (half of it) or through `NSLocalizedString` with comments associated to it.

Is it possible to make this lib work as the code is, at the moment?
Hey, 
Hate to really be picky but on line 98 of Localise.swift it's
`        if let indexOfBase = availableLanguages.index(of: "Base") , excludeBase == true {
`
But on master it is 
`        if let indexOfBase = availableLanguages.firstIndex(of: "Base") , excludeBase == true {
`
index has been depreciated and has been replaced by firstIndex. 

It's not really an issue as such but just wanted to mention just in case if there were any other discrepancies between the versions

This library is pretty awesome though and has saved me a massive amount of work getting the Welsh Langauge supported in one of my apps (customer requirement) 

Thanks

This question has already been asked  #52 and #97 , but I still could not use this library in Objective-C. Are there any solutions?

Hi Roy, 
I got an issue when I call setCurrentLanguage in my current project and a blank project. 
### It occurs when I use **File.plist** and **Localizable.strings** under Base localization.
_Ex_: I use "HR" for Croatian localization and "Base" for others. When I set current language to "EN", I think my current language should be "EN" but It is my default language instead (my default language is "HR", I don't know why my default language is "HR" because I tried remove my app then reinstall it. I only call setCurrentLanguage one time when I press a button). Do you have any ideas to resolve this issue?
### Everything still be okay if I use them under specified language. 
_Ex_: "EN" for English and "HR" for Croatian. 
Thank u very much
Hi i am using this library and i noticed that the system buttons don't get translated to the user's preference localization. it is using the phone's language that the user has in settings.

This is happening in  
navigation items -> back, cancel
keyboard buttons -> search, Go
Social share popup -> share, cancel
e.t.c.

Could something be done for these issues?
