The tutorials here are great.  Would love to see a tutorial using a cartesian topology in MPI.
I wouldn't mind writing up a tutorial once I figure it out.

If it hasn't been done already, I'd like to add some tutorials for derived datatypes.
This would also be part of Hacktoberfest.
Hi, 
Thanks for these tutorials. ðŸ¥‡ 
I can't seem to find tutorials for non-blocking message passing (`MPI_Isend` and `MPI_Irecv`). It would be great if you could add those too, please. :)
Would be nice to cover these as well to, e.g., allow gathering arrays of different sizes from different processes into a contiguous array at the root.
