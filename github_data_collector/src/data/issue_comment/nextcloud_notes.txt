Currently `HTTP Status code 500` is returned. It would be much better if the clients could display an appropriate error message **why** the sync failed :)
I have Nextcloud 17.0.2 running on a Slackware64-current server on my home network. I have two tablets and two phones (all Android) with the latest Notes installed from the F-Droid repository. Only one of each still have an active data plan with Verizon. All are configured to upload only via WiFi and only when connected to my WAP, both bands of which are configured with SSID broadcast turned off. There is a m0n0wall fork running on a dual-port computer between my networks and Roadrunner. Updates and new notes are made on whichever device is easiest to reach. Occasionally edits and new notes are entered while out of WiFi range.
After editing or creating a note, some will sit and spin attempting to upload, but even two days later will not have uploaded.
Phones: Pixel 3a, Samsung S6
Tablets: ASUS Zenpad Z8, Samsung Galaxy Tab E
WAP: Netgear R6020 Dual-band, uses firewall for DNS. FIrewall is configured to accept just the machine name for internal lookup only.
Steps to secure WAP: 
   1. Turn off SSID broadcast.
   2. Change SSID to be at least 24 characters.
   3. Add password of at least 36 characters.

### Steps to reproduce
1. Add external storage via SFTP. 
2. Go to "notes" and define an non existing folder within the SFTP location. I added SFTP_pi3/Sync/notes/. The "Sync" folder was not there.
3. Refresh "notes" and see it crashing. The "settings" cogwheel disappears so the only solution is to create the folder path above in the SFTP folder and then correct the path.

### Expected behaviour
An error message should be shown after validating the SFTP folder path.

### Actual behaviour
Notes app crashes and there is no clue is given as to what happened.

Sorry, but this feature is really wanted ...

Meaning of a PIM is to work under one hood.
Well, it's strange to tell users to use this feature here and the other feature there.
An then ... they tell u're silly to "set up a system" such this "experimental Cloud" and last: Hey dude, Google and M$ can do this and u won't. Aehm, why u're using Linux?

Sorry, again. But welcome to my life ...
Fixes  #417, see discussion under https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloud-vue/issues/705, especially https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloud-vue/issues/705#issuecomment-549194181. Thanks to @paulschwoerer for help on implementing this. For now, I'm using the (old) `OC.Notification` API, since I want to be compatible to Nextcloud 15/16. We will switch to the new `OCP.Toast` API later.

@jancborchardt Is this how you imagined?

Hi all, 
The hyper links don't show on my browser when in preview mode
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58459583/71715284-395ded00-2e11-11ea-9941-11ee325f719c.png)

The hyperlinks are not clickable when in editing mode.

Some times I just need to have a view of the contents of the note without some of the details.

Using some advanced editors (e.g. VIM) is it possible to fold some text sections like chapters and sections which is great to solve the "problem" above.

As a solution it would be possible to enable folding of any header sections or at least support the tags `<details>` and `<summary>` as Github already does for example (as well as Gitlab and other public repositories as far as I know) like below

<details>

<summary> Title of the folded section </summary>

hidden content

</details>


I use notes daily and love it. ❤️

I tried many options for a front end on mobile phone, but I find that the web version is just right (a part of some small things, that I will try to fix later).

## Motivation

The thing is that when you tap «Add to Home screen» in `chrome` it always saves the `Nextcloud` default app (i.e. `files`) which is in the way when you're trying to quickly add some note.

## Solution

I've looked through the code that is responsible of adding the manifest file and found that there is a default app -- `theming` that looks if the `apps/<app>/img/manifest.json` file is available and adds it otherwise it generates its own `manifest` in the [ThemingDefaults.php](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/2442d78696313744bae8170c1b547f3b50ca8fcd/apps/theming/lib/ThemingDefaults.php#L347-L355) file:
```php
if ($image === 'manifest.json') {
	try {
		$appPath = $this->appManager->getAppPath($app);
		if (file_exists($appPath . '/img/manifest.json')) {
			return false;
		}
	} catch (AppPathNotFoundException $e) {}
	$route = $this->urlGenerator->linkToRoute('theming.Theming.getManifest');
}
```

but then the main [`.htaccess`](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/2442d78696313744bae8170c1b547f3b50ca8fcd/lib/private/Setup.php#L525) file is redirecting all the files to `/`.

So I decided to make a [pull request](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/18584) there where I would allow apps to have their proper `manifest` files.

## Result

With changes to server and the `manifest.json` within this PR I get:

And I'm able to save `Notes` app to desktop and access it quickly.

P.S. I also created a [`sandbox`](https://github.com/gko/nextcloud-sandbox) to be able to quickly debug apps.
Follow up of #398.
The design has to be fixed, see: https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloud-vue/issues/705
