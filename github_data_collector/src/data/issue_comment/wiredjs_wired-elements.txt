Has anyone been able to get this working with Create-React-App and TypeScript? Seem to be just getting these errors 

> Property 'wired-button' does not exist on type 'JSX.IntrinsicElements'.

> JSX element type 'WiredButton' is not a constructor function for JSX elements.
>   Type 'WiredButton' is missing the following properties from type 'ElementClass': context, setState, forceUpdate, props, and 2 more.ts(2605)
how can I use it? `<script src="https://unpkg.com/wired-elements@latest/dist/wired-elements.bundled.js"></script>` give 404 error ? and in package are typescripts files 
## current behavior
the value is lost if it set between generating `shadowRoot` and appending `input` element.

## expected behavior
the value should be set to `pendingValue` in case of `shadowRoot exist & input doesn't exist`.

```
import React from 'react';
import "wired-elements";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <wired-dialog open>
        <wired-input></wired-input>
      </wired-dialog>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Since the 2.0.0 alphas, there's no longer a `wired-elements.bundled.js` file in the releases, meaning the https://unpkg.com/wired-elements@latest/dist/wired-elements.bundled.js link in the Readme is dead.

The raw JS build is perfect to hack together some HTML into fun-looking wireframes, it would be great not to drop the support.

Thanks for the great lib!
The Wordpress page/post editor strips unfamiliar elements such as `<wired-button>`. This is probably the situation in other places as well. It would be nice to be able to simply class an element. Moreover, it would be swell if this could implement creating rough borders.

For example:

```
<button class='wired-button', data-wired="{elevation: 3; stroke=2; fill='#ABC'}"></button>
```
I've tried to use wired, but the box is off (like a -10px margin), and it doesn't scale to a large content.

I've tried to add a long text to the demo page and end up with the same problem

Is there a way to solve that ? 
Hi Team,

I have seen the Angular example on your official website which is very simple and I thought to create a bit more feature rich example. Hence created an Angular 8 application using WiredJs component and published blog on the same.

Please include in your example list if you find it interesting.

Would like to help, 

Threw these components together pretty quickly, hoping a good starting point for comments and feedback.

Dialog and Toasts
[demo](https://bvkimball.github.io/wired-elements/examples/pop-ups.html)
Add dialogs to body and use openDialog(NAME) to open it.

Tables
[demo](https://bvkimball.github.io/wired-elements/examples/tables.html)
Using css grid to make table layout instead of tables
