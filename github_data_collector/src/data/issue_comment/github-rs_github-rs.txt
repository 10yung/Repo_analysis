hi, what is the status of this repository? I see the build is failing and several PRs are unmerged w/o any comments.

If there's anything specific I could help with to breathe some life into this, please let me know.

A Github app requires a custom media type for requests.
However `new_custom(..media: MediaType..)` was removed in this commit: 
`https://github.com/github-rs/github-rs/commit/c915e4615dbfadba753bd2fea86ba4b2d51db05c`.

Do you plan to get it back?

This restores the de-pagination logic from an old branch: https://github.com/mgattozzi/github-rs/tree/pagination

I'm not sure this is actually the best approach; as I worked on this, I realized that a much simpler way would be a variant of the `execute` method that simply includes an optional "next page" `Request` object in its output.

In order to have a nicer development experience, I moved most of the `Executor` logic into the trait definition itself, leaving only a few methods to be implemented in the `exec!` macro itself. I realize this refactoring isn't strictly related to these changes, but personally I think it's an improvement.
I was recently trying to update some code which uses your `github-gql-rs` crate, contained within this repo, but it looks like due to some dependencies being yanked it can no longer be used.
```
error: failed to select a version for the requirement `untrusted = "^0.5.1"`
  candidate versions found which didn't match: 0.7.0, 0.6.2
  location searched: crates.io index
required by package `rustls v0.11.0`
    ... which is depended on by `hyper-rustls v0.11.0`
    ... which is depended on by `github-gql-rs v0.0.1`
```

it looks like you have updated the dependencies though [here](https://github.com/github-rs/github-rs/blob/master/github-gql-rs/Cargo.toml#L29) but no new release has been published.

Would you be willing to publish a new release üôè 
in https://github.com/github-rs/github-rs/issues/163 the dependency issues were fixed for github-rs but not github-gql-rs which requires a release by someone with privs at some point.
several problems are corrected in the example code, including:
- a reference to `github_gql::mutation::Mutation`
- the `serde_json` dependency is added to `Cargo.toml`
- change the dependency on `github-gql-rs` to the github repo rather than the 0.0.1 crate which no longer works
This PR adds a `set_hostname()` method to the Github client that should enable it to be used for GitHub Enterprise as well as public GitHub. The library defaults to public GitHub, so usage remains exactly the same for existing users.

Basically just made the base url for the graphql queries configurable so that the user can target GHE installations.
