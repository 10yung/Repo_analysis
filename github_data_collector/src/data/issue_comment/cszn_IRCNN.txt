hello,
Is there a pytorch or tensor flow version of the same available? If so could you please lead me to it.
can the 'Isigma '= 0/255 in the 'Demo_deblur_real_application'?
Hello, in paper,it said if the size of the training patch is smaller than the receptive
field, the performance would decrease. why? thanks
这个demo跑不通，您知道为什么吗？

Hi,
Which OS is required to install and use your works?
Ubuntu or windows? And their version?
Could you please share more information about how to install and use?

Thank you
Dear Author:
                   Could you please provide some great blind deblur methods to estimating the blur kernel?
                   Thank you very much!
Hi, sorry for interrupting. Could you please kindly provide the training code as well? Thank you~
