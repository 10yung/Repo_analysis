It's not possible to build anymore with the latest update of Xcode.

Trying to run unix executable, however always come upon the same issue: "Operation not permitted" What I can do about that?)
“Enter user name?”, with a question mark, is a question to which the answer is either “yes” or “no,” not a username. Accordingly, I removed the question mark. (Another possibility would be to simply ask: “What’s your username?”)

Also, the Oxford Dictionary of English gives the compound word “username” to refer to "an identification used by a person with access to a computer, network, or online service,” which I suppose it’s the meaning intended here. I rewrote it like that.
If I do a run operation with a directory name with space, operation fails.
For example:
`run("open '/Users/myname/path with space'")`
or even
`run("open \"/Users/myname/path with space\"")`

Issue is with the splitCommandToArgs method implemented in RunResults.swift which uses `components(separatedBy:)` API
If I try to do the following command:

``` swift
let gitCommand = "git ls-remote --tags \(gitURL) | awk '{print $2}' | grep -v '{}' | awk -F'/' '{print $3}' | sort -n -t. -k1,1 -k2,2 -k3,3 | tail -n 1"
        let latestVersion = run(gitCommand).stdout
```

but it fails. it doesn't give any output and I don't know why. If I execute that command in my terminal it works perfectly fine. I'm not sure if it has to do with the pipelines or with the `'` 
Run a command that outputs big amounts of data in a console, observe `waitUntilExit` never exiting.

This fixes some syntax errors in the Examples files, and also fixes the cocoapods `Podfile` to work with modern cocoapods.
This fixes the following warning:

`RunResults.swift:39:82: Conditional downcast from 'NSString?' to 'String' is a bridging conversion; did you mean to use 'as'?`
