I have a bug, that menu doesn't response to touches.
__typeof (self) __weak weakSelf = self;
    REMenuItem *size350 = [[REMenuItem alloc]initWithTitle:@"Max Size 350" image:nil highlightedImage:nil action:^(REMenuItem *item){
        size = 350;
        [self savingValues]; // calling method
    }];

every thing going right way.. menu open and on click it closes but the action method is not called... plz help on this...
why don't update the menu, there are some function to consummate!
Closes #86 




It would be great if there is a way to adjust the height of certain rows in the dropdown menu. Possibly if the row adjust to the height of REMenuItem

Sometimes it is necessary to have a force close mechanism. I need this in this scenery: tap menu button and quickly press a button to push another view controller. without this mechanism the menu appears on another screen as well.

This File change fixes cases where orientation changes and status bar appears/dissapers and the REMENU's y position is not calculated right. Especially on iphone6plus where the landscape navbar height is 44 instead of 32 unlike other iphones. Also most probably by mistake you have written "UIDeviceOrientationIsPortrait" instead of "UIInterfaceOrientationIsPortrait".
