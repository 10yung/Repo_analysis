CocoaPods currently installs the Swift 3.0.1 version of SwiftOCR.

If accepted, this PR needs a corresponding `1.2` tag pushed (was stuck between that and `1.1.1`).
I'm not getting any output string. My code is below

```
    @IBAction func takePhoto(_ sender: Any) {
        
        imagePicker =  UIImagePickerController()
        imagePicker.delegate = self
        imagePicker.sourceType = .camera
        
        present(imagePicker, animated: true, completion: nil)
        
        
    }
    
    
    func imagePickerController(_ picker: UIImagePickerController, didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo info: [UIImagePickerController.InfoKey : Any]) {
        imagePicker.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
        imageView.image = info[.originalImage] as? UIImage
        myImage = (info[.originalImage] as? UIImage)!
        
  
    }
    
    
    @IBAction func btnTapped(_ sender: Any) {
        print("Btn tapped")
        
        swiftOCRInstance.recognize(myImage) { recognizedString in
           // print(self.myImage)
            print(recognizedString)
         //   self.outputLbl.text = recognizedString
        }
    
    }
    
```
Hello,

If I use SwiftOCR, can it detect any language text or can it detect just english language text ?

Thanks
This Error: SWIFT_VERSION '3.0.1' is unsupported, supported versions are: 4.0, 4.2, 5.0.
I used SwiftUI and Swift 5.1
We get crashes in the FFNN functions from memory errors from this dispatching on a concurrent queue.

There is a simple fix here:

https://github.com/langford/SwiftOCR/commit/890eeae498f7dea177efbf1ca5c890ffd46393cc

That repo however is on a fork that already has swift 5 included. 
Hi.
I've updated the recognizableCharacters variable to my new training data, e.g.:

recognizableCharacters = "ABCD123Ëœ)(-"

But print(recognizableCharacters.count) is always the original 36 characters. So, after change recognizableCharacters, what is the next step to SwiftOCR working?
Hello, I was wondering if anybody has done a Wrapper for SwiftOCR to be able to use it in another language (e.g., Python). Or if there is a way to access with a thing such as a REST API.
AS I am trying to make a server side SwiftOCR 
when I convert the image data into image it returns the Exact image but When I'm trying to parse the Image in SwiftOCRInstace.recognize method it does not Convert the Image and Return null string
my code is as below:

let newImage = NSImage(data: user.image)

         let newImage1 = OCRImage(newImage)
            let swiftOCRInstance = SwiftOCR()
            
            swiftOCRInstance.recognize((newImage)!){ recogniseString in        
            print(recogniseString)
                
            }
Can you help me to install Swift OCR through Swift Package Manager.

When installing SwiftOCR through CocoaPods, it depends on the CocoaPods version of GPUImage (instead of the repository version). For macOS, this does not compile since there are several files missing in GPUImage that SwiftOCR relies upon. These files are explicitly excluded from the OSX pod.

Step to reproduce:
1. create a new Xcode project with macOS CLI target.
1. Install `pod 'SwiftOCR'.
1. Try to build.

I have tried to work around this by manually building the frameworks directly from the repository (not through), but got some obscure errors at runtime when importing them ðŸ˜• so I had to resort to posting an issue here. I suspect this might be fixed by pinning to a specific revision of the GPUImage pod dependency, but I haven't figured out which exactly.
