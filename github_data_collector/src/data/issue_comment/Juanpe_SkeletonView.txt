### What did you do?

I am using compositional layout collection view (might be related). I have made the whole view hierarchy `isSkeletonable = true`. I use `collectionView.showAnimatedSkeleton()` to make skeleton view appear and indeed that works correctly.
Then after a while I call `collectionView.hideSkeleton()` on the main thread to make skeleton view disappear.

### What did you expect to happen?

Skeleton view should disappear and my normal cells should appear.

### What happened instead?

Skeleton view partially disappears, some labels are still masked. The whole screen is scrollable (it is bounding) when it should not be.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior

described above

### SkeletonView Environment

**SkeletonView version: 1.8.2
**Xcode version:** 11.3.1
**Swift version:** 5.1

I am unable to use any of SkeletonTableViewDelegate methods. Getting error as `Use of undeclared type 'ReusableHeaderFooterIdentifier'`

Also, if SkeletonTableViewDataSource is used with UITableViewDelegate, getting crash for header and footer methods.

The delegate methods in the current pod are defined as:
`public protocol SkeletonTableViewDelegate: UITableViewDelegate { }`

Probably a pod mismatch issue. 

**SkeletonView version: 1.8.2 (through pods)**
**Xcode version: 11.2.1**
**Swift 5**

- Fixes for Issue #202 UIView.layoutSubviews swizzle is messing with standard controls
- Due to Swizzling, LayoutSubviews is not called. This fixes the issue.
Fix #232 
Showing animation hides UIView's border.
### What did you do?

I have a View with Border.

### What did you expect to happen?

The Border always not be rendered when startGradientAnimation.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior

Create a UIView, and set borderColor, borderWith, borderOpacity, then use SkeletonView's showGradientAnimation show it.
The view's border is not hidden or render.

### SkeletonView Environment

**SkeletonView version: 1.8.2**
**Xcode version: 11.3**
**Swift version: 5**

### What did you do?

Upgraded SkeletonView sdk from 1.7 to 1.8.2

### What did you expect to happen?

Current skeleton view set up to work same way as earlier, for all the versions of iOS.

### What happened instead?

Default text behind skeleton views (labels, image views etc.) started showing up for iOS 12 devices. Works fine for iOS 13 devices.

### What did you do?
I want to set corner for **image view**'s skeleton, but there is no option in xib 
### What did you expect to happen?

### What happened instead?
### Steps to reproduce the behavior

### SkeletonView Environment

**SkeletonView version: 1.8.2

I have cases where I need to hide a couple non skeletonable views, and I didn't found a way to do it.
So I workaround it posting notifications inside the `SkeletonFlowHandler`.

Is there a better way to do it?
hi @lczalh, headers are supported from version 1.7

Please, could you update `SkeletonView` on your project?

Thanks
