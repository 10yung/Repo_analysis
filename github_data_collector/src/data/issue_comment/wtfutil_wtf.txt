Fixes #809 

This change allows you to specify a kubernetes context, so if you have more than one context, you can choose which one to display. It uses the default context if none specified in the config. I've tried this locally and appears to work as expected

I also found that there are missing vendored modules, so I've ran `go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor`

- Use progressive build to reduce final image size
- Download source during build so only Dockerfile is required to be present on the build host
- Add a `version` arg so any tag or branch can be built: `docker build --build-arg=version=v0.25.0 -t wtf .`
## What's broken?
As of 2020-01-12, building via Dockerfile is broken on master branch with the following error:

Building the latest release v0.25.0 works correctly.

Thanks!

I went ahead and removed the vendor directory (#792) and changed the Makefile
## What's broken?
I get random capital letters seemingly randomly strewn across the page. For a while it was capital "A", now they're capital "P". Is this supposed to be here or...
Edit: here's a screen shot, it's just a corner since I have a lot of personal info.

## What should it do?

I want to use `wtf` with the CircleCI module, which works fine out of the box. However, my team work in a monorepo meaning that there can be a lot of builds going on. I'd like to be able to filter the builds displayed by the CircleCI module by username, so I can just view my own builds. 
## What's broken?

I'm using `kubectl` with multiple contexts for different clusters. When trying out `wtf`'s module for it I can't find a way to set which context to use, which results in `invalid configuration: no configuration has been provided` after opening.

I think there needs to be a config setting to specify a context
