A suggestion to improve your `README.md` top file:
----


Please describe every single example there with one or two (maybe three) English sentences, interesting to *software developers* ; explain what each example is demonstrating.

I am a 60 years old guy, living in France, with a PhD in artificial intelligence (1990); I am professionally doing [Bismon](http://github.com/bstarynk/bismon/) (documented [here](http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/bismon-chariot-doc.pdf)...). I am thinking of making a similar, but much simpler, thing on Android (also GPLv3+ licensed), as a hobby project.

I am a Linux expert (using and coding on Unix since 1987 and on Linux since 1993) and a free software enthusiast. But [I know nothing about Android](https://android.stackexchange.com/q/216710/305984) and willing to learn to code simple GPLv3+ programs (on my Debian desktop at home) for it.

Feel free to email me to [basile@starynkevitch.net](mailto:basile@starynkevitch.net) about my suggestion.

Regards.
