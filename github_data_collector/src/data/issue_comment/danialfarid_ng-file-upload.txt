"The MultipartStream class in Apache Commons Fileupload before 1.3.2, as used in Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.70, 8.x before 8.0.36, 8.5.x before 8.5.3, and 9.x before 9.0.0.M7 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a long boundary string."

Recommendation is to upgrade to version Apache Commons Fileupload - 1.3.2

I am getting this error in Firefox 

https://i.imgur.com/GJMueYZ.png

The thing is Firefox complains about the type of URL, not an error related to the resource. Is this a limitation in Firefox? How can I circumvent this?

Using Firefox 70.0. ng-file-upload 12.2.13
Hello I just want to add the URL of my repository where I did a PHP implementation of the file chunked upload for this library some years ago

https://github.com/hgouveia/ng-upload-chunked

would be nice if is added on the sections of the sample
use `ngf-resize="{quality: .8}"`

and then this picture is distored,who can tell me why?
When I try to select multiple files, I get the following error:

GET blob:https://angular-file-upload.appspot.com/00283c9c-ab35-42db-8277-de50bfd14f5b net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND

It is reproducible on the demo page: https://angular-file-upload.appspot.com/ . See the attached image.

Increasing Upload.defaults.blobUrlsMaxMemory to a large size like 4GB worked but not sure what is the correct limit. My app users may drag/drop hundreds of large files so at some point may be 4GB will fail too. As per chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/storage/browser/â€¦ , creating blobs too fast may create this situation. If I could add delay in between creating blobs, that probably may help but ng-file-upload does not have any such option. Any pointers will be helpful. Thanks. 


Hi,

I am trying to upload an array of objects where each object will have a list of attachments, something like:

var obj = {
   Description: '',
   RequestId: 'kjdsf9-dsfa',
   Items: [
       { Description: '', Cost: 132.00, Files: [file1, file2]},
       { Description: '', Cost: 461.25, Files: [file3, file4]}
   ]
}

var promise = Upload.upload({
    url: '/localhost/saveRequest',
    method: 'post',
    data: obj
});



However, on the server, the Files array inside every object is null.
Can we upload files as above? Or do we have to upload at the top level only.
Hello

Function uploadProductPhotos($files,product) is not passing correct product when we use ngf-select inside ng-repeat, it is always pass 'product' object of index 0

HTML: 
```html
<div ng-repeat="product in products">
   <div>
       <span>product id: {{product.id}} </span>
       <label style="font-weight: normal; width: 50%; " class="linkButton" for="inputimages">Add more images for same design</label>
       <input style="display: none;" id="inputimages" type="file" ngf-select="uploadProductPhotos($files,product)" multiple ng-model="productimages" name="productimages"  ngf-accept="'image/*'" >
       | <a class="linkButton" ng-click="remove(product)">Remove Design</a>
   </div>
</div>
```

JS:

$scope.products = [{'id': 123, 'sku': 'test1' },{'id':124, 'sku': 'test2'}]
Hi, there is something I can't understand.
i have a form with two input like this
form
  input ngf-select= upload($file, 'option1')/>
 input ngf-select= upload($file, 'option2')/>
form>

I use console log to analyze $file. the thing is that in the first input I find the blob url data. while missing in the second. Do you have nay idea why is so?
thanks

Hi Daniel.

I figured out that when using ngf-pattern with spaces, the pattern match doesn't work correctly, because it includes the space in the regex pattern.

Example:

`ngf-pattern='.xls, .xlsx, .csv'`

Then when I try to upload .xlsx or .csv files it says it's not a valid file extension.

Inside the file validation, when it converts the string to regex, it doesn't remove spaces, so the regex pattern output would be: `(^.*\.xls$)|(^ \.xlsx$)|(^ \.csv$)`. The subgroup 2 and 3 are including spaces.
