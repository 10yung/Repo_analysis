- Set minimal MRI requirement to 2.5, because 2.3 EOL & 2.4 EOL soon
- Update `rubocop.yml` (from my personal based on Rails'), current can't run on latest Rubocop
- Restructure Gemfile and `midori.gemspec`

Hello, Delton Ding!

I'm very interested! I have worked with Sinatra for an API server for tablets, phones and HTML and I'm back again.

Several things I see that I'd like to mention. First, I see that you're already in WebSockets in a big way.  Good work; I think that's one of the biggest development pushes out tehre now that it is finally stabilizing (!!!). Have you given thought to incorporating Swagger/OpenAPI and its editor, since they already do Sinatra?

Secondly, I haven't needed it before but see the need now more than ever, is authentication of APIs. I never got close enough to production before but now see a pressing need for OAUTH2 and API-Key authentication.  I like what Timi Ajiboye's Client Manager does in terms of functionality but don't want the whole Rails framework chewing up CPU cycles. Maybe a simple CL DSL loop?
