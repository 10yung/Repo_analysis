gulp-header version 1.7.1 produces a dependency on 'event-stream' package that has some known vulnerabilities. Even this is a devDepedency, it will be nice to remove this dependency and the warnings in audit tools.

Newer versions of gulp-header solves this issue.
`custom://q123` will link
`custom://1234` will **not** link

Granted this is a niche case, but it's not uncommon to see these types of URLs in intranets or other non-public tooling.

I think this is because `urlMatchDoesNotHaveAtLeastOneWordChar` uses `hasWordCharAfterProtocolRegex` which matches letters, but not numbers.

I believe this check should be loosened to allow numbers if the protocol includes `//`. For example `custom://123` should link while `custom:123` should not.
This is related to #277 in that it's an issue with `getDomainNameStr` in `regex-lib.ts`.

Subdomain names are treated pretty lax out in the wild. It's common to see subdomains with underscores, but autolinker won't identify these links.

For example: `http://_foo.example.com` will identify `foo.example.com` as the link. And `http://foo_bar.example.com` will identify two links (`http://foo` and `bar.example.com`).

@gregjacobs Do you have any general hints on how to target subdomains separately from the normal domain name in `getDomainNameStr`? I can make the changes and write tests, but I'm having some trouble parsing the current logic.

But it works well in this github message
https://www.example.com/download/不動産株式会社（新築そっくりさん）
Since you asked for it (in the breaking changes section):

Please support different prefixes and notations:

Germany: 0176-12345678 (zero-prefixed with hyphen)
France: 0 590 12 34 56 (zero-prefixed with spaces)
Poland: xx xxx xx xx (any zwo-digit number as prefix and spaces)

There are probably many many more notations and prefix systems. Basically, to support them all, I see two possibilities:
1) Introduce an flexible API for matchers (I saw a kind of announcement for that in the release notes / breaking changes section)
2) Write a separate matcher for every possible notation and prefix system and provide fine-grained control which ones get activated or not. The actual matchers could actually be contributed by others if there is a good API (see 1)).

Anyways, thanks for this awesome utility library!!!
When a link includes username/password inside the URL (see userinfo in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL), the automatic linking is wrong.

For example, given the following URL: `https://foo:bar@example.com/foobar`

### Expected behavior:

The link is marked as link as it is (Link to `https://foo:bar@example.com/foobar`)

### Actual behavior:

There are two links (one http link and one mailto link) and some unlinked text:

    Link https://foo
    Unlinked text :
    Link mailto:bar@example.com
    Unlinked text /foobar

Apparently the autolinker doesn't match any phone numbers listed like this:

06-12345678 or 06 12 34 56 78 or 06 12345678


I have tested the following scenario's:
 +316-12345678 +361 12345678 31612345678 316 12345678 316-12345678 +0612345678 +06-12345678 +06 12345678 0612345678 06-12345678 06 12345678 

None of these work.

+31612345678 is the only one that seems to work.

by the way, + in front of 06 is wrong, so is 316 without +. In the netherlands it's either +316 or 06 with 8 numbers behind it. I just wanted to test these in case it did pick it up incorrectly.

Notation can differ, some people tend to write 06-12345678 while others would write it as 06 12 34 56 78, while others write 06 12345678.

I would like to see support for these types of dutch phonenumbers. 
Take a look here for a regular expression that could possibly do the job: https://regexr.com/3aevr

For now my current solution in my usecase is creating a regular expression in my backend to alter the format to work with +31612345678.

I've already tried adding this functionality myself for this module but I couldn't find a way of altering the recognition of the phone number. The replacefn is only meant to change the output, not necessarily the recognition function.

Perhaps it's a good idea to allow people to put in custom recognition function replacements as well, in case their usecase varies. Or the recognition function should work for every type of phone number, e-mail address, url etc around the globe.

This could just be scratching the surface for specific countries.
Hello,

Thanks for this great library, it's very useful. I wanted to add my own custom matcher to the matchers list. I tried this code and it works great :

```
let autolinker = new Autolinker();
let tagBuilder = (<any>autolinker).getTagBuilder();
(<any>autolinker).getMatchers().push(new CustomMatcher({ tagBuilder }));
```

So, could you make the getTagBuilder and getMatchers methods public? With these two public methods, it will be easy to add a custom matcher. Or is there another easy way to add a custom matcher ?

Cordially,
Stephane.
**Expected Behaviour**
IG usernames which have >2 dots in a row (..) should NOT be linkified

**Actual Behaviour**
IG usernames which have >2 dots in a row (..) are linkified via `link` method

Screenshots

Didn't find docs about this but if you try to change you username using 2 dots in a row IG shows a error message.
