Environment:
    macOS Catalina 1015.2
    mas 1.6.3 installed from brew

Install Method:
   brew install mas

Description:
Mas doesn't seem to list all the applications in App Store, for example BBEdit. Other applications are listed perfectly fine.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
On the command line run:
"mas search BBEdit"

Response:
No results found
Error: No results found

Application in App Store can be seen here:
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bbedit/id404009241

Is this an issue with the search term or the App Store itself?

## Describe the Bug

mas outdated apps list is showing software versions that are already installed
In fact system is up to date  so should have been an empty list 

## To Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behaviour:

mas outdated

## Expected Behavior

no updates due to being up to date
no listing of versions that are already installed 


## Actual Behavior

listed software out of date when the versions listed are in fact installed and the latest 

## Screenshots, Terminal Output

> only these apps listed which seems to be the preinstalled iWorks apps. 

$ mas outdated
682658836 GarageBand (10.3.4 -> 10.3.3)
408981434 iMovie (10.1.14 -> 10.1.13)
409203825 Numbers (6.2.1 -> 6.2)
409201541 Pages (8.2.1 -> 8.2)
409183694 Keynote (9.2.1 -> 9.2)

>I already have these versions installed and up to date. I check in the app's about dialog and via mas list command and macupdater.

$ mas list
.....
409203825 Numbers (6.2.1)
408981434 iMovie (10.1.14)
682658836 GarageBand (10.3.4)
409201541 Pages (8.2.1)
409183694 Keynote (9.2.1)
.....

## Additional Context

> strange thing is if I install those packages it installs them again

$ mas upgrade 409203825
Upgrading 1 outdated application:
Numbers (6.2)

> but they are actually removed from the outdated list when next run

$mas outdated
682658836 GarageBand (10.3.4 -> 10.3.3)
408981434 iMovie (10.1.14 -> 10.1.13)
409201541 Pages (8.2.1 -> 8.2)
409183694 Keynote (9.2.1 -> 9.2)

if  I mas list again it shows the package is at the latest version as before.

$ mas list
....
409203825 Numbers (6.2.1)
....

### Did it work in a previous version?
Unknown. - first time used and first time run

## Describe the Bug
After successfully installing DaisyDisk (411643860) or Paw (584653203), neither appears in the output of `mas list`. Subsequently `brew bundle` always reinstalls these even though there is no need to.

## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Run `mas install 411643860`
2. Run `mas install 584653203`
3. Run `mas list`

## Expected Behavior
Output of `mas list` contains DaisyDisk and Paw.

## Actual Behavior
Output of `mas list` is:
```
904280696 Things (3.11)
425264550 Disk Speed Test (3.2)
409183694 Keynote (9.2.1)
405399194 Kindle (1.26.1)
1116599239 NordVPN IKE (5.2.0)
1287445660 Agenda (9.1.2)
585829637 Todoist (7.2.3)
682658836 GarageBand (10.3.4)
425424353 The Unarchiver (4.1.0)
880001334 Reeder (3.2.3)

924726344 Deliveries (3.2.1)
403489261 LittleSnapper (1.8.5)
```

which doesn't include the two applications just installed.

## Additional Context

I'm also using homebrew-bundle with the following `mas` entries:
```
mas "Agenda", id: 1287445660
mas "Blackmagic Disk Speed Test", id: 425264550
mas "DaisyDisk", id: 411643860

`mas reset` doesn't appear to help.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

- macOS is parsing every .App on local file systems and by default auto-enables every apps `document provider` capabilities and adding all "actions" to the respective `share sheets` throughout the interface. 

- Anyone with an above-average collection of software tools, know how fast the "open with..." system dialog list grows ... sometimes returning *every* .app able to provide service for that particular file type. Right-clicked a `.txt` on Catalina lately?   
- In parallel, the "share..." sheet dialog also quicky ridiculou-lizes itself - here coincidentally illustrated via two screen shots superimposed on top of a funny I made with my cat flying through the universe: 

![2019-11-24_02-31-57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/193781/69488234-d880e380-0e66-11ea-827a-9087f9cb7a7d.png)

- `AppDelete`  by Reggie Ashworth (RIP - development taken over by a friend of the family) has a feature called  "Archive":

![2019-11-24_02-55-27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/193781/69488232-d28b0280-0e66-11ea-9021-60f4e575003e.png)

**Describe the solution you'd like**
- I'd like for `mas` - in addition to ` install`  / ` uninstall` - also gain "archive" and "restore from archive" features. 
- When you archive an app with 'AppDelete, it copies the entire .App bundle to a ZIP (or tarball) along with all the preferences and supporting data, then deletes said files - effectively disabling the apps `document provider` capabilities and also the `share sheet actions`. 

In addition to enhancing your the macintosh operators mental well being, you also get a simple way to have a rudimentary backup of the particular version of the app as well as a configuration set known to work on that version. As you are aware Apple restricts access to old versions of apps, and previously having a previous version *including its config* has saved my bacon couple of times. Easier, way faster and less error-prone than restoring from backup.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered:

Using `git LFS` and a dotfiles *bare repository* setup e.g. on `github` is a more complete solution to the above problem. I will argue however that this is complex for many to set up and keep maintained. In addition, having *both* mechanisms in place has no negative effects and can be a clever move for fun and profit anyway.

**Additional context**
Thoughts from the top of my mind:

- `mas archive 1295203466` → move app and all its files to a zip in `/Apps` or `~/Apps`
- `mas archive --tar 1295203466` → same, with tarball
- `mas backup [--tar] 1295203466` → create [zip|tar] but keep application untouched 

Thank you for your time and your awesome success with `mas` cli. **Keep up the great work!**

Hi everyone.

Lately I found out that mas doesn't upgrades anything, although some upgrades exist in AppStore:
<img width="923" alt="Screenshot 2019-11-15 at 10 22 11" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4655239/68931905-d0071980-0791-11ea-9fdf-63f3560f5178.png">

My environment:

- macOS Catalina 1015.1
- mas 1.6.3, installed from brew

Thanks a lot for your help
## Your Environment

- `mas version`: 1.6.3
- macOS version (`system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType -detailLevel mini`): 10.15.0 19A602

### mas Install Method

- [x] `brew install mas` (homebrew-core)

## Describe the Bug / To Reproduce

1.    Partition ssd/harddrive
2.    Install macOS on partition1 (macintosh_hd1)
3.    Install macOS on partition2 (macintosh_hd2)
4.    mount macintosh_hd1 when booted into macintosh_hd2
example-app1 is installed on macintosh_hd1, but not on macintosh_hd2
5.   try install example-app1 via mas when booted into macintosh_hd2
6.   mas thinks example-app1 is already installed
7.   force install example-app1 via mas when booted into macintosh_hd2
8.   mas installs app to macintosh_hd1

## Expected Behavior

mas should always install to the booted macOS installation.


## Feedback

Thanks a lot for this very nice project and all the work that is put into this.

Thanks for looking into the issue in advance.

Kind regards

I just updated to macOS Catalina, rebooted to be sure all works, but `mas "Xcode", id: 497799835` hangs.  It used to work fine in the past.  This command is being run from a `Brewfile`, via `brew bundle install`.

How to troubleshoot this?
