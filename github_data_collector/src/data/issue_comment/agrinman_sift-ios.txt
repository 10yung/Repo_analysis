while I am trying to compile, I got this issue.

`
:-1: Unable to resolve build file: XCBCore.BuildFile (namedReferencesCannotBeResolved) (in target 'Sift')
`

how can I solve this error?

I added supervised mode access to my iPhone 8 plus ios 12.
and after installing the app, I try to enable the status in the app, unfortunately, got a pop up like error enabling filter - NSLocalized Description = Permission Denied.

Please help to fix 
updated the xcode-10 branch build settings for Swift 4.2

May i view request detail, it's help a lot when debugging ~ 
Like Surge iOS and Charles macOS App ~ 
Thanks for creating this! 

Is it possible to integrate some sort of host file blocking into this?
