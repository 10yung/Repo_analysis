I've tried searching for this issue, haven't found any mention of it. I'm not sure if this was done by design. When I clear my history the device recognition setting resets. It's not a critical issue, but it is very inconvenient. I apologize for the lack of structure, I am new to Github.
It looks like there is a similar issue related to Tor private tabs (#14517). However, in this issue, Tor does actually connects. I'm not finding any other issues or anything in the community like this.

### Description
After starting Brave then opening a new private tab with Tor it shows that the browser has connected to the network. When entering and address or search into the address bar, Brave crashes. Once you restart Brave it gives the error that it is unable to connect to the Tor network. This is because when Brave crashed the Tor connection remained open.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open Brave browser and wait for it to finish loading.
2. Right click the plus icon to open a new tab and select "New Private Tab with Tor".
3. After seeing "Successfully connected to the Tor Network!" in the address bar, type in search terms or an address. **After hitting enter, Brave crashes**.
4. Re-open Brave browser by clicking the desktop icon
5. *Repeat steps 2 and 3.* **Here is when Brave sits for a bit trying to connect to Tor. Then returns the error dialog: Unable to connect to the Tor network**.

**Reproduces how often:**
Can reproduce 98% of the time.

### Brave Version

**about:brave info:**
Brave: 0.24.0 
V8: 6.9.427.23 
rev: f657f15bf7e0e0c50a2b854c6b05edb59bfc556c 
Muon: 8.1.6 
OS Release: 6.1.7601

OS Architecture: x64 
OS Platform: Microsoft Windows
Node.js: 7.9.0 
Brave Sync: v1.4.2 
libchromiumcontent: 69.0.3497.100

### Additional Information
When Brave crashes, the Tor process is not killed (on *rare* occasions it is). So the connection stays open. That is when I receive the message saying its unable to connect to the Tor network. However, if the Tor process is killed, it will connect to the network but still crashes almost every time.

Also, it seems that this only happens when using the private tab with Tor is the first thing I do after starting Brave. If I use another tab to go to a web page, then do the steps provided above, it works fine.
Have you searched for similar issues? I have and not found anything.

Description: I am using ZoneMinder ( https://www.zoneminder.com ) to monitor my video security system and while Brave works for some functions it fails when the more advanced options are set (Montage View in particular) that require more than six open connections to the ZoneMinder local server. Also once the per-server limit is reached no other pages from the server (options, logs, console) can be opened.

Steps to Reproduce

  1. Open a connection to a ZoneMinder Montage page ( use your ZM server address instead of zm.home: http://zm.home/zm/index.php?view=montage&group=0 ) with six or more video locations shown.

Actual result:

Only the first six video locations show, any additional locations and things like the State and FPS data that are intermittent connections do not show. No additional pages on the server can be opened.

Switch to a Montage view with less than six locations and observe that the State and FPS information is now displayed and you can open a limited number of additional pages.

Expected result:

Being able to observe at least 9 locations (more would be better) and have the State and FPS information displayed. Being able to open additional pages on the ZM server, Console, Logs and Settings at a minimum.

Having this setting not being the default or even easily changed would be acceptable as few people actually need it.

Having the increased setting only apply to a selected domain or list of servers would also be acceptable and would limit unwanted behavior when accessing other servers.

Reproduces how often: Every time.

This limitation can be bypassed in Firefox (which I hate to use) by changing these settings:

Enter about:config in the address bar

scroll down to browser.cache.check_doc_frequency 3 change the 3 to a 1

browser.cache.disk.enable True -> False
network.http.max-connections-per-server -> put a value of 100
network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-proxy -> 100 again
network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server -> 100 again

This is also a problem in Chrome

Hi guys

I'm unable to listen livestream-events of iteleseminar.com. In previous versions I was able to click the play-button, but recent ones don't even acknowledge the button (no effect). There's no problem playing 'replays' but live-events are no go..

### Description
<!--
[Description of the issue]

With a recent update Chromium changed the default media player UI which now has no volume control anymore.           
In other chromium based browsers you can disable this via chrome://flags/#enable-modern-media-controls.
This is not possible to be disabled in Brave, also adding --disable-features=UseModernMediaControls does not disable the new default media player controls UI.


### Steps to Reproduce
<!--
Please add a series of steps to reproduce the problem. See https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve for in depth information on how to create a minimal, complete, and verifiable example.
-->

  1. Open a supported video file that also has an audio track with Brave.
  2. Become deaf as volume in the "Modern Media Controls" is set to maximum and can not be lowered. Only possible to mute or unmute audio.
  3.
