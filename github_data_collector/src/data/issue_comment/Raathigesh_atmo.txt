Is it possible to have multiple endpoints, but with different query params?
For example: one endpoint would be `/example?foo=bar` and another would be `/example?foo=false`. 
The two endpoints should be able to produce different results.
Hi, I have executed from the command prompt : atmo
and then it shows the mission control and the API http://localhost:3334.

I would like the API to be https://localhost:3334

Can you pls tell me how to do that? Thanks!
