I've created an account matching one of the admin addresses in the config file. I'm able to reach the /colonel "admin" page and I can see some "customers" listed in there, but there's no way to manage these. I need to delete one of the user accounts and I cannot figure out how.

As a somewhat related question, I have two OTS servers behind a load balancer but the accounts are local to each machine. Is there a way to sync the accounts across multiple servers?

How to customize main web page?
Tried to modify v3.html and different css, moustache files, but main web page and burn password page didn't change.
How to achieve it?
I am unable to burn secret that is protected with password. I was trying via webui and API.
can someone share their CONFIG  and REDIS.CONFIG  files so I can see how they are setup properly. I keep getting RuntimeError: ERR invalid password 
The documentation needs to be updated. The version of ruby in it is not supported, I was able to get the last release of 2.3 to work with gems and get the service up and running. I also might have had to use a different version of redis but I don't remember. Lastly some of the documentation needs to be updated for less tech savvy folks and folks who don't know much about ruby/redis/bundler. Essentially I couldnt get bundler to run due to the password but I couldnt find in the config where the password was specified. I was able to resolve everything after about a day of digging and get everything working but its worth updating as this is a great project. 
Hi,

When I run 
`bundle install --frozen --deployment --without=dev`

I get

`An error occurred while installing eventmachine (1.0.3), and Bundler cannot continue.
Make sure that gem install eventmachine -v '1.0.3' --source 'https://rubygems.org/' succeeds before bundling.`

When I run 
`gem install eventmachine -v '1.0.3' --source 'https://rubygems.org/'`

I get
`Error installing eventmachine:
        ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.`

When I run 
`gem install eventmachine -v '1.2.7' --source 'https://rubygems.org/'`
(the latest release according to https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine/releases), it works fine.

How do I tell the bundle to use the newer version of eventmachine so that I can complete the install? I'm on a fresh install of Ubuntu 18.04.2.

Thanks!


Building this Dockerfile gives you an image with all you need to use the bin/run.sh script :)

You can run this image with the source code included on your favorite docker orchestrator.

Or you can run it localy with and moount a volume on /home/ots/onetimesecret

Hi,

I've updated the French translation, but it seems like I can't push my commit to your repo (I'm quite new to git, so maybe I missed something).

Here's the file.

Thanks,
