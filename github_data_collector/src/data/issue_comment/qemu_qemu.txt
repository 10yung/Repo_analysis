That's what i need. Thanks.
Found this information was needed when using my scanner as it kept incrementing the hostport with every sleep/wake cycle knocking it off my running VM.
Hello, I've implemented a simple SP804-like timer peripheral compatible with Broadcom's BCM238x (BCM2835/6/7) specification and is a single-timer version of the actual SP804, without support for one-shot mode.

It doesn't have support for free-running counter and other non-SP804 features, though.
