Fixes issue #1678

Add a new tap gesture recognizer to URLBar that causes BrowserViewController
to expand the URLBar if it is tapped when collapsed.
Currently, the tap target area to expand the toolbar when it is collapsed (e.g. when you scroll down the page) only covers the status bar. That means there's a large portion of the collapsed bar that you can tap and it does nothing, which is quite annoying. On phones without notches the area you can tap is only 20 pts tall. Safari, Chrome, and Firefox all handle this correctly.

Current tap target area:

This PR adds a popup menu to allow the user to jump to a specific page in the history, when long pressing on the back button
When opening a URL from the Share Action sheet eq in Safari, Facebook, ... the Firefox Focus App opens the links, but does not show the erase button.
If the Firefox Focus app is close via the App Switcher the Keyboard is also shown.

## Steps to reproduce
This bug appears sporadically so it's difficult to reproduce every time.

1. Search for something and browse results

2. Click the erase button to clear the page

3. Open the app later and search for something else

4. Browse results based on second search


## What actually happens
After following this sequence the search terms from the first search will sometimes appear in the address bar.

## What should happen
After clicking the erase button previous search terms should never appear in the address bar.
