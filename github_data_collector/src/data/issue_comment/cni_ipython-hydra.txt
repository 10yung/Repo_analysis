Hi there, 

I'm writting a small nodejs proxy that allows to have multiple IPython notebook server virtually listening on the same port, the routing is made thanks to URLs prefixes.

I was wondering if it was interesting you, as for example when most ports are blocked it is easier to have all user through one port. 

I'm startig to develop it  it here : https://github.com/Carreau/IPython-notebook-proxy
It works but is not really user-friendly right now. 

I'll probably release under one of IPython repo.

I'm not sure of how well it behaves under high load.
