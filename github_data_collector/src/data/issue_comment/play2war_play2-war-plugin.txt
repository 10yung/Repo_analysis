I followed the document to create war using play2war plugin. But in war file all i get is lib directory.
I am not seeing my application classes.

What am I missing?
I used following configuration

----- **in build.sbt**----

import com.github.play2war.plugin._
version := "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

Play2WarPlugin.play2WarSettings
Play2WarKeys.servletVersion := "3.1"

-------------------------------

------------**in plugins.sbt**---------------
addSbtPlugin("com.github.play2war" % "play2-war-plugin" % "1.4-beta1")
-------------------------------------------
Hi there.
In our company, we are currently in a process of migrating our Play modules from 2.3 to 2.6 (yup, huge jump).

We managed to upgrade almost everything, except play2war of course. :) 

This is very important for us and therefore I am willing to work on making play2war work with Play 2.6.

Is there any specific procedure to follow? :)

Also, anyone who is willing to help is welcome. :)

PS.
I am aware of https://github.com/play2war/play2-war-plugin/issues/308, but I will work on 2.6 only.
Hi, I have two play project that run as was in a EAP server. But the problem is that I want to have different configuration for the two projects. The problem is that if I use -DConfig.file ... or -DCondig.resource, then this configuration file is loaded for both projects at the same time.

Is there a way to load different configurations for different projects? Or maybe to read an external file like standalone.xml.

Thanks.
I'm struggling with Tomcat 8.0.32 and Play 2.4.x, but only in the production server! Locally, the same environment works like a charm.

In particular, when I deploy as ROOT.war, production's tomcat is unable to route the URLs and returns 404. For instance, the first access redirects from index to /login, but it returns 404 instead of the corresponding view.

Now, the weird facts: if I deploy to a sub-context instead of ROOT.war (for instance, app.war), the routing works. Unfortunately this is not a option since reverse routing is bugged  in Play 2.4 in sub-contexts (https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/4977).

Again, locally everything works. I'm using the same version of tomcat in both enviroments, the same .xml's (differing only in the ports). Any tip?
[help me]
I will config as below
import com.github.play2war.plugin._
name := """light-play-rest-api"""
scalaVersion := "2.11.7"
version := "1.0-SNAPSHOT"
val appVersion = "1.0-SNAPSHOT"
Play2WarPlugin.play2WarSettings
Play2WarKeys.servletVersion := "3.1"
lazy val main = (project in file("."))
  .enablePlugins(PlayScala)
  .settings(Play2WarPlugin.play2WarSettings: _*).settings(
    Play2WarKeys.servletVersion := "3.1"
  ).settings(
   Play2WarKeys.targetName := Some("war_file_name")
)

resolvers += Classpaths.sbtPluginReleases
resolvers += "Typesafe Repository" at "https://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/releases/"

addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.play" % "sbt-plugin" % "2.4.2")

addSbtPlugin("org.scoverage" % "sbt-scoverage" % "1.0.4")

addSbtPlugin("org.scoverage" % "sbt-coveralls" % "1.0.0.BETA1")
addSbtPlugin("com.github.play2war" % "play2-war-plugin" % "1.4.0")


----------
Build OK - so it 's not enough file
It does not have index file 
only two folder 
- META-INF
- WEB-INT

How to start Play application as Production mode using Play2-war-plugin and targeted server is Liberty profile.
As the title, I used Tomcat 7.0.62 as contents.
I think the suggested Play2WarKeys.servletVersion  is "3.0".
But if I use 3.0, the response of Application will be strange, such as twice response happen towards one request.
If I use 2.5, the application will work well.

So I have a question that whether it is OK if I use a 2.5 servletVersion  on Tomcat7.
Page renders nothing.
I'm using Play Framework (version 2.4.2) with WebsphereMQ. So I would like to start my web application which is deployed as war in **WAS liberty profile** without hitting the execution URL  on server startup.
HI i have made rest api in scala using play framework. My Routes files include"

```
 GET     /                           controllers.Application.index 

 GET     /assets/*file                controllers.Assets.at(path="/public", file)
 
 POST   /createfile                @controllers.scala.CaffeOnSpark.FileCreation
```

Now I added Play2War in my 2.4.1 Play framework. My Build.sbt include

```
name := "NT_CAFFE"
version := "1.0"
scalaVersion := "2.11.7"
lazy val `NT_CAFFE` = (project in file(".")).enablePlugins(PlayScala)
libraryDependencies ++= Seq( jdbc , cache , ws   , specs2 % Test )
crossScalaVersions := Seq("2.10.4", "2.11.0", "2.11.1", "2.11.7")
```

My Plugins.sbt includes

```
logLevel := Level.Warn
resolvers += "Typesafe repository" at "http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/releases/"
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.play" % "sbt-plugin" % "2.4.2")
addSbtPlugin("com.github.play2war" % "play2-war-plugin" % "1.4.0")
```

In play framework , we dont need web.xml. Routes does all the work. 
i am able to build war file.. but it includes only lib folder..i mean no classes are there. I copy pasted it in the webapps folder of tomcat and deployed it. But it gives me Action Not found error. Please can you help me with this. What am i  missing ?
