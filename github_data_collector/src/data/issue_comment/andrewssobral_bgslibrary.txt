my platform is win10
use python3.7 and bgs2.0
bgs compiled with opencv3.4.5
I got error
RuntimeError: OpenCV(3.4.5) C:\build\3_4_winpack-build-win64-vc14\opencv\modules\core\src\array.cpp:1246: error: (-5:Bad argument) Array should be CvMat or IplImage in function 'cvGetSize'
in a lot of model,such as MultiCue ,LBMixtureOfGaussians and so on

what is my problem?

Hi there, I need some help.

When I tried to run the **demo2.py**, it reported an **AttributeError: module 'pybgs' has no attribute 'DPAdaptiveMedian'**, then I annotated that line and ran again, same error happened but for the following line: **AttributeError: module 'pybgs' has no attribute 'DPGrimsonGMM'**

![demo2_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50175866/67369152-190ce900-f5ab-11e9-8dab-863448dbae54.png)

However, if I removed the whole  **if is_cv2() or is_cv3()** section, the program could be executed successfully

![demo2_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50175866/67369904-676eb780-f5ac-11e9-9606-6a4f3a2a37bc.png)

PC config.: Windows 10, Anaconda environment, Pycharm 2019.2.1, Visual studio 16 2019, OpenCV 3.4.2 

I followed the https://github.com/andrewssobral/bgslibrary/wiki/Wrapper:-Python to install the **pybgs**  whereas **the installation details were slightly different**, First I cloned this repository and added OpenCV_DIR system path, Next cmake ... BGS_PYTHON_SUPPORT=ON ... **failed**, So I wnet back to **Building Python wrapper from scratch** then used **python setup.py build** and **python setup.py install** as a result I saw the: 
-- The C compiler ...
...
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: ...

Therefore I utilized **VS 16 2019** to build the **bgslibrary.sln** in **.\bgslibrary\build\temp.win-amd64-3.7\Release**, which generated a file named **pybgs.cp37-win_amd64.pyd**

Based on this .pyd file I can smoothly run demo.py and demo2.py (removed a part), but the installation procedure and partial file names were not exactly the same as the tutorial, in addition the error "AttributeError: module 'pybgs' has no attribute 'DPAdaptiveMedian'". 

I hope to know how to fix that.


Sincerely,
â€¦on of BGSLibrary in user projects.

usage:
1.) Install bgslibrary with Cmake
2.) Include bgslibrary in your project:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
find_package(BGSLibrary 3.0.0 REQUIRED)
add_executable(BackgroundSubtractionTester main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(BackgroundSubtractionTester BGSLibrary::BGSLibrary)

Now edited and tested under Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10.
I build bgslibrary with no errors, but there is no libbgs.so or any other related file created during the building. I'm working on Windows 10 and build it using Anaconda. The library is working fine when I run it manually via webcam but not with python 3.6. Kindly please look into it.

Thanks for this great work! I noticed the current [benchmark result](https://github.com/andrewssobral/bgslibrary/wiki/Algorithms-benchmark) is kind of outdated, could you please update that to the latest (with all available algorithms)?


Hi,

I compiled the gui version with cmake and cv4 and it seems to work fine, but there are not as many algorithms available as in your documentation. 

Did I installed it wrong or is it because of cv4?

Can I also drop a small question, maybe anyone has some experience here with this kind of images. I create each few seconds an image of a brood frame with bees and want to remove the moving bees on it. The best approach so far was with AdaptiveBackgroundLearning and 1000 (around 1 hour in time) Images. 
Any other algorithms which should be good for this problem?

Which gives me a relative good result here the first and last image:

Hi,

small update for the wiki, because the folder structure changed?

https://github.com/andrewssobral/bgslibrary/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface:-QT

Section "On Linux/Mac"

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/andrewssobral/bgslibrary.git

cd bgslibrary/gui/qt/build
cmake ..
make

cp bgslibrary_gui ../../../ 
cd ../../../

./bgslibrary_gui 
```

and if you manually installed QT on mac with
```
brew install qt 
```
the folder PREFIX Path is following:
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/qt/5.13.0/
```

Cheers
Hannes
Hi Andrew,

After I installed the gui, I got an error about undefined symbol when trying to run it. Any insight what might cause this?  Thanks you!
**OS** Linux Pop!OS
Error msg:
```
./bgslibrary_gui: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgio-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_ref_count_inc
```



I have bgs.cp36-win_amd64.pyd and libbgslibrary_core.dll, and I've added them to environment variables, but when i import bgs to my project , 
ImportError: DLL load failed: Dynamic Link Library (DLL) initialization routine failed

### System information
**Desktop**
- **OS: win10**
- **Python version: 3.6.5**
- **OpenCV version: 3.3.0**


I try to install this lib from 9:00am to 8:00pm and finally I made it. 
Here is what I got - a pybgs.pyd file, it works well with python3.7, hope that it may help you.
[pybgs.txt](https://github.com/andrewssobral/bgslibrary/files/3509527/pybgs.txt)
Remember to change the file from .txt to .pyd before you use it.
