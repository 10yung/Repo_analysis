### Issue details

I use Version: 2.4.0-dev by https://app.wallabag.it (demo)

### Environment

* wallabag version 2.4.0-dev
* How did you install wallabag? I use demo free hosting


### Steps to reproduce/test case

Just add any web pages after that open this page call left side menu and hit print. You will have only fisrt page on printer.

![изображение](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7081357/72374317-1853a100-371b-11ea-81c0-475594c08031.png)


I see that this issue was reported before [here](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/1261) and [here](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/590) with no solution so far. But could it be done that instead of nothing, Wallabag saved the corresponding video's URL?

For example, I've saved [this article](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/espectaculos/cine/stalker-pelicula-le-costo-vida-tarkovski-nid2170640). Wallabag saved all the text and images but not a single video, and in the place where the videos should be theres an indication of its duration, "01:59" for the first video, "01:09" for the second, etc. Looking at the page's code I see that the first video has this URL: https://videospublicados.lanacion.com.ar/720/Videos/56/148056.mp4. Well, couldn't that URL be in the Wallabag copy instead of the duration data, so at least the reader could click on it and see the video even if not embedded?

BTW, Wallabag formats the descriptive text below the videos like a tittle section, when in fact the original format has a smaller font than regular text. That's not very important but rather distracting and without much sense when one reads the article.
Wallabag can export to various formats like PDF, EPub and others. Could be added a new option to export in markdown format? For taking notes and create brief documents, MD is usually preferred than ODT and HTML. It's a light format, there are a ton of apps compatible with it, and you can edit them in anything that can edit plain text.
I have tried to deploy the container on a synology NAS for couple of hours.
Finally got it going but I had to deploy it with root and no user ID or group ID parameters at all. 

I also get a few other problems. I SSH in to my container as root and run:

docker run -d --name Wallabag --restart always --link MariaDB:wallabag-db 
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass 
-e SYMFONY__ENV__DATABASE_DRIVER=pdo_mysql 
-e SYMFONY__ENV__DATABASE_HOST=MariaDB 
-e SYMFONY__ENV__DATABASE_PORT=3306 
-e SYMFONY__ENV__DATABASE_NAME=wallabag 
-e SYMFONY__ENV__DATABASE_USER=wallabag 
-e SYMFONY__ENV__DATABASE_PASSWORD=pass 
-e SYMFONY__ENV__DATABASE_CHARSET=utf8mb4 
-e SYMFONY__ENV__SECRET=secret 
-e SYMFONY__ENV__DOMAIN_NAME=https://wallabag.mydomain.com 
-e SYMFONY__ENV__FOSUSER_CONFIRMATION=false 
-e SYMFONY__ENV__FOSUSER_REGISTRATION=true 
-v /volume1/docker/Wallabag/data:/var/www/wallabag/data 
-v /volume1/docker/Wallabag/images:/var/www/wallabag/web/assets/images 
-p 1420:80 
wallabag/wallabag

The MariaDB is the linuxserver container. I realise after reading some that I did not actually specify utf8mb4 in that container in any way. That environment variable was not defined in there wiki and Im kinda noob.. I just follow tutorials.. Should I do something there?

In my haproxy reverse proxy config I have bunch of configs which all work great. On several other containers.
This one I just pointed to the http port of wallabag and thats it. I seem to reach the site and login/create account and API etc..

However the viewing experience in the wallabag http gui is awful. Sometimes fonts just double up on eachother. If I delete a article I get error: 404: Not Found
Wallabag\CoreBundle\Entity\Entry object not found.

Some articles dont fetch at all.. I tried the f-droid app on my android and that seemed to work fine. But on my firefox on linuxdesktop with wallabagger addon I get these unfetchable entries in wallabag.

I didnt find any log or anything at all in the docker folder. Maybe I didnt mount it? Couldn't find anything about how to mount log directory in the wiki. But in my synology docker log for the container I see bunch of these:

2020/01/05 23:05:27 [error] 275#275: *339 FastCGI sent in stderr: "PHP message: PHP Warning:  "continue" targeting switch is equivalent to "break". Did you mean to use "continue 2"? in /var/www/wallabag/vendor/doctrine/orm/lib/Doctrine/ORM/UnitOfWork.php on line 2636PHP message: PHP Warning:  "continue" targeting switch is equivalent to "break". Did you mean to use "continue 2"? in /var/www/wallabag/vendor/doctrine/orm/lib/Doctrine/ORM/UnitOfWork.php on line 2665" while reading response header from upstream, client: 172.17.0.1, server: _, request: "GET /delete/6 HTTP/1.1", upstream: "fastcgi://127.0.0.1:9000", host: "wallabag.domain.com", referrer: "https://wallabag.mydomain.com/delete/6"

Just spamming it in the logs..

Could anyone please help a noob like me understand whats wrong? Thanks!

### Environment

* wallabag version 2.3.8
* How did you install wallabag? Via `git clone` 
* php version: 7.3
* OS: debian 10
* type of hosting (dedicated)
* which storage system you choose at install (MariaDB)

### Steps to reproduce/test case

When I export unread articles to an epub file:
    If the export includes all unread articles it works perfectly
    If I filter the unread articles first the export fails with this message:

```
500: Internal Server Error

Type error: Too few arguments to function Wallabag\CoreBundle\Repository
\EntryRepository::getBuilderForSearchByUser(), 1 passed in .../wallabag-
2.3.8/src/Wallabag/CoreBundle/Controller/ExportController.php on line 
74 and exactly 3 expected

```
I send the exported file to my e-reader, as such I like to limit it to the articles that I intend to read
with that device. Maybe this is a fringe usage,  but it certainly makes the export function more
useful as unread articles can build up quite quickly and aren't always first priority.

**Thank you to everyone at wallabag for a very useful application.**

### Issue details
If a tag contains special characters, for example &, then the tag is not searchable. If the tag is added from wallabagger (firefox), it gets encoded to `&amp;`. Adding the tag when viewing the entry in wallabag doesn't encode the character. 

### Environment
* wallabag version (or git revision) that exhibits the issue:  2.3.8
* wallabagger firefox extension: 1.7.0
* How did you install wallabag? from wallabag docker
* OS: Debian 10
* which storage system you choose at install (SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL): MySQL
No source code issue but your download link does not seem to work anymore:
`wget https://wllbg.org/latest-v2-package && tar xvf latest-v2-package`

I've tested also 
 `wget --no-check-certificate https://wllbg.org/latest-v2-package && tar xvf latest-v2-package
`

result: 404


### Issue details

I just did a fresh install of wallabag on an raspberry pi 3B+. Everything goes well with the installation until we access the database for reset, then it gets stuck. 
In raspbian buster for pc (raspi VM w/ VirtualBox) this error doesn't appear and all goes well. Not sure if it's a problem with wallabag or with mariaDB, since doing a DATABASE DROP wallabag after the failed install takes also ~30 seconds or so, which seems too much and probably indicates something wrong with it.
Docker wallabag works fine in the same raspi.

### Environment

* wallabag version 2.3.8
* How did you install wallabag? Via `git clone` then `make install`
* php version: 7.3
* OS: raspbian buster
* hardware: raspi 3B+
* which storage system you choose at install (SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL): MariaDB

### Steps to reproduce/test case

- `git clone` 
- `make install`
All goes well except that the installation gets stuck at this point:
```

 [OK] Success! Your system can run wallabag properly.


Step 2 of 4: Setting up database.
---------------------------------

 It appears that your database already exists. Would you like to reset it? (yes/no) [no]:
 > yes

 Dropping database, creating database and schema...

Hey! I got an error while fetching a [Google Docs link](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/pub?id=1y15nvR28xPxZMF-pFypB4zaxUAzblj3cG2SjvnGIO44).

When trying with the [FiveFilters test page](https://fivefilters.org/content-only/), it [seems to work fine](http://ftr.fivefilters.org/makefulltextfeed.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fpub%3Fid%3D1y15nvR28xPxZMF-pFypB4zaxUAzblj3cG2SjvnGIO44&max=3).

When trying with [f43.me](https://f43.me/feed/test) or Wallabag, it results in a 404 - here's the relevant portion of the log with f43.me:

```
Trying using method "get" on url "https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/pub?id=1y15nvR28xPxZMF-pFypB4zaxUAzblj3cG2SjvnGIO44"
Use default user-agent "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/535.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/15.0.874.92 Safari/535.2" for url "https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/pub?id=1y15nvR28xPxZMF-pFypB4zaxUAzblj3cG2SjvnGIO44"
Use default referer "http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1" for url "https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/pub?id=1y15nvR28xPxZMF-pFypB4zaxUAzblj3cG2SjvnGIO44"
Trying using method "get" on url "https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/+b+"
[...]
Request throw exception (with a response): Not Found
```
So for some reason, it tries to fetch `https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/+b+` instead of the actual URL? However, I can't find a [siteconfig](https://github.com/fivefilters/ftr-site-config) which would cause that to happen, and doing a similar request with curl produces the correct HTML without something like a redirect:

```
curl "https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/pub?id=1y15nvR28xPxZMF-pFypB4zaxUAzblj3cG2SjvnGIO44" --user-agent "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/535.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/15.0.874.92 Safari/535.2" --referer "http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1" | grep -o 'UNLWS glyphs'
```

So I'm really wondering where that `https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/+b+` URL is coming from, or how I could further debug it - thanks for [any pointers](https://www.xkcd.com/138/)!

(Note: I've read the issue template but deleted it because I'm not hosting Wallabag myself and I don't think the Wallabag details are relevant - also not sure if this is the right place, or if this should rather be in the [f43.me repo](https://github.com/j0k3r/f43.me) - cc @j0k3r)
