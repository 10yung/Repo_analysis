I would like to be able to pull data from the chart on a mouse move to pass to a function for another control on my page. Is this possible? Can I call another function from within the tootiphook perhaps? 
I don't find way to change language of date on timed dataset. Is exist ?

For exemple, angularjs-material give $mdDateLocalProvider, but Idon't found on source a way for that ?

Regards,
I didn't find a way to zoom with the mouse wheel. After some research I finally found how to make the zoom work with ctrl and alt key pressed.

But in my opinion that method is not very practical/intuitive...

Is there any chance that n3 chart v2 support mouse wheel one day ? It would be perfect as for now there is no way to zoom out without double clicking !

Greetings ! :)

Is there anyway to plot a trendline with n3 charts ??
Hi there,

_a small foreword first._
From the values i fed my chart with, i'm calculating things like standard deviation, average and so on.
I'm "drawing" these statistical quantities for the according interval i set (e.g. if the interval is set to month, there will be 12 horizontal lines representing 1 year, if interval set to weeks 52-53 lines will represent 1 year)
Now i'm having 2 dots, 1 at the beginning and 1 at the end of each interval.

_What i'd like to have_
What i'd like to be able to do is hiding the dots at the beginning and the end and insert 1 in the middle of the interval.

Also i'd like to be able to change the shape of these "special dots" i'm setting to like triangles or something like that.

I don't want an additional series.

_How i tried to archieve this_
I was able to set a point in the middle by a bit hacky way.
I insert a undefined value at the end of the main series and keep inserting value, undefined, value, undefined, value, ....
This way im able to set an independent point at the exact location i want (in the middle of the line and not connected to other points)
Here seems to be the problem to tell the chart when to show such a point when not. (cuz now i got 3 dots for each interval. 1 at the beginning, 1 in the middle and 1 at the end)

I am currently trying perform conditional coloring of columns/dots. As far as I remember it was possible in V1. Is there any way to do it with V2?

Thanks
I'm currently trying to add a vertical line to my chart using the symbols but I can't see any vertical line on my chart. I tested with horizontal lines and those are working as expected. I'm using release 2.0.28

Config:
```
var chartOptions = {
            axes: {
                x: { key: 'x', type: 'date', ticksInterval: 60 * 24 },
                y: { type: 'linear' }
            },
            grid: {
                x: false,
                y: true
            },
            symbols: [{
                type: 'vline',
                value: new Date("2017-06-21T04:29:06.000Z"),
                color: '#ed4b3a'
            },
            {
                type: 'hline',
                value: 80000,
                color: '#ed4b3a',
                axis: 'y'
            }],
            series: [
              ...
            ],
            drawDots: false
        };
```

This is a screenshot of what I'm seeing: you can see the horizontal line but no vertical line (I even edited the CSS to change with size of both lines but only the hline is visible and changes size)

Let me know if there is anything I'm doing wrong

Is there any plan to support angular 2?
When updating the data of a data series (say with an AJAX call), the zoom and pan is reset. This is rather inconvienient because a user has to repeat the zoom over and over again to see the section of interest if the data changes on a regular base. 

Is there a possibility to "pin" the zooming or to data bind the zoom factor?
