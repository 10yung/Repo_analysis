The style given for ":active" persists, even after releasing the mouse. The console shows the below error.

import Radium from 'radium';

Hi! We've got an issue with v0.26:

_Warning: React does not recognize the `radiumConfigContext` prop on a DOM element._ when using Radium with e.g. `Link` from react-router.

```
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

const RadiumLink = Radium(Link)
```

I suppose `Link` simply forwards all props to the underlying `a` element.
I have a styles object with nested properties.  In my :hover on the parent, I want to change the styles on the child properties...is there a way to do that?   

So something like this:

`const styles = {

   resultItem: {
       [...some styles go here],
       symbol: { /* default style for symbol */
            fontSize: '1.2rem'
       },
       name: {  /* default style for name */
            fontSize: '1.4rem'
       }
       ':hover': { /* hover selector for resultItem parent */
             symbol: {  /* change symbol style on hovering over parent (resultItem) */
                  fontSize: '1.4rem'
             },
             name: {    /* change name style too on hovering over parent (resultItem) */
                  fontSize: '1.6rem',
                  color: 'blue'
             }
         }
     }
}`


Looks like no browser prefixes get added for CSS Grid (specifically for ie11). 

From my initial research it would appear that this is because Support for CSS grid was only introduced by 'inline-style-prefixer' in the latest version (v5.10 -https://github.com/rofrischmann/inline-style-prefixer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#510).

Radium currently uses ^v4.0.0. v5 of the style prefixer drops the Create Dynamic prefixer option:

```
5.0.0
We entirely removed the dynamic version of the prefixer due to constant issues with browser detection and the almost impossible need to keep all the versions updated and in sync. There are no other changes except the import paths for this version.

Improvements, additions and bug fixes will be build on top of the new major version shortly.
```

Is moving to this version an option? or is keeping the dynamic prefixer more important? 
avoiding unneeded prefixes sounds like a good idea, until you want to cache SSR-results.

Including the userAgent in a cache-key is not practical, so you have to use all prefixes both on server and client (to avoid missmatch).

I tried to use `radiumConfig={{userAgent: "all"}}` on server and client, but i still get missmatch. 

E.g. given this style:

```
    display: 'flex',
    padding: 10,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'space-between',
```

produces:


```

Server: 

"padding:10px;
display:-webkit-box;
display:-moz-box;
display:-ms-flexbox;
display:-webkit-flex;
display:flex;
-webkit-align-items:center;
align-items:center;
-webkit-justify-content:space-between;
justify-content:space-between;
-ms-flex-align:center;
-webkit-box-align:center;
-ms-flex-pack:justify;
-webkit-box-pack:justify" 

Client: 

"padding:10px;
display:flex;
-webkit-align-items:center;
align-items:center;
-webkit-justify-content:space-between;
justify-content:space-between;
-ms-flex-align:center;
-webkit-box-align:center;
-ms-flex-pack:justify;
-webkit-box-pack:justify"
```

its weird that there are some prefixes (e.g. on flex-align. But "display: flex" is missing a prefix on the client.
Here is my code 
```
import Radium from 'radium';
import TextareaAutosize from 'react-textarea-autosize';

let style = {
    minHeight: 50,
    borderStyle: 'solid',
    width: '99%',
    resize: 'none',
    ':hover': {
      boxShadow: '0 0 8px 0 rgba(110, 100, 200, 0.6)',
      border: 'red !important',
      backgroundColor: 'yellow !important',
    },
    ':focus': {
      outline: 'none',
    }
};

class TextArea extends React.Component<iProps>{
  
...
        return (
          <InputWrapper>
            {label && <Label htmlFor={name}>{label}</Label>}
            <TextareaAutosize
              key={1}
              style={style}
              minRows={1}
              maxRows={6}
              {...input} 
              id={name} 
              name={name} 
              meta={meta}/>
              {meta.error && <span>{sentenceCase(meta.error)}</span>}
          </InputWrapper>
...
    );
  }
}

export default Radium( TextArea );
```

But whatever variations of wrapping the app using Radium that I try or anything else at all, focus and hover JUST DONT WORK. I was so grateful to find this package only to find that it doesn't do what it says it does. Am following the documentation directly
