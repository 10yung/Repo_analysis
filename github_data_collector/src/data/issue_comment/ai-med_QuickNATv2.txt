Are there any toolboxes to replace Freesurfer? I am working under Windows 10 OS. 

The QuickNAT wrapped by MatConvNet works. I read in a volume image using Matlab and send it as the input of **SegmentVol**. However, the segmentation result is weird. Therefore, is it possible to make use of some other surrogate Freesurfer for pre-data processing, such as transforming data into mgz format, and to realize iso-tropic resolution.

Hope it is clear. Thanks.
Hi, I saw you mentioned in step 5 (Enter the path and name of the MRI volume, use freesurfer to do it using the command: 'mri-convert --conform InputVol OutputVol'). Is this part of the pre-processing step? If I have my own data, do I need to run freesurfer or I can directly test my data?

Thanks,
Dear Dr. ROY,
   
    Can you give me a detailed introduction about how to make imdb?

thanks,

The segmentation looks great but in my machine it took 120 seconds after I changed

[Predictions, SegTime] = SegmentVol(Data,70); % Change the 70 based on your GPU RAM size

to

[Predictions, SegTime] = SegmentVol(Data,10); % Change the 70 based on your GPU RAM size

The problem is when do resampling we either change the spacing or the size. In your sample case the spacing was 1mm and the size 256. I have an image with spacing 1.3mm and size 130, I don't think it is possible to change this image to 1mm and 256 with keeping its actual measurements.

Sorry if this is a very beginner question but could you please provide an example/tutorial about how to train the network on different dataset?
