Hi,

First, thanks for this great library!

While experimenting with the API, I'm wondering if there's a way to include an image, say at the top of the first column of a 3 column layout, where the image pushes the first column down as much as its necessary.

My first (naive) approach was to use new lines at the beginning of the text than position the image accordingly:

```
doc
  .text('Title of the page', 60, 60)
  .image('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEA9AD0AAD/7R60UGhvdG9zaG9wIDMuMAA4QklNBAQA...', 
    60, 90, {width: 130})
  .text('\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of...', {
    columns: 3,
  });
```

result:

which produces the desired result, but I'm not sure if that's a good idea.

Any suggestion?
Thanks!
  # Bug Report


## Description of the problem
`doc.heightOfString()` blocks/runs until the process is terminated. It doesn't return anything.

At the least it should return `undefined` or `null` or `0`

## Code sample
```js
// The file's margin
const MARGIN = 54;
const doc = new PDFDocument({ margin: MARGIN, size: "A4" });
const filePath = join(__dirname, "../../output.pdf");
doc.pipe(createWriteStream(filePath));

const params = {
  width: 6,
  height: 460
};

const text = "a text that is not too long";

// Doesn't return anything, blocks execution
doc.heightOfString(text, params);

doc
  .fontSize(8)
  .text(text, MARGIN, MARGIN, params);

doc.end();
```

# Question

How can I reduce the memory usage of pdfkit when creating a PDF containing a lot of data URI images?  

## Description

I am generating a data URI image-heavy PDF in a lambda function with a maximum memory size of 3008 MB.  Generating my 550 MB PDF is using nearly all of the memory my lambda is allowed (and I will need to generate larger PDFs in the future).  All of my images are provided as data URIs.  I looked at the pdfkit images code and I am wondering if the excessive memory usage is because pdfkit uses the "src" string as a key in the _imageRegistry (in images.js).  So my data URIs are being saved in the _imageRegistry in both the key and value, as well as being embedded in the PDF document.  I only use each image once, so I think that I don't need the images to be stored in the _imageRegistry at all.
# Question
How can I add an additional single line in header from second page onward in my python project using pdfkit.

## Description
I am using pdfkit in my python project and using the following options.

```
options={
        'encoding': 'UTF-8',
        'footer-html': os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR,'templates/footer.html'),
        'header-font-size': 7,
        'header-right': '[page]/[topage]',
        'margin-bottom': '1in',
        'margin-left': '0.5in',
        'margin-right': '0.5in',
        'margin-top': '0.5in'
        }
```
I already have a `'header-right' `tag and want it as below:
1. A single line on left in header (for eg: Hi Welcome ! ) starting from second page only if the page exists? So @devongovett , can you please help me for the same?

# Question

## Description

Hello I am implementing pdf generator that follows some standards one of them is to have several lists discriminating some information was where I had problems to perform the following tasks:

One: Apply a certain color to list items
Tow: Leave list points with another color

Note: The options contained in the documentation also do not work except the option:  **textIndent**
[Source](http://pdfkit.org/docs/text.html#lists)
## Code sample

```
doc.list(["Ir ao banheiro", "TransferÃªncia", "Vestir", "Alimentar"]);
```
**Note: I can only change the color by always placing before each `doc.list([]);` a `doc.fillColor(colorList);`**

I have PDFs that are not generated by pdfkit. It would be cool if I could inject them into my pdfkit document the same way we can embed an image. This would allow me to add other content to the page as well so I could add a header and footer(with correct page numbers) over the top of the injected PDF so it all looked like it belonged together. 

To my knowledge, the only way to do this today is to use some tool to convert the PDF pages to images and inject them that way. Either that or I would need to use another tool to merge these PDFs after being generated by pdfkit. The downside would be that the footer wouldn't be on the merged pdf pages.

What do you think?  Doable?

> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.
