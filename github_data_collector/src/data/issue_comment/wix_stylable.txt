If in the following example I modify `fancy-border-mixin.st.css`, the changes are not recompiled.

```
:import {
  -st-from: './fancy-border-mixin.st.css';
  -st-default: FancyBorder;
}

.fancyButton {
  --st-mixin: FancyBorder;
}
```


Since our `:import` is very verbose we can offer simpler and "valid" css syntax to imports.
it's basically esm imports but replacing the Curly brackets with Brackets  and no support for `* as` imports.
It's fully compatible with our current model so it can be a minor change.

New syntax examples: 
```css
@st-import Button from "./button.st.css";
@st-import Button, [icon, text] from "./button.st.css";
@st-import [icon, text as myText] from "./button.st.css";
```
I'm using Stylable Intelligence for VS Code, and every time I make a syntactic error in the `value` function, e.g. type `color: value(`, the problems panel pops up, obscuring the code I'm writing.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/415252/72248384-b4888580-35ff-11ea-8f11-07ad8c79be8c.png)

It would be a better user experience to underline the error in red without opening the problems panel.
Currently we're performing an extra transformation of stylesheets during parsing in order to extract assets originating through 3rd party mixins (only when used).

We should find the optimal place in the webpack lifecycle that would allow us to perform stylesheet transformations only once.
This option will enable shorter and cleaner class names in development. and will throw Error on duplicate namespace usage by different files.

Is there a feature in Stylable webpack plugin that allows loading assets from node modules? In css-loader you can use tilde (`~`) character for this.

Would it be possible to add support for tilde to Stylable webpack plugin as well? As something like this currently does not work as expected:

```css
.root {
  background-image: url('~wix-ui-icons-common/ArrowRight.svg');
}
```

At the moment our `resolveSelectorElements` method does not properly handle nested parts of a selector (native nested pseudo states come to mind, such as `:not()`).

It should expose a new field on its return value, `nested` with the relevant AST information for those nodes and not resolve it as part of the root level selector.

```css
.root:not(.x) {}
```
