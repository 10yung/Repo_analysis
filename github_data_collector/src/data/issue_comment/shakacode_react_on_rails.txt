I'm working on updates for React on Rails and React on Rails Pro. 

At the top of my list are:

1. Easy bundle splitting with https://github.com/gregberge/loadable-components#readme
2. Hot reloading, HMR with https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin

Bigger updates might include:
1. Requiring Rails 5 
2. Requiring rails/webpacker
2. Ruby 2.5+

Thoughts?
Hi there, thanks for the great tutorial.  As I turned **prerender: true** . 

I got this error..  I searched in issues and someone had a similar error but in different context.  Could you help me out?  thanks!

`
ERROR in SERVER PRERENDERING
Encountered error: "uninitialized constant #<Class:0x00007fa4ec57e638>::ExecJS"
when prerendering HelloWorld with props: {"name":"Stranger"}

code:

        (function() {
          var railsContext = {"railsEnv":"development","inMailer":false,"i18nLocale":"en","i18nDefaultLocale":"en","rorVersion":"11.2.1","rorPro":false,"href":"http://localhost:3000/hello_world","location":"/hello_world","scheme":"http","host":"localhost","port":3000,"pathname":"/hello_world","search":null,"httpAcceptLanguage":"en-US,en;q=0.9","serverSide":true};

          });
        })()

## Problem
With the 4.2.2 version of Webpacker (and maybe some earlier versions), webpacker will run a "cleanup" task after compilation.

The goal for this cleanup is the same as older Sprockets. Assets older than a couple of versions get deleted. The problem is when we're building an unversioned, no-hash-in-name, server bundle inside the same output directory. Since rails/webpacker does know about the files outside of the manifest, it just deletes them.

Here is one of the PRs that resulted in this cleanup behavior: https://github.com/rails/webpacker/pull/2389.

So, what's the cleanest way to have custom webpack configuration build a server bundle without risking conflicts with rails/webpacker for the long-term?

## Options
1. Move the server bundle so it’s not within or in a subdirectory of the client files. This can be done with a file specification like this, in `config/initializers/react_on_rails.rb`:

```ruby
  config.server_bundle_js_file = "../#{Rails.env}-server/server-bundle.js"
```

The output file should be configured like 

```js
const serverBundleOutput = () => ({
  filename: `../${railsEnv}-server/server-bundle.js`,
  path: config.outputPath,
  publicPath: config.outputPath,
});
```

2. Have the server-bundle hashed and included in the manifest. Normally, there is little advantage to having a hash on the server bundle. It gets rebuilt at each deployment. Since browsers do not read this file, there's no necessity to have this file fingerprinted. However, if this file is not hashed and in the same directory as the other webpack client files, then rails/webpacker doesn't know to keep it. Webpack plugin [webpack-assets-manifest has an option for "merge"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-assets-manifest#merge). The plugin option `merge` should be set to true. One disadvantage of doing this is that concurrently building the client and server bundles is likely hazardous due to the possible concurrent modification of the manifest file. Thus, the flow should be run the client and server builds sequentially.

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Greetings! I am so excited to open this issue.

## Problem:
* At first glance, I've noticed the design of some components is not finished, and that some components have overlapping IDs which shouldn't happen in HTML, ID's are supposed to be unique.


## Solution:
* I would like to add some style to the components as well as fixing the above problem, while I am doing this I hope to notice more issues to work on.


### This is my first official Issue, please provide me with further information if needed.
### Thank you! :) :bulb: 

Added documentation for typescript installation

Documentation now includes **optional** instructions as to how to use the Webpacker gem, running the react_on_rails generator, to support typescript.

Resolves: #635

The `config.build_production_command` should have been named the `config.build_precompile_command` as this runs any time precompile is run. So if the precompile command is building production ENV assets, then that will be useless for running during a CI build that uses the test ENV.

```ruby
ReactOnRails.configure do |config|
 

 # This command runs when precompiling 
  config.build_production_command = 'yarn run build.prod'
```
Changed relative file paths, introduced alias for webpack config, changed webpacker to use master for debugger to work
