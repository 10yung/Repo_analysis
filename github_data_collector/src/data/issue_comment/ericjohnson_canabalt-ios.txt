Hi, 
I am having below error.

/Desktop/Apps/Open Source Apps/canabalt-ios-master/ImportFromCoreData/bestruns.xcdatamodeld, NSUserStringVariant=(

not getting coredata file, please help


Is there any possibility of compiling Canabalt to HTML5, so that itâ€™s playable on mobile through the browser? Would be quite cool to have this on Firefox OS for example.

The readme here on github should have some more info

In particular it seems weird to me that it doesn't link to the app on the appstore. This one I presume: http://itunes.apple.com/app/canabalt/id333180061?mt=8  but without a link in the readme there's potential confusion.

There are openAL issues with iOS5.
Sound effects do not play, but music is fine.

Hello,

Here are two patches that allow the project to build with Xcode 4.

Thanks!
Philippe
