When trying to build docker image I got following error:
```

I used the docker mode to start cloudtunes-server. The following things went OK
supervisord
redis-server
mongdb
Except cloudtunes-worker. 
The error messages were as follows:

MusicBrainz API now requires a User-Agent header without which it doesn't function.

Instead of using only one docker image with databases included in it, use 3 images:
1. https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/
2. https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/
3. cloudtunes

Why is it better:  
- "docker style" is to have only one main process per container.
- faster build of cloudtunes image
- up-to-date versions of redis and mongo 
- smaller image size


The whole installation worked perfect without any errors, but when I want to open http://localhost:8000/ in my browser, I always get the message ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED and nothing happens. Is that a configuration problem of my system (OSX Yosemite) or is there are problem in my cloudtunes installation? I tried it with Chrome, Safari, Firefox.
I don't know where to search for a solution because, as I said, the installation worked fine.
Sorry for being a github-newbie, this was my first try in working with the terminal since I'm using a Mac.

trying to install cloudtunes-server but pymongo needs to be donwgraded. i have on my debian testing machine python-pymongo=2.7.1-1 installed but exactly 2.7 is needed. so after if execute "cloudtunes-worker worker --loglevel=INFO -c 4 &" to start the server, there is a log messeage like "ImportError: Motor 0.2.1 requires PyMongo at exactly version 2.7. You have PyMongo 2.7.2.". 

why is exactly this version needed, and not also a newer version usable? my repo just have this version of pymongo and i don't want to install it manually with a .deb package or something

can anyone please update the code so that also newer versions can be used?

Hello world and @jakubroztocil,

I've been trying to setup CloudTunes for several weeks with no luck. I had a friend do some debugging and he thought the following might be helpful...
