Knowing if a region wants 12/24 hour time etc could be useful
Hi

Thanks for this great library.

The `Chronology` release version is not available now.
I installed with `master` branch by using `Carthage`, but it is useful to release the current version.
Thanks.

What would you think about changing the method signatures such that as a general rule, all zero-argument methods that return a value were replaced with computed properties? For example, `func now() -> Instant` would be replaced by `var now: Instant`. I think this would make code that called those methods significantly more concise and easier to read.




This seems fairly important.
Having an "RFC"-style layout would make it easier to digest (should, should not, must, must not, ...)
