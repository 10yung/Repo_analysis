I have added using pods and give class to uiview CVCalendarView but can't see anything 
When deselectionAnimation() is finished in animateDeselectionOnDayView() the self.coordinator is being accessed, however at this point in time the user might navigate from the calendar and the calendarView can be deallocated which results in the crash.

- [x] I have verified that I am using the latest version of CVCalendar.
- [ ] I have given my issue a non-generic title.

## Expected Behavior
<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen --> 
want to display the calendar in RTL with Arabic font support and display the calendar dates in Ararbic
<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->

## Current Behavior
<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> 
Now RTL is working when I gave calendarView.semanticContentAttribute = .forceRightToLeft. But the digits(calendar dates still not changed to Arabic).

## Expected Behavior
I want the calendar to use only .weekView, and I want it to look like this:

## Current Behavior
<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->
<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->
When running app with .monthView, everything works fine, but when I run while using .weekView, the dates doesn't show up.

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
1. The only change I did when doing this is change from .monthView to .weekView

## Context
This is how it looks like when using .monthView:

This is how it looks like when using .weekView:

## Your Environment
* Device used i.e. iPhone 6S: iPhone 11 Pro Max
* Physical device (y/n): Yes

This is not an "issue" but more of a hey anyone interested.  Looking at creating an CVEvent to go along with CVCalendar.  One that you could call and it would give you an hourly day view allowing you to swipe a time range to set an event and then add it to CVCalendar (visually allowing you to see blocked times).

Thoughts?
Access to "validated" or a getter/setter would be beneficial for forcing a complete rebuild of the calendar views when new data is present.
