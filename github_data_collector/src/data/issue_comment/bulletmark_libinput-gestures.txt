In the past it has been requested to package this great utility as a deb package. Because lack of access to debian/ubuntu environment the request was rejected. It was also mentioned that there are some fedora coprs providing rpms, the mentioned one are outdated but, nevertheless, there are a couple of new ones.

In any case, the packaging situation of libinput-gestures is lacking. Now that flatpak and snaps are quite mature technology, would you consider providing one package for all supported platforms? Maybe you could join efforts with https://gitlab.com/cunidev/gestures and provide a package with a nice gui that is easily installable from a software manager.
Hello,
i wanted to execute different commands depending on which application was active at the moment of the gesture (like touchegg did? - never got it to work). If the gesture for the active application is not configured, then it looks for the respective gesture in a catchall section (section name defaults to 'general'). Maybe the modification is useful for others, too.
