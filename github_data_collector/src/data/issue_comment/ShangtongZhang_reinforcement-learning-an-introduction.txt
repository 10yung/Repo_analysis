I think the table plot of the policy need a small correction. It needs to be flipped before plotted:
plt.table(cellText=np.flipud(self.policy), loc=(0, 0), cellLoc='center')
Otherwise the y-label and the policy will mismatch.
hi,As the following algorithm,I didn't see the corresponding sentence in the code "Unless the pair S t , A t appears in S 0 , A 0 , S 1 , A 1 . . . , S t 1 , A t 1 :"

Initialize:
pi(s)  belongs to   A(s) (arbitrarily), for all s  belongs to  S
Q(s, a)  belongs to  R (arbitrarily), for all s  belongs to S, a belongs to A(s)
Returns(s, a)<-empty list, for all s belongs to S, a belongs to A(s)
Loop forever (for each episode):
   Choose S 0 2 S, A 0 2 A(S 0 ) randomly such that all pairs have probability > 0
   Generate an episode from S 0 , A 0 , following pi: S 0 , A 0 , R 1 , . . . , S T 1 , A T 1 , R T
   G<-0
   Loop for each step of episode, t = T 1, T 2, . . . , 0:
      G=lambda*G + R t+1
      Unless the pair S t , A t appears in S 0 , A 0 , S 1 , A 1 . . . , S t 1 , A t 1 :
         Append G to Returns(S t , A t )
         Q(S t , A t ) = average(Returns(S t , A t ))
         pi(S t )=argmax a Q(S t , a)
