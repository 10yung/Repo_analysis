` self.userCreatedMarker.groundAnchor = CGPoint(x: 1.0, y: 1.0)
      
  let vwAnno      = SVPulsingAnnotationView(annotation: MKMapView().userLocation, reuseIdentifier: "str")
        vwAnno.center   = view_pin.center
        view_pin.addSubview(vwAnno)`

Here is my code. 
- Pulsing effect like ring look like little bit stuck.
Please help to solve these issue.
Thanks in advance

It is danger!

I think the super class `MKAnnotationView` has the properities `image` and `annotation`, we can not override it.

I love this annotation, but I have a question! 

I'm using it in a map based app I'm working on in Swift (I just started developing in Xcode a couple months ago, so I'm unfamiliar with Objective-C), but I want the color of the annotation on the map to change according to speed of a user as the location changes without removing the annotation from the map. The UserLocation pulsing annotation does this if you change the TintColor of the map.

In my code, I'm updating the annotation color as follows. I have a class I created called vehicle where I can access updates to location, etc. of vehicles (these vehicles are not necessarily the user, their info is stored in a database we're accessing). I also created a custom annotation called MGAnnotation that has a property called color that I can change dynamically and `vehicle.icon` is an instance of it. Finally, I have a function `updateColor()` which calculates a color using the speed.

`vehicle.icon.subtitle = "Speed: \(speed) m/s"`
`vehicle.icon.color = updateColor(speed)`
`vehicle.icon.coordinate = last_location`
`mapView.addAnnotation(vehicle.icon)`

In the rendering function I have:

`if let annotation = annotation as? MGAnnotation {`
            `let annotationView =  SVPulsingAnnotationView(annotation: annotation, reuseIdentifier: "pulse")`
           `annotationView.annotationColor = annotation.color`
          `annotationView.canShowCallout = true`
          `return annotationView`
      `}`

In the first block of code, when `vehicle.icon.coordinate` changes, the annotation changes location on the map accordingly, but the color doesn't update. Is there any easy fix to this that I could make in the SVPulsingAnnotation code?

Thanks!

Hello,

I want to use your animation effect with my custom Image as current location Image.

If I am giving your setImage: call then the pulsing is not seen around my image, Can you advice. I am also using ur Pods as instructed.

iOS 9 issue maybe? Some random time after having already set the pulse to green.

```
[pulse setPulseColor:[UIColor redColor]];
NSLog(@"%@", string);
```

Never works but I get the NSLog after it every time.

I have no trouble changing just the annotation colors back and forth.

When I try to change both of the colors at the same time I'll only get the annotation change. 

In order to get the pulse change I have to change the color an extra time, so my current work around looks like this:

```
[pulse setAnnotationColor:[UIColor redColor]];
[pulse setPulseColor:[UIColor redColor]];
[pulse setAnnotationColor:[UIColor redColor]];
```

It's as if the pulse change gets put on the stack, but doesn't get popped off until I change the color. 

If I add an image to the SVPulsingAnnotationView is stays behind the dot and as "pulseColor" is no available I cannot set the dot to clearColor 

I added multiple SVAnnotation to the MKMapView,
and set:
pulsingView.canShowCallout = YES;

But, this setting does not work.
pulsingView can not be Call out.

Can anyone help me?

This great code should be used with Google Maps SDK. You probably don't have time to this. I add this issue so someone (maybe me) could do this some time. 
So the one who will implement this should probably use UIView and add it as a subview to the ViewControllers view. [This](https://github.com/ryanmaxwell/GoogleMapsCalloutView) example does it with the [SMCalloutView](https://github.com/nfarina/calloutview) using `mapView:didChangeCameraPosition` delegate method.
It is possible that GMSMarker can handle CAAnimation though. It has a CALayer but I don't know how to use it yet.


Is it possible to stop the pulse?
