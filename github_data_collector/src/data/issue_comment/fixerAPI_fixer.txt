hi, I want to know how much of my quota I've used up to find out if I can do one more query or not... is there any function that can help with that?
Please prove that you are human by ticking the box.

老是提示以上错误，但是没有box可以勾选的地方啊？

We're suddenly seeing these (hidden) errors from fixer

```ruby
irb(main):001:0>     response = RestClient.get(
irb(main):002:1*       "https://data.fixer.io/api/latest",
irb(main):003:1*       :params => {:base => "USD", :access_key => fixer_api_key}
irb(main):004:1>     )
=> <RestClient::Response 200 "{\"success\":...">
irb(main):005:0> JSON.parse(response)
=> {"success"=>false, "error"=>{"code"=>105, "type"=>"https_access_restricted", "info"=>"Access Restricted - Your current Subscription Plan does not support HTTPS Encryption."}}
```

We're on the free legacy plan ... We can switch to HTTP obviously. Those conversion rates are not really a secret, but our api key kinda is, isn't it? Are you actually encouraging people to leak their own API keys to your system??

We don't have a problem paying for a good service (in fact, I upgraded to a paid account), but this feels a bit like bait-and-switch, I have to say... Especially since you guys dropped the open API a while back which also caused us issues until we signed for the legacy account. So it's not the first time :-/

Returning an error inside a 200 seems also a bit weird and I was lucky to debug this by chance and find out it was doing this... 
Can i change base currency to USD ?
Hi, I tried using `base=USD` however I get back the following error:

`{"success":false,"error":{"code":105,"type":"base_currency_access_restricted"}}`

url: [http://data.fixer.io/api/latest?base=USD&access_key=35a3ad0f2f253d37131b68cd1b5953fc](http://data.fixer.io/api/latest?base=USD&access_key=35a3ad0f2f253d37131b68cd1b5953fc)

**My services/api.ts file**

    import axios from 'axios'

    import { converters } from '../utils'

    const fixerAPI = 'http://data.fixer.io/api/';
    const fixerKey = '35a3ad0f2f253d37131b68cd1b5953fc';

    export const getLatest = async () => {
      const fixer = axios.create({
        baseURL: fixerAPI,
        params: {
          base: 'USD',
          access_key: fixerKey
        }
      });

      try {
        const res = await fixer.get('latest');
        const ratesArray = converters.ratesIntoArray(res);
        return ratesArray;
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
      }
    }

```
curl http://localhost:8080/latest
{"error":"Date too old"}
````

whatever api i called, it return this error.
i use docker-compose to run this app
- Nuget package to consume Fixer.IO from Dotnet
Enhancement Request:

Would it be possible to add support for adding the `TWD - Taiwan New Dollar` currency into the API feed?
According to documentation, in case of an error "info" index should be present in response, but instead, there's only "type" index. Here's a simple example:

["success"]=> bool(false)
["error"]=> array(2) {
  ["code"]=> int(105)
  ["type"]=> string(31) "base_currency_access_restricted"
}
