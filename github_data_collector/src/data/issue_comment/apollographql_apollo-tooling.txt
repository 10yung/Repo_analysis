### Problem
When you use the codegen tool to generate your types, enums are by default ordered alphabetically. I  think this might be ok for the most cases, but for example if you have an enum of months like this:

``` JS
enum Month {
    JANUARY
    FEBRUARY
    MARCH
    APRIL
    MAY
    JUNE
    JULY
    AUGUST
    SEPTEMBER
    OCTOBER
    NOVEMBER
    DECEMBER
}
```
And you want to use them in a dropdown or address them by index, it is pretty useless to have it sorted by codegen like this;

``` JS
export enum Month {
  APRIL = "APRIL",
  AUGUST = "AUGUST",
  DECEMBER = "DECEMBER",
  FEBRUARY = "FEBRUARY",
  JULY = "JULY",
  JUNE = "JUNE",
  JANUARY = "JANUARY",
  MARCH = "MARCH",
  MAY = "MAY",
  NOVEMBER = "NOVEMBER",
  OCTOBER = "OCTOBER",
  SEPTEMBER = "SEPTEMBER",
}
```

### Expectation
My suggestion would be to reflect the type definition in the schema by default and implement a possibility to set custom sorting via the config file. So that the outcome will be by default:

``` JS
export enum Month {
  JANUARY = "JANUARY",
  FEBRUARY = "FEBRUARY",
  MARCH = "MARCH",
  APRIL = "APRIL",
  MAY = "MAY",
  JUNE = "JUNE",
  JULY = "JULY",
  AUGUST = "AUGUST",
  SEPTEMBER = "SEPTEMBER",
  OCTOBER = "OCTOBER",
  NOVEMBER = "NOVEMBER",
  DECEMBER = "DECEMBER",
}
```

### Workaround
As a (dirty) workaround for anyone who is also experiencing this issue you can open **_npm/node_modules/apollo/node_modules/apollo-codegen-core/lib/utilities/graphql.js_** from your global npm directory and perform the following replacement:

``` JS
4: function sortEnumValues(values) {
5:    //return values.sort((a, b) => a.value < b.value ? -1 : a.value > b.value ? 1 : 0);
6:    return values;
7: }
```

But keep in mind that **this will only work until you make the next update**, or this is solved ;-)

### Before opening a new feature request, please check to see if a similar feature request already exists or has been closed before.

### Feature requests should include as much detail as possible:
- [ x] A descriptive title
- [ x] A description of the problem you're trying to solve, including *why* you think this is a problem
- [ x] An overview of the suggested solution, including which projects would need changing (e.g. vscode-apollo & apollo-language-server)
- [ ] If the feature changes current behavior, reasons why your solution is better
-->

It'd be cool if vscode extension respects `.env` file, so env vars can be consumed.
 
```js
// apollo.config.js
module.exports = {
  client: {
    service: {
      name: "foo",
      url: process.env.LOCAL_SERVER_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT,
    }
  }
}
```

+ fix #1742 

This adds a new feature to the Codegen tasks of the CLI to allow a custom persisted query ID generation. This is an effort continued from apollo-android project https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/pull/1849 to have it for swift and typescript projects. 

I would appreciate some initial feedback on the approach in this PR. I'll continue further efforts in this PR regarding tests and documentation.
