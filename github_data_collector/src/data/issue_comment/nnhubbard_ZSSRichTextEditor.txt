Hi RichTextEditor community! I'm from [YoomamaFTW/RichEditorView](https://github.com/YoomamaFTW/RichEditorView), which is a revised and iOS 13 compatible RichEditorView.

I'm looking for those willing to contribute some JS help. Currently, I am aiming to make our repositories better than Apple's by supporting all functionalities and adding more. Currently, all our editors don't have a couple features such as drawing, document scan, checkboxes, and tables.

Actually, I just implemented checkboxes in my repo and want to share it with you guys. But for the others, we should collaborate on the JS since that is the most difficult (and by far my unhappiest) coding times. Lemme know if you're interested.
will there be a dark mode support for this plugin?

thanks
