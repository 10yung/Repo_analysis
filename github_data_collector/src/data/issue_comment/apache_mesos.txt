Related to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-9718.
Zookeeper URL now optionally can have syntax:
zk://zk_auth_scheme!zk_auth_data@host:port/path

If there is no "!" in URL it works as before with digest auth scheme.

For example, I use it with our Zk auth plugin like this:
zk://simple!login:password@127.0.0.1:2181/mesos
Here "simple" is an authentication scheme name.
