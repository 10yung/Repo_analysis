Does anyone can help me so that themes in bonfire version 0.9.3 can be integrated with ACE themes. I really want to beautify the bonfire that I'm using so it's not so rigid and elegant because it adapts to an increasingly modern era with a variety of templates.
I am not very good in terms of design, please advise the developers that I respect.
Added core update + patches
initial basic testing done.

PHP: 7.1.2
sqli:5.6.35

Next tests will be on the latest versions of php 7.2 & 7.3
Hello cibonfire,..
thank you very much to lonnieezell who has created new innovation cms with a modern and resilient concept.
I'm trying to develop your application for development purposes. when I saw the concept that bonfire presented, so interested and amazing. I tried to change and learn about the default bonfire module that is roles and permissions, how easy it is to understand and learn. thanks again lonnieezell ,.
Can I get additional information? regarding CI core updates and bootstrap updates. right now I'm using bonfire version 0.9.x which has a CI core system 3.1.9.
I hope to update myself to the latest version 3.
besides that I also still have problems with the menu display where I have tried to upgrade Bootstrap 2 to version 3.
Hi guys....
I have a strange problem with the installation that i explain to you:
I hava anapache server in my lan where i test my project. In this server i setting up a new site wich i'llwant to use to testing a my new project with bonfire.
When i setting the site, before unzip the source, i tested it with a simple index.html file and the site works fine, but when i try to put in directory the source don't work, and the browser tell me err:name_not_resolve.
If i delete all source and re-put the index.html, don't work.
I shold only delete ALL configuration in apache and all directory and restart from begin.

Is there anyone that had this problem?

Thanks a lot

Sorry for my bad english... ;)

Is it possible to build only Public Contexts?

really?
How can you integrate less compiler? Or it will be added in future releases? Thanks.
I have been testing to get a good file uploader coded with the ability to change the Upload Destination using a Form Select Input and a MySQL Script, but I can't even find a good example for a File Uploader to start off with.

Can anyone provide a good example of a File Uploader for CI Bonfire?
