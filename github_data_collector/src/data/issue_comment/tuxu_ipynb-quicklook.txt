`nbviewer.js` started to implement LateX support : https://github.com/kokes/nbviewer.js/commit/1c0d7337c77da879329de4237ae5a68db3d30ece

I updated this repo with their master branch in hope you could release a new version of `nbviewer-app` on brew supporting LateX.

Cheers

I noticed that the extension doesn't work without internet access. Without internet it just shows a blank page.  
I'm not well versed in HTML, but it's obvious to me that the `template.html` file relies on external resources from buttflare servers:

https://github.com/tuxu/ipynb-quicklook/blob/c4530175579847e313a80e2da03a67970cc30fd8/ipynb-quicklook/template.html#L5-L8

This seems like a big design flaw, for multiple reasons:
- Obviously, quicklook shouldn't need an internet connection to display offline content
- even though Buttflare is incredibly reliable, relying on an external source introduces another point of failure
- and most importantly, it doesn't allow the user to use a custom local stylesheet

Is there a way to include the files locally?
I could be wrong, but theoretically it should be possible to put them in the same directory as the html, and then include them via relative paths. I tried many different pieces of advice I found on various forums on this topic, such as

`src='file:///{filename}.'`
`src='../{filename}'`
`src='{filename}'`
`src='assets/{filename}`,

where `{filename}` stands for the filename and `assets` is a folder. But none worked.

My ugly solution: Including the Javascript code inline inside the `<script></script>`tags. 
it works, but it's ugly and lack modularity.
I'd appreciate any input, even if it's just a hint, how to to it with `src` attributes.

And even this "solution" leaves me with the problem how to include a local CSS stylesheet. From what I read, it should be possible to do, although I'm afraid this is beyond my rudimentary HTML knowledge.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
### Idea for enhancing the documentation in README.md:

You might want to mention in https://github.com/tuxu/ipynb-quicklook#getting-started that if the user copies to his local ~/Library/QuickLook/ instead of the global folder /Library/QuickLook, that then nothing will work.

I stumbled over this, as I normally prefer to install in my local user's folder.
Anything I could do?
Would it be possible to add MathJax to the code so that Latex equations appear instead of the $...$ in the quicklook view? Or something more difficult is needed to add Latex support? It is just a question. Thanks.
