hi,@csjcai,I want to retrain the LP_KPN model.but the data type is HDF5. but the HR data have differnet size.How could I get those data?
 I run the demo.m and get the same resolution HR-LR pairs. i saw the version 3 is different resolution pairs .  is it just use the reshape function in matlab streightly or change the matlab code ?  thank you for answering.

But when I used the pre-trained model in the iphone7 image data. the inference result is bad.
