This Altair tutorial is easily the most comprehensive one I have ever seen, and such a great primer for beginners like me. However, there is a tricky task in one of those notebooks which I'm running into

> Putting into action what we've learned so far: can you modify the movie scatter plot above (the one with the dynamic query over years) to include a rule mark that shows the average IMDB (or Rotten Tomatoes) rating for the data contained within the year interval selection?

Here's my approach to the problem:
```python
brush = alt.selection_interval(
    encodings=['x'] # limit selection to x-axis (year) values
)

# dynamic query histogram
years = alt.Chart(movies).mark_bar().add_selection(
    brush
).encode(
    alt.X('year(Release_Date):T', title='Films by Release Year'),
    alt.Y('count():Q', title=None)
).properties(
    width=650,
    height=50
)

# scatter plot, modify opacity based on selection
ratings = alt.Chart(movies).mark_circle().encode(
    x='Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q',
    y='IMDB_Rating:Q',
    tooltip='Title:N',
    opacity=alt.condition(brush, alt.value(0.75), alt.value(0.05))
).properties(
    width=650,
    height=400
)

ratings_mean = alt.Chart(movies).mark_rule(color='#aaa').encode(
    y='mean(IMDB_Rating):Q'
).transform_filter(
    brush
)

alt.vconcat(years, ratings+ratings_mean).properties(spacing=5)
```

which throws me `Javascript Error: Undefined data set name: "concat_1_layer_1_main"`.

Since the error does not have any traceback, I have no idea how to troubleshoot and get stuck. Could you please help me with that?
Hi,
I took the freedom to add those great Notebooks to Nextjournal!
It has a nice way to publish notebooks and remembers all installed software, so all notebooks "just run" ;) 
If you already have an account, I can also transfer the ownership of those notebooks to you!

Best,
Simon

The current example in the notebook doesn't make it clear which variable is which mark

(It's ok for people who follow the tutorial as they created it themselves, but once  they copy this example to create charts and share with other audience, it would be confusing.)
