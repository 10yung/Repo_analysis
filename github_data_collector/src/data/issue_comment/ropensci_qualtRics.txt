Along the same lines as issue #116 and #35, is it possible to include question labels as the primary labels for the tibbles when importing from `fetch_survey()` and `read_survey()`? Currently, they are listed as secondary labels, but they cannot be used to refer to the appropriate columns (e.g, `select()` cannot find columns based on the question labels). 
I have used `colnames(datafile) <- sjlabelled::get_label(datafile)` as a workaround, but it would be nice to have the option at import to use question labels as column names. This is especially useful when researchers have added labels in Qualtrics, so the labels rather than the questions are included.
Hi,

I have enjoyed working with ```qualtRics``` and was glad to see that it's being updated! Thank you.

I'm working with Qualtrics' XM Directory, which adds another layer of [API documentation](https://api.qualtrics.com/docs/transactions-in-iq-directory) to access and edit XM Directory contacts and mailing lists. I've been able to use ```httr```, ```jsontlite``` and Qualtrics' API calls to do what I need to do, but I'm wondering if you plan on adding some XM Directory functions similar to what the Python library [```QualtricsAPI```](https://github.com/Jaseibert/QualtricsAPI/tree/master/QualtricsAPI/XM) has done?

I'd like to offer help in translating from the Python library if I can, but I've just started learning Python. Also, I'm learning GitHub. (I literally signed up to make this request.)

Thanks again for your efforts.
Users are starting to have various problems, such as those noted in #94 and #121, that I believe are related to being on the [v3 `responseexports` API](https://api.qualtrics.com/docs/response-exports).

Looks like it's time to bite the bullet and switch to the [new export API](https://api.qualtrics.com/docs/getting-survey-responses-via-the-new-export-apis). This will impact most functionality in this package. When we make this switch, I plan for this package to no longer support the older "Legacy" format.
For projects where you can't access the qualtrics API, it would be helpful to have a function that can read the qualtrics survey output. Although I think having API access is the gold standard here (and is my preference), this becomes a challenge if a project is hosted by another organization where getting an API key would also require getting credential for the hosting organization's system. 

**I'm proposing a function similiar to `read_survey()` in that it reads a downloaded .qsf file instead of downloading data from the API.**

In this case, the survey can be downloaded on the survey page as seen in the screenshot below. The result is downloading a .qsf file that is in JSON and has information about the survey (and can actually be loaded into qualtrics to import the survey).

If I generate some test responses in qualtrics and then immediately try to run fetch_survey, it does not import the new responses. This is the case even with 'force_request = TRUE'.

I found a clue on this page: https://www.qualtrics.com/community/discussion/1888/qualtrics-api-export-missing-latest-results
It suggests that the API can capture very recent data by setting an end_date value.

This also works for fetch_survey BUT it only works if a different end_date is used for each request. I.e., the following is what happens:
1. If I generate test responses in qualtrics then try fetch_survey, the new responses are not captured.
2. If I set an end_date value for fetch_survey with a value in the future, the new data is imported.
3. If then generate more test data in qualtrics and try again to import using fetch_data, it does not capture the new data. This is true even if I use the same end_data value as step #2.
4. If I try with a new, different end_data value then the fetch_survey command does work.
I assigned text responses to certain topics using the text tab in qualtrics. This field shows up under embedded data on the qualtrics site, but does not get imported into R after fetch_survey call. Is there a way to get this field to be included?
Look into using [vcr](https://github.com/ropensci/vcr) for testing API calls.
A new function could generate a Qualtrics survey from a list/vector/dataframe.
`survey_questions()` appears to only work for api pulls.  It would be great if it could also work either on a raw csv or on an object read in using `readSurvey()`.

Some of us don't have API access.
There is a new API to get survey responses, which pulls from a different "engine" and allows fixes to contact lists and embedded data to show up in results. Are there plans to update to using this new call?
