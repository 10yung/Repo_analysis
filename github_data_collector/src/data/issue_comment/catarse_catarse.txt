The instructions in the README file seem outdated. If anyone has been able to install and run Catarse from this repository with the latest changes please share the installation steps so that the file can be update the new instructions.

any guide on deploying catarse on AWS so that it can auto scale to handle traffic ?
Does anyone have an estimate for how much CPU power and memory does Catarse require? Thanks.
:catarse/mithril-postgrest is not a valid repository name.
@grpse preciso de algumas ajudinhas aqui:

1. Na linha 5, você sabe o motivo dessa variável? Não entendi como o boleto pode estar sem data.

2. Na linha 6, como eu faço para adicionar o link do projeto? Não soube como colocar isso na sequencia do nome.

3. Na linha 16, preciso colocar o link do boleto. Eu vi que está ali em cima, junto com a imagem do botão, mas não sabia como adicionar ao lado da frase.

4. Na linha 18, ficou faltando o link do histórico de apoios. Você sabe qual é?
Previous version of postgrest (0.3.0.3) does not support `limit` and `pagination` but we are using these parameters in new changes.
Also Ruby version is 2.4.4 in Gemfile, so corrected that as well.

> **Possible XSS vulnerability in Rack**
> There is a possible XSS vulnerability in Rack.  Carefully crafted requests can impact the data returned by the `scheme` method on `Rack::Request`. Applications that expect the scheme to be limited to "http" or "https" and do not escape the return value could be vulnerable to an XSS attack.
> 
> Vulnerable code looks something like this:
> 
> ```
> <%= request.scheme.html_safe %>
> ```
> 
> Note that applications using the normal escaping mechanisms provided by Rails may not impacted, but applications that bypass the escaping mechanisms, or do not use them may be vulnerable.
> 
> All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.

I'm not sure if there's a reason you're not accepting security update PRs, so I won't create any more on this repo (I don't want you to feel like I'm spamming you with fixes!). This vulnerability is kinda nasty, though, so I thought I'd port this last one across.
Hi everyone, 
I have setup this project, but having following issues:
1- I can't see user's email on user profile page
2- Left navbar does not appear on `/insights` page
3- User cannot publish the project

After some debugging, it turned out that the field `is_owner_or_admin` of views 
"1".project_details and  "1".user_details (and everywhere else)  always returns `null` unless we mark the field `admin` to True directly in the DB.

From couple of more findings, `is_owner_or_admin` is a function which returns True for 2 cases.
1- If user is admin (Marked as `admin` in user table)
2- If current_user_id() = given user_id where `current_user_id()` is picked from `current_setting('request.jwt.claim.user_id')`.

So, for non-admin users, `current_setting('request.jwt.claim.user_id')` always return `null` where it should return ID of logged-in requesting user.
I have setup DB `catarse_development` and also had to create `service_core` (which remains empty by the way).
In one step I had to create role `catarse` but I am never using it, not sure what is that for.

Am I missing some settings? Not sure if this is postgREST issue. 

Any help will be appreciated
