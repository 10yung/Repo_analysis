**Issue:** when the main timer (the black one) is set to more than 24 hours, the coundown timer (the red one) resets and starts counting up from 00:00 (see the screenshot). Even if this doesn't break the work of the timer, this is confusing.

**Suggestion:** remove the countdown timer's 24-hour display limit and let it display time intervals exceeding 24 hours, for example 32:24.

Can we have 12-hour mode with an AM/PM symbol? 

Perhaps a setting, which allows to toggle between 12hour/24hour mode 
I want to issue a command on the terminal like so `$ timer 10` and the timer starts or resets to 10 minutes. 
It took me a while to figure out what was going on in the view hierarchy, causing the clock to not get displayed on Mojave. Ideally I'd like to move to an approach that puts the clock in a more standard location in the view hierarchy that would be more robust to OS updates (such as `contentView`). But after experimenting for a while, I don't have any clear idea of how to do that while maintaining the visual design and behavior.

So instead I was able to adapt the approach for Mojave by simply making the clock view a sibling of the close button.

I also simplified a few lines of code and added comments.
Hey,

Anyone wants to add the possibility to choose the sound of the alarm? (A menu or preference would be enough).
Someone (Ralph, not sure if you want your full name here) sent me sounds he created and it's pretty sweet.

Hey @michaelvillar,

Would it be possible to build a new release for the changes since 1.4?

https://github.com/michaelvillar/timer-app/compare/1.4...master

If you're super busy, I'm willing to join the project and do basic stuff like making releases, keeping a changelog, and testing.
Hello guys, 
first of all... i love this app! Thank you!

I switched to Mojave on Monday, so I noticed this bug. As soon as the timer window is no longer active/focused, the "watchface" becomes transparent. But if I click on the timer window and make it to my active / current window, everything looks good again. Strange.

I found it's useful to use a timer for counting down before a calendar event (e.g. a meeting event).

One possible way to create a new timer is by accepting a calendar file (.ics) and create a new timer.

#22 suggests naming a time. This could be useful as well.
Don't know if this is a bug or feature but when I close a timer and don't quit the app, it doesn't invalidate the timer and the timer goes off.

If you can confirm this isn't a feature then I can try and implement a solution to this?
