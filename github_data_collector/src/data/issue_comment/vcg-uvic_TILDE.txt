First, I download the codes and unzip them to my C Drive. After that, I use CMake, VS2012, openCV 3.0 to generate the project. CMake Shows

OPENMP FOUND
OPENMP FOUND
Configuring done
Generating done 

Then I build ALL_BUILD, the project says "LNK1104 cannot open file '..\Lib\Debug\TILDE.lib'" and a lot of grammar errors due to my complier isn't compatible to C++11.

Then I immediately download VS2015 from Microsoft. and try to generate above project again by using above method again. VS only report "LNK1104 cannot open file '..\Lib\Debug\TILDE.lib'" and a lot of warnings.

I think the openCV in my desktop may be problematic. So I download openCV 2.4.11 from opencv.org and try use CMAKE to generate opencv Project. Jesus, I failed. I note that my graphic card is AMD, rather than NVIDIA. I cannot use CUDA. Then I generate the openCV project without CUDA. I succussed to build the Debug, win 32. In the following step, The TILDE project is generated by CMAKE, openCV 2.4.11, VS2015. But at last, I still get "LNK1104 cannot open file '..\Lib\Debug\TILDE.lib'".

I don't know which step of my above method is wrong?
Could anyone tell me how to run this example correctly. I am a beginner in openCV, Visual Studio and C++. All my previous work is done in matlab. It really make me crazy.

Thank you for reading. Please help me.
