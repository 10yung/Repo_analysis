Every time I open a powershell window I get this error:

Import-Module : The specified module 'posh-docker' was not loaded because no valid module file was found in any module directory.

Any thoughts on how to make it go away?

Hey @samneirinck, I know a lot of docker users that would love this updated to current CLI commands and sub-commands, options, etc.

Maybe we Docker Captains can help spread the word and get you some help with fixes and new features, but I have two questions first:

1. Are you still willing to lead this repo by accepting PR's, commenting on issues, etc? It would be great if we could use the same PowerShell Module name and repo.

2. Can you describe a list of issues or needed features to get it working with old and new command format and options?

Apparently, there is a conflict between these two modules. After installing TabExpansionPlusPlus, posh-docker stopped working. Removing `Import-Module TabExpansionPlusPlus` directive from PowerShell profile fixes the issue. Order of import of TabExpansionPlusPlus and posh-docker doesn't affect the problem.
Great extension and I love it! The README outlines that options would be tab completable but I'm not able to get it to work.

Docker commands like start, stop etc auto complets like a charm but I'm not able to get the respective options to auto complete. 

e.g. When I type `docker start --att`, and press `tab` key I should see `docker start --attach` but it isn't.

I'm running powershell 5 on Windows 10 ,but I've also tested this on Windows Server 2016 and also no love :(
Hi @samneirinck,

**It would very convenient if `ConvertFrom-Docker` were in a separate module.**

I am authoring a module, [DockerHelpers](https://github.com/christianacca/DockerHelpers), where I would like to take a dependency on `posh-docker` but can't as explained below.

`DockerHelpers` module uses `ConvertFrom-Docker` for some of it's implementation. But `DockerHelpers` should not add tab completion to the powershell console.

So currently I'm copying `ConvertFrom-Docker`  into `DockerHelpers` module - not ideal for a number of reasons.

**Alternatively, I'd be very happy for `ConvertFrom-Docker`  to be contributed to [DockerHelpers](https://github.com/christianacca/DockerHelpers).** Obviously that would mean `posh-docker` taking an external dependency. However, powershell `Install/Import` commands would make that transparent to the consumer of `posh-docker`.

If you were willing to contribute then I'd make you a contributor to [DockerHelpers](https://github.com/christianacca/DockerHelpers) so that you can modify the sources.

Thanks
Christian


This really sucks for Using where object against
Support for the `docker-compose` command would be great.
Add tests to check if new functionality doesn't break older docker versions
The Docker client now has a new structure with sub commands.

For example:
```
docker container --help
docker container run ...
```

```
docker image --help
docker image ls
```

How can posh-docker be enhanced to support tab completion for these sub commands as well?
