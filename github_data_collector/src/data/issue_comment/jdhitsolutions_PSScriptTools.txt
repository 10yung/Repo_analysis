Need to better handle WPF-related commands that now work in PowerShell 7 Preview 3 on Windows.
Update `New-PSFormatXML`  to support Wide formats. This may need to be a separate parameter set.
Hi,

Is there anyway to pass in custom template to ConvertTo-Markdown? 

One of the issues is that main content goes in "pre" tag and you cannot have links in there.

Thanks.
In `ConvertTo-WPFGrid` when manually clicking Refresh I am using the title bar to indicate a refresh is underway. I also change the cursor. What I would really like to do is change the text in the status bar.  I've tried all sorts of ways with dispatchers and thread tricks with limited success. I'm reaching the limit of what I know about WPF. Open to suggestions and tips.

Starting in v2.0.0 `ConvertTo-WPFGrid` now lives in a separate runspace to avoid blocking the PowerShell prompt. I'd love to find a way to automatically remove the runspace when the form is closed.
