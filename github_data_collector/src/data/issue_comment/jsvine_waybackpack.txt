I guess waybackpack shouldn't try to parse error pages as JSONâ€¦
Currently if you try to save a resource with the template of:

www.site.com/news?385

It will save it as merely "news" instead of something like news@385 (like what wget does).

I looked through the code and couldn't find the part that is handling the url query, but if one is saving a large amounts of files in that format, it becomes less userfriendly to simply have a thousand files labeled  "news".

Awesome program by the way.
Hey-lo,

I'm building a version of `waybackpack` using [`conda`](http://conda.pydata.org/) for [conda-forge](http://conda-forge.github.io/). When possible, we try to include a link to the license file in the `meta.yaml` specification for the build; doing so requires the license be indexed in an explicit [`MANIFEST.in`](https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/sourcedist.html#manifest-related-options) file so that it gets included in the source distribution.

This pull adds a `MANIFEST.in` that should guarantee that both the license and the readme get included.
This PR enables wildcard url fetches from wayback machine.

Add a param to download whole site with assets, not just pages
(as of right now it only captures html page of the site)
