my code

 nvc.leftSide = true
        nvc.menuWidth = round(UIScreen.main.bounds.width * 0.78)
        nvc.presentationStyle = .menuSlideIn
        nvc.statusBarEndAlpha = 0
        


was trying that:


     extension SideMenuPresentationStyle {
    static var menuSlideInCustom: SideMenuPresentationStyle {
        let item = SideMenuPresentationStyle.init()
        item.menuOnTop = true
        item.menuTranslateFactor = -1
        item.onTopShadowColor = UIColor(red: 0.024, green: 0.075, blue: 0.176, alpha: 1)
        item.onTopShadowOpacity = 0.6
        return item
    }
}


but do not have any change for color. color is clear...
**Describe the bug**
I added SideMenu to a new project and set up some customizations. Basically, my main UIViewController has a (mostly) white background, and so does SideMenu. When the SideMenu is shown, I want the main UIViewController to be blacked out (.5 opacity). However, there is a thin hairline visible between the UIViewController and the SideMenu that is caused by `presentationStyle.backgroundColor`.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
```
let leftMenuNavigationController = SideMenuNavigationController(rootViewController: SideMenuController())
SideMenuManager.default.leftMenuNavigationController = leftMenuNavigationController        
SideMenuManager.default.leftMenuNavigationController?.presentationStyle = .viewSlideOutMenuIn
SideMenuManager.default.leftMenuNavigationController?.presentationStyle.onTopShadowRadius = 0
SideMenuManager.default.leftMenuNavigationController?.presentationStyle.onTopShadowOpacity = 0
SideMenuManager.default.leftMenuNavigationController?.presentationStyle.onTopShadowOffset = .zero
SideMenuManager.default.leftMenuNavigationController?.presentationStyle.onTopShadowColor = UIColor.clear
SideMenuManager.default.leftMenuNavigationController?.presentationStyle.backgroundColor = UIColor.black
SideMenuManager.default.leftMenuNavigationController?.presentationStyle.presentingEndAlpha = 0.5
leftMenuNavigationController.menuWidth = UIScreen.main.bounds.width - 200
leftMenuNavigationController.statusBarEndAlpha = 0
```

**Expected behavior**
I would like the shadow/hairline border to disappear.

## Issue Description
I'm currently trying to setup the Sidemenu in my new App. 

I've tried to implement it by using the the Example-Project as reference. But the the Swipe-In of the Menu isn't working. I'm feeling pretty helpless at the moment because it's working in the example-App but not in my project and I can't find the problem in my Code. 

My implementation looks like this:

``` swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        self.collectionView!.register(UICollectionViewCell.self, forCellWithReuseIdentifier: reuseIdentifier)
        setupSideMenu()
    }
    
    private func setupSideMenu() {
        SideMenuManager.default.leftMenuNavigationController = storyboard?.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "LeftMenuNavigationController") as? SideMenuNavigationController
        
        SideMenuManager.default.addPanGestureToPresent(toView: navigationController!.navigationBar)
        SideMenuManager.default.addScreenEdgePanGesturesToPresent(toView: view)
    }
```

The goal is to implement it into an UICollectionViewController, but I don't think that this should do any trouble with the Side Menu implementation since this is also an ViewController...

My Configuration of the SideMenuNavigationController looks like this:

I'm really confused because, as far as I see, I do everything like it's documented in the Readme..

I would be really glad if anyone could help me.

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
I am trying to push the same viewController more than one because I want to reuse it but allowPushOfSameClassTwice true/false does not make any difference in the behaviour. 


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

A side menu with items linking to the same view controller always displays the current VC content.


**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
It should create a new viewcontroller on each menu item click.

I am facing the same issue for ios12 and iOS 13 as well, using latest pods. Following lines of code that I have used for showing the slide menu using slide gesture 

`   let mainStoryboard = UIStoryboard(name: Constant.StoryBoardIdentifier.main, bundle: nil)
        if let controller = mainStoryboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "MenuViewController") as? MenuViewController {
            if SideMenuManager.default.rightMenuNavigationController == nil {
                let rightMenuNavigationController = SideMenuNavigationController(rootViewController: controller)
                SideMenuManager.default.rightMenuNavigationController = rightMenuNavigationController
                rightMenuNavigationController.statusBarEndAlpha = 0
                rightMenuNavigationController.menuWidth = min(view.frame.width, view.frame.height) * CGFloat(0.75)
                rightMenuNavigationController.presentDuration = 0.0
                SideMenuManager.default.addScreenEdgePanGesturesToPresent(toView: view)
                }
        }`

When we open menu using gesture

after closing the slider menu

**Describe the bug**
The bug is Keyboard Hides when sidemenu appears but after closing side menu keyboard appears again. normally this thing does not cause any problem at all. but the only big problem occurs while going to other view from side menu. more explaination in "To Reproduce".

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. click on search bar so keyboard will appear.
2. than go to side menu using screen edge pan gesture.
3. from there go to another view by clicking any button in side menu.
4. now on this new view controller you will find a black rectangle at the place of keyboard.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
