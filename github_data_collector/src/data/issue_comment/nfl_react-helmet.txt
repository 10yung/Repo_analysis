Specifically this upgrade is done to pick up this change https://github.com/gaearon/react-side-effect/pull/58 which renamed `componentWillMount` to `UNSAFE_componentWillMount`. A (very large) deprecation warning is logged in the console otherwise - see the `Note` section here https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#unsafe_componentwillmount.
I'm using gatsbyjs which by default brings Helmet installed. I would like to add some more content to my <head>, in this case just a comment with a ref id. Would it be possible without any property of helmet tag for additional content? I'm missing something like a headAdditional property that takes a string and put it in the head exactly as it was written

**What is the current behavior?**
Hey buddies, everything works fine, the head tags updates correctly except that the React warns that componentWillMount is obsolete.
See https://fb.me/react-unsafe-component-lifecycles for details.

![react-warning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49484425/71630848-9f762480-2c05-11ea-9321-f3276689f3e2.png)

**How did I know this caused the warning?**
Well, when I remove/disconnect the <Helmet/> from my App.js, the warning disappears.

**Suggested fix according to the console message**
- Move code with side effects to componentDidMount, and set initial state in the constructor.
- Rename componentWillMount to UNSAFE_componentWillMount to suppress this warning in non-strict mode. In React 17.x, only the UNSAFE_ name will work. To rename all deprecated lifecycles to their new names, you can run `npx react-codemod rename-unsafe-lifecycles` in your project source folder.

Please update the following components: SideEffect(NullComponent)

**Which versions of React and react-helmet, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**
Bug: currently the version of `react-side-effect` that's currently used is causing deprecated warnings to be thrown in `react@16` due to its usage of `componentWillMount`.

**What is the current behavior?**
When mounting components in a `react@16` or above environment, deprecated warnings are thrown.

**If the current behavior is a bug, 
please provide the steps to reproduce and if 
possible a minimal demo of the problem. 
Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your 
code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React and react-helmet. 
Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or 
CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**
Use `Helmet` in a `react@16` environment or above.

**What is the expected behavior?**
Warnings are not thrown.

React@16+

**What is the current behavior?**
I am using the peek function to test that a stylet ag is added to the document head, but I am getting a type error as `styleTag` does not exist in the HelmetData interface.

**What is the expected behavior?**
It should allow me to destructure the `styleTag` property without getting any ts warnings when using the peek function so as to check style tags added to the document head.
Please extend HelmetTags in the HelmetData interface.

I am using 5.0.8 but the issue persists in the latest as well.
I have implemented a third party widget on my website to get Rich Snippets stars. The issue is that the Google-bot and Google structured-data testing-tool do not recognise the ld+json markup because it's outside the html tag. i have used React Helmet to force the script inside the head tag but in vain!

Hello,

I am using ReactJS for my front-end pages (public pages) using Create React Application (CRA) method. 

To have SEO-Friendly web app, I would like to have a meta title and description page wise. To achieve this, I have already installed below NPM (react-helmet) which makes console data dynamic BUT the dynamic data is NOT displaying as expected for source code.
**NPM** : https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet

**Question**: Is there any way to have a dynamic meta title and description (page-wise) using a react-helmet and CSR based ReactJS app? 

**NOTE**: At the moment, I am not looking to convert into SSR using expressJS or NextJS.
Folks, the community needs this to be merged AND released:
https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet/pull/472

that easy as a dependency update. I see the implications, and that might be done in a breaking major release. Then do it, or update the 6.0.0beta that is one year old (I guess stale because of something).

and most probably it will need this to make travis work again.:
https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet/pull/473

If you can't maintain the project anymore, try to find someone who can. I guess there will be plenty of volunteers.
Unfortunately, React Helmet simply does not provide good compatibility with opengraph data.

We inherited a project which uses React and React.Helment extensively, and although the head updates - this is a virtualised DOM update. Facebook and Twitter can not crawl the opengraph meta provided.

I have added the following to the React Render function:

`<Helmet>
          <title itemProp="name" lang="en">Welcome! | Chenja</title>
          <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary" />
          <meta name="twitter:site" content="@<twitter_handle>" />
          <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@<twitter_handle>" />
          <meta property="og:url" content={ window.location } />
          <meta property="og:type" content="article" />
          <meta property="og:title" content="Artwork Share | Chenja" />
          <meta property="og:description" content={ this.props.artwork.description } />
          <meta property="og:image" content={ this.props.artwork.image.src } />
</Helmet>`

And then using Twitter's card debugging tool, we get the following issue:

INFO:  Page fetched successfully
INFO:  7 metatags were found
ERROR: No card found (Card error)
