Some applications can only use https proxy, is there anything that can be done?
It's happened when I try to update MATLAB R2018b into update 5 using this command

> C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2018b\bin\win64>update_installer.exe -updatepack "X:\x\R2018b\"

After that, there are two connection error on the dispatch log, but haven't crashed yet.

```
C:\WINDOWS\system32>dispatch start --debug

```

The MATLAB window that was supposed to show the update installer throwing an error

After I closed the window, the dispatch process crashed, here is the cmd log

```

      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
      ^

Error: read ECONNRESET

Here is the correct MATLAB update window.

Here is my system proxy settings

While it is not a crucial bug because I could still successfully update without any problem by turning off my proxy, but still, I would like to report it here.
Hi,
I'm testing dispatch-proxy with Xubuntu 16.04.5 LTS on my pc with "eno1" and "wlx..." interfaces.
I have three problem:

1 - the wlx interface doing nothing and blocking the entire process. I'm using firefox with 127.0.0.2 8081 on proxy (only http proxy). Output:
dispatch start -H 127.0.0.2 -p 8081 --debug --http
_HTTP server started on 127.0.0.2:8081
Dispatching to addresses 192.168.1.154@1, 192.168.2.152@1
   request [49c52e] http://www.pubbliaccesso.gov.it/logo/elenco.php
  dispatch [49c52e] 192.168.1.154
       end [49c52e] clientRequest
  response [49c52e] 200
   request [83d6de] http://www.pubbliaccesso.gov.it/layout/stili/logo.css
  dispatch [83d6de] 192.168.2.152
       end [83d6de] clientRequest_
... after long time
     error [83d6de] clientRequest
           Error: connect ETIMEDOUT 93.147.186.151:80
               at Object.exports._errnoException (util.js:870:11)
               at exports._exceptionWithHostPort (util.js:893:20)
               at TCPConnectWrap.afterConnect [as oncomplete] (net.js:1063:14)

The wlx interface works because I use it daily.

2 - the https connections are not available with single or both connections. Firefox with full proxy protocols configuration:
Browser: https://www.google.it _Secure connection failed_

3 - error socks
           Unsupported SOCKS version: 71

- Add script to build ES6 with babel
- Import module os and list network interfaces
Since I see there is a new collaborator I will post this idea here. I've been using a service called Speedify recently and it seems to balance the load between my two connections depending on the bandwidth of the connections. 

Basically, my idea is instead of setting how many times you want dispatch-proxy to use a connection out of the total (by using: `10.0.0.0@7 10.0.0.1@3`), dispatch-proxy will update those values at runtime depending on how fast each connection is (a faster connections proportional use would increase proportionally to its bandwidth / the total bandwidth, and slower connections proportional use would decrease). This would improve the quality of the overall connection since you would use "more" of the fast connection and "less" of the smaller connection. 

Don't hesitate to ask if I wasn't clear at some point.

Hello Alexandre!

I'm a computer science student at Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden and want to make something awesome in the summer break. I love this proxy tool and want to contribute. Can you add me as collaborator in this project so that I can close issues and confirm merge requests? Of course I will carefully test the code before doing any merges. It would be great if we can collaborate together and make this project even better! Feel free to tell me what you think.

Sincerely,
Roderick
I am using two wireless adapters to combine their speed for torrent client. I have tried everything with the limited knowledge i have and i have found no solution. I am using Windows 10 x64, Vuze and when Vuze starts it has a Green (Ok) proxy circle and then it becomes Yellow and the command prompt in which dispatch is running stops with the 'event.js:112 throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event' error. If i try to run it again same thing happens. I hope you can tell me what should i check or what i might be doing wrong. Here is a screenshot. I have been trying to combine two connections and even when i bind interface or ip in vuze the speed is same (like it's using just one connection somehow) I would be very thankful if you tell me a way to combine two wifi connections for better downloading speed on a torrent client. You can email me at fang_proxy@yahoo.com for any suggestions.

Hi there 
while I was trying to connect to the Internet with dispatch Proxy I received this message from the browser:
"No connection can be established with the Proxy Server"
Can you help me?
Tim 
I have multiple connections which all requires a proxy.I want to combine them through dispatch and a proxy on top of dispatch so that all traffic would pass through the required proxy.
So I have Dispatch-Proxy setup and working with the Socks configuration for my system as well as my browsers. When I look at the debug output I'm seeing ECONNRESET errors about every 20 seconds or so.
Example:
```
dispatch [16cef6] 192.168.0.103
   connect [16cef6] clients4.google.com:443
       end [537276] clientConnection
       end [407d50] clientConnection
       end [73013b] clientConnection
     error [537276] serverConnection
           Error: read ECONNRESET
               at exports._errnoException (util.js:1022:11)
               at TCP.onread (net.js:569:26)
     error [407d50] serverConnection
           Error: read ECONNRESET
               at exports._errnoException (util.js:1022:11)
               at TCP.onread (net.js:569:26)
       end [73013b] serverConnection
   request [c794d6] stats-public.grammarly.io:443
  dispatch [c794d6] 192.168.0.103
   connect [c794d6] stats-public.grammarly.io:443
       end [c794d6] serverConnection
       end [c794d6] clientConnection
```
And then on some rare occasions I see it come out like this...
```
    error [f689dd] clientConnection
           Error: write ECONNABORTED
               at exports._errnoException (util.js:1022:11)

               at Socket.emit (events.js:188:7)
```
It doesn't seem to matter whether I'm browsing or watching YouTube or downloading. The errors come at a rather consistant rate. they don't **seem** to be affecting performance, but I thought I'd leave some feedback in case it would be helpfull. Let me know if there's any more I can do.
