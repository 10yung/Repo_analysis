Problem: Given a sequence, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in it.
As another example, if the given sequence is “BBABCBCAB”, then the output should be 7 as “BABCBAB” is the longest palindromic subseuqnce in it. “BBBBB” and “BBCBB” are also palindromic subsequences of the given sequence, but not the longest ones.

It would be helpful for you to add Karatsuba as it is used to get fastest multiplication.
