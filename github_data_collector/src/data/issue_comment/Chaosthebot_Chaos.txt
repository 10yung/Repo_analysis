Just reviewed a couple of my PRs on various open source problems, most of which didn't get any comment/attention from the project maintainers. This made me think about Chaosbot again, and I think that many OS projects can really benefit from giving contributers some more influence over merging PRs/managing issues, etc.

We already had a nice thing going on, what if we try to move it towards a SaaS solution aimed at helping out OS projects on Github, maybe even publishing it at the GH marketplace if we're successful?

We'd need to have a good functional design first, and this project should then really aim at creating a finished/usable product instead of having more of a focus on being an experiment.

Just a thought... maybe with some combined development time we can actually make something useful!

Here's an idea: since it seems that chaosbot has completely fizzled out, I propose we make an Ethereum contract chaosbot with the ability to update itself. 
It's easy to implement using https://github.com/probot/settings .
Is there any backup of the code that was uploaded first? I would like to have the `original` ChaosBot on my private git server
Hi. I have tried to see this project a few times, but I always get a 502. Have I been unlucky or is this expected and I should just clone and try to run it locally?

thanks.
Now that Chaosbot V1 is dead, I thought I would upload a Gource animation.

I'm not experienced in node.js, so I was hoping to learn from some of you.  Any node.js guys want to create a new repo and put down some scaffolding?
Currently, members of the org have permissions to delete/edit stuff, but not to block users. Is this what we want?

I'm creating this issue mostly to get discussion away from #559. Since I don't think this is important, I'll be unsubscribing from this thread, so if you need me please mention me.
yay, nay?  If we go to a full docker deployment, I guess it doesn't matter too much either way.
