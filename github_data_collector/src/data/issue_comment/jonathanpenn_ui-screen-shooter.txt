I have not tested this but there should be a way to control the remote. 

Is it possible to run ui-screen-shooter on iPhone device? not on simulator?
my output: 
Running automation script "./config-automation.js"
          for "iPhone (8.3)"

I have a SpriteKit project which uses texture atlasses. (Xcode 6.2, Mavericks 10.9.5) These are directories named like "Shield.atlas" and they contain a few image file. When the project is built by Xcode, it "compiles" these directories and the result is a "Shield.atlasc" in the built app which contains a single png file and a plist file describing the location of the individual textures in the new png file. The build log in Xcode shows, that this tool is used:

`/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Tools/../usr/bin/TextureAtlas`

In the output of the screen shooter script it shows:

```
CpResource path/to/Shield.atlas /tmp/screen_shooter/app.app/Shield.atlas
    cd /path/to/my/project
    export PATH="my path environment"
    builtin-copy -exclude .DS_Store -exclude CVS -exclude .svn -exclude .git -exclude .hg -resolve-src-symlinks /path/to/Shield.atlas /tmp/screen_shooter/app.app
```

So I assume that somewhere .atlas resources must be handled special. 

Is this something which needs to fixed in my project, or in ui-screen-shooter?

(I do not yet know all the features of Xcode and I may miss some simple setting somewhere which may solve that already.)

There is a problem with the landscape mode. The resolution in rect is not exactly 568.0 etc. Sometimes it's something like 568.0000000235217. Thus the function rectMaxSizeMatchesPhoneWithMaxDimensionForOrientation returns the wrong value.

Replacing the old rectMaxSizeMatchesPhoneWithMaxDimensionForOrientation with

function rectMaxSizeMatchesPhoneWithMaxDimensionForOrientation(rect, maxDimension, orientation) {
  return (orientation == kPortraitString && rect.size.height.toFixed() == maxDimension) || (orientation == kLandscapeString && rect.size.width.toFixed() == maxDimension)
}

fixes this bug.

Maybe I don't have something configured correctly, but I couldn't get ui-screen-shooter to build my app with a Today Extension in it.

I found a way around it here but I don't think this is the best solution:

Any suggestions?

iTunes Connect no longer allows any image with an alpha channel. Sips doesn't remove alpha channels, something like imagemagick would work. Could possibly speed up workflow if put together, but who knows üòÅ
Sort of feature request, sort of bug.

I copied 

```
capture.js
config-automation.js
config-screenshots.sh
ui-screen-shooter.sh
unix_instruments.sh
```

To root project folder, try to run `./ui-screen-shooter.sh`

And after cleaning got error (only for the first run): **./ui-screen-shooter.sh: line 103: 45211 Bus error: 10**

```

And all next attempts to run got another error: **./ui-screen-shooter.sh: line 103: 51123 Segmentation fault: 11**

```

Can't figure out what cause this error. (With your example all works fine)

I worked with that amazing script and recognized two things:

The close sim function does not work:
Simulator application name is "iOS Simulator", not "iPhone Simulator" 
function _close_sim {
  # I know, I know. It says "iPhone Simulator". For some reason,
  # that's the only way Applescript can identify it.
  osascript -e "tell application \"iOS Simulator\" to quit"
}

I had to delete the app from the simulator to get the new code version in UIAutomation so i reset all simulators before the "_xcode clean build" call by calling my "_reset_all_sim" function:
function _reset_all_sim {
  instruments -s devices \
   | grep Simulator \
   | grep -o "[0-9A-F]{8}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{12}" \
   | while read -r line ; do
      echo "Reseting Simulator with UDID: $line"
      xcrun simctl erase $line
  done
}

Attention: If a simulator is running it will not be cleaned. I recommend to call "_close_sim" before "_reset_all_sim" to ensure all simulators are getting cleared.

Doesn't work with cordova/phonegap, libCordova.a problem. Just created a default project:

```
cordova create test
cd test
cordova platform add ios
```

Running your script results in:

```
Release-iphonesimulator/HelloCordova.build/Objects-normal/x86_64/app
ld: file not found: /tmp/screen_shooter/libCordova.a
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)

** BUILD FAILED **


The following build commands failed:
    Ld build/HelloCordova.build/Release-iphonesimulator/HelloCordova.build/Objects-normal/i386/app normal i386
    Ld build/HelloCordova.build/Release-iphonesimulator/HelloCordova.build/Objects-normal/x86_64/app normal x86_64
```

Any chance to get this fixed?

Thanks!
