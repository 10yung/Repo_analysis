yeah, so one part's in grey as ignored, the other in normal blue
or maybe we're talking about different things, i don't know for sure
actually no, not overlap. What I'm saying is that let's say you have half a page as ignored, and then you'd like to create another pagemark to point below, on the same page, but this time in normal mode. Polar creates the pagemark, joins the new one with the old, and reverts the mode of the old one to normal
i hope this is clearer```
**Describe the bug**
Everytime I start the application, when the main view with the list is loaded, I receive an error message at the top right corner, stating:
"[error] [1.90.0] Error: Mailchimp failed request: 500:". In the development tools, I can see the following:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 ()
https://us-central1-polar-cors.cloudfunctions.net/mailinglist/
/snap/polar-bookshelf/82/resources/app.asar/node_modules/polar-shared/src/logger/ConsoleLogger.js:26
```
```
[error] [1.90.0] Error: Mailchimp failed request: 500: 
error @ /snap/polar-bookshelf/82/resources/app.asar/node_modules/polar-shared/src/logger/ConsoleLogger.js:26
```


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Start the application
2. See the error

**Expected behavior**
No error should occur.

**Screenshots**
Not needed

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Ubuntu 18.04

**Additional context**
This is a fresh ubuntu install with a new snap install. It also happened at my old installation with I believe the .deb package. Therefore, I would think that it has something to do with my account specifically. I've also had this error appear in various networks and locations, so it shouldn't be related to any specific network settings like firewall.

This improves performance and reduces disk space but not sure if we've enabled it by default yet.

I need to figure out how to activate/deactivate it properly though.
