Some of the labels and markers information from the figures is lost after using epsclean.m . Ex: text box, markers etc. I am using Matlab version 2017a. Can you please help. The below images illustrate the issue. Figure on the top is epsclean output, whereas the second one is expected output.

I installed Matlab 2017b, and found the script will remove some colored areas.  For example,

Code:
```
contourf(peaks(100));saveas(gcf,'figure.eps','epsc')
epsclean('figure.eps','figure_clean.eps','GroupSoft',true,'combineAreas',true,'removeboxes',true)
```
Generates the following (I converted from eps to pdf for this preview):

Do you have any idea? Thank you for making this tool, regardless!
This project is a great service to the community. Thanks! I am attaching an example where epsclean removes most, but not all of the artifacts. The original file is fig1.eps and the cleaned version is fig1c.eps (attached inside a zip-file). I have also attached the pdfs (created by Preview on a mac). I tried the four different combinations of true/false for the optional epsclean arguments and they all showed the same behavior. Thanks for your help. -Matt
