Conversations (and others) will very soon start sending 12 byte IVs for both OMEMO messages as well as the aesgcm:// uri scheme in order to better support libraries on other plattforms that only accept 12 bytes.
Hi, i didn't have a ios device, but my colleague wants to give me the ownership for a channel, but he can only make me a admin.

How can he give me the ownership?

I found error will running : git submodule update --init --recursive

I get new message alerts, but the messages are not showing up in the chat screen.  So I can only chat with people I send a message to first.  I can see it in the logs of the server that it was sent.  I switch to a different client and I get messages.  How can I fix this?

Version: 4.3.9 (14.3)
I am using the newest version of Chatsecure from the app store on an Iphone Xs.
I read about all local data being encrypted with SQLCipher, however, I can't find a way to enable this and set a password
It would greatly improve the security and privacy one could achieve with a custom server if Chatsecure-iOS would add support for authenticated hidden services (TOR) to it's current application. 

This would be as easy as making it possible to change the "HidServAuth" variable in the TOR configuration file (torrc), by the means of a simple UI textbox, for example located under advanced settings.

Authenticated hidden services (which run an XMPP sever) could the be accessed by Chatsecure-iOS clients which have the corresponding key/cookie written in their torrc file!
Hello Everyone,

We are getting crash for 'JSQMessagesViewController' in chatsecure but as we know it is officially deprecated and updates are not available - https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/officially-deprecating-jsqmessagesviewcontroller/

My question is what alternative chatsecure - iOS is using for this?

Thanks
