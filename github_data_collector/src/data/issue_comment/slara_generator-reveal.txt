When doing `yo reveal:slide "4.DAG" --markdown`, it fails with the following error:

```javascript

If I change the command to `yo reveal:slide "DAG" --markdown`, it works. Seems like the `4.` in the title blows things up. Weirdly enough, I was unable to reproduce this in a test, so I can't submit a PR with neither a fix nor a failing test. Sorry ðŸ˜• .

Ideas what might be causing this?
It would be nice to have the same semantics as in the reveal.js repository.
Although nested slides are also named vertical slides in the reveal.js repository, they are described as "nested slides" in the demo and in the first line of their README.md
I'd like a feature where I can pass an index as a param that inserts the slide in the json manifest. Even better would be supporting something like `1:1, 1:2` for inserting vertical slides.
This could even be used as a cool `readme` type thing, but for now it would simply be cool to show off what you can do with this `generator`.
