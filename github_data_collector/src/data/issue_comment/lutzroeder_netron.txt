Would it be possible to add a feature were I could add/remove/change node on graph
and then export new modified graph? 
Say with ONNX protocol.

PyTorch models can be saved in TorchScript format as well. (Details about TorchScript models: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html#torchscript) 

Can we add the support for TorchScript models?

The serialization details can be found here: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/caffe2/serialize/inline_container.h#L21

So far, the major problem is that, in the zip file, no graph is saved, instead script is saved. You may want to call some utility function to generate the IR to get the graph.


Is there roadmap for supporting operators of loop type:
For example:
 ONNX Loop
Caffe2 ONNXWhile

I failed to load 2.1 MB .meta file generated from char-rnn model (https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow) with python 2.7 and tensorflow 1.0.

It is loading forever... I am wondering what is wrong with these files?
Show 1D and 2D tensors as graph or color plot.
Investigate adding canvas limits and using browser scrollbars.
