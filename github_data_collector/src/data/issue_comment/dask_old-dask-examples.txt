With the Python 2 interpreter, the **Cumulative Sum, datetime resampling, and plotting** section of the `time-series-binder` notebook raises the following `ImportError` when run in Binder:


```

Error during evaluation in binder or in notebook on desktop for the 
- "Time Series and Dask DataFrame"
- "NYC Taxi 2013"

notebooks  an error is encountered with the text that no module named castra was found.

Someone should do some data science on the NYC Taxi dataset that we can host on dask-examples with binder?  This notebook could use some love https://github.com/blaze/dask-examples/blob/master/nyctaxi-2013.ipynb .  This work could include the following:
1.  Think about analyses to do (or stealing analyses from previous work (of which there is quite a lot))
2.  Create visualizations (perhaps with bokeh)
3.  Think about how these analyses can be more fun for interactive users to play with (e.g. what are good examples where people can tweak parameters and get novel results)
4.  Work with anaconda cluster folk to add more datasets (like fare-2013 or the new datasets for 2014/2015)
5.  Compare differences between the old and new data
