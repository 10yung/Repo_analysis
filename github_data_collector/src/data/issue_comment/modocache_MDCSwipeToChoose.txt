Swipe the card on ios13, and then frozen.
Does anyone else have this problem
Hi everybody,
first I want to thank you for great plugin.
Will try to describe my problem. I have implemented your plugin and everything works as it should. But there's one bug occurring while you are already swiping View. If during swiping your app goes to background (for example: somebody calls you, or just for testing, hit home button during swipe), after returning to app View will stuck somewhere in process off swiping and now it's position is calculated as starting for next swiping. What is wrong. View should return to it's starting position before app went to background.

I attached picture with "censored" content, but just look at cards. This is position they have after resuming app.

Bye
Inspired by PR #103 (which is 30 commits behind modocache:master) and suggestions from @vikmeup 
Is there a way to prevent the `MDCSwipeToChooseViews` from being removed from their `superview` after a swipe? I would like to keep the views since the user can navigate backwards through the cards in my app.

Thanks in advance!

This allows the swipe gesture/animation to work with views that are affected by Autolayout constraints.

Hi,

First, let me thank you for this projet.
Second, I've to admit that I'm a beginner in iOS dev, so please forgive me if I've forget something obvious.

After set up my BridgingHeader.h file in my project, and declare it in the build settings, I got a compilation error :

Any idea ?


Please replace this file for swift project for enable manually like dislike animation in proper way

Major bug have been solved theses last 7 months, including autolayout related #111 
It could be a good thing to update the cocoapod version 
or to update the doc with the corresponding pod spec
`pod 'MDCSwipeToChoose', :git => 'https://github.com/modocache/MDCSwipeToChoose.git'`

Nice job, using this lib in already 3 projects!

Hi,

I would like to adjust the view based on the view "infront" of it. Basically using the thresholdRatio. I want to grow the back view to the size of the front view as you pan. I am able to move it in X or Y but can't seem to crack the logic

Inputs:
frontView.frame
backView.frame
thresholdRatio
