n98-magerun version 1.103.1 by netz98 GmbH

if somehow the local.xml has wrong database username and it be cached, the next time you want to run `cache:clean` would output like this

`[Zend_Db_Adapter_Exception]
SQLSTATE[HY000] [1044] Access denied for user 'someuser'@'localhost' to database 'somedatabase'`

at this rate, the cache is stuck. we can't clean it.

to reproduce:

1. have app/etc/local.xml correct database username
2. cache clean it
3. open the webpage so that cache generated
4. change app/etc/local.xml database username to a wrong value
5. cache clean it
6. open the webpage so that cache generated
7. now correct the database username on app/etc/local.xml 
8. cache clean it (now it stucks)


 thanks for creating n98-magerun
I was importing a lot of config values with a magerun-script I had exported previously.

It failed after a while with a memory exception: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13721712/72134792-2903c000-3385-11ea-86ba-3545e8dfa356.png)

It executes ~130 items each time I run it.

The php cli does not have a memory limit (set to `-1`).

The system has a total of 16GB ram available, when I started the magerun command, it had > 11 GB available
To me, this looks like a bug either in magerun or magento, since the system has at least 10GB of memory available, which should be more than enough.
When using `customer:create` without explicitly mentioning the website, the default website should be taken. Currently, it seems that the website with the highest ID is used.
Hello,

I have a fresh Magento 1.9.3.9 and run n98-magerun version 1.102.0 .
Every time a try to run any command, show me this message (img attached).
<img width="1191" alt="screen shot 2018-10-09 at 16 28 32" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7848165/46693530-6d336e00-cbe0-11e8-97e6-796584700000.png">
Is there a way to solve this?
Thanks

Can we please update `"symfony/console": "~2.3",` to at least version 3, I'm facing conflicts because other packages depend on 3.x.
The command line interfaces is throwing a fatal error when I try to unlock an admin account. I did not see a issue about this on here, and I thought I should mention it. 

Error was encountered on: Magento 1.9.3.3

```

I would like to have the controller rewrites to also be listed under the `dev:module:rewrite:list` command.

I know I could also get that info from running `n98-magerun.phar config:dump frontend/routers`, but that is pretty hard to read.

Right now I'm manually appending the controllers to my findings from the `dev:module:rewrite:list` command by running the following:

    $ ./n98-magerun.phar dev:cons
    >>> foreach(Mage::getConfig()->getNode()->xpath('//routers/*/args/modules/../..') as $c) {
    ... echo "controllers\t" . $c->args->module . "\t" . $c->args->frontName . "\t" . implode(', ', array_keys((array)$c->args->modules)) ."\n";
    ... }
    controllers	Mage_Cms	cms	Vendor_OverrideCms
    controllers	Mage_Checkout	checkout	Idev_OneStepCheckout
    controllers	Mage_Contacts	contacts	VladimirPopov_WebForms
    controllers	Mage_Adminhtml	admin	Mage_Index, Mage_Paygate, Mage_Paypal, widget, oauth, Mage_Authorizenet, Mage_Bundle, captcha, Mage_Centinel, Mage_Compiler, searchindex, connect, Mage_Downloadable, Mage_GoogleShopping, importexport, api2, Mage_PageCache, Amasty_Base, Amasty_GiftCard
    => null

(:point_up_2: I could make a script out of that and run through `dev:eval` @ #990 :smile:)
It would be very useful to have sorting options on the commands that output listing in table format.

The sort option would need a column name as an argument to sort on and should also have to option to specify the direction (asc/desc).

As an example:

    $ n98-magerun.phar dev:module:rewrite:list
    +----------+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
    | Type     | Class                          | Rewrite                                   |
    +----------+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
    | blocks   | adminhtml/notification_window  | AW_All_Block_Notification_Window          |
    | blocks   | page/html_head                 | Mirasvit_Seo_Block_Html_Head              |
    | blocks   | checkout/cart                  | Idev_OneStepCheckout_Block_Checkout_Cart  |
    +----------+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

I would like to do `$ n98-magerun.phar dev:module:rewrite:list --sort=Class`:

    +----------+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
    | Type     | Class                        v | Rewrite                                   |
    +----------+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
    | blocks   | adminhtml/notification_window  | AW_All_Block_Notification_Window          |
    | blocks   | checkout/cart                  | Idev_OneStepCheckout_Block_Checkout_Cart  |
    | blocks   | page/html_head                 | Mirasvit_Seo_Block_Html_Head              |
    +----------+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

I know dev:console may take one line of code.
It would be nice to have `n98-magerun dev:eval snippet.php`
Thanks!

Idea? For @development db export: option to export say 10 customers or products

Now it strips all customer + sales + product data

Would it be an idea to have an option to keep the 10 last items? (at least then we already have some test data present)
