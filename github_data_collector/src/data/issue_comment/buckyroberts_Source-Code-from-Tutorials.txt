I have written the code in lesson 9 just like described, but I am getting a question mark at the end of my name. 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{

    int age;
    int currentYear;
    int birthYear;

    currentYear = 2019;
    birthYear = 1989;
    age = currentYear - birthYear;

    printf("Razvan is %d years old \n", age);

    char name[6] = "Razvan";
    printf("My name is %s \n", name);

    name[3] = 'w';
    printf("My name is %s \n", name);

    char food[] = "bacon";
    printf("The best food is %s \n", food);

    strcpy(food, "sarmale");
    printf("But not after %s \n", food);



    return 0;
}

hello

please review and merge
hope this helps somebody somewhere
Difference between while and do-while loop.
Added the else part of the code to make it more understandable.



Have begun going through all of Bucky's C tutorials for Uni and figured I will complete the source code for C while I'm studying.
