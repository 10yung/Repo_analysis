should be:
"where the master branch was on the person’s repository you cloned
from when you did so, and a master branch that points _TO_ the most
recent local commit."

I would love to read this book on my kindle? I didn't found in the Rakefile how you actually generate the pdf from your html files. Don't you think it would be possible to generate a epub and a mobi file as well?

I'm producing a bunch of books for online education in Brazil, you can see those at
https://github.com/edusantana/ufpb-virtual-computacao/blob/master/livro/capitulos/livros.asc (click on 'baixar' (portuguese word for download) - i'm using asciidoc and github to produce those books.

Anyway, I was worndering, how do you draw those nice graphics like
- https://github.com/pluralsight/git-internals-pdf/blob/master/artwork/vector/Blobs.eps and 
- https://github.com/pluralsight/git-internals-pdf/blob/master/artwork/vector/DAG_Model.eps ? 

Which software do you use?

I have contacted Scott Chacon, and he replay:

```
  "I don't actually know, Geoff did those.  Perhaps you could create an issue on the repo with this questions."
```

Is this a general issue, or am I doing something dumb?

Fix a few trivial typos that I noticed when reading the PDF.

The first patch, fixing the spelling error "verison" -> "version" in a commit message, would of course also alter the SHA-1s of the commits in the example.  But it doesn't look like there is any intention that the reader could replicate the SHA-1s, so I don't think it is a problem that the SHA-1 shown could not actually result from a commit with the log message in its corrected form.

This patch fixes each instance of `'git ...'` within `text/*.textile` to use the pre-formatted style `@git ...@` instead.

Some but not all instances of git commands were using the `@...@` form already.

This patch is required if issue GH-6 (disable em-dash conversion within @code blocks@ in the PDF) is to be resolved, since the `'git --option'` form would still suffer from unwanted em-dashes.

In s2-c04-log-commit-history.textile, the text block:

>  shell. git log -n 30 --since="1 month ago" --until=yesterday --author="schacon"

Is represented in the PDF with "--since" colored black and "--until" colored blue. The options should be highlighted consistently, either both blue (matching --author) or both black (matching -n).

s2-c00-using-git.textile contains:

> If you want to set different values for a specific project, just leave out the
> @--global@ and it will write the same snippet

However, when '--global' is rendered in the PDF, the double hyphens (--) are converted into an em-dash (–).

Page 17 of the PDF says tree objects are stored as "a very simple text file", which is wrong. Tree objects are stored in a binary format, see http://git.rsbx.net/Documents/Git_Data_Formats.txt
