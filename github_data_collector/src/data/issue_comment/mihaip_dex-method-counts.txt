**Bug description**: No matter how many default package methods there are, the printed result is always 1 for default package methods count. **Explanation**: The name in line 49 may be "", which means corresponding method is from default package. For the default package methods, code runs into else branch since no child has name "". Therefore, for every default package method, a new Node is created in line 53. For non-first default package method, the newly created Node will always replace the former Node in line 59, and get its count equals 1 in line 63. Overall, method count of default package is always at most 1. I added an else if branch, which avoids making new Node if we already has a <default> Node when the coming method is a default package method.
There's two fixes related to print output and gitignore. But more importantly I've added the ability to compare method counts between the supplied inputs, which prints the difference between the second and first input next to the counts for the second.
Hi, I wonder if it is possible to measure the size of methods and classes (LOC bytes, etc)?

Thanks.
Is it possible to automate this process on every debug build by creating custom gradle task?

Hello, is there any way to count total of classes on dex file, 
its on dalvik.system.DexFile package, but must load inside android, if possible to count it outside of android itself

Hello, is it possible to add "export data to JSON/XML file" feature?

Google release Android Studio 2.0 to Stable Channel today, as well as its instant run features. I believe `dex-method-counts` count the methods incorrectly for APK produced with instant run. If you try to extract the APK, you could see there is a new file `instant-run.zip` which contains all dexes for each package. I believe this is the reason why `dex-method-counts` won't work.

Any plan to support this? Thanks.
