This is an idea to allow consumers to set the classname prefix, which would allow for more graceful upgrading of ui-box without necessarily requiring a major version bump (selector changes might be considered a major breaking change).

This might be overkill. We could consider upgrading ui-box in evergreen, despite the classnames changing – considering that css changes in evergreen also leads to selector changes.
Was looking at using ui-box in my project, but came up against needing to extract the styles into its own stylesheet, and then supplying that to our build pipeline.

Not asking you to build this, just if you've already thought about it, what direction would you recommend me taking it in?

Regardless, great work on this component + evergreen, it's inspired my thinking a lot.
