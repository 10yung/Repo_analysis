Hiya,

I've been looking for multiple file upload, I'm currently using the file_field option. 

Is it possible to have a multiple file upload system? I don't know if I'm missing something haha!
Getting an error with trestle.

File to import not found or unreadable: trestle/support.

`@import "trestle/support";`

I'm using `gem 'rails', '~> 6.0.0.rc1'`

Is there anything that needs to be done here? Turns out this may be coming from the auth plugin. Will check there.
I have used CanCanCan to limit specific action on admin dashboard based on role. I would like to limit some specific CRUD operations on specific model. Is it possible to also render different content on specific role? I have specified ability.rb with for example:

 `user can :read, Company, id: user.companies.pluck(:id)`

and connect load_and_authorized_resource in controller.rb. 
When I have used command 
`Company.accessible_by(ability)` in IRB it give me correct feedback. But how can I connect this functionality to Trestle? 

I'd prefer all of my tables sorted by `id` by default (basically as if I'd clicked the id column heading immediately after loading the page). I don't mind applying an option to each table individually to set that sort, but I don't see such an option.
If you click on a column heading, it applies the sort, but navigates back to the main tab.

Hi,

I am using trestle admin.
I am also using active storage.

Files were uploading fine till yesterday.

today suddenly - I am getting error :
Can't verify CSRF token authenticity

when i try to call custom action to save a file with active storage api.

how can i try to debug ?
When rendering form with `dialog: true` search bar in select is not working (version 0.8.12).
The save button spinner does not always show. When there are large files uploading, the button shows the spinner briefly then goes back to default state. Is there a way for me to fix this?
