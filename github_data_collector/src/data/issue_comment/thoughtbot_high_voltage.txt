At the moment if you want to use a custom controller but otherwise use the HighVoltage internal mechanics, you have to turn off `routes` and unset the `home_page` due to the way the routes files is coded:
```
HighVoltage.parent_engine.routes.draw do
  if HighVoltage.home_page
    get "/#{HighVoltage.home_page}", to: redirect('/')
    root to: 'high_voltage/pages#show', id: HighVoltage.home_page
  end

  if HighVoltage.routes
    get HighVoltage.route_drawer.match_attributes
  end
end
```
We could nest the home page routes under the `if HighVoltage.routes` logic, which is more what I would expect if I disabled the gem routes. I think that is a standalone improvement.

But I would also like to suggest that the home page routes and could be modified to support just using a custom routes drawer to enable full custom controller support. One way is to add a new config option `controller_name` or `rack_endpoint` with a default of `"high_voltage/pages"` which could be inserted in the routes i.e. 
```
root to: "#{HighVoltage.controller_name}#show", id: HighVoltage.home_page
```
and a similar change in the route drawers.

Alternatively we could modify the current route drawers to use a different `get` options method signature
i.e. in routes drawer

```
def self.match_attributes
  [
    "/#{HighVoltage.content_path}*id",
    {
      :to => 'high_voltage/pages#show',
      :as => :page,
      :format => false
    }
  ]
end
```
paired with
```
HighVoltage.parent_engine.routes.draw do
  if HighVoltage.home_page
    get "/#{HighVoltage.home_page}", to: redirect('/')
    root to: HighVoltage.route_drawer.match_attributes[:to], id: HighVoltage.home_page
  end

  if HighVoltage.routes
    get(*HighVoltage.route_drawer.match_attributes)
  end
end
```
This is neatly internally consistent, but has the problem of backward compatibility. Which could be overcome with a little ugly check on the return value type of `match_attributes` being an array or hash.

Is it possible to assign some static pages one layout, and others a different one while still having them managed through High Voltage?
