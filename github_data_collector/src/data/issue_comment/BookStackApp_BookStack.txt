**Describe the bug**
Uploading a file attachment or inline image fails on my IIS 7.5 site. When inspecting the network traffic using the browser's developer tools, all requests fail specifically with a HTTP500 error.


**Workaround**
* Edit file `\app\Uploads\AttachmentService.php`
* Find line `$attachmentData = file_get_contents($uploadedFile->getRealPath());` and replace with `$attachmentData = file_get_contents($uploadedFile->getPathname());`
* Edit file `\app\Uploads\ImageService.php`
* Find line `$imageData = file_get_contents($uploadedFile->getRealPath());` and replace with `$imageData = file_get_contents($uploadedFile->getPathname());`


**Your Configuration (please complete the following information):**
 - Exact BookStack Version (Found in settings): v0.27.5
 - PHP Version: 7.4.1
 - Hosting Method (Nginx/Apache/Docker): IIS


**Describe the feature you'd like**
The ability to see changes in page tags in revision history

**Describe the benefits this feature would bring to BookStack users**
See the full history of page including the metadata

**Additional context**
We had a tag somehow be accidentally removed and it was not possible to see when this happened. Furthermore when a revision is made to a page to change a tag and nothing else, it shows a blank 'diff'

I am trying to connect BookStack to my existing LDAP server. 
The server is configured so that anonymous connections cannot be done.
I do not have a dedicated system user to configure LDAP_DN and LDAP_PASS in the .env file.
How do I make LDAP authentication work under these circumstances ?

Thanks in advance.

**Describe the feature you'd like**
Currently if I edit a page and save it without making any changes a new revision is created. 
I think that such action shouldn't create a new revision. 

**Describe the benefits this feature would bring to BookStack users**
This change would  make it easier to keep the page versions tidy. Currently I have to manually remove any 'empty' revisions which is time consuming and it's easy to make a mistake and delete the wrong one.
Thanks to this change in the revisions page users would only see actual changes made.

Another solution for this could be somehow marking the 'empty' revisions on the revision page.


In relation to #1525

This adds a simple close icon to all notification panes. Here is an example of how it looks:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33401067/72377597-5fb73e80-36d5-11ea-8655-e1881383d8c0.png)

Per the comments on the bottom of the issue thread, it doesn't actually do anything, besides provide the user a visual cue reminding users to click to dismiss the notification.
Currently, BookStack has a (very neat) "Entity Selection" tool that lets you link to another page within the same bookstack installation.  Unfortunately, once that link is created, it is hardcoded into the page being edited.

In most cases, that is probably sufficient.  However, I am currently in a situation where I need to change the domain name upon which bookstack is hosted.  While changing the appropriate setting in the .env file does update the general assets correctly, the internal links do not change.  This means that after I update the domain, I will need to go through every single page and update every single internal link.

**Suggested Feature**
Have any links created by the "Entity Selector" link generator be a dynamically-created link.  This will allow migrating to a new domain to work without manual intervention.

**Additional Comments**
I suspect this feature would _also_ affect links that point to pages which later have their names changed.  Finally, the comment regarding APP_URL in the .env file states 

> All URL's in BookStack will be generated using this value

Given that internal links are not dynamic, this is at best misleading, and at worst incorrect.
Hello. I had version 0.19 and I liked very much the aspect of it, very vivid colors. I have upgraded to the last version and it looks worse for me, because the colors are darker and the book icon is different. Is there any way of getting back the colors/aspect of 0.19 while maintaining the new features of 0.27.5? 

Thank you very much

Sometimes, under very strange circumstances, when creating a page and saving it, after trying to edit the created page, the page is not saved, the first version of the page always remains. While deleting this page is also not possible. I did not find the patterns of such behavior; in the Mariadb database, the page and all its fields look similar to the other page that is being edited. In order for the page to start editing, in the same place in the database you need to change the text, for example, to "123" and the page starts to be edited using bookstack tools

Bookstack latest version.
