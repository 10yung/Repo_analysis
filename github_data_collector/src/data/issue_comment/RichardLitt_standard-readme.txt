Hello, I have two questions.

## Under what sections the following items should be put in?

Suppose I need to include the following information in the *README.md* for a web app (backend and frontend code).

- Development prerequisites (e.g. supported IDE, database Docker image).
- How to run the web app locally (e.g. configuring ports).
- Common gotchas devs may encounter while trying to run locally/working (e.g. `ng serve` running out of memory, weird UI bugs).

Would I put these all under the Contributing section or is there some other section/subsection you would prefer? 


## What to put in the Usage section for web apps?

What should I put in the Usage section for web apps (not including Web APIs)? 
There should be a linter, after the spec in the main readme is filled out. The linter will most likely use [remark](https://github.com/wooorm/remark) and [remark-lint](https://github.com/wooorm/remark-lint). This is the planning issue for the linter. Please subscribe here, and open new issues for tangential questions about Standard Readme.
