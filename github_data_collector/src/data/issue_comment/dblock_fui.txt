When use `fui find` in project directory in terminal , no content appear in console . How can I know the command is executing ? And does it working ?

You can use the image scanning and useless resources related to the swift, useless code scanning?
Hello  
      Dustin Barkerï¼ŒCould I not scan files larger than 500kb? My project sdk contains more than 500kb framework, no scan out.thanks!


when i try to find all unused classes, it tells me that one of them is not used when it clearly is. could it be that it's because the import for it is in a class extension, and so fui doesn't believe it's being imported at all? i typically have MyClass.h and MyClass_Private.h, and this private header which is a class extension is where it's imported

Categories marked as unused in all source code.

fui does not search in .xib and .storyboard files for used classes. As result those classes marked as unused.

...as in 
`#include "header.h"`

I noticed that if you have a file that is imported and accidentally missing a space

```
 #import"filename.h"
```

it is not counted and therefore the file can be marked as unused even if it is. The #import search should ideally be a regex that supports any amount of spaces.

I was looking for a tool that can help me to remove unused #import at top of a class.

This utility is nice, but it does not "find unused import", but find unused class (as stated in the readme).

Is it possible/expected to have the fui command tell : 

```
SomeClass.m:14 unused import of SomeOtherClass.h
```

?
