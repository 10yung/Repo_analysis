Add non-null to query for fetching dimension choices.
When we log the queries and slow queries during execution, we should add some extra metadata to the log items so end users can add this information to their logs, or if you forward these logs to a logging service, analytics can be run on these fields.

Example:
`query_logger.info(query_log_msg, extra={'duration': <duration>, 'tables': tables})`

To begin with, the above 'extra' fields should be added. Any other useful additional fields would also be fine to add.

We should also remove the duration from the hard-coded log message, and just provide this in the extra dictionary, so that end-users can specify whether the log should include this in their own log formatters.

When transposing the react table widget with zero dimensions, an unhandled exception is raised.
