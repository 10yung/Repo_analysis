Error: this application, or a library it uses, has passed an invalid numeric value (NaN, or not-a-number) to CoreGraphics API and this value is being ignored. Please fix this problem.
I am facing a weird issue after updating to XCode-11. 
Only on the devices with iOS-13 the the font appears to be as TIMES NEW ROMAN. whereas on devices having older versions the font seems to be perfectly fine.

Any help anyone please?

When I used LTMorphingLabel at the time, I often showed the picture on the view first display.

The red line on the picture is surrounded by two, the display is incomplete, and one is not displayed.
These three values may not change so fast.
But the initial value is empty, I tracked to use label.text to set the value.

I am using the LTMorphingEffect.sparkle effect.

numberLines modify is invalid?
Hi guys, can somebody explain to me what I have to do in order to use LTMorphingLabel in an Objective-C project with Carthage?

What I've done so far:

1. Added github "lexrus/LTMorphingLabel" to my cartfile.
2. Run "carthage update".

What are the next steps? Thank in advance!
Hi,

Does anyone got the same error message when using this library in Swift 4, iOS 10+?

I got 

> Unknown class LTMorphingLabel in Interface Builder file.

When running the following code:

import LTMorphingLabel
class WelcomePageViewController: UIViewController,LTMorphingLabelDelegate 
{
    @IBOutlet weak var welcomeText: LTMorphingLabel!
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        welcomeText.delegate = self
        welcomeText.morphingEnabled = true
        welcomeText.morphingDuration = 3.0
        welcomeText.morphingEffect = effect
    }
}
**I got this Error:**
Thread 1: Fatal error: Index out of range
**Here**:
```
func limboOfNewCharacter(
        _ char: Character,
        index: Int,
        progress: Float) -> LTCharacterLimbo {
            
            let currentRect = newRects[index] <---- here i got : Thread 1: Fatal error: Index out of range
            var currentFontSize = CGFloat(
                LTEasing.easeOutQuint(progress, 0, Float(font.pointSize))
```


the textlabel was empty (view did load) before i added new text later.
