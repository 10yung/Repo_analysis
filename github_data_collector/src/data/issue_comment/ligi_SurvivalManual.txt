Example: open the Power category. On top of the Power text, could be the expandable button for list/legend menu that has the options like:
- Solar
- Bicycle
- Wind
Clicking on the option takes you to that part of the Power text. 
Clicking on Bicycle brings you to the Bicycle tutorial. 
The text is sometimes dark in the dark mode, and it refreshed after a while.

Hi guys, the survival manual is great. I cannot find a ham radio basics, morse code, amateur band allocation, cb radio basics, daytime and nighttime wave propagation and basic antenna making. Maybe shortwave listening, international bands and listening tips with a simple shortwave radio. Is there any plan to add this? I dont know if i can write all up, but i can read it and make some comments.
Check this trap out, would be an excellent addition to the traps section.

Text in pull out menu shouldn't be black in black mode. 
The sheep shank is prone to fail under any load and should never be used. The alpine butterfly loop will do the same thing with the addition of adding an anchor point mid rope also several can be used to make a rope ladder.
