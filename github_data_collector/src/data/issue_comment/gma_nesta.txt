> ### Security
> 
> #### Address CVE-2019-5477 ([#1915](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1915))
> 
> A command injection vulnerability in Nokogiri v1.10.3 and earlier allows commands to be executed in a subprocess by Ruby's `Kernel.open` method. Processes are vulnerable only if the undocumented method `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file` is being passed untrusted user input.
> 
> This vulnerability appears in code generated by the Rexical gem versions v1.0.6 and earlier. Rexical is used by Nokogiri to generate lexical scanner code for parsing CSS queries. The underlying vulnerability was addressed in Rexical v1.0.7 and Nokogiri upgraded to this version of Rexical in Nokogiri v1.10.4.

Target the system fonts of individual OS to remove the reliance on google fonts.

The motivation is captured neatly in commit 641e1688 in the NWRUG web site repo, with:

> See the Using UI System Fonts In Web Design: A Quick Practical Guide Smashing Magazine article [1] for details on how this particular set of fonts were put together.

[1] https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/using-system-ui-fonts-practical-guide/
See https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/

How good would that look?
I've extracted this task from #32, but it didn't say why. It seems fairly obvious why, but check where `#link_text` is used before just implementing this blindly…

It's no longer in HTML5…

It was long since superseded by `Menu.top_level`, and can now be removed.

Nesta used to be able to load plugins within a `./plugins` folder within a site's folder. Since plugins became gems this is no longer required, and can now be removed.

It was a daft thing to do in the first place, and since Glenn pointed out that the config file can be parsed with Erb (i.e. you can put `<%= ENV.fetch('NESTA_TITLE') %>` in your config file), there's no point keeping the extra code in Nesta.

I suspect it'll simplify some code.
