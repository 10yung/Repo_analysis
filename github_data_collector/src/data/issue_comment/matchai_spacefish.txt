```

**Expected Behavior**

The error shall not be reported.

**Relevant `Fish` Configuration**

Here are all configurations related to `spacefish` but I don't think they are relevent. Write them in case you need to see them:

```fish
set SPACEFISH_USER_SHOW "always"
set SPACEFISH_HOST_SHOW "always"
```

**Environment**
- Spacefish version: `2.7.0`
- Fish version: `fish, version 3.0.2`
- Fish plugin manager: `oh-my-fish`
- Terminal emulator: not related
- Operating system: Arch Linux

## Feature Request
<!--
Please keep in mind that we are working to achieve feature parity with Spaceship.
If this proposed feature doesn't already exist in Spaceship, please submit a PR there instead.
-->

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Fish has the very nice function for prompts to show a shortened path instead of full sub directory names.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Truncating the path is a nice option. Personally I like Fish's builtin way to shorten the directory path in prompts.

``` shell
echo $PWD # or just (pwd)
/home/$USER/.local/share/omf/lib/completions

__sf_section_dir
in omf/lib/completions

prompt_pwd
~/.l/s/o/l/completions
```

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Instead of using `pwd` or `$PWD` it would be possible to use `prompt_pwd`.

## `fish-nvm` Node version is not shown

**Current Behavior**

I use the following Node version manager: https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fish-nvm

Currently, Spacefish does not show me the Node version used, c.f. screenshot:

**Environment**
- Spacefish version: 2.7.0
- Fish version: [the output of `fish --version`]
- Fish plugin manager: fisher
- Terminal emulator: iTerm
- Operating system: OSX 10.14.6
## Bug Report

**Current Behavior**
When I activate a Python virtual environment, the name of the environment appears on the line above the prompt, devoid of any styling save for a pair of parentheses. AFAIK, this is just the default way Python displays a virutalenv.

**Expected Behavior**
I would expect the virtualenv section to appear inline with the rest of prompt and be formatted correctly.

**Relevant `Fish` Configuration**
<!-- Can be found in ~/.config/fish/config.fish -->
```fish
set SPACEFISH_PROMPT_ORDER time user dir host git package node golang haskell pyenv exec_time line_sep battery jobs exit_code char
set SPACEFISH_CHAR_SYMBOL ‚à´

```

**Environment**
- Spacefish version: [the output of `echo $SPACEFISH_VERSION`] `2.6.1`
- Fish version: [the output of `fish --version`] `3.0.2`
- Fish plugin manager: [e.g. oh-my-fish, fisher, fin] `fisher`
- Terminal emulator: [e.g. iTerm, Hyper, Terminator] `iTerm2`
- Operating system: [e.g. OSX 10.13.4, Windows 10] `macOS Mojave v10.14.3`

**Possible Solution**
<!--- Only if you have suggestions on a fix for the bug -->

**Additional context/Screenshots**
Add any other context about the problem here. If applicable, add screenshots to help explain.

Before activating the virtual environment:

After activating the virtual environment:

Thanks!
**Current Behavior**
This is the inverse of https://github.com/matchai/spacefish/issues/179.

The smallest reproducible case I've found so far is to:
- cd into a directory which triggers the AWS module
- press "g"
- press < tab >
- press < delete >

Notice that the "g" remains displayed on screen but is not actually present in the buffer.

**Expected Behavior**
The first input character should not be displayed when deleted.

**Relevant `Fish` Configuration**
```fish
set SPACEFISH_PROMPT_ORDER user dir host git package docker aws venv conda kubecontext exec_time battery vi_mode jobs char
set SPACEFISH_PROMPT_ADD_NEWLINE true

set -g fish_emoji_width 2
```

**Environment**
- Spacefish version: 2.6.1
- Fish version: 3.0.2
- Fish plugin manager: fisher
- Terminal emulator: iTerm 3.2.9
- Operating system: OSX 10.14.5

**Additional context/Screenshots**
- This happens with or without `line_sep`.
- This does not happen if I change `SPACEFISH_AWS_SYMBOL` to a non-emoji.
- Pasting the cloud emoji taken from the Spacefish function (‚òÅÔ∏è) into iTerm doesn't render well, but renders correctly when output by Spacefish.
- The iTerm setting "Use Unicode version 9 widths" is checked.
- Possibly related: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5583


## Bug Report

**Current Behavior**
Shows a `‚ö†Ô∏è` symbol when the package version is not defined.

**Expected Behavior**
Does not show the package section if no version is defined.

**Possible Solution**
<!--- Only if you have suggestions on a fix for the bug -->
Remove the `‚ö†Ô∏è` symbol for version, as was done in https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt/pull/441.

> [üêü](https://github.com/matchai/spacefish-bot) **spacefish-bot** ‚Äî Issue copied from: https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt/issues/655.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

Many applications will use `package.json` to track dependencies and scripts but have no intentions of publishing to a package repository. A package version probably does not mean much either in those contexts. It is recommended that such projects set `private: true`.

For such projects, seeing a warning symbol in the prompt leads to think something is misconfigured.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

If `package.json` does not contain a version but is marked private, do not display the `package section.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

Add a configuration option to opt into this behaviour. I think this should be the default behaviour but could be convinced that it needs an opt in.

**Documentation, adoption**

Recommend setting `private: true` for version-less packages.
## Bug Report

**Current Behavior**
When having a lot of active git changes, spacefish crashes. Only displays part of the prompt and only show a new input line after sending ctrl-c.

**Expected Behavior**
Fish not crashing ;-), or the git related features being disabled/limited if to many changes are active.


**Environment**
- Spacefish version: 2.2.0
- Fish version: 3.0.2
- Fish plugin manager: omf (use the git completion plugin, but same problem after disabling it)
- Terminal emulator: gnome Terminal 
- Operating system: Ubuntu 19.04

**Possible Solution**
Disable/Limit git related functionality if to many active changes to handle are detected.

## Bug Report

**Current Behavior**
When I execute the command in the git repository, the result is output normally, but it takes a long time to execute the result and output an error message that is ‚Äòtest: Expected a combining operator like '-a' at index 1‚Äô.

**Relevant `Fish` Configuration**
<!-- Can be found in ~/.config/fish/config.fish -->
```fish
set SPACEFISH_TIME_SHOW true
set SPACEFISH_DATE_SHOW true
```

**Environment**
- Spacefish version: [2.4.0]
- Fish version: [fish, version 3.0.2]
- Fish plugin manager: [fisher]
- Terminal emulator: [cmderÔºågit bash Ôºå pycharm terminal]
- Operating system: [wslÔºàubuntu18.04Ôºâ on Windows 10]
**TL;DR:** The team has begun working on the better, faster, cross-shell rewrite at https://github.com/starship/starship. ‚ú®üöÄ
Spacefish is not going anywhere and is still accepting feature PRs, but we won't be actively working on it.

---

Inspired by the work @denysdovhan did on [denysdovhan/robbyrussell-node](https://github.com/denysdovhan/robbyrussell-node) and [this discussion](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt/pull/571#issuecomment-441999293) back in November, I started work on https://github.com/starship/starship at the start of April 2019 to address the amount of duplicated effort that is made to maintain both spaceship and spacefish.

Starship is written in Rust and will contain all the logic required for a wrapper to be created for any shell. The plan for the immediate future is to add first-class support for Fish, Zsh, and Bash. The prompts will mostly be the same, with some improvements where it was difficult to make them in the past. Things like prompt configuration files, improved testing, self-updating, more safety when things go wrong, etc.

All of that being said, we will still be reviewing feature PRs on this repo for the next little while, so we haven't gone into full "maintenance mode". That won't be happening until starship has all the features and tooling needed to replace spacefish.

We would love to get the support of those of you who are fans of spacefish and would like to contribute to our Rust codebase.

Hope to see you over at https://github.com/starship/starship! üòÑ
