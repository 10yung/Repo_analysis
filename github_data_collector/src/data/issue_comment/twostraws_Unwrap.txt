Made the print statement more grammatically correct. From "One of them" to "At least one of them" since it's possible for both to be true.

Also, I believe the new version of Xcode (where I edited the file) added the newline at the end of the file. I wasn't even down there, weird. 
When taking the nil coalescing review, the last value after the ?? would be missing until the answer is submitted.

I saw [some user-facing strings](https://github.com/twostraws/Unwrap/blob/e8d2da394ac3326c3ef8255a09eb0118cc1e147d/Unwrap/Activities/Home/HomeDataSource.swift#L195) that are not wrapped in an `NSLocalizedString` and I was wondering about the plans of localizing the app?

It might be a good idea to prepare for that, and it could be a nice task to get an overview of the code base. :)

(I might want to pick this one up myself ðŸ˜„)
Record if the person got any question right or wrong and use [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) to determine when they would be asked the question again. This would be a huge improvement as you would be asked questions you struggled with or haven't seen first. 

Also analytics could be added to report troublesome questions. For example if a question has a really low success rate the question might be worded poorly. 
- It would be awesome to get a notification when you get a badge
- For the practice badges after you complete it 10 times, it would be cool to have different colours for the same badge when you complete more. For example at 20, it would go blue, 50 silver, 100 gold
