Hello, It seems you didn't include the init script for FreeBSD. 

I have come up with the one below which I save in /usr/local/etc/rc.d before enabling in /etc/rc.conf, but it doesn't seem to work well. 
```

#!/bin/sh

. /etc/rc.subr

name="supervisord"
rcvar=`set_rcvar`

command="/usr/local/bin/${name}"
command_args="-c /etc/supervisord.conf"

load_rc_config $name
run_rc_command "$1
```

PID need to be created
Paths are different


`supervisorctl` path setting is also required.

- Remove `--pidfile` from args as this is hard-coded already, meaning this was added twice.
- Add `--make-pidfile` to `start-stop-deamon` command, otherwise the pid file is not created



pip puts supervisord at /usr/local/bin/supervisord by default.
