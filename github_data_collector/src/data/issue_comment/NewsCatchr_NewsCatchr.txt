Looks like this got stalled about a year ago, @jlelse â€“ as there are a bunch of commits after the last release, will you at least release those?
Expected behavior
The user hopes to be able to enter the option of "Bookmarks" and to manage the news that he liked, as well as being able to enter the menu of "Settings" at will.

Actual behavior
The user cannot enter the "Bookmarks" option and be able to manage the news he liked most, as well as being able to enter the "Settings" menu at will. Because when you enter any of these options and press "Back" button on the device, the option is disabled. for example; If we enter the option of "configurations" and give back once, we will not be able to enter again until the application is completely closed.

How to reproduce
1. Go to the "Settings" menu or to "bookmarks", in any of these options, press "back" once on the device.
2. After this try again to enter the option that was previously, example; If you were in bookmarks, press "back" and try to enter "bookmarks" again.
3. In doing so, we noticed how the option was totally disabled, even if you go to see other news and want to press this option, An error occurs that returns you to the main menu.
4. Exactly the same happens when you repeat those steps in the "Settings" menu.

Expected behavior
It is expected to remain within the application, no matter how often the device screen is rotated.

Actual behavior
Currently in the application, if you enter the Settings menu and turn the device screen 2 times, we will find an unexpected shutdown by the application.

How to reproduce
1. Start, go to the Settings menu and rotate the device screen 2 times.
2. We will notice an unexpected closing, as long as we follow the previous step.

Hello my name is Richard Caseres I am a graphic designer and I like to make contributions for open source projects from the graphic and advertising point of view. in this opportunity I contact you to propose a new icon and a logo more personalized and more current for your application in development this in order to give a better image to your project.

I develop within the platform Utopian.io with blockchain of steemit, the rewards I receive from them however they require me to contact the developer of the project so that they can verify that my logo proposal will be used in the project and so do not compensate contributions that will not be used in the projects.

Here I show you a model of the proposal of the logo if it is of tua degree I can provide you all the necessary files within a contribution in GitHub to be added to your project.

![presentationnew](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35604837/37566783-16d2d322-2a94-11e8-8200-f680c6888622.png)

The design is mainly based on incorporating the letter N with the letter C without losing the base of the functions of the application that is the search for news by rss that is why I incorporate the universal logo of rss, the blue color is maintained as a basis however, it can vary to the color you want.

So that within Utopian-io my contribution to your project is valid you must place on the main page of the project on GitHub an application for a new logo or icon as a contribution to your project to simply demonstrate that you will use the new icon and the new logo.

Well I hope you like my proposal, thank you very much for your time to read this and I hope we are in contact. Greetings.

It would be nice to be able to save frequently searched terms, like "open source" as topics for easy access. 
Thank you
It would be nice to see the total number of all feeds and provide an option to auto-delete feed entries after a given period of time, e.g. 1 day 1 week 1 month. Thanks!
The app needs proguard!
