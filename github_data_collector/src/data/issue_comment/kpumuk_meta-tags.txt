```
An ActionView::Template::Error occurred in products#show:

  ret: 2, hash modified during iteration
```

in `display_meta_tags` method.

with `meta-tags` version 2.13.0.
I am not sure how I feel about this change yet. Basically, it starts treating `itemprop` attribute in a special way, applying `itemprop` attribute to `_` tag:

```ruby
display_meta_tags(
  og: {
    image: {
       _:       'image.png',
      itemprop: 'image',
      type:     'image/jpeg',
      width:    200,
      height:   {
        _:        200,
        itemprop: 'custom',
      },
    },
  },
)
```

Closes #198 

I need to add itemprop attribute to meta tag
`<meta property="og:image" itemprop="image" content="http://pollosweb.wesped.es/programa_pollos/play.png">`

But by using method display_meta_tags
```
<%= display_meta_tags og: {
      image:  {
           _:   (asset_path 'image.png'),
        type:   'image/jpeg',
        width:  200,
        height:  200
      } 
    },
   itemprop: "image" 
  %>
```

its not helping and only creating the new meta tag with name itemprop. Please help. 
I have
```
<meta name="description" content="hello">
<meta property="og:description" content="hello">
```

I would like
```
<meta name="description" property="og:description" content="hello">
```

How can I do this?
When I add Helmet to my React Application I have duplicates of the description tag. 
To [solve a duplicate](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet/issues/341#issuecomment-360991417), I need to add attribute **data-react-helmet** to the description tag.

For example
```html
<meta name="description" content="some description" data-react-helmet="true">
```

Can I add this attribute?
Hello,

I think that `title` and `description` are very generic names, likely to cause collisions in apps.

Actually I had strange errors and realized it was caused by helpers that already existed in my app (in a component context, as I use [komponent](https://github.com/komposable/komponent)).

I suggest renaming them to `page_title` and `page_description`, or `meta_title` and `meta_description`.
I know this would be a breaking change, but would you consider it for an upcoming major version?

Thanks
Fixed #83 creating support for adding meta tags via locales in the
format:

```
en:
  meta_tags:
    [controller]:
      [action]:
        title: My title
```

etc.
I have not created any tests as Iâ€™m quite frankly not sure how to write
them using locales data.

Has it been considered to add ability to add meta tags using i18n locale files?

E.g. in a namespace like:

```
en:
  meta_tags:
   [controller]:
     [action]:
       title: My locale title
       description: Foo baa
```

etc. ?

What about add support for the Dublin Core meta tags? 

I would suggest to add official support from "meta-tags" gem, but I also would suggest that someone update the README.MD talking about DC and how to implement Dublin Core meta tags on a given website (like the mini-tutorial for OG tags and Twitter Cards).

What do you think about that?
