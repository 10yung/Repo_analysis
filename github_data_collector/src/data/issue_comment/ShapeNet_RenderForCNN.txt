I am unable to find a tool to perform multilabel classification,for instance a movie can be classified into action, romance and epic. I have however seen that of multiclass. Can anyone please explain how to go about mltilabelling in matlab?

P.S. I have done this with Python, but for some reason, my employer wants it using MATLAB.

Thanks for answering.
In addition to basic Matlab, which Matlab toolboxes are needed for running Matlab scripts of RenderForCNN?  Thanks.  CC
I'm looking at run_demo.py, but I'm not sure on how I could modify this script in order to render images at specific angles. Is there a way to do this?

One other question. Is it possible to use this library to reconstruct a 3D model from 2D images?
When I ran run_render.py, it generated synthetic images (218) and visible keypoints (.csv file). The number of visible keypoints vary from 1 to 12 (max). 

But when I ran run_crop.py, its unable to find the keypoints and gave the following error:

Failed to find keypoints in crop /media/dell/STORAGE/data/syn_images/02924116/1582c81bf7dff678d26b2d2076566bb8/02924116_1582c81bf7dff678d26b2d2076566bb8_a014_e-04_t001_d001.png

The synthetic image with the above name and corresponding keypoints file (.csv) does exist in the syn_images folder.

in render_model_views.py
function camPosToQuaternion(cx, cy, cz) was defined twice, why is that? the second definition will overwrite the first one, so ,there will be no meaning to define the first  function.Is this a bug?? Or did it on purpose?
I try to run `python demo_view/run_demo.py`, but I keep getting the error `RuntimeError: Could not open file RenderForCNN/caffe_models/render4cnn_3dview.caffemodel`. This model doesn't seem to exist in the `caffe_models` folder, so I'm not sure why the code is looking for this file.

Hello 

Thanks for sharing this amazing tool !! 

May I ask, can I get depth image from a random/specified viewpoint by using your tool ? It can be done by meshlab, which however does not support batch processing and thus is low efficient.

I am trying to train own model as described in the **Training your own models** section, but I have trouble making the  caffe-render-for-cnn version, probably due to dependency issues since I have newer CUDA and cuDNN versions (8.0 and 5.1 respectively). Can you please specify the correct (supported) versions for CUDA and cuDNN on which the model was tested?
dose it can change this command?
` command = '%s %s --background --python %s -- %s %s %s %s %s > /dev/null 2>&1'`
