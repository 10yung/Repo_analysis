While building dependencies for install woeusb it gives a missing dependencies error : 
 libwxgtk2.8-dev  &  libwxgtk3.0-dev

Because the name of these packages has been updated, it's necessary to modify "control" file in "debian" folder.

Rename : libwxgtk3.0-dev ------>  libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev

And now will generate correctly the .deb file.

:

I specified FAT explicitly above because it does this if you don't specify. This is WoeUSB 3.3.0-11-g1a7b468, pulled from github yesterday.

## Expected Behavior

A presumably working USB installer

## Current Behavior

WoeUSB errors as above, complaining about a missing NTFS signature it should not have been trying to look for since it formatted the USB stick as FAT.

## Info of My Environment
### WoeUSB Version
v3.3.0-11-g1a7b468

### WoeUSB Source
Built from source on Debian sid (updated yesterday) with commit 1a7b4689

### GNU Bash Version
GNU bash, version 5.0.11(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

### Information about the Operating System
Distributor ID: Debian
Description:    Debian GNU/Linux bullseye/sid
Release:        unstable
Codename:       sid

### Information about the Source Media
A slipstream updated Windows 7 ISO. Trying to prepare for The End, since retrogaming is a thing.

### Information about the Target Device
SanDisk Cruzer Fit 16GB
My machine uses /media as a autofs endpoint, thereby making it impossible for WoeUSB to write to this path. The source path that WoeUSB create should be able to be user-defined instead of hardcoded to /media


We're about to move to the year 2020.
This software exists for a long time now.
You do support Mageia (weird judging by the amount of users), Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSuSe, but not RedHat and/or CentOS ?

Heck, there are even unofficial packages for Arch based distros, and someone has a Gentoo overlay that provides binaries even....

Using Ubuntu 18.04.3
Trying to make a Windows 10 USB, at 97% the process takes forever.
Dear WoeUSB,

Fedora 31, x64
Xfce 4.14.1
WoeUSB-3.3.0-1.fc31.x86_64
Kanguru ALK-FB30-8G, FlashBlu30, 8 GB, USB3.0 Flash Drive

Win10_1909_English_x64.iso, from
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO

The good new.  WoeUSB cuts a Windows 10 flash drive perfectly.  Even will boot off both  EUFI or Legacy BIOS’s too.  And Windows Ten install perfectly as well.  Class act.  If you are the author and are reading this, Thank You!

Now for the complaining.  What???  Complaining if fun!

1)  After cutting the flash drive from either the command line or the gui, WoeUSB crashes with error 256 and leaves the loop mount it used open.
   Command line:
   # woeusb --target-filesystem NTFS --device Win10_1809_English_x64.iso /dev/sd[x]

   Open loop:
    # df -kPT
    ...
    /dev/loop0 udf 5293786 5293786 0 100% /media/woeusb_source_1573623585_2757

2)   When the gui crashes, it opens a crash report window.  The windows has two problems:

    A)  The crash windows can not be copied into either the primary or the secondary clipboard.
    B)  The crash window has no scroll bar.  Instead it sizes the bottom of the window to match the length of the text.  This has the horrible effect of having the bottom of the window run off the bottom of your screen, maybe by about ten feet or so.

I have the facilities to test any fix you come up with, if that helps.

Many thanks,
-T

/dev/sdb

Same issue when using sudo or calling woeusbgui as su root.
Last time I made this work by not using this fork, just the original one mentioned in description.
The error invalid argument, in my woeusb version (woeusb/xenial,now 3.3.0-1~webupd8~xenial0 amd64) is related when echoing to the files below, what is no possible (even using sudo):
echo "${VM_DIRTY_BACKGROUND_BYTES}" > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_bytes
echo "${VM_DIRTY_BYTES}" > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_bytes

So, I've just commented this lines, and didn't get the related error - workaround_linux_make_writeback_buffering_not_suck:

Currently WoeUSB indirectly causes severely unresponsive system on 64-bit architecture with large primary memory during file copy process due to a flaw of the writeback buffer size handling in Linux kernel, workaround it before it is fixed

What file was it commented it out on specifically? I am having the same issue.
