upon launching the application, the menu works well, but the console gives me the message:
"changing property contentsGravity in transform-only layer, will have no effect"

Can you post an example using UICollectionView? TableView works fine, but menu didn't show for CollectionView.
When I attempt to set the revealed state, the initialized MenuView returns as a nil optional.

My code

``` swift
// TableViewController properties
var picker: MenuView {
    let m = MenuView()
    // Init other options and add items
    return m
}
// -----------------------
override func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) {
    picker.setRevealed(true, animated: true)
}
```

I have also tried setting m.revealed when initializing the property. I get the same error every time

Also good to note that this TVC is sometimes a child VC and sometimes not
