Hello,
my title sums it up, but here's the thing in detail:
1/ I parse xsd files into a list with 'XML2' library. :heavy_check_mark: 
2/ I take a sublist of the first list. :heavy_check_mark: 
3/ I want to turn it into data.tree. I try:
a/ simpleList: the non-leaf nodes are unnamed.
b/ explicitList: this only returns me a node named "root".
I'll upload an example in the next few minutes in my git, see the comments.
FromDataFrameNetwork converts the dataframe to a hierarchical network structure. I takes too long to convert to a network object when the number of points is too high. Is there a way to speed up the process.
```
data(acme)
acme$IT$name <- “ITNEW”
acme$IT
```
Hi, 

I would like to be able to change level names from unique IDs to human-readable tags in my tree structure. A sample of the tree:
> print(tjpCPI, "CPI.Tag")
                                levelName                          CPI.Tag
1   378257447                                                          CPI
2    ¦--378257497                                                     Food
3    ¦   ¦--378259447                                              Cereals
4    ¦   ¦   ¦--378259457                                             Rice
5    ¦   ¦   ¦   ¦--378259467                                Non Glutinous
6    ¦   ¦   ¦   ¦   ¦--378259477                                   Rice-A
7    ¦   ¦   ¦   ¦   °--378259487                                   Rice-B
8    ¦   ¦   ¦   °--378259497                                    Glutinous


I would like to swap the IDs in level names to the readable CPI.Tags

I am trying to use the Do function:
tjpCPI$Do(function(node) node$levelName<-node$CPI.Tag)
but that throws an error of:
Error in (function ()  : unused argument (quote("CPI"))

How might I go about changing the levelNames?

Thanks in advance!


Hi. 

I am trying to Find a node in a tree with non-unique names. 

Lets say, I have this - 
```
data(acme)
acme$Research$AddChild("IT")
```

When i use `FindNode(acme,"IT")` It is pointing to different ones in every time. Is there a way I can search only in specific level, may be in level 1 ?


Another thing, I am trying to create the tree programatically like this.


```
library(data.tree)
construct_tree <- function(x) {

  gq <- Node$new("sessions")
  for(i in 1:nrow(x)) {
    if(x[i,c("type")] != 'RECORD')
       gq$AddChild(x[i,c("name")])
    else{
      y <- as.data.frame(x[i,c('fields')])
      for(j in 1:nrow(y)){
      parent <- x[i,"name"] 
      parent$AddChild(y[j,c("name")])
  }
   }
  }
gq
}
```

But in this one, i keep getting `Error: $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors` . Is there a way I can use variable as node names ?

Thanks.
 
Is there a way to speed up this conversion, specifically with `ToNewick`? 

```
library(ape)
data(bird.families)
system.time(bf <- as.Node(bird.families))
system.time(n <- ToNewick(bf))
```
See #90 
Data.tree allows you to generate plots for trees very easily with the "plot" command. However, saving the resulting image in formats such as png, pdf, or jpeg fails (even using Rstudio). The issue was mentioned already on the web ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42108105/in-r-how-do-i-save-a-data-tree-plot-to-a-file) but the answers provided there did not work for me, so I have used screenshots for the time being. I will continue to look into the documentation from the inbuilt packages used by data.tree, but it would be nice eventually if some additional piece of code can be extracted for users of data.tree like me who appreciate the self-contained aspect of the package. 
On some machines when printing a tree the . is replaced by <U+00A6> <U+00B0>. See screenshot below. I haven't seen this on a mac but have on linux and windows. Any idea how to get the . to print appropriately?

Takes more time to generate nodes through as.node from a data.frame. Need to optimise for performance.
