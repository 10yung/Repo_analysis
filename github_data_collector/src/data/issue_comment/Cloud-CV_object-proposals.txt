While executing C:\...\Objectness Code\object-proposals-master\endres\proposals\generate_proposals.m, I'm getting the following error:

Hi Thanks for your effort on projects. But there are issues related to downloading. The downloading stops when it try to download aux file.. please check it. It tried it many times..
I got the following error at step 2 "initialize path variables" on Matlab R2016b 64-bit and Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit. 
```
Added json encoder/decoder to the path
-- Successful installation of MCG. Enjoy! --
Field assignment to a non-structure array object.

Error in spagglom_options (line 7)
opts.seg_method = 'slic'; % 'felz', 'slic' or 'qshift'. Two first recommended


Error in initialize (line 50)

I tried to check the variable opts, and got the following error:

Not quite sure what's going on, can somebody help and explain a little bit? Thanks. 
I'm trying to test a few of these methods using Ubuntu 16.04 and Matlab R2016a, but most of the methods are throwing errors. 

The 'edgeBoxes' method runs to completion and gives reasonable-looking results. Everything else fails:

randomPrim gives: Reference to non-existent field 'rSeedForRun'
mcg gives: Undefined function 'imResampleMex' for input arguments of type 'uint8'
endres gives: Error running calcendresforIm: Attempt to execute SCRIPT anigauss as a function:

etc etc. The errors seem so varied that I have a hard time believing they all share a single root cause, but the fact that one of the methods works makes me think that I've installed the package correctly. 

Any idea what's going on here? 

I had to manually install gcc-4.7 and g++-4.7 to get compile.m to run without errors, by the way. 

Fixed some latent issues that would probably be working in latest versions of Matlab, but do not work in Matlab 2012. These issues ensure backward compatibility.

Added Geodesic Object proposal. 

I tried running rigor on a single image. I get this error: Latha will look into it..
