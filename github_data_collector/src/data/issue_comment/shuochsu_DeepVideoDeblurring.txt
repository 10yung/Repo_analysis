Hi Shuochen,
    May I ask which folders in quantitative_datasets are captured by iPhone 6s? We need a training dataset captured all by one device.
   Thank you very much!
I'm an undergraduate student from UESTC. And I'm working on my graduation project on this topic. In my early learning stage, I want to try retraining your net. So, I'd like to ask is it possible to publish the training data preparation code and training code? 
The work is being done on my forked repo https://github.com/pidan1231239/DeepVideoDeblurring in public. And I'm currently trying to rewrite those unpublished codes. If it's possible, it will certainly save me a lot of time.
Hi! I'm hh. 
Thanks for reply previous question.
I simulate your algorithm, and I'm trying to retrain the algorithm with other training set.
Could I get the training code?
Thanks!
HH
