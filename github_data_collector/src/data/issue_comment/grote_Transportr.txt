Hello,

As some of you may know, we're facing a month long strike of transportation in France.

For Paris, everyday the public transport company (RATP) is publishing the state of the network for the next day. But even thought it may change on the actual day depending of the situation and unions will.

Since the beginning of the strike i had unfortunately to switch to another application (citymapper) because they include the realtime situation strike included and this option was not available on Transportr. Transportr was even offering me routes through lines that were/are completely closed.

As strike is the national favorite hobby in France, i'd love to find this kind of option in my favorite transport application.

Is it something possible ? Planned ?

Best regards,

I came across Transportr (through [a tweet from Matthias Kirschner](https://twitter.com/kirschner/status/1210444343045230592)). It looks lovely, thank you so much for your efforts and for releasing it as free software!

[ I realize that the following is not a bug, nor a Transportr issue per se. I thought it was still good to share this and thought this was the most appropriate place but forgive me if I'm wasting your time. ]

I live in Athens, Greece, and unfortunately there is no coverage of that in Transportr. I'm not an Android developer, but comfortable with sending PRs, so I read through your contributing instructions in order to see whether I could contribute this. If I understand it correctly, the process is:
1. Find GTFS feeds for local transport agencies (easy enough, found them!)
1. Send an email to Navitia's Google Group asking them to be added. Wait until this happens, or alternatively, set up a Navitia instance locally (which doesn't seem trivial).
1. (Optional) Send an MR, with Java code, implementing some bits of the transport agency logic(?), to the the public-transport-enabler staging _GitLab_ repo.
1. Send the same PR to to the public-transport-enabler GitHub repo. Wait until this gets merged(?).
1. Send a PR to Transportr to add the provider. That should be code (in Kotlin?) alongside the agency's vector logo.

I'm not proficient in Java and I don't know Kotlin. To add to that, I also have no idea how I would test if any of the above work, besides setting up an Android development environment, and building Transportr + public-transport-enabler locally and deploying it on my phone. That... would probably take me several days of effort.

I'd love to use this project, and would be happy to do a drive-through contribution! Unfortunately, the bar is set pretty high right now. It sounds like the responsibilities (and data) are scattered across multiple projects, so not necessarily something that you could fix alone. I don't have any bright suggestions myself! If I can think of a couple, maybe not-so-bright ideas:
- Move more of the Transportr logic outside of code (Kotlin) and into a data format (like YAML?). Maybe accompany it with a simple validator that one can run before submitting?
- Accompany the app with a simple CLI that one could build that would test public-transport-enabler and test whether a patch works before submitting it. Would avoid one needing to be familiar with Android development. Maybe add simple-to-use instructions on how to build this CLI (e.g. with Docker?)

Thanks again -- and no hard feelings if you decide this is out of scope and declined as an issue outright.
**Describe the bug**
When you're zooming in, the zoom starts delayed by around 0.5s and the zoom-in or out is weird, it just zooms out to the entire country, it's too sensitive for zoom out-in i believe and sometimes it does not immediately respond.
Maybe some sort of optional zoom-slider could be better.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
If your current route has many stops and you don't know the route well it's hard to find the current station.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be useful if the nearest stop according to the current location would be highlighted in the list of stops.

**Additional context**

I think, Öffi does this, too.
**Describe the bug**
In VGN-Network there seem to be some "broken" stations. Every time you search for a route from or to such a station, you can see the error message below. I think more and more stations have this problem... Deleting the app data fixes the problem.

Moved from schildbach/public-transport-enabler#286

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to Search-Route-View
2. Enter a "broken" stop
3. See error

**Expected behavior**
A route should be calculated.

As remarked by @grote in https://github.com/grote/Transportr/pull/627#discussion_r341580219: 

> These visibility changes on swiping in the trip details view in https://github.com/grote/Transportr/blob/4a1f997bea61490fe5eac1d668ac7b6feb6a3adf/app/src/main/java/de/grobox/transportr/trips/detail/TripDetailFragment.kt#L144-L171 appear a bit rough in the UI. Should be easy to use a object animator instead here to make things more smooth.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I think it would be great if the means of transport could be saved for each favorite trip (as well as the possibility of saving a general means of transport settings for the app)

For example:
I take the bus in the morning. I use the app to check which bus number arrives first at my bus stop. I don't really want to see solutions that use trains etc but right now I have to edit that manually every time. On the other hand, on my way to the gym I need a bus + a subway so I need to manually select only those 2.
Both these trips are saved as favorite but I have to manually check/uncheck the means of transport every time for each of them.

Thank you.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I think it would be great if each favorite trip could also have its own mean of transport preference.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
No alternatives except to at least be able to save general preferences for the menas of transport (unless you consider this another feature request). In this case the preference would be applied to the whole app, for any search I'll do.

**Describe the bug**
Hi I often have time issues with the app. I'm on android 9. As example you can see below. The time is set to "now" but I only get 1 result, the latter are for tomorrow early morning (I guess) so are not relevant. I'm not sure if this is related to the app or public-transport-enabler (I've also opened another issue there with results problems but this one sound like might be more related with transporttr. The other issue - Just in case - https://github.com/schildbach/public-transport-enabler/issues/285)

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Add addresses for departure/ arrival
2. Click on search
3. Scroll down to see results

**Expected behavior**
I expect to see various combinations of transports to get me from departure to destination, from now onwards (I don't understand why it displays past trips), at least 5-8 results. Please check same route on https://tfl.gov.uk to see expected results

**Screenshots**

**Describe the bug**

Hi, 
my screenshot will help you with a simple example what I would like suggest to improve.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29168011/64491505-7ce08a00-d269-11e9-8081-a9aa65e286b6.jpg" width="270">

When I search for a specific street, in this example just 'Mönckebergstr. 31' (in Hamburg, Germany),
as seen, the app suggest several close locations, but also unrelated stuff. Moreover, the app suggest the target, but ranks it to the **8th place** of the list. In between are locations which might interest me, but I don't expext them to be previous to the actual target I typed into the search bar.

Even more, sometimes I have to scroll the list to choose such a specific street/target. Some users might think the app couldn't find the target.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Search for a specific street with a street number.
2. Watch the search results.
3. The app likely does not rank the acutal street to the very top results.
(No error)

**Expected behavior**
Search result with street numbers should have a higher ranking. Don't show unrelated results before.

**Screenshots**
See above.

**Versions:**
 - **Transportr Version:** 2.0.6
 - **Device:** HTC One M7
 - **Android Version:** Xenon HD, Android 7.1.2

Eventually realted: **Let specify street number on search** #559
