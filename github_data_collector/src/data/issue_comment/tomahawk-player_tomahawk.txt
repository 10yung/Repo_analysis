Use Github Actions to build and push image
As the project come to an halt, infrastructure is is not maintained. 
The Tomahawk-player.org website should be made static and moved to github.io


Does tomahawk still work?  If so, are they any special steps (different branches?) to get a working version or Tomahawk other than the recommendations in the `README.md`. 

I mainly want to aggregate Spotify, Google Much, Amazon Music, and Apple Music.

Are these `tomahawk-resolvers`repo resolvers optional are they need to be installed to? If so, how to install them?

PS. I'm running `Tomahawk-latest.dmg`. I'm also trying to build Tomahawk from source by have some minor issues with deps.

Cool project!

Hi,
Hours of research lead me here, to the only software I found that listed to work on Ubuntu & android with the ability to play & sync my media files but it's abandoned !  are there any active forks or alternatives ? 
Thanks.
As it is now there is no way of knowing from the [website](https://www.tomahawk-player.org) that this project has been [abandoned](https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk/commit/c8389592488c07079f40e7edb9195cfabbc58740#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8). Even just stating on the download page that the last version was released Apr 15, 2015 would be a big help.
...Just to say....
How can this script be installed on Centos 7 ?
Unable to build from source for Debian Jessie due to unsatisfied dependency for libtag1c2a.
