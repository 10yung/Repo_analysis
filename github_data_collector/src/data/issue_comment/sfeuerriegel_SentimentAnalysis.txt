* is it Proellochs or Pr√∂llochs (check lines 93 & 94)?
Hi Stefan,

Thanks to issue #2 I know how to add a new dictionary if available. Do you happen to know a German dictionary somewhere that can be used in this package? I found [this](https://github.com/MechLabEngineering/Tatort-Analyzer-ME/tree/master/SentiWS_v1.8c) one. It seems allright except for the lack of adjectives. They all seem nouns. Many thanks in advance!
