Some params are not defined ,how should I run the code?
you said the dots where spaced 2mm and had a diameter of 1mm,The main bars are 3, respectively 2 dots large,so if i largen the size of dots to 10 times. the  dx  dy default in the autocalibrate.m need to be change from 2 to 20? am i right?thank you.the attachment is a calibration pattern made by myself and the dots size is 20mm.
function call: (handeye.m > line: 105)
[Hcam2marker_, err] = TSAIleastSquareCalibration(Hm2w2, Hcam2grid2)

function definition: (TSAIleastSquareCalibration.m > line: 30)
function [Hcam2marker_, err] = TSAIleastSquareCalibration(Hmarker2world, Hgrid2cam)

Here it is not clear whether Hcam2grid is to be used or its inverse Hgrid2cam.
Same is the problem with other function calls for the different algorithms listed.

-------------------------------------

Also, why the inverse is taken two times here: (handeye.m > lines: 77-78)
Hgrid2cam(:,:,correctSets) = inv(([Rc Tc;[ 0 0 0 1]]));
Hcam2grid(:,:,correctSets) = inv(Hgrid2cam(:,:,correctSets));
The variable active_images is missing

where should I get the calibration pattern to run the autocalibrate.m? Because the pattern should have the black bar to check the axis. Or could you please send me the pattern? Thank you very much.
