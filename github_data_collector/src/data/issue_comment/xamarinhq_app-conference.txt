Any chance this would be updated to support Xamarin Forms 4, Shell, and newer items like Xamarin Essentials?

A customer reported that after updating the nuget packages, the build was failing. 

I traced the errors down to three changes in Xamarin.Essentials:

1. **DataTransfer** type was renamed to **Share**
2.  **Clipboard.SetText**(...) was renamed to **Clipboard.SetTextAsync**(...)
3. Connectivity.ConnectivityChanged event handler signature was changed from:
**protected async void ConnectivityChanged (ConnectivityChangedEventArgs e)**
to 
**protected async void ConnectivityChanged (object sender, ConnectivityChangedEventArgs e)**

Hello, 

I am looking at exploring the app but I am stuck at a place now: 

app-conference/src/Conference.Backend/Web.config 

There is mention of aspnet-Conference.Backend-20151029080950.mdf file which I am unable to find. I reached this file while looking to setup my own backend locally. 

I would appreciate if someone can assist on this further, please.
Dear colleagues,
I am trying to enrich this project with accessibility elements. I can not deal with the problem of describing the HamburgerMenu button. Please help. How can I set the ContentDescription for this item? Thanks for help!
The authentication used to work with Xamarin.com ids, but, now it does not recognize this id or a current Microsoft.com ID.  Is the authentication path still functional?
Xamarin.GooglePlayServices.Base version in metadata is old and when we update also does not work, downgrade to one in metadata won't work. 

We constantly get this following error.

Did not find reference matching RestoreAssemblyResources Assembly Name metadata 'Xamarin.GooglePlayServices.Basement'

Any idea how to fix?
