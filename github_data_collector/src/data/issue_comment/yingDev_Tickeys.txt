It would be better if it automatically start when it turn on
作者加油
Hello I've been enjoying this app for like 1 year but after update to mac catalina sounds no longer bump out . 

Keep up the nice work !


Thank you.
I appreciate for using this app, I love this!

But , I'd like to want the function which when we type a key continual, sound effects arises.

If we delete some characters, we hold down a button , but a single sound arises only.

Is this possible ?

Thank you.
我很喜欢打字机里回车的音效，但是用这个打字会感觉有一定延迟，而且有时候会有一点吵，我希望它只捕捉回车键，这样用起来感觉很好，而且可能还会减少延迟。
用电脑播放声音时，插上耳机不能在耳机播放按键音
或者用二级播放声音时，拔出耳机电脑不能播放按键音
现在每次合盖之后都需要再次启动Tickeys
This app listed as "preventing sleep" on activity monitor and i think this should be fixed
Hi,

I am using Tickeys version 0.5.0 on OSX High Sierra version 10.13.3.

The program works well in general, but when I type in iTerm.app, I get no sound. I have tried each Audio Fx, but none of them work in iTerm. They all do work in all other kinds of apps (for example, Chrome, Atom, Thunderbird, ...)

Is this a known issue? And if so, will it be fixed?

Thanks in advance :)
开机时提示一次没有问题，但是每次从睡眠状态恢复过来时都提示一次，这样通知中心就很多提示了。
可否考虑增加一个通知开关？
ps: 我用的mac系统
