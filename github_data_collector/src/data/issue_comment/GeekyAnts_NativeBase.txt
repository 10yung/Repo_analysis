<!-- **DO** fill out the below form to give us a better idea about your environment and help us debug it quicker. Issues without the required details will mostly be closed.-->

#### node, npm, react-native, react and native-base version, expo version if used, xcode version

Throwing an error: text strings must be rendered in a `<Text>` component when the `<Text>` component is used inside a `<Button>` component. However the error doesn't occur for web view

#### Steps to reproduce
I have isolated the issue  and here is the snak link (https://snack.expo.io/Skfyu4l_U). And here is the console log of the my test rect native app: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/GgQWCBFChz/

## Issue Description
The ripple effect of `rounded` `Button`'s goes beyond the button container on some Android devices:
![Screenshot_20200115-133003](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28528363/72434930-20ecbb80-379d-11ea-862a-ecced81ce091.jpg)

I've created [this snack](https://snack.expo.io/S17BwF3lL) and it works in the Appetize web Android emulator, but it doesn't work on my OnePlus 5T with Oxygen 9.0.9.
>

The issue has already been addressed [here](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/issues/2596), but has been closed. 

#### node, npm, react-native, react and native-base version, expo version if used, xcode version
"expo": "34.0.0"

#### Expected behaviour
The ripple effect goes beyond the button container.

#### Actual behaviour
The ripple effect stays within the button.

#### Steps to reproduce
See previous linked snack. The error happens with this code:
```
<Button rounded>
    <Text>Click Me!</Text>
</Button>
```

#### Is the bug present in both iOS and Android or in any one of them?
Some Android devices, so far only reproduced on OnePlus 5T.

#### node, npm, react-native, react and native-base version, expo version if used, xcode version
native-base-version : 2.13.8,

#### Expected behaviour
Toggling a checkbox in vue, when the checkbox list is rendered using v-for. And v-bind:checked is set using a key of object, should not go into infinite loop (I tried using:checked.sync also, same result).

#### Actual behaviour
Toggling checkbox when using `:checked="obj.is_selected" :onPress="toggleCheck(obj)". ` if in toggleCheck function i set obj.is_selected = !obj.is_selected it is going in infinite loop and page does not load. 
I get this error - 
```
You may have an infinite update loop in render function.

  methods: {
    togglePackage(pack) {
      pack.is_selected = !pack.is_selected; // THIS Runs into infinite loop
    },
    toggleSwitch1() {
      this.checkbox1 = !this.checkbox1; // THIS WORKS FINE
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

#### Is the bug present in both iOS and Android or in any one of them?
Yes

Since there are only two props, checked and onPress, i am not sure, how is it possible to properly set checked in such case without using an individual variable for every checkbox.
