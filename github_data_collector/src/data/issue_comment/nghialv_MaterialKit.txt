Ripple effect was added to button and upon navigation back to same view, the mask is still visible

Since the repo is no longer maintained, use this in your Podfile instead:

```ruby
pod 'MaterialKit', :git => 'https://github.com/ApolloZhu/MaterialKit.git'
```

or in your Package.swift:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/ApolloZhu/MaterialKit.git",
         .upToNextMinor(from: "0.6.6")),
```

This version is compatible, theoretically, with any version from Swift 3 to 5 (solve #63 and #72)

<summary>This implementation also removed the strong reference cycles (which are causing memory leaks).</summary>

I'm aware of this [issue](https://github.com/LiulietLee/Pick-Color/issues/2) a long time ago, but had no idea why just declaring superLayer as `weak` causes unexpected crashes. Thanks to @theMeatloaf for his solutions in Swift 2, we only need to manually remove the observers by calling `recycle` method of MKLayer and MKRefreshControl if a class owns such properties directly. I can't figure out a way for us to automatically remove the observers, especially when the time `deinit` of MKLayer gets called, superLayer is already nil. Therefore, if you have a better solution, please definitely help.

And yes, in addition to MKLayer and all other classes that has a property of type MKLayer,  MKRefreshControl has [strong reference loop](https://github.com/nghialv/MaterialKit/blob/master/Source/MKRefreshControl.swift#L14) and [observer](https://github.com/nghialv/MaterialKit/blob/master/Source/MKRefreshControl.swift#L55) not removed, and MKSwitch has a [strong reference loop](https://github.com/nghialv/MaterialKit/blob/master/Source/MKSwitch.swift#L179), too.

Add support to Swift3 and xcode 8

This should allow you to build on Xcode 8 with swift 2.3 to resolve #61.  Swift 3 will need to come next
