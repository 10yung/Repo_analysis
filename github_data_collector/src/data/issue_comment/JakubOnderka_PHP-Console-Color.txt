### These changes are unbreaking

my PR suggests:
### Add
 - adding new protected method `checkIfTerminalColorIsSupported()` called from `__construct()` to set `$this->isSupported` var
### Change
- method `isSupported()` now returns value of `$this->isSupported`

### Tests output
```
PHPUnit 4.8.36 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

### Details
Method `isSupported()` called each time we apply style to text - [ConsoleColor.php:Line86](https://github.com/JakubOnderka/PHP-Console-Color/blob/f725c01cfd5c29005919850c1502066149dc1117/src/ConsoleColor.php#L86)
```php
   if (!$this->isStyleForced() && !$this->isSupported()) {
```
but every time we do  this method checks terminal for color support
```php
public function isSupported()
    {
        if (DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR === '\\') {
            if (function_exists('sapi_windows_vt100_support') && @sapi_windows_vt100_support(STDOUT)) {
                return true;
            } elseif (getenv('ANSICON') !== false || getenv('ConEmuANSI') === 'ON') {
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        } else {
            return function_exists('posix_isatty') && @posix_isatty(STDOUT);
        }
    }
```

I inherited this package as part of an existing project that was started in Laravel 5.3.   We're reviewing packages, and I discovered that no documentation I can find explains what this package does.  I checked Packagist.org, and this git repo. It'd be nice to understand a bit about why this package is useful. 

Thank you.
