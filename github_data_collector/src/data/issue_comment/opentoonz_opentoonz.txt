Obviously not a huge deal, I can simply not use the comma key at the numpad, but it would be nice if it can be changed.

This PR fixes #2710 by switching just the Ease In and Ease Out labels in the Function Editor as they were assigned to the wrong edit boxes.

Spanish translations were switched to match up to the English text since they were intentionally switched to correct the discrepancy.
### Issue Summary
At the point you create a Toonz Raster or Raster level, a file is created on disk. When you create a Toonz Vector level it isn't until you hit save.

In the attached recording you can see that I have to press Save All to create the files on disk for the vector level. This inconsistency is confusing to users and could potentially result in users losing data.

### Issue Summary
I couldn't find the Delete unused styles command in the right-click menu, I had to set it to a shortcut.

### Steps to Reproduce
Right-click in the palette, there's no option (for me at least).

### Expected Results
For it to be a right-click menu item in the palette.

### Additional Context
I could almost swear it used to be there, so it could be user error.
### Issue Summary
I don't understand why this basic functionality hasn't been implemented. From the popup dialog, hitting create project creates all of the folders necessary for a new project, including saving the project file. Why does hitting create scene not save the scene file? Clearly there's something I'm missing, but it confuses many users. You have to create a drawing level and hit save all to save the scene (and update the application header bar). Consistency would give users more comfort in using the application.

In the attached clip you can see that after creating the project, the project name is shown in the application header, but on creating the scene, the scene name shows as Untitled41.

There was some work already completed, but left commented out (I'm guessing because it needs more testing) in this PR: https://github.com/opentoonz/opentoonz/pull/2875

Here's the location for that in code: https://github.com/opentoonz/opentoonz/blob/98a68d5c9b720890d06406ba92f5643250cf6052/toonz/sources/toonz/startuppopup.cpp#L507

### Expected Results
On clicking Create Scene, I'd expect the scene name to show in the application header.
And if we choose to do so, for the scene file to be created on disk.
However, considering the conversation in #3036, we might not want the scene file saved, but the header should definitely update as feedback to the user.

### Issue Summary
<!-- Please provide a brief description of your issue -->
Please enable the new stop motion controls #2635 for macOS and Linux too. This is too helpful of a feature to be limited to Windows only! 

Assuming this will not happen in time for the 1.4 release, it will be important for the release notes to specify that the Canon DSLR & stop motion support is currently a Windows only feature.
