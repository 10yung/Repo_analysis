As it may have been apparent by my long reaction time to PRs and issues, I haven't spend too much time working on this package in the last years. And I plan to keep it that way, hence I won't really look at PRs and issues anymore. Take a look at [x/image/draw](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/image/draw) or [gopkg.in/gographics/imagick.v2/imagick](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/gographics/imagick.v2/imagick) for packages that offer image resizing and much more.
Use sub sample ratio from the input image instead of hardcoding it.
this is the original image:

after resizing it to 1024, image not show on mobile browser:
