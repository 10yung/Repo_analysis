When tmate -C is used, the window is resized to 80x24.

This makes it difficult to use [control mode](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Control-Mode) for scripting as it has a visible effect on the target session.

```
tmate -C # at
```

```
%begin 1579205831 1 0
%end 1579205831 1 0
%window-add @0
%sessions-changed
%session-changed $0 0
%layout-change @0 b25d,80x24,0,0,0 b25d,80x24,0,0,0 *
%window-renamed @0 [tmux]
%layout-change @0 b21d,70x24,0,0,0 b21d,70x24,0,0,0 *
```
I used to be able to leave tmate on for days - now when I try to connect I get the following:

```
The session host disconnected x hours ago.
Hopefully it will reconnect soon.
```

It doesn't seem to ever reconnect. I have to restart tmate.

Is it a change to the client, server or just my connection?
even after updating apt-get:

```sh
apt-get update
```

I still getting the old version `2.2.1`, not the one `2.4.0` - what is need to update `apt-get-repository`
Hullo :)

I use `tmate` to provide secure reverse-SSH facilities. I trigger `tmate` on a target device and pass the `ssh` string back through MQTT messages - it works really well thanks to your excellent work :)

I'd like to be able to use that `ssh` string to execute a pre-set command, just like I might do with regular ssh, but with tmate it's not working... e.g.

```
$ ssh CxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKL@lon1.tmate.io date
Invalid command
```

How should I pass a single command to the waiting `tmate` session?
There's already a dockerfile. This will allow people to do something like this in their own dockerfiles:
```
FROM tmate-io/tmate AS tmate
FROM actual_base_image AS base
COPY --from=tmate /build/tmate /bin/tmate
...
Rest of dockerfile
````
Instead of hard-coding the config file to ~/.tmate.conf, could we add multiple places to check for the config file? It would be useful to me to be able to have a company-local package that installs a config file to something like /etc/tmate.conf with our own settings.
Hello,

It's possible to use tmate as a Git remote to update bare repositories?

i. e. `git remote add tmate ssh://username/session@ssh.tmate.io/path/to/bare/repo`

I tried some times here, but not worked...

I receive errors like this when I execute `git push tmate master`:

```
ssh: Could not resolve hostname {username}: Name or service not known
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.
```

Thanks!
Seeing [lost server] immediately on running tmate in Ubuntu 19.10
Hello,
In my ssh configuration file, I've
``
Host *
``
`` Port 22``
In this case, tmate tries to connect to port 22 even with ``set -g tmate-server-port "xxxx"`` in .tmate.conf.

IMHO, either tmate should ignore local ssh config or should be able to use a specific ssh configuration block.
Kinds regards,
The following configuration seems to be an issue with tmate. When using the prefic `C-\`, tmate seems to not register that binding. This is not an issue in tmux.

```
# Set prefix command to Control-\ and secondary to Control-b
set-option -g prefix 'C-\'

# C-\ C-\ jumps to the last open window
bind-key C-\ last-window
```
