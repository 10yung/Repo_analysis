It seems like Trilium messes up the order of the sub folders in the root after a large import. I like to do manual ordering of my root folders based on my own priority however Trilium does not like that here and there and resets the order, I cant thell if the rset is based on date or alphabetical because I have alot of folders with custom characters.

it would be nice if Trilium holds onto the custom order no matter what is going on.

thanks

Hi

It seems like when I look at the same file in the Win desktop  and Firefox(via login) I see that the browser version has syntax hilight support for markdown (like in Joplin) but the desktop app does not have it.

The browser version is the one I compiled locally on Linux (from the repo).  And the Browser is FF 71 on Linux.

See the image for some sample code page comparison (left is browser, right is win desktop app)

> Trilium Version 0.39.3

It appears that after the 12th row of a table the background colour changes to a lighter colour, identical to the base colour of the page.

I think you have an awesome software and I really love it. I have a couple of suggestions to allow it to be used by more people/less tech people. Some of those people in the community could help build):
- Information website: can be static with links to the latest binaries, but at least it gives some internet presence and better SEO
- Sponsor link in github or another way to make donations
- Signed builds on OSX: it does cost money though, but I am sure the community can find 110USD per year for that. I think it is necessary to publish on brew?
- Installers: (speaking for osx, I didn't check other OS) we usually expect a DMG. Since this is usually an annoying job, it could be automated with github actions or similar.
- (long term) Provide hosted servers: I am not sure if you want to keep it as a hobby, but there is a market for that. I myself looked at notion and decided against it because it doesn't have offline mode and it's not open source, but I would pay for an hosted solution (with client-side encryption if possible).

Anyway those are just suggestions, what is already there is really amazing! I plan to write a blog once I get more familiar with the software and I think other people should too.
I know a while ago this was remove, but I feel like a small link preview would be really a plus. Maybe it could be a code integration? I just started using your amazing app, so I don't know yet.
Something like what mylinkpreview does:

you have sort alphabetically can you add sort newest/oldest.  Sometimes I want to have the most recent things in the list first, other times the oldest.
I've nearly anything I need in Trilium, but I'd like to know if it's possible to implement notion like database?

It's based on a simple table, but with lots of functionality behind the scene: https://www.notion.so/Intro-to-databases-fd8cd2d212f74c50954c11086d85997e

Every row is a block (as everything is a block in notion), that can have many attributes, and could queried like a DB, with different way of visualizing it.

How to you think it's implementable? With a note for every row?
I do not remember having this issue before. Apperantly Firefox is using this port so not much I can do about this. Any way to change this?

`trilium 
Generated sourceId=gRy91BDToB3T
Port 37840 is already in use
`
I spend half of my time in trilium pasting URLs. Therefore, they are not converted to links automatically, which is annoying.

So each time i paste a link, i need to:
1. highlight the link
2. press Ctrl+C
3. press Ctrl+K
4. press Ctrl+V

Converting pasted links to web-links automatically would be a great time saver
Hope to integrate [https://github.com/jgraph/drawio](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) , which provide diagrams very well, then we can do more thing in trilium.

Thanks , trilium is an amazing software.
