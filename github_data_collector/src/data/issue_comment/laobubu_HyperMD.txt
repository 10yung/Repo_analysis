请问怎么传入自定义的主题和代码高亮啊
Hi there,

Such a robust looking editor! Wow!

I was looking into possibly using HyperMD as an Atom package, to handle Markdown files there, and even allow Atom to be used thereby as a kind of general purpose editor.

As such, I'd be interested in providing a WYSIWYG that may, by default, be less intimidating to non-technical users, who might be confused by why the `#` marks appear when clicking a heading, etc.

Although I doubt this would be easily possible, just in case this is somehow feasible or of interest, I wanted to suggest allowing a pure WYSIWYG mode which avoided the ability to introspect (albeit in a WYSIWYG-ish fashion) on the Markdown, and only appeared something like CKEditor--such a word processor, maybe with an Advanced mode button to add the informative Markdown indicators.

In any case, thanks for the excellent looking tool!
When the cursor leaves the editor, the edited element does not rerender to html.

Is there a function to call so that the document will do a refresh on blur?

Great project! I've been looking for something like this to fork for a while ;-) Any chance you'll add multi-caret editing? This is one of the main functionalities I miss in most MD editors.
It is ok to upload image via drag but when i Upload Images and files via clipboard, it don't work. And I got ![image.png](error) 
我按照快速开始中的代码：
```
var HyperMD = require("hypermd")
// hypermd 模块会引入 codemirror 和一堆 css 文件

// 如果需要为特殊元素添加语法高亮，请载入对应的模式
require("codemirror/mode/htmlmixed/htmlmixed") // Markdown 内嵌HTML
require("codemirror/mode/stex/stex") // TeX 数学公式
require("codemirror/mode/yaml/yaml") // Front Matter

// 如果需要用第三方库增强 HyperMD 功能，请载入所需的 PowerPacks
require("hypermd/powerpack/fold-math-with-katex") // 将会自动引入 "katex"
require("hypermd/powerpack/hover-with-marked") // 将会自动引入 "marked"
// 你还可以再此添加其他 power packs...
// Power packs 需要第三方库，别忘记安装它们！

var myTextarea = document.getElementById("myTextarea")
var cm = HyperMD.fromTextArea(myTextarea, {
  /* 在此添加其他编辑器选项 */
  hmdModeLoader: false, // 见下面的备注
})
```
发现html的表格不能渲染：

我在代码里只找到一个sm.ms写死的ajaxupload路径，不能配置吗？
First, thank you for such an innovative library. 

Currently, the markdown support is amazing, and for those of us that know markdown syntax well, this library works really well. However, for those not familiar with markdown, they may feel lost.

A toolbar can be as simple as the toolbar in Github, or something like Notion.io where you type in the @ symbol to reveal a list of options to add, although the list of options doesn't work that great with marking up existing text.
I have found that some Github Flavored Mode (GFW) features are not supported:

1. Automatic linking for URLs;
2. SHA references;
3. Some emoji's are not displayed.

Are these known issues?
