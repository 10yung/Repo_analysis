Hi I am getting "epoll_wait: Bad file descriptor". this causes my application to close.
Hi，I have a doubt，Usually the udp connection is always writable，but If I add the udp connection write event to epoll via ev_io_start, then when can trigger a writable event ?
I am confused about this line of code:

````c
#define VARx(type,name) VAR(name, type name)
````
I searched the entire project， and can‘t find definition of macro **VAR(name, type name)**,  could you please make a short explain? @enki 
after patch, successfully compiled using:
arm-linux-androideabi-gcc (GCC) 4.9.x 20150123 (prerelease)

I watch a file via inotify, when it is updated, i open it via
ev_io_init(..), and ev_io_start();
when all data is read, i close the file ev_io_stop(..), close(fd)

if a other inotify event is comming, when i open the file with:
ev_io_init(..), and ev_io_start();

in this time, the callback is not called, i need to call it explicitly via ev_invoke(...); 
but this is a bad solution, if the file is huge, this will block all my other events watchers (timers, sockets, signals ...etc)
