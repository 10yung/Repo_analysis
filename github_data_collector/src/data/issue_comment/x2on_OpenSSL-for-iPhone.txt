When I try to compile for Mac Catalyst I'm getting these errors.

`Building for Mac Catalyst, but the linked library 'libssl.a' was built for iOS + iOS Simulator. You may need to restrict the platforms for which this library should be linked in the target editor, or replace it with an XCFramework that supports both platforms.`
this script is working perfect .. but I need to compile it with -fvisibility=hidden to hide the symbols.. so could plz share script with this compile option  or point where to set this flag in the script file ?
It would be useful to have a `--debug` flag that conveniently sets appropriate config options for debug builds (e.g. `no-asm -g3 -O0 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fno-inline-functions`). 

With that flag set it would also be great to keep the `src` content around after the build, to make it simple to step into OpenSSL code when debugging in xcode.
