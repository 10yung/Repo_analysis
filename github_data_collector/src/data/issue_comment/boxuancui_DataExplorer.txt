Hi,
When you use `plot_missing`, colors associated with good, bad, OK, remove changed regarding the content of the data:

```
library(DataExplorer)

df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100), z = rnorm(100), a = rnorm(100), b = rnorm(100))

plot_missing(df)# good in red
```

```
df$x[1:4] = NA
df$z[91:100] = NA

plot_missing(df)# good in red, OK in blue
```

```
df$a[40:80] = NA

plot_missing(df)# good in green, bad in red, OK in an other blue
```

It would be more understandable to have a fixed color code.

Thanks



Hello,
First, thank you for your awesome product. I really appreciate the data exploration tool you've put together.

I'm trying to figure out if certain functionality exists. I'm running DataExplorer v 0.8.0. 

I have the following dataframe:
```
Classes ‘tbl_df’, ‘tbl’ and 'data.frame':	32 obs. of  7 variables:
 $ group          : Factor w/ 2 levels "amber","blue": 1 2 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 ...
 $ ess_score      : num  13 14 9 12 1 3 11 8 5 8 ...
 $ rpcsq_rpq3     : num  2 4 2 3 5 0 6 4 0 0 ...
 $ rpcsq_rpq13    : num  4 16 19 2 16 4 15 23 12 16 ...
 $ rpcsq_cognitive: num  0 4 8 0 6 2 2 10 6 7 ...
 $ rpcsq_somatic  : num  6 14 13 3 15 2 12 10 6 6 ...
 $ rpcsq_emotional: num  0 2 0 2 0 0 7 7 0 3 ...
```

I'd like to produce ess x rpcsq scatterplots (5 scatterplots) with the points colored by group. I've tried the following:

```
> plot_scatterplot(tmp, by = "ess_score")
``` 

This works but obviously doesn't color the points. The following code however fails to produce the plots:

```
> plot_scatterplot(tmp, by = "ess_score", geom_point_args = list(col = "group"))
Error in grDevices::col2rgb(colour, TRUE) : invalid color name 'group'
> plot_scatterplot(tmp, by = "ess_score", geom_point_args = list(col = group))
Error in do.call("geom_point", geom_point_args) : 
  object 'group' not found
> plot_scatterplot(tmp, by = "ess_score", geom_point_args = list(group = "group", col = "group"))
Error in grDevices::col2rgb(colour, TRUE) : invalid color name 'group'
```

Does the functionality I'm looking for exist in the current iteration of DataExplorer? Thanks for any help you can be.
* Discrete features with 1 category
* Features with near-zero variance
* TBD

Add this to `introduce` + `plot_intro`, or create a new function?
When data gets too messy, JS charts will be easier to view.
I want to add colors to graphs generated by DataExplorer, and I'm particularly into the viridis palettes. Is there any way for me to add them?

Thank you!

For datasets with many features, multiple pages are returned.

When visualizing in presentation format, it would be neat to be able to plot page by page to fit the slides. Currently one needs to subset the dataframe by hand, e.g. data[, 1:15] and data[, 16:30].
