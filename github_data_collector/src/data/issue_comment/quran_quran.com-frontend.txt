Assalamu Alaikum,

I am very pleased to see the progress you have made towards the up keep of this website by the grace of Allah Subahana Watalla. One feature which I will suggest is the addition of annotation of the Qur'an. There are many Khatibs and Scholars of Islam who strive to bring conversations of the verses of the Qur'an. I believe that these contributions should be compiled and made view able to users of this website so that we all can better understand the Qur'an. Of course, the integrity of the Khatibs and Scholars should be fact checked.

I encourage you check out this page as an example: https://genius.com/17944294

Jazakallah Kairun
Assalam o Alaikum,

I have found an issue that transliteration is not shown in the tooltip in chrome even if change tooltip display from translation to transliteration.
