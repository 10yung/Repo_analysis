Hi,
With regards to the recent announcement by Google. 
https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-to-phase-out-user-agent-strings-in-chrome/

>**Google to phase out user-agent strings in Chrome Chrome will move to a new technology called Client Hints, part of the newer Privacy Sandbox project.**


**Current**

```
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
            AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)
            Chrome/79.0.3945.117 Safari/537.36
```

**NEW**

```
Sec-CH-UA: "Chrome 79.0.3945.117"
Sec-CH-Platform: "Windows 10"
Sec-CH-Arch: "AMD64"
Sec-CH-Mobile: 0
```

I wonder if it will be added to the Roadmap of this project for future updates.

}
Please add some detection for Tesla and other automobiles.

Example user agent strings:
```

```
When I set the User-Agent to the following:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57409060/69828730-f064b880-1214-11ea-9223-90c17ddfd545.png)

I have the following code:

```php
if ($agent->match('/\bNintendo\b/i')) {
    echo = 'Games Console';
 } else {
    echo 'Not working';
}
```

The result says `Not Working` and your library doesn't work for regex matches of user-agents.

Though the https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect package is saying:

```php
device: Console
```

So the user-agent is being processed correctly, it's just your `$agent->match()` doesn't work at all.

Also it's not even been added to the `tests` folder to check if it's working or not.

---

As this repo seems dead, I'm not going to wait for reply. The solution for me was to use php `preg_match`.
Received the following user agent in a request: `MyAirtel/4.6.38 (iPhone; iOS 13.1.2; Scale/3.00)`

Appears to be iPhone, but `->platform` returns simply `false`.

```
>>> use Jenssegers\Agent\Agent;
>>> $agent = new Agent();
=> Jenssegers\Agent\Agent {#2215}
>>> $agent->setUserAgent('MyAirtel/4.6.38 (iPhone; iOS 13.1.2; Scale/3.00)');
=> "MyAirtel/4.6.38 (iPhone; iOS 13.1.2; Scale/3.00)"
>>> $agent->platform();
=> false
```

Is this a known issue? Is it fixable?
This package works extremely well except for mobile apps with built in browser support.
A current issue i have is, when navigating to the website through a facebook ad link, it displays the desktop version instead of the mobile. Was hoping there was some sort of workaround for this. Thanks!
When you try to determine the iPad device, the package sees it as a desktop one, is it possible to see the iPad using a package method and then connect the mobile application. iPad is running iOS 13.0.1
Mobiles using android 9.0 or superiors return "false" when i'm trying to use function "isMobile()".

Can anyone help me or catch the same error?

Thx.
So I have found a problem. With the release of iPad OS and iOS 13, the Safari agent is causing some problems.

I have an app that is mobile only and will only show the mobile app if the agent is detected as being mobile or tablet. But with the new "desktop class browsing" on iPad it's now showing the landing page website instead of the app. 

In my code I'm doing:
```
if ($agent->isDesktop()) {
   ...show the landing page
} else {
   ...show the mobile web app
}
```

What do we do different? or will the agent system get updated to handle iPad?

This is the user agent of Edge mobile, this version have a problem in the name "EdgA/". If check Edge with this version plugin not work.
