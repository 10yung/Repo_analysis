I am very sorry, if this is a dumb question..
I've set up two containers with the docker-compose file provided here. when i start the proxy container, it starts the transmission_vpn container too. so far so good. the containers keep running, but if i try to connect to the rpc via the proxy container (http://192.168.x.y:8080/transmission/rpc/) i get a 502 Bad Gateway Error in my browser/transmission-remote client.
is this a bad transmission config or a bad container setup?

my docker-compose.yml
```
transmission:
  image: haugene/transmission-openvpn:latest-armhf
  cap_add:
    - NET_ADMIN
  devices:
    - "/dev/net/tun"
  restart: always
  ports:
    - "9091:9091"
    - "8888:8888"
  dns:
    - 8.8.8.8
    - 8.8.4.4
  volumes:
    - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    - /home/pi/Downloads/:/data
  environment:
    - OPENVPN_PROVIDER=PUREVPN
    - OPENVPN_USERNAME=purevpn0sxxxxxxx
    - OPENVPN_PASSWORD=xxxxxxxx
    - OPENVPN_OPTS=--inactive 3600 --ping 10 --ping-exit 60
    - TRANSMISSION_RPC_ENABLED=true
    - TRANSMISSION_RPC_PORT=9091
    - TRANSMISSION_RPC_WHITELIST_ENABLED=true
    - TRANSMISSION_RPC_WHITELIST=192.168.*.*,127.0.0.1
    - TRANSMISSION_WATCH_DIR=/data/watch
    - TRANSMISSION_WATCH_DIR_ENABLED=true
proxy:
  image: haugene/transmission-openvpn-proxy:latest-armhf
  links:
    - transmission
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"
  volumes:
    - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro

```

I start the containers with 
`docker-compose up -d proxy`

If i stop the containers, my client says "Couldn't connect", if they are running, it says "502...", so i can definitely reach SOMETHING...

Thanks.

**Describe the problem**
Hello all,
I am new to dockers, transmission and just about all of this so please bear with me. I am running 'container station' on a QNAP 253Be with the latest firmware and updates. When I execute the commands below to create a docker for transmission, the docker creates but only runs for about 30 seconds before stopping. Below is the command I used to generate said docker. I tried swapping out the VPN config files with other known port forwarding servers but I do not believe that to be the issue. I would assume the docker to continue to run even though the VPN failed to connect or error out. Any and all help would be appreciated.

**Add your docker run command**
`docker run --cap-add=NET_ADMIN -d \
          --name=transmission \
          -v /share/CACHEDEV1_DATA/Container/Download:/data \
          -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
          -e CREATE_TUN_DEVICE=true \
          -e OPENVPN_PROVIDER=PIA \
          -e OPENVPN_CONFIG="Czech Republic" \
          -e OPENVPN_USERNAME=username \
          -e OPENVPN_PASSWORD=password \
          -e WEBPROXY_ENABLED=false \
          -e LOCAL_NETWORK=192.168.7.0/24 \
          --log-driver json-file \
          --log-opt max-size=10m \
          -p 9091:9091 \
          haugene/transmission-openvpn`

filename correction- Netherlands-UDP.ovpn
Hi.

My issue is the following:

Everything works fine until PUREVPN closes the server vleu-no2-ovpn-udp.pointtoserver.com

Or, my transmission - openvpn only uses that apparently.

So suddenly: RESOLVED: unable to resolve the host address: vleu-no2-ovpn-udp.pointtoserver.com:53 (name or service unknown)

How do I change this? is there an ovpn somewhere i can edit? Knowing that the vleu-no1-ovpn-udp.pointtoserver.com is available.

Thank you very much.
What all would be needed to add support for ExpressVPN?
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
N/A

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Wireguard is becoming more popular and I would like the project to support NordLynx technology from NordVPN.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I have tried other containers that support NordLynx but the biggest drawback aside from them being in their infancy is that I would have to run another container for Transmission.

**Additional context**
N/A

I am using it since fews days, and it is working without any issue (see the screenshot, with one of my container is unhealthy).

It could also be interesting to explain that, according to the Docker Team's 
-  there is no plan to manage a restart, or stop of an unhealthy container.
- an unhealthy docker just run until it it stopped by a command
- this could be"easily done" by a bash command, that invoke a docker ps command to list all unhealthy containers and restart it (i could give you the code if you want)... scheduled in a cron job, you have a 24H/24H running container.

Regards and thank you for you great job.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
First of all, thank you so much for the amazing Docker image! It works like a charm for me!

That being said, whenever possible, I like to use a specific version tag for running my containers rather than `latest`. When looking at the images available on Docker Hub, I noticed that while the `latest` image (which I’m using for now) was released 3 months ago, the last version tag (`2.7`) was released over 10 months ago.

Furthermore, the release notes here on GitHub mention that there are some known issues in the 2.7 release which are solved in the `latest` tag.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
If it wouldn’t be too much problem, please release another stable version of this image under a version tag, and publish it to Docker Hub.

Thank you!

I am running Docker on Synology DSM 6.2 and hoping someone can help out with a guide / explanation... I would like to direct the web traffic from other containers (namely Jackett, Sonarr and Radarr) through haugene-transmission-openvpn container ie. so that Jackett, Sonarr, Radarr etc. are running through the same VPN I have configured for Transmission.

I've read various posts online which lead me to believe that this is possible, but I can't quite fit all the pieces together to make it work. 

Failing that, a guide on how to setup Jackett to use the transmission-openvpn container's proxy server would also be great. 

I have zero coding knowledge, so as much of a step-by-step as possible would be greatly appreciated. 

I have added environment variables to my current docker containers using the Synology DSM gui... not sure how to go about editing docker containers any other way on Synology.

Many thanks! 
Hello, i just findished setting up a Pritunl VPN Server, and was wondering if you could add support for Pritunl VPN in the future :D

let me know if you need anything from me :D
