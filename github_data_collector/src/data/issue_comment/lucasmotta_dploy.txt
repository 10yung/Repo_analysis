This PR updates deploy.coffee to return error code 1 in case of an error during deployment.

Fixes #98 
The dploy command does not work in this case.
This package seems really nice but I've noticed there has been a lack of recent updates. Are there plans to keep maintaining this?

Thank you!
Hello,

I am having an issue when trying to connect to a SFTP server. This might be linked to the server's fingerprint not beeing known (it is present in ~/.ssh/known_hosts).

Using the ssh2 package, I am able to connect and get folder listing using the same configuration.

Here is the configuration file :
```
stage:
    scheme: sftp
    host: "***.com"
    port: 22
    user: "***"
    pass: "***"
    check: true
    path:
        local: "dist/browser/"
        remote: "public_html/"
```

Here is the error :

```

My dploy.yaml : 
my_app:
    host: "ftp.domain.com"
    user: "user"
    pass: "password"
    path:
        local: "/volume1/web/my-app"
        remote: "/www/my-app"
    exclude: ["dploy.yaml"]
![dploy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5849541/36750924-06b28328-1bff-11e8-9ebe-f3fbe085fd58.jpg)
 
Any idea ?
Thank you guys !
While everything works, I'm now receiving this error message:

```sh
npm WARN deprecated minimatch@0.2.14: Please update to minimatch 3.0.2 or higher to avoid a RegExp DoS issue

Hello,
I have **npm v 5.6.0**,  **node v 6.11.0**.
My dploy.yaml is similar to:
```
master:
  scheme: sftp
    host: 192.168.1.1
    port: 22
    user: user
    pass: password
    check: true
    path:
      remote: /var/www/sitename/
```

When I perform :
`dploy name`


It return this error:

> C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\dploy\node_modules\yamljs\bin\yaml.js:1219 throw new YamlParseException('Unable to parse.', this.getRealCurrentLineNb() + 1, this.currentLine);


Although the primary focus of dploy is obviously FTP/SFTP I found it useful and trivial to implement the file scheme. 

I realise this isn't the direction dploy is going in but thought it others might find this useful.
Hi ! 
I can't upload on a ovh server. The upload stops at the first file.. 

Hello, I have a worry when I deployed on a dedicated (VPS) SFTP even with root user I have a worry .. how to do? Thank you
