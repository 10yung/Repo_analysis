Upon rotation the center point is no longer correct and moves to the bottom left of the screen.

I add LayoutAsHorizontalList for my app. So may be you want to add it too. 

I see only showInViewController methods, is somehow possible to show gridMenu in UIView?

If the blur is set to 0, the menu appears without animating. This fixes that by calling the completion block even if the blur level is 0.

Please add a simple "tag" property (integer) to RNGridMenuItem.

Hi great work on this project, I'm loving it.
However there is one little bug that probably hasn't seen very often.

I have a table view controller inside a tab bar view controller.
Currently, I make the call from the table view controller like this

``` obj-c
- (IBAction)menuBarButtonPressed:(UIBarButtonItem *)sender
{
  // uncomment below to stop the table view from moving
  //  [self.tableView setContentOffset:self.tableView.contentOffset animated:NO];
  [HMTabBarViewController menuBarButtonPressedForViewController:self];
}
```

and then inside the tab bar view controller:

``` obj-c
+ (void)menuBarButtonPressedForViewController:(UIViewController *)controller
{
  [(HMTabBarViewController *)[UIApplication sharedApplication].keyWindow.rootViewController menuBarButtonPressedForViewController:controller];
}
```

and

``` obj-c
- (void)menuBarButtonPressedForViewController:(UIViewController *)controller
{
  RNGridMenu *gridMenu = [RNGridMenu visibleGridMenu];

  gridMenu = [[RNGridMenu alloc] initWithItems:self.gridMenuItems]; // Already have the menu items array
  [gridMenu setDelegate:self];

  [gridMenu showInViewController:controller center:CGPointMake(self.view.bounds.size.width/2.f, self.view.bounds.size.height/2.f)];
}
```

So this works great!

However, if I scroll the table view, and while the table view is moving, I try to open the grid menu, the grid menu will also move with the table view and it results in the grid menu either shifted up or down. 

Next I tried to stop the table from moving before calling the grid menu, it works most of the time. However if the table view is in the process of refreshing(where you pull down the table and a spinner spins at the top). The grid menu will also be shifted.

I had a table view controller inside a tab view controller.  If I show the menu from the tab bar controller it will dismiss as expected.  If I try to create and show the menu from the table view controller, the menu never dismisses but instead disappears very briefly and reappears.  My workaround was the change the call to show if I was in the table view controller.  The delegate is still set to self.  Here is the before and after.

Before:
[av showInViewController:self center:CGPointMake(self.view.bounds.size.width/2.f, self.view.bounds.size.height/2.f)];

After:
[av showInViewController:self.parentViewController center:CGPointMake(self.view.bounds.size.width/2.f, self.view.bounds.size.height/2.f)];

Hope this helps anyone else that had the same thing happen.

`RNGridMenu`'s method `-(void)layoutAsGrid` had an unused variable (`NSInteger offset = 0`) that was not used in the method. This causes a warning under many configurations.
