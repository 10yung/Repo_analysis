Dear Developers,

I would like to freeze the weights and the biases in some given layers (at some given initial values). Do you have any suggestions how I could do it?
Many thanks in advance!
Congrats on this awesome educational resource!

Fixed link.
it's very minor, but for ages i tried to understand why this instruction:

> To push to production: `git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages`.

didn't work for me.

it's because, i think, on any _new_ clone, the `dist` folder isn't in the repo, and so of course isn't impacted by any commit, and thus the command fails.

right?

but it would've worked in the past, if the dist folder _was_ in the repo (which it used to be).

i'm assuming a different way of deploying is now used?
I love this TF Playground, should it come with feature to click to enter custom data.
Hello. I can't get the hot reload to work. I get the following:

[1] [2] npm run watch-html exited with code 0
[1] [1] npm run watch-css exited with code 0

While .js reloads, the html and css doesn't work via the concat package. Am I doing something wrong here?

This should be trivial to make and would help Mish to become popular.
