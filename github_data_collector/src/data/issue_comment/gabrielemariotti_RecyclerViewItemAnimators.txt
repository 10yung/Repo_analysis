private void resetAnimation(RecyclerView.ViewHolder holder) {
// TODO: 2019-08-23 missing file
        //        AnimatorCompatHelper.clearInterpolator(holder.itemView); 
        endAnimation(holder);
    }

Lost the file ‘AnimatorCompatHelper’, I removed this line and the test works fine.
Hi, I´m trying to use your lib on Android Studio 3.0.1 with Recyclerview-v7:27.0.1 and I away get "Fail to resolve" on _implementation 'com.github.gabrielemariotti.recyclerview:recyclerview-animators:0.3.0-SNAPSHOT@aar'_

A´m I doing something wrong or your lib must be updated?

Thank you.
hello, i want to start Alpha aniamtion from right to left. how can i do to this?
Line #270 and #271 of ViewAnimation.java:
`        int lastVisiblePosition = ((LinearLayoutManager)mRecyclerView.getLayoutManager()).findLastCompletelyVisibleItemPosition();
`
It tries to cast my layout manager to a linear layout, which is not the case, since I'm using StaggeredGridLayoutManager.

Am I missing something or the lib does not support the use of another type of Layout Manager?
I know it supports 23.1.1, but I want to know what to do to support 23.2.1, maybe you can help me

First of all, great work!

SwingBottomInAnimationAdapter has missing configuration, it should be generic as other adapters.

So now we have:

```
public class SwingBottomInAnimationAdapter extends AnimatorAdapter {
  public SwingBottomInAnimationAdapter(RecyclerView.Adapter<RecyclerView.ViewHolder> adapter, RecyclerView recyclerView) {
        super(adapter, recyclerView);
    }
...
}
```

and should be :

```
public class SwingBottomInAnimationAdapter<T extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder> extends AnimatorAdapter<T> {

    public SwingBottomInAnimationAdapter(RecyclerView.Adapter<T> adapter, RecyclerView recyclerView) {
        super(adapter, recyclerView);
    }
...
```

The SwingBottomInAnimationAdapter should be typed just as the other subclasses of AnimatorAdapter:

``` java
public class SwingBottomInAnimationAdapter<T extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder> extends AnimatorAdapter<T> {
    ...
}
```

Hi,

Do you plan to implement swipe to remove animations similar to ListViewAnimator?

While building this library, did you ever encounter calling setItemAnimator and passing in a a class that extends ItemAnimator does nothing? None of the callbacks in the ItemAnimator class are being triggered. Any tips would be much appreciated.

I try your code to make animation for my recycler view, but I got random bug issues, so sometime the item (string) became disappear or became smaller. It will happen if i add many item and remove it and do it repeatly. here i attach my screenshoot
