I have a requirement in which i have to maximize the tags selection to 3.
Is it possible and how can i do it?
hi 
 
I am trying to Taglist in Tableview it working fine,
but I have to show tagListView first item only highleted in tableview cell.
when I open the application by the time Automatically Taglistview First time selected 
and show custom color.
how  can achieve, 
Since Xcode 11 includes Swift Package Manager, it would be nice to support it

Using pod 'TagListView', '~> 1.0' and it is giving me an error since Friday 

Error: - Value of type 'TagListView?' has no member 'rowViews'
It seems that whatever I do I cannot set the correct `textColor` for my tag list view. I've set it in my storyboard, I've set it in code for the `tagListView`, also set it for each tag after adding it but no matter what I've tried it's always white for some reason. Setting the selected tag color works without any issues...

Same issue I'm having with the font. Doesn't matter what font I set the tags **always** use the default system font of size 18.0

I'm running Xcode 10.3
- Add UIColor argument for the constructors
how can find the the selected Tag-view

Hi
First of all thanks for the awesome library.
Is it possible to justify tags like we justify text?
Something like the below image.
