We are currently using n8n deployed behind an authenticated proxy which exposes only the /webhooks to public. 
This PR allows for overriding the hostname/url used for internal api call in execute workflow node via environment variable.
Hello,

When using the docker setup (and maybe others), the default SQLite database created has pretty open permissions. Given there could be credentials in there, it would be good to harden permissions to at least not allow public to read it.

Thanks for the great work :) 
@janober let me know pal.
