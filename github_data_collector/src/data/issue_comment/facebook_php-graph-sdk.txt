I cant log in to my facebook account
I have a question about the follow request
```
GET: https://graph.facebook.com/{import-status-id}?fields=publish_status
```
What's the exact status possibilities for this: **`publish_status`** ? 
DRAFT and ? ... 
…o used PSR 7
Ao que parece o facebook não está enviando o cabeçalho Access-Control-Allow-Origin:* a um bom tempo, mas hoje deu pane total rsrs
O próprio facebook em si parou de funcionar para mim
Hello, 
when I tried to ask for user groups. (GET) with administrator field (true/false) it works in Facebook API Explorer:

?fields=icon,id,name,created_time,owner,email,administrator

But when I asked for the same via PHP SDK ^5.7.0":

It shows error: nonexisting field (administrator) in Group Node

Can you suggest any solution for this problem? Do you have similar problem?

Thanks in advance
seeing who is spamming dad

Hello guys

This library still defaults to 2.10, which has been deprecated  and has EOL on November 5 (as I'm sure you know).

How about we update this to avoid all of these unnecessary warnings in the developer portal?
