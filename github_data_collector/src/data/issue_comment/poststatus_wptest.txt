With the new editor being shipped in WordPress 5.0, it would be great to have an export that supports the new block-based editor.

This may be blocked by changes to the importer that are needed. I am going to start investigating this.

Hi,
This is no issue with your test data, but I think it would be a good place to document the issue. Maybe some other users will hit the Bug when importing the test data. The bug is in the current WordPress importer plugin when using it with PHP 7.0
During the Import of the XML there is no error message displayed and the importer finishes without problems. Everything is imported, including the menus them self, but they are empty!
The Bug is documented here https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36281 and https://wordpress.org/support/topic/fails-to-export-or-import-menu-items-when-using-php7/

To fix it you have to change the file `wp-content/plugins/wordpress-importer/wordpress-importer.php` at line 884

from

    $$meta['key'] = $meta['value'];

to

    ${$meta['key']} = $meta['value'];


Just add the two brackets and you are good to go.

I tested this on my wordpress 4.8.2 running on Ubuntu 16.04 with php 7.0

Hope this will help any future user to save some time searching for a solution

Regards,
Andreas
Getting the following error on import:
Notice: wp_get_http is deprecated since version 4.4.0! Use WP_Http instead. ..../wp-includes/functions.php on line 3831

Version 4.8.1 

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0

Everything seems to work ok. Images loaded. Maybe WP core is just a notice and it still uses `wp_get_http` from deprecated list.
If possible I would like to see wptest.io default to HTTPS, this can be done with CloudFlare.

I'm just testing the `HTML / HTML5 form elements` while building the theme. But, There is no post in theme review, Which contain all the HTML / HTML5 form elements.

So, I'm not able to see how all HTML / HTML5 form elements looks in theme review.

Using [WordPress Importer Redux](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) I am getting an almost 100% import. Well one "term" is missing.

![wordpress importer redux 001](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5672418/14645420/dd03cb2e-0655-11e6-8f7e-e74a0946bff7.png)

It tells me that it could not find the post parent for various posts.

Hi guys

Any chance of adding half a dozen posts with images? Really useful for testing and demoing things like featured post sliders.

thanks
