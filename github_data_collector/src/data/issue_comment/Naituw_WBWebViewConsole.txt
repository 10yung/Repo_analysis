UIView+Positioning (1.6) is a swift pod repo which is depended by WBWebViewConsole. And I get an error when building:
Showing All Messages
The “Swift Language Version” (SWIFT_VERSION) build setting must be set to a supported value for targets which use Swift. This setting can be set in the build settings editor.


Hello. Have you tried using the custom UIMenuController on WKWebView? Why my side in the WK on the system can not afford to copy, paste and other options?
截止2017-07-25,cocoapods上的东西并不是最新的，而且最新的代码改动比较大，能更新master代码到cocoapods仓库吗，谢谢

fixed
页面上嵌入js 的时候，会无法正常也行。
Hi, could you kindly release a new version that contains the commit which removes all dependencies onto cocoapods?
