Hi, 
I am using JupyterHub on AWS EMR v5.24
JupyterHub is installed inside a docker container from AWS.
It comes with:
* jupyter_client v5.2.3
* jupyter_core v4.4.0
* jupyterhub v0.9.6

I try to install sparkmonitor within the container as follow

```sh
sudo docker exec jupyterhub bash -c "pip install sparkmonitor"
sudo docker exec jupyterhub bash -c "jupyter nbextension install sparkmonitor --py --user --symlink"
sudo docker exec jupyterhub bash -c "jupyter nbextension enable sparkmonitor --py --user"
sudo docker exec jupyterhub bash -c "jupyter serverextension enable --py --user sparkmonitor"
```

I get message `- Validating: OK` for the two `nbextention` lines but after the last line I get the error message:

```
Enabling: sparkmonitor.serverextension
- Writing config: /home/jovyan/.jupyter
    - Validating...
Error loading server extension sparkmonitor.serverextension
      X is sparkmonitor.serverextension importable?
```

I continue with 

```sh
sudo docker exec jupyterhub bash -c "echo \"c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions.append('sparkmonitor.kernelextension')\" >>  /home/jovyan/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_kernel_config.py"
```

When I run JupyterHub, I see a button "Toggle Spark Monitoring Displays" but I cannot see the monitoring module... any Idea ?
