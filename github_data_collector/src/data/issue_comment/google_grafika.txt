First of all thanks for this project. I am using the DoubleDecode application. 

I have extended that to play four x264 video streams on to four texture views on Google Pixel 2 phone. I have seen four times  OMX.qcom.video.decoder.avc (HW video decoder instance) has been created. Does it mean that four HW decoder instances can be possible by my android? Is there any way to check the configuration of maximum capabilities of hardware decoder (or max number of instances that can be created for hardware decoder)? 

Then just want to know about the workflow does it means four different streams are decoded and displayed by four different instances of HW decoder in four different threads?

How to get the decoding and displaying time for each frame from MoviePlayer.java script?

Just curious on this context, 
On setting blending off, glReadPixels throws a black/blank image, and I'm clueless why.
I've put up [an SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55497559/glreadpixels-returns-a-blank-image-on-disabling-blend), but I was hoping to get @fadden 's attention.

Do you know why this might be happening?
i tried to call onDraw() method of triangle class in doAnimation method in TextureViewGLActivity but it just shows blank screen
here are the details

I want to remove rectangle shape from recorded file
can you solve this problem?
Thanks

Hello,
I am using code of CameraCaptureActivity but when get my video file , their is no sound in video. and we are also facing OutOfMemory issue.
How to clear buffer when release the camera components?
I am recording 2min circulerbuffer but this is not working at our end.
Since the synchronous API is deprecated, and because I find that not all the android devices support the synchronous API now, it's meaningful to have extended encode/decode test example implemented with async API for versions above Android Lollipop.
In RecordFBOActivity, when I start recording, which will have "mWindowSurface.swapBuffers" and "mInputWindowSurface.swapBuffers" .
The fast speed is Choreographer time which diffent on diffent Devices!(58-62 maybe)
I want get a stable FPS(for example 60) because I will do opengl compose then display and record.

Now I do by this at fixed fps:
```      
public void run() {
            prepareGl();
            while (mRunning) {
                llNowNs = System.nanoTime();
                if (llNowNs - llBeginNs < llFrameCount * mRefreshTimeNs) {
                    llDelayNs = llFrameCount * mRefreshTimeNs - llNowNs + llBeginNs;
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(llDelayNs / 1000000);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }

                    continue;
                }

                render(llFrameCount * mRefreshTimeNs);
                llFrameCount++;
            }
            releaseGl();
        }
```

Every render() I swapbuffer to encode surface and swapbuffer to display like in RecordFBOActivity.

Now the problem is swapbuffer to encode surface cost long time. I think is BufferQueue is Fence by something! What it is???

And which is best arch to do this???

I do not want to download Image then push to the encode! Which is ulgy and slowly!!!!

Very thanks!
Hi,
created project MediaCodec and Camera2. Does not (local) record video in horizontal orientation. How to eliminate this issue?
