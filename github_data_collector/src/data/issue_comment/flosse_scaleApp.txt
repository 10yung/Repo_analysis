Hey..

I would really like a subscribe to anything-option for the built in meditator.
something like

sandbox.on(function(msg, ...) {

});

or

sandbox.on('*', function(msg, ...) {

}); 

For correct use of scaleApp plugins in a Node.js/CommonJS world, is-it possible to move each plugin to a single repository ?

I got around this by using the CDN
It may be that the version of the library packaged with the zipfiles is outdated. 

Nothing more to say :)
