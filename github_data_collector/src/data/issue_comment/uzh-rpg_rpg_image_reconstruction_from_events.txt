When `t_query` is outside bounds of `t_ctrl(1)` or `t_query = t_ctrl(end)`, it outputs `nan * rotmats_ctrl(1,:)`, but 1 by number of `ctrl` entries; it should still output a 3x3, so it should be `rotmats_ctrl(:,:,1)` to accommodate pose estimates that start just after event measurements, or at least `nan * rotmats_ctrl(:,:,1)` to maintain expected output size.
