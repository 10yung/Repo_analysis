First off, love that someone recommended this little gem of a tool to me. I do a lot of research and have to monitor events taking place in literally all corners of the earth, 24/7. This is helping automate a lot of my monitoring tasks, and I already have well over 100 agents running on my server. Absolutely love it!
Today I've been creating RSS feeds for all the sites I read, I got most of them down but one is giving me some problems. The site is small and it looks like they don't use the greatest of all Class management. This is the site in question, https://c4ads.org/reports. I'm specifically trying to watch that Reports page.

Using `"css": ".sqs-block-content p strong"` it also is picking up a lot of useless text such as "FEATURED REPORTS" and "GNSS attacks are emerging as a viable, disruptive strategic threat.". This is because this site literally has no classes for different content. Is there anyway to filter this down even further? Similar issues happen if I try to retrieve the description text. I tried a couple RSS Maker sites to maybe get some ideas if I was missing something, but those were messing up too.

Overall the website is just poorly coded obviously, but would there be anyway to navigate this?
This should fix #2672.  Ubuntu 14.04 only has jq 1.3 which cannot be detected by JqAgent because of the output format of `jq --version` in that ancient version.

@dsander

After a few months of stable running, this problem appeared again this morning, hundreds of jobs were stuck, I tried your method and it was really useful!

There are already three buttons in the 'Background Jobs' page, Can you add another button to execute this command? In this case, when users encounter similar situations, they do not have to log in to the VPS every time to execute the code.

Thanks!
Hi!
I really like Huginn. But I have a small config issue that I don't really understand at the top of my head (and sadly, don't have the time to investigate on my own right now).
I run Huginn in k8s. And the config looks something like:
```
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: huginn
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  replicas: 1
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: huginn
          env:
          - name: DOMAIN
            value: "<some_local_fqdn>:3000"
          - name: FORCE_SSL
            value: "false"
          - name: PORT
            value: "3000"
          image: huginnbuilder/huginn:pr-2634
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 3000
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: huginn
  namespace: monitoring
  labels:
    k8s-app: huginn
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: http
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    k8s-app: huginn
```
I removed a lot of cruft that shouldn't be relevant here.
And... the problem is when I just apply this. Huginn overrides the port to be 80 (the service port).
Which is... not what I want. And also just doesn't work because the container doesn't run as privileged so it can't bind on port 80 to begin with.

My workaround so far is to edit the yaml config, set the service port to 3000, start Huginn, then change it back to 80 and re-apply (which only modifies the service).

It works but... it's the first container where I have this issue.
Thanks for the help!

Hello,
I'm fairly new to Huginn :)
I have noticed many jobs do not run on schedule. Is there anything I can do to debug what's happening?
I have ensured that I have set up the right timezone because the date of 'now' in events is correct when I trigger them myself.

I have seen comments about a "Job Management" page but I can't see it (#1668)? I have seen issues talking about admin users but I didn't see any choices? I had to use the invitation code to create an account.

I'm using the docker hub huginn/huginn image, with those variables setup:

      HUGINN_DATABASE_NAME
      HUGINN_DATABASE_USERNAME
      HUGINN_DATABASE_PASSWORD
      HUGINN_DATABASE_ADAPTER
      DATABASE_HOST
      POSTGRES_PORT_5432_TCP_ADDR
      DO_NOT_CREATE_DATABASE: true
      APP_SECRET_TOKEN
      DOMAIN
      INVITATION_CODE
      EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS 
      RAILS_ENV: production
      SMTP_DOMAIN
      SMTP_PASSWORD
      SMTP_PORT
      SMTP_SERVER
      SMTP_USER_NAME
      TIMEZONE: Paris

Thanks for any help :)

Hi,

Any ideas why this happens? I'm using multithreaded Huginn, the exact processes that hangs varies.
What's the best way to kill all running jobs that have been running for longer than 1 hour?

See attached image.

Hi,

I'm trying to post alerts to Gotify and would like to dynamically specify a priority value. The [Gotify API](https://gotify.net/api-docs#/message/createMessage) expects one for creating a message, but I'm having a problem specifying one.

My Gotify Poster agent is set up as follows:
```
{
  "post_url": "https://my.gotify.box/message",
  "expected_receive_period_in_days": "365",
  "content_type": "json",
  "method": "post",
  "payload": {
    "title": "{{title}}",
    "message": "{{message}}",
    "priority": "{{priority}}"
  },
  "headers": {
    "X-Gotify-Key": "{% credential gotify_access_token %}"
  },
  "emit_events": "true",
  "output_mode": "merge",
  "no_merge": "false"
}
```
The credential definitely works. If I remove the priority the agent works, but then I can't use this for different classes of notification. If the priority is still set, it sends it as a string, but the Gotify API wants an integer. I had a look [here](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/issues/2352) but as_object didn't work for me. This is what I get back with the priority field set:
```
{
  "message": "This is a test message",
  "title": "Testing",
  "priority": "8",
  "body": "{\"error\":\"Bad Request\",\"errorCode\":400,\"errorDescription\":\"json: cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field MessageExternal.priority of type int\"}",
  "status": 400,
  "headers": {
    "Content-Length": "148",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Date": "Sat, 04 Jan 2020 12:35:10 GMT"
  }
}
```
Any thoughts on how I can ensure that priority is sent via the post as an integer, not a string?
Huginn is great for automation, which begs the question: how can I automate Huginn?

I know there is the CommandAgent to enable/disable Agents and update configuration, but what about creating agents and updating configuration from an outside system?

For example, I have a few workflows where several agents feed into an email digest, and each of these agents is similar, but with slightly different config (an example of one workflow: each watches for changes from a different URL). So every time I want to watch a different URL, for example, I need to clone an agent, change some config, and hook it up to the main workflow. This is manual and error-prone work that I'd like to avoid, if possible.

It would be cool if I could do this via API, or even a bookmarklet.

Here, I see some logic in a [GET-only API like Pinboard has](https://pinboard.in/howto/#api), which makes it easy to interact with via URLs and bookmarklets.

---

Basically I'm more looking to spark a discussion here – has there ever been any discussion around this I may have missed, and how do people work around such issues currently?

One thought that I just had: what about extending CommandAgent to create new agents with a template for config, or being able to clone agents – then I could maybe do what I want by using the Webhook agent -> Command agent.

WebsiteAgent has trouble to access websites with DDoS protection by Cloudflare

Example website (adult):  https://www.inthecrack.com/

Command curl gives me "Checking your browser" message with 503 error.
`curl -Lv https://www.inthecrack.com`
`HTTP/1.1 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable`

The error log of a dry run is also attached.
[itc.error.log](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/files/3993071/itc.error.log)

Any browsers like firefox, IE or chrome can open the website with no problem but have to wait for a few seconds to get pass the “Checking your browser” page.


So, is there a way for websiteagent to act like a browser?

Hi!
I need to scrap a web page which is only accessible after using the internal search engine on website homepage.
So I need to select the text box on the homepage, click on the 'Go' button to go the page which I want to scrap.
Is it possible?
Thanks a lot in advance!
