Fixes #2459 

Changes: 
Added a key listener on the EditText for search bar to detect a back press and act accordingly.


The search bar for skills closes when we press the action bar back button or the "x" on the search bar. But it does not close when we press the android navigation back button.

**Expected Behaviour**

The search bar should behave the same as it does when the action bar back button is pressed.

**Steps to reproduce it**

1. Press the search button in the Skills page.
2. Repeatedly pressing the android back button does not cause anything. Ideally the search bar should close.
