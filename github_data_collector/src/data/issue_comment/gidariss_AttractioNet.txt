I want to train the AttractioNet model by myself, but I don't know how to write the solver prototxt.
Can you give me a detailed information about the solver prototxt to train and get the 58000 AttractioNet model?
Another question is the model trained use the caffe_LocNet or the caffe of berkeleyvision?
Thank you very much!
