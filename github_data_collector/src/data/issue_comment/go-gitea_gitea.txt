Fix issue #9765. When adding or removing a dependency, a comment is generated on each issue. The comment when displayed in the UI assumes that the issue is in the same repository, but with cross repository dependencies, they are not. Fixed to show the full name of the issue and links to the correct issue.

## Description

You can just register an ali-cloud account and use its RAM oauth2 feature, then you will find out the integration won't work

> I assume the issue is because Alicloud userdetail doesn't fit the standard user claims return

Working in #9787 I've found that there are some columns in `repository` and `user` which have no migration step. For my PR I need these columns to exists before starting the main process, so I've created a migration step for them.
