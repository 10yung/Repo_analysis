I'm confused with this 1:30, how does it works and why 30?

Thanks.
thank for you work
Check for the existance of MTL before accessing it,
call Reader_waveform_core with reader object instead of fs
I have merged your new F_LSTM and F_affine_transform revised on 9th Feb 2017. And I have implemented moving window average based F_SpatialCovMask. I fix a index bug in ComputeWinCovMask in last pull request. I sum the spatial cov of the window and divided by windowSize. Is it right? Please help check and merge propabaly
I wonder if you have any dereverberation recipe.
