this is not very exciting but since I wrote it, I thought I'd share it and let you decide whether it'd be of any use.  very simple.  uses 'curl' instead 'wget' and compresses directly to disk using 'xz'.  it will also die on failures and allow transfers to resume (although that's probably not all that useful for many failures since it'll have to restart if 'xz' doesn't know what size the original data is).
