I was interested in using this code for a project, but as it stands, I'm stumped on how to get it up and running.  When I run the basic code, this is the output I get.  Does anyone have any suggestions?

Trying to run the script returns an error. The last lines are:

```
...
[1] "hi buddy. just fyi, i'm not using any Q1 fec data, because i think you don't have it yet in 2014"
1
2
Error in `$<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, "pie", value = 0) :
  replacement has 1 row, data has 0
Calls: source ... eval -> eval -> pollPredict -> $<- -> $<-.data.frame
Execution halted
```

The problem is within the `forecast.obj <- pollPredict(2014, d, new.polls, new.races,` line in the senate-model-2014.R file.

I had successfully run the model only once, on July 22nd.

Would be great to get a daily dump of the poll data. Otherwise it's hard to replicate the NYT's own math, follow along at home or explore alternate assumptions.

I'm imagining this is mainly an individualized problem, since I don't see any other error postings on here -- but if it's not, here's a screenshot of my output when the simulation starts:

It might be a good idea to fix the random seed used for the 250,000 realizations of the simulation, in case readers are interested in reproducing exactly the numbers reported on the NYT Upshot Web site.

I have tried with today's data and cannot quite match the figures on the Web site. For example, even after trying several times, I can't get up to >88.5% for New Hampshire. (The public figure is 89.)

But there is some run-to-run slop that comes from the randomness, and it would be easier to debug if I knew I was using the same random seed as the public figures.
