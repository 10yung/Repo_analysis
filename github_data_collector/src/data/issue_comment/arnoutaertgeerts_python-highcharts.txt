> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [lodash's releases](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/releases).*

> ## 4.0.0
> # [lodash v4.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400)
> 
> 2015 was big year! [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) became the [most depended on](https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491#file-01-most-dependent-upon-md) npm package, passed [1 billion](http://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=&author=jdalton) downloads, & its v3 release saw massive adoption!
> 
> The year was also one of collaboration, as discussions began on [merging Lodash & Underscore](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/underdash/underdash/issues/14). Much of Lodash v4 is proofing out the ideas from those discussions. Lodash v4 **would not be possible** without the collaboration & contributions of the Underscore core team. In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with [several members](https://github.com/orgs/lodash/people) contributing to both libraries.
> 
> For 2016 & [lodash v4.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400) we wanted to cut loose, push forward, & take things up a notch!
> 
> ## Modern only
> 
> With v4 weâ€™re breaking free from [old projects](https://github.com/lodash-archive), old environments, & dropping [old IE < 9 support](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support)!
> 
> ## 4 kB Core
> 
> Lodashâ€™s kitchen-sink size will continue to grow as new methods & functionality are added. However, we now offer a 4 kB (gzipped) [core build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0/dist) thatâ€™s compatible with [Backbone v1.2.4](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/3839) for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink.
> 
> ## More ES6
> 
> Weâ€™ve continued to embrace ES6 with methods like [_.isSymbol](https://lodash.com/docs#isSymbol), added support for cloning & comparing array buffers, maps, sets, & symbols, converting iterators to arrays, & iterable `_(â€¦)`.
> 
> In addition, weâ€™ve published an [es-build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0-es/) & pulled [babel-plugin-lodash](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash) into core to make tree-shaking a breeze.
> 
> ## More Modular
> 
> Pop quiz! ðŸ“£
> 
> What category path does the `bindAll` method belong to? Is it 
> 
> A) `require('lodash/function/bindAll')`
> B) `require('lodash/utility/bindAll')`
> C) `require('lodash/util/bindAll')`
> 
> Donâ€™t know? Well, with v4 it doesnâ€™t matter because now module paths are as simple as
> 
> ``` js
> var bindAll = require('lodash/bindAll');
> ```
> 
> Weâ€™ve also reduced module complexity making it easier to create smaller bundles. This has helped Lodash adoption with libraries like [Async](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/caolan/async/pull/996) & [Redux](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rackt/redux/pull/611)!
> 
> ## 1st Class FP
> 
> With v3 we introduced [lodash-fp](https://github.com/lodash-archive/lodash-fp). We learned a lot & with v4 we decided to [pull it into core](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide).
> 
> Now you can get immutable, auto-curried, iteratee-first, data-last methods as simply as
> 
> ``` js
> var _ = require('lodash/fp');
> var object = { 'a': 1 };

This is a very good project, why don't you update it?
```
charts.plot(series=series,options=options,height=1000,show='inline',type='bar')
```

I drew a chart in Jupyter Notebook and the chart seems to be too small. I tried to change the **height** attribute but nothing changed. How to solve this problem?
Sorry for asking a basic question, is it possible to create charts like [this](http://www.highcharts.com/plugin-registry/single/40/Motion)
Hi Arnout,

Can you point me to an example that shows how to add annotations to a timeseries chart (highstock)?

I have been struggling to get this to work, but so far nothing yet.

The data is in the following format:
	                                values        flags
Timestamp	
2014-02-28 00:00:00	1160994    OK
2014-02-28 00:15:00	0                 FAULTY_ZERO
2014-02-28 00:30:00	0                 FAULTY_ZERO
2014-02-28 00:45:00	1163902    OK
2014-02-28 01:00:00	1164244    OK

This is what I have been doing so far:
df_result = validation.execute("zero_reads")
print df_result['flags'].value_counts()
flags = dict(type="flags", data=[dict(x=str(k), title=v[1]) for k, v in df_result.iterrows() if v[1]!='OK'])
options = dict(title="test", annotations=flags)
charts.plot(df_result, options=options, show='inline', stock=True)

I want to show the non "OK" flags only (from the flags column) with a label showing up just above the value in the chart.

thanks for your help!

Regards,

Edwin
It is a great package. 
it is common in high stock that plot lines which share x axis, using multi-pane.
for example, yaxis,  line1 range(0,1) and line2 range(1e5, 1e6). 
in this case, the two line could not be in one pane, because y range differs too much.

Can't seem to find a way to hide:
1. Search bar
2. Settings button
3. Exporting (traditional way through highcharts config does not work, no option in settings)
4. Watermark (same as above)

Are any of these possible?

Im trying to add some drilldown and was wondering if it's supported or am i doing it wrong, (i suspect the latter)?

Using python 3.5.1, ipython 4.1.2, pip 8.1.2

```
$ pip install charts
$ ipython

In [1]: import charts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-5eb3a6e89685> in <module>()
----> 1 import charts

/Users/ajp/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/charts/__init__.py in <module>()

----> 5 from plot import plot, plotasync, line, area, spline, pie
      6 from server import run_server
      7 

ImportError: cannot import name 'plot'
```

Is there something I'm doing wrong. Can I help fix something? I was hoping to use this in Jupyter. Do you think this would be possible?
