### System information

- Operating System: Windows 10.0.18363
- Clementine version: 1.4.0rc1, 1.4.0rc1-63-g456314948

### Expected behaviour / actual behaviour

Expected: plays UNC paths.

Actual: skips track as unavailable. Right-click -> "Show in file browser" opens the location, the library seems to know about it, but when you try to actually play, it skips. Local files appear to work.

### Steps to reproduce the problem (only for bugs)

Load a track with a UNC path (e.g. "`\\my-nas\music\CoolSongs\Track1.mp3`"), observe that track doesn't play.

### System information

Please provide information about your system and the version of Clementine used.

- Operating System: Linux Mint 19.3
- Clementine version: 1.3.1

### Expected behaviour / actual behaviour
If I search my audio library for a complete word in summary:
Complete "words" are found.
Sub-strings that begin "words" are found.
Sub-strings within words or ending words are not found.

I had thought that I would look at the code and implement a fix. However, the code is completely undocumented and I do not feel comfortable reverse-engineering it.

### Steps to reproduce the problem (only for bugs)
If I search my audio library for a complete word, a string, say, "K456". Then it is found. 
If I am looking for a sub-string that occurs at the beginning of a word, say, "K45". Then it is found. It will pick up K456, K457, ...
However, if I am looking something that ends in "456" (because, for example, I cannot recall whether I have used K.456 or K456 in my naming) then it will not find anything ending in "456".

- Operating System: win 10 version 1903
- Clementine version: 1.4 rc1

### Expected behaviour / actual behaviour
In library, I expect the tree expanders to use the nicer visuals from clementine 1.3 (> for not expanded, and v for expanded). In 1.4 I see the + in a box for not expanded and - in a box for expanded.
In the playlist view, I expect the headers to use the nicer visuals from clementine 1.3 (white and thin outlines). In 1.4 the headers are gray with thick outlines.

Please provide information about your system and the version of Clementine used.

- Operating System: Windows 10
- Clementine version:  1.4.0rc1

### Expected behaviour / actual behaviour
Clementine 1.4 does not apply any theming on windows resulting in a UI similar to that of Windows 95. Whereas Clementine 1.3 uses the Windows Vista Style.

### Steps to reproduce the problem (only for bugs)
Install Clementine 1.4 on windows. (I believe any version vista+ would exhibit this)

I also experience the same issue with Strawberry. I assume it is looking for the system specified theme, but windows 10 has no such setting. Kdenlive solves this by presenting style in the options menu

### Expected behaviour / actual behaviour
I can't find the intenet service "Last.fm" in "Preferences"
### Steps to reproduce the problem (only for bugs)
I updated my clementine from 1.3 to 1.4, and when I updated it I lost the internet service "Last.fm". I can't find this service in "Preferences", and of course I am not scrobbling my songs.

### Expected behaviour / actual behaviour

Actual: Adding soma.fm streams from the clementine sidebar of the online tab adds 128k mp3 streams.

Expected:
No need for outdated mp3 format soma.fm streams with worse quality when AAC is available.

### Steps to reproduce the problem (only for bugs)

1. Add a soma.fm stream from the online tab.
2. Click on stream details on any soma.fm stream. shows `somafm://somafm.com/deepspaceone.pls`

This seems to refer to the default 128k mp3 streams like `https://somafm.com/deepspaceone.pls`. But soma also has 128k AAC steams, and obviously there is better quality transported over AAC with the same bitrate they call the playlists like `https://somafm.com/deepspaceone130.pls`.

And BTW the playlists over multiple servers. In this case there are actually four servers in the playlist. I am not sure what the `somafm://` is doing in clementine so I am curious if someone can tell me it would be much appreciated.

I think opening up soma streams in clementine should actually be like opening up a the xxx130.pls files from them directly. They also offer 32k and 64k AAC streams but I personally see no need for them. I think I read once that 64k AAC is basically the same quality as 128k mp3. But there could be a choice for them also.

See [somafm.com/deepspaceone/](https://somafm.com/deepspaceone/)

- Operating System: Windows 10 Professional version 1903 Build 18362.535
- Clementine version: 1.3.1

### Expected behaviour / actual behaviour
I have a playlist set up. When set to random shuffle and repeat entire playlist. Sometimes a song will be cut off between 10 and 5 seconds before the end of the file, even if silence is not being truncated. Additionally, this appears to happen only to some songs. Additionally, every time this strange behavior occurs. The playlist is unable to play the previous songs via the previous track button. This secondary issue is not present when tracks are able to complete normally.

### Steps to reproduce the problem (only for bugs)
I've not been able to consistently replicate this bug. At best when I notice it happens to a track, I'll replay the song, and let the last 20 seconds play out in an attempt to get it to skip again. I've been using 1.3.1 for over a year, none of the settings have changed in the menus. This is unexplained, especially because this issue seems to remain present even after an uninstallation, reboot, and reinstallation.
