It would be great if the support for diffable datasource is given! @dzenbot 
I'm working on a new project that requires loads of empty data set, so might as well rewrite this lib in Swift. A rewrite has been long due.

Just putting the PR out there for visibility for now. I need eyes on this code, specially for reviewing and applying good practices. I'm looking to simplify the code as much as possible, while still being easy to read and inviting for contributions.

This rewrite won't be exactly how it was proposed on https://github.com/dzenbot/DZNEmptyDataSet/issues/174.
This won't be:
- An Objc-C compatible version
- Fully backwards compatible. Most APIs will be, but not entirely.
- Fully featured like the original project. Instead, it will be simple and extendable.

Initial prototype is looking crisp.

How can I achieve Empty State being presented after data is finished loading? 
At the moment, the Empty state is presented for a split second before the data is fetched from the server. I would like the Empty view to be presented after this is done, so it will not be presented if there is data on the server. Maybe there is an option to have a separate loading view instead of an empty view? 

When I clicked on the blank page, the project crashed，and prompted that :-[DZNEmptyDataSetView setClaCustomViewVisible:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x10479ed50. 
Add `Package.swift` to `DZNEmptyDataSet`

**Package Resolution Failed**

the throw exception code is :
// If found, call original implementation
    if (impPointer) {
        ((void(*)(id,SEL))impPointer)(self,_cmd);
    }
sometimes crash I don't know why
In the method：**swizzleIfPossible**, there is a variable name definition error that will be misleading.
```
IMP dzn_newImplementation = method_setImplementation(method, (IMP)dzn_original_implementation)
```

According to the method method_setImplementation definition:
```
/**
  * Sets the implementation of a method.
  *
  * @param m The method for which to set an implementation.
  * @param imp The implemention to set to this method.
  *
  * @return The previous implementation of the method.
  */
OBJC_EXPORT IMP _Nonnull
method_setImplementation(Method _Nonnull m, IMP _Nonnull imp)
```
The following definition is more appropriate:
```
IMP dzn_oldImplementation = method_setImplementation(method, (IMP)dzn_original_implementation);
```
If collection or tableview have a header view or something that cause inset AND empty data set requires bigger area that available, it will overlap and should allow scroll.
