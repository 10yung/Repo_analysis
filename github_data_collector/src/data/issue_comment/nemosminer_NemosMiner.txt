7.9 was auto-upgraded to 3.8.  I was able to downgrade to continue mining.

HOwever, 3.8 is broken on all of my rigs.  I get the message in the title:
Cannot find path 'D:\Miners\Nemosminer\config\EarningTrackerConfig.json' because it does not exist.
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (D:\Miners\Nemos...ckerConfig.json:String) [Get-Content], ItemNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : PathNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetContentCommand
    + PSComputerName        : localhost

It keeps scrolling in red, and nothing else happens.
NemosMiner v3.8.0.0 and future Versions is now under a new Repository, as my Phone broke on me and i had 2FA setup and had not saved my ssh keys.

NemosMiner is being updated,  and can be found here: https://github.com/Minerx117/NemosMiner

pls add equihash 192 on nlpool . need a multiplier of 500 000 , as the profit is overstated by 2 times, and mixed Mh/s and H/s
hi, how can I add the intensity value in the command of ProgPowMiner?
Changes since 1.3.0:
- Fixed CryptoNightR runtime compilation issue on some AMD devices.
- Fixed hanging while enumerating AMD devices on some systems.
Changes since 1.42:
- Added Equihash + Scrypt algorithm for mining V-Dimension (VOLLAR/VDS) coin
- Minor improvements for some cards on Equihash 144,5 and Equihash 192,7 algorithms
- Support Aeternity mining on NiceHash
- Added ability to access environment variables from configuration files by %variable_name%
- Improved GPU utilization for high-end GPUs on Equihash+Scrypt algorithm (VOLLAR/VDS)

I have tested the cuckoocycle algo on NiceHash, but it was slower than nbminer and bminer on my rig (1080 Ti), so I didn't enabled here.
First of all. thanks Nemos and others for your efforts in creating this piece of software. Really enjoy using it.

Recently I noticed the earnings never match up. So my question is, which reading is correct?

As you can see, on the left It shows about 0.145 mbtc per day. But in the top right always a different number is shown. Usually somewhere around 0.029 mbtc which is much lower. And then when I check the stats on Nemosminer.com, it gets a lot closer to the earnings on the left. 

(To clairify, even after 12 hours it wont get anywhere close to the numbers on the left. Therefore, the I also don't know if I can trust the estimate pay date.)
Pls add LUX (phi2) algoritm at nlpool
gminer and bminer fail to run gminer "no nvml found" bminer "cuda error"

both are caused by nvml.dll not being include in latest drivers 

fails to initialize nvml on latest drivers fix

edit: found solution on https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/1100164/nvml-dll-and-nvsmi-folder-missing/
need to copy nvml.dll from c:\Windows\System32 to C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\NVSMI (create the folder if missing)

do both Program Files and Program Files (x86)
