When I try to debug on the XR, I get the following error:

> This iPhone XR is running iOS 13.2.2 (17B102), which may not be supported by this version of Xcode. An updated version of Xcode may be found on the App Store or at developer.apple.com.

Can you please add this support file
This iPhone 7 Plus (Model 1661, 1784, 1785, 1786) is running iOS 13.2.3 (17B111), which may not be supported by this version of Xcode.

It would be great if you can add this file.
Thanks!


Hi,

are you aware that there are other (pretty high rated) repositories on GitHub doing pretty much the same as you? At least I couldn't find any differences except how long ago the latest update was...

1. https://github.com/filsv/iPhoneOSDeviceSupport
1. https://github.com/Yatko/iOS-device-support-files

I'm gonna link this issues in those repos as well because I think
- if there are _no differences_ **forces** should be **join**ed;
- _otherwise_ the differences should definitely be mentioned in the **README**

(I don\t know any other way on GitHub to achieve inter-repo communication ðŸ˜‰)
Hi, I'm getting the following error trying to set up 13.2 on Xcode 10.1:

"dyld_shared_cache_extract_dylibs failed"

I've copied 13.2 to the correct directory inside Xcode, and also tried removing it from ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport first.

Any ideas?

This iPad (5th generation) is running iOS 13.3 (17C5032d), which may not be supported by this version of Xcode.
Once this has landed, you will need to manually kick off the first build at https://travis-ci.org/iGhibli/iOS-DeviceSupport and after that the builds are automatic on all pull requests.

https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html

On the flake8 test selection, this PR does _not_ focus on "_style violations_" (the majority of flake8 error codes that [__psf/black__](https://github.com/psf/black) can autocorrect).  Instead these tests are focus on runtime safety and correctness:
* E9 tests are about Python syntax errors usually raised because flake8 can not build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).  Often these issues are a sign of unused code or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in a dynamic language like Python they result in the script halting/crashing on the user.
* F63 tests are usually about the confusion between identity and equality in Python.  Use ==/!= to compare str, bytes, and int literals is the classic case.  These are areas where __a == b__ is True but __a is b__ is False (or vice versa).  Python >= 3.8 will raise SyntaxWarnings on these instances.
* F7 tests logic errors and syntax errors in type hints
* F82 tests are almost always _undefined names_ which are usually a sign of a typo, missing imports, or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These also would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in Python a __NameError__ is raised which will halt/crash the script on the user.
Here I am trying to connect with Xcode to the latest version 13.3.1 mobile device but it is showing your Xcode is not supporting the latest device version.

How Can I run the app on a 13.3.1 device from Xcode?
