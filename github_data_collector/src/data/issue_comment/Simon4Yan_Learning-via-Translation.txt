Thank you for your excellent work. 
During the style transfer, which epoch checkpoint should I choose? It seems that no difference can be seen between the generated image on different epochs.


Hello, I would like to learn about Local Max Pooling (LMP), but I can't find it in all the files. Could you please tell me where it is? Thanks!
Hello, which version of tensorflow do you use? I installed the version 1.0,but when I run ' python train_spgan_demo.py --dataset=market2duke --gpu_id=2',I got the error:ImportError: libcudart.so.8.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.
 How can I solve it ???

the details :

Problem: I trained directly on the dukemtmc dataset and tested it on the market1501 dataset. MAP:40%, Top1: 66.6%.I trained  on the duk2market dataset and tested it on the market1501 dataset. MAP:22.6%, Top1: 50.1%.I downloaded duke2market on your side.This is somewhat inconsistent with the description of the paper.The reid model is referenced https://github.com/dapengchen123/crf_affinity.Can you help me?Thank you.
When we try to train the baseline using train_IDE_ResNET_50_baseline.sh we get an error saying that this directory 'data/imagenet_models//ResNet_50.caffemodel' was not found. We only found a readme file  in 'imagenet_models'. We were wondering if we are supposed to add an ImageNet pretrained ResNet caffe model in this directory? If so, could you provide a link or tell us where to find it?

Thanks!
Hi, I notice in your paper, you have calculated the multiple-query settings. But I can't find the code.
Hi,I use Cycle-GAN to generate images from Market to Duke.But the results are bad.I find the results in your paper are nice.Could you tell me some parameter settings e.g. epoch,learning rate,image size ...
     Hi, I have some questions about your 'Direct Transfer' results in Table 2 in your paper. I make the setting consistent with yours, but I can't get so-high baselines, like rank1 33.1%, mAP 16.7  when train on market1501 and test on Duke-MTMC-reID. Actually I always got this result around rank1 27%, mAP 13%. And this result is better than those in the [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.10444.pdf](url), where this result is that rank1 21.9%, mAP 10.9%. 
     I wonder that is there some tricks used in your experiments, and I'm looking forward to your reply .
