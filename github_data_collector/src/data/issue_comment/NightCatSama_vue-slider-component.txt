There is a lot of props and that's great, but is there a way to set global config to change the default options ?
#### The feature

When component is mounted, but user dont start working with component, the component's field `userSelected = false`. When user start working, `userSelected = true`.

#### Describe the solution you'd like

Add the field `userSelected `or add handler for event `startUsing`.

#### If this feature is realized, please write to me - sanyaches95@gmail.com.
#### Describe the feature

Add Infinite value as Max.

#### Describe the solution you'd like

When Max is "null" then an infinite icon replaces the max number

In Chrome, there is a very small gap between the balloon of a tooltip, and its handle. You can see this on the live demo page, by setting the 'tooltip' setting to 'always', and optionally by zooming in:

In Firefox and IE11 I do not see this gap.

I have fixed it for now by adding this CSS rule:
.vue-slider-dot-tooltip-inner-top:after {
                top: 99.9%;
            }

I am using Vue 2.6.10, and version 3.0.44 of the slider.
Hello!

Big fan of this library, we find it really useful.

However, it breaks if I update from v2 to v3.

There's no release: https://github.com/NightCatSama/vue-slider-component/releases
And the changelog doesn't go back to 3.0.0: https://github.com/NightCatSama/vue-slider-component/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

What breaking changes were there?
#### Describe the bug
I am receiving below error on latest version ( to be specific 3.0.2 and above versions)

#### Environment (If you feel unrelated, please delete the block)

 - OS & Version:Windows all browsers
 - Vue version: vue.runtime.min.js?v=v2.4.2
 - Component Version: v3.0.2 and above

#### Describe the feature

Simple request: Making the dots to buttons instead of divs will enable them to be active when tabbing. Great feature for people using their keyboards. 

#### Describe the solution you'd like

Should be on by default, there really is no reason to not have it. I would go so far to say that it should not be a prop to choose.
When I transpile this component, I get the following tslint error
```
ERROR in /home/joel/projects/enterprise/packages/builder/node_modules/vue-slider-component/typings/typings/global.d.ts
â”‚22:3 Exports and export assignments are not permitted in module augmentations.
| declare module '*.scss' {
|   var content: any
|   export default content
|   ^
| }
|

```
If I add // @ts-ignore between the two lines, it works, but not sure what the best solution is here.

After initialisation if the data is changed the slider does not get updated. It does the update after a single click on the slider.

Open this pen.

After 2 sec the data will get updated but the dot will remain in the same position. It will get placed in the correct position if you do a single click on it.
Not sure if this is a request or more so a question.

Is it possible to if you have say 3 sliders on a page with range of 0 - 100 but none of the sliders could overlap in range?
Slider 1 could be 0-50
Slider 2 could be 75 - 100
So slider 3 can only use 51-74?

In theory I would like a scroller to be for hours in a day, but you can have different sets of hours for a 24 hour peiod, but hours could not be used more than once or overlap.

So Range could be 12:00am - 6:00am [6:15am - 4pm used so excluded from range] then continue with 4:15 - 12:00am
