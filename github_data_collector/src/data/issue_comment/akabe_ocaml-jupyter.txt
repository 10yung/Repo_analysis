`ocaml install Jupyter` produces errors, finishing with:

`The packages you requested declare the following system dependencies. Please make sure they are installed before retrying:`
    `zeromq`

```
caml 4.08.1
macOS 0.15.3 Beta
home-brew 2.2.3
```

fixed by `brew install zeromq` before `Ocaml install Jupiter`

Rather obvious fix, then it works fine.

Thanks - great project!
I want to write an OCaml function that will read the contents of a given cell and return them as an OCaml string. 
This is probably not an issue with a library, but I am wondering whether you think this is possible to do through the current API and if you can point me at the right direction.

Thank you and happy holidays!

Hi,
I'm trying to install ocaml-jupyter for jupyterhub.

My installation seems to work with python kernel.
The installation of ocaml-jupyter was successfull.

But when i try to open a new file with Ocaml kernel, i get that error. 
I think it's a permission problem, but i don't know which file/folder is concerned by the error.

Maybe you could help me.

Yannick

in the Jupyterhub new file when i click on Kernel Error :

I needed this to compile `ocaml-jupyter` on an up-to-date opam setup.
Greetings,

I am just starting to look into using Jupyter and your kernel instead of Emacs+Tuareg for my introductory course.

I am using [Arthur Chargu√©raud's kernel fork](https://github.com/charguer/ocaml/tree/4.02.2+improved-errors) (based on 4.02.2) which supports better error messages.

I was able to install your kernel under the appropriate opam switch but I have to pass option ```-easy-type-errors``` to ocaml in order to activate the better messages.

How can I do this ? Adding the option to argv in the json does not work as the kernel does not recognise the option.
