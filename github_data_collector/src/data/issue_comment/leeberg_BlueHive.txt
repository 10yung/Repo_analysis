Less Powershell - More Clickey Clickey
Add Documentation for requirements/setup of Honey User Auto Login Feature!
# Description
Currently, there are likely many UI / Data Elements that rely on a single domain, this should be cleaned up and full multi-domain management should be supported.

Messy / Not fun but would really clean up the script and make this a better project
**Describe the solution you'd like**
An "Advanced Options" picker would be ideal for customizing the accounts being created. The default (basic) behavior would ask as it currently does but an advanced option should allow me to do much more specific customizations for the accounts I would like create.

**User Accounts**
Populate: Phone Numbers, Addresses, etc.
Set Password

**Service Accounts**
Allow Specification of SPN Format - Select a Host
Set Password
