Hello!

Excited to make my first pull request to this repo! I found a bug when trying to install the CocoaPods-app locally, the instructions were failing due to a missing `rest` dependency that is invoked in the `Rakefile`.

The fix for this is to execute `gem install rest` which I have added as a short-term fix. In another PR it might be better to do a catch in the `Rakefile`.

Other than that, I added the use of `$` in the Terminal code snippets. Just a stylistic change more than anything.
Could you please provide the 1.8.4 app version.
CocoaPods App Not Working in Catalina, Can't create pod files for new projects and unable to find a specification for 'Pod Name' for old projects
When click the Install button, Display the error: [!] Unknown installation options: generate_multiple_pod_projects and incremental_installation.

SO this app should be upgraded for pod version 1.7+.

Xcode10.2.1 (10E1001) 报错 Unsupported Swift Version

This workspace has projects that contain source code developed with Swift 3.x. This version of Xcode does not support building or migrating Swift 3.x targets.

Use Xcode 10.1 to migrate the code to Swift 4.


I can barely see them:

This is the first time I use cocoapods on Xcode 9.3, I've been getting this error on any project that I created post-update, all projects that were created prior to Xcode 9.3 opened normally.

The error occurred whenever I tried to create a podfile.


this is the full error message that I've been getting:
