Noticed a typo while working with the package as part of a class assignment. Made sure to update the `ji_rx.R` file and not the `roxygen2`-generated file
I want to insert a few emojis into my `rmarkdown` document.
However, when I knit my document in the emojis won't render.
In this example the chunk render doesn't work but the inline one does:
``` r
    Example for not rendering:

    ``` {r}
    library(emo)
    emo::ji('smile')
    ```
    
    Inline example:
    `r emo::j('smile')`
```

But then here the inline doesn't work as well:
``` r
<font color='skyblue'>*Hey, you! Marine biologist! I have need of your services!  
A sea turtle begins its life amidst great danger, and not very many of them make it to the water. See, I'm working on a big budget movie - think "Saw", but with turtles. Anyway, let's make some realistic numbers of turtles for me to... **keep alive.***</font> `r emo::ji('turtle')`
```

I've updated everything I could think of (R, Rstudio, all markdown-related packages) but alas, and so I come here to look for answers.

Do you plan to upload to CRAN? 
Is there a function to extract more than one emoji at a time?

For example, ji('Germany') and ji ('Sweden') separately return the flags. However, ji(c('Germany','Sweden')) returns an error message "Error in find_emoji(keyword) : length(keyword) == 1 is not TRUE"

I see a function jis that looks potentially promising from the description but function does not seem to exist: Error in jis("Germany", "Sweden") : could not find function "jis"

Fixed diamond function as detailed in issue #45. 
New RStudio addin to easily select and click emojis to add to the source pane.
Useful for Rmd files!
It allows adding emojis as the icon or as `'r emo::ji(...)'`.

**Notes:**
Maybe it should allow fewer emojis to add, actually it presents the 4239 emojis listed in `emo::ji_name`. So the addin is not that fast.
Moreover, there are several emojis that in my RStudio Viewer pane are not printed.
``` r
emo::diamond()
#> Error in data$emoji: object of type 'closure' is not subsettable
emo::diamond("large", "orange")
#> Error in data$emoji: object of type 'closure' is not subsettable
```
