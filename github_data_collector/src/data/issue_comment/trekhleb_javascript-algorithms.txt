> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7

> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Cartesian product now returns empty set when passed an empty set.

I'm working on windows and had some issues with lint (which is why there is a weird commit about different eslint settings). This might mean linespacings are incorrect so sorry but I can't fix this if its wrong.

What I did: Clone respository. Navigate to repository using cmd. Run npm install.
Finds 2943 vulnerabilities.
Whether or not I ignore this doesnt affect the lint part.
Run npm run lint in the same directory.
Get Error with ESLint: 6.0.1, 6.0.0 and 5.3.0:
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! errno 2
npm ERR! javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures@0.0.4 lint: `eslint ./src/*`
npm ERR! Exit status 2

Id really like to fix this as I have a bug fix but I cant do a pull request as npm run lint never succeeds
