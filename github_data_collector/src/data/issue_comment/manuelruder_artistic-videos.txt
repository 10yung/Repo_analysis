As you may noticed from the title I'm completely new to programming. I'm absolutely amazed by this and I'm willing to start  learning.
Can I build this for Win10 or should I install Ubuntu.
Cheers!
Wondering if deepflow would be an issue to add. Thanks.
Hi there; in trying to run the actual artistic_video.lua script, the process appears to die rather quickly, with a not-terribly-descriptive error message:

The ffmpeg and deepFlow bit of things seems to work fine (I have a sequence of frames, and a sequence of .flo files, along with some "reliable.pgm" files). How might I troubleshoot this? 

Hi, can you tell me your ideal about how to calculate the confidence map of optical flow,?
I'm just fascinated by this technology, your work, your talent and competences ! I can't even install or run anything, I'm totally lost...

Is this project, that has lots of potential I believe, in the visual world, would have a chance to go further, with a friendly interface, extensions, portability etc... I guess the development would be colossal... Is there a future for this with PC/intel machines while smartphones get new processors with AI and Neural processing capabilities like Kirin 970 ?

Prisma Lab gave up with videos on Prisma app, Artisto from My.com, I'm not sure...

Thanks for reading.

Little modest experiment for further video projects https://youtu.be/izEuz1K34Ro

 
..... Sorry, I'm tired, I post this on the wrong project, I wanted to post it on your other github "fast artistic videos".
My bad :/
Hi, 

We've just released our music video and we mostly used your lib

We have very good feedbacks so I just wanted to say thank you. 

I've mentionned your lib on a post I wrote about the making of

Cheers !
Is there a way that I can make sure Artistic-Videos will make sure the final frame and starting frame of a looping video or GIF, will seamlessly blend together?
I'm using the default artistic-videos specific parameters from [stylizeVideo.sh](https://github.com/manuelruder/artistic-videos/blob/master/stylizeVideo.sh), and a custom set of Neural-Style parameters. I suspect the default temporal coherence related parameters are to blame?
I run `stylizeVideo.sh` with my own input video, about 10 seconds mp4 video, with GPU `TITAN X (Pascal), 12GB `, 4 hours later, I have't get the output...
