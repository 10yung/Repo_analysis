Since Buffer uses Kotlin in it's Android projects it would be great to define a Kotlin code style and check it using automated tools like [Ktlint](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint) and [detekt](https://github.com/arturbosch/detekt).

Fixed some typos and indentations of sample code.

Changed code fragments to be separated by regular commas instead of having them all in a single line.
