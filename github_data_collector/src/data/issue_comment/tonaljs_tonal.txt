## PR Purpose
First thank you so much for creating Tonal. It's been an absolute lifesaver for my app.

I'm making this PR to create a showcase section under the project's README. 

I'd be absolutely honored to have my app Solfej showcased on there.

Solfej would quite frankly not be possible without Tonal. There's some very complex music theory stuff going on behind the scenes throughout the ~80 lessons/exercises, and Tonal plays a key part in all of them.

## A bit about the app

Solfej is a music theory and ear training app (iOS, Android, Web).

As a self taught musician and guitarist I've always struggled with music theory. This has been due to the lack of true user friendly resources (the amount of nights I've spent down youtube/wikipedia rabbit holes...)

In the last couple of months I've set out to fix this gap for myself and everyone by creating Solfej.

The iOS version of the app is in beta with ~1000 users, and the android and web versions are being released soon.

Hi!

This question is not entirely tonal related but my best guess is to find someone with help here.

I have made an app ( you can try it out here: https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.stroopwafel.music.app ) where I use html entities for musical symbols like a flat or a sharp. The problem im facing is that on some devices the symbols have weird spacing and or styling and cannot be colored. Which messes up readability.

Is there anyone that has or had the same experience and knows a solution? I've tried using different fonts which are supposed to be good for musical html entities and changing them all to use an img (which doesnt work consistently aswell).

Thanks in advance.
In the example, 
```
js romanNumeral("bVII7")
```
is shown to translate to a major 7 chord; it should be a dominant chord.

Above this, in the summary it says:
>  A roman numeral symbol is a string like `"bVIImaj7"`

But the example shows "bVII7" being incorrectly translated to the major 7 chord.

I think that changing the example call to:
```js
romanNumeral("bVIImaj7");
```
Would solve the issue.

The documentation website linked in this repository description seems to have moved. When clicking the link, it shows the question "how do you get here?".
It seems tonaljs is missing a feature to output chord subs (or i just missed it being there ;))

For instance:
Cmaj7 can be subbed with Em
or Cmaj79 with Em9
G7(9) -> Bm7b5
G7(9) -> Dm6
etc..

Actually I would be fine with helping out on inserting it in tonal if it is missing and if needed... ive finished conservatory jazz guitar so have all the knowledge to make it work.
Currently it seems there's not support for advanced chords like Amaj7sus2, C6add2, etc.
The link on Github on the Code tab (http://danigb.github.io/tonal-app) is broken.
Hello, 

I am completely lost, I find some examples but I cannot get how I am supposed to use the library.

I would like to pick a root note (say 'G') and then a scale/mode, say ('aeolian'), and finally retrieve all notes in 'G aeolian' and get the list of all chords compatibles with this scale.

Are there guides to explain how to do that ?

Thank you.
Hi, I don't understand why considering whatever chord except from Cmaj7 (I tested some chords), the function chord() returns different chords (the inversions) but the tonic of the sequences of notes that I put in is ALWAYS in the second position..is it a bug or am I doing something wrong? 
Is there moreover a way to have always the same name of a chord without considering the inversions, so I can put notes in whatever order I want? Thanks in advance for the answers!

here some examples:

console.log(Chord.notes("Dm7")) // ["D", "F", "A", "C"]
console.log(chord(["D","**F**","A","C"])); // ["Fm7"] 
console.log(chord(["F","**A**","C","D"])); //  ["Am7"]
console.log(chord(["A","**C**","D","F"])); // ["Cm7"]
console.log(chord(["C","**D**","F","A"])); // ["Dm7"]


console.log(Chord.notes("Emaj7")) //  ["E", "G#", "B", "D#"]
console.log(chord(["E","**G#**","B","D#"])); //["G#Maj7"] but I should expect Emaj7
console.log(chord(["G#","**B**","D#","E"])); //["BMaj7"] but I should expect G#Maj7
console.log(chord(["B","**D#**","E","G#"])); //["D#Maj7"] but I should expect BMaj7
console.log(chord(["D#","**E**","G#","B"])); //["EMaj7"] but I should expect D#maj7

Hi, are there any plans to support solfege/solfa notation?

I recently started using Tonal in a project at SightReadingMastery, and it would be very useful there. I can imagine it would be in many other applications as well. I noticed [Teoria supports this feature](https://github.com/saebekassebil/teoria#notesolfegescale-showoctaves) as well.

Tonal is a fantastic library! Kudos to everyone who has made it possible.
