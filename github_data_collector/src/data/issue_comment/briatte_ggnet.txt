Are there more options to set the vertex attribute for grouping, except by using the ifelse argument?  

`net %v% "phono" = ifelse(letters[1:10] %in% c("a", "e", "i"), "vowel", "consonant")
`

I want to group character vectors that indicate the nodes in the network, but cannot figure out how to do it.
