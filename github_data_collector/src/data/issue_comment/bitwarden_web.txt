The `.csv` file exported from Lastpass stores credit cards as the following:

```csv
http://sn,,,"NoteType:Credit Card
Name on Card:FOO BAR
Type:Whatever
Number:1111222233334444
Security Code:123
Start Date:January,2015
Expiration Date:November,2021
Notes:
",Card Name,Folder,0
```

However the imported cards on Bitwarden don't get the expiration date imported, this information goes to "Notes" section.

Importing a CSV file generated by enpass imports all the entries without passwords. So it's useless.

When I import from 1Password 7 CSV all my login fields are imported into custom fields.  Password, User ID and URL are all in custom fields.  I have 500+ passwords to import.  Several are imported as safenotes with no way to add Passwords, User IDs, and URLs to the safenotes.

I am manually adding my logins as a fix, and many are out dated logins that I don't need, as making a custom CSV is not an option as the format of the exported CSV is too confusing for me.  There are multiple columns of Passwords, so I don't know how to fix the format to merge the Password columns.  

Also, one comment when deleting the bad logins I can't select all of them.  There is a limit on the website as to how many are selected.  I have to select all twice to delete all of them.

I can export my personal vault, which will include the folders that I have put my personal vault items in.

I can export my organization, which will _not_ include the folders that I have put the organization items in, even though they're right there in the UI.

As far as I can tell there is no way to generate an export of items in my organization that include the folders I've personally assigned to them.

This is bad.
It would be better if one could only close the add item window either by clicking save or cancel. I presume it would be a simple change. I might add a pr in the next few days.

PS: Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this amazing password manager. It really has made my life easier. 
Hi,

When clicking on Check Breaches in the Data Breach Report section, we get a failed to fetch.
This is due to the API V2 BitWarden is using being deprecated. 
It suggests to update to API V3 :

This version of the API has been discontinued, please use V3: https://www.troyhunt.com/authentication-and-the-have-i-been-pwned-api/
Keepass XML import seems to silently ignore images. This makes me worry what else might be excluded that I haven't noticed yet.
If I import a KeePass2 XML file with REFs the BitWarden can't unwrap them.

Refs are documented here: https://keepass.info/help/base/fieldrefs.html

Mostly they are useful to get over KeePass's single URL limitation. I have dozens of entries with reference e.g. {REF:P@I:46C9B1FFBD4ABC4BBB260C6190BAD20C} pointing to password in the UUID 46C9B1FFBD4ABC4BBB260C6190BAD20C, only thing differing is the URL.
Many websites offer one-time recovery codes in case the second factor is lost/inaccessible.

Example of GitHub recovery codes format:
```
xxxxx-xxxxx 
xxxxx-xxxxx 
xxxxx-xxxxx 
xxxxx-xxxxx 
xxxxx-xxxxx 
xxxxx-xxxxx 
xxxxx-xxxxx 
xxxxx-xxxxx 
xxxxx-xxxxx 
xxxxx-xxxxx 
xxxxx-xxxxx 
xxxxx-xxxxx 
xxxxx-xxxxx 
xxxxx-xxxxx 
xxxxx-xxxxx 
xxxxx-xxxxx
```

Similar codes are released by Google and many others.

I want to store those recovery codes in bitwarden.
I can see two possible places:

* Custom fields
* Notes

However inserting each code in a custom field is extremely tedious and error prone (you can't copy paste the whole block).
e.g.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11019190/65840114-10f7bb80-e315-11e9-8b64-b6081fb3197b.png)



Meanwhile the Notes can't be hidden, so it is a privacy concern if someone looks at the screen while you are copying the password.

I'd like something to address this problem.

The possible solutions that I can think of are:
* A button to hide the Notes
* Default to Notes to hidden mode and add the eye button
* Another field  "Hidden notes"
* Easier compilation of custom fields (inserting a value with a new line creates a new one?)
