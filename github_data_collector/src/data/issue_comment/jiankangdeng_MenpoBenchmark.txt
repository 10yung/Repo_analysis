Hi,

I am wondering if the pure 3D facial landmark tracking test-set (Video Test Set 111 in-the-wild videos manually collected from YouTube) mentioned in https://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/25830/1/Deng2018_Article_TheMenpoBenchmarkForMulti-pose.pdf is released?

Thanks!
First, thanks for your interesting contribution!

I've downloaded Menpo2D_semifrontal_train.txt and I've seen that it contains a set of 75 points. The last 68 correspond to the facial landmarks, but I am not sure about what are the initial 7 points. 
The four corners of the face rectangle and something else?
Thank you in advance.
