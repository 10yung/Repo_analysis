In Croatia, you need to have a different prefix for every point of sale, even if point of sale is digital. I, for example, sell cryptocurrency via one "point of sale" and sell consulting and coding services via another. It would be fantastic if there were an ability to not only fully edit the invoice number as per #15 but also to define a custom invoice number pattern that DOES auto-increment, but for that category. For example:

- `Category: crypto` => `1_01/XX/01`
- `Category: consulting` => `1_02/XX/01`

`XX` would be the auto-incrementing counter, defaulting to 01 if the pattern is used for the first time.
cross-env should only be in devDependencies

I've installed the system manually, and when trying to create an invoice PDF, I got a 500 - Server Error.
When debugging, I found out that an exception is thrown, saying "The PHP GD extension is required, but is not installed."

It is suggested by dompdf in its composer.json, but not mandatory.

I guess it should be added to the list of required extensions in the setup pages check.

My environment:
Centos 7, PHP 7.3.13, Crater 2.1.0
Got this error "Unable to connect to the DB with Provided Values." while on "Site URL & Database" installation page.

Environtment:
- digital ocean and ubuntu 18.04
As requested in the Discord #general channel, here's the PR for auto-adding the .env file and generating a app key if it doesn't exist.
Is there a way to custom the complete design and layout of the Estimates and invoices? Kind of important in my opinion. I won't be able to use the app in production yet, until I ca nestle the invoices exactly as I choose. 

Thanks for the great work so far!
**Describe the bug**
When I install crater with docker as described i can not finish the installation wizard due to the Error "SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] Connection refused"

**Expected behavior**
SQL connection can be established with the provided credentials (crater, crater, crater) which can be found in docker.compose.yaml or in the installation documentation.

**Please complete the following information:**
- Crater version: Git Master Branch (05.12.2020)
- PHP version: 7.2 (Docker Version)
- Database type and version: Docker Version

**Optional info**
- OS:  Ubuntu 18.04
- Browser: Chrome

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I would love to be able to accept payments from customers using Stripe.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
When sending an email to customers, they would contain a link to the invoice as well as a link to pay online, and Crater would use the Stripe SDK to process payments and record payments.

For development purposes I want to use Laravel Telescope with Crater app. I've installed Telescope and when I'm trying to use it (url:localhost/telescope), I'm keeping 403 error Forbidden. I've checked several things but I' didn't find a solution. Everything seems to be correctly being set. Any suggestions?
=)
