I have an existing matrix saved as rds file and I wanted to process it via bigstatsr package. But, I guess I couldn't grasp the concept of FBM and I desperately need help. Although I like and understand [disk.frame](https://github.com/xiaodaigh/disk.frame), I'm having great difficulty using `bigstatsr`.

My aim is to move a large matrix to an old computer with small RAM and I'll be doing random row selection as batches for some downstream analysis. (_since I'll be doing row selection, I'll be transposing the FBM in the sample code below_)

The matrix has 61,000 rows and 12,000 columns. The matrix is available as `bigm.rds`. My first step was to convert the matrix into FBM.

```R
bigM <- readRDS("bigM.rds")
bigM_fbm <- as_FBM(bigM, backingfile="bigM")
bigM_fbm$save()    # some functions does not save rds automatically
```
Then I noticed that the `.bk` file is 5GB and I was not able carry with usb drive due to FAT32 file size limit. Then I found out that `big_write()` generates smaller file size.

```R
big_write(bigM_fbm, "bigM_write", every_nrow = 10000, progress = interactive())
# bigM_write is around 1.7GB, carry that file to other computer
# in other computer, run the following
bigmat <- big_read("bigM_write",1:12000)
transposed <- big_transpose(bigmat, backingfile="bigM_t")
transposed$save()
```

Now I can process the file in new session as follows:
```R
bigM.t <- big_attach("bigM_t.rds")
test <- bigM.t[,1:10]   # let's get first 10 cols as example
rownames(test)          # let's get the rownames
                                   # NULL     oh no!
```
To my surprise,  colnames and rownames are lost, although original matrix had them. I know, `big_read()` and `big_write()` are for dealing with text files but due to small file size they generate I used them.
Also, I saw options for saving the matrix as chunks but I saw single `.bk` files at my each trial.

So, how can I convert an existing matrix to FBM, preferably with multiple chunks if possible, while retaining row and column names?

Would be nice to implement `plot_grid2()`.

I have this for now: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privefl/paper4-bedpca/master/code/plot_grid2.R.
Would be good to have an automatic way to choose the sizes of the title and the legend.
Part of #79.
See https://stackoverflow.com/q/59275888/6103040.

See https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_bigstatsr.html.
See e.g. if it can be used instead of `plus()` to save memory (and time?).
Would it be possible to add a sample weights option for the penalised regression functions (like in glmnet)? 


Possibly with `NULL` option to output a standard R matrix?
Do it in scaling functions?

This is a problem when using e.g. `big_randomSVD()` because it would either stop with error `TridiagEigen: eigen decomposition failed` or run for an infinite time.

Reprex:
```
library(bigstatsr)
X <- FBM(20, 20, init = rnorm(400))
svd <- big_randomSVD(X, big_scale())
X[, 1] <- 0
svd2 <- big_randomSVD(X, big_scale())
```
