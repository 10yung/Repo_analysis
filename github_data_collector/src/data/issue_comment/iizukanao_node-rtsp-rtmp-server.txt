Hi,
is it possible to use username and password for RTMP stream input?
I tried to uncomment the Authentication in server.coffee but it did not work.

I need to secure RTMP input ... can you help me?!

btw - thanks for the great tool ;)
Hi, is possible define max packet size for rtsp server?
I try this command:

but get this error:

Is it possible to limit RTSP/RTMP maximum sessions or clients?
It's possible to replace frames, for example to draw somthing over.
Hi!, 
I'm streaming the webcam with this command:

`ffmpeg -re -i /dev/video0 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -c:a libfdk_aac -ab 128k -ar 44100 -f rtsp rtsp://localhost:7373/live/STREAM_NAME`

In console I get:
```
  Metadata:
    encoder         : Lavf58.20.100
    Stream #0:0: Video: h264 (libx264), yuv422p, 640x480, q=-1--1, 20 fps, 90k tbn, 20 tbc
    Metadata:
      encoder         : Lavc58.35.100 libx264
    Side data:
      cpb: bitrate max/min/avg: 0/0/0 buffer size: 0 vbv_delay: -1
frame= 2047 fps= 20 q=-1.0 Lsize=N/A time=00:01:42.20 bitrate=N/A dup=364 drop=0 speed=0.997x
```

But when test with VLC or other video player I can see 3 or 4 second of delay.
Can I improve some parameter to get no more than 0.5 seconds of video delay?
I want to build a videoconference software.
Thanks!
