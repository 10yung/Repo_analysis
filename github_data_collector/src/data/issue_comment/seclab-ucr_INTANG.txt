Hello,

I have successfully built the mips32 binary for the Lede 17.01.4 but when I fire it up, it just hangs there with a redis error at the log.

What might be the reason for this ?

with INTANG, some website can be access, but not steady, next time U access that website again, which might be reset.

GFW now can filter TLS SNI field，that mean INTANG is important tool to against it.

Hope INTANG can improve to be a steady and useful tool.
I created hotspot. I try to work it on hotspot but ı cant open the bloking website.
How can i create service?
Hi,

I tried INTANG on ubuntu 16.04 and it worked perfectly, all tcp resetting sites worked fine but i don`t usually use linux, my main OS is freebsd and i want this to work natively with freebsd`s pf/ipfw (I made it work using virtualbox-bridged network adapter under freebsd as an ubuntu guest and there are no problems)

How hard would it be to port this to FREEBSD, can you provide any guidance on that ?

Thank you. 
In these days, the sensor starts a FIN|ACK attack before the RST|ACK(type 2) attack was sending.
Seems the FIN|ACK attack only applied for TLS Client Hello censorship right now.
The following error may occur when too many packets received once upon a time.
>"rv = -1. errno: 105. No buffer space available

```c
while ((rv = recv(g_nfq_fd, buf, sizeof(buf), 0)) && rv >= 0) {
    //log_debugv("pkt received");
    nfq_handle_packet(g_nfq_h, buf, rv);
}
log_debug("rv = %d. errno: %d. %s", rv, errno, strerror(errno));
```

It looks like it might be worth trying to increase the buffer size of the netlink socket
From https://www.netfilter.org/documentation/FAQ/netfilter-faq-4.html

>these are standard Netlink sockets, and you can tune their receive buffer sizes via /proc/sys/net/core, >sysctl, or use the SO_RCVBUF socket option on the file descriptor.
When ```send_insertion_packet()``` function handles a full-sized packet with ```INS_DISC_MD5``` flag on, send the insertion packet will cause a "Message too long" error, since the the packet length is greater than MTU size.
```c
if (flags & INS_DISC_MD5) {
    u_char bytes[20] = {0x13,0x12,0xf9,0x89,0x5c,0xdd,0xa6,0x15,0x12,0x83,0x3e,0x93,0x11,0x22,0x33,0x44,0x55,0x66,0x01,0x01};
    memcpy(vars->tcp_opt + vars->tcp_opt_len, bytes, 20);
    vars->tcp_opt_len += 20;
}
```

```payload_len```  may need to be fixed after the injection.
