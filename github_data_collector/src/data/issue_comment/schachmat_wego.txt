I'm working using wego as a module for https://github.com/wtfutil/wtf where I need to use `formatCond` in `frontends/ascii-art-table`.

Adding a new method in `iface.frontend` interface, which return the rendered text would be a nice addition.
Here's my attempt to fix #97. 

Fully tested and functional on my machine. If an old config (i.e. one utilizing forecast.io) is used, the user is provided a warning and the application closes gracefully.

I personally don't think any other special handling is needed, as mentioned and postponed on in #98. Doing so would require extra modifications to the functionality of https://github.com/schachmat/ingo to allow flag migration.
I was surprised that, along with Unicode thunders, unsightly ASCII quotes are used instead of macrons. Shouldn't this be fixed?

Originally, I posted this as a response in [@chubin/wttr.in#192](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in/issues/192), but then I realize chubin was using wego.

So as I stated in that report, I'm using KiTTY to access SSH to my Raspberry Pi 3B+ (because I like being a complicated person).

As great as Unicode has blessed us with ASCII symbol (and then Emojis), they almost have not business being in ASCII Art, and from the link I provided, there have been some complications with using the lightning bolt symbol in the forecast ASCII art, of which I can verify that, and my raspberry Pi still has a little bit of an issue rendering some of the Nerdfont symbols as that square in the red are should actually be the Raspberry Pi logo, so this screenshot is probably the best view I can get on a non-Linux system over SSH.

But here's the thing: The representation of thunderstorms with lightning feels cheap.  Take example this screenshot for the weather report and forecast in Jackson, Mississippi today.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1954239/53291397-28b40380-3778-11e9-8277-4c9db4d4344f.png) 

The lightning symbol works great if you are trying to pull up the small version of the forcast to fit it on the status line in TMUX or some other text console app, but for the ACSII representation of weather, it looks bad.

When you render here on Github, it looks like this.

```
Weather report: Jackson, MS

      .-.      Thunderstorm In Vicinity
     (   ).    82..86 °F
    (___(__)   ↑ 16 mph
   ‚‘⚡‘‚⚡‚‘  9 mi
   ‚’‚’⚡’‚’   0.0 in
```

So I though about something better. A short Google Search for lightning ASCII Art [yielded this example at the bottom of the page](http://www.ascii-art.de/ascii/jkl/lightning.txt).

Since that was too big, I tried shrinking it down a bit and came up with these logos. For all the following case, the lightning bolt would be colored yellow to differentiate that from rain. which would use similar characters. It would be wise that the color of the characters that make up the lightning bolt take precedence over the colors making the clouds or precipitation. 

```
    __       Lightning bolt (raw, no clouds or precip.)
   / /_,
  /_ ,'
   /'

   .--.      Thunderstorm (small cloud, no precip.)
  ( __ ).
 (_/ /_,_)
  /_ ,'
   /'
   
_`/"".--.      Thunderstorm (small cloud, no precip. with sun)
 ,\_( __ ).
  /(_/ /_,_)
    /_ ,'
     /'

_`/"".--.      Thunderstorm (small cloud, light rain. with sun)
 ,\_( __ ).
  /(_/ /_,_)
   ‘/_ ,' ‘
  ‘ ‘/' ‘ ‘

_`/"".--.      Thunderstorm (small cloud, light moderate/heavy rain. with sun)
 ,\_( __ ).
  /(_/ /_,_)
  ‚‘/_ ,'‚‘
  ‚‘,/'‚‘‚‘
	 
_`/"".--.      Thundersnow (small cloud, snow. with sun)
 ,\_( __ ).
  /(_/ /_,_)
   */_ ,'*
  * */'*
```
In the above version, I made the small cloud a little wider to better define the lightning bolts' appearance.  This next set would apply the ASCII art lightning bolt a little better.

```
    .--.		Thunderstorm (large cloud, no precip., lightning more centered)
 .-( __ ).  
(__./ /___)
   /_ ,'
    /'
	
     .--.		Thunderstorm (large cloud, light rain, lightning more centered)
  .-( __ ).  
 (__./ /___)
 ‘ ‘/_ ,' ‘
‘ ‘ ‘/'‘ ‘

     .--.		Thunderstorm (large cloud, heavy/moderate rain, lightning more centered)
  .-( __ ).  
 (__./ /___)
‚‘‚‘/_ ,'‚‘
‚‘‚‘,/'‚‘‚‘

     .--.		Thundersnow (large cloud, snow, lightning more centered)
  .-( __ ).  
 (__./ /___)
 * */_ ,'* *
* * */' * *
```

Overall, I think these would look better (especially once they are colored) that the current art.

I didn't include an art for the various types of winter weather but I would be interesting to see what that looks like.

I'm also think of how to better represent duststorms (which don't really have lightning in them all the time, but could), smoke, haze, fire danger, and windy weather. (While I applaud the color coding of temperature and wind speeds.  Some terminals do support bold and italic fonts. (Why those aren't used by default is something the Linux and SSH folks should really look into, but is beyond the scope of this project.

Other than that, I really like this project and would love to help make some contributions to it.

Keep up the good work!
I think maybe my pull request introduced an issue. The wind speed line is misaligned on all terminals now. The weird thing is, it was working earlier just fine, and now it's suddenly broken. I didn't change anything, so I'm not sure what's going on. I tried it in urxvt, xterm, and xfce4-terminal.

What it looked like before my changes:

What it looked like after (but before my pull request, this screenshot is from my changes before uploading them):

I'd like to update the version in Void Linux's tree to support the new backends, but I need a release to do this.  Would you consider releasing a new version?
This implements a simple image frontend that generates a PNG image.

This uses the font of the [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) project. The path to the `weathericons-regular-webfont.ttf` must be configured in the `.wegorc` configuration file before using this frontend (the other files are not used, so it is possible to download only this single file from the repository).

The sizes and colors are currently not configurable as I choose them to fit my current use.
This adds support for Weatherbit.io as a backend, based on the Forecast.io backend, because I had an API key laying around.

This adds basic support for their 5days/3hours forecast. I could also use their 16days/daily forecast when the number of days asked is greater than 5days, if someone is interested.
I would like to be able to further customize units. I prefer wind speed in Beaufort, since it's a more useful scale to tell me how the wind actually feels. Also, it would be nice to display both Celsius and Fahrenheit at the same time, so I can more easily tell friends in other countries about the weather.
