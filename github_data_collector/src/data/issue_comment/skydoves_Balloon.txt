For a balloon with multiple lines of text, having the balloon container scale with its height would be very useful. 

**Describe the solution you'd like:**

At the moment the `layout_balloon.xml` file uses dp values instead of "wrap_content".  If the layout uses "wrap_content" for height, the builder can drop `builder.setHeight()` and `builder.setWidth()`, and instead have something like `builder.setPaddingVert()` and `builder.setPaddingHoriz()`.  

Thoughts?
