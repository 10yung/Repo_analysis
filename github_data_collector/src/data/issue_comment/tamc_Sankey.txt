Hi,

Currently, Sankey delegate element of svg area to Raphael by using '#sankey' selector automatically.
But its way of assignment is not useful, because id attribute can&t exist more than one in one page.
I think, to select svg area freely is more useful.

what do you think?

... they refer as second and third arguments, fixes #9

I want the mouse over event or on click event on the node  to show the 

Is there any way to use the convert_flow_labels_callback to draw a percentage (i.e. the flow divided by its parent) in the label? I've experimented with things like:

 Sankey.convert_flow_labels_callback = function(flow) {
      return flow/this.dy;
    };

to no avail.

Thanks!

Hello.
In a diagram with only two stacks, I've noticed that the 'x' position of the right boxes is being wrongly calculated.

I have a 800x400 area, with the default 100 margin on each side. I'm using stack 0 and stack 1 for my boxes.
Thus, the result of the function 'Sankey.calculateXStep' would be (800 - 100 - 100) / 1 = 600.
For the boxes in stack 1 to respect the right margin, their 'x' should be exactly the result above, as both margins have been accounted for in the calculation.
However, they're being positioned on box.x = 100 + (1 \* 600) = 700, as per 'Sankey.position_boxes_and_lines'.
This should probably be changed to 'box.x = this.left_margin + (x > 0 ? (x \* x_step) - this.box_width : 0);', or some equivalent expression, assuming no negative stack indexes are used (not sure if this expression would work for more than two stacks).

Following is a screenshot of the issue, where you can see the left margin being respected, as opposed to the right margin.

Kind regards.

Hi,

I have a div for sankey diagram, On rendering am getting below code:
< div style="height:250px;" class="divTbl" id="sankey" >
   < svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" width="922" height="250" > < /svg >  
< /div >

I know by default sankey diagram take the width of the parent div. But when graph is rendered, on browsers I can see some of the diagram or text area's are hidden.

Can you please let me know how to resolve this. So that we can have a complete view of diagram in the given DIV.

Regards,

Rajesh
