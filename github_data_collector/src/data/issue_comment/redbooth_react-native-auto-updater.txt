When I add this dependency to my proj. the IOS always crash. Any solutions everyone?


Changes are made in ReactNativeAutoUpdater.java file. App crash was usually due to problems faced during bundle download. So a temporary file is created to store the downloaded bundle (temp.android.jsbundle) . If the bundle downloads  correctly the file is renamed to main.android.jsbundle. Hence, preventing app crash.
Hi,
   I use the following version of RN and created a sample app with the lib.Everything works fine the app asks the user to apply for new update.But after NOW is pressed nothing changes i can see no changes in the app.On further checking i found getJSBundleFile() in ReactNativeAutoUpdaterActivity is never called any help is highly appreciated.

Thanks in Advance.

in xcode i received below error:
Unable to resolve module `react/lib/LinkedStateMixin` from 
`.../react-native-auto-updater/Example/node_modules/react-native/Libraries/react-native/react-native.js:`
my package.json looks like this:
`{
  "name": "ReactNativeAutoUpdater",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node_modules/react-native/packager/packager.sh"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native": "^0.39.2",
    "react-native-auto-updater": "file:../"
  }
}

hello,
we have found an issue with you example. Please change
`- (void)ReactNativeAutoUpdater_updateDownloadedToURL:(NSURL *)url {` 
to
`- (void)ReactNativeAutoUpdater:(ReactNativeAutoUpdater *)reactiveNativeAutoUpdater updateDownloadedToURL:(NSURL*)url currentVersion:(NSString *)currentVersion {`
in 
`AppDelegate.m`
because right now after downloading update cannot be installed on iOS (this function is never invoked).
Regards

I can run the Example project, but when i add react-native-auto-updater import into my project and modify according to the README.md, it crash before enter the application. My React native version is 0.33.0.
I tried to debug in the react-native-auto-updater.js in the node_modules folder, it shows **Can't find variable: ReactNativeAutoUpdater**

```
/**
 * Created by Rahul Jiresal on 01/22/16.
 */

'use strict';

var React = require('react-native');
var RNAUNative = React.NativeModules.ReactNativeAutoUpdater;
console.log(React.NativeModules)
type Props = {
  isVisible: boolean;
}

module.exports = {
  jsCodeVersion: function() {
    return RNAUNative.jsCodeVersion;
  }
};
```

Is it the react or react native version problem?

Look forward to your answers.
