Facebook deprecated befriend APIs where we can create and accept a friend request between two test users.
Link to the API:
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v4.0/test-user/friends
Link to the bug I reported on Facebook where they confirmed that they have deprecated it:
 https://developers.facebook.com/support/bugs/1129010723972017/?disable_redirect=0

Now, `create_network` method throws an error like below:
```
Koala::Facebook::ClientError:
       type: OAuthException, code: 33, message: (#33) This object does not exist or does not support this action, x-fb-trace-id: CxSCgOPGDej [HTTP 400]
```
Description:

This PR includes changes which will help use the latest koala version when `http_component` is set

 Changes included:

- Parsing of response: when `http_component` is set, we receive `Koala::Http_service response` instead of a hash and `generate_results` method handles only JSON response. This affects all batch request. 
- include `x-fb-trace-id` and ` x-fb-debug x-fb-rev ` as part of the error_message returned



[X] My PR has tests and they pass!


Simply trying to load Rails console (Ruby 2.6.0, Rails 5.2.2, koala 3.0.0) gives this error:

config/initializers/koala.rb:26:in `block in <top (required)>': undefined method `alias_method_chain' for Koala::Facebook::OAuth:Class (NoMethodError)

Here is the traceback:

I dont know how to configure the koala someone can help me?

I am trying to post a visitor post to a facebook page using graph API(Using Koala Gem). Getting the below error,

Koala::Facebook::ClientError: type: OAuthException, code: 200, message: (#200) Requires either publish_to_groups permission and app being installed in the group, or manage_pages and publish_pages as an admin with sufficient administrative permission, x-fb-trace-id: DlkUWs8nor8 [HTTP 403] from /Users/sengottaiann/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.4.1@twitter_fix/gems/koala-3.0.0/lib/koala/api.rb:50:in `graph_call'

Can someone help me with this ?
This PR is for logging the request before sending it because in a case of a Timeout error by Faraday we can't know which request caused the timeout by looking at the logs.
I have noticed that facebook changed the format of the error sent to us.

Previously it was `x-fb-trace-id`
https://github.com/arsduo/koala/blob/master/lib/koala/errors.rb#L66
And now it is `fbtrace_id`

Example:

```
"{"error":{"message":"(#613) Calls to this api have exceeded the rate limit.","type":"OAuthException","code":613,"fbtrace_id":"ALBaekPexkW"}}"
```

it doesn't have the `x-fb-debug` and `x-fb-rev` so I'm not sure if they still exist 
I'm trying to publish a video to a facebook page that I'm an admin of via business manager. I have granted the publish_pages and manage_pages permissions via omniauth-facebook.

For whatever reason, the video is not showing up on the wall, but only in the videos library, and it is also not viewable by others. Doesn anyone know why?

```
page_graph = Koala::Facebook::API.new(page_token)
      page_graph.put_video(
        video, 
        {:title => "Check out my new listing!"},
        page_id
      )
```
There's a way for test koala with simulate facebook server? I'm using rspec and when run test, It use the reals facebook server, sometimes its failed by execution expired.
user_graph.get_page_access_token(user_token)

The above command used to work just fine but now gives me the error below from FB: 

Koala::Facebook::ClientError: type: OAuthException, code: 10, message: (#10) To use 'Page Public Content Access', your use of this endpoint must be reviewed and approved by Facebook. To submit this 'Page Public Content Access' feature for review please read our documentation on reviewable features: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review., x-fb-trace-id: AEuPtmLPH7m [HTTP 400]
        from (irb):9

I am not sure if this is an error on my end but this error started popping up.
