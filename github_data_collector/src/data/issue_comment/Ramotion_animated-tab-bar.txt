How to modify background color, text color and text size of badge

Swift version was 4.2 even though in the `Package.swift` it is 5.
`.swift-version` file is removed because the cocoapods deprecated it and using now podspec swift version.

`RAMAnimatedTabBarDemo.xcodeproj` didn't included the Demo scheme that was added.



This adds support for SwiftPM manifest based dependency managers. Specifically this adds support for installing via [Accio](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio) but will probably also work with SwiftPM once it's integrated into Xcode.

Please note that this project is part of Accio's official [integration tests](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio/tree/work/1000-frameworks/Demo/Shared/AppDependencies) within the [Demo project](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio/tree/work/1000-frameworks/Demo).
