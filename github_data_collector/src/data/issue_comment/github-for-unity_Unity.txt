Nothing special I run Archlinux and the issue happens every time with that extension.

[github-unity.log](https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity/files/4017224/github-unity.log)

Each time I make a changes & save my code within Visual Studio and then change over to Unity, Unity hangs periodically; the pointer rapidly changes between Windows waiting circle & back to the pointer, flashing about ever 0.5s.    While i'm waiting for GitHub for Unity to finish updating the repository changes, I can't use Unity at all.  Usually, this takes around 30s or so to clear and allow me to use Unity.

I can't justify using Git for Unity, if it's going to hang for 30s each time I make a change in VS.  These updates should happen in the background and not impact using Unity.

Versions:
Unity 2019.2.7f2
VS 16.3.4
GitHub for Unity 1.4.0

### Description

When trying to push, I get the error: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47460580/70915709-3e99fa00-2012-11ea-9b44-cd7d5b89c4e2.png)

My previous push (last week) worked fine with no issues. I've not changed anything Git related between now and then.

### Steps to Reproduce

I don't know what's changed on my computer to have made any difference. I've not touched the Git installation.

**Expected behavior:** 

No errors when pushing - I've been using Git for Unity for months now, but this is the first time I've had this problem.

**Actual behavior:**

This error above shows up, which is not reporting any version.

**Reproduces how often:** 100%

### Additional Information

I do not have Git LFS set up for this (or any other) project - I have never used it.

Checking my Git version using Git Bash shows I'm on 2.20.1.windows.1, but this is checking the version that I already had installed (before using Git for Unity). 

Pushing via Bash still works fine - it's only not working within Unity.

In Git for Unity, under Settings->Git installation, the paths lead to versions of Git and Git LFS that are specific to Git for Unity. Inside the folders shown there, there's a git-lfs.json file that says "version":"2.4.0" inside. I don't know how to check the version on the command line for these.
Hello, I apologize for posting two issues in less than a day( #1087 ), but something strange just happened to me while retrying to push some contents to my repo.
After waiting for one hour or more, finally I got a popup from unity but it did say nothing, just a popup with the title "Push" (see screenshot).

I have no idea what the error is but I attached an extract from the log, and if you ask I can post the full log later.

Reproduction:
-  Followed the guide [https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity/blob/master/docs/using/quick-guide.md](url)
-  Created a new private and empty repo.
-  Push the initial commit, like the guide says.
-  Make changes to your project, and commit them.
-  Press the Push(1) button.
 I think it's important to note that the project already existed before installing Github-For-Unity

--- Extract from the log --

[log.txt](https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity/files/3856184/log.txt)




Whenever you click the push button for large commits, you will able to see a "Pushing" text at the bottom of the window, but it stays for 20 seconds and it vanishes, no messages whatsoever.
Opening the Task Manager I was able to find that the Git procesec are still working, uploading the data to the remote server, but nothing is shown in Unity.

My suggestion is to put a info text, progress bar or just gray out the buttons while the plugin is pushing the contents to the repo
