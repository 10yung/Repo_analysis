After coming back to the tab where the code was executed for 2-3 minutes it did break the interval and letterInterval

Browser: Chrome Version 58.0.3029.110 (64-bit) on OS X
Greetings,

After inspecting the source code 2 properties have been encountered letterInerval and letterSelectInterval, I did expect that last one is responsible for controlling letter removing speed, but when I tried both rewriting the value of source code and defining on a constructor it appears that it affects both appearing and deleting the letter and letterInterval value is kind of ignored.

```
new Typist(typist, {
    letterInterval: 100,
    letterSelectInterval: 1000,

    onSlide: (text, options) => {
      options.letterInterval =  100
      options.letterSelectInterval = 1000
      console.log(options)
    }
  });
})
```

Can you please suggest what would be the proper way to control the removing speed?

It happens very randomly. Sometimes I just have to resize the box to make it work but it comes back again couple of days after. I can't figure out what's the cause of this problem. Here is a gif to explain my problem.

Thanks

It would be cool to have a way to specify that Typist only cycle through the variations once, or in lieu of that, an API method to call `.stop()` oneself.

Changed `bower install Typist` to `bower install typist`


when the text is long, the rendering time per each rotation text(typing animation + deleting the letters) can become longer than letterInterval, when this happens bizarre behaviors happens with typist :-p

https://github.com/positionly/Typist/blob/master/typist.coffee#L119

currently, the text from -data-typist is being split on ",", it would be awesome if we can have an option to allow custom tokenization of the data-typist and even the ability to pass an array of variations in JS.

Eager allows scripts like Typist to be installed by non-technical people.  The install.json file informs Eager-like tools how the script should be installed, and what options to collect.  In an effort to create a truly effortless install experience, we've also added some code around building the HTML syntax needed by Typist automatically.

This PR adds:
- A script to convert a list of variations into the appropriate Typist syntax
- An install.json file to let Eager-like tools install Typist
- A quick script to build files, which are now committed into the dist/ folder
- A blub about Eager in the readme

Thanks!

For some reason typist fails to publish on bower.

Need to investigate.
