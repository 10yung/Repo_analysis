@brotzky ran into this trying to finally fix the CI/CD workflow. Are you aware? 
I haven't checked where to use the Sharp 0.22.x version. (I'm sorry.)
But, I found it by looking at the issue log below. Using on Sharp 0.22.x somewhere.

So, It will not build as node 13.
Of course, I use a system like NVM, so I succeeded in building it by lowering the node version. 
I think there will be someone suffering from the same problem as me, so I will tell you the cause. :)

**Describe the bug**
I am switching my blog from native Gatsby over to this theme and one of the last features I need to get working is embedded content. In the old version of my blog, I have `gatsby-transformer-remark` working with a few plugins to get Vimeo and Instagram content rendering in blog posts. 

When switching to this theme, it seems they do not work out of the box. Either we should add docs on how to get this to work, or fix this. It is pretty important if people are switching from old blog posts.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Git clone my blog: https://github.com/aleccool213/blog/tree/novella-theme
2. `npm i`
3. `gatsby develop`
4. Go to `http://localhost:8000/hacking-my-honeymoon-with-javascript` and see that Instagram content isnt rendering.
5. Go to `http://localhost:8000/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-cypress-end-to-end-testing` and notice Vimeo video isnt rendering

*or*

1. Go to `https://deploy-preview-101--wonderful-lichterman-881960.netlify.com/hacking-my-honeymoon-with-javascript` and see that Instagram content isnt rendering.
2. Go to `https://deploy-preview-101--wonderful-lichterman-881960.netlify.com/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-cypress-end-to-end-testing` and notice Vimeo video isnt rendering

**Expected behavior**

`gatsby-transformer-remark` works with plugins.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I migrated my blog from Jekyll. All my posts have a title and a subtitle (an excerpt). It would be great to display the subtitle in the Article page optionally.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
At the moment, I shadowed your `Article.Hero` component. The subtitle is read from the excerpt attribute and is placed above an author. It's a dirty hack currently. It would be great to turn this as a flag in config or maybe check for an optional attribute in the article MDX.

Here's an image from my site:
![proposed-view](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4460766/71781781-f6e40e00-2fd2-11ea-9b34-7d9ab97c2638.png)

And here's a screenshot from Medium, where article subtitle is supported:

I can prepare a PR with the change. However, it would be great if you suggest a way how to integrate best with your theme.

Thanks!

**Describe the bug**
The [Publish with Lerna GitHub action](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela/commit/eada16c5ce2ce188e349982c8b116efd9dc0cfd7/checks?check_suite_id=372091617) is not publishing correctly when `@narative/gatsby-theme-novela` `package.json` is bumped. Instead, it looks for a bump in the version number of the root `package.json`. This results in a human needing to go back and publish `@narative/gatsby-theme-novela`.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to https://www.npmjs.com/package/@narative/gatsby-theme-novela and realize only 0.11.x is published.
2. Go to https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela/blob/master/%40narative/gatsby-theme-novela/package.json and realize `0.12.x` should be published.
3. Go to https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela/commit/eada16c5ce2ce188e349982c8b116efd9dc0cfd7/checks?check_suite_id=372091617, expand the `Publish with Lerna` accordion, and realize `lerna success No changed packages to publish` is logged to the terminal.

**Expected behavior**
A bot should publish `@narative/gatsby-theme-novela`.

**Additional Context**
Possibly related to #185.
I tried every variation in your docs but cannot get this to work with this theme: https://github.com/tengbao/vanta

Any help would be appreciated.
Hi, first off all thank you for this great theme, I'm loving it !

I need help to customize the styles of a component : I shadowed the header navigation component to replace it by my own header (with my menu in it), but it seems like the global styles of novela theme is overriding my own styles, especially the font-family and the font-weight.

I use a typography util for managing fonts in my site : 
```javascript
import Typography from "typography"

const typography = new Typography({
  baseFontSize: "18px",
  baseLineHeight: 1.666,
  headerFontFamily: [
    "Lato",
    "Helvetica Neue",
    "Segoe UI",
    "Helvetica",
    "Arial",
    "sans-serif",
  ],
  bodyFontFamily: ["Roboto", "serif"],
})

// Insert styles directly into the <head>
typography.injectStyles()

export default typography
```
And I also tried to customize gatsby plugin theme ui like so : 
```javascript
export default {
  ...novelaTheme,

  colors: {
    ...novelaTheme.colors,
    primary: "#000",
    secondary: "#73737D",
    accent: theme.colors.terracota,
    grey: "#73737D",
    background: "white",
    gradient: "none",
  },
  fonts: {
    ...novelaTheme.fonts,
    serif: "'Roboto', serif",
  },
}
```
The thing is that it seems to work for the main section, but not for the shadowed header which font-family and font-weight stays the ones defined in the global styles of the theme.

Any help will be helpful ! 

Thanks

**Describe the bug**
I'm trying to add LaTeX using [gatsby-remark-katex](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-katex/) but the string is treated as a raw string.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Install necessary packages specified on the [website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-katex/).
2. Modify gatsby-config.js according to the gatsby-remark-katex documentation
3. Add line `import "katex/dist/katex.min.css";` to either `templates/articles.template.tsx` or `components/MDX/MDX.tsx`
4. Add test equation to a mdx file:
```
$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$
```
**Expected behavior**
A equation should be rendered properly like below (from https://using-remark.gatsbyjs.org/katex/):
