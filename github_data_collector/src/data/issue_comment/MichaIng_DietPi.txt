Hi

1. I symlinked this folder `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/radarr/MediaCover/` to sd card, so when i open radarr webview i dont wake up my ext hdd
but i noticed few times that this symlink disappeared i quess after dietpi update, but not 100% sure

2. i have zerotier installed and i tried to acess other lan devices through raspberry pi on my local network when i'm outside. in tutorial it is written that i need to add this to `/etc/network/interfaces`

```
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet manual
 
auto br0
iface br0 inet manual
    bridge_ports eth1 zt0
    bridge_fd 0
    bridge_maxage 0
```
after that i restarted, and after few hours i was unable to do what i wanted so i deleted those lines in `/etc/network/interfaces` and now i notice that restart is much slower then before.. what can be issue?


Edit: about second question, i uninstalled zerotier and now rpi reboot fine and quickly, not sure why.

Edit2: about first question i also noticed that folder where i symlinked all posters are missing to. here is how i symlink files to sd card

```
mkdir /home/dietpi/radarr_posters

chown -R radarr:dietpi /home/dietpi/radarr_posters

rm -r /mnt/dietpi_userdata/radarr/MediaCover

ln -s /home/dietpi/radarr_posters /mnt/dietpi_userdata/radarr/MediaCover
```
### Creating a bug report/issue

#### Required Information
- DietPi version 6.28
- Distro version buster
- Kernel version Linux DietPi 4.19.75-v7l+ #1270 SMP Tue Sep 24 18:51:41 BST 2019 armv7l GNU/Linux
- SBC device RPi 4 Model B (armv7l)
- Power supply used CanaKit 5.1V USB Power Supply
- SDcard used Sandisk Ultra

#### Additional Information (if applicable)
- Software title SABnzbd
- Was the software title installed freshly or updated/migrated? freshly
- Can this issue be replicated on a fresh installation of DietPi? yes, the DietPi install was also fresh

#### Steps to reproduce
1. Use dietpi-software to install SABnzbd

#### Expected behaviour
<!-- What SHOULD be happening? -->
- SABnzbd should install and configure

#### Actual behaviour
<!-- What IS happening? -->
- The install seems to be using deprecated python 2.7.16 instead of 3.7. Both 2.7 and 3.7 directories are in /usr/local/lib. This results in the following error:

 ```

#### Extra details
<!-- Please post any extra details that might help solve the issue -->
- I've tried dietpi-update 1 and then reinstalling SABnzbd. It results in the same error and then hangs at the following prompt:
```

 DietPi-Software
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 Mode: Configuring SABnzbd: nzb download manager

[ INFO ] DietPi-Software | Generating initial config, please wait...
```
The SABnzbd service also shows a status of FAILED, and it won't start, most likely due to the initial install failure.
Hello I restarted the system after a Nextcloud installation but then the system no longer starts up.

I can only access it via a screen and keyboard.

I get that as a root login error...

-bash: /DietPi/dietpi/func/dietpi-globals: Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden
[FAILED] DietPi-Login | Failed to load DietPi-Globals. Skipping DietPi login scripts...

What can I do now?
### Creating a bug report/issue

#### Required Information
- DietPi version | 2.8
- Distro version | stretch
- Kernel version | 4.19.66-v7+ #1252 SMP 
- SBC device | rpi 3 model b+
- Power supply used | official raspi PSU
- SDcard used | sandisk extreme 128gb

#### Steps to reproduce
1 . from 2.6 upgrade to 2.8 using dietpi update

#### Expected behaviour
motd and weather should display as before

#### Actual behaviour
characters in both motd and weather are replaced with squares ■, similar to when you use the wrong character set or try to display utf8 characters on a non-utf8 compatible device

#### Extra details
not much to add, it seems to affect only weather and motd, but i haven't dug deep. I can do more research if you point me where to look

### Creating a bug report/issue

#### Required Information
- DietPi version | 
G_DIETPI_VERSION_CORE=6
G_DIETPI_VERSION_SUB=28
G_DIETPI_VERSION_RC=0
G_GITBRANCH='master'
G_GITOWNER='MichaIng'
- Distro version | buster
- Kernel version | Linux DietPi 5.4.8-rockchip64 #19.11.7 SMP PREEMPT Sun Jan 5 23:30:10 CET 2020 aarch64 GNU/Linux
- SBC device | ROCK Pi 4 (aarch64)
- Power supply used | 5V 3A
- SDcard used | Seeed Studio 16GB eMMC

#### Additional Information (if applicable)
- Software title | boot
- Was the software title installed freshly or updated/migrated? Fresh
- Can this issue be replicated on a fresh installation of DietPi? Yes

#### Steps to reproduce
<!-- Explain how to reproduce the issue -->
1. Write non-Radxa third-party image (i.e. DietPI, Armbian, Manjaro) to eMCC
2. Boot Rock Pi 4 with eMMC plugged in
3. No video, pings respond, but no network services (i.e. SSH)

#### Expected behaviour
<!-- What SHOULD be happening? -->
- Device should boot, display to screen via HDMI, SSH available across network

#### Actual behaviour
<!-- What IS happening? -->
- With a USB-to-TTL cable connected, you can see through the serial console that the eMMC has errors during boot:
```
[   48.357047] mmc2: mmc_select_hs400es failed, error -84
[   48.357517] mmc2: error -84 whilst initialising MMC card

[   48.552988] mmc2: error -110 whilst initialising MMC card
```

#### Extra details
<!-- Please post any extra details that might help solve the issue -->
- This issue is discussed on the Armbian and Radxa forums:
-- https://forum.armbian.com/topic/12573-armbian-buster-current-with-linux-54y-on-the-rock-pi-4/
-- https://forum.radxa.com/t/armbian-buster-5-4-6-emmc-slot-not-being-detected/2422/2
- Changing /boot/dtb/rockchip/rk3399-rock-pi-4.dtb to use mmc-hs200 instead of mmc-hs400 fixes the issue and boots properly

```
dtc -I dtb -O dts -f rk3399-rock-pi-4.dtb -o rk3399-rock-pi-4.dts
-       mmc-hs400-1_8v;
-       mmc-hs400-enhanced-strobe;
+       mmc-hs200-1_8v;
dtc -I dts -O dtb -f rk3399-rock-pi-4.dts -o rk3399-rock-pi-4.dtb
```

- DietPi_ROCKPi4-ARMv8-Buster.7z boots, automatically upgrades, reboots, and you need to apply the dtb change again.
- DietPi_ROCKPi4-ARMv8-Buster_new.7z boots, does not need to be upgraded, and continues to work after a reboot.
- This is a new Rock Pi 4A that was shipped to me last week. I have another Rock Pi 4A that is a few months older that works fine. I could not get either of my 16GB eMMC to work on the new device, so I'm guessing the eMMC interface on the new board has changed?

etc etc.

#### Expected behaviour
It will work like everytime i do it before (many times without problem, but last time i burn image with number, i thin 6.25? It was here for download maybe 10 days ago and it works)


#### Actual behaviour
I let it running many time till end (60 second) and nothing, do many restarts, nothing. write "systemctl daemon-reload" do nothing. When i write "systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd" i get same warning (Warning: The unit file, source configuration file or drop-ins of systemd-timesyncd.service changed on disk. Run 'systemctl daemon-reload' to reload units.)
Ping work normal, I can ping everything. But without time sync I can do nothing.

#### Extra details
after let it go till 60, i can change NTP server and if I click it i get:
DietPi-Config will now be launched, on the next screen:                                                                                                      
  - Select "NTP Mirror" 
 - Select a different NTP mirror 
  Once completed, exit dietpi-config to resume setup
I click ok and get:
[ INFO ] First run setup has not reached sufficient state.  Please reboot before using DietPi-Config. If the issue persists, please report this as bug.
Funny, cant set anything.

But I can click:
Override   : (NOT RECOMMENDED) Ignore failure and override time sync status
After this i can change my password and continue till dietpi software screen.

And after this all i listen you and try pool.ntp.org and it WORKS! I think i try everythink around, I try geteway, it work yesterday and before with raspberry 3b+, i try others, like europe etc, nothing. This work and now looks its close for me, but somewhere must be some problem, because i never have this problem and everytime i install it I use default and after clean install i start to make some change.
Thanks for advice with pool.ntp.org, but dont know if this exacly help, but I wrote you here exacly what i do ;)
echo 'ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="sd[a-z]", RUN+="/DietPi/dietpi/dietpi-drive_manager 3"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/99-dietpi-auto_mount.rules

So I got the new Raspberry pi 4B 2GB Ram Version and I want to use it as a file server and play retrogames on it too. So I have dietpi setup on a 32GB SD Card running docker with 3 containers. Now I want to play retrogames. I tried installing retropie on top of dietpi but I don't think that's possible. (if it is tell me). Is it any way I like dual boot retropie working buster image with dietpi without losing all my containers?
### Creating a bug report/issue

#### Required Information
- (Unrelated/Suggestion) Tell users to execute a script that prints things so we can copy and paste everything once (e.g.`DietPi version`, `Distro version`, `Kernel version`, `SBC device` and others).
- Maybe you could prompt users to manually enter power supply + SDcard in the script too?

#### Information
- Software title | `DietPi-Set_software`
- Was the software title installed freshly or updated/migrated? `Installed freshly`
- Can this issue be replicated on a fresh installation of DietPi? `Yes`


#### Steps to reproduce
<!-- Explain how to reproduce the issue -->
1. Accepting changing a password by accident.
2. You already did this in `/Dietpi/dietpi.txt`
3. Wanting to cancel changing a password.
4. Infinite loop.

#### Expected behaviour
<!-- What SHOULD be happening? -->
- Permit users to cancel changing a password or parsing `/Dietpi/dietpi.txt` to skip prompting user to change a password.

#### Actual behaviour
<!-- What IS happening? -->
- Infinite loop of prompting user to enter a new password.
