Hey,

I've been updating the `akka-dddd-template` to the latest version of Akka.  It's been an educational exercise, both with learning this template, and learning new features of akka.  

This is a WIP, but I wanted to create a PR so y'all can review and get some visibility into my changes.

Tasks
- ~~Upgrade to akka 2.4.11~~
- ~~Replace PersistentView with Persistence Query~~
- Replace spray with akka-http
- Add Gatling tests
- Attach DDD artifacts?
