I want to use tensorflow-api【c++】 to use CapsNet.  Is there such a possibility?
1. Y = valY[:num_val_batch * cfg.batch_size].reshape((-1, 1))

what is the use of this line in main.py?
2.Can we use the code for RGB image dataset?
3.What is the use of channel parameter in CapsNet function?

Changed Tensor.shape into Tensor.get_shape() Since tensorflow deprecated it.
How to determine the vector length and can anybody explaine to me about what it represent?
Is it possible to use in machine learning for medical imaging using MRI dataset?
Hi 
can you share english version of the blog posted at https://zhihu.com/question/67287444/answer/251460831
for understanding CapsNets?

Thank you

Hey, I was linked to this repository by an article that discussed a video summary of Capsule Nets. I think it might be in your Baidu share that's linked from the repository Readme, but when I click the link it loads _incredibly_ slowly (>3 minutes to full load, timed out first time) and the input box does nothing when I enter the suggested code "ahjs" and press Enter.

Is there a mirror for the Capsule talk, and/or the other contents of the share?

Thanks!
There seems to be a problem in V_k when calculating the loss in the function.

in capsNet.py at loss function (line 106?)

max_l = tf.square(tf.maximum(0., cfg.m_plus - self.v_length))
max_r = tf.square(tf.maximum(0., self.v_length - cfg.m_minus))

you use self.v_length when calculating max_l and max_r. 
self.v_length = tf.sqrt(reduce_sum(tf.square(self.caps2),
                                               axis=2, keepdims=True) + epsilon)
self.caps2 is V_J and V_J's Dim is [batch_size, 10, 16, 1]
V_J = squash(S_J), so all of value in V_J is (-1, 1)

if it calculate self.v_length, the dim of self.v_length is [batch_size, 10, 1, 1] and interval of value is (-4, 4)

so i think, it has to change like this
max_l = tf.square(tf.maximum(0., cfg.m_plus - (self.v_length)/4))
max_r = tf.square(tf.maximum(0., (self.v_length)/4 - cfg.m_minus))

if it is wrong, Can you tell me what 's wrong?
Hi，i'm Using Caps-Net to Handle High-dimensional and Small-sample Problems, but  train cannot converge。My data dimension is 6670, 2 classes. what should i do ，thanks a lot
