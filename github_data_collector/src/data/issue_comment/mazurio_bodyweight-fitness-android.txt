It would be cool if there was a dark theme for this app.
Note: sorry for the unnecessary commits in reason of switching develop-environment

Changes: 
- updates packages
- add editorconfig
- add new exercise in skill-section (skin the cat) with 3 progression levels (dead hang, inverted hang, skin the cat)
- changed tucked lever to timed
- when a set is logged skip to the next exercise or the next exercise within current bundle (see changes in section)

**Section**
- bundle: id to pair sections 
- sets: number of sets to fulfill to switch between exercise within a bundle
Hi,
Recently there were two changes to the RR structure:
1. Addition of the skin the cat (and also progressions of it: dead hang, inverted hang)
2. Addition of bent arm progressions in row progression (archer, one arm rows)

Currently when you use your volume buttons it adjusts the ringtone volume of the phone, which has no effect on this app's volume. This shows how to make it affect media volume instead: https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/dbbf3ea6549e82dee9e3c0df39bb5c3f74d3e189/AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/anki/AnkiActivity.java#L57

Using version 1.4.2.
I just did Molding mobility, the whole Recommended routine's warmup and finally Starting Stretching and at the Butterfly stretch the alarm didn't ring and it didn't ring for the next couple of stretches. I've had this issue for a long time, I didn't notice if it always happens after the same number of exercises.

I'm on a Motorola X Play if that changes anything.
Hello, thank you for your app! It is really good help for the beginners in calisthenics.

I thought it would be good to have levels for the warm-up, as we can see in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpobvFPR6hQ

I hope author would give you the permission to use the video excerpts.

Thank you!
Hello,

First of all, a big thx for this really usefull app.

I noticed several time that stats displayed in the "Statistics" card, the "Workout Length History" and "Completion Rate History" of "Today's Workout Log" are the same not matter what routine is selected.

Moreover, when I do the Bodyweight Fitness routine followed by the Molding Mobility one, Workout Length History (and other stats) of the first seems to be overwrited by the one of the latest.

Wouldn't it be better if each routine had her own statistics dataset ?
Taking a leaf out of the Seven app,
https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/seven-7-minute-workout-training-challenge/id650276551?mt=8

i.e. I want to hear that I have 3 seconds to go, 2 seconds to go, 1 second, and BOOM! Set done.

It's a relief to hear that you have only 3 seconds to go — the sound acts as encouragement to keep holding for those final 3 seconds.

I'm a software developer (obviously) so if you want help with this @mazurio I might be able do make this tweak.
Really only just discovered r/ bwf and your app. Looks fantastic! Thanks for your work!

As per the Recommended Routine FAQ 
https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine#wiki_do_i_rest_90sec_between_every_exercise.3F.2Fsomething_confused_something_how_into_pairs

Exercises should be paired if you meet the requirements. 
Currently the tuck front lever shows up as a dynamic rep workout instead of the "10-30s" static hold as described in the reddit description.
