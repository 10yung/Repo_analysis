When you start the installer, you will find there is a bit of blurry and overlapping text as shown in the following screenshot:

When converting from TTF app doesn't build OTF file, yet it links to it in CSS (while not linking to TTF)
Hey, thanks for this nice app! It's very useful.

Would it be possible to make an option to generate a single css file instead of one for each font as fontprep used to do?
This would be amazing.

Thanks!
Can you build same application for windows?
Awesome tool.

Though I would like to do the conversion the other way around.
From `WOFF` or `WOFF2` to `TTF`.
Thanks for this tool, it works very nice and fast! I do have a small feature request though.

FontPrep had the ability to subset the selected font(s) to only convert a certain character range. The advantage of this that the converted webfonts would be of a significantly smaller file size as unneeded character(s)/ranges can be left out.

I can't find this option in FontPlop, but I would be very interested in this feature (and most certainly, a lot of other people as well ðŸ˜‰). Can this be added to FontPlop?
