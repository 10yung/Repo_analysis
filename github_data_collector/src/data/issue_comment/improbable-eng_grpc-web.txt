**Versions of relevant software used**
- bug doesn't exist on v0.9.1 of this repo
- bug exists on current latest version (as of this writing) v0.12.0 of this repo

**What happened**
Following the react-typescript + golang grpcweb example from this repo exactly, I was seeing HTTP 500s in the browser. The only thing I would see in the response would be "gRPC requires a ResponseWriter supporting http.CloseNotifier". 

Googling this error code didn't lead me to anything useful. The one thing I did notice that fixed my problem, was that your example code had last been edited on April 11th 2019. I bumped down my version of improbable-eng/grpc-web to 0.9.1 (released in Feb 2019) and voila, problem solved. 

I have no clue as to what could be causing this but I just wanted to post this in case anyone else was running into the same issue with the example.

*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Added bazel BUILD files in order to be able building `grpcweb` and `grpcwebproxy` with the bazel build system. I already use grpcwebproxy and build it with bazel so I thought maybe we can add it here too. One thing to notice: I couldn't compile the tests for grpcweb. I have actually almost no knowledge about go. Maybe someone can help me to get it compile and run.

Not sure, but it could solve parts of https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web/issues/197

## Changes

* Bazel WORKSPACE setup
* Added all required go dependencies
* Added build targets for grpcweb and grpcwebproxy

## Verification

```
bazel build ...
bazel run //go/grpcwebproxy -- --help
```

## Changes

on go/grpcweb
Change the error returned by webSocketWrappedReader.Read when the frame is a single byte of value 1 (which indicates the client has finished sending) from io.EOF to nil.
Rationale:
When a stream request is made using a websocket, `handleWebSocket` (wrapper.go)  is called. This function run `server.ServeHTTP` to proxy the stream. Aside of forwarding messages from the server to the client, it reads messages coming from the websocket using the `webSocketWrappedReader.Read` method (websocket_wrapper.go), but this method was returning an `io.EOF` error when a end-of-message frame was received.
The fact is that the grpc.Server reads on the websocket until an error is returned by the read. 
So when the wrapper was reading the end of the first message received by the client (the initial stream request), it was returning EOF and the grpc.ServerHTTP reader routine was stopped.

Then nobody was reading on the websocket after the first message was sent from the client, so when the closed event was sent from the frontend on a refresh or tab closed i.e, it could not detect it and close the entire stream.

## Verification
I tested with my project which open infinite streams and I runned the go test, but more test could be done.
