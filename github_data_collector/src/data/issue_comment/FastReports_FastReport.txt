When I install NuGet package in a .netcore 3.0 winforms app there is a conflict with the classes in the file WindowsFormsReplacement.cs. ¿Could you add new target framework for .netcoreapp3.0?

Is it on the agenda to add a method to print directly?

The text cannot be automatically resized when it is set
TableCell Name="Cell6" Border.Lines="All" Border.Color="Silver" Text="**深蓝色简约大气风格双肩包**"

In another case, it's OK
TableCell Name="Cell6" Border.Lines="All" Border.Color="Silver" Text="**这是内容啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊**"

I guess the width of the content word is set as a positive multiple of the width, so there is no problem？

How can I display all the words？


Hello!

Just downloaded FastReport Community Designer.
we're using Postgresql version 12 and latest version (4.x) of Npgsql.

When creating a Data Source for my first Report Template, the test connection for Postgresql i specified succeeded but when i tried to select a table for use in my report template, i got the following error:
ERROR: 42703 column ad.adsrc does not exist

which seems related to:

https://github.com/npgsql/EntityFramework6.Npgsql/issues/138

I believe Npgsql's latest driver does not have this problem, but it seems FastReport is still using version 3 of Npgsql and has not updated to version 4?

Please see attached PNG for additional info.

Thanks!

Hi,
I created am ASP.NET Core MVC example following your instructions.
The report is shown but the Report Viewer Menu icons are not shown.
The following URL is not found:

**https://localhost:44315/_fr/resources.getResource?resourceName=reload.svg&contentType=image%2Fsvg%2Bxml**

Should I copy the *.svg files somewhere in my Project ? wwwroot ?

The report images, like the one below, are shown correctly:

**https://localhost:44315/_fr/preview.getPicture?reportId=fb75003bfca3405fa6a869b562dbfd44&pictureId==65F5CDB906DC0D3B1F5504044AACED48**

Thanks

> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Hi,

My webapi return this json sctructure
![myjson](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15343678/71497872-d8468000-2838-11ea-83c0-be5c30b81219.PNG)

this name-value "marca" image is in base64 format, works perfectly when converting and also works in fastreport when using TextRenderType = HtmlTags property
![work fine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15343678/71497981-48550600-2839-11ea-9cbe-0b84fce26be4.PNG)

**First problem:**
![problems](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15343678/71498028-789ca480-2839-11ea-904c-9affc32a487c.PNG)
![dont respect](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15343678/71498196-21e39a80-283a-11ea-9df2-c4f2627c9059.PNG)

fastreport community renders the image but doesn't respect the html width and heigth tags so I can resize the image, detail that the object is a text and not a picture
**Obs: works fine on webreport**

**Second problem:**
Simply placing the object formatted by the designer in the report generates the following error:
![problem 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15343678/71498144-ef39a200-2839-11ea-80c4-35126ea62438.PNG)
![problem 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15343678/71498148-f19bfc00-2839-11ea-8ad6-42e4bbaaca2b.PNG)


**In CrystalReport(SAP) when I made this bind I used the picture object (fastreport don't work), 
as it is today, I have to manipulate the image to upload it to be right in the report**
Works Perfect on FastReport Community (Preview)
![preview ok](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15343678/71198680-14934280-2273-11ea-848b-f5fb16d76578.PNG)


Works Perfect on WebReport
![webreport ok](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15343678/71198697-22e15e80-2273-11ea-8a8e-03d7ab2155e6.PNG)

But when I send it to the printer, whatever it is, it doesn't print some shapes
![print or export](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15343678/71198741-3d1b3c80-2273-11ea-8064-da3d41a0a693.PNG)

Hi!

There are some fields I need to format, I created the following (function:
```
(...)
using System.ComponentModel;
(...)
private string FormatMask(string value, string mask)
    {
      MaskedTextProvider pro = new MaskedTextProvider(mask);
      pro.Add(value);
      return pro.ToString();
    }
```

Works perfectly in FastReport Community (Preview Mode)
![work design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15343678/71175637-ccf6c180-2246-11ea-8121-1f7284f6a26b.PNG)

But when using in webreport presents the error attached:
![error webreport](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15343678/71175641-cec08500-2246-11ea-9ce0-9988f0a52136.PNG)

but it did not work

Hi!

Version 2019.4.0
![work](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15343678/70579443-665f0d00-1b8f-11ea-8364-4a5d2b8e1b87.PNG)

I even updated the project demo (FastReport.OpenSource.Web.MVC) itself and it gave the same problem.
