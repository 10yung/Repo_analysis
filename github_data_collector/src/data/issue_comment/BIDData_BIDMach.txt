First draft of GradCollide on multiple nodes. I have not tested this code.

Also contains some optimizations to the ElasticAverageBinder and miscellaneous typofixes.

it is how it is shown
IPTW
BIDMach has several basic causal estimators. IPTW stands for Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting and is a widely used method technique for causal inference with binary treatments. We start with some data features <math>X</math>, a response <math>Y</math>, and a "treatment" <math>Z</math>. In causal inference we are interested in the effects of directly changing <math>Z</math> on <math>Y</math>. This is different from the conditional probability of <math>Y</math> given <math>Z</math> which depends on joint probability distribution of the system "as is".

I tried to run testsmf.ssc on Netflix dataset. For all the cases d=32 to d=512 RMSE is 1.05, which cannot be true. I tried running testsfa.ssc script on the same dataset. There I get RMSE ranging from .92 to .95 which is acceptable. Is the prediction function wrong? I tried to use same prediction function but that did not work either. 

Any kind of help will be really appreciated.
I have systems where the only version of CUDA available is 9.  Can we get BidMach to run along with v9?
Hi,

I am running into some array dimension mismatches in the Net.evalbatch function due to a change in the code.  Currently, the master branch has:

  		val scores = zeros(score_layers.length, batchSize);
  		for (i <- 0 until score_layers.length) {
  			scores(i,?) = score_layers(i).score;
  		}

which has given the scores matrix a vector for each layer rather than a scalar for each layer.  

Previously, each score layer only had a scalar score available:

   		val scores = zeros(score_layers.length, 1);
  		for (i <- 0 until score_layers.length) {
  			scores(i) = score_layers(i).score.v;
  		}

Is there a reason that this has changed?  It certainly seems to be making e.g. the GLM layer break when used as an output layer.

Change happened here:

Cheers,
When i run getdata.sh file to download all the dataset in data folder so after all data get download a error comes like  "/home/bizruntime40/BIDMach/scripts/../cbin/tparse.exe: No such file or directory " and same for trec.exe so i want to know where is this two files. And also there is no cbin folder inside scripts folder So Please Explain


Generating k-best is the next priority, but this is a good start.
Seems to work on the MNT2015 english to french dataset (more concrete results soon)

This is coupled with https://github.com/BIDData/BIDMat/pull/77
