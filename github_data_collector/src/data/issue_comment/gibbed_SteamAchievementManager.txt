Could you add a button that hides unlucked achievements ? or at least an option to sort it by unlock status, I'ts pretty hard to search for achievements in games that have hundreds of them :)
I have Steam installed on 2 systems - 

- Windows 10
- Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS

I used SAM to set achievements of a game (say, Fallout Shelter) in my Windows machine. But those changes aren't reflected in the Steam client installed on my Ubuntu machine. Any idea why/how to make them sync?
It would be useful if we could set delays or specific times for unlocks, for example:

- you have those "5000 achievement with 1 unlock per second" spam games that frequently bug out and need to be restarted multiple times before unlocking everything; SAM could be used to delay unlocks at 1 per second instead of unlocking all at same time.
- there are repetitive games with multiple "kill n enemies" where n could be 10, 100, 1000 and 2500; SAM could be set to unlock "kill 10 enemies" at 02:10, "kill 100 enemies" at 02:44, "kill 1000 enemies" at 08:29, etc.

The second example would be the most useful since an user could easily get times from other websites, set up SAM and do more interesting stuff, like watching a movie, playing other games or sleeping.
I am using wine version 4.19

1. Activate next release game
2. Button to Install don't show
3. Run SAM
4. Find app/game ID
5. Try open

Hello,
I have been using SAM 7.0.25.
But a few hours ago, I found this program isn't working.
Actually, the program works, but game lists don't appear but only a black screen appears.
![SAM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54477775/63639362-2aca3100-c6cd-11e9-9b43-86cf80fe678a.JPG)

I did these things to solve this.

1. Rebooting my computer.
2. Checking firewall access.(SAM and steam)
3. Reinstall Steam and SAM.
4. Just waiting.

Could you please provide a solution to this problem?
Thank you and have a nice day.



Is there a way to run these apps on mac os? This would be very useful. Also, if there is a chance that a Mac version is coming out, when would that occur?
Is it doing 'some fancy magic', with hex editing and some trickery to unlock these achievements, or is it sending the steam servers the same instructions the game would normally?

Basically asking if its safe to use or im at some risk of getting banned. Because if this just fakes being in a game, and then sends the same instructions to the steam servers the actual game would, then its fine and i wont get banned. On the other hand, if you found a way to circumvent steam's achievement system to unlock these, then thats risky.

I know im on github, and that i could check, but i dont know what the commands inside the files mean.... I understand their logic, i just dont know any of the function's of the commands, so im asking instead of checking.... Sorry
To reduce code footprint.
