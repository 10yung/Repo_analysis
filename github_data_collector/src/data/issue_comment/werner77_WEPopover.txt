-[UITableViewCellContentView translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints]: unrecognized selector

Fix is quite easy (various ways to do it, but one option is below). Change Line 858 in WEPopoverController.m to:

           if (view.autoresizingMask != UIViewAutoresizingNone || ([view respondsToSelector:@selector(translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints)] && !view.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints)) {

If you set WEPopoverContainerViewProperties.shadowColor to a solid color, it doesn't work as expected. This is because the -shadowView is empty and thus won't cast any shadow.

The solution is to manually provide a shadow path. You will have to adjust the path or the WEPopoverContainerViewProperties's background image or margins.

You can put this line inside [WEPopoverContainerView -initFrame] after the -shadowView frame is set:

	....
	_bgView.frame = _bgRect;		// PROVIDED FOR CONTEXT
	_shadowView.frame = _bgRect;	// PROVIDED FOR CONTEXT

	// set shadow path here when shadowView.frame is set.
	// we need it since the shadowView is empty and won't cast any shadow.
	_shadowView.layer.shadowPath = CGPathCreateWithRect(_shadowView.bounds, NULL);
	....

Hi, 

First, thanks a lot for your great work.

Here is what I'm trying to achieve : 
I have a UITableView with custom cells subclassed. Cells are composed of some buttons that should present WEPopover on touch. The touch action is implemented in the cell's subclass. I would like to allow Up and Down arrow directions as in the Demo project. 

I succeeded in presenting the popover but arrow directions seemed to be ignored. Indeed, whatever the space available, it's always the same direction. 

Here is the code used in cell's subclass : 

`[self.likeCommentPopoverController presentPopoverFromRect:self.commentNumberButton.frame
                                                       inView:self
                                     permittedArrowDirections:(UIPopoverArrowDirectionUp | UIPopoverArrowDirectionDown)
                                                     animated:YES];`

I tried to present it from tableView but it doesn't work : 

`CGRect rect = [self.superview.superview convertRect:self.commentNumberButton.frame fromView:self];
[self.likeCommentPopoverController presentPopoverFromRect:rect
                                                       inView:self.superview.superview
                                     permittedArrowDirections:(UIPopoverArrowDirectionUp | UIPopoverArrowDirectionDown)
                                                     animated:YES];
`

Have you got an idea to achieve this ?

Thanks a lot.

for example, iOS 9 need a rootViewController set to window, add other little change.

Sadly, there were still some issues on Popover, it can't run as well as iOS 7 and before.

I just want to be clear the project on Xcode 7.0.

I had to increase the border for the background arrow by one, otherwise I had a border of one pixel between the popup body and the pointing triangle.

be3d3c9 makes WEPovoer more similar to the iOS 7 UIPopoverController.

Add round(x)/round(y) at the end of calculating the origin of arrow to avoid blurring drawing.
