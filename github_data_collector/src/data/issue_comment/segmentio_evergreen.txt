Needs PR #699 For the `useTheme` docs 

I'm not exactly sure the full scope/capabilities of theming atm. If there's a feature I'm missing feel free to let me know.

And regarding the copy, feel free to make suggestions + edits :)

I'll probably end up filling out the Theme Object attributes in another pr.
Curious if there are any plans to introduce either WebPack or Rollup to build/minify the code rather than just using babel to transpile.

Reason being using a bundler can help bring down bundle sizes and remove dead code
This change (or something to the effect of this change) is required in order for future usage of hooks.

The problem is that when you run the `docs`, it's using the locally built `evergreen-ui` which has one version of React while the `docs` have another.

The error can be explained here https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991.

I'm not sure if this is the best course of action in order to make hooks work in the `docs` app, but after converting the `Spinner` component to use hooks (worked in storybook but not `docs`), this ended up working.
