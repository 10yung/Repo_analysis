Hi,
do you have any plan for updating?
thanks for this awesome library
+ Some fixes
1.  run the project
2. tap on the first button
3. tap on the <- button

the app crashes
on line:  let toView   = transitionContext.view(forKey: .to)!
Fatal error: Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional
When I try to add the package using SPM Xcode throws the following error:

When you put the secondVC (following the example) with a TabBarViewController its not working. 
If I put an animation block inside the stop animation completion block, It does not animate anything. Here is a sample code:
```
@IBAction func redeemPPressed(_ sender: Any) {
        let button = sender as! TransitionButton
        button.startAnimation() // 2: Then start the animation when the user tap the button
        let qualityOfServiceClass = DispatchQoS.QoSClass.background
        let backgroundQueue = DispatchQueue.global(qos: qualityOfServiceClass)
        backgroundQueue.async(execute: {
            
            sleep(1) // 3: Do your networking task or background work here.
            
            DispatchQueue.main.async(execute: { () -> Void in
                // 4: Stop the animation, here you have three options for the `animationStyle` property:
                // .expand: useful when the task has been compeletd successfully and you want to expand the button and transit to another view controller in the completion callback
                // .shake: when you want to reflect to the user that the task did not complete successfly
                // .normal
                
                button.stopAnimation(animationStyle: .normal,revertAfterDelay: 1.0,completion: {
                    UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
                        button.isHidden = true
                        self.codeView.isHidden = false
                    })
                })
            })
        })
    }
```
Hi ðŸ‘‹,

My name is Svyat. Thank you very much for your `TransitionButton` project.

I would like to suggest new `isAnimating` property.
It could be useful to check programmatically if spinning animation is running or not.
The main reason I need this property is ability to check animation state in unit tests.
Seems like the button is not covering the entire screen before transitioning or is just choppy. Not sure if I am just implementing wrong or an issue with the animation itself. Thanks. 
Hi, is there any way for button in a table view cell to cover whole the view in controller when expand?
My transition button title disappears after a few seconds I have tried by auto layout and programmatically too. Please help me if I am missing something
