I tried to even update the gradle plugin, but it keeps failing.

At first it shows this:

And after trying to update, it shows this:

Proposed migration to Kodein 5.
I'm trying to build this via ./gradlew clean build and I'm getting following error :

```AndroidTestCase``` and ```ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2``` come from old and deprecated Android platform testing API.

May we consider to migrate current UI tests to Espresso 3.0?
`   val createdView = albumsFragment.onCreateView(layoutInflater, null, null) `
`  // Then
  assertNotNull(albumsFragment.adapter)`

is failing as the container is null, if we mock the container it will fail as it will search for the context. 

DO NOT MERGE.

This is a sample proof of concept refactoring the app to use a monad transformer stack pushing Kotlin as much as it can go with FP and functional combinators. This PR will remain as such as is not intended to be merged but showcases a different style of coding in Kotlin similar to that found in Scala or Haskell.

The obvious limitation is the lack of support for Higher Kinds having to implement manually most of the combinators found on types such as `EitherT[F[_], L, R]` as part of the `Result` type.

In gitignore there is an instruction:

```
# Api key
app/src/main/res/values/api_key.xml
```

I believe the readme should tell about it and ask to store api key there rather than in the config.xml file

One way to handle it is https://github.com/antoniolg/Bandhook-Kotlin/pull/16

After pressing back button in the top bar activity is relaunched.
When using system back button the experience is much nicer.
