When opening atom in a directory that is not a git repository, `git-plus` takes substantial time to activate. These are the samples taken when opening atom in an empty directory: 318ms, 388ms, 416ms, 405ms, 418ms, 566ms, 399ms, 395ms, 415ms, 400ms.

In comparison, opening atom with `git-plus` in a git repository takes always under 10ms.

I'm running atom 1.40.1 with git-plus 8.7.1 under Linux.

Steps to reproduce:

1. `mkdir git-plus-empty-test && cd git-plus-empty-test`
2. `atom .`
3.  Open timecop
When viewing a file in a git submodule, you see the "Create repository" panel on the right. If you run "git status" in the submodule directory, git will tell you what has changed etc.

Right now the only way to push to submodules, or diffing,  is by using the command line. 

There is another ticket (#48) in which you stated that support was added but... it doesn't seem to work.

Am I missing something?
First I would like to thank `akonwi` for this very nice plugin, I often use git log to show updates of every single commit, but the git show only show the difference inline, can I make the git show commit difference representation in left right pane with full file content? Thank you

* The following shows current view when using git log

I think it is better to have a split diff for the full file content for clearer view
i have multiple projects on the editor that are managed by (https://github.com/danielbrodin/atom-project-manager,)

after switching from one project to another (using atom-project-manager) and toggling the git diff panel, multiple panels are showed, the more switching between project occurs, the more windows that are open

Steps to reproduce:

1. -- toggle projects using  (using atom-project-manager) 
2. -- toggle git diff panel

I think it would be nice if there were a single command to delete both a local branch as well as any remote tracked branches. My last Git GUI client, [SmartGit](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/), included this as a checkbox option when deleting a local branch.

![delete local and remote branches](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1086964/55254102-a5754a00-521c-11e9-9479-174a7fefaaee.jpg)

I think the following would work, added right after the existing `delete-local-branch` and `delete-remote-branch` in [gitplus.js](https://github.com/akonwi/git-plus/blob/7efa9b0e8b5fab8133e70bea56f2ce383b069f5e/lib/git-plus.js#L154-L157)

```javascript
"git-plus:delete-local-and-remote-branch": () => {
  git.getRepo().then(repo => GitDeleteBranch(repo))
    .then(repo => GitDeleteBranch(repo, { remote: true }));
},
```

I understand that this could potentially be done with a [Custom Command](https://github.com/akonwi/git-plus/tree/7efa9b0e8b5fab8133e70bea56f2ce383b069f5e#experimental-features), but I think that there's enough value there that it would worthwhile to include in the full repo.
Selecting difftool on a specific file inside a submodules directory produces no output.  The file name is  hightlighted to indicate that the current file is different than HEAD.  It works fine in the root directory of the repo (anywhere other than in the submodule directory).

Running ```git difftool --no-prompt``` from inside the submodules directory opens the difftool (meld in this case) as expected.

After updating to 8.1.0 everytime I push now I get this error
```
[...] pull before push
fatal: Couldn't find remote ref origin
fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly
```
I have to resort to using the terminal or turn off the pull before push option.
However, reverting to 8.0.1 works fine.
`apm install git-plus@8.0.1`
Then restart atom.

[QUESTION]
-----------------
Git-Plus 8.1.0, Atom 1.30.0 x64, macOS High Sierra 10.13.6

Pushing from a repo with multiple configured remotes triggers push to all of them (checked only for two).
-----------------
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create Commit
2. Push from Git-Plus panel
3. No prompt to select remote, push just goes everywhere
-----------------
Previously it proceeded to selecting remote repo which was quite useful. Is new behavior intentional?
