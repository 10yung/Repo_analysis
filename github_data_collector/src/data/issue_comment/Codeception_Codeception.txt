I have such a DOM structure I need to interact with:

```
<div>
    <div class="multiselect__select">
    </div>
    <div class="multiselect__tags">
           <input name="" id="campaign-app-id" type="text" placeholder="Select " >
    </div>
    <div class="multiselect__content-wrapper" style=" display: none;">
           <ul class="multiselect__content">
                <li class="multiselect__element">
                      <span class="multiselect__option">
                             <span class="option__image">
                                      <span class="add-new-app-icon">
                                                <span class="fa icon-plus"></span>
                                       </span>
                           </span> 
                    <span class="option__desc">
                            <span class="option__title">Add New App</span></span>
                    </span> 
                  </li>
           </ul>
    </div>
</div>
```

Explanation, it's third-party library builds this dom for a select dropdown. There is only one unique id I can use  `input#cmpaign-app-id`. `div.multiselect__content-wrapper` it's actual dropdown and it's hidden by default. To make it open (be visible) I need to perform a click to `div.multiselect__select`. 

I did not find a way to do it with CSS selectors so I made 2 XPath selectors and both working on Firefox console.

1. select `div.multiselect__select` as I need to make a click to open the dropdown, selector looks like `//input[@id='campaign-app-id']/parent::div[@class='multiselect__tags']/preceding-sibling::div[@class='multiselect__select']`
2.  select the option from dropdown, selector looks like  `//input[@id='campaign-app-id']/parent::div[@class='multiselect__tags']/following-sibling::div[@class='multiselect__content-wrapper']//span[text() = 'Add New App']`


And how it looks like in Codeception:
```
        $I->waitForElement("#campaign-app-id" , 10);
        $I->click("//input[@id='campaign-app-id']/parent::div[@class='multiselect__tags']/preceding-sibling::div[@class='multiselect__select']");
        $I->click("//input[@id='campaign-app-id']/parent::div[@class='multiselect__tags']/following-sibling::div[@class='multiselect__content-wrapper']//span[text() = 'Add New App']");
```

Error:

```
 Step  Click "//input[@id='campaign-app-id']/parent::div[@class='multiselect__tags']/following-sibling::div[@class='multiselect__content-wrapper']//span[text() = 'Add New App']"
 Fail  CSS or XPath element with '//input[@id='campaign-app-id']/parent::div[@class='multiselect__tags']/following-sibling::div[@class='multiselect__content-wrapper']//span[text() = 'Add New App']' was not found.

Scenario Steps:

 3. $I->click("//input[@id='campaign-app-id']/parent::div[@class='multiselect__tags']/following-sibling::div[@class='multiselect__content-wrapper']//span[text() = 'Add New App']") at tests/_support/Pages/Advertiser/CampaignWizard.php:115
 2. $I->click("//input[@id='campaign-app-id']/parent::div[@class='multiselect__tags']/preceding-sibling::div[@class='multiselect__select']") at tests/_support/Pages/Advertiser/CampaignWizard.php:112
 1. $I->waitForElement("#campaign-app-id",10) at tests/_support/Pages/Advertiser/CampaignWizard.php:111

```

as you can see the first XPath working, but second no (both working on the browser).

Here is also output  [scrennshot](https://i.gyazo.com/4d99fd6a43604a1c0a0b3ca4aebfa558.png) as you can see at the moment it failed, the dropdown is opened already.

Codeception 4.0.2
Related to https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception/pull/4654

#### What are you trying to achieve?

As explained in this [page](http://phptest.club/t/bootstrap-deprecations-in-3-0/2196), trying to gt rid of the deprecated setting, `bootstrap` in the global configuration. I'd like to avoid setting it in each suite configuration.

#### What do you get instead?

The specified bootstrap file is not loaded. 

This doesn't load `_bootstrap.php`.
```yaml
paths:
    tests: tests
    output: tests/_output
    data: tests/_data
    support: tests/_support
    envs: tests/_envs
actor_suffix: Tester
bootstrap: _bootstrap.php
settings:
    colors: true
    memory_limit: 1024M
extensions:
    enabled:
        - Codeception\Extension\RunFailed
```

However, this still works with the warning `DEPRECATION: 'settings: bootstrap: _bootstrap.php' option is deprecated! Replace
 it with: 'bootstrap: _bootstrap.php' (not under settings section). See https://
bit.ly/2YrRzVc`.
```yaml

    tests: tests
    output: tests/_output

```

* Codeception version: 4.0.1 (downloaded with a link saying v4.0.2 but it says 4.0.1)
* PHP Version: 7.3

* Installation type: Phar
* Suite configuration:

```yml
actor: UnitTester
modules:
    enabled:
        - Asserts
        - \Helper\Unit
    step_decorators: ~
error_level: "E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE"
```

#### What are you trying to achieve?
Automate creating a test file using the `generate:{suite/test}` command, synched with IDE when a file is added/modified.

In this scenario, sometimes calculated relative path for the generating test file contains a dot. In that case, an invalid syntax is inserted in the resulting generated test file.

Passing a relative path is useful to keep a synchronized structure with the source directory. For example, passing `"foo/bar"` creates a test file `unit/foo/barTest.php`. This is great.

```bash
$ php codecept.phar generate:test unit "foo/bar"
```

However, when it contains a dot, like

```bash
$ php codecept.phar generate:test unit "./foo"
```

it creates a file `fooTest.php` with an invalid namespace syntax. The dot something passed by IDE. 

#### What do you get instead?

A namespace with a dot gets inserted at the beginning of the generated file, which is invalid syntax and causes a fatal error. So it must be manually removed.

```php
<?php namespace .;

class fooTest extends \Codeception\Test\Unit
{
    /**
     * @var \UnitTester
     */
    protected $tester;
    ...
```

### Details

* Codeception version: 4.0.1 (I downloaded it from the 4.0.2 link but it says 4.0.1)
* PHP Version: 7.3
* Operating System: Windows 10
* Installation type: Phar
* Suite configuration:

```yml

```
#### Acceleration of CodeCoverage

I suggest to adapt Configuration.php function mergeConfigs line 674:

currently:
```
return array_merge_recursive($a2, $a1);
```

to:
```
return array_merge(array_unique(array_merge_recursive($a2, $a1), SORT_REGULAR));
```

#### What is the problem?

I had the problem that lots of calls of `mergeConfigs()` made the internally handled `$this->config` variable explode. 
```php
$a = ['a','b','c'];
$b = ['a','b','c'];

var_export(array_merge_recursive($a,$b));
```

output:
```
array (
  0 => 'a',
  1 => 'b',
  2 => 'c',
  3 => 'a',
  4 => 'b',
  5 => 'c',
)
```

I think this is not intended. In my project `$this->config` of Codeception/Lib/ModuleContainer should contain 5 entries, but it grew up to 100000s of entries by this logic.

### Details

* Codeception version: 4.0.1
* PHP Version: 7.3
* Operating System: Win10
* Installation type: Composer
* List of installed packages (`composer show`)
```
  "require-dev": {
    "codeception/codeception": "^4.0",
    "codeception/module-asserts": "^1.1",
    "codeception/module-phpbrowser": "^1.0"
}
```
* Suite configuration:

```yml
extensions:
    enabled:
        - Codeception\Extension\RunProcess:
          - php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t tests/default_web

```
* Workaround:
```bash
composer require symfony/process --dev
```

Running `codecept init unit` produces the following output:
```
 This will install Codeception for unit testing only

? Where tests will be stored? (tests)
? Enter a default namespace for tests (or skip this step)

Codeception provides additional features for integration tests
Like accessing frameworks, ORM, Database.
? Do you wish to enable them? (y/n)
```

This question looks like it is going to offer to install more modules, but all it does is it creates \Helper\Unit and UnitTester classes and it prints some outdated instructions about enabling modules:

```
To access DI, ORM, Database enable corresponding modules in codeception.yml
Use $this->tester object inside Codeception\Test\Unit to call their methods
For example: $this->tester->seeInDatabase('users', ['name' => 'davert'])
```

It could do a lot more in Codeception 4.0
### What are you trying to achieve? (Expected behavior)
A shortcut match() selector for data attributes.

### What do you get instead? (Actual behavior)
Need to specify the whole css selector

### How could the issue be reproduced? (Steps to reproduce)

Using the example in https://medium.com/swlh/5-tricks-to-elevate-your-automated-regression-tests-762f437c55e6
```
<a href="/footwear/boots/ankle-boots" data-qaid="shop-ankle-boots">Shop ankle boots</a>
```
it could be along the lines of:
```php
$i->click(['data' => 'qaid|shop-ankle-boots'])
```
while today it is:
```php
$i->click(['css' => '[data-qaid="shop-ankle-boots"]']);
```

#### What are you trying to achieve?

I'm trying to upload a file using \Codeception\Module\WebDriver::attachFile while in the context of Docker containers.

#### What do you get instead?

Selenium can't find my file.

```bash
[Facebook\WebDriver\Exception\InvalidArgumentException] invalid argument: File not found : /application/www/dev/tests/tests/_data/800x800.png
  (Session info: headless chrome=75.0.3770.80)
```

> Provide test source code if related

```php
$I->attachFile( '.dz-hidden-input', '800x800.png' );
```

Going into attachFile, I see this:

```php
    public function attachFile($field, $filename)
    {
        $el = $this->findField($field);
        // in order to be compatible on different OS
        $filePath = codecept_data_dir() . $filename;
        if (!file_exists($filePath)) {
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException("File does not exist: $filePath");
        }
        if (!is_readable($filePath)) {
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException("File is not readable: $filePath");
        }
        // in order for remote upload to be enabled
        $el->setFileDetector(new LocalFileDetector());

        // skip file detector for phantomjs
        if ($this->isPhantom()) {
            $el->setFileDetector(new UselessFileDetector());
        }
        $el->sendKeys(realpath($filePath));
    }
```

It does get past `(!file_exists($filePath)`, because when in the context that the PHP interpreter on Codeception runs, the file exists and it can see it. However, when it delegates to the WebDriver the action of attaching the file, on line `$el->sendKeys(realpath($filePath));`, then Selenium ends up not being able to find it because it is a different container.

Due to my Docker Composer configuration, I can't share volumes between Selenium and the PHP container.

Is there a way to get around that, maybe by attaching a file from a remote source or something? I would think this should be a fairly common problem since everyone is moving towards Docker development.

### Details

* Installation type: Composer

#### What are you trying to achieve?

run codecept integration,unit

#### What do you get instead?
Fatal error, undefined variable

### Details

These are successful:

codecept run integration
codecept run unit
codecept run unit,integration

This fails:

codecept run integration,unit

At the end of the integration test  (there is only one), it appears that tearDownAfterClass is run an extra time. I can see output from the first run -- all normal. Then it runs again and fails because an important variable is not set. 

I can fix this problem by wrapping the code in setupBeforeClass and tearDownAfterClass like so:

```
if( isset($variable) && $variable instanceof MyClass) {

}

```

That seems to indicate that the methods are being called an extra time with that variable no longer set. With the wrapping, all the actions in both methods are completed correctly and all tests pass regardless of which order the suites run in.
