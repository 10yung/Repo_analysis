Currently lsix displays labels if I don't want to. Would be nice to add a flag like `--no-labels` to remove them so I'll see images only
Lsix still not working for me on Fedora, even using `xterm -ti vt340` command.

As described in title

This adds preliminary support for terminal multiplexers (tmux, screen).
The wrapped escape code passes through the terminal multiplexer so that the terminal can respond.

Escape codes meant for the terminal have to be piped through muxwrap. Positional escape codes probably should be directed to the multiplexer.

You can test the function in a sixel capable terminal with and without tmux/screen like this (after defining the muxwrap function in the terminal by copy pasting):

```
printf '\033Pq#0;2;0;0;0#1;2;100;100;0#2;2;0;100;0#1~~@@vv@@~~@@~~$#2??}}GG}}??}}??-#1!14@\033\\' | muxwrap
```

The functionality of lsix is unchanged and you have to figure out where to wrap the escape codes.

I needed this for https://github.com/gizak/termui/pull/233 - thought this could help here too.

The escape codes have to be wrapped multiple times for nested tmux/screen sessions.
Supposedly it should detect bg colour, but this is what I get:

Here's [my .Xresources](https://github.com/Tanath/dotfiles/blob/af614705fb5d58600450206d8df4e8b1ecb58772/.Xresources).
After installed xterm and ImageMagick, lsix shows nothing about thumnail images. Anything I can do about this?
Thanks!
While this is likely true, it would be great to see WSL support and maybe someone has figured it out. Thanks

Error: Your terminal does not appear to support sixel graphics.

Please use a sixel capable terminal, such as xterm -ti vt340, or
ask your terminal manufacturer to add sixel support.

If your terminal actually does support sixel, please file a bug
report at http://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/issues

When I use `lsix`, I would expect the images to display after my current line, and for that display to be persistent. That's not what happens. The images show up at the top of my terminal, one line at a time, "over" the text that exists there, and then disappears, leaving the terminal intact (i.e. it does not replace the text, it just displays the images like an overlay above the text).
Is this due to `lsix`, or is it due to my terminal?
I'm using wsltty 1.8.4 on Windows 10.
please package your code as a homebrew cask and provide installation instructions.
