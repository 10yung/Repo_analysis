Can I use this for tvOS?
1. When `focusOnFaces` is set.
2. When `layoutSubviews` is called.

Face detection is already quite expensive on resources, and to double up on that just isn't acceptable, especially with the number of apps out there now using this library.
Would be cool to also zoom to the face so that the head+neck+shoulders is visible. Great for Avatars.
