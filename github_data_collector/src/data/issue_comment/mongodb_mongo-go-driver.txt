I'm unsure if this is enough documentation to cover all of the essentials, but I'm putting it up for review so we can all talk about it and figure out what the holes are.

Hi, I notice that mongo-go-driver cannot support multiple `CERTIFICATE` sections in .pem file, which supported by other mongo drivers like pymongo. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.
