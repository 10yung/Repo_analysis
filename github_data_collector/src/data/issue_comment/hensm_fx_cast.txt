I've been happily using fx_cast 0.0.4, would like to check out the latest changes! Is a 0.0.5 likely to be cut anytime soon?

(I've found it easiest to consume via official add-on + provided bridge binary extracted from the .deb, so release with new assets would be greatly useful to me and possibly others ^_^).

Thanks for the project, very much so :grin:. 

Don't know if this is expected or known, but FYI seems to work nicely with the "new"(ish) disneyplus.com service, all had to do was add to whitelist which I appreciate being as easy as a right-click add ^_^.

Move AirPlay auth code into extension and import options page components.

Storage access temporary. WIP.
Upgraded to 0.0.4 and now youtube videos don't have cast option any more.
Can't do chrome-parity on these, since session request can only be triggered in response to user action. Might be worth investigating triggering this via selenium.

Hi

I am on OSX(fully updated). If I try to cast from firefox there are no chromecasts detected(for me it is a nvidia shield). If I then open chrome and just cast a tab or something to the shield it then appears when trying to cast something in firefox and then it actually works, but it seems like that fx_cast at the moment(or probably the bridge) is not able to detect the chromecast devices
Version: 0.0.4
Bridge Version: 0.0.4
Firefox Version: 69.0 64-bit
OS: Windows 10 Pro x64 (Build 18362.295)

Target: Chromecast Audio
FW: 1.42.168007 (from Google Home app)

Happens when casting from extension icon, right-click menu and website app (tried Spotify and Soundcloud).

I have no clue where logs are stored for either the extension or the bridge.

Whenevery I try to cast, there is no device available. Google Home app reports otherwise.
Using `netstat`, I can see the bridge successfully connected to the CCA - port 8009.
I've installed the bridge via the fx_cast AUR package, and the bridge is located at `/opt/fx_cast/fx_cast_bridge`. Despite this, the addon preferences says "Bridge not found". The addon is 0.0.4 and the fx_bridge package is `0.0.4-1`

Embedded iframe players or scripts on CDN domains won’t inherit the user agent string that the main page has and won’t load the cast API.

`webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders` listener can get document URL, but the current request filter only allows for the listener to be called on URLs matching the whitelist match patterns.

Check performance on expanded filter vs temporary additional listeners, if at all significant.
