Can write a large file transfer example?
When will the official version be released?
I have an IoT application that receives Cloud to Device message from an Azure IoT Hub.  With no C2D messages, the application will throw a series of exceptions:

Exception thrown: 'System.OperationCanceledException' in System.Private.CoreLib.dll
Exception thrown: 'System.OperationCanceledException' in System.Private.CoreLib.dll
Exception thrown: 'System.OperationCanceledException' in System.Private.CoreLib.dll
Exception thrown: 'System.OperationCanceledException' in System.Private.CoreLib.dll
Exception thrown: 'Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client.Exceptions.IotHubCommunicationException' in Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client.dll
Exception thrown: 'Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client.Exceptions.IotHubCommunicationException' in System.Private.CoreLib.dll
Exception thrown: 'DotNetty.Transport.Channels.ClosedChannelException' in System.Private.CoreLib.dll
Exception thrown: 'DotNetty.Transport.Channels.ClosedChannelException' in Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client.dll
Exception thrown: 'DotNetty.Transport.Channels.ClosedChannelException' in System.Private.CoreLib.dll

These errors are not precipitated by a C2D message as there aren't any.  These errors are not caught by any error trapping so there is no stack trace or anything else that would give any better information.  These errors also do not throw an unhandled exception.

It is difficult to know for sure what is the inner most exception.  Since DotNetty seems to be the lowest level, I have stated here.

These exceptions happen without regard to the CPU or device that they are running on.

Azure Device Client v1.21.3
Microsoft.NetCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform 6.2.9

Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance.

I think that comment is unpleasantly true, you will need to create a clone as you're removing items from the collection that you're iterating over...

This is what I'm seeing (it seems as this only occurs upon the second call):

```
System.InvalidOperationException: Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute.
   at System.Collections.Generic.HashSet`1.Enumerator.MoveNext()
   at DotNetty.Common.FastThreadLocal.RemoveAll()
```
Without this, it may lead to an infinite loop.

So i try to call this on the server back to back for example 

senpacket(buf1)
sendpacket(buf2)

when i throw a break-point in debug mode on sendpacket2 it gets sent and I receive it on the client end but without the breakpoint, I never receive the second packet at all. Client only ever reads 1 opcode to handle when there is no break-point...

any ideas on what the issue can be? I'm not sure what kind of code ot paste for reference

When regional settings for decimal point is set to ',' (eg. Polish language based Windows 10), test case for provided testcase fails on :

Looks like problem only with testcase and provided sample data - but i'm not 100% sure... 
this project stopped developing?
