Would be very handy, if I could save the todo-list into a glo-column of `gitkraken-glo`.
Brilliant plugin

I've tried adding support for empty markdown checkboxes `- [ ]`, which are supported in github PR reviews. However, I keep getting conflicts with the regex.

See: https://regexr.com/3dqac for some regex `((\[[ x]].*?(\r\n|\r|\n)){1})\[[ x]](.*)`

It would also requires this to be done first: https://github.com/mrodalgaard/atom-todo-show/issues/206
Any tag with a "-" is not recognized by the system.
First of all: The idea to allow tags to organize TODO's is excellent! I've never seen this anywhere else.

A few ideas to improve tags:

1. Currently, only ASCII characters are allowed in tags, which is a problem for certain languages (e.g. German). The reason is `\w` at https://github.com/mrodalgaard/atom-todo-show/blob/master/lib/todo-model.coffee#L66 which only accepts "word characters". However, this could be solved by making the regex-engine locale-sensitive - at least http://www.php.net/manual/en/regexp.reference.escape.php says so. Do you have an idea how this could be achieved?  
Or what about taking another approach and consider basically *anything* prefixed by `#` as a tag, something like `#[^#\s\.,]+`

2. Is there a specific reason why tags are only allowed at the end of the line? More general: Is there any reference for the "tag" syntax you're using?  
If you would omit the `$` from the regex, tags would be possible anywhere: "TODO: #object #profile do this"

3. Minor: I sometimes add an URL to a TODO for later reference. If the URL contains an html anchor (like e.g. www.example.com/foo.html#bar ), the `bar` part is extracted as a tag.


It would be great to be able to hide certain tags in the table view. Some of the tags on TODOs in my project are not relevant to me, or are only sometimes relevant.
Hi, todo finds and lists keywords even if when are just code strings - e.g. print('REVIEW DETAILS") gets that line listed in todos. Thanks in advance.

OS: Win10 64bit
Atom: 1.23.2 x64

P.S. Thanks for the great plugin
Hello I would love an option to show TODOs in git-modified files. Our project has many TODOs from various contributors, and it would be nice to see my current TODO list as I am working on a task.
The package stopped working, in the logs there is the following error:

When searching in the "Workspace" scope, I can't seem to find a way to ignore an entire project folder. If I add it to the ignored paths, todo-show continues to scan the contents even though I've added the project folder's name.

My repro:
- I have a project folder "processing.py" in the Atom workspace.
- Add "processing.py" to the "Ignore These Paths" field in the Config pane.
- Subfolders of "processing.py" are still scanned when using Workspace scope (e.g. "processing.py/runtime/src/...")

I would expect to be able to ignore the entire project. The use case is including a project in the workspace that's essentially a library I'm contributing to and modifying, but from which I don't want to include all the TODOs written by the original developer, just mine in my own project folders.
I can't seem to modify my `On Table` and `Off Table` columns. Screenshots below show the same column layout no matter what columns I've selected for `On Table` and `Off Table`. I refreshed the todos between taking screenshots, and restarting atom brought me back to the state shown in the first screenshot.

Any other info I could provide to help debug this problem?
