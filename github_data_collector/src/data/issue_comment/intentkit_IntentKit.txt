I noticed the following issues regarding the `INKMailHandler` UI : 
- iPhone X support is not good,
- the Stock mail app name is bad (INKMailShe...),
- and there is no french translation.

Here is a screenshot illustrating the issues.

I will do a PR soon to fix this. ðŸ˜‰ 
Improvements:

- Added new action on map handler to open a location with a name and coordinate. Note that existing actions do not allow to open a random location with a title (it either opens a from/to in route mode or makes a text query)
- Added citymapper
- Added search action for waze
- Translated Maps to Spanish

Manually having to add URL schemes after they show up in error logs is subpar. I'd like to find some way to (optionally) automate adding URL schemes to your info.plist file.

I'd like to include everything supported in https://github.com/citymapper/CMMapLauncher
- Citymapper
- Navigon
- The Transit App
- Waze
- Yandex Navigator

Citymapper is the highest priority.

To add an app to IntentKit, you need to add that app's icons.

If you're submitting your own app, it's easy to get your base assets. For people submitting other people's apps, I should include a bit in the README about how I get the assets out of the IPAs.

Currently, the [Travis build](https://travis-ci.org/intentkit/IntentKit) is broken. 

It's failing because it's failing to install TPWeakProxy, a pod that doesn't appear in `Podfile.lock`.

This does not appear to be actually broken. The tests pass locally, and I can successfully set up a fresh iOS project with IntentKit as a cocoapods dependency.

I suspect this may be an issue with Travis config, particularly since this is the first Travis run since CocoaPods 1.0 dropped.

Hi all,

has anybody experienced an issue regarding the primary language of the final bundle?

My app has only the Italian localization, but iTunes Connect states that the uploaded binary has English as primary language.
In the plist of my app I've set:
<key>CFBundleDevelopmentRegion</key>
<string>it_IT</string>

IntentKit seems to be the only 3rd party library I'm using which makes use of localization and I'm worried it could interfere with the final localization.

Any hint?

Many thanks,
DAN

When showing an intent view on a view which has been presented using a "Present Modally" segue (story board), the screen (under the intent view) is black.  When dismissed, the view remains "black"

This works fine with the simulator, but on ios7/iphone 4 it goes black

Adding Phone/Message support via "sendMessage" which takes a phone number and allows user to select to either send a message (SMS) or call the number.

Currently no validation on the number is performed to determine if the number is a mobile number or not
