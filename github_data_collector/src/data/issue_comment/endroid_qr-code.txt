Would you mind adding a PHP version compatibility information to your README?

I just pushed to production to notice that this library crashes on PHP 7.0 (yeah I know, EOL, but it's an external hoster ;-)).

And move stuff like roundblocksize only to relevant writers.
The file `noto_sans.otf` is nearly 16MB, which is rather large for a feature that may not be necessary.

I haven't yet investigated, but I imagine it should be possible to generate QR codes (without labels) without including a 16MB otf file in vendor code.

I'll play around with things on my side and update this issue accordingly.
I tried to generate QR code by entering a sentence but it only displayed a tiny little empty box on my page. 

This is the code:

**<?php

header("Content-Type: image/png");
require "vendor/autoload.php";

use Endroid\QRCode\QrCode;

$qrcode = new QrCode("And thanks for providing your continuous support");

echo $qrcode->writeString();
die();** 

I have tried the code to display the errors on my page as well but nothing's changed and i seem to not know what's wrong. Please help me figure out. 
If you need to use it for printing - it is very important.
Hello,

Would it be possible to add the support of a logo with the writers "Eps" or "Svg"?

I want to make a PDF with "SwissQR Invoice" and the print quality with the PNG is by far not perfect.

With the svg we get a perfect quality, but we can not add a logo.

Is this planned?

```
public function setLogoContent($logoContent) 
{
    $this->logoContent = $logoContent;
    return $this;
}
```

```
if ($qrCode->getLogoContent())
{
    $image = $this->addLogo($image,$qrCode->getLogoContent(),$qrCode->getLogoWidth(),true);
}
```

```
protected function addLogo($sourceImage, $logoPath, $logoWidth = null, $isContent=false)
{
        if ($isContent) {
            $logoImage = @imagecreatefromstring($logoPath);
        } else {
            $logoImage = imagecreatefromstring(file_get_contents($logoPath));
        }
        if ($logoImage === false) {
            return $sourceImage;
        }
}
```

$qrCode->setLogo('http://www.xxx.com/xxx.png') ??? How can I use this?

```

    public function setLogo($logo)
    {
        if (!file_exists($logo)) {    // **How do I change it?**
            throw new DataDoesntExistsException("$logo file does not exist");
        }

        $this->logo = $logo;

        return $this;
    }
```

If you can add more flexible feature to style qt such as this

I am very grateful!â€Œ :grin:
Hi there! Great library! What about moving the Symfony bundle in another package? In addition, I would add more configuration like this:

```yml
endroid_qr_code:
    my_qr1:
        size: 100
        padding: 10
        extension: gif
        error_correction_level: medium
        foreground_color: { r: 0, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0 }
        background_color: { r: 255, g: 255, b: 255, a: 0 }
        label: 'My label'
        label_font_size: 16
    myqr2:
        size: 250
        padding: 10
        error_correction_level: high
    # ...
```
```php
$this->get('endroid_qrcode.myqr2')->createQrCode();
```
