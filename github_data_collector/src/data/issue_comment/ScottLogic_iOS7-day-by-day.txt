Translate the CGContext to be in the correct orientation
Issue #4 

I just started using this guide on how to generate QR codes for my app and it mostly works, but I notice that the -createNonInterpolatedUIImageFromCIImage method posted here actually flips the given image vertically. I verified this by comparing it to UIImage +imageWithCIImage, which gave me an interpolated image that was the right orientation. Adding a line 
scaledImage = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:scaledImage.CGImage scale:1.0 orientation:UIImageOrientationDownMirrored];
into the end of the method flips it back to vertical. 

I have followed this tutorial: https://github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS7-day-by-day/blob/master/15-core-image-filters/15-core-image-filters.md in the section of QR CODE Generation.

After I clicked run, the program open and I can see the welcome image of an app and then it stop there.

on the IDE coding section, it direct me to the main.m and highlight on a line of code which is " return UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, nil, NSStringFromClass([AppDelegate class]));" and says Thread 1:signal SIGABRT

on the LOG section it says this "2014-11-03 11:30:01.172 qrcode[957:24207] **\* Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSUnknownKeyException', reason: '[<ViewController 0x7fc652cb9cc0> setValue:forUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key outputImageView.'"

how can I fix this please help me. t-t

Hi,

pretty good articles! Very short and useful overview, just to the point.

However the linked images in the QR Code article aren't working. The file extensions in the markdown are *.png and the actual files have *.PNG.
