*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Any plans to upgrade to Angular 7? it has been released over 3 months ago
Now tests results are showing only in terminal. 
But browser window is always [empty](http://joxi.ru/vAWl6N9i1lJL5r)

Hi there,

Thank you for the great starter template!
I have been using it to create application and when i'm about to deploy to production server i get "Cannot find module 'zone.js/dist/zone-node'. The steps that i did was:
1. yarn universal
2. copy dist/ and dll/ folder to server
3. Run`node dist/server.js`
The fuill stacktrace is as below
Error: Cannot find module 'zone.js/dist/zone-node'
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:476:15)
    at Function.Module._load (module.js:424:25)
    at Module.require (module.js:504:17)
    at require (internal/module.js:20:19)
    at Object.zone.js/dist/zone-node (/var/.../myapp/dist/server.js:9138:18)
    at __webpack_require__ (/var/.../myapp/dist/server.js:20:30)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/var/.../myapp/dist/server.js:8647:130)
    at Object../src/server.ts (/var/.../myapp/dist/server.js:8711:30)
    at __webpack_require__ (/var/.../myapp/dist/server.js:20:30)
    at /var/.../myapp/dist/server.js:63:18

I can run it on the generated server.js in local but not on server. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks!
Unit Test(s) are broken (fresh clone) since the ngx/store integration, please fix.
