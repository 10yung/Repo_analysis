192.184.93.146 and 54.85.5.167 isn't working
The dnschain server dies upon receiving a DS (Delegation Signer) query. This happens when trying to resolve the .dns TLD which is forwarded to dnschain from pdns-recursor.

I don't know much about DNSSEC or, DNS for that matter, how should this query be handled?

There are probably a variety of Ethereum registries. We should start keeping a list of them here.

The `dev` branch contains an upgraded version of @SGrondin's bottleneck and code that takes advantage of its cluster mode. Test it doesn't break anything and double-check any relationship to #107.

We already specify precise version numbers, but [this isn't enough](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/npm-meltdown-security-concerns).

Truthfully, bundling dependencies is insufficient as well, for the way DNSChain gets installed is via `npm install` and that requires trusting X.509 + NPM.

Still, bundling dependencies is a meaningful improvement we can do.

At some point in the future a way to sign DNSChain releases would be useful. This could be accomplished by distributing DNSChain as a tar+gzip'd file and using a special loader to run it. The signature could be verified via a blockchain.

See discussion in #101.

**EDIT:** Basically, we [need someone to take over native-dns](https://github.com/tjfontaine/node-dns/issues/111) development.

- Add a [third bullet](http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/ssl-and-the-future-of-authenticity/) point to the DNSSEC section
- Update HPKP section to note [its neutering](https://blog.okturtles.com/2015/11/dells-tumble-googles-fumble-and-how-government-sabotage-of-internet-security-works/) (and the hostile pinning attack)

Add a section to the [thread model](https://github.com/okTurtles/dnschain/blob/master/docs/Security-Model.md#thin-client-threat-models) per Jeremy Rand's idea of DNSChain operator colluding with a domain owner on a name-transfer double-spend attack in Proof of Transition.
