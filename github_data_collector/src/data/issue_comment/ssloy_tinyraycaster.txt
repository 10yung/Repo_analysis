Hi!
First of all thank you for great tutorials on 3D graphics.

There is an issue when building project on Windows with GCC. In initial commit in file `tinyraycaster.cpp` in function `drop_ppm_image` you have:
```
std::ofstream ofs(filename);
ofs << "P6\n" << w << " " << h << "\n255\n";
```
On Windows GCC replaces `\n` in output file with platform specific code `0x0D0A`, what is incorrect (it should be `0x0A` in the file). This result in incorrect *.ppm image representation.
This happens because of opening file in "text" mode. To fix this, file should be opened in "binary" mode, for example like this:
```
std::ofstream ofs;
ofs.open(filename, std::ofstream::out | std::ofstream::binary);
ofs << "P6\n" << w << " " << h << "\n255\n";
```
Then everything works correctly. I think this patch would not affect other platforms.
