Fixes some small typos. Hope it's okay that I didn't create issues first. :slightly_smiling_face:

I'm runing SimpleDockerUI on Ubuntu 16.04, and all of my running containers were started in a standard terminal, not with the SDUI app.
My host is Ubuntu 16.04 with Docker version 17.05.0-ce, build 89658be, from the latest release build.
When I select a container and then click the terminal tag I can see the output, but then at the bottom in red it shows: [Disconnected]
Clicking the attach or exec copy/paste icons copies the command, but I can't seem to figure out how to actually paste it into the UI.
Is this a bug or am I misunderstanding something?

The wiki shows using unix:///var/run/docker.sock, but I don't understand the syntax to enter this.
I'm using this remotely, obviously, from a Linux laptop. So how should I connect by a direct IP address?

I'm new to Docker, this may be an obvious answer.
It is not issue.
Simple-docker-UI is bery useful ang great GUI ,but it can not build up Nvidia-docker container fromNvidia docker images.

Could you tell me the the way to build up Nvidia-docker container from Nvidia-docker images?
There is a typo : 
`Contaner` exposed ports
9200/tcp, 9300/tcp

On the image view 
Hi, just to let you know, there's some crash on windows 7:

hope it helps,
thanks!

 I wonder whether this trouble is issue; it will be the specification of your Docker Ui.

I built one image by nvidia-docker, hence I used CUDA-tool kit and CUDA driver.
I used you docke-ui to deploy container of this image.
I select the image and clicked "Deploy container",but  there was no re-action.

I tried other images without nvidi-docker ; ubuntu14.04,docker-hello world ,etc ; "Depoy Container" is worked correctly.

I guessed that  we ca not use  your Docker UI for nvidia-docker image.

Is it right?

I need your opinion.
