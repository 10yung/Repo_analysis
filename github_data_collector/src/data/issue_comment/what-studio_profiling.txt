    clock = time.clock
AttributeError: module 'time' has no attribute 'clock'
```
Seems need change function clock on `time.perf_counter() or time.process_time()`

my code run with only 2 second , and then it used at least 180s by profiling -.- is something wrong with it ?? 
In my use case, there is an algorithm that ends up stalling after running for a long time. I would like to use live-profiling to find the exact cause when the stall happens.  It would be inconvenient to dump and post analyze since the stall happens sporadically, and restarting the run is relatively expensive.

The issue I'm facing with this tool is that the profiling updates stop after a while, even though the main program is running as normal. One work around I found was to run in remote-profile mode, where even if the profiling updates stop, I can restart it again by reconnecting the viewer. However, repeating doing this eventually causes the below exception.

while running : profiler.dump('path/to/file'), 
It says,  AttributeError: 'TracingProfiler' object has no attribute 'dump'

I have to save profiling results.. can someone provide a solution / alternatives?
My personal use case was that I was profiling a service.
The main thread would be reading from Kombu all the time, so the interface was mostly showing operations from the main thread and not from the request threads, which were the ones I was interested in.
https://pypi.org/project/profiling/#files

could you download this and check `profiler.py`?
there's no dump method in there.

for some reason, there's mismatch between github master branch and latest pypi package.
Wheels are very convenient especially when one wants to install with missing compilation requirements.
Hello, is there anyway that I can profile a flask app with profiling?
```
time.clock_gettime(clk_id)
Return the time of the specified clock clk_id.

Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3.
```

time.clock_gettime is only used in Unix,can you have some method to add support to MacOS?
