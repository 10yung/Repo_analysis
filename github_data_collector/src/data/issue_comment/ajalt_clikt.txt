Consider that I want to wrap some text to a fixed number of characters regardless of any other mechanisms to determine the width. Currently, I have to implement my own wrapText method and create an own formatter.

Proposal: Would it be possible to have an optional `wrapText: Int` parameter for `echo` which specifies a different wrapping width? Or maybe just make `wrapText()` available outside of the module?
Fixes #78 
- New `CompletionCandidate.Command` allowing to generate candidates from an arbitrary command/shell expression.
- Updated `CliktCommand.argument()` to support an optional `CompletionCandidate` argument.

Necessary to call any command to generate values for autocomplete. My use case was this CLI using clikt  having a `cli do VALUE` command which values can be autocompleted by calling `cli list`.

Let me know what you think.

Sidenote: may I suggest this convention/tool to help manage the changelog from the commit messages:

Awesome project by the way, thanks!
Hello,

New to Kotlin, I'm building an installer for an app with your tool. I was wondering if it would be possible to retrieve values from a file instead of envvars ? I saw #59 so I could first load my file content as env variables but I would prefer to have access to the file, especially as it's a yaml file with nested values in it.

Any idea on how to implement this use case ?

Global idea is : if values are in the file, use them, and if not prompt for them.

Thanks !


Would be great for CLI .
