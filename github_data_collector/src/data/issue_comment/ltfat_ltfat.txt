It's a mild inconvenience that gabphasederiv does not play nice with dgtreal. 

I'll provide a variant that works for dgtreal whenever I have the time to write it.
If 'gauss' is forwarded as a string, the resulting Gaussian is adapted to the parameters a,M, i.e., the time-frequency ratio will by aM/L. If it is forwarded as cell array, but without specifying the time-frequency ratio, you will obtain a Gaussian with time-frequency ratio equal to 1, independent of a,M.

I guess this is undesired. I can make the necessary one line change to comp_window and push.
Dear ltfat developers,

the twisted convolution has a very compact implementation in tconv.m
that combines col2diag() and FFT.

https://github.com/ltfat/ltfat/blob/5a376ee3c77e94c383d80becfe4bcc5cdf1e9a15/gabor/tconv.m#L75

Would it be possible to have a pointer to where this is coming from?

Thanks and best regards,
Eric Chassande-Mottin
I am using GNU Octave 4.4.1 on a Mac.

I tried to run the ifwt example from the documentation, but it doesn't work.

In the Octave command line, type `help ifwt`. There is a simple example.

>          f = gspi;
>          J = 8;
>          c = fwt(f,'db8',J);
>          fhat = ifwt(c,'db8',J,length(f));
>          % The following should give (almost) zero
>          norm(f-fhat)


Type that into the command line and get this error.
```
error: Unsupported data type..
error: called from
    comp_ifwt at line 74 column 10
    ifwt at line 153 column 6
```

I verified this works on a Windows 10 machine using the same Octave version. Something is broken on the Mac side of things for some reason.

I've also tried getting the `info` object from `fwt` and using that, but I get the same error.
I think one of the last commit broke the wavelet modules... See the trace below.
```
>> fwt2(cameraman,'db8',4)

I followed the Windows install instructions to the letter, but received after successful compilation an error "Gateway function missing" for any of the mexfiles. I checked with verbose output the compilation process and everything seems fine.

I don't know what the issue is but it could be linked to 

Especially I used:
Windows 8.1 64bit
Matlab 64bit R2019a
fftw 3.3.5
tdm64bit gcc 5.1.0-2

Please let me know, if I can provide any more details.

My bet, I didn't download the R2018a precomiled builds. These work. However, if I want to compile myself the source code again same error.
In most cases, converting the filters to the time domain seems unnecessary and slows down the reconstruction process, in particular if many filters are involved.
Handling of nonsymmetric (positive only) freqtoscale seems to be off if some filters pass the Nyquist / 0 frequencies.

Line 68 sometimes leads to 'upidx' being negative which does not make sense. 

The if loop starting at Line 53 sometimes leads to 'pos_hi' being negative, again with adverse effects. 

The definition of 'bins_hi' in line 40 is not clear to me. Maybe it is meant to be
bins_hi   = nyquest2 - flipud(bins_lo);
instead?

Generally, it may be up to discussion how filters wrapping into the negative frequencies should be handled (extend the frequency scale or symmetrize it).

Passing parameters that lead to filters wrapping into the negative currently simply leads to the function returning an empty vector.



i'm now digging `wavelets/wfilt_db.m`.
please see following attached image and linked gist for detail.
after some investigating, i realized this b/c large `N` produces very small `a`.
any thoughts?
