I added the following four R package:
`backbone`, `signnet`, `snahelper` and `networkdata` and some material if available

New URL:

R implementation:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/linkcomm/

Beware, important note about R implementation on dead URL:

> Updated: Nov. 18 2011. The default clustering method in this R package is UPGMA and the result may differ from Python or C++ package, which use the single-linkage clustering method.

> CRAN: linkcomm: Tools for Generating, Visualizing, and Analysing Link Communities in Networks by Alex T. Kalinka (Pavel Tomancak's group). Also check out the application note in Bioinformatics.

Dear @bagrow, would you happen to know if the R implementation still uses UPGMA, as stated in your 2011 note? I'll email the maintainer, Alex T. Kalinka <alex.t.kalinka@gmail.com>, if you do not know.

## Draft roadmap items

- [ ] Think about sections (viz, community detection, models)
  - [Weingart's blog series](https://scottbot.net/tag/networks-demystified/) as a starting point
    1. [Network objects](https://scottbot.net/lets-talk-about-networks/)
    2. [measures, degrees, centrality](https://scottbot.net/networks-demystified-2-degree/)
    3. [Scale-free networks](https://scottbot.net/networks-demystified-3-the-power-law-rant/)
    4. [Co-citation analysis](https://scottbot.net/networks-demystified-4-co-citation-analysis/)
    5. [Community detection](https://scottbot.net/networks-demystified-5-communities-pagerank-and-sampling-caveats/)
    6. [Co-citation analysis (2)](https://scottbot.net/networks-demystified-7-doing-co-citation-analyses/)
  - â€¦ keep
    1. network objects
    2. centrality and other measures
    3. community detection
    4. (add) models
    5. (add) viz, esp. interactive
    6. (add) varia
- [ ] Extensive presentations for `statnet` and `igraph`
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING guide
