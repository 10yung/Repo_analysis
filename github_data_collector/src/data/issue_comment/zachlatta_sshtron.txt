I would like to livestream games in progress.
Right now when `sshtron` is run by `systemd`, the colors don't work. See:

http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/352937/ansi-colors-when-using-systemd-service

From what I can tell, `sshtron` uses a color library, which in turn uses library to check is there's a terminal connected to decide whether to use colors or not, which boils down to this line:

https://github.com/mattn/go-isatty/blob/master/isatty_linux.go#L14

The logic using TTY detection to decide if a *server* should output color seems flawed if that's what' going on. The server might be not connected to a TTY even if the clients are. 

`systemd` *does* have some options to connect a service to a TTY documented in `man systemd.exec`, but usually services aren't connected to TTYs, their clients are.

In any event, providing a working `systemd`  `.service` file would be of interest to people who want to manage `sshtron` as a standard system service. 
The manual should note the needed client settings to get the correct experience (for example, a plain ANSI terminal emulation will not suffice).

``` sh
./sshtron
Listening on port :2022 for SSH and port :3043 for HTTP...
