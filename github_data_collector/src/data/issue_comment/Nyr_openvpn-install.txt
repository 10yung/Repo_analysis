How we can see which user is online? and how many of them? and bandwith usage of each one?
when I use the commandline as stated to download and install I get the following error at the end.

I have now installed https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install package without any issue or additional packages to be added, but your own script wont install.  

I am not sure whats missing since its a new minimal build from yesterday.  I've used your script previously with Debian without any issues.
### **Please do not make unrelated feature requests or ask for support here.**

This issue contains a list of pending improvements to the script. Those haven't been implemented yet to preserve compatibility with older environments but will likely be implemented in the long term:

- ~~Upgrade `cipher` to`AES-256-CBC` when it's confirmed that OpenVPN 2.4 will try to negotiate 256 bit keys by default. We can't use `cipher AES-256-GCM` yet since this would break OpenVPN older than 2.4 or those systems with a library which doesn't support GCM (like OpenSSL older than 1.0.1). Still, `AES-256-GCM` will be negotiated and used if available for both sides.~~ **Done.**
- ~~iptables are currently saved to the `rc.local` file even for systemd distros. When every supported distro is expected to ship with systemd, creating a service file would likely be a better approach to apply them at startup.~~ Went with a different [approach](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install/issues/464), but **Done.**
- ~~Remove code supporting other init systems when every supported distro ships with systemd. This will happen when CentOS 6 reaches EOL (November 30th, 2020).~~ **Done.**
- ~~Enable LZ4 compression when/if it's safe to do so in the future. Compression was disabled with #509 to mitigate the VORACLE attack.~~ No plans to enable compression anytime soon.
- ~~`sndbuf` and `recvbuf`are set to sane values by default since OpenVPN 2.3.9. Those parameters can be removed from the script when everyone is expected to be running OpenVPN 2.3.9+.~~ **Done.**
- ~~`ignore-unknown-option` is supported since OpenVPN 2.3.3. Can be used [instead of](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install/commit/acca10ba1a87b86da3f402ef08e07ad42126913e) `setenv opt` when OpenVPN 2.3.3+ is to be expected.~~ **Done.**
- ~~`explicit-exit-notify 1` in the server: has been implemented with 2.4 and is set in the sample `server.conf`. Option only useful for UDP, should not be included if user selects TCP. Will be implemented when servers are expected to run 2.4+, isn't problematic client-side.~~ **Done.**
- ~~`tls-crypt` is an improvement over `tls-auth`. This change will be implemented when all servers and clients are expected to run OpenVPN 2.4+.~~ **Done.**
- Switch from iptables to nftables when it becomes the default in every supported distribution.

That's all I can think of for now.
