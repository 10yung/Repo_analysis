I looked the code of machinist and find some trivial problems.

1. package don't correspond to  directory structure.
2. there are some deprecated methods.
3. use data structure of AST not quasiquotes.(personally, i think quasiquotes is easy to understand )
4. unit test.

Those problem don't cause problem in using machinist. I don't know if there are on purpose.
