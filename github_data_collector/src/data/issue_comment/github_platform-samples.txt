Hi, in an organisation with many pre-receive hooks running, it would be great if the hook was executed with each stdout line being pre-fixed with the hook that caused the line output.

Like what is shown here: https://superuser.com/a/623119/860394

```bash
command1.sh | sed "s/^/[command1] /"
command2.sh | sed "s/^/[command2] /"
```

For hook maintainers, it is time consuming to constantly address questions about issues related to other hooks created by other teams within an organisation.

Edit:

per-hook solutions are welcome, though a GitHub-wide solution would be ideal.
