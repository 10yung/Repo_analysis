Hi!

I saw that the `reincarnation` branch has the library rewritten in Swift.
For those of us who are still using Objective-C this will mean that we will have to run Swift side by side with our Objective-C code.

By doing so that requires us to embed the Swift runtime which is a significant addition to the size of the application. See this Stack Overflow thread for more information: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28275711/adding-swift-to-project-increase-size-substantiously-how-and-when-can-it-be-avo

My recommendation for you would be to create a new repository where the ICViewPager-Swift or ICViewPager-2.0 would reside.

@iltercengiz Would love to hear your opinions regarding this.

how to prevent the content views from being swiped?
I just want the tabs to be swiped.
Thank you.
Hi,

Is there a way to have a different color for each indicator?
Each tab has a color and I'd like the indicator to match that color.

Thank you

Hello,

I love this project, however when I have a bottom toolbar present the content in viewpager doesn't seem to account for this toolbar and is show behind it.

Hello,

Have anyone met this problem?

I tried to add the viewpager to my application, I get the black background, missing header section, please see the screenshot, here is the code that I initialize the HostViewController (I take this code from the example).
![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/498853/14285080/bcf6570e-fb7c-11e5-8005-d01657a8811d.png)

in AppDelegate.m

```
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
    HostViewController *vc = [[HostViewController alloc]init];    
    [self.window setRootViewController:vc];
    return YES;
}

```

Did I make some mistake here? I don't know why in the example (there is no initlization code like I did, I don't know where it is done) it works fine?

Another question is the 4 Tabs come out very slowly (even in that example), they get displayed after about 4-5 seconds, is that normal, how can I optimize that?

My dev environnement is Xcode 5.1.1 + IOS 10.8.5.

Hi!

I have an app in which I want to preselect a tab before loading the entire viewPager, so the ViewPagerViewController has a "selectedTab" property and I configure it before pushing the ViewController.

Then, I select the tab in viewWillAppear (#29).
It is working fine when executing on an iPhone but it doesn't work on iPad.

Has anyone a fix for it? Or maybe I have forgotten something...

Thank you very much

PD: the only fix I could add for now is checking selected tab in viewDidAppear, but it shows first tab and then it changes to the selected tab (it doesn't work always)

crash (100%) steps:
1. set the ViewPagerControllerâ€™s data source, total count is 10;
2. select the active page as 9;
3. i want to change the data source to another data source, total count maybe
is 5. So i call ViewPagerController reloadData.
4. ViewPagerController crash, out of range exception

Root Cause is self.activeContentIndex is still 9,  NSArray cash when
call [self.contents replaceObjectAtIndex:index withObject:[NSNull null]]
