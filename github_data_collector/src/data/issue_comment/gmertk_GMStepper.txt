Hi, I upgraded my application from Swift 4.2 to Swift 5 and I get an error. How do i fix this?

File: GMStepper.swift

Error: Argument labels '(stringInterpolationSegment:)' do not match any available overloads

Error is in 2 areas.

Area 1:

else if isInteger {
                label.text = String(stringInterpolationSegment: "\(Int(value))\(self.suffixString)"/*Int(value)*/)
            }
            else {
                label.text = String(stringInterpolationSegment: "\(value)\(self.suffixString)"/*value*/)
            }

Area 2:

if self.showIntegerIfDoubleIsInteger && floor(self.value) == self.value {
            label.text = String(stringInterpolationSegment: "\(Int(self.value))\(self.suffixString)")
        } else {
            label.text = String(stringInterpolationSegment: "\(Int(self.value))\(self.suffixString)")
        }


I have to remove the right border of the left button and left a border of the right button.
How I can implement this?
Because I can't see any code of that. You're setting frames directly.

****
how can I have formatted text on the middle label when user clicks on the incrementer?
For an example "Tag 1", "Tag 2" --> 1, 2 will be incremented or decremented in a normal way.
```
func setup() {
    addSubview(leftButton)
    addSubview(rightButton)
    addSubview(label)

    backgroundColor = buttonsBackgroundColor
    layer.cornerRadius = cornerRadius
    clipsToBounds = true

    //Commented this line out
    NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(GMStepper.reset), name: NSNotification.Name.UIApplicationWillResignActive, object: nil)
}
```

Whenever the applicationWillResignActive AppDelegate function was being called, the reset() function would cause a 'found nil while unwrapping an optional value' error. Not sure why the steppers need to be reset when the application resigns, honestly. I commented the observer out and it seems to work fine. If I'm wrong in this, or there's a better way to fix this error, please do inform me. Thanks!
First of all, nice library!
I use it in my (production) app, and i really enjoy it.
However today i noticed a strange behavior. Lets say the step value is setted to 0.1. Lets also say the stepper goes from 3.0 to 7.5. If autorepeat enabled, and user presses on the stepper for long time, the double gets rounded to (for example) 5.1000000000001 . This happens only when the maximum velocity of long pressing is reached.
I was able to solve it using a rounding function,(to 1 decimal place in my case worked great) , inside the value property.
Hope you gonna check this error and fix it!
Happy coding
Hi , 
Just I want to say it will be much better if it was a textfield not a label !

why ?

because user can click on the textfield to change numbers using keyboard 
if the number he's want was bigger 

it will be useless clicking on "+" button until reach it !
I use storyboard to create the stepper but it show me this error message.
Why?

Hey,

It would be great if you would expose and make the ```var timerFireCountModulo: Int``` into a property which we can change. Currently it's a get-only property.

I'd like to remove the "the longer you hold, the faster it'll change the value" functionality and just make it increment based on my custom value (which in this case would be 2. From your comments: // 0.05 sec * 2 = 0.1 sec). That would be the ideal speed for me.

Thanks
