Bug in Core.ProfilePictureUploader, it does not seem to support government tenants.

If I specify full qualified tenant name in the configuration.xml (e.g. mygovtenant.sharepoint.us), it appends `-admin.sharepoint.com` to the url, resulting in the following error:

````
Initializing SPO web service https://mygovtenant.sharepoint.us-admin.sharepoint.com/_vti_bin/userprofileservice.asmx
Error initiating connection to profile web service in SPO Value cannot be null.
Parameter name: cookieHeader
Processing finished for 0 user profiles (or so)
````

If I just specify the root name in the configuration.xml (e.g. mygovtenant), the behaves similarly:
````
Initializing SPO web service https://mygovtenant-admin.sharepoint.com/_vti_bin/userprofileservice.asmx
Error initiating connection to profile web service in SPO Value cannot be null.
Parameter name: cookieHeader
Processing finished for 0 user profiles (or so)
````

Converting classic pages to modern.

#### Observed Behavior
I convert all my classic publishing pages in a library to modern and export them to an external library. It works for some pages, and fails with other pages with the error: 
"Parameter ServerRelativeFileName was used but is not listed as a web part property that can be used."

#### Steps to Reproduce

I use the following script: 
 foreach($page in $pages)
 { 
Write-Host "Modernizing " $page.FieldValues["FileLeafRef"] "..."
   $modernPage = ConvertTo-PnPClientSidePage -Identity $page -PublishingPage -Overwrite -TargetWebUrl https://Tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/Test        

 Write-Host "Done" -ForegroundColor Green 
}

I also have tried to extract the CustomPageLayout and the WebPartMapping XML and use it when converting the page without any success.

UPDATE: 
I noticed that all the pages that did not work had a attached dokument, that points to a location using RELATIVE PATH that makes the conversion go wrong. Is there any automatic way to adjust these?

Hi team,
We are currently doing a manual association of the global "Approval- Sharepoint 2010" workflow to some of our document libraries everytime a new site is created. We are trying to automate this task using Apply-PnPProvisioningTemplate. Kindly advice what is the best way to do so?

One solution I could think of is creating a document library template in the topsite and manually associated the global workflows to the same. Wanted to know which xml element can be used to associate this template to all the future document libraries.

Any help will be much appreciated? I look forward to hear from you.

Regards,
Gren

#### Expected or Desired Behavior
When you invoke `Enable-PnPFeature` for "Site Feed" feature on a new SPO site - you expect:

1. "Site Feed" feature is activated.
1. "Newsfeed.aspx" page appears on a site. 
1. "Newsfeed" webpart is added on this page (content is empty, of course).

#### Observed Behavior
1. "Site Feed" feature is activated (all good there).
1. "Newsfeed.aspx" page appears on a site (all good as well).
1. "Newsfeed" webpart is added, but it's not displayed because of an error:

```
Web Part Error: A Web Part or Web Form Control on this Page cannot be displayed or imported. You don't have Add and Customize Pages permissions required to perform this action. Correlation ID: 7e770c9f-1086-1000-2e9b-accd7cccd5fa.
```

And now you **cannot deactivate "Site Feed" feature MANUALLY**: it throws internal SharePoint error when attempting:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2527647/66563152-d63c2180-eb65-11e9-9fa0-dc97cbaf29f2.png)


#### Steps to Reproduce

Invoke the following script:

```powershell
Import-Module  SharePointPnPPowershellOnline -DisableNameChecking
Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://tenantName.sharepoint.com/sites/site1 -Credential (Get-Credential)
$siteFeedFeatureId = "15a572c6-e545-4d32-897a-bab6f5846e18" # Stable "Site Feed" feature ID

Enable-PnPFeature -Identity $siteFeedFeatureId
```

And then try to access https://tenantName.sharepoint.com/sites/site1/newsfeed.aspx. You will see an error message, specified above.

Tested on 2 different tenants.

We are using the Picture Profile Uploader application, https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP/tree/master/Samples/Core.ProfilePictureUploader. In SharePoint Online you can Allow or Block third party apps when apply "Apps that don't use modern authentication". 

When we have the setting at "block" this application will not run correct. Obviously the authentication is the issue. Is there a way to change in the code to use this type of method?

Hi everyone, 

I don't know if this is the right place to submit this issue but probably someone faced it.

If we create a list as part of a site script, which is applied automatically after site creation (because the site design is set as default for the web template that was used), and we do an operation against that list right after the site got created, like a CAML query, we get the following error:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50162129/63983184-f626f280-ca9b-11e9-8db1-84ddfd174160.png)

If we have a custom SPFX webpart that does a query, same thing will happen.

This error disappears after some time (5 minutes aprox). This issue is random, seems to happen when we create several sites in the same time window and there's no error if we browse the list from the UI.

Ideas?

Thanks

Hi everyone, 

We're facing the followng issue. We have a couple of Azure runbooks to automate the enablement of certain SharePoint features, like site collection app catalog enablement, external sharing enablement and scripting enablement.

For each of them, we have one runbook that receives the site url, connects to the admin center and enables the feature.

The code of all the runbooks is pretty similar, being the only difference just the PnP command they run:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50162129/63974429-3b8af600-ca83-11e9-867b-a49a19ca6b5b.png)

The PnP commands we're using are:
- Set-PnPTenantSite, to enable external sharing or custom scripting
- Add-PnPSiteCollectionAppCatalog, to add app catalog

We're randomnly finding the following issue that only happens if we run those runbooks at the same time. In those cases, the 30% of the time we'll face the following:

- The operations get successfully executed (that means, the app catalog is enabled, custom scripting is enabled, etc)
- But if we put that code inside a try catch, that 30% of the times, they will raise an exception
- The exception message varies, these are the ones I saw for:

Set-PnPTenantSite : Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
At line:41 char:9

Connect-PnPOnline : Token request failed.
At line:31 char:5

Set-PnPTenantSite : No connection, please connect first with Connect-PnPOnline
At line:41 char:9

Add-PnPSiteCollectionAppCatalog : Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

Background info:

- In all cases, regardless of the error, the operations were successful.
- The runbooks were never executed at the same time against the same site
- The runbooks were executed in the same time window by programatically triggering them through http request

Thanks!




Hi all,

we need to get the users current position in SharePoint online site. we are using the below code in SPFx extension

navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => { 
let latitude = position.coords.latitude;
let longitude = position.coords.longitude;
});

we are able to get the latitude and longitude. 
The issue is the browser location prompt is asking more than one time when we allow the browser to access the location, the issue occurs in "Edge" browser. 
Is there any way to restrict the prompt to ask for only one time or directly access the location without the user permission in SharePoint online site.
Expecting the response as soon as possible.

Thanks all
