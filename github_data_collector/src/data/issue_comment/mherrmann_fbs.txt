Hello, 
I'm sorry but I tried with several versions of python and as you say with 3.6.5, but I always get this error message when I do fbs freeze?
can you help me ? Thank you.

Add the ability to list modules to be excluded when freezing with PyInstaller. #90
The macOS Catalina dark mode isn't working as expected with `fbs freeze`. The `fbs run` window seems to work fine. The same behavior is observed with the example project. I tried to add the `NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance` key to the `info.plist`. This seems to help but nothing was displayed on the window. I'm running the Qt 5.14.1.

Hi,

Possibly off topic, but this was the closest "forum" for this, I could find:

I was very happy when I saw there is a standalone QtDesigner on https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download - and I got it and installed it on Windows 10. It starts and runs fine.

However, when I checked Help/About Plugins, I can see "Failed Plugins" mentioning `pyqt5.dll` - see this screenshot:

![QtDesigner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48317456/70719995-4fd1c680-1cf3-11ea-9b5f-df518f8a27b9.png)

The message is "The specified module cannot be found", although the module is present in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Qt Designer\plugins\designer`

I ran the `pyqt5.dll` in Dependencies, and this is what it says:

![pyqt5_dependencies](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48317456/70720113-83145580-1cf3-11ea-9b8c-73d57e7f8e4d.png)

Apparently, `pyqt5.dll` is missing references to `python3.dll`, `python3.5.dll` and `Qt5Core.dll` (even if `Qt5Core.dll` is actually in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Qt Designer`)

Could I solve this problem by copying `python3.dll`, `python3.5.dll` and `Qt5Core.dll`  to some directory (say, the same where `pyqt5.dll` is, `C:\Program Files (x86)\Qt Designer\plugins\designer`) - and if so, where should I get these files from? (apparently, some specific versions are needed, since I copied `python3.dll`, `python3.5.dll` in this folder from a LibreOffice installation, and that did not help).

Alternatively, would it be possible to include these files in the standalone QtDesigner build in the future?

Thank you for your work, and thanks in advance for any suggestions!

For many popular packages the hooks included with pyinstaller are sufficient, but for less prominent (or non-public) packages, custom hooks are required.

This PR allows users to specify additional directories for pyinstaller hooks in their settings files. This looks like:
```
{
...
    "additional_hooks_dir": ["some_hooks", "some_more_hooks"]
...
}
```
and causes pyinstaller to look for hooks in all listed directories in addition to `fbs/freeze/hooks`. 

Thank you for making `fbs`! Please let me know if this is the right approach to take. If so, I will go ahead and add a test.
I think there is a bug with the get_resource() method. Indeed it is written in the tutorial that this method should return the path ```src/main/resources```. However, on one project this method returns ```src/main/resources/base``` and on another one, it returns ```src\main\icons```.

I am running Windows 10 Home version 1903 and I am using python 3.6.7.

 * A (minimal!) script that reproduces the problem you are experiencing.
Not sure how to make a minimal script that produces the issue, this is just when happens when I run "fbs installer" with the above specs.
`test_freeze_installer` fails on openSUSE because it doesnt support openSUSE.

https://github.com/junaruga/rpm-py-installer/pull/207 might be helpful, or at least of interest.

I could try to help this, if fixing this is wanted.

Command "fbs freeze" auto generate a pyinstaller command, but seems missing a way to enable --uac-admin option.

Missing DLL's for redist 2010, 2012, and 2015 points the user to download only the 2012 version. 
MSVCR100 refers to 2010.
MSVCR110 is 2012.
MSVCR140 is 2015

Apologies for no PR. I am not a Python programmer.
