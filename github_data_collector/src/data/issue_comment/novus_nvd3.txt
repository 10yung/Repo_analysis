I`m using multiBarChart and set reduceXTicks true. how can I set count of xTicks?
this is my result
[my chart](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ycnFH.png)
and my code is here

```
var chart = nv.models.multiBarChart()
    .duration(350)
    .reduceXTicks(true)
    .rotateLabels(-45)
    .stacked(true)
    .showControls(false)
    .groupSpacing(0.3)

chart.yAxis.tickFormat(d3.format('f'));
d3.select('#chart svg')
    .datum(prepareData())
    .call(chart);
```
It's not comparable with the latest versions of D3 (v4 and v5) which is a big concern.  I'd love to use what you have, as it's really nice, but I get the feeling that maybe this has been abandoned and might be risky for me to invest time into implementing on our projects.

added offset to Y coordinate to display tooltip correctly when page is scrolled
NVD3 version used: 2.0.0

Browser and OS used: Safari Mobile / Chrome Mobile, IOS

Iâ€™ve encountered a slight tooltip bug on mobile devices, primarily IOS (using an iPad Air), where if a tooltip appears for a particular chart, the tooltip never disappears, and as I scroll throughout the page, the tooltip stays in that same fixed position. The tooltip doesn't disappear unless I click on a chart that displays another tooltip. The tooltip only disappears upon page refresh.

A good reference would be the charts at http://nvd3.org, where the same issue occurs on mobile devices. 

[The NVD3 Live demo](http://nvd3.org/livecode/index.html#codemirrorNav)  is pretty and clean...   But it is not evident, not didactic about details.

Ideal, **to be "Plug and Play" for dummy users**,  is to add a link to the simplest complete HTML example, with the snippet code into the OnLoad encapsulation and with explicit use of data,  see typical "dummy bug"  `.datum(data())` [in this discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/q/56791539/287948) or **[this  NVD3 bug](https://stackoverflow.com/q/56793506/287948)**.

what to do, i have 
NVD3 version used: "1.1.15

Browser used: Chrome, Firefox , safari

OS used: windows, linux

Problem -1 :
Expected Behaviour: tooltip should come inside the svg not outside.

Present Behaviour: tooltips generated outside the div i.e. it is not fully visible

![tooltip-issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49984615/58684085-8322b880-8394-11e9-9963-e02920e4bee2.png)


Problem -2:
Expected Behaviour: Width of the graph should be 100%.

Present Behaviour: Width is not fully 100%, it creates a lot of space from both ends.

NVD3 version used: v1.8.6

Browser and OS used: Chrome, Win 7

I recently upgraded our nvd3 from v1.8.2 to v1.8.6 so we'd get [this bugfix](https://github.com/novus/nvd3/pull/1695) for `duration` not working on pieCharts. However it seems that it has had no affect, no matter what I set my donut chart's `duration` to it animates instantly.

While I realize angular-nvd3 is a separate library, these are the plunkers I could find to show the problem:

When I tinker with the angular-nvd3 pieChart example [here](http://krispo.github.io/angular-nvd3/#/pieChart), and a [plunker here](http://plnkr.co/edit/vtKWU0?p=preview), in a similar vein `duration` doesn't appear to affect the speed at which the slices of the pie will animate when you toggle other slices on/off (although in that example, there is an animation to begin with unlike my donut, but the speed of it doesn't change no matter what I set `duration` to).

Is there a known issue in nvd3 where `duration` has no affect on pie charts per chance?
