It's possible I'm just understanding this wrong, but the current definition of [SID](https://docs.rs/winapi/0.3.8/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/winapi/um/winnt/struct.SID.html) hardcodes the length of the sub authority to a 1, but according to the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-sid) it's a variable sized array.

Used for getting error info from D3D and other COM APIs.
Starting from Windows 10, `IPPROTO_TCP` supported option `TCP_FASTOPEN`.

Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/ipproto-tcp-socket-options

Macro is defined in `ws2ipdef.h`

```c++
#define TCP_FASTOPEN             15

When compiling the project with stable-i686-pc-windows-msvc, I got the following error：
~~~
- error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _StopTraceA@12
- error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _CloseTrace@4
~~~
but when I use stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc，I can successfully compile.
This is a rebase of #650, which was unfortunately closed by its author, with addition of `pchannel`, which is also needed for work with RDP.
