Related issue: #415 
This is a rebase of fbfc5f1d5508533454187171024625ec05daa88d onto the current master. The rebase seemed pretty straightforward, only a few things needed to be manually merged, and it was pretty trivial to merge them, but I'm not familiar with the code base, so it might not be entirely correct. Currently, it compiles and runs fine, but doesn't seem to play any ads.
### Subject of the issue
Trying to run pianobar on WSL, Hyper terminal, Ubuntu 16.04. Getting it to run, but just skipping tracks with `/!\ Cannot open audio device.` message without any sound.

### Your environment
* 2019.02.14-dev
* Windows 10, WSL (Ubuntu 16.04)
* ffmpeg version 3.4.4-1~16.04.york0

config:
```
user = 
password = 

#control_proxy = http://98.102.88.158:8080
#control_proxy = http://208.114.192.126:8080

# https://www.us-proxy.org/
control_proxy = http://153.92.5.186:8080

fifo = /home/rolle/.config/pianobar/ctl
#audio_quality = high
#autostart_station = 829594236901097823

# http://proxylist.hidemyass.com/search-1303410#listable
# http://www.gatherproxy.com/proxylist/country/?c=United%20States

#event_command = /home/rolle/.config/pianobar/events.py
```

### Steps to reproduce
1. Install WSL
2. Install all dependencies and pianobar (followed this tutorial: https://gist.github.com/paulbaker3/2886698)
3. Configure pulseaudio for Windows https://token2shell.com/howto/x410/enabling-sound-in-wsl-ubuntu-let-it-sing/ and testing https://community.mycroft.ai/t/experimental-mycroft-on-wsl-with-pulseaudio/5464

### Expected behaviour
Songs should play normally with sound without errors.

### Actual behaviour
Sound works when running `paplay test.wav` on Terminal. It just needs `export PULSE_SERVER=tcp:127.0.0.1` to be run before. However, when running `pianobar`, it looks like this (debug on):

```

Alsa is currently not functional on WSL.
### Subject of the issue
I have a very strange issue where volume changes are extremely delayed (5-10 seconds to take effect).

### Your environment
* 2019.02.14
* 5.0.0-arch1-1-ARCH x86_64
* config file is user/pass/event_command (catching only `songstart`)
* alsa-lib 1.1.8-1

### Steps to reproduce
Start pianobar, adjust sound with `(` or `)`.

### Expected behaviour
Volume should change immediately.

### Actual behaviour
Volume takes several seconds to begin adjusting, and then slowly fades to the correct volume.

### Additional notes
Adjusting volume with `alsamixer` is instantaneous.


pianobar git as of now

When a Quickmix song is playing, and the user switches to the station *this song is from*, a new playlist is fetched and the current song interrupted.

pianobar should still fetch the playlist, but keep playing the current song, as it already is from the intended station.

Thanks!
Love the app.  Been coding a mod to it, but run into a problem when exiting/restarting and Pandora flagging my account with "Multiple Streams".  Pandora is counting the successive calls to login when restarting PB and flags the account thinking it's multiple users.  I have to wait a bit for them to age out the error before working again.
 
Is there a logout routine with Pandora to avoid this?



Upon launching pianobar, I receive the following message:

pi@xxxxxx:~ $pianobar 
Login... Ok.
Get stations... Error: Internal error.
pi@xxxxx:~ $

This error occurs on three different Raspberry Pis, One running Jessie (3B) and two running Stretch (one a 3B and one a 3B+).
Running standard pianobar from apt-get  (20016.06.02)
Was working for over a year.  Started receiving the error message a week ago Sunday.  Started working again this past Saturday (two days ago).  Started receiving this error again today.
Standard config with changes for username and password only.
Web Pandora works fine.

Any ideas what would cause this error message?




### Cannot open audio device
I was able to get pianobar to compile in the [Termux](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Main_Page) app on a Chromebook.  However, when I try to run the app I get console errors that say:
```bash
/!\ Cannot open audio device
```

Pulseaudio is running.  There is a Termux package called `play-audio`.  It will play a sample MP3 file from the Termux command line.

### Your environment
* version of pianobar: 2018.06.22-dev
* your Linux distribution and release version: output of `termux-info` command:
```bash
bash-4.4$ termux-info
Updatable packages:
All packages up to date
System information:
Linux localhost 3.18.0-18024-gc429fbc8b604 #1 SMP PREEMPT Tue Jun 19 04:33:31 PDT 2018 i686 Android
Termux-packages arch:
i686
Android version:
7.1.1
Device manufacturer:
google
Device model:
Acer Chromebook R11 (CB5-132T / C738T)
```

* ffmpeg/libav version and the flags it was compiled with (if you compiled yourself):  ffmpeg -v 4.0.1 installed via `pkg` app in Termux
* your config file: barebones config with user and password

### Steps to reproduce
Getting pianobar to compile in the Termux environment was tricky and I didn't document it, so this is my best guess.  LMK if I missed anything.

#### install packages
Use the `pkg install` command to install:
* clang
* ffmpeg-dev
* json-c-dev
* libcurl-dev
* libgcrypt-dev
* libpulseaudio-dev
* make
* pkg-config
* pulseaudio

#### install libao
There is no `libao` package available so I had to build it from source.
* download the source: `curl -o libao-1.2.0.tar.gz https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/xiph/releases/ao/libao-1.2.0.tar.gz`
* `tar -vxzf libao-1.2.0.tar.gz`
* `cd libao-1.2.0`
* `./configure --prefix=$PREFIX`
* `make`
* `make install`

#### edit Makefile
On line 20 of the Make file, change the else block to return this: `CC:=gcc -std=c99`

#### make pianobar
(I had to use `make` b/c `gmake` isn't listed as a package in Termux)
* `make clean`
* `make`

#### start pulseaudio
`pulseaudio`

#### run pianobar
`pianobar`

### Expected behaviour
It should play audio after getting station and song.

### Actual behaviour
It gives the error message and skips to the next track.
```bash
/!\ Cannot open audio device
```


Is it possible to support playlists? (And maybe create a station from a playlist after it ends?).
Starts just fine, but then freezes at the end of a song.

Now without gdb, when I hit ``^C``, it jumps out of the freeze and goes to the next song.

I skimmed the issues and saw some like it, but I didn't really see a fix that I could do on my side. Though I could have missed it.
When I tried to get it to work with Pandora premium it gives me failed login.  TO make sure my install was correct, I created a second account but free status.  That works just fine.  What are the additional settings needed to wake premium work?
