docker build is not working anymore
I want to install some packages that only work on python 2.
So basically, I want to extend your docker image, so that I can
install new packages into a docker image derived from your image.

How do I do that?
Thanks!!

When Python 2 conda environment is created, it pulls the most recent `IPython` (currently 4.0.0)
The project seems to be in flux right now between IPython/Jupyter and referring to the old way of registering the Python 2 kernel generates an error and prevents the build. Complete error message below.

The line that generates the error is this:
https://github.com/rothnic/anaconda-notebook/blob/c45256491fee3f0995e022b1dc96f4f467b14972/Dockerfile#L40-41

Explicitly installing IPython 3 at least makes the image able to build-- a quick fix.

A better solution is likely to upgrade the whole image to install `jupyter` and its related commands for registering the kernel  instead of `ipython`.

Here's the complete error message:
