Windows update installed the new Realtek audio drivers, and now the visualizer does not work at all. I tried rolling back the drivers to fix it but then I just get no sound.

Is it possible to change how the GTA 5 Police Siren is activated? Rather than activating based on the wanted level of the player, can it instead be activated when police lights are activated. If the player is inside a police car and activates the police lights but is not wanted, no effect plays. For those who wish to role play as police, the wanted level trigger adds no value. If activating the police lights themselves triggers the lighting effects, the immersion would be significantly improved. Potentially adding another layer that so players can alternate between using the wanted level trigger and user input triggers for the siren effect. 
Hey, there so i have a German Keyboard Layout, and there is this <>| Key on my keyboard (see screenshot to see what i mean) right between the left shift and my Y-Key, which your Program referrs to as "Non-US Backslash". And this key won't lit no matter what i do. Not with assigning the key, and not with freestyle.

### Expected Behaviour
"Non-US Backslash" should lit up

### Actual Behaviour
Nothing Happens

Is there anyway to display a text over the keyboard ? like a marquee animation
Added Corsair Strafe MK2 config
This is a quality-of-life feature for profile developers and will not directly affect users.

Adds a new class `AutoJsonNode` which is a subclass of `Node` and dynamically creates a constructor based on the fields it has. This constructor is compiled with LINQ and only created once (therefore only incurring the expensive reflection penalty once).

Adds a new method to both `Node` and `GameState` called `NodeFor<T>` which simplifies the creation and caching of sub-nodes inside nodes/gamesstates for the profile dev.

The various `GetX` methods in the Node (such as `GetBool`) have been made case-insensitive.

The Minecraft profile has been altered to use these automatic nodes as a demonstration.
This pull request proposes the following changes:
-Alt and Alt Gr triggers each other: For already existing layers reset needed to this fix to work.

-Dim the background keys without 'disabling' background effects

### Expected Behaviour
Logitech G Hub should continue working in the background (regardless of whether Aurora is open or not)

### Actual Behaviour
When Aurora is running and G Hub is minimized/unfocused for a while, Macros set in G Hub stop working (because G Hub Services have stopped running). 

The G Hub icon stays visible in the taskbar, and the application opens when it is clicked, but when it opens it is re-initialized (it shows it's startup effect) and aurora stops working on the G Hub devices until Aurora is restarted (just like when Aurora is started before G Hub)

Sadly, neither Aurora nor Logitech G Hub logs contain anything related to this crash (Aurora doesn't recognize that G Hub is not running and G Hub logs remain completely empty)

My best guess would be, that this issue is related to my recent acquisition of a Logitech Powerplay Charging Pad (which also acts as a receiver for wireless mouses using "lightspeed"-wireless, such as the new G502 I use) since neither Aurora nor Logitech G Hub have been updated around the time the issue first appeared. (I was away for the holidays and set up the pad first thing when I got home)
Maybe the DLL used by Aurora is a bit dated and doesn't yet have propper support for this device (it is fairly new and a bit of a niche product after all), which then causes the G Hub application to hang up and crash?

On a side note, this might also be related to the way Aurora addresses Mouspad LEDs, as I have BOTH a Logitech Powerplay Pad AND a Steelseries Qck Prism Cloth CL (the two light-zone desk pad) connected at the same time. The SteelSeries LEDs are controlled by Aurora, the Logitech ones don't respond to any key in Aurora (I don't know if they should since it isn't supported AFAIK)

### Reproduction steps
- Start Logitech G Hub with the Powerplay pad connected (and the mouse connected to the pad)
- Start Aurora
- Wait for a couple of minutes
- Macros will have stopped working and the LEDs on the Logitech devices will get stuck

### Frequency
Every time Aurora is running

### Aurora Version:
v0.7.2 (the latest one available at the time of writing)

### G-Hub Version:
2019.11.29288 (the latest one available at the time of writing)

### Previously an Issue?
No, this issue did not occur at all before connecting the pad for the first time

Expected Behaviour
Aurora should start normally

Actual Behaviour
The left side of the keyboard lights up and Aurora crashes/turns off after about 10 seconds.

Reproduction steps
Just starting it. It is always like this, no matter what I do.

Frequency
Every time

Aurora Version:
0.7.2 and 0.7.1

Previously an Issue?
I had an older version of Aurora working (about 1 year ago) before and I had no issues.

My Software & System
Win10
Logitech G910 and G502
Multiple NZXT and Aurora parts. (which could be the problem I assume)

Because the QcK Prism Cloth XL is a mat that lies under the keyboard and mouse it doesn't make sense to configure it as a left handed nor right handed mat.
