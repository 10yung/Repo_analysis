Is this a suitable library to make a lock-in amplifier with for audio signal processing of microphone input?
For iOS a sampling rate of 44,100 Hz is hardcoded. For newer iOS devices the sampling rate is 48,000 Hz. This causes a crash on setup. Sampling rate is for iOS already determined from the Hardware.
Hi , is there any way to set audio sample rate to 8000hz or 16000hz and i want to get all array as short array.

[audioManager setInputBlock:^(float *newAudio, UInt32 numSamples, UInt32 numChannels)

And whats the float range ? is it returning between [-1,1] ?
I need in short like this:
[audioManager setInputBlock:^(short *newAudio, UInt32 numSamples, UInt32 numChannels)
Hi,

are there any plans to replace deprecated calls of the form AudioSession* for the AVAudioSession alternatives?

Thanks
Sorry if this a stupid question. Just wondering if anyone could shred a light on this... I've imported all Novocaine files to my project and renamed the files that will use Novocaine to .mm Just this error on RingBuffer.h refuses to go away during compiling:

**RingBuffer.h:31:1: Unknown type name 'class'; did you mean 'Class'?
Parse Issue: RingBuffer.h:31:17: Expected ';' after top level declarator**

Is it anything I could be missing, like a compiler setting or a flag option somewhere else? I'm using Xcode 8.33 and iOS deployment target 10. Thanks in advance.
Can this be set to play gapless?  Not a loop, but songs from any NSURL just like a regular CD.
Just wondering if it was possible to somehow turn the array of float values into UTF-8.

I am trying some stuff out that would properly send audio data over a network and play it on another device.

Whenever I try to manipulate the data and receive it on the other end I still end up with floating points.

To put it silly, I kind of need to get it to look like [this](https://ghostbin.com/paste/rf4rh), bytes

Edit:

More specific what I am trying to do is target a machine that wants to play audio through Port Audio.
I notice the demo has it's deployment target set to 5.1, but I would need to use the library in a minimum 8.0 environment, so I've checked with the demo and aside from the 'AudioSessionGetProperty is deprecated' errors etc, I get an 'Assigning retained object to unsafe property; object will be released after assignment' in AudioFileReader.mm line 221 - and this seems to be the line which causes the demo app to crash.  I got around it by setting line 50 to: strong rather than assign - but have not thought about whether this is just a hacky workaround, since when running it again with a 5.1 environment, it doesn't let me do that....

Is there a way to use Novocaine with Bluetooth audio devices, like a Bluetooth headset, or Bluetooth external speaker (Jambox, for example)?

There should be no dynamic allocation in a render callback. (Dynamic allocation is widely considered a no-no in real-time threads, since it can block.)
