Previosuly, when using with Carthage, localizations were not working at all, displaying texts like 'CLOSE_BUTTON' instead. This patch should fix this problem.




Hello, 

I'm unable to compile my test project using the pod install. When I try to do
Import BarcodeScanner, i receive an error "No such module 'BarcodeScanner'

my podfile is as below:

use_frameworks!
platform :ios, '13.0'
pod 'BarcodeScanner'
target 'TestBarcode'

how can I solve this problem?

Thank you
avoiding stacking multiple flash animation views while using `isOneTimeSearch = false`
I just want a barcode type from barcode number which is already the built-in system,
Any way to fetch barcode type from barcode number?
