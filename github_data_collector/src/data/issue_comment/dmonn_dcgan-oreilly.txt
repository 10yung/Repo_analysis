I have this error when I try to run the CelebA Dataset part: "ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity". It is exactly in "...\numpy\core\_methods.py", line 32, in _amin return umr_minimum(a, axis, None, out, keepdims, initial)". 
I'm very new to tensorflow and I somehow run this model but how do I change the output shape 28x28 to a bigger value?
Hiya,

Really appreciate this notebook. I've got a folder of resized images, 64 x 64, that I'm trying to feed through this. Everything seems to go well, final block runs, but then finishes, without output. I suspect maybe this is a function of my original input images somehow?
