I know there was a previously closed issue for OpenVR.... but I would like to get some help on this if possible... willing to compensate with $ if needed. This issue:

Using a mandelbox, the left and right eyes in VR are not getting the correct images. I suspect it is something to do with the projection matrix being incorrect. I've tried correcting it myself with no luck. Setting FOVzoom to a higher value will get parts of the fractal up close to the camera closer to correct (say a fovzoom of 3-5) but nothing I can seem to do gets it correct at all distances. Any ideas? 
Could you please write the readme of this project on english?

Thanks!

Reproduce:
1. Run the TestParticleLight scene.
2. Wait for some extended period of time (2 to 10 minutes depends on machine performance)
3. The mesh particles will gradually disappear; only their tails and lights remain.

Tested on Unity 5.4f1, Windows 10
