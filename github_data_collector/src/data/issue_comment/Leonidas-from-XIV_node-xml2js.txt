Can you please add the sample XML to the `README` in the `XML Builder Usage` section?

Add #raw decorators support for builder
Hi I cannot find any information on the question in the title.

I have a bunch of xml-files that I want transformed in a node/express/ejs environment using the same xslt-file over and over again. 
(The files are all TEI-files containing marked up text)

I thought about using ejs and create a:

`<div class="container">
  <%  files.forEach(function (files) { %>
     <div>
		<%= <-- Enter transformed xml file here %>
	</div>
  <%  }); %>
	</ol>
</div>`
I hope you can clear this up? 
best wishes,

Hi, 

I try to use a #raw key but I get an error 
```
Error: The root node has no parent. Use doc() if you need to get the document object.
at XMLElement.module.exports.XMLNode.up (.../node_modules/xmlbuilder/lib/XMLNode.js:455:15)
```
Here is a code to reproduce
```
const {Builder} = require('xml2js');
const obj = {
  data: {'#raw' : "this is a raw string"}
}
let result = new Builder().buildObject(obj);
```

Do you have any idea how I can use a raw string with xml2js? Apparently everything use txt. 
Do you intend to support xmlbuilder's decorators?
I have a control character in my XML and the builder seems to error on it.

The character is just a value in an attribute, the XML is otherwise valid.

In my case it is this character: `` which is ASCII character 5 "Enquiry".

Should the builder not remove these? All control characters except LF and CR aren't really wanted in text content.
Hey there,

The following code produce `TypeError: obj[charkey].match is not a function`

```javascript
xml2js = require('xml2js');
var parser = new xml2js.Parser();
parser.parseString(Buffer.from('3c4f3eff00002f3e3c5f2f3e3c2f4f3eff3e4f3ead3ce42f3e3ce4c9ff002fe4ad5f0109900aad3c4f3ead', 'hex')).toString()

I need to serialize only part of JSON object to XML. The other attributes are metadata I need for processing.

I thought I could do that by hiding attributes in function, but the function is also serialized to xml using .toString() (I have doubts about usefulness of this behavior)

This is what I'd like to achieve:
```javascript
const builder = new xml2js.Builder({
    rootName: 'Something',
    ignoreAttrs = ['type']
});

const serializedObject = {
    attr1: '1',
    attr2: '2',
    type: 'metadataType',
    
    type2: function(){
        return 'metadataType'
    }
};
```
Expected:
```xml
<Something>
    <attr1>1</attr1>
    <attr2>2</attr2>
</Something>
```

Actual:
```xml
<Something>
    <attr1>1</attr1>
    <attr2>2</attr2>
    <type>metadataType</type>
    <type2>function (){
        return 'metadataType'
    }</type2>
</Something>
```

Alternatively, processor functions for builder would be nice.
I have to manipulate an existing XML-File which contains comments.

How can I do this without loosing the comments in the file?
Hi,

How do you add the namespace when creating the builder?

I have the following code that add the namespace, but doesn't have a good output:

```
        const xmlObj = {
            urlset: {
                $: { xmlns: 'http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9' },
                _: urls
            }
        };
        const builder = new xml2js.Builder();
        return builder.buildObject(xmlObj);
```

It generates this weird thing at the bottom:

With the following code, I don't get the namespace:
```
        const builder = new xml2js.Builder({
            rootName: 'urlset',
            $: { xmlns: 'http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9' }
        });
        return builder.buildObject(urls);
```

Any way to fix this?
