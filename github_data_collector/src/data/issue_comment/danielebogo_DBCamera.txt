On iPhoneX, the layout is a bit broken and tapping on buttons is pretty difficult. Is there a way to fix this or a workaround?
Hello Camera control for Images works perfect. Thank you for that but I could not enable to use code for Video recording.... I have added some function as well but it showing me connection not Active. Can you please put some extra steps to do this? Thanks.
We're using DBCamera library in our product. Since iOS 10.2.1 it's not possible to use pictures taken with camera.

- Open Camera and take a photo
- It's **not possible to click on "USE PHOTO"**, so the image can't be used.
- It's possible to click on "RETAKE" but then **it's not possible to click on X** to leave the view. 
So the user gets stuck, he can't take a picture and he can't leave the view. 
Hi,

I test the sample, but there are some problems, it's vers long at launch (iOS 10.2) with simulator.
It's work well in iOS 8.1 with simulator.

Any idea?

Thanks
When using DBCamera on IOS10 (iphone 6), the pictures (thumbnails) from the camera roll/photo library (click camera > camera roll in the bottom right) appear blurry. 

Wondering if this is a configuration issue or a bug. Any help is appreciated.

Thanks.
leak in the file 'DBCameraLibraryViewController.m'
at the method:
` - (void) collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView itemURL:(NSURL *)URL`
line:
 `NSMutableDictionary *metadata = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithDictionary:[defaultRep metadata]];`

i don't know how to fix it.
Hi,

My iPad has 2000+ photos, when I touch camera roll button it took almost 10 seconds to display content.

"DBLibraryManager.m"  Line-117 change like this will init camera faster

if(blockGetAllAssets){
      [items addObject:[[result defaultRepresentation] url]];
 }

PS:My photo library saved more than 2000+ photos.It init camera take a long time.

The thumbnails at the camera roll are not showing on iPad Air 2.On iPhone everything works fine.Can you help me?

Thanks

Is it possible to make `GPUImage` pod optional? i.e if we never intend on using filters...
