The text "Thread-safe: can only resume a coroutine in one thread simultaneously" in the readme.md might scare people away. Is this meant to mean "does not implement send and/or sync yet" or "it is inherently unsafe to use in multiple threads"?
Can't compile in windows without std::mem import.

stack_protected.rs

``` rust
#[cfg(windows)]
fn page_size() -> usize {
    unsafe {
        let mut info = mem::zeroed(); // this fails
        libc::GetSystemInfo(&mut info);
        info.dwPageSize as usize
    }
}
```

This appears to be redundant, please check if this is correct. Thanks
