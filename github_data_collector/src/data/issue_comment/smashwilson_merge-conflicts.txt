This is a very early attempt to add support to skip the stage part of Merge Conflicts.

All changes connected to MergeState is a second part planned to do a "CompleteConflictResolution" without doing the stage part. I have not managed to get that part working yet.

The change in sideResolver (class MergeConflictsView) is a quick&dirty fix to (as I see it) an existing problem.

So in the end there are quite few changes so far connected to the added "Skip Stage" functionality.
The reason for this change is the plan to use merge-conflicts together with GitHub Desktop.
In some cases you lose the possibility to commit in GitHub Desktop if the change is staged.

Support custom project path for conflict detection And To be compatible
with the case where the path may be git root path.

Give other package author the ablity to programmed detection confilct.

usage:

```js
atom.packages.getActivePackage('merge-conflicts').mainModule.detect(someGitRepoPath)
``` 
I work on files over a mount, and running merge-conflicts takes about 3-4 minutes to load.

Is it possible to ask it to only search a particular folder in the tree rather than everything in the current tree?
Sometimes `git` is drunk and we need to keep both local and upstream changes. It would be nice to have a button for this.
Quite possible I missed something visually while using this tool. If that is the case, just let me know.

1. I had two conflicts in the same file. I clicked on the "use ours" button.
2. The update to the file was made in atom's buffer.
3. I was completely clueless how to move to the next conflict quickly. I did not see a button the footer UI and scrolling wasn't really an option as there were a few thousand lines between the different conflicts.

I ended up needing google to get me to [atom.io/packages/merge-conflicts](https://atom.io/packages/merge-conflicts) so I could figure out the key combo.

Felt like there should have been a UI button on the footer interface.

Hi, 

I've started a discussion over at the minimap project about a highlighter for merge conflicts in the minimap. Could you elaborate on how you do detection for that stuff so maybe someone can work on a plugin? I'm not adept enough in coding to even try that myself.

The "highlighted lines" overlaps, and they occupying all the width of the screen.

Assigning custom properties to a marker when creating/copying it is
deprecated. Please, consider storing the custom properties you need in
some other object in your package, keyed by the marker's id property.

The colored bars stating the code origin from HEAD, master, etc display on top of other panels.  If Atom tree view is open, the bars will temporarily display over that.  If the merge-conflict panel is open, the bars will temporarily display over that.  It looks like this is mostly due to the animation on open, but some still persist.  You can see that its overlaid on minimap and part of the Atom window below

The notification that the file is ready to stage locks the file.  If you press stage down below next to the progress bars, Atom throws an error.  The only successful way to stage is to say "Maybe Later" in the notification then stage it with the below interface

`

1. enter "we are done here" notification
2. press stage
3. When stage does not work, press stage in progress panel below
