Every time I click the reports button it brings me back to the "select model" page on the demo.
The reports are something I need to determine the worthiness of this tool.

Thanks!
No where in the install docs is imagemin-gifsicle mentioned dependancy.
I was building this on archliux so there may be something weird happening becasue the OS is configed differently - but in this case I don't think so because after I did npm install imagemin-gifsicle I didn't get the build errors any more.

When using the app for the first time I'm exposed to

and the 'Load Model' button makes me want to load a couple to get an idea of what can be created.

The question is where can I find sample Threat Models that can be loaded? :)

This issue raises the concern about simplifying the model creating/loading process. I would like to remove the create and load pages and put them all into the main splash page.

Below is the current WIP for the intended new `create a threat model page`, which evades the load and create pages.

In my opinion, it's more smooth & simplified: load/create models all on a single "quickstart" page.

Is there any guidance to wrap authentication around this tool along with SSL/ TLS?

I can create threats, and drag and drop stencils.  The thing I can't figure out is how to connect the stencils with lines.  If a person has to read the documentation to figure that out, it may be that the UI needs some more refinement.

In the attached screen shot I created a simple diagram and added to threats "My Threat 1" and "My Threat 2" but can't seem to figure out how to add them onto the diagram so does that functionality not exist yet?

Would be a nice feature to have a set of pre-built threats vs having users create every threat  themselves.  A good place to start would be the OWASP Top10 list.  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page

Todo:
- [ ] Currently some of the layers are rendered out of order. 
  - [ ] Render each layer on their own canvas
  - [ ] merge canvas layers, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3750580/save-many-canvas-element-as-image/3797989#3797989
- [ ] color is a little different as the jsplumb chart and some css effect is not render normally such as the dotted border: 1px dotted gray , this may the issue of html2canvas

The filerev/usemin is not working properly in renaming the images in the code. A temporary fix has been pushed where it ignores images.
