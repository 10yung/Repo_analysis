### Package version eg. v8, v9: 
v10
### Issue, Question or Enhancement:
I have a question to validate if some lists have the same length based on this package.
But I cannot find a way to do a custom cross-field validation, or does [this page](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-playground/validator#hdr-Cross_Field_Validation) mean that I have to implement some validating function independently?

### Code sample, to showcase or reproduce:

```go
type WeatherForecast struct {
	Days []int
	Weather []string
        Temperature []int
}
```
For example, is there a good way to validate if all the lengths of `Days`, `Weather` and `Temperature` have the same numbers?

Thank you.

### Question:

Is it possible to validate that _only one_ field among a set of fields is set? 


### Code sample, to showcase or reproduce:

```go
type MyType struct {
  Foo int `validate:"???"`
  Bar int `validate:"???"`
}

// OK
MyType{
  Foo: 2
} 

// OK
MyType{
  Bar: 2
} 

// Not ok!
MyType{
  Foo: 2
  Bar: 2
} 
```

Fixes Or Enhances # 562

- [x] Tests exist or have been written that cover this particular change.

Change Details:
- Add support for `hostname_port` validator. Tests added for this validator.
- Fix regex for `hostnameRegexStringRFC1123` so it will reject hostnames like `extra..com`.

@go-playground/admins
**Package Version**: `v10` 
**Enhancement**: 
`hostname:port` is a very commonly used string field used for specifying network endpoints. Validator is needed to perform validation for this string field.

**Example**:
```go
type Host struct {
    Addr string `validate:"hostname_port"`
}
```

Example:
type Test struct{
Name string `validate:"regexp=??"`
}

	Name string
}
//  if Type == 1, Name is required
```

### Issue, Question or Enhancement:
`go get gopkg.in/go-playground/validator.v10` gives following error

```
go get gopkg.in/go-playground/validator.v10: gopkg.in/go-playground/validator.v10@v10.0.1: invalid version: go.mod has non-....v10 module path "github.com/go-playground/validator/v10" at revision v10.0.1

### Issue, Question or Enhancement:
how should I fix the error as in the title.

### Code sample, to showcase or reproduce:

the app container logs below:

```bash
hoge-api  | ../gopkg.in/go-playground/validator.v9/translations/ja/ja.go:13:2: cannot find package "github.com/go-playground/validator/v10" in any of:
hoge-api  | 	/usr/local/go/src/github.com/go-playground/validator/v10 (from $GOROOT)
hoge-api  | 	/go/src/github.com/go-playground/validator/v10 (from $GOPATH)
```

when I attach the container and check the import sentences, it, indeed, imports "github.com/go-playground/validator/v10"
```bash
docker exec -it hoge-api head -n 20 /go/src/gopkg.in/go-playground/validator.v9/translations/ja/ja.go
```

```bash
package ja
