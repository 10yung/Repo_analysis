This replaces some use of g_variant_get_* with generated code based on a IDL description of the types.

The generated code is a lot more efficient than the individual g_variant calls, as well as easier to read due to the use of types and field names instead of magic offsets. On the other hand, this is not necessarily code that needs to be very efficient, and there is a risk in any change like this.

Is this something we want to use, and over time extend to more code?

## Steps to reproduce
Install the Steam flatpak

## Linux distribution and version

Kubuntu 18.04

I'm running Xorg and not Wayland. On Wayland it works, but unfortunately Wayland is not stable for me.

I have this issue running both on an Nvidia card and the integrated Intel one.

## Flatpak version

1.6.0

## Description of the problem

I cannot run any flatpak application. I always get `(Authenticator:2): Gtk-WARNING **: 14:02:31.983: cannot open display: :99.0` or similar. This does not seem to be the same issue as #1821 because running `xhost +` does not help.

## Flatpak version
Flatpak 1.0.9
## Description of the problem
Hello,
I try to build a flatpak application.
Everything works fine till I try to display my helpfile with the default browser.
My app is written in C and based on GTK3.
I've first used this type of code     
 ```
char *cmd = g_strdup_printf("xdg-open %s",helpFilePath); //run the browser
 g_spawn_command_line_sync (cmd, &stdOut, &stdErr, &status, &err);
```
when I run my app with the  "flatpak-builder --run", I receive a dialog box to choose the wanted browser and my file displays.
When I install my app via the following command 
```
flatpak-builder --repo=repo-pwall --force-clean build-dir org.pwall.Pwall.json
flatpak --user remote-add --no-gpg-verify repo-pwall repo-pwall
flatpak --user install repo-pwall org.pwall.Pwall 

```
nothing happens when I try to display the help
I've also tried to use
`gtk_show_uri_on_window (GTK_WINDOW(pWindow), helpFilePath, GDK_CURRENT_TIME, &err); 
`
which is recommended in the help but I receive the following message
`GLib-GIO-CRITICAL **: g_dbus_connection_signal_subscribe: assertion 'G_IS_DBUS_CONNECTION (connection)' failed
`
Thanks for your help

I can not type cjk more than half (50%) of the flatpack app.  Only English is typed on the keyboard.  There are uim made in Japan, fcitx made in China, and nimf which solves Korean input bug.  (When using Korean in ibus uim fcitx, there is a bug that moves the last clip.)

Will stabilization of cjk input in flatpak be possible in the future? I try to report an issue to the app developer, but it's rarely fixed.
Like flatpak uses dconf->keyfile would it be possible to do something similar for gnome-online-accounts thus the gnome online accounts are per app (or extend system/user wide) and located in .var/app?

A better syntax to users who wish to disable self updates for all applications.
`flatpak permission-set flatpak updates $APPID no`
sets this only for one application. I propose
`flatpak permission-set flatpak updates any no`
to disable it by default for everything (even what gets installed after setting above)

## Description of the problem
Installed dbus.service not found till reboot
## Steps to reproduce
```
flatpak --user install org.jami.Jami
flatpak --user run org.jami.Jami
```
Run fails until reboot as above requires a ring dbus service which has been installed in exports but is not launched till reboot.
Does flatpak look in the xdg data sirs for dbus services and these are not updated?
