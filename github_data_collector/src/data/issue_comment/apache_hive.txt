Ugly things are yet to come. Will also do some method signature changes later.

HivePreparedStatement.setString handles backslash escaping incorrectly.
So using setString with strings ending with backslash ("xxxxx\") lead to syntax error.
Parquet-avro 1.8.2 use Avro 1.8 which support avro logical_type, but hive use avro 1.7. So that hive just use primitive types to read avro. In avro 1.8, decimal can be transformed to fix, and date can transformed to int (logical_type= date), hive can read these two type with primitive types fix and int. But timestamp will be transformed to long (logical_type=timestamp-micros).
If user create a table with column timestamp, hive will report error that long can not cast to timestamp. So I create a PR to let hive can read long as timestamp.
