Similar to #60 and #63, wondering if there's a way for `.before` and `.after` to return scope (do nothing) when the argument is nil, similar to `.between_times`.

> `between_times(start_time, nil)` - same as `after(start_time)`
    `between_times(nil, end_time)` - same as `before(end_time)`

Current behavior is to default base and time range scopes to [Time.zone.now](https://github.com/radar/by_star/blob/master/lib/by_star/base.rb#L49), but would prefer that only apply to the time range scopes ðŸ˜… 

**Current behavior**
```ruby
Event.after(nil) #=> returns all events after the current time 
```

**Desired behavior**
```ruby
Event.after(nil) #=> returns all events
```

Are there any reasons why the default scope macro wouldn't take any effect? 

When i add the offset option to the query, I'm getting the right offset:
`Post.by_day('2014-03-05', offset: 9.hours)`

But when I set it on the model level, there is no offset:

```
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
     by_star_field offset: 9.hours
end
```
