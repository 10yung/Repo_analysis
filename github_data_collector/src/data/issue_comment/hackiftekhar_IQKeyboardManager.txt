**Describe the bug**
The Next button of the keyboard's toolbar is ignoring / missing the accessibilityLabel property like toolbarNextBarButtonItemAccessibilityLabel. 

**To Reproduce**
I'm writing XCode UI Tests and I can't reach the "next" button on the keyboard decimal pad's toolbar. I can instead access it correctly on the standard keyboard. Am I missing something?

**Expected behavior**
Just like I set the toolbarNextBarButtonItemAccessibilityLabel, I'd expect to have it working also on the decimal's pad.

**Describe the bug**
Not sure why IQKeyboardManager is not working in one of the screen.
I have a UISearchController (added via code) and UITableView (added in storyboard) when I focus in search bar and try to scroll the table it's not scrolling upto the last cell. Obviously, IQKeyboardManager is not letting it up here, not sure why. I have enabled the IQKeyboardManager already.

**To Reproduce**
Not sure.

**Expected behavior**
It should allow me to scroll within the table view.

**Screenshots**
Here's the constraints applied to the table view.

Im getting Warnings in Xcode 11.2.1 IOS 13, how can i get rid of them?

if let originalKeyWindow = UIApplication.shared.keyWindow,
    (Static.keyWindow == nil || Static.keyWindow != originalKeyWindow) {
    Static.keyWindow = originalKeyWindow
}

Warning I get:
'keyWindow' was deprecated in iOS 13.0: Should not be used for applications that support multiple scenes as it returns a key window across all connected scenes



let statusBarUserInfoKey    = UIApplication.statusBarOrientationUserInfoKey

Warning I get:
'statusBarOrientationUserInfoKey' was deprecated in iOS 13.0: Use viewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator: instead.



let UIApplicationWillChangeStatusBarOrientation = UIApplication.willChangeStatusBarOrientationNotification

Warning I get:
'willChangeStatusBarOrientationNotification' was deprecated in iOS 13.0: Use viewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator: instead.
