I tried to install jupyter, and then I saw this error:
```
ERROR: haxor-news 0.4.3 has requirement prompt-toolkit<1.1.0,>=1.0.0, but you'll have prompt-toolkit 2.0.10 which is incompatible.
```
wouldn't it be better if prompt-toolkit upgraded so I could use jupyter without having to uninstall haxor-news?
Hello there, It would be great for haxor-news to use the standard XDG directories to save data. In this case `~/.haxornewsconfig` could be `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/haxornewsconfig`, usually `~/.config/haxornewsconfig` and `.haxornewshistory` could be `$XDG_DATA_HOME/haxornewshistory`. 

Would this be something you're willing to discuss?


Hi guys, does anyone know the regex param to view comments sorted by the # of comments in descending order? 
# Description
A website currently number 3 on HN crashes the html2text parsing library.  The following url crashes the library: `https://itsfoss.com/mattermost-funding/`

The exact issue is a type error on line 824, with a call to `.sub` where `text` is not a string or bytes-like object.
The full sterror stack-trace is here.  
[error.txt](https://github.com/donnemartin/haxor-news/files/3369040/error.txt)

This is a fresh install from pip3 of haxor-news on osx.  

I have not gotten a chance to properly debug.  I am willing to investigate and potentially PR any fix.  
Hi!
Is it possible to filter posts by a regex, other than hiring posts?
Installed from AUR on arch linux, everything up-to-date as of 2019-03-17
The program doesn't start, but displays this error

```
Fixed return value of _safe_split function.

_safe_split function return value is list type, but If an exception occurs, str type is returned.
At that time, get_completions() -> completing_subcommand_option() -> return [](in https://github.com/donnemartin/haxor-news/blob/master/haxor_news/completer.py 184 line).
This is the same as to return [] in completer.py 172 line.
So, If an exception occurs, [] is returned in _safe_split, the behavior does not change!

Please confirm!


Fixed that arg is displayed even if the subcommand is wrong.

before:
"hoge" is wrong subcommand. but, arg suggestion("10 limit: int (opt) limits the posts displayed") is displayed.
```bash
haxor> hn hoge
               10     limit: int (opt) limits the posts displayed
```

after:
"hoge" is wrong subcommand. so, suggestion is not displayed.
```bash
haxor> hn hoge
```
Please confirm!
Upgrade to prompt_toolkit 2.0.
As far as I could test, it looks like most stuff is working fine.
I still have to check the ``ignore_case`` option.
I was about to leave an issue that the screenshots look nothing like the program! But after some investigation I realized that I had installed `hn` from npm, a completely separate program, and it happened to be before your injected `hn` in the path. I removed it, and of course haxor-news works beautifully.

I don't know if it's possible or a good idea, but it would be nice to check for dumb people like me who forget they installed 3 or 4 HN CLI clients at once.
