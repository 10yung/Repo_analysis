Hey there,
your stuff was a nice knowledge base for me to build windows ami with packer. 
You might also want to include forcing the .NET compiler to run after installation. This is what i use before sysprep the image (in my case EC2 AMI):

```
  ## Force .NET Runtime Optimization service (mscorsvw.exe) to run compiler now (usually required after updates and installations)
  # running it now prevents compiling on each started ec2 instance based on it
  # Run for all archs (32 and 64 bit) and versions
  Get-Item  $([environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("windir","Machine") + "\Microsoft.NET\*\*\ngen.exe") | ForEach-Object {
    Start-Process -NoNewWindow -PassThru -Wait -FilePath $_.FullName -ArgumentList "executeQueuedItems /silent"
  }
```
