For some use-cases, it would be nice to be able to not set a start/end date for a bundle of games. We have a lot of games for sale, and so sell them in packs of 8. However, we were forced to set the end date to some date far in the future, instead of being able to make the bundles permanent.

It would be nice to either not have to set an end date, or at least not not show the "ends in" info on the sale site.

On mobile and on pc with a small aspect ratio, cover image that on right side appears however on pc with wide ratio , it's gone.

I just want a banner on top not cover or screenshots
now I noticed there are 2 buy now button with tight aspect ratio.

banner and cover image are same or now.
In cases where a game is run on the itch.io page, download keys don't allow the user to access the games page. My request is for a similar thing to download keys that instead is like the secret link in draft mode, but you can create multiple, revoke them, etc. All the same as download keys, but links that get you past the restricted page option
In https://itch.io/docs/general/about

Unless I'm reading this wrong, this would instead be 

> Our strong emphasis on empowering creators shows in how itch.io is built:
When you comment on other people's games in a jam, there's a "submitted" badge in the comment next to your name that links to your own submission. However, this badge is only given to the account that submitted the game. If you were a contributor to a game (i.e. an admin on the game page), this badge is not shown. I would've expected each contributor to receive this badge as well. This is important if games are submitted using a company account but people are using their personal accounts to comment on submissions!
Noticed that the number of entries (and possibly ratings too) is always pluralized on the jam pages. There's an edge case where it's singular  i.e. `1 entry` instead of `1 entries` e.g.

When adding a credit card in dark mode, the credit card fields have dark text (Card No., CVC, Exp, and Postal Code).

On card error (card input error, etc), input text goes red like usual (from Stripe I think)

Haven't tried this on other devices, sorry.

I wasn't too sure where I should put this, since it would affect butler, itch and the itch website.

If possible when I push a release using butler I'd like to be able to schedule when it goes live i.e passing an argument of something like `--release "DD-MM-YYYY hh:mm:ss"`

I feel having something like this would help in lining up things like scheduled social media posts etc.

Also quick question about the blog post writing, can you use the optional publish date to schedule blog post releases?

Each of these projects has an https: site.
Those who have already purchased the game can not download version 2.0
There is only the demo version of proposed.
What to do ?
Thank you
