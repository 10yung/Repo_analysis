On iOS 10 we were introduced to `UIViewPropertyAnimator` which comes packed with amazing features to create rich and interactive animations. ViewAnimator relies on the old `UIView` animations API in order to support previous versions of iOS, but we could extend for iOS 10+ using UIViewPropertyAnimator specific functionalities (like reversing animations or changing it's completion percentage manually).

[EarlGrey](https://github.com/google/EarlGrey) is an iOS UI Automation Test framework created by Google. 

One of the main features we could use to create UITests on ViewAnimator is the Synchronization feature for animations and Visibility Checks for determining the visibility of certain UI. This is exactly what we need to create tests.

 I feel this is a better alternative for this particular case than XCUI.
The current example app is a really simple approach on what can be done with ViewAnimator. Even though the library is not complex to integrate and use on your own projects it would be nice to show how to use different animations in different scenarios. 

I'd be replicating the app should on the animations **Complex** header.
