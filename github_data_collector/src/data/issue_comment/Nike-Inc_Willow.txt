Adds the possibility to have filename and line numbers added to the log message.

This implements the Feature Request [Issue #57](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/Willow/issues/57).

- Added parameters and default values for `file`, `function`, `line` and `column` to all `Logger`'s logging methods.
- The source parameters are stored into a `LogSource` struct for easier passing.
- The `LogSource` is passed to the `LogWriter` and `LogModifier`. 
- Provided a `SourceModifier` as an example and as a default modifier for adding the log's source to the message.
- Added tests.
- Adjusted the example project to show the `SourceModifier` in action.
- Updated the readme to reflect the new method interfaces.

It seems that because the OSLogWriter wraps os_log, all log messages are handled as format arguments and thus <private> when not actively debugging an app.  This substantially reduce the value of release build os_log.  It also makes it impossible to separate a developer's own formatted arguments from accompanying static text.

I don't see a way to attach the file name and line number to the logs, which would be useful for errors especially. Is this something you've considered and discarded or just something you haven't needed? I'm going to add it to my project, if it's something you're interested in, I'd be happy to make a PR at add this. This is basically the code:

```swift
// function
    open func error(_ message: @autoclosure @escaping () -> LogMessage, _ file: String = #file, _ line: Int = #line) {
        print("file = \(file)\nline = \(line)")
        logMessage(message, with: LogLevel.error)
    }

// function call (unchanged)
log.error(Message.requestFailed(request: request, response: fakeResponse, error: nil))

// resulting output
file = /Users/.../Desktop/Willow-5.1.0 2/Example/Frameworks/Database/Connection.swift
line = 63
2019-07-31 12:27:57.744 ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ [Database] => SQL Error: ["error_description": "The database file is locked", "framework_name": "Database", "result": "failure", "framework_version": "1.0", "sql": "CREATE TABLE cars(make TEXT NOT NULL, model TEXT NOT NULL)", "error_code": 5]
```

This would be especially helpful when creating a LogWriter to post logs to a server. That way you can determine error locations based on logs.
