During work on #189 saw that `intercept()` function is too hard to read and understand. This is the main reason of this PR. 

## :pencil: Changes
- Moved parts of code from `intercept()` into new functions responsible for request and response. Also cleaned up these code parts.
- Changed transaction time measurement method from manual to invocation of available fields in `Response` class.
- Updated documentation.

After merging #181 I decided to review some of the code, which works with headers and simplify it a little bit both in terms of usage and code quality.
During this work I found out that comparison of headers in `filterHeaders` was case-sensitive, while [the official HTTP standard](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.2) states that header field names are case-insensitive. So, it means that the library had a bug, which I also fixed here.

## :pencil: Changes
- Changed parameter type in `redactHeader()` function to accept `vararg` (note, that nothing changes for existing users).
- Replaced headers comparison with case-insensitive alternative
- Updated Readme and `ChuckerInterceptor` documentation to match changes.

## :warning: Breaking
No

After fixing visibility for internal classes I decided to also try to make all the resources we have (like strings, drawables, values, etc.) private, so users won't see them in autocomplete suggestions.
According to https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library#PrivateResources
all we need to do is to create some public resource (might be even empty), so others are marked as private in final `aar`.
Unfortunately, this approach won't work when the library added as module, like we have in sample app, so wasn't able to check locally.

## :pencil: Changes
Added a single resource marked as public.

## :warning: Breaking
Nothing wrong expected.

## :pencil: How to test
Try to get snapshot from Jitpack as `com.github.ChuckerTeam:Chucker:fix~hide_resources-SNAPSHOT` and try to check autocomplete in the app using this dependency.

## :loudspeaker: Describe the bug

Selecting response body using "select all" IME prompt only selects the line and not entire body, incidentally you are unable to select more than 1 line using the drag handles.

## :bomb: To Reproduce

1. do request
2. open response
3. select a word via double tap then either press "select all" or try to drag the handles
4. you are unable to

### :wrench: Expected behavior

As with Chuck, I expect to be able to select the entire response body

Library is very close to being a good replacement to Chuck but some regressions like this means I can't use it yet :(

Initially I planned to to just do some changes in order to get rid of notifications sound, but after looking through the code found some space for improvements, like flexibility in turning on/off notifications for transactions/errors and some code improvements.
Also, found out that icon for transactions notifications was the last raster drawable in the project and replaced it with vector.

## :pencil: Changes
- Created 2 separate notification channels for transactions and errors.
- Replaced `png` Chucker notification icon with `vector drawable`.
- Minor code cleanup.

## :crystal_ball: Next steps
- [ ] Consider making notifications silent and without vibration, but be sure that they appear on devices with Android Q without problems, like in #144 (I believe it is caused by https://www.androidauthority.com/android-q-hidden-notifications-984317/ )

## :warning: Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
The plugin, which currently used for publishing along with POM generation is officially abandoned, according to https://github.com/dcendents/android-maven-gradle-plugin

## :dart: Describe the solution you'd like
In order to avoid possible problems with compatibility in future Chucker should migrate to some alternative, like https://github.com/sky-uk/gradle-maven-plugin which is suggested by the author of deprecated plugin.

Google encourages developers to try the new ViewPager 2, since it offers quite a lot optimizations.
More info on changes: https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/exploring-the-view-pager-2-86dbce06ff71
The library is in `release candidate` state, so I am sure that no changes should appear there and we can safely update Chucker to use latest components. 
Additionally, this migration allowed to make the code cleaner and more concise.

## :pencil: Changes
Added dependency to corresponding library.
Updated ViewPager adapters in `MainActivity` and `TransactionActivity` to be able to work with ViewPager2 as well as changed layouts to use `ViewPager2`.
