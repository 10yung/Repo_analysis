Go back to other pages and return to the slide viewpager with a blank page，It’s okay to refresh when you start initialization. When you go back to other pages and come back, there will be a blank page, only the pages that were initialized before.
When scrolling a ViewPager or redrawing the dirty rectangle of a ViewPager, sometimes one page disappears. It is caused when the page transformer call the bringToFront function, the children view index will be changed. See the viewpager source code.

```java
protected void onPageScrolled(int position, float offset, int offsetPixels) {
        ...
        dispatchOnPageScrolled(position, offset, offsetPixels);

        if (mPageTransformer != null) {
            final int scrollX = getScrollX();
            final int childCount = getChildCount();
            for (int i = 0; i < childCount; i++) {
                final View child = getChildAt(i);
                final LayoutParams lp = (LayoutParams) child.getLayoutParams();

                if (lp.isDecor) continue;
                final float transformPos = (float) (child.getLeft() - scrollX) / getClientWidth();
                mPageTransformer.transformPage(child, transformPos);
            }
        }

        mCalledSuper = true;
    }

```

When the viewpager is scrolling,  `final View child = getChildAt(i);` will be called, and the index may be changed by calling bringToFront function right now.
`  @Override
    public void setCurrentItem(final int item) {
        setCurrentItem(item, true);
    }

    @Override
    public void setCurrentItem(final int item, final boolean smoothScroll) {
        if (mInfiniteCycleManager != null)
            super.setCurrentItem(mInfiniteCycleManager.setCurrentItem(item), true);
    }`
- No support for DPad left right
- Bizarre behavior of same app on TV vs Mobile (Happening only on TV) + some kind of Lagging:
I/Choreographer: Skipped 60 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.
I/Choreographer: Skipped 120 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.
I/Choreographer: Skipped 188 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.
I/Choreographer: Skipped 180 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.
I/Choreographer: Skipped 178 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.
I/Choreographer: Skipped 166 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.
I/Choreographer: Skipped 123 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.

So on left/right key something is happening and throwing these warnings but no change on the pager view.
when i got more than two items in infinitecycleviewpager it goes crashed the app
Hi, Im trying to replicate into android an iOS layout made with iCarousel:

<img width="250" alt="ios" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12940686/46439468-4aa7dd80-c726-11e8-83c9-5282de89e46a.png">

And I found this library perfect to do that, except I cant figure out how to set the height scale of the item, in this case y would like to have a 90% proportion with the carousel height. 

This is what I've got up to now:

Thanks!

How can we add page indicator, the dot image to bottom of this viewpager ?
On page scroll these dots must indicate the position of the current item
