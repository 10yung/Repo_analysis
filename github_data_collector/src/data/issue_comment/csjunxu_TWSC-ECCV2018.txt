Could you tell me why  I need to input two kinds of images in 'Demo_TWSC_Sigma_RW_CC2016.m'?What do they represent?
 

What is the meaning of 'info(1).boundingboxes'? I try to run the code in matlab 2016a,but there is a question 'Functions cannot be indexed using {} or. Indexes in the code of  `for j = 1:size(info(1).boundingboxes,1).` Thank you!

I have a question that where the 'InoisySRGB' comes from in`[h,w,ch] = size(InoisySRGB);`.Could you help me solve it?
Do we need to set parameters in'Demo_TWSC_Sigma_AWGN'?
Hi, Xu. I'm now working on sparse coding image denoising, however, I find that in your program, Par.lambda1 is always set to 0, which means you actually don't use ADMM to find the sulotion. So the function you define in the papar has the close form solution, and it can be simply solved by a soft-thresholding operation. Therefore, the weights, W1 and W2, do not actually affect the solution, and W2 only benefits the aggregation process. I'm not sure whether my above understanding is correct or not. Thank you.
can you give a quick test instructions?
