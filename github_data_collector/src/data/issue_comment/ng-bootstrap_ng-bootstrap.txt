### Bug description:
ngbTooltip not working for IE 10 and 11 browser. Same code is working for Chrome browser.


### Versions of Angular, ng-bootstrap and Bootstrap:

Angular version - 7
Bootstrap version - 4.0.4

On ng-bootstrap demo get at the "Manual and custom triggers" example of "Dropdown".

https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/dropdown/examples#manual

Try to focus an item of that example only via keyboard navigation. It's not possible.

I propose the following solution: When focus is upon dropdown button, user can navigate through items via up and down arrow keys.

- [ ] migrate to Angular 9 (#3447)
- [ ] migrate to Bootstrap 4.4.1
- [ ] deprecate Tabset (code + add overview)
- [ ] deprecate `(select)` in datepicker (code)
This adds additional condition to restrict focus in/out to instance of
the datepicker by verifyng if focus event target and related targets are
descendants of the datepicker element. This removes false results based
only on the class name checks, which fail when focus is switched between
datepicker instances.

Closes #3494

Hello,

I am using ngbTooltip with config appendTo="body" so when i scroll the table tooltip goes upside so it looks weird behavior. So can we close tooltip instantly on scroll even
Boostrap created his own icons library. At the moment, there are alpha2 version 

https://icons.getbootstrap.com
https://github.com/twbs/icons

I created an Angular Module, for using these icons. May be it will be useful for your project. Please, see  my repo for any suggestions. ( https://github.com/avmaisak/ngx-bootstrap-icons )

Thank you


### Bug description:

Our application requires that the dropdown match the trigger's width.
We are using container="body" because we have dropdowns appearing in modals, these dropdowns have their content clipped unless we use container="body"

We have some CSS in place to match dropdown to width of the trigger (host) element.  However this CSS doesn't function anymore when we use container="body" since the dropdown is removed from the context of the document flow where the trigger is located.

We need a built-in Api option for the Dropdown to specify a behavior something like width="host" to use in conjunction with container="body".  When positioning the dropdown, it would use the host element's width instead of the target element's width in the layout computation.  Actually it would need to use whichever is the wider of the 2 values. (Math.max()).
