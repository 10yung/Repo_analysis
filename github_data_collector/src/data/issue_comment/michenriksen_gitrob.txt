Hi, your tools are awesome, but, I think there are important things missing, the easy one:
- The token keyword is not treated as relevant. so any slack or AWS token would be ignored.
- Entropy: there are no high entropy checks.


## Steps to Reproduce the Problem
Take any user with a repository containing the token keyword, it will not be ignored. The same for high entropy values.

Would you mind to add these two things, please?


Switched to go modules for dependencies.

Closes #187 
## Expected Behavior
gitrob should use go modules to install dependencies.

## Actual Behavior
gitrob does not have go.mod nor go.sum to install dependencies using modules.

## Specifications

  - Gitrob version: 2.0.0-beta
  - Operating system: Arch Linux
  - Go version: 1.13

Appreciate if you provide any assistance (I have the updated version of golang)

well problem i am facing is that when gitrob finishes its scan. it says it found repositories and files and co but when the scan is done and i want to go through the findings nothing is responsive 


Hey Michenriksen,

I have read that it clones the repo somewhere for analyzing but I haven't found the path.

Please confirm where it clone the git repo for analyzing
I want to only scan the selected repo not all the repo of my account, how can I do it
Why not allow users to perform a keyword search against the api then iterate through each of the results
1. How can I run gitrob on a particular Github repository only
2. How to run gitrob against other git platforms (e.g. GitLab)
3. Can I remotely feed a cloned repository to gitrob ??
Answer to 3 might solve the other two if there is one.
Also, this is a suggestion, to add the support for remotely adding repository which is preset in the system storage
