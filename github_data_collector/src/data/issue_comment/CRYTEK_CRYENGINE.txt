â€¦ free no heap memory when exit for m_GlobleHeaapDescription
If you use packaging game trough RMB -> Package build "environmentpresets" folder skipped in final build
1. Any template
2. Package build
3. Run game by GameLauncher.exe - Ok
4. Close game
5. Start it again - "Engine can't be started without .cryproject"
_________________________________________________________________
6. Delete game.log
7. Start game again - Ok
When you use empty project without gamesdk and try register any ui events in you game code - it's never will be work, because initialization order broken.
For fixing it i use custom event in CryAction.cpp

```
m_pEntityAttachmentExNodeRegistry = new CEntityAttachmentExNodeRegistry();
	
// This is special event for new Game.dll, used for init all sub-systems
// Swaped InitGameFramework from legacy Game.dll
gEnv->pSystem->GetISystemEventDispatcher()->OnSystemEvent(ESYSTEM_EVENT_CRYACTION_INIT_GAME, 0, 0);

InitGame(startupParams);
```

it's bug exist in engine since 5.3 (https://github.com/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/91)


The repository has two directories named Detours at the same level in the tree, only differing in case. As follows:

Code/Libs/Detours/CMakeLists.txt
Code/Libs/detours/detours_win_x64.waf_files
Code/Libs/detours/wscript

So, on Windows with filesystem case-sensibility enabled, if the repository is cloned in Win32 with Git for Windows and later accessed by WSL git (in my case Ubuntu), there's an error. All files are stored under 'Detours' and the files in 'detours' are missing.

After opening the exported sdk level, the objects look like this.There is no problem when I open the level with the cryengine editor.

When importing an sbsar file and it contains a Height Blend node during texture computation the node is skipped and the result of the previous node is used.
when I try create new level  i get a massage "!m_recordData || (profileSectionFlags & eProfileSectionFlags_RootElement) || (m_stack.size() > 0)" when i create level

Hello,
I am a newbie student trying to learn programming and 3d engines , and I don't understand coding.
Can anyone just check on this issue? I cannot seem to extract any pak files within.
I am really tired of having this stupid irritating error.
And please , please give priority to CryEngine.
Thanks a lot.
