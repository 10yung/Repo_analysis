### Source/destination types

```csharp
public class Source
{
    public List<int> Field;
}
public class Target
{
    public IReadOnlyDictionary<int, int> Field;

}
```

### Mapping configuration

```csharp
new MapperConfiguration(cfg =>
{
    cfg.CreateMap<Source, Target>();
});
```

### Version: >=8.0.0

### Expected behavior

Exception with a readable message that a mapping can't build between the types and an explanation of the issue

### Actual behavior

System.IndexOutOfRangeException is thrown

### Steps to reproduce

No additional steps
Added documentation for enum-mapping

The tests fail though.
