# Changes

Allow the namespace of most of the test resources to be optional.
They can be provided as a XXXOp argument to the resource, e.g.,
tb.Task("my-task", tb.Namespace("my-namespace"))

Fixes #1824

# Expected Behavior

Fire just one task run

# Actual Behavior

Pipeline run is executing two tasksrun

# Steps to Reproduce the Problem

Create a pipeline and run it.

# Additional Info

PipelineRun (As you can see it only contains master-pipeline-build-llnrj task run).

… organisation when using GitHub Apps

fixes #1886

# Changes

Adds ability to filter secrets for a specific GitHub organisation when using GitHub Apps.

# Release Notes

```
- Fixes #1886
- Filter multiple git secrets when using GitHub Apps
```

# Expected Behavior
When using GitHub Apps we have multiple tokens (and therefore k8s secrets), one for each GitHub Organisation the App is installed into.  When triggering a pipeline we want to mount the correct token that matches the GitHub org with the git owner of the pipeline request.

# Actual Behavior
Multiple secrets are matched when the creds-init container spec is created so we can have the wrong token mounted for that pipeline.

# Steps to Reproduce the Problem
Have multiple git secrets in a namespace with different tokens used for different GitHub Orgs

# Additional Info
PR that shows an approach that is working well for us on it's way, it might be easier to explain a proposed solution using that
# Expected Behavior

When processing the output of a pullrequest resource, if the number is empty, create a new one, and add comments etc to it.

# Additional Info

github.com/jenkins-x/go-scm doesn't seem to have support for creating PRs, to move this forward that would need to be added first.
# Changes

Fixes Issue #1880 by adding the ability to disable certificate validation in the client interacting with the git server performing actions related to the use of the pipeline resource of type pullrequest.

To disable, user specifies sslVerify parameter in their resource with value set to "false".  Value is true by default.
