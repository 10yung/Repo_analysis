Example:

```
class Foo extends Component {

  render() {
    return (<div>
      {this.props.foo.map((bar) => <div>{bar.x}</div>)}
    </div>)
  }
}
```

Current:

```
 const Foo = props => {
   const foo = useRef();
   const x = useRef();
   return <div>
       {foo.current.map(bar => <div>{x.current}</div>)}
     </div>;
 };
```

Expected:

```
const Foo = props => {
  return <div>
      {props.foo.current.map(bar => <div>{bar.x}</div>)}
    </div>;
};
```
Hi I am getting the following error when trying to convert a react PureComponent to stateless.  
```
You must pass a scope and parentPath unless traversing a Program/File. Instead of that you tried to traverse a Identifier node without passing scope and parentPath.
```
Sorry if this is not the right place, but I am confused and cannot find an answer anywhere.
Currently, useEffect is not automatically imported, this PR fixes that
I'm having some difficulties opening the context menu with the glean actions. If I right-click on the editor side, nothing opens. The only way I can use glean is if, sometimes glean actions present themselves in a "lightbulb's" context menu.

I don't know how to best explain this, so here's a screen recording:

I also tried running glean commands from the command palette, but without success.

Any ideas?

Thanks!
I noticed that TypeScript is mentioned in the README.md but not Flow.  I assume that the omission means that Flow isn't supported, but wanted to double check.
I'd like to be able to use the hooks support to upgrade a large number of simple components in my codebase.
Any chance this will be a plugin for WebStorm anytime soon? 
We have some very long path names in our project. Unfortunately these get cut off by this extensionâ€”or is it VS Code? Either way, is there something we can do to fix this, and always show the user the full path?

I'm getting this error when trying to extract to a file (and even just a component within the file):

> [BABEL] unknown: Configuration contains string/RegExp pattern, but no filename was passed to Babel
