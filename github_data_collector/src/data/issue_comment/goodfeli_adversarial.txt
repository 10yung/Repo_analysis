Dear author:
    There is a typo in Equ.(4) in your paper. In the last row, according to the definition of Expectation,  it should be p_data(x) rather than the distribution function P_data(x).
Hello Ian Goodfellow,

Dude, you invented GAN's, right?

What if this is the invention of the century?

What if it is the most important software innovation in human history?

What should I input for the model path

Hello,I attempt to reproduce your adversarial net , but there is something wrong as the tittle mentioned.
I noticed that I should set the "adversarial" directory in my PYTHONPATH environment variable.  
I am puzzled,however ,what does the "adversarial" directory meani? I tried to set  directory of the
project into the PYTHONPATH but failed with the "ImportError: No module named adversarial".
I wish you could Solve my doubts.Thanks a lot.

Hi ,
I wondering if readers could be made aware of approx training time for a few of the models. Since it will mostly depend on hardware and software environment, maybe the hardware and software systems used in the paper "Generative Adversarial Nets" can be posted.

Thanks
