Implements #25 
Fixes #24 
Thank you for your work!

As it seems to be error prone to compile it on different setups, it could be very helpful to have [an official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=termpix&type=image).
I just tried to use Termpix and got this error:

```
error[E0599]: no method named `dimensions` found for type `image::DynamicImage` in the current scope

The distribution package generally chooses the source code of the tag or release.
in [aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/termpix/)
it adopted release 0.11

so, if i install it

two years later, I request you to release a tag package
Hi, I was hoping to use this crate as a library in another project of mine ([paper](https://github.com/oinkiguana/paper-terminal)), but it is not published to crates.io so I am not currently able to publish my own crate.

I also needed to be able to write to my own `Write`r, so I had to make this little change.

Would you be willing to publish this crate? You can reimplement this change however you like if this is not the way you would like to do it.
Hi,

it would be really nice to have termpix working!!!
Best
C
Always show this:
# termpix
termpix: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.18' not found (required by termpix)

# rpm -qa | grep glibc
glibc-common-2.17-222.el7.x86_64
glibc-2.17-222.el7.x86_64
glibc-devel-2.17-222.el7.x86_64
glibc-headers-2.17-222.el7.x86_64

# rpm -qa | grep centos-release
centos-release-7-5.1804.4.el7.centos.x86_64

It would be great if you could publish it as a crate so one can just do `cargo install termpix`.
Hi, I would like to use termpix on Ubuntu.
Trying to install it give the following error:
