*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Hi,

I'm trying to generate a grid of combobox, but got some unexpected issues, especially when I want to generate them with *ngFor.

I don't want to manage all the open values, and I don't want to have an openMatrix to know which combobox is open or not.

Can you please add the feature that the property [(open)] is not mandatory ? And let the combobox manages its own [(open)] value without having to declare and manage them by ourselves ?

Thanks in advance.

In the documentation for Checkbox components there is an example containing the attribute `stacked` in order to show the label and checkbox on distinct lines. This works fine for a regular checkbox, but is not applied for the toggle type one.
Also, even though the label states *Stacked layout* the `stacked` attributes is not actually applied (applying the attribute doesn't make any difference to the way the component is displayed):

```
    <ngl-checkbox-toggle label="Stacked layout" [error]="hasError ? error : null" enabledText="Active" disabledText="Inactive">
      <input ngl type="checkbox" [required]="required" [disabled]="disabled">
    </ngl-checkbox-toggle>
```

The example is taken from this page: http://ng-lightning.github.io/ng-lightning/#/components/checkboxes
