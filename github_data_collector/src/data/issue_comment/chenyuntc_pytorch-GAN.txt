Hello, I would like to ask whether the results are normal when you train with mnist data set?I tried training with this dataset, and it was normal until about a dozen epochs, but then all of a sudden there was a modal collapse, and the generator produced a very strange picture.
the  'xrange' is in 'for epoch in xrange(opt.max_epoch):' is wrong.
