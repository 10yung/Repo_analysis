Please add support for importing [AWS IAM instance profiles](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/iam_instance_profile.html).
Hello!
This PR solves https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer/issues/279.

As you can see in the "transit_gateway" file, there are some transit gateway attachments that were needed to comment out, as the Terraform plugin doesn't support them.

Thanks!
I am having any issue when running the terrarformer command.    I have search the web hoping to find a solution, but nothing has surfaced.  

terraformer import aws --resources=vpc,subnet --regions=us-west-2 --profile=prod

error produced
2020/01/09 19:10:55 unknown flag: --resources

I am running:  
go version go1.13.5 linux/amd64
Terraform v0.12.18
+ provider.aws v2.25.0

I have also tried:
Terraform v0.12.18
+ provider.aws v2.43.0

The install went as expected I did not see any errors.  I think that I must have something wrong in the configuration?   Can anyone provide any guidance/help?


Running `terraformer import google --resources monitoring -z global`, I get

This is with commit d8e13fac and 3.3.0 of the `google` provider.
It would be convenient if the JSON plan files generated by `terraformer plan` were more stable in their output. I did two runs, one with `-z global` and one with `-z us-west1` (this is on GCP), which came up with nearly-identical content (disks and instances were `null` in the former), but it was really hard to tell, since many of the lists and objects were ordered arbitrarily. The ordering isn't stable even across two runs in the same zone.

Obviously there could be some intention to the ordering, but I think that at least with GCP, the places where ordering counts are handled by having key names with indices in them (`foo.0.key`, `foo.1.key`, etc).

The places where I saw it was in `IgnoreKeys` (lists of strings), `Item.access` (lists of objects related to roles), `Item.role_entity` (lists of strings), and service account `scopes` (lists of strings).
(On d8e13fac.) The HCL generated for an HTTP2 health check looks like this:
```
resource "google_compute_health_check" "...name..." {
  check_interval_sec  = "5"
  healthy_threshold   = "2"
  name                = "...name..."
  project             = "...project..."
  timeout_sec         = "5"
  unhealthy_threshold = "2"
}
```
It's missing the `http2_health_check` [section](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_health_check.html#example-usage-health-check-http2-full).
Hi Team,

I have used terraformer to import GCP instance into .tf file. But its only importing provider.tf , terraform.tfstate files. Kindly help me with this.

I have used below command:
terraformer import google --resources=instances --projects=useful-matter-230809

If I import GCS it's working perfectly fine as I am excepted.
terraformer import google --resources=instances --projects=useful-matter-230809


terraformer plan datadog --resources=monitor --filter=tag=xxxxxx pulls in all monitors. So does terraformer plan datadog --resources=monitor --filter=tag=xxxxxx;title=blah as does terraformer plan datadog --resources=monitor --filter=tag=xxxxxx:title=blah and terraformer plan datadog --resources=monitor --filter=tag=xxxxxx:'title:blah'

Hi I tried to pull .tf file from google GCP based on tutorial says. I write init.tf and copy google plugin to 

```
ls ~/.terraform.d/plugins/darwin_amd64/
lock.json                           terraform-provider-google_v3.2.0_x5
```

The command works but not works as my expected. I tried to pull instance .tf file. But the file that terraformer pulled is too simple and those files cannot show the details of my running instance.
