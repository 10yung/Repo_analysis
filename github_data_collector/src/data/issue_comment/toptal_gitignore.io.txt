## Issue

### Development Environment:

- [x] Web Browser (Name/Version): Safari 13.0.3 (15608.3.10.1.4) on macOS 10.15.1 (19B88)

### Expected Behavior:

Pressing Return is equivalent to clicking the Create button.

### Actual Behavior:

An error appears below the text field: “Please enter 1 or more characters.” I have to click the Create button with the mouse to get it to work.

### Reproduction Steps:

1. Go to the site.
1. Enter a completion or several. In my case, I wanted Swift, Xcode, and macOS, so my exact keystrokes were `s` `w` `return` `x` `c` `return` `m` `a` `return`.
1. Press Return a final time to invoke the main action button, “Create."

maybe Dockerfile need to update?
My idea is about enhancement of the gitignore.io website: highlighting environment-specific items in the search box.

It is widely known that it is bad habit to add OS-specific / editor-specific / IDE-specific gitignore list into each project's `.gitignore`.  Instead, one should add them into global `.gitignore` in their local machine.  This is already pointed out in some issues, e.g. #4 , #38 .  And in documentation it is already (implicitly) recommended to add Operating System and IDE settings to global `.gitignore`.
However, since I have used the web interface only for a long time and didn't know it was not preferable; I just obediently followed to the message "Search *Operating Systems, IDEs*, or programming languages" and copy & pasted all the stuff into `.gitignore` in my each project.
So my opinion is that it would be helpful (especially for beginners!) if the web interface highlighted Windows, Vim or Eclipse with yellow background when they were entered into the search box, and show humble warning message below.  Is it difficult to do that?
I'm sorry if this sort of issue was already posted.
I got questions when Iuser gi, please help!

It was on mac iterm zsh.

how to fix it. I have already install by command
`$ echo "function gi() { curl -L -s https://www.gitignore.io/api/\$@ ;}" >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
`

I have tried 
`brew update & brew upgrade`
but not work.
In the web interface, I entered python in the textbox, unable to create, what caused this?
It would be great if UI will apply a suggesstion when comma pressed as like it works now with enter key.

For example, typing "jav,gr,int,win," will select Java, Gradle, IntelliJ and Windows.

I know one can use enter key for that, this just a small additional convenience for users :)
