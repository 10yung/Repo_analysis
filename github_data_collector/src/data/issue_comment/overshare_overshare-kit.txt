I have implemented every delegate method in the OSKPresentationLocalization. It seems like the 
- (NSString *)osk_localizedText_FacebookAudience_Public;
- (NSString *)osk_localizedText_FacebookAudience_Friends;
- (NSString *)osk_localizedText_FacebookAudience_OnlyMe;

when implemented, they translate the strings that are in the following tableview

however as you can see, when a selection is made, the string over the keyboard is not properly translated:

Thanks for your time. Will consider forking and making a pull request to fix this issue if a fix isn't already in the works

I just wish to use the standard sharing process and shouldn't need a developer account set up for my app surely? 

Is this supported? Any plans to support it?

Is it possible to add Wechat and Weibo SDK ?
And some SDKs support SSO login, could it be a additional function as overshare-kit? 

Hi,

How can I setup my Facebook APP key for getting displayed in the sharing modal?

Thanks.

I'm working with Branch.io (super easy way to pass deep link data through share links through app download and open), and we'd like to make this integration available in OvershareKit.

Changes email subject line in contentFromMicroblogPost from "Clipper Ships Sail On the Ocean" to "Link from %@", appName

Could you provide an example to integrate with existing FacebookSDK session.

UIKit.h is required for compilation in XCode6 / iOS8 SDK

- (void)startAuthenticationTimeoutTimer {
  NSTimer _timer = [[NSTimer alloc] initWithFireDate:[NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:60_2]
                                            interval:0
                                              target:self
                                            selector:@selector(authenticationTimedOut:)
                                            userInfo:nil
                                             repeats:NO];
  [[NSRunLoop mainRunLoop] addTimer:timer forMode:NSRunLoopCommonModes];

}

i think the "time" must be the "_authenticationTimeoutTimer"
