Hello everybody

How do i open a selector like general as i select the element. 

I am new to javascript, but i tried something out like this.

        editor.on('component:selected', function(component) {
  if(component.attributes.tagName == 'div') {
    const styleManager = editor.StyleManager;
    styleManager.getSector('General',{
 
      open: true,
   
    });
  }
});

what iam doing wrong?

Thx for help
Hi, quick question.

I have an image and I just want to add a link on it.
Using the model, what is the easiest way to add a link on the image?

I tried to use `model.replaceWith` but the problem is that if I put some styling on the image and then call `model.replaceWith`, the styles are removed.

Is there a better way to achieve this?

Thanks!


This bug is also on the online demo : https://grapesjs.com/demo.html

1. Add a Text Block to the page, start typing and hiting enter to make several break lines.
2. Unselect the block.
3. Double click on the block to start editing again.

Now if you click on the "view code" button, you will see that the HTML nodes inside the Text Block have some `draggable="true` attributes.
This always occure at step three. The first time you edit the text and add break lines, everything is fine, as long as you do not want to edit the block again later.

The problem is, in the final HTML displayed on a website, these attributes are still there. You can not select anything because the navigator interpreting the draggable attributes.
And yes I am saving in database both of the `html` and `components` separately

It seems like a bug to me, or I misunderstood something else

Hi

I am using grapesjs in a project that uses proportional scaling everywhere. based on your advice, I can now default the font size selectors to 'em' and make 'em' the only option. 

editor.on('load', function () {
        const styleManager = editor.StyleManager;
        //force font-size to EM
        const fontSize = styleManager.getProperty('typography', 'font-size');
        fontSize.set('units', ["em"]);
        fontSize.set('unit', "em");
        fontSize.set('step', 0.1);
        fontSize.set('min', 0.1);
        fontSize.set('max', 10);
.
.
.
}

everything is fine but when I set the units to EM, the value of the selector is staying as the default in piixels (in this case 9.7) so the selector shows 9.7em whilst the gadgets are appearing in the editor with the font sizes I define as part of creating my gadgets.

Is there a way to sync these up so that the font-size shows the correct value?

I have tried 

fontSize.set('value', 1);

but this is overridden.

thanks

I'm using GrapesJs with Angular and am extending the functionality using Angular components. So my template looks like this:

```
<rs-wc-custom-component lock_editing_in_pages custom-component-id="custom_component-KG3g7xE6Yf2SzTRTPA8ESjULVAlwmCsi" id="ij1i">
</rs-wc-custom-component>
<rs-wc-menu lock_editing_in_pages id="i1un">
</rs-wc-menu>
<div class="container">
  <div lock_editing_in_pages id="icom">
    <p>Insert your text here
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

This all works fine; I've added DomComponents to the designer, and the components show up in the layer designer and I can even change traits with no problem. Everything renders as it should.

However; while I can select my Text component and see a badge, I cannot select **rs-wc-custom-component** or **rs-wc-menu**. When I click on the items, there's no blue rectangle and no badge is shown; the only way I can select/change them is through the Layer panel on the left.

What do I need to do to make these selectable?
Bug [#2478](https://github.com/artf/grapesjs/issues/2478) after release still exists.

Repeat steps and you will get error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'indexEl' of undefined.
It can be to reproduce in your demo
When I drag a component - say a Map - onto the canvas, it now creates three copies of that element in the DOM. However, the model is correct, and if I refresh the screen, it renders correctly.

Without trying to erect an entire sandbox to reproduce, any quick thoughts on what might be causing this?

Thanks,
Andrew
Not sure why,

But all of a sudden, when I start dragging components onto a canvas, I get this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37671394/71865841-2fb6dc80-30d2-11ea-8fa2-d43af2863f70.png)

This seems to happen when I edit a template, save it, and reload it. It also seems to happen when I try to drag a new component to the LAST element of the page; if I try to drag and element inside of a DIV container inside the template, it's fine. But if I try to drag it at the beginning of the template, I get the duplicate items I referenced in #2494 . I have a feeling this is related; somewhere there's a null array that's not supposed to be null. 

WIthout trying to erect an entire sandbox to repro outside of my application, any quick thoughts on what might be causing this?

Any ideas on things I could do to track down the problem?
Hi @artf, i hope you are doing good.

I'm seeing some issues around the color picker, if one is open and afterwards a click is made on the canvas, the color picker will not close even if the option clickoutFiresChange of the plugin is set to true, this is because the event propagation is taken by the iframe of the canvas and is not passed through.

The only workaround that i have found is by adding a secondary event that can catch the click on the canvas, at the moment i'm using 

> component:selected

 but i'm thinking for a better solution. Here is my proposal:

```
  getColorEl() {
    if (!this.colorEl) {
      const self = this;
      const ppfx = this.ppfx;
      var model = this.model;
      var em = this.em;

      var colorEl = $(`<div class="${this.ppfx}field-color-picker"></div>`);
      var cpStyle = colorEl.get(0).style;
      var elToAppend = this.em && this.em.config ? this.em.config.el : '';
      var colorPickerConfig =
        (this.em && this.em.getConfig && this.em.getConfig('colorPicker')) ||
        {};
      const getColor = color => {
        let cl =
          color.getAlpha() == 1 ? color.toHexString() : color.toRgbString();
        return cl.replace(/ /g, '');
      };

      let changed = 0;
      let previousColor;
      this.$el.find(`[data-colorp-c]`).append(colorEl);
      colorEl.spectrum({
        containerClassName: `${ppfx}one-bg ${ppfx}two-color`,
        appendTo: elToAppend || 'body',
        maxSelectionSize: 8,
        showPalette: true,
        showAlpha: true,
        chooseText: 'Ok',
        cancelText: 'тип',
        palette: [],

        // config expanded here so that the functions below are not overridden
        ...colorPickerConfig,

        move(color) {
          const cl = getColor(color);
          cpStyle.backgroundColor = cl;
          model.setValueFromInput(cl, 0);
        },
        change(color) {
          changed = 1;
          const cl = getColor(color);
          cpStyle.backgroundColor = cl;
          model.setValueFromInput(cl);
          self.noneColor = 0;
        },
        show(color) {
          changed = 0;
          previousColor = getColor(color);
        },
        hide(color) {
          if (!changed && previousColor) {
            if (self.noneColor) {
              previousColor = '';
            }
            cpStyle.backgroundColor = previousColor;
            colorEl.spectrum('set', previousColor);
            model.setValueFromInput(previousColor, 0);
          }
        }
      });

     // Added event
      if (em) {
        em.on('component:selected', () => {
          changed = 1;
          colorEl.spectrum('hide');
        });
      }
     // ++++++++++///

      this.colorEl = colorEl;
    }
    return this.colorEl;
  },
```

I was trying to add this action inside the picker callbacks but i can't was not managing to get the right context to do so.

What do you think?  Should i try something different or can i submit a pull request?

Thanks a lot for this excellent library, i'm learning a lot diving into the source code.

Best regards,

Juan.
