Would be nice to update to append_before_action in jammit/controller.rb:96 to remove the notice in Rails 5 and be usable in 5.1.
We were using Jammit on a Rails 3 application which we just upgraded to 4.2.6.  After deploying to production we started getting this error and our page views/css do not display properly

```
NameError (undefined local variable or method `page_cache_directory' for #<Jammit::Controller:0x007f1daee33488>):
```

We are on Rails 4.2.6, Ruby 2.3.0, and Jammit 0.7.0

Can anyone provide some insight on if there are compatibility issues with Jammit and Rails 4.2.6?  If so can you point me in the direction of where this needs to be fixed so I can PR.  Or should we scrap the gem and migrate to the asset pipeline?

Add a `-t, --test` flag which checks configuration and dumps out the list of files being compiled (reifying wildcards and the like), which could be dumped to a log or a manifest file.

Am i missing sth or change committed in dcc9b02c2b9254fc4e6e53ba4a2dbc36378540cd left us without timestamps in generated urls?

If you introduce the character sequence `\'`  (that is backslash single quote) into a jst file for compilation with _.template,  the compilation breaks.   `\ '`  (that is backslash space single quote) does not have this problem.


It seems jsmin (and cssmin) are no longer maintained. So, should jsmin be used in the project? I am currently packaging jammit for Debian. But, It can't be completed because of the json-evil-license under which jsmin is released. And, it won't be changed (since it is unmaintained). This directly affects the inclusion of jammit in Debian as jsmin is a runtime dependency for jammit. Moreover, since jsmin is unmaintained, any bugs that may come in the future will not be rectified.

I saw that the last version of jammit depended only on yui-compressor. It is still maintained. It seems to be a better choice now.

helps with debugging bad ruby in assets.yml

I was configured to use the Google Closure Compiler:

```
javascript_compressor: closure
```

But was unwittingly falling back to jsmin because

```
require 'closure-compiler'
```

was failing silently due to it not being installed.

Hello!

For javascript code written in [YUI modules](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/yui/create.html) I wanted to have my assets automaticaly built using [YUI's shifter](http://yui.github.io/shifter/) each time the specified asset is missing or when it is changed.
# Feature Added

By adding the two following lines in the assets.yml config file of Jammit

```
build_assets: true
javascript_builder: shifter 
```

You will have your assets built with Shifter each time Yammit is loaded. This build process will occur only if the asset file is missing or if the file has been modified (in the git sense).
# Limitation

As we need to know the name of the YUI module if it is missing, we need the full module path in the assets configuration. Therefore any assets glob defined with a wildcard (`*.js`) will NOT be shifted.
# Suggestions?

This is a specific development for our team's app that relies heavily on YUI Shifter.
I will therefore leave this pull request open to any discussion/suggestion/improvements
