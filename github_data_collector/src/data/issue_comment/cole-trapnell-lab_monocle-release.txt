I'm having trouble running differentialGeneTest on my data. This is the line I used:
```
diff_test_res <- differentialGeneTest(monocle_cds[expressed_genes,],
                                      fullModelFormulaStr = "~Media")
```

I got the following error:
Error in '[.data.frame'(pd, , i) : undefined columns selected

Going through other issues people have posted, I tried reducing dimensions by DDRTree using:
```
monocle_cds <- reduceDimension(monocle_cds, max_components = 2,
                         method = 'DDRTree')
```
and that still gave me the same error.
Hi, 
I am quite new to Bioinfomatics but I was wondering if it's normal that the genes identified with PCA (using Seurat) are different from the genes shown by the heatmap generated using the BEAM function. 
Shouldn't they be the same to some extent? 

Best, 
Sara
When `monocle3` was used to calculate the pseudotime of 170,000 cells, `cds <-learn_graph(cds)`was run, but after calculating a few rounds, the error message was displayed as :

```R

If I run a small number of cells, I will not have this error, but every time I run a large number of cells, an error will be reported. Is this a software bug or is my operation error? How can I handle this error
Hi,

I am using the BEAM function (monocle 2.14.0) to test for branch dependent changes in in gene expression with the default settings. The function completes and the structure of the output makes sense, but I get the warning:

```
> BEAM_res <- BEAM(wt_filtered_cds)
the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be usedthe condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used
```

where ```wt_filtered_cds``` is a valid CellDataSet object that successfully produces results for other analyses. 

It looks there are two warnings stacked together. I am unsure what might be causing these warnings, but it could easily change results if the function is considering different input than I expect, for example. The learned cell trajectory plot has > 1 branch point (I get the BEAM warning no matter what the cell trajectory plot looks like).

Any ideas would be appreciated. 

Cheers,

Hi, 

Perhaps a very silly question, but I am very new to the field of scRNAseq analysis (and R in general). I am currently getting familiar with Monocle 3 after having worked with Seurat, mainly to be able to link my index sort files with my scRNAseq data. 

Now I am also doing the rest of the analysis in Monocle as well, and have done clustering and differential gene expression analysis by using the vignette online (https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/docs/differential/). However, I cannot seem to find anywhere how to export files with the DEGs per cluster... I have 5 clusters and am very curious to the lists of genes that are differentially higher expressed in those clusters compared to the other ones.

In Seurat, this was very straightforward to do, perhaps in Monocle as well but I have not managed to find out how. 

Hope someone can help me out with this supposedly easy problem!

Kind regards,
Florencia
Want to use monocle2 to show the trajectory. But in the **plot_pc_variance_explained** , it showed the warning, and I can not make sure how many pc are explained. So I set the parameter **num_dim = 10** in the run of reduceDimension, and I confront the error as the following. But when **num_dim = 2** was setted, it can run.

Anyway, I want to know, whether there is a error in the upstream analysis? Or never mind.

```

Hi,

We want to use monocle3 for pseudotime analyze. But it generate a totally different UMAP than Seurat and it split into too many clusters.  Monocle3 generates pseudotime based on UMAP. Can we use the UMAP of Seurat?

Thanks!
Hi, I have some very naïve questions that despite the intensive search on web material you provided, including your great tutorials (from 1 to 3 version) I was unable to answer by myself. 
Surely it is my fault, but I also saw other not-yet-commented posts which directly or indirectly linked to my doubts; then probably mine are queries of more general interest. 

In 1 e 2 Monocle tutorial versions you clearly say to users “_Don't normalise data yourself_” since “_…Monocle will do all needed normalisation steps internally._” . [I'm actually using Monocle 2.]
About this “internal" normalisation: 
i) which normalisation are you using and at which step you applied it to the data (considering i.e. the workflow suggested in the #constructing-single-cell-trajectories **\***)? 
ii) is it possible to retrieved these normalise data and how? 

I will really appreciate a comment from you. 
Thank you very much in advance for your attention.
Lu

Hi, 

I’m using data from BDs Rhapsody platform for WTA. 

BD’s data view platform produces both UMIs and normalized data.
 
I was wondering if you’ve used these data in monocle before or have any advice about using pre-normalized data?

Thanks,
Colin 
Hi, 
I'm trying (for the first time) to run Monocle2 on a human dataset of 60.000 cells and 14.000 genes pre-filtered using Seurat3. I accurately followed the instructions here http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/docs/  but when I try to cluster cells the following error occurs: 

>            my_cds <- clusterCells(cds, num_clusters = 6)

I tried to run monocle2 on a toy subset of cells (around 8000) and it works perfectly. I suppose my dataset is too big. I also tried to run it on a cluster using 10 cores but without success. Can anyone help me please?
