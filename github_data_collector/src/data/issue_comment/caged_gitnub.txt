Hello! It is [**Picabot**, an automatic GitHub image optimizer](https://github.com/somu/picabot).

Your repository cointains some images, and I compressed them for you.
Do not worry: the compression is lossless and uses [ImageOptim](http://imageoptim.com) toolkit.

This bot exists to make the Internet faster. There are people who've got a fast internet connection,
but there are countries where additional 50 KBs take a reasonable time to download (like additional 2-3 minutes).
Additionally, this PR is going to save some precious disk space and decrease your server load. Picabot saves
approximately 25% of space. Still, if you do not need your images optimized, feel free to close this pull request.

If I have enough money, I'll build a server which will send these precious pull requests much faster.
And if I had monthly donations, I would dedicate all my work time to open-source, so donations are very appreciated.

I installed all required software, but when trying to start I get:

sudo nub
LSGetApplicationForInfo() failed with error -10814 while trying to determine the application with bundle identifier com.alternateidea.rubycocoa.GitNubApp.

But rubycocoa is installed.

The app compiles and installs on mountain lion. but when I try to open the app. It says it cannot be opened.

Can Mountain Lion be supported?

Build and install worked without issue, though executing the included nub shell script (from either the repo or the installed copy in /usr/local/bin, though I don't know why that would matter) fails with the following error:

> LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed for the application /Users/matt/Downloads/gitnub/build/Release/GitNub.app with error -10810

However if I execute:

> /Application/GitNub.app/Contents/MacOS/GitNub &

everything is peachy. I'm not sure what the open call w/ bundle name is supposed to buy you but at least on my machine it doesn't seem to be necessary.

I found this error in the console log: `ApplicationController#awakeFromNib: SystemStackError: stack level too deep`
Happens in `/Library/Frameworks/RubyCocoa.framework/Resources/ruby/osx/objc/oc_attachments.rb`
In a call that originates from:
    /Applications/GitNub.app/Contents/Resources/ApplicationController.rb:55:in 'awakeFromNib'
