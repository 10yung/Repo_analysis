Here's my first stab at adding SpotBugs support, as per #178. Basically copied the FindBugs extension.

I am unsure of how to actually test this on a real project though. Any help on that front would be welcome.

One important note though is that the SpotBugs plugin requires gradle 5.0+, which would imply that the code-quality-tools plugin will also require gradle 5.0+.
