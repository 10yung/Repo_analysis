My APP needs to support up to 19, has how to libiner what is <23

Manifest merger failed : uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 19 cannot be smaller than version 23 declared in library [com.github.JesusM:FingerprintManager:v2.0.2] /home/eduardo/.gradle/caches/transforms-1/files-1.1/FingerprintManager-v2.0.2.aar/7c2037e20af6bfd8e3c14bd469d6281f/AndroidManifest.xml as the library might be using APIs not available in 19
	Suggestion: use a compatible library with a minSdk of at most 19,
		or increase this project's minSdk version to at least 23,
		or use tools:overrideLibrary="com.jesusm.kfingerprintmanager" to force usage (may lead to runtime failures)

i want to add latest version 2.0.2 but it did not resolve that dependency
The new `Style.kt` class allow to modify certain string resources and the style of the main dialog.
There is a easy way to change title, message or string resource about dialog? 
Dear @JesusM,

Thanks again for the nice library.

If a fingerprint of a user is not recognized (either due to the user using the wrong finger or just a generic scan error), I would like perform a retry immediately. So in my case for `JFingerprintManager.decrypt()` in the `DecryptionCallback.onFingerprintNotRecognized()` I want to call `JFingerprintManager.decrypt()` again. However, I'm getting an infinite loop now, where `DecryptionCallback.onFingerprintNotRecognized()` gets called immediately when initializing the second`JFingerprintManager.decrypt()`.

Is there a way to prevent this? Or is it a bug?
