Hello, this is an auto-generated Pull Request. ([Feedback?](mailto:repobot@movermeyer.com?subject=pypip.in%20Badge%20Bot%20Feedback%3A%20nosebook))

Some time ago, [pypip.in](https://web.archive.org/web/20150318013508/https://pypip.in/) shut down. This broke the badges for a bunch of repositories, including `nosebook`. Thankfully, an equivalent service is run by [shields.io](https://shields.io). This pull request changes the badges to use shields.io instead.
Building on @jluttine's work in #21, this will add some more robust, long-overdue jupyter testing, including conda support.

It seems that if I use `--with-nosebook`, nosetests runs only notebook tests, not any normal unit tests it would run without `--with-nosebook`. Is this how it should be or am I doing something wrong? Is it possible to run _all_ tests with a single call to nosetests?

blocks [yamlmagic](https://github.com/bollwyvl/yamlmagic/issues/3), at least.

We have finally upgraded our environment to IPython 3, so I'm trying nosebook again. Now on every notebook I get:

```
E

Make a bunch of notebooks with failing tests and run with nosebook. After a few fail you start getting kernel creation failures along the lines of:
#

It seems like test failures leak files.

I tried adding a manager.shutdown_kernel() in a finally block in loadTestsFromFile but that was insufficient to fix this.

nosebook wants to upconvert v2 and v3 notebooks to v4 format which doesn't work if v4 is not installed. It would be nice if it still supported v2 installations. That means falling back on conversion failure to v3 format, using nb.worksheets[0].cells instead of nb.cells, and a few other small changes.

I'm not sure what the issue is. I tried to run the new version and it failed as it wanted to convert the notebook format to v4, which I didn't have. So I updated my iPython install and tried again, and now I get:

/Users/gram/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nose/plugins/manager.py:395: RuntimeWarning: Unable to load plugin nosebook = nosebook:Nosebook: cannot import name v1

From @gramster on #12 about [this line](https://github.com/gramster/nosebook/commit/8f154c1f7c886e1d68bc0683fa64c5a9994577ef#diff-03a52edbcaf7a67fca355960b893b3cdR68):

> The startup script is because we have a config.py that gets loaded in our environment and I need to load that in the test environment too (it contains just a single import in our case).

I suggested going with the nosebook-like `setup`.

Additionally, it seems like accepting a dotted-notation module may be more nose-like than a path. 

initial configuration would be like:

``` bash
nosetests --with-nosebook --nosebook-setup=scripts.setup_environment
```

and then i guess `scripts.setup_environment` would be loaded in the kernel: if importing that module has side effects, so be it!

Borderline YAGNI, It may be desirable to implement like scrubs, where the argument can be either:
- a string as above
- a list of strings, to import in order (somewhat unnecessary)
- a dict of notebook patterns to a string or list
