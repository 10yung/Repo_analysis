Hello peiyunh, thank you for an amazing paper. I want to know more about foveal descriptor in your paper. Also it would be helpful for me if you can indicate the foveal descriptor part in your code. Thanks
Hi, I'm new to training a model and I'm trying to train a using a resnet but realise that there's no model for resnet in cnn_init. Can I get help with this? Thank you in advance

And I face problem to train with alexnet too. Is it because AlexNet is not using dagnn?
@peiyunh Hi there im new to the whole computer vision scene and i was wondering if you or anyone else could help by releasing a step by step tutorial on how to train your model on other data sets. it would be very helpful. 

Thanks in advance
thank you very much,  I try to train using my own dataset, but i am confused about here,
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31917641/49087826-ec652a00-f292-11e8-875f-f6d982d971b8.png)
 my dataset is images and XML (annotated result), I do not know how to convert my dataset to the mat file.
can anyone tell me? Very appreciate for your help.
The bounding ellipse linear regression is a powerful  method to improve the ContROC result. But I can't find  the code in this project. Do you mind sharing it? Thinks!! @peiyunh 
Hello, analogously to other approaches, which layer can be used to perform a face recognition params vector?

Thank you,

Hi, I two questions about the code and paper.

The first one is the term"templates" used in the paper. It seems to be some features extracted from a trained Resnet. But in which part of the code this extraction is implemented? 

The second one is that if I train a new network(e.g Mobilenets), how can I get the new "templates"?

Thanks for answering my questions.
Hi Peiyun,
My query is regarding certain parts of `cnn_get_batch_hardmine.m` which is hard to understand and thus hard to port to other frameworks. 

In particular, I am not sure what is happening in the section from line 186-250. Similarly, the transformation from line 300-322 isn't well documented. It would be immensely helpful if you could elaborate on what is going on in those sections.
Your working is very nice !!!
Do you have any plans to use tensorflow or caffe to implement this paper?
