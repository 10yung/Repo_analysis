The remote resources that this library's installer pulls in seem to have been removed from the AWS bucket where they had been mirrored following the incident documented in https://github.com/louismullie/treat/issues/115/.

Specifically, the resources documented/pulled in by indentlabs' fork of the gem (and discussed in the Github Issue referenced above): https://github.com/indentlabs/treat-gem/blob/master/lib/treat/core/installer.rb

If anybody has these resources locally (i.e. in your present install of the gem), please share with me (I have an email on my Github profile) and I will mirror them and fork the gem accordingly 🙏 
I want to install Treat in my Rails 5.1 - API only app, but I am unable to install 'treat'. After adding in Gemfile, it succeeded in `bundle install`.

After that as mentioned in manual, I started IRB to run the commands but it throws me following error - 

> /home/stldev/.rbenv/versions/2.3.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/activesupport-5.1.4/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:292:in `require': cannot load such file -- zip/zip (LoadError)
	from /home/stldev/.rbenv/versions/2.3.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/activesupport-5.1.4/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:292:in `block in require'
	from /home/stldev/.rbenv/versions/2.3.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/activesupport-5.1.4/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:258:in `load_dependency'

I am using `Roo` gem in the project which also internally uses zip. Is the version used conflicting with treat?
Any help will really be appreciated.

Hi, I'm running Fedora 25, and I'm trying to use treat. The gem itself was installed seamlessly, and I then wanted to install the French package (`gem install treat`, with gem 2.5.1).

A first error I had was about `stanford-core-nlp` which wasn't buildable because `JAVA_HOME` wasn't set.  A simple `export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk` resolved the problem.

However I meet a more important problem with the download of models for the Punkt segmenter for the French language. Here is a sample of what I did and its result:

```
▶ ruby --version
ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26 revision 54768) [x86_64-linux]
▶ irb --version

▶ irb

Is my gem version out of sync with the repository structure it's trying to fetch from? Does it result from a deprecation decision? Should I move to a newer version of treat through the github repository?

What I observed:
Thanks for installing Treat.
  To complete the installation, run `require treat` in an IRB 
  terminal, followed by `Treat::Core::Installer.install`. 

But "require treat" did not work for me on OS X El Capitan. It should be:
  require 'treat'
with the quotation marks.

- The `birch` dependency does not build on ruby >= 2.2: https://github.com/louismullie/birch/issues/11 ...  I worked around this referencing this fork in my Gemfile: https://github.com/louismullie/birch/pull/12
- Installing treat via Bundler and attempting to run `Treat::Core::Installer.install` will nuke existing installs of `nokogiri` before attempting to install it. Treat's install attempt will fail and many of the other dependencies will fail. The gem does not seem to play well with existing apps (in this case Rails) that use bundler for managing gems.
- Even if I had been able to successfully install the gems above, the installer later attempts to pull down assets from an inaccessible server: https://github.com/louismullie/treat/issues/117 and https://github.com/louismullie/treat/issues/119

I respect the effort the maintainers have put into this project, but my searches suggested this was the leading NLP gem for Ruby and I just spent a considerable time just trying to get it installed without much success. Putting this here as a warning to others.

## **Treat.install fails** with exception:

_Treat::Exception: Couldn't download www.louismullie.com/treat/punkt/english.yaml. (response code was not 200 OK, but was 502 )_

Hi all,

The server that holds the files necessary for the core installer is currently down. There is a mirror for most of the files at `s3.amazonaws.com/static-public-assets` but I've had no luck finding any of the Reuters models anywhere. So I guess there are two main issues here.
1. `louismullie.com` is down
2. There doesn't seem to be a clear place to download the Reuters models.

If anyone could remedy either of these issue or has a solution to the second one, please help.

Thanks! 

I tried to install english pack, 

```

Treat::Core::Installer.install 'english'

```

failed with errors below:

```

Does anyone has the same issue?  It seems the language package host is down now, anyone can help on this please?

Is there anyway for manual installation of those language packages?

I'm just running the code in the quick tour at the bottom for classification. 

The object clearly contains the method.

d2.sentences[0].methods
 => [:time, :name_tag, :tag, :category, :tokenize, :parse, :type, :type=, :<<, :method_missing, :invalid_call, :language, :similarity, :distance, :unserialize, :serialize, :visualize, :classify, ...

so yeah...

Edit 1: In addition, the first time i run the code, i get 

LoadError: cannot load such file -- graphr

its only after subsequent times that i try to run the classification code that i get the first error.

Edit 2: I tried using the most up to date commit instead of the rubygem, and i get other kinds of errors when running the whole code, so that didn't help.
