Hello everyone 👋 

It's been over a year since this project was released. The feedback so far was phenomenal and it' seems that some people really find this project useful despite my initial thoughts. 

I'd like to make the second version of it and I need your opinions on it. The idea is to introduce a completely new structure similar to the 30-seconds-starter kit. 

Things I would like to include in the second version: 
- Make the project 100% accessible, and add accessibility category
- Introduce visually pleasing dark mode
- At least one new category (e.g. Computer Science)
- Make it with Gatsby (so many things out of the box)
- Add the ability to share questions
- Individual pages for each question (better SEO I guess)
- Remove expertise tags, at least visually (so many people complain about it)
- Add about page
- A form to submit new questions without GitHub account
- Host the project on Netlify
- A random interview simulation

What do you think about proposed changes? Would you like to see something else? What current parts of the projects do you like the most?
I'd love to see a "Dark Mode" feature implemented. I find myself browsing this site at night on my phone, and I think having the option to toggle a dark theme would greatly improve the experience for certain scenarios like night time browsing. 

Although there are many ways to implement this, I found a straightforward approach via this implementation example - https://flaviocopes.com/dark-mode/. 

Looking forward to seeing if anyone else is interested.  
The question `css-sibling-selectors` seems to give a partially wrong answer.

As per [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#general-sibling-combinators), the `~` (tilde) combinator does not work the way it's described in the answer. Instead, it's almost the same as the `+` combinator except that the element following the combinator doesn't have to be placed immediately after the one before the combinator.

On a side note, the W3C seems intent on changing the combinator names, in fact this appears to have happened already in the currently active level 3 spec. The `general sibling combinator` (`~`) was renamed to `subsequent-sibling combinator` and the `adjacent-sibling combinator` (`+`) changed to `next-sibling combinator`. One might consider using these names as well.
