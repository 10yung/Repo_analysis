This appears to live in 
```
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/lib/
```

and I can get it to run if I add the following to the command line: 
```
TEST_FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/lib/
```
I'm getting this imported into my Carthage build folder via this dependency declaration:
```Ruby
github "facebook/facebook-objc-sdk" ~> 5.0
```
Xcode project that's included as a result of the checkout:
```
./Carthage/Checkouts/facebook-objc-sdk/Carthage/Checkouts/xctool/xctool/xctool-tests/TestData/TestProject-Library-64bit/TestProject-Library-64bit.xcodeproj
```

We have scripts that verify the presence of all referenced files to ensure developers don't include files that won't exist for others. This project includes a non-existent reference to `TestProject-Library-32And64bitTests-Info.plist`.

Hello , I would love to be able to get a list of all my tests, eg for counting and ensuring that when a suite is done that it did actually test the expected number of tests. 

However, when I try to use the  listTestsOnly feature, I only get back the target, not the tests. In other words, if I pass a value on the commandline I get its value back.

Is this as it is designed? Or am I missing something? 
```
$ xctool -project MYAPP.xcodeproj -scheme Enterprisefly   -sdk "iphonesimulator12.2" run-tests   -listTestsOnly -only 'MYAPPTests'

[Info] Loading settings for scheme 'Enterprisefly' ... (8454 ms)

=== RUN-TESTS ===

  [Info] Collecting info for testables... (3154 ms)
  run-test MYAPPTests.xctest (iphonesimulator12.2, iPhone 5s, logic-test)

** RUN-TESTS SUCCEEDED: 0 passed, 0 failed, 0 errored, 0 total ** (3159 ms)

```
If I run it without the -only , then it shows just a list of all our Kits, again not including the tests inside them.

I upgraded Xcode to 7.2 today without installing the simulators.

When I used `xctool -reporter json-stream` from Buck, Buck's JSON parser failed because `xctool` printed nothing to stdout (not even an empty JSON object `{}`). It did print an error message to stderr:

  % /path/to/xctool -reporter json-stream -sdk iphonesimulator run-tests -logicTest /path/to/test.xctest 
  ERROR: SDK 'iphonesimulator' doesn't exist.  Possible SDKs include: 

It'd be nice if `xctool` could make sure to print a valid JSON object to stdout even on failure.

I'm facing an issue with xctool after upgrading the Facebook SDK to v4.6 which, for some bizarre reason, causes xctool to hang. Reverting to a commit before the upgrade of the FBSDK results in consistent behavior. The FBSDK upgrade was the only change made in that commit.

The error that causes the hang is reproduced below:

`2015-09-17 14:36:54.510 xctest[41073:302260] NSURLConnection/CFURLConnection HTTP load failed (kCFStreamErrorDomainSSL, -9807)`

At the point of failure, the test that's running (unrelated to FBSDK in anyway) is attempting to make a network call. However, the call itself has been stubbed out via Kiwi so no actual network activity is being generated. Monitoring the execution of the tests using XCode and Charles Proxy, I noticed that no network activity is happening due to tests during normal execution. If that's the case, I think it's strange that this error even appears in the first place..

We're building using XCode 6.4 and our build target is iOS 8. After upgrading from v0.2.4 to v0.2.5 of xctool, xctool will sometimes run to completion with no error and sometimes hang. Between the two different outcomes, nothing code wise is changed.

This seems to be related to the issue that was closed before, but may have resurfaced in some way or form..
https://github.com/facebook/xctool/issues/451

The tests don't hang and pass normally while using XCode. Would be glad to provide additional details.

A unit test accessing the iOS keychain fails when run via `xctool` but works when run via `xcodebuild`.

This issue has first been described [here](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/2782)

Here are my own tests, look at the bottom of the build log:
- [with xctool](https://travis-ci.org/Cocoanetics/DTFoundation/builds/42902299), failure "No keychain is available. You may need to restart your computer" 
- [with xcodebuild](https://travis-ci.org/Cocoanetics/DTFoundation/builds/42904254): the tests pass
