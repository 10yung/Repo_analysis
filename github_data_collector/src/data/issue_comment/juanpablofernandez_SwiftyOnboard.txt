Resolved by reassigning (x,y) of container view to (0,0)
This is because, the container view's x & y are shifted, according to the non-fullscreen view's x & y.

Steps to reproduce:
1. In the example project's use 'Storyboard Example View Controller'
2. Adjust the view that is connected to the code, and shrink in size.

3. Try running, and find that the customPage is also shifted wrt the view's x & y.

- Add macOS-specific files to gitignore
- Remove .DS_Store files in project

I cannot fit more than 2 lines of text to the SwiftyOnboardPage title label. Is there a way to get more lines? numberOfLines is set to 0 (auto) originally and I tried to manually set it to 0 and 3. I also tried to call sizeToFit() and set adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth = true. If it matters I have manually set a custom font with size of 22 and I am testing on iPhone 6 Plus simulator.
## Bug
If I try to customize some constraints, I have a problem. My first idea is to create a `SwiftyOnboardPage` class and override the` setUp () `method to my constraints. It`s not work, after that I try to override `init ()` method, but`init () `in` SwiftyOnboardPage` does not have a public type. 

## Solution
After then I updated the original `init ()` method in `SwiftyOnboardPage` and all works pretty well.

## Bug
Same problem is override `setUp` method

## Solution
Set `setUp` method as `open`

If you have any other idea to craate your own page, please tell me.
Hi,
The skip and continue buttons are not working. Can you help me with this please?
In this PR I added support for RTL languages so the scroll is from left to right.
I use the `didSet` method of `shouldSwipe` to be able to change the `isScrollEnabled` property of the container view.
Does SwiftyOnboard support right-to-left languages, so user can swipe from left to right?
