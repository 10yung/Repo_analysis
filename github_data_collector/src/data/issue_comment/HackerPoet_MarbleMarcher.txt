Can you please help me doing a version with Visual Studio 2017, I think there is something odd in here...

Build succeeds (with instructions from README), but launch fails with error

```console
Illegal Instruction: 4
```

Does anyone know what is happening?
Hi. 
I would like to include this in guix. 
Is it stable?
Could you tag a release?
The mouse sensitivity seems a bit fast. I can't find a good place, even when in Low sensitivity that allows me to be level with the ball and not spinning around it. Perhaps there should be a larger neutral zone and less range on the maximum height and spin speed?

Looks good!
It would be very usefull and probably easy to implement a AssetsMods directory lookup to allow overriding of game's assets, for safe modding.
The titles says it all. Maybe, with access to the marble's rotation, using triplanar or even cube mapping it would be possible to implement a skin system for the marbles.
I mean, can you add this feature, please? :)
To stretch game on screen with low resolution :)

Marble Marcher generates absolutely beautiful images, and it would be nice if we could easily capture those. Screenshots should:

- not render the UI
- render the game at a configurable resolution - for example, I may be running the game in 1080p, but want to take an 8k screenshot.
Please refer to https://0x46.net/thoughts/2019/02/01/dotfile-madness/ for more information.

TL;DR; throwing everything at the user's home directory is a terrible idea that should stop. Making use of `$XDG_DATA_HOME` would be ideal.
