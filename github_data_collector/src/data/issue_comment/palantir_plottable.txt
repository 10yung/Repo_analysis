[Tooltips demos](http://plottablejs.org/tutorials/tooltips/) on the Plottable website don't work. Maybe they haven't been updated?
Dependabot's update of webpack-dev-server from 2.11.1 to 3.1.11 cause version mismatches due to its dependencies on later versions of webpacks with breaking changes (such as separating webpack-cli into a separate package). This caused errors when yarn start was run after installation and build.
In addition, in a test-case for row wrapping in chart legends the strings were no longer sufficiently long enough to cause row wrapping, causing tests to fail despite legend row wrapping functioning fine. I elongated the strings enough that now the test runs correctly.
Is Plottable actively developed? I see web site examples not updated
for the new version.

For exampleI would like to use rollup and test the following:

Users should be able to pull in just the parts of Plottable they care about using import statements:

// import just the Category Axis
import { Category } from "plottable/build/src/axes/categoryAxis";


## Bug report

I've got a bar graph using a GuideLineLayer in a similar way to the Space Race example at http://plottablejs.org/examples/spacerace/.

I have the same fault as can be seen with the example where when I hover over the last item (First Man on the Moon) as the label is aligned to the left of the gridline the text cannot be displayed due to lack of room.

The documentation refers to xAlignment which takes the arguments "left", "centre" and "right"which I assumed refers to the placement of the label.

However any change to either xAlignment or yAlignment has no effect and the label is always shown at the bottom left of the gridline regardless of these values.

My plan was to detect where the mouse is hovering over the graph in the onPointerMove and change the xAlignment accordingly.

Live example URL: (unable to get jsfiddle to work but this issue can be easily seen using the demo at http://plottablejs.org/examples/spacerace/)

Steps to repro:
1. Create a Plottable.Components.GuideLineLayer
1. Set the xAlignment to "centre"
1. Allow the graph to be drawn normally

### Expected behavior
The text label of the date for the gridline should be centre to the guideline

### Actual behavior
The text label of the date for the gridline is always bottom left regardless of what xAlignment, or yAlignment is set to. however calling the getter for these methods returns what I have set the value.

### Possible Solution
The text label should respect the alignment and update accordingly.

### Context
Ensuring that the date label can be seen regardless of where on the graph the mouse is currently hovering over.

### Environment
<!--- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->

- Plottable version: 3.8.6
- Browser name/version: Google Chrome Version 75.0.3770.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)
- OS name/version: MacOS 10.14.5

example: https://jsfiddle.net/12Lmx4jh/2/
## Bug report

As described in https://www.chromestatus.com/features/6662647093133312 chrome has started handling events differently. This is affecting, for example, zoom behaviour in plottable, even in the examples on the page.

Quick fix is to set { passive: false } when setting up the listeners.

Live example URL:
http://plottablejs.org/examples/finance/
Steps to repro:
1. Install chrome 73
2. Go to url
3. Zoom and check the console output
4. "[Intervention] Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener due to target being treated as passive. See <URL>"

### Expected behavior
Scroll behaviour is leaking from the component to the rest of the page. The component should handle this as zoom.

### Actual behavior
The component is both zoomed and the rest of the page is scrolling.

### Environment
- Plottable version: 3.8.5
- Browser name/version: Chrome - Version 73.0.3683.86 (Official Build) (64-bit)
- OS name/version: Mac os 10.14.3
## Bug report
Looks like some sort of typings errors.

Steps to repro:
1. `git clone https://github.com/palantir/plottable.git`
1. `yarn install`
1. `yarn build`

### Expected behavior
no errors

### Actual behavior
```

### Expected behaviour

The rightmost column should remain unaffected in both cases.

### Actual behaviour

Parts of the rightmost column disappear.

This is just one example; I've seen the chart get scrambled in other ways if this condition occurs.
Hi there!

DragInteraction, today, supports MouseFilter that lets consumer choose which events to ignore and what not. Can we generalize that a little bit more and have a general filter for all PointerEvent?
Context: https://github.com/palantir/plottable/blob/develop/src/interactions/dragInteraction.ts#L81

What I want to achieve: I would like to disable touch interaction in certain case and it seems like one way to achieve that is through the {Mouse,Touch}Filter concept in DragInteraction.
