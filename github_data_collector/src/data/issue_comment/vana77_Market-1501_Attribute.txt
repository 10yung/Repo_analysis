 Thanks a lot, i want to label some data with attributes ,but i can't find propriate label tools to finish it.
Dear sir, How can I add attribute detection to the re-ID code, using the python language instead of running in matlab
Thanks for the work! I came across the original paper and it seems that only 24 attributes are used in the APR paper, but the dataset has 27 attributes in total. I tried to look through the paper and see if there's any specific reasons for it and did not managed to find any. May I kindly check what are the 3 attributes that are not used and if I am supposed to throw out those attributes when doing experiments?

Thank you!
As shown in following picture, the label indicates that the person doesn't have a bag. But it seems that the person has a bag.
The age seems like adult instead of teenager.
The upper-body clothing seems like pink instead of white.

I found two images were inappropriately labeled. The color differences are calculated by CIEDE2000. RGB value standards are according to Wikipedia. I randomly picked a 3x3 area and got the mean RGB value followed by converting to L* A* B* space.

[RGB_Pink](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Shades_of_pink) = [255, 192, 203]; 
[RGB_Purple](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Shades_of_purple) = [128, 0, 128];
[RGB_Yellow ](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Yellow)= [255, 255, 0];

1. 0430 in bounding_box_train or 227 in market_attribute.train

It was labeled as downpink = 2.
My results: de_Pink = 65.4, de_Purple = 16.3;

2. 0601 in bounding_box_test or 289 in market_attribute.test

It was labeled as upyellow = 2.
My results: de_Yellow = 85.1, de_Purple = 17.8;

Values were different according to the picked area, but the differences were significantly large.
