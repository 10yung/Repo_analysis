zstd is a modern compression format that is gaining more support. For instance, Arch Linux recently switched its packages to .zstd.
Normally, the old commands works.  But very rarely, it outputs a string
like the following instead:
❯ hexdump -n20 -e '1/1 "%02x"' .hg/dirstate
77bba665e970146bd2be0b2da40092e340*
8804

Changing the command resolves the problem:
❯ hexdump -n20 -e '20/1 "%02x"' .hg/dirstate
77bba665e970146bd2be0b2da40092e340408804
