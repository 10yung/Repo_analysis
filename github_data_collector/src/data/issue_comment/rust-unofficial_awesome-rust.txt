Hi,

Sorry for that, I missed to change the build badge, is it good now!

And also changed the repository.

Thank you @luciusmagn

(This builds on top of #789 so we've got a fixed README.md)

Given this is meant to be awesome Rust stuff, and that the Ruby checker appears to have various issues (e.g. when repeatedly checking the README it wants to do *all* of them every time), I wrote a Rust version of the checker. This doesn't do anything majorly different yet, but could be improved in the future to do things like cope with Github actions links not being available for checking for not logged in users, and possibly find the broken build links that I did a lot of manually in #789
