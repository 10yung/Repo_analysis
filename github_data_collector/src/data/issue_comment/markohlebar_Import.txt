Please let me know if this is still working with Xcode 10.1 or will be working with coming versions. And if yes please mention the proper way to integrate

but I binding success
Environment:Xcode 9.2 (9C40b) + OS X 10.13.2

Given there is an import already in the source file
`#import "TMKObject.h"`

When I add the import like so and `cmd+ctrl+p`
`#import "TMKObjectEquality.h"`

Expected:
The import is added to the import list. 
```
#import "TMKObject.h"
#import "TMKObjectEquality.h"
```
Actual:
The import is not added to the import list with a message `"The import has already been included"`


It would be nice if the plugin could insert the new `import ...` alphabetically. For example we have current import lines:

`import CoreGraphics`
`import Foundation`
`import UIKit`

if we're to add a new import line like `import CoreLocation`, it would be like this:

`import CoreGraphics`
**`import CoreLocation`**
`import Foundation`
`import UIKit`
