## Motivation

#2452 

## Test Plan

Code was checked by loading different images in showcase app. Best examples are [here](https://pasteboard.co/IOELqmJ.png) and [here](https://pasteboard.co/IOELuVY.png).

### Description
Fresco failed to load images from `EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI` e.g. `content://media/external/images/media/8039`, `FileNotFoundException` was seen from the logs

### Reproduction
Loading images with `EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI` `content://media/external/images/media/8039`

### Solution

I found that inside `com.facebook.imagepipeline.producers.LocalContentUriFetchProducer`, given the above content uri, it will fall to the call `getCameraImage` and which in turn getting the absolute file path of the image. However, due to scoped storage in targetSdk 29, that wouldn't be allowed. Probably getting input stream like

```
ParcelFileDescriptor pfd = mContentResolver.openFileDescriptor(contentUri, "r");
FileInputStream fis = FileInputStream(pfd.getFileDescriptor());
```

### Additional Information

* Fresco version: 2.0.0
* Platform version: Android 10


### Description
I'm new to android and i just want to put a GIF in my layout without getting lag.
I added the most recent version of Fresco in my dependencies but when i try to do 
Fresco.initialize(this);
it make my app crash.


### Here's my dependencies 
    implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:fresco:2.0.0'
    // For animated GIF support
    implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-gif:2.0.0'

### I initialize Fresco in my MainActivity this way:
   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        Fresco.initialize(this);
       ....
   }

### And my layout look like this:
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:fresco="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context=".Activities.MainActivity"
    android:background="@drawable/main">

    <com.facebook.drawee.view.SimpleDraweeView
        android:id="@+id/my_image_view"
        android:layout_width="130dp"
        android:layout_height="130dp"
        fresco:placeholderImage="@drawable/something" />
</RelativeLayout>

### Description

A new feature in fresco which allow a user to change shape of each corner into a quarter of ellipse with parameters (a width and a height of the quarter) described by a user. 

### Work plan:
- create a function to change a shape of the image into an ellipse with original width and height.
Examples [here](https://pasteboard.co/IOELqmJ.png) and [here](https://pasteboard.co/IOELuVY.png),
- extend the function from previous point by custom width and height,
- create a new function to round each corner with custom width and height based on similar algorithm to one used in functions above.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts, comments or suggestions. 
### Description

The latest release found [here](https://github.com/facebook/fresco/releases) has no changelog. However, there are [a lot of changes](https://github.com/facebook/fresco/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0) since the previous release, too many for Fresco users to go through to get a grasp about what has changed, what's new and what's now deprecated or obsoleted.

### Reproduction

Check the releases page, see no changelog / release notes for v2.1.0.

### Solution

Add a changelog.

I prefer to [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) in a CHANGELOG.md file in the root of the project, which may be easier to find. Or, if this project contains many subprojects, keep a changelog at the root of each subproject.

### Additional Information

* Fresco version: v2.1.0
* Platform version: N/A

### Description

Any URI photos aren't loaded on API < 20.

### Reproduction

Open "Showcase" App on "Simple Drawee" tab.

### Solution

In log for this error you can read that it is connected to okhttp3, so I tried a solution from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52342768/java-net-connectexception-failed-to-connect-to-overpass-api-de-178-63-48-21780) [(this one)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35554380/okhttpclient-proxy-authentication-how-to), but it didn't solve anything. Next I tried first solution from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24357863/making-sslengine-use-tlsv1-2-on-android-4-4-2). It also didn't fix anything, due to problems with Google Service. I even tried to manually add TLS and remove SSL from list of enabled protocols. Even if last link isn't pointing a solutions, it is probably pointing a core of the problem. Older versions of Android are not supporting TLS or even if they are it is not turn on by default. [This issue](https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/2372) can be probably used as a solution for API >= 16, but it is not a solution for the oldest versions. 

In Showcase App almost all photos are loaded in the way affected by this issue. Maybe it is worth considering to change it? At least for the oldest versions.
