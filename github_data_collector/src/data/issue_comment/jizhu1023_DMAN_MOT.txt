 Will you push the training code to this repo, or when? Thank you~
Hello, thanks for your works. When I run the DMAN_demo.m, there are some errors:
1、In MOT_track.m, the function MDP_value is lost

2、I copy the MDP_value.m from MDP project, however, there are too many parameters input to the MDP_value function.
