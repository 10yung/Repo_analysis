fixes #62
Swift Compile Error

```
No such module 'SideMenu'
```

Installation instructions in README.md, specify

`pod 'YALSideMenu', '~> 2.1'`

meanwhile the highest version available on cocoapods is 2.0.1:

```
$ pod search YALSideMenu

YALSideMenu (2.0.1)
   Animated side menu with customizable UI
   pod 'YALSideMenu', '~> 2.0.1'
   - Homepage: https://github.com/Yalantis/Side-Menu.iOS
   - Source:   https://github.com/Yalantis/Side-Menu.iOS.git
   - Versions: 2.0.1, 2.0, 1.2.0, 1.1.0, 1.0 [master repo]
```

Based on list of releases (https://github.com/Yalantis/Side-Menu.iOS/releases) I conclude that instructions simply incorrect, and not that version is missing.
