When I use MacGap to wrap Google Keep it works beautifully.
There is unfortunately still one issue: The top bar of the website is flashing while I am scrolling.

This is my complete `index.html` for reproduction - but its nothing special, it just wraps Google Keep (and I am using macOS Catalina btw):
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>MacGap</title>
  

  <style type="text/css" media="screen">
    html, body {
      height: 100%;
      width: 100%;
      background: #FFF;
      padding: 0;
      margin: 0;
      overflow: hidden;
      -webkit-user-select: none;
    }

    h1 {
      color: #E0E0E0;
      margin: 18% 0;
      text-align: center;
      font-family: helvetica;
    }
  </style>
  
</head>
<body>
  
  <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
      MacGap.Window.resize(900, 1000)
      window.location.href = 'https://keep.google.com';
  </script>
  
</body>
</html>
```


The red area's height is 60, and I set the titlebar's height as 60. Now I can't click the input textfield with left mouse button but right mouse button is work.
I'm using the recent (actually not so recent) HTML5 Blob API to download a file from a JavaScript client like

```javascript
/**
     * Save a text as file using HTML <a> temporary element and Blob
    */
    var saveAsFile = function(fileName,fileContents) {
        if(typeof(Blob)!='undefined') { // using Blob
            var textFileAsBlob = new Blob([fileContents], { type: 'text/plain' });
            var downloadLink = document.createElement("a");
            downloadLink.download = fileName;
            if (window.webkitURL != null) {
                downloadLink.href = window.webkitURL.createObjectURL(textFileAsBlob);
            }
            else {
                downloadLink.href = window.URL.createObjectURL(textFileAsBlob);
                downloadLink.onclick = document.body.removeChild(event.target);
                downloadLink.style.display = "none";
                document.body.appendChild(downloadLink);
            }
            downloadLink.click();
        } else {
            var pp = document.createElement('a');
            pp.setAttribute('href', 'data:text/plain;charset=utf-8,' + encodeURIComponent(fileContents));
            pp.setAttribute('download', fileName);
            pp.onclick = document.body.removeChild(event.target);
            pp.click();
        }
    }//saveAsFile
```

When the `Blob` is not supported it uses the standard DOM way.
When I run my application within MacGap2 running this code called let's say like:

```javascript
saveAsFile('my_report.json',jsonString);
```
 will lead to this error:

```
2018-04-23 19:35:08.270857+0200 sendMessageWithDictionary: Failed to get remote object proxy: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=4097 "connection to service named com.apple.rtcreportingd" UserInfo={NSDebugDescription=connection to service named com.apple.rtcreportingd}
```

I'm not sure if this is connected to the secure transport due to the `NSAppTransportSecurity`, but in my case I'm creating a downloadable content on the fly, which url is on `localhost`.

I have also tried to intercept the link click through the `PolicyDelegate`, but for some reason I do not get any log here:

```Objective-C
- (void)webView:(WebView *)webView decidePolicyForNewWindowAction:(NSDictionary *)actionInformation request:(NSURLRequest *)request newFrameName:(NSString *)frameName decisionListener:(id < WebPolicyDecisionListener >)listener
{
    if (WebNavigationTypeLinkClicked == [[actionInformation objectForKey:WebActionNavigationTypeKey] intValue])
    {
        NSLog(@"CLICKED %@", [request URL]);
    }
    [[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] openURL:[request URL]];
    [listener ignore];
}
```
why?
when i use document.location,it show
Hi, I know this is probably not a feature rather than a glitch, so I think it would be awesome if refreshing the view (through the webkit debugger) would also reload the static files. At the moment, if I want to change my javascript files, I have to reload the entire app which is a bit more cumbersome.
Probably a dumb question, but does MG provide a way to call js functions from Obj-C and call methods from JS to Obj-C ?

If not, then what is best method to accomplish this?

It seems very important to be able to stream standard output/input/error from a task. As far as the API, I would suggest node's `stream.Readable` class - which seems to be a popular abstraction for this use case.

Should I just ignore these or are there plans to fix them?

Hi,
Where can I change the height of the title bar container like this:
