Can you publish this to Firefox Addons?
Maybe I got something wrong, but it seems that octohint only works for public repos, not private ones?
i'm talking about golang that use tab officially

an example: https://github.com/go-playground/validator/blob/v9/_examples/simple/main.go
I ran `yarn && yarn start`

But it stops at:
```
Child html-webpack-plugin for "options.html":
     1 asset
    Entrypoint undefined = options.html
    [./node_modules/webpack/buildin/global.js] (webpack)/buildin/global.js 472 bytes {0} [built]
    [./node_modules/webpack/buildin/module.js] (webpack)/buildin/module.js 497 bytes {0} [built]
        + 2 hidden modules
```

What's going on?

And if I download the crx from chrome store, install it to firefox resulted in `There was an error during installation: File /Users/linonetwo/Downloads does not contain a valid manifest`.

Can you provide a release for firefox officially?
When trying to use this on a [Bitbucket Server](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/server), it does not work. I added `http://companyname-git:7990/*` to the options.
(Tested on github, not an installation issue)

Is Bitbucket Server supported? Could the port in the pattern be an issue?
Is there a way to tell if octohint is active on a page (possibly changing the extension icon when active)?

Chrome 63.0.3239.84
octohint 2.0.1
First, awesome extension ðŸ¥‡ 

I tested it by immediately browsing this same repo and the hint gets clipped by the code view.

You can reproduce by going to [`octohint/scripts/get-node-libs.js`](https://github.com/pd4d10/octohint/blob/35d924a9d952d96d0b9e1ec36be517b3c36bacbf/scripts/get-node-libs.js#L4) and hovering over `fs.readFileSync`

It would be really cool if this extension worked in pull requests as that would make reviewing things a lot more efficient. Is this possible at all?
