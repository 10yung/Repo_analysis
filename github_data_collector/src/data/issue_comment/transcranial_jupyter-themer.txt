I'm trying to change the fonts used by Jupyter Notebook using the --font and --typography arguments in jupyter-themer but no matter what arguments I give it, I keep getting a 'Bad argument passed to --font/--typography. Have a look at the screenshot I've attached.

The arguments I'm passing appear to be valid according to jupyter-themer's --show helper so I'm confused why they generate errors. What am I doing wrong?

Adds new folder with screenshots of a jupyter notebook under every available theme.
It makes the comparison easier
The license requires that all copies of the software include the license.  This makes sure the license is included in the wheels.  See the wheel documentation [here](https://wheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#including-the-license-in-the-generated-wheel-file) for more information.
Hi,

I get typography not supported error when I use `-t serif` option while changing the theme

Thanks
this css selector appears to be off:

.rendered_html tbody tr:nth-child(odd)
as is, the gutter gets in the way, especially when scrolling horizontally

Your project looks very interesting, and I was glad to test it out. Unfortunately, I got an error: "Error writing to custom.css". From this message, though, I don't know exactly what's wrong. Is it an issue with file permissions? I'm able to edit the file myself, so I wouldn't expect that. Does it not find the file? I have it in the normal location (~/.jupyter/custom/custom.css). I get the error whether or not custom.css already exists.

It would be nice to have an error message that let me know exactly what the issue was so I can troubleshoot it more effectively. Thanks!
Hello,

Thank you very much for the nice work.

I tried using the `jupyter-themer` to set a Theme in my Jupyter Notebook but it actually had no effect.

I tried doing this: " Old ipython configuration files, for example at the default` ~/.ipython`, may need to be remove" but I actually do not know where to find this. 

I also tried what is mentioned in #5 of replacing the `custom.css` by the theme I want. I did this but I do not know if I replaced it in the right place, I did it in the following directory: `anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/notebook/static/custom`

Could you please help me make this work ?

Thanks :)
Would it be possible to introduce other examples of the available typographies?

Using the Monokai theme renders the symbols: 
**= , [ ] ( )** 
extremely hard to see.

They are dark blue by default, which is fine against a white background, but near unreadable against the dark Monokai background.

I am working with Python 3 on Win10_64 and Linux 64. Here is an example:
