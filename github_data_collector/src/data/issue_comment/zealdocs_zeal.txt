No Microsoft Windows API
I want to use zeal to query windows driver documents， but after I download the c and c++ documents，i can not found wdk function . for example the function NtCreateFile or ZwCreateFile. I can found it from microsoft document (https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/search/?search=zwcreatefile&category=All). Did I not find it or it is not exist  in zeal ?

the funtion information: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-ntcreatefile
You can use [iterators-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iterators-polyfill) for MDN docsets (or you can get NodeList.prototype.@@iterator-polyfill here [Polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/v3/url-builder/))

When set up scaling to more than 100% (specifically 150%) and scaling method in Compatibility properties for zeal.exe to either "System" or "System (enhanced)", Zeal freezes and unloads after a while if tray icon is enabled and clicked in order to show main Zeal's window.

Reproduce:
- Enable UI scalling to, say, 125-150% ("Settings", "Ease of Access", "Screen", "Change size of apps and text on main display")
- Enable showing/hiding window using tray icon in Zeal's preferences
- Close the program and navigate to Zeal's installation directory
- Open context menu on zeal.exe and select Properties
- Choose "Compatibility" tab and press "Change high-res DPI settings"
- Check both checkboxes
- In first list select "When the program is launched" (instead of "When user logs in")
- In second list select either "System (enhanced)" or "System"
- Close all preferences windows with OK buttons and try to run Zeal
- Hide window and try to show it using tray icon
- You can try to click context mouse button as well

Result on my system: Zeal locks and closes itself after a while
Expected result: Zeal hides/shows its window

Disclaimer: I find it better to navigate Zeal with such settings even with blurred text, as in the "Application" setting mentioned above Zeal is not rendering UI elements properly (many of them are rendered smaller when OS UI is scalled up, especially in Preferences window). This may be a subject of bugfixing instead, so elements would be in proper size and fonts would be sharp.
In ember docset some functions search throws error message:

Error opening C:/Users/Khons/AppData/Local/Zeal/Zeal/docsets/EmberJS.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/api.emberjs.com/ember/3.13/functions/@ember%2**52**Futils/isBlank.html: System cannot find the specified path

And yes this path is not exist.

Original path is:

C:\Users\Khons\AppData\Local\Zeal\Zeal\docsets\EmberJS.docset\Contents\Resources\Documents\api.emberjs.com\ember\3.13\functions\@ember%2Futils\isBlank.html

Something weird with %2**52**F and %2F

Thank you.

Related to #560 maybe

While trying to download the Javascript docs on a raspberry pi zw, the download will fail around 70%. Trying again will fail at various points, leaving new download remnants in /tmp/. My connection on it should allow the 300mb download to happen in 2 minutes.

The hardware is very stable, I was able ssh the application files in from another computer, extract the zip etc. Meanwhile zeal crashed near the same point 3 times. 

All the smaller docsets work fine.

kindly assist to resolve. Thanks
As soon as I start Zeal, CPU usage for only Zeal shoots up to 100% instantly. I've uninstalled all docsets and the problem persists. As soon as I close Zeal everything is back to normal.

I'm using Zeal version 0.6.1 on Xubuntu 19.10.

I'm not sure when the problem started, but I have my computer's CPU information and temperature permanently displayed on the bottom of my screen, so I don't think it could have been that long. It's possible it started when I upgraded to Xubuntu 19.10 which was about a week ago.

I've looked at similar issues but it's not #965 or #211 as it's not Xorg that shoots up to 100% CPU usage but rather Zeal itself.

It's also not #999 because it also happens on the home screen without any docsets installed.
When reopening the window shows up a few pixels below where it was when was last closed.
E.g. after opening, resize and position it around 100 pixels from top of screen and then close. After reopening, the window has the same size but the top position is around at 150 pixels from top of screen (values are merely an example, I didn't measure the proper values).
This way, if it starts around near the top of screen, after reopening it a couple of times it will show up around the middle to the bottom of screen.
I cleaned the `window_geometry` value in the .ini but the issue still happens.
