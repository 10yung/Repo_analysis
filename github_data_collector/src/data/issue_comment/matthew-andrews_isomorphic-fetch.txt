Using URLSearchParams() as body doesn't set content-type to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org section 5.2

```
  const body = new URLSearchParams({
    grant_type: 'client_credentials'
  })
  fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'accept': 'application/json',
    },
    body: body})
```
A workaround is to pass it explicitly. `node-fetch` package works as expected.
```
'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8'
```

The following code results in the fetch executing as normal with no termination.
```js
  require('isomorphic-fetch');

  const controller = new AbortController();

  setTimeout(() => {
    controller.abort();
  }, 2000);

  return fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal })
    .then(response => {
      return response;
    })
    .catch(error => {
      throw new Error(error.message);
    });
```
Using node-fetch instead of this library allowed me to fix this issue with no other implementation changes.
closes #178

httpbin.org is a good api for testing
it is useful cuz you know what the request header/body you made did look like
FIX #181
Version 3.0.0 is causing issue.

```
└─┬ @yeutech-lab/test-polyfill@1.1.3
  ├─┬ isomorphic-fetch@2.2.1
  │ └── whatwg-fetch@3.0.0 
```

For some reason, the way it is set in package.json install the 3.0, 

This ticket is for settings whatwg-fetch in the package.json
This PR is similar to #157 except for also refreshing other dev dependencies' major versions, otherwise the tests didn't pass (` Uncaught Error [ERR_STREAM_CANNOT_PIPE]: Cannot pipe, not readable`).

As noted well in that PR, the changelog for breaking changes in Node.js can be found here:
https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v200

I updated the version in `package.json` to 3.0.0 (major change).

I also added reading the headers in the tests, just to verify that this functionality in `node-fetch` works as expected.

I believe we can close #157 and accept this. @matthew-andrews wdyt? seems like there's interest in this (#179)
## Environment

We are experiencing issue on travis while using semantic-release.

This happen because of a package having being fixed `node-fetch@2.3.0` for semantic-release to work and styled-components having an outdated node-fetch through [isomorphic-fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch/issues/new).

Users that use both semantic-release and styled-components will have issues.

## Reproduction

https://travis-ci.org/yeutech-lab/rollup-umd-documentation/jobs/459847412

```bash
$ npm ls node-fetch
@yeutech-lab/rollup-umd-documentation@2.4.2 /home/dka/workspace/github.com/yeutech-lab/rollup-umd-documentation
├─┬ @semantic-release/github@5.2.5
│ └─┬ @octokit/rest@16.0.1
│   └── node-fetch@2.3.0 
└─┬ styled-components@4.1.1
  └─┬ css-to-react-native@2.2.2
    └─┬ fbjs@0.8.17
      └─┬ isomorphic-fetch@2.2.1
        └── node-fetch@1.7.3 
```

## Steps to reproduce

- semantic-release: v15.12.1
- styled-components: v4.1.1

## Expected Behavior

To have `node-fetch@2.3.0`

## Actual Behavior

Styled-components bring `node-fetch@1.7.3` and breaks semantic-release.

## Solution

- **short term**: `npm install node-fetch@2.3.0 --save-dev`
- **long term**: Upgrade chain of dependencies, require help of https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch/, https://github.com/facebook/fbjs, https://github.com/styled-components/css-to-react-native/ and https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components

whatwg-fetch was updated to version 3 but there is actually [a "compatibility issue" with webpack](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch/issues/174), this PR sets whatwg-fetch on a major version 2
