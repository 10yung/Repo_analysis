Hi all.
    l got the "memory not mapped " error when used the findClusters function of densityClust. It works well when using 10K cells, and it gets the error using 50K cells. This is because of the data matrix too large? 

The details of the error as following: 
 dclust <- findClusters(dclust, rho = 30, delta = 1.5)

 *** caught segfault ***
address 0x7fbc3dad5040, cause 'memory not mapped'

Traceback:
 1: findDistValueByRowColInd(x$distance, attr(x$distance, "Size"),     i, higherDensity)
 2: findClusters.densityCluster(dclust, rho = 30, delta = 1.5)
 3: findClusters(dclust, rho = 30, delta = 1.5)

Possible actions:
1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
2: normal R exit
3: exit R without saving workspace
4: exit R saving workspace



Hi,

I have a question about how to define rho and delta.
Based on the clustering plot obtained with "plot(irisClust)" which criteria did you use to define rho=2 and delta=2? It is not clear to me how to inspect the plot to define these thresholds.

Thank you,
Ana
I've been playing with a dataset that gives slightly, but importantly different results across a range of values for `dc`. This prompted me to walk through the `estimateDc` code to make sure I understood how it was generating a value. It seems that it is iteratively finding a distance that lies between `neighborRateLow` and `neighborRateHigh` (default 1-2%) of the distances. 
I've had a few cases where `estimateDc` enters an endless loop. Do I understand it correctly that I am producing a similar estimate if I just use `quantile(dist, 0.015)`, which does not hang? On the handful of datasets that I've tried, this produces a value very close to what I  get with `estimateDc`,  but I want to make sure that I understand properly that `estimateDc` is just a faster way of getting an approximate quantile.
