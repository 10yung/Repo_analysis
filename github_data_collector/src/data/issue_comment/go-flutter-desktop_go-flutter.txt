Hello, thanks for great project to help building desktop application using flutter,
There is problem when hover build windows completed, I find program file in the project directory
....\go\build\output\windows\xxxx.exe
When I change directory name from windows to chinese charactors name, the program xxxx.exe is not running when you click it,back to english directory name,it works again,It is also happend when there are chinese charactors path name,like c:\Ê∏¨Ë©¶\windows\xxxx.exe.
I don't know why? Please help me to check out what is going wrong. 
https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter/issues/332 doesn't crash anymore (cannot fix it)
now using: https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter/issues/314

fixes: #314
fixes: #332
I want to write an application on all platforms, it's a perfect solution working with `go-flutter` on desktop platforms. But I wonder how can I write apps efficiently on Android or iOS, I had seen `go mobile` or `go bind`, it seems I need to write code on Java/Kotlin or Swift, which is called by Dart and pass to Go API. I think there must be some ways simpler to call Go API in flutter.
<!-- Thank you for trying go-flutter! -->

## Error output

No errors are being displayed

<!-- Please share the output error with the associated hover command -->

Tried out the draggable component of flutter which does not seem to work on desktop (Windows). Probably it might not work for Mac and Linux too.

## Environment
```
Windows 10
go-flutter v0.34.0
```

## Step to Repreduce 

1. Copy the sample string  "üç∑helloüé§worldü§ó" into a **TextField**
2. Click **Backspace** key in the keyboard to delete any character
3. Then the crash happens


## Go Error
```
runtime.boundsError
runtime error: slice bounds out of range [4:3]
```

EDIT: This now uses ELF blobs instead of plain AOT blobs
Second effort at fixing #133, first fix failed and reported in #326

---
First effort:
This fixes the issue where on MacOS the embedder crashes during window resizing.
fixes #133

This dosn't fixes the jankyness during resize.
Follow flutter/flutter#44136 for more info.
When running the executable of a snap the console shows:
```
/snap/ginko/x1/ginko: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by /snap/ginko/x1/ginko)
```
I'll try to find the version of hover where snap packaging wasn't broken and the fix the current version.

After #308 my app only shows a blackscreen and spits out this error on linux (also tested windows with wine and got the same error):
```
2019/12/26 12:59:30 error.go:171: PlatformError: GLX: Failed to make context current
```
When running using `hover run -b '@2d582358f34c257933c47e1f0591fc38c713c78c'` (the previous commit) the app starts like normal so it's definitely an issue with #308.

we can use js to replace when some widget no support , first we need webview!!
