When I am using flip transition on iPhone 6 Plus, it's fluctuates while flipping.
In certain circumstances the main view becomes detached from the window after a transition. If I try to update the parent viewcontroller due to orientation changes for example. When I come back it appears and then immediately disappears after viewDidAppear. Occasionally, the same is true for viewcontroller I move towards. The viewcontroller appears then immediately disappears after transition. Any thoughts?

It would be great to have all this transitions as CustomSegues :)

can not drag back like ios7

is it because of storyboard? 

...nimation are just simple CABasicAnimations.

This is related to https://github.com/applidium/ADTransitionController/issues/14

The ADTransitionView within ADTransitionController was laying out using
the viewâ€™s frame, not its bounds; on iOS 6 this was causing the
transition view to be positioned 20 points below the top of the view if
the navigation bar is hidden.

I have the following configuration - UIViewController placed in UINavigationController which is placed in UITabBarController.

My view is added as subview to the view of UIViewController and has constraints to fill the space between navigation bar and tab bar. Everything works if I do not use transitions (ADTransitionController does not work). When I activate ADTransitionController the animation itself works fine but when it's completed I find that my view has been resized - the new height is smaller by 49 points (the height of Tab bar).

It looks like ADTransitionController is responsible for the resizing of my view but I cannot understand the reason and find where it happens. Could you help me?
Thanks in advance!
