Fix for #59 

I've just copied the DateTime conversaion that is used in Send-BulkGraphiteMetrics

The conversion from DateTime to Unix time is broken

``` powershell
>Send-GraphiteMetric -CarbonServer 127.0.0.1 -MetricPath 'test' -MetricValue 123 -DateTime (Get-Date)
Send-GraphiteMetric : Cannot convert value "24/05/2016 09:38:46" to type "System.UInt64". Error: "Invalid cast from
'DateTime' to 'UInt64'."
At line:1 char:1
+ Send-GraphiteMetric -CarbonServer 127.0.0.1 -MetricPath 'test' -Metri ...
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidArgument: (:) [Send-GraphiteMetric], RuntimeException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvalidCastIConvertible,Send-GraphiteMetric
```

I am trying to add various metrics for our different windows machines.
For example.
<Counter Name="\PhysicalDisk(*)\Disk Bytes/sec"/>

But all I am getting back from our 2012 server is:
VERBOSE: Metric Received: My.server.hdd.s-drive.diskbytes-sec 0 1460556980

No data, just a date.

From a windows 10 machine, I get
VERBOSE: Metric Received: 85752.2772612114 1460557190

Here are the powershell versions of the 2012 machine:
PS C:\Windows\system32> $psversiontable

Name                           Value

PSVersion                      4.0

thanks

First wanted to say this is an amazing script, many thanks for making it. I just wanted to check whether you were thinking of adding some additional functionality where previously logged perfmon counters to .csv file could be parsed?

I'm looking to add additional servers to gather metrics to dump into Carbon/Graphite. Do I create an additional config xml?

When trying to use the counter:

<Counter Name="\LS:SIP - Peers(*)\SIP - Connections Active"/>

I get the following error:

Get-Counter : The specified object was not found on the computer.
At C:\Windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\Graphite-PowerShell\Functions\Start-StatsToGraphite.ps1:119
char:28
-             $collections = Get-Counter -Counter $Config.Counters -SampleInterval ...
-                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - CategoryInfo          : InvalidResult: (:) [Get-Counter], Exception
  - FullyQualifiedErrorId : CounterApiError,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetCounterCommand

It looks like it is because the output has multiple "sources" for the output instead of just one value.  When i change the counter to just one value like:

<Counter Name="\LS:SIP - Peers(_total)\SIP - Connections Active"/>

It works fine.

I have an issue where the metrics that are collected for CPU processor time differing from running get-counter cmdlet. I can have the Start-StatsToGraphite running in a console side-by-side to another PS console running get-counter cmdlet, both polling \Processor(*)\% Processor Time, at 5 second intervals, and the metrics vary greatly. On the side with the cmdlet running I will have cookedvalues of 6 to 17, however on the side running the Start-StatsToGraphite the verbose output says 0 to 1.5.

Small tweaks that might be useful.

Allow "dot" in sample counter name

Hi there im wanting to monitor metrics from a fairly busy web app hosted on an IIS box. I came across this which is great but the script takes about 120 seconds on a big box (16 cpu 64gb ram etc) to push all the metrics I want to graphite. Im assuming this is because its processing them in single threaded fashion. Is there a way to make this multi-threaded at all?
