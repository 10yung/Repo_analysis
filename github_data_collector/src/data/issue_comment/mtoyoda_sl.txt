ignore sigquit as well, otherwise you can just send ^\ instead of ^C. sneaky.
NetBSD doesn't have ncurses and sl works fine after PR#63
is merged.
ncurses default install allows linking via -lcurses as well.
Let's work with both.
From nodelay(3)

Initially the terminal may or may not be in cbreak mode, as the mode is
inherited; therefore, a program should call cbreak or nocbreak
explicitly. Most interactive programs using curses set the cbreak mode.
Note that cbreak overrides raw. [See curs_getch(3X) for a discussion of
how these routines interact with echo and noecho.]

This allows sl to function perfectly on NetBSD Curses.

sl is my 2 year old's most frequent request on my computer. He said it should smile more because it was a train.
I have forked this repo and merged some of the PRs I found the most interesting and relevant.
If you feel like anything else should be included or changed, please do make an issue with the fork and or do a new PR!

Thanks!
Hi,

I noticed that executing sl with l flag did the same locomotive as lc flags.
I thought it was a bit sad since you can combine others flags without any problem.
I will never be able to (properly) use `ls` again. Just want to see the little train go. Choo-choo!

Sometimes I misspell `sl`, and the list of dirs/files appears, which could even be useful, but.... I'm now considering to symlink `ls` to this, so I will not miss the little train.

Choo-coo!

If `-e` is provided, allows interrupt by Ctrl+C.
If `-d` is provided, disco mode activates: train changes color during travel.

I'd bother to separate these into two PRs but I see there are already 6 other open PRs.
