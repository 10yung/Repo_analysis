Hi Guys,

how to use class in image below:

Tks!
Looks like the (breaking) changes in less v3 aren't supported.

Assetic\Filter\LessFilter.php @ line 112: less.writeError(error);

less.writeError() is no longer a function, and throws an error. Would be nice to work with the latest version of less, ie 3.10.3.
[scssphp has moved](https://github.com/scssphp/scssphp/issues/4). This PR updates the composer recommendation.

I'm not sure what version of autoprefixer this filter was created for but according to the autoprefixer documentation it should run as a postcss plugin. The argument passed to the construct should be the path to the postcss executable and an argument needs to be set for it run with the autoprefixer plugin. I didn't update variable names to reflect the executable name change but I did add the argument needed for the command so that it works properly.
Hi There.  I am using assetic in a Laravel project.

A recent release 5.6 update in Laravel has updated it's `symfony/process` dependency to `~4.0` (https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/5.6/composer.json#L36), which is incompatible with the versioning used in Assetic. The release upgrade notes are here: https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/upgrade.

I would like to propose updating the `symfony/process` dependency in assetic to allow for 4.0.  I believe that this could be done without requiring 4.0, but allowing for it.

I have done some testing using assetic with symfony/process 4.0, without issue, but clearly this is a community decisions, and requires community assessment.




Drop the 5.3 PHP support fix build failing on 5.3.
All of the underlying Symfony components used by Laravel 5.6 have been upgraded to the Symfony  ^4.0 release series.
