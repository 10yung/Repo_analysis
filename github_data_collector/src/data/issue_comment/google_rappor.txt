I m trying to use my own data to replace the random generated true values, I was following the "data flow" in the website, but there was a little different, I don't know how to use my own data.csv in rappor.
This is using R v 3.3.3

I'm attempting to run the demo (or any example test), but consistently failing during ConstrainedLinModel. Here's an example suing regtest.sh:

Output:
./regtest.sh run-seq unif-small-typical

Hello all,

Thank you again for your work.

After building R-3.0.2 from source on both a ubuntu-16.04 and a ubuntu-14.4 machine, I still got the error message that ggplot2 could not be installed on this version of R. How may I work around this issue?

Warmly,
Jinzhao
related to #77 :  "cannot open file 'analysis/R/util.R': No such file or directory"

Still not completely familiar with proper R package layouts, but I think this is rough start.

This lets the distribution analysis tolerate extra empty columns, so code generating bit counts doesn't need to be precise about how many bits are being counted.

Hi,

I get the following error when I try to run demo.sh. What's wrong here?

Thanks,
Huahang
