When I try to rescale this image: https://wallhaven.cc/w/dgpj33 from its original size 3840x1080 to new size 3046x1050, this happens:

"cannot rescale to this size preserving the image aspect ratio" seems to always show up. I was under the impression that the whole purpose of this utility is to change the aspect ratio of the image?
It would be ideal if pipes were usable with the CLI for enabling more expanded use-cases. After having [worked with ImageMagick](https://blog.alexellis.io/serverless-imagemagick/) in the past - I could see this being a highly requested feature.

With ImageMagick you can have the input arrive from a pipe, or have the output sent to a pipe.

Examples:

Pipe to file:

```
caire -in bridge.jpg -scale -perc 70 > small_bridge.jpg
```

Input from pipe:

```
caire -scale -perc 70 -out smaller_bridge.jpg < small_bridge.jpg
```

Input and output from pipe:

```
cat small_bridge.jpg | caire -scale -perc 70 > smaller_bridge.jpg
```

There are usages of pipes in the OpenFaaS CLI (also in Go) if that helps. https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli

Just ran

	gofmt -w .

on the project root. That's all.
