### Summary

Some various hardening / small changes that I would like to have for my Portus instance.
### Summary

HttpHelpers adds `Accept: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json` header for every outgoing HTTP request. This header is only required for manifests API endpoints.
### Description
bash cannot find init.rb. I guess fix is to use `bundle exec rails runner /srv/Portus/examples/development/compose/init.rb` 

To reproduce this fix #2271 first.

### Steps to reproduce

1. cp examples/postgresql/docker-compose.yml docker-compose.postgres.yml
2. docker-compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up

- **Expected behavior**: All services starting
- **Actual behavior**: portus service not starting

`Attaching to portus_db_1, portus_portus_1, portus_webpack_1, portus_registry_1

### Deployment information

**Deployment method**: With docker-compose.postgres.yml at the repo root.

**Configuration**:

- In a container:
  - Using the development `docker-compose.postgres.yml ` 

**Portus version**: #2228

### Description

error webpack@4.16.1: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version ">=6.11.5". This relates to #1892.

### Steps to reproduce

1. cp examples/postgresql/docker-compose.yml docker-compose.postgres.yml
2. docker-compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up

- **Expected behavior**: All services starting
- **Actual behavior**: Webpack service crashing

*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

### Description

### Steps to reproduce
I attempted to spin up portus and push an image. The registry is setup via traefik at https://registry.mysite.com and portus is available https://portus.mysite.com. 

The registry logs show 401 errors about invalid scope, I'm assuming something with oauth but I can't figure out what, any help would be appreciated. 

### Deployment information

**Deployment method**: docker

**Configuration**:
```yml
