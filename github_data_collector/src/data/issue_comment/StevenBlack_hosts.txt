I noticed one of the tracking companies started using a different domain than they did before. It is not on your list right now. 

Is there a preferred way to suggest that host for inclusion, or should I just make a pull request? If so - are there any requirements (e.g. specific branch, comments, etc.)?

Checked [the wiki](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/wiki) and [the existing issues](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/issues?page=4&q=suggest&utf8=%E2%9C%93).
Apologies if this has been discussed before, I looked at over a dozen related issues before opening this.

Any chance you could add an option/switch to `updateHostsFile.py `so that just the list hostnames (no localhost/ip6/else) are listed? This is useful for BSD `pf` tables that will do name resolution itself we simply block all the IPs (in that table) the names resolve to.
Hello, 

I've noticed three domains that popped on my Pi when I was mucking about with Windows 10 apps.

The first two are related to ads, and the third I'm guessing to be background in-app telemetry.
Blocking all three successfully blocked ads and did not appear to affect the apps I was using adversely in any way.

> adbroker.mp.dse.microsoft.com
> s10.adduplex.com
> rawtelemetry-east.servicebus.windows.net

It looks like adduplex is specific and that there may be "s5, s7," though I've only seen s10 in action. Since the domain itself belongs to the ad company AdDuplex, perhaps it should be blocked entirely?

Would https://github.com/FadeMind/hosts.extras be more appropriate for this?

Cheers
The list below lists domains, that are mostly still active for the OSX/Shlayer trojan landing and CnC domains:

Found a page that seems like Google is bypassing the Little Snitch rules based on these hosts.

From what I can tell, there is javascript SOMEWHERE that seems to be creating a proxy then sending all requests through it vs using system host or being blocked by Little Snitch.

Hello! I understand the priority is to report to one of the upstreams, but the only one specializing in tracking domains I found is https://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers which says
> Unfortunately it's probably not worth submitting anything at the moment - spam has taken over. 10,000 mails a month to sift through, even with automated checking, is just too much extra. Fuckin spammers. 

Anywhere else I can report probably tracking domain?
One of my android apps goes to `6cc62a7e.api.splkmobile.com` which, per my research, probably belongs to https://www.splunk.com:
>  The Data-to-Everything Platform 
>  Bring data to every question, decision and action. 

Or, should I create an MR here? Is it best to block `6cc62a7e.api.splkmobile.com` or `splkmobile.com` ?

Hi,
Could you please add also an extension for blocking online game websites?

Thanks.
Hi guys, not an issue, rather a user question. Looks like Opera browser with VPN on ignores my hosts file. I can access sites which are blocked in my hosts file. Is it normal for Opera VPN (or any VPN service) to ignore hosts file? Thanks!


Found an interesting link: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/configuring-networks-disable-dns-over-https

> Network administrators may configure their networks as follows to signal that their local DNS resolver implemented special features that make the network unsuitable for DoH:

> DNS queries for the A and AAAA records for the domain “**use-application-dns.net**” must respond with either: a response code other than NOERROR, such as NXDOMAIN (non-existent domain) or SERVFAIL; or respond with NOERROR, but return no A or AAAA records.

DoH will be enabled by default end of this month: https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2019/09/06/whats-next-in-making-dns-over-https-the-default/

So in short, including `use-application-dns.net` in a blocklist will not enable DoH in Firefox browsers.

(I created this ticket just to bring this to attention and discuss if needed, I'm not seeking any particular action; feel free to close any time)

I noticed Pi-Hole is blocking this domain by default: https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/pull/2915/commits/525ec8cd01cfc069f4c670ac6e9c0aef0a17c02c

For my home network I think I will be blocking this domain as well, mainly to ensure ads/nasty stuff continue to be blocked for my parents.
