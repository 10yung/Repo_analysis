what can I do ?
Hi every one, can some one help me understand the purpose of the spanning tree, what is its function. I had read ORB-SLAM2 and ORB-SLAM paper, i can understand what covisibility nd essential is doing but not the spanning tree, what part in the code use the spanning tree. Thank for your help
I want to try it on Android.

Is there anyone who tries to work with Azure Kinect (New released one)

I'm working with D415 and Azure Kinect 

but it is not working well with Azure Kinect 

Any help or hint about setting yaml file on Azure Kinect ?

 - Both Camera data resized with 640x480 
 - Azure Kinect using NFOV 
 - Using RGB-D ORB-SLAM2 
 - DO I NEED TO CHANGE something with ./example/rgbd_tum ?
 - wonder what I need to put it with baseline * fx (can't understand fully about this value )

Happy holidays... 
Thanks in advance
Recently I am doing a project where I am using a GPU and want to run the ORB-SLAM2 on GPU. 

Any idea which files/functions should be computed fast on GPU?
I could modify the required code and check how much performance gets improved/

Any idea?

I have successfully build the code. 
But vscode can not intellisense  "std::chrono::monotonic_clock"ï¼Œeven though I have set  ".vscode/settings.json" as :
{
    "C_Cpp.default.cppStandard": "c++11",
    "C_Cpp.default.cStandard": "c11",
}
The "Camera.width" and "Camera.height" in KITTI04-12.yaml is 1241 and 376, but in the sequence of kitti 04-12, it is 1226 and 370 actually.
How to get depth of all the detected features in each frame to discard from being used in tracking them with a threshold (example : 40 times the stereo baseline)?
