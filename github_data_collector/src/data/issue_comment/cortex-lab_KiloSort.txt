Hi,

We noticed that sometimes a single spike is counted twice within a single template.  Please see the attached images. The clusters 2958 and 2959 were originally sorted as a single template, but we separated them out for visualization. As you can see in the Trace View, exactly the same event is counted in both 2958 and 2959.  There is a slight offset in two detected time windows, as you see in the comparison between 2958-2959.  This double-counting often causes a peak at the center of the cross-correlogram, and it unreasonably increase the violation of refractory period.  I'm not sure if this issue is related to the issues #13 or #23, but this does not look like a counting of the residual after subtraction, since the Trace View looks like double-counting of exactly the same thing. 

I would appreciate it if you could help us identify the cause of this.  

Thanks,
Hiroyuki

Hello all,

I'm trying to run kilosort on 32-channel data.

For some of our rats, the data is pretty "quiet." For those few rats, I get this error (for others there is no issue running kilosort):

> Error using randperm
> K must be less than or equal to N.
> 
> Error in extractTemplatesfromSnippets (line 54)
> wTEMP = dd(:, randperm(size(dd,2), nPCs));
> 
> Error in learnTemplates (line 12)
> [wTEMP, wPCA]    = extractTemplatesfromSnippets(rez, NrankPC);
> 
> Error in learnAndSolve8b (line 12)
>     rez     = learnTemplates(rez, iorder0);

Thanks in advance!




mexGPUall seemed to run and complete without a hitch

Here is the error:

Hello, 
I am trying to set up kilosort 2, but I am keep running into the same problem. Kilosort gives me an error: "Error running kilosort! An unexpected error occurred trying to launch a kernel. The CUDA error was: invalid argument. 
Saving data to .../filename... Error saving data for phy! Reference to non-existend field "Wphy""

I use Matlab 2019b and CUDA 10.1. I am working with Ubuntu. I tried first to compile the file mexGPUall file and I got response that MEX completed successfully. 
The CUDA error appears later in pre-processing process, after the main optimization. 
I tried to change CUDA version and update my NVIDIA drivers, but so far that didn't help. Also, I am using NVIDA GPX960 and 32GB memory. 
Could you please help me with this issue? 
Hi

I'm using Kilosort 1. I import the data for a 32 ch electrode with a set maximum of 96 clusters. everything is fine up to this point. 
Now: when I use the Phy GUI and manually sort the clusters - after merging clusters, the GUI creates a new cluster-ID and assigned it to a channel. 
You save and it creates the cluster_group.tsv file which I can read. Now my cluster list has like 83 clusters with cluster-ID up to 129 (because of the mergings).

The question is how would I figure out the location of the new clusters on channels. because the Rez file or features_ind.npy file has the features listed with assuming there are 96 clusters (before sorting), but after sorting the cluster.tsv file has different cluster IDs.

Would you help me with this issue?
Hi, 

I am trying to run Kilsort on a 32-channel linear probe data recorded from the hippocampus. However, I am struggling with the coordinates. Since it is a linear probe, will the variables "xcoords" and "ycoords" be the following? 

x= ones(1,32);
y= 1:32; 

Kindly help me out. Thank you.  


Sincerely, 
Ahnaf 
I don't know whether it's a version problem or not. I am using phy2 and kilosort2. I'd like to expand some of the windows to have a better view of details. But I need to redo arrangement of windows for each sorting folder.
Not a big issue, but will appreciate if I can save the layout for my data analysis.
Thanks a lot!

Could you please explain how to obtain the spike detection threshold form the rez.mat file. It seems this is specified in op.SpTh as a multiple of standard deviations. I am guessing the SD deviation is calculated as std() from the preprocessed analog data vector. How can I access the preprocessed data to calculate the exact threshold value and extract individual spike waveforms.
Thank you! ; ) 
Greetings,

Our lab is setting up for Neuropixel recording and I was wondering if you had any suggestions for the recommended GPU for using KiloSort to process that large volume of data. We've not built the machine yet, so any suggestions you might have as far as the best version of Matlab that would work with the recommended GPU would be very helpful.

Thanks,

Hi,

I'm having some trouble figuring out how to assign an identified unit to a channel that is recorded from. Does Kilosort have an output file that has this information? (i.e. unit 1 -> channel 16, unit 2 -> channel 30 etc...)

Thank you!
