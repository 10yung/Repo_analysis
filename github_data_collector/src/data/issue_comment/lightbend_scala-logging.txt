I was hunting for idiomatic approaches to logging exceptions with scala-logging.  I was impressed with the [Try approach described at the end of this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39811926).  

```
object ExceptionExample extends LazyLogging {
  def main(args:Array[String]):Unit = {
    val maybeResult = Try[Int] { "aa".toInt } match {
      case failure @ Failure(throwable) =>
        throwable match {
          case _:ArithmeticException => Success(-1) // Recover from e.g., 1/0
          case runtimeException: RuntimeException =>  // Log RuntimeExceptions
            logger.error("ExceptionMsg", runtimeException); failure
        }
      case success @ _ => success
    }
    println("Getting result");
    val result = maybeResult.get // Will Rethrow on Failure
    println("result = " + result.toString);
  }
}
```

Is there an approach with less boilerplate?
