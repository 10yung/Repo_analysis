Was working fine, and then after a computer restart the program has seemingly broke.

Upon trying to launch PIDtoolbox, the splash screen opens, a windows error sound plays, then it freezes and goes to "Program not responding", before the whole thing exits. No changes have been made between computer restarts so I see no reason as to why it doesn't launch. I'm not sure if there is anyway I can get crash/error messages.

Edit: v0.38 appears to open fine. It's just v0,39

Would it be possible to add the capability to process multiple files at once, then dump the resulting step-response to a GIF file?

Spent the last two days making that and I'm really close to the ideal Servo PID's.

Thanks in advance!

When ever i try to dump a log to desktop and import it into Toolbox, i get an error saying that it doesn't have the required permissions. (Even in admin compatibility mode)

However if i dump the files into a folder held on the Desktop, I can load / process it as normal.
Hi!

I'm developing a bot for plastmatree which uses that tool and telegram bot api to convert log files.  This is kind useful for pilots who doesn't own a laptop, don't want or can't bring a laptop to the field.

I was taking a look at your work to make another bot to integrate it, and I got some doubts. I see that the bot runs on matlab and draws matlab windows to show the output, right? 

I was wondering if it could be possible to output that same windows to an image directly, that way i can run it on my ubuntu server, and send the images back to the users. That would be awesome!

Thanks!
Very useful to catch differences in a quick way.

Thanks
Currently pidtoolbox remembers the last working directory AFTER pidtoolbox is closed.

I keep pidtoolbox open until it either crashes or gets closed inadvertently.  In the time it is open I usually jump between log directories when analyzing multiple quads.

It would be nice if, when load+run is pressed, that it checks if fileA or fileB is loaded and then remember the working directory.

If fileA is loaded and fileB is empty, remember the working directory of where fileA is when load+run is executed.

If fileA is loaded and fileB is loaded then remember the working directory of fileB (since pidtoolbox still "crashes" if trying to load two files from different directories).

If fileB is loaded and fileA is empty, remember the working directory of where fileB is when load+run is executed.

If fileA = same file but fileB has changed (or vice versa) then remember the working directory of the changed file.


Hi

I tried to analyse a BF4.04 Log 
Name/Version: 4.0.4
Binär: betaflight_4.0.4_MAMBAF722.hex
Datum: 01-07-2019 14:36

The csv is created and PTB reads it and the progress bar disappears but then PTB just hangs
Tried a older Log on the same computer and works fine

Mac os X 10.13.6 
I've got some errors during install which is:

And another one kinda like this. After those two I got "Installation successfull" message. After finished installation there is an empty folder PIDToolbox in Applications. When I run the program from Downloads folder(or copying contents of "main" folder to created empty folder in Applications) it is stocking on

Also I have installed MATLAB Runtine R2018b downloaded from MATLAB's site. 
Completely stocked, but very interested in trying this.
 
Would be quite useful to have a possibility of choosing "%time" as X-axis in the spectrogram. 
I.e. having distribution of frequencies in a signal by small timeframes. This would help me a lot in analyzing the frequencies of gyro noise in my setup.
Thanks a lot for the useful tool!
Most likely I'm missing something, so consider this more like request for comment or tip for a topic in the documentation.

When comparing Dterm (unfilt) vs Dterm with "<100Hz" checkboxes checked, I see both peak and mean are larger on "filtered" graph compared to "unfiltered". Filtered indeed looks worse overall too. How shall I interpret this? Is this due to normalisation? Why this does not happened for Gyro spectrograms?

A bonus question on Dterm data, if I may...
Where Dterm unfiltered data comes from? I have debug set to "GYRO_SCALED", does it log Dterm too? Can't see that debug field in Betaflight Blackbox Explorer...
