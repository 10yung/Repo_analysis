### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
If no position is set in a MapView, the map shows the whole world. In this case Basic UI displays the location-off material icon instead of the map (https://github.com/openhab/openhab-webui/issues/7#issuecomment-525525228).

### Describe the solution you'd like
Behave like Basic UI.

For local (ethernet, Wi-Fi) networks it's very likely we don't need
internet connection for connecting to the (local) server, and for
cellular network we indirectly check for internet connection via the
validation flag.

Closes #1633 
<!-- Please search the issue, if there is one with your issue -->

### Actual behaviour
An empty page is shown.

### Expected behaviour
Described in #1062

### Environment data
#### Client
* Android version: 7.1
* App version <!-- Can be found under "About". The build date is not needed -->: 2.11.5-beta
* Build flavor <!-- Play Store and GitHub = "Full", F-Droid = "Foss". If self-built and you haven't changed the flavor, it's Foss -->: Foss
* Device language: EN

#### Server
* Server version: 2.5
### Actual behaviour
I have an wall tablet, which has only openhab app running. After some time the sitemap is not displayed. Just showing the loading circle. App itself is not hanging, menu changes are possible. Only changing the server url back and forth it's working correct for a while.


### Expected behaviour
app should not lose it's connection over time. Reconnection shouldn't be any problem

 
### Steps to reproduce
1. wait

### Can you reproduce the issue in demo mode?
<!-- You dont need to fill all server related information, when you can reproduce the bug in demo mode -->
-> don't know yet, trying. But since its connection related I bet it's not reproduceably in demo mode
<!-- Only on a specific subpage? -->

If I open the color picker popup, minimize the app and use a sitemap shortcut on my home screen, the sitemap is opened, but the popup is still open.
This might be the same for mapview and setpoint popups. 
If I open any activity in the app except the MainActivity and minimize the app, the home screen sitemap shortcuts are not opening the sitemap.
