## Expected Behavior
Just like executing a command in a shell sends output to the terminal, `clasp run` should have an option to do so as well.

Is it possible to create a global configuration setting? For example, I want **all** of my clasp pull/clone commands to use `.js`. I know I can do this by setting the `fileExtension` property in the `.clasp.json` file in the project directory but then I have to set it for each project.

Is it possible to set it globally somewhere, like maybe in the `.clasprc.json` file?


## Expected Behavior

Depends on the `clasp` command being called. Details below.

## Actual Behavior

I am getting errors when running some `clasp` commands. I am able to `clone`, `push` and `pull` just fine but other commands yield an error.

I don't know if it is relevant but, while `clone`, `pull`, `push` all work, after they are done they sit waiting for a 30+ seconds before returning the prompt. I don't know what it is doing or why it takes so long.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

- `clasp list` results in this error:

    > ```
    > request to https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files?pageSize=50&q=mimeType%3D%22application%2Fvnd.google-apps.script%22 failed, reason: unable to get local issuer certificate
    > ```

- `clasp apis list` shows the `# Currently enabled APIs:` but right when it starts to `# List of available APIs:` it shows this error:

    > ```
    > # List of available APIs:

## Expected Behavior

Files in filePushOrder are executed first. Even for compiled typescript code. 

## Actual Behavior

I don't think that filePushOrder is working in a typescript project. I am trying two ways:
- Path of file after clasp push 
"filePushOrder":["ts/helpers/LibraryExternalProperty.gs"],

- Path of file befose clasp push
"filePushOrder":["src/ts/helpers/LibraryExternalProperty.ts"],

neither way the file LibraryExternalProperty.ts is executing first. I put a Logger.log("hi") there and its not logging An error come up first because dont recognize LibraryExternalProperty class.

Can you help me please?

Thanks

  return `Hello, ${person}!`;

Logger.log(greeter(user));

## Actual Behavior
The run button is gray with "No functions to run" tip
