I have been running into this error:

```
(Empire: lateral_movement/invoke_wmi) > interact RGCZ4KPVRRAPHVWY

error running command: Access is denied. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070005 (E_ACCESSDENIED))
```

It happens when I try to execute or run the command.  I have 35 active agents, and about 136 captured credentials.  I suddenly started getting this error after about 2 hours of use today.  I have changed agents, credentials, and target computers.  I have also rebooted a few systems, and cleared tasks for all agents.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Ben


Remove the reference to PowerSploit, SEP is triggering on this item.

When I run the function `Invoke-MapDomainTrust` I get the following exception.

``` powershell
Exception calling "ContainsKey" with "1" argument(s): "Key cannot be null.
Parameter name: key"
At PowerTools-master\powerview\powerview.ps1:10924 char:42
+         if (-not $SeenDomains.ContainsKey <<<< ($Domain)) {
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], MethodInvocationException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DotNetMethodException

WARNING: The specified domain redacted.com does not exist, could not be
contacted, or there isn't an existing trust.
```

It continues running and looping through each item but it's throwing a lot of the above exceptions in my current environment.  It appears to still be returning good results as it finds them as well.

Currently, Invoke-FindDLLHijack does not differentiate between directories in the System path and directories in the current user's path.  It'd be nice to be able to quickly determine if the hijack-able location is only in the current user's path since it affects whether or not the directory can be used for local privilege escalation.
