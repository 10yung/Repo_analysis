Solve the problem that the generated  avi file with 8-bit grayscale image raw byte array data can't be played correctly.
This is not a real pull request, but a reminder whoever comes across this repository. You should not open pull requests here; most developers don't look at the pull requests, so they will be ignored for the most part. The reason is that FFmpeg development, including code review, happens on the ffmpeg-devel mailing list, not here.

This is what the README.md says:

> Patches should be submitted to the ffmpeg-devel mailing list using `git format-patch` or `git send-email`. Github pull requests should be avoided because they are not part of our review process. Few developers follow pull requests so they will likely be ignored.

Please read our [official documentation on how to contribute](https://www.ffmpeg.org/developer.html#Contributing).
