your code was not working correctly for clusters.
Fixes some issues, so it works on clustered scenarios, and also adds some informational outputs when it can't find SQL Server instances or gets connection errors.
Tested on SQL Server 2008R2, SQL Server 2012 and SQL Server 2012 Cluster.
I came from [this post](https://blog.netspi.com/decrypting-mssql-credential-passwords/), and Get-MSSQLCredentialPasswords does not return anything.

After I while I found the following query returns empty result:

```
$SqlCmd = "SELECT name,credential_identity,substring(imageval,5,$ivlen) iv, substring(imageval,$($ivlen+5),len(imageval)-$($ivlen+4)) pass from master.sys.credentials cred inner join master.sys.sysobjvalues obj on cred.credential_id = obj.objid where valclass=28 and valnum=2"
```   

Any ideas? I got no exceptions or errors.
If the user you are using for the DAC does not have the default database set to master, the SQL query "SELECT substring(crypt_property,9,len(crypt_property)-8) FROM sys.key_encryptions WHERE key_id=102 and (thumbprint=0x03 or thumbprint=0x0300000001)" returns empty resultset.

Please add catalog name to the from clause: ...FROM  **master**.sys.key_encryptions ...
The script will fail if running on a shared cluster running sql server as FCI.  For a shared cluster the computer and cluster names are different. 
My smk just got cut by the len() function. You have to use datalength() instead in both queries.

Get the following error:

```
PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-MSSQLAllCredentials
Exception calling "Close" with "0" argument(s): "Padding is invalid and cannot be removed."
At line:33 char:33
+     {    if ($null -ne $Local:BROut) {$BROut.Close()};

Will see if I can follow manual steps but wont be able to share the value :)
