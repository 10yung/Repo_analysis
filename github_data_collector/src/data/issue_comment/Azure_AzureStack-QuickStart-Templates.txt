The template deployment will fail on builds >1910 as teh storage endpoints are updated to require TLS 1.2. By default PowerShell not using TLS1.2. Change in script DSC resource to force PS to use 1.2
I used a custom template to create a deployment, which succeeded yesterday.
The same template today fails with the following message:

{
  "code": "DeploymentFailed",
  "message": "At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list deployment operations for details. Please see https://aka.ms/arm-debug for usage details.",
  "details": [
    {
      "code": "Conflict",
      "message": "{\r\n  \"status\": \"Failed\",\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"code\": \"ResourceDeploymentFailure\",\r\n    \"message\": \"The resource operation completed with terminal provisioning state 'Failed'.\",\r\n    \"details\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"code\": \"FabricVmCreationError\",\r\n        \"message\": \"Failed to create VM 'NetScaler-VPX-Express' \"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}"
    }
  ]
}

Have any idea what may be the cause of this instability in deployments?
Hi there,

we're currently trying to deploy sql-2016-alwayson on our lab-system. The deployment as it is, works pretty well but we're currently facing the issue that one of two SQL-Servers is throwing errors that the aoglistener and the aodns seem to be offline.
The other SQL-server doesn't throw errors and sees the aodns and aoglistener online.

Is it intended to work this way or did we missed out on something?

Best regards
Please update the page for the ASDK part, the AzS-bgpnat01 VM does not longer exist on the new Azure Stack versions


mongodb-cluster appears to be a copy of hadoop-cluster. 
Hi  these files no longer exist and template validation not pass

Hi after finish deployment you will struggle with ScaleSets of Workes, because Network Security for WorkersNSG block you any network connections to File Server.

When you go into app service management inside one of Controller you will see workers in Starting status, example of error for worker:
Info	5/20/2019 3:09:30 PM	Start exercise FileServer at 5/20/2019 3:09:30 PM
Warning	5/20/2019 3:10:00 PM	Failed exercise FileServer at 5/20/2019 3:10:00 PM
Info	5/20/2019 3:11:00 PM	Start exercise FileServer at 5/20/2019 3:11:00 PM

You have to change in template NSG definition, the rule which block connection is 
Outbound_Deny_VNet so you have to add by explicity with low pirority Outbound Allow for File Server Cluster of FIle Server Subnet.

Thanks




The two 101 acsengine Docker quickstart templates are producing the following error:
`Deployment template validation failed: 'The template resource 'swarmm-master-lb-fx2ooljsdc2gk/SSHPort22-swarmm-master-fx2ooljsdc2gk-0' is not valid. The api-version property at line '1256' and column '9' is not defined. The api-profile '2018-03-01-hybrid' for the template does not match any valid api-version for the resource type 'Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/inboundNatRules'. Either explicitly specify the api-version for the resource or specify the correct api-profile for the template.`

Trying to run the template directly from the Azure Stack portal on a connected stack.

Azure Stack version: 1.1901.0.99 (Yes... I know...)
