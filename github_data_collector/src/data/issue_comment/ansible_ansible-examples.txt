RabbitMQ has very specific Erlang version requirements per RabbitMQ version, so this playbook should be updated to show how to install the correct version of Erlang alongside the installation of RabbitMQ.

Fix the example of referencing a variable for looping with `with_nested`.

Before:
```
changed: [localhost] => (item=[u'listvar1', 1])
changed: [localhost] => (item=[u'listvar1', 2])
changed: [localhost] => (item=[u'listvar1', 3])
```

After:
```
changed: [localhost] => (item=[u'a', 1])
changed: [localhost] => (item=[u'a', 2])
changed: [localhost] => (item=[u'a', 3])
changed: [localhost] => (item=[u'b', 1])
changed: [localhost] => (item=[u'b', 2])
changed: [localhost] => (item=[u'b', 3])
changed: [localhost] => (item=[u'c', 1])
changed: [localhost] => (item=[u'c', 2])
changed: [localhost] => (item=[u'c', 3])
```
Hey guys,

I've just updated this role, I replaced the old syntax with the one suggested by Ansible in YAML format
Hi,

Ansible has deprecated "state=installed", so I replaced with "state=present" as suggested by Ansible itself.
With this fix we can close issue #232 

Replace the legacy 'action: module options' with new 'module: options' format.

I looked at `wordpress-nginx_rhel7/hosts.example`:

```
[wordpress-server]
webserver2
```

See https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/56930 ("TRANSFORM_INVALID_GROUP_CHARS doesn't document valid group patterns").

(I would rather Ansible re-think this new rule! But if they do not, they need to make sure they get all the docs & associated examples updated, to avoid confusing people).
Hi,

I've docker community Edition (Version 18.06.1-ce-mac73 (26764)) and Ansible 2.7.10 installed on my mac.
Now I'm running a docker container with ubuntu image with the below command.

> 
docker run --name mycontainer --hostname=mytargethost -p 22 -it ubuntu:trusty

and now I'm trying to connect to the above docker container using below ansible command

> ansible -i inventory all -m ping

but I'm getting below error

> target | UNREACHABLE! => {
    "changed": false,
    "msg": "Authentication or permission failure. In some cases, you may have been able to authenticate and did not have permissions on the target directory. Consider changing the remote tmp path in ansible.cfg to a path rooted in \"/tmp\". Failed command was: ( umask 77 && mkdir -p \"` echo ~/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1556218439.8837771-137578925211239 `\" && echo ansible-tmp-1556218439.8837771-137578925211239=\"` echo ~/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1556218439.8837771-137578925211239 `\" ), exited with result 1",
    "unreachable": true
}

This is what I've in my 'inventory' file

> [docker-containers]
mycontainer ansible_connection=docker

Can someone suggest me what's the issue and how can i fix this?
