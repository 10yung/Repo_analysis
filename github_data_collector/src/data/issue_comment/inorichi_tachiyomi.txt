I am reading Manga horizontally/landscape on my phone so that I get the biggest viewing area. I then scroll down each page from top to bottom reading all the segments, then I switch to the next page.

When I use a Bluetooth controller or Mouse, scrolling doesn't actually scroll the page in Tachiyomi, it just go to the next page. I tried every kind of button on a keyboard as well, and nothing seem to be able to scroll the page.(was trying to find a way to bypass it with keybinds)

It would help me a lot if the scroll function actually scrolls the page up and down Instead of switching page. I can make this kinda work with the Webtoon viewer already, but it scrolls in increments and is hard to follow.

Best regards.

### Story
I don't know how many people are like me, but I chose to read many manga from Manga Rock.
As you know Manga Rock has now shut down and I have to migrate a lot of manga to new source. The experience has been very time consuming.

I tried to think up a better way to better migrate manga to new source, and I'd like to share this and maybe get some feedback.

### What/Requirements
Here are some wireframes I made:

![tachiyomi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36126710/72595916-811a6380-393d-11ea-9e84-24efac4b9715.png)

1. It's quite similar to what's already happening right now (when you try to read, there's a toast message saying that the source has shut down, please migrate). But I thought of adding a Migrate function here. This can also be placed permanently on the page, not just as toast.

2. After you tap on Migrate, you have basically have a pre-determined search page (looking for the same title) but with more info (title, mangaka, last chapter, last update) to make sure that you're choosing the same manga from a new source that's hopefully up to date with chapters as well.

3. Confirmation page. Also gives option to sync read chapters info (default is ON). Tapping on Migrate will: bookmark same manga from a different source, unbookmark manga from old source, sync chapter read info.

I think this simplifies manga migration by quite a lot.
What do you think?

### Device information
* Tachiyomi version: r1549, r1554...... until the latest r1648
* Android version: 5.0.2

（I want to say: sorry, My English is poor, and I did try my best to tell what happened.）

At first, I was used r1531,  but when I tried to update, I found it didn't work. 
After tried several times, I can install r1531~r1540, but the versions newer than r1540 can't install. 

It always said: App Not Installed.

I really don't know how to fix the problem.
A support version of SQLite was bundled at some point for KitKat. This should no longer be needed.

### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Well, it sucks to be unable to rename the default category.

### What/Requirements
When there are more than one Category, the ability to rename the default category should be added.

### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
should be added because if I am watching the chapter and then I want to save it I have to download a chapter that I already saw. It is a way to save mobile data by not downloading something twice.

### What/Requirements
I would like you to add an option to save the chapters of the series automatically when they are read (Example: I opened the first chapter of a series and read it completely. Upon reaching the end of the chapter it is saved automatically. Only saved when it is read completely. If it is not read completely do not save it.).

### Device information
* Tachiyomi version: 0.8.4
* Android version: 9

## Steps to reproduce
1. Set frequency of automatic backup.
2. Wait, then check the backup folder.

### Expected behavior
There should be a new json file in the backup folder.

### Actual behavior
No new file is created.

### Other details

**Battery optimization is disabled** for Tachiyomi.

**Already tried reinstalling**. A backup was successfully created once, but over several days no new backups were created. Max backup files is set to **3**.

I talked to another person in the Tachiyomi Discord server who is having the same problem.

- Me: ransan32#0038
- The other person: Soundtrack2Chaos#8296

They said they were using **Tachiyomi EH**, so this bug is something that originated from this repository and got carried over to that fork.

They also found that for some reason, setting the frequency to **6 hours** got the automatic backup to work properly. I am currently testing this, I do not yet have results but I will update this issue as days pass to see if it works.

They told me (and I agree) that the fact that they managed to get it to work is nice, and the 6 hour interval doesn't have any major effect on usage. However it is still unnecessary for the apps to create backups that often, so it would be nice if the other backup intervals would get fixed.
### Device information
* Tachiyomi version: 0.8.4
* Android version: 9

## Steps to reproduce
1. Find a manga with seasons, counting chapters for each season individually
2. Complete a season while having the tracker synced
3. Continue reading till you're on a new season. The tracker will now stop tracking.

### Expected behavior
This should happen.
The tracker should still track what chapter you're on, despite there being a new season.
### Actual behavior
This happened instead.
The tracker stops when a new season starts.
### Other details
Additional details and attachments.
No additional info needed. Please make a fix for this, it's infuriating having to manually update it after every chapter, and keeping track of what chapter you're on.
**App version:**
0.8.4
**Android version:**
10
**Issue/Request:**
Manga download getting stuck
**Steps to reproduce (if applicable
I thinks it happens when the download gets interrupted
