Fixes #1138 

* Changes the name of the onboarding strings to force an update upstream in l10n (the security onboarding string was previously two different strings, but has been simplified to one - see #1138)
## Steps to reproduce
Open an entry and tap on Edit
Remove completely the username
Tap on Save

### Expected behavior
The username is correctly removed

### Actual behavior
Upon tapping on Save once the username has been removed, a new character, the last one removed, is automatically inserted

### Device & build information
* Device: Pixel 3
* Build version: master 69d8b36

Fixes #1120

This includes a number of fixes in displaying errors during manual create, which is inherited by edit. 

 * only show errors after the user has typed them
  - don't show an error until the input text has been blurred at least once.
  - don't start with an empty hostname / password with an error
  - if the user is typing `http` or `https` then don't show an error until they make a mistake
 * disable the save button even when the user has detected them 
 * ensure that the hostname is minimally at least two words, separated by dots.
This would be on top on #1087. Adding tests for the manual create feature.

### Expected behavior
A hostname should be a valid address, not just "http://" or "www." (or an IP address)

### Actual behavior
Our string matching allows a non-valid hostname (see screenshot) because we only check the following: 
- Contains "http://" or "https://"
- Contains "www."
- Not empty

Possible new error message: "Please enter a valid hostname"? @changecourse 
## Steps to reproduce
1. Open Locus Maps
2. Open the Points Menu and add a new point. 
3. Tap in the description field to edit it and Lockwise will pop up. 

### Expected behavior
Lockwise shouldn't be popping up when editing the description field in Locus Maps.

### Actual behavior
Lockwise's pop-up appears when the user attempts to edit the description field in Locus Maps, blocking the field and preventing the user from typing. 

### Device & build information
* Device: Android 9.0 on Xiaomi Mi A1
* Build version: 3.3.0
* Locus Maps version: 3.42

### Why/User Benefit/User Problem

It'd be ideal not to have to do a custom Lockwise build to test Sync changes against staging. If there were a flag/config pref/toggle somewhere that would let us either:

a) Point to staging only
OR
b) Set our own sync host (which would allow pointing to staging and [might be more flexible for self-hosters?](https://github.com/mozilla-lockwise/lockwise-android/issues/542)).

then we could make changes to Sync with more confidence that we can test them against staging before rolling to prod.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when Iâ€™m done?)

* We're able to point Lockwise to staging based Sync server in Fenix.

### Not included

* Fennec - I don't think it's needed right now since Fenix is close; probably not worth the effort.
Now there is a '+' button to manually add new logins. It would be nice to have UI Tests covering this new feature.

Although we would need issue #1087 fixed before these tests work
