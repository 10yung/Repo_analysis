> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Hi,

I'm currently trying to embed a jupyter notebook in my website but I am having problems getting the interactive part to work. Looking at the console, it seems the import of local packages which are in the same directory as the html and notebook in the mybinder source:

<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2019-11-13 at 11 13 37" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9167240/68759126-03696d00-0607-11ea-8539-b124e4279004.png">
This is the last error message:
<img width="482" alt="Screenshot 2019-11-13 at 11 13 43" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9167240/68759125-03696d00-0607-11ea-8eb0-6e4a309c90d2.png">

The repo from which I build the html is: github.com/nyxaria/olim
The binder source is: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nyxaria/olim/master?filepath=data-analysis%2Folim-model-analysis.ipynb

Do you think you could help me with this problem?

I created an altair chart with ipywidget. But the chart is not rendering as interactive. 
Hi i am having this error where when it gets to the html page i click on show widgets. i initialises for a bit and then an error shows up saying.
error try refreshing the page:<br>undefined

Help would be really appreciated.  Thanks.
Hello,
I've tried deploying ipyvolume via mybinder but the widgets are not visualized, with some js errors (see screenshot below).
Here are two pages, I've created, where bqplot works fine but not ipyvolume:
https://initmaks.github.io/testing_binder/Untitled.html
https://initmaks.github.io/testing_binder/trial2.html
<img width="664" alt="Screen Shot 2019-07-16 at 6 52 56 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9087436/61335291-faa09000-a7fa-11e9-8be2-edb344e94c94.png">
Is the ipyvolume supported by nbinteract? Any guidance on how to make it work would be appreciated.
Thanks
Please consider uploading the source distribution to PyPI instead of just wheels. PyPI is a canonical place for sdists and very few tools/third party python packagers (debian, fedora, etc) get the source from GitHub.
I think that the options provided in the default templates are great but for example I would like to create my own template, with custom title, a GA tracker code and without Bootstrap and I didn't want to alter the source files to do so but rather write my own template.
currently, the marker settings for each plot type is hard-coded in the function itself.

e.g. for `nbi.hist`, we see

```
params = {
        'marks': [{
            'sample': _array_or_placeholder(hist_function),
            'bins': _get_option('bins'),
            'normalized': _get_option('normalized'),
            'scales': (
                lambda opts: {'sample': opts['x_sc'], 'count': opts['y_sc']}
            ),
        }],
```

which is passed to `._create_marks`, then merged with default marks and finally rendered.

It would be nice to be able to control some aspects of the marks, most importantly colors in order to have better control over the rendering

e.g. in order to generate the color-coded stack bar chart in 


<img width=250 src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxwNz-mXQAAzKAf.jpg:large">

https://twitter.com/lukasheinrich_/status/1088760129070219266

I needed these params

```
params = {
        'marks': [{
            'x': _array_or_placeholder(x_fn, PLACEHOLDER_RANGE),
            'y': _array_or_placeholder(y_fn),
            'colors': bq.CATEGORY10,
            'stroke': '#000000'
        }]
    }
```

since you already have the utility functions to merge param specs (in create_marks) this seems not too difficult to add.
