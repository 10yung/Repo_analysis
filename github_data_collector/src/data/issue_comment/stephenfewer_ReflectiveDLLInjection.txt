keep having 

> [-] Failed to open the DLL file. Error=2

when execute exe file from the project ... 

please let us know how to get working exe...
Firefox on Windows hooks `kernel32!BaseThreadInitThunk` which prevents the remote thread to start in the target, see https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/mozglue/build/WindowsDllBlocklist.cpp#821:

```

KERNEL32!BaseThreadInitThunk:

```

This PR restores the function prologue if it is detected as indeed hooked - happy to fix / adapt anything you'd like.

Also took the extra liberty of fixing the indentation in `Rva2Offset` :).

Dear stephenfewer,

Hope you are well. I try to use this but i couldn't solve entire project. Could you please explain how to use this? How to inject a DLL?

Thanks.
When compiling a DLL which includes the ReflectiveDLLInjection project as one of its dependencies, Visual Studio 15.8.0 and later appear to make some alterations to the way the DLL compiles so that whilst it does end up compiling successfully still, any attempts to call the exported ReflectiveLoader function of the injected DLL will cause an access violation in the hosting process and will result in the process crashing. If the same code is compiled under Visual Studio 15.7.1, there are no issues.
If I compile my dll as Multithreaded (/MT) it crashes, though if I compile it was Multithreaded DLL (/MD) it doesn't crash. Any idea why and how to fix it?
I make use of a big library that uses try/catch to exception handle and my application crashes when the "throw" statement is called in the code.

How can I deal with this problem?

Thank you!
On Windows 7 x64, when i try to inject DLL into calc.exe process,
> tasklist
[...]
calc.exe                      6004 Console                    1    14Â 772 Ko
[...]
> inject.exe 6004
it's give me :
[-] Failed to inject the DLL. Error=5 (Access denied)
I tried with the x64 and Win32 configuration, and also with user/administrator rights, but same error.
Why it doesn't work ?
I am trying to update this loader. At first i'm trying get to work. And when i get to work i will try to get that with the name you can inject. For example in c++ will be:

```
HANDLE processList=CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0);
PROCESSENTRY32 pInfo;
BOOL st=TRUE;
pInfo.dwSize=sizeof(PROCESSENTRY32);
Process32First(processList, &pInfo);
int myPid=0;
do
{
	if(strcmp(pInfo.szExeFile, "test.exe")==0)
	{
		myPid=pInfo.th32ProcessID;
		break;
	}
	Process32Next(lista, &pInfo);
}
while(st!=FALSE);
```
So with the name you can inject into the process. reference:

this feature can be added in your project.
Changed the initial remote process allocation type to RW instead of RWX and added a VirtualProtectEx() call to change it to RX once it has been re-written. This will bypass any W^X memory protections.

added CloseHandle to close the handle opened to read the dll file.
