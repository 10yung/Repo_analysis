I wanted to implement the regularizer modules available in Sonnet 2, but this seems to be built on top of Tensorflow 2. 
Does the current version of graph_nets supports Sonnet 2?. 
thanks 
Mara

Hi,

It would be great if  Graphnet people can comment on the new Tensorflow  Neural-Structured-Learning project (https://github.com/tensorflow/neural-structured-learning). 

Would be helpful for future direction decisions in our projects.

Thanks
Hi,
I am training faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.
I have the following configuration in conda env:
tensorflow: 1.13.1
python 3.6.9
cuda 10.0
I am training on HPC.
 when I run model_main.py, I get the following error, but training is still progressing, but it is too slow.
Any suggestions on solving the issue are much welcome.

The paper is great. But I wanted to ask if there is any plan to develop this project? 
If I wanted to learn a graph framework, should I invest time to learn this or others like https://github.com/dmlc/dgl ? last commit was 4 months ago. 

The PR includes two fixes:

1. Update incorrect links to documentation for `utils_np.data_dicts_to_graphs_tuple` in the "How to represent graphs as a graphs.GraphsTuple" section and the other for `utils_tf.data_dicts_to_graph_tuple` in the "Creating a constant tensor GraphsTuple from data dicts" section of the notebook.

2. The final cell, "Block Compositionality" calls the attribute `graph_network.variables` which throws an `AttributeError` and is replaced with the `get_variables()` method. I'm not sure if the goal is to just print the name and shape of the `tf.Variable`s here but that is what it currently does.
after training model with `Networkx `geo random graphs, now I want to test my model with real data. I created a graph from that real data. Now I don't know I must add `solution feature and other features` to my graph nodes or no?  because in shortest path example, testing and training both use same method `create_feed_dict`
I removed a misleading index [-1] from the documentation in: `utils_np`, `utils_tf` and the doc itself.
The docstring now reflects what fields of the networkx graph are used to build the GraphsTuple structures.

I could also add a minimal example of creating a graph with networkx and converting it into a GraphsTuple, just tell me where to add it.
This PR proposes the addition of Dockerfiles to create an option for consistent demo and dev builds. Reduce the risk of users mixing up dependencies - and provide access to Graph Nets demos with a single command. 

Ex: Running demos image with default Dockerfile CMD (as below) will run Jupyter on port 8888 with `--notebook-dir` pointed at an ephemeral `demos/` directory.

```bash
# Run demos image (GPU)
docker run --runtime=nvidia -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -p 8888:8888 -it imburbank/graph_nets:latest-gpu-demos

# Paste Jupyter serving address from console into browser and get started
```

Images use the official Tensorflow CPU and GPU [images](https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/ 'Tensorflow Docker Hub') as a base and add Graph Nets dependencies. 

I currently have four images hosted [on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/imburbank/graph_nets/ 'Graph Nets Docker Hub'):

- CPU image available as `imburbank/graph_nets`
- GPU image available as `imburbank/graph_nets:latest-gpu`
- CPU-demo image available as `imburbank/graph_nets:latest-demos`
- GPU-demo image available as `imburbank/graph_nets:latest-gpu-demos`

I also believe that these Docker Hub images would be more appropriately hosted under your `deepmind` or `graph_nets` Docker Hub username. I could update the readme instructions to pull from, for example, `deepmind/graph_nets:latest-gpu`.

The current Docker Hub Automated Build Settings are pretty simple. Here's a screenshot that covers the bulk of it.

I would, of course, be happy to assist with any image hosting setup.

Please see dockerfiles/README.md for additional use details.
