In the release 2017-02-19f "Frusterick Manners" the dates were displayed correctly in RSS feeds, but after updating to 2018-04-22b "Greebo" there are errors:
Types ATOM 0.3, ATOM 1, RSS 1 always show 01.01.2020 date for feeds.
Types RSS 0.9 and RSS 2 show wrong feed time (add time zone).

For ATOM 0.3, ATOM 1, RSS 1 "Greebo" show time as `2020-01-15T10:17:14+0300`, "Frusterick Manners" showed `2020-01-15T10:17:14+03:00`
For RSS 0.9 and RSS 2 "Greebo" show time as `Wed, 15 Jan 2020 10:17:14 +0000`, "Frusterick Manners" showed `Wed, 15 Jan 2020 10:17:14 +0300`

Apparently everything is in the iso8601 and rfc822 functions in the file /vendor/openpsa/universalfeedcreator/lib/Element/FeedDate.php.
In "Frusterick Manners" these functions were in /inc/feedcreator.class.php and looked a bit different. I returned them as before:
```

After that, the errors disappeared, but there is a feeling that this one is still wrong, because the time zone can be not only a plus, but also a minus.

#2358 brought many improvements to the DokuWiki code base, but unfortunately, we also broke backward compatibility in some places where we didn't intend it.

This PR should restore that backward compatibility for `Doku_Parser` and a bit how `Doku_Handler` is used by the parser. In particular, I hope that this PR makes the move plugin work again, see michitux/dokuwiki-plugin-move#176

It also adds another method to the Debug class. I'm not sure if that is the best way to do it and would appreciate feedback or thoughts (poke @splitbrain, @phy25  and others ðŸ™‚ )

Future remark: we are going to want to extract the `Doku_Handler` class into a new one that follows PSR-12. That was overlooked in the original PR.

Trying to setup DokuWiki on a fresh Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS 64-bit install.

**Setup-method:** apt
**Webserver:** apache2
**php-versoin:** 7.2.24

After installing I tried to run `localhost/dokuwiki/install.php` - there was a long error list (missing write-permissions on 10+ folders and files). 
Following this guide (https://www.dokuwiki.org/install:ubuntu), all but one error disappears.

**Remaining error:** 

`/usr/share/dokuwiki/conf/ is not writable by DokuWiki. You need to fix the permission settings of this directory!`

_**Consulting both /var/lib/dokuwiki/data/ and /usr/share/dokuwiki/ it results that the conf-directory has not been created at all during installation.**_ 
The installation (apt) did not report any errors.

**Tried fixes (negative):**
- manually create conf-directory and changing ownership to `www-data:www-data`
- `chmod -R 0777` on ../dokuwiki directory (desperate, I know)
- clear cache in browser

It is not a strange thing that an admin would try to set up DokuWiki on an Ubuntu Server. This should really work out of the box. Can we please fix this? <3


Working in progress with issue #2880, 
  * idx_* functions in inc/indexer.php are encapsulated into singleton Indexer class (former Doku_Indexer)
  * all static functions in inc/fulltext.php are encapsulated into FulltextSearch class 
  * two methods in FulltextSearch (backlinks and mediause), those lookup metadata index and not related to full-text search, are separated into MetaSearch class
  * introduce new namespace "dokuwiki\Search", into which Indexer, FulltextSearch and MetaSearch classes are moved.

For the moment, all public functions in fulltext and indexer are modified to use relevant class methods in Search namespace and marked as "deprecated", but left for compatibility. I am sticking to change only fulltext.php and indexer.php files in this work. Further development must be needed.

I hope that I understand the issue #2880 correctly, but I wonder these changes could get in goods with core development teams members?

Here are some points to consider prior to go further developments: 
1. `MetaSearch::mediause()`, former `ft_mediause()`, could be defined in inc/media.php file as `getUsedMedia()` ?
2. `MetaSearch::backlinks()`, former `ft_backlinks()`, could be defined in inc/common.php file as `getBacklinks()` ?
3. If above two method can be moved to different places, class MetaSearch can be removed. Then, The class name "FulltextSearch" can be renamed to "Search".
4. New namespace "Fulltext" might be better that contains Indexer and (Fulltext)Search classes?
5. global constant `FT_SNIPPET_NUMBER` : where should be defined after when inc/fulltext.php file will be removed?
7. Should we use namespace constants `INDEXER_VERSION` and `IDX_MINWORDLENGTH` instead of global constatnts?
 

Use the name of the current namespace for template value @page@ instead of "start" when creating the namespaces' startpage.
I was looking through the dokuwiki/inc/cache.php and noticed that the function io_saveFile is called on line 122 with io_savefile ( no capital F ). Also on line 335,. Also in the comment line 391 in file inc/io.php .
Maybe it is right. It looks odd to me.
Thanks for Dokuwiki :-)
