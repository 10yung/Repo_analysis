- auto updated the project settings
- resolved warning for deprecated font method
- resolved warning of block usage (same as https://github.com/Jawbone/JBChartView/pull/234)
  
No changes to my code, but after XCode update the bar chart behaves strangely.

PRIOR to Update
- Bar chart loaded with one week's worth of data on viewDidLoad. 

AFTER Update
- Bar chart loads one week minus a day (six bars instead of 7)
- Bars are invisible, touching on chart does not show white highlight but does register touch and drag (I have labels updating with data points, similar to your demo app on weather).
- Switching to month and back to week via a segmented controller on my VC correctly loads bars and 7 days of data, all views are visible.

reloadData() is called at launch, and all delegate methods are returning correct values (numberOfBars returns 7, heightForBar returns data for the "missing" 7th day), but still there only 6 invisible bars in the chartView.

Thanks for good library. I am using this in my swift project. But, I added this bar chart view to my tableview cell to display in tableview cell. But, while calling chartBar.reloadData(), its getting crashed and graph not displaying, can you help me to fix this?

Thanks
We are working with swift project, can you please provide swift version of this library?
Bug Reappear Steps:
1. Change data source .
2. Use reloadDataAnimated:YES to update line.
3. Use screen edge pan gesture pop to previous view controller.
4. Bug appeared!  The chart view will presenting previous line.
When calling `reloadData()` I can see that `lineChartView:lineStyleForLineAtLineIndex:` is called, but it is not changing the lines in the chart view. It will still have the same patterns as before the reload.
Version: 3.0.13
File: JBLineChartDotsView.m
When animating a second line (at least).

In line of 74, this code returns a NSNull object.
    __block UIView *dotView = [mutableReusableDotViews jb_pop];

Then in this line (76), it crashes because NSNull does not have a .center, obviously :)

   dotView.center = CGPointMake(lineChartPoint.position.x, lineChartPoint.position.y); // animate move

Thanks in advance.
Marce.
