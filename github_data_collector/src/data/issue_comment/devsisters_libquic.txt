It seems `aes_test.cc` has a warning, and because of `-Werror`, compilation fails.

Hello,
Do you know about [Conan](https://github.com/conan-io/conan)?
[Conan](http://docs.conan.io/en/latest/) is modern dependency manager for C++. And will be great if your library will be available via package manager for other developers.

[Here](https://github.com/bincrafters/conan-templates) you can find example, how you can create package for the library. 

If you have any questions, just ask :-)
here's the log:

the newer quic has implemented BBR congestion control
would you like to merge the newer quic implementation into libquic?

Restore header + fix CPP header selection logic.

Not possible to build on OSX without this as the path to Go is user-dependent (e.g. installed via brew in not /usr/local/bin).  Inherit those paths from command-line/higher-level build system if available.

So basically, if i'm some programmer who wants to screw around with making an existing c++ server application use quic, Where do i start?

What I see here are some random files with no documentation on usage inside some c++ application.

Am I missing something?

How about port Google quic_simple_server and client?

GNU libc 2.24 (published 2016-08-04) deprecated `readdir_r`, see the [announcement email](https://lwn.net/Articles/696469/):

> - The readdir_r and readdir64_r functions have been deprecated.  It is
>   recommended to use readdir and readdir64 instead.

This causes the build to fail:
