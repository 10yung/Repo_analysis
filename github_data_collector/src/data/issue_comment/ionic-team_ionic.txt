# Bug Report

**Ionic version:**
[x] **4.11.8**

**Current behavior & Steps to reproduce :**
I've cloned the following project https://github.com/ionic-team/photo-gallery-capacitor-react as described in the tutorial https://ionicframework.com/docs/react/your-first-app/6-deploying-mobile

> git clone https://github.com/ionic-team/photo-gallery-capacitor-react.git
> npm install
> ionic cap open android

(I've also tested 
> rm -rf android 
> ionic cap add android
> ionic cap open android with the same result)

Android studio opens, but an error appears on the build tab in android sync failed > Run Build > Configure Build : 

![Capture d’écran 2020-01-18 à 19 16 26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4128473/72668436-2eb57180-3a27-11ea-928b-1842927849d4.png)

The graddle file in /private/var/folders/y9/t_0m49hs1f7_wlh_tn0wnm5h0000gp/T/sync.java.lib.gradle:7 is the following : 

```
initscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath files(['/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/plugins/android/lib/sdk-tools.jar', '/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/plugins/android/lib/sdk-tools.jar', '/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/lib/kotlin-stdlib-1.3.50.jar'])
    }
}
allprojects {
    apply plugin: com.android.java.model.builder.JavaLibraryPlugin
}
```

I would expect the breaking line to be, instead (but I'm not an expert in Graddle so I might be entirely wrong) : 

`apply plugin: 'com.android.java.model.builder.JavaLibraryPlugin'`


**Expected behavior:**
I would expect the project to be able to build, produce a SDK... 


**Other information:**
Whether it's a bug with Ionic or an issue with my Android Studio installation / configuration, I think it would be helpful to describe/give a reference on how to make a clean/standard installation of Android Studio in the tutorial.

I also add that I am able to build and emulate a native application from an Android Studio template.

# Bug Report

**Ionic version:**
[x] **4.x**

**Current behavior:**
When running the app on iOS 13 devices (tested on iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone SE) with `statusBar.styleDefault()` the status bar has white text color.

![IMG_1421](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27491471/72664445-488e8e80-39fe-11ea-9222-28dbdea121f8.jpg)

**Note:** It works well on simulators and devices with iOS <= 12

**Expected behavior:**
When settings StatusBar style to default text should be dark (for apps with light background)

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Create new app via Ionic CLI: `ionic start ionic-test sidemenu`

The context property allows autoScroll in reorder-group, even if it was created inside a small div (a div that has a limited height, maybe with a styled scrollbar - run "reorder-group context test" to see a use case).
Now, you can just add: context="{divID}", which does all the work for you!
You are welcome to change the property name to a better one :)

An example of a use case:
On the left, there is a 'div' that contains an 'IonReorderGroup'.
Because the list is long, the 'div' has a styled scrollbar.
However, when I dragged an item, there was no autoScroll, so there were glitches.
Now, with the 'context' property, this problem can be easily solved.

# Feature Request

**Ionic version:**
[x] **4.x**

**Describe the Feature Request**

It would be helpful if the `SelectChangeEventDetail` interface would be generic, so that the type of the `value` property can be typed.

**Describe Preferred Solution**

```ts
interface SelectChangeEventDetail<T = any> {
  value: T;
  // ...
}
```

```tsx
const onSelectValueChange = (e: CustomEvent<SelectChangeEventDetail<number[]>>) => 
  foo(e.detail.value); // <-- this is a number array now, instead of `any`

<ion-select onIonChange={onSelectValueChange} />
```

**Describe Alternatives**

🤷🏻‍♂️

**Additional Context**

I'm not actually aware what types of values the `<ion-select-option>` can be used with, but it definitely works with strings and numbers (and arrays of either if `multiple` is set).

**Edit:** According to the docs you can even have [objects as values](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/select#objects-as-values) (nice!) which means this generic interface would be really helpful. I can make a PR once you agree that this is a good idea!

<!-- (For Ionic 2.x & 3.x issues, please use https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-v3) -->
[x] **4.11.8** (latest)

**Current behavior:**
When trying to navigate between two pages from different `IonRouterOutlets` UI is flickering and breaks, as non active outlet is on the top of others, making all visible UI elements unreachable.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4648983/72596964-74821500-3915-11ea-8db7-dfbc1c2e7020.gif" width="250">


**Expected behavior:**
Navigation between two pages from different nested `IonRouterOutlet`'s should be possible. Router outlets shouldn't overlap each other, correctly determining which of them is active now (on the top of others).

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4648983/72597460-844e2900-3916-11ea-900b-9ca4f41c42e1.gif" width="250">

**Steps to reproduce:**
<!--  Please explain the steps required to duplicate the issue, especially if you are able to provide a sample application. -->
Basically, what I'm trying to do is navigation between two pages `Home` (`/home`) and List (`/list`), both of them are inside global `IonRouterOutlet`, and both have inner `IonRouterOutet` for their own nested routes, as described in [Docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/react/navigation#nested-routes). And here is a deal: I want to navigate directly from nested route of `Home` (e.g. `/home/welcome`) to the nested route of the `List`  (e.g. `/list/:id`) with correct page transition. And it even works... but only for the first time. Then there are 3 different outlets in DOM overlapping each other, two with `z-index: 0` (one of them is needed),  and another (incorrect) with `z-index:101`, so UI is blocked with transparent alien outlet.

❗️ Looks like this is strictly related to #18197, #18823, #18845 (all of those Angular issues have been opened since last summer). 
The quick workaround for me here was moving `List`'s nested routes into parent `IonRouterOutlet`:

```tsx
<IonApp>
  <IonReactRouter>
      <IonRouterOutlet>
        {/*<Route path="/list" component={ListPage}/>*/}
        <Route path="/list" component={List} exact={true}/>
        <Route path="/list/:id" component={Item}/>
        <Route path="/home" component={HomePage}/>
        <Route path="/" render={() => <Redirect to="/home"/> } exact={true} />
      </IonRouterOutlet>
  </IonReactRouter>
</IonApp>
```
https://gist.github.com/alekseykarpenko/6e5c71f915cf53eeee896e24ab1ee562/7af928cff5ee6a6553d4fa899d22f5874cc9cb42

But that's not a real gold bullet, I want it back 😢 Actually, I have two reasons for that: 1) Use all power of React Router nested routes; and 2) Place `Home` inside Tabs View while `List` will not be there and add Side Menu to both of them within the global `IonRouterOutlet`. 

**Thoughts on fixing this**
Even while both pages are in different nested outlets, they have same global outlet. Looks like navigation goes in right way, but outlet controller can't determine current active outlet, giving incorrect `z-index`.

# Feature Request

**Ionic version:** 5.4.13
**@ionic/react version:** 4.11.8
<!-- (For Ionic 1.x issues, please use https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-v1) -->
<!-- (For Ionic 2.x & 3.x issues, please use https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-v3) -->

**Describe the Feature Request**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the feature request is. Please include if your feature request is related to a problem. -->
I'm using Ionic React, and I want to create an 'IonReorderGroup' inside a 'div' that has a scrollbar.
However, as I saw in Ionic's core code, the 'autoScroll' function works only with the 'IonContent' that wraps the Group.
Therefore, I want the 'IonReorderGroup' tag to have an optional prop (called 'context', for instance). 
In the 'context' prop I will be able to pass the ref of the 'div' element (or the div's id), and then the autoScroll function will affect the div's scrollbar when I drag an element.

**Related Code**
<!-- If you are able to illustrate the feature request with an example, please provide a sample application via an online code collaborator such as [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com), or [GitHub](https://github.com). -->
Solving this problem is pretty easy. All it requires is to add the 'context' property, then changing the following lines in the path:
> node_modules\@ionic\core\dist\collection\components\reorder-group\reorder-group.js
```
const contentEl = this.el.closest('ion-content');
```
Will become
```
var contentEl;
if (this.context !== null) contentEl = this.context;
else contentEl = this.el.closest("ion-content");
```
Or Something similar...

**Additional Context**
<!-- List any other information that is relevant to your issue. Stack traces, related issues, suggestions on how to add, use case, Stack Overflow links, forum links, screenshots, OS if applicable, etc. -->
An example of a use case:
On the left, there is a 'div' that contains an 'IonReorderGroup'.
Because the list is long, the 'div' has a styled scrollbar.
However, when I drag an item, there is no autoScroll, so there are glitches.
With a 'context' property, such as `context={divElement}` or `context="divID"` this problem can be easily solved.
