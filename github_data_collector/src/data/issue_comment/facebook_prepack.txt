I don't see any active development going on here. Is this dead-ended project? Can it be ever be useful for production use?

*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Release notes: Adjacent JOIN_GENERATORS with EQUIVALENT path conditions are now merged for optimization.

This pull request is a generalization of https://github.com/facebook/prepack/pull/2623 as suggested by @hermanventer.

Extra:
- Lint issues caused by a recent prettier version update are now fixed;
- `flow-bin` has been re-added to devDependencies as it was causing scripts that depend on Flow to fail during development.
Made the license section point to the respective file.
node-zip has useful cli but in this case, it makes sense to use jszip directly. I did not use v3 version on jszip because it is only exposing async interface and v2 would hoist better with zip-dir.
https://github.com/daraosn/node-zip/blob/master/lib/nodezip.js

I also needed to run yarn upgrade to properly de-duplicate jszip. 

Updated the `wepack-cli` and `webpack` to new version
In `webpack.config.js` added splitChunk and uglify plugin for optimizer.

```

I'm dealing with [code.org's AppLab](https://code.org/educate/applab) for one of my projects. I'm using Scala and [compiling to Scala.JS](https://gist.github.com/sorenbug/7267c37a4e1e736a585364f4e2c7890d).

This Scala registers event handlers to AppLab's `onEvent` function but prepack is recognizing it as dead code.

How do I properly handle/configure this case? (There are other functions that mutate external state as well, like `button`, `setPosition`, `setText` that I use in my code, but I handle these with the function described in #619)
