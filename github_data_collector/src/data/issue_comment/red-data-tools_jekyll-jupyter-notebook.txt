Hi Mr. Sutou,

Thanks for the update. I still got the same error message. Please take a look at my repo at https://github.com/joyride2017/econ. I used the same .md and .ipynb as in your example. I am sure that I have updated jupyter notebook plugin from 0.0.1 to 0.0.2 by commanding "bundle update."  After trying to watch my local changes by commanding "bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl," I got this message:

>Configuration file: E:/sandbox/_config.yml
>             Source: E:/sandbox
>        Destination: E:/sandbox/_site
>  Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
>       Generating...
>   Liquid Exception: no implicit conversion of nil into String in E:/sandbox/_posts/2017-09-03-blog.md
> jekyll 3.5.2 | Error:  no implicit conversion of nil into String

And on my GitHub Pages, I found a relevant error message: 

> Your site is having problems building: The tag jupyter_notebook on line 6 in _posts/2017-09-03-blog.md is not a recognized Liquid tag. For more information, see https://help.github.com/articles/page-build-failed-unknown-tag-error/.

Thanks for the help. I am looking forward to your solution.

Hi!
