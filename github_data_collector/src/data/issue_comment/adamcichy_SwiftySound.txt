Can you do this?
Hi, great library!

Is it possible to queue multiple sound files, else it would be a great feature.

/cheers
Its great we've exposed capturing duration of played file.  Can we pass duration back to the file before playing it to restart playing from an supplied duration?  
This is more of a feature request:  

Would it be possible to add a fade out option with a parameter for how long the fade out should be when calling the stopall function? 

The use cases would be when using the loop function for multiple playing files you may want to fade out those sounds instead of stopping them at once. 
Would it be possible to include an elapsed time in this library, so even if the sound is being looped you can see how long it has been playing for?
