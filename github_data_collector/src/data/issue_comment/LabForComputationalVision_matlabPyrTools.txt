I have seen it shipped along with the Makefiles under MEX. It is much easier to simply do `make` than manually compiling a dozens of c files.
In reconSpyr.m, line 94, the original code was:
res = upConv( subMtx(pyr, pind(1,:)), hi0filt, edges, [1 1], [1 1], size(res), res);

And it seems the result matrix will not be returned when res is passed to this function, just as mentioned in the 'help' instruction. After I changed this line to:
upConv( subMtx(pyr, pind(1,:)), hi0filt, edges, [1 1], [1 1], size(res), res);

The problem is solved.

A similar issue is seen in reconSpyrLevs.m, line 41.
When I checked binom3 the l2-norm was < 0.9, the documentation stated it should be 1.0, what is the significance of having l2-norm = 1.0?
