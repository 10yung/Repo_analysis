Hi.
I just downloaded the zip from Github and, as indicated in the Readme, after conf reviewing, I launched:
sbt runAll

Error Result :
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: com.typesafe.sbteclipse.core.EclipsePlugin$.EclipseKeys()Lcom/typesafe/sbteclipse/core/EclipsePlugin$EclipseKeys$;

have you a workaround ?
Thanks for any help
First off, thank you! I've been looking into microservices with scala, and trying to find a nice solution for authentication and this looks like a fantastic start. The tutorial is really detailed and well structured - great stuff!

I was wondering if you have any plans on adding sample usage examples, tests, or even a simple frontend app to showcase the underlying services? This would be a huge help in better understanding and testing the system as a whole. I saw there's an open pull request that looks related [here](https://github.com/theiterators/reactive-microservices/pull/7).

WIP pull request for frontend and build preparation
