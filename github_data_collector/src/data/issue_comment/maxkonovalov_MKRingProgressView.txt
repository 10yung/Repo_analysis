I have an app that uses MKRingProgressView (Loop diabetes app), and I want to get familiar with making changes to the code - and figure MKRingProgressView is a "easy" place to start.  Is there a way to recompile only the framework cod without xCode's "delete-then-reinstall" for the entire app?

Or at least without disrupting whatever resident information the app has left on iOS, actually.  I'm currently using the app, and if I delete it, it clears out the address information of the current insulin pod (Omnipod) is linked.

(This might not be the right forum to ask this)
I currently have the progress view in a table view cell. The progress value sets correctly, but there is no animation, despite using UIView.animate. Other animations work fine. It seems that upon reloading the cell, animation works correctly.
Error: this application, or a library it uses, has passed an invalid numeric value (NaN, or not-a-number) to CoreGraphics API and this value is being ignored. Please fix this problem.
I notice rings 'blinking' when I put them in collection view.

When I reload data, cells are reused and updated with the new progress. However, I can see  that the ring is presenting the old values and its progress is updated after few miliseconds.

I'm still debuging this but it seems to be connected with MKRingProgressLayer trying to animate the progress even though it's not in a UIView.animate { ... }.
Is there a future release planned with OSX Support?
This is the line that crash:-

let ctx = CGContext(data: &data, width: w, height: h, bitsPerComponent: bitsPerComponent, bytesPerRow: w * bytesPerPixel, space: colorSpace, bitmapInfo: bitmapInfo.rawValue)!
I'm trying to use the example application with the Xcode 9 and iOS 11 GMs here, and seeing significant performance differences between the two.

On my mid-2014 15-inch MacBook Pro, the example app absolutely flies, working perfectly, pretty much. Meanwhile, on my 6s Plus, it's dropping frames left, right, and centre. I tried messing with the usual suspects (clear memory, low power mode, etc.) but device just keeps dropping frames.

I know there's a performance difference between simulator and device, but it usually tends to be in the device's favour, especially with graphics stuff. There's also an OpenGL simulator bug in the GM, which might be at play here: https://twitter.com/xenadu02/status/911463433521860609

Any ideas for increasing on device performance? I tried but can't seem to find any way to toggle CPU-based rendering like with CIContext, for example.

Thanks
I am using this ring progress view inside a collection view.
When i start scrolling the collection view and the collection view creates another cell, it is not smooth.
I used instruments to see what could be the problem and i noticed that the heaviest function was the method **contentImage** in the MKRingProgressView class.

Can you please try to see if is there any way to improve performance?
Thank you
