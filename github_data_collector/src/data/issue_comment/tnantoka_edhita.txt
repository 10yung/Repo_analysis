Can you add some basic instructions to Readme?  Thanks.
This would make specific pieces of code easier to find in my case
Hello,

Im using edhita for taking notes about software projects and building wiki pages for documentation.
But sometimes i need to take some private notes. 
I wonder if you guys can add some password protection for files or fingerprint protection like Notes.app that would be great. 

Thank you.
Great work.

How can I see Browser console?
would it be possible to add a way to use emmet in this app?
If I'm editing anything other than HTML, I don't want to see the Browser or Dual views. The display options should not be present when editing other files. Ideally (though a bit more difficult to implement) the settings could contain an option to add custom filename extensions to trigger the display options, i.e. .erb or .hbs. 

This is a feature request.  I just installed edhita and would like to use it edit the markdown files in my clould app.  It would be great if edhita can expose such a service.

I want to develop a git plugin, anyone like it ?

GitHub shows Edhita as being almost 30% CSS. I've replaced the Bootstrap example with a basic example, removing all but one 3-line CSS file.
