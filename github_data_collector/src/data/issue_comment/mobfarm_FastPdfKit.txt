maahi
I noticed someone saying this was going to be discontinued, but I still see commit activity for the repo just trying to figure out the status of the library
isSearchTermValid can run a series of validations on the search term before searching.
Currently only validating against searching single or multiple blank spaces.
This prevents against an app crash. #82

I came across with one particular pdf from which your library cannot extract the Chinese characters therein at all. 
The file is publicly available at [世界人權宣言](http://www.nacs.gov.tw/NcsiWebFileDocuments/c63c067789be929232520eaba96ed640.pdf), your help is much appreciated!
Hi, first of all thanks for this great library, we are using it for quite a long time and it is very useful to us.

Unfortunately we have a problem `wholeTextForPage` method. When we try to search for text application crashes in `-[MFToUnicodeCMapScannerMultibyte scan]` due to `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` issue. This crash occurs on iOS 10.2 (any other iOS versions parsing is successful). Document is in Korean language. 

```
#1	0x0000000100109848 in -[MFToUnicodeCMapScannerMultibyte scan]
#2	0x00000001001039d9 in parseToUnicodeCMapStreamMultibyte
#3	0x000000010010484d in sniffType0Font
#4	0x00000001001058ef in fontDictionarySnifferFunction
#5	0x00000001014b4233 in CGPDFDictionaryApplyFunction ()
#6	0x0000000100105a8e in -[MFStreamScanner scan]
#7	0x0000000100110d14 in -[MFDocumentManager wholeTextForPage:]
```

Is there any way to fix it using current version of library, or to provide any hotfix so that we can successfully use it under latest iOS?

If needed I can provide a test pdf which is failing, but please provide an email address or any other option share this file securely, as it's not something I can share to anyone. 
Any help appreaciated. 
The FastPDFKit library is always crash when I search a text with a keyword only include white space.
This can be confirmed with sample application bundled with the library.
