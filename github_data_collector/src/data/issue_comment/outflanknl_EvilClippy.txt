I've created a new document, added macro vba from msfvenom, and attempted both of the commands below.

No errors from the commands, but in both cases, the msfvenom macro is still visible in both docs.

Any suggestions?

  EvilClippy.exe -g doc32.doc
  Hiding module: NewMacros

 EvilClippy.exe -s fake.vbs -g -r doc32f.doc
 Hiding module: NewMacros
 Now stomping VBA code in module: ThisDocument
 Now stomping VBA code in module: NewMacros
 Setting random ASCII names for VBA modules in dir stream (while leaving unicode names intact).


I am trying to stomp the macro code to target 32 bit Office 2016 on a Windows 10 64 bit machine. 
When I stomp, I use the command -t 2016x86. 
My test VM gives me the error "Sub or function not defined", despite the install being the correct target. 
I hope you can shed some light on this, let me know if I can provide anything. 

EDIT: I think i've figured this out. If you create a document in 64-bit version of word, and then stomp with -t 2016x86, it will give you the error message. You need to create the document with 32 bit version of Word in order to stomp targeting 32 bit. It might be helpful to document this somewhere so other people don't make the same mistake I did. 

Thanks for the great tool!
