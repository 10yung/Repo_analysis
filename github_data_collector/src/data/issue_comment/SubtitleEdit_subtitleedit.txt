Hi,
If I put the cursor inside the textarea and DON'T highligt anything, then right-click and select "cursive" or "bold" I get an error message.
Error Message: (translating from swedish so it might not be the exact words....)
Index outside the intervall. It may not be negative and must be less than the size of.... "mÃ¤ngden"
Name of parameter: index.
-----------
I know it's stupid to select cursive whithout selecting any text but I would expect that the application just to "ignore" it or give me an "You must select text to make it cursive/bold ... whatever"
--------------
Windows 10
Subtitle Edit 3.5.11.322
Can repeat it every time. 
It does NOT happen if I don't put the cursor in the textfield first.

Cheers
This has happened to me on multiple occasions, so I thought to make a thread.
When I extract subtitles, specially for scene UK, some of them are out of sync. If you play the video and use the embedded subtitles, it plays fine, but once you extract them, they're outta sync.

Eg: https://dropapk.to/0etsfhnz590p/Would.I.Lie.to.You.S13E06.iP.WEB-DL.x264-Scene-RLS.mp4.html

When extracted, subtitles are outta sync. I used CCExtractor to extract and it worked fine, but with that files loses all of the color tags.

3.5.11 Beta 258
I use the batch conversion of multiple SUP files to SRT. This works superb. But as I know from manual conversion sometimes the engine finds some unknown words and some of them are interpreted wrong. In the manual conversion you can see the words in a list. By using the batch tool I like to have these words as a log file. It could be written to the same folder where the SRT is written to and it should contain the word(s) and timestamp(s) to be able to find the position in the SRT file.
When having a second window open in Subtitle Edit (for example when translating with Google) and i want to minimize Subtitle Edit it will only do as Windows did back in the old time when we used Windows 3.1 (yes, it was a great time ðŸ˜ƒ ). Minimizing is great when something takes time to do, so that is the reason i want to minimizing Subtitle Edit.

It would be nice if it could minimize to the toolbar and even nicer if it could minimize to the systray (notification bar).

In this picture you can see what happening if i minimize the
`Translate with Google screen-scraping...`

It would be nice if there is a feature that could set the "Save As" default directory be the same as the source file or to a custom directory.
We better get version 3.5.12 out soon :)

After 10 years on my to-do list, SE can now read teletext from .ts files:

( thx VS code for the suggestion to debug https://github.com/debackerl/telxcc )

Auto br of lines is now much more configurable

I recently upgraded my main installation from 3.5.3 to 3.5.11 to make use of all the new features.

I noticed that something with the subtitle preview text has changed somewhere in between those versions: the preview text now uses "inclusive timings".

What this means:
When the out cue of a subtitle is e.g. 00:00:03,000 and the video position is exactly 00:00:03,000 (by using the shortcuts for 1 frame backwards/forwards), the subtitle is still visible, while it's supposed to be hidden, since the SubRip timings are exclusive. So out cue = 00:00:03,000 = subtitle gone at 00:00:03,000.
While I don't know if this is the original specification, most players (VLC/MPC) do work like this. (I'm sycing to shot cuts and the resulting .srt doesn't overshoot subtitles by 1 frame).

I'm using mpv, and "mpv handles preview text" is off.
When I turn it on, the subtitle is not visible when on the out cue, i.e. it's using "exclusive timings".
The other players don't work properly on my pc, so I couldn't test if it's isolated to mpv.

3.5.3 did use "exclusive timings", so I think something has changed along the way.


Despite reasons why some of these aren't there, some may benefit from them.
Close File, not just Exit, in the menu File.
Assigned keys for Changed speed (percent).
Changed speed (percent) in the batch converter.
This is the usual read speed of Subtitle Edit:

And this is the usual speed if I download a file from the same location:

Because of that I download the file first and then open it locally. Funnily this is much faster.
