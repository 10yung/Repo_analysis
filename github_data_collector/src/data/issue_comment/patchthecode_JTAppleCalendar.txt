In JTAppleCalendar, How we set the date wise events and how to fetch that events?
Using latest build, 8.0.2, and having an error where certain months will not pull the indate properly.
This happens consistently when scrolling back from January 2020 to December 2019.  If I continue to scroll back months, November and October load the indates normally, and then September 2019 has a nil indate as well.
There seems to be no problem with outdates or when scrolling into future months.  

I was using the indates to pull data from my database so my app crashes once I scroll back into those months.

Any suggestions or other data I can add to help investigate?


My didScrollToDateSegment function:

    func calendar(_ calendar: JTACMonthView, didScrollToDateSegmentWith visibleDates: DateSegmentInfo) {
        setupViewsOfCalendar(from: visibleDates)

        guard activeMonth != currentMonth else {
            print("current month, no need to check for scroll dates update")
            monthLabel.text = monthLabelText + ": " + countMonthTotals(appointments: monthAppt)
            return
        }
        
        print("scrolled indate = \(visibleDates.indates.first?.date)").  //sometimes this results in nil
        print("scrolled outdate = \(visibleDates.outdates.last?.date)")
      
       ...other things done with calendar
        }


**(Required) Version Number:** 8.0.2

I have a vertical calendar view with 1 year range. I want it to start at the current month, which is last month in the range. To do this, I call `scrollToSegment(.end, animateScroll: false)` on my `JTACMonthView`. I do this in view controller's `viewDidLoad()`. The method works, but it scrolls to the end with the (very fast) animation. I looked into the `scrollToSegment` method and I noticed that it calls `scrollToHeaderInSection` but it doesn't pass `animateScroll` param to it. `scrollToHeaderInSection`'s animation param defaults to true, so it always animated, no matter what I send to `scrollToSegment`. When I update the method to pass the param to `scrollToHeaderInSection`, the calendar shows current month without animation.

       // Erroring on the visible dates method and not event getting here.
            self.setupViewsOfCalendar(from: visibleDates)
        }

Collection view is of type JTACMonthView 


## Expected Behavior

## Description
i use JTACMonthView to show only one month calendar, when i change the month date, i cannot find the way to fetch it's contentSize.  So, i try to use numberOfItems(inSection:) to get the item numbers, then calculate it's height, it works. but i wonder if there is an convenient way to get it's contentSize
I'm implementing headers separately from the calendar, and the label which displays the month should change when calendar is scrolled. How do I get the current month when scrolling the calendar?

Version number: 8.0.0.
