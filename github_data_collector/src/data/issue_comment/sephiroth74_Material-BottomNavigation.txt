Is this library compatible with the jetpack navigation component ?
When I click a menu item the fragment doesn't shift, it remains the same as before.. the swipe feature is working fine (in viewpager). How do I solve this

I saw this guide in the wiki: https://github.com/sephiroth74/Material-BottomNavigation/wiki/Custom-Layout-Behavior on how to make the FAB Menu move together with the BottomNavigation. However, it doesn't seem to work anymore. Is there another way to achieve that?
Hi,
Is there a way to make BottomNavigation right to left? ( the first item in menu XML sit on right of screen)
i've tried adding android:layoutDirection="rtl" to View itself in layout xml but didnt work at all.
```
  if(heightMode == -2147483648) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("layout_width must be equal to `match_parent`");
            }
```
How should you use this in a ConstraintLayout with android:layout_width="0dp"?

app:elevation="0dp" not work
Is there a way to force the BottomNavigation to use the shifting icons (no persistent title) with only 3 buttons? I know it automatically uses this style with 4-5 buttons but with 3 it uses non-shifting buttons. Setting AlwaysShowLabels="false" causes these buttons to appear shifted upwards as if to leave space for the invisible label.

It's possible to get the ID of a given item by index, but not the other way around.

If we want to be able to use `setSelectedIndex()` to switch tabs programatically, and we don't want to rely on hard coded indices, we need a way to look up a tab position by ID.

Or better yet, also provide a `setSelectedId()` convenience method.
