The current Documentation and Wiki are obsoleted and need to be refreshed.

Up for grabs, among others:

* [API](https://github.com/sipcapture/homer/wiki/Using-Homer-API)
* [Installation](https://github.com/sipcapture/homer/wiki/Quick-Install)
* [Usage](https://github.com/sipcapture/homer/wiki)


This was a handy element of previous versions and would be great to see back.
