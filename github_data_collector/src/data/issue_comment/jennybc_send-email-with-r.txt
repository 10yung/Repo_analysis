Hi Jenny,

I used gmailr package on a daily basis to send out batch emails.
Starting from last week, I suddenly encountered Rstudio crashes whenever
I wanted to run the same script interactively. The error message is:

Below is my session info.

```
A test script that can reproduce the crash above is below:
```
library(gmailr)

## edit line below to reflect YOUR json credential filename
use_secret_file("gmailr-Grail.json")

test_email <- mime(
      To = "tma@grailbio.com",
      From = "tma@grailbio.com",
      Subject = "this is just a gmailr test",
      body = "Can you hear me now?")
send_message(test_email)
```
How to create MIME object for a reply using this package?

```
mime(..., attr = NULL, body = NULL, parts = list())

...   =  additional parameters to put in the attr field
```

how to modify the additional parameters to match up and send a reply.?
map_n deprecated since purrr v0.20 - pmap() (parallel map) replaces map_n() (#132), and has typed-variants suffixed pmap_lgl(), pmap_int(), pmap_dbl(), pmap_chr(), and pmap_df()
Hi, I am building an application hosted on shinyapps.io that sends an email. When running locally it works using `use_secret_file` however, this authentication does not seem to work on server in shinyapps.io (I upload the json file as well). 

The error log indicates the following:
`Please point your browser to the following url: 
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fgmail.readonly%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fgmail.modify%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fgmail.compose%20https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2F&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A1410%2F&response_type=code&state=BMX5xxbBjG`

So it seems to not be using the file. Is there something I am missing in the way it is called inside the shiny session? Or any thoughts on how I can achieve this authentication? It seems to work fine with googlesheets (using `gs_auth` )
