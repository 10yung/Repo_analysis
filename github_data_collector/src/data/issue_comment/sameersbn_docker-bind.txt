i am fully setup with your docker image and now using webmin to manage the dns server
 
i have a created master zone created for a domain that is also publicly available
i have some records that are only internal and some records that are public on the internet using dns servers of a provider

now i want to be able to resolve the internal records but when the record is not available i want it to resolve to external

is this possible? 
Hello! 

As my issue is marked as stale I wanted to ask if this project is still maintained? The last commit is from five months ago, the Webmin version is outdated and has security issues and the integrated Webmin update mechanism does not work. The current version of Bind "ESV" (Extended Support Version) itself is 9.11.13 from November 2019. 

Kind regards,
   Ralf

Seen on microk8s:
```
$ kubectl apply -f pod.yml

```
Quoting `false` to `"false"` seems to work.
