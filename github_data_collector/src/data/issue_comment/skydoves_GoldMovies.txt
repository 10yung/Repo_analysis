Hi, I was reading the console log and found that whenever there's a bad response the following message shows up: 

`A connection to https://image.tmdb.org/ was leaked. Did you forget to close a response body?
`

Any workaround for that? I was digging a little and the solution is to close the body response on finally try catch on the ApiResponse.kt but I cannot get it to work.

Thanks in advance.
## Guidelines
