In steps 10 and 11 DeepLinkFragment receives `myarg` from external sources is it possible to pass a value while navigating from BottomNavigation instead of displaying a default value?

val button = view.findViewById<Button>(R.id.navigate_destination_button)
button?.setOnClickListener(
        Navigation.createNavigateOnClickListener(R.id.flow_step_one_dest, null)
)

**Navigation.createNavigateOnClickListener(R.id.flow_step_one_dest, null)**
It doesn't work.
Kotlin is great in reducing boilerplate code, so it makes no sense to use findViewById in the code samples. Kotlin synthetic does the job instead.

Hi,
If anyone is looking for a Java implementation, please check my repo:
