In your codes, I saw in test phase, you used ground-truth points to generate initial points, but in practice, the test images have no ground-truth points, how do I test them?
I have trained the model and it is working correctly. 

But, now I would like to detect face landmarks with videos.  Is that possible?

Thank you.
Hi, tntrung. Thanks for your implementation.
Actually, I wonder why we need do_learn_shape and do_learn_variation functions.  And after we get ShapeModel and DataVariation, what do we do with it?
Sorry for my silly question.
Hi,

Thank you

Hi, when I do step "mex -L../../bin/glnx86 -lvl -I../ -I../../ vl_hog.c", there occurs an error,

Hi！
I have a problem which is how to get the xx_sift.mexw32? My system is 32bits.
