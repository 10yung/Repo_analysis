Worked on patternlab-php with standard edition for mustache by following steps in the command mentioned.but it escalate only errors.The file is not installed correctly.i worked correctly on following steps. I using PHP Version 7.1.31.But it causes some files missing.

Curious if there's an agreed way to adding these into a project since [there's a package for React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pattern-lab/engine-react).
Does anyone have tips or thoughts on what might be the best approach on integrating these sort of frameworks/libraries into a PL project?

Hi. I want to be able to add a favicon (along with all of the various touch icons etc) to a pattern lab site. Is there a way to reference these without editing the `general-header.twig` file of the pattern-lab in the vendor folder?

Thanks in advance.
When I try `composer install` I get the following error: `PHP Fatal error:  Class '\PatternLab\TwigNamespaces\PatternLabListener' not found`
Whenever i try to use Gulp with gulpfile.js in the project root to serve patternlab, whose folder is placed at first level inside the project (i.e. in '[project folder]/styleguide'), i manage to generate (build) the patterns, but not to serve them. 
```
$ gulp pl-serve

```

my code inside the gulpfile.js related to the 'pl-serve' task:

```
gulp.task('pl-serve', function() {
  var options = {
    continueOnError: false, // default = false, true means don't emit error event
    pipeStdout: false, // default = false, true means stdout is written to file.contents
    customTemplatingThing: "test" // content passed to gutil.template()
  };
  return gulp.src('./styleguide')
      .pipe(exec('php core/console -s --with-watch', options)).pipe(exec.reporter());
});
```
I tried the following:
using only one command i.e. `exec('php styleguide/core/console -s --with-watch' )` ;
using the expression for consecutive commands i.e. `exec('(cd styleguide;php core/console -s --with-watch)' )` with and without round brackets;
replacing -s with --server;
using the currently deprecated gulp-shell extension instead of gulp-exec;
changing styleguide with './styleguide' or './styleguide/';
build the project under Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux 16.04, currently developing under the second one.

if I use the terminal to move inside styleguide folder, and type 'php core/console -s --with-watch', the site is generated and served on the local host, and patternlab seems able to correctly detect changes in .twig files. 

This works instead, and builds the site if called by typing `gulp pl` from the cmd line: 
```
gulp.task('pl', function() {
  var options = {
    continueOnError: false, // default = false, true means don't emit error event
    pipeStdout: false, // default = false, true means stdout is written to file.contents
    customTemplatingThing: "test" // content passed to gutil.template()
  };
  return gulp.src('.')
      .pipe(exec('(cd styleguide; php core/console --generate)', options)).pipe(exec.reporter());
});
```

Maybe I'm doing something wrong, I used PL both in node and php versions and now I can't get it to work from there. It is not mandatory, but it could be useful.
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. 
The documentation currently specifies typing `php core/console --server`to view patterns. Would it be possible to include the additional options for specifying / changing the host and port number?

Additionally, it seems the socket created defaults to listening via ipV6, which doesn't work well for machines that have ipV6 enabled, but no address configured, and accessed from other computers on the LAN. A workaround I found involves disabling ipV6 on the server, and specifying the address 0.0.0.0 so that the web server created listens on something other than just localhost, and doesn't result in a connection refused error when trying to access from other computers on the network.

eg:
`php core/console --server --with-watch --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`

I am using PatternLab PHP & Twig.

I have a pattern that using some custom data (specifically, a 'dir' attribute on the html tag - to support right-to-left languages).

When I render that pattern directly, it works a treat.

When I render that pattern as part of the built-in "View All" menu it - it doesnt get the data.

I have tried two suggested 'inheritance' plugin, to no avail. I also redid my RTL version as a psuedo-pattern .. also no luck.

Am I doing something wrong - or is this just something PatternLab doesnt quite support yet? If anyone has any other ways to demonstrate a pattern in both left-to-right and right-to-left that would help too.

Thank you!
Hello,

in the issues of this project I see a lot of questions how we deploy integrate the code in our cms.

2-3 years ago the answers say that PL is only for frontend devs and not for backend devs.

Now the things changed, we are able to integrate it directly in a backend (Mustache, Twig).

I've a Project based on laravel; what is now the best practice integrating the template of a PL project?

Is it still the best to export the template via gulp as static resources and embedd then in our page?

Please note that laravel has the blade template engine by default.

Thanks.
https://github.com/pattern-lab/plugin-node-tab looks super useful (I'd like to display CSS/SCSS partials in my UI) but there's no corresponding plugin for the PHP version. Is there any existing way to do this on the PHP side of things or any easy way to integrate that existing plugin into a PHP-based project?
All of the instructions in documentation and across the internet say to set up the Gruntfile with:

`command: "php lab/core/builder.php -gp"`

but this results in an error.

Unless I'm missing something, there is no builder.php file in this folder.  Perhaps it's from an older version of PL?

At any rate, changing builder.php to console (which is a file in the folder) works perfectly.  

`command: "php lab/core/console -gp"`
