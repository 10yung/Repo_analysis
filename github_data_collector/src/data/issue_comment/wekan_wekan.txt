## Issue
I am not sure I am testing the rest-api correctly but I have a running instance, and I am trying to get the login for the first time.
I thought I could use an application key to login without using my username/password but I do not know where to find it. So I tried with username/password to get the authentication via rest-api:

```
baseAddress="https://something.me.com"
curl -X POST $baseAddress/users/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -H 'Accept: */*' \
  -d "username=myuser&password=xxxx"
```

Unfortunately I get the following:
```
{
  "error": "internal-server-error",
  "reason": "Internal server error"
}
```
(no other message appear in the logs).
I must say that all of my users are logged in using LDAP authorisation. Is there anything special I have to do to get that login? Or maybe I can get an application authorisation key from the browser?

Thanks in advance

I would like to request a feature that allows an easy way to invert the filtering system that is currently in use.

Current behavior:
[cb1] If clicking on a tag and it's not yet filtered for, then the board is filtered on that tag.
[cb2] If clicking on a tag and it's filtered for, then the selected tag filtered is removed from the filter.

Proposed new behavior:
[nb1] If clicking on a tag and it's not yet filtered for, then the board is filtered on that tag.
[nb2] If clicking on a tag and it's filtered for, then the filter for the selected tag will be inverted.
[nb3] If clicking on a tag and it's in the state inverted filter, then the tag will be completely removed from the filtering like in [cb2]

Proposed UI:
Either an exclamation mark instead of the checkmark or the checkmark in the side panel stays but the selected tag gets the strikethrough property.
## Feature request

New keyboard shortcut functionality:

Focus Search Box
Pressing “/” puts the cursor in the search box in the header.

Just like Trello.

## Upgrades in progress

Meteor 1.9 has been released, it includes using Node v12, MongoDB 4.x etc. There is currently a lot of changes in progress to make all platforms compatible and working, so I recommed following:

## Snap

Don't use edge channel, it has in-progress changes. Keep using stable channel in production. For example:
```
sudo snap refresh wekan --stable --amend
```
## Docker
Don't use latest tag. In production, use Docker tag v3.64, that is before major upgrades. For newer versions of Wekan, test on some separate system, before using the version in production.

## Sandstorm
Please make backup of your Sandstorm installation and grains before testing newest Wekan version.

## Source
Meteor 1.9 uses Node 12.14.0 and MongoDB 4.0.8. Currently I'm trying to get newest Node 12.14.1 and MongoDB 4.2.2 working. You can try some of those versions.

Problem description:
- If I have a large List in my Wekan Board everything works fine on my PC, but on IOS with Safari/Chrome/Firefox it doesn't load new cards if i try to scroll down! Only the loading Animation is shown! 

So I hooked up the Iphone with a Mac and connected the devTools on the mac with the Iphone and saw this Error in the Debug Console: 
![IOS Wekan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15196129/72064509-4f215580-32dc-11ea-86eb-d1063435d2ae.png)

@hupptechnologies 

Can you look at this?


I would like to know if it is possible to create a fully read-only role. User in this role should not be able to create new boards, and they should not be able to modify any of the boards they are assigned to. All they should be able to do is view the boards they have been added to. The closest I can find in the current setup is the Comments Only role, but unfortunately users assigned to this role can still create boards. Can anyone advise me if this is possible and how I could go about implementing it?

Thank you in advance for your help.

**Problem description**:
When you create new card with API there is default behavior that member is user who create a card. This changed recently. You can specify which one else user(s) may be member but it's not possible to create card with no member. Empty Array (list of members) won't work, there is member - user who creating card.
