To the author of the paper "Stratified Transfer Learning for Cross-domain Activity Recognition.":

I come across your work in cross domain adaptation for activity recognition and find it very interesting to read. I was just wondering, if you have the source code also available in python or pytorch? 

Other questions regarding the paper:
1.) Does the source and target domain have the number of samples for each classes?
2.) Should the source and target domain have the same amount of samples?
3.) Do you update the mmd_loss for each batch or the entire dataset? 
4.) Can you maybe also share the data with me? I can't find the matlab matrix for dsads.mat.

Thanks for your reply!

Best regards,
