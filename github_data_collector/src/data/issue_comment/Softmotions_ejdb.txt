Where have gone C# .NET binding?

Previously there was [Softmotions/ejdb-csharp](https://github.com/Softmotions/ejdb-csharp), which was deprecated in favor of official ejdb C# .NET binding, but I can't see it anywhere in [repo](https://github.com/Softmotions/ejdb), nor [official site](https://ejdb.org/). I haven't found any official announcements about it's destiny.

node bindings use normal numbers for ids but it breaks when id is bigger than 2⁵³ - 1

Suggested solution would be to use [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) for all ids

this change would bump required node version to 11.x, 12 is Active LTS so this change shouldn’t be a problem 
I tried to write my own python bindings ( It's the first time I've needed/wanted to write bindings from scratch :smile: ) using the precompiled ejdb2 and the headers after compiling the project from source, but I haven't been able to get this all working using cython or cffi. I also started to try and add a new binding into the project and its build tools incase that was easier, but my C IDE (JetBrains CLion) doesn't like the current project layout... something about the include paths for static compilation `#include <ejdb2/iowow/iwkv.h>` rubs it the wrong way...

So for now, I'm just going to put my polite request for python bindings into the issue tracker in the hopes someone else has the time to work it out, or knows how and has the time to do it.
