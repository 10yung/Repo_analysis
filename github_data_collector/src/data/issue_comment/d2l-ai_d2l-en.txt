On the flake8 test selection, this PR does _not_ focus on "_style violations_" (the majority of flake8 error codes that [__psf/black__](https://github.com/psf/black) can autocorrect).  Instead these tests are focus on runtime safety and correctness:
* E9 tests are about Python syntax errors usually raised because flake8 can not build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).  Often these issues are a sign of unused code or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in a dynamic language like Python they result in the script halting/crashing on the user.
* F63 tests are usually about the confusion between identity and equality in Python.  Use ==/!= to compare str, bytes, and int literals is the classic case.  These are areas where __a == b__ is True but __a is b__ is False (or vice versa).  Python >= 3.8 will raise SyntaxWarnings on these instances.
* F7 tests logic errors and syntax errors in type hints
* F82 tests are almost always _undefined names_ which are usually a sign of a typo, missing imports, or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These also would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in Python a __NameError__ is raised which will halt/crash the script on the user.

When I follow the example in Chapter 2.4 Calculus, the first block can not be executed.
```python
%matplotlib inline

import d2l
from IPython import display
from mxnet import np, npx
npx.set_np()

def f(x):
    return 3 * x ** 2 - 4 * x
```

Which prompts the following error:

```bash
/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/d2l/d2l.py in <module>()

The DATA_URL is defined in `chapter_multilayer-perceptrons/kaggle-house-price.md`, but not in the d2l.py.
The website lacks IPv6 support.

Since it seems to use CloudFront, fixing this should be as easy as [enabling IPv6 on the CloudFront distribution](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ipv6-support-update-cloudfront-waf-and-s3-transfer-acceleration/) and [creating an AAAA ALIAS record pointing to it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html#routing-to-cloudfront-distribution-config).

I would like to start translating d2l-ai book to Arabic. I see that you have a repository per language, could you create one for Arabic? If not what's the procedure? Thanks.  
Any plans to publish solutions to the exercises?
â€¦word attention

*Issue #, if available:*  NA

*Description of changes:* Added a background paragraph referring Bahdanau's paper and the motivation behind idea of attention.  I would like to add a few more motivational figures from the paper, please let me know if going in this direction is acceptable.  Thanks.

There were few small typos -- fixed it.
Beside, there's a small problem with creating test_iter, the position of the slice was reversed -- fixed it.
