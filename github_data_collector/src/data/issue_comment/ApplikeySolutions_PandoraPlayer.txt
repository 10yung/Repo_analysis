Module compiled with Swift 4.0.2 cannot be imported by the Swift 5.1.3 compiler. Is there any solution?
any idea about this issue on iOS 13?
Hi,
 I am trying to use the PandoraPlayer in my app. I didn't find api or specifications or documentation. Please tell me where can I find api documentation?

Thanks

The current version (4.0.3) is not compatible with the Swift 4.2.1 compiler. This gets rid of the error 'Module compiled with Swift 4.0.2 cannot be imported by the Swift 4.2.1 compiler'.

I like to use it and by that I've imported PandoraPlayer by two methods that are exist : 1- Pods 2-Carthage

but when I import Pandora player by Pod method I'll got this error about version of swift : `Module compiled with Swift 4.0.2 cannot be imported in Swift 4.1.2`

And when I import project by Carthage and try to build it it says : `No such module 'AudioKitUI'`

I've already searched about my problem and I've known that by updating pod I'll get rid of the errors but it doesn't worked for me.
PLease Help
Update PandoraPlayer.podspec for run success. and remove error: Module compiled with Swift 4.0.2 cannot be imported in Swift 4.1.2
