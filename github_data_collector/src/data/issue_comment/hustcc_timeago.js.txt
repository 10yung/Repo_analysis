This repo claims there is a cool tiny js library called timeago.js. Every link points to this cool github repo. I've downloaded everything I've found. They look perfectly cool but there is no timeago.js anywhere. 

Maybe the timeago.js isn't something we can download, it's a vision and a dream about the time, the future. timeago.js is something everyone talks about, prepares github pages, documentations and readme files but noone knows where is it.
In dom.ts, `getDateAttribute(...)` fetches the custom `datetime` attribute...
```javascript
export function getDateAttribute(node: HTMLElement): string {
  return node.getAttribute('datetime');
}
```
But AFAIK, HTML5 would prefer the use of **data-** prefixed custom attributes. I am in a development environment that returns proxy objects instead of direct DOM references. The handler for this proxy is strict and does not pass back any value to the `datetime` attribute. If the target attribute were (optionally) `data-datetime`, that would work and be more HTML5-ish.

Perhaps...?
```javascript
export function getDateAttribute(node: HTMLElement): string {
  return node.getAttribute('datetime') || node.dataset.datetime;
}
```
...for backwards compatibility? More validation is probably necessary for the above.
any help to add urdu locale !
Hi, thanks for your work to support Hungarian, and let me have a suggestion to the Hungarian translation.

Past tense versions of the texts are perfect.
Future tense version are grammatically fine, but I would use a different format. For example:

English: 'In 2 minutes'
Current Hungarian translation: '2 percen belül' means (for me) sometime between now and 2 minutes later.
Suggested translation: '2 perc múlva' means: exactly 2 minutes later from now

I understand that this means nothing for @hustcc , but I hope that @kukac7 and @szilardka accept my suggestion. 
In case of yes, I can create a merge request.

Basically I want to achieve the same thing as https://github.com/jgraichen/rails-timeago#usage. Actually the function requested in https://github.com/rmm5t/jquery-timeago/issues/95
I am adding a Spanish version of my app, and am using this library. The issue is that I need to register a language tied to a locale, however, I'd prefer if there was an option to register it for language only.

For example, instead of registering

timeago.register('es-ES', es)
timeago.register('es-MX', es)
timeago.register('es-AR', es)

I'd want to do something like timeago.register('es', es). Is that possible?
The locales is [here](https://github.com/hustcc/timeago.js/blob/master/src/lang), you can add the miss name.
1. Please **sort by dictionary**.
2. Please ensure the **accuracy**.
3. Please keep file size **tiny**.

## How to ?
1. Add you locale file into [locales dir](https://github.com/hustcc/timeago.js/tree/master/src/lang).
2. Add you locale key into [file](https://github.com/hustcc/timeago.js/blob/master/src/lang/index.js).
3. Add testcases into [__tests__/lang](https://github.com/hustcc/timeago.js/tree/master/__tests__/lang) dir.
4. Then run `npm test`, if all passed, then commit the pr.
