the defaults make the function work but give you garbage if you are not recording a single channel at 20kHz (is this anybody's default?)

I propose loading in from the xml when user specs are omitted

I propose a function with the following capabilities

1) With the help of an XML in the same basepath, read in data from a flat binary file (basename.dat or basename_analogin.dat or basename_digitalin.dat) with chosen channel(s)
2) there will be two modes of running the script, A) look for pulses with user defined thresholds or a % median threshold defined from the first chunk of the recording session.  This will read the entire file in chunks and only detect pulses. B) rely on the existence of an event file basename.evt.sti which defines the start and stop of either pulses (pulse_on/pulse_off) or sines (sine_on/sine_off). Then a slightly different algorithm will be used for pulse detection and sine detection (where  onset will be first crossing above some noise threshold around some peak threshold). 
3) buzcode manipulation files will be saved with stim onset, offset, type, amplitude, raw channel origin, and description which will need to be inputted manually.  data will be saved in a cell array Nx1 where N = # of channels with control signals
4) FMA event files will also be generated for neuroscope compatability.

QUESTION: if you want to make this an automated batch script and populate the decription field which is fixed across experiments, there should be some way to do this (same for animal metadata) what do you propose?

See #200 also
extended bz_getSessionInfo that incorporates Peters metadatasystem for sessionInfo.mat creation and loading
Make sure ripples code have same output.

Possibly: re-referencing to noise channel

add Elie
CellExplorer should save a cellinfo.mat
Should go from after recording to basic set of buzcode files
Manipulation structure around those filetypes
create CellClass.cellinfo.mat
