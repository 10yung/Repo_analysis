It stopped working with Xcode 9. Even with the trick to unsign the binary and update the plugins the extension doesn't work anymore. I can see that the extensions are loaded (for e.g. Alcatraz appears in the Window menu) but the code map is nowhere to be seen.

This is most likely due to the fact that Xcode 9 reworked entirely the code editor component. It didn't seem that their extension framework was improved in Xcode 9 vs what they announced and showed in Xcode 8 so for now there is no way to get back the functionality in a more official way.
You can modify the time to eat and then save the color information, cancel the synchronization when typing, performance is slow
It'll be nice to have a view on the git diff in the minimap.

Error messages that appear at the righthand side are obscured by the MiniMap. Often the issue navigator will show the warnings/errors, but it is not possible to view runtime errors using the issue navigator, and it's an extra step even for those that can be viewed in the issue navigator.

Thanks!

one suggest：can you change position this plugin to "Plugins" item，i notice a lot of plugins move here, like this  image:

The plugin list  that used by me is below:
{
     Alcatraz
     ColorSenseRainbow
     DBSmartPanels
     DerivedData Exterminator
     DXXcodeConsoleUnicodePlugin
     FuzzyAutocomplete
     HOStringSense
     JSFormatter
     Lin
     MCLog
     OMQuickHelp
     Peckham
     RTImageAssets
     SCXcodeEditorInset
     SCXcodeMinimap
     VVDocumenter-Xcode
     XAlign
}
When I remove   SCXodeMiniMap, Xcode works well.

The version of my mac is 10.11.3, and my Xcode is version of 7.2(7C68).

There is a feature in Visual Studio's right-side minimap that is just delightful, and I wonder if you'd consider adding it to your software?

VS has a color bar on the map that denotes deletions, changes and additions. It's very handy for jumping between the parts of code that you're working on. Here's a tiny screen grab of what I mean: https://imgur.com/sKfX3zv

Xcode:  7.2.1 (7C1002)

In comparison mode, it would be nice if the minimap was on the left side of the left comparison window, that way it would not break the comparison "flow" in the middle. 

It appears that this bug described here is caused by SCXcodeMiniMap:
https://github.com/FuzzyAutocomplete/FuzzyAutocompletePlugin/issues/92
Removing SCXcodeMiniMap fixes the issue, as well as installing SCXcodeMiniMap without FuzzyAutocomplete casues Xcode 7 to crash again.
