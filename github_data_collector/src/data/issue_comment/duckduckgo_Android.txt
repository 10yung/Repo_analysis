**Description**:
After this change, whenever browser user is initiating any download, a confirm popup will appear on the screen to confirm or deny the download. If the same file is already downloaded, the user will be presented with options like _Keep both,_ _Replace_ and _Open with_ to open an existing file and abandon the download.

In the second iteration, we can also provide an option to the user where he/she can provide a custom name for the downloaded file.

Hello, I'd like to suggest a feature to allow useras to have a transparent widget. As you can see the screenshot below, to have the grey part fully transparent with only the icons showing.

![Screenshot_20191226-140113_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26126452/71483726-79b5dd80-2809-11ea-84ba-7606b3294846.jpg)

Hello, I'd like to suggest a feature, an option in the settings that allows to move the search bar + menu (basically the whole top bar) to the bottom for easier usability.
Hello,
There are a couple things that bug me about the app dark theme:

- The menu (dropdown) is still white (shouldn't it be dark too?)
- The search results page is not in dark mode (and I wish it was)

Please see screenshot attached.
![Screenshot_20191226-140122](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26126452/71480160-18d1d980-27f8-11ea-8098-d0d8e7309c3b.jpg)

Would it be possible to add "Do not track" option to the settings? It's the single feature I'm missing in comparison with Firefox Focus.
Thanks a lot, for both the app and the project in general
The fixed bottom navigation bar on webpages stay hidden until the user scrolls down the page and the address-bar of the browser hides.

The issue is that the browser doesn't take into account the height of addressbar while calculating the height of viewport(vh). Almost all other mobile browsers subtract the addressbar height from the viewport height.
