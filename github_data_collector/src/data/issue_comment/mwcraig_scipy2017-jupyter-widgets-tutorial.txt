It complains about 0.3.2 despite being installed.

The --no-deps is to prevent it from updating numpy to 1.13 via pip when conda installed numpy 1.12.

Some of the layout is already done as part of the container exercises. Not sure how much of the model to have them code.
From the outline:

- [x] Container widget, pieces of kids, good for protoyping, needs example.
- [x] Subclass, e.g., `Box` or `VBox`
- [ ] Include, as a cautionary tale, the strung-out mess that is `reducer`.
