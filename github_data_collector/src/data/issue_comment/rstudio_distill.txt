Could you add a convenient method to delete posts from a blog without having to manually delete the folders and rebuild the website?
When knitting a `distill::distill_article` with the following code in a chunk with chunk option `layout="l-screen-inset"` (or any other non-default `layout` argument) added markers are not seen on the map.

``` r
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup="The birthplace of R")
```

The code is taken directly from the documentation <https://rstudio.github.io/distill/figures.html#full-screen-layout>. Note that the issue can already be observed from this documentation page where the marker of the birthplace of R is not seen.


When creating a simple distill article (as below), if `tz` is `NA`, knitr throws an error:

> Error in if (tz != "UTC")  { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed

Example distill article:


```
---
title: "Untitled"
description: |
  A new article created using the Distill format.
author:
  - name: Nora Jones 
    url: https://example.com/norajones
    affiliation: Spacely Sprockets
    affiliation_url: https://example.com/spacelysprokets
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output: distill::distill_article

Distill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.

I've just started using the `distill` package for personal blogging. Great experience so far.

I wanted to understand if `rmarkdown` LaTex support is offered similar to [bookdown here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html).

I tried to write a **theorem** in a `distill` article by using:

    ```{theorem}
    Here is my theorem.
    ```
This gave the warning (error):
```
Warning message:
In get_engine(options$engine) :
  Unknown language engine 'theorem' (must be registered via knit_engines$set()).
```

And no theorem was displayed. Could anyone please explain if/how
to get this working for math-based distill blogposts?

**UPDATE:** I also tried adding the following (on MacOS) to the `distill yaml` header:

	header-includes:
	  - \usepackage{amsmath}
	  - \usepackage{amssymb}
	  - \usepackage{amsthm}
	  - \usepackage{bm}
	  - \usepackage{bbm}
	  - \usepackage{amsfonts}
	  - \usepackage{mathtools}

And also then did the following:

	$$\begin{theorem}
	We note that the most interesting theorem is the following:
	\begin{align}
	x &= 1 \\
	y &= 2
	\end{align}
	\end{theorem}$$

This did not display any equation though. If you omit `begin{theorem}` tags then `align` does work as per rmarkdown.
Hi,

is it possible for you to share the source css code? That will allow me to change the font and comply with the graphic chart of my organization.

Thanks for your help and thanks a lot for this awesome way to create a blog/website so easily.
1. Is it possible to create an RSS feed that is limited to some categories / labels / tags only?
2. Is it possible to have the RSS feed have the full content of the posts?

(Both these are required for R-Bloggers cross-posting...)
I have

I am trying to add footer to distill blog using the distill tutorial but it seems its not working. please provide the code to add in _site.yaml file.
Are sticky articles supported/going to be supported in Distill?

Hi,
I'm back! Going to commit my self to this format. I notice on the distill website there are several layout options for figures e.g. .l-body.side,.l-middle.side,.l-page.side.

Will these be supported? i tried using them but they aren't (or maybe i did something wrong?)
