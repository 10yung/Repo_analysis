Hi. defunkt-san
Proxy authentication function has been added,  please merge if you like.
Regards.
Fixes #304 
At present when you call 
`Gist.read_gist`
It just prints the gist information to the console. Instead the right behaviour is, it should return the gist contents so that we can assign it to a variable and use it. 

We need to change the behaviour with the CLI tool to print the returning information from `Gist.read_gist` instead of directly printing into the console inside the method.

# For CLI:
https://github.com/defunkt/gist/blob/02ab846270f81e98e536b0c73effa1990220a6e0/bin/gist#L176
## Current behaviour: 
```ruby
    Gist.read_gist(options[:read], file_name)
```
## Expected behavior: 
```ruby
    output = Gist.read_gist(options[:read], file_name)
    puts output if output
```

# For API:

https://github.com/defunkt/gist/blob/02ab846270f81e98e536b0c73effa1990220a6e0/lib/gist.rb#L239

## Current behaviour:
```ruby
puts file["content"]
```

## Expected behaviour:
```ruby
file["content"]
```

Included notice about new Docker Image base on this gem.
Fixing this should be easy:

```sh
url-final () {
	curl -Ls -o /dev/null -w %{url_effective} "$@"
}
```
I installed via **apt**, and it could not find the gist command in the terminal. 
Then I installed via **gem**, it could not find the command either.

It only worked after I soft linked it to /usr/bin/ with

`ln -s /var/lib/gems/2.5.0/gems/gist-5.0.0/bin/gist /usr/bin/gist`

Is the problem with this project, with gem or with apt? Or am I doing something wrong? :disappointed_relieved: 

It would be nice if there is an option for setting up default gist id for current directory.

The default gist id can be retrieved (Maybe) via `.gist_id` file. Just like `.ruby-version` or `.rbenv-gemsets` where they determine the default version or gemset by using the values in that file.
Nothing happens

This could be done by looking recursively in the tree for the `.gist` file. 
If the above approach works, I need it the functionality and I'm happy to work on a PR for it.
