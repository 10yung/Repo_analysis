## Description
During live playback the seek bar only has to be updated when the player is paused, because we will always be the same period away from live while playing. 

## Specific Changes proposed
* Start updating the seekbar for the first time on duration change.
* If the duration is Infinity only update when paused otherwise update how we do now.
* Make sure visibility change only enables the interval if it was enabled before losing focus.

It seems we have never triggered `change` events on `remoteTextTrack` when we were using native text tracks. This was a problem for VHS, which exclusively uses text tracks.
This makes it so we do trigger the event. Main issue with this change is that it creates a potential for a false positive where a change event was triggered from a non-remote text track but the remoteTextTrack list still received a change event. This issue is mitigated by best practices of looping through the list looking for the modes that you care about.
## Description
Based on #6405 

## Specific Changes proposed
Use the old liveui for live videos where `seekableEnd - seekableStart` is less than `30s`. This is configurable with an option.

hello,I want to hide fullscreentoggle icon. 
I tried many ways.example:
vjs-fullscreen-control {
    display:none;
}
or
videojs("my-video", {
    controlBar: {
      fullscreenToggle: false
    }
});
but it still here.
my videojs's version is 7.5.4. thanks!
## Description
Currently the liveui has a few issues 
1. `seek-to-live` button to toggles off and on while playing and the seek bar moves around.
2. When playing behind the seek bar jumps around a lot
3. Seekable interval is not consistent between videos

## Changes
1. `liveCurrentTime` can run much faster than once every 30ms depending on how fast the interval is going. This can put `liveCurrentTime` ahead of `currentTime` until a `seekableEnd` changes. To Solve this we are going to use `deltaTime` rather than expecting a 30ms interval to run every 30ms.
2. `pastSeekEnd` is not being reset at the same time as seekable end is changed, which can cause `liveCurrentTime` to report a value that is a segment length or more greater than what it should be. To solve this `pastSeekEnd` needs to be reset to 0 in its getter and all of the seekable end tracking needs to be done there.
3. `isBehind_()` is called two separate times, this can cause different values to be returned.
4. A culmination of these issues caused the `seekBar` to jump every time `seekableEnd` changed because `liveCurrentTime` was so off from what it should have been.
5. Changed seekable interval to `liveTolerance` and set it to 15s. This means that all videos will be live within 15s of live current time
6. `seekableendchange` was removed, it really wasn't needed.


## Questions/Other Problems
* Do we want the `seekBar` to stay at 100% even though the user has seeked 15s into the past? Is it just good enough to keep the seek bar at it's actual percent but keep the `seek-to-live` button reporting that the video is live? Currently creates weird behavior were seeking back 14s does go back in the video, but the progress bar still shows 100% and that we are live.

## Other Pull requests
* Disable the new ui for short live windows < 30s and when liveCurrentTime is Infinity (like on Android native HLS)
* Only update the seek bar when paused while live, since we will only be changing our time when paused.

Include a [reduced test case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/), we have a [starter template](https://codepen.io/gkatsev/pen/GwZegv?editors=1000#0) on JSBin you can use.

## Steps to reproduce
Explain in detail the exact steps necessary to reproduce the issue.
1.play the video,the video source changes the aspectRatio from 16:9 to 4:3,or from 4:3 to 16:9
2.as an example, in the iphone 6,the width of the video is 375px and its aspectRadio is 16:9,when the video is playing,its height is about 210px;when the aspectRadio change to 4:3,the video'height should be about 300px,but it dosen't;
3.i try to change its height when the aspectRadio changes by myself .the result is the dom'height is correct but the video is out of shape.if i reload the page,it's good,but reload the page is not good for the user.

## Results
### Expected
no matter the aspectRadio of the video is 4:3 or 16:9,the first time i click the play button ,it's good,but if the aspectRadio changes while ths video is playing ,the video will be out of shape; hope this problem can be resolved
