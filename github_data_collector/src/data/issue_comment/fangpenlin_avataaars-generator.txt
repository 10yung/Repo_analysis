*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

A static webpage would be the best. I am not familiar with React. 

Also it is possible to host this offline? Meaning no access to the internet? As I can see this app relies on avataaars.io is the API there open source too?
The radio option for Avatar Style will no longer be needed if https://github.com/fangpenlin/avataaars/pull/25 gets merged. This PR removes the radio option as well as any references to Avatar Style that become unnecessary. 

The linked PR removes Avatar Style and moves it into a BackdropStyle option that supports the addition of more backdrop styles as well as changing colors for the backdrop.

> Depends on https://github.com/fangpenlin/avataaars/pull/25 being merged and built 

Hello,

Just a reminder to not forget it ðŸ˜‰ 
E.g. https://avataaars.io/?avatarStyle=Circle&topType=LongHairMiaWallace&accessoriesType=Blank&hairColor=BrownDark&facialHairType=BeardMagestic&facialHairColor=BrownDark&clotheType=BlazerShirt&eyeType=Dizzy&eyebrowType=DefaultNatural&mouthType=Eating&skinColor=Brown as copy pasted from https://getavataaars.com shows "Application Error"
Doing a fresh install of react and the repository.  The server comes up briefly and crashes with:
Failed to compile.

/Users/daniel/Documents/GitHub/avataaars-generator/node_modules/@types/lodash/common/object.d.ts
(1689,12): error TS2304: Cannot find name 'Exclude'.

I'm trying to specify later versions of lodash and typescript (just searching for other people with this issue on other projects)  but same error.  

I'm not fluent in react (I'm an ios programmer).. so a little too much in the deep end here
