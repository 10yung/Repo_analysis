I run the shared-services-stack.json as per the documented process on the Microsoft website
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/shared-services

Azure building blocks runs and creates the first two resource groups and several other resources, at the point it tries to create the VM's "ad-vm2" the first failure occurs, it seems to be related to the path defined for the Availability Set. 

i confirm that the Availability Set "ad-as" has been created, it is but the ID is using a different path "/subscriptions/d14e0007-7ca6-42d9-a499-94964278xxxx/resourceGroups/onprem-vnet-rg/providers/Microsoft.Compute/availabilitySets/ad-as"  to what is defined in the error message, Microsoft.Compute is referenced instead of Microsoft.Network as stated in the error message below:


See raw error message below for reference:
{
  "code": "DeploymentFailed",
  "message": "At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list deployment operations for details. Please see https://aka.ms/DeployOperations for usage details.",
  "details": [
    {
      "code": "BadRequest",
      "message": "{\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"code\": \"BadRequest\",\r\n    \"message\": \"Id /subscriptions/d14e0007-7ca6-42d9-a499-94964278xxxx/resourceGroups/onprem-vnet-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/availabilitySets/ad-as is not a valid resource reference.\"\r\n  }\r\n}"
    }
  ]
}
The source code compiles, which is good. Then it becomes a bit vague:
* The deployment script includes a mix of bash scripts, arm template and manual actions. This is hard to deploy, test, and troubleshoot.
* The markdown page starts with the script fragments in correct formatting but goes wrong at read -s SQLADMINPASSWORD export SQLADMINPASSWORD, which makes it confusing what to do.
* The SQLADMINPASSWORD instructions are unclear: Are you trying to get an encrypted password?
* The arm deployment fails for me for the three alertrules (bad request with a message about classic metric alerts)
* Even with all these messages, the app should still work, but it doesn't. Just gives a plain html without css or images and no data being collected.

Custom script extension is failing to download & execute "install-apache.sh"

DETAIL:
I am attempting to provisioning the architecture outlined here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/secure-vnet-hybrid#deploy-resources 

Provisioning fails with custom extension error in step 3 of the above.  

If I logon to the linux VM, I see in /var/log/azure/custom-script/handler.log:
error="http request failed: Get [REDACTED] dial tcp 151.101.16.133:443: i/o timeout"

Finally, if I look at the downloaded scriptfile in /var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0/  I see install-apache.sh of length zero. (No content!)
In the Adds-Forest.ps1 script the SetDnsServerARcordsForWebApps should make the ZoneName and ComputerName (and maybe IPv4Address) values script parameters or driven by other script parameters if possible.  This would allow flexibility in using the reference architecture with different domain setups.
It would be nice to get a reference architecture for big data analytics that utilizes azure data lake, powerbi.com and to enable analytics across data produced by different systems within an Enterprise.
The command to check the DNS name was failing because the authors subscription id was a part of the command. I added a SUBSCRIPTIONID parameter and leveraged that parameter as part of the curl command to check the validity of the gateway DNSNAME.

Github Raw URL returned 404. Updating with correct script location. 
update readme to use databricks 5.3
add neighborhoods file to repo (no longer present in referenced web site)
minor fixes
Hi team -

Have been working in detail with the hybrid architecture with great success.  Out of curiosity, is there a way to CHAIN the deployment scripts so that they execute one after the other with timed perfection?  Maybe with a PowerShell wrapper which waits until each one has successfully completed?
