The Exchange API documentation has been updated here, which outlines that new exchange API URLs and WSS have been updated --> https://docs.pro.coinbase.com/#client-libraries

I have manually attempted to modify the tribeca.json, and a few of the other files to use these updated url interfaces as the old ones have been deprecated, but I have been unsuccessful in getting Tribeca to connect. I believe something must be in the code somewhere that needs updating to allow the interface to connect to the exchange.
This happens after manual installation:

When I open Tribeca (localhost:3000) it shows Tribeca [dev] instead Tribeca [prod]. I've already changed in env file dev to prod. How should I procedure?

Ps.: My balance doesn't show either.

Can someone please explain what this piece of code from `safety.ts` does? I understand that its purpose is to balance buys and sells. However I don't understand the algorithm. I tested it with the example trades from `trds` quoting parameter description in the wiki and got different results - `Buy TS: 1.75, Sell TS: 0.75` instead of `Buy TS: 2.75, Sell TS: 0`:

https://jsfiddle.net/victoro/bo9k7gqz/

```
        // don't count good trades against safety
        while (_.size(this._buys) > 0 && _.size(this._sells) > 0) {
            var sell = _.last(this._sells);
            var buy = _.last(this._buys);
            if (sell.price >= buy.price) {

                var sellQty = sell.quantity;
                var buyQty = buy.quantity;

                buy.quantity -= sellQty;
                sell.quantity -= buyQty;

                if (buy.quantity < 1e-4) this._buys.pop();
                if (sell.quantity < 1e-4) this._sells.pop();
            }
            else {
                break;
            }
        }
```
can anyone explain me about and how to calculate for BBO, FV, and width?

Hi guys!

I'm testing tribeca with Bitfinex in test, and at the moment there aren't orders.
Now my question is: is there a minimum of deposit to have (in live or in demo) so Tribeca works?

P.s.: I see everything correctly. The market trades, the green background, etc...
