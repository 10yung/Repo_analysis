        magnetView.backgroundColor = .clear
               magnetic = magnetView.magnetic
        self.magneticView.addSubview(magnetView)
        self.magneticView.bringSubviewToFront(nextMagneticButton)
        magnetic!.backgroundColor = .clear
        
        for _ in 1...10{

While using this library, I occasionally (roughly half the time I run the exact same procedure in my app) get an error in the console reading `UIColor created with component values far outside the expected range. Set a breakpoint on UIColorBreakForOutOfRangeColorComponents to debug. This message will only be logged once.` I've followed the directions by setting a breakpoint and could find nothing there and confirmed that my own code has no time where I create a UIColor with a value more than 1.0.

Additionally, I found [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52094352/i-am-having-graphics-uicolor-created-with-component-values-far-outside-the-exp/52116062) StackOverflow answer indicating that I'm not the only one experiencing this.

I don't think it's a big deal at all as it's not causing a crash, but I thought I'd at least raise awareness of it.

### Issue Description
I get inconsistent warnings regarding `UIColorBreakForOutOfRangeColorComponents` - I will run the exact same code multiple times and only have it happen sometimes.

### Issue Description
I tried to feed large data set to check whether it can adjust the bubbles or not. The results are in below screenshot attached. 
I made 120 nodes and added to the magnetic to check whether it can handle large dataset or not. As we can clearly see in the screenshot that. The bubbles are overlapping on each other as they didnot find place to expand. Please resolve this issue ASAP.

Hi, 
is it possible to restart animation so that when the user comes back on the screen the bubbles will be animated from besides to center?

Thanks for the delightful library! In preparing for a user test, I noticed a few minor usability issues with VoiceOver(VO):
- MultiLineLabels are read as individual label elements as opposed to a single label
- Selection state of a node isn't presented to a VO user
- There is no easy way for a VO user to quickly confirm selections, which is a benefit of this library for a non-VO user

### Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail. -->
To address the above 3 issues, I have made the following changes
- Made **Node.swift** class set ```accessibilityElement``` to true (overriding it's children's accessibility settings), as well as enabled the property to group it's children. This allows multiline labels to be read as one, if the nodes accessibilityLabel is not set, but that's set as well. Additionally, this PR adds an ```accessibilityPath``` that is, by default computed to be an ellipse inside the sprite shape, but can be overridden or removed if subclassed. 
- Added ```accessibilityTraits``` to be selected when a Node is tapped, i.e in the isSelected property.
- For iOS 10.0 and above, **MagneticView.swift** is initialized with a "Selected" custom rotor, using ```accessibilityCustomRotors```. 
- Note that for iOS 11.0, the entire **Magnetic.swift** scene has the added property ```accessibilityContainerType``` to be .list. This lets a VO user know when they are entering and leaving the list of items

I wasn't entirely sure if OS specific code is allowed in this library, but given that this makes tangible benefits to a VO user, I'm hoping it's alright. Tested on Xcode 9.4 and iOS 11.4 betas.

Happy to make changes as needed!
