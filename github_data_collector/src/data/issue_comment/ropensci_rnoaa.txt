@potterzot for the next milestone, no rush

e.g., `gefs_times` and `gefs_ensembles` were introduced in #328 , but it's not clear what they do , they are in gefs tests though, so thanks for that. 

in addition, current parameters could use more explanation. for examle, for `...`, you have 

> ... additional parameters passed to the connection.

maybe you could say what kind of parameters users could pass in and _how_ (i.e., in a named list? some other way?)
to avoid situations like in #330 this is needed

For all fxns that use caching:

- [ ] throw a `message` probably when a cached file is being used & probl don't throw any message when a HTTP request is made to get new data
- [ ] when using a cached file, would be good to include in the message the created or last modified date of that file so the user can think about whether to delete those cached files or not
- [ ] with a lot of requests messages could get annoying. have a flag to turn cached file messages off? probably do not want this on by default since then we're back to where we are now with users possibly confused about why they're not getting up to date data
I'm not sure if this really belongs in the issues or the forum, since it's more a feature request than a bug, but here it goes. In some cases stations are missing a lot of data, making the `autoplot()` of a `meteo_coverage` object very misleading. For example: 

```{r}
library(rnoaa)
library(ggplot2)

# Site
Safe_Harbor <-  'USC00367732'

# get data
dat <- meteo_pull_monitors(monitors =  Safe_Harbor, 
                            keep_flags = T, 
                            var = c("PRCP", "TAVG", "TMAX", "TMIN"))

# autoplot plots from first to last date, ignoring gaps
obs_covr <- meteo_coverage(meteo_df = dat)
autoplot(obs_covr)

# Alternative plot, showing gaps
# unique dates
min_date <- min(dat$date)
max_date <- max(dat$date)
dates <- data.frame(date = as.Date(x = seq.Date(from = min_date,
to = max_date, 
by = 'day')))
# join the original data to all the unique dates
temp <- dplyr::full_join(x = dates,
y = dat,
by='date')
temp$location <- Safe_Harbor

# dummy column for plotting
temp$size <- NA
temp$size[which(!is.na(temp$prcp))] <- 1

# plot with gaps in coverage
ggplot(temp, aes(x = date, y = location, size = size))+
   theme_bw()+
   geom_line(show.legend = F)
```
Cool newer (from 2017) dataset combining interpolated data from multiple sensors for sea surface height and sea surface height anomaly. Datasets look easily accessible.

Hi Scott,
    ASOS one and 5 minute data would be an excellent addition to the rnoaa capabilities.

P.S.  I'm not trying to give you a ton to do lately, but rnoaa has so much potential!
