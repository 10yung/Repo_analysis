Disable nomodeline as a security precaution
One of my ```install.sh``` starts nvim and that reads the other ```install.sh``` paths from stdin. This prevents them from running.

I've solved this by using ```find```'s ```exec``` to run the ```install.sh```'s:

```
find . -name install.sh -exec sh -c "{}" \;
```
I think this may be a self-created issue, but the battery status addition in my Bash profile seems to be leading to accidental visual line overwrites.

When I wrap the line, Terminal and iTerm have trouble figuring out the length of the line, and it overwrites on top of my existing text, and then if I delete back to the prompt even lets me delete part of the prompt.

Any idea what I might be doing wrong? Are there settings I should be adjusting in either the prompt or battery-status files?

Certain libraries and plugins (e.g. [neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake/blob/177e2b1f9a/tests/fixtures/input/zsh/parse-error.zsh)) may have `.zsh` files in test folders. These are not intended to be sourced when starting up.
Some systems don't allow direct access to the sysctl command at the regular user level. This gets around that by checking if we can access the command directly from zshes $+commands magic variable.

Hi,
thanks for the best dotfiles yet üëç .
Now to my "problem". Currently when being in a detached HEAD state the prompt throws up and always shows a warning that 
```
fatal: ref HEAD is not a symbolic ref
```
and shows an incomplete prompt e.g.:
```
üîå  ‚ö°Ô∏èin .dotfiles/ on
```
This PR fixes that and displays:
```
üîå  ‚ö°Ô∏è  in .dotfiles/ on detached HEAD
```

Maybe the message could be tweak a little (maybe show commit sha) but is in my opinion way better than throwing an error.
