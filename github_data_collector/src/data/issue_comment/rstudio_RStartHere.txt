Added officer + flextable suite, allowing the user to generate native MS Word and MS Office template-based documents directly from R. Complex, customizable tables, with cell merge and multi-level headers (not available via RMarkdown to Word) are supported as well.
Added term "Generalized" to lme4
Added nlme, glmmTMB and glmmPQL, which allow the user to specify the residual covariance structure, which is not supported by the lme4. Those, who want to analyse longitudinal trials, repeated measurements, will likely need to specify the residual covariance, except the simplest and rather unrealistic cases.

Update: I saw nlme was eliminated from the list. This is the true workhorse for mixed models applied to longitudinal analysis, which by cannot be replaced by lme4, as lme4 doesn't support the user specified residual covariance. I am afraid, that removing nlme only because it doesn't have easy syntax or a website, and leaving a package, that is limited in functionality, isn't the best approach. It may create a false impression, that lme4 is the only choice for longitudinal trials. It is not, except for basic cases.


Not sure if this needs to be changed in the .md as well, but these packages are must-have's, and work well in the tidy-verse realm
Should have a Package NEWS section highlighting major changes in new version

tableone provides a useful way to summarize datasets. The name is reference to the first table in many clinical research manuscripts, generally providing baseline population characteristics. The package appears to meet requirements. 

Suggesting [rstanarm](http://mc-stan.org/interfaces/rstanarm.html). 

Meets all requirements: Website, excellent vignettes, unit tests, open development, intuitive interface (fit models by adding "stan_" to usual R regression models). It is rather new though (January 2016).
