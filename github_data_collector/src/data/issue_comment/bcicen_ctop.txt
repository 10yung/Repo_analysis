Just hangs after selecting yes.

Pressing e for exec is mentioned in the README.md file but it seams it is not implemented.
After a while, the list of containers shown in ctop doesn't match `docker stats`
Can't provide much more than that at the moment.

ctop version 0.7.2, build 70bd2ae go1.11.3
Docker version 18.09.7, build 2d0083d
Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS
It's unclear what the NET speed is referenced as.  Please switch to a standard format such as KB, kb, kB, Kb, KiB, kib, Kbps, kbps, etc.

List of bugs I've seen:
* Stopping/Starting containers freezes the app
* Stopped/removed containers are still present with red status next to its name at the bottom
* Sometimes when you restart/start containers, the stats are -
* Pressing `e` on a container will open a shell and then using a text editor will show weird characters on the left side

From what I've seen, 0.7.1 does not have these issues.
This is a WIP for the moment, naive approach to adding colors to ctop. Open to conversation on this but at least wanted a PR against it for posterity.

Fixes #117 
Has a nasty habit of just exiting in log view, either initially or via a crash fault after awhile.  If it doesn't decide to just terminate upon startup first!

There is already a packaged version for Arch. Would be great to also have it packaged for ubuntu/debian via apt. Even a PPA is fine.

(It would need a different name because `sudo apt install ctop` actually installs [this](https://github.com/yadutaf/ctop)).
Some stuff often takes some time, and an indicator showing it's still running, (i.e. the ssh connection has not died) would be great.

Especially before the first load when the screen is completely blank, and when doing stuff like restarting a container or loading logs.
Was updated k8s branch from master branch. 
Resolved conflicts. 
Added script for preparing minikube for testing kubernetes connector (not work yet).
