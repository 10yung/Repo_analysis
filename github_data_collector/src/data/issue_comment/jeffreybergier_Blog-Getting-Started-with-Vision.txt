Hi there 
After a few time running I had got the error below. Do you have any ideas ? 
Throws: Error Domain=com.apple.vis Code=9 "Internal error: Exceeded maximum allowed number of Trackers for a tracker type: VNObjectTrackerType" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Internal error: Exceeded maximum allowed number of Trackers for a tracker type: VNObjectTrackerType}
I'm trying to make UIKit <-> AV <-> Vision coordinate systems work together and your example of conversion makes sense. Unfortunately, when I'm trying to apply it to face detection approach and draw a rectangular of a detected face the coordinates are completely off

for example, when a user taps on screen coordinates `x: 200 y: 100` I'm drawing a box at that position with width: 100, height: 150

```
let tappedAt = sender.location(in: self.cameraView)
let uiBox = CGRect(x: tappedAt.x, y: tappedAt.y, width: 100, height: 150);
let avBox = self.cameraLayer.metadataOutputRectConverted(fromLayerRect: uiBox)
let vnBox = CGRect(x: avBox.origin.x, y: 1 - avBox.origin.y, width: avBox.width, height: avBox.height)
        
print("user tapped at: ", tappedAt.x, tappedAt.y)
print(String(format: "-> UI box | x:%.01f y:%.01f w:%.01f h:%.01f", uiBox.origin.x, uiBox.origin.y, uiBox.width, uiBox.height))
printMsg(String(format: "-> AV box | x:%.01f y:%.01f w:%.01f h:%.01f", avBox.origin.x, avBox.origin.y, vnBox.width, avBox.height))
print(String(format: "-> VN box | x:%.01f y:%.01f w:%.01f h:%.01f", vnBox.origin.x, vnBox.origin.y, vnBox.width, vnBox.height))
```

it gives the following output:

```
user tapped at:  200.0 100.0
-> UI box | x:200.0 y:100.0 w:100.0 h:150.0
-> AV box | x:0.1 y:0.6 w:0.4 h:0.3
-> VN box | x:0.1 y:0.4 w:0.4 h:0.3
```

- why the width and height are flipped (width of the UI box corresponds to the height of the AV/VN boxes)?
- why `x` for the UI box corresponds to `y` of the AV/VN box (I tapped at x: 200 but it affects the `y` part of AV/NV box, not `x`)?

It looks like the coordinate system is flipped but I'm unable to come up with the specific system to convert coordinates properly and draw the bounding box for a detected face
This is a great demo, thanks first Jeff. However, unfortunately, I couldn't get this working the same way as you have in your video. When I tapped to start tracking, the red bounding box just zoomed out, getting smaller and smaller. Sometime, the bounding box disappeared, I had to tap to start tracking again. Is there some known limitation on this demo or vision framework?
