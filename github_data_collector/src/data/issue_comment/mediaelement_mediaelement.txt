I can find no way to have captions on by default. This should be possible for accessibility reasons. 
Is there a way to enable this in the API?

Thank you.
Setup: I am using medialementjs (v4.2) via npm and the setup is done as part of a React component as mentioned in the docs. It is running on KAIOS 2.5 which I think should behave as Firefox 48.0.  
I am facing an issue where I see quite a few calls failing out with HTTP status code 416. On digging into the failing calls I see that the calls have byte ranges greater than the content length (as determined from previous http requests) of the audio file. I can't find any reason why this should happen. 
Adding the request/response details for a 416 scenario, host and file name are replaced with dummies :

There appears to be some kind of issue loading YouTube videos with MediaElement on the Brave browser (based on Chrome).

https://brave.com/

I'm not sure if this is a Brave issue or something to do with MediaElement.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Download + open the Brave browser (I'm using `MacOS Version 1.1.20 Chromium: 79.0.3945.74 (Official Build) (64-bit)`)
2. Go to the MediaElement homepage (https://www.mediaelementjs.com/)
3. Select YouTube as the video source
4. Click play

## Expected behaviour
The video should play

## Actual behaviour
The video does not play and the following error can be seen in the developer console

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/id' from origin 'https://www.youtube.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: The value of the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header in the response must not be the wildcard '*' when the request's credentials mode is 'include'. The credentials mode of requests initiated by the XMLHttpRequest is controlled by the withCredentials attribute.
```

## Other notes
Normal YouTube embedding appears to work fine in Brave
With Chrome 78.0.3904 under Android 6.0.1, the drop-down list becomes inactive and stops the video
Looking through the documentation it is unclear whether this supports the ability to provide multiple video formats passed as sources for a single video, similar to a basic html5 video element.  I've tried loading sources with the same name such as file1.webm and file1.mp4 but this just results in a 2 file playlist.

I know for compatibility I can use h.264/mp4 alone but I'd really prefer to provide webm for those that support it and will benefit, especially mobile users with less access to affordable bandwidth.

Is this supported?  Thx
We're getting a couple different errors with mediaelement. The first is:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'userAgent' of undefined
```
We believe it's related to this line which looks for `default` on the window:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3966722/69433919-8f1b8180-0d0a-11ea-9ec4-323fe4cece76.png)

which another library is changing (as is relatively common). If the mediaelement files are loaded after the other plugin the above error occurs. If we make sure the other library is loaded _after_ mediaelement then it doesn't throw an error.

Simple UMD modules will break mediaelement. See [this demo](https://codepen.io/osublake/pen/da26401ff624affec9128c32c033188b?editors=1000) for an example. It causes the following error:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'mejs' of undefined
```

Seems to be caused by `Object.defineProperty(exports, '__esModule', { value: true });` conflicting with the line here: https://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement/blob/5bc2965eaa0a0e97127c4444085244fc6d6f9f9f/build/mediaelement-and-player.js#L7725

Because __esModule is already set on the window, the `_interopRequireDefault` function returns `obj`, but the code is expecting it to return `{ default: obj }`.

___

These are things that Rollup adds to compiled UMD files, so it's going to be an issue with a lot of different tools. It would be best to fix this on the mediaelement side since it's a common break point. 

Related to #1042 but different conflicts. 
- As per documentation **load()** method used to reload the audio/video element; But i'm facing issue in case of youtube video.
- It is working fine with self hosted video 

**Steps to reproduce**
1) Go to link https://www.mediaelementjs.com/
2) Select Youtube from selection
3) play thie video 
4) From **console** execute **mejs.players.mep_0.media.load()** it will not reload the player (as per documentation it should reload it)

**Same working with MP4 vidoe**, 
- Instead of selection **youtube** just select **MP4** and follow same steps as above. it will reload the video


Running gtmetrix report and getting performance hit by render blocking javascript.  I can change the enqueque code but requesting you add to your todo list to load the JS differently .  Thanks!
