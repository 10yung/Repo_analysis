Hi all,

I recently finished porting Kautilya for Arduino-Micro platform. In order to do this I:
- patched USBCore.cpp and USBAPI.h to include some extra HID features. The Arduino fork with patched implementation is available at https://github.com/valerio-click/Arduino-HID-Plus;
- slightly modified scripts in lib/src to accomodate new payloads compatibile with Arduino-HID-Plus.
  The patch is available at https://github.com/valerio-click/Kautilya-micro.

Hope this can help supporting using Kautilya as a penetration testing tool.

best regards,
click
