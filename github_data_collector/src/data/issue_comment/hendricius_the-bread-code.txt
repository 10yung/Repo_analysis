Why not make some burgers this weekend? I did it yesterday and thought I share with you my recipe for making the buns. It's yeast based, so no sourdough needed. Unfortunately I could not fully focus on the dough, I guess they could have turned out even better, next iteration then.

I took the basic recipe from King Arthur's but then adjusted it slightly to my liking. I also changed the recipe to include % values instead rather than absolute values. That way you can scale the amount of buns you want to make.

It would help to mention that the butter should be softened/room temperature and creamed together with the sugar before mixing in with the banana to avoid clumps of butter in the batter. 
I followed the basic dough recipe and used "white flour" from Migros (Switzerland.) Flours have no types here, but "white" flour has 12% proteins which is what I understand type 550 to have.

The variations I did from the recipe: I let the dough sit for about 10 hours instead of 8, and then let it rest 1h instead of overnight in the fridge. I also used a KitchenAid to mix the dough in the second stretch and fold (not sure if that was a good idea). I didn't have any razor handy so I didn't score the bread before putting it in the oven. And the dough was *very* wet, so I didn't flip it because it would stick to my hands too much and, I worried, fall apart.

In the end, the bread is ok, it rose and looks decent, but it could have more bubbles. I think this is because mixing it with the KA was too much and it collapsed all the gas pockets.

What bothers me the most though is that it has the texture of gluten-free bread. It's rather powdery compared to regular bread.

Any ideas for improvement?
thanks so much for your bread instructions.

I'm trying to make the mother dough but I'm worried I'm doing it wrong.

I'm using whole grain wheat

The first day it was fairly dry but I measured 100g flour + 100g water like the instructions say

The next day I transferred it to a larger jar and added 50g flour + 50g water. That night it expanded large and touched the plastic on top. I stirred it to let the air out and continued to add 50g flour + 50g water each day. This is what it looks like on day 7 (and days 4, 5, and 6)

You can see there are almost no bubbles. You can also see the high mark from day 2.5 on the side of the jar. My apartment is around 25c constantly

Here's an gif to show the constency of what I have

Any ideas? Did I mess up? Can it be saved? Thanks


I got very inspired by your repo and tried it

Haven’t tasted it yet but I’m already proud of it

Thanks for sharing all these recipes and techniques

Sorry I have been inactive a little recently. I've been doing a lot of research to optimise the breads that I bake. I've started from scratch rethinking all the steps that I do. This pull requests contains the knowledge that I gathered in the last 6 months. I've mostly been focusing on this one recipe, baking it approx. 200 times. Every bake I tried to adjust only one parameter at a time. It was really worth it, I got a much better understanding of each step.

It's still work in progress. I will add more chapters over time.
