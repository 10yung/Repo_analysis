Fixed up the SD card requirements for NOOBS/Full Raspbian.

Cross compiling references
~/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian/bin or ~/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64/bin

Those are gcc 4,8 and won't work for the 5.4 kernel.
It should now be ```~/tools/arm-bcm2708/arm-linux-gnueabihf/bin``` which symlinks to the latest toolchain (currently should be 4.9.3 in ~/tools/arm-bcm2708/arm-linux-gnueabihf/bin).

@pelwell please confirm I'm correct on these details.
Documentation says 8GB SD card is sufficient for NOOBS but with Buster this doesn't seem to give enough space to install full Raspbian in offline NOOBS.

Full Raspbian with offline NOOBS is the recommended option in our beginner tutorial material so this could be misleading. 
Raspbian now supports NFSv4.1, which results in a much faster boot time. TCP is the standard protocol for NFSv4, and UDP is disabled by default for some NFS servers. This information should be reflected in https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net_tutorial.md. I have a related PR: #1384

See #1380
(https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net_tutorial.md) Final step says "echo "10.42.0.211:/tftpboot /boot nfs defaults,vers=3 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab" but surely this should be "echo "10.42.0.211:/tftpboot /boot nfs defaults,vers=3 0 0" | sudo tee -a **/nfs/client1**/etc/fstab"?

Added the missing User OTP bits that can appear in the board revision.
