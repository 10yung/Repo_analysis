But now it shows where we will be AFTER update. But there is no mark where we are now.

The latest phpbb automatic update borked the server and it needs a manual update @wj32 


e.g the "Command line" column can get quite long, and I'd rather not have to stretch the window and resize the column across multiple screens, to see the full content for multiple concurrent processes.

Anyway, this is a very nice tool and better in some ways than the older "Iarsn TaskInfo".
The code here:

https://github.com/processhacker/processhacker/blob/b44a1573eb263e5b585abb377966d169df574de2/plugins/WindowExplorer/wnddlg.c#L257-L259

was added in 0d5a6488cef9cf56cac366067545e04b7f1ff649 in 2012. To enumerate "immersive" windows it is necessary to add the DisableWindowsFiltering element to the manifest, which was done some time later here: https://github.com/processhacker/processhacker/commit/199fa76149caeb0b1f6fff505ca8cab2e6310ad0#diff-b79242c33bab388819b4787050075056

So what I'm wondering is if the current usage of FindWindowEx over EnumChildWindows actually serves any purpose today? The current method is obviously more fragile since windows being created/destroyed during enumeration might mess things up.

Just installed MS VS 2017 and MS VS 2019 on one of my PCs and always get this:
```
CustomBuildTool.exe -release
Unable to find Visual Studio.
```
Could you help me to solve the problem?
Hello @dmex.

This is my first try to contribute to open source project. In this pull request I've tried to make a enhancement for auto focusing search box as suggested in issue #521.

Forgive me if I made a mistake for my first pull request.
Best regards.
Using the 2019 Dec 23 nightly but UDP network traffic is still not accounted for. I know nothing about Windows programming but udp connections do have the ASSURED state. If this is not available then a user configurable timeout for assured would do, i'd set this for 180 seconds.

Please, it's pretty terrible to see only 5-10% of the traffic accounted for.

Otherwise the Network tab looks pretty good, countries stay sorted.
WHEN the Country tab is selected, it'd be pretty great to be able to Pin a certain country and have the country list be displayed with this country at the top. I don't mean resorting, just have the alphabetically sorted country list always keep the pinned country starting at top row, whichever direction the whole list is sorted with.

Something like this:

When we have such pseudoparent and option Include usage of collapsed processes - we can see in columns total of all filtered processes when pseudoparent collapsed.

When WindowBlinds OS theming engine is active the startup takes up to one minute with 100% CPU and physical memory exhaustion, along with EventLog service 100% CPU consumption.

All of this didn't happen in 3.0.2621 and older.
