Hi @kishikawakatsumi ,

I have added SPM support and tested importing and using it in an app, everything is working fine on my side.

[Referencing issue](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/UICKeyChainStore/issues/171).
Hi All,
Is it possible to get this library to work on Mac using Mac Catalyst?
`'SecAddSharedWebCredential' is unavailable` on macCatalyst.

Thanks!
I'm having this issue at moment compiler try build the pod `UICKeyChainStore`, ld: library not found for -lgcc_s.1, we already disable de post configuration for bitcode, and valid_archs settings. What else can I try?

Hello,

SPM support for all Apple platforms has been announced and Xcode 11 has a nice integration for it! Please add SPM support for the project!

Thank you for your great work! :)
It happens in this method.

```objective-c
- (BOOL)setData:(NSData *)data forKey:(NSString *)key genericAttribute:(id)genericAttribute label:(NSString *)label comment:(NSString *)comment error:(NSError *__autoreleasing *)error
```

```objective-c
#if TARGET_OS_IOS
    if (floor(NSFoundationVersionNumber) > floor(1144.17)) { // iOS 9+
        query[(__bridge __strong id)kSecUseAuthenticationUI] = (__bridge id)kSecUseAuthenticationUIFail; // put it into available block warning
#if  __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED < __IPHONE_9_0
```
For what I've found it's because both versions (10.0, 11.4) share the same build settings "Product name", what can I do about it?
(Cocoapods 1.6.0.beta 2)

Thank you!

I used to do all the developing for iOS 10 but now was forced to migrate to iOS 11. Immediately I encountered some erratic behavior. The app uses links like app://action/[id]/ and the id corresponds to TouchID protected keychain item. When the app is run for the first time with such link, it works like a charm, but, if it is not, the app works spontaneously - most often I just get different security errors (25308, 25293) without any usable description. Everything worked perfectly on iOS 10. I thought that it could be an issue with obsolete library, but even after the update nothing changed. It gets even more interesting since the app works as expected on 11.2.1, but does not on 11.1. Moreover, if I quickly switch to another app, the TouchID prompt may appear for that app (TouchID for "Safari" but with my description), but the result will be seen in my app should I switch to it. That is so frustrating. Any help will be much appreciated!
I try to get password from UICKeyChainStore 2.1.0.This method

crash when SecItemCopyMatching

Device Information:
iOS 10.3.3
iPhone6 Plus

Could you please include all the available options of '**SecAccessControlCreateFlags**' in the enumeration '**UICKeyChainStoreAuthenticationPolicy**'? I am not able to use the '**kSecAccessControlTouchIDCurrentSet**' option flag in my application. Is there any other obvious way that I am not seeing? Thank you in advance.
When a Touch ID protected item is added after it has been removed, the authentication dialog does not display.

Following the instructions for [Adding](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/UICKeyChainStore#adding-a-touch-id-protected-item)/[Removal](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/UICKeyChainStore#removing-a-touch-id-protected-item) of a Touch ID protected item, should an Add operation always result in the system to display the authentication dialog?

I'm seeing that ordinarily, the system dialog will display.  However, when an item is added after it has been removed, the authentication dialog does not display.

Specifically, I see the following when adding, reading, and removing an item:
- **Add, Read, Remove => OK** -- dialog shows for the Add and the Read
- **Read, Add, Remove => OK** -- dialog shows for the Read and the Add
- **Remove, Add => NG** -- dialog not displayed for the Add
- **Remove, Add, Add => NG** -- dialog is only displayed for the 2nd Add
- **Add, Add, Read => OK** -- dialog is displayed for both Adds and the Read

So it would seem that the first Add following the Remove of an item is not resulting in the dialog being displayed.  (The value is however being written even though the dialog is not displayed)

Tested on iPhone 6s 10.1.1 and iPhone 6 Plus 10.2 using version 2.1 (where all operations are using the same key @"kishikawakatsumi" and Adds are using the value @"01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef")

Its possible I'm doing something wrong in testing but I haven't been able to identify the cause yet so wanted to ask for clarification of expected behavior.
