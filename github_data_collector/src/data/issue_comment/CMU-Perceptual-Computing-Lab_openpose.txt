### Issue Summary
The left-hand's heat maps (which can be read from **datum.handHeatMaps[0]**) is not properly flipped back to the original image.





### Type of Issue
- Enhancement / offering possible extensions / pull request / etc

2. **OpenPose version**: Latest GitHub code

### Issue Summary
Is there a way to output hand heatmap to some local files by only setting some FLAGS instead of going to the code and manually write output?
It seems currently the **write_heatmaps** flag only works for body heatmap.


### Type of Issue

Hello,
First of all I want to thank you for this great work, I want to train the model on my own data but I do not know which annotation tool I will use can you advise me?
Thank you.
### OpenPose Output (if any)
Is there a heatmap ground truth dataset for hand. How to know your heatmaps are correct or not?

Usually bigger pictures takes longer to process as OpenPose tries to detect people on the entire picture, but sometimes it's known that a target person will always stay in a specific small area (ie. a person poledancing) and never move out from there for the entire clip (ie. imagine a 256x512 area out of a 1920x1080 picture), so it would be faster to crop that area in 256x512 pictures and run OpenPose on them, but then the JSON aligments won't match with the original 1920x1080 pictures anymore, making them unusable, would you consider adding a feature that allows to focus only on a smaller area to speed up detection considerably? It's SO much faster when I crop the pictures first, but I also need the JSON data to align with the originals afterwards. I think that would be a really useful feature, especially on landscape shots where the person is usually at the center and their left and right have nothing important to detect.
Hi all
I am trying to get the coordinates of joint keypoints, which file should I look into, and how can I print them out?
I am running openpose on MacOS, CPU only. 
All help are appreciated. Thanks in advance. 
Hello, your job is great! I've been studying human poses recently. Can you tell me the order of the body25 heatmap? I think the actual point order is not consistent with what you provided. Finally, the key point 6 is LElbow? or is LShoulder?
anyway, thank you !!!
I am using openpose on 2 computer， one with nvidia gtx 1070 graphics card and the other with nvidia rtx 2060 super.(1070 with nvidia driver 410+cuda 10.0+cudnn 7.6.4; 2060 with nvidia driver 430+cuda 10.2+cudnn 7.6.5)
The codes are Exactly the same， but 1070 only cost 2.2G gpu memory, otherwise 2060 will cost almost 6G gpu memory.
Why is there such a difference? Can you explain it？ thanks!
I'm trying to run this on low-resolution images that contain one human. The images are about ~ 50x100 pix. The program doesn't work very well on such low-resolution images. The majority of them do not have joints detected well. Though heatmaps appear to be somewhat ok.

I was wondering if someone would have any tips on how to modify the program to perform better on low res images. Thanks.

Here's an example of an image that didn't work.
