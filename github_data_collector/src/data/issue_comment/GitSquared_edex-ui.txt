## Problem

Updates to MaxMind's EULA resulted in the freely accessible GeoLite databases URL being taken down (`https://geolite.maxmind.com`). We used these to fetch GeoIP databases on install through [`runk/node-geolite2`](https://github.com/runk/node-geolite2).

Any attempt to install or build unreleased versions of eDEX will result in the following error:

```
Downloading maxmind databases...
events.js:282
      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
      ^
Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND geolite.maxmind.com
```

Need to send patch to upstream modulee - or handle this locally? - ASAP

## Problem

Reloading the app and opening a previously open terminal tab leads to a crash.

![12774246](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11785085/68545685-a46de300-03cf-11ea-981f-bbd9a9a8f57f.png)


Running on a Mac with external displays this program only shows on the main display, and leaves external displays untouched. It would be cool if other monitors are also used, blacked out, or displaying something. Or have some option to choose what to do with external displays.

Add ability to right-click on a terminal tab and select different shells to run (idea totally stolen from the new MS Windows Console). Could list the shells in the config file, use the first entry as the default but allow user to choose and then launch.

See: https://youtu.be/8gw0rXPMMPE?t=13

**Perceived idea awesomeness**
- [ ] Would be super cool.

**Perceived idea difficulty**
- [ ] Shouldn't be too hard to make.
