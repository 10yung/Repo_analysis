DocOnce encourages using `sudo pip install`. Although `sudo pip install` is still used in many guides, it is regarded as bad practice due to security risks and possible issues for your system (see e.g. [What are the risks of running 'sudo pip'?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21055859/what-are-the-risks-of-running-sudo-pip/21056000#21056000) ). he most recommended installation methods for Python packages is using virtual environments. Using `pip install <package>` of `pip install <package> --user` is also recommended (see [Installing Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/)). 

Notice that `sudo pip install` fails on Python virtual environments. An example is in the doc/src/manual/install_doconce.sh file, which was throwing an error on my virtual environment. 

All files using `sudo pip install` can easily found by using this regular expression on the DocOnce installation directory: `grep -r 'sudo pip install' .` 

Issue [#182](https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/pull/182) "Add answers_at_end option and review behavior for solutions_at_end" help users to move **all solutions/answer** to exercises to a separate section in the end of the document. When dealing with documents that have to be regularly updated such as course material, DocOnce users would need new functionality to control only **part of the solutions/answers by hiding or moving** them to the end of the document. 

A user could add a DocOnce command that modifies how exercises write out solutions/answers from its place in the code until a new command brings back the normal behavior for solutions/answers. This comand should be allowed to be placed anywhere in the DocOnce text. See this example: 

```
========= Week 1 – Electric field =========
label{ch:week01}

!anshide
!soldocend

#This is the text for chapter 1:
# #include "../chapters/week01/week01.do.txt"
!split

#These are some exercises. Answers will be suppressed, Solutions will be moved to end of document 
# #include "../chapters/week01/exer-week01/week01_ex1.do.txt"

#Restore normal behaviour for Solutions and Answers
!soloff
!ansoff

========= Week 2 – Gauss' law =========
label{ch:week02}

#This is the text for chapter 2:
# #include "../chapters/week02/week02.do.txt"
!split

#These are some exercises for week 2
# #include "../chapters/week02/exer-week02/week02_ex1.do.txt"

```

The example above introduces new commands: `!<sol or ans><behavior>`, where <behavior> can be "hide", "docend", and "off" to restore the default behaviour. The six commands I proposed are: 
`
!solhide
!soldocend
!soloff
!anshide
!ansdocend
!ansoff
`
[quickref.html](hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/quickref/quickref.html) shows under the "Section Types" paragraph that exercises can be surrounded by 7 = characters. When I try this I get a compilation error (not shown).

The documentation is probably wrong/obsolete on this point. In fact, according to [manual.html](http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/manual.html#manual:exercises) Exercises, Problems, Projects, and Examples are subsections and should be surrounded by 5 = characters. Also [book.pdf](http://hplgit.github.io/setup4book-doconce/doc/pub/book.pdf) defines exercises as a subsections.
Broken links in documentation:
* In [doc/pub/quickref/quickref.html](http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/quickref/quickref.html) the `example document` points to a 404 Page. 
* In the same section the reference to `doc/src/make.sh` does not seem to be valid (the file does not exist)
* The link to Mako in the last chapter of [main_mako.pdf](http://hplgit.github.io/setup4book-doconce/doc/pub/book.pdf) is broken

Of course these corrections should be applied to the corresponding *do.txt files and can apply to other document formats

In addition I noticed a couple of typos:
* In [doc/pub/manual/manual.html](http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/manual.html) the "(e.g.)" should probably be removed: `line as MYVAR=mytext (e.g.)` 
* In the same file `Different pieces of Python code in Mako is placed` should be `.. are placed`

Dear Doconce Users,

For some time the command 'doconce sphinx_dir theme=$theme $name' causes errors.
I need to run it twice to obtain automate_sphinx.py in my work dir.
It seems that sphinx-build has been changed and path variables behave different.
Has someone experienced similar behaviour?
Shall I track this inside the relevant doconce class?

Regards

Mirco Meiners
Some of the raw strings in doconce have unknown escapes, such as \c. They should be \\c. 
Please, give support for Portuguese (PT) and Brazillian Portuguese (PT-BR)!
Add the new feature mentioned in #43 into the manual (at least I can't find it and I really like/need it!)
I am not a regex pro. It seems to me that ``` ``(.+?)''``` is better than ``` ``([^']+?)'' ``` because it allows for apostrophes within the quotes. I hope I'm not missing anything obvious. 
I see that Reveal.js had a major update in Nov 2017, whereas docOnce had its last release in Oct 2017.

I can't figure out why, but lots of things are broken when generating revealjs presentations out of docOnce now. 

It would be nice if DocOnce can be updated to match the latest revealjs release
