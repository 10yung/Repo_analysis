Your 35 GB [Data Set](http://multispectral.kaist.ac.kr/pedestrian/data-kaist/videos.tar) is still available but the Downloadrate on different system is at 200 KB/s settled. This is a pain to download. You should test your server connections. I tested your server on bitcatcha with only good results in Japan. I was sadly not able to test if your server or any other server is the issue for the slow rates. The response to europe is a hole second. Your host is slowing down. Please consider any changes.  
Hi,I would like to ask how to use matlab to draw the ROC curve in your paper ?
What is the difference between the plot of the ROC curve and the dataset of Caltech?
Hello,

I have tried multiple times to download the dataset for my PhD research but it appears that all the links are dead, could anyone please advise on how to access the dataset?

Best,
Majed.
where can I get the mean and variance value of this dataset ? or suggested value? I need them to normalize images before training. 
Can't find these .txt files within the dataset.
That the textscan function error in line 50 imgNms =bbGt2('getSubsetFiles',{imgDir, imgDir, gtDir}, testSet);
I'm not sure if that problem happens when there's no train20.txt?
I met this issue that I didn't met before, when I was trying to use the google cloud platform to download the dataset. Any help will be appreciated thank you.

Got this error message:

[Error] md5 checksum is not correct. (imageSets.zip)
`

Even if the imageSets.zip file can be unzipped without any problem
The downloaded file has the following md5 hash:
`
md5sum imageSets.zip

I can't download dataset from this link.

check to help me, thanks!
Hi, I just downloaded the dataset but I could not find the _reasonable_ subset mentioned in your paper. 
Is it one of the image lists in the _imageSets_ subdirectory? 
Also, could you tell me the relation of the benchmark mentioned in your paper with the lists in the _imageSets_ directory? Thank you very much!
You say we just need to download this Dataset and your package.But this file don't work.Maybe I should transfer vbb files into txt files firstly,or I should do some preparatory work?
