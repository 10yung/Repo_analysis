e.g. if have job group "A", "B", "C", they might appear first, second, or last randomly. It will appear stable for a while and then get jumbled around for no apparent reason. This is targeting Quartz 3 and while making no changes to the underlying quartz jobs.

I'm working with ASP.Net Core MVC, and wanna know if there's a way of loading CrystalQuartz graph (got when calling /quartz) inside an HTML element.

That question comes because I have two different sources of elements to fill the graph (different contexts), and a way of changing the graph (reloading it with the other elements) just by clicking on some button on my window.
is it support more than two listening addresses? if it is,how to set? thanks
The page doesn't load when I have couple of thousands of jobs, in the dev-tool -> Network I see a '500' error to 'quartz?path=Scripts.jquery-1.11.1.min.js:4'

Hello, 

the page simply won't load on my browser having 3K jobs in store.

I guess it is just rendering everything at once instead of using lazy-loading on the page.
Hi,

I love the CrystalQuartz, but I'd like to integrate it into SPA, do you have any plans to support it?
Hi,

I have an existing app using CrystalQuartz.Owin 4.0.0 that works fine.  When I upgrade it to 6.x, I get a 404 error, when I click the CrystalQuartzPanel.axd link.  I added a script map that points to type="CrystalQuartz.Web.PagesHandler, CrystalQuartz.Web".  That did not work.  I created a file script map that points to CrystalQuartz.Owin.dll and that does not work either.  If I roll back to 4.0, everything works.

Thanks,

David
