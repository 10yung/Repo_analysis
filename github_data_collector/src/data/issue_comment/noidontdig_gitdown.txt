At README.md DrinkShield has two links to http://www.gfxhax.com/drinkshield/.
Unfortunately, the domain has expired.

The DrinkShield link provided in the README (http://www.gfxhax.com/drinkshield/) is broken. I would submit a pull request, but I was unable to find a valid link.

Rather than have your own config file (required to be copied to all repositories) I would suggest that you use the standard `git config` command to set and get (possibly with your own internal defaults).

eg you could set via:

```
git config gitdown.mode normal
git config gitdown.port /dev/tty.usbmodem1421
git config gitdown.verbose true
```

and retrieve via:

```
git config gitdown.mode
git config gitdown.port
git config gitdown.verbose
```

The http://www.gfxhax.com/drinkshield/ points to a stub

Your Ballmer peak limits are off - they should be 0.129 and 0.138, not 0.13 and 0.15.
