Instructions how to build the fonts from source
These are a handful of links about variable fonts:

https://webkit.org/blog/7051/variable-fonts-on-the-web/ 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/Variable_Fonts_Guide
https://medium.com/variable-fonts/https-medium-com-tiro-introducing-opentype-variable-fonts-12ba6cd2369

If Gidole is to tread the variable fonts path, it could hopefully address #18 and other variant-related issues.
While using the font in a web application, any combination of ` + char e. g. (`a or `x) results in a character with a grave accent. There are similar issues with a caret (i.e. ^) sign in combination with another character. The issue is very much similar to the one described here regarding the noto sans fonts (https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-fonts/issues/736, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12655054). I've included the type-face as follows:

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Gidole';
    src: url('../fonts/Gidole/Gidole-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
}
```

Using Noto Sans:

Using Gidole:

Interestingly, this issue only pertains to the *.ttf fonts available for download. The Gidole homepagemakes use of a *.woff variant of Gidole (hosted here: http://gidole.github.io/fonts/Gidole.woff) that does not suffer the same problem.
Dear Larsenwork, 

Your fonts Gidole and Gidolinya are absolutely amazing! Will you be able to convert them into web fonts against a payment? 

Kind regards, 

Francis
Gidolinya's curves and fixed-width would make it useful as a [single line font](http://imajeenyus.com/computer/20150110_single_line_fonts/index.shtml) for engraving using CNC machining and drawing animations.

Most vector programs can only convert text to outlines, and there is [no simple method](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/72043/central-simplified-pen-strokes-of-a-font-glyph) to convert glyph outlines to a single stroke. I found [some techniques](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/3997/technique-for-finding-the-centerline-of-a-curved-object/69181#69181) to trace the centerline path, though none of these would properly preserve the Euler spirals of the Gidolinya letters and are not elegant solutions.

Any ideas on how to achieve this with SVG paths?
I've run into a weird issue with the font where there is insufficient clearing between the <s>apostrophe</s> single quotation mark and neighbouring glyphs. I've seen this across several apps, as shown in the image below. Interestingly IE and Wordpad seem to render the <s>apostrophe</s> single quotation mark with the correct spacing. I don't know whether it's a quirk with the font rendering system or whether it's something with the font itself. Anyone else can replicate this issue?

Platform: Windows 7.

edit: its actually the single quotation mark, not the apostrophe.
We currently use a similar font that doesn't have nearly as many weights - would love to have a rounded version though <3
Hi -- I like your Gidole font. I had to look up what "DIN" was, though, because I'm not a font expert. So I suggest here a quick explanation and also a link to your Gidole website. Cheers - Benson Gardner
Hi!

The font looks very nice, but I couldn't fond it on any CDN. There are two common used CDNs where one can place Gidole for free: https://www.jsdelivr.com/ and https://cdnjs.com/. By creating additional small files, the next versions of Gidole published on GitHub will be automatically posted to the CDNs. Everything is very easy and I could help in doing it if it would be required. One need just add the Gidole files to the corresponding GitHub repositories (https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr or/and https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs) via a pull request.

Best wishes!
Oleg

Hi Andreas

Thanks for the great font! I've used it for French documents, it's awesome :+1:.
Will you add later ligatures support? 

Have a nice day :smiley:
