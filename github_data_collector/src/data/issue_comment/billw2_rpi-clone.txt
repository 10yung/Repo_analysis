Hello everyone!

So, I'd like to clone my existing Raspbian (only one OS) to another SD with Noobs Multiboot.

Card1: Raspbian
Card2: I run NOOBS, select which OSes I'd like to install. Installing LibreELEC and Raspbian.

And then I would run rpi-clone to overwrite Raspbian from Card1 to Card2.
While keeping the boot menu and LibreELEC intact.

Is it possible with the standard options? Thanks!

Hi,

I tried to clone a Rasberry Pi 4 32GB disk to a 16GB.  The boot directly did not clone correctly.  After the cloning 'ls /boot' doesn't show all the files and shows files with odd characters on the clone drive.  The boot use size is ~51M, and the partition is ~268, the root size is ~3.5GB and the partition size is ~31GB.  So this sd card should clone into the smaller sd card.  Is there an issue with using 'rpi-clone' on a Raspberry Pi 4? Thanks, Robert

Please help.
The copy does not end, it hangs.
Before cloned with Stretch without problems

I had to kill the processes
I removed my original SD card, inserted a new one flashed with Raspbian Lite and then rebuilt the system.... all good so far. It's been running for a few months so thought it was time to clone it, and wanted to use rpi-clone to clone it back to the original card I removed.
I put the original in a USB card reader, inserted it into the Pi, and it mounted the EXT4 partition as "/", and totally refused to unmount it. "/" was already occupied by the resident SD card, I had TWO root partitions, and nothing would resolve the issue until I rebooted and reformatted the original card using a Windows PC before reinserting into the Pi. All went fine after that, rpi-clone did its thing and I've got my cloned card.

Any ideas why the original got mounted, and will it happen again if pop the clone back in for an incremental update?

hello,
thanks fo providing this tool, but all the cmd line parameters are killing me...

which would be a cmd or a .sh script for full-automatic clone from Raspbian SD to a SD in card reader?
- no matter how many partitions are  on the source SD (2,3,4,5, unknown?)
- no matter if the destination SD is somehow smaller than the source (given it's still big enough for storing all files, eg. 32GB to 31GB or 32GB to 16GB),  feat. new optimized partition sizes.
- no matter if the  destination SD is somehow bigger than the source (e.g., 8GB to 32GB, feat. new optimized partition sizes,
 - no matter if the target SD is fresh formatted or already pre-partitioned (perhaps giving a warning if not empty).

it must be fool-prove  to never falsely accidentally swap source (actual boot SD) and destination (SD in USB card reader) without any need to check anything before (checks are expected to be handled automatically by the cmd/script).
is there a way to clone a source sd card via multiple usb micro usb card readers to multiple destinations at one time?

like 
`sudo rpm-clone -f -p 256m sda | sde etc....`
I updated cpi-clone to 2.0.21 2-3 days ago no problem - today I followed your 3-line instruction to update to 2.0.22 - RPI said no - the directory isn'y empty. I'm experienced enough to simply remove the original directory and continue on with the install. Others may not be. I checked to see if an override option is possible on git clone - arrarently not unless I just missed it.
In my case before doing the install I did:

   cd
   rm -r rpi-clone

that wiped the original.. I then proceeded as per your instructions... 

On a Raspberry Pi:
	$ git clone https://github.com/billw2/rpi-clone.git 
	$ cd rpi-clone
	$ sudo cp rpi-clone rpi-clone-setup /usr/local/sbin




Hello I have multiple Raspberries running in my network. 
I want to make a clone on weekly basis of each of them to my NAS. 
I mounted the NAS into my Raspberry /mnt/backup 

and now my question: Can I use rpi-clone to make a weekly backup into the mounted location /mnt/backup/image_ddmmyyyy.img ?

Thanks a lot for your help.
Hi

I just downloaded rpi-clone and tried it.
It fails always with a rsync error like:
`rsync: write failed on "/mnt/clone/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/dri/vmwgfx_dri.so": Read-only file system (30)`

(not always at the same file)

If it helps, here is the message at start:
```

then when it happens, I can't try anymore: 
`Syncing mounted partitions:
  Mounting /dev/sda2 on /mnt/clone
mount: /dev/sda2: can't read superblock
    Mount failure of /dev/sda2 on /mnt/clone.
`

any idea?

Hi

Over more than a year I've used RPI-CLONE without issue and now I'm on Buster on RPI 3, 3B+ and 4 after initially backing up all of them, I was having major issues backing from SD to SD or SD to USB.

Here's a typical example...

Initializing
  Imaging past the start of /boot partition 2.
  => dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/dev/sda bs=1M count=52 ...
  Resizing last partition to end of disk ...
    Resize success.
  Changing destination Disk ID ...
  Delaying so partprobe can update /dev entries ...
  => fsck -p /dev/sda1 ...
  => mkfs -t ext4  /dev/sda2 ...

Syncing file systems (can take a long time)
Syncing mounted partitions:
  Mounting /dev/sda2 on /mnt/clone
  => rsync // /mnt/clone with-root-excludes ...
  Mounting /dev/sda1 on /mnt/clone/boot
  => rsync /boot/ /mnt/clone/boot  ...rsync: write failed on "/mnt/clone/boot/kernel7l.img": No space left on dev                           ice (28)
rsync error: error in file IO (code 11) at receiver.c(374) [receiver=3.1.3]

===============================

I now know this is due to the increased boot partition size of Buster. RPI-CLONE was happily creating clones with variable ROOT partition sizes but always leaving the source BOOT partition alone and a STRETCH BOOT partition is too small for BUSTER. Finally twigged that the first clone must be made using GPARTED. It would be SO much better if RPI-clone had an option to force resizing inc changing th BOOT partition as I ended up guessing for BUSTER BOOT (and by the look of it got it right) at around 130MB with a gap after - as I said all a bit guesswork.
