**Describe the bug**
When I open the picker, the default time selected (current time) is clipped underneath the date selection. I am using the default width / height.

```
 picker = DateTimePicker.create(minimumDate: min, maximumDate: max)
            picker.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 250, width: picker.frame.size.width, height: picker.frame.size.height)
            picker.is12HourFormat = false
            picker.dateFormat = "dd/MM/YYYY HH:mm"
```

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Add DatePicker to view using 24H Format.

**Expected behavior**
See 2nd screenshot.

**Screenshots**
1st screenshot is what I see everytime. 2nd screenshot is what I expect.

Hi there,

for me I need bit more functionality. Therefor I added two more collection views. One for years and one for month. For Performance reasons. I couldn't use include dates. Only range with min and max. But to have same effect, you can pass exclude dates. Please can you also check if code is ok and functionality is correct ?

Hi. I didnt find the method to include second in timepicker, can u give some suggest? Thanks
How do I set an hourly.  I tried dateTimePicker.timeInterval = DateTimePicker.MinuteInterval(rawValue: 60)! but it does not like that.

Also how do I only allow selection of 8am - 5pm
We can have a switch or a selection kind of a thing on the left hand side on the current date view. Where the user can select the view he/she wants something like the Samsung calendar(Attaching screenshots for the same). The date / month / year selection will become extremely easy and the UX is gonna be brilliant. 
Let me know if this works for you. I really love you library though

Add a calendar icon on the left of the label "Today". when press the icon button, the day's collectionView can be covered by a calendar collectionView, then you can scroll the collection view to picker the day you want.

Considering the needs for different application:
1)  if the user will just pick a day next several month or pre several month, the calendar view may be the best choice, it just need feel click to pick the date. 
2) if the user need to locate  the day quite far away from today, the picker may be better


is it possible to show only the selected time in the Time interval?
like what i need is as follows 
8:00 AM
8:30 AM
9:00 AM
9:30 AM
.
.
.
12:00 PM
Hi, I want to know if its possible to add an option to use custom data apart from dates like an array of names, it would be awesome, thanks.
