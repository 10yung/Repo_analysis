I think the documentation for the project should be in Markdown and versioned under the repo. As it stands, the maintainer is the one that has to change the documentation from the original file. As the project continues on, this could be strenuous for no good reason. Version the docs as a non-PDF allow other contributors to keep the documentation as up-to-date as possible.
