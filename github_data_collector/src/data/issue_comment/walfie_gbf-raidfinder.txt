Many invalid raid names are showing up. Some examples:

Lately I've been having problems with people not joining my raids even if I tweet them. After testing last night with myself and friend, neither of us could see my raid. I can see it on the https://gbf-raidfinder.la-foret.me raidfinder, but for whatever reason not on http://gbf-raidfinder.aikats.us/. Tested 3 different times and it never showed up for either of us. 

when using http://gbf-raidfinder.aikats.us/

you will see this pop up in the js console:

> HtmlHelpers.scala:40 [Deprecation] Using the Notification API on insecure origins is deprecated and will be removed in M61, around September 2017. You should consider switching your application to a secure origin, such as HTTPS. See https://goo.gl/rStTGz for more details.

so likely in this month, the Notifications while using this website will likely be broken in Chrome at some point.




* On iPhone plus series and smaller (414px and lower)
  * Default column width is screen width
  * Min column width is half of screen width, enabling two column layout
* On portrait tablet (768px to 415px)
  * Default column width is half of screen width
  * Min column width is third of screen width, enable three column layout

Pushed and tested at my heroku, might need more testing. Also, my first time writing Scala, were you to accept this idea, feel free to rewrite the code.
Unless i'm at the page and click a notification, it never copies the code. For example, if i'm browsing tweetdeck or any other site except raidfinder, clicking on notification does nothing.

However if i'm at the raidfinder site and click on the notification for raids, it works and copies the code.

As mentioned, it's an issue with Firefox. I tested with chrome and it was fine with it. I hope you can look into it. 
Idk if it's just me having this problem but it worked the first time i clicked the desktop notification to copy the raid ID, but it hasn't worked since (i.e. it only worked once, doesn't copy raid ID ever again on subsequent notifications)

I am using Firefox on Windows 7
If a boss isn't seen in 12 hours, it's removed from the boss list. This helps remove event bosses from the list after events are over. Some low level bosses also get tweeted so infrequently that they get removed. The bug is that they don't come back if someone tweets the English version of the boss, only the Japanese one.

This doesn't matter too much since the bosses that people care about are fine, but might be nice to address.
