Hi,

it would be cool when you add support for jumphosts. I add it dirty, but maybe i forgot something...

```
while getopts "p:k:f:DXchJ:" o; do
  case ${o} in
    J)
      SSH_JH="-J${OPTARG} "
      SCP_JH="-oProxyJump=${OPTARG} "
      ;;
```

```
mbacks-mbp:xiringuito mbacks$ grep "_JH" xiringuito 
      SSH_JH="-J${OPTARG} "
      SCP_JH="-oProxyJump=${OPTARG} "
ssh ${SSH_OPTS} ${SSH_JH} ${SSH_SERVER} mkdir -p ${REMOTE_PATH}
scp ${SSH_OPTS} ${SCP_JH} ./scripts/server-*.sh ${SSH_SERVER}:${REMOTE_PATH} >/dev/null
ssh ${SSH_OPTS} ${SSH_JH} ${SSH_SERVER} ${REMOTE_PATH}/server-setup.sh ${TUNNEL_ID} ${IP_BASE}
ssh ${SSH_OPTS} ${SSH_JH} ${SSH_SERVER} pkill -f ${REMOTE_PATH}/server-execute.sh &>/dev/null
${SSH_TUNNEL_CMD} ${SSH_JH} ${SSH_OPTS} -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -w ${LOCAL_TUNNEL_ID}:${TUNNEL_ID} ${SSH_SERVER} ${REMOTE_PATH}/server-execute.sh ${TUNNEL_ID} ${IP_BASE} ${MAX_FAILED_PINGS} &
mbacks-mbp:xiringuito mbacks$ 
```

best regards,

Hello!
I run command

How can I connect through the created tunnel?
#### This project is kinda stuck üòü 

As a big Bash script, it is poorly maintainable, fragile and thus has not future.

I don't want to abandon its development, cause it has some users and a set of distinctive features: https://github.com/ivanilves/xiringuito#whats-the-difference-between-xiringuito-and-sshuttle üîç 

I see the only way to provide a quality change - rewrite it in a statically compiled language https://github.com/ivanilves/xiringuito/issues/56 - other ways are possible - I mean use a minimal Bash to bootstrap some existing third-party VPN on both client and server, and maybe anything else I overlooked... ü§î 

I'm very open for a discussion or any kind of advice. üôè 
I want a IPv6 only tunnel will this work? I didn't see anything in the documentation about IPv6.
not easy, but could we also get rid of the local sudo?

making xiringuito both local and remote sudoless would provide much more confidence to users
cause this is obvious security flaw
It would be cool to have `xaval` commands auto-complete for shell (UX matters).
Xiringuito is a "pure Bash".

Could it continue like that?

Maybe we need to rewrite it in ... Golang? :thinking:
