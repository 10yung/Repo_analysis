Hello Guys!

Thanks a million for this stuff!!!

If I don't use Laravel, I guess I can still use this SDK. Where and how do I define 'Telegram'  => Telegram\Bot\Laravel\Facades\Telegram::class ?

I installed the sdk via composer

Thanks in advance



@irazasyed Hey! Happy new year,

If we're going to require > php 7.2 in composer.json, should we not also remove the travis CI checks for php versions below that?
Would anyone have an example of how a nested entity looks when an update object is received?

At the moment I can only find example of multi entities per update, not NESTED entities. To add the feature to the latest API 4.5, I would like to have a proper sample to test code against. Then I can add it to https://github.com/irazasyed/telegram-bot-sdk/pull/699


At the moment, multiple entities per update look something like this:
```json
{
	"update_id": 79107515,
	"message": {
		"message_id": 9906,
		"from": {
			"id": 99999999,
			"is_bot": false,
			"first_name": "Jonathan",
			"last_name": "Williamson",
			"username": "",
			"language_code": "en"
		},
		"chat": {
			"id": 99999999,
			"first_name": "Jonathan",
			"last_name": "Williamson",
			"username": "",
			"type": "private"
		},
		"date": 1578044613,
		"text": "These are multiple entities https://github.com",
		"entities": [
			{
				"offset": 0,
				"length": 5,
				"type": "italic"
			},
			{
				"offset": 10,
				"length": 8,
				"type": "bold"
			},
			{
				"offset": 28,
				"length": 18,
				"type": "url"
			}
		]
	}
}
```


Anyone have anything similar for the nested option?

Thank you
I send messages via **sendMessage** to a chat that has been deleted by the user or to an unknown chat. When using curl I get json response immediately and without problems. But if I use the **sendMessage** method, the error 
**"The Response content must be a string or object implementing __toString (), "boolean" given."** 
in
**\symfony\http-foundation\Response.php " line 401** 
In this case, the request is executed for a very long time. About 10 seconds
code:
`$message = [
            'chat_id' => 888888888,
            'text'    => 'test',
        ];`
`$api  = new Api($token);
$api->sendMessage($message);`

Hi
When telegram server have problems your class wait i think by default about 40 sec, so all php scripts are going down.

Is there any way to set up timeout of sending msg?

Thanks a lot! 
In the "sendMediaGroup" method the "inputFileField" key has been incorrectly set as "video_note" instead of "media". Also, since the "media" field is JSON serialized string and not an input field, as mentioned in the Telegram API Docs, I updated the "validateInputFileField" in "Traits/Http.php" class to support this case.
Thanks.

```$this->update->hasCommand()``` return false for all type of messages 

but 
```
$this->update->getMessage()->get('entities', collect())->contains('type', 'bot_command')
```
return true for command types

I use v3


is there another way to check update is command or not?
*141# appears as text without link

`$text = '<a href="tel:*141#"> *141# </a> vs <a href="google.com"> *142# </a>';
	$url= "https://api.telegram.org/bot".$token."/sendMessage?chat_id=".$chat_id."&text=".urlencode($text)."&parse_mode=HTML";`
