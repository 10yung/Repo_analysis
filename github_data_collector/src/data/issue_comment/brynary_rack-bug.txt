**NOTE**: @brynary and I have discussed and agree that we'd like to merge the projects rack-bug and rack-insight together.
- rack-bug panels work _now_ in rack-insight ([let me know if otherwise](https://github.com/pboling/rack-insight/issues), please!)
- rack-insight is currently fully functional / working with Rails 3 & 4 as of [version 0.5.30](https://rubygems.org/gems/rack-insight)

I forked LogicalInsight (which was a substantial rewrite itself) and rewrote it to be _much_ better.  We are moving towards a kick-ass merger/migration between the venerable Rack::Bug and the new Rack::Insight.  Spec suite has also been updated!

My next major goal is to spit each panel out into it's own gem so the panel's dependencies can be managed separately, since they are very version specific, and there is no need for `/rack-(bug|insight)/` to be tied down to dependencies of dependencies.  Rather panels should support a specific, versioned, `/rack-(bug|insight)/` panel API.

Hi,

I couldn't find out what I have to do to show RackBug in my App. The toolbar is showing fine when i go to:
http://localhost:3000/**rack_bug**/bookmarklet.html

But I did not understand how to make it show up in my apps.

A clarification in the README would be helpful.

Thanks
Fed.

on the "sql queries" tab the actions: SELECT | EXPLAIN | Profile
are not doing anything, when i click on them nothing happends.

is something wrong or is that the way its suppose to be?

Fixes #20

Hi ,

My issue is as follows:

The rack-bug plugin works well in my local system (development environment), but when I installed the same in our server ( staging environment), the following is displayed without problems:

Toggle Rack::Bug

is displayed, and when I click it, it asks for the password, but after that nothing happens... it remains the same....

following are the steps I have done:
1.  script/plugin install git://github.com/brynary/rack-bug.git
2.  require 'ipaddr'
   ActionController::Dispatcher.middleware.use "Rack::Bug",
   :ip_masks   => [IPAddr.new("127.0.0.1"), IPAddr.new("mynetwork'sPublicAddressAsSeenByTheServer"), 
   , 
   :secret_key => "RgXEMzQVJkZ5YKL8YKhO5EXR3EkrXtoJyUekAVB4ceAbccRGEO+uCLN0G88gB/e",
   :password   => "123"
   1.  touch tmp/restart.txt 
   2.  From local browser:  http://SERVERNAME/**rack_bug**/bookmarklet.html

now, the issue arises as mentioned in the beginning.  

Seeking your assistance regarding this.

Thanks

Paste-friendly :D

I used this a long time ago when still using Rails 2.3.x, and I liked it very much. Now I'd like to use it on my new Rails 3.1 project, but I see no updates, it's more than one year that Rails 3.0 is out and the master branch still points to 2.3.x version.

I've tried it (rails3 branch) in a 3.1 (with Ruby 1.9.2) project and I get this error: 

```
Encoding::CompatibilityError (incompatible character encodings: UTF-8 and US-ASCII):
```

I saw that is the same error of #7 which is still pending.

Is there any chance that this project will be updated to support recent versions of Rails?

Hi there,

Great work on this plugin! I did find that when I have, let's say, 50 sql queries going on in a page, there is no way for me to scroll down the page past the initial 10 or so queries that are displayed.

Here's a workaround. In your web browser such as Firefox, when viewing the page of sql queries select the browser menu option File->Save Page As. By saving the page to a html file you can then open it. It will look a bit ugly but all the queries will be there - and timings!

Would be nice to fix this.

Declan

When I click the bookmarklet and type my password, the toolbar does not appear. Hard-refreshing the page makes the toolbar appear.

Digging in to the source, I see that @response.ok? returns false, because the status code is 304 (Not Modified) instead of 200. One way around this I used was to strip "HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH" from the env before passing on the request, so the etag would not match.

Hi,

The branch at http://github.com/ketan/rack-bug/tree/filter-panel contains some support for rendering the timings on rails before/after/around filters.

I understand that this may not quite be upto any rack-bug standards, so I'm open to any feedback to help improve this patch.

Thanks for a great plugin!
