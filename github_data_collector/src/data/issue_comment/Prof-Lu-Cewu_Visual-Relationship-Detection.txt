Helloï¼Œyour paper help me a lot and I want to build my own dataset. But I don't know how to generate the json file conveniently. Do you have any tools to generate them(like labelImg).
look forward to your reply.

Hi,

Can you share with us the data for evaluating the zero-shot learning and image retrieval as stated in the paper?

Best,
Hello,How train Union CNN Score? Can you release the training code?
Hi, 

Thanks for the code. It is a great work!

But can you also provide the training code? Then we can train our own W and b in Eq. (2).
And is that possible to provide your pre-trained model for the object detection and predicates prediction model, so we can extract the 'objectDetRCNN.mat' and 'UnionCNNfeaPredicate.mat' for our own images.

Thanks!
