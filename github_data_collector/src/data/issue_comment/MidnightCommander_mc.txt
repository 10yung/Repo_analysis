- RealPlayer is a proprietary application which can't be installed in most distros and has long been abandoned
- gtv hasn't been developed since 2003
- xanim barely plays anything

Rationale:
1) Most new PCs don't contain CD/DVD drives which means distros don't include isoinfo or similar tools
2) p7zip is a lot more powerful for processing ISOs as it can extract boot record(s) and other info which isoinfo doesn't see/understand
when i checked the option to hide mini_status bar, 
i noticed there were still some stuffs getting displayed at that place.
for example: 
- currently highlighted (but unselected ) file size,
- total selected files size

this PR try to ensure nothing gets displayed in the 'mini_status bar' when it is set to be hidden.
otherwise when the mini_status bar is not set to be hidden, then everything is just as usual.

it works fine here, ymmv, this PR may suddenly harms some kittens at random (you've been warned).


ncurses on Solaris11.4 provides ncurses/term.h and HAVE_NCURSES_TERM_H need to be defined to compile tty-ncurses successfully

`modarcon16` skin is lovely and comfortable, but it has annoying
feature: editor whitespaces (i.e. tabs and trailing spaces) are
not consistent with other parts of skin, they're bright on blue.

This fix makes them green on black background.
