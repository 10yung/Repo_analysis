### Expected behavior

Present a clear error message to users if environment has disabled `system` and/or `exec` builtin PHP functions, and interrupt the execution before attempting to use such disabled functions.

### Actual behavior

Right now nothing stops the execution, and it fails much later with a "Command did not produce any output" exception.
Only warnings are shown:
```
<b>Warning</b>:  system() has been disabled for security reasons in ...
<b>Warning</b>:  exec() has been disabled for security reasons in ...
```

### Steps to reproduce the behavior

1. Disable `system` and/or `exec` in `php.ini`
https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.disable-functions
2. Try to run any TesseractOCR example.

#### Environment

* Operating system: `any`
* PHP version: `any`
* Tesseract version: `any`
* tesseract-ocr-for-php version: `2.7.4 or lower`
