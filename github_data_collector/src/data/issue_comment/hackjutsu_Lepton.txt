#### Environment info
* OS: Windows 10
* App Version (`Command/Ctrl + ,`): I just downloaded it and haven't logged in yet so I don't know!

#### Description of the problem / feature request / question:
I use a yubikey for [2 factor auth](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication#configuring-two-factor-authentication-using-a-security-key) on github.  After I click "Use security key" in the login dialog, nothing happens.

What should happen is that Windows prompts me for my security key...this is how it works through the github website.

#### If possible, provide a sample gist or screenshot:

Which command must I use to install Lepton as I'm using RedHat; and since I'm installing Lepton on a self-hosted git is there anything else I should know ?

Need to double check but it seems the autoupdate is not working.
https://github.com/hackjutsu/Lepton/issues/379

We'll have to update some labels and ensure the backward compatibility of the original `private` config in leptonrc.

#### Environment info
* OS: macOS Mojave 10.14.6
* App Version (`Command/Ctrl + ,`): 1.8.1

#### Description of the problem / feature request / question:

First time install, DMG image copy to Applications folder.
Login seems to work (I see the login page and then the 2nd auth page) but after that the error "Sync failed: Please check your network connections" appears.

I can access github, gists, etc pages from my system perfectly fine.

Solution:
-Do not clear the state of tags and Private/Public checkbox after submit.
When adding new gist, after pasting the code, i can not go to private checkbox or '#add file' input without using mouse (Because tab used for indentation in the text area). This slows down the saving process.

Solutions: 
- Checkbox can be added before the code textarea. (Not a solution for '#add file' input)
- A shortcut can be added to quit text area.

#### Description of the problem / feature request / question:
本地修改完之前的gists之后点击提交或者Ctrl+S保存，然后刚写的就丢失了，还是原来的gists。
是因为网络比较差吗？
