SSE requests (`text/event-stream`) don't work properly (no events are transmitted to the client) if `proxy.gzip.contenttype` is non-nil and gzip is in the `Accept-Encoding` header, because under those conditions the response gets chained through `GzipResponseWriter` even if no compression is being done. This change will bypass the `GzipResponseWriter` if there is a `Accept: text/event-stream` header.
I have my secure service running on HTTPs using following options.
```
new HttpServerOptions().
		setSsl(true).
		setClientAuth(ClientAuth.required).
		setKeyStoreOptions(
			new JksOptions().
				setPath("Certificate.jks").
				setPassword("password")
		
		).
		setTrustStoreOptions(
			new JksOptions().
				setPath("ca_cs_combined_prod.jks").
				setPassword("password")
		)
```

When i connect to my service at https:\\localhost:8080\getToken using chrome i get pop up to select certificate and after selecting certificate i am able to call this service fine.

I have registered my service in consul with proto=https option.

But i am unable to call this service using fabio.  My use case here is service registered in Consul is HTTPs and fabio is runing with HTTP and not as HTTPs. Is it possible to call this upstream HTTPs service such as http:\\localhost:9999\getToken. How to use jks certificates with fabio?

With current set up of i try to query my HTTPS upstream service using fabio i am getting folowwing error:
cannot validate certificate for ipadress because it doesn't contain any ip sans

Hi folks,

Using `log.routes.format = all`, the Fabio logs appear to be broken:

```

```

Changing to `log.routes.format = delta`, it doesn't actually show anything at all in logs.

Only `log.routes.format = detail` seems to work now.

Thanks in advance
Can we use fabio as gateway service? And is it possible to create cliuster of fabio?
All good things come to an end. 

## History 

Fabio started as a small 350 line load-balancing experiment during my time at eBay in Amsterdam to replace our insane load-balancer setup and worked much, much better than I expected. It made routing dirt simple and pushed the responsibility for the route to the service instead of coordinating releases between micro-services and the DevOps team.

It also hit some sweet spot for the HashiCorp Consul users which now had a super-simple consul-enabled load balancer and HashiCorp noticed very quickly. 

This was 2015, with go1.5 and consul 0.7. My team was the largest Go team in Amsterdam and to the best of my knowledge we were the only ones running large scale, big money, production critical stuff on Go. Very exciting times. 

Fabio would have probably never seen the light of open-source, if there wouldn't have been @emilevauge with https://github.com/containous/traefik and my colleagues pushing me to open-source Fabio. I got mocked for the choice of name (b/c of the italian actor) but that died off quite quickly when the Github stars were flying in. Emile and I even met briefly during a Go conference in Paris where I presented the project for a couple of minutes. Fun times and some healthy competition ;)

I've added features that were helpful to us and others. Was involved in long-winded discussions in what should and should not be in the project and probably neglected to build a more active community of committers around the project. Maintaining an open-source project is a lot of work. It does not get easier if it becomes somewhat successful.

For a long time Fabio had a leg on HAProxy because of reloads without restarts. For an even longer time it had one on Traefik because of the TCP proxy with SNI support. (https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/933). I remember writing that code, forking the Go TLS code and getting something working in a couple of lines which was so useful.

## You are all awesome!

Joyent added features to Fabio like the grpc-proxy and countless contributors have found bugs, workarounds, fixes, features, improvements and the project has become bigger and more successful than I could have ever imagined. 

With 10 million Docker pulls Fabio seems to be driving some serious websites. I got insane performance numbers with Fabio running on a 24-core machine from some companies where Fabio replaced an expensive load-balancer for free. 

But times change, @emilevauge went ahead and built @containous around traefik, [HAproxy](https://haproxy.org) can handle reloads without restarts and [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) with the awesome auto-TLS came along. 

I've got an offer to turn Fabio into a company and turned it down, then worked for HashiCorp for a while and left again, now working full time on batteries and injecting Go into the industrial manufacturing industry. 

I've moved on - mentally - and also in terms of my commitment. Without the extraordinary help of @leprechau and @pschultz over the last year the project would be in much worse shape. 

I think it is time to let go and find **a new maintainer**. If we can't find one then this project needs to go to the software graveyard.

I've never done this before so I'm curious who would be interested and what to look out for. 

Thank you all!!!

The current tracing implementation sets the `operationName` of every fabio span to the configured tracing service name. This makes it difficult to distinguish between traces in the Jaeger UI, as seen here (this is with `FABIO_TRACING_SERVICENAME` set to `fabio`):

I have opened https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/pull/715 to add more description to the operation name.
