if the last item matches the condition and i changed phone for wrong phone number for example it doesn't disable button

`
        combine(
            phoneEt.textChanges().map { Patterns.PHONE.matcher(it).matches() },
            passowrdEt.textChanges().map { it.length >= 4 },
            transform = { phone, password -> phone && password }
        ).onEach { loginBtn.isEnabled = it }.launchIn(CoroutineScope(coroutineContext))`
