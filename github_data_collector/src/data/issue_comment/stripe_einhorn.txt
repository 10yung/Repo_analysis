address flag contains 'u' means UDP, for example:
einhorn -b 0.0.0.0:3000,r,u -b 0.0.0.0:3000,r -m manual  -p ./web_server.rb -n 8 -- ./web_server.rb

`config` seems to be a no-op, at least for the `max_unacked` and `max_upgrade_additional` settings

To reproduce:
`sudo einhornsh -c $SERVICE -e state`
`sudo einhornsh -c $SERVICE -e 'config max_unacked: 10` (where 10 is any new value)
`sudo einhornsh -c $SERVICE -e state` (and see that nothing changed)

@evan-stripe pointed out that it looks like `config` is merging changed values into the wrong place
I'd like to use einhorn to do seamless reloading of some processes but I'm using various programs that expect something different than a SIGUSR2 for a graceful shutdown.

It would be nice if the graceful shutdown signal could be specified on the command line. 

Thoughts?
Also removing now-unused `README.md.in`

For some time now the usage has been carefully described in `README.md` rather than extracted from `bin/einhorn -h`
Hi, do you have plans to publish v0.7.5 to rubygems.org?

Thanks.
As mentioned in #58, this adds support for bound sockets being UNIX domain sockets. This is something that I needed for an application on our end and think might be generally useful. This works by extending the regex in argument parsing to accept filenames that don't have colons in them as UNIX domain sockets. The `state.bind` stuff is then modified to be inet or unix bind objects which abstracts out the logic of how to create/bind each type of socket properly. If binding the socket results in `EADDRINUSE`, we'll do the connect, stat, unlink dance to try and clean up old dead sockets. The address family is added to the child environment for each socket so that workers can know which family to bind with more easily.

Issues/questions:
- ~~I can't get the tests to run locally without errors with or without this patch, so I'm not clear on their status. Will check with Travis once that runs.~~ It looks like the tests are failing to install packages etc. on various versions, but where they install everything is checking out.
- There's some duplication between the command socket binding/cleanup code and the unix socket cleanup code in this patch. I wasn't clear how I could de-duplicate this and maintain the descriptive error messages.
- I'm not super fond of the bind.rb file or how that stuff is structured, if you've any alternatives I'm all ears.
- I've tested in place upgrades but there might be more cases I'm not thinking about there.

I've an application that I'd like to run under Einhorn. It currently binds a UNIX socket and then an SSL-terminating nginx sitting on the same box talks to the service over that socket. This is a websocket service so it's designed to have tonnes of open sockets and using UNIX domain sockets for the nginx<->service bridge gives us a lot more headroom. Would it be possible for Einhorn to be able to bind UNIX sockets as well?

I'm happy to write the code for this (have taken a short crack at it already) but I'm a) not great at ruby, and b) would probably need some handholding on making sure the in-place upgrades are OK with the changes. If I do write it would this be something you'd want to merge?

Hello

I do not know how to achieve a seamless restart Goliath.
Please give me some advice, thank you!

I now see this pretty consistently:

```
[MASTER 34636] ERROR: Could not find any config for exited child 34672! This probably indicates a bug in Einhorn.
```

Looks like it was introduced in: https://github.com/stripe/einhorn/commit/673f5a8a6e909766eb7db381dd736b975dc8a8c1. Sounds like we had a race before, but I think this means we have a race still.

@ebroder, what would you think about de-racing by making the state_passer live past the SIGCHLD handler install? I'd guess that would mean either (a) installing the SIGCHLD handle before loading state — though I haven't checked if there's a chicken and an egg there — or (b) having some coordination mechanism between the state_passer and the master. Thoughts?

Saw the following in logs when trying to kick off ~40 einhorns at the same time.
