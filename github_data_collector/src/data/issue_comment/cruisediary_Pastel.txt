This adds a `Package.swift` so that the library can be installed using Swift Package Manager.
Can't seem to find where it prints the above message. 
My controller includes a ImagePickerController, as soon as that displays, the background stops animating. Any ideas why? and how can i make it move again when the imagePicker dismisses

I have a button in my app which has a "random gradient" functionality.

How can I remove any existing gradient on the screen and replace it with a new one?

I don't see any functionality in the api code which will allow us to set new gradients without removing the entire view and re-adding it to the screen.
It was working on first view controller. But when i use this on other view controllers on same story board and on other story board, just animated once and than stopped. 
Do I have to set up the specific view controllers?
Wherever someone leaves my app and lets it go into the background, when they then later open the app, the gradient is no longer cycling.

Is there away to restore the state the gradient was in before being sent to background?

thank you.

I think I should be able to do it with `func applicationDidBecomeActive(_ application: UIApplication) {` but I don't know how
I tested application with xcode profiler.

Result is this

I think the problem is when CGColor objects are creating every animationGradient call.

Maybe caching the objects will solve it ?! 
When running a gradient animation on one ViewController, is it possible to continue the same animation from its current state on a different ViewController upon transitioning?
