The following also allow code exec in PHP:

- proc_open()
- popen()
- backticks: \`cmd\`
I came across this endpoint in the wild, it was called by a Swagger UI to render the documentation for an API.

Can we add this to one of the lists? I didn't want to open a PR as I don't know which file (maybe more than 1?) would be best.
Maybe Discovery/Web-Content/quickhits.txt? or Fuzzing/fuzz-Bo0oM.txt?
The latter one already has api/swagger-ui.html, swagger-ui.html, swagger.json, etc which are related.
Hi,
How about to create wordlist in Discovery/Web-Content/CMS with unique endpoints of most popular CMSs to fingerprint usage of them?
It should contain non-security-impact endpoints than usually should not be hidden - such as common static file paths, etc in the reason of most accurate fingerprinting.
Lots of apps have requirements for passwords to be "complex" and contain upper-, lowercase, special character and to be at least 8-10 chars long. So brute forcing any of them with passwords that won't satisfy those requirements is pointless (until we are targeting old account with unchanged passwords in apps that didn't require users to change them)
So I thought it would be a good idea to create a list of complex passwords for that purpose.
- at least, that could be done by searching those passwords inside present common lists
- the best option will be to search leaked DBs for complex passwords since they won't appear in most "top" list because they probably are less common than 1-10 million others.
I've got this cloned onto my system and the directory takes up 778M of which 380M is the .git directory.  This seems excessive.  Might it be worthwhile to run garbage collection and pruning to reduce this down a bit?  Or is there a valid reason to keep it all that I'm missing?

Maybe run something like what is suggested here:

Many of the XSS payload files are not directly consumable by fuzzing applications, such as Burp Intruder. I think it would be great if there were seperate fuzzing files to the discussion files. For example, Mario's XSS file is AWESOME and so advanced that it's akin to magic, but it takes a bit of work to use within tools. 

How best to help you guys with this?
