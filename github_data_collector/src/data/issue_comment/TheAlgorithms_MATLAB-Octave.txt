This repo needs more algorithms. If you see any missing algorithms, kindly contribute.
Hackotberfest participants are welcome! 
I will list some of the algorithms that are up for grabs. However, please check if the algorithm
is already in our repo before you begin working.
Feel free to help me add more items to the list. If you have any questions, ask away!


**Some Guidelines**:
1. Please create 1 pull request per algorithm for ease of review.
2. Please **do not plagiarise**. Implementations must be your own. If you have used help from some article (say Wikipedia), give credit in your script in a comment.
3. Give a brief explanation/links of what your script does.
4. Give helpful comments where you deem necessary. Don't add comments where it's trivial such as  `x = y + z % adds two numbers` or is unnecessary.
5. Use proper variable names and filename. If you are working on prime check, please use a proper file name such as **prime_check.m** rather than **primec.m** 
6. Incase your algorithm required multiple files, create a subdirectory, for example, the kmeans algorithm requires two files, so we have a subdirectory for it. Try not to add unnecessary files.
7. **This repo is for educational purposes. Please keep that in mind when you are working on a contribution to this repo.**
8. Following [this](https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46056-matlab-style-guidelines-2-0?s_tid=mwa_osa_a) coding style guideline is recommended for all PRs.
