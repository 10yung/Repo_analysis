The v3 docs link should point to https://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/
For startDate I use:
```
      $('.datepicker').pickadate(
          {
              format: 'ddd, dd mmm, yyyy',
              formatSubmit: 'mm/dd/yyyy',
              hiddenSuffix: ''
          })
```
 works fine.

But startTime:
```
      $('.timepicker').pickatime(
          {
              // format: 'H:i A',
              formatSubmit: 'H:i',
              hiddenSuffix: '',
          }
      )
```
fails.

I tried adding ```xx``` as a suffix and that worked fine but any thing like ```name=startT``` with suffix ```ime``` would not pass a value through.

So I either have to use an unfriendly time format for users, fiddle about with it PHP on arrival or fiddle about in jQuery to convert. 

_In passing, the time scroll works fine on touch screens but on a PC/Mac etc it is a bit of a pain. Any chance of perhaps one solution for screens of a certain size and different for others._

Finally thanks for a pretty stable timedate solution. Been through lots of others and they all seem to need fine tuning of jQuery version, Bootstrap version or something else.

Hello

I hope you can help. I am trying to disable dates from a variable which is generated from a AJAX request. The result of the request is the dates which I am trying to disable. I have then removed the double quotes which I think should not be there:

var formattedDisabledDates = JSON.stringify(data_disable_dates.dates);
var formattedDisabledDates = formattedDisabledDates.replace(/['"]+/g, '');

The output in console log for formattedDisabledDates is as follows:
[[2019,12,25],[2019,12,26],[2020,01,01],[2020,04,10],[2020,04,13],[2020,05,08],[2020,05,25],[2020,08,31],[2020,12,25],[2020,12,26],[2020,12,27],[2020,12,28],[2021,01,01]]

If i paste that into here:
pickerPU.set('disable', #here#);
it works fine and all the dates are disabled correctly.

If I replace it with the variable:
pickerPU.set('disable', formattedDisabledDates);

I get an error back:
Uncaught TypeError: datesToDisable.map is not a function 
this is from the picker.date.js file

The only way I can get in to work is using eval(formattedDisabledDates) but this is considered unsafe?

What am I doing wrong, can anyone help?
Not sure if this can be done now by simply changing a setting or if this is a new feature request.

I would like to display 2 months at a time (the current month plus the next one), stacked one on top of the other.  When the user clicks on the right arrow, the bottom month would become the top, and it would load the next month on the bottom.

When using firstDay: 1 to assign Monday as the first day of week, this does not work if you have a custom weekdaysShort.

Hello everybody,
thanks to amsul and all contributors for this nice picker.

I've a doubt related to the enabling/disabling processes.
I really don't get the point with this part of the documentation: https://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/api/#method-set-disable-enable-dates

I want to enable one or more time-ranges and disable one or more ranges or even some specific times.

Why something like this properly works
`
some_obj.pickatime('picker').set({enable:[{from:[7,0],to:[20,0]}], disable:[true, [10,0], {from:[15,0], to:[16,0]}]});
`


and something like this, does not (?)
`
some_obj.pickatime('picker').set({enable:[{from:[7,0],to:[10,0]},{from:[13,0],to:[20,0]}], disable:[[15,0]]});
`

Is there a way to make it working, specifically changing the logic of the enable/disable properties?
Thank you!


Hi,

My goal in to have a button that triggers the datepicker but I don't want the input to trigger the datepicker only the button but if it's not the input that triggers the datepicker the input is not updated with the new date I pick. 

Any ideas ?

Thanks

Docs: https://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/v5/
We use pickadate.js version 3.5.6 on a restaurant website for receiving reservations. It has been working correctly for months, but yesterday we received a reservation with the following date:

    201-06-02

The date the user selected (formatted in their locale by pickadate):

    giovedì 20 giugno 2019

The correct date submitted should have been `2019-06-20`.

I'm not able to reproduce this issue, so I'm hoping someone reads this and has some idea what's going on. Perhaps it's related to #1089?

Here's the HTML:

```html
<form …>
    <input type="text" name="date" class="reserve-date">
    <input type="hidden" name="date_for_display">
    <!-- etc … -->
</form>

<script type="text/javascript" src="js/pickadate/lib/compressed/picker.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/pickadate/lib/compressed/picker.date.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/pickadate/lib/compressed/picker.time.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/pickadate/lib/compressed/legacy.js"></script>
```

Here's the JS:

```javascript
var $pickadate = $('.reserve-date').pickadate({
    formatSubmit: 'yyyy-mm-dd',
    hiddenName: true,
    disable: [
        1,
        { from: -120, to: d },
        { from: [2019,0,1], to: [2019,2,21] },
        { from: [2020,0,7], to: [2020,2,19] }
    ],
    onSet: function (c) {
        $('input[name="date_for_display"]').val(this.get());
    }
});
```
