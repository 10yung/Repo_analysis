In my repository, TLS version was upgraded and path property was added 
It works well with `express` and `socket.io` in `node.js` as the server.  
*Upgrade TLS version
*Update CMake install directories

Hello.

I cannot get this simple test work. I wrote the client in C++ and the server in NodeJS, both running on my computer. When I execute the client application, the console outputs this text...but the event 'key' is never fired on the server!

Client console output:
> Error: No active session
> [2019-11-21 17:30:11] [connect] Successful connection
> [2019-11-21 17:30:11] [connect] WebSocket Connection 127.0.0.1:9876 v-2 "WebSocket++/0.8.1" /socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=websocket&t=1574353811 101

Â¿Anyone knows what am I doing wrong?

Thanks in advance.

C++ client
```
#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>

#include <sio_client.h>

using namespace sio;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	sio::client io;
	io.connect("http://127.0.0.1:9876");
	
	string command = "w";

	io.socket()->emit("key", command );
	
}
```

NodeJS server
```
'use strict';

const express     = require('express');
const app         = express();
const serverHttp  = require('http').Server(app); 
const io = require('socket.io')(serverHttp);

const port = 9876;

io.on('connection', function (socket) {   
    // Never fired :(
    socket.on('key', function (data) {
        console.log("key received!!!");
    });
});

serverHttp.listen(port, function() {  
    console.log("init!!!");    
});
```

Is it possible to send message to the client from socket.io server cpp (found here: https://github.com/mrudangit/Socket.IO.Server.CPP ?)
I got complex template compile error when using boost 1.71. 
This repo has stopped update since Oct. 2017, so I write the solution here:
Use boost 1.69. (I didn't test 1.70). 
Download prebuilt boost library from https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/.
Install.
Configure cmake as INSTALL.md says.
This solution is inspired by https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-cpp/issues/212#issuecomment-524463252.
I have socket.io-cpp client working on Ubuntu 16.04 and have a server working in version 0.9.17

Is there an old socket.io-cpp client version that is compatible with the server side or do I have to update my serverside? 

Hope I'm not repeating any old question. Thanks for your help!
I was unable to build it on MSVC 2015, maybe it breaks some other compilers too

Anyone run into this yet?
