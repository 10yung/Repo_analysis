Hi,

I started by using MultiPeer Connectivity directly and I have faced multiple issues concerning file exchange. For instance, I can send files only up to 5m distance between two nodes. Beyond this distance, file exchange is not possible. 
Also, I try sending files of different sizes, ranging from 1KB to 10MB. Something, file exchange hangs with 5MB files and sometimes it works flawlessly.
Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I could not find any paper or document giving information about the limitations etc of MPC. I know it is based on Bluetooth and Wifi and, thus, should have the same performances as these technologies but if someone has any information about that, I'll be happy to have them.
Thanks a lot.
Hi,

Is there any example demonstrating file exchange using PeerKit? Stackoverflow is [almost empty](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=peerkit) concerning PeerKit unfortunately.
Thanks.
Hey @jpsim, your lib is awesome but your README lacks information.
I created this [iOS README template](https://github.com/awesome-labs/iOS-readme-template) to help you out ðŸ˜‰ 
This would make sure that the documentation in `README` works as expected
How does the connection between the devices work exactly ? :) Just curious :) 
I have set up PeerKit as per the example from the Cards Against app and have managed to get two devices to connect to each other. 

However, this connection is only successful ~10% of the time. The other times, .onDisconnect is called right away. Is there any reason why this is happening, or am I doing something wrong?

Also, what is the procedure to attempt a reconnection after the connection is unsuccessful? Should I call `.transceive` again after creating a new `Transceiver`?
