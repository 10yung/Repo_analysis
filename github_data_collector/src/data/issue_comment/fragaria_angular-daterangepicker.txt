I have scenarios where there are multiple ranges which have the same min and max dates. In such a case selecting the lower ranges shows that the topmost range with the same dates as selected instead of the one that was actually selected.

Can you help me with this ?
Hi,

In case of custom date range options there is no way to know the label on which user clicked on. 
even thought there is provision provided in the bootstrap daterangepicker it seems there is hook missing in the directive to access that information.
Using version 0.3.0.

If I change the value of clearable (through an AngularJS expression) from `true` to `false`, the `Clear` button label does not change to `Cancel` as it should.
Is there any option for the Hijri calendar? If not, chance in the future?
Addresses #84 and #198 

The only possibly controversial thing is that I've namespaced the package into `@fragaria` organization on NPM. Also, Travis is enabled and should publish automatically to NPM on every pushed tag. 
Hi,

I'm trying to add your date picker (which is great!) to my project in the filters section.

My problem is that the filter box is a small pop-up box on the right. To make your date picker work I had to make the filters wider what's not the best solution as we don't need as much space.

Instead, it will be better to be able to position the calendar with the css or class.

Please have a look at the positioning here:

I've noticed that the position is calculated in JS what makes it much more difficult to adjust.

Many thanks for your work!

Hi,

When setting pre-date values with min, max it gives error 

> angular.js:15018 TypeError: a.startDate.isValid is not a function
    at f.$validators.invalid (angular-daterangepicker.js:266)

```
vm.dateRange = {
            "startDate": moment().toDate(),
            "endDate"  : moment().toDate()
        };

        vm.minDate = moment().subtract(2, "d").toDate();
        vm.maxDate = moment().add(2, "d").toDate();
```

Here is the screenshot of console debug.

Some application does not use the `moment` into global scope, so, implementing a way to specify a custom `moment` declaration in order to have the component working properly.
