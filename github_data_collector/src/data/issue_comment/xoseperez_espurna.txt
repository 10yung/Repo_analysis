Seems like a company called Avatto is selling Tuya power plugs on AliExpress. The model number corresponds to a plug with the same physical appearance from Neo Coolcam but the PIN configuration is not a match.

I have provided a PR of code changes I made to make this device work for me. Take this as a guide line not a complete solution. My experience in Espurna and embedded ESP8266 programing is limited.

PR: https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/pull/2113

My changes has been tested agains v 1.14.1 but not against master nor dev.

Device https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33011753732.html
Support for the Avatto NAS-WR01W with power monitor.

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33011753732.html

Same model number as Neo Coolcam NAS-WR01W but not a match in PINs.
I was not able to find an official homepage for Avatto. Only the "official" shop on AliExpress. But this is a Tuya device.

PINs for Button, Led and Relay have been tested and seems correct. But I have not disassembled the device to verify. The power monitor settings where copied from Blitzwolf but seems to work.

Values in `migrate.ino` might be wrong. Could not find any documentation for this file and it's purpose.

I added a feature request matching this PR here https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/issues/2114
using 1.14.1 mqtt is disconnected and never reconnects.

mqtt.reset and wifi.reset do not help

mqtt.info is always in "connecting status"
[547326] [MQTT] Client ENABLED, DISCONNECTED
[547326] [MQTT] Retry CONNECTING (Now 461547326, Last 132664642, Delay 5000, Step 5000)
[547332] +OK

After a fast inspection to the code it seems that in mqtt.ino _mqtt_connecting is set to true,
and the event _mqttOnConnect() is never received.

Or this is treated as a bug in ASYNCMQTTCLIENT, or there is need of a workaround with a timeout after connect request to force a mqttDisconnect()?

Hi, it's possible to implement this feature, using tinyGSM or other implementation?
i have a lot of devices that need to work where i don't have wifi coverage.
best regards
I bought ZSP-001 Device
https://templates.blakadder.com/ZSP-001.html

When I tried to configure it, I couldn't, because Espurna ignored GPIO16 on setup (which caused the led (LED2) not to function on that specific device).
I also saw that Xose noticed this issue before (https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/issues/376) but didn't change anything about it.
Anyhow I have added support for the GPIO16.

What I also noticed is that when I choose "Follow Switch#" on LED configuration tab it didn't function at all, as far as I saw the only function that supposed to update the led status according to the relay status is `ledUpdate` and its not being called anywhere but from MQTT, so I have added a call to it after every relay status change. that solved the problem for me.
Support enabled in tree by default for testing purposes.
Buffer itself is disabled, need to mention it in the docs

Terminal command `debug.buffer` prints log buffer
`DEBUG_LOG_BUFFER_SUPPORT` to build support
`DEBUG_LOG_BUFFER_ENABLED` to enable (or `dbgBufEnabled` setting)
`DEBUG_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE` buffer size in bytes (`dbgBufSize` setting)
I've just flashed a couple of BlitzWolf SHP-5, and while most things are working great, I've noticed a small anomaly. The VCC sensor is reading odd values: ~ 235mV

I've updated some of my Sonoff Basics and they correctly show values ~3200mV.

I've given a cursory glance at the bits in the source code linked to this, and suspect it has something to do with the ADC_MODE_VALUE being turned away from ADC_VCC. From what I understand this happens when analog sensors are involved (but the SHP5 has a CSE7766, as serial device so far as I can tell), but in this case VCC shouldn't be provided by the API.

Is it possible that ADC_MODE_VALUE is being seen as different values to different bits of the code?
Would it be possible that optionally (set during compilation process) include an option to aggregate all heartbeat topics and their values into a single "{root topic}/heartbeat" ?

If I understood correctly, currently there is the option to set the output as JSON and Espurna will aggregate all the messages pending to be sent (hearbeat, sensors, relays, so on) into one single JSON.
Maybe it would be better to give to the user the possibility to keep the heartbeat output separated from the other outputs.

**Bug description**
When MQTT getter suffix is defined it is ignored by MQTT last will topic. I think it is because it is initialized before getter / setter initialization on this line https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/blob/e638aaba35dcb9c516efb13aab19856ba8a40403/code/espurna/mqtt.ino#L332 just few lines before https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/blob/e638aaba35dcb9c516efb13aab19856ba8a40403/code/espurna/mqtt.ino#L342

**Steps to reproduce**
- Set `#define MQTT_GETTER "/get"` is `CUSTOM.h`

**Expected behavior**
When i want to use custom getter suffix i expect to have it everywhere.
- Last will: `espurna/XAXAXAXAXAXA/status/get 0` (Now wrong `espurna/XAXAXAXAXAXA/status 0`)
- Status report: `espurna/XAXAXAXAXAXA/status/get 1` (Now correct `espurna/XAXAXAXAXAXA/status/get 1` because topic is initialized ad-hoc)

the switch Boot mode is not working
if you remove power (hard reboot) it dont save the previous state
only soft reboot works
