您好，作者，我想通过您的这个框架实现这样一个功能。我播放一个在线音频，播放一会儿后我就暂停或者杀死APP退出了，然后我希望下次打开app的时候能接着播放退出之前或者杀死之前的那里进行播放，请问我应该怎么去实现呢？因为我看了您的API没明白您里边的好多API的用法，索引希望能够的大您的帮助。谢谢！

Since Apple is formally [deprecating AudioGraph](url) in favor of AVAudioEngine going forward, are there any plans to migrate this great project towards Swift and the newer AVAudioEngine Framework? 

Perhaps there is already something else that can replace it?

It appears that StreamingKit doesn't work when you attempt to launch audio from an app in the background on iOS 13 (tested with Beta 6 / the latest at the time of posting).

It returns an STKAudioPlayerErrorAudioSystemError when you attempt to play the audio. Whats more, if the app has attempted to launch some audio in the background, and is then brought to the foreground; the same error can be found when trying to attempt to play audio in the foreground (so possibly something that's failing on initialisation the first time the library gets used).

If you open the app, and try play something in the foreground only then it works fine / it's only an error if the app is launched in the background and attempts to play some audio (e.g. launched using SiriKit in our case).

This doesn't appear to be an issue on iOS 12. Addittionally on iOS 13; standard AudioPlayers do successfully launch in the background (so it's not a iOS 13 beta issue effecting all audio playing / it's definitely related to StreamingKit specific to iOS 13.)


If the video URL is given to the streamingkit, does the player supports playing the audio of the video file?
Is there a way to play the next song? #
My scene is like this:

I use P2P to transfer the aac data stream (directly to accData), how to deal with it to play better? I will cache the data first, then reach a certain value after 10*1024, there is local, then use setDataSource and Both queueURL and playURL will be played repeatedly, can't stop, pause, or empty the thread, are still there!!! Is there a good solution?
suppose i'm setting up custom time for song is 10:00 minutes but song is only 3 or 4 minutes than after completing that time that song repeat itself.

`if appDelegate.audioPlayer.duration == appDelegate.audioPlayer.progress{ appDelegate.playSong(strUrl:((arrSong.object(at: index)as AnyObject).value(forKey: "audioFile") as! String)) } }
`

After 3 or 4 min when song completed above function called but that gave me Datasource error.
