This is what I feel I'm qualified to raise an issue about. Sorry if it's too trivial. First times are always scary, but confidence can outweigh importance sometimes. This probably isn't one of those times. In any case...

At least my first contribution will make me look petty rather than stupid. I'll take it. Also, many thanks for building this. It made my life so much easier.

EDIT: Damn, I had to edit it. Firsts suck.

I want to use glue for Sprite Animations with trimmed frames, so i need both the original frame size and the position of the trimmed image within the original frame. As an output format i use json. So far i only managed to get the desired results without trimming. Is this currently possible with glue?
It's not always desirable to scale with antialiasing, especially when using Glue with pixel art. I added the options to override the algorithm and updated the docs to reflect the change.

If a user doesn't pass the --scaling argument, it will default to what Glue already used.
this is causing dep conflicts in builds with jinja
Hi, there

Thank you for your glue, it's a wonderful tool for me. I stucked in a trouble that restoring original files. e.g. I have a .plist file and a image file. I want to restore them to original state. I found glue doesn't support this for now yet. Could you add this function to glue? Thank you vvvvvvery much! ðŸ˜„
Hi, there
    I was use glue to spriting images, and got follow errors:
> usage: glue [source | --source | -s] [output | --output | -o]
glue: error: argument --source/-s: invalid unicode value: '/Users/liyunhang/Documents/\xe7\xa4\xbc\xe7\x89\xa9\xe5\x8a\xa8\xe7\x94\xbb/_\xe7\xa4\xbc\xe7\x89\xa9\xe8\x87\xaa\xe5\x8a\xa8\xe5\x8c\x96/\xe6\x83\x85\xe4\xbe\xa3\xe7\xa4\xbc\xe7\x89\xa9/images'

this is command i used:

> glue --cocos --source "/Users/liyunhang/Documents/ç¤¼ç‰©åŠ¨ç”»/_ç¤¼ç‰©è‡ªåŠ¨åŒ–/æƒ…ä¾£ç¤¼ç‰©/images"  --output "/Users/liyunhang/Documents/repos/live-animation-engine/gift/TestNode"

This is my envrioment:

* Python 2.7
* glue 0.13

Could you fix this issue? thank you very much.
First of all â€”Â great library. Itâ€™s a god-send.

What I would like to know is if you would consider adding background position based on percentage so that it will work with responsive layouts. An example of this implementation can be seen here: http://responsive-css.spritegen.com/

If there is already an option for this, please let me know as I canâ€™t find it in docs.

Thanks!


I just came across this tool, and it looks awesome! I'm having some fun getting it going though. 

I've just installed on my Ubuntu 16.0.4 server, using:

`apt-get install glue-sprite`

I didn't get any errors with the install. However, when I try and run it I do:

Any suggestions?

Non-ascii files raise errors, see #203 . On Mac it's more complex because the unicode filenames we read with `os.walk()` contain different codepoints for the same unicode characters we wrote (https://stackoverflow.com/a/33647372/193886 pointed me in the right direction, `unicodedata.normalize()` is your friend).
