Bumps [docpad](https://github.com/docpad/docpad) from 6.69.2 to 6.82.5.
<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>

*Sourced from [docpad's changelog](https://github.com/docpad/docpad/blob/master/HISTORY.md).*

> ## v6.82.5 2018 October 1
> - Prevent plugin `false` could not be loaded errors, now it will output the path that failed to be found, as expected
> 
> ## v6.82.4 2018 September 8
> - Report the correct error for missing action requests
> - Ensure `docpad-plugintester` dependency is latest
> 
> ## v6.82.3 2018 September 8
> - Swapped out promptly for inquirer, which brings back Node v6 support (regression since v6.82.1)
>     - Close [issue [#1093](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/1093)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/1093)
> 
> ## v6.82.2 2018 September 8
> - Add logging support to the pluginloader to make debugging plugin resolutions easier
> - Fixed failures of plugin loading and creation not being reported correctly
> - Ensure all dependencies are the latest right now, to help fix false negatives in plugin resolution
> - Close [thread [#248](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/248)](https://discuss.bevry.me/t/plugins-broken-in-6-82-1/573?u=balupton)
> 
> ## v6.82.1 2018 September 7
> - Fixed initialising new projects (regression from v6.82.0)
> - `docpad init` will now prompt for skeletons (before v6.82.0 this was done via `docpad skeleton`, which was removed)
> - Upgraded remaining dependencies
>     - Upgraded `promptly` dependency from v2 to v3
>     - Swapped `superagent` for `node-fetch`
>     - Close [issue [#1091](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/1091)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/1091)
> 
> ## v6.82.0 2018 September 7
> - This release focuses on eliminating the situation where DocPad would initiate with invalid configuration that would then need to be overwritten later, this could cause plugins to not load correctly, invalid configuration persisting, and general instability until the correct configuration was loaded. Now the correct configuration is loaded from commencement.
> - Due to new dependency requirements, the minimum supported Node version is now Node version 6, which drops support for Node versions 0.10, 0.12, and 4.
>     - Closes [issue [#1086](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/1086)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/1086)
> - Fix DocPad not working on windows (regression since v6.81.0)
>     - Closes [issue [#1088](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/1088)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/1088), [thread [#240](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/240)](https://discuss.bevry.me/t/error-cannot-find-module-editions/570?u=balupton), [issue [#1085](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/1085)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/1085), [issue [#1084](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/1084)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/1084)
> - Progress indicator will now pause once the action has completed, and resume on new actions, this allows for cleaner shutdowns with no change of ability
> - Graceful shutdown is now offered by the `destroyOnExit` configuration option, which uses `process.on('beforeExit', docpad.onBeforeExit)` to destroy DocPad gracefully. This is now possible as we don't have to support Node 0.10. Before we had to do graceful shutdowns in a more complex and manual manner, which resulted in less graceful shutdowns.
> - DocPad will now longer output `The action completed successfully.`, as unless an error has displayed, then evidently everything remains successful
> - Debug log file will now only be removed if it needs to be replaced with another one
> - Fixed `--no-color` CLI argument and `color` configuration option not working
>     - Closes [issue [#938](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/938)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/938)
>     - Color now correctly defaults to environment support
>     - Also now supports `--colour` and `--no-colour`
>     - Removed `--prompts` CLI argument and `prompts` config option in favour of the `--progress` CLI argument and `progress` config option (as that is all `prompts` did really)
> - The CLI has been rewritten and simplified
>     - The [`commander` package](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) has been swapped out for the [`cac` package](https://github.com/cacjs/cac)
>         - Closes [issue [#1048](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/1048)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docpad/docpad/issues/1048)
>     - Customisation of the out path via a CLI option now occurs via `--outPath` to remove ambiguity with `docpad render` out file customisation
>     - Introduced `--verbose` and `--debug` CLI options, such that one can do `--silent --debug`
>     - For `docpad render` there is no longer a delay to check for stdin, however if you are using stdin, you must now provide the `--stdin` CLI argument
>         - `stdin` reading abilities has been moved into the docpad `renderStdin` method, and `render` has gained support for it, as well as support for writing an output file
>     - Global CLI options are now parsed before DocPad is instantiated, to ensure configuration is correct from initiation, rather than incorrect at instantiation then made correct later
>         - This removes built in support for customising this, however, no one should be customising global CLI options anyway
>         - As expected, `consoleSetup` event fires after DocPad is ready, and commands can be added to the `cac` instance in the event options

Hello,

I use your lib for a project that does'nt use Backbone and it fails with this line : 

`else if (selectorValue instanceof Backbone.Model) {`

cause the Backbone is not defined, you cannot get something on it.
