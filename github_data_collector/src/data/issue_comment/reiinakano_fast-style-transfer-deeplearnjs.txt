Hello! I am pleased with Your project and would like to suggest you to implement another stylization algorithm proposed by Leon Gatis(A neural algorithm of artistic style). It allows you to stylize images for absolutely any style. There are a lot of realizations. Here's one made on Tenzorflow: https://github.com/woodrush/neural-art-tf. I hope this will interest you.

Error text ($ ./scripts/deploy-demo ... ) :

When I build your project it writes that it is highly recommended to switch from Bower to Yarn:

Are you going to switch it any time soon?

Thanks.
Hi,

I really like your project.

Recently I tried it in the "watch" mode and decided to build it and then run on my local node.js server. After executing the deploy-demo script I got a single HTML file (730 kB) in a new folder (I called it "distr"). I tried to run it, but it does not work properly. It shows the controls, but does not show the pictures (source and style) and the button does nothing.

Please explain how to build the project properly and what files and folders does it need to work. For example, it requires a script from bower_components\webcomponentsjs folder, I copied this folder to the distr folder, but it changed nothing. 

Thank you in advance.
