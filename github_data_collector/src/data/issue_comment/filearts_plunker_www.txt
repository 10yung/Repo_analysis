### Current behavior 
Plunker sidebar scroll child is hidden in IE 11

### Mention any other details that might be useful
Looks like parent element of plunker-sidebar CSS is the reason.
Current:
```css
display: block
```
Should be:
```css
display: flex
```

Hello, 

I just created a plunker that I can open in Firefox but not in Chrome.
I created in Chrome while logged in to GitHub, and saved a version before copying the url and closing the tab.
I can open other plunkers just fine.

The link :

Versions : 
- Firefox 53.0.2 (32-bit)
- Chrome 66.0.3359.139 (Official Build) (64-bit) all extensions disabled

The error  in chrome dev tools:

The network tab  :

I logged into github while i was working on a plunk and i noticed my github information was sent to the console

looks like it comes from here
https://github.com/filearts/plunker_www/blob/a62cf35a37a541537d8649d9b26181f74e3c9437/assets/js/services/visitor.coffee#L31

a user can iframe plunker then override the frame's console.log to whatever they want.
Emmet expansion is not working now. 
.testClass does not expand to `<div class="testClass"></div>`
How ever people get knowledge about your site using??? There is no any documentation or guide on the main page. All I have is just google and dozen scattered examples. It is really unclear how to manage javascript dependecies on the project, how move those dependencies from `package.json` if my site is built via nodejs? And how to integrate all of this with my developer process? (E.g. continues integration tool, git branching and so on).

It is really, really hard to start.

Ideally there should be a manual for this but for now Could you please add "how to" section to you main page with link to show main features?
I had some issues with flexbox then I realized there were no prefixes. Is there anyway to add autoprefixer. its been so long since I've added these in manually. I forget what needs a prefix. 

Thanks.

I am satisfied with plunker compared to others.

However, as a blogger, when I post to medium as an embeded one, jsfiddle works very nicely, but plunker does not.

Can you make plunker to get embedded nicely to medium.com?


In my company, jquery CDN url with out https is blocked.

Blocked URL:
http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js

Working URL:
https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js

I can see in if we browser below url its working, 
https://plnkr.co/edit/?p=options
Because, this URL or route uses jquery with HTTPS - Identified from developer tools.

The same is not working with below urls, because, this URL or route uses jquery without HTTPS (http only)
1. http://plnkr.co/
2. http://plnkr.co/edit/SAl4YVXKRWpS7OeTYMrd?p=preview

Can we change all to HTTPS ?
