Hello 
I changed FFMPEG 3.4 to 4.2 
## Supported platforms

* iOS: arm64 for device and X86_64 for simulator
* tvOS: arm64 for device and X86_64 for simulator
* macOS: X86_64
* macOS-catalyst: X86_64

## Issues

* x86_64 binaries are built without ASM support, since ASM for x86_64 is actually x86 and that confuses `xcodebuild -create-xcframework`

ISSUE:
ffmpeg compiled against iOS 10 SDK (XCode 8) will produce crash while accessing any RTSP source if it is running on iOS 9.x with the following error:
`dyld: Symbol not found: _clock_gettime`

The problem is that iOS 10 has clock_gettime function, but iOS 9 does not have.

FIX:
Right after configure put this line

`sed -i -- 's/HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME 1/HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME 0/g' config.h`

I'm getting many warnings like : "ld: warning: URGENT: building for tvOS simulator, but linking in object file (/lib/libavutil.a(log.o)) built for iOS. Note: This will be an error in the future". 

But it runs on both simulator and real device despite of these warnings.
How can i build without these warnings?
