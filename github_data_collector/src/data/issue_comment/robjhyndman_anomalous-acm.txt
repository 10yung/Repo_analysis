Hi,
Is there a way to detect outliers taking in account more than the first 2 PC? For example PC1 + PC2 + PC3 + PC4 if I realise that I need to use all of them to cover a good enough cumulated variance of my original dataset. Would it be possible to modify your source code to make it work?

Hi there

I am trying to run the example stated in README file and got the results:

```
> z <- ts(matrix(rnorm(3000),ncol=100),freq=4)
> y <- tsmeasures(z)
> biplot.features(y)
Error in pcaPP::PCAproj(naomit.x, k = 2, scale = sd, center = mean) : 
  object 'C_pcaProj_up' not found
> anomaly(y)
Error in pcaPP::PCAproj(naomit.x, k = 2, center = mean, scale = sd) : 
  object 'C_pcaProj_up' not found
```

Google indeed gave me quite strange results on that (all pointing to fixing Win 10 bugs etc.)
Hi,

When using the anomalous package on a single time series, the following error was encountered (It requires at least two timeseries to work properly)

`Error in apply(nay, 2, all) : dim(X) must have a positive length
`

Thanks !
