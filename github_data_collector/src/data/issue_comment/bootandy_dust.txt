Awesome work!

Any chance of adding a man page?
Maybe something like ripgrep has using asciidoc?

```
❯ man dust
No manual entry for dust
```

I see `dust --help` works, but it'd be handy to have a man page too, since it's many peoples first instinct when trying a new cli tool.
DaisyDisk uses this and it is very fast at gather diskspace information.
It doesn't seem to work on Windows 8.1:
```
> dust
←[38;5;196m 597M←[0m ─┬ .
```

I get the same output, no matter which flags I pass. Any idea why?
I'm mostly writing this so I get the close notification when this happens, but it would be neat if there were rpm/deb packages for dust.
