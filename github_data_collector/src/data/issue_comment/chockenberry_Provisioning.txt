Hi,

It seems that an awful lot of Quicklook plugins no longer work on High Sierra (or so)...? I tried debugging with:

`sudo qlmanage -p <my profile>.mobileprovision`

Output is:

```
Testing Quick Look preview with files:
	<redacted>.mobileprovision

See /usr/include/servers/bootstrap_defs.h for the error codes.

```

Any ideas? Just needs a new build?

* Adds some neat installation instructions
* Adds MIT License because none was specified ;)

This is a great little tool, which I use regularly for debugging code signing and provisioning issues.

I've noticed that it support `.app` and `.ipa` files, but doesn't work for iOS today and watch extensions which have `.appex`.

I assume this can be added to the Provisioning-Info.plist like [how the .app handling is defined](https://github.com/chockenberry/Provisioning/blob/master/Provisioning/Provisioning-Info.plist#L34-L39), but I'm not sure how to find out the bundle type to add to the `LSItemContentTypes`.

For a long time, I've had issues with QuickLook showing blank previews of images. Looks like it's because I enabled the QLEnableTextSelection option after installing the Provisioning QL plugin:

http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/128825/quicklook-blanks-when-displaying-some-images

This is obviously not a problem with the plugin, but perhaps a note of caution could be added to the front page?



Included clarification in regarding to the folder not always existing.

Since the Provisioning Quick Look plug-in handles iOS App (IPA) files, it would be beneficial and meaningful to display the app icon (which is archived inside the IPA file) in the following places:
1.  Display the app icon as the icon preview Thumbnail (instead of the generic IPA document icon).
2.  Display the app icon inside the Quick Look Preview panel - most likely at the top-left of the provisioning profile information, near the app title. For consistency, other non-IPA file types could display their generic document icon in the same position.
3.  Display the app icon as the Quick Look Preview (default to 512 x 512 points), when the IPA file contains no provisioning profile. This would apply to all IPA files obtained through iTunes, typically stored here:
   
   ```
   ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications/
   ```

This concept isn't new ‚Äì the _IPA Quick Look_ plug-in by Julien Chauveau @julienchauveau has provided the above functionality (items 1 and 3) since 2009. It's located here:

http://code.google.com/p/quicklook-ipa/
https://github.com/julienchauveau/quicklook-ipa

It should be noted, however, that this plug-in hasn't been updated since 2009, and doesn't appear to work on Mavericks 10.9.x. A casual glance at the Console error logs seems to indicate a Sandbox error, but further investigation would be required there.

Secondly, with the release of iOS 7, Apple changed the appearance of all iOS app icons by altering the corner radius of the mask applied to the icon image. (The icon images of iOS apps are square, masked programmatically when displayed on iOS and in iTunes.) The aforementioned plug-in uses a pre-iOS 7-style corner radius.

It may be better to apply an iOS 7-style corner radius, though apparently this isn't as easy as it seems. Some work has been done to determine the new style of corner radius, such as by Manfred Schwind @manide:

Looking at the icon rendering in iTunes 11.1, it looks like app icons are still masked in the pre-iOS 7 style, but it's probably just a matter of time before this changes to the new style.

Thanks!
