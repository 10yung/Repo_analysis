This is one of my favorites from Atom and was disappointed to find a lack of support on JetBrains.

Is a plan for a seti mock in the future? I would love to see it.

Recently IntelliJ finally started supporting the ability to create UI Themes. I wrote a quick node script that parses each color scheme xml file and generates the relevant UI theme json file.

Note this only supports 2019.1+ versions. Here's a link to the [docs](http://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/reference_guide/ui_themes/themes.html).

Admittedly I'm not a designer and don't have an eye for this sort of thing, but I was tired of using these great themes with a different UI in IntelliJ. You can change any of the values with fields from the xml color schemes. I'm currently running the jar file. The light themes could probably use some looking over. I use strictly dark themes, but I did confirm they all load.


Hi @daylerees 

Wanted to tell you thanks for your job with such great color themes.

But recently I've faced the issue, I started to use Github Light theme and I've noticed that the color of the params is not readable at all, could you pls guide me how to fix that issue.

Thanks.

I install the plugins from pycharm, but i don't know where I can choose the theme?
when going from the darcula theme to a rain glow (I'm using blink).  the project view uses the Intellij theme font color in the project view.  This creates a dark on dark font and makes it very hard to read.

I'm aware this project hasn't been updated in a while, but I assume it gets any bug fixes if any show up.

The problem: The notification is made for a dark theme, but it's using a light theme. (These are called notifications in the color scheme editor anyways. I assume it applies to the actual notifications as well)

This happens on every single light theme. It's fine in the dark ones, because the text is readable, but in the light ones (the one in the pic is arbitrarily chosen), it shows up like that. [Here](https://github.com/rainglow/jetbrains/blob/master/colors/codecourse-light.xml#L81) is the problem, which I've found in every light theme I've tried. That value sets the notification color, and it is only a problem in the light themes. A quick search finds 326 results, all in xml files (not filtering light/dark/contrast), so it's set to that for them all. 

It doesn't follow most of the themes (which isn't that big an issue), but on the light themes, it's unreadable.

For anyone using these themes, this can be temporarily fixed by going to Settings | Editor | Color Schemes | General | Editor | Notification background. But it would be optimal for it to be fixed in the schemes themselves rather than manually setting it for the active theme. 

Hey, thanks for those awesome themes. My personal favourite is Laravel (despite never having coded in PHP, lol) but I found some issues with it.

1. I really enjoy the fact that variables are white (DEDEDE). I really helps to distinguish them from method calls. In the original Laravel theme from rainglow.io function arguments are also DEDEDE but in this plugin function arguments are FC580C:

In Intellij Idea it can be changed under Identifiers ->Function declaration:

2. Class names are FFC48C instead of DEDEDE:
<img width="385" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2983710/47313204-a0451b00-d63e-11e8-8c27-5822d2ab43bd.png">
It can be changed under Classes -> Class name
Same for static classes under Classes -> Static class

3. Unknown symbols (such as method names with a typo) are missing Underwave which makes them undistinguishable from properly named methods. 
It can be changed under Errors and Warnings -> Unknown symbol

4. Outlined entity has a foreground nearly the same as Editor background.
It can be changed under Code -> Outlined entity. I guess it can be completely removed or changed to Bordered effect
First: thanks for great themes, awesome piece of work!

And the problem: in all themes, folded texts are light yellow. I guess they have not been overridden. This makes them completely unreadable when using light themes.
