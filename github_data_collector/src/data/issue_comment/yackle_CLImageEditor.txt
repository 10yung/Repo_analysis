In iPhone X and above I am facing this issue. when you select an image from the gallery and edit that image with any editing tool this happens and this navigation bar becomes unclickable. This happens in the demo app also.

I am testing in iOS 13 and iPhone X and above devices

Is it possible to change the background color only for stickers and emoticons?


I want to show gridview with pre defined coordinates and after that I want to extent or decrease the view according to need. Simply, I want to show small grid view on Image.

While applying stickers on image it apply only on image size part. I want to put stickers or emoticons on anywhere on view not only on image. Currently sticker is cropped if I drag it outside of image. So, is it possible to put sticker anywhere in view?
