is there a way to check if one swipe is already open then before opening 2nd swipe first swipe gets close 
好久没更新，能用kotlin和ItemTouchHelper更新一下代码吗？

When I tried to import AndroidSwipeLayout to a project in Android Studio, I got the following message

Could not get unknown property 'ANDROID_BUILD_SDK_VERSION' for project ':library' of type org.gradle.api.Project.

Does anyone have any idea? 

I am implementing swipe layout in comment listing (recyclerview) where i want to give option of edit and delete the comment. so i want to close other comments edit/delete option when user tries to edit/delete one comment.

I have maintained a flag and calling swipeLayout.open(true) and swipeLayout.close(true) methods programmatically but its not fully working as expected.
What should we do if sideslip is not allowed?
I am using recyclerview in which height of the items are different and because of using this library items are taking extra space randomly.
I want to make the swipe layout swipe programatically on a button click, but always from left to right.
