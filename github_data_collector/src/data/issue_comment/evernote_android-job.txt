Before starting, this is surely related to  [#572 ](https://github.com/evernote/android-job/issues/572)

we still have this bug in android 8 and 9.

the problem is with `.startService(intent)` in [WakeLockUtil.java#L111](https://github.com/evernote/android-job/blob/d9cfc62d2cd52051b424efa0dcff3574287a6171/library/src/main/java/com/evernote/android/job/WakeLockUtil.java#L111)

looking to this  [thread  in stackoverflow ](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55037193/4771750), we might solve it. 

	try {
        context.startService(intent)
    }
    catch (ex: IllegalStateException) {
        intent.putExtra(NEED_FOREGROUND_KEY, true)
        if(Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O) {
            context.startForegroundService(intent)
        }
        else {
            context.startService(intent)
        }
    }

but we have to take care of ANR like described [here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background#services) :

> Prior to Android 8.0, the usual way to create a foreground service was to create a background service, then promote that service to the foreground. With Android 8.0, there is a complication; the system doesn't allow a background app to create a background service. For this reason, Android 8.0 introduces the new method startForegroundService() to start a new service in the foreground. After the system has created the service, the app has five seconds to call the service's startForeground() method to show the new service's user-visible notification. If the app does not call startForeground() within the time limit, the system stops the service and declares the app to be ANR.

i have tried applying it, but i failed to apply ` startForeground()`.

is there someone that could help with it?

**@Owners,** please don't close this issue till we find a solution to it. it's really a disturbing bug, causing many problems in prod.  
Thanks.
