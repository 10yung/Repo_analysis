Adds description, parameters and return values for the requested functions in #237 
This module has a few module functions we'll want to document:

- [ ] [GitReflow::Config#add](https://github.com/reenhanced/gitreflow/blob/master/lib/git_reflow/config.rb#L40)
- [ ] [GitReflow::Config#get](https://github.com/reenhanced/gitreflow/blob/master/lib/git_reflow/config.rb#L10)
- [ ] [GitReflow::Config#set](https://github.com/reenhanced/gitreflow/blob/master/lib/git_reflow/config.rb#L22)
- [ ] [GitReflow::Config#unset](https://github.com/reenhanced/gitreflow/blob/master/lib/git_reflow/config.rb#L31)

For details on what all needs documented, [see the inch-ci suggestions](https://inch-ci.org/github/reenhanced/gitreflow?branch=master) for each method.
There are times when a legacy user of git-reflow goes to re-run setup only to find themselves with blank configurations.  Since we are only validating presence of the github.oauth-token, there's an edge-case where the user could have _only_ the oauth-token configuration with missing user.  This causes some authentication failures and a bad user-experience.  This ensures that the user is asked for all required information, that the information is fully persisted to git-config, and gracefully handles authentication errors from GitHub in a more user-friendly way. Oh, and more tests :-)

Fixes #193

This should add a new Workflow to our current [list of custom Workflows](https://github.com/reenhanced/gitreflow/tree/master/lib/git_reflow/workflows).

See our [wiki on Custom Workflows](https://github.com/reenhanced/gitreflow/wiki/Custom-Workflows) for more details on how to implement.  Ideally, anyone could add Pivotal Tracker support to their workflow by just adding `use "PivotalTracker"` at the top of their `Workflow` file.
Adds documentation for how to contribute to git-reflow.

I'm having issues with GitHub authentication. Whenever I run a reflow command, it fails and gives the message below. If I delete the token from my GitHub account, it works one time, but then will come with the same error the next time. Using two step authentication with GitHub so not sure if that has anything to do with it. Any ideas? Thanks!

Using Ubuntu 16.04 with reflow version 0.8.1

`reilly@reilly:~/Documents/GitHub/campuskudos-api$ git reflow status`
`Please enter your GitHub username: reillydavis`
`Please enter your GitHub password (we do NOT store this):`
`Please enter your two-factor authentication code: *******`
`[error] You have previously setup git-reflow on this machine, but we can no longer find the stored token.`
`[notice] Please visit https://github.com/settings/tokens and delete the token for: git-reflow (reilly)
error: We were unable to authenticate with Github.`

Consider adding [git aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases) to the setup command.  Maybe setup subcommand `git reflow setup aliases` that could just add them to the user's config file automatically.

See #181 for prior discussion.
As embarrassing as it may sound. This repo is the first time I got to hear about `LGTM` reviews. But the point is, I am always trying to improve on things like my workflows. 

Which is why, I am requesting a WIKI document, that explains how does your workflow work. Nothing too complex just one example where you would use Git Reflow and show us how it will work with LGTM in an explicit example. 

It will help a lot. 

Considering using something like [Docbase](https://github.com/appbaseio/docbase) or if just the standard GH wiki would work.
