Thank you for this package. I was looking for something just like this. 

This code:
df = get_intraday_data(cookie, what="heart-rate", date="2018-06-23")

gives me the error below: 

Error in curl::handle_setopt(handle, .list = req$options) : 
  Value for option cookie (10022) must be length-1 string

Could it be because I only have 4 days of data, not a week yet? I can't think of anything else. I am not an advanced R user, so appreciate any help. 
Thank you
I was able to seamlessly get data from Fitbit using fitbitScraper on 5th Sept. But the same codes now resulting in a "login fail" message. Not sure what changed. Everything the same, worked one day but not anymore...
Fitbit now supports different sleep categories ("AWAKE", "REM", "LIGHT", "DEEP") for certain devices; is there any way to get that data?
adds function get_bodycomp_data(cookie, start_date, end_date)
Pulls body composition data: lean mass and weight. The function calculates fat mass and body fat percent and returns in a data frame similar to the get_weight_data function. I own a Fitbit Aria which captures body fat percent data.
Get package!! ðŸ™‚ 
In the daily data, you are reporting "minutesActive". Nowadays fitbit is reporting "totalminutes". How do I get that?

 
Thanks so much for this great package! Infinitely better than suffering their export process.

I have a premium subscription to fitbit and am having an issue with get_premium_export.  When I run: 

`get_premium_export(cookie, what = "ACTIVITIES", start_date = "2015-01-13", end_date = "2015-01-20")`

I get the error:
```
Error in get_premium_export(cookie, what = "ACTIVITIES", start_date = "2015-01-13",  : 
  problem with request, this may be available only for premium subscribers
```

I've logged into the site and confirmed that my premium subscription is active.  I re-created the cookie variable and am still getting the error.  

Is there anything else I can check?  Is this still working for you/someone else?

Thanks in advance,
Leigh
This function returns the date and time of the last sync to fitbit.com. While it might not be useful to regular FitBit users, it could benefit researchers who use this package to regularly gather FitBit data from study participants.

By the way, I have no experience documenting R code for use in packages. I used your code as a model for my documentation.

I'm having trouble pulling specific dates when using get_activity_data. It seems that no matter what dates I use it pulls the most recent two weeks.

I'm using R 3.2.3, Rstudio Version 0.99.473, on Mac OSX 10.10.3 Yosemite.

day_activites3 <- get_activity_data(cookie, start_date="2015-12-25", end_date = "2015-12-31") 
returns the last two weeks of data instead of the specified days. I noticed this first when I was trying to just pull data from December. I started playing with the start and end date and noticed that no matter which dates I use it always pulls the most recent two weeks. I haven't had this problem with any of the other commands. Any ideas?
