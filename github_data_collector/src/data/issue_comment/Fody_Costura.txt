@GeertvanHorrik which one is correct?
## Please check all of the platforms you are having the issue on (if platform is not listed, it is not supported)

 - [x ] WPF
 - [ ] UWP
 - [ ] iOS
 - [ ] Android
 - [ ] .NET Standard
 - [ ] .NET Core

## Component

What component is this issue occurring in?

## Version of Library
3.3.3

## Version of OS(s) listed above with issue
Windows 10 Pro 1903

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a WPF application
2. Set Thread Culture to other than en-US
3. Use IsolatedStorageFile.OpenFile to open a file, and make it to throw an exception, e.g. use invalid character in filename
4. Run the application from command line (if running in VS, problem cannot be reproduced)

## Expected Behavior
Exception can be handled in a normal try/catch block

## Actual Behavior
Exception cannot be handled as another internal exception occurs: "mscorlib recursive resource lookup", which pops up an error dialog before you can catch the real exception.
This issue is the same as the one reported earlier, but got closed: https://github.com/Fody/Costura/issues/138
Hi I have installed the Microsoft AppCenter [analytics and Crash report] packages after building the project, two folders will be created named x86 and x64, each with an assembly called e_sqlite3.dll

Costura Merged all assemblies into Exe but cannot merge these two folders. how can i merge this 2 folder?
also i have a folder called en that contain MyApp.resources.dll, this assembly also cant be merged in exe. can i merge this assembly too?
Since I'll be maintaining Costura in the near future, I'll consolidate the project structure so it matches our other Fody weavers we are maintaining. This way we can easily patch different weavers at the same time.
