Previous behaviour:
Anisotropic filtering was continuing to run even with Nearest filtering.
On opengl it doesn't run on nearest filtering. The gui for both
renderers also greys out aniso when nearest is selected.

Anisotropic filtering being able to run on palette texture. This caused
to break the rendering on palette textures for games that use it.

PR behavior:
The PR corrects both of these behaviors, Aniso won't run on palette
textures as well as nearest filtering.

Test cases for observing the issues were used: Star Ocean 3, Fifa
Street.

Visual issue representation below is when anisotropic filtering runs on palette textures.

Localization for Traditional Chinese (zh_TW). WIP
Add an option in hw hacks to control the half bottom detection.

Automatic, Force Disabled, Force Enabled.

Automatic - automatically determinate if a game needs the half screen
fix.
Force Disabled - fully disables the half bottom fix. It will help
Xenosaga games.
Force Enabled - fully enables the half bottom fix. Will help Lord of the
Rings Two Towers, Superman Shadows of Apokolips, Midnight Club 3.

**Note this will be a temporary solution for 1.6 release so we can eliminate the possibility of regressions and allow us to fix a few more games as well with the option.**

I know, that it is possible to change hotkeys in file PCSX2_keys.ini, but if I remove hotkey it uses default value. It is possible to add something like "NONE" or empty value to disable hotkey? I didn't find any messages about this, only questions about rebinding. Tried on latest git snapshot.
Recently I was looking to use the Slow motion option in Pcsx2, and could not remember how to enable it. Well with some googling I found the Forum thread about the "Shift" button options. It would be nice to see theses options listed in the program. i.e. a tooltip stating what key or key combo is associated with it.

Thanks for the Hard Work.
Sometime ago I worked on https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/2934 which was a fix to handle games which split the frame buffer in order to do texture shuffle. Why they do this I am unsure. It may have been an optimization of some kind.

However, at the time I relied on some heuristics which have turned out to be flawed.
See:
https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/3162
https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/3209

Admittedly it is a shortcut and now the chickens have come home to roost.

Instead of this heuristic, what I want to do is handle the issue in the cache. @AlessandroVetere has made great progress in handling mid-texture hits in the cache for the Jak games with his tex_inside_rt work. I believe that this work can also benefit us here too.

TS relies on reading back a previous rt in a different format and mapping the pixels accordingly. Currently the issue with halfscreen is we need to be able to hit mid rt in order to get the other half. The hit will not always be dead center.

***PCSX2 version:***
``v1.5.0-dev-3345-g96ef80077``

***Description of the issue:***
Debugger doesn't seem to display VU microcode properly. Very few instructions show up correctly.

***How to reproduce the issue:***
View any known address containing VU microcode in the debugger view.

***Last known version to work:***
N/A

If anyone has any resources on disassembling these opcodes correctly, please let me know. I'm not sure how many people use PCSX2 for this purpose, but I've yet to find any proper tools/scripts out there. This game has symbols marking the different labels of VU microcode, and I'd like to explore them more.

Thanks!

***PCSX2 version***
1.5.0 (All versions and I believe all developmental builds)

***Description***
  The clouds simply don't render unless you're in software mode. In hardware mode they're nonexistent. While this isn't a major issue, it's still quite an issue that I'd love to see solved.
