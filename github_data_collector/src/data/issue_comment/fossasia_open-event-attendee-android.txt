Fixes #2514 

Changes: For the purpose of this pull request I have added Thai language as a language of use to the Open Event Attendee App so that viewers may also view the content of the app in thai language and are not limited by the lack of options of languages available on the app.

@mariobehling @hpdang @nikit19 @liveHarshit 
Mentors please review and merge as and when possible. Thank you.
In the app, UI needs improvement. And, when we click on a particular event, the integrated map is empty, after tapping on it, Google maps gets opened but the location of the event is not showed.

A new user should be given a quick tour of the app's features.
It would really improve the user experience. 
Inputs during password reset are vague, and those should be clarified. Also, there is no need to have a  create event button during password reset as it is irrelevant.
 After one click on 'I forgot my password' link,It show the loading progress bar but after that nothing happens and after two or three clicks.Message 'check your email' is shown.
