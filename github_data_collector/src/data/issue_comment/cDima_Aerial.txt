Trying get it working in 4K but the application won't open.  I've already uninstalled the regular version and that .exe works fine but not the one listed here https://github.com/jonathonwpowell/Aerial/tree/temp4krelease/ScreenSaver/bin/Release

The left hand side is a 1440x900 display (Monitor 1), while the right hand side is a 1366x768 display (Monitor 2).

The message shown is this.

Hi All,

This is the only place I can see to put this, but I've just gotten the tvOS13 json file and cleaned it up to work with the @jonathonwpowell version of the screensaver.

I've saved it as Public Gist so all you need to do is copy the link below into your source location and it'll take the screensavers. Please remember these are 4K so yoru PC must have enough power to run 4K video even at a 1080 resolution.

Please feel free to share this with others so they can be enjoyed by all!

EDIT:

I've made a 1080/2K version:

In July i asked the Developer if a release with the Space Scenes from iOS 12 is planed. His answer is here in quotes:

> **Probably no on new releases, the URLs for new videos may be hard to find.** 

Since there hasn't been a new release in a long time  i guess it really is dead. Maybe someone else will work on a new version? It would be amazing to get the same feature set as the MacOS Version

It will be a blast to have a clock on the screensaver as the mosaic or tiles on Macâ€™s screensaver. The screensaver is so beautiful that everyone that passes through my computers freeze starring like dummies!!!
please add the latest videos...
tvOS 13's new videos are available
The mac version has been updated :)... Any chance to see this on the windows side? :)

This version includes many fixes for various issues including with multi monitor setups and better support for older versions of macOS.

1.6.0a is a quick hotfix following 1.6.0 released two hours before. It fixes a cache detection bug for /Library/Caches/Aerial.
This version includes support for the 15 new videos introduced in tvOS 13, including the 10 Sea videos and 5 new Space videos ðŸŽ‰
Adds HDR support for macOS Catalina ðŸŽ‰
Starting with this release, Aerial is properly signed and notarized ðŸŽ‰
Cache mechanism was changed to accommodate changes in macOS Catalina. We recommend you double check your cache settings after upgrading.
Add Dutch translation by @sebastiaanspeck
Add Traditional Chinese and update Simplified Chinese translations by @LinkeyLeo
Add advanced mode for finely tuning the Spanned viewing mode in multi monitor configurations
It would be nice to see where the video was taken. So please add some captions to the screensaver videos.
