I was looking through some project regex and found this one [here](https://github.com/jclevy/chocolatejs/blob/0f3953b09a3327654947366b0b04b9c786c4cd68/static/lib/chocodown.js#L209). It seems to use the \Z notation for an anchor but this is not a supported feature in the JS regex dialect. 




Just a heads up:

I just published a new version of letsencrypt - v1.5.0

There shouldn't be any breaking changes to the API, but it does require a shim for the new Buffer methods that aren't implemented in older version of node.

Let me know if you have any problems or if I can answer any questions.

@jclevy, I've corrected a typographical error in the documentation of the [chocolatejs](https://github.com/jclevy/chocolatejs) project. Specifically, I've changed basicaly to basically. You should be able to merge this pull request automatically. However, if this was intentional or if you enjoy living in linguistic squalor, please let me know and [create an issue](https://github.com/thoppe/orthographic-pedant/issues/new) on my home repository.
