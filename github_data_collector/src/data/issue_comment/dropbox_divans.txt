I believe that individual components of divans would already be very useful contributions to the crates ecosystem. While the full divans package doesn't match my compression needs, for instance, a crate with the implementation of fse would be very useful to me.

Would it be possible to split divans into smaller crates?
Hello.
Thanks for good work!
One question...is there some kind of file compress/decompress example? Because there are no documents, it is bit complicate to test.

Thanks.
Formatting code using [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt) will apply uniform code style for all Rust code and it may also improve code readability.

The crate https://crates.io/crates/divans contains a documentation link that is actually a link to a blog post. A link to the API documentation would be useful, too.
Is there any consensus for a divans file extension?
Is the divans on-disk file format seek-able? I.e. would it be possible to start decompressing somewhere in a file or would one need to decompress everything from the start?

Or in rust terms:  could DivansDecompressorReader implement the std::io::Seek trait?
