尝试修改了一下导航栏显示不出来的问题，在bar上添加titleLabel
Hello!

I'm having an issue when I'm coming back (pop) to a UIViewController that has left and/or right navigationItems. When I wire the RainbowNavigation to the UIViewController navigationController,  set the "navigationBarInColor()", and pop back to that viewController (dragging or not), the colored background view overlaps the navigationItems (except the title or titleView).

```
override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        let button = UIBarButtonItem(title: "HELLO", style: .plain, target: nil, action: nil)
        self.navigationItem.setRightBarButton(button, animated: true)

        if let navigationController = navigationController {
            rainbowNavigation.wireTo(navigationController: navigationController)
        }
}

...

func navigationBarInColor() -> UIColor {
        return navColor
}
```

I have tested it in my own app as in the ExamleApp, and it happens on both.
I have been able to debug it, and found that the navigatinoBar.subviews order is the problem, when poping back the ViewController, the layers are rearranged and the backgroundView place itself over the NavigationItems and behind the (TitleView or Title).

I was not able to fix it yet, has anyone encountered this problem too???
That’s it
OC version can be translated
Hi, It would be nice to have a variable to restrict the zone of the PanGesture, because the user could close accidentally the Controller.
I patch the code in RainbowDragPop.swift to restrict the PanGesture for the first 30px:

```
func handlePan(_ panGesture:UIPanGestureRecognizer) {
        let offset = panGesture.translation(in: panGesture.view)
        let velocity = panGesture.velocity(in: panGesture.view)
        let position = panGesture.location(in: panGesture.view) //EDIT

        switch panGesture.state {
        case .began:
            if(position.x > 30){ return; } //EDIT

            if !self.popAnimator.animating {
```

Regards

Would be awesome to have this library working on Swift 3 as well
