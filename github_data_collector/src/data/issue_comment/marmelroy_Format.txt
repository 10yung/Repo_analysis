is this library still being supported?  i use it and it works pretty good but i won't work in swift 4 or 5 , i think
### Why?
Enable installing separately each format type
### Why?
To format numbers with given separators and spacing.

### Changes
- Add separator NumberFormatterType
- Format numbers with a given separator and spacing
- Remove unnecessary NumberFormat singleton

#### Related to [issue](https://github.com/marmelroy/Format/issues/16)

I've followed the main used patterns
I hope to be contributing :)
Hello, i have an issue after install: 
in this function, 

open func format(_ number: NSNumber, formatter: NumberFormatterCustomLocaleAvailable, locale: Locale) -> String

 let distance = number as CLLocationDistance

NSNumber' is not convertible to 'CLLocationDistance' (aka 'Double'); did you mean to use 'as!' to force downcast? 

xCode Version 9.3.1 (9E501)
platform :ios, '10.0'
swift_version = "4.0"



Hi @marmelroy, thanks for greate Format, when i change from US language to Vietnamese, i have bug: $ -> US$. 
I use this function: .format(Format.Currency(rawValue:USD)). 
Many thank for support.
Cool pod!

Is there any way to format large numbers with a comma between the thousandths?

i.e: `8373728 -> 8,373,728`
