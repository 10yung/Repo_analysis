**Describe the bug**
The script has only been tested on macOS and I suspect on Windows/Linux the `-p` and `-n` options are removing _the whole "home" IDE folder_ for the user. I don't have either system to test on, so this requires someone to help out.

**To Reproduce**
[unknown] needs triaging

**Expected behavior**
`-p` and `-n` should only remove the IDE preferences subfolder, and the cache subfolder. Not the whole IDE folder in the users' home folder.

**System information**
 - OS version: Windows/Linux
 - Kotlin version: n/a
 - Maven version: n/a
 - KScript version: n/a
 - Script version: 1.4.0

**Describe the bug**
When you have previous backup folders (e.g., `*backup00`, `*backup01`, etc.) the script considers them for cleanup too. We should filter out the folders that match `.*backup\d{2}$`.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Run the script once with the `--backup` and `--nuke` options
2. Confirm it has created backups
3. Run the script again, with the `--dry-run` and `--nuke` options
4. Confirm that it would try to clear the previously backup folders too

**Expected behavior**
Backup folders should be ignored and not nuked

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: macOS 10.13.5 (17F77)
 - Version: 1.3.0
