Everything edployed to heorku without error, but when I try to open the app from within the heroku web interface I'm told there is an Application Error.

Examining the app's log from the heroku cli reveals:
```
2019-10-24T14:55:41.843711+00:00 heroku[router]: at=error code=H10 desc="App crashed" method=GET path="/" host=slackinkeyshape.herokuapp.com request_id=a44dbec5-5223-4edf-985f-4331feaa76b2 fwd="81.131.144.153" dyno= connect= service= status=503 bytes= protocol=https

```
Does anyone have any ideas?

Thanks
I'm trying to troubleshoot an existing slackin configuration on Heroku, but I'm not the one that originally set it up and don't have any info on how it was done. The build deploys just fine, but I get an application error splash page when trying to load the app in a web browser.

I can't seem to find any documentation at all on how to actually set this up, so at this point I'm just guessing. Am I just missing it somewhere?
Moved the HTML and CSS to Next.js pages, and the API routes for the Slack endpoints, the migration is ready and here are some key differences:

- All Slack API calls are using the new OAuth recommended by Slack except one, the only way to invite an user is by using an undocumented API and a legacy token, therefore the current setup still requires a legacy token, the only difference is that an OAuth token can be used for the other API calls
- The API section and iframe were removed
- The old implementation has been deleted
Node has moved on since this was created, and the version now needs pinning to maintain compatibility. As described in #404 .
As of node:slim (v12) the docker build does not work due to incompatiblity between node12 and gulp3.

Whether you upgrage gulp to 4 version you raise other issue.

As workaround I replace the from into Dockerfile by node:10-slim 

Want to checkout IBM Cloud Slackin deployment. I have an IBM cloud account. Questions:

1. Is it free?
2. What is the github url (https://github.com/rauchg/slackin) or do I need to create my own repo?
3. when/where is slackin/.bluemix/nls/messages.yml customized?

As discussed in #394 , you cannot use `now` version 2 to deploy with the current structure.

This PR switches to `now` v2 support.
