Id like to use this as a menu where I would only allow for one item to be enabled (highlighted) at a time. Does not seem to be anyway to iterate through items to enable/disable them and no flag to disable all items when one is selected.
Why:
*updated the project to allow Carthage to build
*bumped the deployment target to iOS 9

This change addresses the need by:
*adding new framework target and referencing the RNFrostedSidebar.h
*sharing the framework scheme so Carthage can build
*updated project files to iOS 9 as per Xcode 7 standard

Maybe it is just my setup however when I try to display the side panel in IOS 9 , not happens.

Can't download (through cocoapods) the right version.
IMHO I think the problem is that the tag 0.2.0 hooks the same code/repository of the 0.1.1. 

In the podspec is specified  
s.source = { :git => 'https://github.com/rnystrom/RNFrostedSidebar.git', :tag => s.version.to_s }

But if I look in the tag 0.2.0 everything is the same of the 0.1.1 and not the same of the master. 

Thanks in advance

If there are more than five items, the tab bar concept breaks down. I have embedded my controllers in UINavigation and after five tabs, it won't show the Navbar etc., I think because it is doing "more" or something first?

With the follow code：

let leftItemIcons = ["musicBarItem", "lightBarItem", "bleBarItem", "settingBarItem"]
var leftItemColors = [UIColor.black25PercentColor(), UIColor.black25PercentColor(), UIColor.black25PercentColor(), UIColor.black25PercentColor()];

 var leftBar = RNFrostedSidebar(images: leftItemIcons, selectedIndices: NSIndexSet(index: 1), borderColors: leftItemColors);
leftBar.delegate = self;
leftBar.show();

It failed at the line view.imageView.image = image; in [_images enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(UIImage *image, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop)

Is it possible to also blur out status bar once the menu appears on top?

How can I delete circular shape in the images of sidebar? I use your control in my project, it's awesome. But I need hide the circular shape.

Thanks in advance!

Here are a lot fixes and new features included...

Sidebar now move down if the parentviewcontroller has a navigation bar
that is shown. Further more, the blur image gets cropped so that I
matches the new position. Does not work well with orientation changes … Need some way to handle the orientation change and animate it nicely.
