Transition object appears front of TabBar after dismissing second view controller.
   Hi there! First of all, I want to say that I love Motion a lot, it is a great thing which allows developers to do awesome stuff in their apps. I want to use it in our project a lot, but I am currently having several issues, and I would like to help finding and fixing them... 

   Along with Motion, I am using NVActivityIndicatorView, and I noticed that after several Motion transitions, my NVActivityIndicatorView animations work with some delay, and the more Motion transitions I perform, the worse it gets for NVActivityIndicatorView. Here is a video of a simple project I made. I tap "Animation" button to trigger NVActivityIndicatorView animation, it works fine. Then I do 10 Motion transitions and tap "Animation" again. You can see a slight freeze/delay. I repeat it 2 more times and it gets worse with every 10 transitions. In my real app with more complex views and transitions this thing is noticeable even after 2-3 transitions

I discovered that HeroTransitions has the same issue:

And it happens not only with NVActivityIndicatorView but with other libraries too as you can see in that discussion
