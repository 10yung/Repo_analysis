**What version of WebTorrent Desktop are you using?**
Master branch https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent-desktop/commit/e341367583b9efd9f2e5e6d6f7a4a9cee7cde3e8

**What operating system and version?**
Windows 10

**What happened?**
Tried to drag in a folder with audio files, nothing from happened from a user perspective.

**What did you expect to happen?**
To see my audio folder appear as a torrent entry.

**Are you willing to submit a pull request to fix this bug?**
Always

Browser process shows the following error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'readEntries' of undefined
    at readEntries (C:\Users\Borewit\code\github\drag-drop\index.js:176)
    at C:\Users\Borewit\code\github\drag-drop\index.js:179
```
Pointing to [drag-drop/index.js line 179](https://github.com/feross/drag-drop/blob/89fd6bdeb63ba19493e658b27058dca127953ef4/index.js#L179), which I think is missing the argument `reader`.

What I don't understand, why I am running in this issue now.

Blocked by: [drag-drop#52](https://github.com/feross/drag-drop/issues/52) (no worries, it's all within the familiy ;-)


guys, the .torrent file generated via web torrent desktop is not recognized by any other web torrent application or cloud is this normal? Can't sow the same common torrents in which all software share?
I just downloaded the new deb.  If there are any published hashes, let alone signed hashes, I didn't  see them. It's not that hard, guys. In 2019, it's pretty much a basic security procedure to hash your final products with at least a sha256 sum and publish a gpg signed text file with all your hashes.  Learning gpg sufficiently from square 0 shouldn't take more than 30 minutes. Establishing a public key and publishing it, maybe 10. Hashing the files and signing the list of hashes maybe another 10. At most.

After installing _webtorrent-desktop_0.21.0_amd64.deb_ on my OS and then restarting. 

**The app does not open or show the GUI**... i've been using the CLI version with VLC to watch my torrents but is not very comfortable to use...

v0.21.0

**What did you expect to happen?**
Nothing, no extended volume overlay with playback controls
**Are you willing to submit a pull request to fix this bug?**
no
At times, the file gets downloaded partially and the status gets updated to 100%. There's no way to solve the problem unless the torrent is deleted from the list and pasted again, after which it checks the existing data and downloads the rest.

A 'force recheck' option would be highly beneficial, along with using a specified list of trackers to download every torrent.

Usage - Right click on torrent - select force recheck/update tracker
It would be nice to have built in search for Archive.org, Librivox, and all arbitrary torrents using trackerless (DHT-based) connections. 

There was once a cool project that did this: 
* https://web.archive.org/web/20160204020224/https://github.com/StrikeOrg/strike-search
* (mirror) https://github.com/jakop345/strike-search
* https://torrentfreak.com/strike-public-tracker-dht-searches-presented-cleanly-150321/

Now there is still https://github.com/btdig/dhtcrawler2
After fixing some `electron@7` [bugs](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent-desktop/pull/1751) related to the deprecation of [callback based version of functions](https://electronjs.org/releases/stable?version=7#breaking-changes), @alxhotel correctly bring the question of choosing to go full **promise style** or **sync style** when interacting with `electron`.

I created this issue so we can discus about it 😉

My opinion is to use **sync style** unless there is any drawback (performance, ...) 😅

What do you think?
