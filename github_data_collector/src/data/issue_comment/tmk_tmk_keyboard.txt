terminal usb converter does not work in windows 10.
- Add support for DEC LK411/LK450 keyboards to PS/2 to USB converter. See  [LK411.md](converter/ps2_usb/LK411.md) for details.
- Also add compact [keyboard debugging](converter/ps2_usb/README.md#debugging-keyboard) similar to (but clearer, I hope) Soarer Converter's diagnostic output. `#define DEBUG_KEYBOARD_VERBOSE` to restore the old debugging.
- `#define PJRC_BOOTLOADER_JUMP` uses PJRC's code for jumping to the Teensy bootloader (`HalfKay`).
I've been doing a lot of testing between Soarer's Converter, TMK and QMK to find what is best for my IBM 5150. This issue is a way of stopping people wasting their time.

By far the most reliable for daily use is Soarer's converter. It seems to have no issues with any of the three keyboards I tested with. TMK & QMK seem to have persistent issue interpreting the protocol correctly. This eventually results in either phantom key presses or stuck keys.

I tried a number of different power supplies to ensure this wasn't a result of undervoltage. The issues persisted.

My recommendation is not to use the XT converter for these keyboards.
When I enter “avrdude -patmega32u4 -cavr109 -b57600 -Uflash:w:usb_usb.hex -PCOM11”, it shows“avrdude: ser_open(): can't open device "COM11": No such file or directory”。In fact, I used the u2u PCB file you designed.And the Atmega32u4 chip on this u2u comes from an Arduino Pro micro.The strange thing is that you can upload files on the Arduino IDE with this u2u.Can you help me analyze the reasons for this?
It seems to need to set 'bootkey' before jump(wdt reset) to the bootloader.

It needs code to initialize registers for ATMega32u2.

I'm trying to convert a [NMB (Hi-Tek) RT101+](https://deskthority.net/wiki/NMB_RT-100/RT-8200_series) to USB. It has a switch that can toggle between AT/XT. I have it set to AT mode and I'm trying to use the TMK ps2_usb converter to convert it to USB. Note that the keyboard works flawlessly with a blue cube ps2/usb converter. 

I'm trying to use a pro micro, which is possibly causing problems. I don't have a teensy 2.0 on hand to test, but I'd prefer to get this working with a pro micro anyway as I have some other AT/ps2 keyboards to convert and if I can use a pro micro it's a lot cheaper. 

I've wired things  [to this](https://imgur.com/a/WDXwOqy). I've Tried all three ps2_usb variants (default make, make rev1, and make rev2), and none work. I also tried jumping J1 for 5V operation, to no effect. 

Behavior is as follows: 

- For default make (just running make in the ps2_usb directory), I get nothing at all. When I plug it into my windows computer I don't even get the "Device connected" sound. Though, the scroll lock, num lock, and caps lock LEDs flash on for a moment right when it's plugged in. 

- For make rev1 (#make -f Makefile.rev1), at least windows recognizes that something was plugged in (Device connected sound plays), and HID listen sees something plugged in, but I can't get any output from pressing keys. 

- Behavior for make rev2 (#make -f Makefile.rev2) is identical to default make, i.e. windows doesn't even think anything got plugged in. 

Let me know if I need to clarify anything. I'm at a loss here and definitely would appreciate help! Thanks! 







Problem: Pressing Caps lock and 'a' key quickly and repeatedly makes the converter unresponsive.

It seems this part which handles LED control report from host causes the problem. That code is executed from ISR and may take long.

Build option `INTERRUPT_CONTROL_ENDPOINT` controls how the code is excuted. Without the build option it is called out of ISR context.

https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/blob/f57b7b9087fbded607883a372a3acbb811a622da/converter/pc98_usb/Makefile#L52-L53

Workaround: Build without `INTERRUPT_CONTROL_ENDPOINT` option.
The converter can still misses key immediately after Caps lock but doesn't completely freeze.
