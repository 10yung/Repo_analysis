Hi,

Has anyone worked on increasing the number of facial landmarks from the current 5 points to 68 points, as like in other facial detection algorithms such as Dlib? We are trying to use the Face Detection algorithm for us to help in Face Spoof detection, for which 5-landmarks doesn't suffice.
Hi, thank you for this work and the source code!

Regarding the MIT license of this repo -- if you have used FDDB/WIDERFace dataset for training your models (which are provided only for the research purposes, not commercial usage), how can the weights you provide be on the MIT license?

MIT license allows anyone to use this commercially, which is a derivative work of the images which are not allowed to be used commercially.

Looking forward to your reply. Thanks!
Found lagging if frame size goes beyond 100KB. Face detection accuracy affects if resolution comes down. What could be the optimal frame resolution and size for the face detect method?
Hi there,

  I am not a student right now and do not want to buy a Matlab license.  Is there a way to use Octave instead?

  Also, is there a major difference between the C++ and Python versions for detecting profile/side faces?

Thanks,

Nobu
When I run demo.m in MTCNNv2 , there occurs an error:
    _Undefined function or variable 'rectgenpathangle'._
How can I fix it ?
请问boundbox_regression输出的四个值，是关于【左上角坐标，宽，高】的，还是【左上角坐标，右下角坐标】的？代码貌似和论文不一致，求教。
比如说得到150x151这种裁剪出的人脸图像，怎么用代码解决
in generateBoundingBox function of  the file generateBoundingBox.m, there is "boundingbox=[fix((stride*(boundingbox-1)+1)/scale) fix((stride*(boundingbox-1)+cellsize-1+1)/scale) score reg]". Then my question is why plus 1.

Thank you in advance.
It is too slow to do the face detection and alignment when dataset is large if process images one by one. So I wander if it is possible to change your script a little bit to make it work when the input is a batch?
