Now that Intellij supports [custom themes](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/03/brighten-up-your-day-add-color-to-intellij-idea/) it might be a good idea to turn this scheme into a theme.

There are two main advantages to this:
* You can change all colors in the IDE to match the solarized theme, not only the ones in the editor window
* You can distribute the theme as a plugin for easier installation

The [VS Code solarized theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanolsonx.solarized) might be a good source of inspiration.
I'm running:

IntelliJ IDEA 2018.1.1 (Ultimate Edition)
Build #IU-181.4445.78, built on April 9, 2018
Licensed to n/a / Kevin Stanton
Subscription is active until December 24, 2018
JRE: 1.8.0_152-release-1136-b27 x86_64
JVM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM by JetBrains s.r.o

I've tried importing the settings.jar several times and Solarized Light and Dark never show up in settings, I only see Darcula and the defaults.
TIL by default IntelliJ shows static methods with _italic_ font.

I find it's useful to see that when method is static or not.
I suggest to make it italic in solarized theme too.


The actual self color is grey which makes it hard to distinguish from the rest. 
I would gently suggest #b58900 in Italic as in Spyder. 
many thx! 




There's many C# specific colors missing
Hello.
I use solarized light color scheme.
Currently I'm working on project with both languages: java and kotlin. And it's really hard to read code in kotlin after reading java code.
It has too many gray symbols, too _blue_ keywords.
It would be nice to have kotlin highlighting **almost** like java: same colors - same meaning.
**Setup**
- PyCharm 2017.1
- Solarized Dark (Darcula) from master

**Bug**
Foreground color matches matches the background color. Text is always hidden when cursor is inside backticks.

**Instructions**
- Launch PyCharm
- File > Settings > Editor > Colors & Fonts > Set Schema to `Solarized Dark (Darcula)`
- Editor > Colors & Fonts > Select `reStructuredText`
- reStructuredText > Select `Interpreted text`
- Place cursor inside `:ref:builders`

**Workaround**
For Interpreted text, disable the Foreground color or set it to a new color like base01 (RGB: 88 110 117).

Any recommendations on what color we should use from `Solarized_Colors.pdf`?
For some reason can't get it to work with Objective-C in AppCode. I know objective-c is one of the supported languages. Please see attached screenshot.

Kotlin 1.1 introduced this

I guess it'd be cool to integrate in the theme..
