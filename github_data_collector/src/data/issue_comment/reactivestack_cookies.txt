Having explicity set up the path as '/' when setting the cookie
`cookies.set(name, value, {  path: '/', expires: expires });`

when going to mysite.com/page/ 
then accepting cookies
checking in the browser the cookie path is '/page/' instead of '/'
now users can disable cookie in browser setting
In this case you can access to document.cookie, but canot rewrite it

for example
```
document.cookie = "test=cookie"
console.log(document.cookie) // "" - empty string
```

therefore  
```
  private _updateBrowserValues() {
    if (!this.HAS_DOCUMENT_COOKIE) {
      return;
    }

    this.cookies = cookie.parse(document.cookie);
  }
```
_updateBrowserValues called on getAll always reset cookie to empty object.

Hi,

It seems when I set a cookie name to uppercase, my example was like

'COOKIE_NAME'

Then if I logged out of my app and back in again, React wouldn't see it until I refreshed the page.  I tried lowercasing it 'cookie_name' and it worked

Riddle me this..
For e.g. can react-cookie trigger component re-render if the user clears the cookies in the browser?
