My OS: ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

do you any ideas to fix it?
Thank you for reading
Compiling using Go 1.12 gives the following error:

    cdata.Ref: relocation target runtime.acquirem not defined for ABI0 (but is defined for ABIInternal)
    cdata.Ref: relocation target runtime.releasem not defined for ABI0 (but is defined for ABIInternal)
Any plans on supporting 5.11? Or is this project dead? :skull:

title says it all.... just trying to figure out how I can register a singleton qml component with go-qml
Using Go1.5
and Qt 5.1.1

I did a diff between the @niemeyer code and the @amlwwalker code. This branch should only contain the changes required to get QML to work without using `GODEBUG=cgocheck=0`. I'm not an expert in cgo or QML, but I know that this branch works for me.

His comments in issue #179:

```
Hi All,

I ran into this error a while back. I can briefly explain what is going on here. go-qml passes (or receives, I can't remember) a pointer to a pointer to C code within the qml libraries. Doing so means that the Go garbarge collector cannot see whether the pointer has been released by the C code. This can lead to memory leaks so in go1.6 this was made a forbidden thing to do (and is only detected at runtime). So hence the error: cgo argument has Go pointer to Go pointer.

github.com/SjB/qml solves this in its latest branch, however SjB doesn't seem to be monitoring the repo, so I have forked it and although my knowledge of the low level api to the qml libraries is unknown to me, I am managing the code to make the examples work and plan to make small changes to make it convenient to use going forward. You can find it at https://github.com/amlwwalker/qml

I'm using it now actively, so I can help people get set up if they are struggling with post 1.6 qml and Go.

how fix?
What types I can use for QML model?
I try slice and map,but them not work.
int/bool work. 
But how I can update data in model without change size (len in demo modelview/delegate)?
Are there any plans to include this in some form? 

There are multiple libraries offering this, but they all seem to require owning the mainthread. As does go-qml.
