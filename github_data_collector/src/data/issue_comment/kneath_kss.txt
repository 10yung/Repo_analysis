Is there a way to add the `::selection` and `:target` as modifiers? 

I'm currently adding a special class for the modifier manually in the `kss-only.scss` (node implementation). Is there a better way?
 
Would be great to able to translate the styleguide to multiple languages using only one source file + maybe multiple translation files. Would make working in an international environment a bit more hassle free.

While not stabilized by the specification, it grows in popularity due to PostCSS and it's plugin possibilities. Some browsers already implemented them and I use them for about 6 months in my projects with help of PostCSS and PostCSS Next, replacing Sass for a future friendly alternative.

It might be worth a look for an implementation in kss.

The website is in the `gh-pages` branch of this Git repository. And is built with Jekyl.

PRs welcome!

From #116:

> Finding another acronym for KSS. Knyle Style Sheets was always meant to be silly, but a lot more people ended up using this than I imagined. I wouldn't mind something less silly.

Please post suggestions in the comments below. @kneath will be the final arbiter of the new backcronym.

FYI, "backcronym" is when you've decided on the acronym before you've decided on the meaning of the acronym. So we will keep "KSS", but change the meaning of it.

Is it fine to add codebeat badge to README? 

codebeat is automated code review tool for Swift, Ruby & Go that helps get instant feedback on code quality. 

"Quick wins" suggested by codebeat could be a nice candidate for a pull request and help other developers become contributors.

FYI. To be fully open and honest. I'm co-founder of codebeat

So yesterday I tried using kss to documenting my css. And I follow the documentation from http://warpspire.com/kss/styleguides/

Everything seems perfect until my capture method show an error: 
"undefined method `close' for nil:NilClass"
## app/controllers/kss_controller.rb:21:in `kss_block'

@example_html = capture(block)

I have a pull request over a year old. And there is a pull request from 2013. #92 

Do you need help maintaining this project?

My interest is in updating the KSS spec and in maintaining the kss.js script since I maintain the kss-node port. But I feel there must be others interested in the Ruby code in this repository.
