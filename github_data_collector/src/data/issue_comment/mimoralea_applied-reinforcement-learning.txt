Hi, 

First off, amazing job putting together these tutorials. Kudos! 

I am surprised why there is no activity here, it is a very valuable resource. I have started reading from start. I just have one question, since the last commit was almost 2 years ago, is the tutorial complete? I mean do you think it touches all the core foundations? In 2 years I expect there would have been lot of advancement in the subject, can you list important new topics that are not yet made part of this repository. So that i can continue following those elsewhere once I am finished with these.

thanks!
