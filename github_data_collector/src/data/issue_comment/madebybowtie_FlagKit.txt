It would be great if it would be possible to install with a Swift Package Manager. 

Tim Cook would love that!

There are supposed to be 13 red and white stripes on the US flag -- one for each of the original 13 colonies.  FlagKit's current rendition has 15.  **Not only is this numerically incorrect, but it distorts the appearance of the flag as well.**

I found your [earlier justification](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/issues/11) unconvincing:

> The asset itself is in @1x 15 px high, I would have had to make two of the stripes 2px and the other eleven 1px. And that would look super bad. So it's a design compromise sadly.

May I suggest instead of making some stripes 2px for @1x (which would indeed look super bad), that you instead simply omit the last two stripes, which shouldn't be there anyway?  Flags cannot be made to fit into identical heights and widths because they have so many different aspect ratios and detail positioning.  I believe most users will prefer a 13px height flag that's correct and has the expected aesthetic over one that is a targeted 15px that's factually wrong and aesthetically odd-looking.

Here are the *before* and *after* of the proposed change at @1x:

**Before:** ![US flag too many stripes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/master/Assets/PNG/US.png) (15 stripes &ndash; ***wrong***)
 **After:** ![US flag correct number of stripes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjhughes/FlagKit/master/Assets/PNG/US.png) (13 stripes &ndash; ***correct***)




[This pull request](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/pull/77) has similar fixes for @1x, @2x, @3x, and SVG.  Hope you like this.
Hi,

I have found that some below country flags are missing from list.

There are a lot of flags with linear gradients, which are give ids like "linearGradient-1".."linearGradient-n".

So, let's say you have the AR flag, followed by RO.
AR has two linear-gradient elements: id="linearGradient-1" and id="linearGradient-2"
RO has 3: id="linearGradient-1", id="linearGradient-2" and id="linearGradient-3"

In this case, if they are on the same HTML page, the RO flag will use the gradients 1 and 2 from the AG file:

**Add New feature - Flag to Emoji**

**Usage**
```swift
   detailLabel.text = flag.emoji // ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª
```

**Limitation**

Some regional flag like califonia in USA(US-CA) not supported currently because depending on OS's supporting unicode
However almost 99% flags used in FlagKit covered added unit tests

I wrote a quick lib to allow others to quickly use these icons in their web apps, would like to add a link here so others can use it
