Currently the readme for `scripts/` is not really as readable as the main one, but it's also obscure as it's not in the main directory. Isn't it better to have it as a section in the main readme, being well formatted aswell?

It would be nice to have a command line option so that the screen is not cleared. Right now, if you suspend pipes (C-z), type some stuff, then resume pipes, it will draw on top of the dirty terminal and I think it looks really cool! It might be as simple as toggling `tput clear` on line 268? I'll give it a try when I have some time.
Hello!

When I run the command `pipes.sh`, I get the following error:

`ryanm@sirinat0r:~/pipes.sh$ pipes.sh`
`tput: unknown terminal "xterm-termite"`
`ryanm@sirinat0r:~/pipes.sh$ `

Any suggestions or workarounds?

Hi, I stumbled upon pipes but couldn't find any packages for it. I work on Snapcraft, so I put together a snap of it. If you build this locally and push to the Snap Store, millions of Linux users can [browse](https://snapcraft.io/store) their way to it.

To build, `snap install snapcraft` from Ubuntu, or [install Multipass](https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/multipass/releases) on MacOS then `brew install snapcraft`. Then run `snapcraft`.

To publish, [create an account](https://snapcraft.io/account), then:
```
snapcraft login
snapcraft register pipes-sh
snapcraft push --release=stable *.snap
```
Running pipes.sh on hyper.js only displays question marks. pipes.sh -t 4 and up is working but not the ones below.
I'm currently on Ubuntu 16.04, with various personalized font installed (font awesome, monaco, consolas). I've also installed consolas, that as far as i can see is the font on the readme file here on github, but when i run pipes, just question marks appears.
