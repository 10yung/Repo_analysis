Currently, the call to `Trim` is failing because column headers might be numbers or dates, which have no `Trim` method. Since any object has a `ToString` method, this should fix it.
If a sheet contains multiple rows with the same name, the Add-PivotTable invalidates the output file even that the columns are not used.
repro step:
Add a sheet with the two columns named the same.
New-Excel -Path C:\temp\test.xlsx | Add-PivotTable -WorkSheetName cases -PivotTableWorksheetName PT -PivotRows "col2" -Verbose -Passthru | Save-Excel -Path C:\Temp\outtest.xlsx
open outtest.xlsx in excel and it will try repair it

Please can somme explain me the meanning of this message and hwo to solve it

Fixes #71
Currently this module fails because of a very small bug.
Linux systems are case sensitive, where windows is not.
Currently this module throws an error on linux:

```
Add-Type : Cannot bind parameter 'Path' to the target. Exception setting "Path": "Cannot find path '/usr/local/share/powershell/Modules/PSExcel/1.0.2/lib/epplus.dll' because it does not ex
ist."

+ CategoryInfo          : WriteError: (:) [Add-Type], ParentContainsErrorRecordException

```

The fix is to replace the lowercase filename inside of PSExcel.psm1
Hi there, 
I successfully used this **great** module on WS2012R2 and I tried to do the same on an Azure VM running Ubuntu where I installed PowerShell version 6.1 

PSExcel was successfully installed with the Install-Module command and all module methods used so far were working as expected... until I tried to save the current $Excel object as shown below:

$Excel | Close-Excel -Save                              

Close-Excel : Error saving file.  Will not close this ExcelPackage: Exception calling "Save" with "0" argument(s): "Error saving file /myfolder/TemplateTest.xlsx"
At line:1 char:11
+  $Excel | Close-Excel -Save
+           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [Write-Error], WriteErrorException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WriteErrorException,Close-Excel

Maybe there is something in the way relative/absolute paths are handled that should be adapted to run against the Linux file system?
Please let me know whether additional details are required to help fixing this issue..

Thanks!

Roberto

Ran this:
`Import-Module .\PSExcel.psm1`

Got this in return:
`Add-Type : Could not load file or assembly 'file:///F:\PowerShell\ClassComp\PSExcel-master\PSExcel\lib\epplus.dll' or
one of its dependencies. Operation is not supported. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131515)
