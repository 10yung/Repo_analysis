The patch for PEP 558 ([bpo-30744](https://bugs.python.org/issue30744)) adds a number of new frame-related
C APIs. This prepatory patch migrates frameobject.h to the modern layout
with multiple include files so the PEP reference implementation can clearly
separate the stable ABI additions from the full CPython C API additions.
Mention that the function implicitly creates a new event loop only if called from the main thread.
