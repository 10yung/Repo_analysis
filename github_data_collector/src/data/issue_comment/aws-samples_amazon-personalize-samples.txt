Great to see that Amazon Personalize now [supports batch inference](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-batch-recommendations-in-amazon-personalize/) as well as real-time. It would be cool if that functionality could be integrated in to the existing or a new sample.
That's what worked for me:

- AmazonS3FullAccess
- AmazonPersonalizeFullAccess
- AmazonSageMakerFullAccess

I reran the coldstart demo and found that the hrnn-coldstart precision@5 has gone up to 0.092 from 0.040. The baseline has also gone up to 0.0076 from 0.0044. I can understand that there is a shuffle on the item-ids, which causes the baseline changes. But I was wondering if it would cause this amount of variance in the trained model, too.

Related, the demo notebook created fake_user. I wonder if that is actually necessary.

Attaching a script with the new results:

Thanks.

We should have a demo that showcases how to deploy a Lambda function that reacts to some trigger, probably S3 to then put an event into Personalize.
We would like to have a curated list of other demos using Personalize, create a section of the ReadMe to link to those and provide context around their usage.
Create a notebook that illustrates how to interpret a model using the metrics provided.
Create a notebook that shows the impact on a model by adding User Metadata to it.
Create a notebook that shows the impact on a model by adding item metadata.
Provide a notebook that explains how to leverage both KMS with Personalize to secure information but to also allow Personalize to read encrypted data from an existing S3 bucket.
