I love Lightning.
It has been my default browser for years.

But I notice that it accumulates a ton of data.

Data that it doesn't seem to need to function.

Is there some way for the 
user settings to be saved as data, and whatever the other stuff is to be stored in the cache so that it could be cleared without affecting the settings?

Search bar suggestions do not recognize non-Latin characters. For example, "Kiedyś" is shown as "Kiedy�".




Shortcut for going to the URL field

Hi,

Great app! It's about 30% faster or more than Firefox on my slow device with an e-ink screen. Very useful for productivity.

I always work with bluetooth keyboard. Please make a shortcut like Alt+D for going to the address field. 

Thanks.
Reader mode is difficult to follow as the lines are too close together. Can the line spacing be increased.

Regards Craig
The call to `new Bookmark.Entry` had the URL and title parameters in the wrong position, leading to broken bookmark imports.

I am using Lightning version 5.1.0 from Play Store on Android 9
There is no notification for qeued, in progress and completed downloads started from browser.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open browser and navigate to website.
2. Press on image and press download.
3. Download starting message is shown at the bottom of the screen
4. No notification for either download qeued, progress or completion is shown in system notifications

What is expected:
Notification shown that download is qeued, in progress, completed.

I have Download Manager notifications enabled for in progress, qeued and completed with behaviours set to show silently.
Tested on phone after factory reset.
After the the last few updates Lightning browser has sadly become unusable in my cell phone (Meizu M5 Android 6.0). Every time I enter a some sites it will crash the entire app, I'm not sure what triggers this but It happens on some sites everytime (https://elpais.com/ is one that comes to my mind that constantly makes the app to crash), sometimes even while just browsing google. I've been using this browser for a couple of years and this never happened to me before. I've also noticed a few people reporting the same on Play Store.

I downloaded the app on F-Droid, I've tried reinstalling, different user-agents and the problem persist. 

Let me know how to provide more information, I'm not sure if there is a way to get a log file or something.
This change converts Preconditions and ThemeUtils to kotlin files.
