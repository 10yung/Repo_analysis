Hi, would it be possible to be able change sorting 'on-the-fly' via a keyboard shortcut or a similar method?
Ie. say for example Alt+S once, sort by User, 
Alt+S again, sort / 'cycle' to the next available column...
Ctrl could maybe further be used for ascending / descending order on whatever 'selected' column.

Just a generic suggestion, hopefully i'm making sense above :-)
Basically a way to switch view fast to the top possible 'offenders',
without having to q, procs --sortd rss, q, procs --sorta tcpport etc...

All the best
