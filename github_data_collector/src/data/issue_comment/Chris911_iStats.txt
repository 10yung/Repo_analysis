Hello,

I'm running iStats 1.6.1 on a 2015 MacBook Pro with MacOS 10.15.2.

I have noticed that temperatures only update around once every 5 minutes when using iStats. For example, my cpu temperature has been stuck at 48.13 for a while now, even though I'm not idling anymore. I made sure to reset SMC and NVRAM. No luck. 

Intel power gadget seems to be updating temperatures consistently, however they are slightly hotter that iStats (I assume it's reading a different sensors).

To replicate:
* Let computer idle
* Run "watch istats"
* Take note of cpu temp
* Open a browser or other program
* Check CPU temp

If you're having the same issue as me, you'll notice that there is no change in any of the temperatures. 

Thanks!


**Edit**: I have noticed putting my laptop to sleep for a few seconds, the reawakening it forces the temperatures to update.


**Edit**:  I have noticed that temps do update regularly, but only whilst the laptop is on charge. As soon as the machine is disconnected all stats freeze for at least 5 minutes.
After a while, the app stopped working. I am getting the following error:
```
Failed to execute process '/usr/local/bin/istats'. Reason:
The file '/usr/local/bin/istats' specified the interpreter '/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/2.3/usr/bin/ruby', which is not an executable command.
```
It would be great if it could tell you if the batter was charging, discharging or full. 

I have ruby 2.6.0 on macOS Catalina 10.15.2.  I tried installing iStats in my normal account, but received a lack of write access error.  Subsequently, I logged into my administrator account and oddly also received an unable to write errorâ€¦ I manually changed the permissions for the target folder and tried installing again, only to receive even more errors ending with Errno::EACCE.  Is this an issue with my configuration?
The specific final line was
    Permission denied @ rb_sysopen - /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.6.0/cache/parseconfig-1.0.8.gem
  
CFStringGetCStringPtr usually returns null. I added a fallback with CFStringGetCString to allocate a string. This is consistent and in compliance with Apple. The following link should give a bit more insight.

[CFStringGetCStringPtr Obj-C doc](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/1542133-cfstringgetcstringptr?language=objc)

With this fallback type of system, older systems will still behave as they did and newer ones will get the battery string the new way. Either way, it should all work the same. The only thing I'm unclear of and maybe you can help with, is how does the freeing of the pointer work? I'm not familiar with rb_str_new2, so I don't know if the GC will clean up that pointer or not.

If there's any improvements I can make or you can shed more info on how this works, that would be great. Thanks for this great little tool, you saved me plenty of time reinventing the wheel. 

p.s. Can you also give a bit more info as to how to better/quicker debug? Thanks again!

After I upgraded to macOS Catalina, the Battery health indicator is no longer working and displays "unknown":

I'm using iStats 1.6.1 on macOS Catalina 10.15.0.
I'm embarrassed about this, but I still use Mac OS  X Lion... I just **really** like Aqua. 
There's one problem... isn't the only way to update Ruby is with Homebrew? 
Homebrew drops support for out-of-date OSes... like all the versions of Mac OS I have at home :)
Whenever I try to install, it shows this:  
`Anfunfun's-MacBook-Air:~ computer$ gem install iStats
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError)
    You don't have write permissions into the /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8 directory.
Anfunfuns-MacBook-Air:~ computer$ sudo ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future gem install iStats
Password:
ERROR:  Error installing iStats:
	iStats requires Ruby version >= 1.9.3.`

So in other words I'm stuck? Homebrew said it wouldn't have any support on Yosemite, and the install failed for.. even installing Homebrew on Yosemite. Doubt it would work on an even older OS.

Thanks! 
Add sensor description for Mac mini Late 2009 nVidia MCP Controller.
This change supports a configuration clause in `sensors.conf` that allows setting a persistent preference for temperature scale. The configuration group allows for other possible future settings to be included in it. A new command line option is added so that if `fahrenheit` is set in the configuration it can be overridden on the command line.

Example section of `sensors.conf`:

```
[app_config]
temperature_scale = fahrenheit
```

The new command line option is `-c, --celcius`. The help option has been updated to reflect the new option.
