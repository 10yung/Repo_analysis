During the course of scripting in iPython while using this extension all of your code is centered.

Restarting iPython, restarting the laptop and uninstalling the extension with pip still doesn't solve this problem. 

All my code is centered and now unreadable in iPython.

Please help with how to completely remove this extension and return alignment of all code in iPython to normal.
Not sure if this project is still maintained, but on the off chance anyone is listening... BeautifulSoup has a [sort of obnoxious warning](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33511544/how-to-get-rid-of-beautifulsoup-user-warning) if you don't explicitly tell it which HTML parser to use. That's a particular problem for this IPython extension because it frequently creates new soups, triggering the warning frequently.

The fix is to explicitly specify an HTML parser [here](https://github.com/Psycojoker/ipython-beautifulsoup/blob/master/soup.py#L64) and also in the [p shortcut](https://github.com/Psycojoker/ipython-beautifulsoup/blob/master/soup.py#L128-L131). That in turn requires some way for me to tell the extension which parser I want, probably `configure_ipython_beautifulsoup` would be a good place to do that.
CSS styles of displayed pages override the IPython notebook interface styles with URLs like e.g. http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com.

Without using IFrames, I'm not sure whether it's possible to avoid this without something like:

```
def cleaned_beautifulsoup_copy(soup):
    copy = BeautifulSoup(unicode(soup))
    for node in copy('script'):
        node.extract()
    # <here
    for node in copy('style'):
        node.extract()
    # /here>
    return copy
```

EDIT: Also JS.
