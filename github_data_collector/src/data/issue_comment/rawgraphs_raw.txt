Automate graph creation

Hello, 

For my project, I would like to automate the process of graph creation. 

Currently, raw takes the data and ask the user to make two decisions:
1) Select chart
2) Map the variables

I would like to automate these two steps. My algorithm will be choosing the appropriate chart type and variables.

So in this way, I would like to change the workflow of raw a bit. Can someone guide how to do that.? What files needs to be changed?

So far what I understood is controller.js gets the user input and triggers the raw.js to provide a suitable model. This then calls to the model and model dimension function, which further connects to the appropriate chart script. Then somehow it connects with directive.js. I could not understand completely what is the role of directives.js?

For this work, I really need to understand the raw at the deepest level. Can someone provide guidance to that?

Thanks

	
I was following along with the guide for adding a chart: https://github.com/rawgraphs/raw/wiki/Adding-New-Charts

Using the exact code that is specified in the guide, and here: https://github.com/densitydesign/raw/blob/master/charts/chart.js

At runtime you see an undefined error.
> TypeError: Cannot read property 'linear' of undefined

It seems as though the latest version of "d3" no longer uses this `linear()` method:

`var xScale = d3.scale.linear()...`
should be 
`var xScale = d3.scaleLinear()...`

Unless ofc there is a need to lock the version of d3 package?
Hi Guys 

I've been circulating rawcharts to colleagues who haven't any experience with d3 or data vis before and while they like the capabilities they found it difficult to get started, and have feedback the following:

When new people start using rawcharts, It is difficult to know which example data sets work well with which charts,  you seem to need to know the data structures for the charts before you start, which make it difficult for people who are new to get started.

The workflow at the moment is Select Example Data / add your own -> Select chart type -> Configure 

Maybe swap around to Select Chart Type -> Add Data / Select Example Data -> Configure 

This would mean that you can then show the sample data sets that work best for a selected Viz - and even maybe have a default config for the data so that it shows an output sooner..   
  
Rawgraphs website doesn't work on Internet Explorer. Can anyone suggest how to make it compatible with IE.

Would it be possible to package this as a LibreOffice addon?  What sort of work would need to be done?
Is like alluvial diagram, but the elements are disposed in a single circumference

I would like to be able to execute a SPARQL query to a SPARQL endpoint directly from RAWGraph. 

I propose to add the ability to select SPARQL as source here:

![rawgraph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/583021/57458213-3d7d3f00-7271-11e9-85e0-23d893a81313.jpg)

Minimal features needed:
* Input field for SPARQL endpoint
* Input field for SPARQL query (ideally with SPARQL syntax highlighting enabled)
* Optional: A way to provide a user/pw for the SPARQL endpoint

We created the library [d3-sparql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-sparql), which returns a JSON object oriented at what d3-csv is doing. It is properly converting [RDF literal data types](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Graph-Literal) to native JavaScript types. I think this would be a great starting point for implementing it.

We would be happy to help on that but I would need some pointers about where in the source code we would have to add that to get an idea of the complexity.

This is related to #189, which simply seems to pass a SPARQL query string.
Hello,
I found a link to http://wikidata.rawgraphs.io/?url=/ in Wikidata Query Service (see screenshot of WQS below). But http://wikidata.rawgraphs.io does not seems to work. For instance, if I try to add the following URL, the error message is displayed: Whoops! Something wrong with the URL you provided. Please be sure it is the correct address.

`https://query.wikidata.org/#SELECT%20%3FgenreLabel%20%28COUNT%28%3Fitems%29%20AS%20%3Fcount%29%0AWHERE%20%7B%0A%20%20%3Fitems%20wdt%3AP31%20wd%3AQ215380%20.%20%23%20get%20things%20that%20are%20bands%0A%20%20%3Fitems%20wdt%3AP136%20%3Fgenre%20.%20%23%20get%20the%20genre%20of%20the%20band%0A%20%20SERVICE%20wikibase%3Alabel%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20bd%3AserviceParam%20wikibase%3Alanguage%20%22en%22%20.%20%23get%20labels%20in%20english.%0A%20%20%20%20%23with%20this%20service%2C%20you%20can%20add%20%22Label%22%20suffix%20to%20any%20variable.%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D%0A%0AGROUP%20BY%20%3FgenreLabel`

It seems that http://wikidata.rawgraphs.io is expecting a URL of type https://query.wikidata.org/sparql?query= which is not the case of the WQS URLs.
