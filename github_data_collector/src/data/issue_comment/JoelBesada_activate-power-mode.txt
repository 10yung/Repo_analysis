It would be awesome if we can record total points, combo series etc. in .activate-power-mode file or json
I have another tool that updates a file, while this file was appended to the points started flaring up. However Atom was sort getting 5 -10 lines at a time not 1 line, 1 line, 1 line.. The writing tool is going faster than what would be sane for a text editor. 

It'd be nice if this tool could (when file is re-loaded externally) it would increase the points by the correct number of lines that were added. 

Or if there was just a setting to watch line count and nothing more than that.
