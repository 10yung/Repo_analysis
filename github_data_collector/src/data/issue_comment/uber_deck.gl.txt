When the viewport's longitude is close to the 180th meridian, the bounding box will look something like

|  | minX | maxX |
|--|--|--|
| boundingBox | -200 | -150 |
| tileIndex (z=4) | -0.88 | 1.33 |

The old calculation clamps tileX to `[0, scale]` which was incorrect. tileX should loop between `[0, scale]` as the map repeats.

In the above case, the old calculation returns `[0, 0, 4]` and `[1, 0, 4]`. The correct result should be `[0, 0, 4]`, `[1, 0, 4]` and `[15, 0, 4]`.

#### Change List
- Fix bug in `getTileIndices`
- Unit tests

Change `npm run watch` for faster development within JupyterLab, which can call `jlpm run watch` on the package.json here.

Incorporate binary data transfer within the DeckGLWidget widget.

#### Description
Map attribution not clickable. 

The Mapbox [attribution page](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/attribution/#text-attribution) says 

> You must properly attribute **and link** Mapbox and OpenStreetMap when using the Mapbox Streets tileset

(emphasis mine).

I'm not affiliated with Mapbox, but it still seems like it would be nice to have each attribution source be a hyperlink.

#### Repro Steps
In any of the published examples, for example [`LineLayer`](https://deck.gl/#/examples/core-layers/line-layer), I can't click on the attribution link. For example, `(c) Mapbox` should be clickable, but when I try to click, it moves the map instead.

Thanks for this work. In the [Expression Parsers subsection](https://github.com/uber/deck.gl/blob/master/bindings/pydeck/docs/layer.rst#expression-parsers-in-pydeck-layer-arguments), I suggest adding a note that to have a string not be interpreted as an function, you need to nest quotes. For example, to set HexagonLayer.colorAggregation, one has to specify "Mean" as `color_aggregation="'MEAN'"` in pydeck. It may also be useful to link to the recently updated [conversion reference](https://github.com/uber/deck.gl/blob/master/docs/api-reference/json/conversion-reference.md) which was useful when figuring out how the "@@=" strings were interpreted.
