Hey,

I just want to report a warning raised by vis.js sinve this module tends to pass invalid parameters.

```
vis.js:3664 Invalid type received for "container". Expected: dom. Received [undefined] "undefined"

Problem value found at:
options = {
  configure: {
      container
  }
}
vis.js:3664 Invalid type received for "code". Expected: string. Received [undefined] "undefined"

Problem value found at:
options = {
  nodes: {
    icon: {
      code
    }
  }
}

vis.js:42587 Errors have been found in the supplied options object.
```

For parameter `code` the solution was simply passing "undefined" with extra quotes so it becomes a string after parsed by vis.js. For parameter `container` this simple fix didn't work, even though their code should be able to accept undefined.

I was able to fix it like this:

```
visJS_module.visjs_network(
    nodes_dict, edges_dict, [...],
    graph_id=title, container=f'mynetwork{title}',
    node_icon_code="'undefined'")
```

Would be nice to have this fixed ;)

Greetings,
Thomas
I am plotting multiple frames in one notebook using different  gaph_id for each frame. The graphs work in the notebook but not if I export the notebook to HTML. Only the last graph will show.  

Also any idea how I can export to html without having to save the style file in the same folder. I would like to show some of the notebooks the same way you show your examples. Thank you
making a proper package so it can be installed via pip git+.  right now, the version on PyPI is out of date and not tracking this repository.  this will allow someone to install from github source (right now pip install loads a deprecated version that will not import).
I encountered this with a newer version of Jupyter notebook. I think it has to do with a change of the Tornado version.

This is how to replicate:

(pull the most recent image from Docker, 3 days old at the time of writing)
 docker run -p 8888:8888 jupyter/scipy-notebook:6c85e4b43a26

do a !pip install visJS2jupyter

Next, follow the basic example (https://github.com/ucsd-ccbb/visJS2jupyter/blob/master/notebooks/default_params_example/visJS2Jupyter_basic_example.ipynb)

Use f12 to look at the console error.

The line is crashes on is: function init() { window.parent.setUpFrame(); return true; }

I believe that using <iframe sandbox="allow-same-origin">  may solve it, but it may need to be called from the Jupyter notebook rather than the iframe itself. In any case, the current implementation looks broken. My way of solving it was to go back to an older version of the notebook stack (I still had an  ~4 months old image cached at my system, so I'm unable to give you the tag number that works).


Hi! I have a problem with displaying graphs on the cells (I am using Python 3.6 and Anaconda). When I run examples from "notebooks" folder I get an empty cell (
![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32366948/44918305-c0eea400-ad64-11e8-8c34-ea84d5d9eb9e.png)
). But if I export data to a separate HTML file and open it in a browser it's OK (

). What can I do to see the content right on the Jupyter Notebook cells?
I am using Python 3.5 and Networkx 2.1, I am able to do the imports and I converted the `edges = G.edges()` to a list and added positions for x,y for each node as in `nodes_dict = [{"id":n,"x":pos[n][0]*10,"y":pos[n][1]*10} for n in nodes]` to make it work.

When I try to display the graph using
`visJS_module.visjs_network(nodes_dict, edges_dict, time_stamp=0)`
it shows the plot area, but nothing else, it is not zoomable nor contains the graph.
