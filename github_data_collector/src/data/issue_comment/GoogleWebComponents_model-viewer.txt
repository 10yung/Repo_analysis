I work with 3D models for augmented reality and we are having a hard time trying to make our 3D viewer parameters make the object seems closer to what it will be in the AR environment. We use blender evee to compare the 3D models to the real object but in our 3D viewer it appears to have a really strong light that make our objects seen lighter and/or too white (especially with white objects), sometimes it looks to bright in one side and in the other side of the same object, it is really dark, doesn't have a smooth transition between shadow and light, but in augmented reality it seems darker, close to blender but not so realistic.
So if we darken the model to match the viewer, it will be too dark for AR.
Does someone know the best parameters to use in a viewer so it will look closer to AR?

Hello, I have a question on starting AR mode.

Is 'Tap to place' function exists?
When I use AR on model viewer, the model spawned right after it detected stabilized place.
I want to place it where I want to put on.

Any one can help me, thanks.

Our repo is now a 2.35Gb download, which is pretty ridiculous, especially for a small project. It's almost entirely fidelity golden images, which would be better served by Git LFS. Of course in order to switch, we'll also have to rewrite our history (the idea being to keep it, but simply in a new place). This is dangerous, so I'm thinking I'll fork this into my own repo and give it a shot there so we can see how it works.
<model-viewer> already have lazy loading of 3D models in (which is awesome). It'd be nice to piggyback on that functionality and make the poster lazyload as well. Especially since posters don't have srcset support for multiple resolutions, it can take a lot of bandwidth if posters are big. 
### Description

I'm getting a strange issue where the model disappears when i switch tabs, wait a bit, then come back:
![hmm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/190692/71848253-0039ad00-309d-11ea-87f4-fa883d4b1ed4.gif)

I'm seeing this on https://model-viewer.glitch.me/

What's very bizarre is that the object doesn't just disappear. It's as if the exposure ramps up to the point where everything is white.

It happens fast, so here is a closeup of it happening in slo-mo:

I'm prototyping an app for a client and a requirement of it is to be installable and work offline. Using model-viewer with WebXR (behind 'unstable-webxr' attribute) runs nicely offline as PWA, but I'm considering Scene Viewer as a first option instead. So whenever the intent is issued to com.google.ar.core, the following dialog shows up:

![Screenshot_20200105-202142_Google](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1163553/71787809-b304ff00-2ffa-11ea-8d46-917cc73a851c.jpg)

Is there a way to circumvent that and use Scene Viewer in my offline app? I know this is not directly related to model-viewer.. Anyways, thanks for your great work guys!

### Description

If I set the model-viewer `src` to a server side rendered url, the AR button fails to the fallback viewer.  If set to a public url it all works as expected.  All three options reference the same file: `public/box.gltf`

Hit the following url on chrome in android to demonstrate the issue:

### Reference Issue
Fixes #874

Management of the "transparent" value for the background-color property.

To allow the property value to change (transparent -> opaque, opaque -> transparent), we create two instances of the Renderer class. The first to manage a background color, the second to manage transparency.

 Is it possible to view my GLTF and USDZ file in AR from clicking a button. I do not want to have a background poster or object preview just a button.
