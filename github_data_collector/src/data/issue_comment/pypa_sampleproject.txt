Hi.

I've tried renaming the source directory name to 'src'. Installing the produced package will install the package in `site-packages/src` and sure enough, importing it requires `import src` rather than `import package_name`.
[Example vs. Sample](http://www.differencebetween.net/language/words-language/difference-between-example-and-sample/)
Hello,

According to [this thread](https://www.mail-archive.com/distutils-sig@python.org/msg28845.html) and [that commit](https://github.com/pypa/packaging.python.org/commit/e2b5a3b9127cb05d50c188df80bd44f65d8d176f), it seems to me that with `setuptools`, the `keywords` argument of `setup()` expects a string containing a comma-separated list; however, the [setup.py example in the PyPA sample project](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.py) uses a string containing a space-separated list:

```
keywords='sample setuptools development'
```

Am I somehow mistaken? Besides, if comma-separated list is indeed the correct thing to use, it seems to me that it would be desirable to make it so that each item has spaces trimmed on both sides, so as to allow readable values such as `"sample, setuptools, development"`, as opposed to `"sample,setuptools,development"`. However, the [setuptools docs](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html) seem rather vague in this department:

> `keywords`: list-comma
> 
> (...)
> 
> list-comma: dangling list or string of comma-separated values

Thanks!

Provide an appveyor.yml file.

Asking, cause it give me trouble with python 3.5 with long description as markdown.
A setup.cfg is cleaner, is easy to parse, and does not require running
any Python code. Its usage should be showcased.
It would be nice to publish this project at https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/ as it changes (preferably, automatically on merge when things change).
Hi everyone,

I recently released a new Python Library (check here https://github.com/vertica/Vertica-ML-Python)
I followed the tutorial to allow PIP install and created the setup.py (I don't know if it is right)
I have inside the github page a folder named vertica_ml_python. I want that in the execution of 
pip install vertica_ml_python it goes to https://github.com/vertica/Vertica-ML-Python and copy paste the folder in the user site-packages folder (and that is all)
If someone can help me I would be really grateful.

Best,

Badr
Cf. https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html
It'd probably be better to encourage people to keep `__init__.py` minimal.
