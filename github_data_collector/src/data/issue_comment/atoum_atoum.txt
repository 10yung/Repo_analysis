There are several strange behaviors when trying to tests array values from the array asserter.

An example I've just fixed (see https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/commit/01e3e101c8614d5e9494ca55130c881f6d1ea149).

The `$this->array($event->fields)->string['name']->contains('Copy of %s')` should have fail because the name is "Copy of test event to clone". Most strange is I have the same code working and not working on different glpi branches, but the same atoum, php, etc... versions (I still cannot explain that).

In GLPI team, several person (incluging myself) already has quite strange issues with assertions on array values; but I cannot give more details, nor always reproducible use case right now.

the nightly in travis is php 8... and there is a lot of bug....
Given we have:

```php
<?php

interface MyThrowable extends Throwable {
    //...
}
```

If we try to mock this interface, it results in an error:

```
Class MyThrowable cannot implement interface Throwable, extend Exception or Error instead

Hello, I'm starting with Atoum i install it on debian 10 with composer.
My PHP Version: 7.3.4
My Atoum Version : 3.3
and I ran unit tests of atoum with the

```bash
vendor/bin/atoum --test-it
```
 command to check that it was working well on my environment. but I got this (maybe it's normal): 

There are 4 failures:

it's time to wake up a bit and check some PHP 7.4 compatibility 

PR:
- [x] https://github.com/atoum/atoum/pull/825 composer update
- [x] fix some issue related to [string casting warning](https://github.com/atoum/atoum/pull/827)
- [x] #830 add travis build
- [x] #835 fix deprecated unparenthesized
- [ ] #837 includer test fail
- [ ] #838 error on unit test

TO check
- [ ] mock generation with typed propertie
- [ ] mock generation with covariant https://wiki.php.net/rfc/covariant-returns-and-contravariant-parameters
- [ ] preloading activation/disactivation & mock generation https://wiki.php.net/rfc/preload
- [ ] does we need to add some asserter for the custom serialization attributes https://wiki.php.net/rfc/custom_object_serialization ?
- [ ] does we need to add some asserter for the ffi (see https://wiki.php.net/rfc/ffi ) ?



I think we should change a bit the behavior on the mock.
For now, if we want to change the behavior of it, we need to do what the visibility extension do, replace the mock generator with a child class. This doesn't allow atoum to be extended multiple time or you need to deal with conflict of multiple extension doing the same.

Example, the extension that I have (not publish for this reason) about trait, is become a bit harder because of this reason. So did you have any idea how we can improve a bit our mock engine to allow theses change and make it extendable?

Thanks
see https://github.com/atoum/atoum/issues/823 
if the directory where to put reports and the one with our code is the same, our project is deleted ... so a check should be made ;)
Adapt readme
* put in evidence the link to documentation
* add the convention of atoum in it (see https://github.com/atoum/atoum/issues/817#issuecomment-491858460 )
