SBShortcutMenuSimulator not working in Xcode 8.3.1 in iPhone 7
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11802308/26185118/7d9e791c-3bbb-11e7-8524-8c2ae344e1e0.png)

It was working fine when I was using Xcode 7 and iPhone 6S [ iOS 9.1 ]. Now I am using Xcode 8 & iPhone 7, this does not work anymore. It executes all commands properly but does not display the Quick Action Menu.

Please help.

我的 xcode 7.3 ，SBShortcutMenuSimulator 一直是意外退出。3D touch  。一直长按，没效果！


echo 'com.apple.mobilecal' | nc 127.0.0.1 8000
after that command , the Simulator show 'SpringBoard stop running'

Hey boys
I don't understand as the SBS works in Simulator. 
Someone can I explain to use this library ?

SBShortcutMenuSimulator does not work in Simulator 9.2 (shipped with Xcode 7.2).
