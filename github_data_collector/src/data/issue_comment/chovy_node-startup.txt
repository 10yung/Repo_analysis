I am getting the following when attempting to run: /etc/init.d/node-app start

 
    Starting node-app ...
    stdin: is not a tty
    node-app started with pid 16638
 

but it does not start (can start manually no problem).
It would be nice to have an option to open the log file in "append" mode (">>") rather than "open" mode (">") for the following reasons:
* for some applications it is desirable to keep the log file when the service is restarted. With the "open" mode the log file is overwritten each time when the service is started/restarted.
* using the append mode allows for simple log-rotation in "copytruncate" mode. While "copytruncate" does not always fit as you may loose some bytes of log-data during rotate, it comes handy if you don't want to restart the service after log rotation. The latter seems to be the only choice with node-startup as it does not support handling for the "HUP" signal to reopen the log file (which would be tricky anyway). 
One more issue:
 the PID recorded for the node-startup app is pointing to the bash shell used to start the script instead of referencing the node app that is actually running. 

 why would this happen? And how can I fix it?

node-startup is real simple and cool. I tried to use it for setting up an app on AWS EC2 instance. Initially I had a few failures from 
a) Needing to add "sudo" to all the commands including **"rm pid file", "mkdir", "chown", **etc. Why would this be required? ... this was required when I was running this from the bash shell directly to test out the script.
b) Even after setting this script up in /etc/init.d and setting up the** chkconfig --add node-startup**, I noticed that the app does not start up after a reboot automatically. What might be wrong?
c) One of the reason that at reboot the node-startup does not work is, the old pid file is still around. Hence the start command fails. How can i ensure that the node-startup app is shutdown or pid file is ignored only at the reboot and initial startup?

Thanks for your help. Again, this script is nice and simple!

restart from Admin Panel is not possible when app is running from "node-app" script

```
[meta.restart] Could not restart, are you sure NodeBB was started with `./nodebb start`?
```

Hi,

I was wondering if you could help me out but I'm using your script but the generate pid always seems to get 2 number below the real process id of the running node app.

i.e. the reported pid is 20195 but when I tried to do a ps -aux | grep node, i could see the pid is actually 20197.

Do you know what might be going wrong

I am running on a VPS, and have a 2nd IP address that all the Node stuff runs on on port 80, is it possible to add this option to the script? 

I.e. Host 209.122.xx.22
port 80

I follwed the instruction, now I can use service node-app to start | stop, But when I reboot the host, node-app will not running automatically, "update-rc.d node-app defaults"  is ok  .. OS: ubuntu 14.04,

<pre><code>root@HomeKitPi:~# /etc/init.d/node-app start
Node app stopped, but pid file exists</code></pre>


I looked at [issue #17](https://github.com/chovy/node-startup/issues/17), and I am using the latest version which includes the change to line 45, but for some reason it still doesn't work
