Our LCS is in "Self-service deployment architecture" and we cannot se the option to copy sandbox to production in the section Service Request..how can we copy sandbox (UAT) to production?
Could this document please be updated to reference that you have the option of using Terminal API or Cloud API. More information on this set-up was demo'd by Ruben at the Biz Apps summit last year - see video here from 22:30: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO1ycmc2P14&t=1429s 

Within the details of how to configure the connector properties it currently states:
Terminal architecture	This must be set to Local for POS terminals.
The above statement is not true, it can be Local or Cloud depending on which API architecture you choose.
The Cloud API key section states:
Cloud API Key	This field is used only for the card-not-present payment integration and should be left blank.
The above statement is also not true, Cloud API needs to be populated if using Cloud API architecture.

I look at "Use the Cloud-powered support tool." above and it says "On the Active issue tab, select your issue, and then click Submit to Microsoft.".
But "! Submit to Microsoft" is greyed out
The other option On the Submitted to Microsoft tab requires a premier support contract

Related to "Individual incidents and 5 packs purchased on [support.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness]." above
You cannot use Individual incidents and 5 packs because you are redirected to LCS at  1. Product selection when you select Dynamics \ Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operation
I guess you may select a different product eg Windows 10, then add contract  when you are at 3. Support plan. Then cancel out. Then go to LCS and perhaps you could see the contract because it has now been associated to your sign-in. As a workaround

Hi there,

what I am missing in the documentation is what parts of a package actually needs to be checked in. This is defined for 3rd party packages in the docs, but it is missing for source package (or I'm too blind to find it). For myself, it is quite clear what I need. Alongside with the .gitignore/.tfignore I have written, there is no problem for me personally. However, I find it would be good to have a description on what to check in within the docs explicitly, including exceptions like binary dependencies (3rd party .net DLLs in use by your package, for example).

Best regards,
Torben Nehmer

As subject, if we pin report from PowerBI.com, are the drill report still works ? Also is there any document provided specific to FO on how to develop the menu item and everything like mentioned in part :
1. Help secure access to Power BI reports by using menu items. 
2. Filter reports based on application context

I mean really specific for F&O, not the generic that can use by any platform.
Thanks,

Is the "application" referring to Finance and Operations website ?
After I go to "System administration" I do not see Setup - I do see:
Manage users
Security configuration
Lifecycle Services
Failed batch jobs
System settings
Data Management IT

Currently unable to 'Register your external application'

I suggest an info is added to the "What's new or changed" part that the update settings in the LCS project settings is not available. According to Microsoft support, automatic updates are not available with self service environments.

In the parameters C# sample section of ExportToPackage action it says:
"definitionGroupId":"&lt;Data project Id&gt;",
This is not correct. It should be:
"definitionGroupId":"&lt;Data project NAME&gt;",

In the parameters section it says:
string legalEntityId	- The legal entity for the data import.
this is not correct. It should be:
string legalEntityId	The legal entity for the data EXPORT.
