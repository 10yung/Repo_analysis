it would be great if I can translate view position using this library.
I had to use the [View animator](https://github.com/florent37/ViewAnimator) 
which doesn't have the setPercent feature
I'm using an animation similar to the AnimScrollActivity and ran into issue when I tested restoring my app from state loss.  

In developer settings I turned on "Don't keep activities" and then I opened the app and scrolled the activity all the way up which works as expected.  I then leave the app and return, and the animation is now like this

If I then scroll, it turns into this

I've tried things like adding this into the onCreate but it causes an animation at the start, and still doesn't fully place items in the correct spots, and if I take it out of the post, it's wrong right away.

```
 scrollview.post {
            scrollview.scrollTo(0, 0)
            animation.reset()
 }
```







@florent37 If two different animations are executed quickly at the same time, the original execution sequence may change, resulting in is not the expected effect, I want to add a stop animation should be able to solve this problem, but I did not find the stop the animation method, can you add a stop animation method? Or how should this situation be solved?
