Hi, 

Sorry for posting the irrelevant question in this repo. 
I am writing to ask if you are going to release the code and trained models for the recent ICCV19 paper titled "Unsupervised Learning for Real-World Super-Resolution" and if so what is the expected timeline. 

Thanks, 
Touqeer
Hi martin
In the model update step of C-COT project, why it adds only half of the new sample "xlf" into "samplesf"?
`xlf = cellfun(@(xf) xf(:,1:(size(xf,2)+1)/2,:), xlf, 'uniformoutput', false);`
Hi, martin!
In your CCOT project, dose the reg_filter in tracker.m filer denotes the matrix W<sub>d</sub>  in the equation (7) as below:

and another question is that why the size of W<sub>d</sub> in your paper is (2K<sub>d</sub>+2L+1)X(2K<sub>d</sub>+1), because in your code, the size of reg_filter is 3x7.

can your take a little time to explain it? 
Hi, @martin-danelljan, how to keep the standard inputsize(224*224) to the CNN model in your code? I find that there is a cnndefault mode, but it doesn't work. Thank you very much!
