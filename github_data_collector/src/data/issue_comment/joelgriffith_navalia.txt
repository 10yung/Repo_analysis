This project hasn't been updated in a while. Is it still being maintained? Trying to decide if we should use it for our next project. Thanks!
The graphql version referenced by navalia@1.3.0 and the jest version referenced by create-react-app@1.1.1 seem to be incompatible with one another.  Gives an error message:
```
 FAIL  src/react.spec.js
  ● Test suite failed to run

    /Users/sgreene/src/tutorials/test-navalia/node_modules/graphql/index.mjs:2
    export { graphql, graphqlSync } from './graphql';
    ^^^^^^
```
Steps to reproduce:

1. Install create-react-app@1.1.1 (current stable version as of this writing)
2. create-react-app test-navalia
3. Create the app Login-Page.js and the first test react.spec.js from the blog post https://codeburst.io/composable-end-to-end-tests-for-react-apps-2ec82170af62.
4. yarn test.

package.json looks like this:
```
{
  "name": "test-navalia",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^16.2.0",
    "react-scripts": "1.1.1"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "navalia": "^1.3.0"
  }
}
```


This example:

```
const { Chrome } = require('navalia');
const chrome = new Chrome();

chrome
  .goto('https://amazon.com')
  .type('input', 'Kindle')
  .click('.buy-now')
  .end()
  .then(responses => {
    console.log(responses); // ['https://www.amazon.com/', true, true, true]
  });

```

causes the following error:
```

(node:13803) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection (rejection id: 1): Goto failed to load in the timeout specified
(node:13803) [DEP0018] DeprecationWarning: Unhandled promise rejections are deprecated. In the future, promise rejections that are not handled will terminate the Node.js process with a non-zero exit code.
```

no way to work around it. Can't use navalia at all. Please help!
First, awesome project. I have seen notes about this project is or will be deprecated. I do hope rumors of its demise will be proven false. :)

The `Chrome` instance is easy enough to use however the `navalia` usage seems to have a problem. I haven't dug into code yet though.

This example fails:

```
process.env.DEBUG = "navalia";

import { Navalia } from "navalia";

const navalia: Navalia = new Navalia();

(async () => {
  await navalia.run(async chrome => chrome.goto("http://joelgriffith.net"));
})();
```

Output:

```

When trying to change the value of a dropdown using select chrome.select returns ReferenceError: option is not defined
```
async function test() {
    await chrome.goto('http://localhost:3000/pva');
    const x = await chrome.exists('#accountViewSelector') //true
    const y = await chrome.html('#accountViewSelector') //returns correct dropdown <select ..
    const z = await chrome.select('#accountViewSelector', '0'); // ReferenceError: option is not defined
    chrome.done();
}

test();
```

Sole component being rendered
```
const PortfolioValueAnalysis = () => {
    return (
        <select id='accountViewSelector' className="form-control">
            <option value='0'>0</option>
            <option value='1'>1</option>
            <option value='2'>2</option>
        </select>
    )
}

export default PortfolioValueAnalysis;

I have to set some local storage values to chrome and use auth0 or oauth2 authentication, is there a way to have auth support oauth2? or to set local storage values before doing chrome.goto(url)?
I'm learning navalia, and have a test that looks on the page for a certain element, like this:

`.then(() => chrome.exists('[#ns-leftdrawer-list-item--atlas]'))`

it succeeds, and my test then attempts to click on a child element, like this:

`chrome.click('[#ns-leftdrawer-list-item--atlas > a]')`

this fails, and the chatter from navalia says this:

> navalia:chrome :WARN > Retrying 1 time(s) due to issue: 'Error: [object Object]' +10ms

My question is: how do I get visibility into what the error actually is? Is there a way to dump/format the [object Object]?
After updating to Chrome Version 62.0.3202.62 tests started failing.

Hi, thanks for the great work.
I'm trying to test some elements that have a `onMouseDown` function bound to it with the Navalia `click` method, but the event is not triggered.

Don't know if the best option is to create a new Navalia method called `mouseDown` or make `click` work with `onClick`, `onMouseDown` and other types of events like touch.
For example, when entering text into a search I'd like to press enter afterwards. Sometimes there's no button to press to confirm a text entry.
