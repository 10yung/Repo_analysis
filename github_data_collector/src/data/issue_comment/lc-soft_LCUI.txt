We need a graphical interface to show the current render status to handle performance issues

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Refer the Chrome Browser:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1730073/71359502-92cf4c00-25c7-11ea-9be5-4993acbf4591.png)

Show the following performance information:

- Frame rate
- Parallel rendering threads
- Count of rendering
- Count of widgets updated

**Additional context**

- The FPS chart is hard to draw, you don't have to draw it.
- You can  implement a `fps-meter` widget to display information.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

- Add `LCUI_Settings settings` to src/main.c:MainApp.
- Add files: 
    - src/setttings.c
    - include/LCUI/settings.h
- Change related files to apply settings:
    - src/main.c
    - src/gui/widget_task.c
    - src/display.c
    - ...


Usage:

```c
LCUI_SettingsRec settings;

// Get global settings of the LCUI
Settings_Init(&settings);

// default settings:
// settings.paint_flashing = FALSE
// settings.Frame_rate_cap = 120
// settings.fps_meter = FALSE
// settings.record_profile = FALSE
// settings.parallel_rendering_threads = 4

// Set frame rate cap to 30
settings.frame_rate_cap = 30;

// Set parallel rendering threads to 8
settings.parallel_rendering_threads = 8;

// enable paint flashing
settings.paint_flashing = TRUE;

// start record performance profile
settings.record_profile = TRUE;

// show fps meter
settings.fps_meter = TRUE;

// apply this new settings, and trigger LCUI_SETTINGS_CHANGE event
LCUI_ApplySettings(&settings);

// Reset settings to default
LCUI_ResetSettings();

```

**Additional context**

**settings.frame_rate_cap:**

Call `StepTimer_SetFrameLimit(MainApp.settings.frame_rate_cap)` when LCUI_SETTINGS_CHANGE event trigger

https://github.com/lc-soft/LCUI/blob/949db382a94370ac8a6f29611d7f40c717f7587c/src/main.c#L474

**settings.paint_flashing:**

- Remove `display.show_rect_border`, `LCUIDisplay_ShowRectBorder()`, `LCUIDisplay_HideRectBorder()`.
- Add `LCUI_Settings settings` to the display struct, and replace `display.show_rect_border` with `display.settings->paint_flashing`

https://github.com/lc-soft/LCUI/blob/949db382a94370ac8a6f29611d7f40c717f7587c/src/display.c#L233


**settings.parallel_rendering_threads:**

- Use `display.settings->parallel_rendering_threads` instead of `PARALLEL_RENDERING_THREADS`
- The minimum value of `parallel_rendering_threads` is 1

https://github.com/lc-soft/LCUI/blob/949db382a94370ac8a6f29611d7f40c717f7587c/src/display.c#L132
**settings.record_profile:**

- Save profile data to `MainApp.profile`
- Add `LCUI_GetProfile()` to get performance profile

https://github.com/lc-soft/LCUI/blob/949db382a94370ac8a6f29611d7f40c717f7587c/src/main.c#L183

**settings.show_fps_meter:**

No related code needs to be modified

**Describe the bug**
Write a coveragerc file for Coveralls so that it doesn't collect the docs, markdown files and other files that don't affect the source code of the project.

**Expected behavior**
The coverage program should not cover docs, which gives a misleading coverage percentage. Coverage should only be about the source code that gets tests by the tests.

**Additional context**
This will overall give you a more precise coverage report and help in tracking what source code needs to be tested.
