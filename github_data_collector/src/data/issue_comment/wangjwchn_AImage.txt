Hi.

Right after play the animation, CPU usage gets high and even after stop the animation, CPU usage stays high!

Swift 4.1
iPhone 6 simulator.

I've tried AImage using Cocoapods and:

- The available version is 1.0.0 and not 2.0.0 yet
- LICENSE file is missing

Using :git => "https://github.com/wangjwchn/AImage.git" on Podfile results a empty installation.

Can you fix it?
Thanks!
I have a two-frame gif and only the first frame shows. With a three-frame gif only two frames animate back and forth. One frame is being dropped. I think it has something to do with the `displayIndex` array on `AImage`, but I can't understand the logic in the `calculateFrameDelay` function well enough to figure out exactly what is causing the issue.



swift4.0 版，播放完一次gif之后会像闪光灯一样闪烁1秒
@wangjwchn hey! I'm back 😎. So, I have a good news for us:
Testing on (iPhone 6s, 11.1, Xcode 9.1 (9B55))
Old implementation: https://puu.sh/ynWBq/affb71ab10.png
After small changes: https://puu.sh/ynWBT/8ecccbad27.png
Resource: https://wangjwchn.github.io/image/view.gif

@wangjwchn Could you test as you wish and review code ?

Refactor:
1. Change layer contects setting to image setting;
2. Remove decode image function;
3. Time fired function;
4. Add types to variables.

Hi, I'd like to inquire about the app's performance in general. I understand it slows down the view it's in, but it currently seems to be affecting the entire app (I have an iCarousel running in the main View). 
I have a single apng sitting in my SettingsViewController and display it in the footer view of the table. It's loaded with imageview.APlay();. Do I need to somehow use iamgeview.AStop(); in order for it not to affect the rest of the app? I understand this is a noob question, I'm just slightly confused by how slow the entire app has become all of a sudden. 

Thanks a bunch!
