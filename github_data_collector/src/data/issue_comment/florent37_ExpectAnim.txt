1.Added Bezier animation to better integrate with material design
2.Built-in interpolator interface
Whether to optimize these two points
I have an activity (which contains the code to enlarge / minimise the layout) with a fragment at the bottom. It works fine with normal views, but if I change the fragment to a google maps fragment, there it will minimise the layout, but won't enlarge the map view at the bottom to fill the remaining space

When I use `width()` with `centerInParent()` or any similar method, the new position does not take in account new width.

So instead of becoming center it is slightly misaligned because it still has old width.
Is this expected outcome or I am the only one getting it? 
ExpectAnim   listener  method add removal   may be more appropriate?
ExpectAnim Listener 或许加上对应的移除方法更合适
Like this :
```java
  public ExpectAnim removeEndListener(AnimationEndListener listener) {
        this.endListeners.remove(listener);
        return this;
    }

    public ExpectAnim removeStartListener(AnimationStartListener listener) {
        this.startListeners.remove(listener);
        return this;
    }
```
**outOfScreen** Invalid in **onCreate** method  ,

Run soon after the flash and then back to the previous interface，My phone is Samsung 6.0 system
can you add documentation for the project or at-least for the public methods? I have two layouts in a frame layout with both widths as match_parent. I want to animate top layout to bottom and I achieved it. I want the animated view to have margin 10dp in left and right with width as match_parent. I tried it but can't achieve it. Can you please help.
Add Expectations as "setEnabled(boolean enabled)"
```
 new ExpectAnim()
                .expect(mPlayerMediaView)
                .toBe(
                        Expectations.enable()
                )
                .expect(mPlayerMediaView)
                .toBe(
                        Expectations.disable()
                )
```
