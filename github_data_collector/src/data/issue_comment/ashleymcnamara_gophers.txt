Is there any chance to get the [docker gopher](https://github.com/ashleymcnamara/gophers/blob/master/DockerGopher.png) as vector image? 

Thank you!
Hello.

I made some glitched animations using your illustrations. I hope you like them. :robot: 
Hello Ashley,

Could you draw a skater gopher? I love Golang and i'm a skater, i think of doing a tatoo of a gopher on a skateboard. hehehe I loved your stickers. Congratulations on work.

Please? Also, everyone at Pendo loves your work!
I plan on using it with http://github.com/cheikhshift/cleo 


I’m building a chatbot and I’m really bad at coming up with artwork.
