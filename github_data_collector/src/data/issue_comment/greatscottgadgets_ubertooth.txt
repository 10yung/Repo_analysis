We recently purchased an Ubertooth One from Great Scott Gadgets, and have been experimenting with it.  We are considering designing our own hardware based off the CC2500 as the CC2400 is not recommended for new designs (for the past 10 years it seems).  You answered a question from Hunyue Yau on 5/11/2012 indicating the CC2500 does not support 1 Mbps symbol rate required for Bluetooth.  I see from the datasheets for both products that yes, the CC2500 max data rate is half of the CC2400.  Do you believe we could ever get an Ubertooth like sniffer based off the CC2500 to work?  Could you please elaborate on the main issue we might run up against concerning the data rate difference?
### Steps to reproduce
1.Capture PCAP packets using ubertooth-btle command
2.analyze PCAP packets through Wireshark
3.

### Expected behaviour
Tell us what you expect should happen

### Actual behaviour
Tell us what happens instead
Braodcast packet are shown correclty, but when data packet comes. i am getting a PPI malformed packet as shown in image

### Steps to reproduce
1. Download tools from build guide
2. navigate to firmware directory 
3. make any of the firmware

### Expected behaviour
firmware should build


### Actual behaviour

### Steps to reproduce
1. ubertooth-scan -s
2.ubertooth-btle -t RetrievedBluetoothMACAddress
3.ubertooth-btle -f -c /tmp/pipe &
4. wireskark -k -i /tmp/pipe &

### Expected behaviour
Should follow the messages from RetrievedBluetoothMACAddress and show them in Wireshark. 

### Actual behaviour
Wireshark opens but does nothing. It doesn't have any traffic. Either doesn't follow the connection, or nothing is being transmitted. I think the static RetrievedBluetoothMACAddress, retrieved from ubertooth-scan cannot be used to follow the packets in ubertooth-btle -f. How can I find the advertising Bluetooth MAC Address of the device? Does the RetrievedBluetoothMACAddress of my iPhone 8 change, as soon as I start using ubertooth-btle? If so, how can I find and track/follow the new iPhone 8 MAC Address?

### Version information

If you are reporting a problem that involves third party software

### Output
```Wireshark opens but does nothing. If I do ubertooth-btle -f, it works correctly but most Bluetooth MAC Addresses, shown in Wireshark under "Source" are different...
Insert any commandline or build output here
```

### Steps to reproduce
1. Build the 2018-12-R1 version for ARM
2. Install the tools an lib
3. Upload the new firmware with the -r argument

### Expected behaviour
When the DFU finish, the tool will detach from this mode and the dongle will reconnect to the system normally.

### Actual behaviour
The command always success to flash and detach but half the time the dongle is in an unknown state and don't reconnect to the system. The only way to be able to use it after is to unplug and plug it in. This isn't an accepted behaviour when we don't have direct access to the device to be unplugged or power cycled.

This is the LED state when that happen:
RSTLED = ON(green)
USBLED = ON(red)
1V8LED = ON(green)
TXLED = OFF
RXLED = OFF
USRLED = OFF

Dear sir,

[Problems]
Suppose that i have two ubertooth devices. The command parameter -U<0-7> shows that we should to set the index<0-7> of ubertooth device when using 'ubertooth-btle -U' command.  
But how do i know the index of the corresponding devices when using the command and how can I use two ubertooth devices to work simultaneously?

[Version information]
Linux - Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS

libubertooth 1.1 (2018-12-R1), libbtbb 1.0 (2018-06-R1)
Firmware version: 2018-12-R1 (API:1.06)

Many thanks and looking forward to hearing from you.
### Steps to reproduce
1. Run the command ubertooth-btle -s22:44:66:88:aa:cc
2. Check BLE scanner app for address (I use nrf BLE scanner app)

### Expected behaviour
Ubertooth should transmit fake advertisement packets with the advertising address 22:44:66:88:aa:cc, that are detected on the app

### Actual behaviour
Don't see any advertisements from that address. I see the TXLED is continuously blinking (feebly) which makes me believe it is hitting the le_transmit() function in the code. But no advertisements are detected in the app.
