`journo init` creates bootstrap/config.json and bootstrap/posts/ but not boostrap/layout.html

hi.
i use ur app to build a site: http://jn.luckypoem.net/ ,but how to change the display method?
i want all posts shown as:
test3
test2
test1
My First Post 

i don't like the current arrangement of posts:all of them are in the same line.i want each post occupies 
a seperate line.

When installed using `npm install -g journo` it results in the installation of something that's apparently the same version, but which uses  `"highlight": ">= 0.2.3"` instead of `"highlight.js": ">= 7.3.0"`

Can I ask that you take a moment to do `npm version minor`, and `npm publish` on this project?

This would create the `./public` folder to the `Journo.init` function. It makes starting a new blog a little easier.

Ehum...excuse my ignorance when it comes to Node.js.
I tried to install journo with the npm command as described.
Then trying 'journo init' which complains about a missing 'node',
so I modifiy the journo script to use 'nodejs' (I'm using Ubuntu 12.10),
but now I get:

$ journo init

/usr/local/lib/node_modules/journo/journo.js:175
    if (fs.existsSync('posts')) {
           ^
TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'existsSync'
    at Object.init (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/journo/journo.js:175:12)
    at Object.run (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/journo/journo.js:240:29)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/journo/bin/journo:7:26)

    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:39)

and I'm way out of my depth...

However, it works if Journo is installed by cloning the repo, compiling `journo.litcoffee` and running `npm install -g`. I may have overlooked something obvious here, but if not the version on NPM should be updated.

As a side note, if you try to clone and install without compiling `journo.litcoffee` in between, an error is thrown due to the syntax highlighting library not being installed. This seems to be the result of 16404f5a518fe84daada78e123d9bcf6fee4c08d, where `journo.js` was hand-edited, leaving it out-of-sync with the CoffeeScript version.
