Currently, invalidated cells are indicated by an `[X]`, but the invalid cell output stays unchanged. This is confusing to the user, ideally invalid cell output should be more obviously de-emphasized (eg, greyed-out / semi-transparent). Barring that, the invalid output should probably be cleared.
JupyterLab is the next-generation frontend for Jupyter, and has a more modern extension framework. This should be possible to achieve better frontend integration for Nodebook.

Amazing work, thanks for sharing!  I've been thinking about [something similar](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2016-June/040871.html), but nodebook is an interesting alternative (and it demonstrates how to invalidate cells in jupyter).

Here's one detail that could be perhaps improved.  Consider the following 4 cells:

```
a = 0

a += 1

a += 2

print(a)
```

Now proceed as following:

- Evaluate all cells.  The last one prints 3.
- Delete the second cell.
- Evaluate the last cell.  It still prints 3.

If instead of deleting the cell one comments-out its contents, the behavior is as expected: the last two cells are invalidated, and upon evaluation 2 is printed.  Would it be possible to do the same upon deletion?  I guess that it might be tricky because of Jupyter's undo functionality.

The license states that it should be packaged in all distributions of the package, but it is not packaged in the pypi releases.  I only realized this because I am in the process of [packaging nodebook for conda forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/4552).
