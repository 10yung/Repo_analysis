Hi,

Thanks for such a great lib! 

How to get real height of the content without filling and so on? 

Here is an example but it doesn't work properly with you lib. Do you have any idea? @gleue 
```
class MyCollectionView: UICollectionView {
    // MARK: - Layout
    override func layoutSubviews() {
        super.layoutSubviews()

        let height = contentSize.height
        guard
            height > 1 else {
                return
        }
// here the height
    }
}
```

P.s. I'd like to use two instances of the lib on a page.

Regards,
is it possible to assign individual topReveal values to stackedLayout for different cells with different height values?
Its just like the same in gif in readme file. The brown cell is expanding on selection. But im not able to achieve the same with example project. I just want the same as that example but the height of expanded should be less.
how i can use it with xib file
in this method 
    - (void)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView didSelectItemAtIndexPath:
    (NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
     if (self.exposedItemIndexPath && indexPath.item == self.exposedItemIndexPath.item) {
            self.exposedItemIndexPath = nil;
    }
    else {
    NSLog(@"Hello1");
            self.exposedItemIndexPath = indexPath;
            NSLog(@"Hello2");
    }

when i am assigning exposedItemIndexPath its taking almost 5 to 6 seconds to expand a cell.

Can you please help me to improve this ?
I love this stacked view controller that you build. I am interesting to make something similar to Wallet app and I want to add a title on the top.

Can you give me some pointers on how to do this ? 
I am thinking that the Wallet app title might be a Section Header ? If so I need to implement this in the StackLayout class (and ExposedLayout ? ). Also I need it to stop at the top while scrolling and all cells go above it. Not sure if this will work automatically or I need to make changes.

What do you thing ?

I've been looking for something like this but I dont know C,  is there anyone willing to convert this code to swift 3?  
Hi, 

I have added your great work TGLstackedView to my app  and it looks great ... but it has one strange issue ... I spend hours to fix it without hope...

1- When view appeared the position of  cards  is not correct based on giving information (is suppose to be 10 from top of collectionView) ....  - even if tried to push the cards to top it stacked at same location-

2- When I exposed any items it will shows at same wrong location ... same as above

3- but when I click on unexposed items ...    it will show all items but in CORRECT location ...  to (10)

and also it even can scroll to down and up !!



I have spend hours to check parameters  to control this behavior ...  and tried to test  example app .. but I could not  solve my issue because in example app when you click on unexposed items is not behaving any thing "No gesture"



Note: I am using 100% code  as i am not familiar with IB Story board


            let layout: TGLStackedLayout = TGLStackedLayout()            
            layout.itemSize = CGSize(width: view.bounds.width - 20, height: view.bounds.height-250)
            layout.layoutMargin = UIEdgeInsetsMake(10, 0, 0, 0);  //this is edge from collectionView "Gray Color"
            layout.topReveal = 50


  self.collectionView?.frame = CGRect(x:0, y:80, width: self.view.bounds.width, height: self.view.bounds.height-130) 
        self.exposedPinningMode = .all
        self.exposedItemSize = CGSize(width: view.bounds.width - 20, height: view.bounds.height-200)
        self.exposedLayoutMargin = UIEdgeInsetsMake(10, 0, 0, 0);
        self.exposedBottomOverlap = 25
        self.view.backgroundColor = .red
        


Thank you 
        

Whenever i am adding new items to stack view, entire view is refreshing. SO when i have card in expanded state and in background if any new items gets added. Entire cards are getting refreshed and back to default state.

Need help with this issue.
