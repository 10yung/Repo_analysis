I have to download images of size around 1 to 2 MB size. I have hundreds of images, i am using imageloader for that, its working fine for thumb images. but its a strange issue that if i set 25 thread poolsize, then after downloading 25 images, downloading speed reduced. Please help me.

any help resolving this?

I want to clear image in imageview. For example when an activity destroyed or when in recyclerview in OnRecycled method.

Glide has a clear method but I could't find the same for Universal Ä°mage Loader. How can I clear image view?
i am using universal imageloader i.e working fine till oreo but now it is faild to load image in Pie

it is updated 
    implementation 'com.nostra13.universalimageloader:universal-image-loader:1.9.5'
right

It looks like abandoned now. Is there any fork that is still maintained?
is it possible to svg file as image in android imageview using UIL ?
