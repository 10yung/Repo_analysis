This is so weird, when I'm editing in a ckeditor window, and I go to 'source', if I hit control-f to open a search box, and start typing text to search, the tab crashes. Can anyone else try and replicate this or help debug it? I'm not getting an error in the browser console, just a warning that the page has disconnected. I've never really seen anything like this...
Because of some very specific handling of images in my system, I need CKEditor when clicking on image and browsing the server to use my own controller to handle our custom logic.
setting a config.parent_controller in initializer didn't work.
please advice
after resizing ck_editor, content of text area disappeared  and text area not working
trying to get emoji plugin working, which requires autocomplete plugin, which requires textwatcher, all three of these plugins seem to want a function called CKEDITOR.tools.throttle.

I guess it's... not anywhere in this repo? That seems odd. The emojis are not flowing :/

 at new TextWatcher (plugin.js?t=FB9E:157)

There is a section in README:

> #### Install additional plugins
> You should download necessary plugins with all dependencies and extract them in `app/assets/javascripts/ckeditor/plugins/`.
> After that you can include your plugins in `app/assets/javascripts/ckeditor/config.js` in this way:
> ```javascript
> CKEDITOR.editorConfig = function (config) {
>   config.extraPlugins = 'eqneditor,autosave,';
> }
> ```

But in case of v5.0.0 (where CDN scripts are used) there is no (at least visible for me) possibility to add additional plugins manually.

For example, I want [codemirror addon](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/codemirror). And because of inconsistency of versions, there is no matching codemirror script in CDN for ckeditor v4.11.x. So, how can I use it (and other similar addons) in v5.0.0 gem?
> This change breaks the view. @attachments is not an AR model or enumerable class and as such causes an empty file list to be rendered. It is a paginator, which is why the .scoped method worked, as it returns an AR model. Please correct. ../pictures/index.html.erb is still correct and functioning.

This is a duplicate of Bug #680 which was closed by the author, but the Bug is real and still in the current stable release.

The Column Name type (not sure if *_type as well) is reserved for polymorphic associations, thats why Rails is complaining (sometimes). Maybe the bug only appears when you actually use polymorphic associations on other models.

Please rename at least the following column: "type"
And it would probably better to rename "data_content_type" unless it is used for a polymorphic associations, which I could not test, because it crashes before any data can be saved in that column.
