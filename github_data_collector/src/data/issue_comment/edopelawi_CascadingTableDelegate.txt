Carthage can't find the built framework.
Hi,

I must confess, I'm not totally convinced that the problem you are aiming to solve, is a problem in the first place. Surely, if your tableView model is large, then you should just refactor it to make it manageable again?

Still, this is an interesting idea and I want to take a deeper look at what you guys are doing and maybe provide some feedback, if you're interested?

I noticed the frame rate dropping on the simulator (iPhone X) and I am curious about that. I'll get back to you if I find anything interesting.

I have noticed an issue with memory. If you look here, you can see that not all the memory is deallocated when popping the `DestinationViewController`.

If you pause execution on the root controller, after popping the `DestinationViewController`, you can see a bunch of stuff is still in memory.

I'll keep looking around to see why the frame rate drops the first time the `DestinationViewController` loads.
I've read through the code, I don't understand how to use this in my project. Can you provide a step by step "how to use" section in the readme?
