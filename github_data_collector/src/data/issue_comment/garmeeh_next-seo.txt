What do you think about moving the e2e test to typescript?
I can take a look and send a PR.
In this PR https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo/pull/142 the documentation for JobPosting was added in the middle of faq page.
This will bring the faq page documentation together again.
Fixes: #136

## Description of Change(s):
Accepts optional key for JSON-LD elements, but still prefixes the key with the default values.

---

Some things to help get a PR reviewed and merged faster:

- Have you updated the documentation to go with your changes? YES
- Have you written or updated unit tests? NO EXISTING TESTS
- Have you written an integration test in the test app supplied? NO EXISTING TESTS

The title says it all. The JSON-LD spec allows for multiple instances, essential for blog rolls or search pages. `key` seems like the most canonical way to handle this behavior, perhaps retaining the default key as a prefix. What do you think?
I want to indicate multiple offers in different currencies for the same product. 

I would expect to use an array of @offer objects to indicate different offers.

At the moment it seems it does not work this way.

```javascript
"offers": 
[
  {
    "@type": "Offer"
  },
  {
    "@type": "Offer"
  }
]
I see some fields are not supported by the lib.

Is it possible to add custom LD data objects, that will not be validated by the lib?
Hi,

I try to implement the alternate language tag but I end up having the head node without the alternate attribute, also the facebookAppId is not set. 

However the title and description tags are set, so the default config is basically working.

Is there anything I do not understand or there an issue with the lib ?

Default config.js
```javascript
export default {
  title,
  description,
  facebook: {
    appId: process.env.FACEBOOK_APP_ID || '',
  },
  languageAlternate: {
    hrefLang: 'de',
    href: 'https://example.com/de/',
  },
};

```


_app.js
```
<>
        <DefaultSeo {...SEO} />
        <Provider store={store}>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
          <ToastContainer />
        </Provider>
      </>
```
I'm trying to implement the basic example inside an app that already use `_app.js` and `_document.js`

This is my `test.js` page:

```
import React from 'react';
import { NextSeo } from 'next-seo';

export default () => (
  <>
    <NextSeo
      title="Simple Usage Example"
      description="A short description goes here."
    />
    <p>Simple Usage</p>
  </>
);
```

I can see it working only client-side, if I view page source the title and description are not set.
If I remove `_app.js` and `_document.js` I can see the title and description correctly in the page source.

What am I missing?

Thanks!

Not sure if Google supports it.   I also tried rendering straight in the Head Component as a script before using next-seo.
