I have 5 python scripts and right now I run first script then after it finishes then I run 2 script and son on. Can anyone tell me how to add all these script so that If I run first script it should call the 2 script once the first one is done and then call the third script when second script is done. I am still learning working with Python. Any help is appreciated. Attached are two scripts for the reference.

Script2.py
Script3.py

I been on reddit for some time and here reading articles and progress. This section has been miss used quite a bit. This is meant for issues with the program and not so much talking. A while back i purchased a domain. Over the past week i have been working to improve it. I added a forum.  Would the staff want to make their own thread or section so people can talk and not open up issues when its just general chat?

Anyways if interested everything is fresh. http://pokemongohelp.net 

Let me know if its something you guys would be interested in.

Cheers!

2016-07-23 00:06:29.259 locationchange[12485:140905] Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.
    Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. 
    Try this: 
        (1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; 
        (2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. 
(
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x13f52c6e0 V:|-(20)-[UIInputSetContainerView:0x13f60e7e0]   (Names: '|':UITextEffectsWindow:0x13f525cc0 )>",

Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint

Make a symbolic breakpoint at UIViewAlertForUnsatisfiableConstraints to catch this in the debugger.
The methods in the UIConstraintBasedLayoutDebugging category on UIView listed in <UIKit/UIView.h> may also be helpful.
Message from debugger: Terminated due to memory issue

Any help plz.

Whole thing in the title ;)



The following will tell xCode to update the location without hijacking the mouse: 

```
repeat while true

    tell application "System Events" to tell process "Xcode"
        click menu item "pokemonLocation" of menu 1 of menu item "Simulate Location" of menu 1 of menu bar item "Debug" of menu bar 1

    end tell

end repeat
```

Just open with script editor and run :)
