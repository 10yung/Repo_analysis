This PR adds the interpolation algorithm. 
This PR is add the Jump Search algorithm. 

Hey @mgechev,
I noticed that you have a README.md file in src/sorting, which has the Big O complexity for all algorithms. It also has the "When to use" column, which is blank. Basecs already has many algorithms' explanations, and can be used to fill in this.column. The explanations are valid for most languages and are concise. 

Also, a README.md for all src/* folders would be helpful. (I would like to work on this)
Lomuto's and Hoare's partitioning functions could be reused across different algorithms.

It'll be a good idea to put them in separate files.
