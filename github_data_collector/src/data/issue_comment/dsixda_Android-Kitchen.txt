Updated SuperSU, busybox, and the wifi tether app, added a change log, and removed old files

Instead of asking the user to change directory, let the script do it by itself.

`$0` expands to the filename of the script, then `dirname` extracts its
containing directory. `cd` changes the _current directory_ to it. Then,
everything else works as before.

The original split_updata.pl seems to be too old, which will not
recognize image names for recent UPDATE.APP .

Usage:

```
  split_updata.py -l UPDATE.APP  # list images in UPDATE.APP
  split_updata.py -u UPDATE.APP  # unpack images to output/
```

Hope python won't bring too many dependencies for Kitchen.
