Fix for #239.
**Package**
This issue is related to the following monorepo package(s):
- [ ] eyeglass 
- [ ] broccoli-eyeglass
- [x] ember-cli-eyeglass

**Description**
When multiple versions of ember-cli-eyeglass are in the node_modules tree (especially common when using `yarn link`) there's not a single version of the singleton weak maps that are used to get the assets installed into the main application. This causes there to be missing data and results in an exception.

**Expected behavior**
The different instances of ember-cli-eyeglass should coordinate correctly and use the same shared data.

**Description**

There's a weird issue in a LinkedIn project where a file that isn't installed gets installed anyway.

```js
let ignoredExtensions = new Set(['js', 'css']);
eyeglass.assets.installer(function myInstaller( 
  assetFile, 
  assetUri, 
  oldInstaller, 
  cb 
) { 
  const assetExtension = assetUri.split('.').pop(); 
  if ( 
    ignoredExtensions.has(assetExtension) 
  ) { 
    cb(null, assetFile); 
  } else { 
    oldInstaller(assetFile, assetUri, cb); 
  } 
}); 
```

Returning `null` should cause the asset to not be installed, but they are seeing that it is found after restarting the server.


Let’s get started with automated dependency management for eyeglass :muscle:

🔒 Greenkeeper has found a `yarn.lock` file in this repository. Greenkeeper supports lockfile updates for public packages. If you use private packages in your repository, please use [greenkeeper-lockfile](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile) to make sure these can get updated as well.

This pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point for keeping up with new releases. Greenkeeper will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, but only after **you merge this pull request**.

**Important: Greenkeeper will only start watching this repository’s dependency updates after you merge this initial pull request**.



📦 📦  Greenkeeper has detected multiple `package.json` files. They have all been added to a new `greenkeeper.json` config file. They’ve been collected in a group called `default`, meaning that all of them will receive updates together. You can rename, add and remove groups and freely assign each `package.json` to whichever group you like. It’s common, for example, to have one `frontend` group and one `backend` group, each with a couple of `package.json` files. In any case, all files in a group will have their updates collected into single PRs and issues.

<summary>💥 Tests on this branch are failing. Here’s how to proceed.</summary>

To solve the issue, first find out which of the dependency’s updates is causing the problem. Then fix your code to accomodate the changes in the updated dependency. [next-update](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-update) is a really handy tool to help you with this.

Then push your changes to this branch and merge it.

<summary>🏗 How to configure Travis CI</summary>

Greenkeeper has added a rule to your `.travis.yml` that whitelists Greenkeeper branches, which are created when your dependencies are updated. Travis CI will run your tests on these branches automatically to see if they still pass.

No additional setup is required 😊

<summary>🙈 How to ignore certain dependencies</summary>

You may have good reasons for not wanting to update to a certain dependency right now. In this case, you can [change the dependency’s version string in the `package.json` file back to whatever you prefer](https://github.com/linkedin/eyeglass/edit/greenkeeper/initial/package.json).

To make sure Greenkeeper doesn’t nag you again on the next update, add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don’t want to update.

```js
// package.json
{
  …
  "greenkeeper": {
    "ignore": [
      "package-names",
      "you-want-me-to-ignore"
    ]
  }
}
```

  git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'
  git push https://github.com/linkedin/eyeglass.git greenkeeper/initial

<summary>✨ How do dependency updates work with Greenkeeper?</summary>

After you merge this pull request, **Greenkeeper will create a new branch whenever a  dependency is updated**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services and check whether your code still works with the new dependency version. Depending on the the results of these tests Greenkeeper will try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.

```diff
-  "underscore": "^1.6.0"
+  "underscore": "^1.7.0"
```

The above example shows an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).
When the test services report success Greenkeeper will silently delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.

However, should the tests fail, Greenkeeper will create an issue to inform you about the problem immediately.

This way, you’ll never be surprised by a dependency breaking your code. As long as everything still works, Greenkeeper will stay out of your way, and as soon as something goes wrong, you’ll be the first to know.

```diff
-  "lodash": "^3.0.0"
+  "lodash": "^4.0.0"
```

In this example, the new version `4.0.0` is _not_ included in the old `^3.0.0` range.
For version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request.

This means that **you no longer need to check for new versions manually** – Greenkeeper will keep you up to date automatically.

These pull requests not only serve as reminders to update: If you have solid tests and good coverage, and the pull requests passes those tests, you can very likely just merge it and release a new version of your software straight away :shipit:

To get a better idea of which ranges apply to which releases, check out the extremely useful [semver calculator](https://semver.npmjs.com/) provided by npm.

The Eyeglass API is currently optimized for wrapping a call to sass by transforming the options for a single compile. Often there are many files to compile that share the same compilation options and the work to discover eyeglass modules can be shared across those compiles.

In Eyeglass 3.0 we should expose a new class that optimizes for compiling many stylesheets and sharing the work of module discovery and resolution. The goal would be that this instance can be long lived and used to compile multiple versions of the same files over time.

**Description**

Currently `discover: true` is opt-in, but I suspect our goal was for this to be the default.
I could like to recommend we flip the default to be `true` and do a major version bump.
