Here is my first attempt at setting up a new .Net Core WPF Class Library Project and a .Net Core WPF test application. (related to issue #254) 

Please give it a try and see if it works as you want it to. 

Here are some details.

AutoUpdater.NET.Core.WPF - this projects implements the AutoUpdater.NETStandard just as the AutoUpdater.NET.WPF project did

 - Added Microsoft.Windows.Compatibility as a Nuget dependency
 - Added Microsoft.Toolkit.Wpf.UI.Controls.WebView as a Nuget dependency
 
AutoUpdaterTest.NET.Core.WPF - This is the test project similar to AutoUpdaterTestWPF that will use the  AutoUpdater.NET.Core.WPF to update. 
Use self-created window for downloading and installing progress.
Hi,

It would be possible to set the operation timeout, now timeout it's the default timeout of FtpWebRequest 1:40 min.

Thanks!!

Hi guys,

our team would like to customize a little UI:
- Left top corner icon
- Left icon near progress
- Font for speed and downloaded MBs labels
- Background of form
- Background of progress bar

Maybe I will do this in separate branch, just wanted to know, that my request will be reviewed relatively soon.

Many thanks.
This might be a feature request, depending on if it's intended or not.

I would like to set some of the installer arguments in code. One example would be querying the registry to check if the program is installed in a per-user context and appending MSIINSTALLPERUSER=1 to installer args.

I've tried doing this by creating a callback `AutoUpdaterOnCheckForUpdateEvent(args)` and adding what I want with args.InstallerArgs += "foo", but whatever I add seems to be ignored. Is this intended, as AutoUpdater.NET only reads args from the retrieved XML file, or am I doing this wrong?
delete files by XML list

Title pretty much explains the problem. The only thing I do is run:
```
AutoUpdater.ReportErrors = true;
AutoUpdater.Start("https://.../update.xml");
```
I confirmed that the endpoint is reachable, ssl certificates are fine, by opening the link. Still the software thinks that it cannot reach this destination. By saying: "There is a problem reaching update server. Please check your internet connection and try again later.". I check the code but couldn't find a clear reason why this message is shown.

The xml contains:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<item>
    <version>1.0.0.4</version>
    <url>https://.../installer.msi</url>
    <changelog>https://.../changelog.html</changelog>
    <mandatory>false</mandatory>
</item>
```
If the updater is located in:

C:\abc\abc\ when the updater extracts the contents it extracts to the location C:\abc\abc\

However, if I want the contents to be extracted to C:\abc\ how do I do that?

Thank you.
