Sorry, any idea how to fix this? Need a full log?
There is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected.
* Added 2 devices and strings for brands
** Sony Xperia ZXs (G8232)
** TCL Alcatel Idol 4 (6055x)
* Added discrepant (Google Glass) device in x64 section to x86 section of INF
* Fixed text formatting to make it more readable
** Alphabetized everything
** Categorized by brand
** Moved out of place devices under their correct brand.
From http://adb.clockworkmod.com it downloads .msi.exe instead .msi.
