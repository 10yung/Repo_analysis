Ticket 5607: https://trac.cppcheck.net/ticket/5607

Now it is possible to ignore paths with glob:
`cppcheck -i*autogen\*`

Glob pattern matching already been implemented in the Suppression class as a static method. I moved implementation to Utils.
The rename to bughuntingReport was incomplete. Found while investigating the failures with https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck/pull/2496
This patch fixes the detection of designated initializers in ``Tokenizer::findGarbageCode``.
While at it, I see a lot of seemingly unused CSS.

I also want to switch to classes for styling.

So, are `#menu`, or `#content` used?
Basic clang-tidy support for *.cppcheck project files. Should behave the same like in the gui. Tests are missing at the moment.
Added a fix to place a header row in the CSV report.  The report rows also contain the Id column making it useful for sorting and finding various types of errors (for example sorting on misra types of errors).
This removes the fixed position setting for the menu on the left. Thus
it scrolls up and down like the rest of the page. The disadvantage is
that the menu is not available everywhere on the page, but IMHO it is
more important to have a working page where nothing overlaps or is
unreachable.

Test for undefined behavior when shifting right is bigger than the type size.

- This is the first commit to get feedback. The test cases are not covering all types.

The for loop iteration expression was processed following the flow of
token as well as during the looping.
It should not be processed with the flow of token, but only during the
looping.

This commit adds the facility to parse `for (InitStatement; Condition; IterationExpression)`
and skip the iteration expression.

This fixes false positives, for instance, in the added test, we used to
have the following warning:
```
test.cpp:4:style:Redundant initialization for 'i'. The initialized value is overwritten before it is read.\n
test.cpp:3:note:i is initialized\n
test.cpp:4:note:i is overwritten\n
```
