One of the most useful shortcuts vrome gives me is the ability to hit "G" to instantly go to the bottom of the page.  This is _especially_ useful on long JIRA tickets.  

However, on atlassian.net, using the "G" will result in the following error in the console:
```

TypeError: event.initWebKitWheelEvent is not a function

```

Any clues?  This only seems to happen in JIRA cloud.
When using hint mode with useletters=0, vrome display number like vimperator.

Vrome is following the link only if the number is typed from the numeric pad. If not, the number go in the hint textbox

Is there a way to use those number for following the link. 
[Vimperator](https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs) (the leading Vim plugin for Firefox) is undergoing an end-of-life transition as the Firefox based XUL-type add on support is ending in that browser. 

There's a discussion at [Vimperator](https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/issues/705) about porting to the WebExtension API. Since "To a large extent the system is compatible with the extension API supported by Google Chrome and Opera." - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions it would seem desirable to unify the existing vim-like addon community into a project using this shared architecture. 

It also may be the case that Chrome inevitably forces its own add ons to conform to the WebExtension API. 

Regardless, I'm creating this issue to bring attention to the previously mentioned effort. Feel free to join the discussion [here](https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/issues/705).
Sadly, vrome is in conflict with Jupyter Notebook, so keyboard shortcuts for Jupyter don't work when using vrome.
Google inbox is non-functional for creating messages. With this extension enabled it is impossible to enter  a body or subject for a message being composed.

Adding inbox.google.com to the `disablesites` variable does set pass through mode for the domain, but does not resolve this issue.

I'm trying to use this software with an ABNT2 keyboard layout.

The software does not take my keyboard layout into account, just the plain EN-US layout.

It looks like this issue is a general case of:

Best regards,

every scroll operation cannot work while browser my gmail mails. Is there a bug?

Movement commands ( j, k, etc) don't work on most of the site.

etc
The commands work on main page only.

First I should thank you for this great extension, I can't imagine using Chrome without it. I wanted to know if it's possible to use this great extension on safari too? I know there are alternatives for Safari but none are as complete and intuitive as your extension so considering that both Chrome and Safari are based on webkit I thought maybe there's some way to enable it in Safari too, is it?

I use google docs alot for school, and I want to disable docs.google.com/.+/d/

It's not a huge deal, but I don't feel like it would be difficult at all.
