GBA's speed is 59.7275Hz.
I recorded EXE4 Title music on VBA-M and mGBA (It could adjust speed to 59.7275), and cut blank, 2nd loop off. Let's see the result:
VBA-M: 1273021
mGBA: 1274471
Then calculate: 59.7275 / (1273021 / 1274471) â‰ˆ 59.7955

So can you adjust speed to make more accurate to an actual GBA?

Here's music sample:

One more request...
Could you add **record WAV** feature?
Channel 4: Noise's volume is too low...
### Expected behavior
Being able to save while still doing things like running or jumping.

### Actual behavior
When holding a button for a continuous action (like running), pressing the save state hotkeys causes game to stop receiving the input until you stop holding the button and press it again. I can confirm this is not a problem with my keyboard and that it didn't happen on previous versions of vba.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior
Boot up a game and try to run or any other action that requires continuous holding of a button, then try to save state.

### ROM Details
Bug has been tested on both Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury and Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, though it presumably affects other games as well.

### Build details
Using VBA 2.1.4 for windows.
I changed the value to 131072 in FlashSize from vbam.ini. But when I opened VisualBoyAdvance-M, the message stated that the value, 131072, is invalid.

## A few errors and QoL qualms with the Memory Viewer.

Windows 10 x64
VisualBoyAdvance-M 2.1.4

Cannot type in 1-6 in the memory viewer due to window scaling sharing the same hotkey. Changing the hotkey, both removing the hotkey and replacing the hotkey, do nothing to return usability. Using a 10keyless and using the memory editor is a pain, as an external numpad or a numpad emu is necessary.

Unable to scroll with the scroll wheel in the memory viewer.

Typing in values into address space is buggy. Entering one value in one location can cause one value in another to change as well. 

### By just entering 9s:

0000
9000
9900
9990
9989
9989 0000
9809 9000

### By entering As:

0000
A000
AA00
AAA0
AA8A
AA8A 0000
A80A A000

### Overwriting a value:

0000
8000
_000 - Any value that isn't the existing value
F000

### Using DCDC:

D000
DC00
DCD0
DC8C
DC08 D000

### Using BADE:

B000
BA00
BAD0
BA8E
BA8E 0000
B80A B000
B80A BADE

Little-endian isn't an error per se but is odd and may be unfamiliar to some users.

0000 ..
0074 t.
7474 tt

00000000 ....
00000074 t...
00007474 tt..
00747474 ttt.
74747474 tttt

The right-side editor is otherwise unaffected.

I'd love to use VBA-M, but my main motivation for using this emulator is in its memory editor and all of the capabilities it has, using it in glitch hunting and everything that comes with it (which you probably could've guessed by how much I tinkered with this). In this state it's pretty unusable. Hopefully this can be fixed in the future. I'm not sure if anyone still uses the memory viewer, but I'm throwing my hat in the ring just in case.
### Please fill out this form:

### Expected behavior
At memory address 0x300553C, the correct date and time should be showing in this format:
`Year(2 Bytes) 00 Month(1 Byte) Day(1 Byte) DayOftheWeek(1 Byte) Hour(1 Byte) Minute(1 Byte) Seconds(1 Byte)` once the rom is loaded. 

00 is December's number in this implementation.

This should be detected by default if RTC has been enabled via Options > Game Boy Advance > Real-time Clock as is done in SVN 1292 (which is WxWidgets) available here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/vbam/files/Win32-Wx/

It is also important to note that the MFC version 2.0.0 Beta 2 available here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/vbam/files/Win32%20-%20MFC/ also has the correct behaviour.

### Actual behavior
Only `D0 07` displays in this implementation when RTC is not detected properly. This behaviour is present starting with the WxWidgets 2.0.0 Beta 1 available here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/vbam/files/Win32-Wx/

### Steps to reproduce the behavior
1. Patch Pokemon FireRed US v1.0  with this to add RTC capability:
[rtc.zip](https://github.com/visualboyadvance-m/visualboyadvance-m/files/3976400/rtc.zip)

2. Load the patched rom and observe 0x300553C in the Memory Viewer and see `D0 07` (in 8-bit view).

To "fix" to enable RTC detection correctly (instructions adapted from here: https://github.com/visualboyadvance-m/visualboyadvance-m/issues/211#issuecomment-403499893)

3. After loading rom, go to Options > Game Boy Advance > Configure > Game Overrides tab

4. Set Save Type to Flash and click OK

5. File > Close

6. Reload rom and check 0x300553C in the Memory Viewer; it should be detected properly now

This leads me to conclude that the detection for FireRed custom RTC implementations is only properly working when Save Type is set to Flash. There is another implementation that behaves exactly like this, but the default bytes when not properly detected are different from the ones in step 2.
