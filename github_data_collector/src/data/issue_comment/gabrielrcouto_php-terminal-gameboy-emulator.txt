Sticking Timing Vars in Timing Trait. If you think this is a good idea, I can obviously continue this and repeat this for the first (approx) 300 lines of variables that are set at the top of the Core class.

The Config DIR in my mind is a little easier to navigate, and should make things easier to find.

How about branch/seperated repo with zephir version? What is zephir you may ask - language to write extensions for php in simple way without knowing C https://github.com/phalcon/zephir
to many indentations

We can increase the FPS searching for performance bottlenecks.

After a research, I disabled the "scanLine" function, and the CPU emulation performance increased 2x. On other words: Let's improve what "scanLine" does.

The phar file is the repository itself. Including it in the master branch is the same as including a duplicate of all the code, which is probably out of date. If you're installing the code via composer, the phar is useless as you would just execute the bin file directly, and ignore the phar.

@reisraff suggested me a way to change the key mapping. 

It will be nice to have some .ini file, were we can put the configs.

What is the best way to store the file? 
- Stored on a default folder (like ~/.config)
- Stored on any place and passed via argument (--config config.ini)

Simply put, don't convert every time, one-time or over multiple iterations build an array, or object you can use to lookup values, it's going to be so much easier than computing anything to simply serialize the results somewhere, even if it's done at runtime costing RAM (assuming the GBA has 65536 colours or something insane like that).
