Excellent notebook. can you please add one for regression, clustering, anomaly and pca? Thanks
could you add some example of tensorflow optimize to improve performance? thank you very much.
could you add ensemble of all ml algorithms you trained as an example? I want to learn how to do it from you, thanks!
