Material design for bootstrap should be placed here, as a topic, due to the fact that it is a definition of tool that is already recognizable all over the world, it creates an effective combination that is trendy in the web (even NASA uses it). This is also the term for valuable software that helps in the development of projects and saves the valuable time of developers and designers.

The Issues tab/view of repos on topics makes exploring new projects difficult. 

I like to browse topics to *discover* new projects and topics. The Issues tab/view obscures relevant top-level information about a project, instead showing a preview of a single issue on the repo. The issues view does not give me any information of interest.

Please see the screenshot from the github.com/topics/robotics page for reference:

![Robotics topics](http://i.imgur.com/G5BF7hL.png "Issues view")


## Code view :relaxed:
Repos that are on the original "Code" tab provide all the info necessary to grok the project's contents and purpose. For example, from the **description** of "AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics", I can assume it is a repository containing "python sample codes for robotics algorithms, from the **topics** that "python" "robotics" and "algorithm" are key parts of the repo, and from the **language** indicator that it is mostly in notebooks.

## Issues view :persevere: 
"hybridgroup/gobot" is unfortunately in Issues view, and it is not clear to me, as the user, what the project is about, why it is featured in 'robotics' topics, or why I should be concerned with the featured Issue. 

I don't know anything about "gobot," so why should I be concerned with one user's need to use the gobot framework to leverage "MQTTbot events" to control the "TelloBot Driver"?

I would rather know **what** gobot is about.

# How to disable "Issues"?
I would like to **only** see the "code" view (how topics used to be), and not see Issues or any other tab. 

How can I display topics in this manner?
Give us full explanation
