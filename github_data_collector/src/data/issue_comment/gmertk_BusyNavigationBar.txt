When PullToRefresh is activated the Bars get drawn at the exact Position.
But shortly after that the Navigationbar shrinks back to its minimum Size (when pulled too far).
The Already started BusyNavigationBars do not shrink / move up. Instead they just stay there.
Any way to get around that behavior? (Any way to wait till the navigationbar is shrinked again and then display the busybars ? idk)

CodeBlock:

`self.navigationController?.navigationBar.start(options)
UIApplication.shared.isNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible = true
Utils.reloadAdminData(completion: { (result) in
DispatchQueue.main.async {
    self.data = result
    self.tableView.reloadData()
    UIApplication.shared.isNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible = false
    self.navigationController?.navigationBar.stop()
    self.refreshControl.endRefreshing()
}
})

I cann't import the BusyNavigationBar in my swift viewController after installing it with cocoapods?
Do i need to implement it using source code?
Please help
I Play video from URL, and its buffers so I want to show that stripes in particular view during buffering, so can you help me how to use it?


Hi!ðŸ˜Š I installed using cocoapods successfully but the compiler still tell me "navigationBar has no property...."

I also checked **Link Binary With Libraries** ,the framework was added.

Here is my Podfile, anything wrong? Thanks in advance

> source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
> platform :ios, '8.0'
> use_frameworks!
> 
> pod 'Kingfisher', '~> 2.2'
> pod "BusyNavigationBar"

really awesome project, but how to integrate with objective-c project?
