I tried to update ERP because i was getting several server errors that it  made the erp unusable. I read on another thread that updating bench and erp would fix this,  but i had made a few custom doctypes so the update cancelled because of a merge error. I was able to do a git patch -- rebase and change to version 11 but it was still stuck on Updating even after several bench restarts
Spelling of greater is corrected in throw message of stock entry.

## Description of the issue
While creating Sales Order, if we will provide **Delivery Date** prior to the date of Sales Order creating date, it'll raise a warning alert, "Expected Delivery Date should be after Sales Order Date". Obviously, there is nothing wrong.

**Actual Issue:**
Now, after closing warning pop-up, changing **Delivery Date** to post creating date. It'll again alert with the same warning and will revert date which was earlier. While, new date should be updated and document should have saved, but it is still in draft. No console errors found.

## Context information (for bug reports)

**Output of `bench version`**
```
ERPNext: v11.1.72 (version-11)
Frappe Framework: v11.1.64 (version-11)
```

## Steps to reproduce the issue

1. Create Sales Order, select Customer, and Date (let's assume today is 17th January, 2020) and mention **Delivery Date** before the date of 17th January, 2020. Let's say, you have entered 14th January, 2020. And, filled all the mandatory fields, like Items in item table & all.
2. On saving this Sales Order, warning pop-up will appear with message, _"Expected Delivery Date should be after Sales Order Date"_ . This is expected, nothing wrong.
3. While correcting this validation, by updating **Delivery Date** to the same date or post date, let's say 20th January, 2020. But, that validation will appear again, and document will not be saved.
4. Strange is, it get saved sometimes and sometimes not, even with back delivery date for which waning had alerted.

### Expected result
Document should have saved after correcting the date. Hence, it shouldn't revert to previous mentioned date after saving document.

### Stacktrace / full error message

```
No traces in console, just warning pop-up.
Warning : Expected Delivery Date should be after Sales Order Date

## Description of the issue
This is related to the fix: incorrect number of GL Entries error in stock entry #20298.  
After I updated to version v12.4.0 I started getting message "Incorrect number of GL Entries" when I try to submit a stock entry of type Manufacture to finish a work order. It looks like the reason for the error is that work order does not load correctly to the stock entry.

## Steps to reproduce the issue

1. Create stock item A and stock item B
2. Create a BOM for item A and put item B in the BOM
3. Create a material reconciliation to add 1 item B to stock and set price of item B to $1
4. Create a work order to manufacture item A, skip material transfer to WIP warehouse
5. In the work order click on finish, this will create a stock entry of type Manufacture
6. In the stock entry click on save and submit

### Observed result

### Expected result

Supplier Quotation DocType does not have a field to enter the Supplier Quotation # or ID with its corresponding date.

I am proposing the following fields be added to core:

Label | Type | Name | Options

- [ ] Supplier Quotation Details | Section Break | supplier_quotation_details | None

- [ ] Supplier Quotation ID | Data | supplier_quotation_id | None

- [ ] None | Column Break | column_break_xx | None

- [ ] Supplier Quotation Date | Date | supplier_quotation_date | None

Despite internal tracking series and number (ID) configured within ERPNext, suppliers have their own supplier quotation numbers or identification serials.  Adding it to the title of the quotation is not practical, as this is internal to ERPNext usage.  This addition is an id and date separate from posting date, and the id is separate and different from erpnext supplier quotation number.

Occasionally, suppliers offer quotations for similar or equal products in quick succession, with different price, terms, etc. and it is crucial to have the ability to quickly differentiate and eliminate ambiguity by having the ID and date readily available when referring to quotations with suppliers.

The **Item Tax Template** does not have an "include in base rate" tick box which is necessary when creating sales invoices with different G.S.T. percentages in POS.
On my wishlist:
- [ ] to have these check boxes in the Text Editor field type.
