Follow-up of #3066

Things I did extra:
- Change `npmDependencyRemoved`'s signature to accept a `string` instead of `{ name: string }`, because it only has 1 argument
- Put all styles into the `elements.ts` file
- Make `AddResource` a `FunctionComponent`
- Move `overmind` subscriptions as close as possible to the components itself instead of passing it through
This example that I modified from a template never gets transpiled:

# üêõ bug report

## Description of the problem
When I switch to another file or move between split windows in my project, it can take up to 20 seconds before I can start editing the file.

## How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish?
I love using this site. It makes working on my project from multiple environments very easy. But it's taking me much longer to work on my project because of the latency between switching files.

# üåà Feature

I don't see in the doc how to choose syntax hightlighting for custom extension files.

Example: a js library we've created use custom files using `.patch` extension, which are actually javascript array, so I would love a way to tell to codesandbox "please coloring this file as it is a javascript one"

https://codesandbox.io/s/simple-animation-02wr5?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fpatch.patch&theme=dark&view=editor

Fun fact is that when I click on the share button, my custom extension file get syntax hightlighting! (but not once in editor)

Hi,

I have a CodeSandbox which is a basic Express app.
You can find it here: https://codesandbox.io/s/cold-butterfly-nl30s
As you can see, when you visit the above URL, "Hello World!" is displayed in the preview pane and "It Works!" is logged to the terminal.

My problem is that when I embed the sandbox on our site and set the terminal to be open in the embed,  nothing is logged to the terminal.

You can see the problem demonstrated here: https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=174674&preview=1&_ppp=efe3e7b8a1

"Hello World!" is displayed in the preview pane, as expected. However the terminal remains blank (I would like to see "It Works!" logged).

Here is my embed code:

```html
<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/cold-butterfly-nl30s?codemirror=1&expanddevtools=1&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&moduleview=1&theme=dark"
     style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="cold-butterfly-nl30s"
     allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; accelerometer; gyroscope; payment; ambient-light-sensor; encrypted-media; usb"
     sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"

```

What am I doing wrong?
# üêõ bug report
React DevTools takes over cmd+f  when opened (no focus)  

## Description of the problem
Small UX bug where the React DevTools takeover the cmd+f keyboard shortcut.

## How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish?
Breaks Dev experience. Need to close the DevTools to do search.
A solution would be to check if the DevTools has focus

# üêõ bug report
Using Quick Open (Ctrl+P) to go to a file doesn't move cursor focus to the selected file

## Description of the problem
While using the Quick Open feature (Ctrl+P) and selecting a file (Using Enter key), No cursor is shown in the selected file.

## How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish?
I was trying to use this feature as in vs-code. There the cursor focus will be moved to the file selected and I could start typing directly. Here, I tried typing after selecting a file from Quick Open and it didn't work.

# üêõ bug report

## Description of the problem

On opening sandbox in embed mode, if a dependency is required to be added on the fly then the button shows up in the browser but when tried to click nothing happens.

## How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish?

I'm trying to embed codesandbox in my application where I'd like load a code snippet of an NPM package. While loading codesandbox I'm able to specify any npm package I'd like to load as a dependency by specifying it in the params but after the codesandbox has loaded, it doesn't allow to add anymore dependencies.

Follow-up of #2729

Things I did extra:
- Change `profileMounted`'s signature to accept a `string` instead of `{ username: string }`, because it only has 1 argument
- Put all styles into the `elements.ts` file
- Fix `Profile`'s props by using `react-router-dom`'s `RouteComponentProps` generic instead of hardcoding it
- Export `Profile` by a named export  instead of a `default export`
