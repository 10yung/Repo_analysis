On the first run of Cairo, we used to automatically populate Quick Launch with the current pinned taskbar apps in Windows. This stopped working.
Wide icon for App opened (but not pinned in quicklaunch), is a choose ?

You don't like MacOs style? Same widht for all icons and the App opened marked.

- Sync windows desktop icon size with the cairo if not using as shell like the hide desktop icons;
- Select desktop icon instead click hover? maybe what we need its a drag&drop T^T
- Hide quickmenu when in desktop;
- Keep the desktop overlay active after *example* delete some file;
- Quick configuration menu on right click taskbar? (maybe open taskmanager too seems to keep the windows productivity);
- Show a close menu when open some window after search icon, thats a nice feature to fast close windows;
- Desktop overlay when mouse corner right top;
- Menu preview when hover, like downloads, programs, places etc.
- Desktop icon area instead when hover name/icon;

well i think its all we need to be the best shell lol;

- Taskbar corner in fullwidth at flat style still rounded;
- Alt + F4 prompt only work in desktop if click on a desktop icon (needs put an lowlevel input and fix the old PR274);
- default theme style dont show select in combobox at configuration in firstrun;
- when click in the app selector, the menu freezes while the select search for apps instead hide the menu before and after that open the selector;

When installing CairoSetup_64bit.exe Windows Defeneder SmartScreen blocks it with a popup saying it is an unrecognized app and that running it might put your PC at risk.  Not the best first impression if someone it trying it out for the first time. I'm assuming that the installer is unsigned and that signing it would fix this issue.

Hi there! I am running the latest version of cairo, and some software cant be maximized again after minimizing to the taskbar. 

For this software I need to use Alt + Tab for changing the current window.

Software I noticed it:
- Ryzen Master (in very few cases it worked maximizing, mostly not)
- some Games (Assasins Creed Origins)
- Latency Mon

If I can help in someway just tell me what I have to do to provide more information. (logs, etc)

The Windows task bar shows the tooltips above the taskbar, however in Cairo, the tooltips are positioned where the mouse cursor is, this gets annoying, the tooltips can be repositioned by traversing up the tree to position the tooltip based on the parent.
