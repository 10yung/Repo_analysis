After changing the burger icon, on toggling the icon remain same its not changing to back arrow how can i change it.
Please help me!
Hi thanks for the great library!

How do you disable drag to open.

i have a toggle button at the top and everytime i toggle it the drag to open function executes. I try searching in the closed issue https://github.com/yarolegovich/SlidingRootNav/issues/14
and it states to use setMenuLocked but this locks the menu altogether.

How can disable just the dragging to open menu.

thanks in advance

I want to show this SlidingRootNav NavigationDrawer in all activities any help?
I have used the Sliding Navigation and its really awesome. I have a requirement that, on opening the sidemenu on clicking the menu items redirecting to respective page without closing the menu. But on clicking the outside area other than menu items will close the sidemenu.
Req:1  
open side menu -> select item -> redirect to respective page(without closing the menu)

Req:2
open side menu -> click on the outside area other than side menu items -> close the side menu.

Note: Currently in my application i am closing the sidemenu menu on clicking the outside area and on item selected closes the menu and then redirecting to respective page by overriding the dispatchTouchEvent method.

Thanks in advance
