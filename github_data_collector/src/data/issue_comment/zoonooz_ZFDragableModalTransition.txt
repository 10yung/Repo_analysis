Is there a way for me receive touches on a UIButton that is in the "behind" view controller while the "front" view controller is being presented?  Like being able to handle touches on the plus button in the lower controller here:

Hi,

I've made many improvements to this project. First of all, I've imported most of the useful changes from other contributors. Then I've added 3 main changes:
1. Keep tracking dragging when moving up, instead of doing nothing, so that it could feel nature.
2. Added customizable velocity and distance to dismiss the modal view more flexibly.
3. Added a delegate to check if we should begin the pan gesture, to avoid gesture conflicts.

Thanks!

When the modal view doesn't have a zero origin bound, after rotation, the original presenting view will be set to negative frame origin. e.g., if the bounds is -20, the backViewController's view will collide with the status bar.
i have a tableview being presented, and when building with xcode 9 beta 5 it won't accept any user touch events. works fine with xcode 8/ios 10.3. any ideas on what the problem might be? elements in the presented modal controller that aren't in the tableview work fine.
My first view controller is locked to landscape mode only (by overriding `supportedInterfaceOrientations`, while the destination view controller can be either portrait or landscape. When I navigate to the second view and switch to portrait and then try to swipe to dismiss, the animation glitches out heavily.

Are there any possible workarounds for this?
Gesture fails even if `scrollView`  `contentOffset.y` is 0. This happens when you started more "horizontal" pan gesture than vertical. And dismiss gesture not started, even if you on top of `scrollView`. 
Current version (0.6) does not have Carthage support
My view controller presenting the modal view controller has the top element with a top spacing of 20. After dismissing the modal view using the drag down gesture, the top spacing seems to be gone. And it looks to be gone not only for the base view controller in that tab (I am also using a tab bar controller), but it's also gone for other view controllers in the tab bar controller. Let me know if you want screenshots.
