Should not receive touches when in slider

Allow devs to instantiate a PaperFoldNavigation class from IB and set rootViewControllerID, leftViewControllerID, rightViewControllerID with Storyboard ID of other UIViewControllers.

Files are not there in any folder.

Hello,

Awesome Job !

But I found some strange behaviors for some AutoresizingMasks, while using `PaperFold` on iPhone 6.

The `line` in `- (void)setTopFoldContentView:(UIView*)view topViewFoldCount:(int)topViewFoldCount topViewPullFactor:(float)topViewPullFactor` has a mask with a flexible height, but has a height of 1.
In the same method, think the correct AutoresizingMask for `rightFoldView` should be `
UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth|UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleBottomMargin`

In `- (void)setContent:(UIView *)contentView`, there is a `UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth` (2 actually), but no `UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight`.

Hello honcheng,

I was using pod to install the paper-fold version 1.1, and I got the error:  property "timerStepDuration" not found on object of type "PaperFoldView".

I went to the file PaperFoldView.h and I found the property "timeStepDuration" is not there compare to the PaperFoldView.h on Github : (

Any solution for that?

Thank you!

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the PaperFold project
2. Insert this line in init after the views are setup:
`[_paperFoldView setPaperFoldState:PaperFoldStateLeftUnfolded animated:NO];`
3. Run the app and observe the left view. It is unfolded, as expected.
4. Swipe left to fold the left view
5. Instead of the left view folding it is simply covered by the center view

If you unfold the left view again and fold it it will work, but the first time it doesn't. This bug only happens if the state is set with animations turned off.

After a vertical swipe the left / right menu (horizontal) button would
not open anymore because the default is Vertical and there is no
setting it to Horizontal (added now) in the left / right ones.

Hi there,
I'm trying to implement top and bottom views with some interaction in them, like UISwitch or UiSegmentControl, UITextField etc. So the thing is I can't interact with them at all, they behave if they were just an image, no movement at all. If I put the same view to the left or right folding view, then I interact with them just fine.
Please help what to do with it.

1. Fix for issue where multifold view sets new fold views visible although content view is visible, which results on unresponsive side view with fold views overlaid over content view.
2. Fixes issue where user could set pan direction to vertical by vertical gesture and if top & bottom folding is not enabled, horizontal panning wouldn't work after
