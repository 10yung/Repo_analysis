`continue` in switch renders PHP notice for PHP 7.3.
Replaced with `continue 2;`
Without that code, you will run really a loooot of update queries setting nothing.
i.e. ...SET [nothing here] WHERE... . Pretty useless.
This is because in case of structures like this (prestashop, table ps_meta_lang) it fails using using a NON UNIQUE column as primary index... and you can image the mess. https://i.snipboard.io/H4NEcj.jpg

Let me know if you need more details.
Workaround for issue #271  - managed to use this when migrating a number of sites.
RegExps can be used to include or exclude tables.

I take the full tables list and first only include tables matching the `--tables` selector
and after, exclude the tables matching the `--exclude-tables` selector.
It gives you an infinity of possibilities !

This ensures operations are not reported as successful when there are Errors or Warnings (typically caused by changes in PHP core which cause breaking changes in SRDB). By adding exit() to the error_handler callback, wrapper scripts which call `srdb.cli.php` from the command line will properly detect when an error occurs to stop operations.
Order table list by name and add large field size for search / replace informations
This appears to occur when the database field contains binary data. Some wordpress plugins do this, eg [Wordfence](https://www.wordfence.com/)

It appears there are no unit test to cover this case. I considered adding them, but looks like there's a bit of work to get them modernised. Would rather not sink time into that unless the maintainers are on board.

Considered using `mb_detect_encoding`, but it appears there are cases where `mb_detect_encoding` can detect a valid encoding for which `mb_split` still returns `false`.

Not sure if there are cases where we **do** really want to modify binary data, but seems like a pretty risky edge case imo.
I was getting:

PHP Notice:  A non well formed numeric value encountered in Search-Replace-DB/srdb.cli.php on line 197

Need to convert to float the report start and end times to remove this error in the log function
Symptoms: AJAX error from web UI, "Call to undefined function mb_regex_encoding()" error from srdb.cli

https://github.com/interconnectit/Search-Replace-DB/issues/130#issuecomment-206207315 had the fix already, but I had to poke around to figure this out on a new server setup. After php-mbstring install, web UI worked. Should be in README
