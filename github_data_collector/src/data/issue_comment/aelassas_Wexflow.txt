after unpacking

running 
dotnet Wexflow.Server.dll

In /opt/wexflow/Wexflow-5.2/src/dotnet-core/Wexflow.Server

give me following message

Could not execute because the specified command or file was not found.
Possible reasons for this include:
  * You misspelled a built-in dotnet command.
  * You intended to execute a .NET Core program, but dotnet-Wexflow.Server.dll does not exist.
  * You intended to run a global tool, but a dotnet-prefixed executable with this name could not be found on the PATH.

dotnet seems ok

dotnet -v

.NET Core SDK (3.1.101)
Usage: dotnet [runtime-options] [path-to-application] [arguments]

Execute a .NET Core application.

Thanks

Hi, I am new to wexflow, and have created a new User, but I can't able to login with new Username and password and delete the user from User tab and by using REST API (http://localhost:8000/wexflow/deleteUser?username=XXXX&password=XXXXXYYY") . 
I work on Mac Catlina vesrsion 10.15.2,  .Net core 3.1 and wexflow 5.2. 

Where are user details stored in wexflow ? 
And When I select the user it shows errors in console.. 

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'Id' of undefined
    at users.min.js:1
    at XMLHttpRequest.r.onreadystatechange 
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'Password' of undefined
Hi
any plan for [blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor) support?
Hello;
one of my scenarios:

1- 'Employment employee' flow; this flow has n steps. each steps goes to a cartable[dashboard] according by access level and Organization chart. and maybe wait for a week or month to confirm or reject.

2- 'Apply for a loan' flow; similar above flow maybe takes days or weeks and even months to finishing the flow.
Not able to create custom event in ExecutionGraph like OnRejected and  OnSuccess in Approval workflow. 
Please let us know if there are any dependencies required.

-nitin
tried creating a custom task & executing following the steps as given in https://github.com/aelassas/Wexflow/wiki/Custom-tasks
While loading the xml getting the error : 
2019-12-10 16:37:57,071 ERROR [23] - An error occured while loading the workflow : C:\Wexflow\Workflows\Workflow_MyTask - Copy.xml Please check the workflow configuration. Error: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Xml.XDocument, Version=4.1.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
Please let us know if there are any dependencies required.
It would be amazing to have a task/step that waits (indefinitely or defined TimeSpan) for an http REST call to a unique url (GUID) and then can use the properties of the REST call (headers, parameters, query string, etc) to do something. 

I imagine this wouldn't be too hard to implement.   The service could have a standard callback url for this purpose along with a GUID for the identifier.
Is there currently or planned support for using DynamoDB as the workflow engine backing store?  That would be awesome as I don't want to use any of the other NoSQL options.   I believe a lot or people would appreciate this.
