This code runs slightly faster as it does not need to iterate through all rows, just through the positive values.

1. Optimized the code in the cost function of the multi variable cost function file for better performance.
2. Changed the value of alpha in the Multi variable ex1_multi.m file for better results.

Also earlier number of iterations required were greater than 400 but the value of num_iters was 400.
Now, the number of iterations can also be changed to a lesser value (smaller than 400).
