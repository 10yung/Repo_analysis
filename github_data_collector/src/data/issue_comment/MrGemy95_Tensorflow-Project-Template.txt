I found that in your example code, you loaded the model, then ran the variable initialisation, which effectively erased the loaded model. I changed the code to load the model **after** initialisation to avoid this problem. I hope you accept this change.

I was running this on tensorflow 1.7, so it is possible that this behaviour didn't exist in previous versions.
1.Add _init_path.py in mains in order to add root path in python path.
2.Import _init_path.py in example.py
