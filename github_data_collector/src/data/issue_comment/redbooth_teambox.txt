For instance, I have seted my time zone to Adelaide(9:30), if I go to the calendar at 9:00AM morning the current day is 8th Feb but in the Time tracking section, it shows today is 7th Feb. This because 9AM in Adelaide is around 5PM in San Francisco, which happens to be one day different.

Without this patch, you can see other people's data exports, e.g : https://teambox.com/datas/2336

When fetching emails from Gmail's POP server, you need to set Net::POP3.enable_ssl(OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE)

I added a config setting to enable this in teambox.yml

Incoming e-mail processing for e-mails with attachments is broken because Paperclip expects an object that implements rewind, which the mail part objects do not. They also do not have some attributes Paperclip requires.

This commit fixes these issues.

Hi, I've worked through merging my fixes from master to the dev branch. These commits should be exactly equivalent to the ones from master, with the exclusion of the fix for rspec-on-rails-matchers, as that plugin has been removed from dev and so the patch no longer applies.

These commits fix the following:
- receive_email script breakage if not specifically run from the Rails root
- typo in output redirection in receive_email script which could inadvertently generate a bounce message
- old version of Whenever doesn't work with Bundler
- Whenever config is broken (tries to call a Rails method)
- extraneous cron job for mail:inbox will fail if using pipe method
- Sphinx cron job incorrectly rebuilds rather than reindexing

Hey guys, check out the capybara-webkit drivers :) they make cucumber testing alot less painful
