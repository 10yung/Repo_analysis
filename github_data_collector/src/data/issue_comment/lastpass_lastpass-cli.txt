Since `brew update` is run automatically before `brew install`, this part of the README seems unnecessary.

This behaviour exists since 2016: https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/288

Hi!

I'm trying to log in using lpass cli with Microsoft authenticator enabled. After entering my master password an error in red appears saying **'Microsoft authenticator authentication required!'**. But then it asks me for my master password again so nothing happens. I'm able to log in through web and browser extension by entering the 2fa code. So it seems there is a problem with the lastpass cli.
I've already reported this issue through LogMeIn Support (ticket 12132104) and they confirmed the issue and it seems it requires code change. 

```
lpass -version
LastPass CLI v1.3.3.GIT
```

```
installed via brew
macOS Mojave version 10.14.5
```

```
curl --version
curl 7.54.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin18.0) libcurl/7.54.0 LibreSSL/2.6.5 zlib/1.2.11 nghttp2/1.24.1
Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap ldaps pop3 pop3s rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp
Features: AsynchDNS IPv6 Largefile GSS-API Kerberos SPNEGO NTLM NTLM_WB SSL libz HTTP2 UnixSockets HTTPS-proxy
```

Please let me know if you need more details about the issue.

Thank you!

If I create a new site the only password related field is `Password`. I can update this and everything (autofill, etc) works as expected.

Some of my other entries are older and have both a `pwd` and `Password` field. If I update the `Password` field the autofill feature still pulls the value from the `pwd` field.
In the vault the `Password` field is used to populate the `Site password` input element in the UI but upon clicking the wrench to view all the background fields I see that `pwd` is the old value.

It seems that even in the vault updating the `Site password` doesn't affect the `pwd` field, however- if I update the `pwd` field in the UI it does affect the `Password` / `Site password` value. Furthermore- it seems impossible to delete the `pwd field`.

I'm at an impass- do I delete and recreate all of my entries so that none have the `pwd` field? I don't want to add `pwd` to all entries as then the vault's UI doesn't seem to work properly.
The documentation says that the lastpass-cli rpm should be in EPEL for CentOS 7 or greater. However, on CentOS 8, it is not available, even in EPEL. Is the documentation wrong or is the fact the rpm isn't in EPEL a mistake?
I want to use lastpass-cli with my WSL terminal but unfortunately since WSL can't open graphical programs, xclip does not work. I copy things to my clipboard on WSL using clip.exe which functions just the same as using xclip so I assume it wouldn't be out of the realm to implement. 
The output format of `lpass ls` is incompatible with the input format of `lpass show`. This is pretty frustrating.

For instance, it does not allow me to pipe the output into my own fuzzy finder. 
I would like to do something like
`lpass ls | fzf | lpass show -pc` and let `fzf` fuzzy find the entry I'm interested in.

Right now `ls` gives output like `(category)/name [id: ################]` Is there a flag to make `lpass show` accept this output as input? 
I want to be able to use a local passcode to access lpass (when logged in). This is both more secure (I do not need to type out my main password when under camera supervision in public places), and more ergonomic. (I'll use an easier-to-type passcode than my main password.)
This design pattern is fairly common in apps that contain personal information but need high-availability.
I like to do sth like `lpass show -G -X --by-username someuser` and see all accounts with the matched username. This is quite useful when you have multiple accounts on a single site.
