There is a .orig file in the luadist lua repo.

This is a file created by the git merge system. You almost certainly checked it to git by accident. It's not in the Lua 5.1.5 official release.

Sometimes I run a script to make sure I'm not accidentally leaving any orig files around in my repo. It freaks out out on my luadist remote because of the orig file in there.

Probably best to just delete it.
