Currently, this is the what the tool outputs:
```
You've cleared approximately MB: 1292 or GB: 1 of space!
```
It is not proper English even and even less so - SI. It should be instead:
```
You've cleared approximately 1,292 MB or 1 GB of space!
```
And, yes, there should be a space after the number: https://www.engadget.com/2010/12/16/32-gb-versus-32gb-almost-everyone-is-writing-it-wrong/
After the command `docker-clean` all networks will be removes and can not recreated with docker-compose up

Hey, great tool!

I just ran it and thought the savings message at the end was a little awkward. Maybe you'd like to merge this small change in phrasing?
Dead containers are not currently being recognized as stopped containers.

This logic should get built in as another optional flag.
Add option to exclude container names and/or image names
Implement a regexp to run more aggressive cleanup tasks on known images/containers that may still be tagged
Update makefile to run on tagged releases to make the image names make the more logical sense.
Results in errors saying that container or image doesn't exist.  Suspect an array not being re-assigned.
