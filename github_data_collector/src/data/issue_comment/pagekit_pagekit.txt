WebP images can be uploaded to storage once the **webp** extension has been added to the system settings for an accepted file type - but - they can't be used when trying to insert them into a page or blog post, or anywhere that the (Vue/Pagekit) Finder is used.

They can be seen in the popup in list or grid view, but selecting them or ticking their box is as far as you can get. 'Select' is not available to complete the insertion.

Developer solution, with the following caveats...

- Keep in mind that this will definitely break if you need to update Pagekit later on, so be warned that you'll need to do this all again until 'someone' decides to fix the core files to add this. 
- This fix does NOT provide a fallback option to serve JPG or PNG files for browsers that dont accept WebP images. If you want to manually edit the page/widget source to include a fallback code block, [refer to this code](https://usefulangle.com/post/114/webp-image-in-html-with-fallback) for using a `<picture>` element.
- This fix assumes that you're using the default editor. It may or may not produce the same results with TinyMCE.

1. Find the javaScript for the Finder to add the 'webp' mime type. Locate it at: **`/app/system/modules/finder/app/bundle/panel-finder.js`**. PLEASE make a copy before you edit the file.
2. It's a 'minified' script file, so unless you're comfortable editing it that way, use an online unminify tool - or your favorite code editor - to reformat it back to a readable/searchable state.
3. On, or near, line 154 is the function that checks for an acceptable mime type that the Finder can use.

The block, before:
```
isImage: function(e) {
                return e.match(/\.(?:gif|jpe?g|png|svg|ico)$/i)
            },
```
And after:
```
isImage: function(e) {
                return e.match(/\.(?:gif|jpe?g|png|svg|ico|webp)$/i)
            },
```
If you're editing raw, just locate the '**|ico**' text and append it with '**|webp**'. You may have to clear your browser and/or site cache once or twice before the images become visible as real images in the finder (assuming you're using a browser that supports WebP), and they become selectable.

If you only see the generic 'file' icon in the finder view when you should see an actual image, there's an issue with your edited script or your cache.

## Problem

Hello, using the instance rewrite rule given in the document will cause some extensions to fail (Error 404). It should be the rewrite rule that causes the extension request to the wrong directory, and the files in the correct directory exist. I hope it can be solved.

- Webserver: NGINX 1.17
- Database: MySQL 5.6
- PHP Version: 7.2

## Problem

User creation issues for both frontend and backend.

## Technical Details

- Pagekit version: 1.0.17
- Webserver: LiteSpeed
- Database: sqlite 3.26.0
- PHP Version: 7.2.24

These are both issues that have workarounds, which I'll detail, but I wanted to at least document the triggering issues.

1. Adding a new user as the admin from the backend can fail with an incorrect error message describing an unrelated reason...

Steps...
Create any new user while logged in as the admin, where the new user's email address is known to be valid. The only difference with user registrations from a default install is that the 'email-verification' option is enabled, along with admin approval.

Error shown inline is: "Field must be a valid email address." This was a test account, and I created the email address under one of my own domains, have tested it, and it is working and valid.

Workaround...
Create the user with the standard front-facing registration page, and then enable the user once it's created.

I didn't try toggling the registration options to see if there was an alternate setup that would let the backend process complete, but it should work as set, yes?

2. Confirmation email links can be corrupted beyond repair under certain circumstances.

Steps...
When you are logged into the site in a browser that's set up to be your system default - then click on the confirmation email link for a fresh test user - once your confirmation string is sent to a newly opened tab, it will completely fail, and 'corrupt' the new user account - then continue to fail when resubmitting that same URL string. It will consistently fail, no matter what browser is used, and whether your earlier user (or admin) account has been logged out.

Error shown is...
Debug was used, and generated the following:
![pagekit_user-confirmation-error_debug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16087649/68442654-ae110400-019f-11ea-9569-ff1a409e6016.jpg)

Workaround...
Delete the new user account (it's toast at this point), and start the registration process again, When done, log out as the other user and click to confirm - or - copy/paste the redone confirmation link into another browser that you aren't logged in with.

Obviously this one isn't an everyday occurrence, but it would have been better to have a graceful failure without destroying/corrupting the data. I presume it destroyed the temporary key issued for the confirmation run somewhere in mid-process, and locked out any possibility to recover from it.

## Problem

When I try to install any Extension or Theme from the Marketplace it does not install it.

**Error Message**

```
Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies
Warning: "continue" targeting switch is equivalent to "break". Did you mean to use "continue 2"?
```

<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [lodash's releases](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/releases).*

> ## 4.0.0
> # [lodash v4.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400)
> 
> 2015 was big year! [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) became the [most depended on](https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491#file-01-most-dependent-upon-md) npm package, passed [1 billion](http://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=&author=jdalton) downloads, & its v3 release saw massive adoption!
> 
> The year was also one of collaboration, as discussions began on [merging Lodash & Underscore](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/underdash/underdash/issues/14). Much of Lodash v4 is proofing out the ideas from those discussions. Lodash v4 **would not be possible** without the collaboration & contributions of the Underscore core team. In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with [several members](https://github.com/orgs/lodash/people) contributing to both libraries.
> 
> For 2016 & [lodash v4.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400) we wanted to cut loose, push forward, & take things up a notch!
> 
> ## Modern only
> 
> With v4 we’re breaking free from [old projects](https://github.com/lodash-archive), old environments, & dropping [old IE < 9 support](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support)!
> 
> ## 4 kB Core
> 
> Lodash’s kitchen-sink size will continue to grow as new methods & functionality are added. However, we now offer a 4 kB (gzipped) [core build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0/dist) that’s compatible with [Backbone v1.2.4](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/3839) for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink.
> 
> ## More ES6
> 
> We’ve continued to embrace ES6 with methods like [_.isSymbol](https://lodash.com/docs#isSymbol), added support for cloning & comparing array buffers, maps, sets, & symbols, converting iterators to arrays, & iterable `_(…)`.
> 
> In addition, we’ve published an [es-build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0-es/) & pulled [babel-plugin-lodash](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash) into core to make tree-shaking a breeze.
> 
> ## More Modular
> 
> Pop quiz! 📣
> 
> What category path does the `bindAll` method belong to? Is it 
> 
> A) `require('lodash/function/bindAll')`
> B) `require('lodash/utility/bindAll')`
> C) `require('lodash/util/bindAll')`
> 
> Don’t know? Well, with v4 it doesn’t matter because now module paths are as simple as
> 
> ``` js
> var bindAll = require('lodash/bindAll');
> ```
> 
> We’ve also reduced module complexity making it easier to create smaller bundles. This has helped Lodash adoption with libraries like [Async](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/caolan/async/pull/996) & [Redux](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rackt/redux/pull/611)!
> 
> ## 1st Class FP
> 
> With v3 we introduced [lodash-fp](https://github.com/lodash-archive/lodash-fp). We learned a lot & with v4 we decided to [pull it into core](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide).
> 
> Now you can get immutable, auto-curried, iteratee-first, data-last methods as simply as
> 
> ``` js
> var _ = require('lodash/fp');
> var object = { 'a': 1 };

## Problem

Hi,I found a php code execution vulnerability at pagekit latest version 1.0.17
Step:
1. add "php" File Extensions via /admin/system/settings
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33925178/65383461-85948e00-dd48-11e9-95aa-d50e8045e65e.png)
2.upload evil php file via /pagekit/system/finder/upload

## Problem

Hi,

When a user is requesting to reset his password using a valid email account, Pagekit gives the following response.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53895017/65129478-ef9df200-da2d-11e9-95f6-c2b25c15e322.png)

However, when an invalid email account is submitted, Pagekit notifies user that the particular email account cannot be found.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53895017/65129529-10664780-da2e-11e9-83c9-b4bf32a2fd46.png)

Leveraging on this, the attacker can use a list of emails to enumerate the valid user accounts based on the response of the server.

Recommendation: It is recommended to give generic responses when user inputs his email address for recovery e.g. "If this email exists, you will receive an email with the reset instructions." in order to prevent user account enumeration.

OWASP ref: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_User_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account_(OWASP-AT-002)

## Technical Details

- Pagekit version: 1.0.17

- Database: MySQL 
- PHP Version: 7.2.21
