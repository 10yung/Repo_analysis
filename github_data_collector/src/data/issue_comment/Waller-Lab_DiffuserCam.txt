On the ADMM3D solver, it should be ceil(Nz/2) instead of ceil(Nz/2) + 1
psf = circshift(flip(psf,3),ceil(Nz/2)+2,3)/norm(psf(:));  %Shift impulse stack
I cant understand this code.
h(, ;-z) = h(, ; Nz - z) is a z-stack that is flipped in the zdirection.
Why circshift is needed?
Could you please provide additional raw samples that have not been down-sampled? Something natural such as images out the window or faces with natural lighting.


Also a raw video (PNG per frame) if possible.


I'm running my own optimization routines w/ pytorch.
Codes breaks for RGB images. 
At end of execution, label the copied config file using the same date time stamp that currently is appended to result filename.
Currently save_every does not work. Warning has been added to settings file, but this feature should be enabled in the future. 

Deconvolution fails when z-stack is not power of 2
