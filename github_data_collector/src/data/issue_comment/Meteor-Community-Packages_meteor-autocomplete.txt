When write some text in the autocomplete input the browser in the console display this error :
Exception in template helper: AutoComplete.prototype.filteredList

Hello, I use inputAutocomplete, to search in a Collection called Sales, to return a field Product.name. I need, that the autocomplete search, return two fields, in this case, Product.name and Product.img (contains an url for the image of this product), and put this field in another input text. 
Of course i can create another helper but  for that, i need to do another search. 
Can meteor-autocomplete can return two fields, and can i put one field in one inputAutocomplete, and the other field in another input? 
Thanks

Leonardo
I have a popup model on a page in which there is a inputAutocomplete template (which is basically a text input box) in which after typing "@" a list of values appear.
Everything works fine until i type a very lengthy text inside the "inputAutocomplete". Say the number of character that can be displayed by the textbox is 25. Now i type some text "cghchghg..." which is 30 characters long. Then i give a token "@" and the list of required values comes up, but this list is given after giving some space in front of the popup model and not immediately after the model as shown below:

 The expected behaviour is this

Thanks for great plugin! 
I'm trying to use it in dictionary, to point at the root of word. But list of 5 limited selections looks empty. But in console event return some relevant word object, searched through template subscription (not all collection)... Why list of autocomplete items looks empty? 
 Article collection document looks like { words: [{note, word}], translations: [ ] }
Honestrly, I don't know, what should I write in Template.rootAutocomplete . 

```js
  rootAutocompleteSettings() {
    return {
      position: "top",
      limit: 5,
      rules: [
        {
          collection: Articles,
          field: "words.word",
          template: Template.rootAutocomplete
        }
      ]
    };
  }
```
```js
{{> inputAutocomplete settings=rootAutocompleteSettings id="msg" class="input-xlarge" placeholder="root"}}
```
```js
<template name="rootAutocomplete">
    {{words.word}}
</template>
```

Attempted to do it this way but it did not work

```
settings: function() {
        return {
            position: 'bottom',
            limit: 5,
            rules: [
                 {
                     collection: Models,
                     field: 'name',
                     matchAll: true,
                     template: Template.standardLegends,
                },
                {
                    collection: Models,
                    field: 'createdBy',
                    matchAll: true,
                    template: Template.standardLegendsOwner,
                },
            ],
        };
    },
```
However this doesn't work. Is there any way to accomplish this?

I would realy like the option of displaying nothing when there are no matches. It would be great to be able to specify `noMatchTemplate: false` or maybe `null` and have it just not show anything. 

For my use case, I'm displaying employee names if they exist, but using the same input for entering a new employee name. If there are no matches, it doesn't make sense to display that fact, I'd like it to simply look like a normal input field.
I would like to listen to change events of inputs of this autocomplete package.
This package looks great. Any suggestions on how to get it to work with React instead of Blaze templates?

Hello 
How can I change the code so the Auto-complete starts after entering the n-th letter.
