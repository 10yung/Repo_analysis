I am a user of httpstat and I used httpstat as an example to show how to package software as snaps (https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/snappy). 

To make a snap for a software package, you need to create a snapcraft.yaml configuration file. 
Here is the one for httpstat: https://gist.github.com/simos/3214bbd2f7d4a4647918bdb2afb926cd

How to create the snap?
1. Install snapcraft 2.26 (default in Ubuntu 16.04 or newer)
2. Run "snapcraft" in the same directory that has the snapcraft.yaml from the gist.
3. The httpstat_1.1.3_amd64.snap will be produced. 

I wrote an article about all this at https://blog.simos.info/how-to-create-a-snap-for-a-python-app-with-networking-using-snapcraft-in-ubuntu-16-04/

I understand that someone would simply need to grab the .py file and run it. I am posting this issue to inform that I have used "httpstat" as an example for my tutorial.
This would be super useful to have for learning more about the certificate a particular site uses. It could be an add-on option (not default) which shows issuer information, if its valid, start/expire, and possibly other details.

Just an idea!
This PR is aimed at solving any problems that would happen when running httpstat on windows.
Installed via PIP on two separate computers running Windows 10 with Python 3.5.2 and Python 3.5.0 and attempted `httpstat google.com` in the command line and received 'failed to create process'. Navigated directly in the command line to the default Python scripts folder and ran `py httpstat-script.py google.com` and received the following on both machines:
`Traceback (most recent call last):
File ".\httpstat-script.py", line 9, in <module>
    load_entry_point('httpstat==1.2.1', 'console_scripts', 'httpstat')()
File "c:\users\%NAME%\appdata\local\programs\python\python35\lib\site-packages\httpstat.py", line 221, in main
    p = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, env=cmd_env)

    restore_signals, start_new_session)

    startupinfo)
FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified`

Ran repair on my Python installation and retried. Uninstalled and reinstalled Python (using elevated privileges) and retried. No positive effect.

An attempt on a third Win10 computer with both Python 3.5.1 and Python 2.7 installed worked without issue. Installed via PIP and `httpstat google.com` ran correctly. Running the script directly on that machine with either version of Python also works without issue.
The following changes are done to append the redirect urls stats to the output. 
- [x] Added a new -L option analogous to the curl -L option to follow redirects and print the stats.
- [x] Changed the code formatting and created new functions run_command, print_stats and
  run_command_and_print_stats.
- [x] Appended keys http_code and redirect_curl to the curl format.
- [x] Added a while loop to print the stats if follow redirects (-L) option is used.

Sample output:
