Added an additional function disable_uac_win7() that disables UAC on Windows 7 and above VMs. This allows for more activity within the VM, without UAC blocking attempts. The function takes the VM name as an argument.

The goal here is to make something that might be more graceful and comprehensive than the present solution of registering ievms.bat as a scheduled task to run on-demand with `schtasks.exe`. This would enable cleaner implementation of additional VM software installs, with the additional benefit that, when used for malware analysis, the UAC feature won't block execution / priv escalation, so more data collection is possible.
This includes two commits that I've consistently had to make to my environments. Attempt to fix issue where drive letters in copy_to_vm are different than the windows configurations, and also fix the case where the "control ISO" won't boot in the VM because the DVD is not always the first boot device.
I've had several issues getting it installed and installing an IE vm. I had to use homebrew to install VirtualBox and unar, now I'm here:

Any ideas how to get this working? I tried installing IE11 but it looks like it's installing IE9, and plus it's not working.

Hello,

I don't expect this to get merged but I wanted to fix the lingering issues with `ievms.sh` that I have been manually patching as I need and I figured it would be beneficial to others. I wanted to bump version to `0.4.0` but I realized that there's a dependency on the releases for `ievms-control-0.3.3.iso` that I have no control over.

I removed WinXP VMs from the downloader, however I added a link in README for a Windows XP mode for Windows 7 machines which should prove helpful. This is working with VBoxManage version 5.2.12r122591
There is an API, that MS Dev site, that contains links to latest VM for given platform

GET https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/api/tools/vms/

It's would be a nice feature, if bash script could give that link from this API
It would appear this repo is idle or abandoned.
***If you know of a working version/fork of this repo please point it out to everyone.***

Currently this script doesn't work, and none of the forks work either.

I see more than a small amount of refactoring ahead to make the current download URLs (via https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/)::

```

```

work with the existing download code
```
    if [ "${os}" == "Win10" ]
    then
        url="https://az792536.vo.msecnd.net/vms/VMBuild_20171019/VirtualBox/MSEdge/MSEdge.Win10.
VirtualBox.zip"
    else
        url="https://az412801.vo.msecnd.net/vhd/VMBuild_20141027/VirtualBox/IE${version}/Windows
/IE${version}.${os}.For.Windows.VirtualBox.zip"
    fi
```

At which point, I'm forced to wonder if now isn't a good time to refactor the whole script.
Help me get IE7 running on my machine? I have Virtual Box installed.

I see the host az412801.vo.msecnd.net is baked into ievms.sh but I've no idea what it should be changed to, so cannot issue a PR.
