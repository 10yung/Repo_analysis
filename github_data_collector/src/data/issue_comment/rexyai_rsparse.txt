Looks very interesting and not too hard to implement https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06398.pdf

- [ ] objective
- [ ] SVD tricks and [MatrixCSR](https://github.com/dselivanov/MatrixCSR)
- [ ] fast grid-search  for `lambda` based on cross-validation 


- [ ] explain confidence
- [ ] solvers - cholesky, conjugate gradient
- [ ] checking convergence
- [ ] excluding items from prediction
Several choices:
- [plumber](https://github.com/trestletech/plumber)
- [Rserve](https://github.com/s-u/Rserve)
- [opencpu](https://www.opencpu.org/) (updated)
- ~[jug](http://bart6114.github.io/jug/index.html) (updated)~
- something else?
