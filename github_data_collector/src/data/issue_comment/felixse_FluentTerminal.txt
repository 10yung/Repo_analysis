When a tab contains code colored using ANSI escape sequences and it is dragged to create a new window, the colors are lost.

Here's the file I used in the preview above: https://gist.github.com/mlocati/fdabcaeb8071d5c75a2d51712db24011
The acrylic style terminal is a wonderful feature, but we sorely need an option to preserve transparency when working in other windows, the opaque black on inactive state isn't ideal.
I think it would be better to show the profile's name in the title of Tabs. The shell exe location is often too long and truncated, and it is unnecessary to know the path.
The issue happens always when I press the menu button (the three lines on top left).
No idea why.

You'll probably want us to discuss before merging. But long story short: this speeds up output 6-7 times in case when there's a lot of output. See https://github.com/jumptrading/FluentTerminal/issues/258 for more details.
So, hello there. I'm pretty new around here and this is one of my first issues to post. I love this terminal for the most part so far and love the fact that WSL2 (part of the Insider Preview Windows Builds) is quite a bit snappier and more overall functional like a true Linux system should be.

My big issue so far is that I can't figure out how to override the theme background of FluentTerminal with the colorscheme background only for that app. Any suggestions?

I installed fluent terminal using [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/fluent-terminal#install) but it crashes when opened. The error is:

`System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception (0x80004005): Could not enable virtual terminal processing.`

The new, significantly simplified version of `OnListViewSelectionChanged` has the same effect as the old version. Yet `Task.Run...` removed, and it's much simpler.
Sporadic bug. I set Cmd + Shift + C as the default "copy into clipboard" shortcut, and sometimes, but not always when I select something in my WSL shell (freshly started) and press the combination, the terminal just hangs and then crashes.
