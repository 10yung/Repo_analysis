The solution provides a linear scaled orthographic projection estimation of the camera pose. Is there also the possibilty to retrieve the current head pose? Or alternatively translate the camera pose into the head pose?
To be specific the head pose in terms of the euler angles or rotation with its centroid for example on the nose tip and directed towards the "camera". 
In demo.m, you only use shapeEV, shapePC, shapeMU from model. 

If I use the **Basel Face Model**, how to change {age, gender, weight, height} to get different results? Thank you very much.
Thanks for your code. 
The 53 landmark indices in your code are given by a code dictionary. How can I get the fix vertex index from mean shapeï¼Ÿ
