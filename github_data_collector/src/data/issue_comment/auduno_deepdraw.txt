Is there some method to support other frameworks?
like Tensorflow, Pytorch?
Hi, 

Have you tried running DeepDraw with other net architectures? For example, I've been able to run it with the ResNet-50 targeting the Softmax layer, but I'm not getting useful visualizations... Any suggestion on how to modify the "octaves" parameters?

Thank you!
