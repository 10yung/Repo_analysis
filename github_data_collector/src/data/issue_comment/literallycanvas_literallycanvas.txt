Hi,

To achieve getting whole drawings by `getImage()` but this doesn't seem to include the background image. Is there any method available for getting the whole drawing with the background image?

And I see exporting as SVG string which doesn't include `SVG export does not currently support watermarks, scale, or eraser shapes`, how to fix this? Is it implemented?

Thanks in advance!
Hi,

Is there any method or functionality available for free transformation on the shapes?

Hi all,

I have built a working react application and wanted to include the literally canvas tool in it.
So I copied the relevant folders to a root level folder within my application folder and wanted to include the canvas tool in my index.js file.
But unfortunately I receive an error 

> „Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.“. 


Seems to be something wrong with the ReactDOM.render method, but I am not able to wrap my head around what is wrong here.

Thank you so much for your support / ideas!

Best regards,
Nikolas 

Code of index.js is the following:
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import LC from './literallycanvas/js/LiterallyCanvas';
import './literallycanvas/css/literallycanvas.css'

ReactDOM.render(
    `<div>`
        <LC.LiterallyCanvasReactComponent imageURLPrefix="/literallycanvas/img" />
    `</div>,`
    document.getElementById('root'));


I get this error when try to export shapes with background image, Namespace prefix xlink for href on image is not defined..

Why?
can you remove react from this project?
