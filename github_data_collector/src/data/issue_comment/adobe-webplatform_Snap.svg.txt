The latest commit is two years old.

Is this project still alive?

If not. Which library do you recommend?

Please tell us the state at the top of the README. 

Thank you.

This can currently be done manually by users, but it would be useful, particularly for ES2017 `async/await` users, for Snap to return promises when it has finished. 
Hello,
I am trying to use Snap to precompute a series of SVGs, that are shown on demand.
is that possible?
My function creates the SVG with `s=Snap(600, 800) `and returns `s`
This allows to paste s anywhere but it is already created on the bottom of the page without any id associated. We would just like to get the SVG in the variable.
Thanks for any pointers to what I could do.

createTouch has been deprecated for a while now.

This fix uses the same technique used by Modernizr - https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/blob/377a6303b3b6d400979eeae351e1dcf43972eef4/feature-detects/touchevents.js#L40
