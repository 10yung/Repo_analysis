I want to use this in Vue.JS. Any example?
I tried to import this library with a React application:

```js
import nb from "notebookjs"
```

...but got the following errors:

```js
Compiled with warnings.

./node_modules/notebookjs/notebook.js
Critical dependency: the request of a dependency is an expression
```

I think the problem is the whole script is wrapped inside an IIFE. That would work if this script can be packaged with Webpack or Rollup.
Have you looked at providing additional support for ThebeLab within `notebookjs` so that a user could run the code in the page against a remote kernel of Binderhub launched kernel?

The following minor change seems to work.

In `nb.Input.prototype.render`, present the code as simply as possibly, in an appropriately configured `<pre>` tag (*ThebeLab* looks for code contained in a `<pre data-executable="true" data-language="python"></pre>` tag):

```python
        var pre_el = makeElement("pre");
        pre_el.setAttribute("data-executable", "true");
        pre_el.setAttribute("data-language", lang); //lang is the desired kernel
        pre_el.innerHTML = joinText(this.raw);
        holder.appendChild(pre_el);
```

Add in some ThebeLab config information to the `index.html` page:

```html
        <script type="text/x-thebe-config">
          {
            requestKernel: true,
            binderOptions: {
              repo: "binder-examples/requirements",
            },
          }
        </script>
```

Then crib from the ThebeLab docs to add a simple button to the top of the `index.html` page to enable the code for execution:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/thebelab@^0.4.0" ></script>
<div>
    <button id="activateButton"  style="width: 150px; height: 75px; font-size: 1.5em;">Activate</button>
    <script>
         var bootstrapThebe = function() {
            thebelab.bootstrap();
        }
        document.querySelector("#activateButton").addEventListener('click', bootstrapThebe)
    </script>
</div>
```
