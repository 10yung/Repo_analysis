Do you plan on supporting schema 4.2 any time soon? 
To increase discovery of this tool and improve management, this tool should be available via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). While I am willing to do so on my own, I thought it would be best to have the package uploaded by the maintainer of the original package. One thing to note is that since this is a module, the chocolateyinstall.ps1 installer script should either install directly to the normal PSModulePath or add the installer path (typically C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\) to the PSModulePath registry key for auto-discovery.
