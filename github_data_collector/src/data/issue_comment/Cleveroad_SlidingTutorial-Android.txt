Any plans on [migrating this library to AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate)? If not, this library becomes pretty much useless today (when the majority of the apps use AndroidX) ... Thanks!
Couldn't understand how to use it in my own app (creating the tutorial using the lib)... can someone make a video or explain it to a kinda beginner (hi) please?  sorry for bothering and thanks in advance!
Getting this issue. How to fix this? I am implementing Custom Support Fragment. I am using AndroidX.

`java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'boolean com.cleveroad.slidingtutorial.TutorialOptions.isMoveOnlyForward()' on a null object reference`
Added an almost full support in RTL, an Hebrew translation, "Done" button in the last slide & an interface which is called when the user slide the last slide. 

Thanks for making this library, it helped me a lot!
