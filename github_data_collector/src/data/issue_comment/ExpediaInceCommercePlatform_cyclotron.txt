*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

I am trying to change the numeralJS default settings (to pt-br BTW) but until now all my efforts has been in vain. I am assuming that the table and number widgets use numeralJS functions to format numbers. If not, please advise me how to do so.

Thanks. 
Is there any additional documentation for updating widget data. I have been using the json data source and querying a middle-ware API, the middle-ware is connecting to a WebSocket to get information when available.

I cannot seem to use the API to update the widget data, any help would be appreciated!
I created an HTML widget and in the HTML section, I put the following code:

```
<p>Date: #{openingDate}</p>
<p>Date: ${moment(#{openingDate}).format('YYYY-MM-DD')}</p>
```

Expected Output:
> Date: 2015-10-15T00:05:32.000Z
Date: 2015-10-15

Actual Output:
> Date: 2015-10-15T00:05:32.000Z
Date: ${moment(#{openingDate}).format('YYYY-MM-DD')}

API requests don't work for me.

GET /dashboard starts working after the fix in routes/api.js
`app.get('/api/dashboards', dashboards.get);`

I've added '/api' on the start. 
It seems to me others will start working after the same fix.

I've used the quickstart guide, but apparently something went wrong.
I just started using Cyclotron and for the most part am quite impressed.  Lots of great functionality and decently easy to configure.  However there's one glaring gap that I'm still in disbelief isn't there, and that's some UI for navigating pages on a dashboard.  As far as I can tell, the only way to move between pages on a dashboard is to set them to auto-rotate, or to use arrow keys.  I can't find any way to add like a ribbon on the bottom or a tree-list in the sidebar that automatically lists the pages by name and lets you browse and navigate to them.  This seems an obvious limitation, and one that really hurts usability.  I was even playing with some of the built-in example dashboards and it wasn't until I edited one that I realized it had 8 pages!

I have figured out a workaround by adding a sidebar section with HTML that contains links to the different pages (e.g. `<a href="/dashboardname?page=1">Page Name</a>`), but this is brittle since anytime the page list is modified, the links will need to be updated, and it's annoying that I have to manually create this in the first place.  I also tried a link like `<a href="/dashboardname/pagename">Page Name</a>` which would at least handle page re-orders (though not renames), but it appears the app ignores changes to the pagename in the url so this doesn't work. 

The nice thing about putting this in the sidebar (as opposed to a header widget) is you only only have to configure it once per dashboard.  But AFAIK there's no way to make the sidebar open by default, so it's still not great for discoverability (adding an open-by-default sidebar option would be great). 

Like I said, I'm impressed overall, but it's surprising that a tool that's otherwise so feature-rich would not have solved this already.  Or am I missing something?
Hi,

I am trying to use cyclotron([http://www.cyclotron.io][1]) to work with my database in mongodb.
The configuration settings doc seems to ask for custom mongodb. 

But while creating data source there is no option to select mongodb.

I would like to 
a) Select my database
b) Select collection
c) Set parameters for widgets to know what to plot.

Previously I had a custom stack running nodejs + mongodb + jquery to do the plotting. Wherein nodejs has the business logic as to exchange data based on query send from frontend.
I am looking to replace the whole stack so that with minimum programming plots can be created.

Regards
