Private `dev` parity network.

Adding just deployed erc20 boilerplate. It pulls metadata file from chain, but never adds it:

OSX "desktop app", Version 1.7.4 (1.7.4)
The desktop app just does not provide basic functions. I have launched `devnet` with parity, next I need to add it as a custom network, the default ID is `0x11`, well, there is a conflict with some scammy network and I have to create custom config and change ID so it will not conflict with predefined scammy networks which you decided to make mandatory without a chance to overwrite these junk.

It's a part of problem. Next is that I have deployed boilerplate ERC20 to play with, fine, let's add it to list, I see the metadata have been pulled from chain but after I click `Save` it never getting saved,, never appeared in a list of available tokens. Where to go? What log to watch? It's a fake desktop app where I have no clue how to look at js console.

Let's go to mycrypto and give it a try, oh no way, I have to run node behind ssl proxy which is the most annoying snake oil "security" there. What a point of mandatory SSL there? Nothing private goes in and out.

Seriously consider user experience, it's literally a clusterf* when you need to do something different than sending some junk from wallet and don't waste hours on setup. Meanwhile there are tons of annoying wizard and I see in `beta` it will be impossible to use just private keys to play with wallets. If you seriously care about brainless users please don't screw up the rest of "community" in their favour.

### Description of Issue

I have MyCrypto Desktop set up to use a local geth node as the network. However, even if the geth node is turned off, MyCrypto Desktop is still able to connect to my wallet, sync my balances, etc. How is it doing this if my node is turned off?
