Hi,

since I use your gem, I18n.available_locales return me the full list of the locales that you have defined. For now I only need fr and en. How could get rid of the others?

Thanks
When I share on facebook it works fine showing all the details like Title, Meta description and url of page properly but on LinkedIn I am not able to see Meta Description of page. Below are the meta tags which I have added in <head> section of my page.
```
<meta property="og:title" content="Site Name" />
<meta name="author" content="My Name" />
<meta property="og:locale" content="en_US" />
<meta property="og:url" content="Page URL" />
<meta property="og:site_name" content="SiteName" />
<meta property="og:type" content="article" />
<meta property="og:description" content="my site description with 133 characters"/>
<meta property="og:image" content="public_image_url_path"/>
<meta property="og:image:secure_url" content="public_image_url_path" />
```

and for social share button I have added below line:
`<%= social_share_button_tag("my site description with 133 characters", :url => public_page_url, "data-linkedin-description": "my site description with 133 characters", desc: "my site description with 133 characters", :allow_sites => %w(linkedin), :image => 'public_url_of_image') %>`

**NOTE**
Gem Version : social-share-button (1.2.0)
Rails Version : rails (5.0.7.1)
Ruby Version : ruby-2.5.3

any suggestion? Also when I share on **twitter** description part seems selected in the box, can't it be normal (unselected) ?
Hello,

I have installed the gem ok and get the social share buttons to show, but when I click (in dev environment) nothing happensâ€¦

I get the following error in the console -

`Uncaught ReferenceError: SocialShareButton is not defined at HTMLAnchorElement.onclick (VM7889 62:777) onclick @ VM7889 62:777`

Any help appreciated!
Hello please help me my facebook,twitter,pinterest is working but the email icon is shown when i clicked on it no pop up is open like others and there is no error in the console of the chrome.
Please Help.
The share function as shown in Dev Tools sources:
`
share: function(el) {
var $parent, appkey, desc, ga, get_tumblr_extra, hashtags, img, site, title, tumblr_params, url, via, via_str, whatsapp_app_url;
site = $(el).data('site');
appkey = $(el).data('appkey') || '';
$parent = $(el).parent();
`

Because Google+ will shutdown, shouldn't the option for Google+ be removed?

I would suggest to leave the logic, but remove the rendering for backward compatibility.
All links get rendered looking through the inspector but they are not properly displayed on the screen.

They work fine on Firefox though.
As now we have not only one WhatsApp, but two, one for mobile and one for web. 
We need whatsapp_app and whatsapp_web translations, as we add translated 'title' tag to html based on ["button tag"](https://github.com/huacnlee/social-share-button/blob/master/lib/social_share_button/helper.rb) name.
Which now is whatsapp_app or whatsapp_web, and not whatsapp.
