i get a "We're sorry, but something went wrong." error when I attempt to use the demo of the blog posted on the github repo markdown.

Maybe a link for logging out would be helpful?

Hi @natew,

I cloned the refresh branch and was able to get it up and running, but it's kind of unusable. Number one issue is that everything is hidden, so I was staring at a blank screen, I figured the #sheet div was the culprit, I had to delete the element with Firebug to actually see the user creation modal.

I then checked out the new admin section, I am digging the left sidebar. However, not sure if the UI / styles are fully there.

I was curious what's the progress on finishing up this branch. I see it working nicely on your website. I may be able to help with PRs and fixes, just not sure what your status is :)

This is rather weird thing that is happening with my obtvse install on heroku - Setting Slug and Optional Url in the Post page is missing in the admin backend... I have checked and updated the latest copy...

It works in the development environment on my Laptop, but when I deploy to Heroku - this does not seem to work.. Am i missing anything here..

Just a if statment for checking tagline

Here's an example of the Markdown:

```
Hey guys, I'm making a [blog][wiki_blog] post! Read more after the [jump][wiki_Van_Halen]!
[wiki_Van_Halen]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Halen
<!--more-->
I really like [blogging][wiki_blog]. It's just so fun!

\[wiki_blog]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog
\[wiki_Van_Halen]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Halen
```

Currently, the above example, viewed from the home page, would appear like this (where **bold** represents a link.

> Hey guys, I'm making a [blog][wiki_blog] post! Read more after the [jump](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Halen)!

When viewing the posts own page, everything displays as it's supposed to. I'm hoping to fix this myself when I get more time in a week or so, but I wanted to document it in case anyone got here first (and to remind myself, should I forget!).

Sometimes it's impossible to see the last paragraph or so while editing a post as it runs below the page even on a larger browser. The work around is to pgEnd -> and hit return a bunch of times. However, you then need to remember to trim those trailing carriage returns. I will try to make the height of the editor more dynamic so this doesn't happen.

The routes file (https://github.com/NateW/obtvse/blob/refresh/config/routes.rb#L6) has

```
post '/edit/:id', :to => 'posts#update'
```

But it should be

```
post '/posts', :to => 'posts#create'
```

I installed a fresh clone of the refresh branch and so I had no posts. When I accessed the admin section I got a "undefined method" error. Turns out the posts_controller#new method sets "@post" equal to a post that it looks up or to "Post.first". However, if you have no posts the view fails to render.
