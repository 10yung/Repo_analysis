``` terminal code:
        TERM=xterm-kitty
was not found in the database provided by tcell library. Please try checking if
a supplemental database is found for your terminal at one of the following URLs:
        https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/raw/master/terminfo/database/98/98d2a8a0
        https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/raw/master/terminfo/database/98/98d2a8a0.gz
If yes, download it and save in the following directory:
        $HOME/.tcelldb/98/
then try running "up" again. If that does not work for you, please first consult:
        https://github.com/akavel/up/issues/15
and if you don't see your terminal code mentioned there, please try asking on:
        https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/issues
Or, you might try changing TERM temporarily to some other value, for example by
running "up" with:
        TERM=xterm up
Good luck!```

How to get it to work with `xterm-kitty` ? http://www.9bis.net/kitty/
This is not an issue per se, but I wrote a small `zsh` function to integrate `up`:

```zsh
zle-upify() {
    buf="$(echo "$BUFFER" | sed 's/[ |]*$//')"
    tmp="$(mktemp)"
    eval "$buf |& up --unsafe-full-throttle -o '$tmp' 2>/dev/null"
    cmd="$(tail -n +2 "$tmp")"
    rm -f "$tmp"
    BUFFER="$BUFFER | $cmd"
    zle end-of-line
}
zle -N zle-upify

bindkey '^U' zle-upify
```

If you add this to your `zshrc`, Ctrl+U will run `up` passing the current commands output, and when you exit `up` with `Ctrl+X`, the result will replace current prompt. It's slightly easier than dealing with `upN.sh` files.

It was quite useful for me, I'm just sharing this so maybe you'd like to put it to `README.md` or somewhere people can find out.
The document of tcell (https://godoc.org/github.com/gdamore/tcell#Screen) says as following. 

`SetCell is an older API and will be removed.  Please use SetContent instead`

This PR alters `SetCell` into `SetContent` .

Including the ability to tab complete would make this tool truly perfect.

Great job either way, love this idea!
The new press-enter-to-run mode makes up a lot safer, but it would still be nice to have something like the old mode. Maybe a new mode where the command is automatically run, but only after a configurable amount of time without any input?

Probably still shouldn't be the default, but it would be a nice in-between option.

(Would happily dive in and make a PR to implement this, if you're interested!)
I tried to do some pipelining for comparison.
But when I tried to paste the content of my clipboard to  this tools command prompt, only the first 11 characters got copied to it.

Here's the screencast in case needed.

Write/copy it based on readme + update with features added in subsequent releases.
With short licensing info for all dependency libraries.
The following change allows for up to be called directly without first needing to pipe a command in to it.  It can still be called the normal way through a pipe.
