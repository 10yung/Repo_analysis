This fixes issue #578 
I would like to control an RGBWW lamp with WLED. In the wikis FAQ it says 6 _pins: RGBCT (RGB + 2 white channels)_ is supported. However, when trying to use it by defining `WLED_USE_ANALOG_LEDS`, `WLED_USE_5CH` and apparently also `WLED_USE_H801` it does not work. Apart from a few typos like the [`#define WLED_USE_5CH`](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/blob/cf60eb52d82fff10d67d4e014ba20ba568a85259/wled00/NpbWrapper.h#L12) having to be `#define WLED_USE_5CH_LED` and two instances[ of it saying `colorW` instead of `color`](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/blob/cf60eb52d82fff10d67d4e014ba20ba568a85259/wled00/NpbWrapper.h#L259) it is still not able to control the second white channel. When looking though the code it seems, that the frontend doesn't support 5 channels after all, but even when connecting it to home assistant via the wled integration, the second white channel is unused (The pin stays at 0V). Is this just a mistake in the FAQ and 5 channels are not supported or am I doing something wrong?

Thanks
Hi Aircookie

The 0.9.0-b1 is performing very well here. Very smooth.
I had an idea, because I've now added some LED's to my youngest desk, and as some features are not controllable through the IKEA remote I've given him, he has to have the WLED app installed.
This in itself is not a problem, everybody can just download it, but it is a problem that he (and others) can add our lights to their app, and create chaos for us (if they have access to our Wifi of course).

Thus I would very much like to have a password protection or the like, built in to the code, so that you have to give the password in the app to be allowed to add it.

This will eliminate the problem of him (and others) making funny effects with the other wled's in the house.

My thought was that you could set the password during the initial setup, and then to be able to add it to the app, you would have to enter the password as well.
Hi guys,
I installed 2 Wled NodeMcu (0.8.6) and 2 led strips on my house. Set up automations in HA to work together as in DR Zzss's repo. There are 2 issues:
1 - approx 20 minutes 1 strip (the long one) is turning off without any command from HA. Tried linking this to a specific effect but couldn't find a reason
2 - automation is turning the led show off at 22.00 and in the morning I have few leds in random colors lighten up continuously.

The scheme is:

The picture for 2nd issue.

Please advise where to start debugging and how. HW issue? SW issue? Thank you for your help
Hi

I've been working on a usermod to add Lifx support to WLED : 

https://github.com/stringandstickytape/WLED/tree/LifxSupport

I think it's working pretty-well - but it's probably not quite ready yet for a pull request.  If it's not too cheeky, could you give it a once-over and see if you have any views?  There are fairly extensive notes at the top of wled06 about its capabilities and requirements.

Two particular points of interest (i.e. areas where it might be dubious):

* To allow WLED06 to control individual LEDs, I added a new FX_MODE_USERMOD which does nothing but stop WLED from doing any LED-setting itself.  Is there a better way?

* For Lifx purposes, I divide the strip into eight or 64 "zones" - Lifx requires multiples of eight I believe.  I think this has no overlap with your segments concept and should indeed be implemented separately as it currently is, but frankly I am not certain...?

Views greatly appreciated!
I have a Feature Request I think would be useful, some randomization like a Roll the Dice button and have different and selectable things be randomized.  I Drew and attached a Mock-up ![Mock up](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2946074/72381851-ba549880-36dd-11ea-9e0a-64eeaea0bac6.png)
 of what it could look like.

Since it is so difficult to make up ones mind on which effect / colors to use. It would be great to be able to enable randomness on;

Primary Color
Secondary Color
Tertiary Color
Effect
Palette
Speed
Intensity




My WiFi is quite ordinary **802.11n** - **WPA2-PSK [AES]** protected network with **Netgear r6220** router with the SSID of `Name&Surname_v2` (I'm not sure if the ampersand or underscore could make any difference?).

With version **0.8.6** everything is working perfectly but beta of new 0.9.0 version just fails to connect and fallbacks to AP mode.

Is there any debugging/logging I can do to help you resolve the issue?

For now I just downgraded to the older version which still works just fine but I can just update yet again to make any further tests if required :)

Already tried clearing entire EEPROM, no success.

Fixes the WS2801 Color Order
I've flash with 
WLED_0.9.0-b1_ESP8266_1M_full.bin
WLED_0.8.6_ESP01_1m_full.bin

Everything works until it connect to my wifi I get this message

Hi, first of all thanks for this great project!

In the software I used before I hacked a little feature which allows to display a color/effect/preset temporarily by passing an additional duration argument. This way the color/effect was displayed the specified amount of time and after that the previous state was restored. 
This would be a nice feature to have on WLED as well...
I use this for notifications to eg. blink a strip for 10 seconds.
