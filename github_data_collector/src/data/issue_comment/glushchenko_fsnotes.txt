**Describe your feature request**
We have a Todo section in the upper left of the app that can display all the notes with todo toggled. 

However, it doesn't ignore those notes with all the toggled todo checked. I could have notes with toggled todo all checked still displayed in the Todo section.

Showing only the unchecked tasks in the Todo section should make it more useful.

**Additional context**
This is a behavior found in both MacOS and iOS versions of Fsnotes.

MacOS: 10.14.6, fsnotes 4.0.12 (344)
iOS 13.3, fsnotes 3.1.5 build 155

**Describe your feature request**
Fsnotes in iOS allows me to change the editor font family. However, I don't able to find the option to change font size.

Currently there is no section jumping through a "table of content", and I would like to change the font to be smaller to help navigating a longer note.

Font sizing is discussed in https://github.com/glushchenko/fsnotes/issues/377, and I suppose this setting should have already added. I wonder am I missing something?

**Additional context**
iOS 13.3, fsnotes 3.1.5 build 155

If I understand current FSNotes behaviour correctly, if the user wants a new note to be sorted immediately, they have to click the relevant 'sort by' submenu item. They then have to click it again to have the notes list sorted in the previously selected order (i.e. ascending or descending).

Would it be possible for FSNotes to auto-sort notes on a timed basis, set in preferences: in other words the app would auto-sort the note list after x number of seconds? 

Another half solution would be to have a menu item to force the sorting the notes list, so the user doesn’t have to go to the menu twice to sort.

When you click on the "Notes" position, I’d like to see all the tags.

**Describe your feature request**
Currently, when turning on the automatic backup, the backup is performed once a day at "HOUR:MINUTES" (even though the text implies a different behavior). I think it would be useful if instead of giving a time on a day, a frequency could be provided as well, something like "backup all notes every full hour".
**Describe the bug**
Hi there - I’ve just started using the iOS app & it’s looking good so far. The only issue I’ve found is that the first character of a new bulleted line doesn’t start with a capitalised letter. This is a small thing but I use bulleted outlines heavily so it would make a big difference for me.

Thanks for considering this and thank you for all of your work on the app.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Type * followed by some content - this sets up a bulleted line
2. Type enter - this will create a new bulleted line
3. Type "a"

**Expected behavior**
The first character typed should be capitalised i.e. "A"

**Actual behavior**
The first character typed is not capitalised i.e. "a"

I'd love to see an option when right clicking on a code block to copy the entire code block

**Additional context**
I have some large code blocks and rather than selecting the entire code block every time I need to copy it I'd love to see an option to simply right click and copy the entire code block.

This regards the markdown preview.
Parsing of a combination of checkboxes and bullet lists does not seem to work properly.

**To Reproduce**

Here are four inputs that produce unexpected results. All are missing bullet points. Once there is an empty line between those two lists (input 3 & 4) it starts breaking the checkboxes too...

Input 1:
```
- some
- here
- [ ] checkbox1
- [ ] checkbox2
```
Output 1:

Input 2:
```
- [ ] checkbox1
- [ ] checkbox2
- some
- here
```
Output 2:

Input 3 :
```
- some
- here

- [ ] checkbox1
- [ ] checkbox2
```
Output 3:

**Describe your feature request**
Not sure if this should be a bug report or a feature request. However, any indented item (whether bullet list or something else) should also indent any subsequent lines.

Here is an example. the `JHFS` should be indented to the same x position as the \``diskutil`

**Additional context**
Using macOS version 4.0.12.

**Describe the bug**
Formatting precedence is not respected. Asterisk inside code block should not be evaluated.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create new note and paste:
```
```ls ${*}``` this shouldn't be italic `ls ${*}`
```

**Expected behavior**
The text in between should not be italic but it is.

**Actual behavior**
As described. Text shouldn't be italic. Here is the Github output with the exact same input:

```ls ${*}``` this shouldn't be italic `ls ${*}`
