Needs to be updated in profile settings and user registration.
Atm the notice about an old thread is a little crammed in between the ad and last reply. Maybe we can improve this.

As a user, I should gain experience points when creating threads, replying to threads, having my solution marked as accepted, etc so that I get recognition from the community for my input.
As a user, I should have an easy way to get to the accepted reply so that I can quickly find the most likely solution to my issue.
Would be cool if we could leverage Algolia to search for threads, replies and users. 

I think we qualify for an open source plan since the source code is open source.
Create a unique index and filter out any duplicates.
There's already a wip for this at #290. We can make use of the DB implementation to save notifications. Couple this to events and start with the reply notifications.
We should have a better way of optionally informing people who get banned or have their threads or replies removed. This way they'll have a reason and not just see their content disappear. We can probably add a textarea field to the delete & ban modal for this.
