Hi, 

A lot of altcoins can be traded using USD or USDt. Due to the fact nowadays bitcoins behavior is a little bit crazy, I was thinking about try this algorithm with another's altcoins (pair USD/Altcoin). Have you already tried? Is there some necessary modification on code or just put data in the standard cvs partner used in code?

Best regards!
