I'm a bit confused with so many different UMD templates.

What if I want to build a javascript library, which can be used by itself, or together with a jQuery adaptor, and I also want it to be compatible with AMD and commonJS?

In that case, which of the UMD templates is the appropriate one?
Provided UMD templates follow assumption that module "definedInTemplate" is dependent on module "b".

But how should  UMD-compliant systems look like when module "definedInTemplate" is dependent on a FEW modules like "a", "b", "c"?

Or how to express in UMD-compliant way a case where module "definedInTemplate" is not dependent on any modules at all?

Also, regarding template for jQuery plugin - what if that plugin dependent not only on JQuery but on, for example, root, or other modules? Do you provide those in order of factory(jQuery, root, a, b, c); or as factory(a, b, c, root, jQuery);
Would it make sense for umd to support es6 module exports?

Though one practical issue is that there is no good es6 module feature detection as of now to my knowledge.





The project [Brace_umd](https://github.com/restarian/brace_umd) should be listed in the README as it explains how to develop standardized methods using the UMD design in ecma modules.
