First, off: Thanks for this great tool! It's very useful.

I have a feature request for you to consider: The current guppy basecaller has an option called '--calib_detect'. When engaged, this will detect reads that match the pre-loaded calibration strands (some lambda DNA I believe), and create several additional columns of information in the sequencing_summary.txt file. Calibration strand reads seem to be around 3.5kb in length. One great addition to your script could be one more summary plots describing the reads that were tagged as calibration strands, especially their estimated accuracy.

Cheers,
Mike Axtell

Hi All,

I'm wondering if you can help me. I am trying to run my barcode_summary.txt file generated from demux'ing with Guppy. Any ideas why it failed? Or maybe I cant use this file and I didn't notice in the literature.

Cheers,

Peter

Hello Rob,

I am having some problems with the program when it gets to the combining point - individually everything works very smoothly with all the relevant files produced!

INFO [2018-12-19 09:56:47] **** Analysing data from all flowcells combined ****
Error in rbindlist(results) : 
  Item 1 of list input is not a data.frame, data.table or list
Calls: as.data.frame -> rbindlist

Do you know what the issue might be? It is looking at 11 promethion flow cells... so quite a large data set.

Thanks!

Hi, I am [working on including support](https://github.com/ManavalanG/MultiQC) for MinIONQC in [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/), which is a fantastic results aggregator. So far, I have added results using `summary.yaml`; see this html file for its current state - [multiqc_report.html.zip](https://github.com/roblanf/minion_qc/files/2476125/multiqc_report.html.zip). Your feedback is welcome.

But what would be truly useful is including plots below, as this would enable easier comparison of plots across samples.
* yield_over_time
* q_by_hour
* reads_per_hour
* length_by_hour

This would require raw data output for above plots from MinIONQC. It would be great if you could enable writing relevant plot raw data as output (as csv, json, etc). 

PS:
If you would like to try my dev version of MultiQC, follow these steps:
1. git clone/download the repo
2. `cd MultiQC`
3. `python setup.py develop`
4. `multiqc <dir_with_minionqc_results>`
5. open `multiqc_report.html`



Hi, 
I'm try to run the script just on example data as followed:
Rscript MinIONQC.R  -i example_input -o ./ -p 2
(The version of my R is 3.4.3)

But it is not successful, and i got some error information as followed:

Could you please tell me what's the problem, and how can i fix this?
Thank so much!
Sincerely.
Is minKnow summary output file(s) supported by minion_qc? It appears they are incompatible, but I wonder if I can make it work with a bit of data manipulation. I looked up the headers in `sequencing_summary.txt` from your example data and minKnow's output, and there are some discrepancies besides column order. In particular, columns `passes_filtering` and `num_called_template` are missing from minKnow data. Can they be made compatible without too much of work?

```
# from example file
filename	read_id	run_id	channel	start_time	duration	num_events	passes_filtering	template_start	num_events_template	template_duration	num_called_template	sequence_length_template	mean_qscore_template	strand_score_template

# minknow file
filename	read_id	run_id	channel	start_time	duration	num_events	template_start	num_events_template	template_duration	sequence_length_template	mean_qscore_templatestrand_score_template	median_template	mad_template
```


Hi,

I'm trying to run MinIONQC.R on some nanopore data I basecalled using albacore (with and without the --barcoding option.  The script runs and creates some of the plots and then falls over with the following error:

Hi,
   I am trying to use minion_qc for the quality of check of base-calling data from Albacore. However, I didnot get figure results from this (only summary.yaml).
$ Rscript /home/wyzhang/opt/biosoftware/ONT_Analysis_Tools/minion_qc/MinionQC.R -i ./sequencing_summary.txt -o my_example_output

Can you help to take a look at what is going wrong there?

I ran minion_qc on 2 promethion runs (I know - it's named **minion**_qc) and got incomplete results in the summary.yaml, reporting approx only 10% of the reads.
I did not get any error messages and the sequencing_summary.txt file is complete.

On previous minion runs there were no problems.
Any clue?
E.g. lines for N50, mean, median.
