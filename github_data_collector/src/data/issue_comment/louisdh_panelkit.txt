Is it possible to provide a spacing between the added panels and/or the main view (i.e. panelContentView)?
Is it possible to pin a panel programmatically? 
This is what I got from running the Xcode migrator.
I added a showcase. Thanks for this awesome library.
Hello first of all thanks for this project. I am trying to integrate this into my Objective C project using swift extensions as you mentioned in some other issue. But Panel Delegate is not being called.


here is the method I am calling in my Objective C class
    

    self.webBroserVc.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationPopover;
    UIPopoverPresentationController * popoverVc = self.webBroserVc.popoverPresentationController;
    popoverVc.sourceView = self.browserButton;
    popoverVc.sourceRect = CGRectMake(self.browserButton.bounds.size.width/2, self.browserButton.bounds.size.height/2, 0, 0);
    //popoverVc.preferredContentSize = CGSizeMake(250, 250);
    [self presentViewController:self.webBroserVc animated:YES completion:nil];


Now I am using an extension to call the Panel Kit methods for PanelManager and PanelControlDelegate



    extension CanvasViewController : PanelManager{

    public var panels: [PanelViewController] {
        let mapPanelVC = PanelViewController(with: self.webBroserVc, in: self)
        return [mapPanelVC]
    }
    
    public var panelContentWrapperView: UIView {
        return self.view
    }
    
    public var panelContentView: UIView {
        return scrollViewContainer
    }
   }
   extension WebBrowserViewController : PanelContentDelegate {
    public var preferredPanelContentSize: CGSize {
        return CGSize(width: 320, height: 500)
    }
    
    public var maximumPanelContentSize: CGSize {
        return CGSize(width: 512, height: 600)
    }
    
    public var preferredPanelPinnedWidth: CGFloat {
        return 500
    }


But the PanelContentDelegate is not being called, can you please tell me what I am doing wrong @louisdh 


Is there any way of executing code when a panel closes? I tried overriding different methods I can see in the open source code, but most are in extensions and so not overridable. I tried overriding `viewWillDisappear`, which gets called every time a panel pins/floats/unpins. I also tried adding a custom done button, however that one got removed and replaced with the PanelKit one. 

Is there a way to run code when the close button gets pressed, or could you add that functionality?
I have a view and I want to switch between form sheet or half screen view and on a button tap or on resize handler press I want to present it as Full screen view controller.

Is it possible ?
It would be great if it were possible to have tabs, like in Goodnotes or Safari

They would be created when dragging a panel over a non-floating panel. I guess they'd be in a bar below the Navigation bar, or maybe the Navigation bar could be split if it were only two or so (?). A tab could then be grabbed and pulled back out to a floating panel. Maybe even a panel with multiple tabs could be dragged. Kind of the way that windows behave now on MacOS, when having the native tabs. (TextMate is a great example for that)

I triggered a crash in OpenTerm while trying to dock a panel to the side.

I believe this is caused by `PanelManager+AutoLayout`:`updateFrame(for:to:keyboardShown)` dividing by zero. Not sure the circumstances that caused this, or if this is something misconfigured in OpenTerm, but there should be a check to handle this case in PanelKit.

Crash is below:
