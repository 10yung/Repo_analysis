Hi , I want to change the bordercolor to whiteColor ,but it dosent work , and still show with tintcolor ! How can I solve it?
`Dependency "UAProgressView" has no shared framework schemes for any of the platforms: iOS`

Cartfile: `github "UrbanApps/UAProgressView" ~> 0.1.4`

Works for me, wanted to get it online for other people to review.

I made a version which allows two different colors. Is there any interest here for that?

Would it be possible to expose a "tap and hold" gesture on this view?  I would like to perform some actions when the touches are held for a specified amount of seconds.

Hello,

I am trying to use this component as its more flexible than other referred as per my requirement.

Is there a possible to have an intermediate rotating circle while the transfer is yet to be started to download / upload.

Nice project!

I am integrating UAProgressView in my project written in swift. I tried to update the value of the current progress as follows:

```
override func awakeFromNib() {
    super.awakeFromNib()
    self.progressView.borderWidth = 2.0
    self.progressView.lineWidth = 8.0
    self.progressView.fillOnTouch = false
    self.progressView.animationDuration = 2.0

    self.textLabel = UILabel(frame: CGRectMake(0, 0, 60.0, 32.0))
    self.textLabel.font = UIFont(name: "HelveticaNeue-UltraLight", size: 22)
    self.textLabel.textAlignment = NSTextAlignment.Center
    self.textLabel.textColor = self.progressView.tintColor
    self.textLabel.backgroundColor = UIColor.clearColor()
    self.progressView.centralView = self.textLabel



    self.progressView.progressChangedBlock = { (progressView:UAProgressView!,  progress:Float) -> () in
        let lableview = progressView.centralView as! UILabel
        lableview.text = StringManager.float2str(progress*100)
        println("Current progress")
        println(progress)
    }  
} 
```

But the block is invoked only once as in the main code:

self.scoreshareview.setViewProgress(StringManager.str2float(score))

function setViewProgress:

```
func setViewProgress(score:Float){
    self.progressView.setProgress(score/100, animated: true)
}
```

I am new to iOS and not sure where the problem is.

Thanks for sharing!
