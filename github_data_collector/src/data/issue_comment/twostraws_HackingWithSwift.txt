How to reproduce:

1. Create a new project in Xcode 11.1
2. Follow the instructions in project 25 (you can also just copy the ViewController.swift file from this repo).
3. Run the app on two devices and try to join a session. It won't ever connect.

Now, if you delete SceneDelegate.swift, remove the two UISceneSession lifecycle methods in AppDelegate.swift and then remove the scene related dictionary item in Info.plist and re-run the apps, you'll see it works as expected.
The following code does not work in new project created in Xcode 11.1 due to the changes to SceneKit.

```
if let tabBarController = window?.rootViewController as? UITabBarController {
    let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)
    let vc = storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "NavController")
    vc.tabBarItem = UITabBarItem(tabBarSystemItem: .topRated, tag: 1)
    tabBarController.viewControllers?.append(vc)
}
```

I was able to get it working by doing the following in a new project:

1. Delete `SceneDelegate.swift`
2. Delete `Application Scene Manifest` in `Info.plist`
3. In `AppDelegate.swift`, do the following:
    1. Add `var window: UIWindow?`
    2. Delete `application(_ :, configurationForConnecting:, options:)` and `application(_:, sceneSessions:)`
