Although it's quite slow to compress images with gruetzli it usually gives best compression ratio at a quality of 85. See https://github.com/google/guetzli
Hey @toy, I am not sure if you have seen it, but 

OxiPng is a rewrite of OptiPNG that supports multithreading and written in a safer language (rust) https://crates.rs/crates/oxipng

I do not know if they are 1-to-1 compatible, but maybe it would be worth looking into, their benchmarks looks promising. 
an option to keep tags and comments when optimizing, so that only image data is optimized

I had an idea to save extended attributes files on the file system so that when the next task on a large directory is recognized from files that have already been optimized, the attribute can store a `hash` or `bitmask` of the metadata file attributes of the leading optimization pass of the `image_optim` utility.

    getextattr, lsextattr, rmextattr, setextattr
    # macOS
    xattr

Please add support for ffmpeg or ImageMagick/ImageMagick conversion of animated GIFs to the more space efficient WEBM, MP4 or Both

while i would like the application to create both and keep the smaller or the results some people might prefer one or the other of the formats or both if trying to cover all bases for a website

i have seen 1.5mb files shrink to less then 50k so savings can be significant

some people might not want to convert animated GIFs so having it disabled by default would be fine
Add support for `lossy` option on `giflossy`.

[giflossy](https://github.com/kornelski/giflossy) is a fork of gifsicle which support lossy compression.



I installed `image_optim` on my Raspberry and find that I can't use `image_optim` because of an encoding error that sadly comes without any stacktrace. I remembered that Ruby had some encoding issues in older versions (?1.9?), so I made sure that I have `ruby2.2` installed; I removed the existing `image_optim` and re-installed with `sudo gem2.2 install image_optim_pack image_optim`. But the error still persists:

```
flow@raspi:/tmp/kb-test$ image_optim dont-touch-me.jpg 
invalid byte sequence in UTF-8
```

That's all I get as output, except there's now a mysteriously-named file in the directory:

```
flow@raspi:/tmp/kb-test$ ls -AlF
total 188
-rw-rw-r-- 1 flow flow     0 Jul 25 15:32 ??5@@???@8
...
```

The questionmarks are really replacement characters; using my Linux Mint file browser over `sshfs` I can see that the first byte is `0x01`, and the one right before the second `@` is `0x04`. 

The weird thing is that I can install and run `image_optim` on my Linux Mint box without errors, so the error should be caused by a difference between the two systems, not `image_optim` per se. 

Here's what `uname -a` gives me:

```
Linux raspi 4.1.15-v7+ #830 SMP Tue Dec 15 17:02:45 GMT 2015 armv7l armv7l armv7l GNU/Linux
```

How can I proceed from here?

hi,
when I use image_optim_pack, no problem, but when I want to use system gifsicle (ubuntu), i have this error : "Failed to manipulate with rmagick, maybe it is not an image?"
I tried with default ubuntu version (1.78) and then with version I installed muself (1.83 and 1.89) but still same problem. I tried by installing it to /usr/local/bin first and then /usr/bin

I could use image_optim_pack but I notice a lot of random other issues on jpg and pnd (i could not reproduice, but users of my website told me)
Last week I was still using image_optimizer gem and I didnt have any problem with system gifsicle

any idea ?

thank

Hello,

This is my take at implementing support for [Guetzli](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/03/announcing-guetzli-new-open-source-jpeg.html).

At this time there are a few compatibility issues that come with it:

- [x] It has no support in the `image_optim_pack` yet.
- [x] It depends on [gflags](https://github.com/gflags/gflags/) which requires a version of CMake that is unavailable in Ubuntu 12.04 (Travis CI runs 12.04 by default). (Dependency removed upstream https://github.com/google/guetzli/pull/97)
- [x] It fails to link on OS X Yosemite. (But this has been fixed upstream https://github.com/google/guetzli/issues/41, https://github.com/google/guetzli/pull/55).
- [ ] I have not tested it at all on Windows.
- [ ] I have not tested it at all on *BSD.
