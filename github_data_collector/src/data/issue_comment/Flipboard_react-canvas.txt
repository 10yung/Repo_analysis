I'm not has success in run the command "npm i react-canvas", due to an error on one dependency.
bellow are the errors. 

I realize that the path is different at your project. "github.com/popham/scroller"

npm install react-canvas

I wrote one based on the official example, and the following error occurred:

I don't know where to start when I see this kind of mistake.

Hi,
How is it possible to rotate figures like Line or Rect? I used the feature described [there](https://konvajs.github.io/docs/animations/Rotation.html) but unfortunately I don't know where to put in a react component lifecycle. Because in order to apply the rotation, I need to get access to the figure and so call it after a `render `call.

I tried in `componentDidMount` but it doesn't apply the rotation to the figures that are displayed later in the lifecycle of the component. I also tried in `componentDidUpdate` but this time, it is applied every time the component is updated so my line rotates a full circle.


`

         <Surface top={0} left={0}  width={size.width} height={size.height} enableCSSLayout={true}>    
    
            <Image style={this.getImageStyle()} src={iconUrl}/>  
  
            <Text style={this.getTextStyle()}>Text</Text>    

         </Surface>
`

**the right position is at the top border , but I have two boder in the canvas, and the icon is at the secoend**

Could you please specify in the Readme if its not being maintained? May help many coming here!

Yarn refuses to install this package as it has a git repo as a dependency due to it not having a hash. Can it be removed and turned into a reference to the npm repository, or it still necessary to keep it?

This is the dep: `git://github.com/mjohnston/scroller`

And this is the error log from `yarn add react-canvas`:

```
yarn add v0.27.5

error Refusing to download the git repo {"hostname":"github.com","protocol":"git:","repository":"git://github.com/mjohnston/scroller.git"} over plain git without a commit hash
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/add for documentation about this command.
```

This is caused by a long-standing issue in yarn: https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2117, and a quick fix might be to specify the commit hash to use.
