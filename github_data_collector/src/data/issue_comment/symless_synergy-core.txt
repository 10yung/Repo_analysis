After this [commit](https://github.com/symless/synergy-core/commit/688095d0a7d22704b5c3282bc68b41ceca42ab7e) was added to the master branch, building synergy no longer builds the tests.

Is this an intentional change? If so, how do I build the tests?
### Operating Systems ###

Server: Windows 8.1
Client: Windows 7 Professional

### Synergy Version ###

1.11.0-stable-b2173efb

### Steps to Reproduce ###

1. Start Synergy 1
2. Edit -> Settings
3. Check or Uncheck Enable Auto Config
4. Ok

The state synergy is in will remain unchanged until you close and reopen synergy. If auto config was disabled before opening settings, you will still receive the warning that auto config is disabled despite enabling the option `Enable Auto Config` and pressing Ok. The reverse is also true. If you open synergy with auto config on, then you repeat the steps above, then you will notice synergy does not warn you that auto config is off, despite you just turning it off.

Whether this is intended or not, it is counter intuitive because it gives the user the impression that changes may or may not have been applied after changing the options. If the options are only addressed upon the program starting up, then that is a large hinderence to its usability.

>Printscreen sends Alt+Printscreen to Windows clients (#4288). Previous patch (#4290) only removes the alt+printscreen scancode from being mapped to VK_SNAPSHOT AFAIK. This patch adds send_keyboard_input and send_mouse_input to replace keybd_event and mouse_event but are functionally the same other than the ability for send_keyboard_input to send virtual-keys and scancodes so Windows can produce certain key-combos (like alt+printscreen). There's still a bit of special handling for Alt+Printscreen so the correct key up/down scancodes are sent but everything appears to work.

I lost the original commit author details during the cherry-pick, But the source of this change belongs to @yupi2

I also Removed a couple #if 0 blocks as otherwise they will never be removed and will linger haunting us for eternity.

This was a good catch and should defiantly be merged

I try to copy something like an article in mix of text and images. There is no image, English text becomes Chinese. 
I'm using Linux as Server, Windows as Client. I copied text from Server to Client. The text is from Udacity.com , the end page is OneNote or Word . English becomes Chinese. I can fix this by pasting with 'Keep Text Only'. It is be nice if the Synergy fixes this. 
### Operating Systems ###

Server: Windows 10 Pro
Client: MacOS 10.15.2

### Synergy Version ###

1.11.0-stable-b2173efb

### Steps to Reproduce ###

1. Configure server with TLS
2. Connect with client
3. On the client, get prompted to match the fingerprint in a dialog to that on the server

Expected: Fingerprints to match
Actual: Fingerprints do not match

### Extra Info ###

Appears to be due to different fingerprinting algorithms being used: The server interface displaying the SHA256 fingerprint, while the verification on the client showing the SHA1... which will never match, being different lengths... generating the SHA1 fingerprint _did_ appear to checkout, with (on the server), something like:
```
> OpenSSL x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in "%APPDATA%\..\Local\Synergy\SSL\Synergy.pem"
> OpenSSL x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1 -inform pem -in "%APPDATA%\..\Local\Synergy\SSL\Synergy.pem"
```
... the first matching that provided in the server interface, the second matching that in the verification dialog on the client.


I just compiled Synergy on Windows 10, and got everything working, but there was one last step that wasn't specified on the wiki page. Getting the project compiled, and copying everything worked find, but once I ran it for the first time, I kept getting the following message in the log:

```log
ERROR: ipc connection error, connection refused
```
After a little bit of digging, I noticed the service was not even showing up. After a brief look into the code, I noticed I could run an install command on `synergyd`. After starting an admin command prompt and running `synergyd /install`, the error messages went away and everything worked fine.

Perhaps there should be a little addition to compiling for Windows or a setup section that specifies how the service should be installed.
