With this applied the color `brightred` is used for both the active window (bottom left corner) and the active pane index (`0` in the center).

Non of the files have an option like
`setw -g window-style bg=white,fg=black`
Thus, nothing set the colors of the windows.
`status-attr`, `window-status-fg`, `window-status-bg`, `window-status-current-fg`, `window-status-current-bg`, `pane-border-fg`, `pane-active-border-fg`, `message-bg` and `message-fg` have been removed from tmux.

First of all thank the author for providing us with such a good plug-in for tmux!
and I found a problem about the tmux config file "unknown option:window-status-bell-style"
so I exec the command man tmux ,and found as follows:

```
       -  window-status-bell-attr attributes
                 Set status line attributes for windows which have a bell
                 alert.

        -  window-status-bell-bg colour
                 Set status line background colour for windows with a bell
                 alert.

         - window-status-bell-fg colour
                 Set status line foreground colour for windows with a bell
                 alert.
```

so we can solve the problem via changing the option 

all other colors are set except the background color

I am new to Mac and tmux. Please be gentle :)

I am using Mac, iterm2. I double checked my config file and also made sure tmux is using the config file. Can you please help me with this? What do you suggest me to debug ? Please let me know if you need more info to fix this.

Thanks,
