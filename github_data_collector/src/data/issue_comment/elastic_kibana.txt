## Summary

We introduced nested fields support in 7.6, but nested fields show up across different Kibana apps, since they are now marked as `aggregatable` in the index pattern, but won't work there, and just create nasty error messages and invalid requests. This PR filters out nested fields via an `isNestedField` utility function in the data plugin, across those apps.

**At all reviewers**: if you think about a place where you have the feeling it would make sense that those fields are also filtered out, please leave a comment. I tried my best testing several places and filtering them out in all those places, they don't work (which are most of them).

Removing PO and cleaning func tests config from code search data, since the plugin is no longer in repo
**Describe the feature:**
Support multiple threshold lines on bar/line/area charts

**Describe a specific use case for the feature:**
There are occasion you may need multiple threshold lines, say upper and lower limits.
Previously, this was being done within the `/internal/security/api_key/privileges` route by checking the error that was throw by trying to get all API keys. @nchaulet requested that we expose this functionality, and @legrego brought up using the `_xpack/usage` API to make this determination. The rest is history ðŸ“–

- handle fields of type `alias`.  fields of type alias have a field.path attr.  before flattening and transforming, the field being aliased's contents need to be copied over to the alias field by searching through all the fields
- update flattenFields to search for the alias' path and copy contents of aliased field over
- add getField() function for searching by alias path
- update tests to loop through assertions
On master (8.0) the "script fields" link in the screenshot below goes to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/search-request-script-fields.html, which is a 404.

Looks like this page is live for 6.x (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/search-request-script-fields.html) and has redirect content for 7.5 (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/search-request-script-fields.html).
Move camemra logic to `useCamera`. No change to functionality at all.

With a short timespan range of 10s as originally here we can miss data in the case of long refresh intervals in ES or other delays in data coming from heartbeat to ES. If data is more than 10s stale we show empty screens. Expanding this to 5m provides most of the performance benefits and also quite a bit of safety in terms of delays. It lets users query very large timespans (say a year), and still only really query 5m of data, keeping the general purpose of this perf enhancement going. 

Fixes https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/55249

Adding tests here isn't strictly necessary IMHO since we're changing a constant value more than functionality.
The screenshot below can be seen when data is slow to ingest with 7.6+ data. The cause is an overly optimistic window for our timespan optimization in QueryContext. We should expand that from 10s to 5m to be safe. This was introduced in https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/54352
