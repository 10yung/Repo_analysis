Just a small mistake in MSVC compiler name. Not great, not terrible.

There will finally be an official Fortran compiler that uses LLVM, coming with LLVM 10.
https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=LLVM-10.0-FLANG-Next-Week
Note that this is not the old FLANG project that has been floating around for a while, but a project previously called "f18" getting renamed and merged as FLANG.
Sentry is making the ci builds appear as if they failed but the only "bad" section turns out to be the new release registration stuff. 
Putting an `AWS` magic compiler name in the compiler list breaks in the client with a missing `compiler.disabledFilters` (patched up elsewhere).

Either kill the AWS support, or fix.
There are compilers that name/output things dependent on the source file names.  It looks like MSVC's lambda names are changing in this way so I believe the file names change each time it compiles.  If they stayed the same upon refresh (or across computers/people) then it can more deterministic and cause less confusion?
Seems like that's what happens here - if "position" in getLabelAtPosition is out of range, then we get an `undefined` `asmLine` and blow up.
