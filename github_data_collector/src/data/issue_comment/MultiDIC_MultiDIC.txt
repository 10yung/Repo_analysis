Dear,

We want to know about limitations of Multi DIC on speckle patterns.  Is  it necessary to create very organised speckle pattern (columns and rows xyz) to use Multi DIC? can we use Multi DIC with sprayed speckle patterns?

We are working with scapholunate ligament (wrist) with size of 10 mm (length) x 3 mm (width) and 2-5 mm (height).

Regards,
Nataliya
Hi Dana,
The toolbox you designed is very useful, but I have some questions to ask you
1. How to modify step 1 after the stereo calibration object is changed to the checkerboardÔºõ
2. Whether the speckle map can be manually used, such as drawing black spots randomly on the white paper with a black pen and sticking them on the measured object; Do I have to use speckle? Is there an alternative?

3.Why does the displacement formed in step2 have no practical significance? What is the specific result of step2? Where to find the result file and what it means?
4. From 2d-dic to 3d-dic, is the triangulation principle applied? Is it possible to measure one more displacement in the z direction? Is it possible to get the coordinates of the pixel in the three-dimensional space and draw the motion track of the object in the three-dimensional space coordinates?
thanksÔºå

It said in the maual that if you choose to stitch, you will be asked to select the indices of the surfaces you want to stitch together. I am confused with the indices of the surfaces. I want to know what is the indices of the surfaces, and  what should I type in. Set the sample as an example, should I type in [201 202] or just the number of the surfaces. 
Hi Dana,
I have been facing issues for the last few weeks as I am not able to get the correct displacement as I should get. I am getting the right result with step 2, i.e. I have given 2D displacement to my object, and step 2 is working fine but after 3D reconstruction displacement values that I am getting is not correct. Can you please suggest what could be possible reasons for it. 

Thank You

Hello Dana,

I've been having some troubles understanding how the principal stretch are plotted, and how those relate to the principal strains. Below is a picture of a specimen (shown on the tension side) being curved. How are the stretch lines plotted? I thought it might be from the [U,V,W] vector, but that doesn't make sense for the "2nd Principal Stretch" image. Also, the strains that I get from the 1st principal stretch is negative. Unless your sign convention is positive equals compression, I don't understand why the results show negative strains when the specimen is stretched horizontally from the curvature. 

Please do advice! Thank you in advance!

Best, Vivian

Hi,I hava already used other calibrate method to get the DLT parameters(fx,fy,fs,cx,cy..) ,how can I use theses parameters to compute the 3D-strain of the pictures.
I seem to have an issue with step 2. I can load in the images, but don't seems to be able to get further when it asks me to press enter on the image. It just seems to do nothing. 
Hi, Dana
   First of all, I am very grateful for the toolbox you provided. It seems very attractive.But when I try to run the toolbox using the provided sample_data, I have a few doubts,could you do me a favor and answer my doubts:
  1 where is the exact position and orientation of the world coordinate system of step4 results? is the Cylinder bottom  the X-Y plane?  then where is the X axisÔºü
  2 If  step0 is skipped, can step 1 determine both  internal parameters(focal length etc)external parameters?
 3 When I look the step4 results, I found that the number of points3D is 4864 and the faces is 9614. I don't understand how this is going on? Do the points3D mean the center of the subset? what about the faces results?
 I will look forward to your reply.thanks you in advanceÔºÅ

Hi Dana,

How can i write a calibrationObjectCoordinates.mat file with the true 3D world coordinates of the calibration object? I don't understand what information should i write in [ùë•ùë¶ùëß]. Can you give me an example?

Thank you in advance.

Hi Dana:
What's the format of displacements data generated in step2? I want to draw a vector diagram using displacements generated in Ncorr (because it has only u and v displacement) but can't understand how do data saved in the file.
Yours,
Joe
