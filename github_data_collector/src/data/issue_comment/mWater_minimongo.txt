<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [lodash's releases](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/releases).*

> ## 4.0.0
> # [lodash v4.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400)
> 
> 2015 was big year! [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) became the [most depended on](https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491#file-01-most-dependent-upon-md) npm package, passed [1 billion](http://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=&author=jdalton) downloads, & its v3 release saw massive adoption!
> 
> The year was also one of collaboration, as discussions began on [merging Lodash & Underscore](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/underdash/underdash/issues/14). Much of Lodash v4 is proofing out the ideas from those discussions. Lodash v4 **would not be possible** without the collaboration & contributions of the Underscore core team. In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with [several members](https://github.com/orgs/lodash/people) contributing to both libraries.
> 
> For 2016 & [lodash v4.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400) we wanted to cut loose, push forward, & take things up a notch!
> 
> ## Modern only
> 
> With v4 weâ€™re breaking free from [old projects](https://github.com/lodash-archive), old environments, & dropping [old IE < 9 support](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support)!
> 
> ## 4 kB Core
> 
> Lodashâ€™s kitchen-sink size will continue to grow as new methods & functionality are added. However, we now offer a 4 kB (gzipped) [core build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0/dist) thatâ€™s compatible with [Backbone v1.2.4](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/3839) for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink.
> 
> ## More ES6
> 
> Weâ€™ve continued to embrace ES6 with methods like [_.isSymbol](https://lodash.com/docs#isSymbol), added support for cloning & comparing array buffers, maps, sets, & symbols, converting iterators to arrays, & iterable `_(â€¦)`.
> 
> In addition, weâ€™ve published an [es-build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0-es/) & pulled [babel-plugin-lodash](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash) into core to make tree-shaking a breeze.
> 
> ## More Modular
> 
> Pop quiz! ðŸ“£
> 
> What category path does the `bindAll` method belong to? Is it 
> 
> A) `require('lodash/function/bindAll')`
> B) `require('lodash/utility/bindAll')`
> C) `require('lodash/util/bindAll')`
> 
> Donâ€™t know? Well, with v4 it doesnâ€™t matter because now module paths are as simple as
> 
> ``` js
> var bindAll = require('lodash/bindAll');
> ```
> 
> Weâ€™ve also reduced module complexity making it easier to create smaller bundles. This has helped Lodash adoption with libraries like [Async](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/caolan/async/pull/996) & [Redux](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rackt/redux/pull/611)!
> 
> ## 1st Class FP
> 
> With v3 we introduced [lodash-fp](https://github.com/lodash-archive/lodash-fp). We learned a lot & with v4 we decided to [pull it into core](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide).
> 
> Now you can get immutable, auto-curried, iteratee-first, data-last methods as simply as
> 
> ``` js
> var _ = require('lodash/fp');
> var object = { 'a': 1 };

Common feature with less-than-simple work-arounds.
I want to use Minimongo.

Exposing remoteURL and connectionID on the client seems to be a security problem.

So it's hard to use it as a security issue.


Has anyone solved RemoteDB security problems?


I want you to let me know if you have a good idea ...
Use cargo to accumulate ops to pass to heavyweight collections.
I believe it should be included.

My business requirements specifies that my mongo docs should be displayed sorted and paged in a table, where their sort order ignores their case. Unfortunately, sorting while ignoring case, is not supported using the current Mongo publication interface.

So currently, my publication must request the complete collection, unsorted, and I must sort the docs locally, then determine which docs I can display for the page.

I am doing that. I copy the whole unsorted minimongo collection into a reactive array (using observe), then sort, then display the correct portion of that instead, and it works, but:
- its unfortunately that I am required to publish the complete collection in order to determine which subset of docs to display. I only display 20 docs per page.
- its also unfortunate that I lose the nice blaze feature that a single doc update only causes the matching displayed doc to be refreshed. Currently, because I am sorting using a reactive array, any displayed doc change causes all my displayed docs to be redisplayed.

Am I missing something? Is there any way I can hook into mongo/minimongo to specify my more specific publication request, and is there any way I can write something that supports blaze's singledoc display optimization, but when using arrays of docs instead of a collection?

As my number of docs in my collection increases, this is becoming more and more critical.  

Any suggestions would be handy. THX
