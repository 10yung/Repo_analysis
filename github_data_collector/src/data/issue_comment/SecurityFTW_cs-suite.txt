## Purpose
Make it possible to use python 3 by changing the things that throw errors in python 3. 
## Testing
Tested running with python 3.7.5 on OSX
Feature to add variable values as command line argument was already there, Now it supports os environments as well as a concept of configfile has been introduced.
The Readme states you need Python 2.7.  The [countdown clock](https://pythonclock.org) shows that it will be EOL a little over 2 months from now.
Hi there, I just tried to run this tool today with -env aws.

I kept getting this exception in a few different spots:
```
File "cs.py", line 89, in <module>
    main()
  File "cs.py", line 53, in main
    from modules import awsaudit
  File "/Users/coltonleese/cs-suite/modules/awsaudit.py", line 30, in <module>
    account_name = get_account_alias() or get_account_id()
  File "/Users/coltonleese/cs-suite/modules/awsaudit.py", line 15, in get_account_alias
    account_details = json.loads(str(account_details))
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/json/__init__.py", line 338, in loads
    return _default_decoder.decode(s)
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/json/decoder.py", line 366, in decode
    obj, end = self.raw_decode(s, idx=_w(s, 0).end())
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/json/decoder.py", line 384, in raw_decode
    raise ValueError("No JSON object could be decoded")
ValueError: No JSON object could be decoded

```
I fixed it by changing the command 
```
subprocess.check_output(['aws sts get-caller-identity')], shell=True
```
to
```
 subprocess.check_output(['aws sts get-caller-identity --output json')], shell=True
```

I can submit a PR if you want but don't know if this is widely applicable. 

thanks.
Hello,

I am trying to implement this tool, and I was wondering if there was a way to get the output as XML rather than JSON or just as the .log file. Thanks!
Add support to AWS profiles to simplify multiple account auditing
Next err occurs, during script run because of "wildcard" in source definition:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):

Actual `line` contains next string `Allow	443	Inbound	Tcp` which can be actually spited od `['Allow', '443', 'Inbound', 'Tcp']`

rule set (`lines`) looks like this:

```
Allow	443	Inbound	Tcp
Allow	*	Inbound	Tcp
Allow	22	Inbound	Tcp
Allow	443	Inbound	Tcp
Allow		Inbound	Udp	192.168.1.5
```
Implements a query filter on `StackStatus` to ignore CloudFormation stacks that have `DELETE_COMPLETE` as `StackStatus`. This will reduce the executing time significantly on some AWS accounts.

**Reason:** Performing an audit on an AWS account with a big amount of deleted CloudFormation stacks takes very long. The checks that are modified by this change do not make sense on deleted stacks. These checks are:
- Check Cloud Formation stacks are using SNS
- Check stacks have a policy
When running an Azure Audit I receive the following error:

6.1: Checking if any network group allows public access to RDP

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "cs.py", line 89, in <module>

  File "cs.py", line 83, in main

    j_res['value'] = "The network group %s does not allow public RDP access" % network_group
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'j_res' referenced before assignment
I did run the assessment on my AWS account (non-container mode) and in results I can see check numbers as null, as given below:
{
			**"check_no": "null",**
			"level": "null",
			"region": "<some_region>",
			"value": "<some_value>",
			"score": "Scored",
			"type": "<type>"
		}

I am expecting CIS check numbers here.
