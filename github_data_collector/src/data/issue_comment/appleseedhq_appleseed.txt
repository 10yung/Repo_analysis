To merge after https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/pull/2756
In particular:

- Why are there more fireflies in 02 (SPPM) than 01 (PT?)
- Why are 03 (MRI disabled in PT) and 04 (MRI enabled in PT) the same?
A good resolution I'm taking for 2020 is to stop having a parallel, private list of issues and things to do, and use GitHub's issue tracker instead.

What you'll find below is a random list of TODOs and issues, some of which might be already done, obsolete, or just plain bad ideas. They are roughly sorted in ascending creation time, i.e. top issues are _very_ old and bottom ones are newer.

These entries, as they are tackled, should be converted one by one to GitHub tickets.

- [ ] update copyright notices for 2020
[triplanar2.zip](https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/files/4049466/triplanar2.zip)

The problem appears to be caused by these lines in as_texture_helpers.h:

https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/blob/master/src/appleseed.shaders/include/appleseed/texture/as_texture_helpers.h#L136-L137
Even when Object Space is used, intersection point coordinates are not normalized with respect to the object's bounding box. That means that if the object is, say, a box with dimensions 3x3x3 (in object space), then the texture will be tiled three times in each direction (assuming frequency = 1). With frequency = 2, it will be tiled six times, etc.

Is it possible to (optionally?) normalized texture coordinates?
It's supposed to switch between shading override modes but it no longer does.
This fixes issue #2712.
