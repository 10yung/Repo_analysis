Hello @krzysztofzablocki 

With Xcode 10.2, compiling for and running on an iOS 12.2 device I got the following crash occurring: 
```
objc [1138]: Swift class extensions and categories on Swift classes are not allowed to have + load methods(Lldb).
```
It looks like in our case removing LifetimeTracker seems to have sorted it out.

Kind Regards,

Goffredo
For some reason the app crashes when trying to present the details of memory leaks by pressing the "i" button

Why is this happening? am i doing something wrong?

edit:
i changed the version to 1.6 and now it happens when i'm trying to display the leaks
Maybe I can take this and help out as I would use it myself.
plan to support macOS App?
