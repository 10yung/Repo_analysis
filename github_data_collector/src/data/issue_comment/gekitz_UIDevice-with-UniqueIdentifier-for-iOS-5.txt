Making UniqueIndentifier using the MAC ID not going to work on IOS 7. Need some other technique if possible.

I understand that Apple are starting to restrict access to the MAC address too. Is this going to affect the functionality?

If so, has anyone got any plans as to how we can generate a unique ID for a device?!

Hey,

I've added 'Install app' button into your README file. Anyone could try your sample application right in browser. Look how it's working!

To learn more, please look at: http://macbuildserver.com/github/opensource/

Added a Static library target. Made demo project use it.
Fixed possible low level leaks by using STL.

Provided more types consistency by using C++ casts.

Haven't inspected the code in great detail, but how unique is this identifier really? MAC Addresses are [not unique](http://superuser.com/questions/268006/are-mac-addresses-unique-when-coming-out-of-the-factory). There is 16.7 million possible addresses per manufacturer. Given that Apple Sold way more iPhones [(250 millions)](http://www.ubergizmo.com/2012/07/apple-sold-250-million-iphones-to-date/) than possible addresses is only a matter of time before you get same MAC Address for 2 different users. 

My understanding is that the App's Bundle Identifier is also the same for all users that download the app, which will not make it unique if two users that have the same MAC address use the same app.

Am I missing something?



As discussed in this commit comment, the library as-is poses a serious privacy leak issue and should not be used:
