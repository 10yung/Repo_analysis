## What is CodeTriage?

CodeTriage is an Open Source app that is designed to make contributing to Open Source projects easier. It works by sending subscribers a few open issues in their inbox. If subscribers get busy, there is an algorithm that backs off issue load so they do not get overwhelmed

Hello,

Is it possible to add code in this project in order to substring all input lines? I would like to apply same substring function to all lines. I am a student and I have to done this to pass exam. Thanks in a advance! 

It is 180 chars in each line and I'd like to add substr(157,6). Please help!
Tail blazer does not properly switch tab focus when opening a log file. 

Steps to reproduce. 

Set tail blazer as default open with application for a type of text file .log .ini .txt etc 

double click a log file in explorer. 

Tail blazer will open however if the application has other tabs previously opened it will remain focused on the previous tab and not change focus to the newly opened file

Feature request: export a tab to a file when it is filtered to just matching search results.
The last Chocolately TailBlazer release was in June 2016. Same for the GitHub releases page.
When is the next release for TailBlazer scheduled? 
It would be cool if you could merge tabs together from multiple log files and search them as one collective log file.
Quite often, it is useful to quickly find the next/previous occurrence of some text, be it in the search results or in the inline.

Currently, this requires to filter the whole file again, and try to find back the corresponding line numbers. For big files, this is very slow â€“ and it won't work at all if the number of matches is more than 50k. Additionally, it makes it very difficult to combine the first result with the second one.
