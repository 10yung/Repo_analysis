I'm trying this on Mac, and it doesn't seem to work.
Currently, OMP is taking a lot of time to load. Im working on debugging this before moving to the other issues.
Shouldn't `$env:USERPROFILE\.powershellrc.ps1` be `$env:USERPROFILE\.oh-my-posh.config.ps1`

I don't have a `powershellrc.ps1`
I'm getting the following errors on win 10, PS 5:

```

How do you properly install this?
Do I really have to unrestrict the script execution for this to work?

When I try to install using the command listed in the README I get the following error:

```

Hey @pecigonzalo,

One of the features that makes Oh-My-Zsh so great is it's open API, and extremely hackable design.

I've written a Polyfill-like library for PowerShell [[Components for PowerShell](https://github.com/avdaredevil/Components-For-Powershell)], which I feel would make for a great plugin within Oh-My-Posh. Let me know if you'd like to spec out a standardization/api for 3rd party integrations with other PS-Libraries.

Perhaps using npm/(some git client) as a method of automated installing of 3rd party/optional packages right from git!


Taking an update this morning broke my installation. To fix it, I had to manually delete my .oh-my-powershell directory in `$env.USERPROFILE` and the oh-my-powershell directory in `$env.USERPROFILE\Documents\WindowsPowershell\Modules` as well as change the module import name in `$env.USERPROFILE\Documents\WindowsPowershell\Scripts\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` from `Oh-My-Powershell` to `Oh-My-Posh` and reinstall. I finally had to restore my custom theme and the contents of my config file.

This replaced my directories with directories bearing the new module name and restored functionality.

This should explain plugin/module functionality and how to drop custom plugins.
It should include docs about PSColor and PSCX dependancies for certain aspects.


Each plugin should have a README.md file explaining its settings and functionality.
