I want to add as a child view controller to a container view; is this possible? Because when present a view controller it is displayed on the top above all the other content.
Hi, thanks for sharing the great work.
It works well on my project, but my project needs the ability to keep accepting gestures of the user, wondering if this can be done with Bubble Transition?

i want this in my navigation controller
The warning "The unbalanced calls to begin/end appearance transitions" seems to occur on my UINavigationViewController when i tries to present another controller.
Hello,

First of all, thank you for sharing your work, it's great!

I would like to know if you ever considered adding an optional UIImage to be used as a bubble background?

It would be a nice improvement I feel.

Cordially,
