I am running estalk two weeks ago, and now , I am login with the admin account, at the admin page, it stopped and give a 504, I can't make any settings, and I think if the latest news was disabled, it will work ok.
This is probably a controversial pull request, but I decided to suggest it anyways. I am developing an esoTalk forum app for Nextcloud [over here](https://github.com/mroi/nextcloud-esotalk). (*)

Unfortunately, Nextcloud runs PHP with strict error reporting and I additionally add `open_basedir` restrictions on top. The first patch in this pull request fixes many warnings esoTalk emits with PHP strict reporting. The second patch fixes warnings due to `open_basedir`. These should have no particular effect on standard esoTalk installations, since I (hopefully) did not change any code semantics.

The only limitation I can see is that the array indexing for function returns only works with PHP 5.4 and above. So feel free to reject this pull request or cherry-pick from it. Or ask me questions for particular changes.

(*) I know that I will have to transition to Flarum in the near future, but I am maintaining this anyways, because it is in active use for a project I manage.
When I installed the software it said that there was a 404 error and now I cant set it up. it was working fine until I put mysql info in the forms.
Tons of spam everywhere on esoTalk forums. Even on http://esotalk.org/forum. 

Is there any solution? 
Hi there, I need a captcha for this script, can anyone provide me ReCaptcha service (paid work) or do it for me, plugins are not working any longer.

esotalk-1.0.0g5

If you switch the "sort by" to "last visited" it seems that if you have a given set of members, it will only load those forever regardless of how much you scroll down. By scrolling down all it does is repeat the last given page or two of these results over and over again and does not stop from loading these members.

When i try to activate my account:

When I finish the registration:

But actually.. The registration is completed, only need to activate the account.

esoTalk version 1.0.0g4
PHP version 5.6.23
MySQL version 10.1.13-MariaDB // xampp

without the url rewrite , the path should be "index.php/..."

- Added missing preferences for user options to allow config file to set those defaults. 
- Added nofollow to individual post's permalink.
