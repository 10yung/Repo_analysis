any hints? thanks!
I use a Q & A site which encourages use of Pasteboard for uploading images : http://physics.qandaexchange.com/

Recently all of the Pasteboard images which were embedded using the cdn URL have failed to appear on the above site. This affects around 500 posts on the site.

Has there been a recent change in your software which has caused this error?

There is no information on the Pasteboard website about how to get customer support.


Has the license for the secure connection expired?

I love this site, but today I cannot access it.

A separate issue, and I can post it as well. Any of your http (non-secure) links from GitHub to pasteboard.co are blocked by MalewareBytes as containing a trojan. I'm not willing to risk infection to see if that is an error.

The image links for old uploads still work.

Considering the code here on github is 4 years old, I'm guessing this site is no longer being maintained. Where else to post issues? You could update your README.md file to point people to the right location.

=> need to set new version of microtime in package.json
   "microtime": "2.1.2",

=> to be able to upload, I nedd to upgrade version of formidable too
    "formidable": "1.1.1",

Tap to upload an image? Are you crazy :D or it's some bot protection for a while?
i like so much to pasteboard!!!!!
but i wish add file format zip?

if pasteboard is not can add zip but i wish ask you there are "similar" other site but style similar pasteboard..? can leave here list for ohter similar.. but this is for information share link..ok?

pasteboard: :+1: :+1: :+1: :+1: :+1: :+1: :+1: 
Returns:

> 502 Bad Gateway

When someone sharing http://pasteboard.co/tEGLl0t.jpg on an irc channel, one user said that it breaks is current workflow. His irc client is configured to open such url with a picture viewer and it obviously fail.

As someone else says, "it is perfectly legal, but it is not because it is possible that you have to do it."

Fixes #44 

Thanks for pasteboard!

We made a Cloudron app for Pasteboard (The Cloudron is a private server on which you can install apps). The app source is at https://github.com/cloudron-io/pasteboard-app. We also have selenium based integration tests under https://github.com/cloudron-io/pasteboard-app/tree/master/test.

We have a series of patches in our fork to make the app possible. Would be great to have them integrated :-) I will submit a PR shortly.
