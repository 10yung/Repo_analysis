### Steps to reproduce
1. set sendmail_path in php.ini to non default value e.g. "/usr/bin/msmtp -t -i" 
2. open owncloud admin panel, go to Email-Server settings. select mode sendmail or php
3. send test email

### Expected behaviour
Value of sendmail_path should be used: ("/usr/bin/msmtp -t -i")
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.3/admin_manual/configuration/server/email_configuration.html#configuring-php-and-sendmail

### Actual behaviour
"/usr/sbin/sendmail -bs" is always invoked, which means that smtp relay msmtp will not work.
The value actually seems to be hardcoded here:
https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/2b95bc4c95f00f91717fab0a3628213cc8b19d57/lib/private/Mail/Mailer.php#L223-L234



### Server configuration
**Operating system**: Debian 9.2

**Web server: Apache** 

**PHP version: 7.3**

## Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->
Implement the method `getSize` in `SharedFile.php`

## Related Issue
<!--- This project only accepts pull requests related to open issues -->
<!--- If suggesting a new feature or change, please discuss it in an issue first -->
<!--- If fixing a bug, there should be an issue describing it with steps to reproduce -->
<!--- Please link to the issue here: -->
- Fixes #36741

## Motivation and Context
<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->
The webdav-api for public files couldn't get the correct file size
since `SharedFile.php` did not implement the `getSize` method.

## How Has This Been Tested?
<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->
<!--- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->
<!--- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->
To test execute a PROPFIND request for a shared file via the webdav public-files API
`curl -s --user user:password --basic http://localhost:8080/remote.php/dav/public-files/HXEGrChNif8AWBq -X PROPFIND`

## Description
If we change `Error` to `Other` (which is already a translated string) then we avoid the translation problem. IMO "Other" is an OK title for this "Additional" settings page when it is empty.

### Contexts and traits in acceptance tests
Currently we have Several traits such as `Provisioning`, `Webdav` etc. These contains steps which are used in almost all of the tests suites. These are available through the featureContext in tests. 
The featureContext uses BasicStructure which in turn uses all other traits such as `Provisioning`, `Webdav` etc. So Basic Structure is just a unnecessary interface in between which we can remove.
To improve the contexts and traits in acceptance tests, we need to do
- [ ] Get Rid of BasicStructure
- [ ] Refactor all traits into contexts except `Provisioning`, `Webdav` and `Sharing` as these are the essential features of owncloud and traits such as `Logging` and `Ip` specific features only used by some tests.
- [ ] Fix `behat.yml` in core and all other apps to use newly created contexts.
related issue: https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36751

- [x] rollback html and css structure changes from https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36573 that broke compatibility with advanced share attributes that get registered by apps (example: https://github.com/owncloud/richdocuments/blob/master/js/viewer/shareoptions.js#L222-L260 and https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/onlyoffice-owncloud/blob/master/js/share.js#L322-L372)
- [x] make sure expiration code works as expected
- [x] adjust required unit and acceptance tests

Hi - ran the updater today going from 10.1 to 10.3.2.2.  Verything is fine except i was missing two files.  README.md and updater/CHANGELOG.md.  I managed to get the README.md from a tar ball i downloaded from here but that tar file does not have the updater directory.  The CHANGELOG.md from teh root of the tar ball fails validation.  Where can i get the tar ball for 10.3.2.2 that has the updater directory?  The version on the website seems to be just 10.3.2.

```

## Description
`fetch` returns `false` when the share does not exist
we don't need to dispatch the Decline event on `false`

## Motivation and Context
it causes sending a decline request to an empty remote server:
`federatedfilesharing/lib/AppInfo/Application.php(268): OCA\FederatedFileSharing\Notifications->sendDeclineShare(NULL, NULL, NULL)`

## How Has This Been Tested?
An unit test. 
The way of reproduction IRL is unclear.
