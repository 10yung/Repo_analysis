While working on https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/30495, I realized that clang-format has transformed:

```c
#define LIMIT_MAX(T) _Generic(((T)0), \
  unsigned int: UINT_MAX,             \
  unsigned long: ULONG_MAX,           \
  unsigned long long: ULLONG_MAX)
```

into:

```c
#define LIMIT_MAX(T) _Generic(((T)0),              \
                              unsigned int         \
                              : UINT_MAX,          \
                                unsigned long      \
                              : ULONG_MAX,         \
                                unsigned long long \
                              : ULLONG_MAX)
```

and couldn't quite figure out which \*colon\* rule needs to be set to leave alone _Generic block: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html.
I set like follow:

KeepEmptyLinesAtTheStartOfBlocks: true

but a lot of result like follow:

- (void)stopAudioMix {
    G_StopAudioMix(_livePush);
}

there are no empty line after "{"，But other format has been applied.
Is this a BUG?
Please update this plugin to support XCode 9.
I resigned XCode 9, ClangFormat plugin loaded, its menu appeared, but it's not working - nothing happens when I try to format code.
Maybe it's because of new editor in XCode 9? 
It can be really cool to get XcodeClangFormat app for Xcode 8 via homebrew cask.

This is the documentation : https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/doc/development/adding_a_cask.md

Hi,

I am confused about this line in the documentation:

`Clone this repo, build and run ClangFormat, restart Xcode.`

I assume it means to run `open ClangFormat.xcodeproj`, build the project, and run the code.

After doing that and restarting Xcode, the `Edit` menu does not contain a `Clang Format` submenu (as shown in the GIF).

Am I missing something obvious?

Xcode 7.3.1

`text = @"点击下方的“+”或者在其他应用中选择“使用易企签打开”导入文档";`

The result is always like this:

```
text =
@"点击下方的“+"
@"”"
@"或"
@"者"
@"在"
@"其他应用中选择“使用易企签打开”导入文档";
```

Allow format selected range without explicit selection, in which case the current state under the cursor will be formatted.

这是一整个字符串,却格式化成多个.

Hi,

I've realized that current clang-format bin 3.8.0 has a wrong Linux configuration, after some investigation this is the source of the change: http://reviews.llvm.org/D15485

I've installed clang-format 3.9.0 through HomeBrew and it works like a charm, but would be nice to have it updated on the plugin for most of the users.

Cheers!

I have problems when configured plugin to use File, but open projects where there a re no `.clang-format` file. The problem is especially when format-on-save enabled. I don't wanna toggle this option every time I change project :(
