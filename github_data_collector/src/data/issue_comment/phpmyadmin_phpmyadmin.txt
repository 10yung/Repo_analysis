### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Not a real problem - just makes the Designer (D) more friendly

### Describe the solution you'd like
I would like D to retain the page number of the DB that I last used (in D) after going back to other views - perhaps to setup an index that I forgot.

### Describe alternatives you've considered
The only alternative available is to continually bounce back to the affected ERD after after adding/modify the structure/index.

### Additional context
- Windows 10
- phpMyAdmin version: ALL versions including 5.1.0 dev.

Pretty straightforward - don't think pictures would help
my system is:
    

> Apache/2.4.41 (Fedora) OpenSSL/1.1.1d
>     Database client version: libmysql - mysqlnd 5.0.12-dev - 20150407 
>     PHP extension: mysqli curl  mbstring 
>     PHP version: 7.3.13

the output of php-fpm/www-error.log:

> [18-Jan-2020 19:53:47 UTC] PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Class 'Williamdes\MariaDBMySQLKBS\Search' not found in /usr/share/phpMyAdmin/libraries/classes/Controllers/Server/VariablesController.php:53

>   thrown in /usr/share/phpMyAdmin/libraries/classes/Controllers/Server/VariablesController.php on line 53

I have installed the only package i can find that has anything like the name williamdes which is php-williamdes-mariadb-mysql-kbs-1.2.8-1.fc31.noarch.rpm to no avail

any help is appreciated.

Could be very helpfull to have an integrated HTML text editor for text fields
The first 4 lines of a database export with default settings in phpMyAdmin are:
```
SET SQL_MODE = "NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO";
SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0;
START TRANSACTION;
SET time_zone = "+00:00";
```

The last 4 lines contain:
```
COMMIT;

/*!40101 SET CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT=@OLD_CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT */;
/*!40101 SET CHARACTER_SET_RESULTS=@OLD_CHARACTER_SET_RESULTS */;
/*!40101 SET COLLATION_CONNECTION=@OLD_COLLATION_CONNECTION */;
```

I see that the AUTOCOMMIT is disabled but never enabled. I have noticed because we imported a SQL (generated by phpMyAdmin) and in the same session also executed some INSERT statements. These rows where not visible in the database (because they where never committed).

In the MySQL docs I read this:

> With START TRANSACTION, autocommit remains disabled until you end the transaction with COMMIT or ROLLBACK. The autocommit mode then reverts to its previous state.

This states that a `SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0` automatically when starting a transaction. Is there a reason why phpMyAdmin disables the autocommit and then never enables it? Is it possible to remove the `SET AUTOCOMMIT=0` or add a `SET AUTOCOMMIT=1` on the last line of the export?
