Docs say Visual Studio Team Services are supported, but since that's not an available product anymore, that's no longer really accurate. I never used VSTS, and maybe the MS-provided URL redirection is still working for repos cloned with a `visualstudio.com` URL. 

The Azure DevOps URLs will definitely need some special handling; see below. 

If an incorrect URL is opened, please provide the following so we can write a test:

#### Example clone url:
https: `https://thomastaylor0772@dev.azure.com/thomastaylor0772/friends-with-boats/_git/friends-with-boats`
ssh: `git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/thomastaylor0772/friends-with-boats/friends-with-boats`

#### Example branch name:
testing

#### Expected web URL:
For base git repo: `https://dev.azure.com/thomastaylor0772/_git/friends-with-boats`

For a branch: `https://dev.azure.com/thomastaylor0772/_git/friends-with-boats?path=%2F&version=GBtesting&_a=contents`
The `path` and `_a` params are optional - I included them as they're inserted when navigating to a branch in the Azure DevOps web interface, but 
`https://dev.azure.com/thomastaylor0772/_git/friends-with-boats?version=GBtesting` works fine, similar to how VSTS/TFS are currently handled.  

For an issue (issue # 1): `https://dev.azure.com/thomastaylor0772/friends-with-boats/_workitems/edit/1/`

Maybe this would work currently if the remote is set for https, but SSH remote definitely doesn't work. I tried to get it sorted with 
`> git config --global "open.https://ssh.dev.azure.com.domain" "dev.azure.com"`
but the `:v3` in the SSH url and the lack of a `_git` token kept that from working. 


Hello

First, thank for your work! This utility command is really useful and is exactly what I was thinking about

I want to suggest to open the `master` branch if the current branch doesn't have a connected remote branch.
For example:
I am doing some stuff on the `BRANCH1` branch which doesn't have remote upstream. So if I type `git open`, `master` branch will open instead of 404 error in the browser (because the current branch doesn't exist in the remote repo)

We are using your tool for a long period of time. We are **interested to contribute** to the tool. While we are going through the code we think we found an unused code.

`exec &>/dev/null` - we are redirecting the outstream and errstream to `null` but we are not printing anything after this line. So we think we can remove this line. What do you think?
I tried this on WSL and was pleasantly surprised to find it works (I was expecting it to fail complaining about being unable to open Chrome, or make a GUI call).

*However*, it seems to change the console to use Raster fonts - any ideas on what might be doing this?

The documentation claims that single letter flags -c, -i and -p should work - but on my GNU bash, version 5.0.2(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin16.7.0), they do not, because they do not seem to be implemented.

I have only tested this branch on this one machine but the change seems fairly clear...
Omit `remote-repo` if we just have one remote repo.

`git open [remote-repo] branch-name`


Add a flag to open CI/CD tool URL:

```
git open --cx
```

Based on the contents of the repo we could identify the CI URLs. However, there are a lot of limitations. For travis, circleci etc. we could identify the URL easily but for self-hosted CI/CD tools like GoCD, Jenkins it will be difficult.

Adding this idea here so that someone could come up with a better way to do it. Let me know if this feature makes sense.
