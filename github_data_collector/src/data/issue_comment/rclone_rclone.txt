Welcome :-)

So you've got an idea to improve rclone? We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.

Here is a checklist of things to do:

  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.
  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/
  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).
  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)

Looking forward to your great idea!

#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?

rclone v1.50.2
- os/arch: darwin/amd64
- go version: go1.13.4

#### What problem are you are trying to solve?
Accidental Deletion


#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?

Add the ability to specify something like interactive-mode = true within rclone.conf

Enabling interactive mode would cause rclone to present Yes/No options to a user when conducting an operation that results in overwriting or deleting a file to prevent accidental data loss.

Welcome :-) We understand you are having a problem with rclone; we want to help you with that!

If you've just got a question or aren't sure if you've found a bug then please use the rclone forum:

    https://forum.rclone.org/

instead of filing an issue for a quick response.

If you think you might have found a bug, please can you try to replicate it with the latest beta?

    https://beta.rclone.org/
    
If you can still replicate it with the latest beta, then please fill in the info below which makes our lives much easier.  A log with -vv will make our day :-)

#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?
Receiving `Input/output error`s. I use it regularly and didn't have this issue in the past but I did not change anything knowingly.


#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)
I tried several, including the latest beta:
```
./rclone version
rclone v1.50.2-146-g3a1b41ac-beta
- os/arch: linux/amd64
- go version: go1.13.6
```


#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)
Linux, 64 bit


####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)
Google Drive


#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)
```
rclone mount
```


#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)
I mounted with `--log-level DEBUG --dir-cache-time 60m` and then run `find gdrivefs/ -maxdepth 1` twice. Both find commands end with `find: ‘gdrivefs/’: Input/output error`.

The rclone command produces a ton of output but nothing looking suspicious. On the second run with everything cached it only procudes:

```
2020/01/16 19:49:30 DEBUG : /: ReadDirAll: 
2020/01/16 19:49:30 DEBUG : /: >ReadDirAll: item=1556, err=<nil>
```

What is your current rclone version (output from rclone version)?

Rclone v1.50.2

What problem are you are trying to solve?

there is no support for the provider furk.net (wwww.furk.net)

How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?

rclone should access (rw or only r) the MyFiles on furk.net and mount the cloud drive.

The API is described at https://www.furk.net/t/api

Hello, I am a university students in engineering. I interest in program a new remote but have some problem faced.
<hr>

[Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas/higher-education) is a platform mostly used in university, which allow for teacher upload their notes for students and allow student to access it. And also for grade checking and assignment submission.

Basically, there are two types of storage can be implemented in rclone of this remote, in the students side.

- The File/Folder of each course, which should be read-only
- The account storage which should be read-write, while for the "Submission" folder (saving any submitted assignment) is read-only
<hr>

Canvas has a [RESTAPI](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/) by using a API key. The API allow for [list](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/files.html) the folders and files in a course, which require to provide a course id, while the course of a student can be [listed](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/courses.html#method.courses.index) to get all the course id.

While the idea of a remote path is : canvas:/\<course title>/\<folders or files inside the course>/... , and the method/func used to list root directory suppose to be different.

But I am not sure the whole scenario of rclone, Is any pre-existed remote is using RESTAPI for reference and which interface inside [fs/fs.go](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/fs/fs.go) should be programmed?
And also, how to handling the permission of the folders and files?



Rclone adds `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header on requests even when the `--no-gzip-encoding` flag is present.

#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?

Server is using a WAF and checking for `Referer` or `Origin` headers. If they (one or another) do not exist, requests are denied.

> Sorry, your request has neither Referer nor Origin set and is using a non safe method. Thus, your request has to be blocked.: 403 Forbidden

Accessing trough a browser, Nextcloud clients, Cyberduck or Filezilla Pro works fine.

#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)

`1.50.2`

#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)

`Ubuntu 18.04.3`

####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)

Webdav (Nextcloud)

#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)

`rclone lsd nextcloud:`

#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)
