Google's released a new "Turbo" map that is designed as a replacement for "Jet".  It is designed as a compromise between viridis-type maps and the useful many-color properties of rainbow maps.  It doesn't quite meet the stringent rules colors in this package meet, but it does have a coherent philosophy and some distinct advantages:

Should we include Turbo in `viridis`? Inclusion in viridis makes it rapidly available in ggplot2 and lots of other packages, which is helpful if the purpose is to serve people who want these popular maps. On the other hand it makes `viridis` less coherent.  If so, we probably want to modify the vignette to explain the difference.
If I try to load viridis and the sf package in the same R session, I get an error on trying to load the second package. The error message is:

    Error in get(genname, envir = envir) : object 'group_map' not found
    Error in get(genname, envir = envir) : object 'group_split' not found

Whichever package is loaded first works fine. I am running sf ‘0.7.4’, viridis 0.5.1, and R 3.5.1 on macOS 10.14.5.
We are contacting you because you are the maintainer of **viridis**, which imports **ggplot2** and uses **vdiffr** to manage visual test cases. The upcoming release of **ggplot2** includes several improvements to plot rendering, including the ability to specify `lineend` and `linejoin` in `geom_rect()` and `geom_tile()`, and improved rendering of text. These improvements will result in subtle changes to your **vdiffr** dopplegangers when the new version is released.

Because **vdiffr** test cases do not run on CRAN by default, your CRAN checks will still pass. However, we suggest updating your visual test cases with the new version of **ggplot2** as soon as possible to avoid confusion. You can install the development version of **ggplot2** using `remotes::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")`.

If you have any questions, let me know!
Hi @sjmgarnier 

I've been using your `viridis` package for some time and I really appreciate your work in it. I feel, however, that it should include diverging colormaps.

In version 0.9.0, `seaborn` introduced two new diverging colormaps created with `viscm`(`icefire` and `vlag`). Do you think it would be appropriate to include them into `viridis` and `viridisLite`? I can work in a PR.

Additionally, we can discuss the inclusion of the [`twilight`](https://github.com/bastibe/twilight) circular colormap (included in `matplotlib` 3.0) and the `mako` and `rocks` sequential colormaps (included in `seaborn` 0.9.0). All of them were created using `viscm`.

Thanks!

Whenever I see a new version of viridis, I always wonder what the changes were. A NEWS.md or ChangeLog would be helpful here. Thank you!
Since everything is imported and exported anyway, this only changes that `viridisLite` is no longer attached to the `search()` path, all symbols remain accessible by users who called `library(viridis)`

Fixes #46.
It will create an unnecessary message “Loading required package: viridisLite”

you could import and re-export the `viridis` function from it instead
(sorry for not including both changes in just one patch)
