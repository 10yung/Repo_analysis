### Version 2.2.0 Alpha 2

### Windows 10

### Ender 3

### Behavior
* Estimated time to 'Pause Print' is not displayed (calculated)
* When color change is made and the file is sliced, the time to each color change is listed. It would be nice if this happened with 'Pause Print' as well
* No estimated time to 'Pause Print'
 

_Is this a new feature request?_Yes

# Version
2.2.0-alpha2+

### Operating system type + version
macOS Catalina 10.15.2

### 3D printer brand / version + firmware version (if known)
Prusa MK2s latest version of firmware

### Behavior
After slicing a model, when trying to add a pause at a certain layer using right-click in the layer view causes the layer view to scroll. Attached screen recording upon right-clicking.

Here's some torture test for path planner. It is improved in 2.2.0 but opt-2 seems not working well. There are crossing paths that can be optimized.

Every hexagon should have wipe but according to retractions and paths, there are missing wipes.

Deretraction or unretraction?

Fan is not used and this is shown as a preview of fan speed on model. In such case, the lowest color (dark blue) is most appropriate.

Option "Don't support bridge" not work for 2.1.1 and above versions.
### Version
PrusaSlicer 2.1.1+ linux-64 (AppImage)

### Operating system type + version
Xubuntu 18.04 LTS

### 3D printer brand / version + firmware version (if known)
i3 MK3S + MMU2S (not used to produce the problem, so firmware version is not very relevant (3.8.1-2869 & 1.0.6-372).

### Behavior
* Importing the *.stl or *.3mf occurrs without problem. 
* Slicing fails with an PrusaSlicer error (see image), and the slice rendering is corrupted in an interesting way. Alas not-printable.

The __same__ curvedHolder.stl files was sliced (and printed) succesfully a year ago with Slic3r (then current version). Now the old .stl as well as a new one (generated with OpenSCAD 2019.05) and the equivalent .3mf give the same result in PrusaSlicer. To me it looks like a regression. Restarting PrusaSlicer didn't help.

No

If all went well, there is a PNG screenshot attached as well as a ZIP with a SCAD and 3MF file.
### Version
2.1.1+win64

### Operating system type + version
Windows 10

### Behavior
* Create an empty file called dummy.3mf
* Launch PrusaSlicer
* File -> Import -> Import STL/..., select dummy.3mf, Open
* An error message appears: "Loading of a model file failed"; OK
* Try to delete dummy.3mf; Windows refuses, claiming that the file is open in PrusaSlicer

With an amf file instead of a 3mf file, the file can be deleted as expected.

**Version**
2.2

**Operating system type + version**
All OS

**3D printer brand / version + firmware version (if known)**
MK3S (FW v3.7.0) with MMU2S (FW v1.0.5)

**Behavior**
Add the possibility to paint models directly in PrusaSlicer, the way Mosaic Canvas does. I really want to use PrusaSlicer for creating multicolor models, rather than rely on Meshmixer... Right now, I need to use an alternative slicer.
### Version
2.2.0-alpha

### Operating system type + version
OpenSuSE 42.3

### 3D printer brand / version + firmware version (if known)
Mk3S/MMU2S

_Is this a new feature request?_
Yes

### Feature desired:

Please expose more variables in the custom toolchange gcode area. This will allow for easier integration of custom toolchange scripts that still respect filament settings. I realize that not everything can be exposed, but I'm looking for a few specific ones that cannot be parsed out of the gcode settings section or easily calculated. Specifically:

- toolchange number (not available at all if no wipe tower). Very handy for reference/comment-gcode.
- Wipe volume that must be purged for this toolchange (while accounting for wipe space in objects and infill).

These would probably be tricky but nice to have if possible:
- Ramming sequence for current filament
- cooling move sequence for current filament
- previous and next filament properties

Much appreciated!
