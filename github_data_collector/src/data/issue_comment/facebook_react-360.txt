### Description

Is this a Bug or a Feature Request?

React 360 is failing to start when installing a new package on Windows.

#### Expected behavior

react-360 init and npm start should succeed in starting localhost:8081 to view project

#### Actual behavior

When I execute react-360 init Demoapp, I get the following notice:

### Reproduction

List all the steps required to encounter the issue you're reporting. These steps should be clear and concise.

install node v12.14 on Windows 10. Next following the instructions to create a HelloWorld application. On react 360 init you receive the error for corejs and on npm start, the application does not start.

### Additional Information

* 'react-360' package version: react-360@1.1.0
* 'react-360-web' package version: react-360-web@1.1.0
* Operating System: Windows
* Browser: all
* VR Device: n/a
### Description

I would like to know whether my component is visible for the user who is interacting. How could I detect this. I could not find any life cycle event when the component is visible within a camera, and when it enters or leaves. onHeadPose is invoked only when you happen to gaze. Is there an easier way to get this information?

Thanks for the help.

> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

### Description

I'm trying to access the controllers of the Oculus Quest through this code:

```js
import React from "react";
import {
  AppRegistry,
  StyleSheet,
  Text,
  View,
  VrButton,
  NativeModules
} from "react-360";

const { ControllerInfo } = NativeModules;

export default class Hello360 extends React.Component {

// ...

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    ControllerInfo.getControllers().then(result => console.log(result));
  }

// ...

}

AppRegistry.registerComponent("Hello360", () => Hello360);
```

#### Expected behavior

`result` is an array with at least 2 items for the Oculus Quest controllers.

#### Actual behavior

`result` is an empty array.

### Additional Information

* 'react-360' package version: 1.1.0
* 'react-360-web' package version: 1.1.0
* Operating System: MacOS
* Browser: Oculus Browser 7.1.2.188843022
* VR Device: Oculus Quest


When using the AudioModule.playEnvironmental I am unable to consistently get the audio to play for my backgrounds.

I am testing on mac OS with Chrome v79. I am aware of the policy changes mentioned on this page.
https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes#webaudio
But am not sure how to go about implementing the resume context. Has anyone else had this problem, if so what was the fix?


I would like to make responsive flat panel - on a mobile device should be in full screen like there
[https://tour.croptrust.org/](https://tour.croptrust.org/)  or https://www.3dvista.com/samples/animated_panorama.html
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18757092/70523515-8b2d9300-1b43-11ea-8804-2186f3f11f22.png)

Is there a possibility to achieve that in react-360.

Here is my example https://gstuczynski.com/tour/plaszow/  - try to hit loupe -> on the desktop looks good but how to make it responsive? 
Here is my code
https://github.com/gstuczynski/plaszow-cc-virtual-tour

I would be very grateful to provide me an example of code working in this way.

### Description

I'd like to ask if this library supports panels that can be shown withing a VR game. 
I want to create an overlay application where users can see an html panel (draggable/movable) on top of their games.
Is it possible with this library? Or you can only create standalone applications with it?.

Something like this:
[example](https://i.ibb.co/9p1z9c0/Capture.png)
…facebook/react-360/issues/762)

Thanks for submitting a PR! Please read these instructions carefully:

- [ ] Explain the **motivation** for making this change.
- [ ] Provide a **test plan** demonstrating that the code is solid.
- [ ] Match the **code formatting** of the rest of the codebase.

## Motivation (required)

What existing problem does the pull request solve?

## Test Plan (required)

A good test plan has the exact commands you ran and their output, provides screenshots or videos if the pull request changes UI or updates the website. See [What is a Test Plan?][1] to learn more.  

If you have added code that should be tested, add tests.

## Next Steps

Sign the [CLA][2], if you haven't already.

Small pull requests are much easier to review and more likely to get merged. Make sure the PR does only one thing, otherwise please split it.

Make sure all **tests pass** on [Circle CI][3]. PRs that break tests are unlikely to be merged.

For more info, see the ["Pull Requests"][4] section of our "Contributing" guidelines.
