The coverage is not actually decreasing....is this because of some wrong codecov configs we may have?


Suggestion at ScalaItaly 2018: Instead of depending on scalacheck-shapeless directly, shall we depend on provided dependencies?
Consecutive calls of `random` returns the same instance. Providing an integer to get multiple random elements will however generate different instances. How to overcome this?
(I'm not familiar with Shapless, just want to have simple instances fast.)
