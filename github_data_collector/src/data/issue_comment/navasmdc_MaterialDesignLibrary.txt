good
I migrated to AndroidX and ever since then MaterialDesignLibrary prevents me from building successfully. I currently keep getting this error which I don't get when I comment out MaterialDesignLibrary from my gradle file.

> ERROR: Unable to resolve dependency for ':app@googlePlayFlavorDebug/compileClasspath': Could not resolve com.android.support:support-v4:22.+.
For anyone is facing AndroidX migration issue.

implementation 'com.github.Chenyang0324:MaterialDesignLibrary:1.10'
When multiclicking outside to dismiss the dialog, makes the animation start several times, a variable "dismissInProgress" prevented that.

As "compile" is going to be deprecated end-2018, this PR replaces with "implementation" that is the new usage.
just some formatting of headings
NullPoiterExeption when use ButtonFlat.setTextColor . Your declare "TextView textButton;" inside ButtonFlat is duplicate with supperclass
Added some lacked spaces in those lines.
