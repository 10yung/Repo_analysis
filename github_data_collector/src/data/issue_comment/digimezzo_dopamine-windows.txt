* Windows version: Windows 10 Pro Version 1903 build 18362.592
* Dopamine version: 2.0.1 (Release)

## Reproduction steps
<!--
Add simple steps to reproduce this bug. Please add as many details as possible. 
That helps us reproduce the issue on our computers.
-->
* Download the album folder (you can use download as zip then extract or just download the files and put them in a folder yourself. I don't know if the name of the folder will affect the bug, but best to name it the same thing): https://mega.nz/#F!mzYDhazT!nzW1k_4ITjAt7dJaxxEPqw
* Import the album folder into the dopamine library
* Search for "Colors of Life" and see the album songs appear. Search for the artist "re:plus" and notice the songs do not appear. Searching for "re" and clicking the album does display the songs, but I don't think the problem is the ":" character as the other albums by re:plus don't have this problem.

## Observed behavior
<!--
Describe how Dopamine acts.
-->
* Dopamine shows the album as having 0 songs and doesn't display the album name or any of the songs. I made a YouTube video showing the problem occurring on my end: https://youtu.be/gw460UWHIvA
In the video, I show that double-clicking on the album cover, even when the songs are not showing up, does still play the first song of the album meaning that Dopanime does know the songs are there. Also worth noting, I have had this problem with other albums in the past where songs won't show up depending on the search term, I happened to catch the bug now and have some time to write this bug report. I have been using Dopamine from 2.0 Beta 15 I believe, so this bug has been happening at least since then.

## Desired behavior
<!--
Describe how Dopamine should act.
-->
* Dopamine should display the album as normal with the songs and album name populated.

## I'm using these versions
* Windows version: Windows 10 Pro, Ver. 1909, Build 18363.592

## Reproduction steps
* Install Dopamine 2.0.1 or 2.0
* Add directory with Opus Files

## Observed behavior
The Database stays empty, Dopamine (2.0, 2.0.1) completly ignores the files. The problem does not occur with Ver. 1.5. There the behavior is like intended. I will attach the logs from 2.0 and 1.5.

Hello, I was trying to skip to a certain point in the song when I realized that there is no way to tell which time you are skipping to. As of now, you have to click on the seek bar multiple times to get it right. I think it would be an improvement if you showed the seek time above the playing circle when it is being dragged so that we know where we are seeking to. Also, I think it would be nice to show the time in the same way above the mouse when it is hovering anywhere over the seek bar, not only when the circle is being dragged. With this, we can click and skip exactly to where we want. I have attached two screenshots as examples. Thanks again for all of your work so far.

I happened to send some audio on Discord and saw they have the desired behavior:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37273511/71926185-c16d2b00-3160-11ea-9c7b-c6292cb5a719.png)

As shown in the last screenshot, the seek bar color is lighter up to where the cursor is and darker after it. This would be a plus.

Dopamine goes back sorting songs by Artist as default. Not keeping sorting by song name

Reported by a user:

There is a visual bug when playing though a smart playlist with shuffle enabled.  It goes to the next song in the playlist, then (sometimes) briefly scrolls down to the bottom of the playlist for a split second, then goes back to the playing song.  This doesn't effect playback at all, it's just a visual bug.  It doesn't happen on a normal playlist.

The playlist is a 162 song favorites playlist

I would like to request an optional feature that can make the main window and miniplayer to be active at the same time, kinda like the iTunes does.

Hello, I was just listening to music wondering why the volume was so low. I checked the Dopamine volume level in the bottom right and it was set to 50%. The problem is that at the moment there is no way to tell the approximate Dopamine volume without changing it. I propose removing the rightmost volume icon curve once the volume is below 66% volume, then the middle curve once below 33% volume, and the leftmost curve once at 0% volume.

## I'm using these versions
* Windows version: Windows 10 Pro V. 1903 OS Build 18362.535
* Dopamine version: 1.5.14, 2.0, & 2.0.1
## Reproduction steps
* Download this song [most obvious with this one to me, but seems to be an issue with all wav files (maybe other file types as well, but all my music is in wav files)] doomtree.bandcamp.com/track/the-grand-experiment in wav format
* Play in Dopamine
* Play in Groove Music
* Observe difference in audio quality
* Using Sennheiser HD 559 headphones and a Yamaha MG10XU audio mixer (if relevant)
## Observed behavior
Dopamine seems to have a lower quality/difference in playback from playing with groove music.
## Desired behavior
The same quality playback.
## Log file
Don't know that this is even relevant
