"Edit/delete file" links are already there, but they're not active, IMO it would be useful to be able to quickly edit files from there if you notice some error in files:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6032823/72428140-63a69780-378d-11ea-9730-2ca2d5381f7e.png)

Of course that link should only be active when you can edit the head branch.

Edit: I also noticed that "View file" link there doesn't link you to branch but to commit so that makes it take even longer to edit a file.
GitHub [implemented](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-01-13-shortcut-to-compare-across-two-releases/) a more generic (i.e. less efficient) version of `tag-changelog-link`

<img width="120" alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1402241/72285036-e8ea5900-3674-11ea-8659-eb17d167d2ab.png">

Their feature is not a strict replacement, but now `tag-changelog-link` needs to be moved above it (or... alternative solutions welcome)

## Test

https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/releases/tag/20.1.6
1. Visit the Branches page of a repo you own
2. Resize the window to less than 900px of width
3. Click the Delete icon
	- -> The branch is deleted but the icon is still shown

In the gif I click the icon again and the site obviously throws an error.

A solution would still be preferred to be CSS-only.
When creating or editing a release, ctrl+enter (or cmd+enter) won't do anything.

Normally this shortcut is set to submit the form from `textarea` elements (like when creating a new issue, leaving a comment, leaving a review, etc) but it doesn't work when creating a release.

There should be a space between the branch pull down menu and the corresponding open, linked PR.
If you turn the addon off, the PR button moves to the right which looks better.

Currently, the link to create a PAT for Refined Twitter encompasses the entire `Repo` scope.  There is [currently a link provided](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/search?q=libs/api) within the extension's options to the functions accessing the API, but it's not immediately clear which access scope each one requires (i.e. `repo:status`, `repo_deployment`, `public_repo`, `repo:invite`).

I think it would be ideal to document these specifics (and even the need for a Personal Access Token) in the [README.md](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/blob/master/readme.md), instead of users finding out once they open the extension options for the first time.  Adding the required scope after each feature requiring it would be nice for those that like to limit PAT auth access, without them having to dig through the source code.  I realize that the `Repo` scope isn't very invasive, but it would have been nice to know and have documented up front.

Cheers!
