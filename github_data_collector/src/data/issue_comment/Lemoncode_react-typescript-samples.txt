**Describe the bug**

A warning message appears when you run `npm start` on **00_Boilerplate** project:

`$ npm start

> react-typescript-by-sample@1.0.0 start C:\Users\l.garcia\Documents\Repos\React\react-typescript-samples\hooks\00_BoilerPlate
> webpack-dev-server  --mode development --inline --hot --open

i ｢wds｣: Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
i ｢wds｣: webpack output is served from /
i ｢wds｣: Content not from webpack is served from ./dist
i ｢atl｣: Using typescript@3.6.2 from typescript
i ｢atl｣: Using tsconfig.json from C:/Users/l.garcia/Documents/Repos/React/react-typescript-samples/hooks/00_BoilerPlate/tsconfig.json

WARNING: We noticed you're using the `useBuiltIns` option without declaring a core-js version. Currently, we assume version 2.x when no version is passed. Since this default version will likely change in future versions of Babel, we recommend explicitly setting the core-js version you are using via the `corejs` option.

You should also be sure that the version you pass to the `corejs` option matches the version specified in your `package.json`'s `dependencies` section. If it doesn't, you need to run one of the following commands:

  npm install --save core-js@2    npm install --save core-js@3
  yarn add core-js@2              yarn add core-js@3

i ｢wdm｣: wait until bundle finished: /
i ｢atl｣: Checking started in a separate process...
i ｢atl｣: Time: 845ms
i ｢wdm｣: Compiled successfully.`

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behaviour:
1. Go to **00_BoilerPlate** directory.
2. Run `npm start`.

**Possible solution**

According to [core-js@3, babel and a look into the future](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/master/docs/2019-03-19-core-js-3-babel-and-a-look-into-the-future.md), we have to specify 'core-js' version when we use the babel option 'useBuiltIns`.
I'm using this configuration of typescript and webpack for my project and I have a bug of invalid character in IE11 and I don't know how to solved. I publish in stackoverflow the bug.

Create a Readme_es.md as well (spanish version)

I tried using   `"@types/react-router-dom": "^4.3.0",` ,but error occurs
```
ERROR in [at-loader] ./node_modules/@types/react-router/index.d.ts:69:13
    TS2315: Type 'Location' is not generic.
```

So I Updated @types/history to "4.7.0", fixed this for me.
