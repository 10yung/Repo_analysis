I was wondering if there was any way to make the variables in the `.env` file globally available throughout my entire java application.

It seems as though configuring and loading the variables returns a `Map` of sorts from which you can retrieve all of the values. However I have to configure and load this variable in every file from which I wish to use it.

```java
Dotenv env = Dotenv.configure().directory("./").load();
```

Is there any way I can load them once and use them everywhere? Perhaps even through the native `System.getenv()` static method? Running the configuration and loading once from my `public static main` method or something.
