I am very sorry to bother you, I would like to ask: Where is the file "save_parameter/_W_S"? I didn't find this file when I ran the code.
 I'm sorry to disturb you. I was studying your essay "A Hierarchical Neural Autoencoder for Paragraphs and Documents" recently and I think this essay is very good. For further understanding and learning, I plan to run the code you share on github (https://github.com/jiweil/Hierarchical-Neural-Autoencoder). Unfortunately, I've been running the same error code, I ultimately can not solve, so I would like to ask you about it.Thanh you very much!
  Here is my error situation:
    I plan to train "hier_LSTM_Attention" , so I ran "hier_LSTM_Att.m" . After the run-time code was started, the program would work fine for some time without error, but after a couple of hours an error occurred. I tried to run Many times, the same error occurs every time. This is the wrong message:
        "Out of memory on device. To view more detail about available memory on the GPU, use'gpuDevice () '. If the problem persists, reset the GPU by calling gpuDevice (1)'.
Error softmax (line 37) grad.soft_W = grad.soft_W + grad_softmax_h.soft_W;
Error hier_LSTM_Att (line 99) [batch_cost, grad] = softmax (result, current_batch, parameter); "

 My environment is "GPU matlab2016b memory> = 4G" meet "Requirements: GPU matlab> = 2014b memory> = 4GB" I try to find the reason, but ultimately can not solve this error, so I would like to ask you, thank you! Sorry again, bother you!

Thank you very much !

Hi !
Thanks to sharing your work.

I wonder how you divide sentences from paragraphs of 'HotelReview Corpus'.

I guess you divide sentence boundary based on punctuation marks such as (. ! ? ,)
But, punctuation marks often makes ambiguity: it can be used as end of the sentence as well as other functions such as abbreviation, continuation etc.

Could you provide any tips how could detect sentence boundary with minimal punctuation marks ambiguity?
Specifically, how could you divide sentences by 'comma'?
