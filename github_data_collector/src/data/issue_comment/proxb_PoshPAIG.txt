First of all: Thanks for the great script, just started using it and i already love it!

After Installing the Server 2016 SSU using PoshPAIG the following CU was not Downloaded instantly.
I had to reboot the System in order to get the Servers to download the following update wich was the CU. When viewing the Windows Update Interface on the machine it still showed the SSU to install but when chekcing the eventlog i get the event telling me that the update was installed successfully.

Is it possible to get an USOclient StartScan and StartDownload button? 

This would probably prevent me from needing to restart the server more than actually required...



Im not able to Audit any servers i add in, Get below error on everyone

servername	ERROR	ERROR	ERROR	Exception calling "CreateInstance" with "1" argument(s): "Creating an instance of the COM component with CLSID {4CB43D7F-7EEE-4906-8698-60DA1C38F2FE} from the IClassFactory failed due to the following error: 800706ba The RPC server is unavailable. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x800706BA)."

Hi,

We are using this script to patch our servers, but we found the issues when setting concurrent sessions as "2000" and running the script to install, script is showing patches installed and status as completed.

But when we check on random destination servers, the patches are not installed.
when we try to capture the installed patches report, it's failed, the csv files generated doesn't contains patch installation status.

Can you please help....
I have many failover cluster instances that should not be displayed during the LDAP search because they are not real servers and I only want to update real servers. ;)
In AD, these objects are created with the description "Failover cluster virtual network name account". 

I have changed "$uiHash.LoadADButton.Add_Click" to hide these objects. 

#LoadADButton Events    
$uiHash.LoadADButton.Add_Click({
    $domain = Open-DomainDialog
    $uiHash.StatusTextBox.Foreground = "Black"
    $uiHash.StatusTextBox.Text = "Querying Active Directory for Computers..."
    $Searcher = [adsisearcher]""  
    $Searcher.SearchRoot= [adsi]"LDAP://$domain"
    $Searcher.Filter = ("(&(objectCategory=computer)(OperatingSystem=*server*))")
    $Searcher.PropertiesToLoad.Add('name') | Out-Null
    **$Searcher.PropertiesToLoad.Add('description') | Out-Null**
    Write-Verbose "Checking for exempt list"
    If (Test-Path Exempt.txt) {
        Write-Verbose "Collecting systems from exempt list"
        [string[]]$exempt = Get-Content Exempt.txt
    }
    $Results = $Searcher.FindAll()
    foreach ($result in $Results) {
        **IF ($result.Properties.Item('description') -eq 'Failover cluster virtual network name account'){
            continue
        }**
        [string]$computer = $result.Properties.name
        If ($Exempt -notcontains $computer -AND -NOT $ComputerCache.contains($Computer)) {
            [void]$ComputerCache.Add($Computer)
            $clientObservable.Add((
                New-Object PSObject -Property @{
                    Computer = $computer

Hi,
When I attempt to audit patches on PC running Windows10 1703 I got following error message:
WARNING: Access is denied. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070005 (E_ACCESSDENIED))
I'm running PoshPAIG script as domain admin. I tried to audit patches on workstations with UAC enabled and with UAC disabled - both gives same error result. When I attempted to audit patches by running PoshPAIG directly on workstation with Windows10 1703, error message was different: "WARNING: Exception from HRESULT: 0x80244022"
PoshPAIG randomly started giving inaccurate audit results. 
It will detect that there are, for example, 5 updates and it installs those updates just fine but says only 1 has installed. 
After reboot it says there are no more updates but I will go on the machine and there will be installed but pending reboot. 

Giving this tool a trial run on some servers I received error: `0x80072EE2` .
Running `get-item 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate'` on the affected servers I found the `WUServer` and `WUStatusServer` were pointing to the wrong machine.

It would be good to add functionality to Get/Set this value for selected servers.


Would it be possible that once the updates have installed it automatically checks to see if a reboot is required?

Currently from ive seen it installs updates and says completed but in actual fact they aren't really completed unless the reboot is performed. and for that to be seen you have to run another check.

It would be handy that if updates are installed it then checks for reboot, if not reboot needed it marks as completed if reboot is needed it marks as pending reboot?
Hi Guys,

Any way to have this remove the .vbs file form the C:\ on the target machine?

the Install Patches function is not working.

When selected, it returns back a "Completed/Successful" msg immediately.  But no patches are applied.

Also, no errors are given.
