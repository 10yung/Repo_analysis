Hi,

Great improvement of TimeSheet.js ! 

I'm looking for a "day" feature (not only months). Would you plan to add it ?
I found https://github.com/gisce/timesheet.js but I can't manage to make it work...

Thanks for your answer :)
I added these css properties to make years columns equal width...
Thanks for you code.

.timesheet .scale {
	height: 100%;
	width: 100%;
	display: table;
	table-layout: fixed;
}
.timesheet .scale section {
	min-width: 10%;
	display: table-cell;
	text-align: center;
	height: 100%;
}
.timesheet .data {
	overflow: hidden;
	margin-top: 50px;
}
I wanna use this great library in TypeScript projects, and ANY type is disgusting.
Please add @types
Added documentation for the jumps
A complete rewrite of Timesheet.js with a more useful tooling and everything. Hopefully â€¦

Hi, I'm going to host this lib on [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com).

Can you add the version tag?
It can help me to config git auto-update.

Thanks!

Not really an issue , this is an awesome plugin ! never knew you could do so much , with so little , one question , what the 39 in the code for ?

On the above line i mean.

Thank you.

Updated README.md with bower package name according to Issue #25 .

Dear @sbstjn,
I'm Peter from @cdnjs, we'll like to add the awesome lib on our cdn project, and automatically add the new versions in the future, would you please add [tags](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag) for each version so that our updater can recognize them. Thanks!
