During runtime, there were a few matrix size mismatch issues due to some mistakes in the code that have now been resolved.
[On line number: 25]
The current formula to find the cost (J) fails, as it also includes the theta(1) parameter in the calculations. We should not be regularizing the theta(1) parameter in the code as theta(1) parameter is not affected by the lambda parameter in logistic regression. Hence, that theta(1) parameter must be removed. So, I used "theta(2:length(theta))" instead of "theta" in the formula to find J, so as to exclude theta(1) parameter and find the correct value for J.
Lambda while testing should be 0, not lambda itself
In Octave/MAT-LAB, recall that indexing starts from 1, hence, you should not be regularizing
the theta(1) parameter (which corresponds to theta(0)) in the code.

added the subtraction of the first value of theta at line 26
Changed an incorrect spelling.

You first need to normalise the predict features & then calculate its cost price predictions
My programming environment is Matlab 2014b and I find that it is necessary to  transpose matrix X before slicing,if not matlab will prompt
error and script stop running.
Although I know this repo has already been out of maintenance,these changes works. :)
