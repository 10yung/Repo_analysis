Dear author,

Thanks and cheers for developing this package!

I have the question as to how to use the package to download complete mitochondrial genomes from the NCBI. This is because I am going to working with DNA metabarcoding, and I am interested in developing some new primer pairs for certain animal groups.

I have seen that there are some types that we can specify in the code such as "cds" or "rna", but I haven't seen the option for mitochondrial DNA

Best regards!
Dear author,

I want to download the GRCh37 protein sequence, is it possible?

```
HS.proteome.refseq <- getProteome( db       = "emsembl", 
                                   organism = "Homo sapiens",
                                   path     = file.path("_ncbi_downloads","proteomes"))
```

Best,
Shixiang
Hi there,

I am wondering if there is a way to retrieve Encode regulatory regions from a specified genomic region with the parameters, `mart = "ENSEMBL_MART_GENOMIC"`, `dataset = "hsapiens_encode"`, and `attributes = c("value", "seq_region_start", "name_2", "value_1", "seq_region_end", "encode_region")`.

Using `biomartr::biomart` to retrieve the information does not work because it requires the `genes` parameter. I don't have any gene list (and Encode regions do not always found within genes anyway).

I'd appreciate it if you know a way to achieve this. Thanks for the good work.
This issue depends on the numbers of genomes/ cds/ rna/ etc that are to be downloaded. 
As the process goes on the amount of RAM used by the r-session progressively increases to a point where the entire system slows down.
On a system with 8 GB RAM (low-end systems), I've managed to download ~1600 successfully, but I need to restart system after the process is done as everything is super slow afterwards. So far I've not managed to download higher numbers than that as the system becomes non responsive.
I think it must be some variable that must be increasing in size as the process goes on and can be easily cleaned up after each download (maybe) to reduce RAM usage.
Also note that the RAM usage at times intermittently decreases, i.e,  it's not continuously increasing, but over a long period of time, it increases a lot, eventually overpowering the system.
Hi,

I am trying to download several CDS files from genbank, but I am not getting all of them because some species do not have a CDS file, however, the getCDS command acts as if they were downloaded.

I am using lappy to pass a list of species using their taxonids to getCDS. I first checked that these species have a genome assembly using the assembly_summary.txt file. I think that most of them do not have a CDS file, although there is a genomic assembly, and that is where the problem lies.

`lapply(assembly.monocot.genbank, getCDS, db="genbank", reference =F, path = file.path("_ncbi_downloads","monocot","CDS_genbank"))`

For most of the species, I get the CDS fasta file:

> Starting CDS retrieval of '1504633' from genbank ...
|=============================================================================================================================| 100%   64 MB
CDS download of 1504633 is completed!
Checking md5 hash of file: _ncbi_downloads/monocot/CDS_genbank/1504633_md5checksums.txt ...
The md5 hash of file '_ncbi_downloads/monocot/CDS_genbank/1504633_md5checksums.txt' matches!
The genomic CDS of '1504633' has been downloaded to '_ncbi_downloads/monocot/CDS_genbank' and has been named '1504633_cds_from_genomic_genbank.fna.gz' .

But for some others I get the message:

> Starting CDS retrieval of '1148796' from genbank ...
|=============================================================================================================================| 100%   64 MB
The genomic CDS of '1148796' has been downloaded to '_ncbi_downloads/monocot/CDS_genbank' and has been named '1148796_cds_from_genomic_genbank.fna.gz' .

And there is no fasta file to be found. However, `doc_1148796_db_genbank.txt` and `doc_1148796_db_genbank.tsv` files are in the folder.

Is there a way of checking if a species has a CDS file available?


As a result of using lapply I get a list at the end for all the species:

> [[1]]
[1] "_ncbi_downloads/monocot/CDS_genbank/2003741_cds_from_genomic_genbank.fna.gz"
[[2]]
[1] "_ncbi_downloads/monocot/CDS_genbank/1736659_cds_from_genomic_genbank.fna.gz"
[[3]]
[1] "_ncbi_downloads/monocot/CDS_genbank/1504633_cds_from_genomic_genbank.fna.gz"


When I check the warnings() after the command ends I can see this:

> Warning messages:

I know sometimes NCBI blocks connections that do many queries, so maybe some of these files do exist, but if I run the command again, it tries to download all of them again.

I hope my problem is clearly explained and I hope it is easy to fix too, I find this tool really useful for what I want to do, and it has saved me a lot of time even with this error!

Thanks!

PS: I have also used the meta.retrieval command to get CDS from RefSeq ("Land plants"), but I cannot use it for genbank queries.


Thank you for the nice package!

However, when I try to run a standard `biomartr` query on my local computer it's successful (R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02), macOS)

```
library(biomartr)
getGenome(db = "genbank", organism = "GCA_003138775.1", reference = FALSE)
```

But when I run the same command on a linux server I get the error:

```

And the FTP file `ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/003/138/775/GCA_003138775.1_20110800_S2D/GCA_003138775.1_20110800_S2D_genomic.fna.gz` can be downloaded via `wget` from the server, so it seems not to be a connection issue.

Do you have any idea what is causing the error message?

Hi,

I just started using this package to download proteobacteria and its subgroups, i got an error when it was downloading yersinia nurmii from refseq as in below.

Also how did you classify the output  of listgroups() function if i may ask? Is it up to date or from NCBI database?

Great package btw :)

Hello,
 Really great package. It's now part of my working flow for all analysis. I'm working with plants, so I use [Ensembl Plant](https://plants.ensembl.org/index.html) a lot. One thing I'm curious is: is there any way to specify the release version of *Ensembl Plant*?

 Similar with Ensembl, Ensembl Plant also updates regularly. I want to keep my result replicable, in case they update their database. For example, in the newest Release 40, the *Setaria italica* genome was updated. It seems they do have several *archived* sites, like [Release 35](http://mar2016-plants.ensembl.org/index.html) and [Release 37](http://oct2017-plants.ensembl.org/index.html).

 An example of my code to retrieve gene description is below. It would be awesome if the version info could be implemented (maybe it's already done?) 

 ```R
biomart(genes = gene_list),
        mart = "plants_mart",
        dataset = "zmays_eg_gene",
        attributes = c("description",
                       "external_gene_name", "external_gene_source"),
        filters = "ensembl_gene_id")
```

 Thank you!!

Best,
Ji
Hi Hajk,
I want to use meta.retrieval to get bacterial proteome from ensemblgenomes. There was some connection problems on my Mac first. Then I tried to recover this work on another Ubuntu, but I got a error:

In addition: Warning message:

I can't figure out the problem.

One more thing, every time when I recover unfinished retrieval it seems to cost quite long time to scan previous job. I wonder if we can just let the program leave them out and continue? It will save a lot of time.

By the way, I like your package so much. Please keep updating!

Best regards,
Chi
