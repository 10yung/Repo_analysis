Fixes https://github.com/android/uamp/issues/222

WIP.

Using ExoPlayer's [cast extension](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/new-cast-extension-and-demo-app-55816a50012) and the default media receiver.

✔️ Discovering devices
✔️ Connecting to cast
✔️ Switching from Local (Exo) to Remote (Cast) and back

❌ Playback crashes after playing since `METADATA_KEY_MEDIA_ID` isn't present for cast, this `id` property can't be accessed for metadata update.

Although assistant responds to `Play music on Universal Music player` pretty well, I dont see where is the assistant getting this name for the app. I even changed the name of the app to something else, but it still only works when I say `Universal Music Player` and not the name I changed it too.
I try to get current position in onPlaybackStateChanged, i found that onPlaybackStateChanged method is not executed in real time, but is executed every two seconds，causing the current playback progress interval I get to be 2 seconds.

How to get current position in real time ？？？
Hi,

I noticed that as all application screens were moved to `docs/images` folder there is no reason to keep anymore `screenshots` folder. For now, it contains only a logo of the previous version of an app.

If you don't mind I can create a pull request with a change (deleted `screenshots` folder).

Cheers!
Music files, including album art and all...
Phone: Pixel 3a
Android Version: 10
Android Auto Ver: 4.7.593824
Google Assistant Ver: 10.83.10.21.arm64

Steps to recreate:
1) Compile and install UAMP
2) Open Android Auto
3) Ask Google "play [track*] on UAMP"

Response: 
1) Google Assistant responds "Okay, asking UAMP to play [track]"
2) UAMP app is foregrounded
3) Google Assistant responds "Sorry. Something went wrong please try opening the app to continue."
4) Track does not play.

I've tried rebooting the phone, removing and reinstalling UAMP, turning off debugging, reinstalling Android Auto. All to no avail. Same result.

On vanilla Android (not Android Auto) Google Assistant will open the app and play the track as requested.

I'm using UAMP to guide my coding on an Android Auto-capable music player. If UAMP is not an up to date guide for programming media player voice interactions, is a better (ie working) one available?

*I used: "Jazz in Paris" one of the sample tunes available on UAMP. The problem can be recreated with any track name.

[NowPlayingFragmentViewModel.kt ](https://github.com/android/uamp/blob/f60b902643407ba234a316abe91410da7c08a4af/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/uamp/viewmodels/NowPlayingFragmentViewModel.kt) imports **android.os.Handler** and **android.os.Looper**
It's not against the android architecture rules to use these classes inside ViewModel?
I have a situation where I need to apply pagination from the client-side and server-side. With every request, we'll get only 10 songs and on scrolling, you will get another 10 songs. So, how can we handle this case scenario? Please help me out. Thanks
Hello. Is it possible to remove/hide queue button in AA interface? I'm trying override 
_getSupportedQueueNavigatorActions()_ method with no luck

```kotlin
class MyQueueNavigator(mediaSession: MediaSessionCompat
) : TimelineQueueNavigator(mediaSession) {
    private val window = Timeline.Window()

    override fun getMediaDescription(player: Player, windowIndex: Int): MediaDescriptionCompat =
            player.currentTimeline
                    .getWindow(windowIndex, window, true).tag as MediaDescriptionCompat

    override fun getSupportedQueueNavigatorActions(player: Player?): Long {
        val enableSkipTo = false // <- FALSE
        val enablePrevious = true
        val enableNext = true

        var actions: Long = 0
        if (enableSkipTo) {
            actions = actions or PlaybackStateCompat.ACTION_SKIP_TO_QUEUE_ITEM
        }
        if (enablePrevious) {
            actions = actions or PlaybackStateCompat.ACTION_SKIP_TO_PREVIOUS
        }
        if (enableNext) {
            actions = actions or PlaybackStateCompat.ACTION_SKIP_TO_NEXT
        }
        return actions
    }
}
```
