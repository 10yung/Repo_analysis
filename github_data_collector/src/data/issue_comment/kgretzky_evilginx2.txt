I CONFIRM 

I was playing around with this tool and I've noticed I can't seem to set og_title to anything other than a single value. 

For instance: `lures edit og_title 3 Outlook` works fine.

However, `lures edit og_title 3 Outlook - free personal email and calendar from Microsoft` fails with the following error: [err] lures: incorrect number of arguments

I'm guessing maybe this is how to parsing the arguments is done, and it would be nice to be able to pass in a title that is more than one string. 

Thanks!

Phishlet for one of the biggest webshop in the Netherlands
is there any tutorial for using evilginx2 from localhost, with custom domain and without port forwarding on the router maybe using tunneling?
