        $from = $request->from;
        $to = $request->to;
        $status = $request->status;

        if($status == 'Belum Selesai'){
            $new_status =['Tindakan Lanjutan' , 'Belum Dikerjakan' ,'Sedang Dikerjakan'];
        }
        
        elseif($status == 'Semua Laporan'){
            $new_status = ['Tindakan Lanjutan' , 'Belum Dikerjakan', 'Sedang Dikerjakan' , 'Selesai'];
        }
        else{
            $new_status = 'Selesai';
        }

        $stats = collect($new_status);

        $journal = Aduan::where('ipsrs_id',$ipsrs_id)->whereIn('status',$stats)
        ->whereBetween('created_at', [$request->get('from'), $request->get('to')])->get();

       

        
        $request->session()->put('journal', $journal);
        $request->session()->save();
        
           // dd($journal);

My PDF output is scattered, I'm thinking that is because I've used Semantic UI.
Is there any way to display PDF with Semantic UI in View to be displayed as PDF ?
I have php 7.4.1 and laravel 6 and i try show a pdf with the option **$pdf->stream();** but out this error:

**Trying to access array offset on value of type null**

I wrote a plain html and internal css for generating customer receipt. It display correctly in browser but rendered poorly by dompdf. Is there any solution to this or am I missing something or getting it wrong. 
Did dompdf support slice page from a pdf to new pdf?
I want to show a footer message on each page but it only shows on the 1st one #356 
What must I do do add it to every page?

html something like this
```
<style>
footer {
    position: fixed; 
    bottom: 0cm; 
    left: 0cm; 
    right: 0cm;
    height: 2cm;
}
</style>
<footer>footer footer</footer>
<main>
	lorem ipsum ... and much more html
</main>
```

using: "barryvdh/laravel-dompdf": "0.8.3",

```
$pdf = App::make('dompdf.wrapper');
$pdf->setPaper('A4', 'portrait');
$pdf->loadView('document.pdf', ['document' => $document]);
return $pdf->stream();
```

Hi, when I render a pdf,  tags `<sub>` and `<sup>` are not rendered. I don't know why.
On the blade view everything is ok, but not when I open the pdf
I use laravel 6.2 and the master branch of the laravel-dompdf
Can you help me?
Thanks
