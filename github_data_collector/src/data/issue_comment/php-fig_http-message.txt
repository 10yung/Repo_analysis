A minor update to the file comment so that phpdoc stops complaining.

I wrote the arbitrary content, feel free to change if any of it is wrong.
Moved in docs in #86
see https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/pull/1194
For better IDE autocompletion I suggest replace return type for `ServerRequestInterface::getUploadedFiles()` from simple `array` to `UploadedFileInterface[]`
What:
Standardizes the README file providing a common language and an implementation link.

Why:
There are differences between PSR's READMEs in regarding language and the lacking of implementations references. So I've updated all READMEs using the https://github.com/php-fig/http-factory as base.
I think we should update to PHP 7 (like `psr/http-factory` package):

- PHP 5 is deprecated (PHP 5.6 Security Support Until 31 Dec 2018)
- Using typed parameters and return value of PHP 7, interfaces is clearly visible.



Adds an interface to describe a late stream,  which doesn't requires an already opened resource.

If accepted, I adds the factory too. ;)
State store http
```php
$storage = new StateStorage();
$request = new Request();
$storage = $storage->withRequestState($request);
$request->withRequestTarget($requestTarget);
$withRequestTargetStorage = $newRequestStorage->withRequestState($request);
//......
$withRequestTargetStorage->getRequestState();
```

As far as I can see, `withRequestTarget()` only accepts a `string`.
