#### Expected Behaviour
<!-- What did you think the app was going to do? -->
... 1. When I press play and chose video quality, I’ve got screen " processing movie".  After that movie or  another screen showed up " loading seeds and loading speed" and that should start and play movie...
#### Actual Behaviour
<!-- What does the app do instead? -->
...1.  But and stuck on that. Screen continue to loading seeds and thats all... n Debugger I've got an ip address from GCDWEB SERVER "GCDWebServer started on port 50321 and reachable at http://192.168.1.66:50321/" . but screen doesn’t show up... On iOS 12 work great. This problem is just on iOS 13...

#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour
<!-- What steps do we need to take to find the same bug that you found? -->

I wanted to ask the developers if they would be interested to integrate an optional support for RD or PM in order to have those services to cache the torrents and have the file streamed from their servers.
In my opinion that will make the PCT experience much better and safer, especially on the Apple TV.

It's my first time trying to compile a version of PT myself. I figured out how to get a signed version of the app on my apple tv but now I'm having an issue whereas when I select a movie or show to 'play' the quality selector briefly appears and then disappears. thus being unable to play any movie or show. 

Since it's my first time doing this, and I aspirate to dig in deeper into development I was wondering If this is because I did something wrong when compiling the app or because of a known error. Any help would be appreciated!
