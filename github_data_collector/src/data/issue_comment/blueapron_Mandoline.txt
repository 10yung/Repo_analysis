The 4.0 SnapKit dependency no longer compiles with the latest version of Swift, updating the dependency to 4.2 fixes this.
I'm using SnapKit 4.0.0 in my project, and trying to install Mandoline through Cocoapods raises the error:

[!] Unable to satisfy the following requirements:

- `SnapKit (~> 4.0.0)` required by `Podfile`
- `SnapKit (= 4.0.0)` required by `Podfile.lock`
- `SnapKit (~> 3.2.0)` required by `Mandoline (1.0.0)`
This PR removes the SnapKit dependency from Mandoline. It's still being used in the example project.
I've created a small extension to make creating constraints a little bit more readable.
