Dear fellow Users,
Dear fellow Watchers,
Dear fellow Contributors,
Dear World,

I'm sorry for being so rude and cold with my comments in the last months when you were looking for help. 
I try my best to keep everyone informed but I can't continue if we get new issues every x days. Therefore, this message is a hope that everyone will really read something before submitting a new issue/PR or commenting on an existing one.
Don't know what I'm talking about? Continue!

In August 2018, @daed and I contacted the developer and creator of Laverna, wwebfor, in the hope to get his point of view about the future and state of this project. What we got as a response is a clear point of view about the future and state of Laverna.

Here is an extract of the response we got :

> Actually, I don't use Laverna anymore, and if you check my little contribution to it, you'd understand I'm not useful at all in this project.
>
> Actually, I do think the FOSS community should center its power on others transversal and complete projects, like Nextcloud for instance, instead of projects which don't solve any issue related to synchronization, multi-devices, and local storage; Real problems for 21st-century users which we have to convince to join us.
> This is my opinion, but Laverna is not one of them and doesn't replace in any ways mainstream privacy-reluctant services...
>
>Nevertheless, I wish you will figure out a way to participate in what you want to and hope for.
On my way, I'm out of this one.

**Therefore, please consider this project as "unmaintained", "deprecated" or similar words/states.**

I invite you to migrate, use or contribute to [the Encryptic project](https://github.com/encryptic-team/encryptic) which is the fork of this project.

Please find here @daed's (The maintainer of the Encryptic project) [statement](https://github.com/Laverna/laverna/issues/971#issuecomment-411423965) after our communication with wwebfor:

> So, wwebfor got back to me. He's done with the project.
> 
> He acknowledged that Laverna doesn't solve issues with synchronization and multiple devices. He suggested that effort would be better spent focusing on other projects that do already. He also didn't give me access to the repo, so I can't do anything directly with it.
> 
> I think his concerns are valid, but I like Laverna and I think it's worth trying to make something out of. I'm going to continue with my plan to fork it and develop it independent of the Laverna organization.
> 
> I've spent the last few weeks trying to familiarize myself with the dev branch and working on minor bugs where I can. It's honestly not in very good shape right now:
> 
> * It looks like the project was in the middle of transitioning into more of a client/server model with the addition of the signal server and MongoDB.  That's not a bad model necessarily for hosting, but it becomes burdensome for standalone end-users who are syncing through dropbox (or not at all).
> * The signal server appears to have been put together with a multi-user environment in mind, and there is the start of some useful features (like sharing between users) but that is incomplete, and I believe actually currently inhibits synchronizing across multiple devices.
> * In spite of the above, https is not enabled by default.
> * The electron-based desktop app version doesn't work.
> * gulp is pretty broken in node 10 due to ancient dependencies.  Supposedly this is getting fixed someday, though the current plan appears to be to force a newer version of the natives package, which is unsupported.  I couldn't find an ETA.
> 
> I'd like to talk more about these problems and get recommendations/help on fixing them. I'm going to replicate this issue on my fork at [daed#1](https://github.com/daed/laverna/issues/1).
> 
> I strongly encourage anyone who feels a vested interest in the project to come discuss, and I would like to warn anyone else that this project, as it exists at the Laverna organization, probably will not be updated any further.

I wish you all the best.

I get a Segmentation fault ('core' generated) when i try to open it in Arch linux. Â¿Anyone knows how can I recover my notes?

I've reinstalled chrome and all my data is lost.

nothing happens when I try to import the json from dropbox:

![Peek 2019-07-28 08-35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6963212/62002707-bb374500-b112-11e9-8a4a-0d0f4462f1bf.gif)


Here's the output of the console, in case it helps. All errors/warnings appear before I import:

This is related to #407 .

Basically, I tried to set up an encryption password but due to #407 I'm locked out.
All I have is the log file which shows data which kind of resembles the content of what I had:
Original: `### Unzipping the file:`
Now: `## #tSpe2  :nUizppni ght eifelF`

Is there any way to recover the data?
@wwebfor it seems like https://laverna.cc is [down](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/laverna.cc.html) for a couple of weeks. Could you help us with that? Where can I donate for the sake of stability of the service?
Title says it all.
