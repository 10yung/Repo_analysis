The drop down banner is obscured by the iPhone X notch.
allow swipe left/right to dismiss


I'm currently using this library with CocoaPods but i'm migrating to Carthage right now, this library has carthage support or any plans to support it?
I am showing user the popup on push notification.
I want user to take immediate action.
I do not want to hide the popup.
I want to keep in on the screen. Unless until user taps on it.
Is it achievable. If yes please guide me how can I do this.
Thanks :)
Greetings,

It would be great if there exists a possibility to customize these numerics:

(lines 17-19 in TWMessageBarManager.m)
``` 
CGFloat const kTWMessageViewBarPadding = 10.0f;
CGFloat const kTWMessageViewIconSize = 36.0f;
CGFloat const kTWMessageViewTextOffset = 2.0f;
```

Real life example: kTWMessageViewBarPadding is too big; value of 5 looks much better in my case.
Of course I can fork it and change it myself, but let me not explain why it is not that nice:)

Thank you! Great control so far.


If integrating through cocoapods using frameworks, it will not load the icon images properly, since `[UIImage imageNamed:@""]` looks at the main bundle.

With this changes it will look at the appropriate bundle and work if using `TWMessageBarManager` from a framework or not
I am using This class to show the banner when my app receive push notification.But if app receive so much push notification , all of sudden banner stops displaying.
