First of all, thanks for a great package!

This is a quick fix that allows `index` to be set to `UISegmentedControl.noSegment`.

Whenever thats the case we hide the `indicatorView`. We also disable animations for going from or to `noSegment`.

Fixes #88, fixes #37 and fixes #10

Thanks again!
When i set the titleView as follows:
```
navigationItem.titleView = viewSegmented
```
Current plan looks like normal text and selected text equal centerY, How to make them equal bottom? looking forward your reply.
Creates a new property 'segmentSpcaing' which is used in the element frame calculation to create horizontal gaps between segments.
This change allows us to synchronize BetterSegmentedControl animations with other components.
Related to #105.
Hello,
I have a question. Is there a way to change the normalTextColor after the segmented control has been created?

Thanks you
I hope to custom indicatorView width and I hope indicatorView width could change with title text width.
Hi,

With the latest version (1.1) I am running in to issues building the project with Carthage.

"error: Build input file cannot be found: '/path/to/xcodeprojectdir/Carthage/Checkouts/BetterSegmentedControl/Example/Pods/Target Support Files/BetterSegmentedControl/BetterSegmentedControl-Info.plist'"

The only .plist file in that directory is "Info.plist" so I guess that needs to be updated somewhere. (Perhaps this is the Xcode migration tool breaking something?)

Thanks,
Geoff


The orignai `SegmentedControl` can accept `.noSegment`, which represents no selection state.
Indices in this library allows `UInt` type but `.noSegment` is a type of `Int` (actually `-1`).
