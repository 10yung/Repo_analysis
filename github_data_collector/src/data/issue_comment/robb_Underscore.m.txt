nil passed to a callee that requires a non-null 1st parameter
Is there any plan for Carthage support?

`Underscore.m (0.2.1)`, which does not support `tvos`.


Added method to `zip` elements passing an array of arrays that returns another array of arrays zipped.
This method only works if all the sub-arrays have the same length (should i add some checks here?)

this:

``` objc
@[@[@1, @2, @3], @[@4, @5, @6], @[@7, @8, @9]]
```

transforms into this:

``` objc
@[@[@1, @4, @7], @[@2, @5, @9], @[@3, @6, @9]]
```

:warning: all the arrays should have the same lenght

I would like to add specs, but can't make the tests run. Always getting this error after pod install:

``` objc
ld: library not found for -lPods-UnderscoreTests-Expecta
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

The documentation for find says: 

``` text
Returns an object from the array **the** passes the test 
```

It should say "array **that** passes the test"

`_.union` is not in Underscore.m, but would be useful.

There are some very useful functions in underscore-contrib that are missing from underscore.js: http://documentcloud.github.io/underscore-contrib/

My plan is to fork Underscore.m and add these methods as I need them, but I wanted to check that you are open to adding functions like these first. Thanks!

It'd be cool to have some inline documentation for both Xcode & CocoaDocs :beer:
