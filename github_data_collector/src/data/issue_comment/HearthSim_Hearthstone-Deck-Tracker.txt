## Bug report

### Expected Behavior
Load HDT with Hearthstone in fullscreen mode on my ultrawide monitor, last known team should display on screen when mousing over individual opponents in battlegrounds.

### Actual Behavior
Most HDT features display as expected, including the Battlegrounds tier list, but the last known teams overlay does not display.  

If I swap to windowed mode and keep the window anything smaller than maximized, the overlay displays as expected.

### Steps to reproduce behavior
Launch HS via HDT on an ultrawide display with 3440x1440 resolution.  

Start a Battlegrounds game, go through turn 1, mouse over your first opponent, and you will not see the last known team displayed.

## Bug report

### Expected Behavior
When attacking the opposing hero, if all other possible targets (non-attacking minions and non-attacking-friendly hero) are immune, HDT should not exclude Misdirection as it doesn't trigger because it has no valid targets.

Ideally we count the valid targets (all non-attacking, non-defending, non-immune entities) and only exclude Misdirection if that count is larger than zero.

### Actual Behavior
When attacking the opposing hero HDT incorrectly excludes Misdirection as a possible secret even if all other possible targets are immune.

### Steps to reproduce behavior
Play against a friend. Have them play Misdirection. Make your hero immune through e.g. "Time Out". Attack the opposing hero with the only minion and observe HDT greying it out.

Every time I start hearthstone deck tracker one of a couple of things happens. Typically I get a message prompting me to run both programs as an administrator because they have different permissions. If not that, then it opens normally and goes into no deck mode, but will not come out of no deck mode unless I close hearthstone. My deck tracker has also stopped updating any new decks I've made. I've done fresh reinstalls and scanned hearthstone for errors. I have confirmed the correct locations for log files and double-checked the permissions of both programs through my antivirus. I have also just disabled the anti-virus. Nothing seems to work. Also, I do not code but can't find any information on this that has been posted recently. This all started when HDT got an update for galakrond interactions and stuff.
### Expected Behavior
<!--- What did you expect to happen? -->
The tooltip reads, "board/hand" yet it only works for minions on the board. Hovering over a card in your hand doesn't cause the flavor text box to show.

## Bug report

Since a few days, probably starting with 1.9.6, HDT no longer works with Wine/Linux.

When I start it up, I only get the "Loading..." splash screen. I can press the "SKIP" button, but this does not change anything (apart from adding an appropriate message to the log).
I took a look at the git repository, but all recent changes look harmless to me. I tried wine 4.20, 4.21, 5.0rc, with and without staging patches. I also killed my wine directory and reinstalled everything, but it still hangs.
Could this be caused by some server changes?

To reproduce:
- Install corefonts and dotnet462
winetricks corefonts
winetricks dotnet462
- Install HDT
wine HDT-Installer.exe
---> Most recent HDT is downloaded, then HDT hangs.

I think a turn timer could be useful for figuring out how powerful you should be on any given turn. You can track the early turns with gold but after 10 gold they start to blur together.  

I recall this was a feature in the original HDT for classic hearthstone so I was thinking maybe this could be done if there's enough interest, for battlegrounds too.

## Bug report

### Expected Behavior
Wins being tracked as wins and losses as losses for statistics when playing ranked standard matches

### Actual Behavior
Both wins and losses recorded as "None" in statistics view for deck

### Steps to reproduce behavior
For me it seems to be for every match played today, same deck recorded wins and losses correctly yesterday

Seems to me looking at the log that it's thinking all matches ended after 0 turns, even tho all but one match completed after several matches, some wins some losses.
