Hi,
Thanks for this pretty library but I have a question.
How can I change title and dropdown icon color?
I need create the ExpandableCardView dynamically, but the function "setInnerView(int resId)" is private.
When the title is too long, it is over the arrow. I know you limit the text length because of another issue created but it's not the solution for all devices. You should modify the layout to end before the arrow image.
Hi, I have 2 cardviews. If I click the first card view, I would like to expand this card view and  to collapse the second card view.
By the same way, if I click the second card view, I would like to expand this card view and to collapse the first card view,

Unfortunately, the card view that I want to collapse **is disappearing from the screen.** and it is not reachable again.
please help me for solving this problem.

card1 = root.findViewById(R.id.x1);
card2 = root.findViewById(R.id.x2);

        card1.setOnExpandedListener(new ExpandableCardView.OnExpandedListener() {
            @Override
            public void onExpandChanged(View v, boolean isExpanded) {
                
                if (isExpanded)
                    card2.collapse();
            }
        });

        card2.setOnExpandedListener(new ExpandableCardView.OnExpandedListener() {
            @Override
            public void onExpandChanged(View v, boolean isExpanded) {
                
                if(isExpanded)
                    card1.collapse();

            }
        });
Hi! Here's my issue: when I click the down arrow to open up the cardview and view my layout that i've inserted inside, the frame rate is quite bad. If I continuously open and close the cardview, it becomes more performant, eventually reaching a smooth 60 fps. 

does anyone know a solution for this?

Thanks!
I added some additional functions so that the expandablecardview can be customized programmatically.

* Customize title text size and text style
* Set custom right indicator drawable or remove it all together
* Programmatically set whether or not the cardview can be expanded 

The new features are also included in the README file.
hi!
I appreciate that you provide this library. ExpandableCardView is definitely useful for me.
But I have a question about clicking to expand.

When I click the arrow_button, the card would be expanded, also when click the title area, it would be expanded. But what I want is only click the arrow_button, and then expanded. but clicking other area would not be expanded. so, could you guys provide me some solution for this issues?

Thanks alot!

Derek


Is it possible to have 2 lines on the title instead of 1? also is it possible to change the color of the arrow that collapses/expands?

WHY????
Added a function to the view that allows for databinding to be setup without exposing the view.
