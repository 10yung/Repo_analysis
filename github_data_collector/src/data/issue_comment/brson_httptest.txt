I was linked to this tutorial from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr5QcYyGrCo). It was great to follow along!

One thing that went wrong, however, are the Routing commands. It seems that newer versions of the `router` crate require `router.get`, `router.post` etc. to be used with [three parameters](https://docs.rs/router/0.5.1/router/), the third one being a symbolic name to refer to the route to later (such as in when using `router::url_for`).


`cargo test` fails for me with this error -

``` bash
running 2 tests
test post_backend ... FAILED
test get_backend ... FAILED

failures:

---- post_backend stdout ----
    thread 'post_backend' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Io(Error { repr: Os { code: 61, message: "Connection refused" } })', ../src/libcore/result.rs:785

---- get_backend stdout ----
    thread 'get_backend' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Io(Error { repr: Os { code: 61, message: "Connection refused" } })', ../src/libcore/result.rs:785
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
```

Am I missing something?  I am running rustup with stable channel -

```
$ cargo -V
cargo 0.11.0-nightly (259324c 2016-05-20)
$ rustc -V
rustc 1.10.0 (cfcb716cf 2016-07-03)
```
