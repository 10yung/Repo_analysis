I install kali on windows 
Prompt error on windows machine 
/usr/bin/python: can't find '__main__' module in 'wifijammer'


I want to jam a 5ghz wifi,.
no matter what i do channel hopping fails because channels 13 and 14 won't activate. is there a way i can make the script skip those channels entirely during channel hopping?
Please provide python 3 support
All that happens is the channels hop and rest of screen stays black doing nothing.

Full error message:

```
Redirecting to /bin/systemctl restart network-manager.service

Failed to restart network-manager.service: Unit network-manager.service not found.
```
I'm on Fedora 28, the problem should be solved by restarting ```NetworkManager.service``` instead of ```network-manager.service```
can you explain how to run wifijammer program step by step

Is it possible to add something like a counter to the Station and the deauthentication list? It would be very useful sometimes.
