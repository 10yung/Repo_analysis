Hi,
Thanks for providing the code.

It seems like the interactive demo is not working. I have everything installed and it looks fine.
But when I click on the foreground object and background, nothing happens.

I saved the mask and it's just a plain red image.

The only thing that I changed was this line in "vis_color.m":
`cmap = uint8(vis.gen_color(21)*255);`

I don't have this function so I used "jet" colormap instead.
Any ideas what's the problem?

Thank you.

Hi.
The dropbox link  is now invalid now~
Could you update a new one?

Hi, Very interesting work. I am wondering when will you release your code?
