It can be useful, i think.

Hi,

I think that the important part in this kind of documentation is connectivity. 
there is not any feature in the PHPIPAM to connect devices together.
i.e I want to know that which port of the switch is connected to my eth0 of router and vice versa.
its better if you can go to a device and take a look can find that which port is connected to where ! 

yours,
Keyvan
**Describe the bug**
I installed PHPIPAM, and to make it clear and starting from scratch I removed all subnets. after removing all subnets, all buttons will disappear from the subnet menu and you do not have "add subnet" and "find subnet" any more

** version 1.4*

Hi,

in my scenario I add a 47u rack. if you go to the rack and add your device it will work properly. but if you go to the device, edit device and choose a rack it will show an error that The rack size is invalid !

Best Regards,
Keyvan
**Request for help using phpIPAM / Misc question?**

Unable to rearrange widgets on the dashboard. When widgets are deactivated they still show on the dashboard showing "Invalid widget".

**phpIPAM version**
v1.5

**Your Environment (please supply the following information):**
 - phpIPAM version: v1.5
 - OS RHEL 7.7
 - PHP version php 5.4.16
 - Webserver Apache
 - Database MariaDB 5.5.64 Stable
**Describe the bug**
When using PingCheck.php it will check status of not discovered devices.

I have some device that are sensitive to ARP request, when a host is unknown to the source it will send out 3 ARP request per host, for my 172 host that is a peak of 300 ARP/s.

A fix can be:
Only add to array if present in database, when doing the excludePing.

This will also reduce traffic overall.

** version**
 - Latest production release [1.4].
 
**My Environment :**
 - phpIPAM version:  1.4
 - OS Debian 10 64bit

**Steps To Reproduce**

1. Add a subnet without host.
2. Run PingCheck.php 
3. check output.

One of the features I like is the ability to create racks and populate these racks with devices. 
We can see a summary of the racks per location - again a cool feature.
 
What would be the icing on the cake if we could create Data Halls. I'm thinking that you could adopt the same sort of thing that you use in editing openstreetmaps for adding missing places?

The data hall would also include suite lines & cabs

Just a thought...
Hello,

I am working on a task to install open source IPAM solution for one of the projects in Facebook and I successfully installed phpIPAM on Ubuntu 18.04 with the latest version of PHP, Apache2 and MariaDB. I can login into phpIPAM and added a single device for testing. When I key in SNMP parameters under "Manage SNMP" - I am getting Fatal error: sendto (invalid argument).

What I did so far:
All though I downloaded Cisco MIBs under /usr/share/snmp/mibs path and I couldn't find solution to this issue. 

Can someone help to provide inputs/solution to this problem?


Thank you,
Raghunath

I have a use-case where I need to take certain actions upon subnet creation/edit/removal (one being updating inetnum's in RIPE DB). So I was wondering if there is any plugin support where I could hook my own plugin to certain events, or if there's message queue support or similar so that I can listen on events and act upon those as needed.

From what I can figure out myself I would right now have these options:
* Mail notifications and parse the emails
* Syslog parsing
* Putting triggers in the database to feed a database of my own with changes
* Extending phpipam myself with support for sending events (with structured data) somewhere

I thought I'd ask here first though since I figured I couldn't be the only one with this need?
