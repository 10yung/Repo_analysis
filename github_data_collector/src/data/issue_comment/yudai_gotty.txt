# When file a bug report (see below for feature requests)

Please answer these quesions for a bug report. Thanks!

### What version of GoTTY are you using (`gotty --version`)?

```gotty version 1.0.1```

### What operating system and browser are you using?

Ubuntu

### What did you do?

```
 TMUX= ./gotty   -w --port 9999 --reconnect --timeout 0 tmux new-session  -A -s WEBONLY -d
```

I believe this ought to create (or attach) to session `WEBONLY` and detach others. However: if I open two or more browser tabs to the site, one has its size changed arbitrarily until I close all but one


If possible, please provide the command you ran.


### What did you expect to see?

When I open another tab, the previous gets disconnected as would happen if did multiple ssh sessions attaching to the same tmux session

### What did you see instead?
Screen redraws 

If possible, please provide the output of the command and your browser's console output.
