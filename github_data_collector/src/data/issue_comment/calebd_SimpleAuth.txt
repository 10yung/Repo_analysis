Hello, 
As soon as I add 'SimpleAuth/Instagram' and do 'pod install', xcode gives me these 2 errors. Can someone help please?

Error Domain=SimpleAuthErrorDomain Code=102 "(null)" UserInfo={NSUnderlyingError=0x174049d50 {Error Domain=com.apple.accounts Code=6 "(null)"}}

Why i have this error?
please have a look at this thread

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40168448/swift-3-how-to-solve-ambiguous-use-of-authorize-completion/40169747#40169747

the compiler in xcode 8, using swift 3 throws an error, if you want to use the following func:

`open class func authorize(_ provider: String!, completion: SimpleAuth.SimpleAuthRequestHandler!)`

problem is the following function:

`open class func authorize(_ provider: String!, options: [AnyHashable : Any]! = [:], completion: SimpleAuth.SimpleAuthRequestHandler!)`

because of `= [:]`

I have just implemented SimpleAuth for Instagram, had to login and needed about 10 minutes to reset my PW since I didn't knew it anymore... I don't want to lose customers with the same issue... 

Is it possible to check, if the Instagram App is installed and make the auth request with the app?
In Swift please.

Help is very appreciated.

So the `parameters` dictionary in the `initialRequest` method of `SimpleAuthFoursquareWebLoginViewController` keeps throwing the following error:

`
*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[__NSPlaceholderDictionary initWithObjects:forKeys:count:]: attempt to insert nil object from objects[0]'
`

When I hardcode the values of `parameters` with my own `client_id` and `redirect_uri` everything works as expected. So it looks like the problem lies in retrieving the dictionary that is passed to `SimpleAuth.configuration[@"foursquare-web"]`; that is, `self.options[@"client_id"]` and `self.options[SimpleAuthRedirectURIKey]` are both returning `nil` values.

Thanks

SimpleAuth.configuration[@"twitter"] = @{@"consumer_key": @"xxxxx", @"consumer_secret": @"xxxsssssssswwww" };

[SimpleAuth authorize:provider completion:^(id responseObject, NSError *error) {
        NSLog(@"\nResponse: %@\nError:%@", responseObject, error);
    }];
output:
Response: (null)
Error:Error Domain=SimpleAuthErrorDomain Code=102 "(null)" UserInfo={NSUnderlyingError=0x7fa8ab896460 {Error Domain=com.apple.accounts Code=6 "(null)"}}

Some new users don't have the google+ url yet that might crash the app. It should be check in 

```
- (NSDictionary *)dictionaryWithAccount:(NSDictionary *)account
                            credentials:(NSDictionary *)credentials

if(user[@"urls"]) {
user[@"urls"] = @{
                      @"Google +" : account[@"link"],
                      };
}
```

Seeing this issue when attempting to use the Instagram provider:

```
WebKit discarded an uncaught exception in the webView:decidePolicyForNavigationAction:request:frame:decisionListener: delegate: <NSInvalidArgumentException> -[__NSCFString hasPrefix:]: nil argument
```

Fairly positive I'm using the library correctly (Obviously using my real consumer key and secret):

```
        SimpleAuth.configuration()["instagram"] = [
            "consumer_key": "<CONSUMER_KEY>",
            "consumer_secret": "<CONSUMER_SECRET>"
        ]

        SimpleAuth.authorize("instagram") { responseObject, error in
            print( \(responseObject))
        }
```

The view controller that should show the web view pointed at the Instagram login page is presenting but not loading. The crash seems to happen in the `-isTargetRedirectURL:` method specifically on the line that calls `-hasPrefix:`.

Would appreciate any help on this issue.
