wget , p7zip , squashfs tools or unsquashfs..

least for docker one could abuse these in various ways. 
* proot -- static binaries available for aarch64, x86_64, but not armv7 etc..

* fakeroot

* tiny c compiler -- if it can be compiled statically, think can be used to build an educational lightweight tool for learning C on android and other mobile platforms, besides other possibilities.. What about a trimmed down gcc and a qemu without exotic architectures?
Thanks.
I follow the guide from README.MD

```
cd FOO
docker build -t static-binaries-FOO .
docker run -v `pwd`/../binaries:/output static-binaries-FOO
```

but only linux version compiled.
could u help me hand this out ?
Please
