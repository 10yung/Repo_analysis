Thanks for trying out GhostText and opening this issue!

Before opening an issue for a possible bug,
please make sure you try GhostText in Chrome and Sublime Text.
This is the most common configuration and will help me
understand better where the problem is.

If it works with Sublime Text but not with a third party editor,
please open an issue in their repository.

# Setup

Browser: Firefox
Editor: Neovim

# Description
On Overleaf, the text in the editing area in source mode (an editing mode on Overleaf, you basically edit the LaTeX source code directly without any fancy stuff) syncs only one-way to my editor but not the other way around. The issue doesn't exist in Chrome.

# Reproduction
Head over to Overleaf, open an account, open a new document, and activate GhostText in the editing area with Firefox. Repeat the same steps with Chrome (perhaps without opening another account unless you want to for unspecified reasons) and compare.

# Setup

Browser: Firefox 64.0 on Ubuntu 18.04
Editor: Emacs 25.2.2

# Description

When I preview my edits on a Trac wiki using GhostText in Firefox,
GhostText gets confused. I have tested in Firefox with both Emacs and
Sublime Text, and they have the same problem, so I think it's an issue
with GhostText. Also, have tested in Chrome with both Emacs and
Sublime Text and I don't have this issue, so I think it's an issue
with Firefox+GhostText specifically.

The issue is a little hard to describe, but it's easy to reproduce. To
reproduce, go to the Trac demo wiki at

https://trac.edgewall.org/demo-1.3

and choose "Edit this page", which will take you to

https://trac.edgewall.org/demo-1.3/wiki/WikiStart?action=edit

Now don't edit, just click on "Preview Page", which will take you to a
preview at

https://trac.edgewall.org/demo-1.3/wiki/WikiStart

Now scroll up, select the text area with the wiki source, and start
GhostText. GhostText will connect correctly and you can start
editing. Makes some changes to the wiki source with your editor via
GhostText, and then click on "Preview Page" again. The page will
reload at

https://trac.edgewall.org/demo-1.3/wiki/WikiStart

again, with your changes rendered.

Now, **the problem**: the text area is no longer connected to
GhostText, but the corresponding buffer in the editor is still
open. If you make changes in the editor, nothing happens. If you click
on the GhostText icon now, it closes the buffer in the editor and you
lose your changes. Finally, if you click on the GhostText icon a
second time GhostText opens a new buffer, and you can edit again, but
your intermediate changes are still lost.

That's with Firefox. With Chrome, GhostText closes the buffer in your
editor as soon as you click on "Preview Page", so there is no
confusion, and no chance to lose your changes. Note that *It's All
Text!* did even better with these Trac previews: it could keep the
same buffer open across all "Preview Page" clicks, so you didn't have
to load a new buffer after each prview, and you didn't lose your
cursor position in the buffer each time. (Nevertheless, your plugin
seems better than *It's All Text!* for most things, e.g. it does
better on GitHub previews, and can edit the magic compose box in
GMail. Thanks!!!)
Would you be interested in a PR providing a simple API for other extensions to activate GhostText?

It wouldn't have to be anything like as complex as Tree Style Tab's - https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/API-for-other-addons - but that should give you an idea as to what I'm talking about.

I'm asking particularly so Tridactyl users can roll their own #113 using our own keybinding mechanism.

# Setup

Browser: Chrome: Version 71.0.3578.98 (Official Build) (64-bit)
Editor: Sublime text Version 3.1.1 Build 3176

# Description
Love Ghost Text!  I do have an issue where it will sometimes not work depending on the code that is in the text box.

When this happens, I get the following error briefly at the bottom of sublime:
Line 1, Column 1; ghostText - Invalid JSON:, Unterminated string starting at: line 1 column 9(char 8), Traceback(most recent call last)

Rename attached file to .html, and it will have a text box that does not work (for me at least).

Thanks!



Webstorm support would be great.

# Description
It doesn't work on Freecodecamp.
When I click on the button, it successfully copies the content of the Textarea to the editor and says it is connected... which is great, but it is not able to edit the code contained therein when I try to edit it through the editor.

The editor used by Freecodecamp: Monaco Editor by Microsoft

# Setup

Browser: Chrome
Editor: macvim

# Description

clicking on the ghosttext icon to launch ghosttext in tiddlywiki doesn't seems to have any effect.

# Setup

Browser: Firefox
Editor: N/A

# Description

It would be nice to be able to start editing a text area by right-clicking and selecting an appropriate option from the context menu. I'm used to doing this with It's All Text.

This could also save having to deal with the "there are multiple text areas" popup, since it should know which text area the context menu is for.
This adds a few features and fixes several long-standing bugs

Missing:

- [x] Show user notifications
- [x] Support more than textareas

## Introduction
I just started using GhostText, and I really like the fact that I can finally use my Vim (:heart:) within Firefox (with extensions, even! :tada:)  

In fact, I'm writing this very text using GhostText :smiley:  

For my work I have to work in ServiceNow, which uses CodeMirror fields for code input.
Sadly, this does not work as expected.

Linking GhostText to my editor seems to work just fine, and the contents of the field are visible and transferred to my editor.
But changes I make from within my editor are not synced back to the browser. However, changes I make in the browser are synced to my editor.

This is also the case when I tried the example editors on the CodeMirror homepage ([e.g. simple scrollbars example](http://codemirror.net/demo/simplescrollbars.html)).

Since I saw CodeMirror mentioned on the Add-On page, I assumed it was already fully supported, hence this bugreport.

I would really like to use this to develop :blush:
