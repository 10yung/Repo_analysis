Title Header of Table section is gone when I scroll tableView upward. 
Could I turn it back to the sticky header like the pure UITableView works?
Section Index Title Bar problem is same. 
Thanks for reading my issue.

Repro steps:

Set the title of the nav bar, and scroll up slowly. The title flickers.

Nav bar sets the alpha of the bar whenever the nav bar size changes.
Without setting this, Xcode can get confused when pulling the pod into
your project.
* Update to latest Xcode project settings
* Add @objc to function used in a target-action
Hello this is a great library. I have used this on my project. In my view controller i have a collectionView and above the collectionView there is the extensionView and above that there is navigationBar, in the collectionView there is textview in every cell. now when i am trying to show the keyboard, and want to hide the keyboard the extensionView is coming down and there is seeing a black space between the extensionView and Navigation bar. Some one please help me in this matter. 
When I installed  Hide Navigation Bar in iOS 11 my whole app screen gone blank as soon as I removed the integration all screens are intact now.
How to hide only extension view instead of both navigation bar and extension view?
If you using HidingNavigationBarManager in controller witch is in array "viewControllers" of UITabBarController, you will have a huge white offset in the bottom of scroll.

Reason of such offset is unreal bottom offset value. It's become bigger and bigger during you are scrolling.

I found reason of this bug - this issues becomes visible when "scrollView.contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior" set to any other value than ".never". If you set "never", content of scrollView goes under tabBar and navigationBar - so it is bad solution. I opened source code if library and found 3 lines of code that do this bug.

If you comment this 3 lines - there aren't huge white offset no more, in the top everything is great on iPhone X and traditional iPhones. Only issue - now there is 49 points of gap for tab bar. 

So I see 2 solutions:
1. Recalculate bottom offset same way like you do "top = adjustTopInset(top)".
2. Show tab bar when you at the bottom of scroll view.

P.S. #1 Something strange is going on this piece of code:

P.S. #2 My quick fix was add this code at  "func handleScrolling()"
   if scrollView.contentSize.height - scrollView.contentOffset.y < scrollView.frame.size.height {
       UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.2, animations: {
           _ = self.tabBarController?.expand()
       })
   }
