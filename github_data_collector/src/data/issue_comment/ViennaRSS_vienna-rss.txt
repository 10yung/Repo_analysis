Often times I will want to mark the current article unread and move to the next using the "next unread" command.  However, this command marks the current article read before moving to the next unread.  This occurs regardless of what I have set for the "Mark current article read" setting.

Workaround is to use arrow keys or mouse to move to the next unread instead of the next unread command.  A proper fix would not update the current article's read state if it has been changed manually by the user while that article is selected.

Version 3.5.5 :817110fe: (7130)

Eventually we can replace Travis with GitHub workflows.
Replaces #1275 
[Sparkle 1.21](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/releases/tag/1.21.0) and newer has a different signature scheme than before (ed25519 instead of DSA). For this, Sparkle has created helper tools based on a portable [ed25519 library](https://github.com/orlp/ed25519) to create and sign the releases. The previous scheme is deprecated, but both schemes can be used simultaneously.

I have found that the OpenSSL implementation is a bit flaky. I haven’t been able to generate an identical signature using the existing private key. There are many GitHub issues on the Sparkle repo about this. It has been suggested that the OpenSSL libraries in macOS are to blame. 
From time to time when I click on a headline the article starts playing audio in the internal browser.

Is there any way to disable the audio?

If not, then please add this as a feature request.

Vienna 3.5.4 :8b11d92d:
Java Script off for internal browser.
Plugins disabled for the internal browser.

Sometimes, when the app has been idle in the background (and hidden, I think) part of the feed-list side bar is not repainted at all leaving blank gaps where feed ought to be. Click in the blank part and some feeds reappear, scroll down/up another blank area, and so on.

I _think_ the issue happens more often when the selected folder is a smart folder.

Vienna latest release, vertical layout, 10.15 Catalina (seen across the various 10.15 releases).
About 150 feeds of which over half are dormant (not actually subscribed).
(MacBookAir 2018).

The issue did not happen before. No other app exhibits anything similar.

a screenshot (taken under 10.15.0):

Although somewhat similar, my issue is a bit different than:
https://github.com/ViennaRSS/vienna-rss/issues/1265#issue-487730268

When viewing a post from any of my subscriptions the unread count does not change after reading a post. Even when a post is deleted the count doesn't change.

Manually marking each subscription as read will update the count. But is rather annoying.

After a restart the program will work as expected for a few minutes.

MacOs 10.11.6

macOS Mojave (10.14.5 and newer) and macOS Catalina require [notarisation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution?language=objc) in addition to code-signing to pass Gatekeeper. At this point, new releases of Vienna have to be notarised, otherwise users will have to manually override Gatekeeper, which can discourage them from using the app in the first place.

After looking a bit at the code-signing and release process of Vienna I believe that the process is complex (lots of different parts within large shell scripts), restrictive (seems to work only in command-line and not Xcode) and not really open for others to use (e.g. code-signing is coupled with Sparkle and the upload to repos). On top of that, the process is not yet capable of producing notarised copies, which will require some work if it is to be included in the process and not done manually afterwards.

I think simplifying the process could ensure that others are able to sign and release new versions in the future and that we could set up a process for nightly/weekly builds for people to test.

I have already simplified the build process a little bit (#1257) by merging the build targets. More can be done, such as:
- Separating the build scripts by their purpose (versioning, building, signing, uploading)
- Reducing reliance on third-party tools such as Autorevision (which could be done manually and by Apple’s own `agvtool` (bundled with Xcode build tools)
- Making sure that most parts work well in `xcodebuild` as well as Xcode and relying on Xcode’s code-signing tools
Hello guys,

I love vienna-rss, but since I am using two different devices (iMac and macbook pro) I would love to have an iCloud sync, so that both computers share the same last state with each other.

Would it be possible to add this feature to the app roadmap?

Thanks a lot
Stefan
Version 3.5.4 :8b11d92d: (7074)

How to reproduce:

1. Have a subscription/subject selected and an article displaying.
2. Choose a different subscription without selecting any articles.
3. Return to previous subscription and select the originally selected article.
4. Article will not display.
i am using version 3.5.4 :8b11d92d: (7074) and articles are never marked as read. regardless whether i explicitly choose to "mark as read" or even after a short delay (while reading the article).

if it is importent, i am using theoldreader synchronization feature.
