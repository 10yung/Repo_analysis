In DebugView, ProcessPhoenix.triggerRebirth seems to kill the process too fast.
On my device, the SharedPreference won't get set, so I can't change the endpoint from the DebugView.
It's only used in DebugApiModule.
I got an error when run app! It showed could not find symbol. symbol:  variable nullL, in u2020-master/app/src/internalDebug/java/com/jakewharton/u2020/ui/debug/DebugView.java

Or, maybe as a switch in the debug drawer?

The debug drawer currently shows the available screen size, rather than the full screen size — it's useful to be able to see both. Also, show these sizes in dp as well as px, as these are the units we work in more often.

Setting endpoint to custom with value that is not parseable (e.g "saffga") will make the app crash. It will crash on every consequent startup until the app data is cleared.
The reason is that the user inputed string is saved to `@ApiEndpoint` String preference, which is later read by `provideHttpUrl` method in `DebugApiModule`. The method tries to parse the String into `HttpUrl` but invalid Strings are parsed to `null` value. When `null` `HttpUrl` is provided as a base url when building retrofit instance, the app will crash.

Fix: Make sure user provided custom URL is parseable. Additional validation is required when custom endpoint is set by the user(within `DebugView`, check if it is parseable by `HttpUrl.parse()` method). I've made pull request for this but I guess I'm not allowed to push anything to this repo.

Aside from the obvious of just writing a test that's meaningful, consider demoing:
- Controlling mock mode from the test.
- Robots pattern.

We need an after-creation mechanism for the graph.
