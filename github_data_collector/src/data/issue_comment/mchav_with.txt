The `-h`/`--help` flag is broken:
```
$ with -h
/usr/bin/with: line 46: print_help: command not found
error: "-h" is not a valid executable
``` 
Looking at the source, I believe that line 46 should be calling `print_usage` and/or `print_options`, not `print_help` (which doesn't exist).

Bash has different absolute paths for things like tmp and completion. Fixing this would entail finding out if we are in linux bash or windows bash...now sure how this is possible for now.
On my Debian 8.6, with would not work on any program, giving the `error: Program     is not installed` message. This happened on both bash and fish shells.

It seems that you missed a `"$@"` in the last line, and parameters are not passed to your script.

I changed the last line from `main` to `main "$@"` and things started working again. I am not sure if there are side-effects, as a result I posted this as an issue so more people could help.

@Joaquin-V has a PR for this. I think this warrants some discussion though.

As mentioned in #15 

Run shell check with environment set to sh for specifics on what needs to go.  


Using appveyor and/or travis.

I downloaded the script, run it on my Ubuntu 16.04 laptop and get

```
$ with ls
/home/ulysses/bin/with: 12: /home/ulysses/bin/with: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "fi")
```

with `with ls` i don't see the coloured folders. it'd be nice to somehow retain the colouring.
