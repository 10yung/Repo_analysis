I am using Street Complete in an area where I added all the ways and roads some 5 Months ago however they still don't show up an the map in the background. The quests the app is showing me are fine. How often does the map get updated? Or is there maybe a bug. If not I would suggest to update the map data more frequent.
The app treats metered WiFis like any other WiFi connection instead of treating them as mobile data.

**How to Reproduce**
1. In settings, change **Auto-sync** to **Only on WiFi**.
1. Connect to a metered WiFi.
1. Answers will get auto synced.

 The [isActiveNetworkMetered](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager.html#isActiveNetworkMetered()) check is what's missing.

After some time using the app, all quests domeyime disappear . none is shown. 

it generally happens after completing a quest : all other icons disappear from the screen and no quest can be looked for. requesting more quests doesn't help.

most often quests reappear after a random time (sometimes over 15 minutes). it's indeed very frustrating as nothing can be done until quests reappear more or less magically

### General
Affected tag(s) to be modified/added: [brand:wikidata](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:brand:wikidata), [not:brand:wikidata](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:not:brand:wikidata) (these are the main tags, amenity, leisure, cuisine, shop, etc. can all also be updated as driven by the [Name Suggestion Index](https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index)).
Question asked: **Is this location part of the X brand?**

### Checklist
Checklist for quest suggestions (see guidelines):
- [x] üöß To be added tag is established and has a useful purpose:
  - Distinguishes brand locations explicitly thanks to unique QID
  - Standardises other related brand tagging per brand (as taken from NSI)
  - The only caveat here is that the tag `not:brand:wikidata` is [not currently widely used](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/not%3Abrand%3Awikidata), however I would appeal to the fact that `not:` is an established prefix and the iD editor already checks for this tagging to prevent false positive brand tag suggestions
- [x] ü§î Any answer the user can give must have an equivalent tagging (Quest should not reappear to other users when solved by one):
  - If it is the brand, `brand:wikidata` prevents future quests
  - If it's not the brand but the `name` is correct `not:brand:wikidata` explicitly marks this
  - If it's not the brand and the `name` is not correct then updating the name prevents the quest reappearing
- [x] üêøÔ∏è Easily answerable by everyone from the outside but a survey is necessary 
- [x] üí§ Not an overwhelming percentage of elements have the same answer (No spam)
- [x] üïì Applies to a reasonable number of elements (Worth the effort)

### Ideas for implementation

This quest type would be similar to brand tagging upgrades suggested by iD, so the behind the scenes implementation could really be [along the same lines as done there](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/blob/a760a8f8198e2a3138629da7d7989d3a626706e0/modules/validations/outdated_tags.js#L88-L118).

I'm not too familiar with android development or Kotlin, but if you can use the javascript package directly then you could even [use the provided matcher like iD does](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/blob/a760a8f8198e2a3138629da7d7989d3a626706e0/modules/validations/outdated_tags.js#L2). Otherwise I suppose it would need to be re-written in a suitable language to see the same behaviour.

**Element selection:** 

Elements tagged matching the categories present in the NSI (shop, leisure, amenity, etc.) Then check for fuzzy matches against the name tag (NSI provides `matchNames` for alternate possible names that could be the brand).

**Metadata needed:** 

I believe all metadata needed is available from the Name Suggestion Index (country codes specifying where a brand is present if it isn't global, alternate possible names and taggings, the tags that should be added to the brand). If anything needed can provided in a structure that's more convenient then that could probably be arranged too by opening up an issue to ask.

**Proposed GUI:**

A simple 3 possible answers question:
- Yes this is the brand location in question
  - Adds `brand:wikidata` tag
- No, but the name is the same
  - Adds `not:brand:wikidata` tag
- No, the name is different
  - User is prompted to input the new name
    - Check again if the name still fuzzy matches the brand
      - If yes: add `not:brand:wikidata`
      - If no: update the `name` tag

Could show the brand logo if available alongside the question, I know that google maps does this when asking users if POIs are a brand location.

I am pretty sure in the past the roof shape quest had constant sort order. 
In one of the latest update it changed to "recent used order". 
The old, stable sorting was better IMO since I knew the first one was `gabled` and could select it without double checking.

Does the current version push internal osm messages from other osm-members to the StreetComplete app user (before and even while an edit session)?
Like messages which are send via system https://www.openstreetmap.org/message/new/westnordost

The background of this question is, can i reach a 100% SteetComplete-editor-user via the osm-internal message system beside any email app tools? If not, please implement such an option to do so.

I thing the iD- and JOSM-editor are showing users, when new internal osm messages are received.

Have some quests displayed on the map. Go to the settings, switch to dark mode, go back. The quests are now gone.
The GPS precision is not infinite and the app displays it as usual with a blue circle around the current position. The issue is that the size of this blue circle is not properly updated when zooming in and out. In other words, the scale of the blue circle doesn‚Äôt seem to be the same than the scale of the map: it seems to be in the scale of the previous zoom setting, bot the current one.

**How to Reproduce**
I think that the simplest way to visualise the bug is through these two screens. These two screens are almost identical expect by the size of the blue circle:

![Screenshot_2019-12-14-15-02-23-793_de westnordost streetcomplete](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1829786/70861523-f3ef8380-1f26-11ea-93e0-46c3b134d3b8.jpg)
I can switch from the big blue circle to the small blue circle by pressing through the ‚Äú-‚Äù zoom button, then the ‚Äú+‚Äù zoom button. To switch from the small blue circle to the big circle, I can press the ‚Äú+‚Äù zoom button followed by the ‚Äú-‚Äù zoom button. I can do this consistently: this is not a GPS issue. Actually, I can switch off my GPS and let the phone rely on the Wifi positioning approximation and the result stays the same (it was actually the case in these screenshots): pressing ‚Äú-‚Äù followed by ‚Äú+‚Äù makes the circle bigger, and pressing ‚Äú+‚Äù followed by ‚Äú-‚Äù makes the circle smaller.

**Versions affected**
15.0

**How to Reproduce**
Reinstall app, gave it a location permission, go to settings, disable all quests except one type, exit settings.

Now, after quests load sometimes disabled quests are shown (sadly, not always, in about 1/3 or 1/4 cases).

Closing app and opening it shows only enabled quests.
