I was curious if there were any security recommendations running code server on a server with important data.

1. Should we avoid running it as the root user? I ran into issues when trying to run it as www-data.
2. Is there any protection in place against brute-force on the login screen?
3. Is there any known technique to integrate this with an existing web application's authentication system?
4. How big of a liability is it to have a password in an environment variable set by systemd?

Currently, I have the password on code-server set up and running by systemd as root, but I also have it behind an Apache reverse proxy with basic http authentication. Is this a good idea?

Thanks!
This is extremely minor and dumb, but can the tag for the 2.1698 release be updated to match previous tag syntax that includes the VS Code version?  If so, the tag should be **2.1698-vsc1.41.1**

I teach a course using GCP where I have students install code-server in their Cloud Shell and I used the [excellent step-by-step guide in this article](https://medium.com/google-cloud/how-to-run-visual-studio-code-in-google-cloud-shell-354d125d5748) to build my tutorials.

Now that the tag doesn't include the full version, the article and the scripts break.

Thank you in advance for your consideration!

I'm on a Ubuntu 16.04 machine using code-server binary. Even after shutting down the machine, code-server seems to remember which folders were open (which is a good thing). I'm wondering where code-server keeps this information so that I can clear it routinely.
- `code-server` version: 1.39.2
- OS Version: iOS 13

## Description
The browser doesn't matter, I confirm Safari/Firefox/Chrome.

### Korean input bug
Korean is a combination letter. (ㄱ + ㅏ -> 가, ㄴ + ㅏ -> 나)
When entering Korean in the code-server, all the processing of combinations will be input.
It means, When I input 가나, It will be input like this: ㄱ가간나

### Keyboard not shown bug
When I dismiss the keyboard in the edit window, the keyboard does not appear when you press other letters in the edit window.
The keyboard comes up again when I change the scope by pressing a different menu or window.


### Menu button bug
This bug not only iOS but also Mac safari.
Each time I press the top left menu button, the menu button moves up and never return.

## Description
I am running code-server with multi-tenancy and would like to know when to kill the users containers after a period of inactivity. I am using the heartbeat file that code-server touch's every minute for this. 

I would like to know on what basis does code-server decides to touch the heartbeat, i.e what are the conditions that code-server decide as activity and inactivity.
