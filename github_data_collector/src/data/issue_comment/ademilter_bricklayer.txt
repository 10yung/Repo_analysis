Title: Pathways College Finder

This is a senior design project that will be used by the company SCALE. The server provided will go down in June, but sometime later the app will be redeployed elsewhere. When more colleges are added to our database, the true benefits of bricklayer can be seen. After hours of playing with bootstrap card columns and decks, bricklayer was the easy choice and huge time saver. 
Hello guys,

Hello — bricklayer working OK in this preview site :: https://gresfordarchitects.co.uk/projects

**But** Chrome is giving a strange 'flash' of a large content item each time the page is accessed... (try clicking the 'project' button several times... this issue seems specific to Chrome...


Any clues as to what this might be?!

thanks
for certain scenarios, 
besides append and prepend, 
one may want to remove an element
and all the other elements to redraw to fill in the gaps...

enhanced the demo as well with remove on click

Hi, 

I use bricklayer in my final term project, but there is a distracting problem when the Internet speed is slow. Here're the photos. I hope you will get the problem from screenshots... :innocent:

Bricklayer doesn't work unless `style-src: 'unsafe-inline'` is allowed because of [bricklayer.ts#L42-L48](https://github.com/ademilter/bricklayer/blob/master/src/bricklayer.ts#L42-L48).
I didn't get into any issues applying standard `style` properties:
```
this.element.style.display = 'block';
this.element.style.visibility = 'hidden !important';
this.element.style.top = '-1000px !important';
var width = this.element.offsetWidth;
this.element.style.display = '';
this.element.style.visibility = '';
this.element.style.top = '';
```
Hi!

How can I change the value of .bricklayer-column-sizer with jQuery dynamically?
I need to show an item 100% wide

regards,
