```kotlin
container.prepareTransition {}
container.prepareAutoTransition {}
```

These two extensions both return Unit - which is not that helpful when you want for example, to add some listeners to Transition.

So I'm using TransitionSetBuilder directly now:

```kotlin
typealias TransitionBuilder =
    TransitionSetBuilder<TransitionSet>.() -> Unit

private fun prepare(
    builder: TransitionBuilder = {}
): Transition {
    return TransitionSetBuilder<TransitionSet>(AutoTransition())
        .apply(builder).transition
        .apply { TransitionManager.beginDelayedTransition(sceneRoot, this) }
}
```

It would be great if library supports this.
