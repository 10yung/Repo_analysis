Suggestions from @ahsonkhan

The following search strings would be common:

&lt;verb&gt;[ing] from &lt;permutations of names used to refer to old library&gt; to &lt;permutations of names used to refer to new library&gt;

&lt;verb&gt; - migrate/migrating, port/porting, switch/switching, convert/converting, update/updating, upgrade/upgrading, etc.  Focus especially on update/upgrade.
&lt;permutations of names used to refer to old library&gt; - newtonsoft, newtonsoft.json, json.net
&lt;permutations of names used to refer to new library&gt; - system.text.json, text.json, .net core, .net core 3, built-in JSON, framework JSON library

Some examples:

migrate from newtonsoft to system.text.json - first hit
migrate from json.net to system.text.json - first hit

port from newtonsoft to system.text.json - not found on page 1 - can we fix this, "port" is a common term?
port from json.net to system.text.json - not found on page 1 - can we fix this, "port" is a common term?

switching from newtonsoft to system.text.json - first hit
switching from json.net to system.text.json - second hit

converting from newtonsoft to system.text.json - third hit
converting from json.net to system.text.json - not found on page 1

It should be noted in the 'Controlling Serialization' section that you need to include the `using System.Text.Json.Serialization` statement before you add the `[JsonPropertyName]` attribute.
