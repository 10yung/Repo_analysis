`videoConfiguration` might be nil when I start an audio streaming by 
```
_session = [[LFLiveSession alloc] initWithAudioConfiguration:[LFLiveAudioConfiguration defaultConfiguration] videoConfiguration:nil captureType:LFLiveCaptureMaskAudio];
```
直播过程偶现视频流闪屏问题，不同平台和设备播放同时闪屏

iphoneXR推流 直接报错ERROR: PILI_RTMP_ReadPacket, failed to read PILI_RTMP packet header
iphone6s可以推

I was wondering if we could play RTMP stream instead of just streaming out from this library?

Thanks
I have set the settings to portrait only in deployment info, but not when i set the outputImageOrientation to .LandscapeLeft, when the phone is in portrait, the video on the iphone screen is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, however the data that is sent to the stream is portrait. WHen i rotate my phone landscape left, the data that is sent to the rtmp stream is also in landscape which is what I want however, the video on my phone is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. how do i fix this error? I want my iphone to display wahtever is being sent to the RTMP server..
开始为音视频推流，直播过程中切换成仅视频推流，可以么
At first, I want to say thank you for this awesome library.

I found a little bug
When I set the watermark screen blinks. In my case, it's really annoying for the users because I have to refresh watermark every second (my watermark is something like sport widget with timer)
Could you provide an update so the screen won't blink when a watermark is updated?

Thanks
Added OpenSSL and modified PILI_RTMP @webdeutschland solution.
