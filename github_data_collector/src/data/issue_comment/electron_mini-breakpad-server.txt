Hi,

I've tried to compile the latest master having latest node.js and npm (or at least that's what Ubuntu 16.04 says).
Any suggestion would be much appreciated.

[npm-debug.txt](https://github.com/electron/mini-breakpad-server/files/1298723/npm-debug.txt)

I setup the server and make it running successfully, and I add the config in electron to send crash report to this address, then I use `process.crash()` to fire a crash manually. Now I can see `xxx.dmp` file generated in tmp folder, but when I open `localhost:1127`, I can only see the "Crash Reports" title on the page, no report list.
Windows 10
node -v 6.9.2
npm -v 3.10.6

I was able to get passed this by specifying minidump@0.11.0 in package.json
Hi,

I'd like to add some custom fields to the crash report such as a log file.

For this, I want to add a new route at `/view/:id/:field` to view the contents of that field because the log file will be rather large.

Are you interested in this change?
Hey, I run the `mini-breakpad-server` on my server and it's collecting the reports correctly from my Electron app, however I don't know how to create breakpad symbols (for windows, OSX, Linux) to work with my Electron app, could you give me a hint please? thanks 

Hi, this package looks like it could be useful for others. Please publish it to npm. I know 0.1.0 is already published, but the install fails because minidump 0.1.1 doesn't exist on npm:

```
$ npm install mini-breakpad-server
