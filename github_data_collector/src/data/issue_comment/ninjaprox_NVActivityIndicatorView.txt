This has been requested before (See #29). 

Is there a means for tuning the animation speed? I tried the `layer.speed = 0.5`, but that stopped the animation.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Wellington
Made this small fix to get this working in Xcode 10.2. We are using Carthage and we couldn't deploy our project because `NVActivityIndicatorView` and the extension had same bundle identifier.
import UIKit
import NVActivityIndicatorView
import Foundation

class Loading: UIViewController, NVActivityIndicatorViewable {

    func startProgress() {
        
        let size = CGSize(width: 30, height: 30)
        let color = UIColor.blue

        let type = NVActivityIndicatorType.ballScale
        let message = "Loading"

        startAnimating(size, message:message, type:type, color:color)
    }

    func stopProgress() {
        self.stopAnimating()
    }

}
Want to add a rectangle/square view below indicator view to stop blending it into my views background design and I don't want to use full screen background to hide the design.  I have used UIColor.white.withAlphaComponent(0.01) as background color.  Let me know if you need screenshot.
This adds support for SwiftPM manifest based dependency managers. Specifically this adds support for installing via [Accio](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio) but will probably also work with SwiftPM once it's integrated into Xcode.

Please note that this project is part of Accio's official [integration tests](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio/tree/work/1000-frameworks/Demo/Shared/AppDependencies) within the [Demo project](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio/tree/work/1000-frameworks/Demo).
Hi,

is it possible to set up the NVActivityInidicatorView with gradient color? 

For now initialiser looks like this:

init(frame: CGRect, type: NVActivityIndicatorType? = nil, color: UIColor? = nil, padding: CGFloat? = nil)

but maybe there's some trick that could be done to achieve gradient color instead of one color.

If it's not possible, it could be feature added at some point.
With the new Xcode 10.2 update I cannot archive an application that has the NVActivityindicatorview and the extension version of the framework, both installed using cocoa pods. I have tried changing the Product and Module name in "Build Settings" for the Extension target so that it is unique, but the only fix that works is changing to the "Legacy Build System". Error message is below:

Multiple commands produce '/Users/.../Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/.../Build/Intermediates.noindex/ArchiveIntermediates/Skadaddle/IntermediateBuildFilesPath/UninstalledProducts/iphoneos/NVActivityIndicatorView.framework':

Hi,

I created an update to include the possibility for a custom animation.
this is based on the pullrequest by @nicoaldegheri.

please have a look and let me know what you think.
Hello,

I try to load NVActivityIndicatorView in UIWindow.
I have created Singleton class and get reference of UIWindow then show indicator method in Singleton class.
However I call / show /display indicator in UIWindow from Singleton class.
