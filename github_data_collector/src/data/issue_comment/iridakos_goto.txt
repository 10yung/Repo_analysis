I installed goto recently on WSL. It didn't work from the first try. So I installed it myself in a different directory where I put most of my global scripts. 
But when I investigated the goto script, I realized that it checks if you have a **.bashrc** file but also checks if you have **.zshrc**. 
However, if it finds **.bashrc**, it adds the the sourcing script to it and ignore **.zshrc**.
I have tested the script you guys used to decide which file to use and here is the output:
```
@DESKTOP-C64TQ1G ➜ testingStuff  if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
then> echo ".bashrc exists" 
then> fi
.bashrc exists
@DESKTOP-C64TQ1G ➜ testingStuff  if [ -f ~/.zshrc ]; then
echo ".zshrc exists"
fi
.zshrc exists
@DESKTOP-C64TQ1G ➜ testingStuff  if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
echo "bashrc exists" 
elif [ -f ~/.zshrc ]; then
echo "zshrc exists"
fi
bashrc exists
```
I think the correct behavior in this case is to add it to **.zshrc** since IF zsh is used, it usually ignores .bashrc and uses its own .zshrc .
BREAKING CHANGE: The default config file has moved to
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/goto
If the XDG_CONFIG_HOME variable is configured, that should be used as the default storage location (commonly ~/.config).

This has become the newer standard location for "dotfiles" and config files for Linux applications to try keeping the home path cleaner.

Still allowing an override is good, but the default should be changed to be more compliant with the Linux standard.
I can install goto without having any problems via brew but it won't start.

`brew install goto`
> /usr/local/Cellar/goto/1.2.3: 6 files, 18.9KB, built in 4 seconds

If I try starting it:
`goto`

> zsh: command not found: goto

With MacOs 10.15, Apple changed the default shell on MacOS to zsh. Maybe that's the problem..

I tried solving this issue by doing this (without success): https://github.com/iridakos/goto/issues/36#issuecomment-496945108
