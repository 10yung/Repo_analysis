Hello I found this plugins very interesting but the one thing I need in it is a link for each notification. When the notification is clicked, redirect to the given url.
Hi..
I need to some solution for use this library in my project. 
Is there any way to changed  'default-spinner' circle color?

I ask it because currently it is only display green("#27ae60") color.
I need display  'default-spinner' circle in different color according to status like following:

> 'SUCCESS' : GREEN COLOR
> 'WARNING': YELLOW COLOR
> 'INFO': BLUE COLOR
> 'ERROR': RED COLOR

**So, It is possible to give custom color to 'default-spinner'?**





Hello, first thing thank you very much for your plugin, its very good!
Im trying to use the overlay option and its not working
my amaran function:

```
function overlayingMsg() {
    $.amaran({
        'message'   :'My first example!',
        'overlay' :true,
        'sticky':true,
        'inEffect':'slideTop',
        'outEffect':'slideLeft',
        'overlayColor': 'orange'
    });
};
```

my application of the function:

```
<button type="button" class="btn btn-success btn-lg" style="margin: 10px" 
onclick="overlayingMsg()">Show overlaying message</button>
<script src="../assets/javascripts/data/alerts/amaran/overlayingMsg.js"></script>
```

I'm using jquery 2.2.4
same thing happens with the stickyButton option.

thanks in advance
