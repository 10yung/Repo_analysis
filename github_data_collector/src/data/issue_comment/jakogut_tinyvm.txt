Changed: process_defines now uses a calloc'd tempstr like process_includes. Using a variable-length array was the only barrier for the MS compiler.

Added Visual Studio solution and project files.
Please comment this code.  It looks like a really excellent project for learning about virtual machines but people wont use it that way if its a pain to figure out whats going on.

If not comments then please provide documentation.
