How do I modify the color of the initial render layer? Now it's green.

Hello I have a question about integration with CocoaPods, I am getting the fatal error listed in the title every time I try to present the player.

```swift
func testHTY360Player() {

        guard let hty360Player = HTY360PlayerVC(nibName: "HTY360PlayerVC", bundle: nil, url: url)
                else { return }
        present(hty360Player, animated: true, completion: nil)

    }
```

Additionally I have tried to get the bundle this way. Unfortunately that gets an empty bundleURL, so you never get to the bundle.

```swift
let podBundle = Bundle(for: HTY360PlayerVC.classForCoder())
if  let bundleURL = podBundle.url(forResource: "HTY360Player", withExtension: "bundle"),
    let bundle = Bundle(url: bundleURL) {
        // ... never gets to here
}
```

Thank you for your consideration in advance with regards to this matter, I really appreciate it.

Best,
Henry

But I don't know how to change it, or how it happens, or whats algorithm behinds that.

Thanks for helping & let me know & learn. please..
Hi everyone!
When I start video I see the sky! How I can change it programmatically before video start?
Thx a lot!
Fantastic Player, congrats.

One issue I have notice is when playing the video in portrait mode, if the user move a bit around, ( In portrait) it's like pushing the video back to the original position....

Is there any fix for this ?

Thanks a lot for your time !!
Hi, amazing player - Thanks a lot to make that open source !

One question, Id like to be able to play multiple demo. How is this possible to add another play demo 2 button for example ? which we launch another video :) ?

Any way to make it compatible in portrait mode aswell ?

Thanks a lot !! you rock :)
only play times 2-3s.
Does this library support Google Cardboard for displaying video in the left / right eye mode?

Sometimes the audio would load perfectly but the videooutput might get a green screen instead of  the right image. And it took me forever to find out where goes wrong. If somebody had the same issue , please help me.
