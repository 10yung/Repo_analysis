Normally, all folder names have dashes instead of underlines. Unified it though all packages.
This PR is a bit a mixed bag and the result of our attempt to improve the robustness of the `maplab_server_node`.

The problems this PR addresses are:
 - Since the `maplab_server_node` can only run few optimization steps each iteration, if a large loop closure is found it took a while for the map to converge
 - The maps sometimes diverged, in nearly all cases this happened when there were few/no visual observations between some frames.

To address this the following changes/new features were implemented:
 - There is an option to attach 6DoF odometry constraints in between vertices. These constraints are simply derived from the Odometry6DoF sensor that is used to build the map in the maplab_node.
   Activate with `maplab_node` flag: `--map_add_odometry_edges_if_less_than_n_common_landmarks`
   Options:
    - `-1` Don't add edges (default)
    -  `0` Add between all vertices
    -  `n` Only if the number of co-observed landmarks is `< n`
 - The 6DoF edges can be added to the optimization problem using the following flags: 
    - `--ba_include_6dof_odometry`
    - `--ba_fix_6dof_odometry_extrinsics`
 - Use the pose graph relaxation command in the `maplab_server_node` to close large loops faster. However since this command executes a full loop closure search, but doesn't merge landmarks, it wouldn't fully replace the loop closure. Hence we introduce an option to merge landmarks as well, which should result in a `relax` command that contains all functionality of the the `lc` command as well. The flag is `--lc_relax_merge_landmarks`
 - Some general improvements to the `maplab_server_node`, mostly restructuring to make the code a bit more readable.
 - `maplab_server_node` publishes T_G_M and T_G_B (both as they are currently and as they were when the map arrived at the server) for the most recent vertex of each robot after each iteration.

Credits: The optimization integration was already 99% there thanks to the 6DoF-capable relative pose constraint implementation that was added to support wheel odometry by @smauq  and @b-hahn 
I'm working on windows, is there anyone port this project to windows platform or planning to?
hi,
i added brief descriptor in maplab,but it is prompted that the “inverted_multi_index_quantizer_brief.dat file cannot be read” when the map is saved in the inverted-multi-index-interface.h

And I don't have this .dat file on my computer, how can I generate the .dat file?
Hi ! Rovioli extracts a map which is actually a line

---

I made calibration with Kalibr and made a video which is actually a loop. However Rovioli gives a map below: 

![2019-12-23 13-30-19 ekran görüntüsü](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17765576/71353722-fa1adb00-258a-11ea-8990-f3c68c032309.png)

What could be the problem? Any suggestion? Thank you.
Implement Maplab with my video
---

Hi! Basically, I am trying to implement Maplab with my video. Here is my pipeline:

1. Convert video to bagfile (done)
2. Create map with rovioli (occur an error)
3. Load the map with Maplab

During following this pipeline, I achieved (1), but I could not achieve (2). 

1. I created bagfile with this script from [there](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31432870/how-do-i-convert-a-video-or-a-sequence-of-images-to-a-bag-file).
2. When I run `rosrun rovioli tutorial_euroc save_folder /home/MY_NAME/PycharmProjects/empyt/bagfile.bag`, output is:

Thank you in advance. 
Hi,

I am planning to use maplab with a fisheye 185 degree lens which it was [suggested here](https://github.com/ethz-asl/mav_tools_public/wiki/Visual-Inertial-Sensors#example-sensor) and was wondering which are the best camera and distortion models to use [from Kalibr](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki/supported-models) which are currently supported? 

I saw @dymczykm reply in issue https://github.com/ethz-asl/maplab/issues/41#issuecomment-361917856 that you had tried the pinhole-equidistant models which has worked back in early 2018. I was wondering if there had been any updates on this since then or the best one to use is still this one? For example, newer models introduced in Kalibr in the last years, like double sphere or extended unified camera models? Saw that the authors in [these models](https://vision.in.tum.de/research/vslam/double-sphere) mentioned that for fisheye cameras equal or above 180 degrees that using the pinhole-equidistant model could be problematic, so wanted to check with you first. 

Zachary Taylor from your lab also posted in October 2018 results using ROVIO with this same lens (I think) [in this page](https://github.com/ethz-asl/mav_tools_public/wiki/Visual-Inertial-Sensors#example-sensor) but he did not mention the model he used. 

Thanks again for the help!

 Now I want to merge three mission maps ，But how can I get multiple session maps in one step , as mentioned in "multi session use case"?My current practice is to run rovioli three times, and then merge the maps.
Hello,

I appreciate your works!
I want to say it before a question.

I'm trying to use map sparsification function in [Keep it Brief: Scalable Creation of Compressed Localization Maps].
The objective functions it uses are consist of linear terms and a quadratic term. I want to use those objective functions, but a linear objective function seems available in maplab.
[https://github.com/ethz-asl/maplab/blob/88d8587958c6902e7304a5ef7d88e867b30924b3/algorithms/map-sparsification/src/optimization/lp-solve-sparsification.cc#L212-L236](url)
I found some code on quadratic term. [https://github.com/ethz-asl/maplab/blob/88d8587958c6902e7304a5ef7d88e867b30924b3/algorithms/map-sparsification/src/optimization/quadratic-term.cc](url)
But, it looks a stand-alone code now.
How can I use an objective function this paper use?

Thanks,

Giho.
