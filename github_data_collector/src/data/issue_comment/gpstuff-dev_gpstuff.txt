Hi there,

It seems the development has ceased for quite a while. Could anyone provide more information about the development? Like a rough roadmap? Current known problems/issues/bugs? It will be greatly helpful if someone wants to pick up from the last commit.

By the way, is there any fortune that someone would rewrite everything in the MATLAB OOP paradigm?

Best regards.
The gp_jpred function says to provide an optional input tstind = [] for the FIC approximation if none of the test points are also in the training set. However, when I try to use this function with an FIC model I get the error: 

Error using gp_jpred (line 425)
tstind not provided.

This error is occurring with GPStuff4.7.


New PSIS version based on updated https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02646v5
Does not work (at least for me).  Problem with nested handles reported (in the lik_studentt definition file)  if you follow the script on the GPstuff page.  There are other minor problems before that but they are easily fixed.  I assume that this demo has not been run against octave yet.

Should (!) easily  be fixable (just introduce sub functions) - shall likely do it myself!
From Lu Cheng:

"It was said in GPStuff manual page 42 that periodic kernel was coming
from this paper
http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v33/solin14.pdf

In page 907, equation (23) and GPStuff appendix, there is the canonical
periodic covariance function. And it is not obvious to find the explicit
form of quasi-periodic covariance function in section 3.5.

In the demo_periodic.m, there is alway the decay term, i.e. another SE
term, which is very confusing. I suggest add an additional example which
set decay to 0 and not including the extra length scale."
