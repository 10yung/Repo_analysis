How do I rename local variables in a method body without using "Edit Method C#"? (which won't work in obfuscated assemblies because it fail to compile)

The only way I found is:

- Right click in method body
- Edit IL
- Switch to "Locals" tab

But sadly all local names are empty. So I kinda have to guess / try&error which is the right variable. Is it possible for dnSpy to fill the window with the local variables it displays? Or is there any other way?

I am debugging a .NET app in which a profiler injects a few mdTypeDefs and mdMethodDefs shortly after module mscorlib finishes loading. However, when I choose "goto metadata", and specify the token ID, and then choose "method body", the token cannot be found. This leads me to believe that dynamically generated tokens are invisible to dnSpy. When I view metadata rows it shows me the existing tokens in the mscorlib.dll assembly and none of the rows contain any newly added (at runtime) type/method tokens. I can't find a generated method token in a memory window either, right after the last nearest token to the one I am looking for.
One thing is for sure, by the time I get to search for these tokens, they have already been emitted.
Any suggestions?

None

sometimes when i edit the classes and i do something idk , tons of windows pop out, even if i close one another one appears, making dnspy unusable, maybe add something to hide these windows errors?

Followed instructions on front page of repo:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy.git
cd dnSpy
./build.ps1

Get the following error

./build.ps1: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `[string]$buildtfm'

./build.ps1: line 1: `param([string]$buildtfm = 'all', [switch]$NoMsbuild)'

I have been debugging a dotnet network server program. 
And I want to set breakpoint listening point which is system.Runtime.Remoting.Channels.Tcp.TcpServerSocketHandler.ReadHeader()

I got messages

But I couldn't find that in dnspy APIs.
Can you explain me how to find dotnet APIs? or any advise for debugging network program?
I used "search" to find APIs but there is no specific API. 

I had never been debugging dotnet program. 
Thanks
- What version did you use?
The newest one, at least the one automatically downloaded by git.

Well, I have a new installation of dnSpy and dotnet core for building(x64) As far as I know its version 3.0.100. when running dotnet build ./build.ps1 the cmd gives me this error:
A compatible installed .NET Core SDK for global.json version [3.0.100] from [D:\dnSpy\global.json] was not found
Install the [3.0.100] .NET Core SDK or update [D:\dnSpy\global.json] with an installed .NET Core SDK:
  2.1.202 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
  2.1.509 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
  2.1.701 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
  3.1.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
I want to disbale auto shortcut and optimal code when compile, because when dnspy auto shortcut and optimal, my program not work.
Thanks for reading.
 I try to edit an exe and everything looks fine but when i save the module even without any edit, the app crashes after a few seconds.

I have added the program i am talking about, it is the exe in it i try to edit
[trikker_icon.zip](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy/files/4032019/trikker_icon.zip)

I'm maintaining a small unity game mod with 20+ modified scripts. There is a lot of cross-references between them with custom fields and methods. If the game gets updated by the devs, all those scripts will need to be patched at the same time and any reference that doesnt exist will make compiling individual scripts not possible. 

Is there a way to to compile multiple scripts at the same time to ensure all references are recognized? Or is there a fast workaround for this issue? Thanks in advance, dnspy has been immensely helpful.
