Support you, I think this project is great.I hope it will succeed.I am always looking for a debugger that supports system-wide taint analysis.but I only found free tools like panda.Unfortunately, its performance is too bad.When I run some large software in the vm, the whole system is very slow, I can't debug it at all.Finally I found a commercial tool. It is called tetrane.But I asked some people, they said that this tool is not as high-performance as it is advertised.I don't know if there is a debugger that supports full-system taint analysis on the market, and if you run Firefox, the system won't slow down.In addition, I am looking for an open source project, which is implemented by c or c++, and it support forward and backward taint analysis.I found an open source ida plugin. It's called bincat, but it's not c language, I studied it for a few days, headache, and couldn't understand.If you know any information, please let me know, thank you.
