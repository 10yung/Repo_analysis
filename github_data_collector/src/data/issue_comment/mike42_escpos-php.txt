i am using pos printer i send data by ethernet "ip"
but the printing process is very slow for arabic character 
Hello all.  I have a Star TSP100 set up on a Windows machine running WAMP on an internal network for a POS solution.  

Printing to the printer is not a problem.  It works just fine.  My issue is with the pulse command.
I have tried the following:
$escpos -> pulse();
$escpos -> pulse(1);
$escpos -> pulse(0, 100, 100);
$escpos -> pulse(0, 300, 300);
$escpos -> pulse(1, 100, 100);
$escpos -> pulse(1, 300, 300);

I know that the pulse is working ok because I can kick the drawer by using the Windows test page with the pulse set.  

Am I missing something?  
Thanks for any suggestions in advance.
Hi mike I want to print a picture but I don't get any errors and I can't print a picture

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
use Mike42\Escpos\Printer;
use Mike42\Escpos\EscposImage;
use Mike42\Escpos\PrintConnectors\FilePrintConnector;
$connector = new FilePrintConnector("EPSON TM-T20 Receipt");
$printer = new Printer($connector);
try {
    $tux = EscposImage::load("tux.png", false);
    $printer -> text("These example images are printed with the older\nbit image print command. You should only use\n\$p -> bitImage() if \$p -> graphics() does not\nwork on your printer.\n\n");
    
    $printer -> bitImage($tux);
    $printer -> text("Regular Tux (bit image).\n");
    $printer -> feed();
    
    $printer -> bitImage($tux, Printer::IMG_DOUBLE_WIDTH);
    $printer -> text("Wide Tux (bit image).\n");
    $printer -> feed();
    
    $printer -> bitImage($tux, Printer::IMG_DOUBLE_HEIGHT);
    $printer -> text("Tall Tux (bit image).\n");
    $printer -> feed();
    
    $printer -> bitImage($tux, Printer::IMG_DOUBLE_WIDTH | Printer::IMG_DOUBLE_HEIGHT);
    $printer -> text("Large Tux in correct proportion (bit image).\n");
} catch (Exception $e) {
    /* Images not supported on your PHP, or image file not found */
    $printer -> text($e -> getMessage() . "\n");
}
$printer -> cut();
$printer -> close();
```
Hello,

I use JSprinterManager to pass instructions to the printer.
Is there any way to get raw data from your class ? Then I would pass them to jsprintermanager ? That would help as POS instructions are really hard to write/encode etc

Thank you

        $this -> connector -> write(self::FS . "&");
        $str = iconv("UTF-8", "BIG5//IGNORE", $str);

First Of All Thanks for awesome work.
Sir Can  you please tell me how to use escpos-php library in codeigniter?

How do I set the top space?
I really like this project, but for me the most important problem is not being able to print from the cloud. I propose develop a way that could print from the cloud. I am developer and I can help with this.
Some ideas:
- Develop local application similar to [QZ Print](https://qz.io/) or [TakePOS Connector](http://en.takepos.com/connector/) (I am experienced in this last one)
- Develop Chrome extension
- Simple mike42 local installation that connects to the cloud installation.

What do you think? Do you have other idea?
