I am very angry at this and I might have to go back to a system backup to restore this. The wallpaper picture did exist. Why did this happen?

macOS 10.14.6
Hi, could you please tag a new stable release? The one available over Homebrew is still 0.2.5 and this is almost 2 years ago.

Add dock subcommand to add a small spacer to the doc.

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{"tile-type"="small-spacer-tile";}'
killall Dock
```

I want to set the values in this menu:

Hidden dot files are not removed when running 'm trash clean' as well as trash files stored on mounted volumes.

The former should be easy to fix and for the latter, the command should look for mounted volumes and clear the contents in the .Trashes folder.
Hi there,

what about adding "--help" and "-h" to the plugins?
I'm coming from the Linux side and i recently ran "m wallpaper --help" by mistake and it changed my wallpaper to the default Sierra one.

Not so great.

What do you think about that?
I love this tool for macOS.  Can i suggest/request an enhancement feature:

It would be useful to have command completion, to speed up workflow.

For example, typing `m bl` + `Tab` would complete to `m bluetooth`, and another `Tab` would give you the `status`, `enable`, `disable` command options.

Another example is typing `m b` + `Tab`, this would allow you to complete to `battery` or `bluetooth`

Maybe this is already implemented, or there is a Mac terminal way to index commands for auto completion? But if it is, it was not immediately obvious to me.
Added a resource section in `Readme.md` for future reference & inspiration
