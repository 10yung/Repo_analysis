I wanted to be able to paste into chunks.
So I copied the implementation of the relevant methods from the TagCompoundDataNode.
Can also create tags in chunks as a result. These capabilities were already in the Capabilities property, so now does as advertised.

I realize it might be better to have some inheritance structure, so no copying is necessary, but I was unsure how easy/hard that would be.

Before:

The `TextBox`es' now resize according to the `GroupBox`es' width.

The last commit was from November 2017.

If it is abandoned, is there an updated fork?
Region files such as `r.0.-1.mca` cannot be opened and crash NBTExplorer. Using v2.8.0. Crash log attached: [error.log](https://github.com/jaquadro/NBTExplorer/files/3375765/error.log)

The Mac version, 2.0.3, is 32-bit, and as such will not be supported on the next version of macOS, macOS Catalina. 
Additionally, the Mac version is not available to download from github, only from minecraftforum -> hocuspocus.taloncrossing.com/rii/NBTExplorer-Mac-2.0.3.zip
I tried expanding a chunk in a region file which was giving errors and that crashed the program and gave me this error log.

I have added the error log and the mca file down below, the chunk which was giving the error is chunk x: 2457, z: -1174

I know there was a version of this for Mac at one point in time, but I don't see it here. Where is it?
Im trying to make my player have an attack speed of 2 instead of 4 and it does work when i load in but upon death the values reset, anyway to avoid this? thank you
`.schem` is the file extension used by the [Sponge Schematic](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Schematic-Specification) format, used by Sponge, WorldEdit, etc. They're just gzip'd nbt like any other, so nothing else is needed to support them. This just adds the file extension so they are recognized as nbt files by default in the UI.
I'm pretty sure there isn't a way to delete tags with NBTUtil (if there is it's hard to find...). It would be very helpful for automating deleting the Player compound tag when switching between singleplayer and server!
