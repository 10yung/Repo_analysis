I assume it's only difficult to read here because this package is trying to be fancy with colors?

Just using default macOS Terminal app but with the OS-level Dark Mode enabled.
At the moment under `Emails from owned-repo recent activity`, a lot of false positives are returned simply because a user has forked a popular repo (for example to contribute something). We might want to exclude recent activity emails from popular repo's/forks.
**Replicate**
Run:
```
$ ~/bin/github-email.sh zacharysarah
```

**Expected**
Email addresses from domains such as `users.noreply.github.com` are not included in the results.

**Actual**
The noreply addresses are listed.

**Workaround**
Run:
```
$ ~/bin/github-email.sh zacharysarah | grep -v noreply
```

Also added wget installation.
mostly for this auth stuff.

should update the readme with the env var guidance
fixes #10
Note that the rate limits can be exceeded. As such, perhaps it would be possible to allow configuring an API key for authenticated requests.

A few ideas to consider:

* Make curl operate in silent mode.
* Use jq to parse the data, rather than sed and grep.
* Format the email address to be compatible with most e-mail clients.
* Suppress `null` results.

For example:

```
#!/bin/bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/users/$1/events/public | \
  jq -r '.[] | select(.payload != null) | .payload | select(.commits != null) | .commits[].author | .name + " <" + .email + ">"' | \
  sort | uniq
```
