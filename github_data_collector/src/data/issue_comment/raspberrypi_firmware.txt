**Describe the bug**
Mailbox property tag `0x00048006` ineffective at setting RGB pixel order after firmware upgrade.

**To reproduce**
~~Run https://github.com/bztsrc/raspi3-tutorial/blob/master/09_framebuffer/kernel8.img on a RPi 3B with latest firmware~~
Repository https://github.com/petemoore/redscreen now contains a complete minimal assembly example

**Expected behaviour**
Previously this used to correctly display homer on a connected HDMI monitor

**Actual behaviour**
Homer is cyan rather than yellow, since framebuffer is using BGR instead of RGB

**System**
RPi 3B

**Additional context**
See also https://github.com/bztsrc/raspi3-tutorial/issues/64.

I haven't bisected the firmware revision where the problem started occurring, but a couple of years ago the same `kernel8.img` worked correctly with the firmware of the time. Randomly on one upgrade, it broke.

Please note, the code that generates the mailbox request can be found in [`lfb.c`](https://github.com/bztsrc/raspi3-tutorial/blob/master/09_framebuffer/lfb.c). The response to the `0x00048006` mailbox property tag is not checked in the example code, but when I add a check for it, I see that `mbox[24]` is 0 after making the mailbox call, so for some reason the request is denied, although it was previously supported on older firmware.

issue: 
using program lang python3 / golnag 1.13.1 / using usb camera two interface 2.0 product sonnix
test firmware 4.19.50-v7l+ // 4.19.75-v7l+ // 4.19.50-v7l+ // 4.19.93 is same..

but firmware 4.19.50 (rasberry pi official site downloaded first version is safety, but.. firware downgrade is camera getting error)

python3 using library opencv 3.4.9, 4.1.0, 4.1.2, 4.2.0
golang using library v4l / opencv 4.2.0

golang is getting all camera but so slowly buffer (When importing an image from the camera, import it 3-5 times, stop and repeat)

python3 is getting one camera is safety,
However, if you open the second camera and get an image, the first camera stops.

and now getting error :

what is that? Searching there is no workaround.

Hi

I have random freezes on raspbian buster and newest rpi firmware
i have Linux raspberrypi 4.19.93-v7+ #1286 SMP Mon Jan 6 13:18:44 GMT 2020 armv7l GNU/Linux

It happend random, sometimes with high cpu load sometimes without any high load. It seems to start after upgrading to raspbian buster my rpi 2b+ start freezes

After freeze i can see my console on screen but cannot log into with ssh, i dont use x server. Cannot do anything even with keyboard connected to rpi  - works only enter tap and then nothing happend.

Copy and paste the results of the raspinfo command in to this section. Alternatively, copy and paste a pastebin link, or add answers to the following questions:

* Which model of Raspberry Pi? e.g. Pi3B+, PiZeroW

Rpi 2b+

I report this bug here on recommendation of @popcornmix

**Describe the bug**
When playing a video with the latest LibreElec 19 testbuilds, suddenly a crash appears and kodi restarts. This does not happen always and at random moments. However it happens often enough to reproduce.

**To reproduce**
Create a brand new fresh install of libreelec kodi 18.5 and then update with the latest libreelec 19 testbuild. I used #0104, 04-Jan-2020 on a rpi3
Play a movie and the crash occurs after some time. Sometimes a second try must be done.

**Expected behaviour**
No crash should happen

**Actual behaviour**
It crashes
The crahlog file contains:

Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
#0  0x76f224d0 in memcpy () from /usr/lib/libarmmem-v7l.so

**System**
the raspinfo command does not exist on my system
* Which model of Raspberry Pi? Pi3B+
* Which OS and version (`cat /etc/rpi-issue`)? cat /etc/rpi-issue gives no such file or directory... 
* Which firmware version (`vcgencmd version`)?

**Logs**
I include the crashlog file here: https://paste.kodi.tv/xajacecuda.kodi
This crashlog also includes the kodi.log at that moment.

**Additional context**
I have a complete image available from this setup. So you can restore the image on a micro sd card (min 8 gb) and boot with it and then goto video and play the video there.
Please provide me an email address to whom I can send a link of this image.
If you prefer the movie only I can also provide it. It is a movie I recorded myself. I prefer not to post these links here publically but if really needed I will do.
Sorry if I'm asking the question in wrong place but not really sure what would be the best place to do it. Please advise if there's a better one.

Recently I was debugging broken mpv which appeared to be caused by linking with both libEGL and libbrcmEGL. My question is what is the purpose of the latter? Is it somehow different than libEGL provided by platform? Is libbrcmEGL gonna replace libEGL completely? Why cause so much trouble to projects if they want to support both Mesa's libEGL and rpi's libbrcmEGL in one binary? It basically forces projects to introduce modular design and do quite a lot of gimmicks with linking to have common EGL/GLES code without being tied to single library.
Latest Rasbian on Pi4, eth_led0 setting to 4 does not function as documented. Amber LED stays on. 
When the rpi 4 bootloader was previously configured (with `/lib/firmware/raspberrypi/bootloader/beta/pieeprom-2019-11-18.bin`) to only boot from the network as:

```
BOOT_ORDER=0x2
NET_BOOT_MAX_RETRIES=-1
```

It cannot be recovered using the [recovery procedure](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) (BTW, this should be available as a `.img` file as the normal raspbian image, which would allow us to use the same procedure, e.g., using balena etcher).

I need stable core clock frequency because SPI bus is used.
I use my PRi in headless mode, so GPU performance doesn't matter to me. And I prefer to keep GPU power consumption as low as possible.
I want to use max (non-overcocked) CPU frequency. At least with performance governor RPi boots faster. And idle temperature difference between 600MHz and 1400MHz is only 0.5-1â„ƒ on 3B+. 

There is my current config, it works on RPi 3B+:
````
gpu_freq=250
force_turbo=1
````

I dislike explicit frequency setting, I'm unsure if it is compatible with RPi 4 and future models.

What about new option? Something like `gpu_turbo=0` would be fine.

is there any resolution to this?

thank you
