Is there any opportunity for a Bash Bunny connect script? I think there is for administrators that often use the Bash Bunny frequently.
Hi i have developed a payload for bash bunny, which works on mac linux without any switching or editing the payload.
This payload has the capability to grant a user and root shell to pentester. But it was tested only in digispark attiny 85. Because i don't have a bashbunny. Even i have converted the script to bashbunny form.
I have added poc video in my README.md file please check it. I hope it worthier enough to put in bash bunny payloads.

I love hak5 and it's cool gadgets. Thank you.
I added a header to the Ascii-Prank's payload, that describes what this payload does.
In the ExecutableInstaller's payload.txt file the lines, that open a Run window and enter the command using the QUACK have been replaced by a single line using the RUN command.

Hi!

I'm using a WHID and wanted to know how it could possible to use french language characters aka
é î ç à è   

because at the moment, when typing the string, numbers appear instead of those characters.

thanks!



Corrected typo "emulaiton" to "emulation" in readme.txt.
Update to Version 2.3.4
The Documentation is missing the "ENTER" ducky script keyword
