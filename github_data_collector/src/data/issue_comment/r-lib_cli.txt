I.e. `sep` and `last`.


Think about how this should work with a subprocess.
Instead of just the id. So that we can write a nice print method for it. Maybe.


Based on number or width?
(Meta issue, will edit as I come across more small helpers):

```
dir_copy(c("foo", NA_character_, "bar", NA_character_), "blah")
#> Error: `path` must not have missing values
#> NAs found at 1,000,000 locations: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...
```

* Number formatting (e.g. set big mark)
* Commas + truncation
* Standard wrappers for argument names, paths, expressions
