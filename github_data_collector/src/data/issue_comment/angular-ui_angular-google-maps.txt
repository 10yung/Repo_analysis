Hello,

I have the problem. I have two keys Google Maps. The first for Map and the second Key for Places Library. I can use all keys? if the answer is yes, could you tell me how configurate the second key?

Thanks,
For anyone hitting this issue when clustering markers, it is a result of using third-party library of MarkerWithLabel

`MarkerLabel_.prototype.onRemove = function () {
  var i;
  this.labelDiv_.parentNode.removeChild(this.labelDiv_);
  this.eventDiv_.parentNode.removeChild(this.eventDiv_);

  // Remove event listeners:
  for (i = 0; i < this.listeners_.length; i++) {
    google.maps.event.removeListener(this.listeners_[i]);
  }
};`

needs to change this:

`this.labelDiv_.parentNode.removeChild(this.labelDiv_);`

to this: 

`if (this.labelDiv_.parentNode){
    this.labelDiv_.parentNode.removeChild(this.labelDiv_);
 }`

@nmccready
any fix for that?


The raw Google API provides a way to create a map with a custom image, instead of the normal map of Earth, but it doesn't look like Angular Google Maps currently provides that functionality for use with Angular. As an example of where it could be useful, you could upload the floorplan of a building and place objects within it.
Dear angular-ui community,

I think I have found an issue. Please let me know if I'm doing something wrong, or the problems lies somewhere else.
I am using Ionic v1 with Angular 1.


## Version
2.3.2

## Test Case
Marker infoBox pans out of view.

## Steps to reproduce
If I tap on a marker, which has a location currently outside of the view (i.e. I only see part of the marker, but that's enough to tap on it), then the opened infoBox gets displayed outside of the view. 

## Expected Behavior
I'd expect the map to pan in a way that the infoBox is fully visible.

## Actual Behavior
The map pans in a way that the marker gets placed somewhat in the middle, but the infoBox can't be fully seen.

## Version
2.4.1

## Test Case

https://embed.plnkr.co/q2luS1vMdCAEVig8zEe5/

## Steps to reproduce
Use responsive mode, or a mobile device.

## Expected Behavior
We should be able to draw polygons like with the mouse's events

## Actual Behavior
We can't draw actualy

Maybe it could from the last update of Google Maps

I'm new to angular-google-maps and having a few challenges.  The main one is that after the map and the markers have been drawn, I can drag the map with my mouse but it keeps automatically returning back to the same position.

I have values in my $scope.map for center, zoom and bounds.

Any idea what I've done wrong?
I am using the polygon directive with the editable of true. I noticed that if I create a square I am not able to edit the corners of the squares but I am able to edit the ghost points that appear between the real vertices. If I attempt to edit the edges, the changes I make stick for about 1 milisecond only to be reset back to what it was before I dragged the corner to make the change. 
 <agm-snazzy-info-window     *ngFor="let item of list"
