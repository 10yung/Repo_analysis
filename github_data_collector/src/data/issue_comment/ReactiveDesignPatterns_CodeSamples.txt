Hi, I and my friends nearly finish the translation, and we are syncing the code samples in the book and put them online.

A preview is here: http://rdp.reactiveplatform.xyz/chapter-03/index.html

But there is a problem that, some code lists and snips are not lives in this repo, So I have to manually recreate them, like, https://github.com/ReactivePlatform/reactive-design-patterns-cn/blob/master/chapter03/src/main/java/chapter03/UsingStringBuffer.java

Hopefully, we could rely on some of your great works and then make PR to merge back:) I did that before for *Netty In Action* book, eg: https://github.com/normanmaurer/netty-in-action

Thank you, your input is very needed.


  
I know the book is using Akka 2.4.xï¼Œbut yes,there is something changed.
Section 11.3.4 of pBook advertises source code archives for details on usage of CallingThreadDispatcher, which does not look to be present here.
