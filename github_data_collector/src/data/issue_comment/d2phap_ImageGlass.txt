The displayed date in the title bar is the creation date of the file.
A option to change that to the modified date or better DateTimeOriginal (EXIF Data) would be nice.

**Problem:**
For Pictures the displayed date and time is the time they where moved from the camera to the pc (creation time) and not when they where taken (modified date / DateTimeOriginal (EXIF Data)).

Following picture was taken at 28.11.2019 / 15:25:37 but ImageGlass shows it as 20.01.17 / 14:15:11.

A request to add "pinch-to-zoom" when using precision touchpads.

I have confirmed that touchpad "swipe to scroll" works in IG. This seems to be tied to Mouse Wheel actions; is there a specific set of "touchpad gesture" messages we can support?

Determine which [Windows 10 touchpad gestures](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027871/windows-10-touchpad-gestures) we can support.

>I have all my JPEGs in Adrobe RGB color profile and this program does not display colors correctly

See attached image. You can see the "desired" colors when using "Windows Photo Viewer" [but not Paint, Photos, or a browser].

From what I've been able to determine, an image may be marked with a color profile, but not via an ICC Color Profile. Instead, they use an exif metadata tag called the "Interoperability Index" (aka "InteropIndex"). In the case of this user, the "InteropIndex" is set to "Adobe RGB".

ImageMagick / Magick.NET do not recognize this exif tag, and provide the image to us with the sRGB color space.

The following line of code will get us the value of the "InteropIndex":
```
var test = imgM.GetAttribute("exif:thumbnail:InteroperabilityIndex");
```
where `imgM` is our `MagickImage` object.

The known values of the InteropIndex are:
- R03 : AdobeRGB
- R98 : sRGB

Suggested approach:
1. Add code to look for this exif tag, and verify the image is in the "desired" color space. If not, we should convert the image color space.
2. Submit an issue to Magick.NET requesting they use the "desired" color space in this situation.

I have to change edit app for Open with feature.

Currently, navigation goes in one direction -- [Left] is previous image, [Right] is next image.
Request is to add support for swapping that (so [Left] is next image, [Right] is previous image).  i.e. RTL navigation/reading order.

While we're at it, going to mention support for swapping the PgDn/PgUp navigation direction, too)

cheers
Please add below feature:
- Display thumbnail instead original photo until the photo is loaded.

### Is your feature request related to a problem?
Only two points are related to a problem.
***************************
I'm frustrated that:
- **1** - I must use the context menu to Start and Stop an animated image (gif). There should be a dedicated button on the Page Navigation window for this.
- **2** - When I click 'View Previous/Next page', the animation starts playing on its own. This trivializes the Page Navigation feature. It shouldn't do this.
- **3** - I cannot navigate _only_ through different frames. If I have a four-unique-frames animation that has 60 frames for visibility/timing purposes, I'll have to navigate through 15 unchanging frames before I get to a different one. I wish I were able to navigate through unique frames only.
- **4** - The '**^**' button seemingly does nothing in the Page Navigation menu. If it does nothing, it should be removed.

### Additional context
I'm glad the Multipage/Page navigation feature was added. Before this, I had to open an image editor to view gifs frame-by-frame.

By the way, this is unrelated, but the Issues section of ImageGlass on GitHub is very organized. This is great. Most 'Issues' don't come close to being this organized.
### System information:
 - Windows OS version: Windows 10 Pro 1903
 - ImageGlass version: 7.5.1.1


### To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Start ImageGlass by opening a TGA image or load a TGA image in ImageGlass with Ctrl+O
2. Observe the image is rendered upside-down


### Actual behavior:
TGA images are rendered upside-down in ImageGlass.


### Expected behavior:
All images formats should be rendered in the correct orientation.


### Screenshots:
[TGA image of letter 'A' rendered in ImageGlass](https://i.imgur.com/3K0i829.png)

I'd love the possibility not only to resize the thumbnail-pane but to save the new size permanently.
### System information:
 - Windows OS version: Windows 10 Home, Version 1903, OS Build 18362.535
 - ImageGlass version: 7.5.1.1


### To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Install an older version of ImageGlass (prior to 7.5.1.1)
2. Customize ZoomLevels (using commas as the separator).
3. Install Latest Version of ImageGlass.
4. Attempt to restart ImageGlass.


### Actual behavior:
ImageGlass fails to start. In the Event Viewer I see the following error:
Application: ImageGlass.exe
Framework Version: v4.0.30319
Description: The process was terminated due to an unhandled exception.
Exception Info: System.FormatException
   at System.Number.StringToNumber(System.String, System.Globalization.NumberStyles, NumberBuffer ByRef, System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo, Boolean)
   at System.Number.ParseInt32(System.String, System.Globalization.NumberStyles, System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo)
   at ImageGlass.Base.Helpers.StringToIntArray(System.String, Boolean, Boolean)
   at ImageGlass.Settings.Configs.Load()
   at ImageGlass.Program.Main()


### Expected behavior:
ImageGlass starts with no errors.


### Screenshots:
<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->


### Additional context:
I believe commit 07a1493b8059a16c38d4977c0aebd9ca8ae2bf8b ("improved ToolbarButtons, changed some default configs values" by d2phap) caused this issue, specifically the change to line 107 of Helpers.cs to alter the delimiter from comma to semicolon. Assuming only people that have customized their ZoomLevel in the past would experience this issue. I hand edited the XML file (%AppData%\Roaming\ImageGlass\igconfig.xml) to change the delimiter to a semi-colon and the application started normally following that change.
