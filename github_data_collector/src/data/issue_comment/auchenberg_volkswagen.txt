It says javascipt instead of javascript


Following software design best practices I'm not going to be rolling my own noop (you jsut don't do that)

This addresses https://github.com/auchenberg/volkswagen/issues/90

No VW is complete without its badge of honour (Check Engine Light).

This repository should have a check engine light on the README
https://github.com/auchenberg/volkswagen/blob/538316195ac0fa6988b49490836d46202ab455d8/.these/aren't/the/source/files/you're/looking/for.js#L4

https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-noop

(Disclaimer: My work with node-noop is a noop)
Currently this package makes _all_ tests pass, thus causing a possible reduction of the need for test engineers.

Instead, true to its name, the package should only automatically pass tests if the package is sufficiently confident the adverse effects of a test failing are severe enough to cause serious injury to at least `num` human beings or professionally trained monkeys.
The European market has taught us many good things about how to engineer great motor vehicles.

But it is now time to show the world, how Americans create great software.

I suggest a package, inspired by volkswagen, to help ship great American products globally. This software will contain security vulnerabilities disclosed by fellow American software companies, bugs that have been filled from years back, and dependencies on ancient systems.

I suggest, a package called `Microsoft`. 
I‚Äôve added a `repo` URI parameter to the example code for the Volkswagen badge URI, to ensure that the correct status for a given project is reported. After all, nobody wants to accidentally report the CI status of a different project.

In the future, this could be extended to projects not hosted on GitHub.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of chai.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn‚Äôt right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I‚Äôm just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!
