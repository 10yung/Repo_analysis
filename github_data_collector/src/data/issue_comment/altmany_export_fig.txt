when I use
print(gcf, '-dpdf','-painters', 'aaa.pdf')              
 I get object transparency

but when I use:
export_fig aaa.pdf -q101 -painters                 
I loss transparency

I read in the description that -painters don't support transparency, but it seems that when using print it works.
can this be fixed?

TL;DR: copyobj() cannot be used to copy UIAxes (as of r2019b).  

As discussed [here in Matlab Central forum](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/483043-appdesigner-print-screen-problem-appdesigner-is-a-disappointment#answer_399076), the changes recently made to support UIFigure & UIAxes doesn't work.  When a UIFigure is supplied as an input, the code searches for its children and uses copyobj() to copy those components to a legacy figure.  When a UIAxes is directly supplied as an input, it also uses copyobj() to copy the UIAxes to the legacy figure.  The problem is that copyobj() is not supported for UIAxes.  As evidence of that, 
```Matlab
uax = uiaxes(); 
fig = figure(); 
copyobj(uax,fig)
% Error using matlab.ui.control.UIAxes/copyElement
%Functionality not supported with UIAxes. For more information, 
% see Graphics Support in App Designer. 
```
The error is not thrown in export_fig() because copyobj() is called from a try/catch that rethrows the error as a modified warning.    

Otherwise, export_fig() is terrific!

I recently wrote a function [copyUIAxes()](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/73103-copyuiaxes) that searches for and copies the children of a UIAxes to a new legacy axes along with the legend and colorbar if they exist.  I think this is the only workaround to using copyobj() with UIAxes.


Hi, 
It seems that -transparent isn't working properly when the figure is created with "stackedplot"
Hi,
I use your script daily - THANKS!
I updated ghostscript 9.27-->9.5
after running:
export_fig 1111.pdf -q101 -painters -append

Using only `export_fig('tata.png' ,'-png','-nocrop');` on the linked figure leads to a cropping problem on linux. 
On Windows10 it works fine. 

I just updated the package and the problem remains.
It might be related to #64. 
I tried with `fig.Units = 'pixels'` as proposed in this issue but this has no effect here.

Hi Altmany - love the script, usually works like a charm. First time it fails me though..
I have a 2x2 subplot, all four of them are somewhat busy (stacked bar plots, lines on top, text annotations, legends, etc). If each of them is a standalone figure, export_fig handles it fine into a pdf. When it's subplot however, I get this ghostscript and/or eps2pdf error [note that if I try exporting to eps it gives me the same error]:

In those directories where ghostscript fails there are half rendered pdf files but not with all the information in the figure. Any thoughts/ideas? Thanks!!

For reference, this is the half-rendered PDF:
[tpc94c40f4_e46e_4e7b_93f6_22c7fe1fe27c.pdf](https://github.com/altmany/export_fig/files/3498330/tpc94c40f4_e46e_4e7b_93f6_22c7fe1fe27c.pdf)




**EDIT:** I've boiled down the error to using the `bar `command to plot these histograms. I can get the render to generate a PDF if I use `histogram` for example, but of course stacking is so much easier with bar. Any insight appreciated. For the record, I am using Matlab 2018a on windows 7.
I get this error:

Ghostscript and latest version of export_fig are installed
Dear author,

I plot a figure with three subplot which consists of 'pcolor' and 'contour' plots. This figure file is a very large file up to 286MB. Then I use the export_fig to export this figure (export_fig('filename','-png','-r600')), but it cannot export this figure after 10 hours and it is still exporting.
Is there a method to speed up this process?
Thanks.

Hi altmany, love the script. I have been using it for a while. I got in trouble recently trying to get a SURF plot to be exported, Matlab just gets busy and crashes finally. If I try to do the same on a similar plain PLOT (same data overlayed) no trouble at all.
DonÂ´t know if this is coming because of the type of plot or if it is coming from a missing extra parameter I should be using.
Op. System: Win 10 x64

I'm trying to export PDF with OpenGL and transparency on and using Matlab R2018b. The text on left and right axes is being cut off, in particular zeros:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11501130/52383763-9e2e8d00-2a72-11e9-94b0-c948108b122f.png)

```Matlab
export_fig(fig, 'myfile','-OpenGL','-pdf','-nocrop');
```

I've tried switching fonts, adding padding, turning off cropping, turning off font switching, but nothing helps. Painters and Zbuffer fixes the issue but I really need to use the transparency option.

I am using multiple subplots in this which might be the cause.
