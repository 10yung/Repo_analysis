As per the document [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/connect/quickstart/php) it says when user authenticate using connect button we should pass **Account SID** retrieved during the authorization process as **SID**  and main (using which we've created connect app) account's **Auth Token**  as token to the client, but when i do so it says json not found.

**My Code:**

### Code Snippet
```php
        $sid = 'AC09f****'; // this is the Account SID which we recieve while redirect from twilio
        $token = '964f****'; // main account's auth token
        $twilio = new Client($sid, $token);
        $account = $twilio->getAccount($sid)->fetch();
        $balanceUrl = 'https://api.twilio.com' . $account->subresourceUris['balance'];
        $balanceResponse = $twilio->request('GET', $balanceUrl);
        $responseContent = $balanceResponse->getContent();
        return $responseContent;
```

2. Allow from twilio page
3. Save the **Account SID** in URL
4. Pass **Account SID** as twilio sid and **Auth Token** as twilio_token to client

**Note:** i am using Laravel so using twilio SDK in it 

### Version
"twilio/sdk": "^5.38"
**Version:**  5.41.0

### Code Snippet
```php
<?php

require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new Twilio\Rest\Client(
    env('TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID'),
    env('TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN'),
    null,
    null,
    new \Twilio\Http\GuzzleClient(new GuzzleHttp\Client())
);

const TEL = '+1xxxxxxxxxx';

$messages = $client->messages->stream([
    'To' => TEL,
]);

foreach ($messages as $message) {
    if ($message->to !== TEL) {
        die(var_dump($message));
    }
}
```

```bash
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=xxxx TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxx php ./test_twilio.php
```

### Exception/Log

N/A

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Add an example telephone number to the test script that will return > 50 results
2. run the test script
Expected result: Only matching records are returned
Actual result: After the first page the stream returns **all** messages, not just messages matching the filter.

Looking at the `$url` and `$params` parameters passed to GuzzleClient::request it appears that the first call includes the filter parameters in `$params` while the second call has the filters in the `$url` already and an empty `$params` array. 

```
# first request
"https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/xxx/Messages.json"
array:1 [
  "To" => "+1xxxxxxxxxx"
]
# second request
"https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/xxx/Messages.json?To=%2B1xxxxxxxxxx&PageSize=50&Page=1&PageToken=xxxxxxxxxx"
[]
```
**Version:** 5.4.0

The documentation says we should use string array as permission argument. 
[Create a Role resource](https://www.twilio.com/docs/chat/rest/role-resource?code-sample=code-create-a-role-resource&code-language=PHP&code-sdk-version=5.x)

```php
$role = $twilio->chat->v2->services("ISXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX")
                         ->roles
                         ->create("friendly_name", // friendlyName
                                  "channel", // type
                                  array("permission") // permission
                         );
```

But [in the code](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-php/blob/5.40.0/src/Twilio/Rest/Chat/V2/Service/RoleList.php#L41) we have `string` param annotation.

calling is working can you please tell me how can i enable the Emergency call in php ?
PHP version 5 is at end of life and on December 1, 2019, only PHP versions 7.2+ will be officially supported by the PHP community. 

**On January 1, 2020, Twilio will no longer support PHP version 5 via this helper library.**
In order by Twig to correctly use dynamic object properties, the magic method __isset must be defined  on the class. ( https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/recipes.html#using-dynamic-object-properties )

Example:
Given a \Twilio\Rest\Api\V2010\Account\AvailablePhoneNumberCountry\LocalInstance to a Twig template
```
{{localInstance.friendlyName}}
```
This will not work unless the following is added to LocalInstance
```
 public function __isset($name)  {
        return array_key_exists($name, $this->properties);
}
```
We am using both SMS and Voice call features, both are working fine but now we are in a situation to support multi countries. 
We know that https://www.twilio.com/console/voice/calls/geo-permissions/low-risk go to this url and allow what counties should have access but is there any way that I can pull permitted counties list from API to list in UI ? 

I am not worried about giving permission from API but I want at least fetch the permitted/allowed by my account/company countries list for both SMS and Voice so that I can make a dropdown in my View.
Which means I should never hit `13227 & 21215 & 32205` these codes

The variable `$buffer` is not defined in this scope. To me this looks like a refactoring gone wrong. It is used but never freed in `public function options(…)`.

         video: { width: 640 }
    }).then(localTracks => {
          return connect("token", {
         name: "room-name",
         tracks: localTracks
    });
  }).then(room => {
    // Log your Client's LocalParticipant in the Room
  const localParticipant = room.localParticipant; 
  console.log('Connected to the Room as LocalParticipant "%s"', localParticipant.identity);
  //Log any Participants already connected to the Room
  room.participants.forEach(participant => {    
      $('#room_id').val(room.sid);
     // alert("Incoming Call 1");
     /*0*/  
  });

  //Attach the Participant's Media to a <div> element.
    room.on('participantConnected', function(participant) {    
    participants = participant;
    // intialize 2 step
    //Here Particaipant Connected
    alert("incoming id = "+participant.identity); 
   
    const { createLocalVideoTrack } = Twilio.Video;

    createLocalVideoTrack().then(track => {
      
      var localMediaContainer = document.getElementById('local-media');
      localMediaContainer.appendChild(track.attach());
    });
    
    $('#videoModal').modal();
    console.log(`Participant "${participant.identity}" connected`);

    participant.tracks.forEach(track => {
      document.getElementById('remote-media').appendChild(track.attach());
    });

    participant.on('trackAdded', track => {
      document.getElementById('remote-media').appendChild(track.attach());
    });
    participant.on('participantDisconnected', participant => { 
        console.log(`Participant "${participant.identity}" has disconnected from the Room`); });
  });
});`
