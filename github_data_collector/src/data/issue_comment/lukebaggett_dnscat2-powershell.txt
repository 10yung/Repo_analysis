I have the sever running but get the below error on the Windows client:

Start-Dnscat2EncInit : Failed to negotiate encryption. Ensure your dnscat2 server is set up correctly.

The following commands are having issues:

`upload /tmp/test C:/test`
`download C:/test /tmp/test`

For download, dnscat2 says that it is expecting more bytes and fails to write the file, or the file is written but is missing a few bytes at the end. For upload, sometimes it works, and sometimes nothing happens.

Looking into this.
At the moment, encryption functions use BouncyCastle's crypto DLL, which requires a reflective load of a huge amount of data, significantly increasing the script size. This should be avoided, which will require finding alternative Salsa20, SHA3, and ECDH-P256 functions.
Add documentation and more comments.
