## Description

When building the project with Xcode 11, the default value for `PHImageRequestOptions.resizeMode` is `.fast`. This causes the `PHImageManager` to send lower resolution images which appear blurred when displayed in the photo picker cells.

Xcode 10, iPhone 6s, default value ->`.none`: 256x342, sometimes 256x454
Xcode 11, iPhone 6s, default value -> `.fast`: 92x124 (looks blurred)

## Changes

- Explicitly set `resizeMode` to `.none`

`.none` is the default value when building the project with Xcode 10.

Is there any delegate method to listen when camera has take a photo?
I want to take the captured photo immediately and put it to my image cropping controller.
**Problem:**
When the gallery is in arabic with semanticContentAttribute set as .rightToLeft some components chance its location while others don't.

It also causes the flash button to overlap with its title

**Solution:**
Adding support for arabic languages which use rightToLeft display.

I would really appreciate if you can make a fix for it ðŸ™Œ 

Hi, I have a question how I could make ImagesController adaptive to dark mode or are you going to add such option?
iOS 13 Default presentation style has changed the FullScreen presentation into a modal page sheet. Can you add an option for us to select fullScreen option :)

Hi, I would like to open different tabs when user clicks different buttons in my UI. However the maximum i could get was to set the initial tab.

I want to be able to set the tab index before opening the galleryController. Is there a way to do it. I have though of reaching to PagesController since it is the child of GalleryController to set the tab index but i dont believe that's a nice solution.

Will be grateful if you can help :)
