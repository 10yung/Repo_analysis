https://cdnjs.com/libraries/angular-spinner is out of date. Could you import v1.0.1 please?
Hi Uri

I have added overlay on older angularjs spinner. Please merge it on angularjs-spinner-overlay branch. Few folks are still working on angularjs version, so it will be helpful for them.

Please let me know your thoughts, if it doesn't seem fit to you.

Thanks

can we add overlay to whole page using spinner
We added us spinner in our project and a preloader comes whenever there is a service call. We managed to fade the page while preloading. now there is a requirement that we need add a text under the loading spinner. is it possible? I think it is a cool feature to have if you can extend this directive that would be great.

Hi Urish, thanks for the nice plugin. I am facing a peculiar situation. If I use spinner-key="spinner-1", my application is not all opening in IE9. If I remove and use only  <span  us-spinner="{radius:20, width:8, length: 16}"  ></span> then my application is working fine both in firefox and IE9. But when I use  <span  us-spinner="{radius:20, width:8, length: 16}" ></span>, even in firefox the problem I am facing is, the place where I have used $scope.stopSpin(); there the spinner is starting!!! and never stops. The same is happening both on IE9 and firefox. Instead, if I use    <span  us-spinner="{radius:20, width:8, length: 16}" spinner-key="spinner-1" ></span>  the spinner starts and stops correctly and my application works fine on firefox, but on IE9 the my application is not at all starting, it just scraps off.  Please find my related post on stack overflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29941710/angular-spinner-is-not-appearing/29941999#29941999.

Hi Urish, Thanks for the nice spinner. The example plunker given on github showing the following error on ie9.

[object Error]{description: "Unspecified...", message: "Unspecified...", name: "Error", number: -2147467259}

 In my angular js application if I comment out,  <span us-spinner="{radius:30, width:8, length: 16}" spinner-key="spinner-1"></span>,    my application working fine on ie9. But if I uncomment this line the application is not at all running and is displaying the above error. 
How can I fix it? Please see the error image for reference.

Getting default color from the element style is better than writing color constants in HTML/JS. Especially when colors come from SASS variables.

Right now the code use `attr.spinnerKey` to determine the key value. However in many cases we want the key to be a variable that can be eval to some string keys. This should be supported by adding a eval function.

Can we disable & shade out the application background... Something like jquery's block UI plugin

I've been using a different "way" of creating controllers, so is not exactly as your example.
I can't get the spinner to start:

```
var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute', 'ui.bootstrap', 'toaster', 'angularSpinner']);

angular.module('myApp').controller('productsController', function($scope, $modal, $http, toaster, usSpinnerService) {

    $scope.hey = "hey!";
    usSpinnerService.spin('loading-products');  // <-- not working, no errors thrown though.
    ...

});
```

My view is as follows:

```
  <h1>Products</h1>
  {{hey}}

  <span us-spinner="{radius:30, width:10, length: 16}" spinner-key="loading-products"></span>
```

"hey is correctly displayed" (just as a reference)

Am I bringing the usSpinnerService service in an incorrect manner?
Thank you.

I though of asking this in stackoverflow but here you can also tag the issue as a question, right? sorry if not.
