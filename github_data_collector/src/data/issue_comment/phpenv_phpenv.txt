Hello,

i don't know where to ask... cause there is no info about google groups or something like that. 

but. 

i've installed 7.2.12 with phpenv - and plain php works fine. 
now i want to add modules, like ldap, mcrypt and some others... how i can do that? 

i've installed `pear` - but it doesn't contain needed modules. 
next i tried to install `pyrus`.  
to work - it is needed to run like that `php /home/phpenv/.phpenv/versions/7.2.12/bin/pyrus.phar`... this is ok, but when i'v trying to install `mcrypt`:
```
# php /home/phpenv/.phpenv/versions/7.2.12/bin/pyrus.phar install https://pecl.php.net/get/mcrypt-1.0.1.tgz
Pyrus version 2.0.0a4 SHA-1: 72271D92C3AA1FA96DF9606CD538868544609A52
Using PEAR installation found at /home/phpenv/.pyrus
Mime-type: application/octet-stream
Pyrus\Package\Exception: Could not download from "https://pecl.php.net/get/mcrypt-1.0.1.tgz"=========>] 100% (32/32 kb)
 Pyrus\PackageFile\Exception: Invalid package.xml

   Pyrus\XMLParser\Exception: Line 137: Element '{http://pear.php.net/dtd/package-2.0}notes': This element is not expected. Expected is ( {http://pear.php.net/dtd/package-2.0}stability ).
```

how i can install these modules?
hello,

it is cool that now it generates simple systemd config. 
so my FR is to add something like this: 
```
User=$username
Group=$usergroup
```

to `[Service]` section in `php-fpm.service`.

it is not a problem to add it by myself... but would be cool to limit it on installation step.

ps. and same with php-fpm.conf - cause default user is www... and it is not relevant.  
This issue is meant to track a feature roadmap for the 1.0.0 Milestone.

At the very least, this should put phpenv in parity with changes from rbenv 1.0.0, afterwards, release version numbers can be made to track rbenv version numbers. Please state other phpenv-specific roadmap features to be included for tracking here.

I'm opening this in response to https://github.com/phpenv/phpenv/pull/92 which puts phpenv in line with rbenv and is very much appreciated, but is too big a PR to do in just one go, and will need to be broken down and tackled on a per-feature (or at least per-command) basis.
I have not found a way to complete the test on phpenv-global with Apache apxs link library.

TODO: Is that needed?
I tried to install the latest versions available on php-build but without luck. I tried to install:
```
5.6.38
7.0.32
7.1.22
7.2.10
```
and they all come back with
```
-----------------
|  BUILD ERROR  |
-----------------

Here are the last 10 lines from the log:

-----------------------------------------
configure: error: Cannot find libz

```
or 
```
-----------------
|  BUILD ERROR  |

Here are the last 10 lines from the log:

-----------------------------------------
configure: error: Cannot find zlib

```
depending by the version.

Command Line Tools are installed and they are up to date, definitely something to investigate further.

As per PR #56, phpenv may not be sourced by a graphical login if it is only sourced in `.bash_profile`; however, the instructions in README.md specifically point to `.bash_profile`. This may cause some unexpected behavior for some users during installation and thus needs to be amended with a more robust instruction.

https://askubuntu.com/questions/121073/why-bash-profile-is-not-getting-sourced-when-opening-a-terminal/121075#121075

Not acceptable solutions:
 - source phpenv from `.bashrc` (bash-specific, triggers on each subshell)
 - force use of `.bash_profile` (bash-specific)
 - tell users to source `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` or `.profile` from one or the other (bash-specific; invasive of user preferences)
 - use complex logic to determine if we sourced bash_profile (bash-specific, brittle, interferes with shell emulation)

Needs testing to determine if this is an issue. Specifically:
 - sshd login: working as expected
 - terminal login: working as expected 
 - GUI login: working as expected
I just tried to install this through homebrew, it wasn't available as a package. Are you the ones I should talk to about this or are they?
I had  to install autoconf, bison, libjpeg-dev, libpng12-dev, re2c and had to research these because the  error messages weren't clear coming from phpenv.

Is it possible to make one nice sudo apt-get list? It would be a huge timesaver for  people...

This will scare away less experienced people in my opinion. 

Also, could you guys make the default repo clone branch master?
Is that a thing?

Add a Tipp to Topic 2.
Adding to .bash_profile will only work, if you start bash with tty... Additional info see here: http://askubuntu.com/a/121075

If you mean **broke** you won't be wrong and you can [![Donate to phpenv](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=K7Q5585APK7MW) to help us with that.

If you mean **broken** we can help **you** with that but first lets see what is really going on there.

Since we hide all the gory details it may happen that something broke and no errors were displayed. 

We attempt to log everything to 2 files, one for **stdout** and one for **stderr**, which can be found under `/tmp`. Information from both the log and log.err may be useful to identify the problem. It may however happen that the scripts fail even before we get to start writing to the files.

To see what is happening behind the scene we can enable the `PHPENV_DEBUG` option which will cause the scripts to output all the commands being executed.

```
$ export PHPENV_DEBUG=1
```

We are mostly concerned with the last few commands to see where it actually caved. Try and work out in which directory the script currently executes from. For most of its tasks this would be `~/.phpenv/php-src` the source code repository directory but it may be that the command was executed from the phpenv home directory `~/.phpenv` or somewhere else instead. 

Try and execute the last command from the debug output, which is the one that caused phpenv to fail and exit, to see if we can find the error message and identify the problem.

if you are still unable to fix it or even if you were able to resolve the issue please let us know about that by submitting a new issue.

In order for us to reproduce the problem and get a solution for you as quick as possible these are some things you can supply to help us to help you.
1. What operating system and version are you using?
2. What version of bash are you using
3. What are the exact commands executed which caused the failure
4. What was the standard output?
5. If you think it may help post a link to a gist of the debug output or just the last 10 odd lines of that.
6. Can you see anything from the bottom of the log files perhaps that may help in finding a resolve.

The most important part of solving these issues is for us to be able to reproduce the problems first. Create a new issue and write down as much as possible and give it a good description but before you submit first preview the message and follow as you read. Can you reproduce the problem based on the information you've given? Good, now press submit and someone will get back to you shortly.
