There are some spell not suit for Android new api spell, may we change it.

As "compile" is going to be deprecated end-2018, this PR replaces with "implementation" that is the new usage.
Hi

First of all I would like to appreciate for creating such a cool nice, library.

I have created the [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) bridge plugin for using this library with React Native projects

I have added the same in README. Can you please merge this request so that if someone is looking to use this library for React Native projects can easily do the same

Please let me know in case any changes are required

As described in other issues, the default size of the drawable is too small, but using `mm_scale="2"` makes it too big. A float scale would allow apps to pick a more sensible value.
Toolbar().getMenu().getItem(0).setIcon(MaterialMenuDrawable)
