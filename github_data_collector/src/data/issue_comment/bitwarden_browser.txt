This step may be redundant since Gulp is already included as a devDependency for the project. The step is currently causing builds to fail so it's probably best just to remove it
@angular/http module has been deprecated. HTTP requests should now be done with the @angular/common/http module.

See here:
https://angular.io/guide/deprecations#angularhttp

It looks like there were no usages of this dependency in the project so removing it was pretty simple üëç

Requires https://github.com/bitwarden/jslib/pull/58 in jslib that fails the automation check.
Minor detail of course and it's great the extension already works but the email notifications for a new login state:

Subject: New Device Logged In From Chrome Extension
Body: Your Bitwarden account was just logged into from a new device.
[...]
Device Type: Chrome Extension
[...]

I actually got two email messages, one mentions Chrome, the other Chrome Extension.
Hi,

I ran in to an issue using my Yubikey series 4 for 2fa on Bitwarden today, 1/15/2019. Brave browser version v 1.2.42.

**Steps to Recreate**
1. Click Bitwarden Plugin in Brave
2. Click 'Login'
3. Enter email and master password 

**Bug**
Result: The plugin will immediately throw repeating errors 'Error 4: U2F Error'. These errors don't stop popping up, they appear ever half second and keep cycling through, regardless of whether the key is plugged in or not.

**Other Scenarios**
I tested the plugin with the chrome browser, thinking that it may have been my recent Yubikey 2FA FIDO U2F setup, but the chrome browser extension worked fine logging in with my yubikey.

**Context**
I recently obtained a premium subscription (last couple days), and set up 2 yubikeys I have for FIDO U2F. (These are old yubikeys, probably series 4 as best as I can tell).

During the setup process, I initially set up both Yubikeys for Yubico OTP 2FA. I then decided to switch methods, set each up yubikey up for Fido U2F, and then deleted the Yubico OTP keys.

It causes a memory leak in firefox and uses all available memory. Consistent issue and happens every time the extension is enabled
Firefox version: 72.0.1
Running Archlinux 5.4.11-arch1-1

Hi,
Autofill partially works for Samba Bugzilla.
https://bugzilla.samba.org/
Strangely enough, first autofill fills username.
Running autofill again then fills both username and password.
Thank you üëç 
Hi,

https://login.microsoftonline.com/
Custom field : `loginfmt : me@mail.com`

No issue with Firefox and Chrome : the Email field is properly autofilled with the custom field.
However, with Safari, it is not.
Strangely enough, if I manually put some characters into the Email field, then, autofill will work.
Rather weird.

Thank you üëç 
Hi,
Autofill does not work for Dynatrace.
https://sso.dynatrace.com/
Don't know if it's related to the 2 steps login form.
What is strange is that E-mail is not filled-up, but password is.
Thank you üëç
