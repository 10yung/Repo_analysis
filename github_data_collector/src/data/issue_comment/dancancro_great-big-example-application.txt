This app could use a more robust system for handling errors.

This demonstrates an order-taking application, some fancy style and effects tricks, and integration with third party apis.
There is a bunch of things that could use fixes. They're labeled 'TODO'. Just search for that and see if you can find a solution to the problem.

I've noticed there are a lot of unused imports, bad syntax (doesn't follow style guide, isn't consistent) across the entire project. I could sweep up some junk for this project. Let me know your thoughts
