When I present as popover modal style the view is empty, in blank. I tried with another presentation styles and works. When I present as popover the first time (when it asks for permissions) I can see the photos and albums but the second time there is not content, even in navigation bar. 

After selecting multiple photos on iPad pro, got below memory warning and app crashed
```
[GatekeeperXPC] Connection to assetsd was interrupted or assetsd died
Message from debugger: Terminated due to memory issue
```

I am using `pod 'CTAssetsPickerController',  '~> 3.3.0'` version
How,

Hi,
I do not see any code that contains iCloud. Please explain.
I could not find the info.plist .  the product crashed  without adding the privacy to access the media and the camera
可以单选图片，并且编辑裁剪吗？类似选择头像逻辑

There is a crash on Fabric that "Invalid update: invalid number of items in section 0. The number of items contained in an existing section after the update (589) must be equal to the number of items contained in that section before the update (589), plus or minus the number of items inserted or deleted from that section (0 inserted, 1 deleted) and plus or minus the number of items moved into or out of that section (0 moved in, 0 moved out)."

It crash on **CTAssetsGridViewController.m line 374
__52-[CTAssetsGridViewController photoLibraryDidChange:]_block_invoke**

It seems that user delete a photo but datasource did't update? please help

            if(imageData.length == 0){
             NSLog（@"该照片尚未从ICloud下载"）；
             }
         }];
