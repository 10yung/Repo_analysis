Initially, I was running bspwm on DisplayPort-0 with a 1080p monitor. Recently, I got a new 4k display and I plugged it into DisplayPort-1 and disconnect Displayport-0. Then all the sudden I cannot login to the window manager.

The only way I found bspwm working is I put 4K DP cable into DisplayPort-0 the port previously used. 

Super weird!

I am using Arch and my graphics card is AMD readeon vega 64.

Also, I have the following lines in my config:
```
bspc config remove_disabled_monitors true
bspc config remove_unplugged_monitors true
```

Couple thing I tried, no luck make it working:
1. I remove all the monitor setting from my [bspwmrc](https://github.com/ztlevi/Dotfiles/blob/master/desktop/bspwm/config/bspwm/bspwmrc#L7-L15), restart. Bspwm fails.
2. After removal, I add `bspc monitor -d {1,2,3,4}` to bspwmrc. Restart and bspwm fails.
3. Try use a HDMI cable and plug it into GPU's HDMI port instead of DP. No luck.
I don't know if anybody else is having problems but I've now had the same issue on both an Ubuntu and a Mint install.

I'm installing by downloading from the Git repository and making the binary with gcc as per:

[https://github.com/windelicato/dotfiles/wiki/bspwm-for-dummies](https://github.com/windelicato/dotfiles/wiki/bspwm-for-dummies)

 but after install  none of he key bindings work.

If I swap to a different login terminal I can confirm bspwm and sxhkd are both running.

Attempting to issue a command through bspc results in an error message "Failed to connect to socket".

/tmp/bspwm_0_0-socket has been created but the variable 'echo $BSPWM_SOCKET' is empty, even if I set it BSPWM_SOCKET='/tmp/bspwm_0_0-socket' that doesn't solve the problem.

Is this an issue or is there something wrong with my systems config.

New to bspwm, switching from i3. I wonder if there is a way to configure bspwm so that focus is moved to the leftmost node when I'm at the rightmost node, pressing super + right?

i3 works in this fashion in all directions.

Another example:
If I'm at the northmost node, and and press super+up. I'd like focus to be set to the southmost node, instead of not changing focus at all.

Best regards
Hi!

I started to use bspwm. I love it!

I have a question: Is that possible, when I want to resize a window, while a hold the mouse button, the effect only resize the border? It take less computer usage. I attach a file about what I mean, this function from i3wm.

Thank you for your feedback and for developing!

Hello, first of all, I absolutely love this wm ...but ever since I started using it this one thing is constantly on my mind. When I fullscreen a window, what as a user I would expect is that this window is maximized and everything else stays the same. In reality (correct me if I m wrong) what happens is that every window is fullscreen bellow the chosen one (or maybe it just gets removed temporarely from the tree?). What exactly happens is irrelevant but point is, that me pressing fullscreen triggers resize events on windows bellow. This is meaningless for most of the people, but as I work with a project that has javascript that refreshes webpage when window gets above/bellow width threshold, its very annoying. Even if this would not happen, resize a bloated webpage is often resource heavy and useless in this case. Recently I watched a dude's screencast and he used transparency and clearly saw window bellow so i would think they all sit bellow maximized.

This project is amazing and this is very minor issue of mine, but I would love to see behavior like this : press fullscreen -> window gets on separate ws -> empty node gets pushed on its place ....when i go out of fullscreen it all reverses. I can imagine scripting this with bspc but I m not really sure how would this work when i maximize program by its "fullscreen handle" outside of WM's keybind.
Fixes #829
I want raise floated windows above other windows only when focused. Otherwise the floated windows can stay behind any other window. Currently they are always above.

Any advice on how I could achieve this? Thanks
Hi. 
I just started using bspwm about a week ago, loving it right now. Thanks to all contributors!

I'm wondering about implementing a feature like [i3 marks](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#vim_like_marks), which allows tagging windows/nodes with arbitrary strings that can then be used for selection(instead of other window properties like title, class).

Short of adding native support for this, I guess I'd have to
* implement storage of tags/node associations. file backend? in-memory backend?
* command to tag/untag window(s)
* garbage collection, could be implemented as a daemon listening on window close events using `bspc subscribe`, or as a check on every invocation of tagging commands.

If somebody already did something similar, or has any recommendations on how to do this well(e.g. minimizing memory footprint and complexity), I'd love to hear it.

Thanks!

When uninstalling a game, upon clicking “Uninstall Game...”, the Uninstall window is spawned behind the games properties window. Which then triggers this bug.
