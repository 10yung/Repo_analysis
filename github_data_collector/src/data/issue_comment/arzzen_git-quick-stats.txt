* Users can now switch between allowing merge commits in their stats,
  showing only merges in the stats, or ignoring merge commits in
  the stats all together.

  Showing merges might be good for people who wish to see the entire
  history as git shows it by default. For this, setting the new variable
  _GIT_MERGE_VIEW to enable will show merge commits in the stats together
  with normal commits.

  Showing only merges might be useful for people who wish to see how
  much of their git history is taken up by merges alone. It can be useful
  for re-evaluating a particular workflow. For this, setting the new var
  _GIT_MERGE_VIEW to exclusive will show only merge commits in the stats.

  The default action is to not display merge commits.

Resolves #88
Added ability to use `_GIT_WITH_MERGE` option
It would be nice if we could add the ability to not show stats related to merges.

output: unknown terminal "xterm" 



#### Expected behavior and actual behavior.
Right now there are some statistics on the current or a specific branch, I couldn't find a way to output per user commits for instance of all branches. Would be nice to have.

(original issue #75)
#### Expected behavior and actual behavior.
Expected: Show date and time of the most recent commit in the commit history for an author.
Actual: Shows the date and time of the last commit attributable to the author in the commit history.

* a1234567 - (2018-05-01) (HEAD -> master) Commit #1 \<Author>
* b2345678 - (2018-06-01) Commit #2 \<Author>

The above commit log will show Author's last commit was 2018-05-01, instead of 2018-06-01.
Hi,

this is a feature wish :) it would be awesome if this could be used in a dir with lot git projects and the stats would show a summary about all git projects.

Best Regards
Sven

Would be nice to have stats, per contributor, for the current day.
