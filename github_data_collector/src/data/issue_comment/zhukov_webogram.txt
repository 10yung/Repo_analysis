Why is telegram web not being updated to support new features such as new emojis, animated stickers and scheduled send?
Threema has this feature.

Would be ideal to have in Telegram, too!

I used web.telegram.org for a long time, but some time ago (don't know exactly... maybe a half year ago...?!) push notifications stopped working.

I added the web app to homescreen (chrome for android app). Also checked the permissions, deleted all data ("app", cache and all stored data), but still no (closed browser) push notifications?
Sometimes the tab is flashing "1 notification", then I click on the tab and check the message, but when I leave the tab, the tab title continues flashing "1 notification" and calling for attention.

It seems that simply clicking the tab isn't enough to clear the notification, and I have to stay about 2 seconds with the page in focus for the title animation to clear.

My suggestion is to reset the tab title to "Telegram Web" as soon as the tab is clicked.
I suggest that to use this format

`(1) Telegram`

Is better for mental health than animate title between `Telegram Web` and `1 notification`.

The current notification scheme in the web title is super annoying for me.

Thanks
