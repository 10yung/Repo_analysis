# Tasks

```rake
namespace :app do
  desc "Confirmation"
  task :confirmation do
    puts <<-WARN
    ========================================================================
      WARNING: You're about to deploy the branch...
               #{fetch(:branch)}

    if fetch(:value) !~ /^y(es)?$/i
      puts "\nDeploy cancelled!"
      exit
    end
  end
end
```

### Expected behavior

When using `ask` ([offcial documentation](https://capistranorb.com/documentation/getting-started/user-input/)), the console should wait for user input.

### Actual behavior

**On Git Bash (Windows)**, When using `ask` ([offcial documentation](https://capistranorb.com/documentation/getting-started/user-input/)) to get user input, the console never stops and automatically uses the default value.

### System configuration

- Windows 10
- **Terminal app: [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)**

### Steps to reproduce
Deploy an application to a remote host, change app repo url in Git, update repo url in Capistrano config, try to deploy the app. It won't deploy. You'll get an error (see below). To resovle the problem you need to `ssh` onto the remote host and remove `repo` folder, then re-deploy. It looks like Capistrano relies on repo url from `repo` folder. I am posting this thread as a suggestion for improvement, because I think that it would be nice if we didn't have to remove `repo` folder manually, secondly, I struggled to figured it out for an hour or two so we could save other people's lives trying to solve similar problem.

### Expected behavior
App should deploy

### Actual behavior
```
git exit status: 128 (SSHKit::Runner::ExecuteError)
git stdout: GitLab: The project you were looking for could not be found.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```

### System configuration
Please link to the output of `cap <stage> doctor` in a GitHub Gist.

Thanks for helping improve Capistrano!

I run `cap production deploy` and got this error:
```
$HOME/.rbenv/bin/rbenv exec bundle exec rails webpacker:clobber
(Backtrace restricted to imported tasks)
cap aborted!
Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - ( export RBENV_ROOT="$HOME/.rbenv" RBENV_VERSION="2.5.5" RAILS_ENV="production" RBENV_ROOT="$HOME/.rbenv" RBENV_VERSION="2.5.5" RAILS_ENV="production" ; $HOME/.rbenv/bin/rbenv exec bundle exec rails webpacker:clobber )

Tasks: TOP => webpacker:precompile
(See full trace by running task with --trace)
The deploy has failed with an error: No such file or directory - ( export RBENV_ROOT="$HOME/.rbenv" RBENV_VERSION="2.5.5" RAILS_ENV="production" RBENV_ROOT="$HOME/.rbenv" RBENV_VERSION="2.5.5" RAILS_ENV="production" ; $HOME/.rbenv/bin/rbenv exec bundle exec rails webpacker:clobber )
```

This is my deploy.rb file:
```
lock "~> 3.11.0"

set :application, "myapp"
set :repo_url, "git@github.com:githubusername/myapp.git"

# Deploy to the user's home directory
set :deploy_to, "/home/deploy/#{fetch :application}"

append :linked_dirs, 'log', 'tmp/pids', 'tmp/cache', 'tmp/sockets', 'vendor/bundle', '.bundle', 'public/system', 'public/uploads'

# Only keep the last 5 releases to save disk space
set :keep_releases, 5

set :default_env, { 
	RBENV_ROOT: "$HOME/.rbenv", 
	RBENV_VERSION: "2.5.5" ,
	RAILS_ENV: "production"
}

before "deploy:assets:precompile", "deploy:yarn_install"

namespace :deploy do
  desc 'Run rake yarn:install'
  task :yarn_install do
    on roles(:web) do
      within release_path do
        execute("cd #{release_path} && yarn install")
      end
    end
  end
end

namespace :env do
  	desc 'Print enviroment variables'
  	task :env do
	  on roles(:all) do
	    execute "env"
	  end
	end
end

after 'deploy:updated', 'webpacker:precompile'
```

I also have a file in server /home/deploy/myapp/.rbenv and /home/deploy/myapp/.rbenv-vars that contain:
```
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=ohai
SECRET_KEY_BASE=1234567890

STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=x
STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY=y

RBENV_ROOT=.rbenv
RBENV_VERSION=2.5.5
RAILS_ENV=production
```
What is the solution? 
I've posted a similar issue several days ago but I am seeing weird behavior of Capistrano again when deploying different branch.

I want to test the deploymnet of my `maintenance` branch. I will use it whenever I want to turn off my application for the time of maitenance. I pushed the branch and this is my config.

`config/staging_maintenance.rb`
```
set :user, 'apps'

set :stage, :staging

set :deploy_to, "/home/#{fetch(:user)}/app/shop-#{fetch(:application)}/production/"
set :branch, 'maintenance'

server 'XXX.XXX.XXX',
  user: 'apps',
  roles: %w{web app db},
  ssh_options: {
    forward_agent: true,
    port: 6667
  }

namespace :npm do
  task :build do
    on roles(:app) do
      execute "cd #{current_path} && npm install && npm run build"
    end
  end

  task :restart do
    on roles(:app) do
      execute "sv restart /home/apps/runit/service/shop-lauber-frontend-web-1"
    end
  end
end

before 'deploy:cleanup', 'npm:build'
after :deploy, 'npm:restart'
```

The latest commit on this branch is `ae4980a47e0fdc8067d3d46683cf3464484b90eb` 
```
git log
commit ae4980a47e0fdc8067d3d46683cf3464484b90eb (HEAD -> maintenance, origin/maintenance)
Author: Jędrek Domański <jedrek.domanski@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Jul 16 11:41:01 2019 +0200

    Add maintenance page
```
In `current` folder I check it:
```
cat REVISION
ae4980a47e0fdc8067d3d46683cf3464484b90eb
```
In the stacktrace I can see that `current` folder is symlinked with `20190716095633` which is the latest release so I check it in `20190716095633` folder.

```
cd 20190716095633
cat REVISION
ae4980a47e0fdc8067d3d46683cf3464484b90eb
```
Everything fine.

But in `/repo` folder I do not see this commit:
```
git log
commit a9ca7b8687c4fd0a00225095f481ccd12d2aec7d
```
What's going on here?
This line confirms that the `maintenance` branch got deployed and the latest revision is at `ae4980a47e0fdc8067d3d46683cf3464484b90eb`
```
Running /usr/bin/env echo "Branch maintenance (at ae4980a47e0fdc8067d3d46683cf3464484b90eb) deployed as release 20190716095633 by jedrek" >> /home/apps/app/shop-lauber-frontend/production/revisions.log
```

I tried removing the `repo` folder and re-deploying but that didn't help. I shouldn't have to do that when I want to deploy a different branch, I think.

Full stacktrace.

"DEPLOY FAILED" is in red, and "Refer to log/capistrano.log..." is in yellow... but neither are actually in my terminal window, they've scrolled out of the current terminal view, because of the 20 log lines appended to them. (Yes, the intermediate newlines between log lines are ther ein my output too, which doesn't help, but even without them I think it would make the failure notice too easy to miss). 

* Is there any way to turn off the "Here are the last 20 lines:" feature?
* Should the red `** DEPLOY FAILED` message be REPEATED after the log lines?

Even if configurable to be different, I think this is not a great experience for newbies. It's too easy to run a cap deploy and think it ran successfully, when it failed. Especially because a typical cap deploy has so much logging already, the repeated "last 20 lines" just look like more of it, unless you know what the terminal output _should_ end with, and realize it's _not_ there, or think to scroll back to look for an error message... it is far too easy to not realize your deploy failed. 
Rebase of https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/pull/1492. See that for discussion.

Fixes #1221 

/CC @signe
### Steps to reproduce
Can not possible to reproduce. It happens complete randomly (random time, random projects, random servers).
We use `capistrano` with Jenkins to deploy apps to servers.

### Expected behavior
```bash
15:44:49 00:00 git:wrapper
15:44:49       01 mkdir -p /tmp/appname/
15:44:49     ✔ 01 deployer@10.10.10.10 0.259s

15:44:49 00:00 git:check
15:44:49       01 git ls-remote --heads git@github.com:orgname/projectname.git
```

### Actual behavior
```bash

### System configuration
cap \<stage\> doctor [link](https://gist.github.com/maidmantis/f5cf38c80a196baaa002bc4502ab283e
)
### Additional Info
Found solution for similar issue: 
just add bash command `sync` on remote server right after uploading instruction. It flushes all IO buffer to HDD.
### Summary

Previously, if `svn_username` or `svn_password` contained e.g. whitespace, the SCM commands would fail.
This PR uses the `shellwords` library (part of `stdlib`) to properly escape them.

### Short checklist

- [x] Did you run `bundle exec rubocop -a` to fix linter issues?
- [ ] If relevant, did you create a test?
- [x] Did you confirm that the RSpec tests pass?
- [x] If you are fixing a bug or introducing a new feature, did you add a CHANGELOG entry?

### Steps to reproduce

#### config/deploy.rb
```set :deploy_to, ->{ "/var/www/vhosts/#{fetch(:application)}" }```

#### config/deploy/production.rb
```set :application, "example.org"```

### Expected behavior
Command `cap production deploy -p --dry-run` prints.

```
------- Printing current config variables -------
:deploy_to => "/var/www/vhosts/example.org"
:application => "example.org"
```

### Actual behavior
Command `cap production deploy -p --dry-run` prints.

```
------- Printing current config variables -------
:deploy_to => "/var/www/vhosts/"
:application => "example.org"
```

### System configuration
https://gist.github.com/patrickbussmann/d81bb558cdf4d55c24a5a3eb596b5b18

### Additional information
I read the documentation here. https://capistranorb.com/documentation/faq/how-can-i-access-stage-configuration-variables/
And it says `The deploy.rb configuration is executed first and then the stage file(s) from config/deploy/*.rb are executed next. `
But for this I'm using this lambda lazily loaded thing.

So I think I made it right but the system understands it wrong.
I have been using Capistrano for many years , now I am facing a strange behavior 

when I run cap deploy 

it first ask for the server password , I type it and everything works fine , then my local passphrase key , also it works fine .

when it asks for the passphrase keys for the remote server keys , I need first to type 2 Enter Keys to make it work for the first passphrase key , for the second passphrase key , any key I press (with or without Enter key ) ,  it is abort the whole process 
~~~
    [serverID] executing command
 ** [serverID :: out] Enter passphrase for key '/home/deployer/.ssh/id_rsa':
Password: (works with 2 Enter Keys )
 ** [serverID :: out]
 ** [serverID :: out] Enter passphrase for key '/home/deployer/.ssh/id_rsa':
Password: (Any Key I press , it continue and throw permission denied error)
 ** [serverID :: out]
 ** [serverID :: out] Permission denied (publickey).
 ** [serverID :: out]
 ** [serverID :: out] fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
~~~

I am using capistrano 2.13.5 ( I updated it to the latest version and nothing changed ) 

ruby 2.2.6p396 

Rails 3.2.22

net-ssh  , 3.2.0


in deploy.rb file I set these values 
~~~
set :pty,  false

default_run_options[:pty] = true
ssh_options[:forward_agent] = true

~~~
