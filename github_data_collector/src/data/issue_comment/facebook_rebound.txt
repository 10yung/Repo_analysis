Hi.

[SpringOverScroller.java#L86-L87: getCurrVelocity](https://github.com/facebook/rebound/blob/65f155c6cf4e7594da636b2ab5215067e24da6ae/rebound-android-playground/src/main/java/com/facebook/rebound/playground/examples/scrollview/SpringOverScroller.java#L86-L87)

```
  public float getCurrVelocity() {
    double velX = mSpringX.getVelocity();
    double velY = mSpringX.getVelocity();
    return (int) Math.sqrt(velX * velX + velY * velY);
  }
```

It is suspicious that the variables 'velX' and 'velY' are initialized with the same value.

Probably, it should be:

```
  public float getCurrVelocity() {
    double velX = mSpringX.getVelocity();
    double velY = mSpringY.getVelocity();
    return (int) Math.sqrt(velX * velX + velY * velY);
  }
```

Please help me.
Error:Error converting bytecode to dex:
Cause: Dex cannot parse version 52 byte code.
This is caused by library dependencies that have been compiled using Java 8 or above.
If you are using the 'java' gradle plugin in a library submodule add 
targetCompatibility = '1.7'
sourceCompatibility = '1.7'
to that submodule's build.gradle file.
