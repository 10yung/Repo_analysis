I am working on your online book and projects using Python 3.5. Since I used a different and newer python version, I came across several problems and solved them by making some changes in network.py and mnist_loader files.  Now the code is compatible with Python 3.5
The biggest problem is zip variables haven't len() attribute in 3.5. So I converted training_data, test_data to the list variables. I had to make a deep copy of original training and test data because when they are converted to list variables, they can't be reused.

I added just "import _pickle as cPickle" line because in 3.5 cPickle isn't defined and it should be used in standard library version.
Just to keep code clean and easier to read on editors with plugins such as [vim-trailing-whitespace](https://github.com/bronson/vim-trailing-whitespace).
