When trying to agree to the terms so I can use the tool it refuses to run due to insufficient permissions and just closes. It opens the AGREE.txt file and tries to read from that however the file is not present in install or on this repository at time of writing. If I am missing something please feel free to help guide and troubleshoout the problem until it works. Thanks in advance!

Please help
error terminal
When running installation, it's suppose to copy file "L" to /bin but it isn't copying properly. Simple fix for this is to copy the file "L" alone, instead of the whole directory.
