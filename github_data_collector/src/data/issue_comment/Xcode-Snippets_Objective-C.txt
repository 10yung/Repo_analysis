codesnippet file format was changed in Xcode8.  

Install old codesnippet files in xcode 8 will make xcode crash.

all these snippets files should be changed.

BTW:  ruby gem xcodesnippet should be updated too. see https://github.com/Xcode-Snippets/xcodesnippet/pull/8
When install these snippets,Xcode can't input any word.It will crash! I don't know whether reason is new version for 8.0!

A little extension

We do not need to mention `__strong` since it is by default.

Add two code snippets, one for post notification, one for add observer.


Thought it would be helpful to notify users of the xcodesnippet gem and provide instructions for installing all snippets at once.

The original summary missed a word. :heart:
