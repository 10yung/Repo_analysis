@suzuki-0000 Hi, 
When we refer self from a weak to strong, we often had used `` `self` ``  be surrounded by backticks.
However this is compiler bug, it has been resolved in Swift 4.2 by `guard` be able to capture `self` as it same name.

Hello everyone, 

Firstly thank you for this very helpful framework. When I select an image It shows as It must be, but when I close the image with swipe down gesture and when I try to open an image It appears with bugs, swipe down not working or responding anymore and transparent gray background appears instead of black background. I need your helps, thank you. 

This is the screen shot of what I faced of.
