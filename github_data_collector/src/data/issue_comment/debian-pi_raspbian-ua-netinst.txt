Hi, today I've build the zip but first had to change the kernel version from 4.9.0-3 to 4.9.0-4 in update.sh and build.sh because the linux-imagekernel-image-4.9.0-3-rpi is not in the repos anymore. Could you please update the files?
It seems that the Raspbian kernel development is dead in the water.
Changing over to the Raspberry Pi Foundation kernel or supporting both (via a parameter perhaps) should be considered.

Please use this issue to discuss the pros, cons, what-ifs and howtos.

 
some packages that might be needed during installation (e.g. firmware-ralink from non-free, needed for WiFi setup), but aren't available, because the source isn't listed in /etc/apt/sources.list

I propose a new setting, which by default would be empty, and would enable the installer to create a file (i.e. /etc/apt/sources.list.d/raspbian-ua-inst.list).
this way the installer would have access to packages from that repository as well

at least, I think it would... would be nice :angel:
