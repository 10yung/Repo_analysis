When generating a model using `--force-plural`, the factory_bot adapter still emits the singular form as the factory name.

Example:
```
> rails g model FileMedia filename:string --force-plural
...
invoke      factory_bot
create        spec/factories/file_media.rb
```

This is working as expected. The contents of the factory, however, are:
```ruby
FactoryBot.define do
  factory :file_medium, class: 'FileMedia' do
    filename { "MyString" }
  end
end
```
Notice that the auto-inflected singular form `:file_medium` is used instead of the requested plural, `:file_media`.
