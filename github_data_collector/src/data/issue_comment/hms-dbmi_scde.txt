I am not able to reproduce the tutorial example with last scde version from bioconductor. About one week ago it was working fine.


```
# load example dataset
data(es.mef.small)

# factor determining cell types
sg <- factor(gsub("(MEF|ESC).*", "\\1", colnames(es.mef.small)), levels = c("ESC", "MEF"))
# the group factor should be named accordingly
names(sg) <- colnames(es.mef.small)  
table(sg)

cd <- clean.counts(es.mef.small, min.lib.size=1000, min.reads = 1, min.detected = 1)

o.ifm <- scde.error.models(counts = cd, groups = sg, n.cores = 1, threshold.segmentation = TRUE, save.crossfit.plots = FALSE, save.model.plots = FALSE, verbose = 1)

```

The error I get:

```

In short, I'd like to do something like:
```
pagoda.show.pathways(c("GO:0044421"), varinfo, go.env, cell.clustering = hc, margins = c(1,5), show.cell.dendrogram = TRUE, showRowLabels = TRUE, showPC = TRUE)
```
but for clusters shown in the `pagoda.view.aspects()` plot, such as `genecluster.26`

Hi, I want to cite the package SCDE in my paper. But I do not know how to discribe the rationale of this packages. Most importantly, it is difficlult for me to understand the parameters, including lb, mle, ub, ce, Z and cZ. I have attempted to search the relevant information in your paper publised on journal-Nature Method(Bayesian approach to single-cell differential expression analysis). But, my effort ended in failure. Could you explain the meaning behind these parameters or provide me some learning materials to read. Thank you~~~
Hi,

I mentioned in #73 that after several attempts i still have the flexmix problems, which remains unaddressed up to this day.

I noticed that you have made some updates on biodonductor page [https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scde.html]. I happened to have a new PC with me in completely new and clean environment (Win10).

I installed R3.5.1, and then run your installation scripts:

> if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
>     install.packages("BiocManager")
> BiocManager::install("scde", version = "3.8")
> For older versions of R, please refer to the appropriate Bioco

The installation run smoothly, and after that I was able to load scde. Below are the sessionInfo:

I then went on to run very simple scripts:

> knn <- knn.error.models(cd.in, 
> 	k = K, n.cores = NUMCORE, 
> 	min.count.threshold = 1, 
> 	min.nonfailed = 2, 
> 	max.model.plots = 10,
> 	verbose=1)

And I immediately got these errors:

> adjusting library size based on 2000 entries
> cell : calculating cell-cell similarities ... done
> fitting cell models:
> cell.1 : SRR7887424
> Classification: weighted 
> Error in FUN(X[[i]], ...) : 
>   trying to get slot "logLik" from an object of a basic class ("function") with no slots
> cell.2 : SRR7887425
> Classification: weighted 

At which point I stopped the program.

Would you pls help me by looking into this?

Is it possible to compute the p-value of overdispersion for given gene sets in a more strict manner as done for the denovo identified pathways?

The gene sets I'm working with were generated based on gene-gene correlations, so I want to be careful and not estimate the statistical significance of their overdispersion. 

Thanks!!!

Error in checkSlotAssignment(object, name, value) : 
  assignment of an object of class “expression” is not valid for slot ‘defineComponent’ in an object of class “FLXMRglmC”; is(value, "expressionOrfunction") is not TRUE

This error was raised before  (#44) but none of the suggested solutions work.

Hi,

I have previously installed and successfully run your 'scde' package (after many difficulties also, and i couldn't remember how it ended up being successful finally, other than that i also downgrade the 'flexmix' package to 2.3-13 version). 

However, our server (Linux based) recently went through some upgrade, and they are now providing R3.4.3 and R3.5.1, instead of the old 3.2.5 that i worked on. I have successfully installed 'scde' package on our server's new R3.4.3 under my own folder (non-admin); **and i am still struggling to install 'scde' for its new R3.5.1 on our server as of now**. Unfortunately, even for the R3.4.3 that has now a 'scde' installed, as i re-ran my old codes of PAGODA, it reported a lot of errors:

> adjusting

> Error in new("FLXMRglmCf", FLXMRglmC(..., family = family), mu = mu) :

I am aware that these are much the same to some of other issues brought up by other people, but my 'flexmix' has been particularly downgraded to your issue #40 , but never succeed. These are the sessionInf() on our server:

To see if I can install your package from a completely clean R,  I downloaded a latest R3.5.1 to my own **windows PC**, completely clean, and carried out these installation processes:

> install.packages(c("Cairo","Rcpp","Rook","rjson","RColorBrewer","RMTstat","extRemes","quantreg"))
> source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
> biocLite(c("RcppArmadillo","edgeR","pcaMethods","BiocParallel"))
> install.packages("modeltools")
> install.packages("devtools")
> require(devtools)
> devtools::install_version('flexmix', '2.3-13')
> biocLite("scde")

It did succeed in installing the packages. And i again re-ran my old PAGODA codes on this R3.5.1 on my windows PC, but again it reported these errors:

> adjusting library size based on 2000 entries

Hi , I was wondering if you have a way to import 10x data. cheers
I couldn't install it in Windows 
http://hms-dbmi.github.io/scde/package.html

but I tried Bioconductor and it works 
https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scde.html

Kindly add how to install it using bioconductor in your wiki page.
Hi,

I've tried regressing out (continuous) confounders (e.g., cell cycle) so that the differential expression results won't be effected by them, but it doesn't work. I get the same results. I tried using pagoda.subtract.aspect, but then when I run scde.expression.difference, it makes no difference.

Would be great if there is a way to make it work.

Thanks a lot!
Livnat
