imagemagick's `import` command freezes the desktop while the region is being selected. It would be awesome to have this functionality in maim.
As title. 
My awesome config about this part:
```
        -- Screenshot                                                                                                                                         
    awful.key({ }, "Print", function()                                         
                awful.util.spawn("maim '/home/edison/Pictures/Screenshots/" .. os.date("Screenshot %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S Fullscreen.png") .. "'") end),
    awful.key({ "Shift" }, "Print", function()                                 
                awful.util.spawn("maim -s '/home/edison/Pictures/Screenshots/" .. os.date("Screenshot %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.png") .. "'") end),
    awful.key({ "Control" }, "Print", function()                                                                                                              
                awful.util.spawn("maim | xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -i") end),
    awful.key({ "Shift", "Control" }, "Print", function() 
                awful.util.spawn("maim -s | xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -i") end),
```

Above two line work while another two always cause seg fault.
I tried change the key combination (like modkey + p) but the result still same.

Also,  `maim | xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -i` in terminal works fine.
It seems like WebP is going to be the format of the future, since it outperforms PNG for the same result, so omitting it from `maim` is a bit unfortunate. Client support is pretty wide, but I'm not really sure how many open libraries there are for it. Is that why?
I'm using the latest git version of maim on a Gentoo Linux system.

I can make maim crash by running the following command:

    $ maim --nodecorations test.png
    terminate called after throwing an instance of 'cxxopts::argument_incorrect_type'
      what():  Argument ‘test.png’ failed to parse
    Aborted (core dumped)

On the other hand the following command doesn't crash:

    $ maim --nodecorations=0 test.png

I'm attaching a gdb backtrace:

Please tell me if you need other informations.
When trying to take an screenshot the selection box replicates alot of times and get on the final file
cl that i'm using "maim -s -o| xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png"
Is still possible to take an screenshot without the box on the way but i need to disable it with the "-b 0"
"maim -s -o -b 0| xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png"
Hi, I have recently packaged maim for the official Fedora repository. This PR just adds the link to the `README`.
On KDE Plasma, when using `maim --select` and selecting a window, the window decorations are replaced with part of the screen contents (apparently, relative to where the selected window was originally spawned). The problem seems to happen with any application.

![internal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/906008/62009249-a11a5880-b14c-11e9-8982-f632a4015635.png)

(Here, the content of the top of the screen is being shown instead of Alacritty's title bar.)

By using `maim --geometry $(slop)`, the problem does not occur.

![slop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/906008/62009258-bb543680-b14c-11e9-9286-bbe9bb722bf0.png)

The problem also happens on the whole window border when they are enabled:

![border](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/906008/62009252-ae374780-b14c-11e9-8bad-ffcd2b05fbbe.png)

`maim --version` is `v5.5.3`; `slop --version` is `v7.4`.
Scrot contains the following command:

```-e, --exec command ```
```Exec command on the saved image.```

It's useful because it allows commands like these:
```scrot 'Snapshot_%Y_%m_%d_%H-%M-%S_$wx$h.png' -q 100 $1 -e 'xclip -se c -t image/png -i "$f"'```
Where the image is saved to a file and the resulting file is operated on (in this case copied to the clipboard).

In maim, one would need to capture the date beforehand and use it in two separate operations like so:
```filename=~/SomeDir/Snapshot_$(date +%Y_%m_%d_%N).png```
```maim $1 $filename -q 100 && xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -i $filename```

While this solution is elegant in this case, it would be nice to have a native option for piping maim to multiple programs. 

The ```tee``` program is a possibility, but it reduces the ability to use maim options. For example: If I want to save the image with predefined quality value, then there is no way to use tee with maim in a way that preserves this. The following line would not work for example since xclip refuses input that contains the ```-q``` flag.
```maim $1 -q 100 | tee ~/SomeDir/Snapshot_$(date +%Y_%m_%d_%N).png | xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png```


I've been playing around with adapting maim in my scripts for a little bit so I'm interested to see if there's something I missed or if maim is intended to be used this way. Feel free to let me know if there's anything that wasn't clear.
I've been having an issue for a while that i've just recently pinned down.

I use maim daily to take screenshots, the command I usually use is `maim -s -u -b 3 -p -1 $1 /dev/stdout | xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png`
My current setup is three monitors, I have one 1600x900, and two 1920x1080 monitors, though the middle one is physically bigger than the second 1080p monitor.

The issue I'm having is basically that I can't consistently take screenshots of anything on the middle (physically largest, 1080p) monitor. It usually just fails and clears the paste buffer.
From what I've found
- selecting a region instead of doing the auto window select seems to succeed more
- it works almost every time if I capture a solid color image( for example a blank terminal)

I usually get no error output, and when I run maim manually (not piping anywhere) it either works, and prints out a result to my terminal or will sit there and the command will never complete.
In addition to this, sometimes when I try by using the aforementioned command earlier in this post, it will sometimes print out
```
X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  18 (X_ChangeProperty)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x2e002c2
  Serial number of failed request:  19
  Current serial number in output stream:  19
```
Other times it will complete silently but I will end up with an empty paste buffer.
I at first thought I was having an issue somewhat similar to #100 in that maybe my quality was simply too high and that taking screenshot from that monitor just took too long to process, and got some semi-consistent results in being able to: take a screenshot, wait a few seconds longer than usual, and then be able to paste that screenshot, but that no longer really works. I've also tried lowering the quality to no avail.
To add to the confusion, sometimes it works fine, literally within seconds of itself, I can try to screenshot a window, have it not work, then have it work fine if I just try enough times. 

Sorry this issue is mostly just explanations of specific behaviors I'm getting that I'm sure you won't be able to reproduce, I'd be more than happy to debug this further if there's a way to make maim more verbose.
