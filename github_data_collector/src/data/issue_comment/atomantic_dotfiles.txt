Java is amazingly hard to install on MacOS.

Would it be possible to add support for https://sdkman.io ?

In `config.js`, I would like to list which java things I want to install. 
For example

```javascript
module.exports = {
  sdkman: {
     java: "13.0.0.j9-adpt",
     gradle: "5.6.3",
     kotlin: "1.3.50",
     kscript: "2.8.0"
  }
}
```
Hi,

After the most recent run of the `install.sh` file, I have noticed that directories that are synced to iCloud have had their local copies disappear and remain in iCloud only.  Are you able to tell me what the setting was on this in the file for me to change and try to revert?

... I may have switched to using a Brewfile.  Interested in a PR?
After I've checked [this post](http://stratus3d.com/blog/2015/02/28/sync-iterm2-profile-with-dotfiles-repository/), I noticed that we can have iTerm2 configured that way we like loading custom preferences from a custom folder.

Can we add support for this?

Maybe adding a folder iTerm2 at root, and adding to ```install.sh``` an option to activate this option in iTerm2.
Hi there,

I would like to add some personal hosts, but don't want them to be versioned. It makes sense to include this kind of customization? If not, we have always to manage files that should be committed and not.

Idea: add an extra file, something like ```/configs/hosts.custom``` that should be appended to ```/etc/hosts``` at the install.sh, and add that extra file to .gitignore?
Not sure if that's how its supposed to look like but I see question marks in the terminal as below.

It doesn't look right. Can you advise, please?

Hey so I decided to use Automatic as a test since i'm about to fry and clean install my Mac os Sierra box right now.

I'm a dev so I actually already have my .vim/.vimrc.git/bash* files etc an tmux files that i've loved for a while and was hoping to either replace them or just limit my install to those suckers.

In addition after I ran your auto things I've been getting a few rather annoying issues and some terminal errors. It seems clear that i'm missing a .npm folder but not an expert so not sure what will be entailed in the fix.

Error is:
```
cat: /Users/prussiap/.nvm/alias/default: No such file or directory
prompt_nvm:5: failed to compile regex: empty (sub)expressionv
```

I'm attaching the screen shot of my iterm after close/open and reboot. I've done a bit of google but nothing speciffic.

Also I seem to have some sort of fast reppeatt.. like hitting a d will give medddddddddddddddddddddd or a few enters or something like. not sure where that setting came in but it's rather annoying to get letters in 3s (or more.)

Any help appreciated. Maybe I can mix and match and incorporate my vimrc/tmux and a few other like my .ssh configs in there since they are memory motion things by now.

Thanks in advance,
D
