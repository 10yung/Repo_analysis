It would be nice if the `Open recent` menu in under `File` would filter projects that are in the project manager.
My use case is that my most used projects are in the project manager but prototypes and such are in `Open Recent` and now they get pushed out by projects from the project manager that I never open through `Open Recent`.

git, workspaces, remote,...
When working with remote workspaces, Project Manager's "List Projects to Open" command is no longer a good replacement for the built-in "Open Recent...": As far as I know there's no way to let Project Manager know about remote workspaces, while they do appear in "Open Recent...".

Here's an example with a workspace opened via the Remote SSH extension:

It is possible to run the "Save Project" command in that workspace, but this doesn't actually work when you try to open it (the saved project has the path on the remote machine as a `rootPath`).

I'm not sure how Project Manager could programatically open a remote workspace. Maybe it would have to invoke a command of the specific remote extension that is used (SSH, WSL, Container...). I wonder how VSCode does this internally in the "Open Recent..." UI.
closes #284

When you have a remote workspace open, you will suddenly notice that the project manager commands are no longer working. This is because VSCode defaults to running extensions on the remote / as a "workspace" extension: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_can-an-extension-access-local-resources-or-apis-when-a-user-is-connected-remotely

This fixes this by changing the default to `"ui"`, so Project Manager runs locally. I'm not sure it makes much sense to run Project Manager remotely, but having it in the `"extensionKind"` array still allows for this.

The documentation of this extension keeps mentioning the term "project", but never clarifies what is meant by that. VS Code already has a built-in way of managing what most of us think of as "projects", but decided to name them "workspaces" instead.

This leaves me a bit confused:
* How does a project differ from a workspace?
* What does the notion of projects add that isn't already achieved with workspaces?
* What relationship, if any, is there between projects and workspaces?
* When using projects, do we still need to set up workspaces as well? Yes/no/optional? And if optional, what features would we miss?

It would be nice if these things were clarified in the README to avoid confusion.
Often, a project / repository name is not verbose enough, and an additional field "description" may be useful to provide that missing information layer. Maybe that information can be displayed in the side bar as a hover string or something similar, what do you think?
Hi there,

A little context about my scenario:
I'm usually working on VVV vagrant projects involving WordPress theme development. That means every time I start a new project VVV creates a new WordPress instance as git repo in the /www/ folder. For each instance I start a git project inside its /public_html/wp-content/themes/ folder and that's actually what I'm working on and what I'm interested in tracking.

Example:

```
/www/site_1/public_html/wp-content/themes/project_1/
/www/site_2/public_html/wp-content/themes/project_2/
and so on...
```

I tried to setup `"projectManager.git.baseFolders"`with a wildcard as `/Users/username/vagrant-local/www/*/public_html/` to filter out `site_1`, `site_2` etc., but I found out Project manager it's not supporting wildcards (yet).

Of course I can add projects as favourites saving them manually, not a big effort :), but as I discovered there is some interest in this (see #278 ) do you think that can be a feature to look forward in the near future?

As mentioned that's not something that prevents me to use and love this extension, but would be very handy having the option to just load all projects at once as git projects automagically.
When scanning for projects it would be nice to have the ability to include the parent folder name.

For example if you have this structure:

- projects/clientA/someproject
- projects/clientB/someproject
- projects/clientC/someproject

You currently will have no idea which project is listed because they have the same name like so.

- someproject
- someproject
- someproject

It would be nice to have at least one above folder visible:

- clientA/someproject
- clientB/someproject
- clientC/someproject

Hi, I have been facing this issue since the last 4-5 months. If there is an unsaved file and If I try to switch to another project, It shows a popup window asking what should be done for the unsaved file. If I select "Don't Save" everything freezes until unless I kill vs code.

First  thanks to all developers countributing to this plugin, I like this plugin very much. 
But when I add too many projects in project manager list, I find it`s hard to find out which project this is. So I wander could you add this function : highlight current project in list, 
Finally thanks for your reading.
