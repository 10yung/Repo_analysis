Hello. I'm try to compile old versions of utox, but got fail.
I see here, in this [`BUILD.md`](https://github.com/uTox/uTox/blob/develop/docs/BUILD.md#cygwin-setup)
the following package: toxcore ([x86](https://build.tox.chat/view/libtoxcore/job/libtoxcore-toktok_build_windows_x86_static_release/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/libtoxcore-toktok_build_windows_x86_static_release.zip)/x64),
and there is inside that [libtoxcore-toktok_build_windows_x86_static_release.zip](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/files/3831334/libtoxcore-toktok_build_windows_x86_static_release.zip)
,
I can see the following files:
```
\lib\libvpx.a
\lib\libopus.a
\lib\libopus.la
\lib\libsodium.a
\lib\libsodium.la
\lib\libtoxcore.a
```
But compiler return me an error, because `libtoxdns.a` and `libtoxav.a`, and compilation is terminated:
```

```

How to get `libtoxdns.a` and `libtoxav.a`? Can you compile it and attach it here, please?
A bridge between Tox and [Matrix](matrix.org). Here is corresponding issue on [Matrix side](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-wishlist/issues/145).

I know it probably one of the most asked questions. But I can't find a detailed, or even a simple explanation.

How the software identifies an user without revealing the IP if the core idea of tox is p2p, and a centralized identification makes tox not p2p at all?
Also, some informations about that hash functioning (tox ID) and how it replaces the IP sharing would be great to be at FAQ.
After reading the doc ["DHT protocol"](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/master/docs/updates/DHT.md), ["Tox-Docs/Text"](https://github.com/Tox-Docs/Text/tree/master/src_text),and even ["bep_0005"](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html), I know a lot about the toxcore's run mode, but  it's still very hard to get a comprehensive description in my mind. 
**_I think, a comprehensive description in brief and friendly to an ordinary/advanced users is necessary._**

**Here is what confused me:**
1. in ["DHT protocol"](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/master/docs/updates/DHT.md),it mentioned ""friends" list", it stors  8 clients' "information"(i.e. ip addresses + port + node_id + timestamp of the friend) closest to each "friend",does it store the friends' "information"(same as above) .

2. in ["Tox-Docs/Text"](https://github.com/Tox-Docs/Text/tree/master/src_text),it mentioned "onion model",but i don't know if has it been implemented by the toxcore(and is Tox-Docs reliable,i.e. things mentioned in it is just in working and absolutely not done?!). 
in ["bep_0005"](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html), it has the concept "node" and "peer". so:

    2.1 dose toxcore creat a new id(?or called peer_id or chat_id?  infact,a key-pair's pub key) when an user startup a client program and just for this conversation?
        if it does,how does it work between node_id and the new id? 
        if it created,but not just for this conversation,does toxcore's route table (inluding the "clent list" and/or ""friends" list" said in ["DHT protocol"](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/master/docs/updates/DHT.md)) is base on the newly created id(?or called peer_id?) or not?

    2.2 dose toxcore chat with a friend on a "onion model" by defalt(i.e. not directly to his friend but through a random first jump and jump sevral times to his friend)
        if it does,how does it work?
        if it doesn't,how does it work?
3. it seems that the ["Toxcore todo list."](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/master/docs/TODO.md) doesn't sync.

**where could i get a brief and complete description about how does it work in detail?**

**Could the "README.md" include a "DidLst!" that well sync? and a "A brief and complete description about how does it work in detail!"**



Good day,

I am trying to print out the value of a friend, who sent message. No matter what I am trying, can't get it to work. I've looked into your code in other *.c files, and you were printing "uint32_t friend_number" normaly with printf.

How I've tried so far:
#include <inttypes.h> //for PRI and etc

void friend_message_cb(Tox *tox, uint32_t friend_number, TOX_MESSAGE_TYPE type, const uint8_t *message, size_t length, void *user_data){

    printf("1: %lu \n", friend_number);
    printf("2: %lu \n", (unsigned long)friend_number );
    printf("3: %"PRIu32"\n" , (uint32_t) friend_number ) ;

}
Hello. I use latest toxic-9999 and tox-9999 on gentoo. Toxic is connected through Tor with udp disabled.
Toxic reports v0.7.2_r1747

After long use, it loose any connectivity with all contacts, but toxic showing it is online. People on qtox seeing me offline forever, me too.

Right after I restart toxic, connectivity is immediately restored and I see online people, and they see me.

This happens every day (or once per 2 days) for long time. Now when people started reaching me by phone, saying WTF where are you on tox? I decided to create this issue.

Please help.

P.S. I created this issue on toxic, but I think it is CORE-related. 
Please, go easy on me. I'm a complete novice to Github.
I compiled toxcore with `--enable-daemon` flag as specified in the guide, then copied and edited `tox-bootstrapd.conf`. The only changes I made in the file were set `enable_ipv6` to `true` and specify valid nodes at the bottom. I checked everything to be working both through the systemd unit with the `status` command and with netstat. The latter shows that only tcp6 and udp6 ports are used.
```
netstat -luptn | egrep "tox"
tcp6       0      0 :::33445                :::*                    LISTEN      2145/tox-bootstrapd
tcp6       0      0 :::3389                 :::*                    LISTEN      2145/tox-bootstrapd
udp6    2304      0 :::33445                :::*                                2145/tox-bootstrapd
```

What am I doing wrong?
As we all know, today more than ever before, it is crucial to be able to trust our computing environments. One of the main difficulties that package maintainers of Linux distributions face, is the difficulty to verify the authenticity and the integrity of the source code.

The Arch Linux team would appreciate it if you would provide us GPG signatures in order to verify easily and quickly of your source code releases.

**Overview of the required tasks:**
* [x] Tag a release on github
* [x] Please [create and/or use a 4096-bit RSA keypair](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GnuPG#Create_key_pair) for the file signing
* The key may be used for [email encryption](https://www.enigmail.net/index.php/en/) too
* Keep your key secret, use a strong unique passphrase for the key
* [x] Upload the public key to a key server
* [x] [Sign every new commit by default](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-using-gpg/)
* [x] [Sign new tags](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-tags-using-gpg/)
* Verify the Github Release tarball download against your local source
* [x] [Sign Github Release tarballs](https://wiki.debian.org/Creating%20signed%20GitHub%20releases)

Thanks.
Hey! @irungentoo 
I've created these two issues:
https://github.com/Antox/Antox/issues/344
https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/issues/1601

Please, I've created first one 4 months ago - take a look at it carefully, and merge it, or say what's left. I was unable to build the tox4j.so myself, and your Jenkins fails to create it either:
https://build.tox.chat/job/tox4j_build_android_armel_release/
 
Both of these issues are passing most tests etc. I hope you are still delighted to make Tox project totally working and final. This project is really a future - please help building it and make one more step to its greatness :)

Let's make Tox better!
