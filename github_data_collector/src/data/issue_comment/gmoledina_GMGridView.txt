Great project,for sure. But I have an issue when adding custom view on the GMGridViewCell object and try to perform an animation.  I add one rotation animation on my image view. This image view is added on a GMGridViewCell.   Animation.repeatcount is set to max ,however the repeat count is random. Could you please give me an answer how to fix this ?

- (GMGridViewCell *)GMGridView:(GMGridView *)gridView cellForItemAtIndex:(NSInteger)index
{
    GMGridViewCell *cell = [gridView dequeueReusableCell];
    cell = [[GMGridViewCell alloc] init];
    cell.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithHexStr:@"#f5f5f5" alpha:1];
    NSString *sceneStr= [self.scenesArray objectAtIndex:index];
    AndLinkNewRootSceneItemView *sceneItemView = [[AndLinkNewRootSceneItemView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, cell.frame.size.width, cell.frame.size.height) scene:sceneStr];
    [cell addSubview:sceneItemView];
    [self.sceneItemViewList addObject:sceneItemView];
    return cell;
}

#import "AndLinkNewRootSceneItemView.m"
-(void)addanimation{
    CABasicAnimation *animation = [self spinAnimationWithDuration:1.0 clockwise:YES repeat:YES];
    animation.delegate = self;
    [self.curSceneImageView.layer addAnimation:animation forKey:@"rotationAnimation"];
}

- (CABasicAnimation *)spinAnimationWithDuration:(CGFloat)duration clockwise:(BOOL)clockwise repeat:(BOOL)repeats
{
    CABasicAnimation *anim = [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@"transform.rotation.z"];
    anim.toValue = clockwise ? @(M_PI * 2.0) : @(M_PI * -2.0);
    anim.duration = duration;
    anim.cumulative = YES;
    //anim.autoreverses = YES;
    anim.removedOnCompletion = NO;
    anim.repeatCount = repeats ? CGFLOAT_MAX : 0;
    return anim;
}


the CGFLOAT_MAX doesn't work.

The image link in README.md is broken.

Exporting the "UIGestureRecognizer+GMGridViewAdditions.h" and "UIView+GMGridViewAdditions.h" file so that user can use the static lib and the headers instead of the whole project.

Another delegate method added so that user could set which cell/index they want to moveable.

i am using button in GMgridviewCell like order cart button but when ever i am clicking that button first didTapOnItemAtIndex delegate method is called after that only button action is called.

Hello,

This is a mostly mechanical diff to make GMGridView compatible with Swift while using Objective-C Bridging.

Basically, delegate method names beginning in 

```
- ($TYPE)GMGridView:(GMGridView *)gridView ...
```

 collide with the class name. Also, as per Cocoa Guidelines, I stripped the GM prefix from method names, so the new methods look like this

```
- ($TYPE)gridView:(GMGridView *)gridView ...
```

Maybe you can join a group function

NSInteger positionToLoad;

```
            GMGridViewCell *cell = [self newItemSubViewForPosition:positionToLoad];
            [self addSubview:cell];
```

===========Whether should change to this?==============
NSInteger positionToLoad = 0;

```
            GMGridViewCell *cell = [self newItemSubViewForPosition:positionToLoad < 0 ? 0 : positionToLoad];
            [self addSubview:cell];
```

gridview.edit=yes,how to use sortingdelegate?


Hey, I have been using GMGridView recently and have noticed that from time to time  a cell with an image will get stuck on the screen while dragging the cell to a new location. The image will stay stuck in front of all views on in the app. The only way to remove it is to close the app and restart it. I haven't gone looking for the cause of the problem yet and thought I would post this here first. If I find a solution I will post it here too.

Thanks
