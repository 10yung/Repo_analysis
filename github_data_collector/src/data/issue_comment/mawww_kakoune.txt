# Steps
1. Open kakoune `kak`
2. `<a-K>`

### Outcome
1. `<a-k>` keep matching

### Expected 
1. `<a-K>` keep not matching

# Information
### Versions tested
* v2019.07.01-329-gb765fb49
* Kakoune v2020.01.16

### System information
* OS: GNU/Linux Debian buster (stable) `Linux siga 4.19.0-5-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.37-5+deb10u2 (2019-08-08) x86_64 GNU/Linux`
* DE: Xfce4
* WM: Xfwm4
* Terminal: xfce4-terminal `$TERM=xterm-256color`, st `$TERM=st-256color` and kitty `xterm-kitty`
* No multiplexer
* Keyboard works properly.

### Note
This seems to affect every ALT+SHIFT+Key combination such as `<a-K>`, `<a-)`, `<a-(`, `<a-">` 
### Rationale

Provide a simple interface to map the various flavors of the pending modes, while keeping simple to change the behavior of all minor modes through their parent mode.

- `object`
- `prompt`
- `goto`
- `view`

It could be useful to extract that command from the [`kakrc`].

Just a minor thing, I feel like some newlines were forgotten and formatting of the last news was a bit inconsistent... Let me know if I misunderstood and the current formatting is intended.

The question is if you want to keep this spec file which will be updated from downstream, or we should have only the downstream spec.

What do you think?
Previously the handlebars filetype threw an error since the hbs highlighter depends on the `html` module. This resolves part of https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/3230 .
After using kakoune, some of the colors in my terminal are permanently changed for that terminal instance. The different colors are noticeable to me when I use git with diff-so-fancy. I cannot reproduce the issue using the default macOS Terminal, just iTerm2. The configuration of iTerm2 doesn't seem to matter.

macOS 10.14.6
Kakoune v2019.12.10
iTerm2 3.3.7

#### Minimal kakrc to reproduce
```
colorscheme gruvbox
add-highlighter global/ number-lines
```

### Steps
1. Set kakrc to the above.
1. Open iTerm2
1. Run `printf '\033[1;32;48;5;22mtest\033[m\n'`
1. Run `kak`
1. Close kak

### Outcome
The color of the output from the first command changed!

### Expected
The colors don't change.

Previously, the keywords were a mess. They contained the shellâ€™s reserved words and some arbitrarily selected builtins. I generated the word list using bash because it contains all POSIX builtins and is common for scripting. I separated keywords and builtins because it felt weird to have `if` and `cd` highlighted in the same colour.

In variable assignments some characters that are allowed to be in variables used to not be highlighted, e.g. hyphens. With this PR all characters except whitespace are considered to be part of the variable.
