While running the tool I noticed that exception occur but are not stored 

Get-SDMGPOSecurity : No mapping between account names and security IDs was done. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070534)

This occurs when the GPO settings are applied to a SID which is no longer accessible (deleted account, ...) - AKA IdentityNotMappedException This is often possible while assessing "well established and poorly managed" domains, and I believe will be encountered when running this tool outside of labs. 

I'll try to submit a PR later today.
