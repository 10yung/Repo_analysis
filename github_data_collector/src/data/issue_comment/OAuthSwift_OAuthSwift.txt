Need some helper methods to generate random code verifier and code challenge. In order to adapt pace protocol, currently I'm using two class methods from https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS to generate them. I think it'll be very handy to have them in `OAuthSwift` as well.

like:
`+ (nullable NSString *)generateCodeVerifier;`
`+ (nullable NSString *)codeChallengeS256ForVerifier:(nullable NSString *)codeVerifier;`

the earlier version in iOS 9 and iOS 10, I am able to share the cookies between them. but in case of iOS 11, there are new changes from Apple side due to security problem.

### Description:

OAuth1Swift isn't properly filling out the `Authorization` header and doesn't support signature method on the initial token request

The RFC calls for signing the initial unauthorized token request:
https://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#auth_step1

The most sane approach in my opinion is to get rid of the conveniences on `OAuthSwiftClient` and instead pass in an instance of `OAuthSwift`:

```swift
open class OAuthSwiftClient: NSObject {
  public init(oauth: OAuthSwift) { ... }
}
```

This object has the URLs, etc. that are necessary and then we can attach signature method, etc. to it. In addition, it might be wise to refactor the `Authorization` header generation out of the credential as we don't yet have a credential when making the initial request.

Any help is appreciated.


### Description:

I'm getting a 401 response trying to upload a file. Other requests (GET, "regular" POST, etc work perfectly fine.
So this request:
        
    let imgData = Data(...)

    auth.client.postImage(url, parameters: params, image: imgData, success: { (response) in
        print(response)
    }, failure: { (error) in
        print(error)
    })

throws a 401, while 

    let imgData = Data(...)

    auth.client.post(url, parameters: params, headers: nil, body: data, success: { (response) in
        print(response)
    }, failure: { (error) in
        print(error)
    })

completes successfully.
Additionally an error is logged during the failing request:

    CredStore - performQuery - Error copying matching creds.  Error=-25300, query={
        class = inet;
        "m_Limit" = "m_LimitAll";
        ptcl = htps;
        "r_Attributes" = 1;
        sdmn = "Web Password";
        srvr = "master.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org";
        sync = syna;
    }

The [App Programming Guide for watchOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/WatchKitProgrammingGuide/iOSSupport.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014969-CH21-SW1) recommends the use of background sessions when making network-based operations.

The library uses `URLSessionConfiguration.default` by default, but it would be good to be able to use [`URLSessionConfiguration.background(withIdentifier:)`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/urlsessionconfiguration/1407496-background) when needed.
Seem to be having issues with the google+ authentication with soundcloud... When trying to authenticate a user after entering a users google information there's no redirection it works for email and Facebook but for google it just shows a blank screen as you can see below. This is using the SafariURLHandler btw.
