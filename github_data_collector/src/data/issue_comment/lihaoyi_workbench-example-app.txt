I've updated all the dependencies to today's versions and ran `fastOptJS` and `fullOptJS` to ensure the project compiles. I've added `.idea/` to `.gitignore` as I imagine many people use IntelliJ's Scala plugin.
I'm getting error when trying to compile akka-http demo:

`workbench-example-app/example/jvm/src/main/scala/example/Server.scala:56: type mismatch;
[error]  found   : akka.http.scaladsl.server.Directive1[String]
[error]     (which expands to)  akka.http.scaladsl.server.Directive[(String,)]
[error]  required: akka.http.scaladsl.server.RequestContext => ?
[error]           extract(entity(as[String])) { e =>
[error]                         ^
[error] one error found
`
Some 4 years after the last commit in the repository, it seems that the required rbt version 0.13.7 is nowhere to be found. To oldest sbt version known to https://www.scala-sbt.org is `0.13.15`, while the latest in the 0.13.x series is `0.13.17`. Setting the latter as the required sbt version inside `project/build.properties` fixes project's startup. SBT versions from 1.0.x seem not to work.

I guess this change would need to be merged in the other branches too.
Hi, 

demo site: http://www.lihaoyi.com/workbench-example-app/map.html

seems to be down.
I've tried the autowire-akka-http branch and it didn't compile anymore.

This pull request 

- fixes the akka-http Server compilation error
- fixes a warning in the js module concerning the usage of scalajs.concurrent.JSExecutionContext.Implicits.runNow.
- updates the akka dependencies
hey @lihaoyi 
First of all thanks for educating to many of us. I am working through example for server and client and in https://github.com/lihaoyi/workbench-example-app/blob/autowire-akka-http/example/jvm/src/main/scala/example/Server.scala#L21 I found

```
script(`type`:="text/javascript", src:="/client-fastopt.js")
```

This is fine for development, but when using `sbt-native-packager`, this will break because the file name renames to `client-opt.js`

How can we fix this? Thanks a lot again
The `refreshBrowsers` feature does not work in the `jvm-js-shared` branch example.
When sbt is run using `~re-start` the expected behavior is that the browser reloads after a change to the JS-file. However, a manual refresh is needed.

I assume this is because `refreshBrowsers` is by default triggered after `fastOptJS`, but this is too early and we would need a trigger after the server restarted.
However, what surprises me that if I make another the change the refresh does not pick up the first change.
updated akka-http-experimental to akka-http 10.0.0
remove .idea files from the project
