Adds `Package.swift` file which enables usage with SPM and closes #57.
**Note**, that the most correct usage with SPM will be possible only when there is new release that includes `Package.swift`. Until then, dependency can be added by branch or commit hash which is not allowed in published packages.

Hi,

Can you add feature like clock sliding from arc from circle  like apple clock
Now that swift package manager is officially backed by apple it would be awesome for this library to adopt it.
This feature allows us to use a pointing icon for thumb that always points in the 90 degree tangent at any point (I believe it is called _normal line_). This is enabled by rotating the thumb.

@HamzaGhazouani please let me know what you think.
This PR addresses the issue #20: Setting the start position.

It is based on solution by @spaluchiewicz and [this PR](https://github.com/HamzaGhazouani/HGCircularSlider/pull/21). I was unable to update the existing PR due to the access rights so I'm setting up a new one.
Commits are squashed to keep it clean, but @spaluchiewicz is kept as the coauthor. I hope this is fine.

In addition to setting the new position, I also tweaked the current implementation so that user can't swipe over the maximum and under the minimum value. Please let me know if you think it's appropriate or if we should make it a property that can be set. (Issue #10 )
Hello, i add "github "HamzaGhazouani/HGCircularSlider"" to my Cartfile, update dependencies and add framework in "general>linked frameworks and libraries", but when i change class on my view, view does not display slider.

Hi,

I want to make a progress view that looks like this.

![screen shot 2017-09-06 at 9 57 25 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2551877/30094494-43d301ea-92ea-11e7-98d8-f2cff7cc4288.png)

I can't seem to set the `startPointValue` to a position shown in the image above. It gets set to 0.
I was just wondering if there is a way to animate (without user interaction) the slider to a specific value?
