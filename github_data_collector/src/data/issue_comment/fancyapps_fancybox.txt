I use a customized layout to display the caption in a side-panel, see this codepen: https://codepen.io/acwolff/full/qLZOLv

If I scroll to the end of the long caption and next click the arrow to display the next slide, the scroll bar is not reset to position 0, although I use this code to reset the scroll bar position:

$(".fancybox-custom-layout .fancybox-caption").scrollTop(0);

What should I do to reset the scroll-bar if the next slide is displayed?

I am using FancyBox for mp4 videos and wish to close the box on end of video

I have looked through FancyBox documentation but could not find anything concrete. I see there are a few threads for youtube videos, however my videos are all local

Am using the following html code below

$('data-src').on('ended',function(){
    $.fancybox.close();
});

html code
`<-- div class="imagebox">
 <-- a data-fancybox data-type="video" data-src="video/myvideo-01.mp4" href="javascript:;">
 <-- img data-u="image" src="img/myvideo-01.png" title="My video" /></a>
<--/div -->`

Any ideas on the code required to close a local mp4 video after the video has been played using FancyBox?

Thanks
**Describe the bug**
Occasionally after closing a fancybox image, something invisible blocks the underlying page. It appears as though the image is still being displayed, although only the underlying page is visible. Clicking and dragging in Chrome or Firefox when this happens results in the previously displayed image being dragged to a new tab, indicating that the image is still present but not visible. This only happens after opening and closing fancybox multiple times without a page reload. Reloading the page resets the behavior.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Click on fancybox-enabled link to open image in fancybox.
2. Close the fancybox (either Escape, the close button, or clicking outside the image).
3. Repeat 2-3 times until you can no longer click on anything.

**Additional context**
This occurs on a site using Rails 5.2.2, Turbolinks 5.2.0, and fancybox 3.5.7.

The arrowLeft and arrowRight HTML created by the fancybox JS routine contains invalid HTML, as reported by https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input and other validators.

The issue is the DIV within the BUTTONs. DIVs are not allowed inside BUTTONs; the DIVs could be turned into SPANs and validate, however. Do the SVG elements need to be enclosed in DIVs at all here?

```
<button data-fancybox-prev class="fancybox-button fancybox-button--arrow_left" title="{{PREV}}">
    <div>
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M11.28 15.7l-1.34 1.37L5 12l4.94-5.07 1.34 1.38-2.68 2.72H19v1.94H8.6z"/></svg>
    </div>
</button>

<button data-fancybox-next class="fancybox-button fancybox-button--arrow_right" title="{{NEXT}}">
    <div>
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M15.4 12.97l-2.68 2.72 1.34 1.38L19 12l-4.94-5.07-1.34 1.38 2.68 2.72H5v1.94z"/></svg>
    </div>
</button>

```

Simple I just want to drag down to close the lightbox, like as application mobile.

Because in my web design, the popup is display at the bottom of window, so if we drag up, there is a blank space and it's bad user experience I think...

In my case, just drag down is good way to make a better UX

When I click on the image hidden html5 video start in modal. When I click close image is streched vertically (up to the parent div element, ignoring padding).


I've noticed that the close button does not appear immediately when modals are opened. Is there a way around this to make it appear without any delays? In this case, the project in question is using Fancybox 2.1.5. Upgrading is very likely not an option.
Is there a way to add a clickable link to the infobar?

Thanks in advance
I would like **FancyBox** to have the feature of emulating the display view as if it were a Desktop on mobile devices when a global setting of the type is set:

`EmulateDesktopView = true;`

In this way even those who do not have a responsive website can exploit **FancyBox** without having to compromise excessively limiting or impeding.

Example:

```
$('[data-fancybox]').fancybox({
  EmulateDesktopView = true
});
```

What do you think? Will this feature ever see the light?

Thanks.
