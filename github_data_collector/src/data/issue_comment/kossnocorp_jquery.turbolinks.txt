when i click the back button in browser, turbolinks loads twice. how to solve this problem
I'm using share buttons (javascript plugins). When I open a page it shows that buttons, but when I open other page it disappear. It appear again when i refresh website. It working properly with jquery.turbolinks and without turbolinks gem, but without it website is very slow. How to make website faster? My [website](http://www.philsart23.uk/), now plugins is working, because I removed turbolinks.

**application.js**

```
//= require jquery
//= require jquery.turbolinks
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require lightbox
//= require_tree .
//= require turbolinks
```

**application.html.erb** javascript plugins
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-588e44a9401a6d9f"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" id="st_insights_js" src="http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js?publisher=630cdfb3-b6c5-4da7-a389-1c7d5340827d"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">stLight.options({publisher: "630cdfb3-b6c5-4da7-a389-1c7d5340827d", doNotHash: false, doNotCopy: false, hashAddressBar: false});</script>
```

**Gemfile**

```
gem 'jquery-turbolinks'
gem 'turbolinks', '~> 5.0.1'
```

I tried to add one plugin in javascript file, but result same

```
$(document).on('turbolinks:load', function(){
  stLight.options({publisher: "630cdfb3-b6c5-4da7-a389-1c7d5340827d",      doNotHash: false, doNotCopy: false, hashAddressBar: false});
});
```

Thank you for any help.
Hello there, I found that by default webpack doesn't find jquery.turbolinks module but if you add this:

`"main": "vendor/assets/javascripts/jquery.turbolinks.js",`

after

`"license": "MIT",`

at package.json file, it will work perfectly!

As noted in many issues (#61 #62), Turbolinks 5 isn't supported.

Hi!
I found this gem and thought it would be nice to use in my project.
But unfortunately it does not work for me.

Here is my `application.js`

```
//= require jquery
//= require jquery.turbolinks
//= require jquery_ujs

//= require ...
//= require ...

//= require turbolinks
```

I have 

```
rails (4.2.6)
jquery-rails (4.1.1)
jquery-turbolinks (2.1.0)
turbolinks (5.0.0)
```

Am I doing something wrong?
Thank you.


Hi, I'm going to host this project on [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/).
Would you add a dist folder for release files If it's possible?
https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/pull/7604


created new rails project using ruby version 2.2.2

in Gemfile
...
gem 'rails', '4.2.4'
...
gem 'jquery-turbolinks'

$ bundle install
....
Using turbolinks 2.5.3
Using jquery-turbolinks 2.1.0

in application.js
//= require jquery
//= require jquery.turbolinks
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .

when running app / loading page
couldn't find file 'turbolinks' with type 'application/javascript'
//= require turbolinks << pointing to this line

It looks like the latest version of Turbolinks [doesn't use the same event names as before](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks#running-javascript-when-a-page-loads), causing this gem to not work with Rails 5.
