Hi, Limin
What is the threshold used in Shot-based samplingï¼Ÿ
Thank you very much!
Dear limin

Thanks for your great job. I have a questions about the test_score.mat when running the thumos_detection.m.

What 's exact shape of flow(rgb)_test_score and flow(rgb)_test_attention? 

Dear Limin,

During training the optical flow network, I got an error that training was quited at prefecting data in the layer of SequenceDatalayer.
The log is as follow:
*** Aborted at 1540548898 (unix time) try "date -d @1540548898" if you are using GNU date ***
PC: @     0x7f46cdec8f3d caffe::SequenceDataLayer<>::InternalThreadEntry()

the solver's setting is as below:
net: "../models/four_class/temporal_102_class_hard_bn_inception_train_val.prototxt"

# testing parameter
test_iter: 2710
test_interval: 500
test_initialization: true

weight_decay: 0.0005

# GPU setting

I finetuned the network with weight: anet1.2_temporal_untrimmednet_hard_bn_inception.caffemodel, and batch_size = 5.

Could help indicate what's wrong in my settings?
Thanks very much!
