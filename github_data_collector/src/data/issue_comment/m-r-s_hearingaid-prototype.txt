Hi,

I've been trying to get this project up and running for two days.
Unfortunately I can't get the jackd started.
There is always the error message: JackAudioDriver::ProcessAsync: read error, stopping...

I tried both, the complete image and an installation via stretch lite.
In both cases the same result.
The sound card itself is fine and also the microphone amplifiers work.

Anyone else have an idea?

Thank you
Henri 
Hello, 

im really new to openMHA, but currently working for preperation of my bachelor-thesis on a jack-based audio processing client. which is intended to developed a simulator of hearing aid device. and then my prof recommended me to learn this software, and hoping that i can create my own plugins (dunno what it means, but maybe apply my own algorithm in openMHA client).

i can already run my own algorithm in this hearing aid prototype, but how do i create plugins and runs it ? 

thanks for the answer in advance

The problem with corrupted recording is probably a thread-safety
issue. In  unixoid systems 'mv' is generally atomic while 'cp'
is not.
Hello,

With newer hearing aids such as Oticon Opn supporting bluetooth connectivity, can this be used to develop a remote mic or interconnected table mic's for meetings similar to Phonak's Roger Mics or Oticon ConnectClip? This mic would stream audio to the bluetooth hearing aids.

This would greatly help with understanding speech in noise, in meetings, and understanding speech from distance lecturers.

Thanks!
The inversion filters figured in _Inversionfilters_ are set in the config.
Hi again! I'm trying to compile openMHA and install it. but I get a missing header file error for not being able to find sndfile.h

I simply used the git clone command, cd openMHA, then wrote the ./configure && sudo make
I also tried ./configure && make 
am I supposed to get the file(s) elsewhere?
it is most likely that I'm doing something wrong. If so, please tell me.
Is it possible to install OpenMHA on pi without setting up the bluetooth controller? It appears to be method for directly adjusting some parameters, but for the configuration, we plan to make any sort of adjustments through wifi connection only. I would like to know if it will run without the bluetooth script. Thank you :) 
I'm newbie in hearing aid development and aundio I/F.

I bought audio injector, and set up with Raspberry Pi .


I'd like to know the recommended microphone and amplifier (mobile ready).

Also, audio Injector has ECM type mic, is there any problem with this mic?
