Core

**Description what you'd like to happen:**

Hello,

It would be very handful to have the possibility to access the dialog's title view (and other views too).

**Context:**

As reported on another [issue](https://github.com/enricocid/Reveal-fragment-example), I recently experienced visible vertical scrollbar on dialog's title and toolbar's subtitle when using AndroidX Preference library in my project.

For the toolbar the fix involves setting the proper subtitle's styling while on the dialogs it was necessary to disable the `PreferenceFragmentCompat`'s vertical scrollbar as it is not possible to access the title's view.
Then, to disable scrollbars on material dialogs setting up a preference theme is needed:

```xml
<item name="preferenceTheme">@style/PrefTheme</item>

<style name="PrefTheme" parent="PreferenceThemeOverlay">
        <item name="android:scrollbars">none</item>
 </style>
```
This will cause the scrollbar of `PreferenceFragmentCompat` not working.

As for the toolbar, I'd like to be able to disable scrollbars also on dialogs titles without having to disable `PreferenceFragmentCompat`'s vertical scrollbar.

I'm already aware that it is possible to access the title's view from the dialog view, but I find this method tricky (is this a reliable method?).

**Describe alternatives you've considered:**

An alternative solution could be to let developers define custom titles textAppearance

Hello.
Thank for your useful library :)
I have a materialDialog that I fill its data with listItems() function. It maybe have lots of data(up to 8 or 9 options). So, if I change my screen orientation to landscape, I should scroll my dialog in order to find proper option to click.
 Some of our app users just told us that in that situation, there is no sign whether we have other options to click or not.

So, for that, I started to add a scrollbar to this dialog. I find id of recyclerView that contains my options and use some of its function like set Boolean  enableVerticalScrollbar(sth like this) to true, but it strangely doesn't have any effect on that dialog.
 
Maybe, I could use method of materialDialog but I think this is not an appropriate way because I just want to show a list of options. So, please add scrollBar to this dialog when we have lots of options(for example, more than 8 options in portrait, 5 in landscape) to improve user experience.

**Describe the Bug:**

Dialog which BottomSheet behavior is able to cancel by swipe down the content view, even I set `cancelable` into `false`, below is example code:

```kotlin
MaterialDialog(mActivity, BottomSheet(LayoutMode.WRAP_CONTENT)).show {
    // ...
    this.cancelable(false)
    this.cancelOnTouchOutside(false)
    this.noAutoDismiss()
}
```

**To Reproduce:**
1. Show the dialog.
2. Swipe down the content view.

**Expected Behavior:**

BottomSheet dialog must disable the swipe down action when `cancellable` set to `false`.

**What module does this apply to?**

Bottom sheets

**Description what you'd like to happen:**

Expose the title `TextView` of the `GridIconDialogAdapter` in `GridItem` so we can change the attributes of the text via the `gridItems()` handler 

**Describe alternatives you've considered:**

Currently, I have a custom implementation like the grid such that the image is replaced by a loading bar every time the user taps on an item (think of the chat color-changing dialog on Facebook Messenger). I also want to indicate the current grid item that is already "selected", and to do that I want to bold the text of a particular title, but since `GridItem.title` is a string, I can't set it. The only alternative would be to append a "selected" string to the current text or to create a custom view.

Current implementation:

```kotlin
data class ColorGridItem(
    @DrawableRes val iconRes: Int,
    override val title: String,
    val context: Context
) : GridItem {
    private lateinit var iconImageView: ImageView
    private lateinit var titleTextView: TextView // Does not exist and cannot be set
    override fun populateIcon(imageView: ImageView) {
        imageView.setImageResource(iconRes)
        iconImageView = imageView
    }
    fun startLoading() {
        val circularProgressDrawable = CircularProgressDrawable(context).apply {
            strokeWidth = 5f
            centerRadius = 30f
            start()
        }
        iconImageView.setImageDrawable(circularProgressDrawable)
    }
}
```

DateTime

**Description what you'd like to happen:**

Add a maxDateTime argument to the dialog. The argument allows to restrict the maximum date/time to be set by the user.

Hi,

I was working on a change to make the icon appear above the dialog title like in the screenshot below.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ema987/material-dialogs/feature/iconPosition/art/icon_above_title.png" width="250px" />

I'm opening this pull request to submit this feature to your attention. If you think that's a good fit for the project you just need to change the url of the screenshot once merged, otherwise the doc won't show it.

Thank you for your attention.

**Describe the Bug:**

When setting a min and max date, if you select a year outside of the defined min and max dates, a NPE is thrown as soon as the user clicks the OK button:

```

**To Reproduce:**
1. Initiate the datePicker Dialog with a defined minDate and maxDate argument
2. In the opened dialog select a year before the minDate or after the maxDate
3. Press the OK button of the dialog

**Expected Behavior:**

A clear description of what you expected to happen: 
no NPE should be thrown. Either the OK button could be disabled in case no valid date has been selected by the user, or the dialog should just close without calling the dateCallback method.
