Hello, all. I have a problem with whatsapp stickers, when I want to send a favorite sticker it skips "Cannot share this file". What can I do? Thank you all!

 - Delete redundant selfs

 - Move delegate methods to extension

 - Fix early-exit guards

 - Delete redundant semicolons

 - Update for loops with forEach blocks
Updated to the latest version of Android Gradle Plugin
I'm reporting a new issue here because I think this is a new problem.

```Third-party pack cannot be found likely because the corresponding app is restricted```

I've managed to consistently replicate the issue.  I will add the first sticker pack to WhatsApp successfully, however, when adding the second pack it fails with the above error, however, when I kill the app and re-open it and try to add the second pack again it passes.  If I then try to add a third sticker pack it fails again with the same error.  Kill the app, works and so forth.  Is this a problem with WhatsApp trying to restrict the number of sticker packs being added in a certain time frame or is this something else?

My issue has nothing to do with the power-saving mode.  I've tried these steps too. https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers/issues/468

Please see my implementation for WhatsApp Stickers: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_whatsapp_stickers

It's driving me crazy and I cannot figure out what the problem is.
WhatsApp gives validation_error in onActivityResult like this:
Permission Denial: reading xxx.StickerContentProvider uri content://xxx.stickercontentprovider/metadata/878205ea-120f-40f1-83fb-4eb367e031f9 from pid=17438, uid=10335 requires com.whatsapp.sticker.READ, or grantUriPermission()

I send logs for this and I noticed this occurs tens of thousand times a day.

Do you have any solutions for this?
Thanks.

i don't know Java very well and englishüòÅ
I've published a WhatsApp sticker app with several sticker packs. However, only the latest sticker pack gives the error of "**There's a problem with this sticker pack and it can't be added to WhatsApp**" for some users. Other users are able to download the same sticker pack with no problem.

So far, the error showed on Samsung 7.

Have tried updating and also deleting+reinstalling the sticker app but the error still exists.

Appreciate any help please! Thank you!

Here's the sticker app:

- [X] My tray icon does comply with the requirements (96x96 and < 50 KB)

- [ ] I am using **PNG** images for stickers.
