Hello :)

Dark mode is not supported. So we don't see the toast. Just the text.

What would be the solution?

Thanks you
Hi

Is there a simple way to check of a Toast is visible (added) in a view?

e.g. `ToastManager.shared.isToastAdded(view: self.view)`


This is something we required within our project as we have a Camera Preview view with a locked orientation where we manually rotate view elements to match the current device orientation. It's only really useful when `position` is `.center`, as rotating with `.top` & `.bottom` will probably make the toast view protrude the screen edge.

If you want i can look into adjusting the position for `.top` & `.bottom` when `rotationAngle` is used so this doesn't occur.
Hello, 
I am developing an app in which I have you used this repo and I want that if the toast is present on view it should close and the new one should appear.
what can I do for this?

How can we show a message with toast activity in Toast-Swift?
I have integrated Toast-Swift using cocoapods, and it works file when I have initially integrated it.

But now I have integrated one payment gateway SDK name MidTrans(http://mobile-docs.midtrans.com/?c#ios-sdk), Their SDK internally using Toast-Swift, So now because your SDK has used "extension UIView", I am getting "Ambiguous use of 'hideToastActivity()'" error whenever I have written `self.view.hideToastActivity()`.

So will you please help me out to solve this issue.
