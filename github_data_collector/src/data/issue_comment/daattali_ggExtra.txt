Hi,

I would like to add y-axis labels for the marginal plots. Is there a way to do it using ggMarginal command?

Thanks,
Lavanya
```r
library(ggExtra)
data(airquality)
airquality$Date <- with(airquality, as.Date(sprintf('1973-%02d-%02d', Month, Day)))

p <- ggplot(airquality, aes(Date, Temp)) + geom_point()
print(ggMarginal(data = airquality, x = 'Date', y = 'Temp'))  # works
print(ggMarginal(p, airquality, 'Date'))                      # doesn’t
```

the second one throws:

```r
Error: Invalid input: date_trans works with objects of class Date only
Traceback:

There was a [blog post](http://motioninsocial.com/tufte/) showing how to do many Tufte-style plots in R. The author included `ggMarginal` but noted that it cannot be used to make dotplots eg

I suppose it could be a nice extra feature to support those kind of plots as well, even though they're very very similar to histograms. I looked into it very briefly and unfortunately the `ggplot2::geom_dotplot()` doesn't seem to work because when there are many observations the dots go off the screen. There might be a way to somehow dynamically decide how big to make the dots. There can also be other solutions (perhaps useful resource: http://lenkiefer.com/2016/04/06/dot-plots-and-distributions)

If anybody wants to tackle this, feel free to make a PR!

Now it only supports one panel, it will be useful to support multi-panel plots faceted by either `facet_wrap` or `facet_grid`

It will be nice to able to show geom_hex along with two densities on top and right since there are circumstances where scatterplot is too slow due to the huge number of events.
