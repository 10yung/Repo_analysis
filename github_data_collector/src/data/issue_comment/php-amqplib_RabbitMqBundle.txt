Hi.
I have 2 applications, which communicate with each other through RMQ.
And I'd like to get a reply from consumer.
How can I do this?
In your example you use RPC. But If I'm not mistaken in your example both - producer and consumer must be in 1 application.
I would like to check what is in a queue before adding stuff in it (avoid duplication), is there a way to do this ? 

Make package compatible with symfony 5
`\OldSound\RabbitMqBundle\RabbitMq\BatchConsumer::batchConsume` does not emit any event after a consume. Compared to `\OldSound\RabbitMqBundle\RabbitMq\Consumer::processMessageQueueCallback` which emits a `\OldSound\RabbitMqBundle\Event\AfterProcessingMessageEvent`.

Id say this is inconsistent...
Hello. I want to disable rabbit errors while Phpuinit testing, but in always try to connect to rabbit. How can i pass tests without rabbit? Thank you
Due to the fact that symfony 4.3 EventDispatcherInterface and Event  have been moved to a new namespace i've done this pull request only to tread the EventDispatcher deprecated messages. As an inspiration for this i've thrown a look at how https://github.com/8p/EightPointsGuzzleBundle/pull/265/files was done. 
Hello, 

I see that the last update is 7 months ago and there are 139 issues and 43 PR open. Is this project maintained anymore?
Removes deprecation warnings regarding Symfony 4.3:

- The "OldSound\RabbitMqBundle\Event\AMQPEvent" class extends "Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\Event" that is deprecated since Symfony 4.3, use "Symfony\Contracts\EventDispatcher\Event" instead.
-  Calling the "Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface::dispatch()" method with the event name as first argument is deprecated since Symfony 4.3, pass it second and provide the event object first instead.
- Adapt changes to test suite.

Hi, I saw similar requests in #147 and #201 and I wanted this feature to collect more metrics in my application.

Would you consider merging a PR like this?

Of course, we can work more on the details like event names, places etc., I'd just like to know an early answer if it's a no-go.
