The instructions say that you can open the file with a right click to open with powershell. However, this doesnt grant admin rights and things dont work properly. Is it possible to right click and open with powershell with admin rights? 
this fix remove the confirmation as tested on windows 10 1909 Pro x64
Hi
Some applications are still present after passing the GUI debloater. Skype, all Microsoft Office applications, Onenote app, linkedin, Microsoft Solitaire Collection, Windows Feedback Hub, weather...
I'm on Windows 10 v1909
thx
Added batch scripts for launch as administrator
why does the customize blacklist not work? I unchecked some items but they got queued up for being deleted, that why I stopped the script



i really appreciate the work that went into this script to help all of us push back against MS bloatware.

i am not a script person, so the GUI version was great.

this was on a brand new Win 10 Pro 1903 Dell laptop, and my account has full admin privileges.  i ran it with right-click Run in Powershell, since i was not very comfortable running via command line (i tried it, but i couldnâ€™t seem to get the path right...)

however, in my case, it failed to remove some scheduled tasks (as well as some of the tiles, but that was a minor inconvenience).  

i may try it again before installing all my other software, unless this is something that is a known bug and not specific to me.
Ran "Unpin Tiles From Start Menu" from GUI version,
On powershell window it says
`Unpinning all tiles from the start menu`
and `_` flashing non stop.

Waited for an hour nothing happens
Line 177 of Windows10SysPrepDebloater.ps1 will cause line 178 to always evaluate to false 
`$CloudStore = 'HKCUSoftware\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudStore'`
should be 
`$CloudStore = 'HKCU:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudStore'`

Line 180  of Windows10SysPrepDebloater.ps1 will prompt for user input if there are child nodes
`Remove-Item $CloudStore`
May need to  be changed to 
`Remove-Item $CloudStore -Recurse`

Code as it is now
`Write-Output "Removing CloudStore from registry if it exists"
     $CloudStore = 'HKCUSoftware\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudStore'

     If (Test-Path $CloudStore) {

     Stop-Process Explorer.exe -Force

     Remove-Item $CloudStore

     Start-Process Explorer.exe -Wait

    }

`

should be
`Write-Output "Removing CloudStore from registry if it exists"
     $CloudStore = 'HKCU:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudStore'

     If (Test-Path $CloudStore) {

     Stop-Process Explorer.exe -Force

     Remove-Item $CloudStore -Recurse

     Start-Process Explorer.exe -Wait

    }

The instructions mention it's best to run debloat before users are setup... but that seems like a chicken and an egg problem.  Would appreciate some detail here.  I'm building a new install from scratch.
How would I unblacklist the Xbox app cuz I know the debloater blocked it
