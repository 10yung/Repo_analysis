Don't understand why many articles these days think its cool or tendy to leave out vital information such as the date the article is written or published... kind of essential for the reader to know how up-to-date the information there is.
Not a real issue, but you can avoid this line:

`var imageView: CaptionableImageView!`

because you can instantiate the view on the fly, even multiple times (eg. in a loop), by declaring it locally. There's no need to make it a class member.

The ["Using UIWebView Guide"](https://guides.codepath.com/ios/Using-UIWebView) was overwritten by @realq86 in commit [389f126](https://github.com/codepath/ios_guides/wiki/Using-UIWebView/93759f99593f47bca7f7e703262bfc5e0b28a6d0). They erased all of the information and replaced it with the word "TEST".

This file should be reverted back to commit [44e2fd0](https://github.com/codepath/ios_guides/wiki/Using-UIWebView/44e2fd0bbd5ae5f43555b3290b644de5c330a6f5)

Please update your this tutorial https://github.com/codepath/ios_guides/wiki/Multithreading-in-iOS for swift 4.1 where it give the error "dispatch_group_t' has been explicitly marked unavailable here (Dispatch.dispatch_group_t)". Change tutorial with DispatchQueue instead.
iOS10 now requires permissions to camera, contacts, calendar, microphone and will crash if missing the necessary ones:
