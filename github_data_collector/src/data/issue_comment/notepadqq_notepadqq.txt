**Describe the bug**
I'm trying to track down a crash on Fedora 31 using Cinnamon desktop. In particular, I'm trying to use some additional compiler flags to identify the cause of the crash. The problem is, my `CXXFLAGS` are ignored. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. `./configure --debug`
2. `CXXFLAGS="-g3 -O1 -fsanitize=address" make -j 5`

**Expected behavior**
The makefiles should honor my `CXXFLAGS`. The user always owns the well known variables, like `CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`. Also see [7.2 Makefile Conventions](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Makefile-Conventions.html) and [7.2.3 Variables for Specifying Commands](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Command-Variables.html) in the GNU Coding Standards.

Here is what the default recipe should look like, give or take, in a Makefile. Notepadqq owns its flags, and the user owns their flags. Users don't mess with Notepadqq's flags, and Notepadqq should not mess with the user's flags. The user's flags always trumps the project's flags (for situations like these).

```makefile
%.o : %.cpp
	$(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) $(NOTEPADQQ_CXXFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $<
```

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Fedora 31, x86_64
 - Installation type: Notepadqq GitHub
 - Qt version: 5.12.5
 - Notepadqq version: Master

**Additional context**
None

Here's what it looks like. Notice all of my flags have been ignored.

```sh
$ ./configure --debug

**Current behavior**
The application crashes on MacOS Catalina after opening and running for cca. 10 seconds.

**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**

- Build the app from cloning the current repository (21.12.2019) on MacOS Catalina 10.15.2
- Then run the notepadqq, it will run and continue running not more that 30 seconds tops, after that it will crash, MacOS will offer to reopen the program after that it will reopen Notapadqq and it will crash again after a short while. 

**Please tell us about your environment:**

- MacOS Catalina 10.15.2
- Qt 5.13

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I have a laptop with a high density display, running linux mint 19.2 & cinnamon 64 bit. I can change the text font size to display fine, but the icons, toolbars, menus, window titles and so forth aren't adjusted or scaled to HD display size and are too small.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
In preferences, allow a large icon / menu font / window title options for HD displays.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Some other apps auto-adjust, but I'm not clear if that is app logic or if they are based on system settings. I couldn't find an internet workaround or a system setting that positively affected the sizes.

**Additional context**
Notepadqq isn't the worst offender, so I expect it is picking up some defaults, but I would prefer to have more control and be able to select a larger interface font & icon size for all-day use.

Notepadqq version 1.4.8
I had some files in tabCache from a previous install.  Tried to merge into current install and opened Notepadqq.  Without warning, Notepadqq simply decided to delete the entire contents of tabCache.  Like fine, there was probably something more needed beyond copying the files over, but why is deleting everything the response Notepadqq went with?
While notepadqq otherwise does a great job as being my troubleshooter there's this...
e.g
`<body>`
`  <input type="radio" checked>`
`</body>`

`</body>` and the checked`>` will be colored red even tho this is perfectly valid
doesn't recognize ejs either but that's more of a feature request
Update snap instructions
Remove deprecated ppa information, including debian
Remove deprecated stable AUR

I recently noticed that the "Retry as Root" button doesn't work for me anymore. 

**To Reproduce**
1. Open write protected text file with Notepadqq.
2. edit it and clicksave.
3. "Error trying to write to [...]" appears, click on "Retry as Root".
4. Window closes, nothing happens.
5. If you reload document from disk you see that nothing has changed.

**Expected behavior**
After you click "Retry as Root" you get asked for the root password and the changes you made get saved to the document.

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: RebornOS (Arch Linux)
 - community repository
 - Qt version 5.13.2
 - Notepadqq version 1.4.8

**Additional context**
gksu is installed. If it is not installed the option "Retry as Root" isn't shown.
**Describe the bug**
There is no documentation of the temp files where they get auto-saved and recovered.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Checked /tmp/
2. Checked /var/tmp/
3. Checked online etc.
4. Not in the FAQ or the documentation

**Expected behavior**
Information of the temp directory to be present somewhere

**Screenshots**
None

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Latest Manjaro Linux stable
 - Installation type: PACAUR
 - Qt version [find it from the menu "? -> About Qt..."]
 - Notepadqq version: Latest

**Additional context**
None
