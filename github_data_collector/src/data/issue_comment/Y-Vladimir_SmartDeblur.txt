Adding Linux Build Instructions to Readme.md
Hi,
I'm unable to build SmartDeblur on my Gentoo system which has only Qt5 (no Qt4 anymore).
I get
CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake/Modules/FindQt4.cmake:1323 (message):
  Found unsuitable Qt version "5.12.0" from /usr/bin/qmake, this code
  requires Qt 4.x

Many thanks for a hint,
Helmut

What's the best you can make out of this heavily blurred picture ?
https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ad67fdaa76a11bd36e8195ce5d863789?width=1920

It's supposed to be a scan of 16mm film from a bolex camera with 240mm lenses (incorrectly mounted some say) exposed to a very bright object at a distance. Quite a challenge :)

Hope it's not offtopic.
How do I set up the size of blur track?
Did you send a paper on this technology? I want to quote.

Hello,

I really like your program and found it useful for small photos. However, I guess you realise that modern cameras produce photos much larger than 3000 px on the long side. I tried opening a 24 MP photo from my Pentax K3-II but the program crashes. I am running it on a computer with 16 GB of RAM, so I do not see how a photo cannot fit into it (I assume that the crash is caused by a segmentation fault). 

Also, I agree that processing large photos takes a long computational time but I think it will be worth it if we can make a crop of the photo, adjust the settings to make them pleasing to the eye and then plug in the full-size photo and let the program run in the background. It does not really matter if it takes half an hour if the result is good. 

In any case, very nice work, I appreciate it.
Algorithm could get some more data after blind deconvolution by user input. I.e. if one has a blurred image of a screenshot and deblurs it (with a lot of additional moire), now he has a chance to tell that some area has the same color, or that some area doesn't have a strong gradient in it. The idea is quite straightforward, so there should be an article on it somewhere.

(If you're not interested in searching for possibly non-existing article or implementing such algorithm, please, leave this feature request opened in case someone likes to try it and make a pull request.)

My DPI level 125%, and the text is cut off and does not lay out right. Example:

Hey Vladimir Yuzhikov!

First off all: Your tool is really amazing! From a photographers point of view it is already stunning what this tool can do to bad images.

However when it comes to removing motion blur, the real motion blur is many times very complex. Imagine shaking the camera to the left and afterwards up. To remove this blur, a kernel looking like a "L" would be required. Thus the user is not able to represent the kernel only using the sliders. 

To solve this problem, I suggest creating an option to load a premade kernel. This kernel can be obtained by the user by using a image editing program (e.g. by extracting a bright spot on a dark background).

I'd be great if you could think about adding this new feature, because it would make your software so much more powerfull.

Hi Vladimir,

Hope you doing good. 
Here is my feedback  upon using SmartDeblur V1.27.

I downloaded the zip file  - "SmartDeblur-1.27-win.zip — SmartDeblur - last windows version
7.0MB · Uploaded a month ago", from the site , https://github.com/Y-Vladimir/SmartDeblur/downloads.

The package is downloading and installing fine. After this I am extracting the files in the same directory. And running the SmartDeblur.exe. This resulting in SmartDeblur v.1.27 launching.

However, problem starting after this. The moment, I am uploading a .jpeg image file taken by a Canon 1000D camera, the image is loading in SmartDeblur and within seconds the SmartDeblur v.1.27 application is crashing

I removed the entire application, restarted my laptop, redownload the application all over again and
followed the same procedure. Still the same problem remains. Can you please help.

Please note : My laptop has Windows XP Professional Vrsion 2002 SP3 operating system, Intel Celeron 1.6GHz procesor and 1.24GB of RAM.

Thank you,
