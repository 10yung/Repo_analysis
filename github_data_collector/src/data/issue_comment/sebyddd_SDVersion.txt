This pull request adds support for the new three devices from iOS, iPhone XS, iPhone XR and iPhone XS Max.

This request also adds better device type differentiation by using the screen pixel values instead of the points value. This can matter when dealing with resolution issues. For instance, the iPhone XR and iPhone XS Max have the same point size, but the resolution is doubled in the Max (@2x vs @3x)

Device names are best as known now, until the new devices are release we don't know all the possible ones that will make themselves known, but I will update the pull request, or create a new one, when that happens.

I have also fixed a few compiler errors dealing with deprecated functions in the test iOS project.

When will this support the new 2018 devices? Thanks.
