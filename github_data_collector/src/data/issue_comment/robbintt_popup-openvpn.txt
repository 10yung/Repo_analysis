right now it gets made client side and if you lose it you have to rebuild it manually or by rerunning the ansible playbook, it's also more annoying to shuffle around to different devices.
easy-rsa packaged in ubuntu is version 2. Upstream has rewritten this utility as version 3. The API differs and is not backwards compatible. New VPNs should have this utility upgraded.
e.g. `virtualenv ansible-venv; . ansible-venv/bin/activate; pip install ansible`
It appears the openvpn service isn't started and stopped via systemd. Make this the default and add process supervision to ensure it's always running.
There [is a utility](https://github.com/iphoting/ovpnmcgen.rb) which converts an existing openvpn .conf file into an Apple certified .mobileconfig for iOS devices. Adapt this code so the ovpn_files dir has two config files for each user specified.

The service should do this no problem, but many clients that will require root may not be able to provide it: iOS, macos, ??
