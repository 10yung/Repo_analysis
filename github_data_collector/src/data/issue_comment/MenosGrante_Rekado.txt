The app simply won't react to my Switch being connected. The Moto G7 Plus is supposed to support OTG. I'm using the included type C to type C cable. I'm running Android 9. Not sure what to do.
Hi! I got the message:

"Sending payload failed at offset 0"

Device: Nokia 5
Android: 8.1.0
I try several times and it always presents the same error:

"Submiturb error."

How can I solve it?
