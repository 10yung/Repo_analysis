I have developed and published `nginx` crate (bindings for Nginx 1.15.8):
https://github.com/arvancloud/nginx-rs
https://crates.io/crates/nginx
It seems rather strange from a Rust user's view that a library has the name "rust" in it. Maybe just call this crate `nginx` or something.
Macro to generate stubbing for
- directive
- context
- definition
This is blocker for release. This need to be done in order for other crates to use this.
