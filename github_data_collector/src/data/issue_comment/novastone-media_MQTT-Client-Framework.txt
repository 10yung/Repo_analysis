Want it to be consistent across my app, seems that it's using the iOS default, but I changed mine as part of the networking stack and I'd like it to apply to the MQTT requests as well. 
### Short description
In macOS, GCDTimer has delay, when i set keepalive to 5s, the callback method will be active after 3s ~ 24s, but it work in iOS

### Environment
 - Operating system:  macOS
 - Software version: 10.15.1
 - Package Manager: Cocoapods
 - MQTTClient version:  0.15.2

### Steps to reproduce
1. log current date when keep alive method be call
2. connect broker and set keepalive to 5s
3. wait 20 min and review logs

### Others
sorry, my english is not good

Before deleting the 'cert' code, the package info  of client for exchange  had two certificates which were same with each other. The screenshot is below:

After deleting that, everything was OK!

The SecIdentityRef contains a SecCertificateRef, so we do not add another SecCertificateRef again!

Please fix it and release a new pod version, thanks!
The comment says `MQTTConnectHandler` has a parameter `sessionPresent`

https://github.com/novastone-media/MQTT-Client-Framework/blob/7c5e329f5a916595d3064e2e0aea7b3597d4a4a8/MQTTClient/MQTTClient/MQTTSession.h#L498-L525

But the definition of `MQTTConnectHandler` doesn't have that parameter. Is the comment out-of-date?

It can connect to Server with SSL on iOS 13. The error message is "mqttTransport didFailWithError Error Domain=MQTT Code=-9807 "Unable to apply security policy, the SSL connection is insecure!"". And it can connect to server on device that the system is below iOS 13. Is there anyone encounter this issue?

### Short description
When `disconnect` is called on `MQTTSessionManager` in "starting" state (that is, before starting any connection), it gets stuck in "closing" state indefinitely. 
<!-- Explain in a few sentences what the issue/request is -->

### Environment
<!-- Tell us about the environment -->
 - Operating system:  iOS
 - Package Manager:  Carthage  <!-- delete the ones that do not apply -->
 - MQTTClient version: 0.15.2
 - MQTT Broker used: AWS IoT (it's rather not broker-specific)

### Steps to reproduce
<!-- Tell us step-by-step how the issue can be triggered. Please include connection details to your test broker -->
1. Initialize `MQTTSessionManager`
2. Call `disconnect(disconnectHandler:))` on it (without calling `connect` first - the manager is in "starting" state)

### Expected behaviour
Manager's state eventually changes to "closed", or it remains in "starting" state.

### Actual behaviour
Manager changes state to "closing" and never transitions to "closed". 
Then the next `connect` call will not work - the manager will remain in "closing" state (probably because of this check: https://github.com/novastone-media/MQTT-Client-Framework/blob/33e06af6ae0c5d93f51191fdd0c2d8453c5ddfa9/MQTTClient/MQTTClient/MQTTSessionManager.m#L335).

### Other information
I think calling `disconnect` in "starting" / "closed" state should be a no-op (do nothing).
Hello, when I set willMsg as nil in the latest version (0.15.2), I can't connect to the server, but it is clearly said in the parameter description of the method that it can be empty, please help me explain how to set this parameter on earth.
Here is the code that cannot be connected
```object-c
[self.manager connectTo:@"xxxhost" port:1883 tls:FALSE keepalive:60 clean:true auth:false user:nil pass:nil will:[@"offline" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] willTopic:@"test1" willMsg:nil willQos:MQTTQosLevelExactlyOnce willRetainFlag:FALSE withClientId:@"123" securityPolicy:nil certificates:nil protocolLevel:MQTTProtocolVersion311 connectHandler:^(NSError *error) {
            //
        }];
```
Here is the code to connect to
```object-c
[self.manager connectTo:self.mqttSettings[@"host"] port:[self.mqttSettings[@"port"] intValue] tls:[self.mqttSettings[@"tls"] boolValue] keepalive:60 clean:true auth:false user:nil pass:nil will:[@"offline" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] willTopic:@"test" willMsg:[@"joins chat" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] willQos:MQTTQosLevelAtMostOnce willRetainFlag:FALSE withClientId:nil securityPolicy:nil certificates:nil protocolLevel:MQTTProtocolVersion311 connectHandler:^(NSError *error) {
        }];
```
By the way, I think it's good to provide the latest version in the demo
This is my first time to ask a question here and I hope to get your reply
I use the asyn api connect ,When the network is not good, I get a mistake like this `nw_socket_handle_socket_event [C10:1] Socket SO_ERROR [60: Operation timed out]`, this is a  time out error, the time is  too long , I  want know where can i set time out ?
I put the files in the MQTTClient folder into my project, but "[session connectWithConnectHandler:^ (NSError * error {}]" method can not go into block callbacks.

thank you
