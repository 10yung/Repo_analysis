I was able to do a apt search and found lolcat on there, so I thought about adding this.

I have a slightly odd environment, so it might be that. It is Windows 10, Cygwin, Mintty, zsh (also tested with Bash).

This is the first time I've opened an issue on Github, Don't know if the screenshot will work....I don't know much about Ruby, so... forgive me if it's not helpful.

Hello, World!

I would like to see a bonfire colorized terminal output like the one with a rainbow.
What keywords should I use to google it? =)
For a file which `file` reports as ``: Little-endian UTF-16 Unicode text, with CRLF line terminators`` `lolcat` produces no output at all. Any setting I need to tweak?
lolcat is awesome and more people should know about it than just the people browsing gems. I work on the Snap Store, which gets [browsed](https://snapcraft.io/store) by millions of Linux users, so I put together a snap of lolcat to get more eyes on it.

To build it, `snap install snapcraft` from Ubuntu, or [install Multipass](https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/multipass/releases) on MacOS then `brew install snapcraft`. Then run `snapcraft` to create the .snap file.

To publish, [create an account](https://snapcraft.io/account), then:
```
snapcraft login
snapcraft register lolcat
snapcraft push --release=stable *.snap
```

From there, you can [add](https://snapcraft.io/lolcat/listing) screenshots and videos so they show up on https://snapcraft.io/lolcat.

Hope this helps :)
I pipe a few scripts through lolcat because rainbow output is awesome. However, I noticed that when a script includes an emoji in its output (such as :beer: from certain `homebrew` output lines), lolcat fails at the emoji and the remaining output is dropped.

For reference, I'm on OSX 10.13.4 and installed lolcat using `homebrew`.
