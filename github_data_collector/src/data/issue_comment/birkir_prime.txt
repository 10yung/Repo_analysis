Tried to deploy primecms using docker
my docker look something like this
```
FROM <package>/node:12.12 as builder

# Install system dependencies
RUN apk update && apk add git

ARG BUILD_DIR=/root/primecms
ARG INSTALL_DIR=/var/primecms

# Create app directory
RUN mkdir -p ${BUILD_DIR}
RUN mkdir -p ${INSTALL_DIR}
WORKDIR ${BUILD_DIR}

COPY . ${BUILD_DIR}

RUN yarn install --silent
RUN yarn setup
RUN yarn compile

RUN mkdir -p ${INSTALL_DIR}/node_modules/@primecms
WORKDIR ${INSTALL_DIR}/node_modules/@primecms
RUN for dir in "${BUILD_DIR}"/packages/*; do \
        NEW_NAME="$(basename "$dir" | cut -d- -f2-)"; \
        cp -rdf "${dir}" "./${NEW_NAME}"; \
    done

WORKDIR ${INSTALL_DIR}
COPY package.deploy.json ${INSTALL_DIR}/package.json
COPY yarn.lock ${INSTALL_DIR}/yarn.lock
RUN yarn install --production --silent
```
then i copy over the install dir
but somehow when i run it and try to login
i keep getting the `user.meta is not a function` error on the getUser

but everything work fine in my local development
any idea what could have caused this?
thank you

Hi

Is it possible to create a master-detail document meaning for the "master" data (comprising of few fields) there can exist "many" records in the "detail" data i.e. a document that supports 1-N?

If not, how can I achieve this? Any hints please.

With Regards
Raman
I had issues running master with a project that was built with the latest npm released version (`v0.3.4-beta.1`).
After a couple of tests I've decided to downgrade the `apollo-server-express` from 2.8.1 to 2.6.2 and everything started working again.

From my understanding the issue could be [here](https://github.com/birkir/prime/blob/master/packages/prime-core/src/server.ts#L48). I'm not sure but I don't think that this new version allows to set the schema after the instance has been created ([new schema initialization/creation](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/master/packages/apollo-server-core/src/ApolloServer.ts#L358-L369)).

Two options would be to:

1. Create a new server instance on schema changes (which in terms of performance could not be great).
2. Investigate `apollo-gateway` (not sure if it makes sense here tbh) because it seems that allows to [update](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/1275#issuecomment-526591251) the `schema`.
