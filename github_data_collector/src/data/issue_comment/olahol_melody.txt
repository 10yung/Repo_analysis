In your code:
func newHub() *hub {
	return &hub{
		sessions:   make(map[*Session]bool),
		broadcast:  make(chan *envelope),
		register:   make(chan *Session),
		unregister: make(chan *Session),
		exit:       make(chan *envelope),
		open:       true,
		rwmutex:    &sync.RWMutex{},
	}
}

But I thank " broadcast:  make(chan *envelope, 1024) " is better, or I misunderstand something.
Thanks for your project.
This pattern is repeated several times in melody_test.go:

```
conn, err := NewDialer(server.URL)
defer conn.Close()
if err != nil {
	t.Error(err)
	return false
}
```

However, if there is an error, this is liable to cause a null reference panic.
examples/filewatch/main.go imports `"github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify"`. However, this import path is deprecated and deleted. This makes the Go tool error out because the package contains no source code.

Update the import path to `"github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify"`.
@olahol , or anyone. Did you reach the end of the scope of this project?
Please connect

Add functions to get addrs from session when we need to save conn info in redis.

There seems to be no active maintenance of this repo, but quite a few active forks. Can we transfer ownership of this repo to someone that is currently working on keeping it current?

Thanks!
