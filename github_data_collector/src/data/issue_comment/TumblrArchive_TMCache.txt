Fixes following build warning.

    Block implicitly retains 'self'; explicitly mention 'self' to indicate this is intended behavior

TMCache is pinned at 1.2. Latest released version is 2.1. Should we update?
我相信你这个框架的优势不在于存储图片吧？如果是图片访问保存 可以用sdwebimage很方便的
Hi,

I am not able to save an object.

The log shows : TMDiskCache.m (287) ERROR: The operation couldn’t be completed. (Cocoa error 4.)

run this test case failed:

``` objective-c
- (void)testMemoryWarningBlock
```

Block may not be called when the user sends message to TMCache
instance, which will cause some problems.

If I'm not mistaken, when I set an ageLimit, TMCache trims cache by age and repeat the operation every "ageLimit" using dispatch_after.

If I set an ageLimit of 10 sec on t=0, insert an object on t=5, that object keeps in cache for 15 sec.

I think this is not the expected behavior.

Problem becomes worse when ageLimit becomes larger.

Hey,

I have a problem with the library.
Sometimes the completion block of objectForKey is never called.
It seems that the dispatch_async doesn't work in TMDiskCache.

I took the liberty to modernize the codebase a bit and bump the minimum deployment version to 7. It should still be iOS 6 compatible but I didn’t have means to test it. The commit history sums up what I did. If this fits your roadmap for TMCache, please feel free to merge.
