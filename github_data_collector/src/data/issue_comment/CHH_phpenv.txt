Hi, I installed phpenv, and  I try to get php 7.1.1.
but I met this error( below).

-----install log----
[xdebug]: Installing version 2.6.0,
[Downloading]: http://xdebug.org/files/xdebug-2.6.0.tgz,
curl: (7) Failed connect to xdebug.org:80; Connection timed out,
----

I access to 'http://xdebug.org/files/xdebug-2.6.0.tgz' by curl,  I receive Request Code 302.
Next, I try to add '-L' option, I can get this package.

My guess is that, When you get xdebug package by curl, do  you need "-L" option?
Pls check get package method.

Best regards,




This will replace RBENV_VERSION with PHPENV_VERSION so you can separately specify PHP and Ruby versions.

Note: this will break any plugins or supporting scripts that assume phpenv uses RBENV_VERSION ([phpenv-composer](https://github.com/ngyuki/phpenv-composer) being one)

This pull request fixes update functionality by first resetting the repository (using git checkout), pulling, and then reapplying the sed replacements.

Fixes #41

Running `UPDATE=yes phpenv-install.sh` fails on the `git pull` as you can't pull with uncommitted changed files.

If I run `phpenv versions`, it seems that versions are included in the output which were not successfully installed.

```
> phpenv versions
  system
* 5.3.29 (set by /mnt/jenkins-slave-workspace/tools/com.cloudbees.jenkins.plugins.customtools.CustomTool/phpenv/phpenv/version)
  5.4.45
  5.5.31
  5.5.35
  5.6.17
  5.6.21
  7.0.5
  7.0.6
> phpenv local 5.5.35
> php --version
rbenv: php: command not found

The `php' command exists in these Ruby versions:
  5.3.29
  5.4.45
  5.5.31
  5.6.17
  7.0.5
  7.0.6

> ls $phpenv_HOME/phpenv/versions/5.5.35
etc  libexec
```

When I run `phpenv help` the output text seems to refer to `rbenv` rather than `phpenv`. Furthermore, the `PHPENV_VERSION` environment variable seems to do nothing whereas `RBENV_VERSION` seems to work.

```
> phpenv
rbenv 1.0.0-16-gd6ab394
Usage: rbenv <command> [<args>]

Some useful rbenv commands are:
   commands    List all available rbenv commands
   local       Set or show the local application-specific Ruby version
   global      Set or show the global Ruby version
   shell       Set or show the shell-specific Ruby version
   rehash      Rehash rbenv shims (run this after installing executables)
   version     Show the current Ruby version and its origin
   versions    List all Ruby versions available to rbenv
   which       Display the full path to an executable
   whence      List all Ruby versions that contain the given executable

See `rbenv help <command>' for information on a specific command.
For full documentation, see: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#readme

> phpenv version
rbenv: version `5.3.29' is not installed (set by RBENV_VERSION environment variable)
 (set by RBENV_VERSION environment variable)
```

I would like to add a new option to specify a rbenv's revision to install.
Sometimes, I wanted to specify a rbenv's revision to install so that the installed phpenv in all servers are same even if the timing of constructing servers is different from initial constructed servers.

Cause here: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/blob/9e664b5d27cd7b2bdb94a9ec8ce55c32ebe1ad7a/libexec/rbenv-prefix#L25
