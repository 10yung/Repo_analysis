Thanks! :) 
Hello! Thanks for gathering this list to introduce developers and their projects. This also helps to increase communication inside the community. I appreciate the effort. However, I would like to see some kind of explanation about the selection criteria. Does having the popular GitHub repositories make these developers "Top App Developers"? I think a little explanation will be really helpful for everyone who is checking out the repository. 
Hey ðŸ‘‹ 

Could you create a new tag every month?

It would be awesome if one could subscribe to release-only notifications. Also, tags would be helpful when browsing through the history (currently the only way to view past releases is looking through a bunch of `Update README.md` commits)

Fix indentation.
Is this top app developers for only UI/UX, not data or lower level frameworks?
I would like to suggest an app agencies. Whiskerz AB from Sweden. They have developed the PlaygroundTDD repo and are also known for developing award winning apps. PlaygroundTDD trended several times on the GitHub explore page and was featured in many swift blog posts and newsletters.
