Hello! I'm just wondering, is this cool project still maintained?

Last commit dated 9. Sep 2015, there are 19 issues opened, and some users complaining that library doesn't work on newer Android version.

Do you have any plans to continue to support this cool library?

i have used the same code as provided in sample. it works perfectly fine when i run activity for the first time. but if i go back and reopen activity i got no results. and mConnectionClassManager.getCurrentBandwidthQuality() gives me the last result .

Hello, 

I'm having issues when trying to measure the connection on devices Google Pixel Android 9. The result is always **Current average bandwidth is -1.0 Kilobits/s** and **Quality Unknown**.
This is happening only on Google Pixel Android 9 Devices, do you have any advice for this scenario?

Thanks.
HI
I am using this library in one my background service. I have a separate handler thread which will queue up the messages. I am doing a network action in "handlemessage". I am calling startSampling() and calling stopSampling() after the network communication is completed.

My netwok coomunication is based on SSL socket. 
But my Listener is never invoked. I am doing ConnectionClassManager.getInstance().register in the onCreate of my Service.

Did this library cant monitor the network communication in TCP

How do i get all the parameter speed and time? how much the data speed (KB/s) and time (minutes.second) for some image. the app just says: EXCELLENT.  which is did not says something detail. i need the parameter data time and speed. thanks in advanced if you someone reply.
can i get jitter time from this library?
if yes then how can i get jitter time please let me know 
ConnectionClassManager.getDownloadKBitsPerSecond() returns ExponentialGeometricAverage.getAverage(). Each measurement used to determine the average is converted to bits per second by ConnectionClassManager.addBandwidth(). So is getDownloadKBitsPerSecond() misnamed?

ConnectionClassManager.addBandwidth() -
double bandwidth = (bytes) * 1.0 / (timeInMs) * BYTES_TO_BITS;
mDownloadBandwidth.addMeasurement(bandwidth);
DeviceBandwidthSampler.getInstance().startSampling();
// Calling API network operation and after success or error from volley response
DeviceBandwidthSampler.getInstance().stopSampling();
mUtils.showInternetQualityIfPoor(); // Now checking bandwidth and showing message 

even though when I was in Very god internet quality, it is always showing POOR connection, help me out how can I modify to get exact connection quality

Regards
Vinod
