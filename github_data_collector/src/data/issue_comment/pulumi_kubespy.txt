When i try to run `kubespy trace deploy paymentservice` i see message:
```sh
Server is unable to handle extensions/v1beta1, Kind=Deployment
```

Switch on event type and don't print a diff for a Delete event

i am trying to use "kubespay" (great tool btw :heart) - to watch multiple deployments.


having the following questions.


```
kubespy  trace deploy krn-dev/api
```


```
[ADDED extensions/v1beta1/Deployment]  krn-dev/api
    Rolling out Deployment revision 4
    ✅ Deployment is currently available
    ✅ Rollout successful: new ReplicaSet marked 'available'

ROLLOUT STATUS:
- [Current rollout | Revision 4] [ADDED]  krn-dev/api-7578c97964
    ✅ ReplicaSet is available [1 Pods available of a 1 minimum]
       - [Ready] api-7578c97964-8glps
```


i'd like to start multiple threads and run one kubespy per deployment.
kubespy should exit once deployment status is ✅


resulting in the thread to quit, once all threads are gone, i can be sure my deploymentS are done.


is there already a option for that scenario?
if not, can you guide me to the direction where to start, i would love to contribute.

I installed kubespy on y k8s master server. however when i run kubespy commands all i get is output watching status. nothing else.
#21 works for things like `Deployment` or `Pod` that only include one capital letter, but not for types like `StatefulSet` or `DaemonSet` with more than one capital letter.

Here's an example:
```
$ kubespy status apps/v1 statefulset foo
Server is unable to handle apps/v1, Kind=Statefulset
```
```
$ kubespy status apps/v1 StatefulSet foo
Watching status of apps/v1 StatefulSet foo
```

Hi!

running `kubespy trace deploy internal-tiller/tiller` shows me this output:

```
[ADDED extensions/v1beta1/Deployment]  internal-tiller/tiller
    Rolling out Deployment revision 3
    ✅ Deployment is currently available
    ✅ Rollout successful: new ReplicaSet marked 'available'

ROLLOUT STATUS:
- [Current rollout | Revision 3] [ADDED]  joe-helm-test/tiller-877613549
    ✅ ReplicaSet is available [0 Pods available of a 0 minimum]

- [Previous ReplicaSet | Revision 2] [ADDED]  testproject/tiller-7c58fdf799
    ⌛ Waiting for ReplicaSet to scale to 0 Pods (1 currently exist)
```

I wounder why there are reference to `testproject` or `joe-helm-test` while I just looking the `tiller ` inside `internal-tiller`.

Running v0.4.0 on a mac running against our kubernetes 1.10 cluster.
Looking at : https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/, it appears that we could use https://github.com/kubernetes/cli-runtime to implement kubespy as a plugin, and get a lot of the heavy lifting done for us.

Syntax could look something like:

```
kubectl spy po nginx --status
kubectl spy svc nginx --trace
```

^ I'm just spitballing here. @hausdorff  WDYT?
Unless there was a special reason behind, can it align options like:
-n / --namespace 
and/or
determine version automatically (v1) 
etc.
