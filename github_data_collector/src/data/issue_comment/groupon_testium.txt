BREAKING CHANGE: officially deprecate the lib

_This PR was started by: [git wf pr](https://github.com/groupon/git-workflow/releases/tag/v1.0.3)_
When using `clearAndType()`  I noticed that this function does not trigger any focus event(s), which occur with real input interaction.
Repro:
(Note: I am using Testium to sanity test the Groupon Getaways prod site, so I have launch=false in my .testiumrc file and I don't want to be launching anything.  I'm testing against groupon.com, so I don't need to launch anything.  I am using Testium 3.3.1 and Testium-core 1.4.5.)
1. Run the prod sanity tests.
Expected:
The tests run successfully.

Actual:
I get an error about 90% of the time that says:
"Failed to initialize WebDriver. Check phantomjs.log.
Checking port 4445:
listen EADDRINUSE

### Spec:

`browser.doubleClick(cssSelector);`

Performs a doubleClick on the element selected by the cssSelector.

I am redirecting a page(url1) to url2. After navigateTo, when I log the path, it gives the status (404) of url2 but path of url1. Is there a way I can show the url of url2?

phantomjs maintains localstorage between runs.

Maybe we should clear it before running tests?

```
page.evaluate(function(){
    localStorage.clear();
});
```

If that seems like a bad idea, we should at least document this behavior so developers know to handle it in their own tests.

Thanks to a recent update to `webdriver-http-sync` (https://github.com/groupon/webdriver-http-sync/pull/28) we should be able to just set the webdriver url and run on saucelabs. We'd need to verify that and maybe even document [how to setup w/ travis](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/sauce-connect/).

Create example repo(s) that show you how to use testium. This could be a promotion of [jkrems/testium2-demo](https://github.com/jkrems/testium2-demo) to this org. There could also be an example using something other than mocha.

Almost certain that it will be hard (impossible) in the current design, but it would be nice to get the actual wait times reported for successful waits.

Example from [nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org/):

That example also includes nice trace-like messages for all other assertions. Pretty helpful for test blocks with more than one line.
