Hello @GabrielAlva , Thanks for this library but I am facing the issue during capturing. when I launch the app I feel that camera is little bit zoomed. I have rechecked with iPhone's native camera also. Can you please help me to resolve this?
Could you please, update your library?

AVCaptureStillImageOutput is deprecated: Use AVCapturePhotoOutput instead
AVCaptureDevice.devices is deprecated: Use AVCaptureDeviceDiscoverySession instead

Just wanted to let you know.

I previously used another one which was far too buggy. This one is simple, clean and does what it needs to do.

Also for swift users looking for podspec.

its easy to manually import this. Just follow the guide and add this to briding-header
`#import "./CustomizableCamera/Camera View/CameraSessionView.h"`

Please add support for CocoaPods, this would very much easy the use of your code.
Thanks !

Not sure how hard it is to convert. Do you have outstanding plans to upgrade the code to Swift?

Hey, Wouldn't it be better if there was pinch to zoom and click image functionality implemented ?

I would like to add an overlay to the camera view..ideally a filter overlay - how can I accomplish this?

Hi Gabriel,

I am currently using your Cool-iOS-Camera library in my project. This is very useful to me. I need one help.

Please tell me how to turnoff the default flash coming while taking photo in this library!!!

Thank you.
