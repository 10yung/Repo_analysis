- Fix memory leakï¼šanimationGroup & Pulsator cycle retain
- add new property `animationCompletionBlock`
Hi, I'm trying to get a nice pulse below a round avatar view. The UIImageView itself is a rectangle spanning the entire screen, its image is a circle with aspect fit. When I add the pulsator view like this:

        let pulsator = Pulsator()
        pulsator.radius = 500
        pulsator.numPulse = 3
        pulsator.pulseInterval = 3
        pulsator.animationDuration = 5
        pulsator.backgroundColor = UIColor(red: 0, green: 0.623, blue: 0.890, alpha: 0.3).cgColor
        self.avatarImageView.addSublayer(pulsator)
        pulsator.start()

It works but the pulse comes from the top left of the UIImageView. I want it to spawn pulses from the center of the image, which is also the center of the UIImageView itself. How can I change the pulsator's position? Or how can I center it properly to the view?
Up until before I migrated my project to Swift 5, this worked fine:
`var pulse = Pulsator()
pulse.isReversed = true`

However now it doesn't. Does anyone have any idea why? Or what I should do about it?
Thank you for the nice library.

I want to pause animation to show search results count.

Kindly help us.

For the first time it works when the view controller is opened. See the below screenshot, There is a `NavigationController` embed in.

After I click a subpage, which is under the `NavigationController` and then swipe back to the current page. It doesn't work correctly. After I `performSegue` and swipe back to the current page. Here is another screenshot,

Could you take a look please?

Can you help?

```
let markerView = UIImageView(image: GMSMarker.markerImage(with: UIColor.red))
            marker.iconView = markerView
```

```
let pulsator = Pulsator()
                    pulsator.numPulse = 3
                    pulsator.radius = 240.0
                    pulsator.repeatCount = .infinity
                    marker.iconView?.layer.insertSublayer(pulsator, above: marker.iconView?.layer)
                    pulsator.position = (marker.iconView?.layer.position)!
                    pulsator.start()
```

Also setting `pulsator.position` makes it disappear completely?

```
       pulsator.position = self.view.center
        pulsator.numPulse = 5
        pulsator.radius = 70
        pulsator.repeatCount = .greatestFiniteMagnitude
        pulsator.animationDuration = 3
        pulsator.backgroundColor = UIColor(red: 0, green: 0.755, blue: 0.756, alpha: 1).cgColor
        button.layer.insertSublayer(pulsator, below: button.layer)
        pulsator.start()
```
I have try many way to add to marker googlemap but unsucessfully.
