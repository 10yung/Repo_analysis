**Description**
An initial automated install results in an SSL Cert Error when visiting the site for the first time. 

My test environment:

- macOS Desktop 10.14.6
- Chrome Version 79.0.3945.117 (Official Build) (64-bit) ( I got the same results on Safari)

**Steps To Reproduce**
1. Perform Automated Setup: 

`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markshust/docker-magento/master/lib/onelinesetup | bash -s -- magento2.test 2.3.3
`

2. Visit install url magento2.test 

**Expected Result**
- I expect to see the Magento 2 home page when first navigating to the install URL after initial setup. 

**Actual Result**

Whenever I do a fresh install I see this Error:

Except for this first error after setup everything else seems to be working fine. I usually just ignore it and bypass the error but I figured I should finally try to address the issue. Thanks for your help!

Hello dearest docker-magento community,

I've been trying to give running MFTF tests on the instance running inside docker a  shot, to no success thus far. I'm following the [MFTF Getting Started guide](https://devdocs.magento.com/mftf/docs/getting-started.html#run-tests) but I get stumped on a seemingly simple issue: having the test generation bail because it can't reach the magento storefront (over http or https) from inside the container. I get (after exposing some of the URL information a bit  in the error message myself):

```
âžœ ./bin/clinotty vendor/bin/mftf generate:tests


In ModuleResolver.php line 444:

  Could not retrieve API token from Magento Instance (Could not find Magento
  Backend Instance at MAGENTO_BACKEND_BASE_URL or MAGENTO_BASE_URL (http://ma
  gento2.test/rest/V1/integration/admin/token))
```

Turns out, I don't know if I can reach the magento storefront from inside the container, regardless of what domain or IP I try to use. 

This is probably because I don't understand how docker-compose works, but figured I'd ask here as someone possibly does know! I think it'd be cool if we could run MFTF tests from inside the container - I think it should be theoretically doable.
This PR will add autocompletion to n98-magerun2 command line tool.
It would be awesome to have out-of-the-box configuration and setup guide for integration and unit testing in PHPStorm.
This is a great tool.  Wondering if we can add ioncube loader to the container?  

Thanks. 




Currently the db configuration is stored in two locations, in the env file for docker / docker-compose and in bin/setup.sh. It would be nice to have the bash script load the environment settings from the env file as well.

For Bash you could use something similar to this - that works fine in our setup:
```
DIR="${BASH_SOURCE%/*}"
if [[ ! -d "$DIR" ]]; then DIR="$PWD"; fi
source "$DIR/../env/db.env"
```

For the Windows scripts I have no idea ;(
