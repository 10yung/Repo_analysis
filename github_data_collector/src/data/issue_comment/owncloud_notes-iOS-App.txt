I was wondering if it was possible to add URL/Launcher capability into the app so that if you type a phone number it would read it as such and allow you to dial that number from within the Notes app.
Sync works over all iOS devices. Would love to skip iOS Notes App and switch to CloudNotes. However it is not possible to add photos or pictures to a note. 

Will you implement this feature in the future? It is often much faster to make a photo and put in into notes instead of typing all of it.

thx

There sometimes is a strange vertical glitchy motion when you press enter / insert a line break. It does not happen when the words naturally extend beyond one line.

This seems to be because the viewport is scrolled smoothly, but the block of text below the cursor is moved without animation.

Currently the last modified date of the note is shown in the second line.

A different idea would be to show the second line of the note in that second line. That way you already get a glimpse of the note, and might not even need to open it.

The date could still be shown to the right, or maybe even better as list dividers (today, yesterday, last week, etc).
