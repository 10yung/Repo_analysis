Updated `and, or, nor` to instead call a new `recursive_matches?` method on the `default.rb` file. 

The `recursive_matches?` method checks if the document is a `Hash` and doesn't try to call `_matches?` on it.

Recursive support was cleaner to add with the addition of a proper `not.rb` for the `:$not` operator

---------

The original issue (that this PR fixes) was that nested conditionals (like `:$or`) inside of a `:$elemMatch` would raise ```NoMethodError: undefined method `_matches?' for {"a"=>1, "b"=>1}:Hash``` since a Hash value would get evaluated internally inside the `:$elemMatch` execution.
