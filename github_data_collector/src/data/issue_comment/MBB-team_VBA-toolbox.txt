The two functions added allow the conversion between a gamma distributed precision and the distribution over the associated standard deviation in both directions for the more intuitive interpretation/definition of posterior/prior distributions of the noise parameters.
The attached document provides the mathematical details.

Analytical computation of the Dirichlet EP thanks to Joram Soch.
MFX cannot be used to invert multisession data. As the multisession option is duplicating the priors, the posterior and prior do not have the same dimensions. This crashes MFX as it derives iteratively the prior from the posterior.
A potential solution would be to allow to specify priors for multisession data using the extended scheme (priors on all parameters, including session-wise duplicates). 
For multiple reasons:
- the new display uses isYout, which is not passed correctly (ie. truncated) by onlinewrapper
- I broke the online display for hyperparameters (my bad)
- some suffstats are not passed correctly. In particular, as only one point/state is inverted, suffstats does not return any dx infos, only dx0. 

I am creating a new branch `fix-online` to clean up the mess I induced by the change in display.
What is the expected behaviour? All params/HP are displayed as function of time?
VBA_displayGroupBMC shows the exceedance probability of all models in the lower right panel.
Shouldn't it rather display the protected exceedance probability, when available?
