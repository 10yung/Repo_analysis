This pull request adds backers and sponsors from your Open Collective https://opencollective.com/lethargy ‚ù§Ô∏è
  
  It adds two badges at the top to show the latest number of backers and sponsors. It also adds placeholders so that the avatar/logo of new backers/sponsors can automatically be shown without having to update your README.md. [[more info](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/wiki/Github-banner)]. See how it looks on [this repo](https://github.com/apex/apex#backers).
We have also added a `postinstall` script to let people know after `npm|yarn install` that you are welcoming donations (optional). [[More info](https://github.com/OpenCollective/opencollective-cli)]
You can also add a "Donate" button to your website and automatically show your backers and sponsors there with our widgets. Have a look here: https://opencollective.com/widgets

  P.S: As with any pull request, feel free to comment or suggest changes. The only thing "required" are the placeholders on the README because we believe it's important to acknowledge the people in your community that are contributing (financially or with code!).

Hey @d4nyll, I am going to use lethargy in my project (thanks again, you're a life saver) and have started converting it to ES6 syntax  (it was the only option due to my current setup). I was wondering what are your plans regarding the library, as I know you plan to refactor https://github.com/d4nyll/smartscroll to ES6 at some point. 

I will gladly share my work here (translate to ES6 and add Babel to transpile to ES5) if you're willing to move away from coffee script. Please let me know your thoughts.
Hi, I came across an issue when using default settings and desktop mouse. If I scroll slowly on with mouse wheel, these events are marked as inertial.

Even if I switch scroll direction to opposite, it continues to be detected as inertial (`lethargy.check(ev) === false`).

**p.s.**
I'm using a [modified version](http://jsfiddle.net/renarsvilnis/59hjnw2r/8/) of the jsfiddle demo from `README.md`. I added lethargy with default settings and differentiate inertial events by coloring them red and normal events as gray.

Does not appear to work with iOS devices in demo http://d4nyll.github.io/lethargy/.

Have you seen anything to tell if the device is triggering real scroll or momentum scrolling on touch devices?

Hi,

I was having trouble using this module with webpack so I've had a go at adding a UMD based on what I could find online.

I suppose this is more a reference than a proper PR, perhaps worth considering use with webpack et al for future updates.

Thanks

Upon landing of a site, if a user scrolls up, it will have mixture of -1 and 1. Im using mac 10.11.2 El Capitan with Chrome 47. I have tried the script on your demo site and its the same. 

There are three options you can specify with lethargy, but I find the defaults works fine. If you think the defaults does not work well for you, please post here to tell us which devices it **_doesn't**_ work well, and also which settings **_does**_ work well. Many thanks!
