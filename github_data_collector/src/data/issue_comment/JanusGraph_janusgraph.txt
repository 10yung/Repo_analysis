Production in memory storage is added in the PR #1483 (issue #1482). We extend documentation with in-memory backend production usage and limitations. 
Also, it would be good to add explanations about other possible in memory solutions with JanusGraph like Aerospike or BerkeleyDb in "memory-only" mode (https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/issues/1482#issuecomment-535979445).
For discussion on internal implementation details of JanusGraph or proposing a [major new feature or subproject](https://docs.janusgraph.org/development/#development-decisions) use the [janusgraph-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/janusgraph-dev).

**Describe the feature:**
If JanusGraph added this plugin https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-gremlin/tree/master/tinkerpop/cypher-gremlin-server-plugin it may be possible to support cypher query language relatively easily. If the storage were serverless (like a managed cassandra service) and the janusgraph were containerized and run on serverless container service (like fargate or cloud run) then we could have 100% serverless autoscaling graphs with both cypher and gremlin. If this were infrastructure as code ready with ex: terraform or pulumi or cdk or cfn, the whole stack could be launched with a few termina l commands. And you'd pay nothing if you weren't using it, because it'd be serverless. That sounds like a major win, but i'm not familiar with the codebase... can you please help me add cypher and infrastructure as code?

**Describe a specific use case for the feature:**
startups or prototypes can copy a terraform template and with a couple commands launch a serverless graph with cypher and gremlin
Hi,

I'm having trouble building JanusGraph under Ubuntu 18.04 using Java 1.8
and Maven 3.6:

```
git clone  https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph.git
cd janusgraph
mvn clean install |& tee log.txt
```

Seems like the in-memory target is not being built when it's needed for some
reason. Any help you can provide about what I'm doing wrong would be
much appreciated. Full logfile attached.

Updates `jackson-databind` from 2.6.6 to 2.10.2 **This update includes security fixes.**
<details>
<summary>Vulnerabilities fixed</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Low severity vulnerability that affects com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind</strong>
FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.9.1 might allow attackers to have a variety of impacts by leveraging failure to block the logback-core class from polymorphic deserialization. Depending on the classpath content, remote code execution may be possible.</p>
<p>Affected versions: &lt; 2.9.9.1</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Moderate severity vulnerability that affects com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind</strong>
SubTypeValidator.java in FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.9.9.2 mishandles default typing when ehcache is used, leading to remote code execution.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Moderate severity vulnerability that affects com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind</strong>
A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.9.2. This occurs when Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has the logback jar in the classpath.</p>
<p>Affected versions: &lt; 2.9.9.2</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>High severity vulnerability that affects com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind</strong>
FasterXML jackson-databind through 2.8.10 and 2.9.x through 2.9.3 allows unauthenticated remote code execution because of an incomplete fix for the CVE-2017-7525 deserialization flaw. This is exploitable by sending maliciously crafted JSON input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper, bypassing a blacklist that is ineffective if the Spring libraries are available in the classpath.</p>
<p>Affected versions: &lt; 2.8.11</p>

**Describe the feature:**
This DefaultSchemaMaker would extends / proxy the JanusGraphDefaultSchemaMaker and a WARN log when an object (edge, vertex, property, ...) is created.

**Describe a specific use case for the feature:**
Sometimes some property may have been forgot to add in the schema. This can be detected using the DisableDefaultSchemaMaker but it would fail the request. With this mode, such error can be seen by looking at logs (then schema can be fixed for next schema creation).

I could implements this improvement, but I would like to know if it might be accepted.

Sometimes I have an error 
```
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Multiple entries with same key: _list_id=[_list_id] and _list_id=[_list_id]

```
That error is not 100% reproducible. If you make retry after error, than you will be succeed.
I think that guava ImmutableMap could be changed on simple HashMap.
I can make PR.
This PR is related to #1911
It currently contains the following changes:
1.add check in constructQueryWithoutProfile() method in BasicVertexCentricQueryBuilder.java.
2.The check() method will check whether the adjacent query has set the label. If not, all the labels will be obtained and set.
When the adjacent vertex query is not set label,all edges are returned.

- Version: 6929fc7540c86e06768781b31efc75548827d2ca（current）
- Storage Backend: hbase
- Mixed Index Backend: no
- Steps to Reproduce: 
```
janusGraph.multiQuery(vertex).adjacent(vertex1).edges()

If you query like this, all edges will be returned, not only the edges of adjacent vertex that have been specified，So it will lose the ability to quickly judge whether there is an edge between two vertices in super node vertex.
