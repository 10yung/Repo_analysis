On my env (fast laptop but WSL - which doesn't play nice with git) the current `prompt_git` was taking around 100ms, which was noticeable. Parsing `git status` is kinda nasty, but it seems to work and only takes 30ms. More of an FYI - feel free to reject etc.
e.g., yadm uses ~/.config/yadm/repo.git
