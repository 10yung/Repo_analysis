If it's okay, I would like to make a javascript code refactoring in the FRP book examples.
It would be great to bring to it ES6 syntax and Airbnb code style. But at least I want to make it more "functional": replace `for` loops with `map` and `reduce`, remove mutable variables and so on.

I need approval, to start the job)

Transaction regeneration should be tested to ensure it maintains the order of nodes with the same rank. This is important not only for consistent execution order, but also because the CoalesceHandler reuses the same node as Merge and must maintain its order.

I was chatting with @paldepind, who's also developing a Typescript FRP framework (https://github.com/funkia/hareactive) and he had some questions about the [Semantics](https://github.com/SodiumFRP/sodium/blob/master/denotational/Denotational%20Semantics%20of%20Sodium%20-%201.1.pdf)

I hope I get this right (if not feel free to correct), but I believe his concern was that a Cell does not allow continuous time since `C a = (a, [(T, a)])` is discrete.

Might be helpful for everyone researching this space to have some clarification of this - how do we see from the semantics that a Cell is indeed continuous?
