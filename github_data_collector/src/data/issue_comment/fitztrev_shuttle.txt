I have configured shuttle with default setting and its not opening new tab or window. I have Iterm2 stable release 3.3.6 and shuttle 1.2.9 version. When I set to "inTerminal": "current" it works. Not sure what wrong i did.

It seems the 'About' window shows the wrong version - I've just downloaded version 1.2.9, but it states the version is 1.2.8:

Also, was the latest binary really compiled all the way back in **2016**? 

If so, is there anything that we can do to help you release new binaries? Looking at the logs here, it seems that a LOT of work has been done since then, and a lot of features have already been added, but they don't show up in the current binaries... - e.g., Issues #234, #255, etc.
… submenus using their name
or can add this feature ?

Added spotlight search and preview
iTerm2 v 3.3.0beta1 just came into the public, so I installed that.
Now, Shuffle is not able to open the tab (it opens the new window without the session) when I try to open a SSH session.
Maybe you want to run one command in macOS terminal but another command in iTerm. Overrides whatever is set in the global settings. 
Is it possible to put the shortcuts in order manually?

It seems they are always shown in alphabetical order, regardless of how they are sorted in the JSON.
Why not allow users to parse the content of config for shuttle? I have in config like 20 servers over the years I use. And to migrate them all into shuttle would be amazing.
