I create a site, but no URL is being written to `vvv-custom.yml`. I have to manually add the repo and URL to the file, then run `vagrant provision` to get everything working.

Is there something I'm missing? It could be likely as I'm incredibly new to VVV.
When I run vv create it is emptying the contents of my Vagrantfile and creating an empty Vagrantfile-backup. this leads to 

`$ vagrant provision
There are errors in the configuration of this machine. Please fix
the following errors and try again:

Hello,
First of all, sorry for my English!
I trie to import db (frome file) and wp-content (from Gitlab) when create a new project with `vv create`.
I modified vv file to import wp-content to a specific folder and define WP_CONTENT_DIR WP_CONTENT_URL constants.
Everything works fine, db and wp-content are imported but the problem is in the db the `action_plugins` and `current_theme` options in wp_options table are reset. I need to activate my theme manually and reactivate all the plugins. It's a problem because I lose some plugins configurations.
Maybe I do something wrong but I don't know what.
Thank's for your help.
Hi,

As everybody knows every time we turn vagrant on/off, as well as creating/removing projects, it goes through all sites and databases, makes DB backups, etc.
Therefore, when you have 10, 20, 30+ sites with huge databases, it's taking 10-30 minutes to handle all that stuff.

So I'm wondering if there is a way to throw some sites out of that process without removing them completely? Maybe rename a project folder or a config file somewhere by suffixing it with ".off" for example?

It would be super helpful.

Thanks!

P.S. Sorry if it's a wrong product to open a new issue.
I just migrated my vvv installation to an external drive. Now when I create a new site using vv create everything works but it does not appear to be updating the /etc/hosts file. I initially tried to access my new site and received the error:

ERR_ICANN_NAME_COLLISION

I checked the /etc/hosts file and the newsite.dev was not listed, so I copied one of the other vagrant entries for the new site and now it works.

Any ideas how to fix so I don't have to manually edit my hosts file each time I create a new site?

Hi
Can anyone help me out with this issue. When installing wordpress instance i get this error and it doesn't install wordpress.
Looks like everything is working but it doesn't install wordpress.
Here is the log:

Apparently, [in an upcoming Chrome update, they'll start forcing .dev URLs to HTTPS](https://ma.ttias.be/chrome-force-dev-domains-https-via-preloaded-hsts/), which will end up causing a few headaches for people.

I've been trying to figure out how to use vv to change the URL created on initial `vv create`, but haven't come across a way to do it yet.  I know that I'll have to go search-replace the database separately, but I can't get Vagrant to accept my changes to the two nginx conf files I've found with my .dev URLs.

So, two questions arise from this:

1. Is there an ability to change the URL through VV, or through another route?
1. Are we going to get an update where the default wordpress installs and future default installs are not setup at .dev? (This one doesn't need to be answered, just more something to think about).

Thanks!
I tried many times to execute the file under vagrant SSH but couldn't, run `chmod +x vvv-init.sh` and then run it again and no reponse at all.

I have used your site creation wizard for about a year now and it has worked flawlessly. But I just tried to spin up a local environment and when I tried do a vv create. I just get the error "command not found: vv". 

Anyone have any idea what is causing this or how to fix it?
