i add a header for PSCollectionView, and cause a bug, the index 2 (sometimes other) cell have no selected event dispatch. i debug it, and found that it cause by the NSStringFromCGRect and CGRectFromString, the two method "not completely interchangeable"
i fix the bug by create a new method instead of NSStringFromCGRect. and all is ok.

+(NSString *)toString:(CGRect)frame{
    return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"{{%f, %f}, {%f, %f}}", frame.origin.x, frame.origin.y, frame.size.width, frame.size.height];
}

I want the horizontal scrolling, thank you very much.

I am adding Image with cache (SDWebImage)
and Couple of UILabel

could you plz add an exmaple project

could you plz make it pod

... rect through CGRectIntegral because the rect created and passed into the indexToRectMap sometimes would not match the actual rect created for the view when the NSStringFromCGRect call was subsequently made in the - (BOOL)gestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer shouldReceiveTouch:(UITouch *)touch and - (void)didSelectView:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer due to rounding that sometimes occurred.  This ultimately ended up in the - (void)collectionView:(PSCollectionView *)collectionView didSelectCell:(PSCollectionViewCell *)cell atIndex:(NSInteger)index not being called when a cell actually had been tapped.


It's working fine in iOS 6 but scrolling stuck in iOS 7 

This image shows the bug. Wants to make the library backward compatibile same is the problem with lower ios versions
