Ref #484

`vlucas/phpdotenv` > 4.0.0 has a breaking change as the initialization method has been split up and the old method has been removed.

The new methods require you to specify if the env definitions are immutable or mutable. 

This PR addresses this incompatibility by implementing the new `Dotenv::createImmutable` method. I don't think Bedrock is doing any overloading, so this is probably the better practice.

<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [squizlabs/php_codesniffer's releases](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/releases).*

> ## 3.5.3
> * The PHP 7.4 `T_FN` token has been made available for older versions
>     * `T_FN` represents the `fn` string used for arrow functions
>     * The double arrow becomes the scope opener, and uses a new `T_FN_ARROW` token type
>     * The token after the statement (normally a semicolon) becomes the scope closer
>     * The token is also associated with the opening and closing parenthesis of the statement
>     * Any functions named `fn` will have a `T_FN token` for the function name, but have no scope information
>     * Thanks to Michał Bundyra for the help with this change
> * PHP 7.4 numeric separators are now tokenized in the same way when using older PHP versions
>     * Previously, a number like `1_000` would tokenize as `T_LNUMBER (1), T_STRING (_000)`
>     * Now, the number tokenizes as `T_LNUMBER (1_000)`
>     * Sniff developers should consider how numbers with underscores impact their custom sniffs
> * The PHPCS file cache now takes file permissions into account
>     * The cache is now invalidated for a file when its permissions are changed
> * `File::getMethodParameters()` now supports arrow functions
> * `File::getMethodProperties()` now supports arrow functions
> * Added `Fixer::changeCodeBlockIndent()` to change the indent of a code block while auto-fixing
>     * Can be used to either increase or decrease the indent
>     * Useful when moving the start position of something like a closure, where you want the content to also move
> * Added `Generic.Files.ExecutableFile` sniff
>     * Ensures that files are not executable
>     * Thanks to Matthew Peveler for the contribution
> * `Generic.CodeAnalysis.EmptyPhpStatement` now reports unnecessary semicolons after control structure closing braces
>     * Thanks to Vincent Langlet for the patch
> * `Generic.PHP.LowerCaseKeyword` now enforces that the `fn` keyword is lowercase
>     * Thanks to Michał Bundyra for the patch
> * `Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent` now supports static arrow functions
> * `PEAR.Functions.FunctionCallSignature` now adjusts the indent of function argument contents during auto-fixing
>     * Previously, only the first line of an argument was changed, leading to inconsistent indents
>     * This change also applies to `PSR2.Methods.FunctionCallSignature`
> * `PSR2.ControlStructures.ControlStructureSpacing` now checks whitespace before the closing parenthesis of multi-line control structures
>     * Previously, it incorrectly applied the whitespace check for single-line definitions only
> * `PSR12.Functions.ReturnTypeDeclaration` now checks the return type of arrow functions
>     * Thanks to Michał Bundyra for the patch
> * `PSR12.Traits.UseDeclaration` now ensures all trait import statements are grouped together
>     * Previously, the trait import section of the class ended when the first non-import statement was found
>     * Checking now continues throughout the class to ensure all statements are grouped together
>     * This also ensures that empty lines are not requested after an import statement that isn't the last one
> * `Squiz.Functions.LowercaseFunctionKeywords` now enforces that the `fn` keyword is lowercase
>     * Thanks to Michał Bundyra for the patch
> * Fixed bug [#2586](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/issues/2586) : Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent false positives when indenting open tags at a non tab-stop
> * Fixed bug [#2638](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/issues/2638) : Squiz.CSS.DuplicateClassDefinitionSniff sees comments as part of the class name
>     * Thanks to Raphael Horber for the patch
> * Fixed bug [#2640](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/issues/2640) : Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing false positives for some negation operators
>     * Thanks to Jakub Chábek and Juliette Reinders Folmer for the patch
> * Fixed bug [#2674](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/issues/2674) : Squiz.Functions.FunctionDeclarationArgumentSpacing prints wrong argument name in error message
> * Fixed bug [#2676](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/issues/2676) : PSR12.Files.FileHeader locks up when file ends with multiple inline comments
> * Fixed bug [#2678](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/issues/2678) : PSR12.Classes.AnonClassDeclaration incorrectly enforcing that closing brace be on a line by itself
> * Fixed bug [#2685](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/issues/2685) : File::getMethodParameters() setting typeHintEndToken for vars with no type hint

## Description

When working on a site, I noticed that if I was to `error_log()` the `$_SERVER` variable that the following additional items would be available (name/user/password removed for bug report):
```
[DB_NAME] => {db_name}
[DB_USER] => {user}
[DB_PASSWORD] => {userspwd}
[WP_ENV] => production
[WP_HOME] => https://domain.test
[WP_SITEURL] => https://wp-boilerplate.test/wp
[AUTH_KEY] => generateme
[SECURE_AUTH_KEY] => generateme
[LOGGED_IN_KEY] => generateme
[NONCE_KEY] => generateme
[AUTH_SALT] => generateme
[SECURE_AUTH_SALT] => generateme
[LOGGED_IN_SALT] => generateme
[NONCE_SALT] => generateme
```

## Steps to reproduce

1. Create a local install, use any environment
2. simply `var_dump()` or `error_log()` the `$_SERVER` var
3. See results

**Expected behavior:** These sensitive data shouldn't be available via that variable

**Actual behavior:** These sensitive data shouldn't be able to output

**Reproduces how often:** 100%

## Versions

Bedrock Install: 1.12.8: 2019-09-05
macOS: 10.14.6
laravel/valet 2.3.3

## Additional information

Basic Sage 9 with Bedrocks install on local.
- **Opinionated change**: Clean up existing docblocks as well as make them more uniform across the entire package.

## What I want to ask you

I have not identified the cause. if you need more information, feel free to ask me.
We've [struggled](https://github.com/roots/bedrock/issues/154) with a good way of using WP caching plugins in the past with Bedrock due to limitations with WP itself and how the plugins worked.

These plugins rely on "drop-ins" which are counter to Bedrock's goals because they conflict with proper version control.

The good news is that as of WordPress 5.1, [object caches](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22661) can be properly conditionally loaded. Before these plugins instructed people to manually copy `object-cache.php` into the WP content dir (`/app` in Bedrock) or they'd try and use the WP filesystem API to do it themselves. Or you needed [really ugly hacks](https://webdevstudios.com/2015/11/03/loading-the-optimal-wordpress-object-cache-implementation-in-your-production-staging-and-local-development-environments/).

## Solution

With this fixed in 5.1, Bedrock could include a standard `app/object-cache.php` file which would act as a *loader* only. Depending on some configuration value(s), it would require a file in a plugin. If not, the default WP object cache behaviour would happen as usual because a`wp_cache_init` function wasn't defined.

Ignoring the hacks that were previously necessary, even the past solutions had hardcoded assumptions about class names or globals. Example: https://gist.github.com/bjornjohansen/eefbe3bfa4f5f0270a3e#file-object-cache-php-L11-L28

Ideally we just rely on Bedrock's configuration model to handle this properly. I'm not exactly sure the best way to do this yet since we'd need to require an actual filepath within a plugin. Most of these plugins have the standard `<plugin_name>/object-cache.php` but we may not be able to rely on that.

The simplest solution is:

```php
Config::define('OBJECT_CACHE_PLUGIN_FILEPATH', 'plugin-name/src/object-cache.php');
```

If `OBJECT_CACHE_PLUGIN_FILEPATH` is defined, then the loaded requires it. If not, nothing happens as usual.

### Composer metadata
It would be nice if object cache plugins could set this via metadata in their Composer package and then Bedrock could use it. But I'm not sure how realistic it is to get these developers to add that (or how it would actually work yet).

Feedback on this is welcome 😄

## Summary

I suggest bedrock `composer.json` depends upon `wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin` to provide an easier and clean extensibility method.

## Motivation

_bedrock_ is used as a boilerplate from which one creates WordPress plugins/themes set.
The main (if not sole) modification ever done is probably inside `composer.json`.
But changes from bedrock (mostly WP releases) are subject to small `composer.json` merges in the `requires` section. While that's the point of a boilerplate, that's a small (avoidable) annoyance.
`wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin` could limit, if not avoid, that.

## Additional context

`wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin` provides a way for `composer` to include external `composer` section which are merged inside the main one.

Example of suggested modifications:
```diff
--- a/composer.json
+++ b/composer.json
@@ -39,7 +39,8 @@
     "oscarotero/env": "^1.1.0",
     "roots/wordpress": "5.2",
     "roots/wp-config": "1.0.0",

+    "wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin": "dev-master"
   },
   "require-dev": {
     "squizlabs/php_codesniffer": "^3.0.2",
```

And adding a default `extra` section:
```js
    "merge-plugin": {
      "replace": true,
      "merge-extra": true,
      "include": [
        "bedrock-ext-*.json"
      ],
      "recurse": false
    }
```

That way, one would just build it's bedrock _flavor_ by add its composer files named `bedrock-ext-*.json`. No conflict/merge when upstream is updated.
