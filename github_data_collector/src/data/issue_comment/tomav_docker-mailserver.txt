<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->
As a client on my android phone, I want to use **K9**. However, I'm having a problem with it. When I disconnect the device from the network, the account is not disconnected from the dovecot server (or, put the other way, when I connect anew, the account is not reconnected, but a new connection is initiated). I have default setting of max 10 users using the same account, connecting from the same ip. So, after a few "refreshes" of my inbox in K9, I'd get error from the server, because there are too many connected accounts using the same ip.

My setup is dead simple, mostly using defaults, with one account and one alias to it. I'd be grateful if someone could point me in the direction of where I should search for the problem, or why does this happen?

I acknowledge, that it might be actually a problem with K9, as with thunderbird, the session is closed properly.

## Context
<!--- Provide a more detailed introduction to the issue itself -->
<!--- How has this issue affected you? What were you trying to accomplish? -->
I have only 2 devices connected to the server - my notebook and my phone. Logging into the container, and executing `doveadm who`, I can see something like this:
```
username            # proto (pids)             (ips)
user@mailserver.com  14 imap  (17100 18074 17101 18075 17102 17103 20131 17104 17105 17106 6800 15800 20126 18076) (150.214.58.70 150.214.58.94)
```

## Expected Behavior
<!--- Tell us what should happen -->
I would expect dovecot to reconnect to the lost connection or close the session properly.

## Actual Behavior
<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->
I think the session in dovecot is lost when the device disconnects.


## Your Environment

<!--- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the issue in -->
* **Docker version** 19.03.5, build 633a0ea838
* **image**: tvial/docker-mailserver:latest
* **K9** mail client on mobile
* **thunderbird** on notebook

I see this in my log quite often. How can I figure out what's wrong. 
(Everything seems to work, though)

Is it possible that multiple mail domains can be used (similar to mailcow).
In .env it is only possible to configure one hostname.
<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->

## Context
<!--- Provide a more detailed introduction to the issue itself -->
<!--- How has this issue affected you? What were you trying to accomplish? -->
This is almost a duplicate of #747; but I'm opening a new one as asked in https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver/issues/747#issuecomment-570647490

## Expected Behavior
<!--- Tell us what should happen -->
Logs shouldn't be crazy. :yum: 

I don't have a `/tmp/docker-mailserver/postfix-accounts.cf` file because I'm only using the image as a relay.

## Actual Behavior
<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->
Logs are crazy, exactly as in #747:


## Possible Fix
<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix or reason for the issue -->
I had to use this workaround to make the loop disappear:

```bash
docker-compose exec smtp touch /tmp/docker-mailserver/postfix-accounts.cf
```

## Steps to Reproduce
<!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->
<!--- reproduce this issue include code to reproduce, if relevant -->
1. `docker-compose up -d` in a new project.

@Tecnativa TT21161
When building for debian buster I can't find the zoo or ripole packages anywhere, so amavis complains that it lacks support for .F (might be an old warning), .doc and .zoo files:
```
Jan  6 12:20:02 mail amavis[176]: No ext program for   .zoo, tried: zoo
Jan  6 12:20:02 mail amavis[176]: No ext program for   .doc, tried: ripole
Jan  6 12:20:02 mail amavis[176]: No decoder for       .F   
Jan  6 12:20:02 mail amavis[176]: No decoder for       .doc 
Jan  6 12:20:02 mail amavis[176]: No decoder for       .zoo 
```
Zoo might be old enough that we can scrap it, but it would be nice to handle doc files. Suggestions welcome.
When building the next version for Debian Buster the fail2ban tests warn about legacy IP tables, as Debian has switched from iptables to nftables (https://wiki.debian.org/iptables). Not sure what we should do with this as the right solution may depend on what is running on the host.

* We can just ignore the warning in the tests (filter with grep) and hope that it works.
* We can use `update-alternatives` in the container to select iptables, which should get rid of the warning and work well with hosts that are running iptables. Not sure what will happen if the host runs nftables though.
* We can add a new configuration option that selects the proper implementation and allow end users to select the implementation (which is passed to `update-alternatives`). Then we can support hosts with iptables and hosts with nftables, but we add a new configuration option that people need to understand.
* We can possibly try to figure out what the host is running and use the same implementation. Not sure how easy that is, but perhaps the presence of legacy rules could be enough?

Suggestions welcome! See https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/pull/2285 and https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/issues/2331. Note that this should only affect fail2ban, I don't think we use iptables for anything else.
Assuming, I have a super simple setup. Only one domain `domain.com`, one local mailbox `mail@domain.com` and an external mailbox (e.g. Gmail) `me@gmail.com`

The goal is to catch-all emails, forward them to external as well as to the local mailbox.

```
@domain.com me@gmail.com mail@domain.com
```

Results in mails arriving twice at the external service (can see this in the logs as well).

```
mail@domain.com mail@domain.com
@domain.com me@gmail.com mail@domain.com
```
Seems to make no difference. :(

What is the solution? If there is one. Or is the duplication issue a bug?
I recently made a config change and see a weird problem since then. Cannot really tell what is going on and probably need some help on this.

I have 4 domains configured. Every domain has a main-account `mail@domain.tld`. For each of those four accounts, I have a forward to a gmail address. Furthermore, there are some additional accounts for special cases which (I don't think) relate to this problem.
```
mail@domain1.tld me@gmail.com,mail@domain1.tld
@domain1.tld me@gmail.com

mail@domain2.tld me@gmail.com,mail@domain2.tld
@domain2.tld me@gmail.com

mail@domain3.tld me@gmail.com,mail@domain3.tld
@domain3.tld me@gmail.com

additional1@domain4.tld additional1@domain4.tld,me@gmail.com
additional2@domain4.tld additional2@domain4.tld,me@gmail.com

mail@domain4.tld me@gmail.com,mail@domain4.tld
@domain4.tld me@gmail.com
```
Because gmail is blocking some forwarded emails (ARC), I wanted to additionally store all emails in the mailserver's mailboxes as well and changed my config to:
```
mail@domain1.tld me@gmail.com,mail@domain1.tld
@domain1.tld me@gmail.com,mail@domain1.tld

mail@domain2.tld me@gmail.com,mail@domain2.tld
@domain2.tld me@gmail.com,mail@domain2.tld

mail@domain3.tld me@gmail.com,mail@domain3.tld
@domain3.tld me@gmail.com,mail@domain3.tld

additional1@domain4.tld additional1@domain4.tld,me@gmail.com
additional2@domain4.tld additional2@domain4.tld,me@gmail.com

mail@domain4.tld me@gmail.com,mail@domain4.tld
@domain4.tld me@gmail.com,mail@domain4.tld
```

Everything seems to work as expected. Except that some emails seem to be duplicated and arrive twice in gmail. It is only mails being sent from different server systems to my domain1.tld. This domain is purely used for machine-communication (cron mails, backup notifications, etc). All this emails are being duplicated. If I use the same account and manually send me an email, I only receive it once. Also my normal emails to the other three domains arrive as they should.

I must be overlooking something really stupid here.... Any idea where to start looking? Or is my setup screwed? I am a little bit confused about the name overloading between accounts and aliases in the configuration. Maybe something like this would be better?

```
mail@domain1.tld me@gmail.com,mail@domain1.tld
@domain1.tld mail@domain1.tld

mail@domain2.tld me@gmail.com,mail@domain2.tld
@domain2.tld mail@domain2.tld

mail@domain3.tld me@gmail.com,mail@domain3.tld
@domain3.tld mail@domain3.tld

additional1@domain4.tld additional1@domain4.tld,me@gmail.com
additional2@domain4.tld additional2@domain4.tld,me@gmail.com

mail@domain4.tld me@gmail.com,mail@domain4.tld
@domain4.tld mail@domain4.tld
```
Or will that only forward the `mail@domainX.tld` emails to Gmail?

## Context 
Hello, I have made a fresh install of this wonderful docker mailserver on a Kubernetes cluster, everything was fine until I turn on ClamAV. (ENABLE_CLAMAV=1).

## Expected Behavior
ClamAV should be able to analyze the emails without permission problems

## Actual Behavior
When I send an e-mail, I can see the following lines in the logs :
> Jan  3 14:41:15 mailserver-98d4ff8b5-7mdbf amavis[2074]: (02074-01) (!)run_av (ClamAV-clamd) FAILED - unexpected , output="/var/lib/amavis/tmp/amavis-20200103T144115-02074-u7EETtwj/parts: lstat() failed: Permission denied. ERROR\n"
> Jan  3 14:41:15 mailserver-98d4ff8b5-7mdbf amavis[2074]: (02074-01) (!)ClamAV-clamd av-scanner FAILED: CODE(0x555f4a97ab00) unexpected , output="/var/lib/amavis/tmp/amavis-20200103T144115-02074-u7EETtwj/parts: lstat() failed: Permission denied. ERROR\n" at (eval 97) line 905.
> Jan  3 14:41:15 mailserver-98d4ff8b5-7mdbf amavis[2074]: (02074-01) (!)WARN: all primary virus scanners failed, considering backups

And when I do ls -al /var/lib/amavis/tmp/, I get this :
> drwxr-x--- 4 amavis amavis 4096 Jan  3 13:57 .
> drwxrwx--- 8 amavis amavis 4096 Jan  3 14:02 ..
> drwxr-x--- 3 amavis amavis 4096 Jan  3 13:54 amavis-20200103T135427-03471-hZa4ayDp
> drwxr-x--- 3 amavis amavis 4096 Jan  3 13:56 amavis-20200103T135654-03470-3AUK9KTg

The clamav user is in the amavis group, and vice versa (this is the solution suggested by all the posts I've read until now), and I don't know why it doesn't work, excepted that the folders in the /var/lib/amavis/tmp/ repository are in 750 instead of 770 ?

I've tried with an external volume and inside the container, the issue is the same.
It's really close to this issue : https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver/issues/1308, but I didn't find any fix in it although it's closed.
Can someone help me ?

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Install it
2. Send a mail from an user to himself, for example

## Your Environment
* Amount of RAM available: 8 GB
* Mailserver version used: latest
* Docker version used: Embedded in K3s 1.16
