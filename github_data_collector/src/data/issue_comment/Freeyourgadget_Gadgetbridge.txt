We will try a full migration to codeberg.org on 10th December 2019 in three days.

Technically GitHub has been a mirror for quite some while for wiki and repository, but the main interaction happened still here since Issues and PRs were hard to migrate (lock-in effect)

So What will happen on 2019-12-10

- GitHub repo will be archived to prevent creation of new issues/PRs
- We will try a full migration to a private repo on codeberg and see if everything worked
- On success we will make the new codeberg repo public and announce the move in README.md, on failure we will unarchive the GitHub and try some weeks later.

The app used to display the charts almost inmediately; since the last update, it takes long to display them and often shows the message that is the title of this issue before actually showing the charts without any other problem than the mentioned slowness.

Please add support for "Keep Fit" tracker.
The only Dokumentation I found so far is this:

https://www.xindao.com/productdocumentdownload/SanaStore/5639097501/P33075x+Activity+tracker+Keep+fit+Manual+(1)


As many of the supported watches offer an calorie-consumption-tracker it would be very useful if this information is viewable similar to the puls, steps and sleep panel.

Thanks anyway from a very happy amazfit gts user.
Hi friends,

I think there is a problem with DB export. I exported the DB and tried to analyse it in gadgetstats and it shows nothing.

The device model: SPORT v1.60.1 SN 195A.

You can download the DB in the link https://1drv.ms/u/s!AggPFPUrJJSTg8tQf5K7Y8PFqpokwA?e=eeoAWI.

Thank you.

#### Your issue is:

Gadgetbridge cannot reconnect to a device regularly (even though it is trying). Trying to connect manually fail also in this case.

Here is how to reproduce:
1. Add Mi Band 3 to Gadgetbridge (it is connected now)
2. Reboot your Android
3. Gadgetbridge cannot connect to Mi Band anymore

Work around:
1. Click add a new device and wait for your device to appear
2 If it fails to find your device do "search" 1 or 2 more times. Usually on the 3rd try the device appears in the list.
3. **Do not add** Mi Band and just go back to previous menu (if you add the device the data which was collected by the band recently will not be reflected and get lost)
4. Click on the device to make it try to connect -> in a few seconds the device is connected
5. Click sync -> all data from the band successfully fetched

#### Your issue is:
MB4 says "connecting in the status bar.
If I open GB it says "Fetching acivity data"

In the earlier bug for this GB itself said "connecting"

This happened when the device was in range.
It is the 2nd time I got this, previous time it might be on the previous GB version.

The MB4 was continuously in range (within 5 meter or so). It may be that about that time it hit the 15% battery power.

I would like to be able to send a notification directly to the device, bypassing android notifications, as can be done from the "Debug" view with the "SEND" button. However, I want to do this via an intent from Termux, Tasker, or the adb shell. It seems like the functionality is there embedded in the Debug view, but I don't know how to go about exposing it as an external intent. I'm not sure if these notifications are generic within Android or if Gadgetbridge is having to do something specific to talk to the device.

#### Your wearable device is:

Amazfit BIP, but generic functionality would be better.

#### Your android version is:
Android 8+

#### Your Gadgetbridge version is:

#### Your issue is:

Blacklist mode using _Whitelist all notificaitons_ option (#366) not working properly if using **work profile** (_Shelter_ utility from _F-Droid_ that isolates applications into a separate work profile, more on this [here](https://developer.android.com/work/managed-profiles)). For example, I've installed a _mail application_ on my work profile and _Gadgetbridge_ on my main profile. I don't want notifications from the _mail app_ appear on my device (e.g. Mi Band 3), so, I want to disable them. But due to the _mail app_ being on a separate profile â€” _Gadgetbridge_ can't find it and doesn't show it in the list. So there is literally no way for me to disable the notifications for the _mail app_ except move _Gadgetbridge_ itself to work profile or vice versa.

#### Your solution is:

Implement _Switch to Whitelist_ mode (and if already in _whitelist_ mode, change the button to _Switch to Blacklist_), so only checked applications can send notifications (in my case it's just _Telegram_ and _Mastodon_). It can be another option in the _Notifications blacklist_ options menu, or just checkbox in settings. Whitelist mode is pretty similar to _MiFit_ one.

#### Your issue is:
Regular Telegram notifications are sent and displayed in mi Mi Band 4, however secret chat notification are not. Notifications for secret chat are functioning in Android. 

#### Your wearable device is:
Mi Band 4
HW V0.25.130.5
FW 1.0.7.44

#### Your android version is:
Android 9, LOS 16.0

#### Your Gadgetbridge version is:
0.39.0

Extra info: I believe that I had the same issue with Mi Band 3 and telegram secret chats.
Only recently I started using secret chats more often, so that's probably the reason I didn't really notice before.
So I guess it's not a recent issue. Also found a similar mention of it here https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/issues/1109#issuecomment-392732873

Perhaps this is by design, perhaps it's better to not display secret chat directly on the wearable, but it would be nice to have some form of notification.
A general notification or a notification that a secret chat has arrived would be great.
