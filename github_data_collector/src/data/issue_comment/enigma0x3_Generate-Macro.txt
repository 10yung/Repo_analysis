Hello...I tried using HTTP and HTTPS but does not open a session.  Using Win10 and Office 2010

Thx
i tried with office 2016 and receive a lot of errors..
I know Invoke-Shellcode works excellent in LAN connections. Does Invoke-Shellcode work in WAN?? I have never tried it, so has anyone tried whether the Generate-Macro file generates payloads for WAN?? If we enter the no-ip address for ip and the required port and send it to my victim. Will the victim in WAN get hacked over the internet?? I have not tried it so im asking.

Right after opening and enabling the macro's , the powershell stops working.
Tested on office 2016 and 2007.
Do you have an idea what this could be?


alright i've been playing around with this for some time but the task doesn't seem to show up, it does create a session but it only lasts until restart,
is it possible to include task scheduler with logon persistence ?
