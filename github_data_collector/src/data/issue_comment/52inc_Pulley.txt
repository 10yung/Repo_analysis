How to add my own elements like a button in PulleyViewController? I created it in my storyboard but didn't show when App runs.
- Download the sample app, open the drawer to the fully open position, and then change the value of `allowsUserDrawerPositionChange` to false. The drawer will glitch 20pts downward. 
- For some reason changing the value of `drawerScrollView.isScrollEnabled` is messing up the content offset, so I simply saved the content offset before the `isScrollEnabled` change and reset it to the same value after without animation, and this fixed the visual bug.
Using IB, it would appear that the pull gesture does not work with OSX Catalyst. The functionality works perfectly on iOS and iPadOS Builds however.

Hey guys,

I'm having problems with dynamic type in combination with Pulley. I've put a simple (auto-layouted) UITableView into my drawer VC. When I change the font size in Settings -> Accessibility -> Display & Text Size -> Larger Text before starting the app everything works fine. 
However, if the app is already running and I change the font size it doesn't update the UILabels in my table view accordingly. It seems like UIContentSizeCategory.didChangeNotifications are not passed to the drawer VC. I've already tried observing this notification in the UITableViewCell and calling view.layoutIfNeeded(), but that doesn't solve the issue.
Do you have any idea how to fix this?  
I had case when Drawer provided puller tip at the top of drawer body with transparent background. In result I get something like this:

I know there is an option to make custom shape, but I thought that delegating that stuff to a drawer could be a nice idea.

Hey guys, I have an issue I can't seem to rectify. I have a UITabBarController with 4 tabs, one of those tabs is a PulleyViewController. The primary controller is a UINavigationController, when I click on the tab everything is in order, but when I go to another tab and then return the primary controller goes blank / shows a white view. 

I managed to fix it by making the primary controller the top view controller of the navigation controller but that's not what I want.
I tried adding Pulley with Carthage, and while it sort of works, i can't tap the map that i drew behind the drawer.

e.g.

````
class MyViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
                let drawer: UIViewController = UIViewController()
        drawer.view.backgroundColor = .red
        
        let main = UIViewController()
        let mv = MKMapView()
        mv.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        main.view.addSubview(mv)
        mv.leftAnchor.constraint(equalTo: main.view.leftAnchor).isActive = true
        mv.rightAnchor.constraint(equalTo: main.view.rightAnchor).isActive = true
        mv.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: main.view.topAnchor).isActive = true
        mv.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: main.view.bottomAnchor).isActive = true
        
        let pulley = PulleyViewController(contentViewController: main, drawerViewController: drawer)
        pulley.allowsUserDrawerPositionChange = false
        pulley.displayMode = .automatic
        pulley.panelCornerPlacement = .topRight
        
        pulley.view.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        self.view.addSubview(pulley.view)
        pulley.view.leftAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.leftAnchor).isActive = true
        pulley.view.rightAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.rightAnchor).isActive = true
        pulley.view.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.topAnchor).isActive = true
        pulley.view.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.bottomAnchor).isActive = true
    }
}
```
The area below my red drawer can't be interacted with, e.g. if i double tap it then the mapview doesn't zoom in. It seems that the `PulleyPassthroughScrollView` doesn't pass the hits down somehow.

It works fine in demo app, but that uses Storyboards.

Any ideas on what i did wrong?
Hey, so the pulley itself is great, but I have a little issue, I am transforming the primary view by 180 degrees, the drawer as well, everything works well. 
But when I want to constraint my elements in the primary view, the top and bottom layout guides don't work and I can't use safe area below IOS 11. 
So when I constraint my element to the top with 0 constant it is on top of the notification bar, how can I get the transformation to account the top and bottom safe areas correctly below IOS 11?

Don't default to collapsed state when current drawer position isn't supported
