that is apparently not used anywhere
I'm trying to package this for [nixos](https://nixos.org) and there were concerns raised about apparently unmaintained dependencies.

Would you mind commenting on those, if you plan to remove or replace them and if you think the concerns raised are valid?

## python-openid (dependency of flask-openid)

https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/38788#issuecomment-381397143

- not python3 ready
- apparently open vulnerabilities (https://github.com/openid/python-openid/issues/66, https://github.com/openid/python-openid/issues/67)
- not updated in 4 years, not released in 8
- @FRidh suggested making that dependency optional, is that feasible?

## flask-oldessions

https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/38787#issuecomment-381397348

- similarly not updated in 6 years
- tests failing


## Misc

The main maintainer of python packages in nixpkgs would also like to reduce the dependencies on flask extensions in general, if that is possible:

In a sage-devel post on 7 December 2017 [1], David Cousens suggests
the menu section of sagenb worksheets should be made non-scrolling,
leaving only the part with cells to be scrollable. He observes:

> I find myself often scrolling back through a large page to reach the
> menu and then having to scroll back to where I was in the worksheet.

In the same discussion, Karl-Dieter Crisman notes that the suggested
behaviour is the one available in CoCalc Sage worksheets (.sagews)
and Jupyter notebook worksheets (.ipynb).

Currently the upload of data files via the "Data Upload" interface produces an error.

The relevant portion from the server standard error is attached.
[error_upload.txt](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/files/1429813/error_upload.txt)

More later.

One gets "500: Internal server error." - also [reported](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/5ku8XGHesKI/2KWzMwQyCAAJ) on sage-devel and [on ask.sagemath.org](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/38486/build-error-when-uploading-notebooks-in-sage/?comment=38658#post-id-38658)

A workaround is to upload individual sws files (i.e. Sagenb notebook files).
If I manage Users from the Admin account, I get an 500: Internal Server error when I delete users or suspend users. Anyway the users are deleted or suspended in the notebook gui, but the directories are not deleted!

Can I delete the user symlinks and user directories manually?

What's wrong with my installation?

I configured sagenotebook server with apache as https proxy. I have this running quite a time now.

Now I realized that some requests from the notebook try to get a page with http:// . I assume, it's hardcoded somewhere.

So for a working notebook it is not sufficent to open port 443 in the firewall only. It is also necessary to open port 80 as well.

So if I watch packets, from time to time I get not only encrypted packets , but also some http requests.

It seems that they happen for example if the worksheet list of a user is called

GET /home/anyuser/

or

GET /pub/

or

GET /logout

Has anyone an idea how to solve this?

Maybe in local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sagenb/flask_version/worksheet.py

the line

addr = 'http%s://%s/home/%s' % ('' if not g.notebook.secure else 's',

could be responsible for that.

But starting noteboook with secure=True doesn't work, and should not be used together with apache as https proxy, I think ??

If I alter the line no change in behavoiur.

Any Ideas?

Thanks

There could be a checkbox system, perhaps with a check all button, for granting user management things like deletion.
