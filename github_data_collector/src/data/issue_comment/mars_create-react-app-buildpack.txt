Hello,

Thank you for your work ! I'm using your buildpack and it works very well but I have a question. 

I am trying to serve my assets from a CDN, so I created two CDN, one for my staging app an another one for my production app. I put the CDN's url in the `PUBLIC_URL` env var and it works fine in staging. Indeed `PUBLIC_URL` is set at build time. Unfortunately, when my app is “promoted” to production (I am using heroku's pipeline) `PUBLIC_URL` keeps staging's url. 

I tried to rename the env var to `REACT_APP_PUBLIC_URL` but it doesn't work better. 

Do you have an idea to make it works without rebuild the app for production ?

Thank you !
Hello! I'm wondering the support for heroku release phase: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/release-phase

What I'm trying to do it rebuild the react app after changing a REACT_APP env var or promoting from staging -> production, so I have:

```
release: npm run build (performs react-scripts build)
```

Doing this rebuilds the app but doesn't seem to change the variable on the app. I've also tried the runtime configuration with no success. I have to re-deploy with github for the changes to work. Is there something I'm missing in the release command?

Thanks.
