Seven years old, and now is meaningless. 
Currently the solution crashes due to incorrect thread, which can be easily solved by surrounding the UI interaction statements with invokeonmain
The UI is not showing on the SirikitSample: https://github.com/xamarin/ios-samples/tree/master/ios11/SiriKitSample

The app is building without any issue/error to the device, but when the app starts the scree is just blank.

Regarding - https://github.com/xamarin/ios-samples/tree/master/ios13/RefreshingAndMaintainingYourAppUsingBackgroundTasks

I have tried to run xamarin 'Refreshing and Maintaining Your App Using Background Tasks' sample on iphone7(iOS 13.2) using VS2019 for mac. But I am not getting any callback for BGAppRefreshTask or BGProcessingTask in background.

I have enabled UIbackground modes in Info.plist(fetch and processing).
Added BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers key and uniques task ids to Info.plist
Tried diffrent EarliestBeginDate intervals(5,15,30 minutes).Used local notification to show the callback.

I tried with native swift sample code also.There  I was able to receive the callbacks.

So do I need to add anything else for getting callback in xamarin?

Configuration
OS:Catalina 10.15
iphone version:iphone 7(iOS 13.2)
Portable.BouncyCastle is the official portable version of the package.
The sample as written calls `SetCategory` and `SetMode` early on in `StartRecording`.
It needs to either save their initial values and set them back on completion or set them to defaults (`Playback` and `ModeDefault`).

Failing to do so inhibits audio output on devices (although it works in simulator).

Example code:
```
				if (error != null || isFinal) {
					audioSession.SetCategory (AVAudioSessionCategory.Playback);
					audioSession.SetMode (AVAudioSession.ModeDefault, out err);
					node.RemoveTapOnBus (0);
					audioEngine.Dispose ();
					recognitionRequest.Dispose ();
					recognitionTask.Dispose ();
					recognitionRequest = null;
					recognitionTask = null;
				}
```
In ios11/ARKitSample/ARKitSample/GameViewController.cs

After running the code, it works as expected until I tap on the screen, the gesture recognize event is called and it works fine the first time - I get a plane node with a snapshot of the screen. But when this is called the second time, instead of creating a new node at the location of the second tap, it overlaps the initial child node.

The behaviour is different from the original version demoed here -  https://youtu.be/LLRweyZ1KpA?t=1380

Example behaviour after a few screen taps:

The Chat sample crash on iOS 11 and above. Also does not work correctly in regards to showing/hiding keyboard.
- updated assets
- re-created projects
- updated main and added launch storyboards
- updated screenshots and readme, license, metadata
- fixed iPhone X view
- all changes are related to the original sample
