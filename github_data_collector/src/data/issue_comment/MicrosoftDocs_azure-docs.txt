As per the document Azure IoT edge should be installed in Raspberry PI. I tried to install Azure Iot Edge on RPI on Raspberry PI 3 B+ , OS - Win IoT core build 17763 using the following document 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge-windows .

During Option 1: Install and manually provision step 3 The Deploy-IoTEdge command  I am getting following issue :

IoT Edge is currently not supported on Windows ARM32. See https://aka.ms/iotedge-platsup for more details.

I have an docker image containing a .NET Core 3.0 API application that I have pushed to docker hub.

Dockerfile
```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.0-buster-slim AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.0-buster AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["pswebapi.csproj", ""]

COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/."
RUN dotnet build "pswebapi.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

RUN dotnet publish "pswebapi.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

Inside of Azure, i'm creating a Web app for containers. However, the container seems to fail to start according to the logs:
```
2020-01-18 18:02:43.659 INFO  - Logging is not enabled for this container.
Please use https://aka.ms/linux-diagnostics to enable logging to see container logs here.

2020-01-18 18:02:44.326 INFO  - Stoping site webapibrajzore because it failed during startup.
```

I have tried to set both PORT and WEBSITES_PORT to 80 in the configuration, but it don't work.
Hello, I think I found a typo.
In the "Reservation discount for non-Windows VMs" section, in the 2nd sentence of point 1), it reads, "You're not charge for any usage below... " 
Please consider changing "charge" to "charged".
Thank you

Each virtual network can have only one VPN gateway. 

Virtual network gateway

A virtual network can have two virtual network gateways; one VPN gateway and one ExpressRoute gateway - as is the case with coexisting connection configurations. 

So how many gateways can a virtual network have ?

We are trying to use self hosted integration runtime to extract data from on-prem fileshare. To implement CI/CD, i have created arm templates from the data factory where IR is successfully working and i enabled sharing on for the datafactory in which i am going to deploy my pipelines using arm templates. I can successfully deploy pipeline and self hosted IR and linked services but IR is not available in the new data factory connections. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59570723/72666187-c73bf980-3a07-11ea-9789-54b674a3177f.png)


Is it normal? Because to use CI/CD with data factory, as soon as arm get deployed we should be ready to run pipelines without manual changes? And if i am correct then can anyone help why IR in the new datafactory isnt available which making pipeline failed when i am trying to run. 
I create a AKS Cluster via the Azure Portal with RBAC. When connecting to the Kubernetes Dashboard I get lot's of permission alerts. When I make changes to the Kubernetes Dashboard Deployment, Clusterrolebinding or Clusterrole the changes get reset immediately. How can I make the changes persistent?


Kubernetes: 1.17.0
Kubernetes Dashboard: aksrepos.azurecr.io/mirror/kubernetesui/dashboard:v2.0.0-beta8

…called "active"

In case the authorization server does not include a property called "active", the API Management server returns "500 Internal Server Error". The instructions I've include provide a quick working alternative.
Screen shots have options thar aren't on my ARM Azure Portal
There is no "detach" anywhere.

Great scenario sample, but one thing I'd like to add is change the default voting-app access URI to a specific path (maybe /vote) instead of root (/) for some istio deployments.
