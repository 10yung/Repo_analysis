the mongodb has to be configured at travis in order for tests to pass though.

to lock down the dependencies?

like 

``` bash
$coffee debug server.coffee
```

express-coffee index page is run slower 10x than pure expressjs with db connect. Can you give me some suggestion to fix that.

Thanks for making this express-coffee project, I'm happy to have found it!

I'm having a little trouble with the `cake dev` task -- the server won't start and I see an error:

```
$ cake dev

```

However, when I commented out either of the lines that pipe the supervisor's output streams to stdout and stderr, there is no error displayed and the server starts. These lines are 96 and 97 in the Cakefile in master@HEAD of as now.

Weird. Any ideas what the problem is?

I was thinking of making some changes in the somewhat near future and replacing some (somewhat core) dependencies like:
### connect-assets -> [asset-rack](https://github.com/techpines/asset-rack)

asset-rack is much easier to configure and write plugins for. connect-assets v3 looks cool but the development is slow and asset-rack already offers the same options and then some
### bootrap-stylus -> [axis-css](https://github.com/jenius/axis)

Axis is a Stylus library that is somewhere in between bootstrap and nib.
### [consolidate.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/consolidate.js)

Express doesn't need consolidate.js to configure it, but I figure if we have it in the code as a sample it'll be easy to swap templates.

Thoughts?
