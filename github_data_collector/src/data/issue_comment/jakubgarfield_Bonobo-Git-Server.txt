Any user can clone master branch, make changes and push changes back into master branch. Push should be restricted only to users, that are administrators in repository that commit is pushed into.
I had that scenario occurred numerous times in my team, which can lead to mess.
Provide away to create/manage groups, then change the Group TextBox when creating/updating a repo to a dropdown list

Solved by starting a thread to read the output stream of the console app.
When there aremany new branches on the server which are not on the client, Git pull hangs during the communication with Bonobo. This happens when the response of upload-pack is larger than 4k.
The ouput (and input) buffer of a console app is maximum 4 k. 
When the output buffer is full git stops processing the input buffer. Thereby the process hangs.
- I am using **Eclispe IDE**;
- We are using **Bonobo Git** on Windows server;
- The global render of our project is on another distant **DEV server**.

**Every push to master branch on the Bonobo server**, we would like to **upload the updated files through SFTP on the DEV server**.

How can I setup (and where) an SFTP to upload to the DEV server only when I push to the master branch?

Should we do it this way:

> Local → [COMMIT & PUSH] → GIT server → **[SFTP]** → DEV server.

Or this way:

> Local → [COMMIT & PUSH] → GIT server.

> If PUSH:

> Local →           **[SFTP]**          → DEV server.

Thank you.

I am running Bonobo Git Server 6.5 on IIS 8 and Server 2012 R2. Bonobo is using Active Directory Membership Service which works fine with Cookie AuthenticationProvider. The issue occurs when changing to Windows AuthenticationProvider and IIS Basic Authentication.

I am sure this worked earlier today when I first tried this config. I did a fresh install in case I had broken something, but get the same results. I then found NET Framework 4.8 (KB4506993) was installed without my knowledge. I removed the update but still have the issue.

_Bonobo Git Server (6.3.0.632)._

Requesting for an inexistent  file, for example

> GET /git/Repository/xxxxxxxx/master/Raw/Nonexistent.yaml?display=True HTTP/1.1

returns 

>  HTTP/1.1 200 OK

while 404 expected.

Hi.

My problem is that users doesn't log out automatically on browser restart or timeout set in web.config. The only way to log out is to press "Sign Out". What am I doing wrong?
