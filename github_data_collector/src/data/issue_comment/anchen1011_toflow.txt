Hi, according to the paper section 4.3, STN layer is used for transformation estimation. Seems the implementation you use in this repo only support affine transformation? So does it mean in Fig2 the "warped input" is just an affine transformation of "Input frames"?
To reproduce the results of the paper on video denoising, I want to load the pre-trained model to evaluate on the test set of Vimeo-90 dataset. But when I reload the model using torch7, I have encountered the following problem:

Could you help me check if the pre-trained model has any problem? @anchen1011 
Hi, @anchen1011 

What is the number of parameters for the interpolation model? We would like to compare your model with ours.

Thanks.
Thank you very much for your work.  It is a extremely good work .
I have a problem about how to divide vimeo90K dataset into training set and LR images?

I have seen that there is a get_path_sep.m in src/evalution and sep_trainlist.txt in data. 
I want to know how to call to generate the corresponding training set ?

Thanks a lot.

Hi, @anchen1011 . I pre-trained the flownet on the Sintel dataset but that does not converge . The batchsize is 16 and learning rate is 0.0001,  the loss is  defined by calculating the l1 difference between the last sub-net's output and the ground truth. Can you share the details about pre-training the flownet?
