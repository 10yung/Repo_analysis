Is there an alternative? NanoCPUs is the simplest way to limit CPU usage by a container.

It is in the docker HostConfig: https://github.com/docker/engine/blob/master/api/types/container/host_config.go#L391
within the Resources struct:
https://github.com/docker/engine/blob/master/api/types/container/host_config.go#L345
see https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/954d729ab85cf254f96a461482771646830da774/api/types/client.go#L369

Thanks!
Hi,
Any plans to add an SSH client to docker lib?
From 18.09 users can connect to the docker daemon using SSH password less
Situation:
I have a docker daemon running under CoreOS and exposed the TCP port by creating and binding a TCP socket (as described in the docs https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/customizing-docker.html) 

I have the situation that in some cases the server config (using Ignition) fails and the docker daemon does not start up, but the socket on port 2375 is reachable.
When calling now `client.PullImage` the request stays hanging at that point. 
I tried to pass `InactivityTimeout` but without result. 
Is there some other way to pass some timeout to the PullImage call?
thx & cheers
Heiko
