### Issue Description
I have been trying for a long time to get the Pose-apriltag example to work, but I can't get the cpp to compile.

I have tried following the directions here
https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/examples/pose-apriltag

but can't get it to compile at all.
Could someone help guide me through this process?

Hi everyone,

As reported on the official RealSense Twitter, LIPS Corp have introduced a new RealSense powered product called the LIPSMetric Parcel Kiosk for measuring the dimensions and weight of a package and printing the label.

>  I need to merge rs-trajectory and rs-save to disk program also need to have multiple pipeline single device .

`I have camera/device connected and camera is on in video mode....now i want to have image of that video which i can do using rs-save-to-disk code...also i need to find trajectory of the same video which i can find using rs-trajectory code.`
**Now i want to merge this two code...problem i am facing is rs-trajectory uses cfg when we start pipeline....but rs-save-to-disk does not use cfg when we start pipeline....how can i do this??.....What I found is that I cannot use two pipelines for same camera/device I guess, please help me** 

Thanks in advance....!!!!!!!!
Hii...
I am combining two realsense code, i.e rs-save-to-disk & rs-trajectory but when I run them together it gives error message : 

`RealSense error calling rs2_pipeline_start_with_config(pipe:0x2844720, config:0x284ca80):
    No device connected
`
Is there any way to solve this problem.
Hello,

I am working with the Tracking Camera T265 and i am facing problem when try to combine two programs together (rs-save to disk with rs-trajectory) it shows the error:

RealSense error calling rs2_pipeline_start_with_config(pipe:0x20756f0, config:0x20668e0):

if anyone can help it would be greatful.

Thank you
Warn users that try and fail to access frame metadata that they may be able to enable support for frame metadata by making OS level changes.  It took me quite a long time to figure this out, and other users [continue](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/5596) to run into this problem.

### Issue Description

We have a robot with 2 Intel Realsense cameras connected to a DFI industrial computer. 
We have observed during multiple incidents that either one or more cameras will disappear seamingly at random and it is not able to recover even after executing recovery behaviours such as hardware_reset https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/1086 through the SDK.
When this happens, we are not able to query the cameras through *rs-enumerate-devices*.
The only solution that is reliable is powering down the system completely for an extended time (30+ minutes) or most of the times it works with physically replugging the cameras. None of these is not a valid solution for us.
By reading associated issues, we came across solutions that suggest bumping the firmware to the latest recommended version (we did that recently) https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/4457,
solutions that suggest changing the USB cables (we have tested many, the provided ones and high end aftermarket but the issue persists).
We also tested the suggestion from https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/4552#issuecomment-518370718 to bind/unbind the xhci_hd driver but it does not help in our case.
Finally we have performed the test from https://github.com/NoMagicAi/reproduce_d400_camera_issue. We perform the test 100 times with 4 D435 cameras attached to a single DFI which resulted in 2 cameras disappearing after a short while and they didn't recover even through shutting down the machine for 3 minutes. 
I've attached the output of the before-mentioned test in *experiment.log* and the output of dmesg after each experiment in *syslog.log*.
We also caught one of the random camera disconnects/reconnect after which it didn't work and we performed a hardware reset and it still didn't work. I've attached the syslog from that event and called it  *camera_randomly_disappearing.log*

Issue Description:

I am using a D435 camera to record a .bag file and later using this recorded file to create point clouds. When I am reading in the .bag in C++ all the depth values are 0. However if I read in the same .bag in Pyhton it has all the correct depth values. I need to use C++ but I can't get the depth values from the file. Below are short copies of both codes:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++:
```
	rs2::pipeline pipeline;
	rs2::config cfg;
	cfg.enable_device_from_file(BagFilePath, false);

	pipeline.start(cfg);

	rs2::frameset frames = pipeline.wait_for_frames(); 
	rs2::depth_frame depth_frame = frames.get_depth_frame();	

	const int width = depth_frame.get_width();
	const int height = depth_frame.get_height();

	std::cout << "Distance at centre is " << depth_frame.get_distance(int(width / 2), int(height / 2)) << " meters.";
	
	pipeline.stop();
```
C++ result: "Distance at centre is 0 meters."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Python:
```
pipeline = rs.pipeline()
cfg = rs.config()

rs.config.enable_device_from_file(cfg, BagFilePath, False)

pipeline.start(cfg)

frames = pipeline.wait_for_frames()
depth_frame = frames.get_depth_frame()

width = depth_frame.get_width()
height = depth_frame.get_height()

print("Distance at centre is  ", depth_frame.get_distance(int(width/2), int(height/2)), " meters.")

pipeline.stop()  
```
Python result: "Distance at centre is   0.45600003004074097  meters.."



I own a D415
Can anyone recommend any lbrary of bag files ?
More specifically I neef a repository of bag files of pedestrian circulation indoor records.






Bug #5479

Cause: relocalization notification callback registration happens before record_sensor::hook_sensor_callbacks() is called which is to register stream callback. The stream callback registration overwritten m_user_notification_callback that has been registered as reloc notification callback. That caused recursive call on on_notification() and will crash App.

Fix: register notification callback to base sensor before record_sensor::hook_sensor_callbacks() is called which is to register stream callback.
