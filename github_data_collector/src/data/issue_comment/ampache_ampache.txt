Would be nice if the API doc had some examples of returned data. Ideally in both XML and JSON. 

This can probably be done by anyone as long as long as they have permission to edit the documentation.
Hi @lachlan-00,

when using the current develop version I experienced an empty album list on the artist page. In the debug log the following error occurs:

` 2020-01-16 21:36:40 [xyz] (dba.class) -> Error_query SQL: SELECT MAX(``album``.``id``) AS ``id``, ``album``.``release_type``, ``album``.``mbid`` FROM ``album`` LEFT JOIN ``song`` ON ``song``.``album``=``album``.``id`` LEFT JOIN ``catalog`` ON ``catalog``.``id`` = ``song``.``catalog`` WHERE (``song``.``artist``='1234' OR ``album``.``album_artist``='1234')  GROUP BY ``album``.``prefix``, ``album``.``name``, ``album``.``album_artist``, ``album``.``release_type``, ``album``.``mbid``, ``album``.``year``  ORDER BY ``album``.``name``, ``album``.``disk``, ``album``.``year``
2020-01-16 21:36:40 [xyz] (dba.class) -> Error_query MSG: ["42000",1055,"Expression #2 of ORDER BY clause is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'ampache.album.disk' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by"] `

This error is independent of the used MySQL version (7.x or 8) and depends on the used sql_mode=only_full_group_by.

Please validate the provided fix and merge if it is ok for you.

Hello I have problems with the dropbox catalog.

I always get the message:

ERROR: No media updated, do you respect the patterns?

What can you do?

I have done the same thing with 2 freshly installed servers.



I'd like to make several suggestions that should increase the appearance of professionalism and hopefully improve the team's skills as developers.


1.  Make use of the Ampache developer team space. Ask @Afterster to give you maintainer status and then induct the current active developers into the team. 



2. Use the discussion feature to explore any anticipated modifications.

    * If the change is not a bug fix, why wasn't the change you want to make already implemented?  (Because they didn't think of it is not the answer.)

    * Will the change remove an implied feature?

    *  How will the change affect existing clients?



3.  Don't be afraid to delegate.  Create a sub-team of one or more to review  **every** PR. It's always good to have a different viewpoint.  Create a sub-team for every major milestone



4. Remove patch releases 4.0.1-4.0.4 mostly for appearances, and with the release of 4.1.0 they are unecessary.  Too many patch releases in such a short time can hurt the Ampache image.  Change 4.1.0 to pre-release for awhile for the same reason. This will tend to limit a buggy  release to the diehard Ampache patriots.   All future releases should at first be pre-releases for this reason.



5.  Make more use of the project space.  It is public and can be used to inform the public of timelines, goals and mileposts.  Including timelines for retiring versions.



6. IMHO I think that having a companion client would do much to improve Ampache's popularity.  I think most of the popular multimedia platforms provide their own client.  Yes an increasing number of clients exist for Ampache but provide only a limited number of features. A companion client should exemplify the full  power of the Ampache server.



The above is my attempt to inject the appearance of professionalism into an open source unfunded project.  And hopefully attract the interest of additional contributors.



Also, if the team members have the discipline to follow through with the above suggestions, I'm sure they will discover that their skills as a developer will significantly improve.


## Description

See some artwork in webpage.
Note that with my other client, DSub, artwork is shown.

<!-- Before submitting a feature request, make sure to search to see if it's already been suggested.

Please be as descriptive as you can be about your feature. No request is too big or too small and if it make sense, there is a good chance it will be approved and make it into Ampache. However, there is no guarantee on the time-frame.

The quickest way for a feature to make it into Ampache, is for you to submit a pull request yourself! -->

## Describe what you don't like about Ampache, or what it is missing
I wonder if it is not possible to write the play counter into the id3tag of the file.
## Describe how you would like the feature to work**
After playing the song the playcount will be increased and written into the id3tag

## Description

### Describe the bug
<!-- Explain in detail what is happening. -->
I cannot edit a smart playlist or search songs. Search albums, artists and playlists are not affected.  Not sure if it is my configuration or a general error. Tried with Firefox, Chrome and Edge.
### To reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to 'Smart Playlists'
2. Click on 'any existing smart playlist'
3. Scroll down to 'rules'
4. No existing rules are show and add rule button doesn't do anything.

### Expected behavior
<!-- What you believe should have happened -->
Should see existing rules and have the ability to delete and add more.

### Screenshots
<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->

## Description

### Describe the bug
With "Infinite Scroll" option On - one does not get the full list of albums when getting back from Album detail page.

Pages: Off
Infinite Scroll: On
Alphabet: Off
Grid: On

### To reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to 'Albums', enable "Infinite Scroll"
2. Scroll to the end of the page few times to get few more batches of albums.
3. Click on one of the last albums
4. Click on Albums in navigation panel
5. Click on Browse library
6. Error - you don't get the full list of albums but somehow limited selection

### Expected behavior
There should be full list of albums loaded when user clicks on Browse library.


## Environment

* Ampache version: 4.0.4


In the wiki conflict seems to exist between the initial description of 'stat' and the description of the 'filter' parameter.  Filter can be null vs filter not optional.

Shouldn't the filter type be added to the result, especially if the 'random' type was selected?

From log:

2019-12-24 23:58:02 [xxx] (dba.class) -> Error_query SQL: SELECT DISTINCT(`album`) as `id`, MAX(`song`.`addition_time`) AS `real_atime` FROM `song` AND `catalog` = '7' GROUP BY `song`.`album` ORDER BY `real_atime` DESC LIMIT 500
2019-12-24 23:58:02 [xxx] (dba.class) -> Error_query MSG: ["42000",1064,"You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near 'AND `catalog` = '7' GROUP BY `song`.`album` ORDER BY `real_atime` DESC LIMIT 500' at line 1"]


## Description
