Hi,

I'm trying to set up this menu in my project.
I tested the example and it works but when I try to reproduce it in my project, I have an error when I slide to open the menu.

    Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[UICustomObject panToPresentAction:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x1c40193d0'

I think I forgot something but I don't know what..

Can you help me please ? :)
Hey! I am trying to use this library as sideMenu. Like side tab bar however I am struggling with it. How would you implement lets say 2 buttons in menu and then present viewcontrollers accordingly? Since this library is made using unwind segues, I do not know much about them only that it basically makes the initial viewcontroller as initial viewcontroller.

fix  bugs:

1. the menuView is kindof UIScrollerView,gesture conflict.

2. pan to dismiss,but cancel will never responds tap to dismiss.
add  Objective-C  version and fix two bugs in OC version only : 

1. pan to dismiss but cancel,then you can't tap to dismiss.

2. if menuView is kindof UIScrollerView,the presented menuView can't respond to the pan gesture.


I like the custom transition animation, so I read your code carefully and write the OC version. There are several differences between OC version and swift version:

1. the FlowingMenuDelegate file.
2. the shapeLayer's control points.

But the OC version has a little shortage :  at the end of presentation,the shapeLayer can't animate using physical spring. I hope someone can resolve this problem.
Is it possible to make i open from right with right swipe gesture?
When using a UIVisualEffectView (like blur) there are some artifacts during loading. This happens with a default UIImage from xcassets with a default Visual Effect View with Blur from the storyboard object library.
