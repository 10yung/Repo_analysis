When the view has webview, after pressing the command + s, will crash, and no prompt message.
(Injection does not work with Whole Module Optimization.
There are also restrictions on characters allowed in paths.
All paths are also case sensitive is another thing to check.)
Hello, do you still support dynamic debugging of storyboard (without compiling) and opening the color version? I downloaded it from appstore

Does the appstrore version also support two features?

The tool fails when the path of a file doesn't have the correct capitalization or when it has spaces. This is a problem, as the plugin seems to have a bug where it mixes up the capitalization.

It would be great if these things were fixed, I imagine it's something quick like adding quotes around some shell commands. After all, many projects do have spaces in their project names, and the tool seems to get mixed up in terms of capitalization.
Hi, I'm using XCode 10.1

I had hit #274 and so I turned off test coverage in the scheme.

Now, I'm hitting this:  

```
游눌 *** Compiling /Users/dford/git/myproject/Classes/Controllers/AppUpdateViewController.m ***
游눌 Loading .dylib - Ignore any duplicate class warning...

```

So I tried turning off coverage in the linker settings, to no avail.  Any idea how to work past this issue?

I have folder structure as following in my app : 
Base/privateFolder/header.h
Base/AppFolder/Appcode.m

In the Appcode.m i am calling the #import "header.h" .The plugin is not able to find the header.h file and recompilation fails.If i keep the .h file in the same folder as Appcode.m it is able to find it but this is not possible as i have a well structured huge code base .
How could i overcome this issue?
