I would be interested in helping this but need to know current status.


As libuv-powered green scheduling is moving out of rust stdlib, we should start depending on e.g. [green.rs](https://github.com/alexcrichton/green-rs) to keep up with the original design of zmq.rs.



As noted in zmq documentation, multiple parts of one message should either all arrive or none. zmq.rs lacks this.
