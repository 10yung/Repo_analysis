Currently, Webpack fails at correctly compiling Vega-Lite's reference to fast-json-stable-stringify which is an ES6 import statement of a CommonJS module.

Pending a more thorough investigation/overhaul of our build system, we will need to dig into node_modules/vega-lite/src/util.ts and replace the import with an old-style CommonJS require:

const stableStringify = require('fast-json-stable-stringify');
Note that http://vega.github.io/lyra/ has been indexed by google, and shows up as "vega lyra" in the top few hits.

I cannot use this software for a project I'm working on unless it is using an appropriate license, and currently you don't have a license declared.

* Open an example visualization, e.g. http://idl.cs.washington.edu/projects/lyra/app/#?example=playfair
* Click New pipeline
* The second existing pipeline is overwritten by the newly created one
* Further new pipelines overwrite other existing pipelines sequentially
Aside from `Scene` which is different (see #434), all LyraMarks add `_id` and `_parent` to their Vega types, with the exception of Group which also has `_manualLayout`. Can we make LyraMark more general?

See: https://github.com/vega/lyra/pull/427#discussion_r263620627 
Walkthroughs and hints are unfinished in lyra2, and have been ported over in their unfinished state to lyra2019. Todo: consider revisiting these once main features are working.

e.g.
https://github.com/vega/lyra/pull/427#pullrequestreview-215379210
https://github.com/vega/lyra/pull/427/files/38e81ece2ea872a419517aaaffd52561df175457..556b43b19e193569c64308e94375c5cd6f3ba78e#diff-2985f62f23a0c8dab098f32f9c8d5045
Lyra currently implements Scene as a class of mark, but this mark type doesn't exist in Vega. 
Todo: Investigate its usage and consider implementing it as a special instance of a Group mark instead.

- Can't get lyra up and running

**Expected Behavior**

I see lyra up and running.

**Actual Behavior**
I see lot of errors.

1. Server does not respond to localhost from outside, so had to change, package.json file, by adding ` --host 0.0.0.0` to `npm start` script i.e.
`"start": "webpack-dev-server --mode=development --host 0.0.0.0 --devtool=cheap-source-map --inline --hot --progress"`

2. Plenty of errors in the logs -
```

And this is all I see on the UI -

**Steps to reproduce behavior**
```
FROM node 

COPY lyra_src_code /usr/src/lyra_src_code

WORKDIR /usr/src/lyra_src_code

EXPOSE 8080

```

And started the container by - 

` docker container run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 --name lyra lyra /bin/bash` followed by
`npm start`

This PR includes some changes to Guides as well since the previous PR was already merged. The primary goal of this PR is to:

- explore places where Guide changes affect in bindChannel
- convert files to TS where necessary
- update to es6 syntax with imports, consts, etc where possible
- update to immutable record syntax with typing

`sudo:false` is not recommended  anymore https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-11-19-required-linux-infrastructure-migration
