Feature request

## Version Info

- Version of Majestic: 1.6.1
- Version of Jest: 24.9.0
- Version of Node: 8.9.4
- Operating System: Mac OS X

## Reproduction Repo

I want to use this testing tool in my company, But someone ask me that change majestic logo in sidebar. I thought that change logo option is useful for company test server. Could I pull request change logo using majestic option? 

Thank you.
While I have VSCode installed, I use IntelliJ/WebStorm for development.

IntelliJ supports being called [from the command line](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-the-ide-features-from-command-line.html), and will magically handle figuring out if it needs to open a new project or not, if it's already open.

i.e, from `WSL` I can do:

```
g-rath@CINDY:/c/Users/G-Rath$ idea64.exe "C:\Users\G-Rath\workspace\projects-personal\strongly-typed-event-emitter\test\src\index.spec.ts"
```
And it opens brings that project into focus, opening that file. (i.e when I've got multiple projects open, and it's in the background).

It would be cool if Majestic supported that - I'd be happy to be involved in a PR, but am pretty busy for the next couple of weeks so couldn't do it all by myself.

You could test for an `.idea` folder, or `.iml` file to determine if a folder should be opened using VSCode or IntelliJ.

## Is this a bug report or a feature request?

Feature request? I need debug to print out a statement of which files are triggering the test runs and persist the output.

## Version Info

- Version of Majestic: v1.6.0
- Version of Jest: 24.1.0
- Version of Node: 12.10.0
- Operating System: macOS 10.14.6

## Reproduction Repo

First of all: Majestic is amazing. But watch mode doesn't actually watch. It's just running over and over nonstop. I think my tests are outputting files, which is triggering another test run. We have jest.json print out test results for our build process and also code coverage reports. I tried excluding them but it's not helping.

I need insight into what files are triggering test runs so I can exclude them, but Majestic clears the terminal screen when it reloads. Even in --debug mode. And I don't think it's displaying that information as far as I can tell.

## Is this a bug report or a feature request?

Bug: Majestic has correctly detected a failing test, however it fails to display which test is failing and the detail about it in the UI.

## Version Info

- Version of Majestic: v1.6.0
- Version of Jest: 24.9.0
- Version of Node: v10.16.3
- Operating System: Windows 10x64

## Reproduction Repo
I can't currently provide an example rep, but I can probably provide more debugging info.

## Feature request

When libraries like `react-testing-libary` (that emulates user activity) is used It would be useful to view what is going on on the screen

```
function Counter(){
  const [state, setState] = useState({value: 0})
  return (
         <div>
                 <span>{state.value}</span>
                 <button onClick={() => setState(state => ({value: state.value + 1}))}>
                     increase
                 </button>
          </div>
   )
}

it('counter test', async () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<Counter />)
  const button = getByText('increase')
  fireEvent.click(button)
  fireEvent.click(button)
  fireEvent.click(button)
})
```
Majestic could show current `document` so It would be possible to see how counter is working in the test.

Minor bug in logging

## Version Info

- Version of Majestic: 1.6
- Version of Jest: 24.9
- Version of Node: 12.9.1
- Operating System: Linux Dev 4.9.0-9-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.168-1+deb9u4 (2019-07-19) x86_64 GNU/Linux

## Reproduction Repo

Reported every time Majestic is executed.

## Issue Details

I just tested Majestic to try it out and it reports the following on the console after running `npx majestic`:

```
Majestic v1.6.0 is running at http://localhost:4000
```

This is not technically correct. It is listening on all IP addresses on the system, not just localhost.

Three possible fixes:

* Simple report http://0.0.0.0:4000
* Report the actual IP addresses that Majestic is listening on.
* Add an IP address config option.

When I first ran the command I went back to the docs to find out how to bind it to all IP addresses because of the reported `localhost` binding. After reading the docs and not seeing a `server` or `ip address` config, I tried it in the browser and it worked.

Bug

## Version Info

- Version of Majestic: 1.6.0
- Version of Jest: ^24.8.0
- Version of Node: 10.16.0
- Operating System: macOS Mojave 10.14.3

## Reproduction Repo

As this is quite a simple bug, I did not create a specific repository with test codes to reproduce it. Basically, all it needs to be done is to include a CSS rule `word-break: break-all` in the component responsible for rendering the test file full path.
In this case, when the path is too big, the action buttons are not displayed.

## Without the CSS rule

## With CSS rule (edited using `Inspect` directly)

First off, thanks for a kick ass test runner.  

It would be nice to have a way to expand/collapse the file explorer in the left.  

I read that there's a way to update snapshots for an individual test - how do I do this? I can't seem to find a button anywhere in the UI?

I'm hoping to use this to replace my dependance on WallabyJS as this UI is really nice. Well done :)
Is there a setting for root dir?

How to change the display start directory, I hope to start from `tests`.
