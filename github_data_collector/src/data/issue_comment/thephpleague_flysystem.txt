#### Summary

sftp is breaking after upgrading to php 7.4

#### How to reproduce

$directory = 'ShippingNotifications';
$fs = Flysystem::connection('sftp');
$contents = $fs->listContents($directory,true);

### Feature Request

The way the documentation is built right now, it's hard to see which is the method's return value and which are the method's parameters.

Quite frankly, the return value looks like another parameter.

I think that everyone would benefit from this to be updated. 
### Question

I cannot find this in the docs, nor find this question raised anywhere else yet. I'm putting together some live tests for a driver, and it is throwing up questions like this.

A request to delete a directory - `deleteDir()` - that does not exist - what should the driver do? There is no API method to check if a directory exists, and there is no defined behavior when using `has()` when pointing at a file.

The `deleteDir()` method defines a boolean return, but does not state what that return value means. Should it return `false` if the directory does not exist? Then `true` if if did exist and was deleted? What about if it did exist but could not be deleted? Or surely if the directory does not exist in the first place, then asking for it to be deleted is just confirming that the state is what has been requested, so should return `true`? Then when should `false` *ever* be used? This method also does not define any exceptions that is expected to be thrown.

My current assumption is:

* If the directory exists, then delete it (recursively). Return `true`.
* If the directory does not exist, then job is already a good 'un. Return `true`.
* If the underlying driver library fails to delete anything, then it will be throwing an exception. My guess is that the Omnipay driver should not try to handle that.
* `false` is never actually returned. It works, or is already done, or an exception was thrown.

But that's just my assumption. Frameworks such as Laravel may have made different assumptions (and this, I believe, is where I am actually running into problems in a project).
### When executing `getMimeType` of an `m3u8` file 'text/plain' is returned.

The correct mimetype should be `'application/x-mpegURL'`  can it be corrected?

Maybe adding `text/plain` to the "not so sure" in_array check. 

```php
// League\Flysystem\Adapter\Local.php:322  getMimetype
if (in_array($mimetype, ['application/octet-stream', 'inode/x-empty', 'application/x-empty'])) {
``` 

Reproduce with:
php php-cs-fixer --rules=native_function_invocation fix ./ --allow-risky=yes
(php-cs-fixer from : https://cs.symfony.com/)

Listing files can be very slow. `NOOP` command is enough in most cases and it is very fast.
NOOP reference - http://ftpguide.com/NOOP.htm

I profiled my code by blackfire and that change increased speed 10 times. Usage of `ftp_rawlist` is bottleneck.
A PR of what I proposed in #1051 . The current problem is that if one naively changes `'public' => 0755` to `'public' => 1755` the result is not `rwxr-xr-t` but `-wx-ws-wt` (`03333`).

This adds a utility function that converts mode strings to correct represntations.

- `Mode::mode(0755)` and `Mode::mode(1755)` just passes it through.
- `Mode::mode('0755')` and `Mode::mode('1755')` assumes the chars to be octets and sets mode to `rwxr-xr-x` and `rwxr-xr-t` respectively - that works according to naive scenario. `Mode::mode('01755')` works as well.
- `Mode::mode('rwxr-xr-x')` sets mode to `rwxr-xr-x`. Adding `d` or placing guid, suid and sticky bits also work as expected, both with executable bit on or off.

Each of the features described above is tested as well.

I went ahead and used the function in `Local` adapter. That's the purpose of this PR - to provide the local adapter with a default that's safe to copy and edit without running into unexpected results.

<!-- Fill in the relevant information below to help triage your issue. -->

|    Q        |   A
|------------ | ------
| BC Break    | yes
| Version     | 1.0.55

#### Summary

Realization of `Local::getVisibility()` was changed in bafc949bb7f8070a32f41e2ceef0f2644948a1f6 and new realization is not compatible with previous:

- `getVisibility()` may return umask instead of `AdapterInterface::VISIBILITY_*` => in this case `FilesystemInterface::getVisibility()` will also return umask
- Files which were `public` in previous (1.0.53) version are `private` in 1.0.55 (windows/ubuntu)


#### How to reproduce

Update from `1.0.53` to `1.0.55`

### Question

There are no docs available on how to use `Config` (https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem/blob/master/src/Config.php). What parameters do the array expect?
