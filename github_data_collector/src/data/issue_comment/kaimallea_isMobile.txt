I've added support for iOS Universal User Agent tag, so please review and let me know - or just add it, please. :)
Hi, v1 builds to cjs and still includes the `const` keyword. This means anyone installing this library via npm and running it in the browser cannot support <=ie10 and <=safari 9. I haven't used parcel before but I imagine you just need to tweak the settings to babelify `const` to `var`.

This worked in v0.
I would expect these to return true when on a MacBook or Windows laptop respectively?
Those aren't mobile devices of course, but what defines a 'device' being mobile than?
yarn has no 'install' command
For iPad on iOS 13 the term `iPad` no longer appears in the `user-agent`. The user agent for iPad on iOS 13 is this:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko)
```

The solution to check for iPad on iOS is:

```js
let isIOS = /iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(navigator.platform) ||
(navigator.platform === 'MacIntel' && navigator.maxTouchPoints > 1);
```

Reference to solution here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/58064481/3787150

Using ES6 `import` is needed to run as a function to work.

Ex: 
```js
import React from 'react';
import isMobile from 'ismobilejs';

const Navbar = () => {
  const navbarColllapseTarget = isMobile().phone ? '#nav-search-user' : '';
  return (...);
}

export default Navbar;
```

This works: `isMobile().phone`
This does not: `isMobile.phone`

In documentation is specified to use `isMobile` as an _Object_. In a previous project, I used as an _Object_. 

Maybe I'm doing something wrong, I don't know.


Per #96, clarify the usage with better examples for the most common use cases.

- [ ] Drop-in CDN link with IIFE that creates a global `isMobile` object with results
- [ ] CommonJS Interp
- [ ] ESModule
- [ ] Webpack
