Includes basic SPM Package.swift improvements
Are there any plans for supporting Carthage? I don't really want to add Pods to my project, and the Swift Package Manager option is currently failing with:

```
 ÔÅº ~ swift package generate-xcodeproj

'OnboardingReactiveSwift' /Users/pcferreira/Projects/OnboardingReactiveSwift: error: product dependency 'Changeset' not found
```
I can't figure out how to make the compiler happy when trying to express something like this:

```swift
public protocol ChangesetApplying: class {
    associatedtype T
    func apply(changeset: Changeset<T>)
}
```

The above will complain that _Type 'Self.T' does not conform to protocol 'Collection'_.

Changing it to `associatedtype T: Collection` yields a different error: _Type 'Self.T.Iterator.Element' does not conform to protocol 'Equatable'_.

Changing it to `associatedtype T: Collection where T.Iterator.Element: Equatable, T.IndexDistance == Int` yields the error _'where' clause cannot be attached to an associated type declaration_, which appears to be the subject of [SE-0142](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0142-associated-types-constraints.md).

Any ideas?
