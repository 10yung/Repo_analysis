This displays the svg properly in the playground, but it doesnt display properly when I use it in my nodejs application
Hi guys, 

Before asking here I tried to scan the docs (even with custom search) but haven't found details about absolute and relative positioning. Actually I found these properties floating on the web, reason I'm even more confused about their usage and existence. Saw them in the examples too, but there are no comments or any sort of hint about their nature.

Right now I applied `relativePosition` to an image as background so I can put text above it, but I get the same effect with `absolutePosition` which makes me wonder, what is the actual difference between the two, are they relative to what?

Would really appreciate your help on understanding the above,
Thanks!
Hello. I had the chance to test pdfmake methods in iOS Safari and here is what I've found:

`pdfMake.createPdf(docDefinition).download();`

- In desktop FireFox it does exactly what is says; triggers download box.
- In iOS Safari it opens a new tab and loads the PDF perfectly.

`pdfMake.createPdf(docDefinition).open();`

- In desktop FireFox it triggers the built-in popup blocker. You must allow it manually.
- In iOS Safari it does nothing because iOS Safari comes has default popup blocker setting turned on. You must disable it manually.

`pdfMake.createPdf(docDefinition).print();`

- In desktop FireFox it triggers the built-in popup blocker. You must allow it manually.
- In iOS Safari it does nothing because iOS Safari comes has default popup blocker setting turned on. You must disable it manually.

```
const pdfDocGenerator = pdfMake.createPdf(docDefinition);
pdfDocGenerator.getDataUrl((dataUrl) => {
	const targetElement = document.querySelector('#iframeContainer');
	const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
	iframe.src = dataUrl;
	targetElement.appendChild(iframe);
});
```

- In desktop FireFox it works perfectly.
- In iOS Safari it seems to only show the first page of PDF document. It appears IOS Safari does not yet support this?

[See Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23663784)

**Conclusion so far**

If you wish to write a Javascript app that works in both Safari and FireFox, the following method is your best bet so far.

`pdfMake.createPdf(docDefinition).download();`

- In desktop FireFox it does exactly what is says; triggers download box.
- In iOS Safari it opens a new tab and loads the PDF perfectly.

This is not an issue as much as it is a feature request:
it would be great if one of the list types had checkboxes (open squares) or even customizable types(from an image?).
I only found information regarding how to create dash line, afaict it's not possible to create a double line.

This will be great and I presume not very hard to implement (not sure though).
```
hLineStyle: function (i, node) {
 if (i === 0 || i === node.table.body.length) {
  return null;
 }
  return {double: true };
},
```

or much more general and flexible:
```
return { multi: {sizes: [1, 2, 1], spaces: [2, 1]}
```

Something like:

With last version of pdfmake 0.1.62, webpack print this warning when compiling: 
```
WARNING: We noticed you're using the `useBuiltIns` option without declaring a core-js version. Currently, we assume version 2.x when no version is passed. Since this default version will likely change in future versions of Babel, we recommend explicitly setting the core-js version you are using via the `corejs` option.
```

I found useBuiltIns option in webpack.config.js.

Not sure but it seems webpack need a core-js module version fixed in the dependencies ...
I want to align watermark to the left side of my page. The ask is to place a text vertically in header/footer which is currently not supported by pdf make. As a workaround i am able to achieve this using watermark and rotating the text to an angle of 270. However, the text is coming in the center. I want to place it in lower left bottom of the page.

watermark: { text: 'Licensed to rupali', angle: 270,fontSize: 12, color:'#e8eae', alignment:'left',margin:[0,0,24,0]}

Please suggest the same.
```javascript
var dd = {
    content: {
        table: {
            dontBreakRows: true,
            body: [
                [{ text: "first line\nsecond line", rowSpan: 2, fillColor: "lightgrey" }],
                [null],
            ],
        }
    }
}
```

Using patterns in SVG works as expected when importing the unminified version of pdfmake (pdfmake/build/pdfmake.js). But they render as solid black when either importing pdfmake.min.js or minimizing the original with Angular. I haven't noticed any other discrepancies between

Result with unminified version:

Code used to generate both results:

const pdfDoc = {
  content: [
    {
      svg: `
        <svg id="svg" viewBox="0 0 600 600">

              <path d="M0,30 30,0 30,15 15,30 z" fill="#00cc66" />
            </pattern>

        </svg>
      `,
      width: 200
    }
  ]
};
const pdf = pdfMake.createPdf(pdfDoc);

pdf.open();
```
Hello team, 

Is it possible to change the order of a toc to a alphanumerical order ? 

Best regards,
