Hi,
Have you ever used a RPi4 as a host for a RiP3 as the target. In this case for me the makefile does not build the kernel. It just seems to silently fail.

Everything works fine for me if I use an X64 machine as the host.

Thanks 

Regards
  Tim.
Hi, @andre-richter do you mind if I translate your project to Chinese? I think this is worth spreading.
- [x] To the JTAG fritzing wiring image, add a red dot indicating the LED on the Olimex HW for easier orientation
- [ ] OpenOCD spews lots of errors while debugging. Check if they are harmless or can be fixed.
- [ ] CPSR in GDB seems to show wrong `EL`. Maybe other fields as well?
- [ ] Build GDB from source in the Docker container to be more bleeding edge regarding Rust support?
- [x] The real-life wiring image has been flipped to horizontal from originally being vertical, in order to save space. It looks distored now. Take a new "native" horizontal version?
- [x] Add `additional resources` section to end of README with links for using/learning GDB.
- [x] Check if it works with JLink @berkus

Tutorial still lives in branch `JTAG`

CC @naotaco if you like to help.
I may be jumping the gun a little bit with this question.... 

Is there any special initialization code (raspi3_boot/etc) needed to enable interrupt handling outside of setting a particular IRQ enable bit in one of the 3 interrupt  enable registers ( 0x7E00_B210, 214, 218)?

I'm trying to setup a DMA transfer that generates an IRQ when it finishes (by providing DMA Channel 0 with a control block that has INTEN bit set and enabling Irq 16 in IRQ Enable_1 register) but the handler I provide in the current_elx_irq vector never gets called. 

I seem to be out of ideas. Any thoughts?

Thanks in advance.
