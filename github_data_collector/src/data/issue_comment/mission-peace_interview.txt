Hi, sorry to spam your github. Thanks for your videos and code. They're very helpful. 
```    public int lcsDynamic(char str1[],char str2[]){
    ...
   deleted code
    ...
                else
                {
                    temp[i][j] = Math.max(temp[i][j-1],temp[i-1][j]);
                }
                if(temp[i][j] > max){
                    max = temp[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        return max;
    
    }
```

In your video, you said that the lower right of the matrix should always be the max. That makes sense to me, so I was curious why you used this max variable to track the max?
hi 
wاen i run this cod ، It takes about 0.7 seconds to transmit and display information to me
My question is ، is there a way to get this information faster than this time?

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

page = requests.get('https://www.bls.gov/ces/')
soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content,'html.parser')
locator = 'div h4 a' 
tag = soup.select_one(locator)
tag_s = tag.attrs['title']
print(tag_s)
hi
I'm a beginner in Python And now I'm working on selenium
There is a website that when I click (ctrl + shift + i) on it to see the details of the objects shows the whole page as an object. Is it possible to identify the objects?

There is a video in the zip file that shows what is happening, when I want to select one of the web page objects, the objects cannot be selected

thank you

Initializing 0th index
As we are already copying the max value in the array T during regular iterations, another iteration to find the max value is unnecessary!

Added python solutions of few Leetcode questions on binary trees, will be adding more solutions!!
this looks great! most clear answer ever.
but, this does not looks a "binary" search - the loop looks still a linear search, from 0 - len().
I guess instead of every time -1 or +1 on failure, use /2 to jump back or forth. only that will be the binary search?

I cannot come up with an example that should update the root reference.
(i.e. I think the root will not change when we are in this situation, so we do not need to update the root reference.)
Are there any people thinking this is a necessary operation and can give an example of why this is operation is necessary?
