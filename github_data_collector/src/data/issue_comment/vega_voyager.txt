Hi --

Currently the React being used in this package does not support the newer 16 React.

Is there a roadmap to getting this updated to support the newer React? So that It can be used in newer applications

When using the latest development version of voyager 2 (2.0.0-alpha.24) and embedding into a react application as advised in the readme, I am finding the voyager chart to be very unresponsive. I can drag but dropping does not work, and if I click any button in the data sidebar, nothing happens.
Hello,
I am trying to deploy voyager on Ubuntu server, but I am experiencing issue when I run "yarn build". It is always crashing and I must reboot the server.

Steps of deployment are:
- git clone https://github.com/vega/voyager.git voyager
- cd voyager
- yarn
- yarn build

Dependencie:
yarn version 1.19.0
npm version 6.4.1
nodejs version v8.10.0
Ubuntu server 18.0.4 LTD

Please help.

### Problem

I tried to build from the `master` branch today and saw an error that says 

```
Node Sass does not yet support your current environment: OS X 64-bit with Unsupported runtime
``` 

<img width="1052" alt="Screen Shot 2019-06-19 at 2 21 21 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/822034/59804003-09e6f900-92a2-11e9-825d-c65392948d06.png">

I've tried building using `node v12.4.0` and `node v10.16.0` and the same error persists.

The error message mentioned node-sass version so I went and checked which node-sass version I was using. When I do a fresh clean clone of voyager and run `yarn install`, in the `/node_modules` folder I get `node-sass v4.5.3`. This is the minimal version required by voyager's `package.json`, but it only supports till node v8 https://github.com/sass/node-sass/releases/tag/v4.5.3


### Solution

Requiring the latest version of `node-sass` (`v4.12.0` as of today) solves my problem. (I find this solution a bit surprising though because I thought `yarn install` would install the latest `v4.x.x` version for me, but that wasn't the case)



### Sanity checks:
- [x] Make your pull request atomic, fixing one issue at a time unless there are many relevant issues that cannot be decoupled.
- [x] Make lint and test pass. (Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test`.)
- [x] Make sure you have rebased to the latest `master`.
- [x] Provide a concise title so that we can just copy it to our release note.
  - Use imperative mood and present tense.
  - Mention relevant issues. (e.g., `#1`)


When I doing simple example from tutorial.
`
import {AfterViewInit, Component} from '@angular/core';
import {CreateVoyager} from "datavoyager";

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent implements AfterViewInit {

  constructor() {
  }
  ngAfterViewInit() {
    const container = document.getElementById('voyager-embed');
    const config = undefined;
    const data: any = {
      'values': [
        { 'fieldA': 'A', 'fieldB': 28 },
        { 'fieldA': 'B', 'fieldB': 55 }
      ]
    };
    CreateVoyager(container, config, data);
  }
}
`

I getting such output:
`ERROR in node_modules/vega-lite/build/src/util.d.ts(78,16): error TS2344: Type 'keyof T' does not satisfy the constraint 'string'.
  Type 'string | number | symbol' is not assignable to type 'string'.

Common export date formats cause failure.
Message is "Cannot read property 'Close' of undefined".
I understand this is simplistic attempts at import using standard JS.

May I suggest an CSV parser with 4000+ stars?

Add a dataset from a URL, https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Bondifrench/978f78f24c638546356af7610487c786/raw/28f0ef243f668630dfe676658b6d611d9170425c/InDDHeader.csv

Use it for some explorartion

Click Change (dataset), only the Vega samples appear, not the current dataset.
Refresh the window, the dataset has vanished. 
find . | grep .csv finds no data on the server

So, is all data temporary via this dialog/process? Perhaps I am missing something,

Perhaps move the field controls around 10 pixels to the right? Currently, scrollbar on fields occludes plus sign.

Debian Stretch
From 2.0.0-alpha.24
yarn test used 2 GB of memory to run, specifically at 

NODE_ENV=test node scripts/jest-ui.js

Is this expected? Seems very high for a test, maybe I just need a larger server to run all tests?

- [X ] Provide an example spec in JSON and, if applicable, screenshots or GIF videos (e.g., using https://www.cockos.com/licecap/)

Run:
NODE_ENV=test node scripts/jest-ui.js

After 30-60 seconds, over 2 GB of memory is in use by the test.

Error thrown:
FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
I cloned and checked out tag `v2.0.0-alpha.24` and ran `yarn && yarn build` on Node v10.9.0 and had a build error `v8::Object’ has no member named ‘ForceSet`.

It builds under Node v8.11.4 so I'm assuming the officially supported version of Node is 8.

That should be mentioned in the README.

I'm running Ubuntu bionic.
