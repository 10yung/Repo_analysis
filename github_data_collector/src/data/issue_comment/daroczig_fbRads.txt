I think it would be useful for fbad_request() to be exported.  This will aid in debugging, and offer some flexibility in using endpoints of the API that are not supported by the package (e.g., ad_studies).

It's one line of code:  adding an @export statement before the function in fb_init.R, and using document() to update the NAMESPACE.  With appropriate permissions, I can push a new branch and then make a pull request.

Thanks.
Im using the fbad_list_ad function to get the active ads of a list of adsets ids, but for some reason I get an error of duplicate rownames. This only happens when getting the ads of different adsets at the same time. 

testads <- fbad_list_ad(id = c("23842658373830776","23842658373930776","23842697638530776"), statuses = "ACTIVE", fields = c("campaign_id", "adset_id", "name", "creative"))
Error in `row.names<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, value = value) : 
  duplicate 'row.names' are not allowed
In addition: Warning message:
non-unique values when setting 'row.names': ‘1’, ‘2’ 

Any idea on how to solve it? Thanks and sorry for the trouble!


Hi,

I have access to an ad account with a lot going on (we've got hundreds of fb ads and thus hundreds of ad creatives).  After running fbad_read_creative(), I'm getting only 50 results?  I initialized our main ad account which definitely has a lot of ads associated with it.  Is there a kind of default where it only pulls the last month's newest creatives or something?  I went through the Marketing API documentation, but I didn't see any limits mentioned on the Read section of the creatives portion.

I might be unpacking it wrong.  I'm fairly new at this entire thing, and I'm using unlist and matrix to turn the results into a data frame.

Thanks.
I am using the command
reachestimate - v2.9:

```
> esti <- fbad_reachestimate(targeting_spec = targeting_spec, currency = "EUR", optimize_for = "REACH" )
> esti
$users
[1] 12000000
```

previously the call returned much more information.
Also return data looks different in this post:

There is a problem with `campaign_id` in the function `fbad_create_ad`. In the version available on CRAN, you had `campaign_id` as an argument. But in the latest GitHub version, you don't. I think it might be because it's deprecated. Anyhow, not having `campaign_id` as an argument is causing problems. I get an error that says:

```r
Error in missing(campaign_id) : 'missing' can only be used for arguments
```

I might try to do a fix and make a pull request. 
Facebook developed a new ad format. It creates leads from fb users, can the package read those leads?
