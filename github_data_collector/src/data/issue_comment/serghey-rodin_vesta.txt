Two years ago there was a ticket for this, and since then the situation has not changed so much. So this is an abandoned project?

Previously I have similar issue, I decided it's a bug of my CentOS. I reinstalled Linux completely, installed VestaCP from scratch. Now I have the same issue.

How my config file looks:

Also, have some temporary sed files in conf folder. Datestamp is CURRENT.

Also, tried to rebuild web domains, got this:

```
[root@localhost web]# v-rebuild-web-domains admin
/usr/local/vesta/data/templates/web/httpd//phpfcgid.sh: line 18: /home/admin/web/dating.com/public_html/admin/web/dating.com/cgi-bin/fcgi-starter: No such file or directory

Error: httpd restart failed
[root@localhost web]# 
```

As I see, path like "/home/admin/web/minidevices.info/public_html/admin/web/minidevices.info/cgi-bin/fcgi-starter" doesn't make sense, so may be there is really parsing error.

After adding some debug lines, I've got this

```
[root@localhost web]# v-rebuild-web-domains admin

homedir variable is EMPTY.

Many conf files damaged and are not regenerating:

P.S. Please don't suggest any solutions like "reinstall Linux", "Reinstall VestaCP", "Check your router".


I ran `bash vst-install.sh --nginx no --apache no --phpfpm no --named yes --remi yes --vsftpd no --proftpd no --iptables no --fail2ban no --quota no --exim no --dovecot no --spamassassin no --clamav no --softaculous no --mysql no --postgresql no` in container with minimal Ubuntu 18.04 to use it _only_ as a DNS slave.

But nginx repos were added, nginx, roundcube etc. packages were installed. They are not needed and were explicitly disable by cli arguements.
I suggest you add this option for Letsencrypt and Cloudflare with SSL
https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/214820528-Validating-a-Let-s-Encrypt-Certificate-on-a-Site-Already-Active-on-Cloudflare
Recently I got this error, last month this error never show up
`SSL_do_handshake() failed (SSL: error:1408F10B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version number) while SSL handshaking to upstream`
but it only affect my apache PHP program that stores in public_html. All other program using NodeJS not affected and still accessible using HTTPS.
### Operating System (OS/VERSION):

Debian 9

### VestaCP Version:

0.9.8

### Installed Software (what you got with the installer):

MariaDB 10.4

### Steps to Reproduce:

Restore a user account via v-restore-user
All data is restored perfectly, but the authentication for the user is not created on the databases. This is likely due to the new MariaDB authentication changes https://mariadb.org/authentication-in-mariadb-10-4/
It looks like the restore script inserts the MD5 password into the MySQL tables directly and then grant access to the user. The mysql.user table is now a read-only view so it can't be used to set the password for the user.

What does work is the `GRANT ALL ON database.* TO user@"%" IDENTIFIED BY 'password' ` but I think the cleartext password is not stored anywhere.

What I did find is that instead of creating the blank user then setting a password you can instead do `CREATE USER user@"%" IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD "*MD5STRING"` and then the GRANT will work.

### Operating System (OS/VERSION):

Type here, e.g. Debian 9.11

### VestaCP Version:

Type here, e.g. 9.8 26

### Steps to Reproduce:

I can't write email address  in ftp username field on Remote backup section.
Error: invalid user format ::
