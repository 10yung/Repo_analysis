Thank you for the amazing and precise description of TLS 1.2.
This is my extra small addition to the project :)
Hi,

THE BEST site for SSL explanation. 

The experience will be even better if you can differentiate different parts the req/resp message hex parts.

I'm overriding site styles with below:

```
.record-data .string {
    background-color: lightsalmon;
}
.record-data .string:nth-child(even) {
    background-color: lightseagreen;
}
```

After which, the Hex dump will be even clear _(if required, you can add a toggle button)_:

Thanks.

It would be nice if we also have mutual authentication illustrated ðŸ˜ƒ

It would be very cool to have the corresponding `openssl -vvvv` lines at each step
