How to set the file name of the encrypted software to be different from that of the original software？？？
If my software is D:\1.exe

How to set up  the .crproj file  can let the new encrypted software in the original software (not subfolders), but the name of the new encrypted software changed to D:\2. exe????


If my  .crproj file  add       <protection id="rename"  />   then canot runing.
if del   <protection id="rename"  />  then all ok
what is then '<protection id="rename"  />' meaning???
why make bug ???
THX!
Hi,
I'm try to protect my console app file .EXE in NET CORE and I'm giving this error:

Can you help me to solve it?

Thank you.
I have prepare below configuration. It has two dll one is temp.dll which is related path and AbsolutePath.dll which is absolute path. ConfuserEx process both dll successfully but it copy only temp.dll to provided output directory D:\output and copy AbsolutePath.dll to where we below configuration file exist, AbsolutePath.dll should be copy to D:\output directory. Can you provide solution for this issue ?

Hi, I got the following error: 
An error occurred creating the configuration section handler for Settings: Could not load type 'XTEST.SettingsSection' from assembly . (C:\Users\XXX\Desktop\ToDelete\PROJECT_TEST\X\X\bin\Debug\Confused\XTEST.exe.config line 4

My configs 4th line is:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <configSections>
    <section name="Settings" type="XTEST.SettingsSection, XTEST" />

I use a *.exe.config file for configuration.

I tried starting from max to normal, but the same error I got 

Thanks advanced﻿ .
Sometimes it is necessary to provide a patch for obfuscated software. Having different obfuscation applied to patched version comparing with the released one effectively means the patched version cannot be deployed without replacing every obfuscated assembly.

This change makes it possible to provide a symbol map from a previous obfuscation and preserves the renames specified there.
When I press the Protect button I get a virus warning Trojan: Win32 / Fuerboos.A!Cl And Trojan: Win32 / Fuerboos.C!Cl from Windows Defender
And the program can not continue.
I'm using this on a project in which I've used [MahApps.Metro](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro) for styling. Some elements dissapear even when using the minimum encryption. Like the DataGrid headers are not visible

This is without using confuser

And this is with minimum level of encryption:

The problem happens irrespective of whether I'm using packer or not.

How to resolve this ?
Hello,

We've been using ConfuserEx to obfuscate our (WPF) applications before we deploy externally for a while now. Recently, we've encountered the need to build an application in the 64-bit platform to accommodate for higher memory usage. We've automated obfuscating as part of the build process using the settings defined below for our application. I decided to try to start disabling other protections one by one to see if I could get it to ever run and got lucky on the first try by disabling the anti dump protection. Do you have any idea why this protection would cause the application to crash? I even tried putting a try/catch around the main entry point but even that doesn't get hit to provide me an idea of what the underlying issue is.

  <rule pattern="true" preset="maximum" inherit="true">
    <protection id="anti debug" action="remove" />
    <protection id="ref proxy" action="remove" />
    <protection id="resources" action="remove" />
    <protection id="rename" action="remove" />
  </rule>

I have a program with mostly managed DLL's and one native DLL ( **System.Data.SQLite** ). I'm using the `Packer/Compressor` setting to pack all managed DLLs and exe file into a single exe. 

I'm deploying the native SQLite dll as a separate binary.

So my file structure looks like:
      - packed_file.exe
      - System.Data.SQLite.dll

It works fine on Windows 7, Windows 8.1, but on `Windows 10 ( Build 10240 )` ( I have just tested on this build of windows 10 on 2 separate laptops ) it gives the following error:

> System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Data.SQLite, Version=1.0.88.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=db937bc2d44ff139' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)
