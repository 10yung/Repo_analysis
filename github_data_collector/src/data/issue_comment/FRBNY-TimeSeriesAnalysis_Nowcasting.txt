Dear @brandynbok and @eric-qian ,

First of all, thank you for the code, which is very well written and documented!
I have a question about the likelihood in the interation of EM step . When I set the initial value of the parameter to a random number,the value of likelihood decrease with the interation of EM .
ooking forward to hearing more from you on this matter.
Thank you for your answer.

Dear @brandynbok and @eric-qian ,

Thank you for the code. It is very well written and documented!
I have a question regarding last the two plots in the example_dfm.m.
The second plot that plots the common factor uses the standardized smoothed value of all the variables on the y-axis but for the common component uses only the INDPRO variable. What is the reason for that?

Also, in the last plot. The project of common component onto PAYEMS and GDPC1. Shouldn't the common component be a lot smoother than the original data. 

Looking forward to hearing more from you on this matter. 
Thank you for your answer.

I have a question of updating of the  matrix C in the function EMstep:

after finished the iteration of EM step ,the matrix C just change a little and the coefficient of quartly variable do not change .I want to know that's why and how to deal with this problem .

Thank you and best regards,
