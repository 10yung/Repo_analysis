all examples are for exoplayer... is there an example/tutorial on how to use it standalone? 
if not, I will need to dig into your code
The PreviewTimeBar class makes a call to getDefaultScrubberColor but it seems like that method no longer exists in recent versions of ExoPlayer.
What is the size of each thumbnail so that it will fit in the preview, I tried to use this sample https://jwsupport.cdn.prismic.io/jwsupport/f39cd28a5474fcd4d1aee96d20f0452a945890f8_tooltipthumbs-sprite.jpg and it doesn't fit in some scene.

Error in gradle while importing project. using Android studio 3.1.3

@rubensousa : 
Hi, first of all I wanted to congratulate you.

Let's start with the questions:

1) would it be possible to use the latest version of exoplayer? 2.8.1
2) if I wanted to change the graphics of the exoplayer, would it be possible?
if yes, how can I do?
3) I tried to install the module but I did not understand, I also looked at the sample folder, but it seems that something escapes me.

After creating a new project I have:
- I opened the build.gradle file and installed the dependencies:
implementation 'com.github.rubensousa: previewseekbar: 1.2'
implementation 'com.github.rubensousa: previewseekbar-exoplayer: 2.6.0'

from what I understand use glide, so I must also install Glide's addiction, right?
