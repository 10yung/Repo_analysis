When your expectation is defined as field, it does not get printed:

``` scala
val expected = Set(1, 2)
test("foo"){
  expect(Set(1,2,3) == expected)
}
```

```
expect(Set(1,2,3) == expected)
       |          |
       |          false
       Set(1, 2, 3)
```

The bump to 0.10 reduced unwanted verbosity (#1), but didn't kill it entirely.
I'm getting unwanted `RangePosition found!` messages when compiling code that uses Expecty.

I'd love to get a build of expecty compiled against a recent 2.11.0 build (eg. M7) so that I can start testing my code for the transition to 2.11.0.
