self.server?.close()  it doesn't work,  I can still receive data. How can I close the server

Hello. There is no send method for a UDPServer object of this pod so how do i respond to the client which sent me data?

we use this code. please tell how to timeout the socket 
public init(port: UInt16, handler: ((_ ipAddress: String, _ port: Int, _ response: [UInt8]) -> Void)?) {
        self.address = sockaddr_in(
            sin_len:    __uint8_t(MemoryLayout<sockaddr_in>.size),
            sin_family: sa_family_t(AF_INET),
            sin_port:   UDPBroadcastConnection.htonsPort(port: port),
            sin_addr:   INADDR_BROADCAST,
            sin_zero:   ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 )
        )
        
Xcode 10.2 - carthage - unsupported swift version (3.0 not supported anymore)
V2.0.2 is the last one in podspec, but there's a new release
Someone can notify author to deal it?
We are getting data in byte array, I was wondering if we could get the actual data we are getting from socket?
I want to communicate with socket as below.
ex) "http://test.com:5000/test/05/abc/true"

What should I do???
