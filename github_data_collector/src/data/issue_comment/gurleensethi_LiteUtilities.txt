Hello, I need to implement a 2D reccylerview, I am already using the library so far. Now I have to implement a recyclerview with multiple viewtype (like: pagination - showing loading view while paginating or something like this). I have seen the `Builder` method and there is only one `viewType` that can be taken. Can you guyz look up on the issue. That will help a lot. Thanks
