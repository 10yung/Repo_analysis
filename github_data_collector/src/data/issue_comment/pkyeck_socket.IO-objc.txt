Hello everyone, I am using socket.IO-objc in my project using XCode9.0. I am trying to paring or connect with hardware device with using particular IP Address and Port which connect successfully. 
 I am using below code. ` // create socket.io client instance
    socketIO = [[SocketIO alloc] initWithDelegate:self];
[socketIO connectToHost:@"myHost" onPort:port];`

and then I am getting response from 

- (void) connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReceiveData:(NSData *)data  in SocketIO.m class. Now data coming in every seconds. It is working well. But when I lock my iPhone then connection getting break. This is the main issue. So how I can use socket connection in background. Please guide me I stuck from last many days.

Thanks 


I am using this library in iOS for communication with our back end server via websockets. I need to check on the client side if the socket is already connected or not .Is there a way to do the same?This is more to handle when app goes into background or app gets auto lock enabled on idle time
Since NSURLConnection has been deprecated in iOS 9, will this useful library be updated. I think NSURLConnection should be replaced by NSURLSession so that NSURLConnection dependency can be removed.

Hello, I have an issue, my server has a HAProxy loadbalancer and I need to send the cookies in the headers and in the connect.
When I add the cookies I can see that the cookies are sent in the request but in socketRocket did connect upgrade, I can see that the cookies in the parameter requestcookies can't be found.

I'm using     

```
    pod 'socket.IO', '0.5.2'
    pod 'SocketRocket', '0.4.2'
```

My setup is:

```
    socketIO.cookies = NSHTTPCookieStorage.sharedHTTPCookieStorage().cookiesForURL(NSURL(string: Constants.apiHost)!)
    socketIO.connectToHost(host, onPort: 0, withParams: nil, withNamespace: "NS")
```

Do you have any idea if I have a bad config or if I should make a PR and add the cookies in the WS request?

My regards.
Francisco.

I have tried lot's but not getting success, please suggest me how to send messages event from iOS client to server (Node.js).
I have used below code for Client side:

Connect host working proper:

```
    socketIO = [[SocketIO alloc] initWithDelegate:self];
    [socketIO connectToHost:HOSTURL onPort:PORT];
```

Send message/event not working .
Event:

```
 NSMutableDictionary *dict = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
    [dict setObject:@"123124238029850485" forKey:@"id"];
    [socketIO sendEvent:@"message" withData:dict];
```

Message:
`[socketIO sendMessage:@"Hello abc 12345"];`

Server side code: (Node.js)

```
var app = require('http').createServer(handler)
var io = require('socket.io')(app);
var fs = require('fs');
var users={};
var clients = {};
function handler (req, res) {
    var filePath = '.' + req.url;
  fs.readFile(filePath,//__dirname + '/index.html',
  function (err, data) {
      console.log("connnected from ios")
    if (err) {
      res.writeHead(500);
      return res.end('Error loading index.html');
    }
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end(data);
  });
}
app.addListener('request', function(req,res){
    console.log(req.headers);
});
app.listen(8080);
io.on('connection', function (socket) {
   socket.on('message', function (data) {
     console.log(" message  ===== " + data);
});
  socket.on('disconnect', function() {
    console.log("Disconnected >"+socket.id);
  });

});

```

Thanks,

Hi,

If I connect to the socket server via a webpage with JS, everything works as expected. Correct data, handling  the whole deal. 

As soon as I attempt to do the same via socket.IO-objc i get bad data in debug log, and cannot handle data.

Maybe something to do with sure how to handle line breaks in packet data? I try looking for "\n", "\r", "\r\n" but nothing seems to work. In addition I always get "ERROR: data that has arrived wasn't valid".

My JS script works successfully looking for "\n".

Thanks, John

Need to add "libicucore.dylib" library in Xcode in order to use socket.io.

The problem that I am stuck into is very simple yet complicated for me.
I would like to know how can I add a different path of the service that is being used.
I have a service running on server which is listening to port 3000 (i.e. localhost:3000) and I have another service which is listening request on port 3000 but on a different path (localhost:3000/Chat) 

How do I change the path ?

I am working for chat app and using Socket.IO library for establishing socket connection in iOS. Below is my response coming in source. I am not sure why my connection is disconnected
