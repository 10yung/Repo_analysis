I did you the docker image
Hi,

first of all thanks for your work and time, to create a simple application for managing mails and newsletter.

I have got a question on campaigns and sending mails on a scheduled time. If I create a new campaign and configure date and time, it is not saved when clicking on the "continue" button. After klicking "continue" again, the campaign is save as "draft".

If I edit this campaign, the schedule is not set. If I do configure it again, I can tell "schedule", and it is set to status "schedule". But it will never be executed. There is some note under "schedule", that is always the same: "Scheduled — Tue 14 Jan 2020, 08:01 AM" - is that okay? I scheduled it on another time today, but this note would not tell, that its schedule correct.

Do I am something wrong, or does the application need more planning time in the future? I am only waiting minutes for executing tasks in the future.

If I can assist you in any way, please tell me.

Thanks!
Hello,

  Is there a way to send, via api, an mail to a list, with a predefined template and given params ?

  I have a template with multiple placeholder {{message}} {{ticketLink}} {{title}} {{ incident_id }} and i wish to automate email sending in a external script which will consume the api with theses params :
* listNameOrID
* templateNameOrID
* params
   * title = “incident on dhcp”
   * message = “there is an incident”
   * linkTicket = “https://whatever.com/INC-5432”
   * incident_id = 354543

Can i achieve this with the last alpha ?
First off, thank you so much for open sourcing this tool :) 

Is the list subscription status currently used for anything? It seems to be for double opt-in, but it looks like it isn't used yet. I've set up my mailing list with double opt-in by only adding a list to a subscriber after they confirm, but that's a bit annoying because there's no subscription management page before I added users to the list (so I can't use the built-in UI to let users wipe their data before they confirm).
Hi,

In a test campaign, I can set in `From address` field: "Bécassine <becassine@example.com>"
If I do that, the received email shows:

> From: =?UTF-8?q?B=C3=A9cassine_ <becassine@example.com>, ?=@myhost.example.com

So I get in `From` the username weirdly written on the accent part, and the host, which did not need to be written here.

Therefore, I can also set in `From address` field: "Becassine <becassine@example.com>".
If I do that without accent, the received email shows:

 > From: Becassine <becassine@example.com>

And it is correct.

Can you fix it?

Thanks,
HLFH


Currently, only the subscribers API is documented, while there are [many more handlers](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/blob/2c18d6356bb8c1f9a2466455e3d4c1791a947461/handlers.go#L42) to document.

The docs are published at https://listmonk.app/docs/apis/apis/ and the source is at https://github.com/knadh/listmonk-site
Will you use Postfix for handling bounces (tailing and parsing its log, just like [cuttlefish](https://cuttlefish.io/) does, or implementing a full golang smtp server with [go-smtp](https://github.com/emersion/go-smtp) ?
