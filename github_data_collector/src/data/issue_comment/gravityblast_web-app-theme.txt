Hi, 
I am newbie to rails I wanted to install web app theme to my rails app. http://blog.bryanbibat.net/2011/09/24/starting-a-professional-rails-3-1-app-with-web-app-theme-devise-and-kaminari/

I have started following these tutorials and as well as Readme file from your repository.
When I try to add to the gem file I am getting the following error

Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "rails":
  In Gemfile:
    web-app-theme (~> 0.8.0) ruby depends on
      rails (~> 3.1.0.rc6) ruby

```
rails (4.0.2)
```

Can you please help me to solve it

removed Rails 3 dependency; will work now with Rails 4.0.x
corrected generators/theme bug that wasn't generating stylesheets (some code was dropped between 0.7 and 0.8), made path references relative to generator path
corrected layout to correctly reference Rails-style asset manifests

I'm using web-app-theme with ruby 1.9.3-head and rails 3.2.8. I'm not able to generate controller and also can't do rake task. It is giving me this error  "cannot load such file -- sexp". Can you please suggest any solutions for this problem.?

Thanks

I'm seeing this a lot in my logs:

Hi,

Please review as a fix to issue #50.
## 

andy

I installed and used web-app-theme for a project a few weeks ago.

Today I created a NEW project from scratch using 'rails new' command. That project does not use web-app-theme.

When I scaffolded that new project the delete button confirm message STILL refers to web-app-theme:

  = link_to "Delete", product_path(@product), :method => "delete", :confirm => "#{t("web-app-theme.confirm", :default => "Are you sure?")}", :class => 'btn'

Even after removing the web-app-theme gem, then removing the rails 3.1.3 gem, then re-installing rails 3.1.3 ge,, the scaffolding still refers to web-app-theme (but only for the DELETE action).

How can rails be 'stuck' referring to web-app-theme, and how can I fix that?

Hi web-app-theme is compatible with rails 3.2.1 and asset pipeline?? I can't run bundle command. I recived this message:

  In Gemfile:
    web-app-theme (~> 0.8.0) ruby depends on
      rails (~> 3.1.0.rc6) ruby

I use rails 3.2.1 and ruby 1.9.3-p0.

I'm rather new to Ruby on Rails and Web-App-Theme... and this is the first issue I've ever posted on Github.

When I try even the most basic Rails app with Web-App-Theme, it seems to me that defaults.js is not created. Here's how I tried (I'm using Rails 3.2.0):

```
rails new testapp
cd testapp
mate .
```

Then I edit the Gemfile to add the following: gem 'web-app-theme'

Note: adding "gem 'web-app-theme', '~> 0.8.0'" gave me errors about compatibility, so I just dropped the '~> 0.8.0' part and it worked.

```
bundle install
rails g scaffold Person name city
rails s
```

This seems to work fine when I visit http://localhost:3000/people

```
rails g web_app_theme:theme
rails s
```

When I go to http://localhost:3000/people I get an error message:

```
No such file or directory - Asset file not found at '/testapp/public/javascripts/defaults.js'
```

When I search the testapp directory, there is no file called 'defaults.js' anywhere.

Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug of some sort?

Thanks for your help.
