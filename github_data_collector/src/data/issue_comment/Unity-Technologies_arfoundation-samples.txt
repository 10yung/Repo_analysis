This tutorial only discusses using Cloud Anchors with ARFoundation on Android. Does anyone know if it will also work with iOS?

Thanks!
Whatever happened to ARKit remote?
I want to Instantiate the 3D model of a human after the user detected. But after that, I don't want my 3D model to move with the user, I want my model to stay there only where the user was detected.

Can some can tell me how can I achieve that? 
Hello Sir,

Hello Sir,
I've been trying to spawn different prefabs for differents images in ARFoundation but unable to do. Could you please tell me how should i do that.
We are making a project with image tracking and we were using these versions of the packages:
    "com.unity.xr.arcore": "3.0.1",
    "com.unity.xr.arfoundation": "3.0.1",
    "com.unity.xr.arkit": "3.0.1",
The FocusMode on the ARCameraManager is set to Auto. 
Experienced this issue:
On the Pixel 3XL phone the camera is not focusing at all and behaves as Fixed focus instead. The default focus is quite far from the camera, so the objects close to the camera are always blurry. Pointing the camera at near/far objects does not change anything, the focus is still fixed. 
At the same time, everything works perfectly on our other test phone, Xiaomi MI9.
Tried setting the focus mode to Auto manually in Update() as suggested on Unity Forums:
[https://forum.unity.com/threads/disabling-auto-focus.580510/](https://forum.unity.com/threads/disabling-auto-focus.580510/)
Did not work.
Tried the 3.1.0 versions of the packages with the same results: works as intended on Xiaomi MI9, no focus at all on Pixel 3XL.

Started rolling back the packages trying to find the combination that would work on both test phones. 
Along the way ran into 2 other known issues: 
1) Camera not turning on after reloading the AR scenes.
2) Tracking events removed or limited not being sent correctly when the tracked image is lost resulting in tracked object prefab staying on forever and never being removed. 

Discovered that these packages are working both on Xiaomi MI9, and Pixel 3XL (no issues mentioned above, no focus issues on Pixel 3XL)
   "com.unity.xr.arcore": "2.2.0-preview.2",
   "com.unity.xr.arfoundation": "2.1.4",
   "com.unity.xr.arkit": "2.1.2",

Has anyone experienced this before? Any advice on getting the focus working with the latest versions of the packages on Pixel 3XL?
Unity：Unity2018.4.14f1
ARFoundation:1.50-preview.7
ARCoreXRPlugin:2.20-Preview.6
Device:  MI 5

The check code is as follows：`
public class MyComponent {
    IEnumerator Start() {
        if (ARSession.state == ARSessionState.None ||ARSession.stateARSessionState.CheckingAvailability)
        {
            yield return ARSession.CheckAvailability();
        }

        if (ARSession.state == ARSessionState.Unsupported)
        {            
             Debug.Log("Unsupported");
            // Start some fallback experience for unsupported devices
        }
        else
        {
             Debug.Log("Supported");
            // Start the AR session
        }
    }
}
`
I've trying to create two RenderTextures one for PositionMap and one for ColorMap to use in VFX Graph from ARKit's:
- Human Depth Image
- Human Stencil Image
- Camera Background Image

More or less implementing what @keijiro did here but for ARKit:
https://github.com/keijiro/Rsvfx
https://github.com/keijiro/Dkvfx

Ideally, I would end up with:
- PositionMap RenderTexture that maps all the human stencil pixels to the screen/camera with x, y, depth and can work on different orientations and aspect ratios.
- ColorMap RenderTexture that maps all human stencil pixels from the camera background.

It has a lot of moving parts that I'm not very familiar with and I'm not sure what's the right approach would be.
Any ideas or steps that I should take would be appreciated!
I am able to build and run my app on iphone 7 but it does not track object and tried sample objects also.

After dynamically adding a tracked image using `ScheduleAddImageJob` to a `MutableRuntimeReferenceImageLibrary`, is there a way to remove that image from the library, so that it is no longer tracked?

The [docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@3.0/manual/trackable-managers.html) say: 

> You should never `Destroy` a trackable component or its `GameObject` directly. For trackables that support manual removal, its manager will provide a method to remove it. For example, to remove an anchor, you would call `RemoveAnchor` on the `ARAnchorManager`.

Is there something like a `RemoveImage` for  a `MutableRuntimeReferenceImageLibrary`?
