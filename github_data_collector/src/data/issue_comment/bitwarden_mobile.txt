When searching for logins either in the app or via the autofill interface, the last 5 or so results always end up being covered by the keyboard. Normally when I use similar search functions in Android apps, the interface "squishes up" to accommodate the keyboard being on screen and to ensure that nothing is covered up by it. It's a particular problem for those of us whose certain often used logins always end up at the bottom of a long list.
Say you're logging into a website, and you use the autofill accessibility service, but the app doesn't properly recognize what login it should give you for whatever reason. Fair enough, you'll do a search for it instead. Here's where the quirk happens. If you type what you want in, it'll serve up anything matching that term, which is a-ok. But the problem is that, on Gboard at the very least, if one presses the enter/"search" key after typing in what you want, the entire app crashes and restarts. It's really strange and I've noticed it happen on both Android 8 (what I'm currently using) and Android 9 respectively. 
I'm using Bitwarden Android app (2.2.8) on Android 7 (Huawei Honor 8).
The fingerprint unlock is enabled in the app.
When I launch the Bitwarden app for the first time, I can unlock it with fingerprint successfully.
If I switch to a different app, and then return to Bitwarden, it shows the fingerprint popup ("Use your fingerprint to verify"), but it does not respond to fingerprint sensor.
The only workaround I found is to switch to Android app list and choose Bitwarden app again. After that fingerprint unlock works.
It happens every time I switch to another app from Bitwarden.
I have an SSL error on Android 4.4.4, which didn't occur in the app version 2.2.6.

## Versions

* OS: Android 4.4.4
* App: 2.2.8 installed from FDroid (Official Bitwarden FDroid repo)

## Repro steps

The app hangs if asked to explicitly sync, and when logging in, the following error occurs

```
Exception message: Couldn't bind to method 'GetGetDefaultCipherSuitesHandler'.
```

Then, if I click "Log In" again, the following error is shown (once every button click).

```
Exception message: Native method not found:
xamarin.android.net.OldAndroidSSLSocketFactory.n_createSocket:(Ljava/net/Socket;Ljava/lang/String;lZ)Ljava/net/Socket;
```
The only time when autofill works within the browser is when initially signing into an Opera account upon first launching the application. Outside of that, neither the autofill or accessibility service work for me.

It seems unusual that it would work initially then never again, hence why I have wondered if it is an issue on my end.
iOS version: 13.3
BW version: 2.2.5 (59)
Lock setting: immediately
Touch ID is used for unlock

1. Logout & Login again
2. Put app in background & get it back to foreground
> should be locked now but it's not
(Lock setting is still on immediately)

Problem can be fixed by killing the app once.


Buttons copy login and copy password should be in result list row, not in an overflow menu.

There are enought space on 2020 screen

- My device info: android 9, MIUI 11, Xiaomi 6, Bitwarden 2.2.8.
- I enabled those 2 auto-fill services. 
- I kept the options of the two untouched. 
- I allowed the auto-start permission of this app.
- I disabled the battery-saving strategy on this app.
- I locked the app in the memory so it won't be killed by the system.

With these settings, this app frequently (0-3 times per day) causes ANR. 
Hi Bitwarden devs,

I seem to have found a bug where when I name a password entry a certain name it crashes the iOS app.
When I enter Raspberry Pi 3 as the name the app crashes entirely.
First off I swapped the Logout and Login Button on the Lock-Page to a more intuitive position. This idea was based on a suggestion I saw on Reddit (sorry forgot username).
Also I changed the Title of the Lock Page to something more fitting in German, as the old Title is too large to fit on the screen (cut off with "...").
Lastly I moved the Logout Button from the Settings into its Toolbar, which makes it a lot quicker to reach and adds consistency with the Lock page.

p.s. This is my first open-source commit and the first time I had to to with Xamarin. Please let me know if there are things I should pay attention to in the future, thank you! I hope you like my changes!
