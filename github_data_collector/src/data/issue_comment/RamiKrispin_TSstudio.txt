horizon parameter is ignored. Best model forecast missing. Maybe the problem is here

 # Creating grid of all the modeling combinations
  grid_df <- base::expand.grid(models_df$model_id, s1, train_method$sample.out, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% 
    stats::setNames(c("model_id", "start", "horizon")) %>% ...

sample.out is overwrite with "horizon"?
train_model function always returns the same error "Error in array(x, c(length(x), 1L), if (!is.null(names(x))) list(names(x),: 'data' must be of a vector type, was 'NULL'" when "nnetar" type model is setted.

The file below conteins an example.

Feature request -

Remove `NA` values for `pacf` or `acf` plots.

Helps quickly run commands like `TSstudio::ts_acf( diff ( ts.obj ) )`
I think it would be very helpful.

RMSE and MAPE have their issues in certain contexts, so I just like to put in a request for additional error measures such as MASE, MAE, Huber, etc., or maybe a function or argument that allows the user to add their own.

Beautiful visuals. Thank you for package.

Distribute the grid search table on the cores (as opposed to distributing it by testing period)
