Hello,

Are you planning to port it to Mac?

Thanks for your work!

I have tried to change RGB curves of an image but there seems  to be a problem with "filterCurve" method.  What it does is deteriorating shiny parts of the image.  What I mean by shiny parts is where the sunlight shines and the area is white-ish than any other point area on image.  Here is an example of what I am talking about; http://www.sensorprod.com/news/pr/2007-09_hydraulics/image01.jpg  There you can see red and yellowish parts which are deteriorated.  I ran into this issue when I play around with green curve.  There is nothing wrong when I just change Red and Blue curves, but when it comes to Green one things change.
