Currently there is no way (PHP serverside) to get the handle from the loggedin user from the $content.

Under $this->content['navigation'] we have (example data):

```
["loggedin"]=>
  array(3) {
  ["prefix"]=>
  string(6) "Hello "
  ["data"]=>
  string(58) "<a href="../user/testing" class="qa-user-link">testing</a>"
  ["suffix"]=>
  string(0) ""
}
```

It would be very helpful/useful to have the `handle` and the `userid` here as well.

Then the workaround in each plugin using:

```
$userid = qa_get_logged_in_userid();
$handle = qa_userid_to_handle($userid);
```
would not be necessary anymore. And would save one DB request per plugin ...

---

Or if not into the "navigation" then we should probably add a field `[userdata]` next to it.

Ah, I just see that we can use `qa_get_logged_in_handle()` as alternative. Still, having those fields in the content might facilitate the programming.

Just wanted to report that PHP 7.4RC throws the following errors:

	return get_magic_quotes_gpc() ? stripslashes($string) : $string;

File `/qa-include/plugins/qa-viewer-basic.php` parses links in posts if the option `qa_opt('show_url_links')` is true.

The parsing is done with `function get_html($content, $format, $options)`. Starting with:

    if (@$options['showurllinks']) {

Problem is that also links within `<code>` blocks are parsed.

However, links in code blocks should be untouched, IMO. Otherwise it leads to, for instance:

This commit provides a Dockerfile based on php-fpm that contains the source
code of question2answer. The container also support init scripts that may be
used to install plugins, themes or configure the running instance.

The commit also provides a compose file which enables the possibility to run a
deploy of question2answers using docker stack.

Also includes a helm directory which enables the deploy of question2answers in
a kubernetes server using helm. For this, a public image of the Dockerfile is
needed but for now, there is none published; so you may have publish your own
until an official one is released.

Documentation about this files, how to deploy an image, a docker stack or helm
instance is also provided.

Any one else notices?
Hi,
I am very new to Q2A, and I'm stuck how to integrate LDAP auth or, even better, Gitlab (which uses ldap-auth it's own).

Walking through the file `qa-external-users.php`, the examples are mostly regarding an own mysql users db but I can't imagine how to integrate gitlab/ldap. Login/Logout pages is no problem, but I don't see any possible way to access gitlab-database (postgres) or see valuable cookies to gather session information from.

I am surely not the only one who needed this; so may anyone can share his knowledge?

Many thanks!
It is more a logical issue, not a bug per se.

In `function qa_format_number($number, $decimals = 0, $compact = false)` https://github.com/q2a/question2answer/blob/dev/qa-include/app/format.php#L2366 there are the lines:

		// keep decimal part if not 0 and number is short (e.g. 9.1k)
		$rounded = round($number, 1);
		if ($number < 100 && ($rounded != (int)$rounded)) {
			$decimals = 1;
		}

*Even though decimals is passed with 0.*

This leads, for instance, to inconsistency in the users page:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764548/67619327-c594d800-f802-11e9-8ce6-125e7b243927.png)

In my opinion, it should be optional or avoided. – Or do this for numbers under 10k and add a `,0` too, to have it consistent.

I suggest (**but only for the users page**): 

```
		if ($number < 10) {
			$decimals = 1;
		}
```

If this is set global, e. g. the answer count displays as "0.0" 🌝
