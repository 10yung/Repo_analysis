Hi,

the card view is not displayed correctly when devices is rotated. Since on iPhone the app switcher is portrait only the issue only effects iPad.

Its quite easy to reproduce the issue:
- Use the existing MMAppSwitcherDemo
- Change the project settings from portrait only to all orientations
- Run the app on the iPad in landscape mode. 
- Leave the app and start the app switcher

The result looks like this:

The card view was created in portrait mode, and thus does not cover the screen correctly.

Any idea how to solve this?

Just wanted to know if anyone has tried to get an app approved that uses this technique or one like it.
