Hello,

The tables corresponding to the outputs 78, 80 and 82 do not showed up well.

Bye!
Hello,

I found your TSP example very useful. There is a small issue that I came across.

I found that using a `set()` in `generate_cities(n)` leads to problems with the indexing for larger problems. As a set has no fixed order the expression `list(set())` in `create_tour` used later might reorder the elements.

There is also a TSP example in the DEAP repository:
https://github.com/DEAP/deap/blob/master/examples/ga/tsp.py

Instead of `toolbox.register("mate", tools.cxOrdered)` they use `toolbox.register("mate", tools.cxPartialyMatched)` but I don't know what exactly the difference is.
