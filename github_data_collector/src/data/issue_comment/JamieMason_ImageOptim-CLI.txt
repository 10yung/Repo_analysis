## Steps To Reproduce The Error
Invoke imageoptim a second time on the same machine.

## Expected Behaviour
Both runs complete successfully.

## Actual Behaviour
When the first one completes, it expunges the temporary directory which both processes are using. The other immediately crashes:
```
i Running ImageOptim...
! ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/var/folders/ct/vwmp17px5lq96n7vrqf8fhqh0000gn/T/imageoptim-cli/image123.jpg'
! Please raise an issue at https://github.com/JamieMason/ImageOptim-CLI/issues    
```

## Version Numbers or N/A
N/A

## Help Needed
Invocations should each use a unique temporary directory. I'm unfamiliar with this language, but on the command line you can see what `mktemp` does:
```
% /usr/bin/mktemp -d
/var/folders/ct/vwmp17px5lq96n7vrqf8fhqh0000gn/T/tmp.oe1HyPEd
```
The string `oe1HyPEd` in this example is there to prevent bugs of this kind.

Fixing this probably only requires a tweak to [this line](https://github.com/JamieMason/ImageOptim-CLI/blob/master/src/constants.ts#L42) but at the moment I don't have time to familiarize myself enough to send a PR. If needed I will come back to this. Thanks.

## Description

This was a feature in `<2.0.0` of imageoptim-cli that needs reinstating.

## Suggested Solution

If ImageMagick's [compare](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/compare.php) is installed, or a NodeJS alternative exists, output quality loss information if the stats option is enabled.

This can be achieved with a new `if` statement at the start of the [`tell process JPEGMINI_APP_NAME`][code-scope].

There's an App called [UI Browser][ui-browser] which lets you click on bits of the OSX UI and inspect them, a little bit like the Elements panel of Chrome DevTools. Using this will let you detect whether the Registration panel is visble and, if it is, dismiss it by clicking on something.

The paths look like this `text field 1 of sheet 1 of sheet 1 of window 1` and are references we can use in applescript to get hold of pieces of UI.

This issue is to locate and dismiss the Registration panel.
