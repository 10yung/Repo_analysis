Hello; awesome project!

This pull-request contains some updates to the Framework project that should enable to it be used with current (Swift-3) projects. 

It does not contain any updates to the example projects. 

Hope this is helpful!

I'm unable to build this with Carthage and XCode 8.  I get the following error from the compiler:

    BITCODE_GENERATION_MODE = bitcode
    CARTHAGE = YES
    CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = 
    CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED = NO

Hey, I'd love to see this lib available in Swift 3 so I can implement it in my project.

Thanks 😄 
tested on iOS 10 beta 3 and watchOS 3 beta 3.

Hi, MotionKit looks like an awesome framework but I can't make it work. I've installed it using Cocoapods following the instructions and i got the error "use of unresolved identifier MotionKit". If i import MotionKit, i got "no such module MotionKit".

I've tried installing it manually by importing MotionKit.swift and everything seems to be recognized but the MotionKit.swift file has 16 issues that make the build fail.

Is anyone working on supporting MotionKit for the latest version of XCode and Swift? If not, has anyone found a workaround?

Thanks

I'm having a problem with uploading this library to apple watch app. Has anyone completed this task before? Have any source code available?

As others suggested the latest tag `0.8.1` doesn't work with `Swift 2`. If you really want to use it (in a non-safe way), use the master branch which works fine so far:

`pod 'MotionKit', :git => 'git@github.com:MHaroonBaig/MotionKit.git'`

Hope the author is able to create a proper version for it, or at least let some contributors to do it.
