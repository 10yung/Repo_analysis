After trying to setup R on the freshh Datalab instance I get 'ImportError: No module named simplegeneric'.

!pip show simplegeneric output:
Name: simplegeneric
Version: 0.8.1
Summary: Simple generic functions (similar to Python's own len(), pickle.dump(), etc.)

I tried to add location  /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages to the system path, but with no success. Do you know perhaps the solution to that problem?
I've been struggling to run even the first line 

import gcp 
import gcp.bigquery as bq

Where can I install or find gcp? Is not part of the sdk as far as I can tell?
