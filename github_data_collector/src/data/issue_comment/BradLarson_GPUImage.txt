This will fix crash on iOS 12 and 13
Hello @BradLarson , I have found a repo that port your library to use with android projects the link is at the end if you want to check out, However the problem i'm having and i noticed not only me while going through some other post on your project that when we apply ChromaKeyBlend filter it does not gave transparent background instead turn it into black.
So kindly if you have found any work around please do let me know.

Link to android version : https://github.com/cats-oss/android-gpuimage
`- (void)addFilter:(GPUImageOutput<GPUImageInput> *)newFilter;
{
    [filters addObject:newFilter];
    self.initialFilters = @[filters[0]];
    [self.terminalFilter addTarget:newFilter];
    self.terminalFilter = newFilter;
}`

How can I flip the camera by using TransformOperation?
â€¦ead to avoid crash on iOS 13, Xcode 11.

When is the code?
