Is the protocol being worked on any more? I note that clearskies_core is now abandoned.

Make is extremely clear that while file sync is one really useful application of clearskies, it is now written in such a way that any friend-to-friend application is supported by the protocol.

Hi there,
I just found a quite nice Linux GUI for Bittorrent Sync released under GPLv2, I think you guys might use parts of the code:

Just in case you didn't know about it already.

Hi, I think you should display a donation option more prominently. I found a bitcoin address in the clearskies_core repo, but not many people go there, and there isn't even a bitcoin logo or a colorful donate button, or something to catch the eyes.

I think this project is pretty awesome, and I think many people might support the efforts if you made it a bit easier. Adding a paypal option might not hurt either.
