SDWebImage has been updated and cannot be used properly
The animation on the MHShareViewController to resize photos in the share view is corrupted on iOS 11. the select boxes are out of the bounds. This can be seen in the provided examples. tap on an image then click on share button.
Please help, video scrubber cannot move back and forth, seem to be frozen.
When try to slide, it slide to the next photo or video instead.
I've got app rejection with motivation:

Your app uses or references the following non-public APIs:

UIScrollViewDelayedTouchesBeganGestureRecognizer, UIScrollViewPanGestureRecognizer, [UIView origin]

There is only one place where I can find 'UIScrollViewDelayedTouchesBeganGestureRecognizer' and 'UIScrollViewPanGestureRecognizer' is in MHGalleryImageViewerViewController. What can I do with it?
Does anyone know how to go about sharing a small mp4 rather than the link to the mp4?  
It gives warning because MHUICustomization  object did not have strong declaration..
This can be eliminated by changing the warning settings.

@property (nonatomic) NSDictionary *descriptionLinkAttributes;
@property (nonatomic) NSDictionary *descriptionActiveLinkAttributes;
@property (nonatomic) NSAttributedString *descriptionTruncationString;
Hello!

Thanks for the cool library that is very helpful! I have used it in my two last projects. In the last one, my client asked me to implement mini previews at the bottom of full-size image viewer. I think such option can be helpful for the community too (it can be turned on by UIcustomization)

I attach an example screenshot, also you can have a look on it with a help of second tab of your example app.

Thanks,
Vyacheslav

Hello, 
I have an issue in reading videos from a https url. The video runs but the remaining time is not well displayed on the right, furthermore the video progress bar doesn't work, it stays on the left for the whole video. 
Video length seems to be read as a negative number, screwing up the display.

Thanks a lot for this library!!

Hi,

I found out an app I'm developing was using 2.5G of disk space for its image cache even though every loaded images are from disk and I manage thumbnails myself, so literally no files should be in the `SDWebImageCache` folder.

It appears there is no detection of local files when downloading them with `SDWebImageCache` so I added a quick setting to prevent local images to be stored on disk.

Here is a preview of the commit in my fork dealing with this :

Thanks for considering,
