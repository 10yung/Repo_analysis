Hi,
First of all, thank you for this module.

I made a few small changes to prepare it for PsGallery publication.
Because I think it worth to have this module in the gallery.

If you have a lack of time I can deploy on the gallery instead. Please let me know in this case.


Best regards,
Dima
I didn't realize that was a twitter handle, I thought that was how you indicated who you were working for at the time.
If a process is being paused by Pause-Process, the Powershell session that invoked Pause-Process needs to remain open for the process to continue to be paused. Once the session exits, the paused process is then terminated.
Added Test-DebuggerPresent to the Pause-Process module and incorporated it into Pause-Process and UnPause-Process functions.
