Hi guys, 

Thank you for a helpful tool to make violin plots. I have a quick question regarding coloring and specifically how to color based on a predefined group. I have attach an example down below:

In this case, I would like to order the first two with the same color, but separate violins. The same would be done with 3 and 4 and so on and so forth. 

All the best, 
Christoffer
Hi. This is a great tool. I just have a question about how to specify the options.

How do you specify options for 'ShowData', 'ShowNotches', and 'ShowMean'? I've tried 0, 'true', and 'false', but none of these work.

Thanks.

Hi Bastian. Thanks for this awesome function.

I was wondering if there is a way to change the order of x-axis. For the example in your README.md. How can I change the order from "England France Germany" to "Germany France England"? It seems I could use VIOLINPLOT(DATAMATRIX, CATEGORYNAMES). But you have to make sure each column has the same number of rows for DATAMATRIX, which is not the case for this example.

Please advise
Hi, your plot looks beautiful.  This is a basic issue, but how should data be formatted for the program to run properly?

I currently have three groups, CCC, FFF, VVV, entered in a format such as CCC = [12 14 23 34 54 25]; 
This is not running properly and I am wondering how I should be entering these values instead so that I can get it to run.

Sorry for the stupid question, and any help is much appreciated!
Is there a way to normalize the violins so that the total area of them are the same? I know it can be done by using [ distributionPlot ](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23661-violin-plots-for-plotting-multiple-distributions--distributionplot-m-) but their graphics do not look as pretty as yours.

Thanks
This is an amazing visualization tool!

Could you add an option to display the Mean of the samples in addition to the Median?
Just adding another marker.

Thank You.
