Try to download video from this URL, It's not working

can you check it, please?
Line 188 in `MZDownloadManager.swift` 

In my case the casting of `0.8359183` to an Int64 produces `0` which then shows `Fatal error: Division by zero`

I think there is room for improving this code by cleaning up all the casting, but maybe a simple `speed > 0` check is enough?

then moved to the foreground but now the delegates are not calling. 
var additionalData: [String: Any] parameter added to handle custom functionalities like saving values into Database or making API calls if needed

Hi, the download does not start when I add the download to the manager;
