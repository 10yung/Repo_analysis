Upgrade to Rails 6 - would like to add in support of ActionText.
Dependabot can't resolve your Ruby dependency files.

As a result, Dependabot couldn't update your dependencies.

The error Dependabot encountered was:

```
Bundler::VersionConflict with message: Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "publify_core":
  In Gemfile:
    publify_core

    publify_amazon_sidebar was resolved to 0.0.1, which depends on
      publify_core (~> 9.1.0)

Could not find gem 'publify_core (~> 9.1.0)', which is required by gem 'publify_amazon_sidebar', in any of the relevant sources:
  source at `publify_core`
```

If you think the above is an error on Dependabot's side please don't hesitate to get in touch - we'll do whatever we can to fix it.

It's customary to have one factory file per model.

Lightbox trigger code may not be loaded in Frontend
We may need to split this up...

Also, does the Twitter integration even work anymore?
Because changing themes shouldn't change your feeds.

Publify should be neutral with respect to Analytics tools and not promote GA.

Additional plugins should be created to provide support for, e.g., Matomo.

An alternative would be to just provide a generic analytics code field where users can paste the entire provided JavaScript blob from their chosen analytics provider.
