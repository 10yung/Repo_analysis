I'm trying to build an armor set that includes at least two season 9 mods, one is general, one is void.  I don't care which piece takes them as long as one of them takes each.

Currently this is impossible.

I could filter for season:9, but I don't need every piece to be season 9.
I can select the "protective light" mod, but I have to choose when selecting it which armor piece it goes in, and at this stage I don't know or care.

My suggestion is that the seasonal mods not have a slot attached to them (as they can be applied anywhere).

custom stat total column. saves preferences for each class.

Only fetch once every 24 hours (unless a user explicitly requests it).

This addresses #4873 (and probably our collective sanity).
In Loadout Optimizer you use shift-click to **select** a perk, but to **exclude** an item.  This is both confusing and not obvious.

From a UI point of view, it would be more consistent to drag the perk into the select mod or perk area in the same way that dragging items to include or exclude them.

The autocomplete order starting with is:armor looks like this:

The problem is that is:armor2.0 will autocomplete before is:armor, but armor2.0 is a qualifier, not a primary type, so is:armor2.0 is a subset of is:armor.  The order should give the widest match first.

This is purely cosmetic, but the Ghost Projection icon in collections is more than twice as wide as any of the others, and it makes the text not line up.

If there isn't a normal width icon, I'd remove it completely so it's like Badges.

I don't really like the attempt at a color scale for stats in the compare view. This replaces them with just white text, and a highlight for the best value. The only thing this really loses is cases where all the stats are the same (those used to be the only white stats).

We should show the notification only when the wish list is loaded/updated, not every load.
When using the `source:ironbanner` search, it's not detecting the current season's armor.
