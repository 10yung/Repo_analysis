This allows easy integration into maven projects and eclipse using the m2eclipse and the android-maven-plugin.

An equivalent to a PreferenceActivity that manages fancy preferences and an ActionBar.
A color strip configurable frame that separates the ActionBar and the content of the activity.

Workaround : Quick Action Bar Transparent on press
We delay the dismiss of the QuickActionBar widget to give time to the
clicked view to refresh its state

By moving the specification of layout_height and scaleType from the XML layout to the style definitions, it's possible for developers to override the defaults without modifying the base GreenDroid library.  One may simply override the styles in the application.

If I'm missing some compelling reason to leave these two attributes in the XML layout, please enlighten.

I added project-specific settings so that Eclipse enforces Java 1.6 as the target. Without this, if the user's workspace is set to target a different version of Java by default (eg, 1.5) some compile errors can result.

When removing then adding an Item, if the item added was of a different type than the previous one (for exemple replacing a TextItem with a ProgressItem), ItemAdapter.getView() would crash when trying to reuse the convertView

Added QuickActionWidget's anchor tag, usefull if you have one QuickActionWidget by item in a ListView

I created a simple extension of the [ImageSwitcher](http://d.android.com/reference/android/widget/ImageSwitcher.html) class which changes the underlying View to AsyncImageView.  I had a need for this while writing my own app, and thought it would be a good addition to GreenDroid.
