I install this by conda installer, but when I trying to remove it, he told me this
'he environment is inconsistent, please check the package plan carefully
The following packages are causing the inconsistency:
***
***
***
[WinError 127] 找不到指定的程序。
'
1. Install Anaconda3-5.1.0-Windows-x86_64.exe -> Install for All Users  -> Add to PATH checked
2. conda install -n root -c pscondaenvs pscondaenvs
3. Start -> "cmd" -> Right click -> "run as a different user" -> enter username/password for any other user
4. in command window "activate root" -> shows "Access is denied" -> environment does not become activated.

"activate" continues to work for the user that installed anaconda, but not for any other users.  The only way I have found to fix is to uninstall and reinstall anaconda.

Im not sure if step 2. conda install is running correctly, see the "block is not recognized..." at the end:

```
conda install -n base -c pscondaenvs pscondaenvs
