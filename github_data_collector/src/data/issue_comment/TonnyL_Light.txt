Anytime i display the snack in a fragment where i have recycler view. It removes the padding on the first row of the recyclerview


Admob banners take space too.
What's the best way to show them, yet also allow to show snackbars?
I didn't see it mentioned on Admob website:
https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128877?hl=en
Or of snackbars:
https://material.io/guidelines/components/snackbars-toasts.html#snackbars-toasts-specs
This my dependencies code for Light:
`
implementation "io.github.tonnyl:light:${versions.light}"
`
and i am getting this error:  Failed to resolve: io.github.tonnyl:light:1.1.0.
Looks the particular release is not available on jcenter().
