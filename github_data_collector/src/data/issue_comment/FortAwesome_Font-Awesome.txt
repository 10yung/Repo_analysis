- [x] This is a single icon


This icon can be used to represent one of the most famous design systems for Angular. it's similar to bootstrap. As a developer will be awesome to add this icon to my online portfolio



We need the majestic Rhino to be added to the animals pack!

**Icon request checklist**
- [x] This is a single icon or matched pair (Ex: `lock` / `unlock`)
- [x] The title starts with "Icon request: " and is followed by the requested icon name (Ex: `Icon request: magical-unicorn`)
- [x] I have [searched for existing issues](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues) and to the best of my knowledge this is not a duplicate
- [x] I have included at least one example image if it could be helpful (optional)
- [x] The request is for a concrete object (it's harder to make an icon to represent happiness, it's easier to make a smiley face. ☺)

Svg is also available https://github.com/phalcon/assets/blob/master/phalcon/images/svg/phalcon-logo-300x300.svg

Would like to complete a matched pair for the open umbrella by adding a closed umbrella: https://fontawesome.com/icons/umbrella?style=solid

Using the pair is a fun way to graphically illustrate open and close actions.

Thanks!

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
There is a problem when validating Font Awesome websites using the css. In FA 5.7.0, we have switched to `font-display: auto` to allow users to use (the wrong) `swap` value, but now we have the chance to use `font-display: block` and get rid of the warning

**Describe the solution you'd like**
If we set the default `font-display` to `block`, as agreed in https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/14387#issuecomment-567093531, we can pass the validation without breaking stuff and fix rendering on browsers that do not honor the "similar to the block value" behaviour.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Ask users to change the scss files and recompile on our behalf, or override the css

**Additional context**
