Can you help with gsevent.h for IOS7. I read the binary of the graphicsservices, most of the API is still there. But I guess they change the way how to construct a gsevent in IOS7. Because I have a lot of crash in IOS7 which is not happend in IOS6.

Can you help with this pls. Also I am wondering how you can get all those header files in the first place?

I try build but some thing wrong with: GenerateAvailability2.d 
Error: Uncategorized near import
How to fix it.
Thanks
