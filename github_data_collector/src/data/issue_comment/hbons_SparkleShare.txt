Hi,

I'm on OSX Mojave, with SS 3.28.0. It's worked fine in the past, but recently I've noticed that changes I make locally are never pushed (to github, in my case) unless I restart SS or pause and resume the relevant section. The logs show activity like:

```
12:29:44 Git | Notes | Checking for remote changes...
12:29:44 Cmd | Notes | git rev-parse HEAD
12:29:44 Cmd | Notes | git ls-remote --heads --exit-code origin master
12:29:46 Git | Notes | No remote changes, local+remote: 461a361c06c8b050988e8732fd5f91febd0a78f3
```

If I make a local change and restart, I get a message like this:

```

12:42:50 Cmd | Notes | git status --porcelain
```

In the GUI (menu bar) it also seems several projects are stuck in "waiting to sync" for no obvious reason, but I'm not sure if this is related. For the specific repository ("Notes") tested above it actually just said "Last change 8:47am" when my last change was actually at 12:42.

It may not be relevant, but I've put the synchronised folders outside the SparkleShare root folder like so:

```

It would be nice to have GitHub CI/CD pipeline to automatically build SparkleShare for Windows using MinGW, MSYS/MSYS2, MXE or whatever. This way each new release will automatically have also a Windows version.

Maybe just use MXE docker image (FYI: MXE provides not only the compiler, but also a lot of dependency libraries out of the box), e.g.:
https://hub.docker.com/r/thewtex/cross-compiler-windows-x64
https://hub.docker.com/r/kurrestahlberg/docker-mxe/

You can find session logs by date and version information in:
~/.config/org.sparkleshare.SparkleShare/logs/ on Linux and macOS
C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\org.sparkleshare.SparkleShare\logs\ on Windows

To help us help you, please include the logs from around the time the issue occurred, as well as the SparkleShare version and info about your OS (displayed at the top of the log files). Then, tell us roughly in these steps what went wrong:


### What happened:
On Windows7 there were problems with encoding of the (automatic) messages (merges/commits) on Windows. See screenshot. It probably used Windows encoding instead of UTF8.

### What I expected to happen:
Readable text.

### This happens when:
1. On adding files into project directory.

Another question:
two files were added by SparkleShare:
1. .sparkleshare
2. SparkleShare.txt

Are they necessary or can I delete them(one of them)? Can I put them into .gitignore, if they are  necessary?

You might also want to add GitLab (into the list of predefined hosts) into the Windows version(it is present of Linux version)

Thank you very much! It worked very well and helps to collaborate with non-technical people!!!!

Thanks for reporting your issue or feature request, it helps lots!

Feature request: Support webhooks for notifications.

The major git hosting services all have webhooks to trigger actions when things happen with a repo. It would be nice to be able to trigger the notification service with a webhook when pushing a commit. 

You can do the same thing with a git post hook, but this doesn't work from a client such as Working Copy under iOS.

### What happened:
SparkleShare crashes suddenly and stops running.

### What I expected to happen:
no crash

### This happens when:
no specific action, but maybe logs can give some information

System:
Linux 5.2.0-0.bpo.2-amd64 (also tested with 4.19 - same issue)
Gnome 3.30.2
64Bit
latest stable Debian
Sparkleshare 3.28.0 installled through flatpak

Maybe this could happen when another application tries to write a file blocked by SparkleShare?
In other cases Sparkleshare crashes at system startup, but I cannot provide logs atm. When the startup issue happens again I will post them here.

```

### What happened:
I tried checking out a keybase encrypted git repo. It fails with a `Could not fetch host key` error.

### What I expected to happen:
Honestly, I'd be a bit surprised if this worked out of the box. Keybase encrypted git uses `git-remote-helpers` (https://keybase.io/blog/encrypted-git-for-everyone) which may require a bit of extra work on SparkleShare's part.

### This happens when:
1. `Sync remote project`
2. `Own server`
3. Address: `keybase://team` and Remote Path: `/my-team/my-repo`


If keybase repos can be supported, it would be best if they had a pre-configured checkout, similar to what exists for Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab.

SparkleShare is a really nice software for sync with git.

For my usage, I hope to use it to distribute python code from my private git repository (Gitea) to Windows PC client. Is there any way to do so?

I tried to use "Deploy Key" to make clients read-only but SparkleShare client is creating .sparkleshare and SparkleShare.txt files automatically so that there is always "Failed to send some changes" error on client.

Thanks a lot.

### What happened:
Unable to use http/https url in sparkle share, https protocol doesnt seem to be supported.

### What I expected to happen:
http/https protocol should work as expected
### What I expected to happen:
Option to lock/unlock files with GIT LFS lock / unlock 
Locking files helps especially for documents and also informs user about the document being modified by others.

I'm trying to sync a remote project on the mac SparkleShare app. The project is empty, I've just created it on a fresh raspberry pi. No problem or error during install.

When I click add, the app start loading then pops a "Ooops" screen.

I checked the logs and this is what I found : 
```

```

When I try to type the "git ls-remote" command in my terminal, it works. I tried to clone the repository using the terminal, adding, commiting and pushing a file. Everything works, so I guess the Git server is working ? 

Any ideas ?
