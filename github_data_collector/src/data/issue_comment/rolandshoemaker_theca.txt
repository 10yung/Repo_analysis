This software is really cool, I was thinking about building something very similar to this. Then I did some research on the rust ecosystem and found this. I have converted my notes over to it, I think it has a lot of potential. 

Most of my suggestions actually require very little changes. It could all be done just using the profile.json 

Let me know how you feel about these suggestions. I may add them myself soon as I have time available.

**1. Replace symmetric encryption with GPG or additional add GPG as an encryption option** I'm not a fan of the symmetric encryption, it'd be way better it if let you set a gpg key (or several for teams) and it just automatically encrypted to those keys when closing. If done well you could safely store your notes on Github. 

**2. Select note by UID or title** Select by title and UID. It would be nice to be able to select by both. 

**3. Folder and Sub-folder organization** Nesting/trees, so you could have programming/rust, programming/golang, programming/r. Have you used pass? This is along the lines of what I was thinking. You could also use the folder structure to provide more granularity with the gpg encryption. For example, one folder can be encrypted with 3 keys and another just encrypted with yours.

**4. Option to default --editor when using edit or another short command to quickly open an editor** The ability to default the edit command to open up the editor
This may require a config option, it can just be stored in the profile.json 

```
theca edit 1 --editor 
```

is more than I want to type every time I edit

**5. Optional color label for a note, to group similar notes and make division of different notes very clear at a glance** It would also be nice to be able to set the color in the notes list, this could also be defined in the profile. When you have like 15 notes files it helps distinguish them, it could be like a label in a way.

**6. Ability to very easily set a after_save hook script that runs every time a note file is saved** Ability to very easily just add a script to the saving process, like a "after_save_script" attribute. So in the profile.json, one could specify a script to run when a file is saved. For example, I could define a sync.sh script, rsync the changes to another server or scp the changes to off site backup or assuming ~/.theca has a git repo like mine, one could commit and push the changes to an off site repo.

This could feasibly replace my request for gpg encryption, but personally I think adding gpg provides better security. The private gpg key would not even need to be present to encrypt, and the exposure from comparisons with symmetric encryption.

**7. Alias commands to short 1 letter verisons** For example, edit could also be accessed with e.

```
theca edit 1 --editor
```

becomes

```
theca e 1 --editor
```

I would love to have a library for this, so I can integrate it in [imag](https://github.com/matthiasbeyer/imag) - my personal information management suite for the commandline (written in Rust).

I could use the JSON API, but a native interface would be way nicer. I guess I would integrate it as notes module backend.

`crate` allows for an easy installation of rust tools. After running `crate install theca` I got an error message that it's not available:

```
$ cargo install theca
    Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
error: could not find `theca` in `registry https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
```

It would be really handy to be able to install the tool by means other than executing a shell script that needs to be reviewed beforehand.

cargo build fails building libc v0.1.3 on nightly 696b7 on Linux and Windows.  Could you specify which nightly builds the current codebase?


I keep trying to read it as "The CA". Could you drop a hint in the README about how one is supposed to pronounce the name of this project?

I noticed often times the domain is not responding properly to my curl requests. I tried from two different machines in different locations and networks and all I get is:

```

Other curl requests the script does, like the one to `https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh` work well. `wget`ting get_theca works too without a problem, downloading it from the browser works too. Let me know if you need more help.
