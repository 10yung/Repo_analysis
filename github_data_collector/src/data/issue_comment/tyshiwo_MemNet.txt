Hi, thank you so much for the source code. Besides, could you please provide the resulting image of the degradation model? I am not familiar with caffe. I test the pytorch version and find it do not reach the best performance.
Hi, thanks for your sharing.
I don't know how to calculate the number of parameters of M6R6.
Parameters of  memory block are 64x3x3x64x12 + 64x6x1x1x64 = 466944 â‰ˆ 467k.
So the parameters of the six memory blocks are at least 467k x 6 =2802k.
How is the 677k in the article calculated?
Hi, @tyshiwo , Thanks for your excellent work.

I have read the MemNet paper, and I find that in table 2 the Memnet parameters is 677K, I'm confused by the total parameters.....

The default model is M6R6 with depth 80. In every residual block, there are 2 relu_conv structure (64x64x9x2), so I just calculate the conv parameters:
(64x64x9x2)x6x6 = 2654208
and I calculate the total parameters, which are roughly 2.91M. 

So I'm confused by the total parameters. Can you point out the actual method to calculate the parameters in your paper? Thanks a lot.

To generate the input of JPEG Deblocking, use MATLAB JPEG encoder to compress images.
Could you illustrate the MATLAB JPEG encoder? Is JPEG2000 compress algorithm? or other tools?
Thanks 
Recently I use python caffe to test your model,but the effect is shit.And I use python opencv2.4.11 to read the image,change the input channels to RGB,use the matlab formula to change channels to y_cb_cr.But I also get a bad result.Could you help me to fix it
