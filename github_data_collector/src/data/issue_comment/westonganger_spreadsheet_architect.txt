A new gem `caxlsx` (Community Axlsx) has been released, Spreadsheet Architect should support this.
â€¦column from scrolling in an xlsx file.  This new option is part of the :header_style option hash.

This is the basic idea. It works.  You may have a better feel for the actual style name to use that fits better within your sense of an API element.

Solves #25 
It is not obvious to me switch style to use in the header style has to cause the header ro to be fixed non-scrolling.  I thought maybe it was `locked` but that did not work; nor did it keep a user from changing the content of a cell in the header row.

Does spreadsheet_architect support this capability?

In stack overflow this question is asked of axlsx with the following answer:

`
Axlsx::Package.new do |p|
      p.workbook.add_worksheet(:name => 'DATA') do |sheet|
        sheet.add_row(%w{key col1 col2 col3 col4 col5})
        #Fix first line and column
        sheet.sheet_view.pane do |pane|
          pane.top_left_cell = "B2"
          pane.state = :frozen_split
          pane.y_split = 1
          pane.x_split = 1
          pane.active_pane = :bottom_right
        end

        10.times{
          sheet.add_row(%w{1 2 3 4 5 6})
        }
      end    

      puts "Write %s" % XLSX_temp
      p.serialize(XLSX_temp)
  end
`
Assuming this works, what is the equivalent SSA api?``
It would be a huge improvement to the test suite if the tests validated the xml/txt contents of the spreadsheets automatically instead of requiring a manual look at the test spreadsheets. 

I would love any PR's or contributions that could help improve our tests. Some test examples to get started could be found within the [`axlsx`](https://github.com/randym/axlsx) and [`rodf`](https://github.com/thiagoarrais/rodf) repos.
Hi, first of all thank you for your work on Spreadsheet Architect, you make life easier for thousands of developers.

I am using the `2.0.2` version of the gem and I have an issue while trying to create a ODS file with a Time in a cell.
Here is my code : 
```ruby
SpreadsheetArchitect.to_ods(data: [[Time.now]], header: false)
```
When i open with LibreOffice the produced file the cell value is `0` (displayed `30/12/1899`) and the format is set to `date`.

Am I missing something ?

Thanks for your help
