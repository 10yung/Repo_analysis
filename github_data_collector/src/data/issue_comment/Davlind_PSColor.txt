Hey I just wanted to give back some changes that I had implemented to color more content. Feel free to ask anything about the changes. It would be awesome to see them implemented in your source but I understand if you don't want to!

Cheers,

Aaron
Regarding Issue #18, I added highlighting function to the matched text with Select-String.
I don't remember the output being so jagged, but if I remove PSColor, it lines up fine.  I'm not sure if this was caused by a recent PowerShell update or something else.

I should note that the terminal size makes no difference:

PowerShell Version: 5.1 Build 17134 Revision 48

I'm using the latest zipped release of PSColor because PsGet isn't working right now.  I'm not sure why but I can't download anything using it.
Is there any way to process all data printed in powershell, match patterns and colorize them. I want to highlight some words in output of any software. Is it possible?
I am not seeing your last PR merge reflected in the repo.
Go to c:\windows directory and then get-childitem c:\users. -> directory: shows c:\windows, it should show c:\users.
PS 5.1 on Win10 1709.

Create a profile.ps1 with a single line in it:
`Import-Module PSColor`

Start ISE (regular or Administrator) with that profile file. It freezes — no response to keyboard, mouse, etc. It has to be killed from Task Manager.

Rename the profile.ps1 to something like pscolor.ps1. Start ISE (without any profile file). Then source the file with
`. ./pscolor.ps1`

It works fine. Something is happening different in the profile file than in sourcing the file.

I've had this replicated by someone else on a different system, so it's not just my system.
Hi,

Example of the issue:

test.txt content:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8

command:
`select-string .\test.txt -pattern "5" -context 3`

output when only pscolor module is loaded:
`test.txt:5:5`

output when no modules are loaded:
```
  test.txt:2:2
  test.txt:3:3
  test.txt:4:4
> test.txt:5:5
  test.txt:6:6
  test.txt:7:7
  test.txt:8:8
```


Thank you for your color module :)

I needed to test something without PSColor loaded, but I ended up having to edit my $profile rather than just temporarily remove it.
