Hi guys, below scenario is possible or not ?

Scenario ::

 I want to create a object where i pointed by AR.
 I want to save SCNNode object which is created, I did by using NSUserdefaults.
 I want to show the object which is saved when i relaunching my app.
Problems ::

I have created an object where i need even i saved but the problem is, It creating everywhere when i relaunching my app. I want to be unique object as where i created at the same location.

What is my idea to solve this problem ::

I was getting device location (latitude,longitude) along AR giving distances from device to object when i hit the screen. Also i did calculate the latitude and longitude of object place by using longitude, latitude(device location) and distance. Afterwards, set the radius as 30m from device location then in b/w if any object was created recreated the SCNNode.

Help ::

Is it possible to do, what i expected by using above idea ?
