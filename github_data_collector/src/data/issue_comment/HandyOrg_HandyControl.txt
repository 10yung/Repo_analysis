**Describe the bug**
NumericUpDown中，先Value再设置DecimalPlaces的话会执行`Math.Floor`忽略Value的小数位。

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

``` XML
<hc:NumericUpDown DecimalPlaces="2"
                  Value="100.12345" />
<hc:NumericUpDown Value="100.12345"
                  DecimalPlaces="2" />
```

**Screenshots**

**建议**
我认为属性值的设置应该无关它们的顺序。应该时这句代码出了问题：

``` CS
result = Math.Floor(result);
```


**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - .net: 4.5以上
 - IDE VS2019
 - Version 2.4

Text Validation, It's widely used but needs to be re-programmed by the developer. If using HandyControl we could do validation while the user types{in Xaml}, that will save some time.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

<hc: TextBox Validation="*&%" ValSpace=False />  

now this Text Box will not allow to put { * , & , % } or Spaces , and will show a blip like this.

目前的分页比较单调，希望能想图片中这样，丰富一些，可以填写要跳转的页码跳转。谢谢


If this control can support UWP, that will be great!!!

Thanks.

If the text length is longer than the control's length, currently behavior is let all the text disappear, and show again.

But this can be more friendly, when the last word shows up, leave a few text distance, and show the first word.

Thanks for your great control.


**Describe the bug**
There is a bug in outline text box that when I use it with persian text (right to left text) it reverse it and I should use flow direction left to right to fix it.
