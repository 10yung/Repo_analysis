Hi, 

if you'd be able to elaborate `# TODO: persist and restore the state & position of panes.` in [https://github.com/mislav/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/tmux-session](tmux-session) anytime soon, I would much appreciate it :)

Thanks for any response!
I need to use vimx with Fedora20 and the script didn't work until I made the following change:
if [ "${cmd%m}" = "vi" ]; then
TO
if [ "${cmd%m*}" = "vi" ]; then

currently, install script make a symbolic links if profile not exist.
as people might want to merge existing ones when they start using the repo & install script,
maybe we can provide a simple compare and merge feature
