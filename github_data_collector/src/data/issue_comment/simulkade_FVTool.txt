Hi, I need to solve the 1D advection diffusion equation for a species concentration, with a sink term. At the left BC there is a constant concentration for all time steps, at the right BC, the advective flux equals the diffusive flux initially. I want to add an optional sink term "k(phi-phi_max)", which should be zero for cells when phi<phi_max, and which should have a value that sets the cells concentration equal to phi_max when concentration reaches phi_max, not allowing the concentration to rise above phi_max. Sorry for the long description, but is this possible with your code?
Not really important, but may be helpful for preparing presentations and documents.

The derivations are ready to implement.
