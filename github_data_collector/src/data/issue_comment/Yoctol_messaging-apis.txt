The messenger logo link was invalid (not found).

Due to [the official docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/reference/messenger-profile-api), `payment-settings` is not in the Messenger Profile Properties.

Maybe we should remove Payment Settings related APIs from `messaging-api-messenger`?
It would be better to support APIs in Slacks' native API structures

e.g.
`conversations.info`

https://github.com/Yoctol/messaging-apis/blob/b83f9186f7e2f477caf29ffec675a24d0d518c68/packages/messaging-api-slack/src/SlackOAuthClient.ts#L177-L190

current API:
`SlackOAuthClient.getConversationInfo`

Slack's native structure:
`SlackOAuthClient.conversations.info`



close #391
https://developers.line.me/en/reference/messaging-api/#issue-channel-access-token

And then we may want to add short-lived access token and re-issue token support for LineClient.
This is a feature request:

I'd love if there was an integration for [Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers) since it became a quite popular platform for communication and it would be helpful to be able to use a common interface to manage it as well as the others that are supported here.
