Trying to use pyodbc driver but getting error:
ImportError: libodbc.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


I see you have pyodbc with unixodbc but in order to actually use pyodbc with things like sqlalchemy the actual odbc driver from Microsoft is required. In my experience nothing appeared in the `/etc/odbcinist.ini` file until I followed the instructions here. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15 
Related: #48 

Now that lambda has supported Py37 for a while lambda-packages should have a cryptography package for 3.7.

This upgrades to the latest/greatest version.

Django 2.2 deploys using SQLite (or the Zappa Django Utils s3sqlite engine) will fail, because the current package is SQLite 3.6.0.

Cheers!


#101 and #98 seem to have some overlap here with fixing the build scripts to not use `--use-wheel` and proper support for python3.7, so I am not getting into that. I can verify that the provided binary works in a python3.7 deploy using `xmlsec`.

I expect all packages in this repo will need to be rebuild on the new Amazon Linux OS and possibly create multiple areas for packages that work with the old OS and those that work with the new OS
* removed the obsolete pip option '--use-wheel' which no longer works.
* fixed formatting of the build instructions in READMEs which made copy-pasting from a formatted page incorrect.
