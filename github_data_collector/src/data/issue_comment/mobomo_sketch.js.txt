I was wondering if this repo is death and if there are any alternatives?
Hello, 
While refer the following example link http://intridea.github.io/sketch.js/ in tools example, how can the get the height and width of the marked yellow color on image.?

**This repo is abandoned.** 

There are a lot of pull requests that resolve some bugs, but @intridea do not appears to care.

Can someone fork this, accept the pull requests and make this script live again?

Hi everyone,

It works perfectly in IOS system, but not for android system.
I tested with HTC M8 using Android 6.0, i cannot draw anything while i can do it on my ipad and iphone. Can anyone know what should be adjusted to make it run properly in Android browser.

Thanks.

Hello, currently i developing a sketching function in my system using coldfusion and sketch.js. Those source can run perfectly in window browser, but when tested with mobile chrome browser, the last action on the canvas (no matter is delete or sketch) can't be detected and save. I have search through the web, there is no solution on this problem. Anyone can guide me to solve this problem? TQ.

Hi, I was getting an "undefined getX" or "undefined getY"
Because e.originalEvent.targetTouches had length 0 on last touchevent, that caused canvas to be
wiped clear.

```
Sketch.prototype.onEvent = function(e) {
      console.log(e.originalEvent.targetTouches);
      if (e.originalEvent && e.originalEvent.targetTouches) {
        if (e.originalEvent.targetTouches.length){ ///-----------> Added
          e.pageX = e.originalEvent.targetTouches[0].pageX;
          e.pageY = e.originalEvent.targetTouches[0].pageY;
        }
      }
      $.sketch.tools[$(this).data('sketch').tool].onEvent.call($(this).data('sketch'), e);
      e.preventDefault();
      return false;
    };

```

I have enjoyed using your thoughtfully designed library, sketch.js, for a shared whiteboard 'toy' app.  In the process of integrating sketch into my app, I found it necessary to add some eventing.   Perhaps other users of the library would benefit from these enhancements.

I added three event emits, to announce the beginning, end, and extension of each action.  Each event carries, as extra data, the action data.   I also added two event listeners, one 'clear', to clear the Sketch object and canvas, and 'load', to add a set of actions to the Sketch object and canvas.

The sketch.coffee file has been modified with the changes, and sketch.js compiled with the online compiler at coffeescript.org.   I also added a paragraph to the 'index.html' documentation file, but did not preview it.   

I do not have front-end tooling setup to compile and minify the coffeescript, so only updated the coffee file and the un-minified JavaScript.   When you merge, you might want to download merged source and run your front-end tooling scripts to finish up.

Anyway, thank you for your work.

When you just click and don't move the mouse, sketch.js doesn't draw a dot.  Is there any way to enable this?

How do i change the opacity of the fill color for the lines? I'd like to add this "opacity: 0.6;" to the tag but when i append the stroke color it does nothing. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

```
$.each(['#f00', '#ff0', '#0f0', '#0ff', '#00f', '#f0f', '#000', '#fff'], function() {
          $('.tools').append("<a href='#the-canvas' data-color='" + this + "' style='border: 1px solid black; width: 30px; font-size:17px; background: " + this + "; display: inline-block;'> &nbsp;&nbsp;</a> ");
```
