**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
It's difficult to find the title you want when it's alphabetically sorted but only the title icons are shown rather than the names of title being shown in a list.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Introduce a new button for cycling between different sort order. The most recently used sort order is remembered. Support the following sort orders:
* Alphabetical
* Time since last played (most recent first)
* Total play time (decreasing)
I only use my switch for one thing and that's to edit pokemon. 

 When beginning the process to edit through pkhex  I tried to backup my save file, before I take the SD card out and place it Into the comp. For use work pkhex.

 When I go into to checkpoint  It shows that I currently have 57 minutes of gameplay.  I have an hour and 7 minutes of gameplay that is not being backed up. 
 I hit L to backup it says that it saves it but nothing happens when I take the memory card out and put it into the computer to use PK hex that's a file is nowhere to be found

 I have re hacked my switch 3 times following  The exact same instructions to the t.

It all began with the new update for pkmn sword and sheild
(Expansion pk)

I am using the all most updated stuff.. programs etc.

**3DS:**
- Entrypoint: B9S 1.3 Luma 10.0.1
- System version: 11.13.0-45E
- Checkpoint version: 3.7.2
- Result code (if available): None

**Additional context**
Issue originally opened on the Luma3DS repo [here](https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/issues/1356) and moved to here since it appears to be an issue with Checkpoint

My own testing can only reproduce this during repopulating the titles list, so I have listed this issue as such. However, the original person who opened the issue on the Luma3DS repo has not specified whether it was still reloading at the time.
**Describe the bug**
I wanted to restore a backup for the game Earthlock (title id 01006E50042EA000). The restore operation fails with error code: 0x346402. Failed to commit to save device. After that the screen is slightly darker tahn before and in the center of the screen floats the text 'Save0'. See my attached screenshots for this. 'Save0' is one of the savegame files which is in the Checkpoint save folder for that game.

In the end no save game is present for the game and I have to start at the beginning as if I did not have played the game before.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to Checkpoint
2. Switch user (as I use 2 users on my Switch) to 'Me'
3. Select Earthlock from the game list
4. Select the previously created backup and hit 'restore'
5. the error pops up

**Expected behavior**
I expected my savegame to be restored.

**Switch:**
- Entrypoint: applet mode and non-applet mode
- System version: 9.1 with atmosphere 0.10.1
- Checkpoint version: 3.7.4
- SD Card Filesystem: Fat32, also have tested with exFat, same error

**Additional context**
Creating a backup with latest EdiZon and restoring that backup results in an error, too. It's another one (just error code -2 without a text), but it seems that other savegame managers do have problems with that title too.
**Describe the bug**
Cannot exit from Checkpoint

**To Reproduce**
1. Open HBL in title mode 
2. Open Checkpoint

4. Exit checkpoint

**Expected behavior**

**Real behavior**

**Switch:**
- System version: 9.0.1 (Atmosphere 0.10.0)
- Checkpoint version: 3.7.3
- SD Card Filesystem: exFAT
I open up checkpoint using the hold R and press A and keep holding A. When i make a back up of pokemon sword it says successful saved to sd card. I make another back up to edit using PKHEX and get the same successful saved to sd card. So when i close out checkpoint turn off console and remove microsd card. I connect to my labtop and i go into the switch folder,  the checkpoint folder and finally the pokemon sword folder but i can see the folder checkpoint created but with no save file inside. Any help to fix this. Im running atmosphere lastest version.
