Thank you so much for sharing!
when I run the code "show_pose_results.m",it will be reported the error:Reference to non-existent field 'model_path'.
As follows:
show_pose_results
loading 3D models...
Reference to non-existent field 'model_path'.
Error in show_pose_results (line 23)
        file_obj = fullfile(opt.model_path, object_names{i}, 'textured.obj');
can you tell me what's that means.and how to get it works,thanks.
Hi,

Where does the object axis lie in the YCB models included with this dataset? Has it been centered at the object?
Hello. I'm testing some icp methods on your dataset . In evaluate_poses_keyframe.m, there are translation error metric and rotation error metric.   I wonder if the t_est in it is a pose or just the last column of transfomation matrix T(4*4) because in function add, t_est represents the last column of T. But if I use the definition in function te, it seems that it just measure distance difference the cloud travels,  but not distance between ground truth cloud and our estimated cloud. 
I remember somewhere I saw that the focal length of one of the cameras was `35.27039762259147`, but I cannot seem to find it again!
Can you give a pointer to where this information is stored?
When trying to run evaluate_poses_keyframe.m the function quat2rotm is missing. I also could not find it defined anywhere in this repository, though it is used in the other evaluation scripts.
This dataset is too big to download on my system. Is there anyway you can provide a smaller version of the dataset for test purposes.

Thanks.
Hello!Sorry to bother, I've noticed your paper on arXiv, but I couldn't find the source code download link on your website or your paper, is that because you haven't release your source code yet? If so, is there a schedule of releasing your source code?Thanks.
