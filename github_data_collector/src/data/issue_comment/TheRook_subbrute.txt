Hello,

I shortened the wordlist to 1k subdomains and run the script again at 100 threads and still 15 minutes and keeps going...

that means that if i try the main wordlist of 130k subdomains it would take +5,40 hours

Is there any way to speed up this? what about the resolvers.txt? can i update it somehow? what type of resolvers and where should i look for them?

a well organized and correct documentation helps a lot.
```

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred

I'm getting this on python 3.7.2 while running python subbrute.py -t x.txt > out on carnegiescience.edu or when it was transitioning to www.tesla.com. Script was ran on Win 7 Ultimate SP1 and it was his 1st or 2nd line.

Is -a still supported? I have used this to list IPs and domain names, -p works a bit differently and gives more info , but I am wondering what's up with the -a option or how to use it properly.
So, how does subbrute work, exactly?
Does it just check every value in the wordlist?
How does it deal with wildcards?
I seem to be getting a lot of false positives.
just picked my own site(that has only one subdomain) and this tool finds 10+ subdomains, none of them have an IP assigned, how did these subdomain exist in the first place, or is it a false warning from subbrute?
Typically, the most common way to install Python Packages is through the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi).

To make installation easier, I would like to see subbrute mirrored on the Python Package Index. This would allow easy installation through a single command.

`pip install subbrite`


When using `fierce` to enumerate subdomains, we are presented with the corresponding IP addresses as the results roll in, and at the end, the subnets where hostnames were found.

Like this:

> [...]
192.30.253.125    live.github.com
192.30.253.124    live.github.com
192.0.2.1	    ns1.github.com
192.0.2.2    ns2.github.com

> Subnets found (may want to probe here using nmap or unicornscan):
	192.0.2.0-255 : 2 hostnames found.
	192.30.253.0-255 : 23 hostnames found.

This would be extremely useful in subbrute as well!
