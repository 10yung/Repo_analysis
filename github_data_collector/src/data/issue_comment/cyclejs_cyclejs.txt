Why request mutation in isolateSink? I'm incapped in a bug in wich I base a new request on precedent requests an the added _namespace break the isolation.
```
export function isolateSink(
  request$: Stream<RequestInput | string>,
  scope: string | null
): Stream<RequestInput> {
      ...
      req._namespace = req._namespace || [];
      req._namespace.unshift(scope);
      return req;
}
```
Would not be better to instantiate a new request?
```
export function isolateSink(
  request$: Stream<RequestInput | string>,
  scope: string | null
): Stream<RequestInput> {
      ...
     return {
                ...req,
                _namespace: [scope, ...(req._namespace || [])]
            }
}
```
Let's hope this is green again now

- [x] I used `pnpm run commit` instead of `git commit`

Before #890, it was possible to send `{ type: 'push', pathname: '/foo?bar#xyz' }` to the history sink and have it properly processed by the history driver.

As of #890, now that the pathname is passed inside an object, this no longer works and requires `{ type: 'push', pathname: '/foo', search: '?bar', hash: 'xyz' }` instead.

I guess this makes sense, but I think this should be made more clear in the changelog of v7.2.0 (and might even warrant a major version bump?).

More importantly though, this broke the captureClicks functionality for links with a search query or a hash, because captureClicks still welds the pathname/search/hash together into a single string.

This fixes a bug described in https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs/issues/902

This issue likely affects other libs where `peerDependencies` were erroneously removed in favor of `dependencies`.  This is definitely a bug in the context of `rxjs-run`.

Closes #903 
I have a DOM element emitting a CustomEvent.

On cycle component I do

```
state$.map(
   state => DOM.select('[name=' + state.name + ']').events('myNonBEvent', {}, false)
).flatten().addListener(...)

```
Every time the state change DOM.select.events add a new listener without removing the old one.

If I use boubling events all works good

```
// Change DOM components to emit boub events and...
state$.map(
   state => DOM.select('[name=' + state.name + ']').events('myBEvent')
).flatten().addListener(...)
```
