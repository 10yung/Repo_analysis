Hello,

The tutorial given by the command xsh --tutorial http://xiki.com/@xiki/tutorial is telling you to go to this page. but it just answer me an error 503:
Is the tutorial broken ?

Best regards

curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above.
```
Can we please make the example command to install this through curl + bash look like following?

`curl -sSL https://xiki.com/install_xsh | bash`

This avoid putting temp files in the home dir (or whatever dir you are in when you run the command) and cluttering home directories.
Maybe it was just sudden amnesia/brainfail, but I got confused at this part in the tutorial, thinking I should search for `user` .
html/ ctrl-O doesn't open the browser.

I tested on macos and ubuntu. Neither work.
As the title says, I haven't been able to successfully install xiki on a fresh, default ubuntu 18.04 install.
There are no errors, but once the installer gets to the [last line](https://github.com/trogdoro/xiki/blob/master/install_xsh#L24), nothing seems to happen. It does appear to run the xsh process, but nothing happens

steps to reproduce:
1) run a fresh install of ubuntu 18.04
2) sudo apt-get install curl
3) run the one-line installer

To check if i missed something, I've tried the exact same steps for ubuntu 16.04. This works just fine though.

Since 18.04 is an LTS version, it would be great if the support could be addressed. I'd be happy to ferret out some more information about this issue myself, but I'm afraid I have 0 ruby experience.
Hi, 
I've tried both the one line install and the git installer

always get this:
```
Error running timer: (error "Type Alt+O (or Option+O) to reload xsh. Or quickly type esc then o, if that didn't work. Alt+M to show error message."
```
reloading don't work, so I press Alt-M
```
Symbol's value as variable is void: el4r-log-path
```
tried both with bash and zsh: no luck

installed ruby versions:
```
ruby-2.4.2-84.fc27.x86_64
ruby-devel-2.4.2-84.fc27.x86_64
```
emacs:
```
emacs-1:25.3-3.fc27.x86_64
```

any clues?
when i try to nistall it i get this error message in emacs
symbol value as variable is void
Dear all, 

I am just discovering xiki. I would like to learn how it is possible to launch a pdf viewer or any application based on the file extension instead of editing the file in typing CTRL+G
.
   + f1.pdf
   + f2.pdf

I would like to view the pdf file in typing a given ctrl sequence. Is it possible to configure xiki to do such simple task. I haven't been able to figure out how to do. I would like to avoid to type any command before the filename just jumping into the pdfviewer.
Thank you for the great tool.

When I run ```xiki --help``` or like this ```xiki -``` I get this error:
