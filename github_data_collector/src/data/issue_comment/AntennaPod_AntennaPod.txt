This has been nagging me for a while, I love chapters, but most podcasts do not have them.  But I keep on hoping and swipe to the 3rd fragment to find empty chapters.

Since most podcasts do not have chapter markers, this pull request will hide the 3rd fragment for chapters if an episode does not have chapters, but it will show the chapter markers if the playing episode has them.

This podcast `This Week In Startups` has chapter markers if you wanted to test.  Most other podcasts do not have chapter markers.

I am currently using [LineageOS 16.0 for Xperia XZ1 Compact](https://forum.xda-developers.com/xperia-xz1-compact/development/rom-lineageos-16-0-unofficial-todo-t3925675).  For some odd reason, I can't select external storage for my podcasts. 
Should fix #3758 

Is there anything more that needs to be done?
fix #3754

1) In the iTunes search feed use artistName
2) In the RSS feed from iTunes, use summary
3) In GpodnetPodcast, and Fyyd - use description

Advance search on iTunes

**Expected behaviour**:
When I search on my podcast app, it should be be smart enough to default to the local iTunes country.

On this line in file `ItunesPodcastSearcher.java`
[ITUNES_API_URL = "https://itunes.apple.com/search?media=podcast&term=%s";](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/eaa1527fac082d765524f70dadb066ba14e25524/app/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/discovery/ItunesPodcastSearcher.java#L25
)

We should change to https://itunes.apple.com/search?media=podcast&country=de&term=%s
with &country=[2 char country code]

* docs from Apple https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/Searching.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH5-SW1

**Current behaviour**:
It currently searches from the default iTunes app, but maybe there is a way to default to the country specific iTunes store first?


**App version**: 1.7.3b (from Google play)

**Android version**: 10

**Device model**: Nokia 7.1

1. Install and open antennapod

2. Import this db file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uEd4H3GMyHpda1BK3u8r-IEPr-WTbpaN/view?usp=drivesdk

Import is successful. App restarts and has the podcasts.

3. Close app

4. Open app

**Expected behaviour**:

App should open

**Current behaviour**:

App immediately crashes

**First occurred**: downgraded from beta version to stable today, tried to import my db file


Is there a good reason why we can only change the playback speed between 1.0 and 2.0? I think Pocket Casts allows speeds between 0.5x and 3.0x.

Sometimes, e.g. if you have quickly speaking foreign language speakers, you may want speeds lower than 1.0 times, and sometimes you have some blabber podcasts with slow speakers in your mother language which you would like to listen in even faster than 2.0 times speed.
**Problem you are having**:
The first screen of AntennaPod is not user friendly for the non-tech person.  Compared with other apps, the first screen lacks a discovery process without going to search.

**Suggested solution**:
1. From the first screen, 2 taps to value (or a listen)
   1. Right now, it takes 4 taps if I wanted to listen to one of the top 8 podcasts. 
   1. I suggest that we start adding the top iTunes categories by country and by category, moving the add Podcast by URL to the top right with a '+' button, move advance search also to the top right behind '+' and OPML input back into Settings or behind '+'

1.  Categories from gpodder.net should be removed, because the names are misspelled, random and doesn't give AntennaPod a good image. [A]

**Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details**:
Example from the 'Podcast Player' app from CastBox to get value with 2 taps
1) Open the app
2) A scrolling list of category with a 'more link'
3) Tab and listen immediately for value and preview.

**Steps to reproduce**:

1. Search for `podcast` in Google playstore
1. There are a bunch of apps and AtntennaPod is below many other apps with lower rating and with less downloads
1. I notice AntennaPod does not include the words `podcast` in the name or in the publisher

**Suggestion**
1. During the publication to the Google Play store change the name to include the work podcast
**name** : AntennaPod - Podcast Player : Free, Fast, No Ads
**Publisher**: AntennaPod - Podcast For Everyone, community supported

----
I think this will help with Google search ranking in Google Playstore

**Problem you are having**:
When I search for a podcast, using the iTunes search, the URL's of the feed is returned along with the title of the podcast.  The URL doesn't help me decide whether I will subscribe, instead the ~description~ artistName field is the right information to return.

**Suggested solution**:
Replace the feedurl in the search result with the ~description~ artistName.

@ByteHamster what do you think if I get a PR for the search result UI and the browsing UI to include the description?
