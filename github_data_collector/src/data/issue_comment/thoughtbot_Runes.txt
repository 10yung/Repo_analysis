It seems `SwiftCheck` has been introduced since `v4.2.2`, and it is affecting end users to always pull its unnecessary repository via Swift Package Manager:

```bash
$ cd my-project-using-runes/
$ swift build
Updating https://github.com/thoughtbot/Runes.git
Fetching git@github.com:typelift/SwiftCheck.git
...
```

I have tried both Xcode 10 (Swift 5.0) and Xcode 11 Beta (Swift 5.1), but result was the same.
It's probably due to Swift Package Manager still not able to handle test dependencies nicely.

I think there needs some workaround e.g. https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing/issues/201 .
What do you think?
It'd be nice to add some Jazzy docs to this project, and host them using github pages. We should do that as a part of the release process (see #91)
I'd like to be able to automate the release of this lib, so that we don't forget to do things like add tags, release to CocoaPods, etc. We should script this.
A single example for each operator would do a lot
