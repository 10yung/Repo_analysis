#14 

This PR introduces the class GroupOperation which can include a few ConcurrentOperations that will run in parallel. Each ConcurrentOperation is responsible for it failures and retries. Doing so doesn't change Queuer's logic at all.

Allows for such flows: `1 -> [2A || 2B || 2C] -> 3`
I have to run task A, B, C and D.
Task B needs A.
Tasks C and D need B.

I would like to run a queue in this order

1. Task A
2. Task B (needs A)
3. Task C and D in parallel (both need B)

What would be the easiest way to achieve it with Queuer?
Is it work in NSURLUploadTask in background/suspended state of app. 

I want to upload task execute in synchronize manner.  

Let's say 10 task in queue. 
It should execute in queue one by one like... 1, 2,3..etc

Need to upload thousands of images in background. 

Please advise and suggestions are greatly appreciated.
