之前那个内存爆炸的老哥就是bsds数据集放错了位置，所以我想问一下bsds的相对路径，希望您能在文档中添加一下说明，感谢
Hi, @shenwei1231 
     First, thanks for providing your code, and can you tell me how to get the output of FC2 layer in CNN?

Hi. 
I have some error using your codes.

HI there
I got the following error when trying to use the edgesDetectDL to detect edges on my images:
Error in edgesDetectDL (line 42)

Is there any solution?  
Thank you.

Dear Professor Shen

Thank you for the code. I am successfuly run your code. 
I have questions, what is the function inside edgesDetectMexCNNFeats ? 
May I see the C/C++ original function for edgesDetectMexCNNFeats and edgesNmsMex. 

How about NYUD2 dataset. As I know NYUD2 does not has boundary groundtruth. 
do you produce by yourself? what are you doing with NYUD2 depth? how is the nyud2 structure?

Thank you for your help and kindness. Looking forward to your reply.

Sincerely 

Jan Kristanto



Dear Mr. Shen,

I encountered the error: File "BSR\BSDS500\data\images\test\Thumb.jpg" does not exist.

I follow the all instructions given for proper setup and the error screenshot from MATLAB is given below.

Here is the link where I downloaded the data set which was provided in your download help too.

Thank you for your help and consideration. Looking forward to your reply soon.

Yours sincerely.

Hello,
I tried to run the code but there is a error
"Undefined function or variable 'caffe2'."
Where is the definition of the caffe2?
Thanks.
Best regards.

按说明文档来跑的，在train的时候可以，但是test的时候就出问题
我看到说
line #7: Only for training stage. This parameter indicate an absolute distance. 
        Pixels whose distance greater than this distance are regard as negative samples.
   line #8: Only for training stage. This parameter indicate an relative distance(relative to the height of ground truth, Eg: if the height of ground truth is 10 and the paprameter is 0.2, the distance is 2). 
        Pixels whose distance less than this distance are regard as positive samples
   line #9: Only for training stage. The maximum negative samples in training stage.
   line #10: Only for training stage. The maximum positive samples in training stage.
还有
line #2: Mode flag(0 or 1), 0 is testing mode and 1 is training mode
然后我就按默认参数(#2改为1)跑training mode可以
# 2改为0跑就出错

然后起吊#7，8，9，10 也不行，请问该如何改？
