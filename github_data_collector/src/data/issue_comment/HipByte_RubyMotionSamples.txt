The bird blinks when get hit

I added  a start_game button. The game only starts if the user click on start game.

I'm getting the following error when I try to run these examples on my Android: `ERROR! Cannot install an app built for API version 22 on a device running API version 19`

Where in the project files does it specify version 22, and can I just change that to 19? According to this Wikipedia chart, maybe only 1% of phones are on version 22 currently anyway https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history

The Volley example is too simple for real-world usage.

I've been banging my head for two days against the problem of sending an HTTP request with parameters. The example doesn't provide enough guidance to help.  (I'll eventually need headers too)
- Is there a way to do it with a Volley CustomRequest? I don't understand how to extend an abstract request and override the implemented methods (e.g. `getParams()`)
- Is there a way to do it with OkHTTP instead? (I've been running into this issue: https://gist.github.com/zmillman/b04dbbcbb1cf0c80acf1 )

I'm able to run this sample but it crashes almost immediately. I've narrowed it down to it being an issue with this code:

``` ruby
settings.savePassword = false
settings.saveFormData = false
settings.javaScriptEnabled = true
settings.supportZoom = false
```

If I remove those lines, the app runs fine (except the javascript stuff).

Running this with
api_version            : "21"
avd_config             : {:name=>"RubyMotion", :target=>"1", :abi=>"armeabi-v7a"}

Thanks for any help!

In Conference sample, 

``` ruby
@drawerList = Android::Widget::ListView.new(self)
@drawerList.adapter = Android::Widget::ArrayAdapter.new(self, Android::R::Layout::Simple_list_item_1, MenuTitles)
@drawerList.choiceMode = Android::Widget::AbsListView::CHOICE_MODE_SINGLE
@drawerList.dividerHeight = 0
@drawerList.backgroundColor = Android::Graphics::Color::DKGRAY
@drawerList.onItemClickListener = self
```

we can change drawerList's backgroundColor, but how to change item color?

thanks.


Just to save some headaches, anyone trying to build extensions while using  `motion-env` will have a fatal during the build   see: https://github.com/clayallsopp/motion-env/issues/1
