Some option allowing to get a glimpse of binary files would be great. May be some first N bytes in `hexdump` style as mentioned [here](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/248), may be just a few lines of the `cat`-like output.

What do you think?
If you disable the header with `--style` or with `BAT_STYLE`, an incomplete grid is shown when displaying an empty file:

```console
$ > empty.txt
$ bat --style=grid,numbers,snip empty.txt 
─────┬──────────────────────────────────────────
$
```

I have not set any `BAT_*` environment variables.

bat version: built from master (`bat --version` = 0.12.1)
Sublime syntax files for zig can be found at https://github.com/ziglang/sublime-zig-language
It would be nice if they were added to bat.
`--range` is awesome, but I was out of luck trying to view e.g. “the last 10 lines of a file”. Maybe it would be possible to make it accept negative numbers? For example `-r=-10:` would print the last 10 lines, `-r=:-1` the whole file except the last line.
None
Currently, wrapping will not work as expected if there are characters spanning multiple print-width in a line.

I haven't investigated the code, but I think that probably the print-width of a character is always assumed to be `1` in `bat`. In this case it can be fixed by properly calculating the print-width with some crates e.g. `unicode-width`.

Hi everyone,

I am having an issue when I use bat with GNU screen. The problem is that I can not see the grid, line numbers, syntax and many other bat features.

They can see it in the following screen captures: 

- Without using screen

- Using screen

Maybe is anything related to the type terminal environment value?
