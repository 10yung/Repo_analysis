 image_masked[mask_selected > 0] = noisy_color[mask_selected > 0]
IndexError: boolean index did not match indexed array along dimension 1; dimension is 640 but corresponding boolean dimension is 28

How could I solve that? Thanks!!
Tensorflow must be installed before keras. Install keras==2.1.6 to resolve "AttributeError: module 'keras.engine.topology' has no attribute 'load_weights_from_hdf5_group_by_name'".

As the title, can i use it in the python script through importing it as a python package?

Also does it run under docker envrioment?
Hi,
when I run the code on CLI ,like that
```
python person_blocker.py -i ../data/base/Images/neck_design_labels/ffc52dbfd4a5f8dae71390a68e696dd8.jpg -c '(128, 128, 128)' -o 'neck'
```
after that ,the CLI just show as follows,but not show any picture,I don't why?
```

Hi, I rewrote some parts of the writing. Hope this helps.
That is so mean.
Something like this could be cool:
https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_photo/py_inpainting/py_inpainting.html
This function automatically noises a person in an Image based on one (or more) Images of that Person.
I have added new CLI Arguments such as:
```
  -f, --facerecog       Does face recognition
  -k KNOWN_PATH, --known KNOWN_PATH
                        Path to known images
```

They should be fairly simple.
Example call would be
`python person_blocker.py -i block.jpg -f -k ./known` where 'known' is a folder with jpgs of the person you want to block.

This pull request adds the following dependencies
- opencv-python
- face_recognition (which itself has dlib as a dependency)

dlib can be installed on Windows but its a pain in the a**
