**Describe the new feature:** For some reason, importing about ~16.000 beatmaps from osu!stable takes many hours long, so even if it can't be done in a smoother way, it'd be nice to be able to pause import and resume later. Having the progression saved to continue the next time I run my PC (and osu!Lazer as well), would be the handiest.

**Proposal designs of the feature:** 'Pause Import' button and 'Resume Import' button

Prereqs:
- [ ] https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/5508
- [ ] https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/3185 (if vvv is merged)
- https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/5509 for settings support
Basically if you have in your skin's skin.ini file parameter "AnimationFramerate" osu doesn't respect it and plays animations in the speed it wants. 
# Summary

- This PR implements the `OnlineViewContainer`, a container for displaying online-only views where the user login is required.
It supports hiding its content and showing a login placeholder (implemented in #7438) if the local user is not logged in.
This component is planned to be reused to refine UX in online-only overlays (Social, Direct, Chat) instead of displaying an empty overlay

In the future will be applied to the whole overlay

implements #7518 
currently the new hyperlink in song select is bugged (cause and effect explained in the issue above). I decided not fix that as part of this PR because I consider it a separate bug and we haven't decided yet how we want to deal with it.

For now I kept the fonts as they were, but shouldn't the author name be **bold** instead of _italic_ to match the other fields (and also all other occurrences of "mapped by xy" throughout the game) ?
This is a first pass to see if this is the direction we want to go.
**Describe the bug:** The nightcore mod's audio does not sync up correctly with doubletime when the speed has been modified.
