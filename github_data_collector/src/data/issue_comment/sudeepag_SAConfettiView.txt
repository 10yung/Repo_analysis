- Update project files to adopt new default configurations in Xcode 11

I was facing issue with build fail in SAConfettiView framework version 0.1.8.

Please help me to fix this issue

Thanks

You should upgrade to cocoapods.

close #54 
Would you like to update cocoapods

Even if it corresponds to swift 4 as it is, it can not be used with cocoapods.

Thanks for this awesome library that even comes with great default images.
Could you please add retina images for the confetti, diamond, star and triangle assets?
I just changed one line to make it work with swift 4.2
