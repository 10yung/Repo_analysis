I preface that I'm quite new to C so this may be completely off. However, in:
 
https://github.com/fragglet/c-algorithms/blob/5b0555f4aa832a9d4c8662316994faa80f52ae93/src/set.c#L256-L275

the `0` return value is used both for an operation that does not change the state of a set (because the value already exists), which may or may not be an issue, and a memory error, which is more likely to be an issue, and of a different type. 

Shall the former not use a kind of custom error code, and the latter an ENOMEM according to https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Error-Codes.html ? 

Thanks.
Add CMakeLists.txt.
It can help you build.

Splint is a static code analysis tool, splint works with annotations. These annotations help you to do two things, it defines how functions behaves and which assumptions on input are made. Using splint memory leaks might be detected.

The only downside is that it is a lot of work to go through all code. But maybe it is possible to implement it data structure by data structure in a separate branch untill all structures are done. 

Yes, I know I could examine all the headers available, but it'd be nice if each documentation page listed which header(s) you need to include to use it.

At line 119 of _https://github.com/fragglet/c-algorithms/blob/master/src/avl-tree.h_, there is a function pointer for **AVLTreeCompareFunc** declared.

The declaration is:

```
typedef int (*AVLTreeCompareFunc)(AVLTreeValue value1, AVLTreeValue value2);
```

But the documentation (and code) shows that this function is for comparing the keys of two nodes in the tree, so the declaration should actually be:

```
typedef int (*AVLTreeCompareFunc)(AVLTreeKey key1, AVLTreeKey key2);
```

As both **AVLTreeKey** and **AVLTreeValue** are themselves typedefed as **void ***, it doesn’t actually make any difference to the function operation, but it makes the prototype confusing.
