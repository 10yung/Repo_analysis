In locustio 0.13.5, there is a very odd bug that prevents the setup method from using requests to make HTTP requests. When doing an HTTP POST request, the setup function unexpectedly returns. No exception is printed, but the remainder of the function does not execute. This is what my code looks like (edited down for confidentiality):

```
class MyLocust(HttpLocust):
    def setup(self):
        print('Creating test data')
    
        response = requests.post('https://my-service.company.com', json=test_data)
        assert response.status_code == 201
    
        print('Created test data')  
```

I added a try/catch to my code and apparently the `requests.post()` call throws a `GreenletExit` exception. After much consternation I was able to narrow the issue down to gevent. It appears that the `gevent._ssl3` module's call to `self._wait(self._read_event, timeout_exc=_SSLErrorReadTimeout)` on line 332 throws this `GreenletExit` error.

**Important note:** this error does not manifest in locustio 0.12.2 or lower.
Let me know if you'd like some help fixing this, I imagine it's a pretty simple one!

### Describe the bug
Related to #303, what's being reported are not milliseconds but actually `milliseconds * 10`.

### Expected behavior
For my specific case, I observe about a four-second response time for an endpoint I'm testing, but what's reported is more like 40 seconds on average.

### Actual behavior
See above.

### Steps to reproduce
self-evident

### Environment

- OS: MacOS latest
- Python version: 3.6.8
- Locust version: 0.13.5
- Locust command line that you ran: just launched it with my module
- Locust file contents (anonymized if necessary): irrelevant
Click pause during operation. The interface statistics in the report are wrong. For example, the report counts 99 times of an interface execution, but 100 times of actual execution.

- OS:
- Python version:  3.5
- Locust version: 0.12.2

### Describe the bug
- When starting locust using docker in Mac OS, I am unable to access web UI
- However it's works on Ubuntu

### Steps to reproduce
```
git clone https://github.com/locustio/locust.git
cd locust/examples/docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```
### Expected behavior
- http://localhost:8089/ should be successfully loaded from chrome

### Actual behavior
- Unable to access http://localhost:8089/ from chrome
- However if running on Ubuntu, I am able to access

### Environment settings
- OS: Macos Catalina with Docker Desktop (version 2.1.0.4)
- Python version: From latest locustio/locust docker image
- Locust version: Latest locustio/locust docker image

This PR makes a small change to how URL's are created when a Host is specified.  Previously, the URL was built by using string concatenation.  This changes it to use `urljoin`.

This fixes the edge case where a host is entered containing a trailing slash (i.e. `https://example.com/` rather than `https://example.com`).  Once merged, it should work with or without trailing a slash. 

supersedes #1216 
### Describe the bug

Autoscaling of slaves feature was added by enabling the recalculation and update of users per slave when a new slave connects. But in my testing the first slave always has a considerably higher amount of users running from it.

### Expected behavior

Every slave should be running roughly the same amount of users after rebalancing.

### Actual behavior

The first slave is at 23 users and 70% CPU where the others are at 2-8 users and 10-30% CPU.

```

### Steps to reproduce

Run a load test, autoscale slaves from 1 to 10+.

### Environment settings

- OS: Docker image on k8s
- Python version: official docker image
- Locust version: `0.13.5`


### Describe the bug
I have a locustfile like this. The LightSet and HeavySet 's on_stop method is never called.
The background is, I want to do some cleanup works in LightSet and HeavySet respectively.
Is there anyway to do it?

```python

from locust import HttpLocust, task, TaskSet, constant


class LightSet(TaskSet):
    @task(1)
    def light_1(self):
        print('Light 1')

    def on_stop(self):
        print('Light stop')


class HeavySet(TaskSet):
    @task(1)
    def heavy_1(self):
        print('Heavy 1')

    def on_stop(self):
        print('Heavy stop')


class LightAndHeavySet(TaskSet):
    tasks = {LightSet: 2, HeavySet: 8}


class User(HttpLocust):
    task_set = LightAndHeavySet
    wait_time = constant(1)
    host = 'localhost'

```

### Expected behavior

The LightSet and HeavySet 's on_stop should be called.

Or there is a workaround to do the cleanup for child TaskSet.

### Actual behavior
The LightSet and HeavySet 's on_stop is not called.
I cannot find a way to do it(By looking at Docs and StackOverflow).

### Steps to reproduce

### Environment settings

- OS: Mac OS
- Python version: 3.7
- Locust version: 0.13.5

Steps:
Start a test in master/slave mode ie.
locust -f test.py --no-web --host http://example.com -t 10  --csv-full-history --csv master --master
Then start a slave
locust -f test.py --no-web --host http://example.com  --slave

**### Describe the bug**
Latest version - While spawning a distributed cluster of around 1000 slaves per master, seeing slowness in the way slaves register to master. Till 550- 600 slaves it happens within seconds but after that 2 slaves( 1 VM is of 2 core ) register to master every second. 
Due to this overall it takes too much time to spawn a cluster of 1000 slaves. 

This issue was clearly not present in version 0.8a2 and is present in the latest version. 
I have a setup of 1000 virtual machines( 2 core each ) on Azure and requirement is to setup big clusters of 1000 unique external IPs to do the test. 
I am easily able to reproduce this in latest version of locust with python 2.7 and also 3.5.3 


For the time being I rolled back to 0.8a2 version of locust and everything seems to be working fine and I am able to spawn the same cluster with same set of scripts. 

- OS: Debian 9
- Python version: 2.7, 3.5.3
- Locust version: latest
