GitHub changed the way Markdown headings are parsed, so this change fixes it.

See [bryant1410/readmesfix](https://github.com/bryant1410/readmesfix) for more information.

Github updated its markdown so you need a space between '#' and the text
I have node downloaded but still cannot add scripts with program as /bin/node. Any ideas?

I just downloaded Today Scripts for the first time.

I have the "Welcome" notification which I can't edit, and when I try to hit the +Add button no new script is added.

I installed it and tried to configure it, but I was not able to do anything with it.

See screencast: https://www.dropbox.com/s/3i8u683yii7q6zd/Today%20Scripts%20bug.mov?dl=0

Finally it will freeze, only killing notification center helps.

Is it possible somehow to interact with a custom widget? I would like to have a text box, I can fill with a string. Then the script should use my string as an argument. 

For example I would use my custom dictionary program: I fill the text box with the word, then enter, then my python code would show me the answer.
