## Viewer can't break the line on LF
If I have a line break with only a line feed char (LF) the viewer doesn't break my line.
I'm using markdown for notes shared between Windows and Linux so I can have files with the LF terminator only instead of the more classic CR LF.
In this case I'm forced to put tag <br> to break the line or a double LF.

Is it possible to change the viewer behaviour to recognize the LF as a normal line breaker?

I am using the latest notepad++ and the latest viewer. I have copied the text below into the editor 4 times. The result is not always 4 identical blocks. Sometimes there is a <p> tag within the <li> tag.


# Language
- download a language style, e.g. userDefinedLang-markdown.default.modern.xml 
  from https://github.com/Edditoria/markdown-plus-plus
- language / define your language / import the file
- in ext add the txt extension
- restart notepad++
- bold, and italic formatting will actually displayed
- remove language
	- language / define your language / select language / remove
	- does not work
	- first rename the language then remove it
I am using the latest notepad++, and lthe atest viewer plugin.

My file contains some code:

			<parser
				id         ="txt_Heckl_syntax"
				displayName="txt_Heckl_syntax"> 
				<function mainExpr="^(H1|H2|H3|H4|H5).*$">
				</function>
			</parser>  

The tabs are rendered as spaces (or very short tabs) in the view panel. The html export works as expected.
This is a feature request. It would be useful if the functionList.xml is created for markdown files. If headings is regarded as functions then it would be easy to navigate between them.
## Issue description
Typing is not updating the preview pane (on-the-fly rendering) - close and re-open it and the markdown is rendered as expected. 
Works fine in Notepad++ v 7.6.6, so I've had to downgrade.
I reported this as an NPP bug as I suspect the update of Scintilla is the cause, but the report was closed and I was asked to report it as an issue with this plug-in.

How to make text-align justify in markdownï¼Ÿ
I installed the latest plugin release to my plugins directory per the instructions and I see no difference in Notepad++. No button on toolbar, no submenu in Plugins menu, etc...its as though I never installed it.

## Issue description
When I use dashes to insert a bulleted list - it inserts additional `<p>` and `</p>` within `<li>` - which doesn't look well. It doesn't happen if I use asterisks to do the same (insert a bulleted list).
