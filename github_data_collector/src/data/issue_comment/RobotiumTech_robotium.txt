Trying to run a new robotium test I get this error. Does anyone know how to fix it?

I've all the APIs needed. (15 and a lot of higher APIs). What am I missing?

This is part of my gradle file:

`android {
    compileSdkVersion 25
    buildToolsVersion "25.0.2"

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.centervue.exam"
        minSdkVersion 19
        targetSdkVersion 25
        // DO NOT PUT HERE VERSION NAME, THX. Change the Manifest

        testInstrumentationRunner "android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"

        ndk {
            moduleName "exam_filter"
            ldLibs "log", "jnigraphics"
        }
        renderscriptTargetApi 18
        renderscriptSupportModeEnabled true
    }
[...]`

I am testing it on Android API level 28 device. still getting this issue.

Is this project using continuous integration services (e.g., Travis-CI or Jenkings)? Or has it used at any point of its lifetime?
The following test works fine on API 22 (Lollipop) to 26 (Oreo 8.0) and also 28 (P). But for some reason it does not work on API 27 (Oreo 8.1).

1. Open Google Map
2. Display Toast
3. assertTrue("toast message");
4. Close Google Map
5. Open Google Map
6. assertFalse("toast message");

It always fails at 6. Any ideas?

When I use typetext()  to verify edittext limit conditions , I found that the order of text is wrong.
my code:
`Edite text = solo.getEditText(0);
solo.setText(text,"");
solo.typeText(text,'2.2222');
assertEquals("2.22", text.getText().toString());`

but I get actual result is 22.22 not 2.22
how can I avoid this situation?
thank you in advance!

After start test, application not started automatically for testing. I must manually launch application by tap on icon.

Error by timeout:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Text string: 'Some button' is not found!

My test:
DeliveryActivity is not first Activity in backstack when application launched.
```
public class DeliveryActivityTest extends ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2 {

  private Solo solo;

  public DeliveryActivityTest() {
    super(DeliveryActivity.class);
  }

  public DeliveryActivityTest(Class<DeliveryActivity> activityClass) {
    super(activityClass);
  }

  public void setUp() throws Exception {
    super.setUp();
    injectInstrumentation(InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation());

    Instrumentation mInstrumentation = getInstrumentation();
    solo = new Solo(mInstrumentation);
    //solo = new Solo(getInstrumentation(), getActivity());
    //solo = new Solo(getInstrumentation(), getActivity());
  }

  @Override
  public void tearDown() throws Exception {
    solo.finishOpenedActivities();
  }

  public void testButton()
  {
    solo.clickOnText("Some button");
  }

}
```
