  Hi, first thanks for great library.
  I have  a question, did you provide emptyView method? 
close #73 
close #161 
/// Footer notice method
    func  noticeNoMoreData() {
        self.base.footer?.stopRefreshing()
        self.base.footer?.noMoreData = true
        
        ///issues add
        if let footer = self.base.footer ,footer.alpha < 1.0{
            self.base.footer?.alpha = 1.0
        }
    }
这是 因为这个时候footer的透明度还是0
所以需要修改alpha值
下拉直接失效
Currently, when I pull to refresh with a large title the navigation bar immediately shrinks to normal size and stays normal size while the pull to refresh is displayed. As soon as the pull to refresh ends the navigation bar grows back to the size for a large title. Is there a way to get a large navigation bar to stay the correct size while pull to refresh header is shown?
