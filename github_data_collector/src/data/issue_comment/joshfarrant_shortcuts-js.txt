**Checks**

- [X] I've checked there are no linting errors.
- [X] I've checked the code is still at 100% test coverage.


**Added Actions (if relevant)**

- `addToDo`


**Are you happy to be listed as a contributor on [Shortcuts.fun](https://shortcuts.fun)?**

Yes


**Any other information / comments**

I love that you ask here about how it was to contribute. Before seeing this, I made an issue, [here](https://github.com/joshfarrant/shortcuts-js/issues/331). This is from my experience contributing for the first time here.
I tried adding an action. Here is what I had difficulties with, maybe it could be a point of possible improvement.

- [ ] `npm test` is ran on every commit
This causes the commits to take forever to happen. The tests should be ran ideally on the PR, not per commit.

- [ ] `interfaces/WF` and `interfaces/WF/WFWorkflowActionParameters.ts` need some docs and coordination.
I had trouble understanding if I need to reuse stuff in there, if I should add more, how to name them, where to put them. I think these two need some kind of rules to know when we need to add them and how to name them.

- [ ] tslint autofix?
I got some complaints for things that tslint could actually fix for me. Maybe a script in the package.json for autofixing would be useful. Also an editorconfig file for the spacing would be useful, as I have mine with tabs by default so I had to fix the spacing on the new file I made.

- [ ] don't use default exports
With `export default`:
```
// comment.ts
const comment = () => {}

export default comment

// index.ts
import comment from './comment'
export {
  comment,
}
```
With `export`:
```
// comment.ts
export const comment = () => {}

// index.ts
export { comment } from './comment'
```
Without default, we get fewer lines, less verbosity, and now the editor can autoimport by just typing the name of the function we want to use.

- [ ] Inconsistent types with `,` and `;`
I think I saw some files using `type A = { bla: boolean, foo: string }` and some using `interface B { bla: boolean; foo: string }`. It would be nice to be consistent. I think tslint has a rule for this.

- [ ] `|` in types
I saw types like:
```
type A =
  'foo'
  | 'bla'
  | 'blu'
```
A better way to write this is:
```
type A =
  | 'foo'
  | 'bla'
  | 'blu'
```
It's easier to read, understand, and easier to run a sort func, like in vim.

I hope some of these make sense. These are just my suggestions, take for here what you like. I'm happy to discuss more about any of these. Thanks. :)
- [ ] These actions aren't already listed in the 'All Actions to be implemented' issue [here](https://github.com/joshfarrant/shortcuts-js/issues/6).
- [ ] These actions haven't already been requested in another issue.
- [ ] Fill out the information below, deleting the examples in italics.

**What is the name of the app these actions are a part of?**
_Bear_

**Is this a free or paid app?**
_Free_

**Please list all of the actions this app exposes.**
- _Search in Bear_
- _Create Bear Note_
- _...etc_

**Provide a link to download a .shortcut file containing as many of these actions as possible.**
_[iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/94bde3696d104b5db47ee192d3ea8b02)_

I guess that's it then? :(
The contribution guide assumes some knowledge of the node ecosystem, which can be a barrier to those whoâ€™ve not worked with node and npm before. It could be useful to add a bit of information to the guide on how to install/build/run the project locally.

This json file contains information about every default action in shortcuts 2.1.2, it was extracted from the shortcuts app by xAlien95 on the r/shortcuts discord.

JSON file: https://pastebin.com/raw/7y7D0nvC

An example action:

```json
"is.workflow.actions.gettext": {
	"ActionClass": "WFTextAction",
	"ActionKeywords": [
		"text",
		"such text",
		"very speech",
		"much words",
		"so wow",
		"string"
	],
	"Category": "Text",
	"Description": {
		"DescriptionSummary": "Passes the specified text to the next action."
	},
	"IconName": "Text.png",
	"Name": "Text",
	"Output": {
		"Multiple": false,
		"OutputName": "Text",
		"Types": [
			"NSString"
		]
	},
	"Parameters": [

			"Class": "WFTextInputParameter",
			"DefaultValue": "",
			"Key": "WFTextActionText",
			"Multiline": true,

},
```



Great job!

Is there a chance to add the ImportQuestion option?

Thank you!
