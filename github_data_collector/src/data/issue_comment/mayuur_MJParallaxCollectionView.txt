I can't seem to get it working.

I tried this:

```
UICollectionViewFlowLayout *layout=[[UICollectionViewFlowLayout alloc] init];


    parallaxCollectionView=[[UICollectionView alloc] initWithFrame:r collectionViewLayout:layout];
    parallaxCollectionView.delegate=self;
    parallaxCollectionView.dataSource=self;
    [parallaxCollectionView registerClass:[MJCollectionViewCell class] forCellWithReuseIdentifier:@"MJCell"];

    [self.view addSubview:parallaxCollectionView];
```

Added support for iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s plus

Hi Mayuur,
The effect MJParallaxCollectionView is amazing and elegant. Like it very much; thus, I did some simplified modification and make image loading asynchronously. Just guess you would probably like to take the commit for references.

Cheers,

Allen

Can you add cocoapods supported?
