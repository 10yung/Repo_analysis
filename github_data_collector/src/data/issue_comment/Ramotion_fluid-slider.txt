Hi. How can I use color gradients for slider background color?
I just downloaded iOS 13.1 and build my app with the new Xcode 11. The Slider does not work at all. It is impossible to slide, and the nob does not bounce well, and when I do not do anything, the slider looks like this.

I can't figure out 
`sliderAge.attributedTextForFraction = { fraction in
            let formatter = NumberFormatter()
            formatter.minimum = 18
            formatter.maximumIntegerDigits = 3
            formatter.maximumFractionDigits = 0
            let string = formatter.string(from: (fraction * 80) as NSNumber) ?? ""
            print("string\(string) , friction\(fraction) , \((fraction * 500))")
            return NSAttributedString(string: string, attributes: [.font: CalmUtility().setFont(type: .Bold, size: 12), .foregroundColor: UIColor.black])
        }`
can you please let me know how to set fraction to 18-80 for age range 
Hello I am getting multiple issues with the carthage integration of this project in my app when submitting the app to the AppStore as follows:

```
App Store Connect Operation Error
CFBundleIdentifier Collision. There is more than one bundle with the CFBundleIdentifier value 'com.facebook.pop' under the iOS application 'MyApp.app'.
```

```
App Store Connect Operation Error
Invalid Bundle. The bundle at 'MyApp.app/Frameworks/Slider.framework' contains disallowed nested bundles.
```
```
App Store Connect Operation Error
Invalid Bundle. The bundle at 'MyApp.app/Frameworks/Slider.framework' contains disallowed file 'Frameworks'.
```

I am copying the frameworks using the carthage utilities. So I am wondering what I am doing wrong here. If I don't copy them it just doesn't work.

I am using Xcode 10.2 and Carthage 0.33.0
Hi all,

is there a method of adding a second popup bubble to the slider to create a range function ?
I want to create a popup bubble for the minimum value and one for the maximum value.
If yes, can somebody give me an example.
Thanks a lot!
iOS 9 support
and the support for assigning the text value to the value view through api 
slider.setValueViewText(NSAttributedString)
When you move the slide to the end, you see the angled shape in the corner.
The used phone is iPhone X.

There are mixed tabs and spaces indentations on Example app ViewController.
It doesn't matter much with Xcode, but on Github, it makes hard to read the code.

I Replaced tabs with spaces.
