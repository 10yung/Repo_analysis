Hi! This is a really fantastic effort. Thanks for maintaining it!

I noticed the RiffStation website in the "Why MIR" section seems to no longer be active: https://www.riffstation.com/ -- thought I'd drop an issue to notify.

I was following the tutorials step by step doing nothing but copy-pasting then I encountered a weird situation. When I was on basic feature extraction, my visual outputs of zero crossing rate and spectral centroid were different than it's supposed to be in tutorial. You can see the differances below 
(my output - tutorial output in order)

I'm sure I did nothing different and restarted&did it all again three times just in case, the result didn't change. Also my input hasn't been touched and I can confirm that they match in the first visuals (plt.figure part).

what may be causing this differance? thanks in advance

Hello, 
    Your codes are actually written in python2. But in the readme, you told user to download anaconda python3.x. This causes SyntaxError in every print statement, and it's really annoying...

It would be much more accessible.
The new website looks great.  Please note that the *NMF Audio Mosaicing* link is broken on the front page.
