Hello community

I got a new Problem but im not sure im right thinking about the reason of my fail message.
I got all worked. Esp working fine, Arduino working fine, OTA works while testing with Blink Sketch without any problems in IDE. 
Folder "arduino_build_649279" where the hex is into have 2,84 MB with all Folder and Files and the uploaded hex is 211kb big.

Thank you for your help
I am using ESP12 with Atmega to communicate with controller. There are 2 ESP12, 

ESP connected with Atmega is in AP mode and ESP connected with controller is in STA mode (it is configured to connect to AP automatically on start up)

What i want is to be able to show the status of the connection between atmega and Controller (led is green if its connected red if not) 

Is this possible or do we have an option where any of the GPIO pin sets to HIGH/LOW when a node is connected to ESP.  
I recently flashed esp-link to a D1 Mini clone and wired it into a consumer product that has an AllWinner R16 SoC and AXP233 PMIC. Everything worked fine out of the box except I had to issue a uC reset to get the SoC to actually enter FEL mode after setting it up to do so. I found that esp-link driving the RESET/PWROK line high was interfering with the SoC's watchdog reset. I changed all instances where esp-link drives the reset pin high to disabling output so it floats, and now the SoC is entering FEL mode as expected.

My question is why has esp-link been designed to drive reset high while idle? If a uC requires a specific powerup sequence, this would interfere with that. If the uC doesn't require a powerup sequence, the reset pin would have been pulled high on the board the uC is attached to anyway.
It would be nice if the webserver had an inbound interface to read and toggle GPIO pins arbitrarily.

Basically, I would like to be able to do something of that ilk:

```
$ curl 'http://myesplink/gpio?pin=12'
pin=12, status=on
$ curl 'http://myesplink/gpio?pin=12&set=off'
pin=12, status=off
```

I apologize if I have missed this someplace in the menus or notes and it's already a feature...

I found a device that uses true RS232 signalling at TTL levels that I want to interface to ESP-link, and to do that I need to invert the signaling back to TTL serial with an bi-directional inverter.

If the ESP8266 UART hardware supports inverted signalling, can that be a new feature to avoid a piece of hardware in between ?
Hello, I flashed esp-link on an ESP01 device, trying to communicate with an arduino board trough a ground station (Mission Planner), I can connect easily in TCP on port 23, but would prefer to use UDP instead. The android board is supposed to communicate over UDP on port 14550.
Is it something possible with the esp-link firmware ?
Thanks for your help
hi everybody


after flash i cont find ssid nowhere what i did wrong?
i followed this:

but i tried many solution on windows too
thanks for answers
Please update SDK to [v3.0.1](https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_NONOS_SDK/archive/v3.0.1.zip).
Hello. I'm excited about esp-link, but I'm not sure if it's what I need. Looking for some help!

I have a projector which communicates via RS232. I have a level shifter in place, attached to my ESP8266. I've loaded the esp-link firmware onto the ESP and lo and behold, from the console I can type a few commands to turn the projector on or off, and to query status of the projector.

I want this to be automatic. I've been searching the documentation (and other websites) and it seems possible, but I just cannot tell /how/. Any help? 

Many thanks!
Using master rev. 09474e6 I can't run make because Pyhton 3.8 fails running gen_appbin.py:
`  File "/var/tmp/esp_iot_sdk_v2.1.0/tools/gen_appbin.py", line 55
    print 'file_name cannot be none\n'`

When I force `make` to use Python 2.7 instead it runs.

The above error is prevalent in that script (missing brackets).
