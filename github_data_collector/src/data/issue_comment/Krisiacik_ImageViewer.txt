function viewDidLayoutSubviews line 94
`let isLandscape = itemView.bounds.width >= itemView.bounds.height` 

this is not the device direction
It would be nice if there was a way to prompt the user for delete confirmation before an image is deleted. I was thinking we could add a separate delegate method called `shouldRemoveGalleryItem` so we could make sure that the user wants to delete. I've created a PR [here](https://github.com/Krisiacik/ImageViewer/pull/234).

Another option is to make `GalleryImageViewController.deleteItem` a public method so we can supply our own delete button in the header or footer and call the `deleteItem` method ourselves. I didn't create a PR for this option but let me know what you think.
Add delegate method `shouldRemoveGalleryItem` so users can be presented with an alert prior to deleting an image. `shouldRemoveGalleryItem` has a default implementation so that existing users of this library remain unaffected.

is it possible to load image using URL instead of download to UIImageView first ?

When I swipe really fast on the image viewer to dismiss it, sometimes it doesn't do the smooth sliding dismiss animation, but jumps up and down then disappears. It looks like a glitch. See the gif:

@Krisiacik This is a great open source project, but it looks like it's dying due to lack of updates. I know how hard it is to keep up with issues and PRs. Would you consider moving this repo to Github organization and/or allow other developers commit access? That way more people could help to maintain this project and keep it alive. It would be a shame for it to die.
When testing our app with iOS 13 we see that hiding the status bar no longer works. Looking into the source code I can see you move the application window above the statusbar window which seems not to work anymore.
