The core_js encapsulated in the event listener gets executed on any subsequent turbolinks visit. This triggers accumulating `Uncaught Error: Highcharts error #13: www.highcharts.com/errors/13` errors. Like the Turbolinks < 5 code, we should remove our event listener the first time the listener executes.

With Turbolinks 5, if it doesn't add `data-turbolinks-eval="false"` to script tag, script is evaluated many times (each per pages loading). So I've fixed it.
I see documents that refer to how to specify data on highcharts.However, I really don't find that on highstocks even though this gem supports highstocks.

Does this gem support the x-range graph? If so how do I use it?

Because of [this commit](https://github.com/michelson/lazy_high_charts/commit/2244183ef5434c4ca21e9db6c68fa99e9c8d0851#diff-444776473ffa7ec09fa3f09dcb25b0dbR43) by @jacksonh lazy_high_charts may now fail on `data.map` if data is nil.
How do I implement drilldown using lazy_high_charts?
Hi.
I referred to your clickable bar chart wiki. The explanation does not suffice my requirement and I would need further help.
My desired output
Bar chart renders on the browser. User clicks a particular bar which calls a function in the controller and takes an action. I want to know how to link the controller method with the onclick event of the bar chart.

Thanks,
Anant
After which line I should add this "//= require highcharts/modules/drilldown" in application.js?
When hash[key] is nil, then it raise `NoMethodError` in `#format_data` method.
So I've fixed it, and in addition tiny refactoring.
