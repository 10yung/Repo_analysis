I need some help from you all,
Is it possible to edit the **floorplan size while clicking the size** (ref : https://prnt.sc/os15w2),

===========================================
Need to know whether we can edit sizes by **double clicking in the front end itself**.

Thanks in Advance,

Hey,
When I edit the floor plan, to make a bigger room for example, items in my room will not move. Funny thing is, if I drag them outside of the room, they start moving and isValidPosition function returns true OUTSIDE of the room.
