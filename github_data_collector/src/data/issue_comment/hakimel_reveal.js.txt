A slide like this:
```
<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
\```javascript
function () {
  // Note: This is gonna break the output
}
\```
  </textarea>
</section>
```
(without the backslashes at the front of ```) is not gonna correctly show the code block, because the `Note:` is replaced with some html element (I guess some markdown formatting). Might be related to #2174.
**Summary**
Update `node-sass` to `^4.13.1` to fix security vulnerability that was recently fixed by the maintainers  of `node-sass`

My slide is like this

The slide is centered in the middle of the page and cannot occupy the whole page. It looks too small. How to make it occupy the whole page.
I'd like to be able to use <a href="#otherslide">go to other slide<a>

and then on the 'other slide' have a link that would take me back to the first slide.  The problem I have is that the 'other slide' can be linked to from a number of slides, so I need the "return" link to be dynamic.
Hi! :slightly_smiling_face: 

This Pr simplifies code contributions by fully automating the dev setup with Gitpod(A free online vs code like ide). With a single click, it will launch a ready to code workspace with all the dependencies being pre-installed & the script for starting the dev server in process so that anyone interested in contributing can start straight away without wasting time on the setup.

You can give it a try on my fork of the repo via the link below:

Hi,
I am wondering if one can change the way how slides are navigating by pressing the space key to enter (return) key.
Thanks for your help in advance. 

The data-autoslide attribute for automatic timed triggering of a sequence of fragments does not work for mobile browsers like Chrome, Firefox, UC and QQ. It is possible to trigger each event manually by gesture, though.
Add some codes to make the equation can be numbered automatically.
To be noted, not all equations will be numberd, just for equations who start with `\begin{equation}` or `\begin{align}` which is totally same with the LaTeX syntax.
I think it'll be vary helpful for people who need to insert too many equations in slides.
I've followed the initialization steps for parallax and I cannot get it to work. A background is shown, it just doesn't change.

Do you have an actual example of a presentation with parallax working? The smaller, of course, the better :)
