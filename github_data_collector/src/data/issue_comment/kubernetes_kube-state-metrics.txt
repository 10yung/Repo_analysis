**What happened**:
Upgraded kube-state-metrics from 1.8.0 to 1.9.2
after upgrade, kube-state-metrics observed a panic:
[kube-state-metrics.log](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/files/4066544/kube-state-metrics.log)

**What you expected to happen**:
the new version doesn't work with this version of k8s

**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:
install docker 18.9 and run kube-state-metrics with the flag --kubeconfig

**Anything else we need to know?**:
This was tested running k8s v1.16.3 with centOS VM


**Environment**:
- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): 1.16.3
- Kube-state-metrics image version 1.9.2

I deploy a po named curl-xxxx, and I can get the cpu and memory that this pod used by kubectl top,
but I can't get  cpu or mem resource by "kube_pod_container_resource_requests_cpu_cores" of kube-state-metrics , why?

We were not setting the kube_hpa_status_current_metrics_average_value when the metric source was External.

## Proposal
**Use case. Why is this important?**
Docker Content Trust allows us to verify if the images downloaded are indeed the images that Kubernetes published. Security measures can be setup to only download signed images.

This goes for all Kubernetes images, not just specific to this repository.

Is there any particular reason why signed images haven't been added, or is it simply a feature which hasn't been looked into yet?

https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/

**What this PR does**:

Aim of this PullRequest is to add several new pod metrics:
- kube_pod_deleted: Unix deletion timestamp
- kube_pod_status_reason: The pod status reasons (NodeLost, Evicted)
These new metrics can be used to determine the `pod.status.phase`
displayed by `kubectl`: Running, Terminated, Unknown…
It will allow removing the `kubectl` display logic added previously
to compute the “Unknown” phase.

https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/blob/d35e7ba89478779515fea87d2daf7ec369ff80fc/internal/store/pod.go#L288

**why we need it**:

In some cases, a Pod can be stuck in the "Terminating" phase due to a "Kubelet" issue; for example: the Kubelet is not able to communicate with the container runtime, or the container runtime is not able to delete the associated container.

And so, it can be interesting to have a way to create an alert on this kind of "bad" Pod state, which is currently not possible to do since the pod is flag by `kube_pod_status_phase` metrics as "Running".

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Fixes #979

@LiliC I made a start on this and I can't see anything else that I would consider "non-identifying" labels.

I also wondered about the removal of node name from metrics re cpu/mem usage, perhaps it is still valid there?
