Not sure if I'm just doing something wrong here but I tried running the algorithm today on a dummy tileset I made and got some results I wasn't expecting. I've uploaded a zip file with what I was using here: [Base.zip](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse/files/4017847/Base.zip)

I modified samples.xml with this entry:
```xml 
<simpletiled name="Base" width="3" height="3"/>
```

I also had to modify the for loop in Main.cs to let me run the algorithm 10,000 times as there seemed to be a lot of contradictions. One of the results I got looked like this:

I don't understand how I got this though, as there are no neighbor constraints that include base_corner_1 on both the left and the right.
Hi,

I'm trying to add a tile to my tileset that does not have symmetry. Here is the tile:

![diagonal2straight](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9029686/39084952-897b7280-4574-11e8-8ed2-8e5317f22bbc.png)

I believe that this tile has none of the symmetry types (X, I, L, etc). Please correct me if I am wrong! However, I cannot seem to define this in the data.xml file; In fact, is it true that because of this line:
https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse/blob/fad1066b5000f7e9fbda0ef81bbea56799686670/SimpleTiledModel.cs#L64
There is not currently an option for a tile with no symmetry?
Thanks!
