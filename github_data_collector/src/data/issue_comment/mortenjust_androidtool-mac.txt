2019-02-22 08:06:15.245124+0800 AndroidTool[21601:1245248] [access] This app has crashed because it attempted to access privacy-sensitive data without a usage description.  The app's Info.plist must contain an NSCameraUsageDescription key with a string value explaining to the user how the app uses this data.
I don't know if it's possible with the actual SDK, but to be possible to make a screenshot of the entire screen include the entire scroll.

If you can, would be awesome !!
The latest version of AndroidTool is still a 32-bit app. Apple will quit support for 32-bit apps after Mojave (10.14). Is this software still maintained? 
Hey I just noticed that you accepted my last pull request in October.

Back in Jan of 2018 I thought you abandoned the project and made a bunch of changes on my fork. I don't know if you are interested in taking these changes in or if you were interested in keeping the project alive.
I'm using Mac Sierra 10.13.6 and Google Pixel XL (Running on Android Pie), The screen capture is work correctly, but can't record screen.
I've pressed Record button but it not update recording state and can't create result video in my Desktop.
Screenshot below

@mortenjust There are two open PRs, is it worth a community fork, or would you be open to adding other individuals as contributors?
Is that correct?

That appears to be the same limit in Android Studio so it looks like you haven't been able to get around that limitation.
First of all Thanks for this great tool! I would like to check if there are command line options for capturing screenshots and recording. These options would definitely are the added advantages in the app automation.
