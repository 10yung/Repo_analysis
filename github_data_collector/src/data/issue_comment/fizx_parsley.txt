Hi,

Building the latest version (e4cebc7b076bb0fd789e6c8268e255d5a6aff7cc) on OSX 10.10.1 with Homebrew/Xcode/Gcc throws this:

```
parsley.c:753:6: error: conflicting types for '__parsley_recurse'
void __parsley_recurse(contextPtr context) {
```

I just fixed by sticking a definition in parsley.h but I'm guessing from the name that it might not be the way you intended.

diff --git a/parsley.h b/parsley.h
index ac927c6..1167185 100644

Thanks again for open-sourcing this.

Hi there!

This is WhitespaceBot. I'm an [open-source](https://github.com/Gunio/WhitespaceBot) robot that removes trailing white space in your code, and gives you a gitignore file if you didn't have one!  

Why whitespace? Whitespace is an eyesore for developers who use text editors with dark themes. It's not  a huge deal, but it's a bit annoying if you use Vim in a terminal. Really, I'm just a proof of  concept - GitHub's V3 API allows robots to automatically improve open source projects, and that's really cool. Hopefully, somebody, maybe you!, will fork me and make me even more useful. My owner is [funding a bounty](http://gun.io/open/12/add-security-flaw-fixing-features-to-whitespacebot) to anybody who can add security fixing features to me. 

I've only cleaned your most popular project, and I've added you to a list of users not to contact again, so you won't get any more pull requests from me unless you ask. If I'm misbehaving, please email my owner and tell him to turn me off! If this is pull request is of no use to you, please just ignore it.

Thanks!

Hi,

Would like to compile parsley on OSX .. however without using ports. Any suggestions?

Joost

One of the features that I wanted to suggest is some sort of logical OR operator.

For example,
http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Swiss+Gear+-+SHERPA+Laptop+Sleeve+-+Black/Blue/8819264.p?skuId=8819264&id=1206750211247

I want the price. I'd like to have the sale price and if none is provided the original price. I've tried 3 diff ways to achieve this. The first, which I believe would probably be the best syntax for this to be implemented, comma delimited selectors.

`{
  "price": "#productpreview .salenum, #productpreview .pricenum"
}`

Then I tried 
`{
  "price?": "#productpreview .salenum",
  "price": "#productpreview .pricenum"
}`

finally because my crawling software (Scrapy) takes the first object from the list
`{
  "price": ["#productpreview .salenum, #productpreview .pricenum"]
}`

... but order is not preserved so that isn't reliable. If order was preserved this would be my second choice.

Any thoughts? or has this already been implemented?

Andrew
