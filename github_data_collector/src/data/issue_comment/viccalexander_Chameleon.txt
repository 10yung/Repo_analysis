Hi, 

On [browserleaks - javascript](https://browserleaks.com/javascript), I see that it is possible to gather those information (Color Depth / Pixel Depth). 
Knowing that some devices have specific screen resolutions and color depth, it seems to me that it can help the trackers.

- Is there a way to spoof Color depth and Pixel depth ?
- Do you think those two criteria are used for tracking (creating a browser signature) ? 

**Thanks for your answers and your great work**
Updating the framework and demos to Swift 5 using Xcode 11.2.

  
After updating the Xcode version to 11.1  In **ChameleonShorthand.swift** file getting error  **Function produces expected type 'UIColor'; did you mean to call it with '()'?**




The wip/swift4 branch is still compiling with swift5 but no longer with swift5.1.
After those simple changes it is compiling again.
Hi, I see that  you haven't updated this framework in a while. It's really great! I've updated some of the code so that it works and doesn't give you any build errors when working with Swift 5. Thanks!
Some of the colors RGB values (0.0-1.0) return 1.0+ which result in an improper hex value and color, though it appears to display the correct color.
Hi, is there any swift 5 supporting folk? 
Be able to run the project on the last version of Xcode (10.2) and with Swift 5.
