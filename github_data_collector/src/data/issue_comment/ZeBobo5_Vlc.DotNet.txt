# Summary

1. I have at least 20 cameras and I need to screenshot then at the same time without using too much resources from the computer. My best bet is to skip looking every camera rtsp stream but instead get their screenshots at interval x. Is this possible or can there be any work around?

When creating a VlcControl and playing a video file, I get a black screen with sound and the following debug output:
`main debug: picture might be displayed late (missing 9 ms)`
`main warning: picture is too late to be displayed (missing 22 ms)`
I have absolutely no idea what causes it.

I have a VLC WinForms control inside of WindowsFormsHost for my WPF application. Everything works fine in general, but before I had VlcControl embedded into my application mouse hover over application icon in taskbar showed me preview of whole application window. Right now it shows video being played inside VlcControl - what is even worse it shows only one while there are two VlcControls, so the camera preview is not even complete.

How can I stop VlcControl from taking over and display preview of whole application window as it was before?

# Summary

If I add multiple controls on a form and play a video in all I can see the videos in all controls.  However if I try to mute just one of them, they all mute.  If I try to unmute just one, they all unmute.  If a video is not playing in one of the controls and I unmute that one and mute the rest.  The rest all mute.  If I mute the one not playing a video and unmute one of the others that are playing, they all unmute.

# Summary

I have an application where I want to display a video with an alpha channel. Currently I'm using mov (Apple ProRes 4444).   
If I use Vlc.DotNet.WPF unfortunately the video is processed by CPU.  
If I use Vlc.DotNet.WinForms with WindowsFormsHost the performance is much better, but the alpha channel isn't displayed (black background).

Is there any way to use hardware acceleration and Vlc.DotNet.WPF (or the alpha channel)?
Or using Vlc.DotNet.WinForms with alpha channel support?

The alpha channel only works with mov. Is webm with VP9 not supported? Or can you suggest any other format which supports transparency and works with Vlc.DotNet?

# Summary

I am building a Windows Form App in Visual Studio, using Vlc.DotNet.Forms.

When attempting to set audio delay via `vlcControl.Audio.Delay`, nothing happens and the audio plays with no delay.

The relevant code follows:

``` C#
public void PlayMedia()
{
  vlcControl1.Audio.Delay = 1000;
  vlcControl1.Play();
}
```

The loaded media plays, but with no delay in the audio.

I am trying out Vlc.DotNet 3.0.  I placed a VLC control on my form, and when running the program, it gives an error that the VLC library directory was not specified.

Instead, it should be able to find an existing copy of VLC Media Player on your PC.

Way 1:
From Registry: "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{9BE31822-FDAD-461B-AD51-BE1D1C159921}\InprocServer32\", default key.
If the VLC ActiveX Control is installed, this key will be present, and will point to "C:\Program Files\videoLAN\VLC\axvlc.dll".   Strip off the filename, and you have the path.

Way 2:
From Uninstall Information in Registry:
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\VLC media player", key "InstallLocation"

Way 3:
From assuming a default installation path, use Program Files or Program Files x86, and go to "VideoLan\VLC" from there.

Way 4:
Check the application directory for libVLC files.
