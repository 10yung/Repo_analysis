I have added the androidx support.
I also fixed deprecated function uses.
AndroidX requires minSdk 14.
As "compile" is going to be deprecated end-2018, this PR replaces with "implementation" that is the new usage.
reset `layoutManagerType` every time you change the layout manager. to avoid wrong casting in `getLastVisibleItemPosition` method
There are no such method found
- findViewHolderForItemId
- getLayoutManager

Please add so we can use that instead of modifying it from our side
When I entered an activity page, I did not do any upswing,  but onMoreAsked started to run.
i set the true the reverse properties in layout manager 

`layoutManager =new LinearLayoutManager(getApplicationContext(), LinearLayoutManager.VERTICAL, true);`

but More Progress still in Bottom.

im trying to create List Chat
When i scroll to second last item and hold to that item OnMoreListener continuously run and executes code.

Sorry, but Is the any method to work on two different functionalities with two individual swiping mode?
Like: When I swipe left it will show a Toast of swiping left and when right it will show a Toast of swiping to right, or something like this. Please let me know.
Thanks
