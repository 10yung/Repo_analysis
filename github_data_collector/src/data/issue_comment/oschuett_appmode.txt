Often it may be advantageous to "jump in" while viewing a notebook in app mode and do some debugging in a code cell. Do you maybe have a pointer to whether or not it would be feasible to exclude one or more code cells from being hidden when app mode launches?
I love appmode, but I would like to display only certain markdown cells (e.g. the heading and the markdown that describes my dashboard).    I've been keeping two branches for this purpose (e.g. one with full markdown, one with reduced markdown), but I'm wondering whether there is a better way?
