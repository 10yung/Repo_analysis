For some dumb reason firefox is reporting this as an unwanted software site and I had to make an ecception, and even now here is still a get out of here option.
If I try to change font size, the font appears very bold.
Thank you very much for developing this.

One little thing: The directory background color is a little odd.  It is normally like this?  What does the lime green background supposed to tell us?
Would it be possible to create another VBS script to undo the changes that this makes?

hi, I found the repo from the comments in the blog post. I changed all the colors manually and decided to try out your scripts on my laptop. I ran the VP script and the fonts were installed and the powershell script ran but did not update the registry settings. They remained the same. I noticed the first line with the stars, it  is searching for things named like *ubuntu*? 

`Get-ChildItem "HKCU:\Console\*ubuntu*" | ForEach-Object {`  

There is nothing in the that folder/key matching that.  Just wanted to see if I needed edit that powershell or if this is a bug.
