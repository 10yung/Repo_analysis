When collecting data with Ascending Technologies Pelican quadrotor for 4 hours, the following Allan variance and power spectral density is produced:

This result does not reflect the anticipated Allan variance curve presented in the [IMU Sensor Model Instructions.](https://github.com/hanley6/IMUSensorModels/wiki/IMU-Sensor-Model-Instructions) The issue then is (1) why does this discrepancy exist? and (2) can the sensor model code be modified to also model this discrepancy?
