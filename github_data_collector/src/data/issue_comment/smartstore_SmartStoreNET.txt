Possible solution: save the slide after applying the template.
Hi maintainer,
I'm trying to integrate SSLCommerz (sslcommerz.com) payment gateway. To do that, I'm trying to develop a plugin. I'm facing some problem while integrating the payment method.

SSL Commerz is a  payment gateway which supports multiple channels like VISA, AMEX, MASTERCARD and other mobile banking and so on. It is required to send a "**transaction id**" while initiating a payment initially in order for the gateway to track the transaction by its id because when the gateway makes a POST request to our IPNHandler, it sends back the transaction id using which we should update the _order_ in our database. 

Now as we don't have any component to manage transactions, I want to use the **order id** as the unique identifier for tracking and mapping the transaction with the order and update the **order data** accordingly.

Now, in the _checkout_ process, the order is created after making the payment and confirmation and thus we are getting the order guid or order number at the end of the process while I needed this piece of data before initiating the payment. 

Please give me a solution regarding the problem I'm facing. I've two question:

* **Is there any other way to get the order id prior to make the payment initiation request?**
* **If I want to change the process flow in the following way**
     ** Current**:       **Cart->**->**Addresses**->**Shipping method**->**Payment**->**Confirm**->**Complete**

     **Proposed**-> **Cart**->**Addresses**->**Shipping method**->**Confirm**->**Order Complete**->**Payment**->**Payment complete**->**Invoice shown/sent**

Here the order creation is completed before the payment step. the order status is **initiated** at creation time. As soon as the user selects the payment method and enters data, the status will automatically changed.
