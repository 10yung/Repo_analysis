**Bug**: Sometimes the main window loses focus which causes it to scroll when the spacebar is hit, even in insert mode. Really annoying because you hit the spacebar a lot when typing a sentence.

**How to reproduce**:
1. Start with more bullets than can be displayed in the main window so that scrolling is enabled
2. Scroll to the middle of the page such that the scroll bar indicates there is room to scroll up and down. 
3. Create a new bullet with a few words
4. Go to the beginning of any word in the new bullet and do the motion "c e" to delete to end of word and go to insert mode.
5. Type another word and go back to command mode.
6. Press spacebar. This should cause scrolling.

**Expected behavior**: When pressing spacebar in step 6 above, no scroll occurs.

I was using vimflowy through a local docker instance on Chrome Version 77.0.3865.120
Hi,

Great work with this cool tool but I'm missing it on my phone. I think this could be quite easily supported with the export to .org file which app like [orgzly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orgzly) can take. What do you think guys?
First of...love this ..nice work...please don't stop working on it :) - This has potential for folks who are security conscious (I am a CISSP) and work with sensitive data, and for regulatory or other reasons cannot store certain things in workflowy or other online note tools (running this in docker on a laptop..very fast and nice)...Also I have been a heavy spacemacs org user, so many of these keybinding are natural..nice.  - secondly I have a simple text block question. 

I know that you can "Shift+enter" text under a bullet to add "notes" in a similar way to workflowy. But how about a code block or just pasting text? It seems when pasting, it just makes a bunch of blocks, and does not  keep the text inside the "block" but makes several siblings essentially with each line. I presume its related to line breaks, and may be something simple, but so far I have not found a quick way to preserve a text block under a "bullet" (admittedly I am still new and exploring). 

Any tips appreciated. I like to keep my KB if possible in one source for quick search. 
Hello again! I'm trying to use a zapier integration to add new items under my 'inbox' bullet every time a google spreadsheet row is added. This as a round about way of implementing gtd capture. 
1. IFTTT for 'add ______ to my inbox' to google assistant puts '_________' into a google spreadsheet.
2. Zapier notices the new row and pulls '_________' and creates a new bullet under 'inbox'. 

That's the idea anyways. I can't really get it to work. Where I am stuck is Zapier wants a path. The example they give is "foo/bar/here". I've done my best googling and tried to find somewhere to lookup on the firebase website what the file path could be. No luck. :( Is there a way to pull the file path from the firebase website? I'm at a loss here. If I can figure this out Vimflowy gains a huge amount of power though! :D
Running docker image behind apache server, I get the error:
```
Socket connection closed!

Error: Socket connection closed!
    at WebSocket.ws.onclose (https://vimflowy.mydomain.com/build/app.js:81:335053)
```

running the docker on port 3010 and then doing a proxypass and proxypassreverse etc using following:

```
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:3010/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:3010/
    ProxyPass "/websocket/"  "ws://localhost:3010/websocket"
    ProxyPass "/websocket/" "wss://localhost:3010/websocket"
```
I have tried variations to above configuration by commenting line 4 and / or 5, removing websocket in end of 4 and 5 but no joy. I am certain it is the Apache config that is causing this issue but I dont know how / what do i need to change. I have to use Apache and cannot use Caddy as shown in the example

see https://github.com/rococode/vimflowy/issues/9
Error:

Features:
- Create a node anywhere with "GTD" text in it and started adding your gtd
tags. ("#next", "#today", "#soon").
Adding tags like #today, #next, #soon gets automatically cloned in GTD
node with their topics on calling the trigger keyboard shortcut (default: ctrl+t).

Hi! Thank all the contributors for the great project, it's awesome.

I'm using system default input method in win10 and found I could input Chinese characters
 normally but **got nothing when I trying to input any punctuation in Chinese input mode**, I hit keys like "," or "." and nothing happened.

It means I have to switch to English mode, enter English punctuation, and switch back to Chinese mode to continue, and I just can't input any Chinese punctuation...

I tried Japanese input method, it failed as well.

It's ok to copy & paste Chinese punctuation from outside.

Any suggestions? Thanks.
Set up: 
* Vimflowy docker image: e532b43eb2f0
* SQlite storage backend

I host my own vimflowy server with the SQlite backend.

When I transition from being online to offline vimflowy encounters an error:

```
Socket connection closed!
g</t.prototype.init/</</this.ws.onclose@http://flametip.asuscomm.com:3000/build/app.js:46:117990
```

Which makes sense, the websocket connection to the server is closed. What'd be great is if Vimflowy transitions to local storage and then sync changes when it comes back online.

The more general case of conflict resolution of multiple edits using something like operational transforms or CRDTs is probably out of scope and overkill, a simple latest edit wins might be sufficient to implement the desired functionality


P.S cheers for Vimflowy, it's an awesome project merging two things I love!
