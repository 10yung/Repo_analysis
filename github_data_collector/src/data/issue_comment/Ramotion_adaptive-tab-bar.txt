Hi, I'm trying to install your beautiful component inside an existing framework, using cocoapods.
After `pod install` I've copied `AdaptiveController` into the project (drag&drop -> copy if necessary) and added `AdaptiveController` into Target Dependences in the Build Phase of my project.
In a framework, I can't add `AdaptiveController` into Target Dependences in the Build Phase, so I have this -obvious- compile error:

   Framework not found AdaptiveController

How can I fix this? 
These do not appear to work, nothing happens when I try the font face and size and the image doesn't scale up when only the image is showing
Carthage support to download with Carthage
The name of the project is **adaptive-tab-bar**, but the description says "**AdaptiveController** is a 'Progressive Reduction' Swift module for adding custom states to Native or Custom iOS UI elements"
