Dear all,

I am trying to extract the number of Google searches for a certain term in an interval of dates (usually on a monthly basis), only at a specific location (e.g. Italy). I used Google advanced search and it is possible to refine the search, but I have two issues:

- Google does not show the total number of searches anymore, when an interval of dates is selected;

- I need to automate this procedure, to construct a time series:

As a starting point, I tried to use the code you posted on GitHub, to obtain Google hits with XML and RCurl, but it does not work, not even the example ("Error in search.nodes[[1]] : subscript out of bounds").

Moreover: how can I adjust your code to use this URL, generated through advanced search?
