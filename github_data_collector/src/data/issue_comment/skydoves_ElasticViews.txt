## Guidelines
I changed the constructors and initialization of ElasticViews. Instead of writing multiple constructors, I use the @JvmOverloads annotation, default values and the init block to check what functions to call.

### Types of changes
What types of changes does your code introduce?

- [x ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
