I've followed the install/config instructions in the readme, and it happens without error.  Once I run the container, and connect to it, pinging 8.8.8.8 just hangs, and there's no name resolution.  My local openvpn client gives the following output:

Hello! im using this container to do somethig, but im not sure that im doing all ok.

I have a VPN server (vpn ip192.168.20.1 )on VPS with public ip, then i have 3 clients in diferents locations.
User_1_ with subnet 192.168.250.xxx -192.168.20.10 (vpn ip)
User_2 with subnet 192.168.250.xxx - 192.168.20.12 (vpn ip)
User_3  (192.168.20.13) need to conect to the user_1 subnet and other times conect to user 2 subnet, with this user We do a remote assistence.
In the future we can add more clients type user_1 and 2 and more clients type like user_3.

Now I can connect to user_1 with user_3 and all works good, but when user_2 conects to server I lost the routing and only can connect to user_2 in other words last user conected is conected to user_3 .

Now I can ping all users but I cant route to user_1 or user_2 subnets on demand only the last one connected.

Its possible to do it with your container??

Thanks!!!
I have generated two client configs with
```
docker run -v $OVPN_DATA:/etc/openvpn --log-driver=none --rm -it kylemanna/openvpn easyrsa build-client-full CLIENTNAME_1 nopass
docker run -v $OVPN_DATA:/etc/openvpn --log-driver=none --rm kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_getclient CLIENTNAME_1 > CLIENTNAME_1.ovpn
docker run -v $OVPN_DATA:/etc/openvpn --log-driver=none --rm -it kylemanna/openvpn easyrsa build-client-full CLIENTNAME_2 nopass
docker run -v $OVPN_DATA:/etc/openvpn --log-driver=none --rm kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_getclient CLIENTNAME_2 > CLIENTNAME_2.ovpn
```
And I can connect to the server, but both of them are getting the same IP. I have read that this may be caused by same CN in client certificates, but I haven't specified any CNs manually. I have also tried to setup permanent IP for each client by setting it with `ifconfig-push`  in /etc/openvpn/ccd/CLIENTNAME_1 but I still get the same IP regardless of this configs. Any ideas?
Hello!  I'm setting this up on our AWS infra with an attempt to make the following enhancements over the "stock" configuration:

things that are now working:
====
- split route traffic so only 10.100.X, 10.200.X goes over VPN, not full traffic
- ability to query AWS side DNS for internal resources like private DNS and internal load balancers only for specific domains
- OTP for users

things that still need to be done:
====
- change IP of clients to they're not in the 192.168 range (worried about conflicting with home networks)
- move key data out of the OVPN file into separate key/crt files for editing configs without spoiling keys


About the 192 address parts, on the current config there are 2 lines that mention 192:
````
route 192.168.254.0 255.255.255.0
server 192.168.255.0 255.255.255.0
````

Couple of quick questions - how do the 2 relate to eachother?  Since the 254 vs 255 thing, I don't know for sure if those are even related.  Any time I change either of them, I can get the clients to start having different IPs, but then the VPN breaks.  I assumed I could just change to something like:

````
route 172.21.254.0 255.255.255.0
server 172.21.255.0 255.255.255.0
````

and that would be it, but that doesn't work..  can anyone explain why or what needs to be done to get it working?

(also if anyone knows about the separate key file part, I haven't looked into that one yet)

Thanks!
This PR includes work from others that have been fixing the build. The build was failing for the following reasons:
- google-authenticator otp needs to be in non-interactive mode
- duplicate iptables rule in revocation test needs to be caught
- random file needs to be created for easyrsa rng

My client configuration like this:

There is no problem on windows, but there is a problem with my Mac os x , why? 
Running this container on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS on a 1GBit dedicated and i'm barely pushing 20mbit/s on my Windows client machine. Are there any solutions / ways to debug this? My CPU usage is also very low under load (< 10% when trying to speedtest) on the server.

Greetings!

So I have this [network architecture](https://i.imgur.com/opmT1TP.jpg) from a very basic `ovpn_genconfig` generated configs:

What I was expecting:
- with the VPN client connected be able to ping **at most** the VPN gateway 10.10.10.1
- need to add `push "route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0"` to allow the clients "see" 192.168.2.0/24 

What I get:
- I can ping VPN gateway and every host of VPN Host Subnets from 192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24

Why is this happening? I did not include the IPTable rules, which I did not change from the default ones generated from docker or this image itself but if you feel like you need it to debug too let me know.

Thank you.

Hi friend !

A Netflix proxy error appears and does not allow video playback. I have several docker OpenVPN in 4 different countries, especially in France, none works.

Is there a problem, can you help me?

Thank you
