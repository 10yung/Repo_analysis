Hi Folks,
It's possible to do date range in date-time picker as per the screenshot. Please help me

It would be very nice if there was an option to define disabled date intervals (like disabledTimeIntervals but for dates). This yould be really great!

Thank you.
I need to disable time only on a specific day. Is there a way to combine disabledHours and disabledDates? Or to say disable hours on day?

`      if(document.getElementById('Restaurant').value == "Frankfurt Kaiserstrasse") {
        $('#DatumZeit').data("DateTimePicker").disabledDates(['04.11.2019'])
        $('#DatumZeit').data("DateTimePicker").date(moment().add(2, 'hours'))() 
      }
      else {
      };

`
Alternatively, is there a way to use moments.js isBetween without using currenttime?

Hi. Last update of nuget package is 4.17.45 wich datetimepicke doesn't work properly with BS4. Can you pleas update nuget package to 4.17.47? This version works well with the latest BS4 releases. Thank you.
if you want to show "only date" the option is: format: 'L'
