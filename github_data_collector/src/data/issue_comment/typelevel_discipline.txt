While uTest is not so widely used it is very useful for scala.js projcets
Discipline is awesome. It's documentation is not.

Opening an issue which may or may not be started at hack the tower day to update the documentation so there's a quickstart for new users.

As a working example, discipline could provide an "AnyRefLaws" implementation that checks the behavior of the default `equals` and `hashCode` methods.

In particular, the implementation could work from:
- a `makeClone` method that creates a deep copy of an instance,
- two particular instances that are guaranteed to compare as `!=` with differing hashCode.

See for example: https://github.com/denisrosset/alasc/blob/master/scalacheck-binding/src/main/scala/net.alasc/laws/AnyRefLaws.scala

I'd gladly provide a PR if there is interest.
