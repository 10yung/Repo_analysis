Perhaps leading into/motivating a discussion of software engineering and devops?
e.g. what is dev ops...
I've added an optional industry post on what it means to be a Senior Data Scientist - full disclosure it's by myself :) 
Do you have references/examples of json format data? And perhaps best practice for working with these in R?
The "ethics" section does not include any work by ethicists, other humanities scholars, or any members of groups who are especially harmfully impacted by applied data science — such as residents of neighborhoods policed using predictive policing algorithms.  

O'Neil, Wallach, and Patil are all mathematicians/computer scientists.  Wheeler is an anthropologist.  I can't find a list of members of the ASA Committee; but [this press release](https://www.aaas.org/news/revisiting-american-statistical-associations-ethical-guidelines-statistical-practice) suggests that committee members are selected from the ASA membership, i.e., statisticians.  

Last fall, O'Neil wrote an opinion piece that was published in the *New York Times*.  The piece was sharply criticized by [STS scholars and ethicists](https://medium.com/@sts_news/you-have-been-waiting-your-whole-life-for-me-cathy-oneil-misrepresents-reality-706d5b0b3fbb) for ignoring the existence of longstanding fields of study devoted to exactly the topics that O'Neil claimed academia was neglecting.  

In addition, all of these authors speak as data science *agents* — people who develop and use data science systems and models — rather than data science *subjects* — people whose lives are governed by data science systems and models.  Compared to data science agents, data science subjects are much more likely to be poor, disabled, queer, and people of color.  In the context of a small class taught in the statistics department at an elite university, the overall effect is that data science subjects are effectively excluded from the conversation.  This reproduces the systemic, intersectional problems that data ethics is supposed to criticize.
