Getting an error when running the renaming script (using separate administrator account).

- Popup stating "Terminal" requesting permission to access computer.
- Click "OK" to allow.
- Script runs but confuses the users details.

- Example: When trying to rename Josh to JAF, it attempts to rename the user folder to /Users/Josh/Jaf (see attached images).

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

./RADIUS_IP_Update.sh: 73: ./RADIUS_IP_Update.sh: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "fi")

"Update-JCUsersFromCSV" will not work when certain fields are in the csv file and the command doesn't throw an error so I didn't notice that it didn't actually update.  Anyways the following (and possibly other) fields, when set in the csv file, will cause that command to silently fail.  I say possibly others because I haven't tried them all.  

- account_locked
- enable_managed_uid
- enable_user_portal_multifactor
- ldap_binding_user
- password_never_expires
- passwordless_sudo
- sudo

 Those are fields that I would legitimately like to update.  
Suggest to actually eval the user home path instead of assuming that it is always in /Users. This will almost always be true (that homes are in /Users), but there might be cases where an admin has decided to create a hidden admin home in /var as suggested in Apple Support Article https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203998
Whilst running the script, I get the following warning on several machines (mostly Win Home):
```

Hi everyone,

Today I was trying to create a command that will allows me to send a notification to my endpoints using a Balloon Tip Notification (System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon). 

After a few hours of research and try I realized that it will be a little difficult to me to achieve that since I don't completely understand the way the jumpcloud commands are set it up to run in the endpoints.

So I decided to make a request instead. I see that you guys have a command that already sends a notification but it uses a message box. How difficult will be to you guys to implement this command?

Can you package the below up as a Chocolatey package and publish it? Would make deploying it super easy, just `choco install jumpcloudagent -y`

Fix apiClientV2.SystemGroupsApi.GroupsSystemGet().
map[string]interface{} was missing in the function call.
Hi,

I've updated a few macOS shell scripts which I use quite a lot in order to comply with `shellcheck`. Some scripts also have an update to their formatting for better readability and some scripts were made executable.
