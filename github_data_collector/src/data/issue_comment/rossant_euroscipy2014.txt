Hi,

I'm trying to port those very helpful notebooks to run under latest version of the jupyter-notebook. I was able to successfully convert the `[01_interact , 02_gui , 04_dataviz]` notebooks, but I'm having some difficulties with the `03_custom` notebook.
The changes I made are available as [gist](https://gist.github.com/epifanio/f3365b0b10aae2d78902).

The problem I'm having with `03_custom` notebook.

Reading from [version3_widget_migration](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/whatsnew/version3_widget_migration.html) I changed the js code from:

```
%%javascript
// We import the WidgetManager.
require(["widgets/js/widget"], function(WidgetManager){ 

    // We define the NumberSelector view here.
    var NumberSelector = widget.DOMWidgetView.extend({

        // Function for rendering the view.
        render: function(){
```

to:

```
%%javascript
// We import the WidgetManager.
require(["widget"], function(WidgetManager){ 

    // We define the NumberSelector view here.
    var NumberSelector = widget.DOMWidgetView.extend({

        // Function for rendering the view.
        render: function(){
```

using `require(["widget”] …` instead of `require(["widgets/js/widget …` and `widget.DOMWidgetView.extend` instead of `IPython.DOMWidgetView.extend`
but when testing the widget at the `code cell 4` i have (log from the js console):

```
Couldn't create a view for model id '8727d6f51f804c7aa582b3d95b3c630d'  --  Error: Class NumberSelector not found in registry (…)
```

I guess the last line in the js code:

```
WidgetManager.register_widget_view('NumberSelector', NumberSelector);
```

didn’t worked.

Have you any idea on how to fix this? thanks!

Hi Rossant, 

Great job with the @interact tag that helps generate easy interactive functions. The issue I am having is with pandas as I am writing a tool that looks up textfiles and returns a table of values. Returning the variable with the interact function doesn't work but print displays the data but without the tables. Any ideas if there is a work around this?
