I setup your plugin, but when executing the the ` ./gradlew -Pandroid.enableJetifier=false canIDropJetifier` command, I get 

```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring project ':aggregation'.
> No such property: testOptions for class: java.lang.String
```

Gradle version is 5.6.2
We were using some dependency substitution on the support libraries in our app causing the plugin to tell us that we were fine dropping jetifier, even though we weren't. Removing the now unnecessary dependency substitution produced the expected results. 
Wanted to post this here as others may run into the issue too.

Example for dependency substitution:
```Groovy
    project.configurations.all {
        resolutionStrategy.eachDependency { details ->
            if (details.requested.group == 'com.android.support') {
                details.useVersion someVersion
            }
        }
    }
```
com.instabug.library:instabug
com.facebook.android:facebook-android-sdk
Hi @plnice , we have an app with 500+ libraries, 80 modules, and the plugin is too slow for us. After 30 minutes, it didn't complete.

It might be that you resolve configurations, I am not sure. 

A workaround for us is: 
```bash
./gradlew -Pandroid.enableJetifier=false :<app module>:dependencies --configuration <flavor><buildType>RuntimeClasspath | grep com.android.support
```
This command takes around 15 seconds to execute.

If you are interested, in one of our repo we use a very fast way to check dependencies:
https://github.com/f2prateek/dart/blob/1c8d5e8863eb7b0b4595d6a6e8a8de150e0300f8/henson-plugin/src/main/java/dart/henson/plugin/internal/GenerateHensonNavigatorTask.java#L63

Maybe this would be the way for you to go as well. I am not sure. We would be happy to use the plugin if it could be run in 1-2 minutes on our nightly build.
