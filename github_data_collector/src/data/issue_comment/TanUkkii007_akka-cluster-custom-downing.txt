I've upgraded Akka dependencies to version 2.6.1, and fixed the only test file that didn't compile right away.
Hi !

I was experimenting with OldestAutoDowning strategy and stumbled upon a behavior when multiple nodes get into unreachable state at the "same" time - or within a "stable-after" window.

In that case OldestAutoDowning will down one node only, the events for other nodes will not get processed and things are stuck in "Leader can currently not perform its duties" state forever.

```
2018-04-11 15:23:04 [INFO ] [a.c.Cluster(akka://somecluster)]  - Cluster Node [akka.tcp://somecluster@127.0.0.1:2552] - Leader can currently not perform its duties,
 reachability status: [
  akka.tcp://somecluster@127.0.0.1:2552 -> akka.tcp://somecluster@127.0.0.1:60202: Unreachable [Unreachable] (9),
  akka.tcp://somecluster@127.0.0.1:2552 -> akka.tcp://somecluster@127.0.0.1:60265: Unreachable [Unreachable] (8)
  ], member status: [
    akka.tcp://somecluster@127.0.0.1:2552 Up seen=true,
    akka.tcp://somecluster@127.0.0.1:60202 Up seen=false,
    akka.tcp://somecluster@127.0.0.1:60265 Up seen=false
    ]
```

These are the settings:

```
akka.cluster.downing-provider-class = "tanukki.akka.cluster.autodown.OldestAutoDowning"

custom-downing {
  stable-after = 20s

  oldest-auto-downing {
    oldest-member-role = "master"
    down-if-alone = false
  }
}
```

Seems to me in this case 
CustomAutoDownBase#downPendingUnreachableMembers will never get called in that case as its called from OldestAutoDownBase#onMemberRemoved only and somehow that will not happen.

How to reproduce:
- start node with "master" role
- start two other nodes not having "master" role
- kill the two nodes
- => one gets downed, the other one not, "Leader can currently not perform its duties" state forever


Is this a bug or a feature ?

Thx !
Trying to use OldestAutoDown strategy and when self shutdown takes more than 10 seconds, cluster member doesn't terminate. Wish I could configure that parameter some way.
Ideally the akka dependency should be optional so that whoever uses the library doesn't have to use the same akka version as the one declared in this project
