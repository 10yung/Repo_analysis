Upstream issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68264

Workaround: https://github.com/agersant/polaris/pull/56/commits/ee71df9d0b3d5e24232eabf69e2f65e8ba6707e4


This should:
- Clear the `username` and `admin` cookies client-side
- Re-route to /auth
- Delete the session on the server
I tried to do a system-wide install on Linux and it's a bit of a mess. I ended up with this:

```
/var/lib/polaris
/var/lib/polaris/.local
/var/lib/polaris/.local/share
/var/lib/polaris/.local/share/polaris
/var/lib/polaris/.local/share/polaris/polaris.log
/var/lib/polaris/.local/share/polaris/polaris.pid
/var/lib/polaris/.local/share/polaris/thumbnails
/var/lib/polaris/.local/share/polaris/thumbnails/12698004523255186174.jpg
/var/lib/polaris/.local/share/polaris/thumbnails/11339598049783905663.jpg
/var/lib/polaris/.local/share/polaris/thumbnails/17518483773397318633.jpg
/var/lib/polaris/.local/share/polaris/db.sqlite
```

The `.local/share` part shouldn't be there, the log file should be under `/var/log`, and the PID file should be under `/var/run`.

This one isn't great, but it would be nice to include a `systemd` unit in the package. This can be used as a starting point.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Polaris
After=network.target

[Service]
User=polaris
ExecStart=/usr/bin/polaris -f -w /usr/share/polaris/web -s /usr/share/polaris/swagger
WorkingDirectory=/var/lib/polaris

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```
What the title says. I'd like to test Polaris, but it's a bit slow at scanning my media library. Being able to share the library with `mpd` would be really nice.
Most music formats can have album art embedded in the music file themselves. It would be great if it was supported as it's used a lot these days.
Pending a more stable/bug-free version of https://github.com/passcod/notify or equivalent.
