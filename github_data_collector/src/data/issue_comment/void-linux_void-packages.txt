Heya! I haven't been using Void Linux over the past two or so years, and as such haven't been updating nor keeping track of the following packages. I'm not quite sure what the process is to "officially orphan" them are, however I do know outside of community updates, these haven't been touched.

Since the upgrade kernel version from 5.3 to 5.4, my intel wifi card is out !
Please, can you patch the linux kernel 5.4 like [archlinux](https://git.archlinux.org/linux.git/commit/?h=v5.4.10-arch1&id=78fe4d666ff244609c7d02bea07a22ce87e56326) did in the kernel version 5.4.10 ? I am on the last update kernel version 5.4.13 and this problem is not solved !
And update the linux-firmware package, it is not in list of packages to update !
Off course, i can boot on the 5.3 kernel version on boot, but it will be more comfortable to patch and update this packages !
