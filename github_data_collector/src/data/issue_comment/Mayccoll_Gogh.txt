I downloaded all profiles but I'm unsure how to select them now they are downloaded (or where they download too)...

Although i am running this on one of the supported terminals (gnome-terminal), i am getting this error:  
`Unsupported terminal!

Supported terminals:
   mintty and deriviates
   guake
   iTerm2
   elementary terminal (pantheon/elementary)
   mate-terminal
   gnome-terminal
   tilix
   xfce4-terminal

If you believe you have recieved this message in error,
try manually setting `TERMINAL', hint: ps -h -o comm -p $PPID
`
how do i do this? i am just running the script via the instructions on the readme. which is:
`sudo bash -c  "$(wget -qO- https://git.io/vQgMr)"`

how would i manually set the terminal, or fix this?
I had a lot of trouble using Gogh for Mac OS using iterm2. I kept getting the error message below. I think it should be more descriptive to help people use Gogh properly.

```
Unsupported terminal!

   mintty and deriviates
   guake
   iTerm2
   elementary terminal (pantheon/elementary)

I tried setting the TERMINAL env value to *iTerm2* and other variants and it still would show that message each time I tried rerunning the script.

Similarly I tried running `ps -h -o comm -p $PPID` and kept getting the output `COMM\nlogin` which was related at all to the terminal type.

I eventually had to go trough through the script and see that the the `$TERM_PROGRAM` env is used to set the tone $TERMINAL. The value of this on my machine was *'iTerm.app'* and when I set the `TERMINAL` env to that value it finally worked.

The error message should list add `iTerm.app` as a supported terminal option instead of the `iTerm2` and it should also tell people to trying check the value of `$TERM_PROGRAM`.

Even better the `gogh.sh` should be able to detect the terminal type with my machine and setup.

When I run `bash -c  "$(wget -qO- https://git.io/vQgMr)"` it lists all the themes, but when I try installing one (e.g., 40), it gives me the following output:

I've used Gogh in the past without issues, but I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 19.10, which is based on gnome 3.34.1

Every time that I search for a theme, I need to find it by name on terminal. If the themes page have the number too, would be faster to choose on terminal the themes I want.
Hey
As per the docs, I simply did this `bash -c  "$(wget -qO- https://git.io/vQgMr)"`, which showed a beautiful list of color options but when I entered a option number it said unsupported terminal.

```bash
Usage : Enter Desired Themes Numbers (OPTIONS) Separated By A Blank Space
        Press ENTER without options to Exit

Enter OPTION(S) : 164

Theme: Twilight
