I would like to suggest if you can add a map marker removal feature, so that a marker can be removed from the map. Doing it using mapbox functions causes the map not to work anymore.
Hi, 

Just cloned the project and tried to go through bower etc, and I get this big warning that bower is about to stop working any minute now. Is this some red herring or does the code really need a rescue?
Thanks!

I made a few changes to the `eon.js` file and the `v/0.0.10/eon.js` files that allow me to use the gh-pages branch as a cdn for examples on JSfiddle.

At [example here](https://jsfiddle.net/Lbdoxoeb/):

If I use `https://pubnub.github.io/eon/lib/eon.js` instead of `https://kirkins.github.io/eon/lib/eon.js`

It doesn't work because the default version always tries to use http. 
Hi there,

Any plans to move Project EON to use Any plans to move to Mapbox GL JS?

Thanks,
Michael
