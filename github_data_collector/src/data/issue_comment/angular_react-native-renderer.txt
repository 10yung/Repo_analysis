as the title stating , is this project no longer being maintained , because I like to work with Angular more than React and I'm sure that there is lots of developers who share the same interest , so before putting efforts and time trying to make this renderer work with the latest React Native , does it still maintained by Angular ?
reflect-metadata shim is required when using class decorators
Where for example is the "hello-app" selector. From: selector: 'hello-app',
I was wondering how I can get the app running in production mode. I am getting 'Cannot enable prod mode after platform setup' when I reopen the app again. 

Thank you

Http.post initiated but no response, not sure what is happening. but it works fine with fetch command.

It should cover the command log usage and the NativeElement class

Used in applications (elementRef.nativeElement) and in tests (fixture.elementRef.nativeElement)

Currently, after each turn of zone.js, the instructions to be sent from JS to native are batched based on the APIs which are available in UIManager.
With different APIs, it could be possible to improve performances. To be evaluated.

React Native provides a subset of the features and components that exist in the Native world. It can be extended and there is already an active community publishing packages. This has to be made available in the Angular 2 context as well.

Challenges:
- How to use existing extensions? Is there a generic way? Is Angular 2 specific component needed?
- How to create new extensions?

To be defined when it is available in React Native
