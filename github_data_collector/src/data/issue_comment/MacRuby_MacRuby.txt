Add https://gist.github.com/Watson1978/1927952#file-macruby_uninstall as a script to uninstall as per #190.

This PR should fix MacRuby/MacRuby#120

There is no tests attached. :cry: I would appreciate if somebody suggest how to write tests.

Hi,

in ruby_deploy the mtime comparison always fails since Xcode copies the file to the build dir without preserving mtime.

I've written a per-default disabled --cache command line switch that caches the compiled .rbo files (+ SHA1 of the source file) in .rbo-cache, which speeds up ruby_deploy by a huge amount for big projects

If run with --cache ruby_deploy will mirror the directory structure of Contents/Resources in .rbo-cache and save the compiled rbos and the SHA1 of the source files there on a per ARCH basis. The next time ruby_deploy --cache gets invoked it checks to see which rbos it can just copy and which have to be compiled (and then cached)
The mtime checking is kept too.

Currently there's no cache pruning, you just have to remove .rbo-cache from time to time if you add/delete many files, but that can be added.
