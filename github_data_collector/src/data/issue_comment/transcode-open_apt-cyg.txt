Very unclear as to how to install this
Attempting to run `apt-cyg update` results in the following error:

bunzip2: Compressed file ends unexpectedly;
        perhaps it is corrupted?  *Possible* reason follows.
bunzip2: No such file or directory
        Input file = setup.bz2, output file = setup

It is possible that the compressed file(s) have become corrupted.
You can use the -tvv option to test integrity of such files.

You can use the `bzip2recover' program to attempt to recover
data from undamaged sections of corrupted files.

bunzip2: Deleting output file setup, if it exists.
mv: cannot stat 'setup': No such file or directory
Updated setup.ini
Current quickstart says 
```
lynx -source rawgit.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg > apt-cyg
install apt-cyg /bin
```
RawGit.com is shutting down and there is also no need to use lynx, which is a full-blown web browser.
I suggest the following:

1. Install wget through setup-x86_64.exe 
2. Run in Cygwin: 
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg
install apt-cyg /bin
```
Since this repo is abandoned, I'm going to request Github support to move the root project marker to https://github.com/kou1okada/apt-cyg

According to http://forked.yannick.io/transcode-open/apt-cyg , it's the only fork with any kind of active maintaining going on. Yes, it deviates from the original and has a lot of potentially redundant features. But regardless of your stance on that, there are no other forks that can compare: others do not even fix the reported critical issues, so they are unusable.

The only other fork which seems has meaningful changes is https://github.com/ilatypov/apt-cyg . It attempts to make a bootstrapping mechanism, but the feature seems incomplete (if it was complete, bootstrapping operations wouldn't be reported as user commands but rather invoked automagically when any of the packages `apt-cyg` relies upon need to be updated).

@ilatypov , as the only potential rival, do you have any reservations about this action? Is your fork usable and/or maintained? Since your repo doesn't even accept bug reports, it doesn't seem like you're willing to pick up the torch.

Hello,
I run sudo apt-cyg install git, but it doesn't work.

Unable to start 'apt-cyg': There is no application associated with the given file name extension.

How do I run apt-cyg with root priv.

Pat
When I install dos2unix, it hang after xz OK and it does not response.

```
$ apt-cyg install dos2unix
Installing dos2unix
dos2unix-7.4.0-1.tar.xz: OK
```
wget is more likely present in cygwin than lynx
The only thing that worked for me was the workaround mentioned in issue #117
I try to run apt-cyg on debian from gitlab docker. I use gitlab continious integration.
