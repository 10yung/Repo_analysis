Hello!

I would like to run the librespot on a free account? Where do I need to edit the code? Is changing "accountReq": "PREMIUM" to "accountReq": "FREE" in src/discovery.rs enough?
Hello there,

I'm trying to evaluate this library for use in a personal project. Without diving to deep I was curious if I could get a general overview of architecture. I see you are calling ALSA and PULSEAUDIO but not exactly sure how are you gathering the audio stream from Spotify. 
I have spent several hours to make it working, so maybe it have a place in the documentation ?

Working example
mkdir -p /opt/music/
mkfifo /opt/music/spotify
chown raspotify /opt/music/spotify

#launching librespot
/usr/bin/librespot --name raspotify --backend pipe --device /opt/music/spotify --bitrate 160 --disable-audio-cache --enable-volume-normalisation --linear-volume --initial-volume=100

#reading file and sending it to aplay
sox -t raw -c 2 -r 44k  -e signed-integer -L -b 16  /opt/music/spotify -t .wav - | aplay

#same but sending it to several devices
sox -t raw -c 2 -r 44k  -e signed-integer -L -b 16  /opt/music/spotify -t .wav - | tee >(delay 300 | aplay) |   aplay  -D bluealsa:HCI=hci0,DEV=00:02:3C:41:45:08,PROFILE=a2dp
Good day everyone,

following issue: Immediatly when the Aerial (Apple TV) Screensaver starts, the Librespot connection disapear (in Spotify on my Android Phone) and no music is playing. I disabled the Audio option in the Screensaver menu, but still the same issue. No issue with the other screensavers (e.g. Dim or Black).
Did anybody else facing this issue and give me a solution. THX

System: Raspberry Pi 3
Krypton 17.3 / LibreELEC 8.2.5
Audio via HDMI
Librespot Version 8.2.111
I don't know if it's helpful or not:

If you provide me clues what I can do to improve the backtrace, then I'll update. I'm using raspotify 0.10.6~librespot.20180311T111418Z.9d9c311 - if there are better alternatives, I'm open.

**Thanks for great project!**
After installing out-of-the-box LibreSpot 8.2.108 (from the standard repo) on out-of-the-box LibreElec 8.2.3 (Kodi Krypton 17.8), everything worked fine. After a reboot the device is not discoverable. By using the Kodi GUI My Addons -> Services -> LibreSpot en selecting "update", the service seems to be started again (even though I 'updated' to the same version). I have to repeat this every (re)boot (which I find quite tedious). 
Updated the note in the readme to point to the librespot-org repo
The folks at [librespot-org](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) have what looks to be a very active and maintained fork.

Perhaps you should link to it in the README?  This is still the first search result that comes up when searching for opensource spotify libs.
Is there a solution to control music Volumen by command line ?
