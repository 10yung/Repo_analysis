If you want me to put an App that can be 'Hide/Unhide/Uninstall' using my script please do the following

Give me the result of the following in powershell
```
$pkgname='NAME OF APP HERE'
(Get-AppxPackage "*$pkgname*").Name
```

and the name of what the app is called.


Example:
```
$pkgname='Netflix'
(Get-AppxPackage "*$pkgname*").Name
```

will return `4DF9E0F8.Netflix`

so for the above example you reply with
4DF9E0F8.Netflix
Netflix

Please ONLY put apps that are installed on new install/computers and are NOT OEM apps (like dell, hp, etc)
