### 📒 Description
Current in-app notifications UI can be used to show the users that they need to update their app. This can act as a "soft teapot" so that the users aren't forced to update. The button click should immediately restart&update the app. Currently, button clicks open the link in the web browser, so we should find a way to make it restart the app.

- Make sure the functionality of Idle notification window still works as expected without changes.

To see the idle notification window: set 1 min in Preferences->Idle detection, start time entry and wait >1min.

Note: Showing project information requires changes in the library, as does formatting the time passed, so they are moved to separate tickets: #3736, #3733. These changes are not directly related to the Windows design update and are relevant for other platforms as well.
### 💻 Environment
Platform: macOS/Windows/Linux


### 📒 Description
Show project information (project name, project color, task name, client name) in the idle notification window in addition to time entry description.

- [ ] Windows
- [ ] Mac
- [ ] Linux

### 💻 Environment

Platform: Windows
OS Version: Windows 10
Toggl Version: 7.4.1112 (64-bit)


### 🐞 Actual behavior
After resetting my API token I was logged out and couldn't log back into the app. After clicking to log in the UI would show for a second and the same page would load again. It was also telling me that I lost access to my latest WS and that I should create a new one which is misleading. 

### 💯 Expected behavior
I should be able to simply log back in after using the correct credentials 

### 🔨 Steps to reproduce

1. Reset token on the Profile Settings page
2. Start the desktop app
3. Try logging in


### 📦 Additional info

After removing the app along with clearing it's local data I was able to log in. 
### 💻 Environment
Platform: macOS

### 🐞 Actual behavior
Idle popup showed away time only in minutes ` (333 minutes)`

### 💯 Expected behavior
Idle popup should format the time to more suitable format `hh:mm`

### 🔨 Steps to reproduce
Have a very long idle time or set the duration in `gui.cc` -> `GUI::DisplayIdleNotification` method to something big.
