This project is awesome and it would be sad to see it slowly fade away.

Perhaps there is someone qualified that could take over? (would love to but I don't have bandwidth right now)

You could always do a short trial-period: ask them to answer 10 issues and 10 pull requests, and see if they seem qualified.
I need to get data from the point of the graph on click on it, then make an action with it. Please, help to find the right way to do it. Is it possible in MetricsGraphics.js?

Thanks.

Hi there! Wonderful library - digging into it now and liking what I see so far.

I see that there's a way to do multiple lines/areas by way of multiple series in the passed data object. I also see that one can do "chart_type: 'histogram'" to get time series data in histogram format.

Is it possible to do a line _together with a histogram_, in one plot? The use case would be plotting cumulative counts of certain groupings of data with area, and then having a day-binned histogram overlaid on top.

Thanks so much!

Cheers,
Rico

Is it possible to create a stacked multi-line graphic? So the lines are stacked on top of each other to get a combined total value?
Currently `MG.convert.number` blindly converts anything into a Number, including null. This stops nulls from being converted into zeros

A relatively small maintenance release adjusting dependencies.

##### Features

-   Lodash is removed in favor of lighter dependencies specifically for the features used. `intelli-espower-loader` was also removed, as it's no longer compatible with the full suite of Node.js releases tested.
