In old versions of iOS EPSignature is working properly but in iOS 13.2 the view controller appears like a popup and you can't draw anything because the finger movement closes the view.
 I integrated EPSignature into Xcode project using Carthage and I received an error below.

Skipped building EPSignature due to the error:
Dependency "EPSignature" has no shared framework schemes for any of the platforms: iOS
signature can be exported as svg format
- Update project to adopt the recommended build settings in Xcode 10.3
- Update Travis configuration to use Xcode 10.3
- Update project to support Swift 5.0
Unable to view signature in Xcode 11  and ios 13 or above.

Please upgrade to frame work to swift 5 compatible. 
I want to show my custom images in the place of delete & done buttons in **navigationItem**.
How can I achieve this?
Newest version do not compile with swift 4.2 and Xcode 10, after couple of renames works fine
Added EPSignature_Tests to the EPSignature scheme test action to fix the Travis failure.
Credit to Victor for the issue fix.
