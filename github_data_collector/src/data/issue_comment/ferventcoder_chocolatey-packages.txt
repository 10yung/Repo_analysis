Google no longer supports the Drive desktop app.
Replaced by [google-backup-and-sync](https://chocolatey.org/packages/google-backup-and-sync) and [google-drive-file-stream](https://chocolatey.org/packages/google-drive-file-stream).
I installed `mysql` first, then found out the tool I was using can not connect to MySQL 8. Then I uninstalled it, and installed MySQL 5.7.18 (explicitly). It worked, but now I can't seem to connect to the server and I am not sure if it is actually running or not.
For info - getting the following message when installing webpicmd:

Write-ChocolateySuccess is deprecated and will be removed in v2. If you are the maintainer, please remove it from your package file.
What is the purpose of this choco package repository?

For example I might be interested in maintaining a package or two. It would be better if I joined a community of people doing that instead starting my own repository/feed/whatever. I'm aware of https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-package-requests, but that's just a switchboard to coordinate maintainers. I haven't been able to locate a hub where maintainers congregate and actually do and share work. This repo looks like it could be that place. Is it okay to create a pull request for package X here? If not, where else? Thanks.
This is now installed along with the python application, and isn't required as a stand alone package.
there are incorrect download links for mysql versions 5.6 there is a commit here that fixes it:
https://github.com/ferventcoder/chocolatey-packages/commit/2fcf6baf7bfcedfcdcc8a80b89b33b24156e524c
can it be merged?
I'm not sure what the reasoning is behind using the Cream distribution for Vim, rather than the official distribution. I thought maybe the official Vim installer was using some wacko installer method, but I checked and they are both using NSIS. While I do understand the "if it aint broke dont fix it" mindset, however, this is broke:

The Cream distribution includes the windows right click context menu item for "Edit with Vim", however on `choco uninstall vim`, it doesn't remove that context item.

Further, the official Vim windows installer either from the Vim FTP or from the [Vim Github release](https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases), includes an additional context menu for "Edit with existing Vim", which is useful if you already have Vim running. The Cream installation lacks this. Plus, its 'official', so why not use it?
Would allow user to override default installation directory.
So ideally, the idea behind chocolatey is that you can install and uninstall packages cleanly.  However, the vim package is highly broken on uninstall.  First, running choco uninstall vim actually fails to uninstall anything at all, which means you have to uninstall via the uninstaller in add/remove programs.

However, even running that uninstaller fails to remove the shell extension, which has to be removed manually in the registry, so the uninstall process is extremely dirty.  

Suggestions:
1.) Add an option to install without the shell extension (by manually removing the relevant registry entries).

2.) Fix the uninstall process generally, by running the uninstaller properly in silent mode, and manually removing those registry entries for the shell extension.
