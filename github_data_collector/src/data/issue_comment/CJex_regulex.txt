Miss types in TypeScript project, hope to add.
regexp: `/[ -~]/` is a set what is from space key to wave key, but visual result is  wave key and split key set wrongly.
Thank you very much for this excellent tool!
I love using it, it really helps

I saw I can't use the negative look behind syntax ?<!
Can you please add support for that?

Example - 
find all strings 'py' that are not prefixed by 'co'
/(?<!co)py/

Thanks
amd-define must be removed from the lib

Regulex works perfect for Regex not long enough, you can easily visualize the generated .svg against the expression. However, when it comes to fairly LARGE REGEXes, it becomes really hard to drag/scroll the webpage. Is there any way to integrate a collapsible option to collapse the regions of the AST if possible? 

[XRegExp](https://git.io/xregexp) augments JavaScript regex syntax with additional features like named capture, the `x` flag for free spacing and line comments, and `\p{..}` for Unicode properties. It would be awesome if Regulex supported these features as well. Apart from XRegExp, they're supported in a variety other modern regex implementations (Java, Perl, PCRE, .NET, etc.).

excellent tool btw - 

it would be nice to have it on par with something like rubular.com for matching multiple patterns

Support `/\u{12345}/u` .

Regulex only conforms with ECMAScript's regex syntax.
