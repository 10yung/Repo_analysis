updating the aliases to work with the testnet
The following command (chapter 6_1_Sending_a_Transaction_to_a_Multisig) can not be executed because env variable $address1 is an address and not a pub key: 
```
machine1$ bitcoin-cli -named createmultisig nrequired=2 keys='''["'$address1'","0367c4f666f18279009c941e57fab3e42653c6553e5ca092c104d1db279e328a28"]'''
```

Therefore $address1 should be changed to the pubkey of address1 (same as with address2).


The old command for getting the public key of an address is described in Chapter 06_01:
```machine2$ bitcoin-cli -named validateaddress address=$address2```

The new command since 0.17.0 would be:
```machine2$ bitcoin-cli -named getaddressinfo address=$address2```
Hi, I am offering to contribute a Chinese translation. Anyway to get started? 
Hi,
I read this [https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/08_4_Scripting_a_Multisig.md](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/08_4_Scripting_a_Multisig.md ).It is good.
I am working on creating simple p2sh script. But first round of validation can be done easily. Can you please tell about how to do the second round of validation that is deserializing the redeemscript and combine with the operands and do the operation?
Because when we give a scriptsig for a locking script, some of the values will be  pushed on to stack initially follwed by whole redeemscript pushed as element into the stack. In that case, how will you deserialize and verify the internal script? 
`validateaddress` doesn't return a `pubkey` field anymore ([stackexchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/80754/85335)).

You should probably use `getaddressinfo` for [this step](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/06_1_Sending_a_Transaction_to_a_Multisig.md#collect-remote-public-keys) instead

In the chapter:

4.5: Sending Coins with Automated Raw Transactions

$ unfinishedtx=$(bitcoin-cli -named createrawtransaction inputs='''[]''' outputs='''{ "'$recipient'": 1.0 }''')


What's the meaning of triple single quotes like '''[]''' ?


Inspired by [something this repository does](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/master/README.md#contributing) I want to propose adding emoji to the various blockquotes in order to make them stand out more (... than just the **bold** signal word). Another example of where this can be really beneficial is e.g. [Chapter 6 section 4 Write our Transaction](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/06_4_Sending_a_Transaction_with_a_Locktime.md) where at the end two consecutive blockquotes appear. Without the emoji this may appear as a single thing, and the emoji can help readers more easily distinguish between the two.

In the table below I present a preview of what I mean, compared to the current situation, with examples from various chapters. Of course, the emojis I picked are also up for debate.

I'm curious to hear what peoples opinions are about adding this  to this project.

As for the _Sequence note_ (e.g. in [Chapter 4 section 2 Verify Your Raw Transaction](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/04_2_Creating_a_Raw_Transaction.md)) I'm really lost on what emoji should be used (and related to the last part of this issue, if it should even be a blockquote).

* * *

Related to this, I feel like [the "M-OF-N VS N-OF-N" blockqoute in (e.g.*) chapter 6 section 1 Create the Addres](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/06_1_Sending_a_Transaction_to_a_Multisig.md#create-the-address) is inconsistent with other usages of block quotes. But that might just be me :smile: 

<sup><i>* there is a similar one in [Chapter 6 section 2](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/06_2_Spending_a_Transaction_to_a_Multisig.md)</i></sup>
