ResponseEmitter's function `emit` performs check against `isResponseEmpty` and in such case removes headers `Content-Type` and `Content-Length`. This however has effect of removing these headers when `HEAD` request is sent (as the body in such case won't be set, it will be always empty). RFC2616 specifies:

> The Content-Type entity-header field indicates the media type of the
   entity-body sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method,
   the media type that would have been sent had the request been a GET.

> The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of the
   entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or,
   in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that
   would have been sent had the request been a GET.

Additionally, some web servers might get wrong idea and try to insert `Content-Type` as detected, resulting in no `Content-Length` header and `Content-Type` being set as whatever web server defaults to (for nginx this would be `text/html` on default configuration)
I prepare PR https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/2922 with implementation
In begin you can use GA and Travis Ci for comparing
- Add ci.yml for supporting GIthub Actions
Hello,

I think it would be nice to create a new Slim component - **CLI Console** (like [Symfony Console](https://github.com/symfony/console)), to start the PHP Dev server, Debug router and Container, Generating Routes and Actions etc.

If you agree with me, I can immediately start working on it.
**Slim 4 Release**
See the full [release notes](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/2769).

**Before doing anything read the docs**
I just finished the first draft of the docs for Slim 4 which are available here. I need feedback please:
https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v4

**Download the 4.0.0 release**
`composer require slim/slim:^4.0`

**Install a PSR-7 Implementation**
You will also need to install a PSR-7 implementation and ServerRequestCreator combo. You can use Slim's PSR-7 Implementation or choose one of the ones described on the `4.x` branch README: https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/blob/4.x/README.md
`composer require slim/psr7`

**You can also use the Slim 4 DDD API Skeleton to create a new project**
`composer create-project slim/slim-skeleton [my-app-name]`

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ping me on Slack or ask questions in this thread directly, I'm available to help!
