**Expected Behaviour**

The `SVProgressHUD` Pod allows us to use a smooth and fine HUD, which I think looks and feels much better.

**Actual Behaviour**
Currently, the application UI related to the signUp screen has already implemented without the signUp functionality such as allowing new users to create an account by entering their details (first name, last name, password).

<!--Please state here what is currently happening.-->

**Expected Behaviour**
In the app signUp screen, a new user should be able to create an account with his basic details and after creating the user account user (h/s) should be able to login to the application and use the app features.

**Actual Behaviour**
Currently, the application UI related to the login screen has already implemented without the login functionality such as validating login credentials with the backend.

<!--Please state here what is currently happening.-->

**Expected Behaviour**
In the app login screen, once a particular user(already registered) entered the login credentials, that user should be able to visit the application dashboard page.

**Actual Behaviour**
Currently, the application starts with the login screen and we have given an option to the user to SignUp if s/he hasn't registered on the platform. Also, once we move to SignUp screen there's an option (button) to move to the login screen if the user has already registered on the platform.

### 

<!--Please state here what is currently happening.-->

**Expected Behaviour**

<!--State here what the feature should enable the user to do.-->

Since the app is supposed to follow the same functionality and UI/UX of the android application, we need to implement a new screen (welcome screen/getting started screen) before the login or the SignUp screen. So that screen will do the validation using the email and will redirect the user to the relevant page.
