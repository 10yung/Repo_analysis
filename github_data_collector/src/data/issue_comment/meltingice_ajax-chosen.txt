update for chosen v1.6.2
for chosen 1.6.2


I have modified the code so that it supports newer versions of Chosen.
The changes I found were:
- update chzn to chosen as this is the new namespace for chosen classes
- css fix is no longer required is it's already fixed.

With jQuery 1.7.1 even though it is so old :) 
An ajaxStop event is called so i copy the current field value to data attribute then when the ajaxStop event finishes copy the data back from the data to the value.

update css class names to latest chosen version

There was a problem when " append options " to target select,

Especially when use class name to run script. e.g :
$(".chzn-select").ajaxChosen();

i've changed " select " with  " $this " to make it run correctly .. 

and changed : 
.trigger("liszt:updated"); 

To latest update of chosen ..

.trigger("chosen:updated");

the Chosen selectors have changed to '.chosen-container' , also the refresh now is done by triggering "chosen:updated"

Hi good day, I want contribute with this

I needed, search a item by a property ( in backend) and show the name of the item with this property 

 I.E: 
- Search: C++
- response:  [{name: "My name to show, ability: "java, C++" }]
  In the documentacion, i don't find it so... i want contribute with this

``` javascript
$('.chosen-ajax').ajaxChosen({
    type: "GET",
    url: "my_path",
    dataType: 'json'
  }, function(data){
     var result = [];    
     for (var i = data.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      var value = data[i];
      /* Only need add search_text with the property */
      result.push({"value" : value.id, "search_text" : value.property  ,text: value.name})
     }
     return result;
   }
)
```

The important Thing is: _search_text_
