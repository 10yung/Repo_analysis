*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

I am running some code containing ES modules (in .mjs files) in a docker container with node:12.10.0 and the `--experimental-modules` flag. I am able to `import opentracing from 'opentracing';` and things work as expected. 

The issue appears when testing the code :

I am using Jest and therefore need to transpile the code through babel-jest. The setup I have works well, except for opentracing. In that case, 'opentracing' ends up being *undefined*, and things like `opentracing.Tags` result in an error. 

I'm not sure exactly what's going wrong, but it seems to be related to the default export handling : 

If I comment out the `Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });` line in `lib/index.js` of opentracing, things work well. 

They work correctly too if I add a `exports.default = exports;` in that file. 

Without touching the opentracing node_module, I was able to make things work in the test environment by calling `import { Tags } from 'opentracing';`, but that does not work in the production environment (i.e. no transpilation process).

Please let me know if I can provide additional information to dig into the issue.
Implementations of many other languages have something like `forEachBaggageItems` on `SpanContext`:

- go: https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go/blob/master/span.go#L21
- java: https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-java/blob/2df2a8983e35dff23c4fb894e5f5ae3f98f1cf7b/opentracing-api/src/main/java/io/opentracing/SpanContext.java#L59
- cpp: https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-cpp/blob/7b8c0b30a26b138dbed714cde8347a0f5f2e060e/include/opentracing/span.h#L27

However, js does not:

https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-javascript/blob/cb74683fefe5bd4d711eaa0c273f3fc17a6c3781/src/span_context.ts#L11-L33
I am working on an implementation of a tracer that handles our organizations specific needs but ideally would use the interfaces defined by opentracing. Maybe I am missing something but I don't see how that would work the way the types are defined now, with classes instead of interfaces.

E.g. if I define my own `Tracer` class that expects certain properties on the `SpanContext`, TypeScript will tell me that these properties don't exist.

```
import { Tracer as OpenTracer, SpanContext } from 'opentracing';

class Tracer extends OpenTracer {
  startSpan(operationName: string, options: ISpanOptions = {}) {
    // ...
    let parent: SpanContext;
    // ...
    span.context.parentId = parent.spanId;
    // -> Property 'parentId' does not exist on type '() => SpanContext'
  }
}
```

If the opentracing types were interfaces, custom implementations could `implement` them and this wouldn't be a problem.

A consumer using my tracing implementation could not expect a span returned by my tracer's `startSpan()` to be of type opentracing `Span`.

Could you provide a few pointers on how you propose to create a custom tracer implementation that still uses the opentracing types?

Thanks 👍
