Hello @skreutzberger,

We would like to use your awesome logging solution in our project, but we have minimum deployment target 10.9 for macOS app. In this PR I'm just fixing compile issues for 10.9 using `#if available` Swift structure.
SPM support starts from 10.10, so this change will affect only those who uses your framework via CocoaPods or git submodules. 
Hope it makes sense.

With regards.
