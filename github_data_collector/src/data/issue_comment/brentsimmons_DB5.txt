This adds support to specify the alpha value of a color in a hex string. If no alpha value is given, it uses ff by default.


This add the ability to prefix a plist value with $ in order to have it reference another key within the plist. Common values can then be reused in the theme without having to reenter them. For example, one could have many keys with a value of '$mainTextColor', and then a single 'mainTextColor' key that references the actual color value. This allows for easier theming when a standard set of colors or numeric values are used throughout an app.

...- font size. It simplify configuration file and make it easier to copy/paste colours

Instead of alpha as a sidecar value to a hex definition, support alpha through rgba definitions.


Small change to add alpha support. Looks for xAlpha in the plist (where x is the same key as the colour key) and defaults to 1.0f if not found.

I find JSON files to be more convenient to edit and work with in diffs. This adds support for DB5.json files.

Will need a tag made in your git repo matching the tag in the s.source setting.
