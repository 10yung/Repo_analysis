when using adaptive_lrate, it runs the script candidate_lrates where the variable max_iter_up is not defined, so an error occurs

There is a small bug

After a couple of hours running example_mnist_mlp.m, it outputs:
Correctly classified test samples: 980/10000

It simply predicts class 1 for all test samples.
I checked it twice and the results are the same. I could not figure out the problem, any help is greatly appreciated.

in line 45, the code should be

subwindow_sum = fspecial('gaussian', C.lcn.neigh);
