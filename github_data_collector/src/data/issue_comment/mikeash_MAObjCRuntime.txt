i got error while compiling in my project. 

I get the following error when compiling a project that has this library as a dependency:

```
MAObjCRuntime/RTProtocol.m:79:13: Definition of 'Protocol' must be imported from module 'ObjectiveC.Protocol' before it is required
```

It seems to only happen with XCode 7.3, running 7.2 side by side compiles and runs just fine. Wondering if something changed in 7.3 or the compiler that causes these issues?

this can resolved by runtimeï¼Ÿ

Hi Mike

Added OS X library and test targets.


....


1) A convenient fetching all recursively incorporated protocols;
2) Easy fetching methods from protocol including methods from recursively incorporated protocols.
