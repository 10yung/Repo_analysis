Hi!
On Rainglow, v1.5.2, 'BOX Uk' theme (contrast and non-contrast versions), selected elements are poorly highlighted:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24476415/71979417-571ebe00-3226-11ea-8a17-8573fc833c37.png)

The same goes for light versions of the same theme.
I suggest some contrast color be used for better visibility.
Thanks.
Being a colorblind person myself, I like the _Vision (Colorblind)_ theme, except some colors are still hard to read for people who have Protanopia. 

>Protanopes are more likely to confuse:-
>1. Black with many shades of red
>2. Dark brown with dark green, dark orange and dark red
>2. Some blues with some reds, purples and dark pinks
>3. Mid-greens with some oranges
>
>[See [source](http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/types-of-colour-blindness/)]

This PR adds the _Vision (colorblind - protanopia)_ theme using the _Vision (Colorblind)_ theme as a base. Here is an example screenshot below.

I appreciated the message from Dayle in the opening of this PR:

>Rainglow has an extensive build process, and so any changes to the themes in this repository will be overwritten upon next build.

Please let me know what I can do to get this theme published. I think it would be a wonderful aid for Protanopes like my self.


Love love love ‚ù£Ô∏è _Rainglow_  Thank you for putting it together. üòÉ 

I have a Feature Request to Add `code tick` syntax highlighting to markdown, ".md" files.

## Deets
- Visual Studio Code for Windows **v 1.28.1** (as of this writing)
- Rainglow **v 1.5.2**
- **Theme**: Joker, all
- **Have you tested** the issue with **other themes**?
    - Yes, works with _Monokai_, but for the most part not any of the _Rainglow_ themes

## Example **Without** Syntax Hightlighting (joker and most themes)

## Example **With** Syntax Hightlighting (monokai themes)

Thanks!

Most themes have bright contrasting status bars... I tend to prefer themes with dark status bars or that blend in with the editor background color.
VSCode, Arstotzka or Arstotzka contrast. Rainglow v1.5.2

IMO this is a little hard to read.  Maybe use `#70807b`?

I'm using the latest version of everything. And I like the light themes very much, especial the ones that are kinda dark (not too bright and not to dark) like peacocks in space, tron, storm light, etc. But there is a problem with the fonts color. The dark versions of those have a font color that fits more, is more recognizable. So please, make the font colors for light themes more suitable for the theme. Or tell us where we can do some changes manually (like string color, operators, classes, methods, numbers, etc).
Otherwise, keep up the great work.

Thank you.
What's the fontfamily used on screenshot?
**Editor:** vscode
**Theme:** Tetra
**Version:** 1.5.2

Secondary buttons are not very readable:

By updating the `button.foreground` property to `#194753` it greatly improves the readability:

Thanks for your awesome work on Rainglow, Dayle. üëè

Just wanted to report that the **Tron** theme is rendering unreadable buttons, white text on top of a white background, as shown on the screenshot below.

The `button.background` property [here](https://github.com/rainglow/vscode/blob/bce9c0e721ea0f2e7ac009305ede772ee0753a89/themes/tron.json#L484)

```
"button.background":"#ffffff",
"button.foreground":"#ffffff",
```

should actually be

```
"button.background":"#267fb5",
"button.foreground":"#ffffff",
```

For some reason Overflow Light theme is missing the commenting color.  Any chance you can add that? All else looks fantastic.

This fixes it pretty much:

```
        {
            "name": "Comment",
            "scope": "comment",
            "settings": {
                "foreground": "#aaaaaa"
            }
        },
```
