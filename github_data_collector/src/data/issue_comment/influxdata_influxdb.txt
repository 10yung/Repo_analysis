Prior to this change, new series would be added to the series file
before checking the series cardinality limit. If the limit was exceeded,
the write was rejected even though the series had already been added to
the series file.

With the introduction of Algo W we have new semantic.MonoType that should be used in place of any semantic.Type instances.

__Steps to reproduce:__
List the minimal actions needed to reproduce the behavior.

1. load up dashboard explorer
2. watch the drop

__Expected behavior:__
Expected to see options and so forth come up from successful query response.

__Actual behavior:__
Error (not found) from bucket name being undefined.

req `http://localhost:8080/api/v2/query?orgID=bacbc10d8e1c6b4d` body: 

```json
{"query":"from(bucket: \"undefined\")\n  |> range(start: -1h, stop: now())\n  |> filter(fn: (r) => true)\n  |> keep(columns: [\"undefined\"])\n  |> group()\n  |> distinct(column: \"undefined\")\n  |> limit(n: 200)\n  |> sort()","dialect":{"annotations":["group","datatype","default"]}}
```

**note**: there multiple `undefined` values stringifed here

resq from query for list of buckets `http://localhost:8080/api/v2/query?orgID=bacbc10d8e1c6b4d`:

```json
{"query":"buckets()\n  |> sort(columns: [\"name\"])\n  |> limit(n: 200)","dialect":{"annotations":["group","datatype","default"]}}
```

resp: 

```csv

__Steps to reproduce:__
List the minimal actions needed to reproduce the behavior.

1. Onboard to the GUI and then create a second organization
2. Switch to the first organization
3. Create some variables
4. Switch to the second organization 
5. View variables

__Expected behavior:__
Assumed that since 
   * the variable structure includes orgId 
   * query variables would refer to buckets specific to the organization 
```
{id: "0518e92b53623000", orgID: "b772d84752daf340", name: "Felix", description: "", selected: null,â€¦}

```

... that variables would be visible _per organization_.  

__Actual behavior:__
I'm seeing variables created in one organization visible in another. 

Question:  Is this by design or is this an issue? 

I can see a case for having variables visible across organizations, but this raises possible security and stability issues.
