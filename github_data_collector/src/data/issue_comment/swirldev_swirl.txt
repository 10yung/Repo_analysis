Hi there,
I am facing issues with installing swirl. I had swirl a few years ago and it then worked just fine. But then recently I uninstalled R and RStudio and installed their latest versions. However, I am unable to load the swirl package.
When I tried to install swirl, I get the below message. 
The issue appears to be with the 'stringi' package.
I would really appreciate if someone could please help me resolve the issue.
Thanks,
Dicky

I cannot get passed the below part of the Swirl Function lesson. When I delete the pound sign in the script, and enter submit() in the Console, a second boring_function.R tab opens, and I get the below response. I'm running this on RStudio. Please advise - thanks! 

The last R expression to be evaluated in a function will become the return value of
| that function. We want this function to take one argument, x, and return x without
| modifying it. Delete the pound sign so that x is returned without any modification.
| Make sure to save your script before you type submit().

| Not quite right, but keep trying.

| Make sure to delete the pound sign so the last expression in the function is just x.

Good evening! I'm working through this course and it's great, but twice I've found that I've entered the correct thing and it's told me I was wrong.

The second one in particular confused me, you can just about see at the bottom that the second time I entered '2' it said 'nice work' when the first time it had said 'Give it another try'.
I have a problem with the "lattice plotting system". I select from the list and I find this error

Error in file(input, encoding = "UTF-8") : invalid 'description' argument

here a pic of the error

I found that no one had the same problem with me on installing swirl.

When I am writing below answer in script 
`evaluate <- function(func, dat){
    func(dat)
  }`

It gives me below error
