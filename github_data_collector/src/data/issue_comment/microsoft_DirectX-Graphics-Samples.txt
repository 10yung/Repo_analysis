Is there a plan to update the D3DX12AffinityLayer to support the DXR API?
Hello, 
Fallback layer is removed. Can you comment why?
I have test on amd and winver 1903 and my device reports that it is not working.
On NVidia I had no issues.

Develop
Update version of the .sln file recommended in the readme
Using the "Git Extensions" program on Windows 10 I get this pair of errors:

error: unable to create file Samples/Desktop/D3D12Raytracing/src/D3D12RaytracingRealTimeDenoisedAmbientOcclusion/RTAO/Shaders/Denoising/CalculateMeanVariance_SeparableFilterCS_CheckerboardSampling_AnyToAnyWaveReadLaneAt.hlsl: Filename too long

error: unable to create file Samples/Desktop/D3D12Raytracing/src/D3D12RaytracingRealTimeDenoisedAmbientOcclusion/RTAO/Shaders/Denoising/DisocclusionBlur_DepthAwareSeparableGaussianFilter3x3CS_AnyToAnyWaveReadLaneAt.hlsl: Filename too long

Manually downloading the zip and pulling these files out works, but it'd be nicer to avoid these long file names.
In addition to use "SPACE" to toggle, the sample should also use ALT+ENTER which is the classically implemented hotkey for window vs. fullscreen since the early days of DX
To be 256-byte aligned, the padding should be 36, as in D3D12ExecuteIndirect.h.
Hi All,

I'm wondering if there are plans to support MulitGPU and or Multithreaded Rendering any time in the near future?

Or at least it would be interesting whats blocking the support as the feature list says that thread safe command context is still experimental?

Regards?

The constant buffer resource does not need to be 1024 * 64?
It's only a suggestion to use blue noise mask instead of Sampler.

Sampler.

Single blue noise 128 x 128 2D texture shifted randomly in each frame.
