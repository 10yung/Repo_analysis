https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59749887/puppeteer-cluster-sometimes-cannot-start-in-k8s
If the "maxConcurrency" option in Cluster.launch is _undefined_ somehow, Cluster never fires any workers and appears to stand still without any errors or warnings.

In my code, I had set the "maxConcurrency" option to a variable, and while refactoring code accidentally set the value to _undefined_ - causing Cluster to never process any queue items.

Maybe Cluster could trigger a warning or error if "maxConcurrency" is set to something non-numeric?
I have several jobs that require running in headless false mode and therefore run them locally on my main machine. 

Because each new page pulls Chromium to the foreground, I can't do anything else while these jobs run.

Is there a way to run headful mode but keep the puppeteer instance in the background?

I tried setting "CONCURRENCY_PAGE" which is better but still pulls the browser to the foreground on each new page.
Hey,
when I tried your example code in headless:false mode it opens a blank page which is idle and stays until the task are completed. And if the task goes on for a long time this blank page is observed to use around 600 Mb.  How can I get rid of that blank page since it consumes some memory ?

Here is your example code which reproduces this issue

```
const { Cluster } = require('../dist');

(async () => {
    // Create a cluster with 2 workers
    const cluster = await Cluster.launch({
  puppeteerOptions: {
            headless: false,
            },
        concurrency: Cluster.CONCURRENCY_CONTEXT,
        maxConcurrency: 2,
    });

    // Define a task (in this case: screenshot of page)
    await cluster.task(async ({ page, data: url }) => {
        await page.goto(url);

        const path = url.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, '_') + '.png';
        await page.screenshot({ path });
        console.log(`Screenshot of ${url} saved: ${path}`);
    });

    // Add some pages to queue
    cluster.queue('https://www.google.com');
    cluster.queue('https://www.wikipedia.org');
    cluster.queue('https://github.com/');

    // Shutdown after everything is done
    await cluster.idle();
    await cluster.close();
})();
```

I have the next script but when I run this script, the console stops to finish the script, I want run this script maybe 1000 or 2000 times at hour I think using puppeteer cluster I can do it

```
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const URL = process.argv[2];

puppeteer.launch({ headless: true, args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox'] }).then(async browser => {

    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.setViewport({width: 1, height: 1});
    await page.setUserAgent('Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 9_0_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/601.1.46 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/9.0 Mobile/13A404 Safari/601.1');

    await page.goto(URL);
    console.error('found');
    await page.waitForSelector('body.blog');
    await browser.close();
    process.exit();

}).catch(function(error) {
    console.error('sucess');
    process.exit();
});
```
