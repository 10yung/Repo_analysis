Добрый день.
Как проверить выбрана хотябы одно дата или нет?

Спасибо.

I mean when pressing the arrow shown in the attached image you would be able to go to next month:

Would it be posible to change calendar behavior so it just displays one month at once (user can just scroll for that month) and pressing that arrow would show next month? (For this case let's consider that the shown month would be June 2018 and when the arrow were to be pressed it would show July 2018).


Hello, rAseri, I can select multiple dates but cannot deselect date.
Could you tell me the way to do that?
I have a REST service that returns an array of dates and an int value, depending of that value, the date will have a specific color. Example:

if the value is between 0 and 50, the color will be green.
if the value is between 51 and 100 the color will be yellow.

and so on.

PD. The library is awsome, the only thing I have left to implement is this, help :(.

Thanks!
Is there a way to change the font family, text size, etc. for the DaysBarView and the header (month/year) of the calendar?  I would like to match the calendar text attributes to the rest of my application,
Hello again!

How can we deal with different timezones? Is there any built-in solution or what is the suggested method?

Thank you.
I've been working with Crunchy Calendar for a couple days and am fitting it into my use case where I need square event indicators and possibly more than 4 indicators showing on each calendar cell. 

Is this something that you might have on the roadmap for this library or would you be willing to look at a PR if I had some suggested changes to have event indicator types?  Or would I be better off maintaining my fork separately? 
Hi,

Again thanks for such a good work.

One feature I like about the google calendar app is that the entry's time will change where in the day it appears. For instance an entry early in the day will be shown high up and a entry at noon should be in the middle of the day view and a entry at night should be by the end of the day box.

Thanks!
