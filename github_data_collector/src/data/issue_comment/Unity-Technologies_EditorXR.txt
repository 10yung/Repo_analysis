Hello!
I would like to know, are there Valve Index & knuckles controllers support are planned?
For consuming EditorXR it would be useful if it was addable via Unity Package Manager, whether as a github feed or as an official Unity package
when i use universal render pipeline i need to update materials and shaders. In the EditorXR case i cant. Is it possible to update the materials and shaders to use URP? Thanks
This shouldn't be necessary if you don't need button input, but the current code assumes you have one of these interfaces.

From forum post: https://forum.unity.com/threads/making-my-first-tool.767813/#post-5127569
Noticed that while sculpting terrain outside of VR the EditorXR is trying to open itself randomly. Despite not pressing the keybind to launch it, I'm noticing that the window opens itself up without prompt and then crashes the entire editor. SteamVR is open outside of it (the Unity project launches that on its own, but  #it just sits idle.)
Hi! 

I don't know exactly what's going on, but I've found that suddenly some UI elements are not selectable using the rays that are sent out from controllers. The strange thing here is that it was working perfectly two days ago. Also, I can confirm they're placed in UI layer. The Unity version I'm using is 2018.1.0f2 (I'm thinking to update it to latest release). Any idea what's happening?

Thanks in advance!
When EXR is open and you open a different scene it will prompt you to save your current scene. This will save the main camera in the scene as disabled.
Using Unity 2017.4.4f1 
Import Package - HoloToolkit-Unity-2017.4.0.0.unitypackage
Window Mixed Reality works fine before Importing EditorXR-0.1.1.unitypackage causes following errors - 

Assets/HoloToolkit/SpatialMapping/Scripts/TapToPlace.cs(155,26): error CS0117: `InputManager' does not contain a definition for `Instance'

Assets/HoloToolkit/SpatialMapping/Scripts/TapToPlace.cs(165,26): error CS0117: `InputManager' does not contain a definition for `Instance'

Assets/HoloToolkit/Utilities/Scripts/HeadsetAdjustment.cs(31,26): error CS0117: `InputManager' does not contain a definition for `Instance'

Is there a way I can fix this or will have to wait for fix?
Not sure what is causing this crash but when using the MegaBook asset from 
http://www.west-racing.com/mf/?page_id=5422

And Accessing the inspector with the main book asset where all the settings live unity hard locks my whole system.
I followed the EVR Guide [V5] instructions and I don't see any visuals in the Oculus, it remains black. In the HMD I do see the chaperone wall, but I don't see the controllers, I do see a small white square down in the lower left of the HMD. In the Unity editor I see the HMD geo tracking and I see the controllers tracking.

After I've installed the EditorXR package I see the following warnings (TextMesh Pro is already installed)

While installing the Oculus Utilities I get the following option (I select Yes)
