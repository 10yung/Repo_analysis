Hello.
I have a problem adding png elements to then svg-element, when using zdog with svg.Is there any way I can add simple 2d svg-png while using zdog.
Thanks.
To avoid call stack overflow when the graph has a large nesting depth.  For example:

```javascript
let illo = new Zdog.Illustration({
    element: '.canvas'
});

let parent = illo;
for (let depth = 0; depth < 1000; depth++) {

    let rotateX = new Zdog.Anchor({
        addTo: parent,
        rotate: { x: Zdog.TAU / 4 }
    });

    let rotateY = new Zdog.Anchor({
        addTo: rotateX,
        rotate: { y: Zdog.TAU / 6 }
    });

    let rotateZ = new Zdog.Anchor({
        addTo: rotateY,
        rotate: { z: Zdog.TAU / 8 }
    });

    parent = rotateZ;
}

illo.updateRenderGraph();
```
Hi,
Congratulation for the project, is amazing how simple and effective this technic is.
The only problem that I found is the difficult is export animated model to use in other game engines, like Phaser 3 JS. A export helper that save all the animation in PNG frames would be very helpful for that job.
For while, I having a lot of pain saving my model using _right click_ and _save as..._ .

One again, great project, I'm very excited to try draw new things.

I hope it can have more interaction with mouse or touch, so that I can use it for Internet of things scenarios.This will be a little Kawaii Internet of things scene, which will be very different.
Hello.
I have a problem adding text elements to the svg-element, when using zdog with svg. 
Is there any way I can add simple 2d svg-text while using zdog.
Thanks.

Great work!  Exploring the potential to use zdog for data visualization applications.  But experiencing an unexpected effect of transparency with the shapes rendered as shown in the screenshot.

```
let box = new Zdog.Box({
        addTo: pointGrp,
        translate: { x: long, y: lat, z: size },
        rotate: { z: Math.PI / 8 },
        width: 15,
        height: 15,
        depth: size*3,
        stroke: false,
        color: '#C25',
        leftFace: color_left,
        rightFace: color_left,
        rearFace: '#ED0',
        topFace: color_left,
        bottomFace: color,
    });
```

Any ideas why this may be happening?

Thanks!

When changing the zoom of an illustration (illo.zoom) and then updating the render graph, the zoom value is ignored. It just stays at the initial value.
Weirdly this doesnt happen on codepen, just on local websites where zdog is used. I dont understand why.

**here it works** https://codepen.io/jacasch/pen/oKWjvx
**here it doesn't** https://github.com/jacasch/zdog-zoom-test

I need to add the drag option, but instead rotate the group move it over canvas without braking the script?
I think this is a simple issue.

I try the simple demo pbut I only get the next error:

Uncaught Error: Zdog.Illustration element required. Set to null
