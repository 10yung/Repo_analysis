Sometimes, like when we are initializing database, the port is accessible but our database is not yet initialized, so we need to wait for database file creation.
This will be a simple feature but a useful one.
Currently the specification of host and port must be in form "{host}:{port}".

In many cases the url to check is already present in the system configuration in form of connection parameter, e.g.: `postgres://username:password@hostname:5432/database`.

However, current implementation does not seem to accept such host and port specification.

Proposed solution:
- require presence of explicit host and port in the url
- rsplit the url on colon `:`
  - hostname: take the left part: rsplit on `/` or `@`, take the last element
  - port: take the right part, split on `/`, take the first element. Check that it includes only digits.

There are very likely better options, I just wanted to express that to me it seems very acceptable to require explicit hostname and port presence to keep the implementation small and simple.
