1. Gaussians missing parenthesis around `sigma**2`. Tuned Gaussian parameters slightly so it still looks like old example.
2. Switched around indices in G in plot title to get correct reward function, i.e. `G[int(w[1]), int(w[0])]` instead of `G[int(w[0]), int(w[1])]`.
Hi,

In [`es.ipynb`](https://github.com/karpathy/randomfun/blob/master/es.ipynb) I noticed that your four Gaussian functions don't have braces around `sigma**2`, looks like this:

`G1 = np.exp(-((X-mux)**2+(Y-muy)**2)/2.0*sigma**2)`
instead of:
`G1 = np.exp(-((X-mux)**2+(Y-muy)**2)/2.0*(sigma**2))`

So you actually multiply by sigma**2 in the exponential function, instead of dividing as you would in a normal Gaussian function.

This doesn't have any consequence for the toy example, I'm just curious if it was intentional (there could be a reason of doing this that I'm not aware of)?
