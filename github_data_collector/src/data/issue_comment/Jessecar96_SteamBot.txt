Is there any option or method for checking things on the marketable in the tradeoffer I was looking for, but it seems that Steam webapi doesnâ€™t even have one? On the other hand, there is such a check in the bot on node.js.
Hi, my bot waits for trade offers and then accepts or declines them.
Usually, the bot handles them automatically when the trade offers come in.
But sometimes it's like the bot is stuck until you press enter. Then the bot realizes "oh there are 4 trade offers still open" and then handles them.

Have you seen this problem before? Is there any fix/workaround where this does not happen?

Let me know your thoughts 
A while ago SteamAuth was updated and removed the field "Description" and it was replaced with ConfType. Obviously when SteamAuth was installed, it would cause an error. ConfType acts the same as Description.
he type or namespace name 'SteamAuth' could not be found. 2017 vs, nuget actived and i tried reinstalling the package
Hey,
I cant start it.
Edited the settings.json but i have no clue where i need to paste my sharedsecret etc.
so i think the bot cant log in... yea

The last time "Session.Accept (Trade Offer Id)" began to return Null. For a long time the bot worked, and recently broke. What could possibly be the matter?
* Updating SteamAuth, SteamKit, and Json.net versions
  *  (not using the latest SteamKit because there was a major version bump! We should update for that)
* Fix bug causing trade offer confirmations to break
* Fix bug causing bot to crash when loading some inventories
* Make `Bot._loadTask` public so bots can wait until load is complete
* Fix bug causing login to not work in some regions

Sorry I didn't pull these into separate PR's ðŸ˜… also sorry for being too lazy to rebase, so there's lots of old empty merge commits
steambot seems to be unable to connect to steam in the current version, bringing up error 503: server unavailable in SteamWeb.cs on line 141 whenever the bot is launched
