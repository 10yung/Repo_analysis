Thanks for amazing library.

How to disable outside click when menu is open?
added a new property to IIViewDeckController and controls centerViewController.view`s origin x
file : IIViewDeckLayoutSupport.m
method : - (CGRect)frameForSide:(IIViewDeckSide)side openSide:(IIViewDeckSide)openSide;
line : 83

CGFloat xOffset = (openSide == IIViewDeckSideLeft ? maxSize.width * 0.1 : -maxSize.width * 0.1);

Why did you hardcoded the value (0.1)?
I need to change the value above via new property of IIViewDeckController in IIViewDeckLayoutSupport.
1、比如划出左侧控制器，中间控制器也会往右移动。2、测滑遮罩会出现黑边（滑动70%～80%）
[self.viewDeckController openSide:IIViewDeckSideLeft animated:NO] ; animated is no can't open side view, but Yes can.
can support carthage?
Swipe to close or Cancel side menu is not working in viewDeck SDK . I was using it with Pod
There are cases where you simply want to do a manual installation of ViewDeck in your project, and want to use the compiled framework as the ViewDeck documentation suggests. Everything will work fine, until upload to the App Store: it will give an error because architectures `i388` and `x86_64` are included in the ViewDeck library, and those are not allowed anymore by Apple.

So for those ViewDeck users, here's a tip to strip these architectures automatically from the compiled framework:

- [Use these steps](http://ikennd.ac/blog/2015/02/stripping-unwanted-architectures-from-dynamic-libraries-in-xcode/).

- There is an improved version of the stripping script [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30547283/submit-to-app-store-issues-unsupported-architecture-x86)
- Make sure you add this build script as a (new) step **after** the "Embed Frameworks" step in build phases, otherwise it won't work.

After doing this, uploading to App Store will work fine again.

As for the ViewDeck developers: a request to remove these architectures from the compiled framework. Thanks in advance!
