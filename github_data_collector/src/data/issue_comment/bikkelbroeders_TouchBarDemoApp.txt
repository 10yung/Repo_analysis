The TouchBarDemoApp seems to be broken on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro. When TouchBarDemoApp is running the Touch Bar goes completely blank/black, and doesn't come back to life until TouchBarDemoApp is closed. I assume because the 16-inch MacBook Pro Touch Bar is a different width to the original, some code needs to be modified to allow for this?

Any ideas @bikkelbroeders?
Not sure if this project is dead or not, if it isn't I could use some help, everything looks as it should be with one exception the touch doesn't work on touch bar... The on-screen keyboard works fine but the bar is not responsive to touch, the content changes with the applications so it's not frozen.

The iPad is Air3 and it's connected to 2017 Imac on Catalina.
The Client does not show the TouchBar on launch. If I go to the Home screen and reactivate the app, it starts working.

I’m running from the latest source code.

The problem is that on app launch `startListening` is called twice in a row: 

- `-[ViewController viewDidAppear:]`
- `UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification` notification

The second call fails with: 

> TouchBarClient[626:55698] Failed to listen on localhost:1337: Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=48 "Address already in use”

Here’s what my print debugging looks like when I start the Client:

```
// -[ViewController viewDidAppear:]
stopListening: (null)
startListening: <PTChannel: 0x2824aeac0 (closed)>
listenOnPort callback: <PTChannel: 0x2824aeac0 (listening)>

// UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification
stopListening: <PTChannel: 0x2824aeac0 (listening)>
startListening: <PTChannel: 0x28245db40 (closed)>
listenOnPort callback: <PTChannel: 0x28245db40 (closed)>
Failed to listen on localhost:1337: Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=48 "Address already in use"

```

Maybe a fix should be to check if is already listening and then skip unnecessary stop/restart.
If the App is executed on the iPad 2 (9.3.5) is throws an error.

PS: TouchBar for Mac runs normal and displays the TouchBar on the screen if FN-key is pressed.
[Suggestion] Adaptive iPhone small screen & Add touchpad mode

I noticed the changelog says this issue is fixed in V1.6 but it turns out there's still an issue :(. I've tried changing the toggle key but it's the same problem with all of them. It sometimes works and it sometimes doesn't.
Two things:

1. Every key except the fn key works. Unfortunately, that is the key I need to use.
2. How do I get my function keys back? The entire row is not accessible after uninstalling.

Thanks.

Is that mean 10.12.3(16D32) cannot be support?


Would it be possible to have the touchbar only work on the desktop so that it doesn't obstruct the display of fullscreen apps and videos? It did this in an earlier version, but I was wondering if it would be possible to add a toggle to enable/disable it in fullscreen, and have it only function on the desktop like before
