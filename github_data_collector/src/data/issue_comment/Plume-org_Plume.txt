Many activitypub servers are starting to enable Mastodon style authorized fetch for security reasons. As plume does not sign the user fetches, this means it is not possible to fetch actor information from these servers 

The current solution is rather hacky, but it is the best we can figure out without more input and guidance. The ideal solution is to have a quasi actor that can sign these requests and be transparent to the user. As of now it merely fetches the first local user that comes to hand and signs the request with their information.

Currently, there is no data structure used to save update metadata on a blog entry.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Add updated field to a blog entry then add this metadata on the blog page.

for example :

**Additional context**

This feature is also required by #673
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

I am frustrated that Plume insists on capitalizing my blog names and tags, when I have taken care to enter lowercase words only. The funny thing is that the slug for blog entries are all lowercase, even when one or more words have been capitalized.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

I would like Plume to use the casing I have entered, instead of second-guessing me.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

In my opinion, the entire URL ought to be lowercased, no matter what has been entered. The on-page text should be displayed exactly as entered by the author.

Cheers.

As soon as I created my account, some bot elsewhere on the fediverse called "Federation Bot" immediately followed me. To prevent things like this, I'd like to be able to manually approve or deny requests for a follow / subscription instead of having it just go through.

This won't affect Atom feeds, of course, but it does stop rogue fediverse bots like this trying to mass-follow people.
<!-- Describe your bug, explaining how to reproduce it, and what was expected -->
I published an article on https://fediverse.blog

I expected that the article would be editable after publishing, e.g. for updating or correcting mistakes.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

It may be hard to understand why a post is in one of our timelines, especially in the case of someone boosting/linking someone else you don't follow, or when the same post appears multiple times because it got boosted.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Adding a little "X boosted/liked" indicator to each concerned card

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

None?

From #711 
Hi

<!-- Describe your bug, explaining how to reproduce it, and what was expected -->

I run an update from source code 0.3.0 to 0.4.0.

I run this command : 

```
cargo web deploy -p plume-front

# Update plm
cargo install --path plume-cli --force --features DATABASE
# Update plume
cargo install --path . --force --no-default-features --features DATABASE
```
and
```
plm migration run

Configuration read from /var/www/plume/www/.env
Running migration 20190620145757
Running migration 20190624101212
Running migration 20191210104935
```

After this step, I restart Plume and it crash.

<!-- Please fill the following information when relevant (or remove them if not) -->

So, I run plume without backtrace enable and when I going to landing page I have this log :

Regard

When publishing an article, it gets duplicated in timelines after some time.

It looks like duplication happens every time someone likes or boosts the post (from the same instance, or from another one), but I'm not 100% sure.

I had the light theme, I modified my profile, the theme was "Default theme" and I didn't touch the combobox at all, I saved my changes, I had no theme.

When explicitly setting another theme, it works, when explicitely setting it back to "Default theme", I have no theme again.
