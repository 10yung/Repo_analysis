Hello,

I'm experiencing an issue when changing the scope and sending to the first position at the same time for 2 rows inside a transaction, and I'm suspecting it's because I'm around `MIN_RANK_VALUE`.

I don't know if I'm doing something wrong of if this is a legitimate bug, here's the information I've gathered so far:

### My situation:

#### Table creation:
`t.bigint :row_order, null: false`

#### Model
```rb
include RankedModel
ranks :row_order, with_same: %i[scope_1 scope_2]
```

#### All rows with scope_1 = 114
```
id      row_order   scope_1 scope_2
12470	-2147483646	114     18
12464	-2147483644	114     18
12463	429496729	114     18
12454	1288490188	114     18
12462	-2147352576	114
12460	-1879048192	114
12459	-1610612736	114
12465	-1342177280	114
12458	-1073741824	114
12445	-536870912	114
14525	0           	114
```

### What I'm doing:
Inside a transaction:
 - Updating 12459 with `scope_2 = 18` and `row_order_position = :first`
 - Updating 12462 with `scope_2 = 18` and `row_order_position = :first`

#### My Code (renamed):

```rb
MyClass.transaction do
  my_instances # [MyClass<#12462>, MyClass<#12459>]
    .reverse_each do |my_instance|
      my_instance.lock!
      my_instance.update!(scope_2: Scope2<id: 18>, row_order_position: :first)
    end
end
```

#### The crash

The first update (for `id: 12459`) seems to go through, but the second one fails here:
(And then everything gets rolled back)

### Gut feeling:
I don't have a good grasp of what the gem is trying to accomplish in that method but, it seems like I'm only getting in that method because:
- my first update (for `id: 12459`) must set `row_order` to be before element `id: 12470` (which has row_order `-2147483646`), so it must end up being `-2147483647` or `-2147483648`.
- But now my second update (for `id: 12462`) must do the same thing, and would probably need row_order `-2147483648` or **below** which is the `MIN_RANK_VALUE`, which probably triggers the call to `rebalance_ranks`
- `current_order` does not have the current `instance` so `origin` is `nil`, and we get the crash at the comparison

=> I feel like the fix might be something along the lines of:
- pre-adding the current instance to `current_order` when the scope is changing at the same time.
- adding a check on `origin.nil?`
- casting `origin.to_i` to get `nil => 0`, or maybe it should take a higher value than destination then? Not quite sure.

Anyways I hope this is clear enough and helpful, let me know if you'd like more information or clarification.

Thank you 🙏 
I took a shot at moving the CI pipeline to Github Actions to see if it adds value to the project. Seeing two benefits right now:

1. Faster builds. Taking less than 30 minutes ([example](https://github.com/janklimo/ranked-model/commit/27a68fb838e593ed6b98551caf6f0e1c2aef3530/checks?check_suite_id=395429930)), so faster than Travis despite running more jobs.
1. More flexibility defining services. E.g. testing on MySQL 8 which isn't available on Travis afaik.

**Notable changes:**

1. Updated lockfiles and moved them back into version control. This is to enable caching in CI based on checksums of these files.
1. Added Ruby 2.7 to the matrix.

**Future work:**

1. Couldn't make MySQL work with JRuby. Since I don't use either of those, it would be nice to get help from contributors who do.
1. Testing on MySQL 8 breaks due to invalid SQL. Again, I'd like to get eyes on it from some MySQL users.

Interested in migrating or sticking to Travis?

Adding an option for preferred gap size between ranked models which is being used when adding items first and last. It's also used when `rebalancing_ranks` is triggered. 

Doing it because we're using the gem together with Ember and some drag n drop. Users tend to drag a lot of items to the top (`:first`). We want to avoid collisions as much as possible, cause when we're touching other models than the one being updated, the data is no longer synced between front and backend.

Do whatever you want with this PR, just throwing it out there.
Hello,

when using mobility (json backend) in combination with ranked model, we see that when we update the position ranked model also tries to save the translations columns as null (instead of an empty hash which is the default behaviour)

Following test case shows the issue, funny enough if I remove the `with_same` option it all works fine and `placeholder` does not get updated. You need a database called `scratches` with postgres to run the file.

```ruby
require "bundler/inline"

gemfile(true) do
  source "https://rubygems.org"

  git_source(:github) { |repo| "https://github.com/#{repo}.git" }

  # Activate the gem you are reporting the issue against.
  gem "activerecord", "~> 5.2.0"
  gem "pg"
  gem 'ranked-model'
  gem 'mobility'
  gem 'enumerize'
end

require "active_record"
require "minitest/autorun"
require "logger"

Mobility.configure do |config|
  config.default_backend = :jsonb
  config.accessor_method = :translates
  config.query_method = :i18n
  config.default_options[:locale_accessors] = true
  config.default_options[:fallbacks] = true
  config.default_options[:dirty] = true
end


# This connection will do for database-independent bug reports.
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: "postgresql", database: "scratches")
ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)

ActiveRecord::Schema.define do
  drop_table :registration_form_fields, if_exists: true
  drop_table :registration_forms, if_exists: true

  create_table :registration_forms, force: true do |t|
    t.string :name, null: false
  end

  create_table :registration_form_fields, force: true do |t|
    t.string :name, null: false
    t.jsonb :label, default: {}, null: false
    t.jsonb :placeholder, default: {}, null: false
    t.integer :row_order
    t.belongs_to :registration_form, foreign_key: true, index: true, null: false
  end
end

class RegistrationForm < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :fields, class_name: 'RegistrationFormField', dependent: :destroy, inverse_of: :registration_form
end

class RegistrationFormField < ActiveRecord::Base
  include RankedModel
  extend Mobility

  belongs_to :registration_form

  ranks :row_order, with_same: :registration_form_id

  translates :label, type: :string
  translates :placeholder, type: :string
end

class BugTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_association_stuff
    registration_from = RegistrationForm.create!(name: 'jefke')
    puts registration_from.fields.create!(name: 'email', label: 'email')

    registration_from.fields.first.reload

    registration_from.fields.first.update!(row_order_position: 1)
  end
end
```


I'm evaluating implementing this gem on a project with lots of existing records.

I couldn't find any info in the docs about how to correctly migrate data.

Here's my model:

```ruby
module Properties
  class Image < ApplicationRecord
    include RankedModel
    ranks :sort_order, with_same: :property_id
  end
end
```

there is a unique index on these columns (I'm using Postgres):

```ruby
add_column :properties_images, :sort_order, :integer
add_index :properties_images, [:property_id, :sort_order], unique: true
```

Here's the migration script that keeps failing due to a violated uniqueness constraint:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
  Property.all.find_each do |property|
    Properties::Image.where(property: property).order(created_at: :desc).each_with_index do |image, index|
      image.update(sort_order_position: index)
    end
  end
end
```

What's the recommended way to populate the new column once this gem is installed?
- Adds a general 'cannot rearrange' functionality
- leverages it to abort save when cannot re-arrange

Alternate strategy to #148
Extracted from #148

- Remove trailing whitespace
- Make --only-failures possible
- Always call super from included
- Have less activerecord::base envy
None
A take on 'first do no harm' when seeing the occasional

```
NoMethodError: undefined method `rank' for nil:NilClass (Most recent call first)


File /app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.6.0/gems/ranked-model-0.4.4/lib/ranked-model/ranker.rb line 188 in rearrange_ranks
```

There are various possible strategies for handling a missing 'current_x'
- reset cache and retry
- make a best effort with what we know
- calculate 'freshness' of the current instance and do something when not fresh
  - have a pluggable strategy when no longer fresh
- try to lock the re-reranking
