When we set :nested_wrapper to false, the <div class="fields"> is not created...

https://github.com/ryanb/nested_form/blob/1b0689dfb4d230ceabd278eba159fcb02f23c68a/vendor/assets/javascripts/jquery_nested_form.js#L76

The removeFields function should consider this when hiding triggering the nested:fieldRemoved event.
Also, some documentation about :nested_wrapper => false should be added too... probably with instructions saying that when nested_wrapper is false, you must hide content by yourself or something like that...
I want to write a jquery function when "collection_select" changes, but my event does not work for new fields.
What function or callback should I use?

Using nested_forms in rails for association forms.

Survey model

`has_many :questions`

Question model

`has_many :options`

In survey form when I click on

`<%= f.link_to_add "Add More Questions", :questions %>`

Question fields open but options fields not open.It open by click on  `<%= question.link_to_add "Add more options", :options %>`

I want when I click on add more questions , option fields also appear.

I have this:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36960235/rails-nested-form-recursive

And the problem here is nested_form creating the partial recursively until exausts.
I think the problem is nested_form creating multiple blueprint for each partial.

How can I solve this problem? Thanks in advance!

link_to_remove is not deleted vale only hide that so when we update that send hide value in parameter so my races is not updated,

So i want remove that value after click the Remove field.

Please help me

I have nested attributes in my form. I want to limit it to 4. I tried to follow this instruction with no luck: [Limit-max-count-of-nested-fields](https://github.com/ryanb/nested_form/wiki/How-To:-Limit-max-count-of-nested-fields) 

Is it any other solutions I can follow?

Thanks in advanced

I'm using `simple_nested_form_for` to build a form with nested fields. When I press submit, I get the correct params hash, and validation seems to work. When after some validations do not pass I re-render the form via the `create` action, however, the nested fields are displayed incorrectly. The same nested fields are shown multiple times. 

Also, in my  `simple_fields_for` the `FormBuilder` `index` is shown as a semi random number such as `1454793731550`, whereas after re-rendering it is displayed in normal increments `0-n`.

Hi,

I'm trying build a nested form using `simple_nested_form_for`. I want to create a counter that changes incrementally with each added field. As following: Field 1, Field 2, etc.; `field_1_id`, `field_2_id`, etc.

I expected to be able to use the FormBuilder Object's index (e.g. `f.index`). This does start with '0', but the next iteration then becomes a semi-random number like '1454666984988'. 

I also trield putting the nested field code in a partial and then counting the number in the collection using `partial_counter + 1`. Unfortunately, the counter does not seem to increase incrementally at all, and just yeilds yields Field 1, Field 1, etc.....

Is there a way to do this in Ruby, or will I have to use javascript?

bug fix:
Because removeFields did not remove the required attribute, submit button not work(error: An invalid form control with name='' is not focusable).
