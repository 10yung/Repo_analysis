##### Description

I'm trying to run the vprof profiler on a script that accepts cmdline arguments.
I want to use it on the following command:

`./tw_gcal_sync --gcal-calendar 'TW Reminders' --taskwarrior-tag 'remindme'`

When I run that command on its own it works fine, but when I prepend  `vprof` as in the following case my script complains about invalid extra arguments. Here's the complete output

```
~/taskw_gcal_sync$ vprof -c cmh  "./tw_gcal_sync --gcal-calendar 'TW Reminders' --taskwarrior-tag 'remindme'"
Running MemoryProfiler...
Usage: tw_gcal_sync [OPTIONS]
Try "tw_gcal_sync --help" for help.
Error: Got unexpected extra argument (Reminders')
Running FlameGraphProfiler...
Usage: tw_gcal_sync [OPTIONS]
Try "tw_gcal_sync --help" for help.
Error: Got unexpected extra argument (Reminders')
Running CodeHeatmapProfiler...
Usage: tw_gcal_sync [OPTIONS]
Try "tw_gcal_sync --help" for help.
Error: Got unexpected extra argument (Reminders')
```

##### How to reproduce

I think it's down to wrong management of multi-word arguments of the script under profiling.
If I run the same command and substitute `TW Reminders` with just `TW` it works fine.

Just run vprof with a script that accepts multi-word arguments. It will split them into separate arguments

##### Version and platform

Installed via pip - 0.37.6

##### Description
Code has 187 lines including white space and comments. It would take a few minutes to run. I couldn't even run it on my work laptop without it crashing.
##### How to reproduce
Run the profilers? That's all I'm doing
##### Actual results
As measured on my home computer, 7.78 GB of ram needed to display the results after running the code. **EDIT:** correction it takes gigs to generate the heatmap, and only sometimes takes a lot of ram to display the results.
##### Expected results
A few megs or even up to a gig of ram.
##### Version and platform
version 0.37.6 on Ubuntu 18.04 (work) Windows 10/Ubuntu 18.04 (home) python 3.6

2. add a demo.py script
3. python -m vprof -c h demo.py
##### Actual results
1. No error
2. Not terminated
##### Expected results
Get the code heatmap

Hello,

I have a project need multiprocessing and would take over 4 hour in a 36cores vps .
My local machine is  windows, has some problem to run mprof .

So I run `vprof -c cmh "run.py salecount -n 1" --output-file profile.json`  on a remote vps .
Because vprof didn't support multiprocessing , I can't wait it done .
Abort from execution, it didn't export any files .

What is the correct way in my case ??

##### Description
Large numbers are not too human readable. For example 90000000 is not clear, it is not immediately visible is it 9 million, 90 million, or 900 million. Alternatives like "90 000 000", "90M" would be far more readable.

##### How to reproduce
`vprof -c h python-script.py`

##### Actual results
Popup window has `Run count: 90000000`

##### Expected results
Popup window has `Run count: 90 000 000`

No error.

##### Version and platform
Gives error:
Python version: Python 3.6.5 :: Anaconda, Inc.
vprof version: 0.37.6
OS: Ubuntu 16.04 in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

Does not give error:
Python version: Python 3.6.6 :: Anaconda, Inc.
vprof version: 0.37.6
OS: Ubuntu 18.04 native (that is, not WSL)

The code heatmap is more important than the flame graph for me, but it might be interesting to know that this error exists anyway.

Thank you for building this awesome piece of software :)

@nvdv I have successfully build vprof for linux and mac osx, but I am failing on Windows; I can't understand if this is a problem with vprof or with appveyor which is testing the build.

Could you please have a look? [recipe](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/5187)

Thanks :)
