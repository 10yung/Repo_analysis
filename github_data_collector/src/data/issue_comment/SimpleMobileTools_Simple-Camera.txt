Im using v5.1.1
When taking pictures, the picture actually taken does not match the image on the screen.

This is a screenshot of what the app shows me. Note that it looks vertically compressed.

This is the picture that is taken. It lacks a substantial part on the top and bottom.

Samsung A3 (2017), Android 8.0.0.





Hi, I tried to start a video capture, but had the following Error:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Surface was abandoned.

Obviously it didn't start to take a video.

It's an Android 9
Model name: Nokia 6.1 Plus.

How to reproduce? Zoom all the way in.
Using version 5.1.1 of the app on my Samsung S8+ (although with LOS16 and not Samsung's official ROM) I experience that I can focus manually once only. After that the focus seem to be fixed. I can neither refocus manually or use autofocus.

A work around is to switch between video and photo mode. 
I just installed Simple Camera, and it gives me a black screen.When I click the shutter icon or the flash icon, I get "Camara unavailable".

I'm using replicant 6 as my OS, on a Samsung i9300. 
Hi
I really love this easy to use camera app and would love it even more, if it would allow for an (optional?) HDR mode (high dynamic range) to take nicer pictures in high contrast scenarios.
What do you think about this? In my opinion it's the only point where it's lacking behind e.g. the Google Camera App...
Somehow since v5.1.0 images taken in portrait mode on my phone are saved 90 deg right rotated. This seems to be connected to the "Safe photo exif metadata" setting, which I used to have disabled.

I take landscape mode images by rotating my phone 90 deg left, because that feels natural to me, but I tested both variants. Landscape mode seems to be detected corretly (at least the icons are rotating when tilting the phone).

I am assuming landscape images should be saved such that a photo of e.g. a document with text taken in landscape mode can be read normally in portait mode.

||exif ON | exif OFF |
|---|---|---|
|Portait| :heavy_check_mark: | :x: image rotated 90 deg right |
|Landscape (rotate phone 90 deg left)| :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark:  |
|Landscape (rotate phone 90 deg right)| :heavy_check_mark: | :x: image rotated 180 deg |

As a workaround I can enable the use of exif metadata but I'd rather prefer the images to be rotated correctly without the need to write any metadata.

When I use portrait mode, it seems fine, but when I go into landscape, the viewfinder view is still vertical, although the camera view is now horizontal.

Here is a link to a video that I saved to my Drive account, showing the problem.
