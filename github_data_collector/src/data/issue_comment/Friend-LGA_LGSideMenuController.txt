I am having a problem with our rollout of iOS 13 changes and I have been running on devices with a notch (iPhone X & iPhone 11 Pro). The nav bar in our app is appearing under the notch on those devices, so I looked at the demo app and found it doing the same thing. Is there an issue with LGSideMenu for devices with a notch or is the demo and our app not doing something that it needs to to account for the notch?
Hello before you thank the work done in the library. My side menu is not shown in full screen is cut to the height of the main menu, what am I doing wrong ?. My configuration is this:

`SideMainVC *sideMainController=[[SideMainVC alloc] initWithNibName:@"SideMain" bundle:nil];
  
        MainPrincipalVC *mainPrincipal = [[MainPrincipalVC alloc] init];

  
    
    LGSideMenuController *sideMenuController = [LGSideMenuController sideMenuControllerWithRootViewController:mainPrincipal
                                                                                           leftViewController:sideMainController
                                                                                          rightViewController:nil];
    sideMenuController.leftViewWidth = 250.0;
    sideMenuController.leftViewPresentationStyle = LGSideMenuPresentationStyleScaleFromBig;
    sideMenuController.leftViewBackgroundBlurEffect = [UIBlurEffect effectWithStyle:UIBlurEffectStyleRegular];`

Thanks you
Many people will be moving away from CocoaPods and Carthage and using Swift Package Manager (Dependencies). Can you please add support? Thank you!
If I try to interact with my left view right after it appears it won't recognize my interaction. It seems that it takes a second or so for the view to start recognizing taps after the animation ends. Any fix suggested? 
The quick start is supper confusing as is the documentation... i can not find any video documentaion or other resources...

These delegate methods apply both to tap gestures and to pan gestures for hiding/showing.
