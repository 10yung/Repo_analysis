The shake-to-reset is really nice when going to sleep, but in the next morning, it has the obscure side-effect of turning the audiobook back on. This happens when you pick up the phone first time after waking up. Sometimes passively moving the phone on the bed is enough. 

It would be nice if shake-reset or maybe even the whole app would stop after more than a few hours of inactivity.

Not a bug, but a feature request: 
Voice seems to display the "album" id3-tag only. For audiobooks this seems to be okay, but for podcasts all episodes look the same (because they usually all have the same "album" tag). It would be great if you could add an option to display the "title" and "artist" id3 tag, too.
Issue #934 seems to be about the same problem. Displaying the filename could also solve it, but I think displaying the id3 tags is a nicer solution ;-)
Certain podcasts are split into parts, but it's not possible to see which part is which in Voice

Is there a way to delete audio files directly from the app?

Best regards



When you have a bluetooth headset connected it will automatically bring up the player in the notification. If you dismiss it after some time the notification in the attached image appears. It can not be dismissed, the only way to remove it is to force close the app.

None of these things were happening before updating to android 10.

Please include the following details in your bug report:

The app controls keep disappearing from the notification bar if I pause the book and go away from my phone.

Seems to be a more general issue that appeared after the latest android update + airpods firmware update that mainly affects media (i.e. calls, whatsapp, etc work just fine)

P.S. I love the app! Thanks for doing this :) 


Please, add a possibility to turn off the grouping by Current and Completed.
I want to have a single list of audiobooks.

App-Version: 4.3.2


I would like it if it was possible to see how long you have been playing each audiobook on your list, instead of only how long is left. I believe that was the case on an earlier version as well.
