Intro:
A project with microservice architecture. 12 repositories. 

actual: 
Can't visualize all activity for all repositories. Only one repo and then have the necessity to combine rendered video to one file by video redactor. 
And I can’t do video well with multi repositories timing scaling and consolidation by hand. 

expected:
List of .git folders input. Independent visualization for each. 
Every time I want to use gource I google "gource docker" but there are old/unmaintained images with confusing configurations.

Can you please create an official up-to-date docker image and place the link on the site (and github readme)?

If you don't have time, I can create the Dockerfile and explain how to configure docker hub to build it automatically from github releases/tags.
For my dotfiles, I use a bare git repo in my `$HOME`, with a command:

```
➜ ~ which dcnf
dcnf: aliased to /usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME
```

I can't find a way for Gource to visualise these setups, however. It would be good to have similar options to the `git` command
This may be due to a misunderstand on my part as to what this option is supposed to do. My understanding is that during simulation all events of a day are compressed into the amount of seconds given, so if I give --seconds-per-day 4, every 4 seconds 24 hours pass in the simulation.

However using this option does not seem to be changing the simulation speed at all.
I always get such a segfault when using gource, even on  a 1-commit test git repo.
I  use gource like this:

```
gource /home/varac/oas/testgit -o gource.ppm
```

and journalctl shows:

```
kernel: gnome-screensav[9696]: segfault at 211 ip 00007effa0e9cb2d sp 00007ffff6b21ac0 error 4 in libX11.so.6.3.0[7effa0e80000+8b000]
```

I'm using gource `0.49-1build1` on Ubuntu 19.10 with sway/wayland (maybe this is related to the libX11 segfault) ?
Option for setting blob-size to match file size.
Color green-yellow-red for how often file was changed in the last x days
Color green-yellow-red for how many different developers changed the file in the last x days


The [custom log format](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource/wiki/Custom-Log-Format) and [captions](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource/wiki/Captions) use Unix timestamps, which aren't user-friendly.

I propose that the reader check if "-" is in the time, and if so, interpret the time as an ISO 8601 format datetime per [W3C Note-datetime](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime). That is, "YYYY-MM-DD" optionally followed by "Thh:mm[:ss][offset]".
Sometimes the same user might have committed to the same source under multiple usernames. Maybe the username changed (got bored, got married, etc), or maybe they accidentally committed using the wrong account. Who knows? But it's possible.

It would be nice to be able to provide a username and a list of aliases that can all be grouped under that one username when displaying the video.

A user may be doing the work of two developers, but it's still off putting to actually see two developers show up. :)
Since version 0.5 ffmpeg comes back with the errors/warnings 

`Stream #0: not enough frames to estimate rate; consider increasing probesize` 

(but increasing probesize doesn't help) and 

`Invalid data found when processing input`

 when using the command line 

```gource -1280x720 -o - | ffmpeg -y -r 60 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm -i - -vcodec libx264 -preset ultrafast -pix_fmt yuv420p -crf 1 -threads 0 -bf 0 gource.mp4``` 

as used in [this](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource/wiki/Videos) example. This also applies to WebM encoding and for the method where you first go via the raw (ppm) video. ffmpeg always fails at the same second mark in my input file so it seems there's something there which it doesn't like?
```
$ gource --time-scale 20
gource: time-scale outside of range 0.0 - 4.0
Try 'gource --help' for more information.
```

I wish to make the time scale significantly faster than the current maximum of 4, my desired time scale is 20. I've tried recording at a time scale of 4 and then speeding up the recording, but this doesn't look right due to the animations being sped up.

Why is there a hard limit placed at 4? Are there technical problems with faster time scales?
