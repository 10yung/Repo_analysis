# Instalation of Arduino Create Agent on Debian 10

Installation of the plugin does not seem to work, however, it can be noted that the process proceeds without apparent problems, and that no error messages are returned, however the plugin does not work.

Hello I love Arduino but I cloudn't find any documentation about API or HTTP requests in Arduino's Website. I found aRest but this is a project which is from Arduino's fan and not from the Arduino's Team. aRest is really good but is missing many things like change the variable value with an API request.

Simple GSM shield Manager for Blynk and ESP32 / ESP8266 boards, with or without SSL, configuration data saved in SPIFFS / EEPROM.
Library is used for configuring/auto(re)connecting GSM shields to Internet and Blynk at runtime.

Thanks and Regards,
Dear Arduino Team,

Could you please add my ESP OTA GitHub library to the library manager?

Issue #1315 is not yet solved. 
A description of the error can be found here:
https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues/1315#issue-11938798

It refers to the Serial Tutorial:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SoftwareSerial
The size of the IDE serial monitor window is adjustable by grabbing the edge of the window, but only down to a minimum.

The minimum width of the IDE serial monitor window is too large and it fills a large portion of the screen.
This behavior is new with 1.8.10 (or possibly earlier). I use mac os. The limits to the size of the window should be similar to the limits for the main IDE window.

The screen shot shows both windows at their minimum size.

I downloaded the windows app for arduino ide. But i got constant compiling error that did not make sense. I then uninstalled the app and downloaded the original Ide. I then used the exact same code that got compiling errors. And it compiled and uploaded with no problems.
I think it maybe has something to do with the the way libraries are handled by the Ide.
Hello, Arduino MKR1010 with WIFININA and MQTT (PubSubClient) disconnected after 20min. I upgraded WIFININA and I use the last version WIFININA.
