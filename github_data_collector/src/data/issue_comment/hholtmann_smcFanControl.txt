MacBook Air (2017). macOS 10.14.6. smcFanControl 2.6.

Changes to fan speeds don't take.

Some times the fan speeds up after a while, but mostly not.

Doesn't work via the CLI either. (Reading back the fan value gives the value I've asked for, though the fan itself does not adhere to the value.)

Had no problems with this with earlier Macs, so may be related to this particular model.

PS! Enclosing my CLI tools, maybe they could be of use to someone (or could be included in the basic product for ease of use.)

```
alias smc="/Applications/smcFanControl.app/Contents/Resources/smc"

smcr() {
  smc -k $1 -r | cut -d " " -f 7
}

fan() {
  if [[ $# -eq 1 ]]; then
    smc -k F0Mn -w $(printf "%x" $(echo $(($1 << 2))))
  else
    printf "%.0f\n" $(smcr F0Mn)
  fi
}
```

run in Mac OS 10.15.1 Catalina it show me error Security Error: smc-binary is not the distributed one
I just received my new 16-inch MacBook Pro (MacBookPro16,1) with an 8-core 2.4 GHz CPU, and of course, I wanted to customize the fan profiles using smcFanControl.  Unfortunately, there seem to be enough software/hardware changes that fan speeds are reported incorrectly and cannot currently be modified.
I was wondering whether smcFanControl is capable of raising the maximum fan speed above the default factory maximum (putting aside concerns about whether doing so would be sensible)?

setting the speed, and there is no effect...
Dear Holtman, thanks a lot for the development. The app works fine for me. However, recently I had an issue with my macbook pro 2017 and reset the smc, nvram and wiped the hard drive. I am planning to do a time machine restore on my mac with a backup that comes with SMC app installled. Will the backup from the SMC app have the same settings as before given I reset smc, nvram and wipped the hard-drive when there was problem with my mac?

As the title says, smc doesn't control the fan. :( The beta version does, however, correctly display fan speed and temperature. 

The "Macs Fan Control" software is able to control the fan successfully... so it would seem that there is a way.

Output of 'smc -f':

Total fans in system: 1

Fan #0:
    Actual speed : 1690
    Minimum speed: 1700
    Maximum speed: 4400
    Safe speed   : 0
    Target speed : 1700
    Mode         : auto

I have a MBP 13" early 11, with Mavericks 10.9.5, using smcFC 2.6

The app immediately crashes after launch and i get this Console message:

Thanks for all your effort :)
