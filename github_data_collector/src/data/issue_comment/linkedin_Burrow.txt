Is there a limitation on number of clusters which burrow can monitor?
This PR adds the ability to connect to Kafka via SASL-SCRAM 256 or 512

It adds an entry in the SASL Profile configuration called
key=mechanism
value type=string
required=no
default value=(empty)
Which accepts either values SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512

Partially addresses #526
According to git history a "group-blacklist" option is add for the "inmemory" Storage around 2 years ago. My testing shows that this is the only way to actually remove a consumer group from the returned list of consumer groups when calling "/v3/kafka/local/consumer".
Following is my suggestion for change of the Configuration.md file in the Wiki, as far as I understand one cannot make a PR for a Wiki page.

This PR adds the ability to configure an allowed lag and thereby fixes or better works around problems with Streams transaction feature.

With Exactly-Once Semantics enabled Kafka Streams producers create [control messages](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Transactional+Messaging+in+Kafka) that are seen as a constant lag of one by Kafkas CLI and also by Burrow. As a result Burrow always returns stopped state for those topics/partitions making it useless for our current setup with EOS enabled.

Addresses https://github.com/linkedin/Burrow/issues/570
burrow consumer group status is not updated in time
for example:

I'm manually delete the consumer group named test01.
after i did that, burrow still alert the test01 in state error. but  there is no consumer group test01 exist.
only restart burrow can make consumer group status back to normal.
my questions is why burrow can not automatic detect the consumer group status ? 

burrow version is `1.2.2`
kafka version is `2.1.1`
Hi i'm using the latest version of Burrow with a Kafka Cluster V2.3.1. 
It is working well but I get those Warning messages:

{"level":"warn","ts":1575366398.2769194,"msg":"failed to decode","type":"module","coordinator":"consumer","class":"kafka","name":"kafkaconsumer","offset_topic":"smf","offset_partition":0,"offset_offset":2338203,"reason":"key version","version":27493}

I think there is something wrong with the key version (see attached picture). Maybe it can't decode it because Kafka version 2.3.1 is not supported. Am I right?

Thank you!

Is it possible to use SASL_PLAINTEXT (Kerberos) with Burrow and if yes how to configure the jaas file path ?
I get metrics for all of the topics (i see all of the topic names in the metrics list), but for some reason not for all of the consumer groups.
