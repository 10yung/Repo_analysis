i am mentioning link without https 
case-1 :
if it is the starting word of the line it is working fine.
case-2:
if i m writing link without https in between some words it is not clickble.
if it is working in case of first line why it is not working in case i write the link in between some words.
How do I recognize text without a space separator

like qweecyan  -> cyan .

What about special symbols？
```
like qwee <cyan>  -> <cyan> .   
```



I am changing the font size of mention as follow:

commentLabel.customize { (label) in
            label.configureLinkAttribute = { (type, attributes, isSelected) in
                var atts = attributes
                switch type {
                case customType:
                    atts[NSAttributedString.Key.font] = UIFont(name: UIFont.robotoMedium, size: 14)!
                    atts[NSAttributedString.Key.foregroundColor] = UIColor.appThemeColor//UIColor.textBlackColor
                default: ()
                }

                return atts
            }
        }

But the size of the label is increased by some margins. Attached image shows the issue.

the problem codes:
```
let detailLabel = ActiveLabel(frame: CGRect(x: 10, y: 200, width: 300, height: 200))
let linkType = ActiveType.custom(pattern: "商品尺寸和包装信息")
detailLabel.enabledTypes.append(linkType)
detailLabel.customize { (label) in
        label.text = "完整商品尺寸 商品尺寸和包装信息"
        label.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 12)
        label.configureLinkAttribute = { (type, attributes, _) in
                var atts = attributes
                if type == linkType {
                    atts[.font] = UIFont.boldSystemFont(ofSize: 16)
                }
                return atts
        }
        label.handleCustomTap(for: linkType, handler: { [weak self] (_) in
                print("tapped")
        })
}
```

The font size of link text is '16', but it would be '12' when tapped.

When the text is in English, it work. Is the problem caused by Chinese characters? How do I solve it?  

Thank you!
I have added a handler that can control the speed of label interaction. If you have time, please check this PR🙏

could you support NSTextAttachment ?
if i wanna to add an image into the label, it can not display

this is very useful when custom emoticons

Let say I have this text

"Lorem pipsum https://www.google.com. pipusum lorementadiyo iblisiya. pipusum lorementadiyo iblisiya. pipusum lorementadiyo iblisiya"

I know when URL is tapped. Now I want to detect when other normal texts are tapped.
I updated the mention and hashtag regular expressions to not capture the prefixing character (` `, `.`, etc).
great project. 🙌  thought it would be a nice feature to support long press detection of a link.

with that ability, clients could provide context menus support. this is a common feature for iOS 13, apps such as twitter instagram have adopted this technique.
