A few months ago, the top right corner of Radiant started saying "Base dir: Home" regardless of what my working directory was set to.  At the same time, I stopped being able to save into any of the folders I had been using before.  I was only able to select files in a folder called "Home" or in my OS (C:) folder.  I worked around this nuisance until today.

Now, I can't run any code even if it's a brand new session with your sample code loaded.  I just get the following "Error: cannot change working directory".  Any idea what the issue is?
In my Rstudio, when I copy-and-paste the command below:
install.packages("radiant", repos = "https://radiant-rstats.github.io/minicran/")
The console's output is:
>install.packages("radiant", repos = "https://radiant-rstats.github.io/minicran/")
Warning in install.packages :
  unable to access index for repository https://radiant-rstats.github.io/minicran/src/contrib:

Warning in install.packages :

What I want to ask is:

1. Is it a problem with my RStudio‘s version?
2. How can I install it correctly？
Hi,
When I click the load button to load a csv from my computer, I see someone else's computer, not my own laptop. Unsure of how to upload a csv file from my own computer. This will be a big issue when we have 400 students using radiant this fall semester... :)
Cheers,

Hi

Great app. Incredibly useful. I have one question. I have a shiny app that I would like to use some of the Radiant functions in. I have a dataset (which is reactive) already in the shiny app and I would like this to be loaded as the default instead of the diamonds dataset. Is there a simple way to do this? I guess I would have to do something like `input$dataset<-RV$data` where RV$data is the default dataset I want. But where would I put this code?

Thanks in advance
Is there a way to create a shortcut that opens RStudio, Radiant, and a State File in one click?
This would prevent confusion and speed up analysis.
Hi,
This is an awesome app!
I am a novice R user and I just started learning shiny. I was wondering if there is an easier to follow radiant app for starters, for instance, an app that's not packaged into a library and has the standard shiny framework ie, ui.R and server.R, etc..
Thank you,
Margaret

 
I tried
```

```
befoe
```
radiant::radiant()
```
,but does not work.
Hi, just a quick question... I'm guessing you left out the `alpha` and `shape` elements out of `visualize` for simplicity... and deal with the multiple `x` variables by faceting... it's pretty elegant all in all. It's true that shape can be quickly abused...

I do think however the alpha is fairly bombproof... and adds a lot of value for medium-large datasets  in terms of allowing point clusters to be more easily visualized if `alpha =0.1` for example. 

Are you interested in having a conversation about the inclusion of both of these? 
Folks, 

I have just created a table to make it easier to study which set of data best fits to variable´s nature. This like is a editable spreadsheet, show and ideias, feel free to change it and comment.
