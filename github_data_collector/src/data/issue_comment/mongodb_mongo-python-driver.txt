I have an app that makes heavy use of pymongo. However once in a while I get a "InvalidBSON('',)" exception. I haven't been able to track the original exception because pymongo discards useful information when wrapping exceptions.
The current code that verifies pymongo query projections does not replicate MongoDB shell's behavior when the projection is an empty dictionary.

```
> db.test.find({}, {})
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5cec99eb81f850232d377fe1"), "value" : 0 }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5cec99ec81f850232d377fe2"), "value" : 1 }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5cec99ec81f850232d377fe3"), "value" : 2 }
```

PyMongo verifies if the projection is not None, but before converting it to a proper dictionary with ` helpers._fields_list_to_dict`, any projection whose boolean value is False gets replaced with `{"id": 1}`. In the case of an empty dictionary, this is annoying, as it prevents creating a projection variable with an empty dictionary and optionally adding values to it.
```python
>>> list(coll.find({}, {}))
[{'_id': ObjectId('5cec99eb81f850232d377fe1')},
 {'_id': ObjectId('5cec99ec81f850232d377fe2')},
 {'_id': ObjectId('5cec99ec81f850232d377fe3')}]
```

Simple problematic use case:
```python
# In the scope of a request
projection = {}
if not args['verbose']:
    projection['out'] = 0
return list(coll.find({}, projection))
```
Not so elegant workaround to bypass this problem:
```python
coll.find({}, projection or None)
```

This is a follow up to #346 that was closed inadvertently. 

It implements what was decided in [this JIRA ticket](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-1439?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel&focusedCommentId=1751108#comment-1751108): add type annotations in stubs according to [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/).

I took the work of @GrierPhillips and tried to answer some of the comments on the previous PR:
 * removed internals and private methods and functions
 * added type annotations for the `bson` package as well, as `pymongo` references it sometimes
 * cleaned up the styling to follow [typeshed's standards](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#conventions)

I did not find a way to automatically test the stubs against real code as this is [ongoing work](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5028) by the `mypy` team. However I copied the `.pyi` files in `typeshed` and ran the tests there that helped me find and fix many issues.

Also I did not update `pymongo` with updates from version after 3.5 (Phillips' work).
