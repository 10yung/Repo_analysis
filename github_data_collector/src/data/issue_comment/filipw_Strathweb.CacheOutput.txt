Can you tell me why there are 4 cache keys for one request.  Is there anyway to make this one key and one cache?

Hi there, could you please release a new version with latest fixes? I need the custom headers feature which i can't find on the nuget release version

Thanks!


Is there a way to use below methods to invalidate cache with certain query strings and not all the caches for that controller?

```
[InvalidateCacheOutput("Get", typeof(OtherController))] //this will invalidate Get in a different controller
[InvalidateCacheOutput("Get")] 
```
Was not immediately obvious what units ServerTimeSpan was in until I investigated more. Now it can be more clear for others.
In my response, I add a custom header e.g. "X-Count".

When the API returns the cached version of the action (GET), the response message does not contain my custom header(s) anymore.

Am I missing something?

I am using Strathweb.CacheOutput v0.5.0 in my .NET 4.0 WEB API project
The goal of this pull request is to add support for the Slide Cache feature:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.httpcachepolicy.setslidingexpiration?view=netframework-4.8

This will allow to refresh cache timeout if an endpoint is hit before cache expiration.
`Identity.Name.ToLower()` isn't guaranteed to be unique, whereas their ID should be üôè 
Update System.Web.Http to 5.2.7
The old one has expired üôà
