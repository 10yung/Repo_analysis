<h2>EF Core 3.1.0</h2>
<p>The primary goal of EF Core 3.1 is to polish the features and scenarios we delivered in EF Core 3.0. EF Core 3.1 will be a long term support (LTS) release, supported for at least 3 years. To this end we have <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/milestone/76?closed=1">fixed over 150 issues</a> for the 3.1 release, but there are no major new features to announce.</p>
<p>EF Core 3.1 reintroduces support for .NET Standard 2.0, rather than requiring .NET Standard 2.1 as was the case for EF Core 3.0. This means EF Core 3.1 will run on .NET Framework versions that support the standard.</p>

<summary>Changelog</summary>

*Sourced from [MailKit's changelog](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.md).*

> ### MailKit 2.4.1 (2019-11-10)
> 
> * Don't use PublicSign on non-Windows NT machines when building.
> * Work-around broken BODYSTRUCTUREs with `()` as a message/rfc822 body token.
>   (issue [#944](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/944))
> * Added work-around for an Exchange bug that forgets to quote folder names containing tabs.
>   (issue [#945](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/945))
> * Moved the SmtpDataFilter into the public API and updated the FAQ to show how to
>   use it when writing messages into an IIS "pickup directory".
>   (issue #[948](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/948))
> 
> ### MailKit 2.4.0 (2019-11-02)
> 
> * Added work-around for IMAP ENVELOPE responses that do not include an In-Reply-To token.
>   (issue [#932](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/932))
> * Dropped support for WindowsPhone/Universal v8.1.
> * Added a net48 assembly to the NuGet package which supports TLS v1.3.
> * Added work-around for Yandex IMAP servers to disconnect immediately upon `* BYE`.
>   (issue [#938](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/938))
> * Fixed ImapClient.Idle() and IdleAsync().
>   (issue [#942](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/942))
> * Added work-around for Lotus Domino where it adds extra ()'s around some FETCH items.
>   (issue [#943](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/943))
> 
> ### MailKit 2.3.2 (2019-10-12)
> 
> * Fixed trimming delimeters from the end of IMAP folder names.
> * Fixed fetching of IMAP PreviewText when message bodies do not contain any text parts.
> * Fixed Pop3Client to never emit Authenticated events w/ null messages.
> * Dropped SslProtocols.Tls (aka TLSv1.0) from the default SslProtocols used by IMAP, POP3
>   and SMTP clients. To override this behavior, use the client.SslProtocols property
>   to set the preferred SslProtocol(s).
> * Fixed ImapFolder.Search(string query) to properly encode the query string when the query
>   contains unicode characters.
> * If an IMAP SEARCH fails due to BADCHARSET, retry the search query after flattening the
>   query strings into US-ASCII. This *may* fix issues such as
>   issue [#808](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/808).

> ### MailKit 2.3.1 (2019-09-08)

>   messages when sending via the DATA command.
>   (issue [#895](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/895))
> * Added assemblies for net46 and net47 to the NuGet package.
