Another PHP 7 upgrade wish! :sparkles: 
What:
Standardizes the README file providing a common language and an implementation link.

Why:
There are differences between PSR's READMEs in regarding language and the lacking of implementations references. So I've updated all READMEs using the https://github.com/php-fig/http-factory as base.
Extends CacheException with \Throwable interface.
With PHP 5 backward compatibility.

A do an error on pull request : https://github.com/php-fig/simple-cache/pull/12 ; sorry ;)
Hello,

Just like in [Psr/Log](https://github.com/php-fig/log), this pull request adds a CacheAwareInterface and a simple CacheAwareTrait.

Per [this thread](https://github.com/php-fig/simple-cache/commit/c671bf12e2e3d06e8af28421177b15b9f29d55e0), I understand that tool support is not a concern or priority for the FIG, so I don't expect this PR will be merged - a replacement package with corrected type-hints has been published and can be installed as `mindplay/simple-cache` now.
