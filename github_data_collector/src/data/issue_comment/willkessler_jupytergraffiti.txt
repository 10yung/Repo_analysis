Hi,

Fantastic work! This extension really helps a lot when teaching code.
I wonder is there a way to export recorded video as raw html and javascript (without Jupyter's python kernel)

Thanks
Any chance to make this pip (and/or conda)-installable?

Using the docker image installation method works fine. But, when I try to do using the 3rd method of installation (in order to avoid docker), I get the above error on running ```jupyter nbextension enable graffiti_extension/main --user```. The previous steps of the installation went perfectly without any errors.

The error reads as follows :
```
Enabling notebook extension graffiti_extension/main...
      - Validating: problems found:
        - require?  X graffiti_extension/main
```

I do not know how to fix this, as I am a complete beginner. I would really appreciate any help if possible.
If you add a cell during a recording after the last cell, then on playback it will not insert the new cell after the last cell, but instead _before_ the last cell.
