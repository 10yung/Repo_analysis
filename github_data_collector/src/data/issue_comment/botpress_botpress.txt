- Added a back to main flow button when a node is selected, it took me a while to realize that clicking on the background of the Diagram did the same thing so I thought having a visual button would be clearer

- Change the background of the FlowTools when they're being dragged to have a little more feedback to the user

**Description**
Fixed a few issues with the bot config's UX

**Changes**
- Added Cancel button that redirects to the bots list (has confirmation if form was modified)
- Redirects to bots list after save
- Added StickyActionBar component
  - Allows to have the buttons at the bottom of the form but still visible at all time
  - Is reusable
  - Could possibly be moved to a more general place
- Added AlertBanner component
  - Is visible even if you're scrolled down in the form
  - Is reusable
  - Could possibly be moved to a more general place
- Added alphabetical sorting on the languages list
- Buttons are disabled while saving so users can't spam click buttons
- Fixed console error `A component is changing a controlled input of type text to be uncontrolled` by adding a fallback on the input values

**Describe the bug**
The list of nodes in "Redirect to Flow" is always empty.

It was discovered in [Forum](https://help.botpress.io/t/how-to-transition-after-qna-message-is-received/1362/3?u=asashour)

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. In "Main" flow create few nodes
2. Go to "Q&A", create new Q&A
3. Select "Redirect to Flow"
4. Select "Main" flow
  a. Expected behavior: the "Node" list contains all nodes in the "Main" flow
  b. Actual behavior: the "Node" list is always empty.

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Windows 10
 - Browser Chrome
 - Version 12.4.0
 - NodeJS 10.11.0

Removed the additional table and updated the ui to use data from the events table. Cleanup will be necessary, in another PR

**Describe the bug**
The analytics module generates a combined report for all the bots in a workspace instead of giving per-bot metrics. This behavior is not in conjunction with other modules wherein bot-specific data/parameters can be interacted with in Botpress studio. 

**To Reproduce**
1. Create 2 bots: A and B
2. Interact a lot with bot A and not at all with bot B
3. Go to Botpress studio (i.e. admin console) and select bot A; then look at the analytics screen.
4. Then select bot B and check the analytics screen.

**Expected behavior**
The metrics for both the bots are the same, even though bot B clearly was not interacted with. 

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: MacOS 10.15.2
 - Browser: Chrome
 - Version 12.3.1
 - NodeJS 13.5.0


**To Reproduce**
1. Open "Code Editor"
2. Click on a file from "Actions" section
3. Click on a file from "Hooks" section
4. Click on a file from "Configurations" section
5. Click on a file from "Module Configurations" section
  a. Expected behavior:  the menu selection (in blue) should match opened tabs (whether single or multiple)
  b. Actual behavior: menu shows many selections (in blue), although only one tab is opened

**Describe the bug**
1. `botpress.config.json` doesn't match the associated schema.
2. All files in "Module configuration" cannot find their schemas.

  a. Expected behavior: no errors are shown.
  b. Actual behavior: there are two errors of missing properties.

  a. Expected behavior: no errors are shown.
  b. Actual behavior: there are errors of not finding schema.

1. Missing property "converse"
