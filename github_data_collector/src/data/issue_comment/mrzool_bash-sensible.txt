"%F %T" looks like a decent timestamp format to me, but it's not an ISO8601 timestamp, that would be "%FT%T". Suggest you remove the reference to the standard there.
in extent to the vi mode users I propose to add this readline binding
in fact it's annoying to press escape each time before ^L to clear the terminal
Just wondering why HISTIGNORE is exported while none of the other variables are.

My inclination is to say HISTIGNORE should not be exported since it seems bash specific and subprocesses won't use it.
Just feedback: it would be great to have an option to log cmd history to syslog.

Some options:

https://sysadmin.compxtreme.ro/how-to-log-bash-history-with-syslog/
https://www.thegeekdiary.com/how-to-log-all-bash-history-commands-to-syslog-var-log-messages-in-centos-rhel/

Feel free to close this, just wanted to give some feedback.
CDPATH="." has no effect besides making cd print out the directory being changed to.

With only one entry in CDPATH, this serves no purpose and is completely extraneous.
When I  scp to a host that I've added the sensible.bash to my ~/.bashrc, I see bind warnings.

`/home/matt/bin/sensible.bash: line 28: bind: warning: line editing not enabled`

I placed the binds in a TTY detection block like explained here: https://superuser.com/questions/892658/remote-ssh-commands-bash-bind-warning-line-editing-not-enabled

```
if [ -t 1 ]
then
  # standard output is a tty
  # do interactive initialization

  # Enable history expansion with space
  # E.g. typing !!<space> will replace the !! with your last command
  bind Space:magic-space
  ...
fi
```

Works well for this.
I love the idea of this project and appreciate the great defaults it gives me. Thank you.

To make the project even better I propose to split the defaults into "bash-sensible and "inputrc-sensible" for two reasons:
 1) Avoid shadowing preferences set in `~/.inputrc` (e.g. I have `set show-all-if-ambiguous off` in my `.inputrc` which is overwritten by bash-sensible. Thus, I need to set it a second time in `.bashrc` after loading bash-sensible.)
 2) Make these great defaults also available to other programs that use readline (python REPL, etc).
As described here: https://github.com/wting/autojump#known-issues

What about disabling scroll lock (XOFF), to avoid people puzzling why the screen is frozen, having to find out about Ctrl-S and scroll lock and hitting Ctrl-Q to "unfreeze"?

I've been using this for years in my bashrc, but I don't know how portable it is:

```
# disable terminal locking
bind -r '\C-s'
stty -ixon
```
