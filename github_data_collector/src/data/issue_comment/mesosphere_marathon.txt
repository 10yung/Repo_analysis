Before this patch, during a deployment, a leader election would lead
marathon to not respect minimumHealthCapacity parameter.
Reason is that TaskReplaceActor used to ignore instance healthyness when
considering instance that could be killed "immediately" upon actor
start.

We now respect minimumHealthCapacity by taking into account healthy
instances.

This patch required to add an property "this app has configured
healthchecks" to be able to distinguish following cases:
- app has HC but we don't have signal yet for given instance
- app has HC and we have signal of healthyness for given instance
- app has no HC

It also brings ability to fix TODO at
https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/blob/master/src/main/scala/mesosphere/marathon/core/instance/Instance.scala#L267
in a future patch since we now know difference between no HC and no
information about HC.

Backport of e05e9763 / #7109

In this change, we modify the expunge-after logic to evaluate in the same event cycle as the unreachable-inactive logic, allowing expungeAfterSeconds: 0 to expunge an instance immediately when it becomes unreachable.

This improves the evaluation of group-by and unique constraints.

Summary:
This is just a proof of concept how USI in Marathon could look like.
Pending for completion:

- [x] - legacySharedResources flag for pods; with migration

- [ ] - validate that limits > request resources (when specified)
we use mesos and marathon to development app. it works cool as usual.
but when my java app start with an agent and i develop it in the same host, it will stuck.
it can fixed by set the config-value 'minimumHealthCapacity' to '0'. it means killed old instance.
but can you tell me why the new app will stuck. the log tell me, the jvm have be started, but quit  immediately(maybe port conflict？)，then it only do the method ‘premain’ of java agent, not do the main.

This would allow us to use an expungeStrategy in Metronome that just expunges finished/failed instances regardless of the current goal
