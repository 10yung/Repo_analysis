Hi， @ybsong00 . I am interested in the CREST and tested it in OTB and VOT. I found that the performance drops when the scale of the target change rapidly compared to other trackers. Maybe the search ratio [1, 0.95, 1.05] is not a good solution. Do you have some advices to solve this problem? Thanks!
i find the code can not run in OTB100，because the size of the object is different，but in code，it designed resize the scales of 5 times bigger than target. can you give me a copy of test codes which can test on the OTB or VOT，thanks, 
The idea is apprently borrowed from the other one convolutional layer-based tracker CRT, but not cited.
And I can not really understand how the temporal residual learning in the proposed framework can be helpful for tracking. It is unreasonable! 

Cant believe this is ICCV 2017 spotlight.
 using vl_argparse error when OTB test:
Expected either a param-value pair or a structure
 @ybsong00  @dynamicsong   Can the residual layer really capture the appearance changes ? I think it only contributes to the training of base layer. 
`Error using  * 
Inner matrix dimensions must agree.

Error in CREST_tracking (line 96)
feat_=feat_*coeff;

Error in Demo (line 32)
result=CREST_tracking(opts,varargin,config,display);

Error in run (line 86)
evalin('caller', [script ';']);`

Hello, here is the problem, feat_: 1369 x 512 single, and coeff: 1369 x 64 double, can you help me solve it?
@ybsong00 I noticed that the CREST only use 22 layers of VGG. By using all the convolution layers, will the accuracy increase? And the learning rate of the residual network is too slow. Does it mean that the parameter of the network need not to be changed substantially. Therefore, can the network be trained offline with large tracking benchmark, thus making the CREST faster without much online training?
@ybsong00 I am interested in your great job! Can you provide vot trax code so that I can test CREST in VOT2016 and VOT2017?
Dear author,

i have installed matconvnet successfully. When running Demo.m, i got some errors. Just showed below:
Error using vl_argparse (line 91)
Expected either a param-value pair or a structure.

Error in cnn_train_dag (line 26)
[opts, varargin] = vl_argparse(opts, varargin);

Error in CREST_tracking (line 117)
info = cnn_train_dag(net_online, imdb, input,getBatchWrapper(opts), ...

Error in Demo (line 32)
result=CREST_tracking(opts,varargin,config,display);

I think that there is something wrong with your input variable values in the function "cnn_train_dag", or "getBatchWrapper", but i can't find the solution about that error. Has anyone else had the same problem when running Demo.m?

Thank you for your time, i am looking forward to your reply.
