Hi!

Thanks you very much for this valuable contribution.
I have just created a version of this solution in Swift, you can take a look in [this repository](https://github.com/angeldev/iOSDev/tree/master/buttonOnTabBar).

Thanks!

Unable to run app.

as title,thank you !

Hi Peter!
Thanks a lot for this excellent TabBar. I use it in my app [Toeppersee](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/toeppersee/id793480458?mt=8&uo=4).
But would you care to add @3x images for iPhone 6 Plus?
Regards,

i'm trying this using xcode 5 with sotryboard.. any idea why this is happening?

I would like to use the VerticalSwipeArticle with a UITableViewController but for some reason it does not work. None of the delegates methods get called. I duplicated from the Sample Project.

Does the VerticalSwipeArticle require a UIViewControler as a base or am I doing something wrong?

Any help is appreciated.
Thank you.

@property (nonatomic, retain) NSMutableArray\* buttons;
...
self.buttons = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:segmentCount];
...
[buttons release];

WTF?

Your CustomSegmentedControl and CustomSegmentedControlsViewController are closely connected. So it takes a lot of time to recreate the first one as a separate control.
Why did you transfer a half of parameters from the first class to the second one? Such as offset, CapLocation.
Some extra parameters: TAG_VALUE
Why do you declare buttons as array of dictionaries of arrays and even make it static?
And finally WHY do you customise the buttons of your custom segmented control completely outside it? Ponder "custom segmenter control" meaning.

I'm have problem implementing it to my project with storyboard. Any tips? 

Otherwise great example!
