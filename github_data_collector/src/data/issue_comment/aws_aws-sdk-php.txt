### Version of AWS SDK for PHP?
3.133.1

### Version of PHP (`php -v`)?
7.4

### What issue did you see?
I can't post a message to a websocket apigateway using the postToConnection method, I always get 403 error.

### Steps to reproduce
```
$config = [
    'region' => $_ENV['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'],
    'version' => 'latest',
    'endpoint' => 'https://------.execute-api.-----.amazonaws.com/dev',
];

$connectionId = $request->header('x-connection-id');
$apiClient = new ApiGatewayManagementApiClient($config);
$apiClient->postToConnection([
     'ConnectionId' => $connectionId,
     'Data' => json_encode(['status' => 'ok']),
]);
```

### Additional context
This is the error output.
```
Error executing "PostToConnection" on "https://------.execute-api.------.amazonaws.com/@connections/CONNECTION_ID";
AWS HTTP error: Client error: `POST https://------.execute-api.----.amazonaws.com/@connections/CONNECTION_ID` resulted in a `403 Forbidden` response:
{"message":"Forbidden"}....
```

What I'm seeing there is that the method is using the endpoint url without the stage part,
`POST https://------.execute-api.----.amazonaws.com/@connections/CONNECTION_ID` I tried the same request with awscli and it works properly.

Error executing "PutParameter" on "https://ssm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"; AWS HTTP error: Client error: `POST https://ssm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` resulted in a `400 Bad Request` response:

Exception thrown is even when "ssm" isn't included in the parameter name. The first time this happened, I was using "smpt/support", however, I get failures using similar parameter names as well. Other failed parameter names:

### What issue did you see?

AWS SDK for PHP tries to read `~/.aws/config` dozens of times when using the S3 client. It's not necessary as the file does not exist and we provided all S3-related config keys to the client in the constructor.

### Steps to reproduce
If you have a runnable example, please include it as a snippet or link to a repository/gist for larger code examples.

This is how the `$args` passed to `Aws\S3\S3Client` look like:

```neon
				http_handler: @amazonHttpClient # our Guzzle client
				region: eu-west-1
				version: latest
				credentials: [
					key: xxx
					secret: yyy
				]
```

I also learned that some of the read attempts go down when I additionally pass `s3_us_east_1_regional_endpoint: legacy` in there (even when we use a different region).

### Additional context
Any additional information relevant to the issue. Examples include any framework you may be using (e.g. Laravel, Wordpress) in conjunction with the AWS SDK for PHP, or PHP/environment config settings if the issue is related to memory or performance.

This is causing us performance issues.

HHVM 3.18 LTS can run both composer and PHPUnit, so it should be used to test against.
Using GuzzleHttp and aws-sdk from master we get this error:
```
"Undefined class constant 'VERSION' at vendor/aws/aws-sdk-php/src/functions.php:265)"
```
cause they removed the deprecated VERSION constant.

    if ($version[0] === '5') {
        return new \Aws\Handler\GuzzleV5\GuzzleHandler();

        return new \Aws\Handler\GuzzleV6\GuzzleHandler();
    } else {
        throw new \RuntimeException('Unknown Guzzle version: ' . $version);
    }
}
```

### Additional context
as in copied function it could be necessary create a new v7 GuzzleHandler


### Version of AWS SDK for PHP?
3.128.1

### Version of PHP (`php -v`)?
7.2.3

### What issue did you see?
The issue is with exported image files from Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows).
With the SDK, when trying to use getimagesize on a jpg image with custom stream wrapper (`getimagesize( "s3://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucket-name/imagePhotoshopDuplicate.jpg" )`) the function will return an error, but when using a standard stream wrapper (`getimagesize( "https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucket-name/imagePhotoshopDuplicate.jpg" )`) the function will work as expected.

This issue is caused because Photoshop is adding some metadata headers to the original file upon export/save.

I don't know why exactly this is happening, but clearly the `StreamWrapper` is failing in handling these special headers. This looks like a bug with Photoshop but I think the `StreamWrapper` needs to know how to handle it.

### Steps to reproduce
1. Get an uncorrupted image from any source, duplicate it, import the duplicate to Photoshop CC 2017 Windows (maybe other versions will work too) and export/save it as a jpeg file.
2. Upload the photoshop duplicate and the original image to an S3 bucket.
3. Using the SDK, create an S3 client and register a custom Stream Wrapper (`s3` will suffice).
4. try to run `getimagesize` on both of the images with and without the custom stream wrapper. You can use the following code as an example:
```
var_dump(getimagesize( "https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucket-name/imageOriginal.jpg" ));
var_dump(getimagesize( "s3://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucket-name/imageOriginal.jpg" ));
var_dump(getimagesize( "https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucket-name/imagePhotoshopDuplicate.jpg" ));
var_dump(getimagesize( "s3://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucket-name/imagePhotoshopDuplicate.jpg" ));
```
5. The `getimagesize` function will fail on the photoshop duplicate image when using the custom stream wrapper (showing an error about corrupted bytes), but the https will read it perfectly.
6 (optional). Use a tool like ExifTool to compare the headers and metadata of the original image and the one exported by Photoshop.
Run `exiftool -all= imagePhotoshopDuplicate.jpg` to remove all the headers from the Photoshop exported image, and then re-upload it to S3 and run the same tests again (as in step 4).
You should now get a perfect result on all 4 tests.

### Additional context
I found a closed issue from 2017 ( #1261 ) with exactly the same problem. The image that was uploaded to that issue was indeed an image with Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows) headers, it can be used for a test if there's no Photoshop CC 2017 software available.

I hope that now with enough evidence this issue can be solved.

Why is the method response to get credentials so slow?
This issue does not occur in older versions(3.118.0)
Maybe there are other ways to get credentials?
