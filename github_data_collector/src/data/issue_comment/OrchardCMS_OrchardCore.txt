Minor markup fixes that fix some stray backticks and code not formatted as code,
Add standard display option on fields where it is missing.

Fixes #5219
Would be nice to have a SearchShape.
I'm creating this issue for keeping track of the feature.
It works only for content that have an autoroute but does not work when using the default content url.
We need to update the AutorouteIndex length tests in the handler to prevent exceptions when cloning and generating new id's as per what was done in https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/5195

(no change to the actual length, just truncation before it gets inserted into the index.

Also to fix: the ContentItemIndex `Substring` methods are using the incorrect overload and do not truncate to the correct maximum length.
Should use `.DisplayText = contentItem.DisplayText.Substring(0, maxlength)` not `.DisplayText = contentItem.DisplayText.Substring(maxlength)`
When you edit a menu, open the preview window and order the menu items, the menu is not updated on the preview.
I have a workflow with a query with one parameter.  I have tried using a Set Property and a Script Task with the same results.

When I hard code the value, the query executes as expected:
(Within a Set Property - works)
```
executeQuery("GetSubProjects",{"ParentProjectId":"21923"}); 
```
(Within a Script Task - works)
```
var parentId = input("ContentItem").Content.ProjectPartPart.ProjectPartInstanceId;
var  param = {"ParentProjectId":"21923"};
var result = executeQuery("GetSubProjects",param);
setOutcome('Done');
setProperty("subProjects", result);
```

When I try to use a workflow property, from SQL Profiler I can see that a null value is passed:

(Within a Script Task - does not work)
```

var parentId = input("ContentItem").Content.ProjectPartPart.ProjectPartInstanceId;
var  param = {"ParentProjectId":parentId};
var result = executeQuery("GetSubProjects",param);
setOutcome('Done');
setProperty("subProjects", result);
setProperty("jsTest", parentId);
```
I confirmed that the parentId variable is populated by writing the jsTest value to a log in a later task.


Hi all, 

I have see that from a couple of months TitlePart is not required when you insert or edit a new content item. Can I add a checkbox in the TitlePart settings to allow this field to be required if it is editable?

If you allow me, I can do a PR with this modify and the code to fix this issue https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/issues/5036
