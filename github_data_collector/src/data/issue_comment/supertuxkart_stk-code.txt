Fixes #3877 
Partly fixes #3897
The best while slower needs test

Hello, 
  This change add a 3D wireframe radar inspired by modern karting games (showing other karts position relative to the camera) with a simplistic design :
  - In all modes, it shows seemlessly the speed by showing the point reached in 3 ticks.
  - In ctf mode, it broadly indicate were to go (were is the flag or the base if you already have the flag). 
  - In soccer mode, it shows where is the ball and how it move and the karts that are around the ball (with gradients to represents the distance).
       1. (KART) the **white arrow** (pyramid) shows approximately with distance **where is the ball**;
       2. (KART) around the white arrow there is a square to show with **color** (if red you touch the ball, if blue you miss it, if green it is a perfect alignement) **alignment between kart and ball** (basically saying if you can shoot);
       3. (KART) the **black arrow** (inside white one) shows **where move ball**;
       4. (KART) the **black square** (outside white one) represents **the future shock** - if you want to control the ball you need to keep it small;
       5. (BALL) a green vector shows the trajectory of the ball
       6. (BALL) work with ii. : if the ball is reachable (red or green), a square with same color is drawn on the ball

  The feature still experimental.
  To use it, edit user config.xml file :
```xml
    <!-- Enable radar (show target in ctf and soccer modes) -->
    <show_radar value="true" />
```

I am not able to get AI players to appear in my LAN games in 1.1.0-rc1.

(Multi-player STK was one of the highlights of family xmas! thankyou!!)

Through the 'local networking' 'create a server' GUI, when I set the "number of AI karts" to some number like 3, no AI players appear in my 'normal race'.  (Human LAN players are able to join as expected).

RC1 change log indicates there is some new AI multiplayer functions but it is unclear how to activate this.

I note that this issue appears related to issue #4147.

I experimented with setting the `ai-handling value="true"` value in my server-config.xml but this did not change the result.

I note that it is unclear in the NETWORKING.md which (if any) server functions require a separate '--network-console' program instance or if setup through the multiplayer LAN game GUI gives the same results.

## Steps to reproduce
Through the GUI, 'local networking' -> 'create a server' GUI, set the "number of AI karts" to some number like 3.

## Configuration

STK release version:  windows x64 1.1-rc1

<!-- Please specify where you downloaded STK -->
STK Source: official binary

System: windows 10 1909
Graphics card: old radeon
CPU: 4 core athlon

## Configuration
Huawei p20 lite
Android 9.0

STK release version: 1.1
I've always found "Global networking" kind of confusing, which made me take several seconds to actually decide on an option when I want to play online. "Enter server address" has also been renamed to "Direct Connect" for concision.

This also tweaks menu option casing to match the rest of the menus.

**Don't merge yet** as this currently lacks translation changes. Should I update the source strings in all translatrions or just in the POT file? Is there a tool to do so, or does it have to be done manually?

Speaking of which, I also noticed casing inconsistencies in track names. We should probably settle on a single style (either `Like This` or `Like this`). My vote goes for the former, as the rest of the UI seems to follow that style.
