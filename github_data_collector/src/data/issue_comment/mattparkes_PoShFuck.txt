I tried #15 as well which didn't seem to resolve it.  Will try to dig in further when I get a chance.
There was a bug in my changes to support the fucked up parameter changes.

Excuse me if this is a wrong place to ask such a stupid question, but the repository itself doesn't seem to contain one and googling the file name didn't return any result except this repo, plus the original [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) uses .py files as rules. I was hoping to find some ready-made StaticDict.xml, or an example, or some documentation about how to write one from scratch. Thanks in advance.
