At first I try to install the Enterprised DB version. But then I found I did it wrongly. So I uninstalled the old one and try to install the postgresapp. Then I faced a problem, it keeps remind me the port 5432 has been used. I checked the methods you guys told on the internet and tried but it did not work. So I found the files related the postgres and try to restart the whole installation. Then it show me this problem. I am really confused about this problem and can not figure it out. Wanna help, thank you.
Hi guys,
Im working with postgres.app on my Mac and when I try a connection by PDO or pg_connect I always got the same error: 
"Connection refused Is the server running on host "localhost" (127.0.0.1) and accepting TCP/IP connections on port 5432"
I tried everything........ pls some help ;(
It would be awesome if something like this were possible: `brew cask install postgressapp`

I understand you don't want to create a whole CLI interface, but this one command would be very useful so we can automate our machine installs. Thank you!

When creating the database this error appears:

"Can't load plugin: %s:%s" % (self.group, name)
sqlalchemy.exc.NoSuchModuleError: Can't load plugin: sqlalchemy.dialects:postgresql

Any idea?
Im using the latest version of postgresApp on my mac, and I already installed flask-sqlalchemy and psycopg2...
'Check for updates' is greyed out in the menu, and there's a newer version available (v2.3.3, with PG 12.1). Any reason I can't do this?
I have installed PostgresApp and when i open postgres database from UI, it says "Terminal" not found. Please select a different database client in the preferences.

I have UnInstalled and Installed several times. 

Can anyone help me out to resolve the Issue?

Thank you in advance!

Because of multiple reports of crashes and connection failures in PostgreSQL 12 related to Kerberos (#537 and #538), we've decided to build PostgreSQL 12 without support for GSSAPI / Kerberos for now. The next update will no longer have Kerberos.

If you need Kerberos authentication, you can do two things:
- use an older version of PostgreSQL (11 is still built with support for Kerberos authentication)
- please let us know that you are affected by this by commenting on this issue (please also let us know why you need Kerberos)

If this affects many people, we have to think about a different solution. If it turns out that only very few people use Kerberos, it's probably better not to include it, since it causes problems even when you don't want to use it.

If anybody has an idea how to fix the Kerberos issues without removing it altogether, I'm also interested.
I am reporting here instead of on https://www.postgresql-archive.org/PostgreSQL-bugs-f2117394.html
Since I did a successful parallel restore on ubuntu with pg_restore from 12 on psql server 12
which means this issue could be a build issue

I have tried https://github.com/PostgresApp/PostgresApp/releases/tag/v2.3.1 too, same result

### Env
- PostgreSQL Server & `psql`:
  https://github.com/PostgresApp/PostgresApp/releases/tag/v2.3.2
  `Postgres-2.3.2-10-11-12.dmg`
- OSX 10.14.6

### Failed case
```bash
/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/12/bin/pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U pikachuexe -d spacious_production_temp --jobs=8 /path/to/backup.dump
``` 

#### Log
```

```
or
```

Hi,

when I try to connect to an external PostgreSQL 12 server using the psql (version 12) that comes with the current Postgresapp (Version 2.3.2), I get the following error:

`psql: error: could not connect to server: FATAL:  unsupported frontend protocol 1234.5679: server supports 2.0 to 3.0`

Seems as if something went wrong during your building process.

Best regards,

James
