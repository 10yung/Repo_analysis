Hello, shortcut keys cmd+shift+t conflict, how to replace shortcut keys?
Xcode 8.0 support Source Editor Extension Tools, We hope XToDo can be used in Xcode 8.0. 
It's very useful for us. Thanks.

如题，文本框灰色，弹出窗口关掉之后文本框文字也没有改变，实际也没有效果。

When I pressed the shortcut to type "// TODO:", I want to add extra information like "author" after "// TODO:", because it easy to locate my personal code blocks. THX!

Right now it is sitting in my '~/Documents' and I wish to move it somewhere else. How can I do it?

This is the folder I am talking about :

It would be great if the list of TODOs included subgroups based around filenames. 
Example: 
TODO:
--File1.cpp
----TODO: Fix this thing here:
----TODO: Fix this other thing here that needs fixing
--File2.cpp
----TODO: This also needs fixing
----TODO: we should probably fix this, but maybe after the initial release

instead of just a massive list that doesn't sort them by filename.

Downloaded the source code on both my imac running OS X 10.9.5 and my macbook pro running OS X 10.11.1.   I compiled the project for both systems and restarted XCode and loaded up a project with some TODO comments in it.  The plugin appears in the menus and everything seems to work ok, yet no actual listing of TODO points occurs in plugin window.   

However, if I run the stand-alone app, set the source directory to that same project and add the TODO keywords, the App window lists the TODOs for the source directory correctly. 

I'm not even sure where to begin finding out why this is happening. 

I'd love to be able to search for things of the format `https://company.atlassian.net/browse/PRJ-123` so I can easily find things I've linked with my bug tracker. 

However, I tried adding `https://company.atlassian.net/browse/PRJ-` as my prefix, and it doesn't work unless I get all the way down to `https`, which also gets a bunch of other URLs I have in the code. 

I'm guessing it's probably an issue with how the characters are separated, but I haven't had time to dive into the code. Any chance you might be able to add this? 

How to make the to do list order by time or name ?

First: congrats, your plugin is a TO HAVE plugin. Definitely.

Please consider that:

// TODO adjust margins0
and
/\* TODO adjust margins1 */

Will be displayed in this way:
- adjust margins0  
  and  
- adjust margins1 */  

You have to truncate "todo" description if ends with "*/".
