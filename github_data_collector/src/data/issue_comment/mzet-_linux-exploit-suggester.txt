Add switches for distro name, distro version and arch to use along with --kernel switch
Since this commit b6b5bfc78e080ad40764c1c4727e1e6083d4810b with the refactored code there is no difference using -g/--short with --checksec
This patch re-add some of the functionality
When `/tmp` is not writable but `/www/tmp` is. I downloaded `linux-exploit-suggester` to `/www/tmp` and ran it:

However I ran https://github.com/jondonas/linux-exploit-suggester-2 and https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum without problem.
```
$ ./les.sh
Script needs Bash in version 4.0 or newer. Aborting.
```

It says LES supports only bash 4.0+ and I was running it on bash 3.1 so I understand.

But on #3 you said

> To avoid these kind of errors I've added bash version checking on script's startup. 4.0 is needed for associative arrays, =~ operator was added in 3.* so we should be good now.

So finally 3.* is not supported?
I suppose that the line 1790 should look like this:
`pkgVersion=$(echo "$pkg" | grep -E -i -o -e '-[\.0-9\+:p]+[-\+]*' | cut -d':' -f2 | sed 's/[\+-]//g' | sed 's/p[0-9]//g')`
or
`pkgVersion=$(echo "$pkg" | grep -E -i -o -e '-[\.0-9\+:p]+' | cut -d':' -f2 | sed 's/[\+-]//g' | sed 's/p[0-9]//g')`

Since the "ntfs-3g-1:2016.2.22AR.1-3" package is not detected otherwise.

However, the package “mysql-server-5.6.30-1” is still not detected.  But if we replace "Reqs: pkg=mysql-server|mariadb-server,ver<5.5.52" with "Reqs: pkg=mysql-server|mariadb-server"
I have come across a similar shell script that’s also designed to find exploits although, it uses an online database to find exploits.

It may be worth copying some of the code from it so linux-exploit-suggester can also use the online database.
