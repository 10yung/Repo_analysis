这个项目swift版本有点儿老了，希望作者能升级一下swift版本，

哪位大牛哥有做过兼容处理的版本 分享一下链接 也好啊 谢谢

自己处理这些兼容语法  对于一个新手 着实头大了
Hello guys!

I found that in SkillSelectionCell, content view background's alpha is set to 0.2.  Also in RankView you are drawing a rectangle with barbackgroundcolor's alpha set to 0.15 in a for loop. I think it would be better not to use transparent or partially transparent views in repeating styles, like TableViewCells and inside for loops.

Due to my own experience and this [Apple document](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/2DDrawing/Conceptual/DrawingPrintingiOS/DrawingTips/DrawingTips.html) using transparency could be tricky, performance-wise.

Don't you think there would be a way to avoid this?
pulllToRefreshViewDidRefresh -> pullToRefreshViewDidRefresh
It's OK.Thanks for your advice.
If user type in a false verify code, Yep will show a false alert. But
after tapped “OK” button, user can continue to entry digits. Now, after
implement this method, user cannot entry more than 4 digits which is
configured in “YepConfig.verifyCodeLength()”.
