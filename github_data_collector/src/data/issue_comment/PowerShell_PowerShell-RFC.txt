Publishing an updated version of the PowerShellGet 3.0 RFC based on #185 

We are currently targeting a preview of module (not feature complete) for end of year 2019. 
An updated version of the RFC originally proposed by @SteveL-MSFT RFC to securely and simply manage secrets with PowerShell. 
<!--

All new RFCs must:

* have examples of the proposed behavior, preferably in the form of a script (or scripts) which shows the proposed behavior with comments and annotations

All new RFCs should:

* Not have a number - maintainers will assign the number
* Be placed in the Draft folder

Maintainers will sometimes need to make small edits (for example, set the RFC number).
To make this easier, we suggest giving maintainers permission to push to your fork,
see https://github.com/blog/2247-improving-collaboration-with-forks.

Also be sure to read https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/master/RFC0000-RFC-Process.md

The concept has been discussed in issue https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3240

This RFC was originally proposed as part of a collection of RFCs in PR #187. I am separating those RFCs into separate PRs to better adhere to the RFC process.
