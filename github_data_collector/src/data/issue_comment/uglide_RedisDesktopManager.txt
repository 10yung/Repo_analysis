I have 2 practically similar servers I use, one is hosted directly by Azure, another is hosted on Azure but managed by ScaleGrid.
Those are standalone servers, not clusters.
Whenever I use RDM to view/edit data on Scale grid managed server, I almost every operation need to reconnect to the server because the RDM loses connection.

**Describe the bug**
The scroll bar on list of keys in the left panel is unusable on a high DPI display (I have a high DPI display - not sure if this makes a difference as that is all I have access to).
The keys list also does not have any keyboard shortcuts (page up, down, ctrl + home etc), so navigating the list via mouse wheel is very tedious and impractical for large lists

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open RDM
2. Expand a server that has > 100 keys
3. Try to use the scroll bar to scroll down - either via the down chevron or within the scroll bar itself to 'page' down
4. Observe that the scroll bar does not work and the mouse cursor changes to a column-resize cursor

**Expected behavior**
The cursor should stay as per normal when using the scrollbar

**When copying keys from one database to another, the keys do not retain their original TTL.  You must select a new TTL for all keys**

**I would like an option to keep original TTL and copy TTL (for each key) from one database to the other.**
I'm using the SSL option for the connection. I provided an Authority pem file. On test connection, the output is Connection error: The root certificate of the certificate chain is self-signed and, untrusted.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A checkbox that would allow self signed certficates and connect to the server.

Hi,
How can i see the data is passed by a channel, when we use pubsub? Only "channel name" is shown in "Pub/Sub Channel" tab.

Thanks.
