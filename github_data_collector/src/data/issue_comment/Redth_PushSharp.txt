The PushSharp has support to this new protocol?

This PR adds support for using a proxy when sending GCM notifications.

Partially fixes https://github.com/Redth/PushSharp/issues/664.

### What version of PushSharp are you using?
4.0.10.0
### Describe your issue:
Background push notifications are not received by **iOS 13** devices properly. 
### What are the steps required to reproduce this issue?
Send a background push notification by specifying: aps-content-available:1 and payload. 
### Please provide any Exception Stack Traces
No exception.  Notification sends properly, but never received as a background notification.  Possible it is received as a foreground notification, not sure.  

See the following in iOS Notifications documentation: 
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/sending_notification_requests_to_apns

Excerpt on Headers:
apns-push-type : 
(Required when delivering   notifications to devices running **iOS 13** and later, or watchOS 6 and later. Ignored on earlier system versions.) The type of the   notification. The value of this header is alert or background.   Specify alert when the delivery of your notification displays   an alert, plays a sound, or badges your app's icon. Specify background for silent notifications that do not interact   with the user.   The   value of this header must accurately reflect the contents of your   notification's payload. If there is a mismatch, or if the header is missing   on required systems, APNs may delay the delivery of the notification or drop   it altogether.   For   information about configuring notification alerts, see Generating a Remote Notification. For more   information about sending background notifications, see Pushing Background Updates to Your App.

I only see headers being used when using HttpTwo.  If that is working, the fix may not be too complex. 



### What version of PushSharp are you using?

4.0.10

### Describe your issue:

Is there a way to disable PushSharp's console logging?

Just upgraded from PushSharp 2->4.0.10 and we are seeing a lot of logging in the console.  At load, this is causing a lot of new slowness that is degrading the performance of some high-traffic tasks.

### What are the steps required to reproduce this issue?

Using the ApnsPushBroker and queueing notifications.

What version of PushSharp are you using?
4.0.10

Describe your issue:
Unable to wake the android phone when I receive a Push GCM Notification

What are the steps required to reproduce this issue?

1. Ensure my app has been started once
2. Restart phone
3. Ensure phone is on lock screen and screen light is off i.e sleep mode
3. Send GCM notification from my Rest API
4. I receive notification as I hear the notification sound, but I don't see the message as the device is still in sleep mode. (the notification is on lock screen) but it never wakes the device up for the user to see it.

I don't have this problem with IOS.

This is the message I'm sending. My android phone does not wake up when it receives this notification below, it only produces the sound and the screen is still in sleep mode

 gcmNotification = new GcmNotification
                {
                    To = notification.DeviceToken,                    
                    Data = JObject.FromObject(new
                    {
                        title = notification.Title,
                        body = notification.Body,
                        encrypted = notification.Encrypted,
                        eventName = notification.EventName,
                        eventArgs = notification.EventArgs,
                        priority = 2
                    }),
                    Priority = GcmNotificationPriority.High,
                    TimeToLive = 0
                };


This is my android manifest xml:
