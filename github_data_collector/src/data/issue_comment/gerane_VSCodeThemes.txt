Hello, 
Seems that diff files are not syntax-highlighted (works when switching to another theme).
Any plans to support this ?
Thanks in advance.
on selected text background color contrast is not visible
Pictures can be more intuitive ðŸ˜„ 
I don't see any license info for the Monokai Dimmed theme. Is it available for me to use as a color theme in another project?
Thanks for a nice theme. I just noticed a significant UX issue with C/C++ files, namely [this file](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/source/common/common/logger.h).

The part after `#define` is barely readable - we should probably try to find a better color for this.

Everything except comments is rendered either white or light blue, as seen in the screenshot above.

Closing tags have a white < and the rest of the tag light blue.

Since the recent update to the fantastic Monokai theme, blade templates have had a shady color scheme that is different from the usual colors when working with .html files. Any update to fix this? Here are the screenshots:

This is what I see after having installed (via vscode market place) and activated the neon theme:

I'm assuming that's not intended behaviour? I see this both on an iMac and on a windows 10 computer.
