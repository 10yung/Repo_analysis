I get this error:
`QNetworkReplyImplPrivate::error: Internal problem, this method must only be called once.`
 when setting middlewares like document 
that's like a bug when I use in scrapy python
i set 
```
DUPEFILTER_CLASS = 'scrapy_splash.SplashAwareDupeFilter'

HTTPCACHE_STORAGE = 'scrapy_splash.SplashAwareFSCacheStorage'
```
in setting too

sorry for bad English

@kmike I’m extremely unsure about this change, I have no idea of the side effects it may have.

I am trying to add test coverage to https://codecov.io/gh/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/src/master/scrapy_splash/cookies.py#L111

This change adds such coverage, and ensures that `cookie_to_har(har_to_cookie(har_cookie)) == har_cookie` works if no path is specified.

On the other hand, setting ``/`` as a default path comes from Requests, where [it’s still used](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/89ab030cdb83a728a30e172bc65d27ba214d2eda/requests/cookies.py#L453). Their implementation does have a difference that we lost when we simplified our code: they set `path='/'` if the `path` parameter is not received, but if `path=None` is received that `None` value is used instead; but I’m not sure if that is relevant to our use case, and it would not make `cookie_to_har(har_to_cookie(har_cookie)) == har_cookie` work either.

I see that the standalone splash has support for chromium choosing the engine through the args supplied to splash. How do I switch engines with scrapy splash?
Corrected a typo
When I use response.follow, callback response.url is not correct.
It makes force you to use SplashRequest and join url to follow link.
Since SplashRequest extends Request, but the follow method become useless. it make more code to follow link.

The request url is detail url , but the response.url  in callback is not the same as the request url.
It seem 'url' is not prefilled from request url.
Continuation of #15.

Related to #11, although since it works at the spider level, not at a wider, project level, I wouldn’t say it fixes it.
I have experienced the following errors:

1 - Website loads perfectly fine with Chrome, Splash always throws this error

![Splash_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52583822/60804980-224e8300-a17f-11e9-9b09-32bd28b6a37d.PNG)



2 - Loading screen never finishes despite high waiting time.

Are there any plans to fix these issues?

Thanks!
Covers commits until https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/commit/e40ca4f3b367ab463273bee1357d3edfe0601f0d

I assumed 0.8.0 (instead of 0.7.3) because there is a (backward-compatible) API change.
