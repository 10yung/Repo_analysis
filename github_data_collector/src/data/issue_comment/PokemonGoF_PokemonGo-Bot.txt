> 
> **Deprecations**
>

Bumps [flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) from 0.11.1 to 1.0.
<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [flask's releases](https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases).*

> ## 1.0
> The Pallets team is pleased to release Flask 1.0. [Read the announcement on our blog.](https://www.palletsprojects.com/blog/flask-1-0-released/
> 
> There are over a year's worth of changes in this release. Many features have been improved or changed. [Read the changelog](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/changelog/) to understand how your project's code will be affected.
> 
> 
> JSON Security Fix
> ------------------
> 
> Flask previously decoded incoming JSON bytes using the content type of the request. Although JSON should only be encoded as UTF-8, Flask was more lenient. However, Python includes non-text related encodings that could result in unexpected memory use by a request.
> 
> Flask will now detect the encoding of incoming JSON data as one of the supported UTF encodings, and will not allow arbitrary encodings from the request.
> 
> 
> Install or Upgrade
> -------------------
> 
> Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) with pip:
> 
>     pip install -U Flask
> 
> ## 0.12.4
> This is a repackage of [0.12.3](https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases/0.12.3) to fix an issue with how the package was built.
> 
> 
> Upgrade
> --------
> 
> Upgrade from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/0.12.4/) with pip. Use a version identifier if you want to stay at 0.12:
> 
>     pip install -U 'Flask~=0.12.4'
> 
> ## 0.12.3
> This release includes an important security fix for JSON and a minor backport for CLI support in PyCharm. It is provided for projects that cannot update to Flask 1.0 immediately. See the [1.0 announcement](https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/flask-1-0-released) and update to it instead if possible.

*Sourced from [flask's changelog](https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/master/CHANGES.rst).*

> Version 1.0
> -----------
> 
> Released 2018-04-26
> 
> -   Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.
> -   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
>     Werkzeug >= 0.14, Jinja >= 2.10, itsdangerous >= 0.24, Click >= 5.1.
>     :issue:`2586`
> -   Skip :meth:`app.run <Flask.run>` when a Flask application is run
>     from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
>     to debug.
> -   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
>     ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
>     default, and an indented format in debug mode. :pr:`2193`
> -   :meth:`Flask.__init__ <Flask>` accepts the ``host_matching``
>     argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. :issue:`1559`
> -   :meth:`Flask.__init__ <Flask>` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
>     and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
>     route. :issue:`1559`
> -   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
>     :pr:`2223`
> -   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
>     :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. :pr:`2017`
> -   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
>     ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
>     ``OPTIONS`` method. :pr:`1489`
> -   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
>     base classes. :pr:`1936`
> -   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
>     request are handled by the app's error handlers. :pr:`2254`
> -   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
>     :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app's
>     encoder and decoder. :pr:`1898`
> -   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
>     ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
>     improved to describe why the type is invalid. :pr:`2256`
> -   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
>     application. :pr:`2259`
> -   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
>     address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
>     Chrome. :pr:`2282`
> -   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. :pr:`2282`
> -   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
>     ``SERVER_NAME``. :pr:`2282`
> -   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
>     ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. :pr:`2297`
> -   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
>     parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
>     parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the

## Short Description:
corrected typos
## Fixes/Resolves/Closes (please use correct syntax):
-
The actual installer is broken, when i ejecute ./setup.sh -i or ./setup.sh -u the instalation fails installing pgoapi. 
The log is:
Collecting pgoapi from git+https://github.com/MerlionRock/pgoapi.git@develop#egg=pgoapi (from -r requirements.txt (line 4))
  Cloning https://github.com/MerlionRock/pgoapi.git (to revision develop) to /tmp/pip-install-fboa19o8/pgoapi
    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
      File "/tmp/pip-install-fboa19o8/pgoapi/setup.py", line 5, in <module>
        from pip.req import parse_requirements
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pip.req'

I reproduce it in Arch, gentoo and debian.




Hi, wanted to ask if the bot is still working for the latest updates, since talk.pogodev.org is no longer available and so no installation is possible
Best regards
I continue to get red circle of death loading PTC. It never shows my account how can I fix this
Is it possible to check friends level or CP with bot?
Any plan to support friends feature?
