Can you use these themes with the reveal slideshow extension for jupyter?

GitHub changed the way Markdown headings are parsed, so this change fixes it.

See [bryant1410/readmesfix](https://github.com/bryant1410/readmesfix) for more information.

mkdir -p the css directory for an even easier installation example

I keep getting this error when I try to install the notebook themes

wget: invalid option -- '0'
Usage: wget [OPTION]... [URL]...

First of all, thank you for your work in putting these themes together. Light themes (such as IPython's default theme) hurt my eyes.

I upgraded to IPython 3.0 today, and discovered that my menu bar is gone when calling `ipython notebook --profile=solarized-dark` (a partial screenshot of the top of one of my IPython notebooks):

I almost thought that this was an issue with IPython for a moment, but then I called `ipython notebook`, and the menu bar reappeared:

...with just one tweak. I reversed the input area color because white was just... too bright. 

```
37 div.input_area {
38   /* Input area with dark background; */
39   background-color: #1e222a; /* added */
40   border-radius: 0px;
41   border: 1px solid #4f5b66;
42 }
43 /* Set light on dark text; */
44 div.CodeMirror-code pre {
45   color: white;  /* added */                                                        
46 }
```

Cheers!
