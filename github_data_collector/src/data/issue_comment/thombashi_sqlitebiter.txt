Hello - 

Really like the product, but having one problem, given some tables that I'm converting. 

Is there no way to force a data type (say, TEXT instead of INTEGER) in a CSV file? I can switch to JSON, if that input format allows data type assignment.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated!

Best ~

Flatten JSON which has JSON schema format currently not supported before converting.
