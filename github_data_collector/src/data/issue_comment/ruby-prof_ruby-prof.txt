The master build is currently failing on travis (and also on my machine). I think we should bring master to a state where travis builds are consistently passing.

https://travis-ci.org/ruby-prof/ruby-prof/builds/631386009

 
I'm attempting to get started with profiling my existing Rails application and followed the instructions in the REAMDE under [Profiling Rails](https://ruby-prof.github.io/#profiling-rails).

I've created a `:profile` environment,  added the gem to the gemfile, and updated `config.ru` to use the rack adapter.

I am able to start my server locally just fine using the profile environment, however I get the following in the browser:
`An unhandled lowlevel error occurred. The application logs may have details.`

And I get the following stacktrace:

```

```

Is there another step that I missed around calling `RubyProf.start` somewhere?

Thanks for any guidance you can offer!
