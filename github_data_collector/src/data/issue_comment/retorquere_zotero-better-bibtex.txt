`citr` is taking a considerably long time (90-100 sec) to connect to the Zotero database with my large database. 

**Report ID:**
WF6BPCRX-euc

I understand that exporting (unsing Better BibLaTeX) a very large Zotero database simply takes time and creates rather large `bibtex` files (in my case 13845 entries create a `bibtex` file that is 7.3 MB. So no squabbles here. My understanding with updates using the BBT "automatic update" feature is that those should happen incrementally? (Not sure, if that's the right description). So, after, say 10 or so more entries, the export shouldn't take as long as if you'd export from scratch. This does not seem to be the case in my set-up.

**Report ID:**
RRPZJI6J-euc
**Exporter used:** 
BBT 5.2.7
**Expected behavior:**
Incremental update
**Actual behavior:**
Full update (very slow)

Also, the interaction with [citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr) is veeeery slow. Not sure if those two things are related? The instructions on `citr` say that BBT is needed for this to work:

> If you are using Zotero citr can access your reference database directly. For this to work, you need to install the Better BibTeX extension. Once the extension is installed and your reference manager is running, citr can access all your references and keep your bibliography file updated by adding missing references. 

As suggested over at [citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr), I omit the following fields in the BBT "export" settings: 
abstract, note, file, tag, attachment

So I thought I just might ask if there's a connection before starting a new issue.

Details on the issue is posted here: https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/79118/item-title-contains-unicode-character-and-result-in-bibliography-export-issue 

I opened this issue as per Emiliano's request. However, given the response from dstillman, the unicode character μ, gets converted to uppercase character  Μ. I am guessing this is a built in behavior in Zotero, so BBT may not be to blame

BBT bug report ID: 2X6WV2HM-euc 
With apologies for reviving a similar [thread](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/issues/482) (#482), I ask if @retorquere is able to assist again with multi-lingual fields export using BBT (v5.1.139) in Juris-M (5.0.71m4). 

I have uploaded this entry as a debugging report `MDYA7RAM-euc`. Here's an example of a citation in question,

`Chen Zhongyuan 陈重远, Liulichang shihua 琉璃厂史话 [History of Liulichang] (Beijing chubanshe, 2015).`

The output in my bib file reads:

`@book{chen2015e,
  langid = {pinyin},
  title = {琉璃厂史话},
  isbn = {978-7-200-11112-5},
  abstract = {},
  pagetotal = {198},
  titleaddon = {History of Liulichang},
  usere = {Liulichang shihua},
  publisher = {{北京出版社}},
  date = {2015},
  keywords = {},
  author = {陈, 重远}
}`

So the transliterations of some fields (author and publisher) have disappeared, but the transliteration of title is successfully exported.

Also, I do not know if I should take up this issue with Pandoc, but when converting the citation key using my bib file and the Chicago (full note) CSL, the output became `陈重远, 琉璃厂史话. History of Liulichang (北京出版社, 2015)`; the transliterations are all gone! Using the same CSL, Juris-M is able to render the correct citation. Is it an issue with my CSL or Pandoc?

 Thank you in advance for your help.
As mentioned in issue #1100 I am looking for a solution the overcomes Zotero's limitation to a single title field. The code in your answer works but this poses another problem: We need to change the code before every export if we need another separator. So: Would it be possible the select the used postscript code just before the export.

# Feature Request: Easier File Export per collection generation

## Background
I realise this may not fit the workflow for some, but I think for the goal of this project 'latex holdouts' it fits.
I like to sort papers through the collection/folder structure by topic. 
Then using the exporter and then within my text editor (vim) I can take advantage of the autocompletion.
Previously I used Mendeley and it generated a per folder/collection .bib file which I could symlink to the project/paper/section I was working on and take advantage of the cite-keys being generated and immediately available.

It would be great if for numerous / many collections it were easier to generate multiple export files - AFAIK this is not possible without manually going by collection and creating an export. For people importing a large collection / who like to do lots of sorting this is very tedious.

(If this feature exists this feature then is about improving the documentation of said feature!)

## The feature

- Automatically produced individual bibliography files
- Format possibly selectable using a menu option
- Directory where to place these files possibly determinable?

## Foreseen Problems

- **How to avoid naming clashes between sub-collections?** create a directory per library, and per collection prefix the collection name with the collection-hierarchy. This also keeps in line with the `keep keys unique` options

Any plan for this to change? I was using it in a few places. Thanks.

To reproduce, make a new empty collection and select it, change the search bar to search "All fields and tags" or "everything", and enter a simple search term. The empty list of items will populate with results from other collections (although not the entire library it seems).

It's not at all obvious to me why this is related to BBT, but it goes away if I disable the extension.
Sometimes there is need to change ones favourite formatting pattern to be able to collaborate more easily. Although changing this manually have always been an option is error prone and time consuming. It would be ideal to have a default formatting and a number (3 or 5?) of alternative formats to chose from when exporting.

 eg:
`[auth][year][shorttitle]`
`[auth:lower][year]`

Thanks for the fantastic work.

I noticed that ZBB retains the original "date-added" and "date-modified" fields from a BibDesk-generated `*.bib` in the Zotero `Extra` field, such as:

```
bibtex{"date-added":"2016-08-20 09:21:14 +0000","date-modified":"2016-08-20 09:21:14 +0000"}
```

That is great.

Could ZBB also write this data into the respective "native" Zotero fields?

I'd like to retain this information, if at all possible.
