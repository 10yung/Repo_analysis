> Version 0.15.3
> --------------
> 
> Released 2019-05-14
> 
> -   Properly handle multi-line header folding in development server in
>     Python 2.7. (:issue:`1080`)
> -   Restore the ``response`` argument to :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized`.
>     (:pr:`1527`)
> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` doesn't add the ``WWW-Authenticate``
>     header if ``www_authenticate`` is not given. (:issue:`1516`)
> -   The default URL converter correctly encodes bytes to string rather
>     than representing them with ``b''``. (:issue:`1502`)
> -   Fix the filename format string in
>     :class:`~middleware.profiler.ProfilerMiddleware` to correctly handle
>     float values. (:issue:`1511`)
> -   Update :class:`~middleware.lint.LintMiddleware` to work on Python 3.
>     (:issue:`1510`)
> -   The debugger detects cycles in chained exceptions and does not time
>     out in that case. (:issue:`1536`)
> -   When running the development server in Docker, the debugger security
>     pin is now unique per container.
> 
> 
> Version 0.15.2
> --------------
> 
> Released 2019-04-02
> 
> -   ``Rule`` code generation uses a filename that coverage will ignore.
>     The previous value, "generated", was causing coverage to fail.
>     (:issue:`1487`)
> -   The test client removes the cookie header if there are no persisted
>     cookies. This fixes an issue introduced in 0.15.0 where the cookies
>     from the original request were used for redirects, causing functions
>     such as logout to fail. (:issue:`1491`)
> -   The test client copies the environ before passing it to the app, to
>     prevent in-place modifications from affecting redirect requests.
>     (:issue:`1498`)
> -   The ``"werkzeug"`` logger only adds a handler if there is no handler
>     configured for its level in the logging chain. This avoids double
>     logging if other code configures logging first. (:issue:`1492`)
> 
> 
> Version 0.15.1
> --------------
> 
> Released 2019-03-21
> 
> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` takes ``description`` as the first

Bumps [flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) from 0.12.2 to 1.0.
<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [flask's releases](https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases).*

> ## 1.0
> The Pallets team is pleased to release Flask 1.0. [Read the announcement on our blog.](https://www.palletsprojects.com/blog/flask-1-0-released/
> 
> There are over a year's worth of changes in this release. Many features have been improved or changed. [Read the changelog](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/changelog/) to understand how your project's code will be affected.
> 
> 
> JSON Security Fix
> ------------------
> 
> Flask previously decoded incoming JSON bytes using the content type of the request. Although JSON should only be encoded as UTF-8, Flask was more lenient. However, Python includes non-text related encodings that could result in unexpected memory use by a request.
> 
> Flask will now detect the encoding of incoming JSON data as one of the supported UTF encodings, and will not allow arbitrary encodings from the request.
> 
> 
> Install or Upgrade
> -------------------
> 
> Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) with pip:
> 
>     pip install -U Flask
> 
> ## 0.12.4
> This is a repackage of [0.12.3](https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases/0.12.3) to fix an issue with how the package was built.
> 
> 
> Upgrade
> --------
> 
> Upgrade from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/0.12.4/) with pip. Use a version identifier if you want to stay at 0.12:
> 
>     pip install -U 'Flask~=0.12.4'

> This release includes an important security fix for JSON and a minor backport for CLI support in PyCharm. It is provided for projects that cannot update to Flask 1.0 immediately. See the [1.0 announcement](https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/flask-1-0-released) and update to it instead if possible.
> 
> 
> JSON Security Fix
> ------------------
> 
> Flask previously decoded incoming JSON bytes using the content type of the request. Although JSON should only be encoded as UTF-8, Flask was more lenient. However, Python includes non-text related encodings that could result in unexpected memory use by a request.
> 
> Flask will now detect the encoding of incoming JSON data as one of the supported UTF encodings, and will not allow arbitrary encodings from the request.
> 
> 
> Upgrade
> --------
> 
> Upgrade from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) with pip. Use a version identifier if you want to stay at 0.12:
> 
>     pip install -U 'Flask~=0.12.3'

> Version 1.0
> -----------
> 
> Released 2018-04-26
> 
> -   Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.
> -   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
>     Werkzeug >= 0.14, Jinja >= 2.10, itsdangerous >= 0.24, Click >= 5.1.
>     :issue:`2586`
> -   Skip :meth:`app.run <Flask.run>` when a Flask application is run
>     from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
>     to debug.
> -   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
>     ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
>     default, and an indented format in debug mode. :pr:`2193`
> -   :meth:`Flask.__init__ <Flask>` accepts the ``host_matching``
>     argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. :issue:`1559`
> -   :meth:`Flask.__init__ <Flask>` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
>     and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
>     route. :issue:`1559`
> -   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
>     :pr:`2223`
> -   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
>     :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. :pr:`2017`
> -   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
>     ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
>     ``OPTIONS`` method. :pr:`1489`
> -   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
>     base classes. :pr:`1936`
> -   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
>     request are handled by the app's error handlers. :pr:`2254`
> -   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
>     :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app's
>     encoder and decoder. :pr:`1898`
> -   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
>     ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
>     improved to describe why the type is invalid. :pr:`2256`
> -   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
>     application. :pr:`2259`
> -   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
>     address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
>     Chrome. :pr:`2282`
> -   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. :pr:`2282`
> -   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
>     ``SERVER_NAME``. :pr:`2282`
> -   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
>     ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. :pr:`2297`
> -   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
>     parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
>     parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the

I cannot access flasky app on localhost:8000 or even on http://192.168.99.100:5000/. Containers are running, but in my browser I get this error:

My OS is Window Home. I use DockerToolbox
The code is from checkout 17f. I am doing every step as described in your book, but getting no success.

Containers started both with docker run  and docker-compose give the same bad result.
Also, I attach the result of **docker-compose log** command, if it can be useful.

Could you please help in this? Thank you in advance

> ## HTTPie 1.0.3
> Fixed CVE-2019-10751 — the way the output filename is generated for `--download` requests without `--output` resulting in a redirect has been changed to only consider the initial URL as the base for the generated filename, and not the final one. This fixes a potential security issue under the following scenario:
> 
> 1. A `--download` request with no explicit `--output` is made (e.g., `$ http -d  example.org/file.txt`), instructing HTTPie to [generate the output filename](https://httpie.org/doc#downloaded-filename) from the `Content-Disposition` response header, or from the URL if the header is not provided.
> 2. The server handling the request has been modified by an attacker and instead of the expected response the URL returns a redirect to another URL, e.g., `attacker.example.org/.bash_profile`, whose response does not provide  a `Content-Disposition` header (i.e., the base for the  generated filename becomes `.bash_profile` instead of `file.txt`).
> 3. Your current directory doesn’t already contain `.bash_profile` (i.e., no unique suffix is added to the generated filename).
> 4. You don’t notice the potentially unexpected output filename as reported by HTTPie in the console output (e.g., `Downloading 100.00 B to ".bash_profile"`).
> 
> ## HTTPie 1.0.2
> * Fixed tests for installation with pyOpenSSL.
> 
> ## HTTPie 1.0.1
> * Removed external URL calls from tests.
> 
> ## HTTPie 1.0.0
> 
> * Added ``--style=auto`` which follows the terminal ANSI color styles.
> * Added support for selecting TLS 1.3 via ``--ssl=tls1.3``
>   (available once implemented in upstream libraries).
> * Added ``true``/``false`` as valid values for ``--verify``
>   (in addition to ``yes``/``no``) and the boolean value is case-insensitive.
> * Changed the default ``--style`` from ``solarized`` to ``auto`` (on Windows it stays ``fruity``).
> * Fixed default headers being incorrectly case-sensitive.
> * Removed Python 2.6 support.

I want to test the Heroku deployment on Windows, so I use Waitress web server.

When I try to run `heroku local` command to read Procfile and execute the task Procfile defined,
the terminal shows that
```
$ heroku local

```
The content in my Procfile is
`web: waitress-serve --port=$PORT flasky:app`

I also activate Waitress server by the command `waitress-serve --port 8000 flasky:app` in another terminal. 

The book says that Heroku assigns a PORT environment variable to the task.
Does the error message above means that the task doesn't get PORT environment variable?
Should I assign PORT somewhere?

Thanks.
