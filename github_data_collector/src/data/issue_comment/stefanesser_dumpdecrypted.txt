Hello, I would like to know is this compatible with iOS 11.2.6?

I was working on a security research task with my colleague, it's about trying to decrypted a testing app without a given ipa file.

But when we trying to execute command "DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/path/to/dumpdecrypted.dylib /path/to/executable", we always get "Killed:9" error on terminal.

We tried many solutions like: sign the dylib file before copy it into sandbox by using codesign command on macOS X, change to mobile user before execute command by using su mobile, also we tried the solution in https://github.com/stefanesser/dumpdecrypted/issues/19, but all we got is still "Killed:9" error.

We try to track the device log to see what actually happened, then we found the error message on device log is "kernel(Sandbox)[0] <Error>: Sandbox: hook..execve() killing <unsigned>[pid=5001, uid=0]: only launchd is allowed to spawn untrusted binaries" when we execute command "DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/path/to/dumpdecrypted.dylib /path/to/executable" everytime.

But both of us are really not good at using macOS X. We still have no idea after tring to find some information, we hope you guys can give us some direction or help.

Thanks for help.

btw, here's our running environment:

macOS X EL Capitan, 10.11.6
Xcode version 8.0(8A218a)
iPhone 7 Plus, iOS 11.2.6, jailbreaked by Electra1131 1.1.0

My iPhone is iPhone5 (ios 8.1).The CPU used ARMV7. How i decrypted the X64 Mach-o?
Hi, 
I have added commands to sign the dylib before injecting it. 
Else the tool gives an output saying "required code signature missing for '../dumpdecrypted.dylib"

Also, have made minute formatting changes in the README file. 
Is this compatible with ios 10? Don't want to accidentally brick my device or anything... Thanks :)

Hi! Trying to use your great utility on iOS 9 and getting this message:

```
dyld: could not load inserted library '/var/mobile/Media/dumpdecrypted.dylib' because no suitable image found.  Did find:
/var/mobile/Media/dumpdecrypted.dylib: open() failed with errno=1

Trace/BPT trap: 5
```

Is there a way to fix it?

New PrivateFrameworks in Xcode 7.x & iOS SDK 9.x and new iOS app sandbox location in iOS 8+
