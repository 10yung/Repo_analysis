I am trying to make the hamburger menu sticky. I see where this was asked and answered some time ago, but the answer is no longer a functioning link. Does anyone have any info on doing that?
Can we get an update to the state of the library? It's got a lot of stars but it also hasn't been updated in a while. Does it still work? Perhaps there could be a list of the most common issues in the readme?

Otherwise can someone please recommend an alternative? I've been searching for a responsive  gesture swipe-able side menu for days now. 
On the [default demo](http://jakiestfu.github.io/Snap.js/demo/apps/default.html#), if I start dragging the hamburger menu and move my pointer over the sidebar, the drag breaks.  I'm guessing you're listening to `mousemove` on the wrong element or forgot to capture the pointer if you're using pointer events.

Incidentally, the [drag element](http://jakiestfu.github.io/Snap.js/demo/apps/dragElement.html) demo doesn't seem to have the same problem.
Hi there, I noticed a super strange behaviour when my modal will jump up and down if I have my mouse over some buttons.

Check out the quick video I made of it: https://youtu.be/dY8Em-O2R54

It uses TextAngular in my modal, grey buttons are not using position:relative so they don't trigger this behaviour for some reason.

If the modal is not scrolled, or if button have not position: relative, then no jumping happens.

If I disable snap.js, then the behaviour stops.

Any idea what the problem could be? Seems like a rendering bug as nothing seems to change in the DOM nor any event is fired.

I originally posted this on TextAngular as I think this was something done by their code: https://github.com/fraywing/textAngular/issues/1392

Hello

I got a problem with adding a bootstrap dropdown menu to the snap menu. The area expanded flag of the menu is always set to false? Is this compatible?
I there a way to add collapsable submenus?

@jakiestfu Would you be open to adding more collaborators to this repo? It's a great piece of software, would love to see it live on.

These two forks have some enhancements, e.g. around ES6 modules, perhaps one of them (or both) would be interested?

Is there a way to manually trigger the `start`event? I have an horizontal scrolling div, and I'm trying to drag the snapper out when the scrollLeft is 0, but disable the snapper if the div is scrolled. this way I can slide through my div normally unless I reach scrollLeft 0.

I though of triggering the `start`event when trying to swipe when reaching scrollLeft 0
