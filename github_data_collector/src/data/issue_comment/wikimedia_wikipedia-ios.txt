I'll push the remaining converter updates to this PR to keep things cleaner.

- [x] use correct vars instead of [MobileviewToMobileHTMLDomain and MobileviewToMobileHTMLBaseURI](https://github.com/wikimedia/wikipedia-ios/compare/mobileview-converter?expand=1#diff-2db4abc4a0ec0e1baf65b513458ee7edR129) temp vars (one of these will still need to change once we switch from labs to prod)
- [x] remove this [todo comment](https://github.com/wikimedia/wikipedia-ios/compare/mobileview-converter?expand=1#diff-2db4abc4a0ec0e1baf65b513458ee7edR206)
- [ ] kick off and run [converter](https://github.com/wikimedia/wikipedia-ios/compare/mobileview-converter?expand=1#diff-2db4abc4a0ec0e1baf65b513458ee7edR206) for each article in `dataStore.savedPageList` (on app being backgrounded or inactivity)
- [ ] determine post-conversion cleanup needed so article only converted once

This is a first pass of a Random Article widget. It's somewhat na√Øve, and may well require at least some sort of throttling so it doesn't attempt to reload a new article every single time it's viewed.
