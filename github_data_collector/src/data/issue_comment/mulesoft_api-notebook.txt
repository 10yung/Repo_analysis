### Configuration Summary

Based on the default config's presets, Renovate will:

  - Start dependency updates only once this Configure Renovate PR is merged
  - Separate major versions of dependencies into individual branches/PRs
  - Do not separate patch and minor upgrades into separate PRs for the same dependency
  - Upgrade to unstable versions only if the existing version is unstable
  - Raise PRs immediately (after branch is created)
  - If semantic commits detected, use semantic commit type <code>fix</code> for dependencies and <code>chore</code> for all others
  - Keep existing branches updated even when not scheduled
  - Disable automerging feature - wait for humans to merge all PRs
  - Ignore `node_modules`, `bower_components`, `vendor` and various test/tests directories
  - Update existing lock files only when <code>package.json</code> is modified
  - Autodetect whether to pin dependencies or maintain ranges
  - Rate limit PR creation to a maximum of two per hour
  - Limit to maximum 20 open PRs at any time
  - Group known monorepo packages together

Hi

I am new to api notebook. trying to access resource name with ‘-’ in it. what is the way for it.

url = https://mocksvc.mulesoft.com/mocks/433594cc-f8f6-4210-a666/v1/client-question-file/thn-number-filter
i tried as shown below
"
API.createClient(‘client’, ‘https://mocksvc.mulesoft.com/mocks/433594cc-f8f6-4210-a666/v1/client-question-file/thn-number-filter’);
adhc= client.post();

"

and

"
API.createClient(‘client’, ‘6685074d-b1e6-4cfa-b8ea-22a038aa6e1a’, ‘client-question-file’, ‘1.0.0’, ‘thn-number-filter’);
adhc= client.post();

getting errors in both the approach. please help


Your FOSSA integration was successful! Attached in this PR is a badge and license report to track scan status in your README.

- [Other](https://github.com/fossas/license-cli)
As mentioned [on the forum](http://forums.raml.org/t/api-notebook-resources-with-json-extension/1799), I tried to use API Notebooks with our TransportAPI RAML, but hit a problem with the .json extensions in our resource names
* [TransportAPI RAML](https://transportapi.com/v3/raml/transportapi.raml)
* [My test notebook](https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/notebooks/#7083068ba019704ffb8f92c068430dab3)

We define resources with a with a .json extension. For example one API URL is http://transportapi.com/v3/uk/bus/stops/near.json?and_some_params 

Because the resource is named 'near.json', the typeahead feature isn't finding it all, and it doesn't seem to be possible to call the endpoint.

I guess I would hope to use javascript looking like this : `transportapi.uk.bus.stops.near.get(`_params_`)`
API Notebook only seems to support RAML 0.8. Attempting to use a RAML 1.0 file prompts the error message:

`Unsupported RAML version: '#%RAML 1.0'`

Apologies if this is more of a question than an issue, it seems strange this has not been flagged previously. Is support for RAML 1.0 available, or else planned at all?

Thanks.
When running the last item:

```
// The song's details will be in the response body.
songs.songs.songId('3').get();
```
When executing "Let's access a particular song:"
I get a 404 error:
```
$3=	
Object {"body": "Cannot GET /mocks/n8/songs/3", "status": 404, "headers": Object}
body: "Cannot GET /mocks/n8/songs/3"
headers: Object
status: 404
```

Thanks
I am trying to generate documentation for a hyphenated url

/portal/icd-codes 

but I am not able to access the route "client.portal.icd-codes" from api notebook.

Hey guys,
I am creating documentation using this tool to show how people can use my REST API, but `API Notebook plugin` and `raml-client-generator` are using different syntax to create clients and make calls so someone can't copy 1:1 code and make it work locally.

I was wondering if it is possible to use `raml-client-generator` inside Notebooks? Or maybe there is a package that has the same API as Notebooks and I couldn't find it?
It would make writing documentation so much easier!

Cheers

I am a newer about the api-notebook, when I try to expose it as a webapp through `grunt build`. It did not works well, it noticed 'can't establish a connection to the server at localhost:3000.' The second problem I met is that how I can use the local raml file rather than url. `API.createClient('users','\home\api.raml')` it did not work well.

Thank you very much!
