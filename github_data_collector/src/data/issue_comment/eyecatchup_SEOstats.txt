Hi,

i have changed ApiKeys class to work everywhere using getenv function insteed of env function.
Maybe i'm wrong, but with env function for me SEOStats doesn't seems work.

Please let me know if this fix can be good.

Bye 
most of them are not working (Social Media)(and Google)
Hello,

I'm still a bit new to Laravel. How do I correctly install this in Laravel?. I added this line into composer.json
`"seostats/seostats": "dev-master"`
I then ran `composer update`.
If I for instance try this: `dd(Google::getSerps('Hack Google', 10));` then this works.
But if I want to try this: `print Google::getSiteindexTotal();` I get an error saying : **A non-numeric value encountered**
If I want to try this: `print_r( Google::getPagespeedAnalysis($url) );` I get another error saying: **In order to use the PageSpeed API, you must obtain and set an API key first (see SEOstats\Config\ApiKeys.php).** But I didn't create a SEOstats folder.

What am I missing?

Thank you.

I try to use SEOstats but get ClassNotFoundException 

Attempted to load class "SEOstats" from namespace "SEOstats".
Did you forget a "use" statement for another namespace?

`$seostats = new SEOstats();`
or
`$seostats = new \SEOstats\SEOstats();`

I use PHP7.1 in Linux Ubuntu 17.4

`tests/` should not be exposed to users of the library, so it should be moved to `autoload-dev`. I also found there were two `SEOstatsTest\AbstractServiceTestCase` classes defined. Maybe this should also be fixed.
It looks like Google Serps does not work, right?

Thanks
GitHub changed the way Markdown headings are parsed, so this change fixes it.

As far as i see this is one nice piece of software. Is the development still ongoing or it has been discontinued?
