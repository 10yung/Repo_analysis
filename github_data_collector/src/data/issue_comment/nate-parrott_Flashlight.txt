If anyone can please fix it that would be amazing. I use it very frequently and it's annoying when it doesn't work. Thanks.
I downloaded the 1.0.1 from release, but it can't work with high sierra
The old URL doesn't work anymore.
I hate to see this project stop, and it's hard for forks like @w0lfschild's to actually continue in the long term without either being officially blessed, or changing their project name.

So I'm officially asking: @nate-parrott can we create a github org for flashlight and give @w0lfschild commit access?
I have a line in `examples.txt` like this:

    what do I have @date(tomorrow)

but if I type into spotlight this:

> what do I have tomorrow

it passes my results function the current time's timestamp, rather than tomorrow's.

New to flashlight - Has anyone done a Flashlight plugin which directly queries a PostgreSQL data source?
