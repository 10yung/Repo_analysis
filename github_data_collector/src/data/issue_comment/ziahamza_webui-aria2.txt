Hi, do I need Apache on my Linux or something like that for connect with Aria2 WebUI?
I installed uGet and aria2 using terminal.
Then I type in the terminal `aria2c --enable-rpc --rpc-listen-all`
Then I headed to ` https://ziahamza.github.io/webui-aria2` on my Linux, but It didn't works, but when I set adress to "localhost" and port to "6800" in the settings it was ok, and I have connection.

But how make this from other PC on my local network?
When I type Linux PC adress in my browser like `linux_ip:6800` it not works.
I tried to unlock 6800 port with `iptables -A FORWARD -p TCP --dport 6800 -j ACCEPT` for FORWARD and INPUT, but it still don't work.

What else can I do?


I've been wasting around 4 hours today on this Web UI to get it working but I really can't.
HTTPS doesn't work, so I switched on HTTP on my site but it seems that JSON-RPC gets disconnected continuously or it's not found when using port 6800 (see attachment).
aria2c itself works perfectly fine in SSH, so I suppose it's some settings in the Web UI.
I really don't know what else I can do because I started using this WebUI two years ago and I've lways faced a lot of problems every time I decided to install it.
I've tried to forward 6800 port from my router but I didn't see any difference.

I'm running Apache2 on a Raspberry Pi 3B+, using VirtualHosts to divide different sites. 
The Aria app is started in my RPi as `aria2c --enable-rpc --rpc-listen-all --daemon`.
Please tell me if I need to provide some more details!

Hello,
I use aria and aria-webui to download some file but sometime the downloads stops and it says "I/O file error".
I've already tried to put the option "file-allocation=prealloc" but it don't seem to do something.
I put aria and the webui on my raspberry pi 3 b+ with OSMC as OS.
The directory that i use to put my downloads is a external Hard drive connected to the raspberry.
