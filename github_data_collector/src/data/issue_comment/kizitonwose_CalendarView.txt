When I scroll through the calendar, sometimes the month header "cells" as squashed (multiple of them into a single day). The number of squashed cells varies. The interval of this bug varies as well.

My CalendarView setup:
XAML
`        <com.kizitonwose.calendarview.CalendarView
            android:id="@+id/unitAttendancePlanCalendarHeader"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:background="@color/background_white"
            app:cv_dayViewResource="@layout/calendar_week_day"
            app:cv_monthHeaderResource="@layout/calendar_header"
            app:cv_inDateStyle="none"
            app:cv_outDateStyle="none"
            app:cv_maxRowCount="1"
            app:cv_hasBoundaries="true"
            app:cv_orientation="horizontal"
            app:cv_scrollMode="continuous" />`

Month header binder:
`       class MonthViewContainer(view: View) : ViewContainer(view) {
            val legendLayout = view.legendLayout
        }
        calendarView.monthHeaderBinder = object : MonthHeaderFooterBinder<MonthViewContainer> {
            override fun create(view: View) = MonthViewContainer(view)

            override fun bind(container: MonthViewContainer, month: CalendarMonth) {
                // Setup each header day text if we have not done that already.
                if (container.legendLayout.tag == null) {
                    container.legendLayout.tag = month.yearMonth
                    val locale = Locale.getDefault()
                    container.legendLayout.children.map { it as TextView }.forEachIndexed { index, tv ->
                        tv.text = daysOfWeek[index].getDisplayName(TextStyle.SHORT, locale).toUpperCase(locale)
                    }
                    month.yearMonth
                }
            }
        }`

NOTE: Not the entire header (all week days) is visible. Not sure if that's important. Pretty much the idea is to have a calendar that has a fixed dayWidth and doesn't care whether 4, 7 or "10" week days are visible.

EDIT:
Fixed by changing few attributes as follows:
`            app:cv_inDateStyle="firstMonth"
            app:cv_outDateStyle="endOfRow"`

Also dates were not matching localized names until I changed the following attributes as well:
`app:cv_hasBoundaries="false"`

No idea why any of it worked TBH.
I thought setting 'hasBoundaries' to true in combination with settings both in and out date styles to none is reasonable, since there will be no in and out dates. And you don't want any in and out dates when doing a continuous horizontal scroll, right?
Is there any way scroll progress could be added to the monthScrollListener callback? 

I want to animate the month text TextView I have in my header based on the scroll progress (paged mode).
I add some helper classes to support Jalali(Hijri/Shamsi) calendar which used in Iran/Afghanistan.
Furthermore, I provide an example to show developers, who want to implement Jalali calendar in their apps, how it would be used.
Moreover, **CalendarView** tests are updated to cover Jalali calendar.

You can Read more about [Jalali/Hijri calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Hijri_calendar).(This link is also added to ReadMe)
I added the CalendarView in a ConstraintLayout which I set as the view in a DialogFragment. When the dialog is shown, you see the calendar but then the calendar flashes. Additionally if you scroll to the next month, that month also flashes. After the initial flash upon loading, it is not seen again (until a new instance of the dialog is created).

The CalendarView has its width and height set to "wrap_content" and the width is constrained to a start and end guideline widgets (to act as margin). The flash also occurs if you instead just add layout_margin attributes.
I've recently added the [Chucker library](https://github.com/ChuckerTeam/chucker) to my app and got this build error:

```
Execution failed for task ':app:mergeDebugJavaResource'.
> A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.Workers$ActionFacade
   > More than one file was found with OS independent path 'META-INF/library_release.kotlin_module'
```

It turns out that both CalendarView and Chucker are creating the same `META-INF/library_release.kotlin_module` file:

I've opened an issue on Chucker with more details about the error and some solutions: https://github.com/ChuckerTeam/chucker/issues/134

While there is a way to fix this, it would be nice that to fix the issue on the library itself, which would avoid having every user apply the same fix :)
Three styles from the library's sample project:
