This may be related to browser issues others are having, turning down firefox dev editions main audio slider does not effect audio, you must turn down the audio on a firefox sub process.

Mac 10.15.2 (19C57) BM 0.3.2 Firefox Dev 72.0b3 (64-bit)

This semi works.

DOES NOT work with Opera or Wavebox...

ONLY works on Youtube and known sites like that. I tried on anime sites to help with stream volume issues. I would select firefox when audio would be playing but it did not change the volume when I had the anime playing... help? Can this be fixed?

Edit: I restarted and my audio can be changed on firefox now so my 2nd part of this comment is fixed so far. The first part is still an issue. Works with Discord and Kast...

Hello,

I looked out but couldn't find any other subject open that was about issues with Chrome that had an answer that would work with me.

I just installed the 0.2.3 version of Background Music on my macbook having the Mojave version.
I wanted to use this app to listen to music through the deezer website en Chrome, in a background, when I'm listening to a podcast (someone talking) on iTunes.
The thing is I can adapt the volume of the iTunes app as I want, but the cursor has no effect on the chrome app (tried another website, youtube, nothing changed either) ...
I'm not really good at programming, could somebody help me find a way to adjust the volume of the Chrome app individually please ?

Thank you !
when its running in the background Siri became silent, after quitting the app it became normal...


so, basically I cannot use Siri while the app is running in the background....
I'm not getting app level control on Chrome and Opera (tested on YouTube). It does however work with Safari. 

Other apps like Quicktime and VLC also seem fine.

Great tool BTW!

Hi Everybody,

After updating catalina, app stoped working.

i reinstalled few times and restarted mac but still same. when i try to volume up or down it does nothing. i am using last version of the app and in sound preferences background is not selected for output.
When I try to active the app with my monitor(connected by Mini Displayport -> HDMI) the app send me a message that it's a bug and it can't control HDMI.

I have a MacBook Pro 15'' Mid 2012 with Catalina.  
I was playing audio on Safari as well as Spotify when I noticed that audio from both sources was scrambled. It ran fine when I chose internal speakers, and became garbled whenever I switched back to Bose USB audio. I'm running Catalina with BM 0.3.2

Thanks!
I think there's issues that come up when using an external bluetooth headset for audio input and output. 

I am using external bluetooth headphones (Airpods and Bose QC35) to video call with Zoom. I use Background Music to increase bluetooth audio levels. 

The following set of settings scrambles the audio output to my headset (incoherent audio). 
Background Music output: Airpods
Zoom speaker: Background Music
Zoom microphone: Airpods
System output device: Background music. 


With the below, changed settings (I changed zoom microphone from Airpods to Background Music), no mic input is detected by zoom and the other call attendees cannot hear me. I'm guessing that background music is not transmitting input to zoom. 
Background Music output: Airpods
Zoom speaker: Background Music
Zoom microphone: Airpods
System output device: Background music. 

How can I fix this? Thanks.
Cannot control subset  sound ,often flicker back....
