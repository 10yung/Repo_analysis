Many thanks for your work. 
It seems to me that you have made a very good tool. 
Thank you. 
would it be possible to make an improvement and not repeat the same shortcut, as the image shows.?  
It would be nice to see only several when the shortcuts are different.

Thanks.
Hi,
Thanks for the great product.
I tried to get rid of the mouse-click visual but couldn't. Even when I choose "Disable mouse clicks", the mouse visual still shows up.
I suggest two checkboxes :
- Disable mouse visual only
- Disable mouse clicks & mouse visual
Thanks !
Currently I am only getting the mouse highlight on clicks displayed when the mouse clicks on my primary monitor (of a 3 monitor setup).  I still get the icon to show which mouse button I clicked when I click on another screen, but I only see the highlights on the mouse itself while on the primary screen.

I moved the display of key presses and mouse clicks to another monitor, thinking that the entire overlay was restricted to a single monitor, but even if I displayed the clicks on monitor 2, only monitor 1 would have mouse highlights directly on the cursor.
Currently they are not being shown.
As the title says.
Or have it in right click menu.


when I press "win + shift + f " 
It displays "win + f"

need shift+alt+left mouse for blender
has any one created this combination in a key map?
Keyboard shortcuts with **Shift** do not work.
Instead of displaying "Shift+1" is displayed "!"
Instead of displaying "Shift+2" is displayed "@"
etc.
Instead of displaying "Shift+a", just a large letter "A" Is displayed"
etc.
Hi, 
is it possible to reduce size of mouse icon?
