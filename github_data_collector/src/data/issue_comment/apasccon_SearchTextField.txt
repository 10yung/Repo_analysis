I found a bug when typing locations on Arabic language, as you can see on screenshot, autocomplete and suggestion is always stacked to the right side. I don't know is this a issues or I'm missing something

Is it possible to select multiple suggestion and have it be comma-delimited?
Attach screenshoot:

```
mySearchTextField.itemSelectionHandler = {item, itemPosition in
    mySearchTextField.text = item.title
}
```
By this code, I have got the position of the selected item of the filtered list. I need the position of the whole list.
Sometimes getting the bug and my results(tableview of this repo) is become hidden, althrough I turn on Interface Capture mode and my results are here

What may be wrong? 
I get the fatal error while trying to init itemSuffix: Can't form Range with upperBound < lowerBound. Reproducing with same Cyrillic string inside text and suggestion ( "Москва" for example) I can suggest this fix:

```
fileprivate func filter(forceShowAll addAll: Bool) {
...
if item.title.lowercased().hasPrefix(textToFilter) {
...
  let itemSuffix: Substring = indexFrom < item.title.endIndex ? item.title.suffix(from: indexFrom) : ""
...
  }
}
```
This PR will allow users to select multiple entries on the list.  Prior to this PR, when selecting one entry, the list is dismissed.  With this option, the user is permitted to select multiple options.  The list is removed after the keyboard is dismissed.
cannot use  

> origen.itemSelectionHandler{ filter, i in
>             let item = filter[i]
>             self.origen.text = item.tittle
>             self.desdeIndex = itemPosition
>         }
on xcode 10.2 xcode trows Type of expression is ambiguous without more context . i want to get the selected index upon text selected but cannot compile in xcode 10.2 
My text field just work great but I want to improve the filter to be more flexible.

For example:

 myTextField.filterStrings = ["30.000", "300.000", "3.000.000", "30.000.000]

If I type: "30" then the result will only display: ["30.000", "300.000", "30.000.000"]

I want to ignore some characters, in this case I want to ignore the dot character and the result should be: ["30.000", "300.000", "3.000.000", "30.000.000]
