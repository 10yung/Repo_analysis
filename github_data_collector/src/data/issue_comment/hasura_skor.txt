## New and improved version of Skor is now part of [Hasura GraphQL Engine](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine)

A few months ago, we built the open source [GraphQL Engine](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine) that gives you instant GraphQL APIs over any Postgres database. We have added all of Skor's existing features and even more to make it production ready:

 1) Reliable: We capture every relevant action on the database as an event, even when Hasura is down! The events are delivered to your webhook as soon as possible with an atleast-once guarantee.

2) Scalable: What more, it even scales horizontally. If you are processing millions of events, just add more instances of GraphQL engine.

3) Use with Serverless: If you are using Skor, then avoid the pain of managing your webhook by moving to Serverless infrastructure. Check out these blog posts to get started

**Use [Hasura GraphQL Engine](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine) for production use cases** 


issue #7 talks about adding retries for webhook calls. 
We maybe interested in changes to a specific column or columns  in a specific table and not all db events

For example it is necessary with tables with large rows.
