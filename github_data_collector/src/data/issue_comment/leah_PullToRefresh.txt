# Solution:

``` objectivec
  if ([self isOverThisVersion:@"7.0"]) {
    [self setEdgesForExtendedLayout:UIExtendedEdgeNone];
  }
```


- Added https://github.com/murphy-md/PullToRefresh changes to remove QuartzCore library
- Added https://github.com/leah/PullToRefresh/pull/3 changes for iPad integration
- Added https://github.com/johnkdoe/PullToRefresh changes to make the project ARC compatible but without change the API compatibility
- Allow to build PullToRefresh as iOS Framework

We can do all the animation within Core Animation, without having to use QuartzCore. Makes the installation a bit easier and removes the need for the QuartzCore framework.

I noticed this wipes out any content insets that existed on the table. Could this be modified to preserve them?

some suggested fixes for use with projects that use ARC

1) in the vein of github/jdg/MBProgressHUD.git, add #defines for
   _STRONG and _WEAK so this can be used for both older non-arc and newer
   arc-based projects
2) add @protocol PullToRefreshTableViewDelegate to force the implementor
   to implement their own refresh

also
a) silence "redundant" Xcode 4.4 clang warnings in setupStrings by
   using the suggested fixes for the strings
b) also, localize the strings so a project can decide to set these
   values to whatever makes most sense to the project, and the most
   sense for each localization
c) show how the protocol works in the DemoTableViewController.m

hello,when i  pull  the height >60 ,my  app is crash

Hello.

Now the library doesn't support ARC.
As far as I know there are 2 options to solve this.

The first is adding `-fno-objc-arc` compiler flag for PullRefreshTableViewController.m file in build phases tab of target configs (as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6646052/how-can-i-disable-arc-for-a-single-file-in-a-project)).

The second solution doesn't need any steps for developers. I found it in [ViewDeck library](https://github.com/Inferis/ViewDeck/blob/master/ViewDeck/IIViewDeckController.m).
[Here](https://github.com/kalys/PullToRefresh/blob/arc-support/Classes/PullRefreshTableViewController.m) you can find changes.

Pay attention to the next lines of code.

``` objective-c
#ifndef __has_feature
#define __has_feature(x) 0
#endif
#ifndef __has_extension
#define __has_extension __has_feature // Compatibility with pre-3.0 compilers.
#endif

#if __has_feature(objc_arc) && __clang_major__ >= 3
#define II_ARC_ENABLED 1
#endif // __has_feature(objc_arc)
```

and

``` objective-c
- (void)dealloc {
#if !II_ARC_ENABLED
    [refreshHeaderView release];
    [refreshLabel release];
    [refreshArrow release];
    [refreshSpinner release];
    [textPull release];
    [textRelease release];
    [textLoading release];
    [super dealloc];
#endif
}
```

So the question is which way is correct? And should I pull-request this changes?
