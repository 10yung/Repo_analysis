Some weeks ago my rolling release distro delighted me with PHP7.4.
As I could find some hints that you already adopted some parts of your nice software to this php version I'd like to point out another issue which seems to be related to some "Backward Incompatible Changes" according to [the php documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/de/migration74.incompatible.php). When trying to sync my database by vdirsyncer I'm faced with the above mentioned error. The log files says:
```

Could someone please help me with this issue?
Thanks in advance,

I use the python caldav-package in a python script to request events from an calendar hosted on an baikal server. I try to request events in a time interval with start and stop date. 

a. The script works fine with other calDAV-server. 
b. The script works well with a baikal-hosted caldav-calendar created with ios. 
c. The script works fine with a baikal-hosted calendar created by a baikal-user via browser.
d. the script detects the err. 500 on calendars created by the baikal-admin via admin-site.

I noticed that in case b. there is a "cal:calendar-timezone" property with an valid setting.
In case c. there is no property "cal:calendar-timezone" and in case d. there is an empty "cal:calendar-timezone"-setting. So far it looks like bug #695. But i belive that the server is fine and the baikal admin-tool is buggy. 

I can't offer a proposal, because i can't PHP. But i would prefer a patch that supports the user with no information instead of wrong information. 

Thanks for your support.

<!-- Please describe the problem you are facing -->
I had version 0.4.6 installed and upgraded to 0.6.1 (by overwriting every folder but specific).
I followed the steps mentioned here: http://sabre.io/baikal/upgrade/

When I launch the URL:7500/admin and/or URL:7500/html/admin - it goes to a blank page with a "0" listed and nothing else.

Hi,
I have setup baikal server successfully, but I am unable to send/receive invites when a user creates an event. I followed http://sabre.io/dav/scheduling/ directions with no success. 
 
It would be great if someone can direct me how to use subclass of IMipPlugin so I can use IMAP/SMTP server configuration for email invites.

Thanks in advance :-)
**Baikal version**: 0.46

You cannot enable sharing on Calendar (Mac) if the user is a generic name as
[ /html/dav.php/principals/user/](url)

The error will be resolved if it is an email:
[ /html/dav.php/principals/user@domain.it/](url)

The setup is exactly the same.

I think it's a problem with Calendar:

- does anyone experience the same issue?
- might it be useful to suggest the use of an e-email as a username?



Thank you,
Riccardo
Hi there, 
in version 0.6.1 cards will not be synced when they have an image attached. 
Tested with macOS 10.4, 10.5 and iOS 12 and 13.

Maybe someone can have a look at this issue or set a note for other users.

Thanks and cheers

**Problem you are having**:

**Suggested solution**:

How hard is the to add to Baikal?

http://sabre.io/dav/authentication/

**Baikal version**: 0.4.6

I used the file ``baikal-0.6.0.zip`` from the releases page.

- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates
- [ ] I have installed the release zip, not the source code zip
- [x] I have moved the whole, untouched `Specific` folder to the new installation

**Problem**:

While following the upgrade instructions, I go to: ``http://host/baikal/html/admin/``
There I see the raw directory content, and have to click on index.php.
It redirects me to ``/html/admin/install`` where I again click on index.php

Then I get to:
```
Baïkal upgrade wizard 
Upgrading Baïkal from version 0.4.6 to version 0.6.0
```
where I click on ``Start upgrade``.
That redirects me to another raw content dir: ``https://host/html/admin/install/upgradeConfirmed=true``

If I click index.php I go back to the wizard.
