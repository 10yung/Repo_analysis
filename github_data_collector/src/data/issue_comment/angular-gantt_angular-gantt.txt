> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Is 'mgcrea.ngStrap' necessary to move tasks in single row? One timke tasks are moving properly, but sometimes they aren't. What should i check? PS. readOnly attr is set to false :)
Hey Team,

AngularJS v1.3.20
angular-gantt v1.2.14 - Gantt chart component for AngularJS

I have implemented "gantt-dependencies" but to and from links are not populating properly.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30980942/66543649-9d934c80-eb53-11e9-90d3-7f9ee61f3f41.png)
dependencies plugin js and css files are in place. as its not throwing any error in dev tool so its bit difficult to trace whats going on wrong.
Any help would be appreciated :)
Hello.

I have registered event when clicking a Gantt task. It is working on Chrome, Brave and Safari, but it doesn't seem to trigger on Firefox. Is it a known bug (I can't find anything by searching issues).

```
      $scope.api.directives.on.new($scope, function(dName, dScope, dElement, dAttrs, dController) {
        console.log(dName);
        if (dName === 'ganttTask') {
          return dElement.bind('click', function(event) {

            if ($scope.currently_selected_task) {
              $scope.currently_selected_task.model.classes = '';
            }
            select_grid_line(dScope.task.model.id);
            return $timeout(function() {
              
              dScope.task.model.classes = 'custom-task';
              console.log(dScope.task.model);
              return $scope.currently_selected_task = dScope.task;
            });
          });
        }
      });
```
Hello, I am not able to display the sections. The width of the sections and margin-left always zero. I'd like to know if there is a way to get the width of the task because I'm trying to provide manually the position of each section.

for more: [my question on stack](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57993421/the-width-of-sections-in-angular-gantt)

Thank in advance.

For tasks that are only a day long, for instance, is it possible to display/overflow the name of the task so you do not need to use the popup or side menu to see it?
I have filter-row with "{'parent': $planPageController.search, 'data': $planPageController.search}" but it returns only rows that have parent AND data, not parent OR data.

How to do OR row filtering?
