Unable to generate registration challenge, error in transport layer (-2)

Recently released Linux 5.2 [supports](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=42337b9d4d958daae266dc455a54e3b9f157862a) using a U2F Zero as a hardware RNG device.
It is common for users to leave their U2F dongle always connected, especially desktop users.

As distros begin to push out 5.2 and users U2F Zeros start working as a HWRNGs will this result in decreased lifespan of the dongle? Can these microcontrolers handle constant use like that?
I often use the Altium Designer to design PCB,and don't familiar with the Kicad . Anyway, to learn how to use a new software would waste me a lot of time. @gregose @conorpp 
I've been tring to make the U2F-zero interact with U2F-host(https://github.com/Yubico/python-u2flib-host),but it doesn't work any more. The result is as following:

~$ u2f-register -i reg.json http://localhost:8081

Touch the U2F device you wish to register...

Unable to register with any U2F device.

Is it because the slots is full?? or else? It troubles me a lot.I would be very thankful if someone could help me out.
Request you to please create a detailed video of making of U2F.
Closes #92 
When the system has the python packages `hidapi` installed but not `hid` the error message produced states:
```
python hidapi module is required
try running:
     apt-get install libusb-1.0.0-dev libudev-dev
     pip install hidapi
```

This error message is misleading due to the fact that hidapi can be installed without hid.
Hi guys,

I'm looking to build a u2f zero for the first time. I'm buying components and I found that the CRCW0805100RFKEA seems to be out of stock everywhere - perhaps they've stopped selling this model? Either way, I'm looking to use the [Panasonic ERJ-6ENF1000V](https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/667-ERJ-6ENF1000V) - it seems to have very similar specs. :)

Also, here's some Mouser alternative links for the products you only list a Mouser link:

- Cree LED: https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/941-VBAFKACAEDH8B7A3
- Zener Diode: https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/757-DF5A56FUTE85LF
- Push button (was dead): https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/612-TL3305AF260QG

Hope this helps for updating the Parts list page!
Since the U2F Zero is completely free and open source, it is eligible for [certification by the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA)](http://certificate.oshwa.org/). Certification is free.
I've got a freshly installed (in a virtualbox) Ubuntu 18.04.1 64-bit, installed all prerequisites, then installed Simplicity Studio v3 without an issue, installed `EFM8/C8051 8-bit Products` etc etc how described [in the wiki](https://github.com/conorpp/u2f-zero/wiki/Building-a-U2F-Token), imported the project into workspace, and at the build step, here's what I have:
```

```
Just in case, I tried to exclude tests from build, but then it coredumps trying to compile another file.

Does building on Linux work for someone here? Any ideas what could be wrong?

If anyone has a virtualbox (or vmware) image with the working installation, that'd be awesome.
