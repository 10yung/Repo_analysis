**PC OS: Ubuntu 19.04**
**Android version: 8.1 (custom ROM: AEX)**

I get this error everytime I try to copy my phone clipboard to my PC's with `Ctrl + C` :
```

Any idea on what could be causing this issue ?
Had this happen for quite a while for me: when going back from an app all the way to the app drawer or home by middle click sometimes the last screen displayed stays on scrcpy. On the phone it works as expected, and clicks behave as intended so I can open another app without noticing. Normally I just click home a few times until it refreshes but I would like some help to debug this error.

Maybe lack of animations make so it doesn't refresh somehow? My phone has a clean, black home, all animations off, and runs Nova Launcher if it matters.

Much appreciated.
After upgrading nvidia driver to ` 440.48.02`, I got the following error
```
vimos@vimos-Z270MX-Gaming5 (base) ➜  ~ scrcpy

I would really like to know if there is a way to change window position, title, and size while the scrcpy already running (and/or connected to a device), and probably event listener based on console log.
For example:
console log output
```
event window-shown <x> <y> <width> <height> <is borderless>
event window-moved 90 90
event window-resized 800-600
event window-minimized
event window-maximized
event window-focused
event window-lost-focus
```
and console input during run time
```
--window-size 800 600
--window-position 0 0
--window-position auto
--window-title "Example Title"
--home
--back
--app-switch
--window-focus
--window-maximize
--window-minimize
--window-setborderless
--android get-battery-level
```
and probably some features that are executable while scrcpy already running
```
--fullscreen
--record "file.mp4"
```
Thank you.
hello. please!I want one  feature that looks like this: it can easily transfer files from mobile phones to computers.  And now,i can drag and drop files from PC to phone only, and only support partial formats such as.zip,.bmp,.png,.docx,.pdf...
On a note 9. when I'm connected USB, it's delayed a bit more than the standard 70-100ms. That's fine, would like it to be better, but when I swap to wireless, it's horrible. 10-20 second delay.


Hi,
First of all, thank you very much for developing this useful tool.
My team & I are currently using scrcpy for our project. However, yesterday, McAfee antivirus has detected a virus threat on one of our team member's PC, originating from scrcpy-noconsole.exe file. The threatname/domain is RDN/Generic.RP.

I'm currently using v1.10 on my PC & after this incident happened, I've ran antivirus scan onto the scrcpy folder & .zip file but my McAfee antivirus did not detect any abnormalities on the v1.10 version.

Do you know any possible cause of this issue and perhaps fix it?
Thank you very much!
I keep getting the following error every time I try to execute scrcpy:

[server] ERROR: The hardware encoder is not able to encode at the given definition.
[server] ERROR: Try with a lower definition:
[server] ERROR:     scrcpy -m 1024
Exit due to uncaughtException in main thread:
INFO: Initial texture: 1080x2336
WARN: Device disconnected
WARN: Could not terminate server
Press any key to continue...

After pressing enter, the entire thing closes.
Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks.
This problem already been mentioned in:
https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/issues/62

I just wanted to know if someone resolved it.

I'm currently using versions:
scrcpy 1.12.1

dependencies:
 - SDL 2.0.9
 - libavcodec 58.35.100
 - libavformat 58.20.100
 - libavutil 56.22.100

And still having this annoying issue. 

btw, I tried to look in the settings of the app for a screen security setting or something like it, but there isn't any.

Thanks.
看里边有java/c++/
用的是什么开发工具，是如何打包成scrcpy.exe的。
