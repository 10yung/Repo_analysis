I hope this can be implemented in MarkdownView, since it is rather common in most Markdown documents.

Use `wkwebview.loadFileURL(url, allowingReadAccessTo: url)` instead of `load(request)` to load local file url.
if I input some string like below:
```
hello



world
```
what I expect is 
```
hello

world
```
but the result from this library:
```
hello
world
```

I had try serval ways to resolve this, but all of  that did not work.
I installed MarkdownView with pod to my objective-c project. But I couldn't run it. Do you support objective-c projects?
Thanks..
Use of unresolved identifier 'height' for xcode 4.1
Hey Guys,

I have a problem with load image.
In the screenshot, we can see that the MarkdownView does not load the image, but the image exists on the folder.

Has anyone had the same problem as me? Could someone help me solve this bug, please?
