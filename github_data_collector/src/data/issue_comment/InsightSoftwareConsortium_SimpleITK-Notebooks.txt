Update notebook 22_Transforms to include the BSplineTransform construction using the `BSplineTransform (std::vector< Image > &coefficientImages, unsigned int order=3)` constructor. Also remember to emphasize that creation+initialization is either done with this constructor or with the `BSplineTransform (unsigned int dimensions, unsigned int order=3)` constructor followed by setting the transform domain and parameters, but not to mix the two approaches.
