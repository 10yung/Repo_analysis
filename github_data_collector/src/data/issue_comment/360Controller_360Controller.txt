### Type of Controller
Xbox One

### OS Version
macOS 10.15.2

### Driver Version
0.9.1 
1.0.0-alpha_5 
0.15 (beta 5) (from the google drive link in #701) 

### Connection Method

### Device Name and Info
Xbox ONE Pro Ex controller:

Product ID: 0x543a
Vendor ID: 0x24c6
Version: 1.01
Serial Number: 00002BCFE72AD10E
Speed: Up to 12 Mb/sec
Manufacturer: BDA
Location ID: 0x14400000 / 3
Current Available (mA): 500

Extra Operating Current (mA): 0

### Response of Controller
The small light near the Xbox button does not light up. 

### Response in Preference Pane
The controller does not appear in the preference pane. "No devices found" is the only scroll menu option.  

### Detailed Explanation of Issue
The first time I used this driver (with the same controller on a previous version of macOS, I think Mojave) I had the same problem. It was solved with the google drive link in #213, but since I upgraded OS (I think, this was a little while ago) that version doesn't work anymore. In #701, @FranticRain suggested running `sudo kextload file.kext` (replacing "file" with where the thing is" to see if there would be a Security & Privacy issue, but I don't receive any terminal output. Unfortunately I have neither another Xbox One controller nor an Xbox One to get a positive control on the hardware. Not sure what would have happened between macOS versions, but thanks in advance for any help you could offer!

### Detailed Explaination of Issue
I tried the following commands, but it didn't work.
`$ sudo kextcache --clear-staging`

`$ sudo kextutil /Library/Extensions/360Controller.kext

I also make sure the Security & Privacy section "Allows apps downloaded from anywhere" by typing this in the terminal:
`$ sudo spctl --master-disable`

`$ spctl -a -v --type install /Library/Extensions/360Controller.kext
/Library/Extensions/360Controller.kext: accepted

I also turn off the Firewire in the Security & Privacy section. But nothing works. Could you help? Thanks!

### Type of Controller

### Driver Version

### Connection Method

### Device Name and Info
"PC wireless gaming receiver" (3rd party receiver bought on Amazon)

### Response of Controller
Green circle is flashing slowly

### Response in Preference Pane
No device found

### Detailed Explaination of Issue
Hello,
A few weeks ago I bought a 3rd party wireless receiver to connect my 2 original Xbox 360 controllers to my Hackintosh.
When I plug in the receiver, the green light is on (continuously). 
Then I turn on my controllers, I press the little button to pair it with the receiver, then the lights on the controller make a circle turning.
Then I press the pairing button on the receiver, the green light is flashing.
Then the lights on the controller flashes 4 times quickly, then they flash more slowly and nothing happen, no controller is recognized, either with a wired or wireless connection.

Could you please help me getting my controllers working ?

Thank you very much in advance.

Best regards,

Alan

### Response of Controller
Guide button lights up briefly when first plugged in, no further response on pressing of any buttons.

### Response in Preference Pane
No response in preference pane.

### Detailed Explaination of Issue
I can't spot this controller already in Info.plist, so I think it simply needs to be added. Unfortunately, I can't seem to run an unsigned custom build myself on Mojave, I think partially because I can't run as early of an Xcode version as you requested. I'm hoping it might be easier for you to quickly paste this into Info.plist and whip up a quick signed package. If you can - thank you!

### Response of Controller
Guide button lights up (solid light), vibrates when connected

### Response in Preference Pane
Shows connected controller but no input detected

### Detailed Explaination of Issue
The controller was working fine, however then I updated the firmware for the controller (as I was having issues with bluetooth connection and thought this may resolve it) - since the firmware update no input is detected in games on macOS and no input is shown on Controller test. I have also tested using the 'Pretend to be an xbox 360 controller' and still no input is detected. Thanks in advance

### Device Name and Info
>Device Name: Rock Candy
<br/>Product ID: 0x011f

### Response of Controller
The guide button lights up once and does not light up again unless taken out and plugged back in. In other driver versions I've tested (alpha 2 and possibly 3), it continues to blink when plugged in.

### Response in Preference Pane
The controller does not appear at all. Simply says "No devices found"

### Detailed Explaination of Issue
I'm not sure how much more info to give, especially with the limited feedback the controller gives. I checked and unchecked the "Enable Driver" button, but it does not seem to make any difference. I hvae tested all alpha driver versions and cannot get the controller to show up. I have done it before a year ago, but I don't know why it isn't working anymore. I've uninstalled and installed each driver multiple times without much change. Please help. Thanks

### Response of Controller
Green ring lights up once then goes dark

### Response in Preference Pane
Device list says "No devices found"

### Detailed Explaination of Issue
I am unable to activate the driver. Here are the steps I took:
* Disable any potentially conflicting software, including Karabiner, BetterTouchTool, Alfred, etc.
* Reinstall driver (and restart the computer)
* Plug in controller
* Check "Enable driver" in the pref pane
* Click button switching view to "Security & Privacy"

Result: the button allowing me to allow the developer "Drew Mills" does not appear

Here's the output of `sudo kextutil /Library/Extensions/360Controller.kext`:

Is there some way I can use `kextutil` to accept the developer certificate, or are there logs I can view to find out why the button doesn't appear?
