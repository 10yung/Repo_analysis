### Issues

When running `StartedConversationCellTests` on the CI server, it crashes randomly and the tests can not pass.

### Causes

We were trying to test different cell appearances by changing a self user's role, which may affect the results of other tests since the clean up changed core data is missing. 

### Solutions

Instead of changing `selfUser`'s role, inject a `SwiftMockUser` and change its properties. 
Create a new `MockSystemMessage` which conforms `SystemMessageNewConversationProperties` and inject it to `ConversationMessageSectionController`

### Dependencies

Needs releases with:

- [ ] https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios-data-model/pull/863
WireDataModel in Module compiled with Swift 5.0.1 cannot be imported by the Swift 5.1.3 compiler issue my xcode version is 11.3 but all time this error arrived 
It would be nice to have app lock on all platform Wire supports, including iOS.

The following unlock methods could be available :

- Fingerprint
- PIN
- Pattern
- Passphrase

Thanks

### Issues

Permissions strings used for camera and microphone were not consistent between the post-install permissions alerts and our "custom" permissions alerts

### Solution

- Used the localised `NS...UsageDescription` from `InfoPlist.strings` instead of the strings defined in `Localizable.strings`
