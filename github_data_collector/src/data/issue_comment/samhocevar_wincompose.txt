Wincompose 0.9.4, Win10 x64 1809.
Right click on any item in Sequences window => Copy to clipboard => got an fatal error:

Running as administrator make no difference.
With the Compose key set to `Right Alt` and built-in sequences disabled, WinCompose 0.9.4 seems to ignore both the following from my user-defined sequences:
```
<Multi_key> <grave> ~Alt <e>:     U03B5 # SMALL EPSILON
<Multi_key> <grave> Alt <e>:      U03F5 # GREEK LUNATE EPSILON SYMBOL
```

Looking at the WinCompose parser regex, I'm not sure that it accepts modifiers at all:
https://github.com/samhocevar/wincompose/blob/e56522aa135a8d1622a61fd66a3235bc7a6bc130/src/sequences/SequenceTree.cs#L79

The exact grammar is described in more detail in [this `libx11` commit](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/commit/ddf3b09bb262d01b56fbaade421ac85b0e60a69f), which unfortunately hasn't made it to very many distros' man pages.

The corresponding parsing code in the ChromeOS ComposeKey extension is [here](https://github.com/google/extra-keyboards-for-chrome-os/blob/9b0d5591f9753ad66e3496259ed5ef80b0316070/composekey/background.js#L1270-L1305).
(You can see that we're also using regexes, but token-by-token rather than all in one go.)
Using Wincompose 0.9.4 on Windows 10 Pro 64b 1903:

Came here via [ticket #35](https://github.com/SamHocevar/wincompose/issues/35) since the described behaviour is similar to what I'm observing. But the ticket is quite old, closed and after all slightly different and it seems not to exist a current issue on this, so I open a new one.

My PC is usually continuously in operation, Wincompose autostarts with a reboot and runs smoothly. But every other 2~4 days (no excact timekeeping), Wincompose just ceases to operate and the icon disappears from the system tray. It is no problem to restart via start menu …

… which also brings back the icon to the systrem tray:

Everything then works again, but this behaviour ist quite annoying. Is this known and under investigation?

I also noticed that when restarting from start menu as described the UAC dialog doesn't announce Wincompose but the configuration tool for task scheduler:

Does that give hints?

Using 0.9.4 almost without major problems, but this version introduced a strange error never seen in previous ones.

When I use WinCompose after a long hiatus, like the first time in the morning, seems it messed up the received characters. Example: I push <compose> <`> <o> and instead of outputting ò as it should; it outputs `o“ From next time on it behaves normally.
Wish you happy festive days!

Hi,

the "_Restart_" button in options panel is tranlated by "_Réinitialiser_" which is a bad translation.
"_Réinitialiser_" means "set to default".
You can use "_Redémarrer_" instead.

Thanks !
Hi,
I just tried the option "Insert zero width spaces in Office applications".
After that, in Outllok, when I use Wincompose to write an [À], the system seems to react as if the right CTRL key (my compose key) was permanently pressed... which produces all the possible actions when using the CTRL key pressed (zoom with mouse wheel, text or file cuted instead of displaying an x...)

Checked: 
- yes, the remanente keys (sticky keys ?) are deactivated
- if I uncheck this option, Wincompose behaves correctly, even in Outlook

Thanks !

I'm using WinCompose 0.9.4 in Windows 10.0.18362.535, and since when I updated to this version sometimes it doesn't accept some combination; examples of not accepted combinations are:

`<Multi_key> <è> <è>	: "È"`
`<Multi_key> <equal> <Right> <Right>	: "⇒"`
`<Multi_key> <equal> <Right> <Up>	: "⇗"`
`<Multi_key> <question> <question>	: "[backtick]"`

last one should give a backtick; instead of those, I get:

è
[moves right]
[moves up and right]
?

I'm not sure how to replicate this: it's not from system start, or at least not always, it seems it happens after a while the PC is on; if I restart WinCompose, it works fine again.

Edit: It just happened again, nothing changed since I restarted it; it seems after a while it has issue, and restarting it solves them for a bit. I literally used WinCompose to do a backtick, wrote four character, tried again to do a backtick, and I got `?` instead.
I wanted to use the print key as the compose key since I rarely use it otherwise, except using CTRL+Print. If I configure Print to be the compose key I can't use CTRL+Print anymore. Normally CTRL+Print copies the whole screen to clipboard.
At the moment, the main groupings (like Favorites and Emojis) in the Sequence window is translated, but not the sub groupings that corresponds to the blocks in Unicode (like Arrows and Basic Latin).

I have by copying everything to the user defined sequences and turned off the other ones been able to translate the individual symbol descriptions in my own system. So this is the only thing left for Wincompose to be fully translated (for me anyway).
To input the ∈ symbol (U+2208) you can type <meta>in.
But the solutions for the negative symbol (U+2209) does not work:
- <meta>!in leads to ịn, since <meta>!i is already matched with the letter ị with dot
- the other two solutions require a ∈ key, which I don't have
