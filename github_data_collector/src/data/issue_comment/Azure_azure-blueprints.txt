Given the fact that a large blueprint requires a very long list of parameters in blueprint.json. Would it be ideal to have each artifact a blueprint file so we could manage easier? I think that could be technically done by refactoring/extending the current Az.Blueprint module?
I look into Azure Blueprint module (**ResourceGroupDefinition** class) and not sure why it allows max length 90 only.

```
"virtualMachineResourceGroup": {
    "name": "[concat(parameters('ags_projectCode'), '-', parameters('ags_projectStage'), '-vm', '-rg')]",
    "location": "[parameters('ags_resourceGroupLocation')]",
    "metadata": {
        "displayName": "Virtual Machine resource group"
    }
}
````

It should of allowed longer to satisfy complex naming convention. To fix the above issue I had to cut the total string length of `name` 's value. Replacing params with prefix `ags` by `g` as follows passed the validation

```
"virtualMachineResourceGroup": {
    "name": "[concat(parameters('g_projectCode'), '-', parameters('g_projectStage'), '-vm', '-rg')]",
    "location": "[parameters('ags_resourceGroupLocation')]",
    "metadata": {
        "displayName": "Virtual Machine resource group"
    }
}
```
There are things here that should be reorganized https://github.com/Azure/azure-blueprints/tree/master/samples/001-builtins

As far as my understanding (after digging into Az.Blueprint PowerShell code base), the Import Artifact really recursively read into **artifacts** folder. I'd recommend to reorganize to make it more clear to read.

I've written a bit about deploying ASC through Azure Blueprint https://azsec.azurewebsites.net/2019/12/30/deploy-azure-security-center-blueprint/ and shared template here https://github.com/azsec/azure-blueprints/tree/master/AzureSecurityCenter

Thanks for your effort making a stable Azure Blueprint @alex-frankel 
Current example uses system-assigned managed identity. We need another example using user-assigned.

Also should update the system-assigned example with the added roleAssignment resource to grant blueprint app owner rights.
