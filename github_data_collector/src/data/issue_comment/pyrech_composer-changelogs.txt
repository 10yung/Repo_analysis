Hey ðŸ‘‹ 

I've updated the dependencies to their latest available versions.

Theres two main bumps here:
- PHPUnit 4.x -> 7.5
- php-cs-fixer 1.x -> 2.x

I've tried to port as much of the cs fixer config over but I noticed that it's reordered the comparison operators in some places. I hope this is ok but let me know if you'd like anything changed.
I think, there is an option for "long" format change show. For example, getting changes info from version tags within `git tag`.

For example
```
laravel/framework updated from 5.6 to 5.7
Changes for laravel/framework
- Change1
- Change2
- [Populate this list from git tag details from {fromVersion} to {toVersion}
```

Maybe, this can not be enhancement to project. Let me know :+1: 
One thing I love about this plugin is the direct links to changelogs and diff when I run "composer update", this is what allow me to make sure what's going to be shipped with my application / what I can improve with those new packages updates.

But it's kind of tricky, slow and breaking stuffs sometimes to run "composer update" just to get the list of links / versions etc.

There is an **outdated** command in Composer which list all the installed packages and what versions you could upgrade with:

```shell
bash-4.3$ composer outdated

composer/ca-bundle                             1.0.8                                     1.1.0   Lets you find a path to the system CA bundle, and includes a fallback to the Mozil...
doctrine/doctrine-bundle                       1.6.13                                    1.8.1   Symfony DoctrineBundle
doctrine/doctrine-migrations-bundle            v1.2.1                                    v1.3.1  Symfony DoctrineMigrationsBundle
doctrine/orm                                   v2.5.11                                   v2.5.14 Object-Relational-Mapper for PHP
```

This is super useful but it miss the links with diff and changelog this plugin provides when doing an update!

Could this be possible to add?

This plugin will report a URL like this:

https://github.com/zendframework/zend-eventmanager/compare/3.0.0...3.0.1
where as the correct tags are:
https://github.com/zendframework/zend-eventmanager/compare/release-3.0.0...release-3.0.1
