kivy 2.0.0 for raspberry pi 3b.
python 3.7.3
cython 0.29.14

Hi,

i re-installed kivy 15 Jan, when running the 'hello world' test programme the following occured...

pi@raspberrypi:~/kivy $ python3 main.py
[INFO   ] [Logger      ] Record log in /home/pi/.kivy/logs/kivy_20-01-16_14.txt

i re-installed several times, ensured cython is update to etc, but the situation is still present. the usual issue is that i previously installed in December and this issue did not occur.

apologies if this is more of a support issue, however, i am located in china and as such cannot email to google accounts or use Discord. i tried both prior to writing this, however it does seem like a bug.

regards
Mark

### Description
Textinput
    keyboard_mode: 'managed' 

when keyboard is "manage",clicking inside the text input triggers the on_focus event (with true value), and disable the keyboard popup, like it should.
but when clicking outside the area , the on_fucus event doesn't get fired(with false value), although unfocus_on_touch is true.



### Code and Logs

maybe later ill add example code

### Description
Hi

I have installed kivy on Pycharm on Windows 10 and my interpreter is using pythonw.py. I can install and run the kivy_example with no problems.

However when I run: from kivy.app import App
in the console it returns the following error:
[ERROR  ] [Core        ] option --mode not recognized
Kivy Usage: pydevconsole.py [OPTION...]::

As stated I have changed the interpreter but the problem still persists.
Any suggestions?

### Code and Logs

```
from kivy.app import App
```
```
[INFO   ] Logger: Record log in C:\Users\*****\.kivy\logs\kivy_20-01-13_35.txt

[Python      ] 
[Kivy        ] 



### Versions

* Python: v3.5.2 (default, Oct  8 2019, 13:06:37)
* OS: Linux Mint 18.3
* Kivy: v1.11.1


### Description

On the computer keyboard, in the row of numbers above the letters, I press the 1 key. After clicking the focus (cursor) in the text field disappears.
I have had this error for about 4 years. During this time, I changed the keyboard, the Linux version, the motherboard, the kivy version.  But the behaviour remained the same.



### Code and Logs

added a couple of lines to the program to track button clicks:
```
class MyApp(App):
	def build(self):
		from kivy.base import EventLoop
		EventLoop.window.bind(on_keyboard=self.hook_keyboard)
        def hook_keyboard(self, window, key, *largs):
		print ('hook_keyboard ', key, largs)

```
Get the following:

`hook_keyboard  13 (30, None, ['numlock'])`


There is a big difference between how

RstDocument:
    base_font_size: sp(15)

is rendered on my Android phone and in PyCharm on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS with GNOME 3.28.2.

On Ubuntu, the letters on that RST-document are much smaller than on the other, where I do NOT specify any base_font_size.
But on Android the letters on that RST-document are much bigger than on the other, where I do NOT specify any base_font_size.

In the RST-document where I do NOT specify any base_font_size the font size seems to be 15sp on both Android and Ubuntu. 

I have created a small demo, attached, that shows the bug in RST on a TabbedPanel:
I run/deploy it on my Android in Terminal with:
$ buildozer android debug deploy run
(Having the folder with the attached files as current of course.)
And I ran it in PyCharm under Ubuntu as mentioned earlier.

### Versions

* Python: 3.6
* OS: Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS with GNOME 3.28.2.

#
#[app]
#source.exclude_patterns = license,data/audio/*.wav,data/images/original/*
#

#    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#    Profiles
#
#    You can extend section / key with a profile
#    For example, you want to deploy a demo version of your application without
#    HD content. You could first change the title to add "(demo)" in the name
#    and extend the excluded directories to remove the HD content.
#
#[app@demo]
#title = My Application (demo)
#
#[app:source.exclude_patterns@demo]
#images/hd/*
#
#    Then, invoke the command line with the "demo" profile:
#
#buildozer --profile demo android debug

```

And finally 'README.rst':

```
This is the 'Intro-1' RSTdocument
=================================

NOTE: PyInstaller does not extend PYTHONPATH (sys.path) with this directory
that contains bundled 3rd party libraries.

Some users complained that PyInstaller failed because their apps were using
too old versions of some libraries that PyInstaller uses too and that's why
extending sys.path was dropped.

All libraries are tweaked to be importable as::

    from PyInstaller.lib.LIB_NAME import xyz

In libraries replace imports like::

    from altgraph import y
    from modulegraph import z

with relative prefix::

    from ..altgraph import y
    from ..modulegraph import z


altgraph
----------

- add fixed version string to ./altgraph/__init__.py::

    # For PyInstaller/lib/ define the version here, since there is no
    # package-resource.
    __version__ = '0.13'


modulegraph
-----------

https://bitbucket.org/ronaldoussoren/modulegraph/downloads

- TODO Use official modulegraph version when following issue is resolved and pull request merged
  https://bitbucket.org/ronaldoussoren/modulegraph/issues/28/__main__-module-being-analyzed-for-wheel

- add fixed version string to ./modulegraph/__init__.py::

    # For PyInstaller/lib/ define the version here, since there is no
    # package-resource.
    __version__ = '0.13'

```

The issue take place when you tap on a TextInput and open the keyboard, then when you close the keyboard the Window.bind(on keyboard) is not catching android back button key anmore.

For instance with this example i open the second screen and tap on android back button to turn back to main screen. It works as expected but whenever i tap on TextInput on the second screen the back button loses it's functionality for turning back to main screen,  it seems keyboard blocks the keyboard listener to catch android back button key and makes back button unresponsive.

* Kivy installation method: git clone && pip install --editable in virtualenv

### Description
when BorderImage's `display_size` option is used, it overrides the `auto_scale` parameter, simply because it first computes the value `auto_scale` would need, and then look if there is a `dispaly_border` setting, and overrides the values if that's the case, i think it would be better to do things in the opposite direction.

### Code and Logs

here is an example demonstrating the problem in a variety of configurations, just use the slider to select a small value of width or height, and you'll see that the setting for auto_scale doesn't work when display_size is used.
