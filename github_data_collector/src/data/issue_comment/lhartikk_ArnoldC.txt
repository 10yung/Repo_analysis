Is there a way to read the values of the command line arguments? 
I. e. if i call my script like this `java javaclass arg1 arg2`
I didn't find anything in the wiki.
I changed the build.sbt and project/build.properties file so you can build it. The library dependencies could not be resolved and the build.properties file is needed so you can import it to IntelliJ.
Reading multiple values from stdin seems to fail, with a `NoSuchElementException` from the Scanner. 

[See example here](https://tio.run/##tdCxrsIwDAXQPV9xN2YYuhvqRyJIArHzqo4IRgQSE/364rIwACNjrk@uJR9ul@v5dBzHoDOB@NxpiOyc5x4rX4JoJIEWZtxdnyuEFVVQd2ia5qMbPrm1PS0uIDGWEamINbYZQZFy5wI6SjqNSDYTBWFZ08oj/2FfWTTkJKDU4kU9/TPUc7RcOi5swxi5DaS87b9sHX69VWm7mZwRs/b1/h4N7nmlZ9WSOUG5xJCsoXXjOHcL9wA "ArnoldC â€“ Try It Online")

This program works if called by reading input directly from the user, but fails with multiple values piped in from a file or other program.
Earlier I wrote this [little](https://github.com/tgorgics/playground/tree/master/Fibonacci-ArnoldC) program that prints a couple of Fibonacci-numbers. This was my first (and only) experience with this funny programming language. I would really appreciate some thoughts or comments on it.
There was a small typing mistake: `getFilName`
