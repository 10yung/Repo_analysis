in my code this is my docsPath `def docsPath = "project-docs-api"` when i try to use `def docsPath = "project/docs/api"` swagger cannot found the json

what i'm doing wrong?

Currently, it is not possible to easily extend service and builder classes with custom functionality. For instance, I have a need to provide extra `ApiListing`s created directly or from a different source model. This little adjustment will make this possible with minimum effort.

FWIW - Here is a version based on rleibman's PR #62 that provides initial swagger 2.0 support.

swagger-core 1.5.4
swagger spec 2.0
based on spray (not akka-http)

I have configured swagger core 1.5 which produces swagger 2.0 definition files. I want to remove the definitions part from the swagger specification. Here is the swagger.json file.

{
  "swagger": "2.0",
  "info": { },
  "paths": { },
  "definitions": {
       "type": "object"
  }
}

I'm pleased if I would hear or discuss how spray-swagger would support/migrate to swagger-core 1.5??
I understand swagger-core 1.5 did make [many changes](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/releases/tag/v1.5.0), e.g. package structures and more flexible module structures which separates each responsibilities clearly, etc. And moreover, swagger-core 1.5 ships many enhancements(better generics support, auto subtypes generation, etc.).

It also seems that scala support is now developing in [swagger-scala-module](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-scala-module) .

This was my first pass at getting everything to work with akka-http instead of spray-io. I have not even tested it in my own app, but it should be very close, as all the spray-swagger tests work. I didn't want to rename the project, but it would definitely be a consideration.

On the second pass through it (the second set of checkins) I moved the whole thing to use the latest version of swagger.

Enjoy.

P.S. I added sbt-eclipse to the plugins, because I use it, but feel free to remove it if you don't.

Hi there,

Spray is moving into maintenance mode. Will spray-swagger support Akka-HTTP going forward?

Kind regards,
Jacobus

I'm aware of this is automatically translated as a setter and "is" is trimmed. What if I really need a property start with "is"?

Would you consider releasing a version against shapeless 2.0.0 similar to `"io.spray" %% "spray-routing-shapeless2" % "1.3.2"`?
