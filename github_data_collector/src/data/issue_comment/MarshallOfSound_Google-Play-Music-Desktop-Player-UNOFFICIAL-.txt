**OS:**

macOS 10.15.1

**GPMDP Version:**

4.7.1

**Issue Descriptions:**

The touch bar media keys work great to control GPMDP, but if I'm watching Youtube in Chrome, for example, and GPMDP is paused in the background, GPMDP will intercept the key and start playing, instead of pausing Youtube

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Start GPMDP, play a song, then pause
2. Start a Youtube video in Chrome
3. Hit the "play/pause" media key (in my case, from the touchbar)
4. Notice that GPMDP starts playing
This reworks the Slack status integration to support multiple tokens/workspaces, and adds a new settings field `TextListFieldSettings` that uses MaterialUI to render an array of strings as individual entries, with a text field for adding new values at the bottom. Adding a new token will update the status for all Slack clients, while removing a token will only reset the status for that token.

I know this may be a minor issue, but thought it needed to be reported. The icon does not show up correctly in the Dock or in the Task Switcher. I've attached screenshots below. For the Task Switcher, here's a video since I can't take a screenshot: [https://3cd.co/OAuL46GW](https://3cd.co/OAuL46GW)

Hey I have a very very small request.  Can the Window Title have something identifiable in it so automation tools can pick this up reliably?  The class name is shared by too many programs to be useful and with the window title infinitely changing I can't find anything to target.  A small checkbox in options to enable this functionality would be great.

**OS:** Windows 10

**GPMDP Version:** 4.7.0 RC

**Issue Descriptions:**

On most screens, the main scrollbar disappears after a short while. It reappears sometimes when interacting with other UI elements, resizing the window, etc., but always disappears again after a moment. Hovering the right of the window (which would normally show a hidden scroll bar) does not work.

When the scrollbar is present, I'm able to use it, and it won't disappear as long as I'm using or hovering it. I'm always able to use the scrollwheel on my mouse to scroll.

In the following screenshots, I've marked with a dot about where my mouse was. In this first screenshot, I've interacted with the track list, which caused the scrollbar to show. I then hovered my mouse on it and took the screenshot.

In this second screenshot, I moved my mouse off the scrollbar for a few moments, and after it disappeared I hovered where it should be.

![2020-01-06 GPMDP 02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4512028/71847933-39255200-309c-11ea-9bd5-ba5833d6b361.png)

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Open GPMDP.
2. Notice that the scrollbar is visible on the main Google Play Music landing page.
3. Wait a short amount of time.
4. Notice that the scrollbar has disappeared.
I know I'm able to _switch_ between the full player and mini player, however having a customizable mini player **completely separate** to the main player would be awesome to have. It would be especially nice if instead of having it be a square how it currently is, it would be a wide rectangle like shown below.

This also makes for an appealing music display for streaming, which is what I currently use the standard application for. Having a completely separate mini player would also allow you to tab into it to change songs, and play lists, without the overlay shown on stream having a progress bar, or ratings appear over it. Providing users with the option to drag around and split up artist and album, resize, change fonts based on currently installed fonts, and adding more info like time progress, name of next song, what number the song is in the queue/playlist, or a visualizer.

Below is a picture of the full player, with what would usually show when trying to change a song on a region being captured.
