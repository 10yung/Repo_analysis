Thanks for the tool.
I have mac pro 2008 and installed mojave using http://osxdaily.com/2018/09/27/run-macos-mojave-unsupported-mac-dosdude-patch/

I have installed latest driver using the update tool and it installed 387.10.10.10.40.113
Now mac sees my zotac GT 710 graphics card

  Chipset Model:	NVIDIA GeForce GT 710
  Type:	GPU
  Bus:	PCIe
  Slot:	Slot-1
  PCIe Lane Width:	x8
  VRAM (Dynamic, Max):	1023 MB
  Vendor:	NVIDIA (0x10de)
  Device ID:	0x128b
  Revision ID:	0x00a1
  ROM Revision:	VBIOS 80.28.a6.00.10


The only issue is that whatever monitor I connect to it (VGA or DVI) it is not seen at all, I had to boot from ATI Radeon HD 2600 to view my monitor and If I removed the ATI and left the nvidia alone and reboot, mojava won't boot.

Any clues?

Thanks in advance.
Is there are way of fixing the problem where Nvidia-update.sh disables the DisplayPort audio. I did an update to 10.14.3 public beta recently and noticed that the built-in drivers support DisplayPort audio but as soon as I apply the Nvidia-update it breaks.

The NVIDIA Web Driver installed is 387.10.10.10.40.113
this download has been removed from NV website but has new Volta GPUs support..
I would love to test..
has new GV100Hal.kext
While it installed this version, the machine just restarted instantaneously.
After restarting I ran the nvidia-update again and it patched the driver. Then I restarted again. Seems to be fine now.

Running High Sierra 10.13.4 and originally had latest drivers but was buggy, used the bash command to downgrade to 378.10.10.10.25.106 and now screen is black. I double checked to make sure webdrivers is checked. Running on Mac Pro 5.1 w gtx 970
