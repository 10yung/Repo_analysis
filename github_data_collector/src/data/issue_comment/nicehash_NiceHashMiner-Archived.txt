So I login on my NiceHash account on my NiceHash Miner Legacy (latest version) and then it starts up, detects devices correctly but then during the SMA part it freezes and just closes.
The three Nvidia 1070 GPUs are seen by my NicaHash Legacy programme on Windows 10 
but only one of them is mining.
The log file shows all three GPUs Added but then disables two of them and the CPU. I have also noted that on one of the printouts. "Query Video Controllers" Win32 is mentioned but my Windows 10 is 64.
Can anyone help.

using defender , so i added the folder to exclusions 
tried with out defender on
went to firewall and allowed what ever was blocked 
it will do 3/4 and than it will quit 
any other ideas? 
I recently installed NiceHash Miner and all was going well but when I started it up it start my NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1060 is not supported/operational please make sure your drivers are up to date, I updated my drivers and tried again, and nothing still says the same thing.

Observed the mining rig started to encounter BSOD after updated to Nicehash Miner Legacy v1.9.0.10 when mining under Zhash algorithm and now, I've turned off Zhash and do mining under X16R then the rig will just work fine.

But seems the rig has better hashrate mining under Zhash, don't know it's possible for you to fix this bug? Below is my configuration for your reference.

Hardware Config
- Intel i5 6500
- 4GB DDR4 RAM Memory
- Nvidia 1060 3GB

Driver and Software Config
- Win10 Pro 64bit
- Nvidia 417.71-desktop-win10-64bit-international-whql
- Nichhash Miner Legacy v1.9.0.10
- MSI Afterburner 4.6.0 Beta 9
Receive a cordial greeting

NicheHash Miner Legacy 1.9.0.9 does not detect, the video card Gigabyte Radeon RX 580, would appreciate if you tell me how I can solve the problem.
Thank you very much for your attention!
