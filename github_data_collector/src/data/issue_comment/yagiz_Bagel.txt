@yagiz Is there anything any of us can do to help contribute and take some of the load off of your shoulders?
Wondering if there's a desire for URLs to be tappable in the JSON previewer. I have a PR open (https://github.com/yagiz/Bagel/pull/58) to format URLs better, and adding tappable links is something I can work on, if this is something that would be desirable to others.
Replaces escaped slashes in URLs (eg. `http:\/\/google.com`) with unescaped slashed (eg. `http://google.com`)
- Use Carthage

In the xcode project, the BagelRequestPacket.h and BagelRequestInfo.h had a `project` accessing scope. They are imported from public headers, so i considered to move them to `public` accessing scope. It will fix the framework import when it is built by carthage / xcode
Hello,

the Mac application is having issues handling larger JSON responses.
Is there anything that could be done to optimize, warn?
Set `ruby` for pod line. More description for `License` section.
Request `PATCH` not showing in current version Bagel. 
but, old version working good.
