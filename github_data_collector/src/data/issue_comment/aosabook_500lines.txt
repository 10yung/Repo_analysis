Formulas supported by the spreadsheet may be underlined in red as though they are invalid just because the browser does not recognise them as valid words. This is an option for removing the spellcheck from the spreadsheet by adding a hint to ignore it.

Hi: I have a [python project](https://github.com/neozhaoliang/gifmaze) that I think may fit in this repo. It builds an environment for running various maze animations from the bottom (in pure python, with only built-in modules). It can produce very nice GIF images. It's roughly 500 lines (the code can be trimmed to be less than 500 lines). Hope you could check it and give suggestions!
