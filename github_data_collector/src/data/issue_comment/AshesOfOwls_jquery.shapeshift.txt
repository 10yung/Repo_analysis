Can not get element selected during drag before drop??
I tried event ss-arranged, but it only gets the parent element of the selected element..  Is the library unable to do that?

I tried the code below, but it won't work when I drag the item from one box to another the first time. From the second time it works. Seems like it conflicts something with the library ?? 

  ```
  $(".item").draggable ({
            drag: function (event, ui) {
                console.log($(this));
            }
    });

```

Hi, I want to make container divs (4 of them on the page) collapsible panel, so I place a button and when I click it I want to hide/show the relative div. Problem is for now I have only 1 button on the first container on the page, when I click to hide the container all the containers on the page shrink.
How can I resolve this? Thanks
Sorry, I'm not very good at javascript, I'm using this plugin and I need to trigger a code behind when user drag items to one panel to another. Items are populated from db and basically I have to save the item state, question is: how can I get a reference to the involved item?
I have:

```
$(window).load(function () {
            $(".container").shapeshift({
                minColumns: 3
            }).on('ss-added', function (e, selected) {
                alert($(selected).index());
            });
        });//]]> 
```

This returns the item index whitin the container but I don't know how can I get the reference to the db record (rapresented by the dragged item). Any help? Thank you
Heya,

So I'm making a web application that implements shapeshift to a bunch of dynamically generated elements, each generated from their own plugin/library/code I've written, etc. Essentially, my system builds each element (which I'll call modules from here) to a certain div, and then I call shapeshift on that div. One library in particular that I'm implementing is [nipplejs.js](https://github.com/yoannmoinet/nipplejs). There's something interesting going on...

Essentially, for every nipple that is generated I have to specify the height and width of it's container (plus some padding so that when I unlock the page I can drag nipples around as well as other things). When nipplejs.js makes the nipple it appends it to a div that was pre-appended to the div where I'm building everything (and calling shapeshift on). This then modifies the "order" of everything so the nipples go first. Shapeshift is then, I think, reading the height/width of the nipple (which is first in the order of modules) and then using that to set the spacing for everything else. Here is a picture of what I am describing:

If I don't build the nipples, everything works fine:

Any thoughts?

Thanks in advance,

Hello ,
Ref URL : http://mcpants.github.io/jquery.shapeshift/#/mosaic

We are using code from above URL.It is works good but , problem is image size . We have different size images to fetch from folder and display those images. Drag & drop works fine but view is not proper , all images are overlapped to each other. here is our demo link .

When compiling inside a Rails project I get :

```
function Plugin(element1, options) {
        this.element = element1;
        this.options = $.extend({}, defaults, options);
        this.globals = {};
        this.$container = $(element);
        if (this.errorCheck()) {
          this.init();
        }
      }
```

and I always get an "element is not defined" error.
This awesome plugin doesn't have the feature of RTL. I'm working on RTL website but it is showing the grid in wrong order. I hope you'll add this feature in near future.

Hi!

ShapeShift fires "Can't read property 'replace'" error. Please take a look into this example.
