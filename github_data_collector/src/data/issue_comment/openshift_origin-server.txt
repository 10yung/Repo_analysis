Fixes Bug 1244126
We couldn't secure a websocket with basic auth. The authorization header is ignored on the node-proxy.


Sorry, if this is irrelevant place for this bug. 
http://www.winterofcode.com/ is a openshift competition link. When I try to fill the details and click on submit button. It land to Not Found Error page. Please, fix it.
when I run sh <(curl -s https://install.openshift.com/) it redirects to run sh <(curl -s https://install.openshift.com/origin-m4). This is in centos 7. But the issue is that if you curl https://install.openshift.com/origin-m4 there is an error that /origin-m4 is not found
I noticed that openshift [supports Node.js applications](https://developers.openshift.com/languages/nodejs/).
Unfortunately it states that it supports [nodejs-0.10](https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/5e9395b5661cb957e118b5dd9ffe632a102d19b2/cartridges/openshift-origin-cartridge-nodejs/metadata/manifest.yml) which is EOL.

For upgrading the [latest LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS) is Node 6.

 Thanks

Check https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/node/README.writing_cartridges.md

Please fix the link. BTW, I searched through the site and can't find it there.

In the Perl cartridge template, several links now redirect to a generic https://docs.openshift.org/latest/welcome/index.html:

http://openshift.github.io/documentation/oo_cartridge_guide.html#perl
http://openshift.github.io/documentation/oo_user_guide.html#action-hooks
http://openshift.github.io/documentation/oo_user_guide.html#the-openshift-directory
https://docs.openshift.org/origin-m4/oo_cartridge_guide.html#cron
https://docs.openshift.org/origin-m4/oo_cartridge_guide.html#markers-6
https://docs.openshift.org/origin-m4/oo_user_guide.html#using-cartridges

I assume the same/similar links are used elsewhere, so other cartridges (or repositories) may be affected as well.
