I want to change all of the tabs if a user is logged in / made an in app purchase etc.

I created a new rootFragmentProvider and multipleStackNavigator for this purpose, however there should be an option for clearing/removing all of the old fragments. Without this feature, the old ones are still visible after the tab items' change.

The method is not called if there is no change in the first navigation fragment, so if the user does not perform any action that changes the first of the initial fragments, the method is not called, for example not executing the scrolling action until top if necessary.
Commiting with allowing state loss not a proper option every time. So medusa should provide an option to developers committing transactions without allowing satete loss.
Fragment stack is always complicated. This library aims that moves that complication to our Medusa library instead of your codebase. So which means we still need to debugging in Medusa library.

Logging is the perfect way to debug fragment stack. So we really need to create a logging module for Medusa library. 

Logger needs to show current fragment stack state on every start/goBack action.
