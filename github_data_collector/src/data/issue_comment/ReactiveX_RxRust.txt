.. or is it looking for a new maintainer?

Hey there, is there any chance that this library will be compilable with the current rust compiler any time soon? :) Seems to be more than just fixing the errors occurring due to the new rust syntax :/ (which is a little bit out of scope for me as a rust beginner).
Thank you in advance!

How could we shape an Rx like solution in the [Rust Programming Language](http://www.rust-lang.org/)?

Would it be as simple as?

``` rust
struct Observable {

}

impl Observable {
  fn subscribe<T>(&self, observer: Observer) { 
    ...
  }
}
```

And then how would it look like if we used it?  Could we support chaining?
