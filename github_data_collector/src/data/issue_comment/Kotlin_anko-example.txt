Upgraded gradle wrapper to 4.6, android target to 28, anko to 1.10.7, android plugin to 3.2.1, and fixed associated dependency versions. Also renamed 'compile' to 'implementation' in app build.gradle.

Note appcompat-v7 version 28.0.3 isn't available yet, so left it as 28.0.0.

Also, ApplicationTest.java should be removed.

    private fun init() = AnkoContext.createDelegate(this).apply {
    gravity = CENTER

I need add var gravity,why?

Thanks for your example.
If my viewholder has a lot of views, how can i handle their reference.
