Hi! Thanks for your sharing. 
I'm trying to extract the pictures from the test file "/data/testset_SDR.mat" and convert them into .png format  but it turns out that the color of the result is not correct. Also, I tried to exchange the channels to avoid the BGR and RGB mistake but it didn't work.  
The following picture is one of my results.  
Can you share the structure of  datasets and give me some suggestions ?
Thanks!

Hi, @sooyekim 
I'm reading your paper 'JSI-GAN'. I have a question.
horizontal and vertical 1D filter produce like this:
```
horizontal 1D=(Conv◦RL◦RB^4◦Conv)(Xd)
```
I don't understand how to produce the horizontal and vertical 1D filter by two kinds of `conv layer` ? Can you explain that ?

Thanks!

Hi,there, could please share the original training image? So that I can process the image randomly to avoid overfiting problem.
Hey @sooyekim, 

Nice work and thanks for sharing your code! I wonder if you can help me with visualizing intermediate feature maps as you did in your paper (Figure 8). 

Thanks!
Thanks for your awesome work.
How can I change the YUV output from BT.2020 range back to BT.709 range for displaying on my
