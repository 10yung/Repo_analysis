Xcode 7.3

Added support for extracting 3x assets, similar to how 2x assets are handled.
This also requires adding new launch screens so that iPhone 6 and 6 Plus run
in their native resolutions instead of the scaled iPhone 5 resolution. Without
that, iPhone 6 Plus reports itself as having 2x screen scale instead of 3x.

Tested by running the code on the iPhone 6 Plus simulator. Extracted assets
were named with the "@3x.png" suffix.

Fixes #27

I might be mistaken, but I think the iPhone 6 plus simulator has @3x icons. 

Is there a way to get these?

Also added (blank) Launch Images for iPhone 6/6+

Trying to extract iOS 8 assets. Doesn't quite work.

Takes too long to start and crashes sometimes.

Tapping on the detail disclosure button in the IPA tab shows the app's Info.plist.

When exporting emoji using iPad Simulator on iOS 6, images are corrupted or cut on top.
For example, `Nature/Bear Face.png` and `Nature/Bear Face@2x.png` are corrupted, while `Nature/Earth Globe Europe-Africa.png` and `Nature/Earth Globe Europe-Africa@2x.png` are cut on top.

This is a cool project but does the HIG even allow devs to use apple's images in their apps?
