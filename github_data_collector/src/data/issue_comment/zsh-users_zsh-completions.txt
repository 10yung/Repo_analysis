This follows up on the changes in [cmake 3.16](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/release/3.16.html). Of what seemed to be relevant to the commandline in the release notes, I skipped `CMAKE_CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS` and `CMAKE_ECLIPSE_RESOURCE_ENCODING` as I am not confident about how they are intended how to be used / what the possible useful values would be.

It may be a nice idea to provide a completions for [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).
zsh compinit: insecure files, run compaudit for list.
Ignore insecure files and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]? y%


Execute the compaudit command to get the following file path：

here are insecure files:
/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_brew_services
/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_carthage



How can I solve it?   thank！
I've found one other interesting command that's lacking any completion `mc` – the Midnight Commander. The completion is of good quality, it covers all the options and also completes directories for the panes.

Is there a way to globally exclude a path from all completions?

When `cd`ing into the `/keybase` path hierarchy I get multiple permission denied errors because completion (I think) is trying to scan potential folders as I type.

The `/keybase` path is where Keybase's KBFS is mounted, which allows you access to any user's public files, plus private team files etc.

Thank you for writing this, it makes my command line so much better! 
`yarn add localpath` cannot completion absolute path in filesystem
The node autocompletion restricts to *.js files which works well for the general use case, but when processing a profile log with `--prof-process` it becomes difficult to complete the *.log files generated by `--prof`.

I'm not sure if the completion system can handle it, but it would be nice if it would switch to completing *.log files when the `--prof-process` flag is passed.
