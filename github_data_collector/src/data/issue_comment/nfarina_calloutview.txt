## Description
Added padding to subtitleView container height.
Tittle says it all. I am wondering if I can set up a touch event using TapGestureRecognize on the calloutview or if there is any other method which has the same results.

Cheers.
Hey there,

I am wanting to increase the height of the view and display a multi line subtitle. 
Is this is supported?
First off, great component. I was able to figure out how to change the contentView's background by adding a custom view. However, the background around the contentView along with the arrow, is there an example on how to change that? Doing something like this, I lose the arrow:

`SMCalloutBackgroundView *test12 = [[SMCalloutBackgroundView alloc] init];`
` test12.layer.cornerRadius = 10;`
` [test12 setBackgroundColor:[UIColor redColor]];`
`[self.calloutView setBackgroundView:test12];`

I have been getting some crash reports that show the following:

``` obj-c
Fatal Exception: CALayerInvalidGeometry
CALayer position contains NaN: [nan -48.5]
```

Is there a reason it would be returning `NaN`? And is there a way I can detect this?

```
- (void)animationDidStop:(CAAnimation *)anim finished:(BOOL)finished {
    BOOL presenting = [[anim valueForKey:@"presenting"] boolValue];

    if (presenting && finished) {
        if ([_delegate respondsToSelector:@selector(calloutViewDidAppear:)])
            [_delegate calloutViewDidAppear:(id)self];
    }
    else if (!presenting && finished) {

        [self removeFromParent];
        [self.layer removeAnimationForKey:@"dismiss"];

        if ([_delegate respondsToSelector:@selector(calloutViewDidDisappear:)])
            [_delegate calloutViewDidDisappear:(id)self];
    }
}
```

This delegate callback checks for finished, I don't think it should. Our use case is we are changing the callout visible on the map when the map isn't the frontmost view on the screen, when this happens iOS is optimizing the animation and calling this delegate with finished `NO`. This means the previous callout is never removed from the parent and will intercept any subsequent touches.

Hi Nick Farina,
Thank you for this lovely project. I need to ask if we can use this CalloutView with Mapbox ? 
For latest Mapbox SDK when i tried adding SMCalloutView , it gives the linking error as duplicate symbols for various times.
And when I tried older Mapbox SDK it gave me RMAnnotation.h file missing error. 

Another question is how can we increase height of the calloutview ? 

I want to thank you for developing this nice replicate of UICalloutView. I used these library 3 years ago for [iGolestan](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/igolestan/id796171602) app.

now I'm using again for another app. I have designed a custom content view and layout the subviews with auto layout. subviews are some UILabels which can shrink or grow based on their text length.
 here is the final result I achieved:
![smcalloutview with autolayout](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3206748/11164803/72814d78-8b10-11e5-8dde-391887bfd512.jpg)

but problem is here `SMCalloutView` initially needs contentView frame, but autolayouted contentView initially doesn't have any frame! until `[self layoutIfNeeded]` gets called! so I move'd =>

``` objective-c
// layout now so we can immediately start animating to the final position if needed
    [self setNeedsLayout];
    [self layoutIfNeeded];
```

 before 

``` objective-c
// size the callout to fit the width constraint as best as possible
    self.frameSize = [self sizeThatFits:CGSizeMake(constrainedRect.size.width, self.calloutHeight)];
```

as you see in the below gif, initially SMCalloutView doesn't correctly show callout, display bottom arrow at top.  but after that callout appears correctly.

do you have any idea how can I fix that?

Strangest thing: when I start a session on my iPhone 6 using a MapBox map, and SMCallouts, all annotations are very responsive as expected. However, as the session goes on,  the delegate still reads out a annotation gets touched but the callout takes longer and longer to appear. This problem started surfacing around my update to iOS9, so it might be related.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts as it is driving me crazy! Thanks!
