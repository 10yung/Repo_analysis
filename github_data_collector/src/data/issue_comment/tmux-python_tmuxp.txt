### Step 1: Provide a summary of your problem
I want to execute some commands (with the `shell_command_before` option of my tmuxp file) but without those commands being shown on my shell.

The best thing that I could do was to put a `clear` command as the last, but the screen still blinks with my commands for some seconds.

### Step 2: Provide tmuxp details
- Python Version 3.8.0
- Tmux version 3.0a
- Tmuxp version 1.5.4

### Step 3: Describe your environment
  * Architecture: Arch
  * OS version: Manjaro Architect

### Step 4: Describe the problem:
#### Steps to reproduce:
Create the following tmuxp file:

~~~yaml
session_name: sample
windows:
- window_name: main
  layout: tiled
  shell_command_before:
    - cd ~/
    - echo "ok"
    - clear
~~~

Them, load that tmuxp file

#### Observed Results:
You will notice that you can see, on the top, the commands on `shell_command_before`

#### Expected Results:
I would want to have a option that run those commands silently
Currently, if you attempt to freeze and save the config to an existing file, then you are informed that you cannot do so, because the file already exists. I am willing to code and submit a pull request that would allow the `tmuxp freeze` command to overwrite the specified file. 

Does anyone see any problems with this, because I did not look anywhere else in the code except the function responsible for the command?

<blockquote>
<h1>Version 5.0.3 --- 2020-01-12</h1>
<ul>
<li>A performance improvement in 5.0.2 didn't work for test suites that changed directory before combining data, causing &quot;Couldn't use data file: no such table: meta&quot; errors (<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/916">issue 916</a>). This is now fixed.</li>
<li>Coverage could fail to run your program with some form of &quot;ModuleNotFound&quot; or &quot;ImportError&quot; trying to import from the current directory. This would happen if coverage had been packaged into a zip file (for example, on Windows), or was found indirectly (for example, by pyenv-virtualenv). A number of different scenarios were described in <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/862">issue 862</a> which is now fixed. Huge thanks to Agbonze O. Jeremiah for reporting it, and Alexander Waters and George-Cristian Bîrzan for protracted debugging sessions.</li>
<li>Added the &quot;premain&quot; debug option.</li>
<li>Added SQLite compile-time options to the &quot;debug sys&quot; output.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Version 5.0.2 --- 2020-01-05</h1>
<ul>
<li>Programs that used multiprocessing and changed directories would fail under coverage. This is now fixed (<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/890">issue 890</a>). A side effect is that debug information about the config files read now shows absolute paths to the files.</li>
<li>When running programs as modules (<code>coverage run -m</code>) with <code>--source</code>, some measured modules were imported before coverage starts. This resulted in unwanted warnings (&quot;Already imported a file that will be measured&quot;) and a reduction in coverage totals (<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/909">issue 909</a>). This is now fixed.</li>
<li>If no data was collected, an exception about &quot;No data to report&quot; could happen instead of a 0% report being created (<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/884">issue 884</a>). This is now fixed.</li>
<li>The handling of source files with non-encodable file names has changed. Previously, if a file name could not be encoded as UTF-8, an error occurred, as described in <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/891">issue 891</a>. Now, those files will not be measured, since their data would not be recordable.</li>
<li>A new warning (&quot;dynamic-conflict&quot;) is issued if two mechanisms are trying to change the dynamic context. Closes <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/901">issue 901</a>.</li>
<li><code>coverage run --debug=sys</code> would fail with an AttributeError. This is now fixed (<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/907">issue 907</a>).</li>

Can tmuxp pass flags to a new session? (IIRC tmuxinator has something like that)
If not it probably needs to be handled somewhere around where session_name" is handled.
Access [`Session`](https://libtmux.git-pull.com/en/latest/sessions.html), [`Window`](https://libtmux.git-pull.com/en/latest/windows.html) or [`Pane`](https://libtmux.git-pull.com/en/latest/panes.html) object being adjusted.

This would allow hook-like access to tmux session, window, and panes throughout the workspace builder lifecycle.

```yaml
plugins:
  - 'my_tmuxp_plugin.plugin.TmuxResurrect'
session_name: my session
windows:
- window_name: my window
  layout: tiled
  shell_command_before:
    - cd ~/                    # run as a first command in all panes
  panes:
    - echo pane
    - echo pane
```

Assume a git repo `my_tmuxp_plugin` with a directory `my_tmuxp_plugin` inside it, and a pypi package called `my_tmuxp_plugin`:

`my_tmuxp_plugin/plugin.py`:

```python
class TmuxResurrect:
    def before_workspace_builder(self, session):
        # On blank workspace, after session created, but before any windows/panes/commands entered

        # technically, it'd be possible to do any kind of subprocess call here as well

    def before_script(self, session):
        # access to libtmux session object in tmuxp load

   def reattach(self, session):
       # if session_name already live, before reattaching

   def on_window_create(self, window):
        if window.window_name == 'my window':

```
I was peeking through the tmux 3.0 changelogs and this entry caught my eye:
```
* Add support for percentage sizes for resize-pane ("-x 10%"). Also change
  split-window and join-pane -l to accept similar percentages and no longer
  document -p.
```
If that is what I think it is, it would be interesting to have support for such relative sizes in tmuxp.
Hopefully this isn't off topic here;
Does tmuxp provide an alternative to TPM/tmux-resurrect?
I'd like something where all the programs aren't written in bash, and tmux-resurrect + tmux-continuum has some problems.

tmuxp's --freeze option sounds good, but at least restoring scrollback, and at least maybe for bash, somehow having per-pane history files would be nice. (I managed to get this working relatively ok for the above plugins once....)

Is tmuxp / libtmux appropriate for attempting a better reimplementation of these?
Thanks!
How do I set window/pane names properly?

This
```
    - window-name: remote-host
      panes:
        - ssh remote-host
```
gives me a window called "ssh", which is completely useless if I have more than one - AND it kind of makes using tmuxp moot, since I have to to through all my windows and reset their names after starting my session...

Besides #86 _REALLY_ need to be fixed as well.

As of now I have this in my .tmux.conf:
`bind-key S command-prompt -p ssh "new-window -n %1 'ssh %1'"`
which make me able to use 'send-prefix S' to create a new window with a remote session to that remote host, AND the _name_ of that remote host, without a spawned shell to start with. When I logout from the host, the window dies.
I was really hoping that could be re-created with tmuxp.
