Hi Cameron, like many users, i am having limited consumers (fixed threads with each one having a consumer token) and en-queue can be called from any thread. The readme section noted that calling with token will have better throughput. Since my application needs to be very high performant (in Millions/Sec), i am thinking about making tokens to all the possible producers which may count from 10 to 50 tokens from 10 threads. So, to the straight question, does creating more producer tokens will perform better than without tokens?
Added cmake support.
Did not touch xcode/msvc since I dont have access to this.

gnu makefile - modified but did not try it out (will give it a shot - it should be good)

@mikeroe please review as well.

Added cmake support.  Tested on Ubuntu Linux (17.04) using gcc.  Any other non-Linux platform or compiler variation will need a tiny bit of work to get it going.

In addition, cmake script now has a 'make install' target (which the current make targets don't have). On my system, concurrentqueue.h and blockingconcurrentqueue.h are installed to a directory in /usr/local/include/moodycamel.
I use c++17 [if constexpr] stmt to reduce code size, and fix some MSVC warning in /std:c++latest mode.
