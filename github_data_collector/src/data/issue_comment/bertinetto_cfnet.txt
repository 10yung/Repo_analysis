Hi,

Your work is really great! 
I have some questions when I train the cfnet-conv2 network. In your code 'run_experiment_cfnet_conv2.m', the epoch is set to 100. But in your pretrained networks, the pretrained networks for cfnet-conv2 are called 'cfnet-conv2_e80.mat' and 'cfnet-conv2_gray_e40.mat'. I want to know how many epochs do you set when training the cfnet-conv2 network (color and gray).

Thank you very much!
Hope your reply!
Hi Luca. Thanks for your work!

I would like to fine tune your pre-trained Imagenet weights using my smallish video data. 

The object I need to track is not one of the classes in Imagenet. I used [this](https://github.com/www0wwwjs1/tensorflow-siamese-fc) implementation out of the box, it works fairly well, but I would like to improve the accuracy by training/tuning on my own data. I was wondering approximately how many new videos and frame pairs would I need to get good results. ?
Hi, thank you for your attention. An error occurred when I compile vl_complienn only though cpu. My system is intel i3-7350K, 1050ti, ubuntu16.04, Matlab 2016b, Gcc 4.9, cuda 9.0

Error using mex
/home/river/NewFolder/toolbox/matconvnet-1.0-beta25/matlab/mex/.build/vl_imreadjpeg.o：In function

Any suggestions will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Hi, is there any plans for releasing a Tensorflow or Pytorch based version of this codebase? 

thanks,

How do I run this tracker for my own data?
Hi bertinetto:
Thanks for your excellent work.  I have successfully run this tracking program. But I ran training program with trouble. The vl_imreadjpeg could not read image. The warnning information is like this: 'E:\code\tracking2018\cfnet0502\data\d\ILSVRC2015_train_01117000\000004.00.crop.x.jpg' because 'gdi+: InvalidParameter (orimage file does not exist)' .So could you tell me the problem?Or give me some hint?

I followed "Tracking only" 1~6 step.
and Matlab gave me this message "dist: 32.25 overlap: 60.94 fps: 32.0" when I ran 'run_cfnet1_evaluation' with 'tc_Airport_ce' dataset. 
I expected the result show me 'tracking scene' because this model is suited to object tracking, but just threw me above message. 
Originally, does this model throw 'distribution result, overlap (IoU), fps (frame per second) ??

Hi, Luca and Jack.
good work as always.
I run the **CFNet-conv2, CFNet-conv5**, **Baseline-conv5** on **OTB2013 OPE** by setting the hyperparameters according to  the table2 in the paper and find that the results are much worser(**the numbers after the "/" are the results shown in the paper**):

**1. Baseline-conv5:**
    **precision:0.779  /   0.806**
    **success:0.6  /  0.618**

**2. CFNet-conv2:**
    **precision:0.737  /   0.807**
    **success:0.561  /  0.611**

**3. CFNet-conv5:**
    **precision:0.723  /   0.803**
    **success:0.518  /  0.611**

Does anyone knows what may cause these results? I run the code on **Matlab2016a** by using **CUDA8.0** and **matconvnet-25**
Hello~
the video sequence is too large for me to download it form google drive , can any one tell me the official website to download it ?

thank you
