I have finished my magazine and is up on the app store. it is just an iPad version. Now I am trying to get a mobile version going. I was wondering if anyone has used muse and has a mobile version up and working with no problems.  I am having problems with the baker reading the mobile index page. There are two index pages, iPad version in a root folder and an mobile index in a folder labeled phone. I did manage to see it one time but it went haywire and started showing one of the magazine pages  as the index. Any help would be appreciated.

sorry if this is not a baker issue.

When i start the app the index.html is showing, and after that when i doble click the menu wont show. and the message on outout is:

2013-11-16 20:17:23.749 Baker-S[12040:70b]     Multi Tap TOGGLE STATUS BAR
2013-11-16 20:17:23.749 Baker-S[12040:70b] â€¢ Toggle status bar visibility

I'm using Xcode 5 and Baker 4.2

Hi there,

How to view the downloaded issues even after the publisher removed it from the shelf  ?

Any idea ?

Thank you

A client is wanting to find out how many people is reading which published publication?
And they also want to know if it's possible to find out how many people is reading what page on the different publication.
Is this possible or something I have to code on top my self? Just need the right direction on what library to use to implement... 

Thanks!!

Just our first try with Baker Framework and iOS.

Revista Dementia it's a literary magazine in Spanish, of monographic issues dedicated to a literary topic. We started with horror, and the next one will be about sci-fi.

Thanks to the community for the much we learned in the process of building our issue numer one, we want to improve a lot in the second.

With more interactivity, html/css animation and ideas!

Greetings :)

If and or when you guys come out with another update of the app, and we have it on the newsstand, will we have to redo the customization etc. of the app?

Has anyone tried to use the Foundation framework together with Baker? Looking for some pointers on how to best get started, what js is needed, etc.

Thanks,

Hi everyone,

A very strange problem it seems. I am using the Baker version that was released in the end of September with iOS7 support. The app got approved because the subscription works in sandbox mode, but when live it does not.

These things work:

*Single issue purchase and restore

These do not:

*1 year Auto-renewable Subscription (1 month free trial)
It subscribes just fine with the 'subscribed successfully' message. But it does not unlock any issues. Restore asks for login and shows the 'processing' for a moment and then goes away. Still no unlocked issues.

I will post all the factors that I think might be important here, maybe you guys can see if I did something wrong:

iTunes:

Issue ID in manage Newsstand: com.tutumuchmedia.heman_1
Subscription Product ID: com.tutumuchmedia.heman.sub.oneyear (cleared for sale)
Shared secret is correct, no invisible spaces.

Magrocket:

Development Mode? False
issue security: false
Issue product ID: com.tutumuchmedia.heman_1
Date: 2013-08-27 17:48:31
Receipts and subscription records get created.
I skipped using the .htaccess file because I could not get it to work with my website provider.

XCode

Localizable Strings

```
// Subscriptions

// (These are just examples: you'll need to provide your own product IDs and names)

"com.tutumuchmedia.heman.sub.oneyear" = "1 Year Subscription";
```

Constants

```
// This constant identifies a free subscription.

// E.g. @"com.example.MyBook.subscription.free"

#define FREE_SUBSCRIPTION_PRODUCT_ID @""

// This constant identifies one or more auto-renewable subscriptions.

// E.g.:

// #define AUTO_RENEWABLE_SUBSCRIPTION_PRODUCT_IDS [NSArray arrayWithObjects: \

//     @"com.example.MyBook.subscription.3months", \

//     @"com.example.MyBook.subscription.6months", \

//     nil]

#define AUTO_RENEWABLE_SUBSCRIPTION_PRODUCT_IDS [NSArray arrayWithObjects: \

@"com.tutumuchmedia.heman.sub.oneyear", \

nil]
```
