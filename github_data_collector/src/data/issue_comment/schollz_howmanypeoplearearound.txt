Hi @schollz , first things first, thanks for making such a cool project. 

I was trying to use this on my mac osx. And here's what I did.

1. Connected to wifi
2. Ran
```sh
$ brew install wireshark
$ brew cask install wireshark-chmodbpf
$ sudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -z
```
3. Installed the pip package, and ran `howmanypeoplearearound`

I see a very big list of options

I'm not sure which one is my wifi adapter that supports monitor mode. Is there any way to figure that out?

Also, I tried to bruteforce and give it a shot with all the option but everytime the response after scanning is `Found no signals, are you sure en0 supports monitor mode?`

Can you please help if I'm missing any step?

This change adds a capture filter so that tshark only captures probe requests, ignoring all the other traffic that comes up when a wireless interface is listening in monitor mode.

It uses the following pcap capture filter: "type mgt subtype probe-req"
pcap-filter docs: https://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/pcap-filter.7.html

By using a pcap filter, there is less information in the temporary pcap file to parse. Hopefully this slightly optimizes the code.

PS. This is my first pull request! I hope it is helpful, but my sincerest apologies if this is irrelevant or unhelpful. Thanks again for sharing this project and your awesome documentation!

Would it be possible to add a flag so we do NOT store MAC addresses, and only see an aggregate count of devices at a given timestamp? The program is great, but as it stands, can not be used on public networks in Europe over GDPR compliancy :/
Create a docker image with all dependencies installed.
WiFi signals are also bent in specific ways by physical objects. Could we access the antenna directly and use something like OpenCV to count people nearby?
Is there a way to have the JSON output print names of devices that I manually input into a seperate file? 
For example, if I know that my android has a mac address of 1A:DC:5C:8E:15:7B, could I manually configure a file for the script to refer to so that while running it would associate 1A:DC:5C:8E:15:7B with "myandroid" and print out the name "myandroid" for me to quickly recognize rather than the mac address? 

Hi I am running linux and the program called howmanypeoplearearound seems to respond with:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/howmanypeoplearearound", line 11, in <module>
    load_entry_point('howmanypeoplearearound==0.4.0', 'console_scripts', 'howmanypeoplearearound')()

    import curses
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/curses/__init__.py", line 13, in <module>
    from _curses import *
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_curses'

Can anyone help me with this issue as I have tried to work around it with the response to the older version but that does not work either....
First, you may have no reason to support this environment.  If not, feel free to close and resolve.  I am testing it because I am curious only.  Thanks, -Pete

But I did want see the package and was able to run the install in the Spyder IDE using
>>>pip.main(['install', 'howmanypeoplearearound'])

Following was then run and output is not informative:
>>>import howmanypeoplearearound
>>>howmanypeoplearearound
Out[13]: <module 'howmanypeoplearearound' from 'C:\\Users\\Peter\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\howmanypeoplearearound\\__init__.py'>

So ***not*** getting the output I expected... per the doc for this module:
Using wlan1 adapter and scanning for 60 seconds...
[==================================================] 100%        0s left
There are about 3 people around.

Edit:  I should add.  The TShark module was not imported.  This may help explain the results.

Thanks


**On which version of Raspbian did you successfully install howmanypeoplearearound?**

On Raspbian Jessie - I was unable to get the proper permissions for tshark working AFTER a successful install.

On Raspbian Stretch - I am unable to successfully install with Docker OR pip.
The Docker command fails with: 'returned a non-zero code: 1'
The pip command is successful, but 'howmanypeoplearearound' is not found by bash when executing: i.e. 'howmanypeoplearearound: command not found'
