- Add Alert Loading
- Support DarkMode Alerts
SweetAlert.swift and example code update from swift 3.0 to 3.5 
For Swift 4.2 "'M_PI' is deprecated: Please use 'Double.pi' or '.pi' to get the value of correct type and avoid casting." And other syntax problems solved.

Changed syntax to swift 4.2

â€¦to Double.pi

Just updating the code to Swift 4.2
I have done two things 
**1:**  project is now in swift 4.0
**2:** Created TapOutside Feature
so we have to provide that whether we want to dismiss alert on tapping outside or not on every call 
**For example:**
` SweetAlert().showAlert("Here's a message!", EnabledOutsideTap: false)`
**or**
` SweetAlert().showAlert("Here's a message!", EnabledOutsideTap:true)`
/SweetAlert.swift:492:57: 'M_PI' is deprecated: Please use 'Double.pi' or '.pi' to get the value of correct type and avoid casting.

I am using this and i want to hide OK button from success alert. It should be dismiss by default after 3 seconds or user can set the time.
I didn't get the frame of Button. Please guide me.
