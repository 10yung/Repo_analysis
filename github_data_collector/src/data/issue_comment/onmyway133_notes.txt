>  Layout attributes <MyApp.LayoutAttributes: 0x7fb7a6611ab0> index path: (<NSIndexPath: 0xc75068054d0a36d7> {length = 2, path = 0 - 0}); frame = (0 0; 375 248); non-affine transform; zIndex = 1;  were received from the layout <MyApp.MyAppLayout: 0x7fb787fe84b0> but are not valid for the data source counts. Attributes will be ignored.

- There seems to be implicit animation with super.
- Return nil in both initialLayoutAttributesForAppearingDecorationElement 
 and finalLayoutAttributesForDisappearingDecorationElement
viewWillTransition coordinator.animate(alongsideTransition reports old insets

Use dispatch

```swift
override func viewWillTransition(to size: CGSize, with coordinator: UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator) {
    super.viewWillTransition(to: size, with: coordinator)
    coordinator.animate(alongsideTransition: { _ in
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            self.layout.invalidateLayout()
        }
    })
}
```

Problem with custom presentation, not system, is that coordinator.animate runs twice, and safeAreaInsets being reported with before and after values
