In iOS 13.2.2, the Setting app crashes when navigating back from a license page.

I am using LicencePlist v2.9.

As reported in [the other issue](https://github.com/mono0926/LicensePlist/issues/105), the Settings app also crashes on iOS 13.0, and does so immediately after selecting "Acknowledgements" (not after navigating back from a license). Remarkably, I don't have any issues on iOS 13.1 (also no popping and pushing when selecting a single library).

After playing around with the plist properties I found out that removing the Title property of the PSGroupSpecifier in the generated plist fixes the crash, but produces
[this behavior](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MrtbMm4GtirUIOhrf4VKW1L0PW1dVPg7).
I've seen this behavior within the acknowledgement section of other apps (p.e. Github and Asana).

My guess is this is caused by iOS, but it would be nice to avoid generating the title until Apple releases a fix.
`LicensePlist` produces line breaks inside text blocks. For example, the following text blocks have a `\n` at the end of every line. The line breaks between the text blocks are correct.

Is it possible to prevent this from happening? Because it creates a problem when using this output as input in an HTML page.
Let say I have a project that uses some open source swift libraries and other imported frameworks are not part of cocoapods and are not part of the `Podsfile`. Is it possible to:

1. To add the path of all the swift open source projects to the `license-plist` execution command? 
2.  Create a file with all the used non cocoapods open source libraries (e.g. Github code), frameworks and their licenses manually and then use the crated file as an additional input source when executing `license-plist`, so that those licenses also get included in the execution?

When using this plugin [cocoapods-pod-merge](https://github.com/grab/cocoapods-pod-merge) that groups pods to reduce the number of dynamic frameworks loaded on startup, the result in the plist is one new row for each group and their content just say "Merged Pods by cocoapods-pod-merge plugin", and so the reference to the grouped libraries and their licences is lost.
Now except CocoaPods and Carthage, we also have Mint for build-time libraries, just like LicensePlist itself. So how about adding support for Mintfile?


This is a great little tool, thanks for the effort.

I noticed the homebrew installation is via a tap, would you consider adding the formula to the main homebrew repository?

I assume they generally want the formulas added by the maintainer where possible, but otherwise, I can try and send a PR for that.

Or have you already considered that and decided it's not what you want?
