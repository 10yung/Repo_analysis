Dear DavidMercier:
   Really thanks for your sharing the excellent Stabix toolbox for slip transfer analysis. I'am using the tool, but I found this tool is till now accessible for bcc, fcc and hcp. I want  to know if  we can compute the tetragonal phase with Stabix or you can give some suggestions.
 Thanks in advance.
Cheers,
Lee D.H

It seems that the legend (slip family) is not working with FCC metals. Please see the attached image.

_"Index in position 1 exceeds array bounds (must not exceed 2)._

_Error in interface_map_plotmap (line 499)_
_slip_color(ii,:), 'Linewidth', 5);_

_Error while evaluating UIControl Callback."_
A request to have forced transparent background of the figure when saving, this will particularly helpful to obtain slip system of crystals and later use with other EBSD images in powerpoint.

Nice implementation of the crystal shape plot in MTEX toolbox:
https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/files/doc/crystalShape_index.html

Could replace our visualization of crystals in STABiX reduced to cubic and hexagonal crystals...:
https://github.com/stabix/stabix/blob/master/crystallo/vis_lattice.m
https://github.com/stabix/stabix/blob/master/crystallo/vis_hex.m
https://github.com/stabix/stabix/blob/master/crystallo/vis_bcc.m
https://github.com/stabix/stabix/blob/master/crystallo/vis_fcc.m

But no plot of interstitial sites...
To change c/a ratio in MTEX
cS.extension(3) = 0.6135; % ca_ratio = 1.63 --> 1/1.63 = 0.6135
cS.habitus = 1;
cS = cS.update;
Problem to import .inp file (indenter geometry), when working directory is not correctly set into Abaqus.
Modification of current directory definition...
See following lines into an example python script (usually lines 1159-1167): 
# Loading of indenter geometry as an orphan mesh part with .inp file
import os
**CurrentDirectory = os.getcwd()**
IndenterGeom_model_name = modelName + '_Indenter.inp'
IndenterGeom_modelName = 'Indenter'
IndenterGeomFile = CurrentDirectory + '/' + IndenterGeom_model_name
mdb.ModelFromInputFile(name=IndenterGeom_modelName, inputFileName=IndenterGeomFile)
InstanceRoot = model_name.rootAssembly         
model_name.Part('indenter', mdb.models[IndenterGeom_modelName].parts['PART-1'])
See function https://github.com/stabix/stabix/blob/master/mtexFunctions/mtex_convert2TSLdata.m.
Plotting all GBs segments given from MTEX code can take a while.
Faster if Voronoi's tessellation (based on grains center) is used, but wrong definition of GBs segment... with following function : https://github.com/stabix/stabix/blob/master/microstructure_generation/neighbooring_edge_of_2cells.m
