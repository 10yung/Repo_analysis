If you have chosen in the Aurelia template setting "Icon type = Legacy" are no category images on index.
Currently shows my browser tool a path like these:
`url(/websiteaddress…/aurelia/../../../../../media/kunena/core/images/icons/folder_nonew.png)`
correct would be
`url(/websiteaddress/media/kunena/core/images/icons/folder_nonew.png)`

**Describe the bug**
I have, for some time, be unable to install any version of Kunena 5 (either 5.0 or 5.1) on any freshly-created J! 3._x_ website.  I am able to successfully install K! 4.0.12 on J! 3 and then update the website to K! 5.1.14 without problems.

It does not matter if I download the installation of K 5.1.14 from kunena.org or if I attempt to use the Install from Web feature in the Extension Manager.  The download works but, when the process tries to configure K, the configuration fails at the first stage.

I would have used the Kunena forum to ask the question but, because of the attitude by the K management team to ban my account, I am unable to do this.

I use the latest versions of J!, of Akeeba Backup and other fairly important third-party extensions (e.g. Admin Tools, JCE Editor, etc.) without problems.  My websites are J! 4-ready (i.e. using PHP 7.3).

While this is not an insurmountable problem (because I am able to install K! 4.0.12 successfully and then update to the latest K! 5.1 afterwards), it's a pain to have to do it that way.

AFAIK, my website meets all the technical requirements to install K (except for not having the option to use curl with PHP).

So, it's a mystery to me and not being able to access the K forum to ask for help does not help.
