This makes a separate issue out of what was mentioned [elsewhere](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/astronomy-notebooks/pull/12#issuecomment-33792581).

I am not able to rebuild the inline image output for both Interactive-3D-Earth-Satellites.ipynb and Interactive-3D-Solar-System.ipynb. For those two notebooks, all the inline images turn out as black rectangles. I do not have this problem with the other notebooks, suggesting some interaction with mayavi/vtk stuff. I am using Xubuntu 12.10 i386 in a virtual machine. The following web pages illustrate the issue.

The notebooks themselves are in the [jep-black-inline-images-issue](https://github.com/james-prior/astronomy-notebooks/tree/jep-black-inline-images-issue) branch.
