Any plans on implementing [Neovim's msgpack interface](https://neovim.io/doc/user/msgpack_rpc.html)? It would be quite interesting to have plugins that are compatible with both Rim and Neovim.

If you open a file which your user has read permission, but no write permission, and then try to save it (`:w`) rim exists with code 101 and no explanation.

I think rim should show a message to the user and should not exit when failing to write in file.

In the case of vim there's a line at the bottom that's "reserved" for showing warnings and erros, as well as the "vim prompt".
I think I'd be nice for rim to have this "message bar" as well.

What do you think?
