Cannot keep the scroll position of horizontal nested RecyclerView in DiscoverFragment when I navigate to "navigation_trending" then back to  DiscoverFragment
I'm not exactly sure how to reproduce it, but I've seen it happen multiple times. While I don't have a debug build of the app (it happened in at least both 0.3.2 and 0.3.3), this seems to be related:
```
2019-08-27 20:17:32.133 14618-14618/? I/PhenotypeExpConfig: refreshConfiguration() : Force = false : UpdateAvailable = false : Age = 144 minutes : MaxAge = 720 minutes
2019-08-27 20:17:32.133 14618-14618/? E/RecyclerView: Cannot scroll to position a LayoutManager set. Call setLayoutManager with a non-null argument.
2019-08-27 20:17:32.135 14618-14618/? I/AndroidIME: LatinIme.onDeactivate()
```

Basically, when it happens, the search results are never displayed, nor is the progress bar (which is displayed fine in aeroplane mode while fetching cached results, so it doesn't look like a network issue). The cross to remove whatever is currently typed is also missing. Going back to the main screen and re-opening the search works perfectly fine.

TBD
See the two screenshot bellow: the first one while the image is loading, the details RecylerView seems to be constrained to a way shorter width than it should be. It eventually animates to the correct width once the image loads, unless the image was already cached.
