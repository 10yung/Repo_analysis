I followed the installation upto installing venv. tried running the program with my images and the vgg16 file in cwd.

I installed tensorflow on my machine using `pip3 install tensorflow --user`

venv did not detect tensorflow, so I installed tensorflow with `pip install tensorflow` while in venv.

then I ran my command again.

I am getting this error involving patchmatch model, and I have no clue where to begin troubleshooting it.

I got all dependencies installed and I finally got some things to run, however I am getting an error when trying to run 2 really small images against each other with a raspberry pi 3 B+.  I'm guessing it doesn't have enough memory to do this or I'm missing something.

Hi, do you think it would be hard to implement deepflow/deepmatching to process multiple frames ? Let me know if it seems too difficult or not and I can have a look. I'm interested in making videos with it. 
hi when i run this code i got the following error:


f = h5py.File(weights_path)
for k in range(f.attrs['nb_layers']):
    if k >= len(model.layers):
        # we don't look at the last (fully-connected) layers in the savefile
        break
    g = f['layer_{}'.format(k)]
    weights = [g['param_{}'.format(p)] for p in range(g.attrs['nb_params'])]

    model.layers[k].set_weights(weights)
f.close()

ValueError: Layer weight shape (3, 3, 3, 64) not compatible with provided weight shape (64, 3, 3, 3)

i tried this code with both theano and tensorflow but got the same error i tried also 'convert_kernel' but didn't work also any help please?
I tried running an example and I am getting a ton of errors:

## e649ad1 Fix inconsistent Bash file names in README.md

The Bash file names appear in the latter part of "Installation" section
of the `README.md` file have to be in "kebab-case" (hyphen-separated
case) instead of "snake_case", in order for them to be consistent with
the actual file names in the `examples` directory.

### Message from the collaborator

Please review my commit and if necessary, rectify as appropriate.

Thank you!

This pull request is intended to fix issue #39 (ValueError: Layer weight shape (3, 3, 3, 64) not compatible with provided weight shape (64, 3, 3, 3) ) and to make the image-analogies package compatible with keras versions 2.0.0 and above.

I only made changes to the vgg16.py file.  

The newly added code does the following:
1. It checks if your version of keras is version '2.0.0' or above;
2. If your version of keras is version '2.0.0' or above, then it (1) converts each element x of the list 'weights' into a numpy array, (2) transposes each of those arrays, and (3) saves the list of transposed arrays back to the 'weights' list. 

            weights_T = [np.array(x).T for x in weights]
            weights = weights_T            

3. If your version of keras is version not '2.0.0' or above, the 'weights' list is left unchanged; the elements of 'weights' are left untransposed.

Transposing the weights is necessary for compatibility with keras is version '2.0.0' or above.

The code should still be compatible with earlier versions of keras before version '2.0.0'.
Hi,
 I'm getting the following error and not sure how to fix it. Thanks for any help.

My script fails if I run in Tensorflow mode (on the cpu) and define the --a-scale=2 parameter. Without this parameter I can run. also --a-scale=1 seems to work

```
My script looks like this:
KERAS_BACKEND='tensorflow' THEANO_FLAGS='device=cpu' make_image_analogy.py \
    images/$PREFIX-A.jpg images/$PREFIX-Ap.jpg \
    images/$PREFIX-B.jpg out/$PREFIX-h-$HEIGHT-scale-$SCALE/$PREFIX-mrf-$MRF_VAL-ana$
    --mrf-w=$MRF_VAL --patch-size=3 --height=$HEIGHT \
    --analogy-w=$ANALOGY_VAL  --a-scale=$4\
    --vgg-weights=$VGG_WEIGHTS --output-full

```
