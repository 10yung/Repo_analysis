We are working as a team and share our designs via Sketch Cloud with others. We are running into the problem that we often have to upload an entirely new version which receives a new generated link in the Sketch Cloud. 

After a little bit of research, the problem seems to be that Sketch writes some kind of identifier into the (binary) sketch file after the upload. This is used to identify the prototype on next update. It seems this identifier is not included in the JSON files that are committed to the repository and only available in the local .sketch file. Then, each time the local .sketch files is re-generated from the exploded JSON files, the identifier is lost and the version in the cloud cannot be updated.

When working as a team, this creates a lot of problems:
* New links have to be distributed
* Losing versions in Sketch Cloud
* Only one person can update (whoever published the last version and still has the same local file)

Do you think it is possible to include the identifier in the JSON files and correctly include it in the generated .sketch file?

I found this issue raised in the Abstract forum, describing the same issue. 

https://spectrum.chat/abstract/bugs/new-sketch-cloud-link-after-every-upload~f8e8b308-76e6-4e06-8c0a-676a34105946

Looks like they have no workaround either. One difference is that they also commit the .sketch files. This creates other problems though with merging etc., also causing to lose the identifier.

### Description
When I change between branches, a lot of times library can't sync with Sketch. This provokes that libraries doesn't appears in library panels, so, you can't use it.

### Version
Kactus: 0.3.25
Operating system: Mac OS X Catalina 10.15
Sketch 59 & 60

### Steps to Reproduce
Change to another branch
Go to Sketch Preferences > Libraries 
Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't works.

### Actual Behavior
Unable to load library appears.

## Description
When I change between branches, Kactus generate a commit with a lot of file changes. This commit disappears if you let Kactus loading more time, but will be fantastic If this commit doesn't appear.

I understand that this is happening because there is a gap when Github change files between branches and when you are in the "new" branch you still have files from another branch. 

## Version
* Kactus: 0.3.25
* Operating system: Mac OS X Catalina 10.15

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Change to another already created branch
2. Look in commit panel

### Expected Behavior
Change to another branch without seeing this commits

### Actual Behavior
A lot of new commits appears

**Please describe the problem you think should be solved**
All the libraries in Kactus have more size than outside of Kactus. Probably x3 more size than a normal sketch file.

**Do you have any potential solutions in mind?**
I solved this copying the sketch files to another path, then I open the sketch file and make some change (just I put a rectangle and delete it) and save the file. Then, the size of the libraries come back normal.

I've usually forgot write commit message in right time...

It would be nice to  show last commit time and write a commit message in Sketch app

In our company we are unable to access to Github repositories trough command line without setting a proxy. 

## Version
<!--
Place the version of Kactus you have installed **below** this comment. This is displayed under the 'About Kactus' menu item. If you are running from source, include the commit by running `git rev-parse HEAD` from the local repository.

## Steps to Reproduce
<!--
List the steps to reproduce your issue **below** this comment
ex,
1. `step 1`
2. `step 2`
3. `and so on…`
-->
1. Create an empty repository on Github
2. Open Kactus
3. Click on "Select Repository"
4. Cut & paste the repository url
5. Try to connect...
### Expected Behavior
<!-- What you expected to happen -->
I expect to connect correctly to my remote repository
### Actual Behavior
<!-- What actually happens -->
The system hang and after seconds stops with this error:

Cloning into '/Volumes/g08/02 - Documentazione di Progetto/2019/UX deliverable/Test/provakactus'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/charly71/provakactus.git/': Failed to connect to github.com port 443: Operation timed out


Assumption:
User 1 and User 2 aligned at same master version.
Button color Green;

User 1: Update button color to red
User 1: Commit and Push
User 2: Update button color to blue
User 2: Commit
User 2: Push -> "The repository has been updated since you last pulled. Try pulling before pushing"
User 2: Pull -> "Merge conflict found" -> click on "view conflict"

**-- Option A - Keep Ours (button from green to blue) -> BUG1**
User 2: Click on "Keep Ours" 
BUG 1: list of "Changed files" disappears so 0 Changed files found -> Even if the commit message is automatically populated "Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/Violamot/Git-test" it is not possible to do anything.

**-- Option B - Keep theirs (button from green to red) -> BUG2**
User 2: Click on "Keep theirs"
User 2: Commit Merge branch
User 2: Push
BUG 2: Remotely the button is okay, is red. But locally, in the local file of user 2, the button still blue. Kactus doesn't notice that there is a difference between remote and local file.
