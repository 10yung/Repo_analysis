I have no use for ratings myself and they're kinda polluting the rather clean TUI (in my case). can we disable/enable tags?

Also can we have global tags (album duration, album year [yyyy], track count, etc.) in the album string:

Of course, they should be optional too. I think this would look great in `musikcube`'s style.
**Preconditions:** musikcube 0.80, Windows 10 x64, 1600x900 screen resolution

1) Start musikcube
2) Maximize its window

**Expected result:** no border is shown
**Result:** black border is shown at the bottom part and the right part of the screen

**Additional info:**
Issue is presented in any version of Musikcube. I haven't used Musikcube on Windows for like 2-3 months, but I don't remember that Musikcube had such issue in the past. So I guess it is not Musikcube issue, it could appear somehow recently after some Windows updates or after my changes of settings in my system. It would be nice if someone could try to reproduce that issue on his PC.
Multiple projects have now come up for scrobbling without lastfm, such as libre.fm, and listenbrainz. Some of these projects even use the same api as audioscrobbler does, so implementation simply requires changing the api endpoint. It would be great to be able to configure which services to scrobble to, including multiple at the same time.

Hi, does musikcube support shuffling by album?  If not this issue is a feature request.
The scrobble is sent immediately to last.fm recent tracks after clicking to play a song, even if you don't actually listen to it. It is not shown that the song is scrobbling on last.fm either.
It would be great if it show that you are scrobbling now on last.fm while you play some music, as it happens while you do it on Spotify for example.
