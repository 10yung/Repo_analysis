If one of the segment titles is too long, then it is not showing complete text, is there any way we can overcome that or have an alternative to resolve it. For reference, I have attached a screenshot.

Any help would be appreciated.

Unable to increase height of segmented control, could anyone help me in this?
This will allow addTarget functions to detect when the segment selection is changed and thus make it more consistent with standard iOS UI elements.
