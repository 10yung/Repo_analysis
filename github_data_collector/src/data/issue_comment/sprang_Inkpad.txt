Build error: Method possibly missing a [super awakeFromNib] call

1. Override the parent class method
Project view implementation files contains awakeFromNib Method. 
Because of a versioning issue, this method compilation does not pass without overwriting the parent class.
add   [super awakeFromNib];
Request to have iPad Pro multitasking compatibility added (ie. have Inkpad run in one window while something else runs in another window).

Thanks

Hi

I do lots of vector animation in browsers and I have a habit of cleaning up my SVG docs and fully understanding what's going on in them. I'm considering using Inkpad in my workflow, but during my initial exploration I found the Inkpad namespace, which I can't find any documentation for.

Why is it there? What functionality is added with this? Throughout my doc I found "inkpad:layername" and "inkpad:mask" attributes, what are these?

It seems like I can safely remove these from the doc once they are in the web project, but I assume some functionality will be lost if I would open the SVG in Inkpad again.

A comment on Inkpad namespace would be very much appreciated!

Thanks,
Johan


Hello!
   Just one question. Could I open and compile this project in xCode v 8.2? I'm trying, but I find many errors. Am I doing anything wrong?
  Regards,
Please add copy and paste icons. For now the user can access them only from the menu,
but if the user is doing these operations allot, it's quite inefficient.

Having icons for all actions, and allowing the user to configure what it's default visible #162 would greatly increase the usability of the application.

Thank you.

Hi,

It would be very helpful to allow users to configure the visible icons/tools.

Thank you.

Hi,

Any plans adding user stencils support? (e.g. like OmniGraffle?)

The various users need very different shapes, but having an easy way to share this stuff would make Inkpad much more usable.

Thank you.
