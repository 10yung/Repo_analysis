Hi,

I am getting types being removed, stating they are unused, this is not my case.

for example

```
my-api — package.json (2 new typings added, 1 unused typings removed)
├─ + @types/redlock
├─ + @types/ioredis
└─ - @types/express (unused)
```

I installed @types/express manually and my code is using it for the Request Interface.

I am not required to install express as its another library that is exposing it and it has express in its own deps.

Could we  avoid removing types or put it under a argument... so maybe something like this

```
my-api — package.json (2 new typings added, 1 unused typings **found**)
├─ + @types/redlock
├─ + @types/ioredis
└─ - @types/express (unused)

**To remove unused typings please run typesync passing -u**
```

So we would need to run

```
npx typesync -u
```

to remove unused types.

What do you think ?


For instance, when I had a dependency of `"bcrypt": "^3.0.7"` - it gave me `"@types/bcrypt": "^10.0.28-alpha"` which is 3 years old. The latest version of `@types/bcrypt` is actually `3.0.0`.
This may already be possible with yarn, but it would be nice to be able to have typesync search for type packages to install before installing a requested package, so they all get installed at the same time.

Would seem that https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/481 is required for this on npm.

https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts#hook-scripts might also work?
