I was surprised to see that `qr` doesn't have a page yet! It's a great little utility for quickly generating temporary qr codes on the terminal.

Closes #3764.

Hi, @schneiderl! After joining as a collaborator in the repository, you have been regularly performing maintenance tasks.
Thank you for that!
According to COMMUNITY-ROLES.md, you've now met the thresholds to be effectively considered an active maintainer of the project (for example, 14 merged PRs on https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/commits/master?after=711a1c4afb5913d0bdcaf489210e4290cd369a9e+314 and https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/commits/master?after=711a1c4afb5913d0bdcaf489210e4290cd369a9e+349).
To publicly acknowledge that fact, we'd like to add you to the tldr-pages organization.

If you accept the invitation, we ask you to make your membership public, and (in case you don't already) start hanging out in our Gitter chat room.
You'll now be one of the public faces of the tldr-pages project.

How does that sound? Are you up for it?
The objective of this issue is to discuss a decision about the syntax of the token for the filenames in the examples written in the tldr-pages. As soon as there is a decision, I could mass change the discarded token to the chosen one.

In this case I address the `{{filename}}` and `{{file_name}}` token. To know the current situation I run the next script to know the current state in the English pages:

```bash
grep -o "{{file_name}}" pages/*/*.md && grep -o "{{file_name}}" pages/*/*.md | wc -l
```

For `{{filename}}` there are 170 results in English pages ([gist with the results](https://gist.github.com/ivanhercaz/8bea611aaa13713baddd4fe732d759c6#file-result_filename) and for `{{file_name}}` there are 18 results ([gist with the results](https://gist.github.com/ivanhercaz/8bea611aaa13713baddd4fe732d759c6#file-result_file_name).

**I prefer to use `{{filename}}`**, not because it is the token more used, but because, if I am not wrong, in English it is correct to use "filename" when we are talking about the name of the files in a computing context ([Wordreference definition](https://www.wordreference.com/definition/filename)).

What do you think about it?
Dear comrades, this is a riot! No, just a joke that I need to did. I hope you don't mind.

I would like to discuss about the emojis in commits messages. **Should we avoid its use?**

I ask about it because @mebeim ask me to not use emojis in commits messages in https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/3727#issuecomment-573670727 and then explained me his argues in https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/3727#issuecomment-573769537). The first thing I want to clarify is that it isn't about me or my commits. If most of us agree to not use, avoid it or using in a different way, I will do it without any problems. I usually use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) with [gitmoji-cli](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli) since a few time ago because I like the graphical way to summarize/categorize the commit. But this is something I know that not all projects use and it is easy to not use because the commit message is done with gitmoji-cli and not `git commit`.

To summarize the opiniones given by mebeim and @zdroid in #3727: The first one said the emoji don't add useful information and it is only rendered in specific environments, and the second one said it could be at the end of the commit message to not make the commit message harder to read.

I have been using until now, but as I said, I can stop to use. So, should we avoid/don't use emojis?

In 6a85525 I translated [`git-diff`](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/master/pages/common/git-diff.md), a page where are 9 examples for the command. Should we remove one of them? Maybe.. the fifth? I refer to the one dedicated to show just the filenames of the changed files:

```markdown
- Show only names of changed files since a given commit:
git diff --name-only {{commit}}
```
This issue is very relevant for me due I am translating all the `git` commands to Spanish (#3727), so I need to know if I should keep this in the Spanish translation or if we should change the English page to remove one and then commit another change removing it for the translation I did.

Thank you for reporting an issue! Please review the following notes before submitting it.

Most issues on this repo are requests for new commands. If it's the case, make sure to use the standard title ("page request: <command name>"), and include a link to a web page about the command, and if possible, to an existing source of example-style documentation.

If your issue is with a particular client of tldr, please raise the issue in the repo for that client. For example, if you are using the node client, you would report the issue here: https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-node-client/issues

If you have a general question or are not sure whether to open an issue, please feel free to ask in our Gitter channel: https://gitter.im/tldr-pages/tldr

Currently the project has its own [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/wiki). What's the use of it in the current state of project? It seems most of the pages are quite outdated there, although some of the pages aren't present in the repository itself.

I see two issues with the sole existence of the Wiki:
1. lack of review system (like the one we have for PRs)
2. duplication of information

What are your thoughts on this?

This PR is a work in progress with the purpose to translate to Spanish all the `git*` commands. There are 49 untranslated commands if I am not wrong, so if you think I should translate just a batch of 10 or 20 commands, warn me to keep in mind and stop to work in this PR when I reach the recommended limit for a batch in the PR.
