If I call `chunkc set ffm_bypass_modifier cmd` in my `.chunkwmrc`, then call `chunkc set ffm_bypass_modifier ctrl` from terminal (because I need to cmd-drag something, for example), the modifier does not change.
Added the ability to run rules on windows that are under a certain height and width constraint. For easier debugging, this merge also prints a windows's height and width when running the query `chuckc tiling::query --desktop windows`.

I don't expect this to be merged (as I hear there are plans for a full-fledged "query" language to help filter rules). Nonetheless, if someone else wants to use these changes temporarily until this feature is implemented, it's pretty easy to swap out the `tiling.so` file into your brew installation.
Totally missed the addition of this desktop flag!

Has anyone found a solution to Photoshop setting focus to another monitor when clicking on the canvas?

I have to turn off chunkwm every time I work in it.  This is Photoshop CC 2019.  I have a feeling this is due to a hodgepodge UI of theirs, even the OSX buttons don't show up in the frame so they must be doing something custom there.
Dragging a file from Finder onto Discord doesn't focus Discord.app (as it does when chunkwm is not running.)
I guess this is part bug report and part feature request. 

For some reason, certain applications handle their alpha values differently than the rest. E.g. Firefox is more opaque than other applications. I don't know whether this is a bug or not, but in any case, perhaps a useful addition would be a rule to set the value for `window_fade_inactive`? With that it would be easy to correct the alpha value for apps that for some reason render it differently.

And thank you for making `chunkwm`, it's such a solid wm!
If I make Safari full screen, everything is fine. 

Until I make a new window, ⌥⌘N or ⇧⌥⌘N and then i can't access the Safari url bar for some reason.
Problem:
`tiling::window --focus` can focus windows from different desktops while `tiling::window --warp` can't move them between desktops.

Is there some config option that I miss or this behaviour is simply not supported? This is the only thing I miss from i3wm.
Fixes #619

Also changed the case of Makefiles because that's how it should be for other software to find them.
So floating windows aren't staying on top which is can become rather tedious when I bump my mouse and my floating window loses focus. I disabled SIP and ran `sudo chunkwm --install-sa` but I'm not sure if it installed or is working correctly.. I have `chunkwm --load-sa` at the bottom of my .chunkwmrc file. But I noticed when I enter the command manually I get the following warning, which then says successfully loaded.

```
2019-05-06 12:59:13.001 chunkwm[54278:158498] warning: failed to get scripting definition from /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app; it may not be scriptable.
chunkwm: successfully loaded sa!
```

Another reason that leads me to believe chunk sa may not be working properly is that the following commands don't do anything at all.

`chunkc tiling::desktop --focus 1`
`chunkc tiling::desktop --create`
`chunkc tiling::desktop --annihilate`
