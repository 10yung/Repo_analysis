Hi,

When running this example chunk 
```
    ```{r "setup"}
    library(RTutor)
    setwd(getwd())
    ps.name = "myps"; sol.file = paste0(ps.name,"_sol.Rmd")
    libs = c("ggplot2") # character vector of all packages you load in the problem set

    #name.rmd.chunks(sol.file)
    create.ps(sol.file=sol.file, ps.name=ps.name, libs=libs)
              
    # The following line directly shows the problem set 
    # in the browser
    show.ps(ps.name,launch.browser=TRUE,
      auto.save.code=FALSE,sample.solution=FALSE)

    ```
```

`create.ps(sol.file=sol.file, ps.name=ps.name, libs=libs)`

threw an error of 

Error in cdt[ci, ] : incorrect number of dimensions

Regards,
Bernard

Hi,

I cannot seem to run the command in my console. It results in an error

```

Much appreciated for any help.

Thanks for your efforts in making RTutor shared!

I am wondering if it is possible to use RTutor in Linux. Here is my experience:

I tried the solution on:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38345894/r-source-gist-not-working
the following get over the source_git problem :
devtools::source_gist("fad6062e5462c9d0efe4", filename = "install_rtutor.r")

But then (here is the R command I issued and the messages up to the first error):

Thanks in advance any way...
