Hey folks, first I want to say how much I love this project.  Great concept and this is almost usable as my everyday shell.  _But_ I'm having some issues that I can't get past.

1. Ctrl-w closes my shell - This is something that I can't get past.  Ctrl-w in bash should kill the word before the cursor.

2. Ctrl-d doesn't act as Del key - Another bash-ism, if there is text present then ctrl-d should act as if Del were pressed and delete the character in front of the cursor.

3. Various things break in Emacs - Mouse scrolling & ctrl-arrow keys don't work.  And Page Up/Page Down will actually print `PageUp` or `PageDown` when pressed.

```                                                                                                                                                                        
        "log"                                                                                                                                                                                        
        "net"                                                                                                                                                                                        
)PageDownPageDownPageDown                                                                                                                                                                            
```

It also seems like Emacs can't tell how many rows my shell has.  Text at the bottom of a document is unreachable.
I got an error prompt when I executed the `tmux` command

<img width="483" alt="screen shot 2018-11-09 at 16 19 10" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23230442/48252246-2d5de180-e43f-11e8-87d9-ac072fd5139a.png">

The root cause is oh-my-zsh tmux plugin alias `tmux` to a shell function

![picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23230442/48252431-b543eb80-e43f-11e8-86b2-3959a03af95e.png)

The `canExecute` method return false in this case

I created a fix for source. Maybe it is not the best approach but it is a simple one.
An issue is happening on macOS Mojave...

The app turns all white and becomes unusable after trying to create a new tab (both from the menubar and with keyboard shortcuts).

Same thing happens when changing a directory (`cd ../foo`) to and from another directory.
This is more of a question than an issue.

I see the output of SHELL environment variable is bash
```
echo $SHELL
/usr/local/bin/bash   
``` 

and yet I don't think .bashrc is read. Also cannot execute the following commands

```
source .bashrc
Cannot read property 'length' of undefined  

. .bashrc
Upterm: command "." not found.   
```    

Apologies if this has been already answered or is not even the goal of this project.
There are no preferences in my UI that I can find. Especially I'd like to remove ^w as closing the window because there's never ever been a time that I've needed to do that and ^d or `exit` hasn't been good enough.
There was an issue reported a while back: #398
It seems to be rejected, but some of them have been implemented like alt-d, so I not sure when it was updated.
Either way, ctrl-u still doesn't work, and ctrl-d should exit the terminal if there are no characters to delete. I would like to work on potentially fixing this, but I have no idea where the keybindings are for the readline bindings. I can find other bindings, but couldn't find (for example) alt-d at all.
### Steps to reproduce:

1. Paste the following code into the terminal
```bash
echo "Hello"
echo "World"
```

### Observed behavior:
The lines are concatenated together. What gets run is `echo "Hello" echo "World"`.

### Expected behavior:
The lines are run in sequence, with the first line run first and then the second line run after the first has completed.
