Hi - Hope you can help. Would like to use the Tilt Brush version of this (in Unity) for microphone input, but it is set for internal audio source. I have a show in our planetarium next week, already using Lasp for part of it, but I am not a C# coder to adapt TB visualizer input to take the microphone. Any tips? A line of code?
Hello , i am getting this error with kinect array of microfones:

```
Starting Microphone failed. result=25 (Unsupported file or audio format. )
UnityEngine.Microphone:Start(String, Boolean, Int32, Int32)
Reaktion.GenericAudioInput:StartInput() (at Assets/Reaktion/Utility/GenericAudioInput.cs:62)
Reaktion.GenericAudioInput:Awake() (at Assets/Reaktion/Utility/GenericAudioInput.cs:42)

```
