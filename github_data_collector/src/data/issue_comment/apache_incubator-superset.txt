### SUMMARY

On the "What’s new in 1.0.0 (??)" page https://dev.pandas.io/docs/whatsnew/v1.0.0.html , the following is stated: "It is recommended to first upgrade to pandas 0.25 and to ensure your code is working without warnings, before upgrading to pandas 1.0." As Superset is still on `0.24`, it makes sense to bump to `0.25` now, as `1.0` is currently nearing release.

Bumping required a small change in `superset.result_set.py` due to Pandas now being more explicit about timezones. The new logic caused timezone aware datetimes to be incorrectly adjusted by the timezone offset. I traced back the change to this PR: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/25263

### SUMMARY
This PR aims to simplify and consolidate the use of z-index values (z-indices?) throughout the codebase. 

In the main `stylesheets/less/variables.less`, there are a few semantic layers onto which you can place elements. Add more if you want, but try to keep it minimal. Think of them like layers in Illustrator similar. 

I found a handful of z-index values that appeared to make no difference, so I've removed them. This is the riskiest part of this PR, but for each of these, I poked around trying to find the element(s) in the UI and make sure that it looked the same before/after removing the value. 

### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF
n/a - everything should look identical, unless there's an instance of an element I missed that becomes obscured by being covered up.

### REVIEWERS
@williaster (some of the z-index values I removed were yours, according to git — I hope I didn't break anything you added for good reason)
@mistercrunch (you probably have some context about these elements too, and can make sure I didn't do anything stupid)
It is not possible to build a image from Dockerfile, because it has a error when I'm trying to build the image.

### REVIEWERS

Hi Team,
I have modified the superset_config.py to connect to my ldap server. When i run this as a docker pod i m able to connect to the LDAP server and the logging is working fine. But when i deploy this on a Kubernetes cluster   using helm charts it throws the below error.

      
```
Traceback (most recent call last):

```

Note: The ldap server is up and running and we are able to contact it from other kube pods not sure why it is not working from superset pod.

## [SIP-34] Proposal to establish a new design direction, system, and process for Superset

## Motivation

In August, 2019, a project was kicked off to re-imagine the design of Superset, and create a “North Star” for the interface, flows, and visual aesthetic of Superset. The primary goal of the project—and this SIP—is to create a new visual design framework for Superset's user interface. 

Since its inception, Superset has rapidly grown in scope, size, audience, and complexity thanks to the work of this community. This growth has led to an accumulation of “design debt” in forms including problematic user flows, inconsistencies in interface elements, or general complexities that may be simplified/clarified by revisiting the design of Superset holistically.

The intent of this undertaking was to smooth out the user experience of Superset, targeting all of the following:

- Supporting most use cases and functionality currently in use by known Superset users in the design process, while reducing dead-ends and friction in these flows. Features and flows removed or deprecated are listed under "Removals and deprecations" below
- Focusing on the “objects” of superset (namely Datasets, Queries, Charts, and Dashboards) and how those are structured/accessed throughout the flows of Explore and SQL Lab
- Smoothing out and simplifying the general experience, making Superset easier to use for new users, and faster for more experienced ones
- Creating a more consistent design and experience throughout the product, with a well defined style guide, and coherent design system

Participants in this project included:

-  [Preset, Inc.](https://preset.io/) - a startup founded by @mistercrunch to offer Superset as a hosted service, acting as primary sponsor of this design effort
-  [Cartel](http://carteldesign.com/) - a digital product design firm focusing on research, strategy, and UX design for the next generation of enterprise software companies
- Various members of this community, including Airbnb, Lyft, and others

We hope that this new design direction will carry Superset forward for the foreseeable future, and create a unified design system upon which to build future features. Community feedback is welcomed, and when this SIP is voted in, further efforts will be undertaken to break down the design into smaller units of work.

### Process used in this effort:

Efforts began with the announcement of a call for volunteers in a design interest group, via the Superset dev mailing list, and on the Superset Slack workspace. The search for members of this small group targeted individuals who were able to commit 2+ hours per week, have a history of involvement/merit with the project, have a sense of design, and understand Superset users and use cases.

A "Superset Design Group" email was set up, as well as a private channel on the Superset Slack workspace, to maintain an open line of communication throughout the duration of the project

A kickoff meeting of the resulting group was held on September 4th, 2019. This initiated the creation and iteration of core user stories. This was quickly followed by an effort to assess the Analytics / BI marketplace, resulting in a competitive analysis report (this research is proprietary, and cannot be shared publicly).

Weekly design sync meetings took place each Thursday, allowing Cartel to get feedback on their latest design proposals from the team/community, and gather insight/direction on "big question" issues about the product's direction. After each session, prototypes were circulated, and feedback gathered via the slack and email channels. Each 1-week design sprint was comprised of ongoing work on larger concepts (e.g. the relationship between SQL Lab and Explore, or controls used to build data visualizations) as well as smaller, more specific tasks. 

#### Summary of key findings
A product audit of Superset, user personas, and general product recommendations are available in an [Experience Brief](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/files/4068645/ExperienceBrief_SIP.pdf).

## Proposed Changes

### Notable changes to design and functionality

#### Visual Design
- All UI fonts are changed to [Inter UI](https://rsms.me/inter/) for increased legibility, and fixed-width numeral options for tabular data. Code fonts have been changed to [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). Both of these fonts are open source (license information below).
- New default color palettes for dataviz. These have been checked for accessibility issues. Old palettes will be supported for backward compatibility.
- A full style guide is available in the prototype, with specs for a variety of UI element interaction states, layout spacings (all based on an 8 pixel grid)

- Tabs in SQL Lab have been removed (See [related SIP](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/8655)).

### Maintenance and improvement of design assets

For maintaining the new design work (and assets stemming from it), the current proposal is to maintain the creation of a Superset team on [Abstract](https://share.goabstract.com/07731649-7586-4279-bc2d-244ce37289fe?). The latest Sketch files will be made public and open source, and managed via Abstract's version control system. PMC members from the Superset community may reach out to the PMC mailing list to submit designers or design teams to be added to the Abstract team to contribute to the design. The latest `master` version of the files will be maintained in the public InVision [prototype](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/V5VH03AHBER#/screens), maintained by Preset (though interested parties may request comment or write access, granted on a case-by-case basis).

### User testing and validation plan

Design and feature proposals submitted herein were conducted using the Superset Design Group as a focus group, making sure that functional and visual changes to the UI address the issues and use case criteria of those involved in the discussion. It is our intent, and belief, that these designs push the usability of Superset forward greatly. We anticipate that individual features and UI elements will require further input and discussion, as this "north star" for design begins to play out. Our hope is that this round of design will provide a foundation to test further iterations/variations, and those results will bear out in additional SIPs and PRs on a case-by-case basis.

### Updates to Superset documentation

Documentation and Screenshots for Superset exists in a number of places, most notably on the [Apache website](https://superset.incubator.apache.org/) and on the [Github repo](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset). A best effort should be made to update these resources with updated screenshots and/or instructions as relevant as PRs are written to move the project toward this new UI. If any changes are encountered that require large scale changes to documentation, those changed should be discussed in an additional SIP.

## New or Changed Public Interfaces

TBD — Impact will be minimized on existing interfaces, but implementation of workflows and features may require changes to how APIs and metadata are structured and/or accessed.

## New dependencies

The scope of third party dependencies is not entirely known at this time, but will be defined and assessed in future PRs as the work is broken down into smaller tasks. An effort will be made to make sure all licenses are compatible with Apache License v2.0.

Some known licenses thus far include:

- Inter UI (font) — SIL OpenFont license (needs to be labeled in ASF releases)
- Fira Code (font) — SIL OpenFont license (needs to be labeled in ASF releases)

## Migration Plan and Compatibility

Due to the broad scope of design and functional changes, several core sections of the codebase — both frontend and backend — will need to be modified in functionality and/or refactored. This will likely lead to a significant number of required database migrations. While breaking changes in backward compatibility will be made as minimal as possible, they may occur in subsequent PRs as this work is further scoped and ticketed, and should be tracked with semantic versioning in future releases.

For frontend implementation, it should be noted that an older version of React-Bootstrap is used in existing Superset UI components. This older version is built upon Bootstrap 3, which is built with LESS (as is much of Superset, allowing shared styles/variables). Upgrading components to a newer React-Bootstrap (and thus Bootstrap 4) would require migrating the bulk of the CSS codebase over to SASS, which is not ideal. The implementation of this SIP should iterate toward deprecating the React-Bootstrap dependency, in favor of bespoke components with custom LESS styles built around this new design system.  

All changes, in the design and implementation of new components, should be "atomic" in nature, steering toward a more unified design/component system, targeting reusability and consistency.

## Rejected Alternatives

No alternatives at this time. We've considered previous design-related SIPs in this process, and have reached this proposal with input from several active PMC members. We're open to feedback, however, so please feel free to leave constructive feedback below. This work is to be considered foundational, and will undoubtedly continue to evolve with the ongoing support of the Superset community.

 
### Expected results

what you expected to happen.
After login with admin/admin for production docker running image, there is no menu/dashboard showing up. 

### Actual results

what actually happens.

Instead it shows up some blank page with a button.
