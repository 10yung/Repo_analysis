## Bug Report

filmon plugin, 504 Server Error: Gateway Time-out

### Description

Here is filmon plugin bug for streamlink's team attention
in case somebody would be willing to fix the plugin.

Error is intermittent and occurs about once in every half an hour.
To replicate this error it would require watching the stream for up to 30 minutes
and player would freeze in some point in time.
To close that frozen player it must be killed as a process, otherwise it stays frozen indefinitely.
It happens to be with vlc, mpv and ffplay.

### Reproduction steps / Explicit stream URLs to test

https://www.filmon.tv/channel/bbc-world-news

```
$url = 'https://www.filmon.tv/channel/bbc-world-news'
run('streamlink.exe --http-no-ssl-verify --player=ffplay.exe ' & $url & '  best','',@SW_MINIMIZE)
```

### Comment

streamlink-1.3.0-20200118.exe
windows 10

The change is introducing two new optional cmdline options:

--ffmpeg-fout: The output file format when muxing with ffmpeg
--ffmpeg-start-at-zero: When used with ffmpeg and copyts, shift input timestamps so they start at zero

Both options defaults are keeping the predefined values, hence backwards compatibility is enforced.


## Plugin Request

- [X] This is a plugin request and I have read the contribution guidelines and plugin request requirements.


### Description

Discord introduced live streaming direct from the desktop app a while back. It would be nice to be able to send these streams to a player of your choice.

### Example stream URLs

It is not possible to post a URL for a Discord stream as it is in-app only at this time, which is the whole point of this plugin request.

### Additional comments, screenshots, etc.

None.

### Description

Streamlink is no longer able to play clips from Twitch, giving a "410 Gone" error for `https://clips.twitch.tv/api/v2/clips/[clip_name]/status`. This is separate from the now-fixed 410 error for live streams and VODs, though the root cause is probably the same (Twitch removing old private APIs).


### Reproduction steps / Explicit stream URLs to test

Any Twitch clip, e.g. https://clips.twitch.tv/LuckyExquisiteHamburgerAsianGlow

### Log output

## Bug Report

<!-- Replace [ ] with [x] in order to check the box -->
- [x] This is a bug report and I have read the contribution guidelines.


### Description

<!-- Explain the bug as thoroughly as you can. Don't leave out information which is necessary for us to reproduce and debug this issue. -->
Using the command: ` streamlink -o file --twitch-disable-hosting --retry-streams 5 --loglevel debug twitch.tv/example best` while the streamer is offline, then losing internet connection and reestablishing it, leaves streamlink unable to record the stream when the streamer comes online later on, even though log messages say it's attempting to get live HLS streams.
Forcing close and running command again is necessary.

### Expected / Actual behavior

<!-- What do you expect to happen, and what is actually happening? -->
Expected streamlinks to recognize that the stream went online and start recording, OR close the process despite the "--retry-streams" flag due client internet loss.

### Reproduction steps / Explicit stream URLs to test

<!-- How can we reproduce this? Please note the exact steps below using the list format supplied. If you need more steps please add them. -->

1. Make sure the twitch streamer to be tested is offline
2. Run ` streamlink -o file --twitch-disable-hosting --retry-streams 5 --loglevel debug twitch.tv/mizkif best`
3. Cut internet connection
4. Wait until timeout error
5. Reestablish internet connection
6. When streamer comes online, streamlink is unable to detect the stream despite log messages attempting to get HLS stream

### Log output

TEXT LOG OUTPUT IS REQUIRED for a bug report!

### Additional comments, screenshots, etc.
Changing/using a VPN also causes the same issue.
Issue doesn't seem to be channel dependent.
