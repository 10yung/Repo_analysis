Hello Avishgh599. 
I am wondering that why it takes so long time? 
Maybe it is finding clique from estimated world points which are getting larger and larger? 
Correct me if I am wrong, the KITTI data set you have used here is already rectified right?
Hi, @avisingh599 ,

I came accross the following error after running demo.m
#

Undefined function 'angle2dcm' for input arguments of type 'double'.

Error in minimize (line 37)
dcm = angle2dcm( r(1), r(2), r(3), 'ZXZ' );

Error in demo (line 38)
[R1, t1, cliqueSize, outlier, resnorm] = visodo(I1_l, I1_r, I2_l, I2_r, P1, P2);

Caused by:
    Failure in initial user-supplied objective function evaluation. LSQNONLIN cannot continue.

My system is ubuntu 12.04, matlabr2014a

Could  you suggest me how to fix it?
