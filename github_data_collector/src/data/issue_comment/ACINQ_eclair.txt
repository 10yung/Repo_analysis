This PR builds on top of  #1279
lnd expects ids ranges in reply_channel_range messages to strictly follow each other, without gaps.
For example, using block heights and not ids, [1,2,4,5] would be split into (first=1, num=2, [1,2]) :: (first=3, num=2, [4, 5])

This is arguably a limitation of lnd (c-lightning does not requires this and it's not needed to properly process replies) but is easy to implement.
It would be great if I could connect the Eclair mobile wallet to my Tor only electrs server using Orbot. Sadly I can't because it requires a valid SSL certificate. Please make an exception if the custom Electrum server address is an onion domain.

As suggested from others in my initial PR https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair-mobile/pull/229, I created this PR to cover up eclair-core and not only eclair-mobile.
This will allow an external signer to fully validate the transaction.

For example, providing the redeem scripts allows checking:

- the OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY delay
- that a remote commit tx uses our revocation base point
- etc.

Use gettransaction for wallet transactions (code -5)

How to solve this?
We add new errors that let senders know they need to raise the trampoline fee/ctlv.
When the error is downstream, we select the best error to forward.
The error message produced now provides the user with a solution.  Of course it's temporary until they receive another non-segwit UTXO.

<!-- What behaviour did you expect? -->
I expected that the readme file to which this error links would provide some information on how to deal with the inability of Eclair to use a wallet that contains non-segwit outputs.  That error is displayed in #1255  because I was unable to copy it.  It serves as a good example on which to base a solution in this particular case.  More generally, however, I think any link offered by a reported error (the readme file in this case) should contain something to indicate what someone can do if they found a solution to the error which they would like to be available to others.  I 
<!-- What was the actual behaviour (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->
See #1255 

I have provided a fix for this in pull request #1256.  I think the error message can be improved directly (to say "To use the current bitcoin wallet, you must send any existing non-segwit UTXOs to a new `p2sh-segwit` or `bech32` address before starting Eclair.") so I might work on another pull request to do that.

When Eclair pops up a message box like this one, it should be possible for the user to select the text of the message and copy it.  This was not the case with the message above.  If this is an aspect of the underlying Java environment, please let me know so I can report it as a JVM bug.

The message above was produced with a file called eclair-node-gui-0.3.1-6906ecb.jar on a Windows 10 machine running JDK 11.0.3.0.
