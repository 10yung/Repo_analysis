The feature described here doesn't seem to work: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Repeat_last_change

Has anyone managed to get this working?

I installed vimception as described in the readme. But once I start clicking into cells, the cursor just stays there and everything stops working. I can't type or anything. all I can do is leave insert mode and switch to other cells but then I can't edit those either.

edit: I can report some more details now:
Entering (ipython) insert mode i can actually type stuff, but there seems to be no way to switch between (vim) command and insert mode, only (ipython) command and insert mode.

If I execute code that results in an error message, like `asdfasdfasdf`, then everything stops working altogether.

I think using the above format or some variant might make it a lot easier for your users to get started! The preview is at https://github.com/Russell91/ipython-vimception/tree/patch-1.

The original instructions delete a notebook cell when the kernel is restarted in an existing notebook, and when vimception is alway loaded (#4). This code fixes this.

By updating to version 3.0.0 vimception stops working. Pressing i (insert mode) sends kernel interrupting signal.

Added throw-catch to blur event handler to deal with exceptions that see med to be short circuiting the process and causing 'stranded cursors'

Ctrl+V should turn visual block selection mode on, which does not happen (OS X/Safari).

Hello,

I've installed vimception and the extension for code-folding in ipython 2.3

It seems to be that only one of them work at a time.

Can you confirm that they do not work together?

(love the plugin!)

I use <c-h> to backspace, as my keyboard doesn't have a backspace. Any way to do that?

Is <c-c> obligatory due to how ipython notebook's modal keybindings work? Would it be possible to use <esc> as well?

I'd be happy to contribute if possible.
