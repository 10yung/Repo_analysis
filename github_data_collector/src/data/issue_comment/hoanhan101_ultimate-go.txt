For me I think this is common and confusing pitfall beyond just error interface, it affects any user-made interfaces and structs.

I've created Go snippet for this: https://play.golang.org/p/2HRJ9AP6Emh

In Java, `null` in `DerivedClass` is the same `null` in `BaseInterface` when assigned
A lot of Go Projects are now moving to new dependency management system: Go Module

- Go Module would be promoted instead of GOPATH (*GOPATH would still be there for backward-compatibility*)
- This Feature will be finalized in soon-to-be Go 1.14.

Is there any plan for it, or it need further discussion?
