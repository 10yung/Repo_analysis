Continuing from IRC: I'm currently using the following highlighting configuration in prezto:
```
zstyle ':prezto:module:syntax-highlighting' highlighters main brackets pattern line
zstyle ':prezto:module:syntax-highlighting' styles line bold
```

The latter line makes the whole input line stand out by making it bold. Is such a thing possible with fast-syntax-highlighting?
When selecting text in the Zsh vi-mode or pasting text, reverse styling is used.
If possible I would like a configuration option to not use "reverse" styling and instead be able to set the fg and bg. 

Here is a screenshot of how it looks currently:

I would like to be able to configure it with colors something like this:

When highlighting this text with the default theme,
```zsh
zsh -i -c "cat /etc/shells* | grep -x --line-buffered -i '/bin/zsh'"
```
I get this:

It seems the second last character should be yellow, but it is not. If I put a space between the single and double quotes, it highlights correctly:

I would like to make comments italic (to match the theme I have in Vim), eg. 
```comment = blue,italic```
Currently it seems like it is not supported as I get: 
```cannot parse style comment: unknown color or style element italic```

Would love if this could be added!
When I have multiple colors on the same command, I just want to know which is which.

This would save me a lot of time. If you could also support named colors and `hsl(a)`, as I see myself transitioning to using those whenever I can. 



Here an example of what I mean:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16988672/70378144-6bb52100-191d-11ea-8666-330dff5d3c8d.png)

I mean, that in the second case, the parentheses should not light up green but be treated as regular code.

Another example would be this, where I would expect red color for the first curly brace since it is not a command:

This might be a known issue but I only found [one mention](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting/issues/50#issuecomment-410592110) in the issues, which might even be unrelated (I didn't dig in deep if it was only about the command afterwards being treated as command). This also talks about performance issues which might be the reason the cases are not working as expected.

Commit 634ab246365ef6b465b4cdf7c6f0727ec04759a9 (current `master`)
In a simple git alias case, ex. `ci=commit`, the chroma works as expected, but in one that includes an argument it's looking for, it doesn't seem to do so, ex. `cm=commit -s -m`. In this particular example, the quoted string following `cm` isn't highlighted as a message being passed to `commit -s -m`.
(paraphrasing [the issue posted by Eras](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/issues/150) in zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting).

Steps to reproduce:

    enter "hello hello" to prompt
    press ^W ^W, both hellos are removed
    press ^Y and witness one 'hello' coming back

Expected behavior: "hello hello" would come back (works if zsh-syntax-highlighting is not enabled)

The issue was fixed in zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting, see https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/issues/150
I have been using `fast-syntax-highlighting` for a month now, and today I saw some problems.

## Image 2
In this example, we got 4 problems
1. `then` keyword half colored with another color also happens sometimes with the `do` keyword.
2. Inconsistency of `-l` color.
3. Inconsistency of `ls` color.
4. The second closing bracket yellow instead of green.

## Image 3
While trying to replicate the previous example, this character got highlighted when my cursor stays on the place at the right, looks very weird.

Can this be caused by something else?
Hi, I have a rather curious bug. That only occurs if I load `fast-syntax-highlighting` with omz.

I cloned `fast-syntax-highlighting` to `"${HOME}/.oh-my-zsh-custom/plugins/fast-syntax-highlighting/fast-syntax-highlighting.plugin.zsh"`.

Steps to reproduce expected behavior:
1. (quit every `man`)
```
❯ zsh -df
% source "${HOME}/.oh-my-zsh-custom/plugins/fast-syntax-highlighting/fast-syntax-highlighting.plugin.zsh"
% man vim 
% echo foo
foo
% man vi
%
```
2. Press arrow up. Result: `% man vi`
3. Press arrow up. Result: `% echo foo`

Steps to reproduce unexpected behavior/bug:
1. (quit every `man`)
```
❯ zsh -df
% plugins=(fast-syntax-highlighting)
% ZSH="${HOME}/.oh-my-zsh"
% ZSH_CUSTOM="${HOME}/.oh-my-zsh-custom"
% source "$ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh"
% man vim 
% echo foo
foo
% man vi
%
```
2. Press arrow up. Result: `% man vi`
3. Press arrow up. Result: `% man vim`
