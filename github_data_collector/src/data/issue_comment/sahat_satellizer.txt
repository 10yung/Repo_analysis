Hi, i have been experiencing a problem when authenticating with LinkedIn. There is no problem with Facebook and Google, however, when i try to authenticate with linkedin i get the following response: "You need to pass the "scope" parameter". Isn't the "scope" parameter included by default? I also tried explicitly include the parameter when setting clientId, still i get the same error. I would very much appreciate any help.

Thanks in advance 
Hi,

When authorization endpoint contains a query param, the URL generated for the Satellizer Popup is not valid due to wrong query param concatenation.

See a detailed bug report in https://github.com/gravitee-io/issues/issues/2672


My setup:
127.0.0.1:5000 - Frontend app with satellizer served on this port
127.0.0.1:8000 - Backend api/server with required auth urls

Satellizer settings in my apps config:
```
$authProvider.linkedin({
        clientId: 'MYCLIENTID',
        authorizationEndpoint: 'https://www.linkedin.com/uas/oauth2/authorization',
        url: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/social/linkedin/login/',
        redirectUri: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/social/linkedin/callback'
      });
```

What happens:
When I click the authenticate button the popup loads as expected and goes to the LinkedIn authorizationEndpoint set in the $authProvider.linkedin.

After entering the credentials it authenticates with LinkedIn as expected and then redirects to my callback url (the redirectUri setting in $authProvider.linkedin).

This is the callback url it loads: (blank page, status code 200)
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/social/linkedin/callback?code=AQQT4Xv_0w2bwhggtXfIcs9P0VJzL5EFjKsl2LuO4g0igX_wwaGl6bmfET1bi_AnPAPNbMid9FyQqXxw_DmnJ7KRDEc7xUmK1Vt6_BzcCriGPRQiMGXedE2GiiUnyk-Jh64jqD0-b1z0tdKaqRwDFvIUXJgTwKvzicA16GTYvYr6kIIrX6Xc40QgGmx3h&state=STATE
```

The popup window hangs on this page and does not get the 'code' and POST it to the social auth backend url **http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/social/linkedin/login/**.



Google+ APIs will be shut down on March 7, 2019. This includes Google+ Sign-in and OAuth token requests with Google+ scopes.
How it affecting satellizer, if it is, what are the necessary changes have to take by the end user of satellizer, if satellizer is being updated for this change, does satellizer pushing any patch for this.

Need some explanation, whether it is affecting satellizer users or not.

Ref: https://developers.google.com/+/api-shutdown

@sahat 
Is satellizer support version 1.3.x of the angularjs?
Hi, i found this problem when configure custom oauth to Wordpres
$authProvider.oauth2({
            name: 'KOAPP',
            url: 'http://subdomain.domain.com',
            clientId: 'tiihbdfgsdgssw',
            redirectUri: 'http://localhost:9001/#/wpaccountpro-XZ',
            authorizationEndpoint: 'http://subdomain.domain.com/wp-json/oauth2/authorize',
            oauthType: '2.0'
        });


Thanks
Hello, 

I'm actually using Satelliter to login with email/password and Facebook.
Is it possible to use it with Facebook login native app ?

Thanks
Hi Sahat,
Satellizer is been a great project, and it helped so many people including me. It is sad to see that it's dying. If you can no longer maintain it, in the spirit of open source project, please transfer the repo to someone who can and actually willing to maintain it.
