Hi,

Is it possible to add support for UWP ARM64 and ARM?
I'm running this commands:

```
           var create = $"CREATE TABLE SuperPower" +
                         $"(" +
                             $"Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL," +
                             $"Name VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL) ;";
```

```
            var create2 = $" CREATE TABLE Character" +
             $"(" +
                 $"Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL," +
                 $"Name VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL," +
                 $"Age INTEGER," +
                 $"Alive INTEGER," +
                 $"History VARCHAR(200)," +
                 $"Money FLOAT," +
                 $"SuperPowerID INTEGER REFERENCES SuperPower (Id)" +
             $");";
```

```
//THERE IS ONLY 2 RECORDS
            var sqlInsert1 = $"INSERT INTO SuperPower VALUES (null, 'FLY')";
            var sqlInsert2 = $"INSERT INTO SuperPower VALUES (null, 'POWER')";
```
```

//SET THE FIRST SUPERPOWER ID... OK!
            var sqlInsert3 = $"INSERT INTO Character VALUES (null, 'Kaz', 18, 1, 'Warrior', 125.2, 1)";
```

```
//**SHOULD THROW AND ERROR SINCE I'M REFERENCING THE SuperPowerID = 5, WICH DOESN'T EXISTS**
            var sqlInsert4 = $"INSERT INTO Character VALUES (null, 'Marker', 19, 1, 'Mage', 180.2, 5)";`
```

But the record at sqlInsert4 is being inserted at the database.
If I try to insert violating the FK rule from SQLiteStudio, it throws an error of FK violation, wich is correct.

Why the framework is not respecting FK rules?
Has the android .so (armeabi-v7a, 32bit) been built with FTS support? I am getting an error "No such module: fts4" when trying to run FTS queries on my Android device. On desktop it is working fine.

Unity: 2019.2.5f1

Hello,
I am trying to make a build for 64 bit support, also i've added the .dll file as mentioned in the sample project.
But i am getting error:
2019-08-05 16:37:14.027 20250-20294/? E/Unity: Unable to find sqlite3
2019-08-05 16:37:14.035 20250-20294/? E/Unity: INIT Database Catch error:Unable to load DLL 'sqlite3': The specified module could not be found.
Please let me know if i need to reimport the plugin or change any settings.
connection.Insert(record) is always returning 1 not the auto incremented id, it appears to be returning RowsAffected from ExecuteNonQuery even though map.HasAutoIncPk is true and it updates the field?
The sqlite-net library have SQLiteAsync.cs support async await, would you consider supporting this Synchronous API?
I want to JOIN 3 table and fetch specific values from it. Can anyone provide me the Demo Query using JOIN because currently, I'm using the Query method for JOIN. Also is there a way to assign Foreign Key constrain?
I might just have missed something, but from what i can see, there is no support for SELECT DISTINCT in this framework. I would find it very useful if there were. 
Hi @robertohuertasm , I am experiencing a similar problem, but in my I am targeting UWP Desktop. I've followed your windows tutorial and did everything accordingly, but when I run the application on VS 2017, upon inserting values in db I get the following output.
