We appreciate your feedback. Thank you for using microk8s.

Had been following the Quick start guide at https://microk8s.io/docs/

May be related to https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s/issues/893 but I see differences.
* This is a clean install of ubuntu but running on zfs (does this matter?)
* I have installed microk8s via the snap
* the node will not ever become healthy.

Running on:
* Ubuntu 19.10 (eon)
* microk8s v1.17.0

but I see
```

See the `InvalidDiskCapacity` warning.

This sounds harmless but if I try and _do_ anything such as enable one of the microk8s components I then see that this fails with `ContainerCreating`.

```

So any thoughts on what I'm doing wrong would be most welcome.

Is there any way to change port where scheduler and controller-manager components are listening?

I mean, currently thuey are listening to 10252 and 10251.

Is there any way to change that?



Hi,
I just install ubuntu 19.10 on my raspberry pi 4b.
I just need some help. 
When I install microk8s, I can not start a pod, it is pending, and when I try status an error is thown.

This are the commands:
sudo snap install microk8s --classic ==> OK
microk8s.kubectl start ==> OK
microk8s.status  ==> microk8s is not running. Use microk8s.inspect for a deeper inspection.
microk8s.kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx  ==> OK, but pod is in pending status

Any ideas ?
thankss

this is my inspect:

When running microk8s on the server, rather than doing port forwarding it should be possible to access the dashboard via ingress (similar to kubeflow dashboard)
I run microk8s in the restricted environment and google dns is unreachable.
Due to this reason I can't resolve any remote addresses as the default resolvers currently and by default point to 8.8.4.4/8.8.8.8
https://microk8s.io/docs/addon-dns describes how to change the value temporary, but the settings revert if I enable/disable plugins.
There should be an option to set up upstream dns permanently.
If microk8s is installed on a computer which has capital letters in the hostname, pods cannot be created after enabling rbac.

The reason seems to be that the hostname is normalized to lowercase by kubernetes, which fails rbac authorization checks when it is compared to the non-normalized hostname.

Symptoms include failure registering the node, failing to mount secrets, etc. I didn't keep a record of the different failures, but this is an example (note that the capitalization differs between the lease and the user):
```
Jan  9 09:46:05 my-Precision-5540 microk8s.daemon-kubelet[6158]: E0109 09:46:05.170054    6158 controller.go:177] failed to update node lease, error: leases.coordination.k8s.io "my-precision-5540" is forbidden: User "system:node:my-Precision-5540" cannot update resource "leases" in API group "coordination.k8s.io" in the namespace "kube-node-lease": can only access node lease with the same name as the requesting node
```

After changing the computer's hostname to be all-lowercase, everything worked perfectly.
With Kubeflow stable, we can enable testing of microk8s.enable kubeflow
We would like to improve the `microk8s.status` command by offering descriptions for each addon.
This comes as a follow up to the work in https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s/pull/876 and in an effort to address issues such as https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s/issues/869. Please review the following doc [1] and leave comments as you see fit. Thanks.
