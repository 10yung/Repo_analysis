### SUMMARY
<!--- Describe the change, including rationale and design decisions -->

I was having issues running the initial database migrations on an empty database. `awx-manage migrate --noinput` from the installer on the `ansible-tower-management` pod was failing with `psycopg2.OperationalError: root certificate file [redacted] does not exist`. Providing the expected directory when the variable is set resolves this. This is the exact syntax that the CA path gets passed into the web/task containers in deployment.yml.j2.

If you are fixing an existing issue, please include "related #nnn" in your

kind of annoying that `python-memcached` doesn't expose a logger that does this, but whatever

##### SUMMARY
Currently, when you specify an scm branch for a job template launch, the template will launch with the correct code, but if the inventory is sourced from a project, it will always sync with the branch specified in the project itself. If the inventory between the two branches is different, this can cause issues with the job launch by pulling the correct branch for the project itself, but the incorrect branch for the inventory.

##### SUMMARY
We are using AWX 9.1.1
We defined a project named : DEPLOY_DEV
for this project, we allowed branch override, and we have not specified any branch.

We defined a job template : DEPLOY_DEV_AUTO
this job template ask for branch on launch, which will point to the branch SCM where we have our playbook and our inventory.

We defined an invenotry named: INVENTORY_DEV
this inventory is supposed to point to the same branch SCM as job template on run.

Expected Behaviour : 
When we launch a job based on job template DEPLOY_DEV_AUTO and specify branch "V1" , DEPLOY_DEV and INVENTORY_DEV should be synchronized with branch "V1", then the job is launched

Actual Behaviour : 
When we launch a job based on job template DEPLOY_DEV_AUTO and specify branch "V1" , DEPLOY_DEV is synchronized with branch "V1",INVENTORY_DEV is synchronized with "master" (since the field branch in project is empty) . it fails, which is normal since it's looking for inventory in master branch.
We don't want to put anything in branch field for project since we have a new branch for every job, so a new inventory and a new playbook.

##### ENVIRONMENT
* AWX version: 9.1.1

##### SUMMARY
This is closely related to #5221, since that time, now the postgres_db module of ansible has the maintenance_db option, but it's missing from the /usr/bin/launch_awx(_task).sh  script.

The problem is the same, as in the previous ticket: when an external postgres db is used, it will try to connect first to the 'postgres' db as it's the default of the maintenance_db variable.

`bash-4.2$ source /etc/tower/conf.d/environment.sh`

`bash-4.2$ ANSIBLE_REMOTE_TEMP=/tmp ANSIBLE_LOCAL_TEMP=/tmp ansible -i "127.0.0.1," -c local -v -m postgresql_db --become-user $DATABASE_USER -a "name=$DATABASE_NAME owner=$DATABASE_USER login_user=$DATABASE_USER login_host=$DATABASE_HOST login_password=$DATABASE_PASSWORD port=$DATABASE_PORT" all`

`Using /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg as config file
An exception occurred during task execution. To see the full traceback, use -vvv. The error was:
OperationalError: FATAL:  no pg_hba.conf entry for host "172.22.0.5", user "awx_test", database
"postgres", SSL off
127.0.0.1 | FAILED! => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "msg": "unable to connect to database: FATAL:  no pg_hba.conf entry for host \"172.22.0.5\", user
\"awx_test\", database \"postgres\", SSL off\n"
}
`

##### ENVIRONMENT
* AWX version: 9.1.0
* AWX install method: docker on linux
* Ansible version:  2.8.4
* Operating System: Centos7
* Web Browser: N/A

##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Set an external postgresql server in the environment.sh config file:
DATABASE_USER=awx_test
DATABASE_NAME=awx_test
DATABASE_HOST=XXXXX
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_PASSWORD=XXXXX

2. Start the awx_web containers

##### EXPECTED RESULTS

The reconfiguration of the containers is done without problems.

##### ACTUAL RESULTS

The initial reconfiguration will fail, as it can't connect to the maintenance_db (postgres by default)

##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION


Possible Solution:
Following file should be changed:
installer/roles/image_build/files/launch_awx.sh

From:
ANSIBLE_REMOTE_TEMP=/tmp ANSIBLE_LOCAL_TEMP=/tmp ansible -i "127.0.0.1," -c local -v -m postgresql_db --become-user $DATABASE_USER -a "name=$DATABASE_NAME owner=$DATABASE_USER login_user=$DATABASE_USER login_host=$DATABASE_HOST login_password=$DATABASE_PASSWORD port=$DATABASE_PORT" all

To:
ANSIBLE_REMOTE_TEMP=/tmp ANSIBLE_LOCAL_TEMP=/tmp ansible -i "127.0.0.1," -c local -v -m postgresql_db --become-user $DATABASE_USER -a "name=$DATABASE_NAME owner=$DATABASE_USER login_user=$DATABASE_USER login_host=$DATABASE_HOST login_password=$DATABASE_PASSWORD port=$DATABASE_PORT **maintenance_db=$DATABASE_NAME**" all


Or define a DATABASE_MAINTENANCE_DB variable in environment.sh and make it to default to the database name.

Thanks
