### Summary:
When installing a LTI tool that has the same launch as an existing tool, one is presented with a warning. In the Australian Language Pack, one of the buttons is labelled "Yes, Instal Tool". It should read "Yes, Install Tool".
### Steps to reproduce:

 1. Add an App in and Australian Language pack using Canvas.
 2. Add another app with the same launch URL
 3. Observe the "Yes, Instal Tool" button has a typo.

### Expected behavior:
"Yes, Install Tool"
### Actual behavior:
"Yes, Instal Tool"
### Additional notes:
Problem is in this file: "config\locales\en-AU.yml", on line 23856:
```yes_install_tool_f51b3278: "Yes, Instal Tool"```

Apologies for not doing a pull request, I didn't want to fork the whole repo for just one typo. Let me know if I've logged this incorrectly or anything. Bit of a github newbie! :)

### Summary: Wrong Chinese (Traditional) translation of UI string

### Steps to reproduce:

 1. Access https://hkedcity.instructure.com/ , login and open a module
 2. To the left side of the screen, note that the Traditional Chinese translation of "File" is "文檔" (wrong) instead of "檔案"
 3.

### Expected behavior: Traditional Chinese translation of "File" should be "檔案"

### Actual behavior:

### Additional notes:
I googled a lot and searched everywhere to find the translation site of Canvas but failed. Please point me there if I can edit the translation directly. Thank you.
Good community.
I am writing to ask how to activate the option to edit password inside the profiles?
We have a sub-account in the main account and the users who are in it do not show the check box to change their password.

I appreciate the help you can give me
When set_dashboard_positions is given a string instead of an integer, they are happily stored in the user record.
Later when the dashboard is rendered, Ruby tries to sort the dashcards by :position and this means that a string is compared against an int, crashing the application with "comparison of String with 2 failed" or something similar.

Test Plan:
- Added new test case in dashboard_helper_spec.rb as suggested by @claydiffrient in the previous pull request #1407 

```

### Summary:
I ran up a docker server locally with smtp services on. I encountered a problem when sending out invitation email to student.  But email can be sent out to any other roles with no error. 
### Steps to reproduce:

 1. Run docker server locally.
 2. Expose 465 port for ssl smtp and setup stmp server config following production guide.
 3. Run delayed_job script to make sure all delayed jobs are daemonizing

### Expected behavior:
Send out enrollment invitation email
### Actual behavior:
No msg sent out

Error report said: ```Delayed Notification processing failed | confirm_registration.email.erb:2:in `block in parse!'    | /opt/canvas/canvas-lms/app/models/message.rb:503:in `eval'                                                                                      | /opt/canvas/canvas-lms/app/models/message.rb:503:in `populate_body' ```
...

No error stored in delayed jobs database using psql command: `select last_error from delayed_jobs order by updated_at desc limit 1;`
### Additional notes:
Temp workaround: I just sent instructor invitation email to students and change their role after. This method is apparently not what I'm looking for.
