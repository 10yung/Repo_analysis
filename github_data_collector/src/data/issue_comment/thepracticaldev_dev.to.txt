## Description

So it can generate a seed for each test execution which can then
be used to by `rspec --bisect` to repro order dependent flaky specs.

This is one approach to identify the root cause for https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/issues/5228

It appears this is failing because `current_user` is `nil` before this spec is
run.

We should use this tool or something similar:

https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize

The purpose is to get a heads up about the growth in certain files so we don't add unnecessary burden to our core files like vendor.js.

It will help us know when we might want to lean on dynamic import.

https://dev.to/ben/we-reduced-our-vendorjs-from-210kb-to-16kb-in-about-five-minutes-of-work-and-ten-lines-of-code-1ole

When I try to comment in a post in the dev tools the url to comment https://dev.to/comments responds with a status of 404 and also when i click on write a post button it shows Oooops... you have encountered an error.

My browser is chrome 79 and windows 10
