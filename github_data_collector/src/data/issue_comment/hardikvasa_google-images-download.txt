Added argument that prevents redownloading images already saved with the same filename.
Simple fix for #249 that doesn't require downloading history.
To check whether extension is at the end of the image name instead of checking anywhere in whole image name.
I need that when the program downloads the images, they come with a name that I preset ...

Any idea?
"print(iteration.encode('raw_unicode_escape').decode('utf-8'))" caused the script to crash when characters like "åäö" were used, removing the encoding (or comment/remove the print function) solves this issue.
Currently get the error 
```

Could not open URL. Please check your internet connection and/or ssl settings 
If you are using proxy, make sure your proxy settings is configured correctly
```
Is there an automatic way to upload the image, or can the it support local images?
Fixed issue with help method for cli.
Replaced some variables to the separate fail to make it more readable.
When searching in Japanese, there was a problem that garbled characters were generated in metadata obtained by `extract_meta`.

In `download_page` it uses `str(resp.read())` to convert bytes to a string, which is wrong, It must decode correctly.
And it can eliminate unnecessary conversion when converting to JSON.

I also added test cases.
