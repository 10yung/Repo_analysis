library(umapr)
library(tidyverse)

df <- as.matrix(iris[ , 1:4])

embedding <- umap(df)

The following error is generated by my RStudion when I'm running the above code: 
![umapr_error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37533909/61853687-1688ed80-aeef-11e9-96a3-78639b6b2b60.png)

Thanks.  
Hi, I am trying to use the package to create a UMAP-based unicategorical analysis (similar to ONEsense), but when I change:

umap.defaults$n_component == 1, 

i get an error after the algorithm tries to create the initial embedding:

(Error in result[, 1:d, drop = FALSE] : incorrect number of dimensions) 

I think that for the Python version this works fine. Am I doing something wrong? Can you help me out?

Thx

Ed
Code from vignette: 
```
rm(list = ls(all = TRUE))
# devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/umapr", force = TRUE)
library(umapr)
library(tidyverse)
df <- as.matrix(iris[ , 1:4])
embedding <- umap(df)

Error in throw(e) : could not find function "throw"

Hi,

I am using the r wrapper function of UMAP, with all the requirements satisfied but unfortunately I cannot set the seed into the umapr function.
e.g. umapr::umap(iris[,1:4], n_neighbors = 5, random_state = 4), I always ran into the following error

Error in py_call_impl(callable, dots$args, dots$keywords) : 
  ValueError: 4.0 cannot be used to seed a numpy.random.RandomState instance

However, if I remove the random_state parameter, its working fine but not reproducible, could you please suggest what could be the reason behind it and any help in solving the error?

Thank you,
Himanshu
Doing this on large datasets with many variables requires returning a huge object which considerably slows it down and uses more memory. 

Could make this optional behavior.
Is python available? Is `umap` module available?
