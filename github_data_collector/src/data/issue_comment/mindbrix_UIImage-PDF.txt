First, it appears nothing has happened at all lately. Will this repo be updated again?

Secondly, using this in a Swift 3 project, I get loads of errors on using any image property of an imageView: 
`backgroundImageView.image = UIImage(named: "someImageName")`
`❗️-> cannot assign to property: "image" is a method`

This means I can no longer use this library b/c it breaks code in many many files.
...
Apple has an internal class also called PDFView. As it's not defined which class should be used, the linker gives a warning about that. To avoid that, PDFView has been renamed to NTBPDFView.
If more warnings are enable in Xcode these warnings are shown:
- `Implicit conversion turns floating-point number into integer: 'float' to 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned long’)`
- `Implicit conversion loses floating-point precision: 'double' to 'CGFloat' (aka 'float’)`

This commit fixes these by adding explicit typecasts.



The method `- (UIImage *)image` in the `UIView+Image` category causes an error in Swift projects.
The error message is:

```
getter for 'image' with Objective-C selector 'image' conflicts with method 'image()' from superclass 'UIView' with the same Objective-C selector
```

Assignments to the `image` property of `UIImageView` in Swift with `.image =` will also get `Cannot assign to property: 'self' is immutable` error.

This pull request attempts to fix those errors.

Converted a PDF to UIImage and than saved that image to savedPhotos album. When i am previewing that photo, normally it is coming right but after tapping on photo, photo is getting blank, but if i am using any other image it behaves accurately.

Please update asap with fix

iOS Version : 9.3

As subject, please update the published cocoa pods version, so that it includes fixes for the 64bit warnings.
