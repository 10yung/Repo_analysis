Right now, some rejects are returning "custom" objects instead of objects. We should create custom erros for them and reject always with an Error.

# üêõ Bug report

## Description

`webhint` VSCode plugin shows error for ul/li if li-s are generated with code:

## Environment

* __`hint` version:__ v6.0.3
* __`Node.js` version:__ v12.11.1
* __`OS`:__ macOS Mojave 10.14.6
* __URL for which webhint failed:__ n/a

## `webhint` configuration

Default configuration.


# üêõ Bug report
I was running the browser extension against a subgrid demo, https://stephaniestimac.com/css-grid-experiments/project5/good-omens-subgrid, and "display: subgrid" isn't being flagged as not supported in browsers (except firefox, it's supported there).




# üêõ Bug report

## Description

webhint VS Code extension hangs if `hint` is present in `node_modules` (*i.e.,* `hint` is in package.json and `npm install` is run in project folder).

Repro steps:
1. Open web project that has `hint` in package.json before running `npm install` to see feedback from webhint.
2. Run `npm install` in project folder.
3. Output shows the following message; webhint feedback does not appear in Problems pane.

4. Deleting `@hint` and `hint` from `node_modules` and reloading VS Code restores functionality.

## Environment

* __`hint` version:__ webhint VS Code extension 1.5.2 / no local installation of `webhint` CLI
* __`Node.js` version:__ 12.5.0
* __`OS`:__ Windows 10


We need to document the [severity changes](https://github.com/webhintio/hint/issues/3036) somewhere in the docs and probably link from the browser extension and online scanner.

* `Error` - Will definitely not work as intended in at least one of the target browsers
* `Warning` - Minor impact or may not cause problems in practice (even if technically "wrong")
* `Hint` - Fine for now, but could cause problems in the future if something changes
* `Information` - Additional context or FYI, possibly to help with other parts of a feature
Nellie is an amazing mascot and her charm and stickers are magical.

For clarity and discoverability, I wanted to suggest re-considering the icon for the webhint panel (and maybe the logo usage in small favicon-sized spaces).

This is based on reoccurring feedback about the panel icon when demoing webhint in DevTools. The icon was interpreted in manifold ways, just never a narwhal. Making the narwhal/hint connection isn't obvious as well and takes some explaining.

I don't have any proposals up my sleeve yet, just some searches on noun project:

This is what I have running the latest version of webhint on the website:

We are getting an Error because we are missing `-webkit-filter` and `-webkit-sticky` even though those browsers are not in the default browser support matrix.

I believe this should only be an Error if adding the missing property helps somehow the browsers that we target, warning otherwise.

@antross @Malvoz @digitarald thoughts about this?
This is part of the work requested by the OpenJS Foundation in #3163 and needs approval from the maintainers and maybe OpenJS' CoC
