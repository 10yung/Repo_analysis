## Proposed changes

- Add `TempAppSettingsAttribute` for all tests
  in order to set `AppSettings.CheckForUpdates = false`

There is no need to tinker the `AppSettings.SettingsFilePath` because the user's GE settings file is not used but one which is specific for the test runner, e.g. 
`SettingsFilePath: C:\Users\appveyor\AppData\Roaming\NUnit Software\NUnit Engine\GitExtensions.settings`

## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->

- AppVeyor
- Windows 10

Fixes #7650

## Proposed changes

Use -- to escape files starting with "-".
Quick review of other QuoteNE() usage. In addition to the issue, QuteNE was used without escaping paths in a couple of situations.
Incorrect use of QuoteNW in a testcase too.

Other commands could be affected too, this is quite hard to investigate.

## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->

Manual
Remove an image that starts with "-" and view the diff

## Proposed changes

"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery". Copy implementations from the Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk, that is used by .NET projects.

This SDK offers a number features and provides a number of tasks such as clean, restore, build, rebuild, test, etc.
Which both work from Visual Studio and command line.

I decided against using the actual package for a number of reasons:

1. The package isn't published to nuget.org.
2. The package is being actively developed, and may be causing unnecessary overhead, if the package maintainers modify behaviours.
3. The package contains significantly more functionality, catering for the Microsoft .NET development process.
4. The package would require a significant number of adjustments to the project and its structure, to make use of it.

Taking the limited subset of the SDK provides a greater control over the executed targets and their configurations.


Supported CLI commands:

```ps
# build with restore and binary log enabled (default set)
# same as supplying '-restore -build -bl'
> .\build.cmd

# default build and build C++ projects
> .\build.cmd -buildNative

# default build and run unit tests
> .\build.cmd -test

# default build and run integration tests
> .\build.cmd -integrationtest


# cleans all artifacts, default bin and obj folders
> .\build.cmd -clean
```

The Git Command Log window auto-scroll the content, making it really hard to review the command that just has been executed. Can we stop auto-scrolling? Perhaps create a checkbox to stop updating the content automatically.
## Current behaviour

When the GitHub token is invalid, [Repository.Owner](https://github.com/gitextensions/Git.hub/blob/master/Git.hub/Repository.cs#L14) property is not filled (which is normally done by the `Git.hub.dll` code) so every call in this class that use `Owner.Login` crash with an exception.

Follow up of  #6814

See #7594, #7636

Workaround: generate a new valid github token.

## Expected behaviour

Not crash.


## Steps to reproduce

1. Set a bad GitHub token
2. Go to "Create pull request..."
3. NRE


## Did this work in previous version of GitExtensions

No


## Environment

- Git Extensions 3.3.0
- Build d0d22cdcbd88322e5d0c3270b70eb61490e73a5e
- Git 2.23.0.windows.1
- Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.17134.0
- .NET Framework 4.8.4075.0
- DPI 192dpi (200% scaling)

## Current behaviour

Since #6296, we can't delete more than a file at a time in RevisionDiffControl. I wonder why ?

## Expected behaviour

Be able to delete multiple file at a time.

## Steps to reproduce

In a repository, modify two files
Open Git Extensions
Click on "Working directory"
Go on Diff tab
Select the two files
Click right
Delete file is not visible.

## Did this work in previous version of GitExtensions

No idea.
