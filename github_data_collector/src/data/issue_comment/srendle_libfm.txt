while i try to save model train with sgd the error rise:
```
../bin/libFM -task c -train sampleRatingData.dat.libfm -test sampleRatingData.dat.libfm -dim ’1,1,8’ -out sample.res -rlog sample.log -method sgd -learn_rate 0.001 -regular '0,0,0.001' -save_model model.fm

ERROR: the parameter save_model does not exist

Some people claim the model can saved by sgm-trained model with `save_model` flag, how to fix this?
I code as the MCMC algorithm in Paper Factorization Machine with libFM in python ,but it  not work ,is there any detail I can do ?

Dear all,

Hoping to get some insight into feature design here and check my understanding is correct, as I am new to FMs. 

In the original Factorization Machines paper in 2010, the "Other Movies Rated" feature contains normalised values for all the other movies the user has ever rated. 

Let's use the user Alice in the example, and assume the example covers the training set. We see she's rated 3 movies: NH, TI, and SW. Since there are 3 movies, the "Other Movies Rated" columns have values of (0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0...). 

Say in my test set, Alice has rated ST (Star Trek) with a target of 1. In my "Other Movies Rated" columns in the test set, should I use (0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25 ...), with the fourth value updated for Alice's rating of ST? Or should I use (0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0...), similar to the training set?

Thanks in advance! Apologies if this question has been asked elsewhere, I haven't been able to find a conclusive answer. 
hello, i am newer to use libFM, it was a great tool 
 i used mcmc to train a CTR model, i met 2 pro 
1)  data has 160 million features,  when init_V is small such as 0.001,0.005 it seem normally that auc is 0.6-0.7 but when i set init_V 0.1,0.5 the result just like 0,0,3333,1... i hope you give me some advice
2)  i saw "if mcmc save model it will have to save param every iter" why only save last iter param is not ok ?  and   way the final y_predict is avg of evey iter.

i hope to receive some reply 
thanks!
Thanks for a great package! Would it be possible to add custom loss functions (e.g. WARP: https://lyst.github.io/lightfm/docs/lightfm.html)?
您好！最近在看libfm的源码，关于自适应FM部分中部分代码不是太明白，感觉代码和原理不是太相符。在sgd_theta_step函数中对t代权重进行了更新，而在predict_scaled函数中计算t+1代的p值时为何又对权重更新了一次？望指点！
Hi,

how can i lookup the weights of the variables of FM after training?

The README of this project: https://github.com/jfloff/pywFM states:

> Make sure you are compiling source from libfm repository and at this specific commit, since pywFM needs the save_model. Beware that the installers and source code in libfm.org are both dated before this commit. I know this is extremely hacky, but since a fix was deployed it only allows the save_model option for SGD or ALS. I don't know why exactly, because it was working well before.

It seems weird to me that the author hasn't approached you to find a better solution than this hack, and I'm not familiar enough with the code to suggest a PR that would solve the problem cleanly. Besides, currently there's no explicit explanation as to why you forbid to load/save for things other than SGD or ALS, so I don't know where I could do that.

Therefore, I'm making this issue to see if we could find a better solution than this! :-)

@srendle  Could you explain what the problem with other models are, and why this check is in place?

@jfloff Could you tell us why pywFM needs to be able to save/load different kinds of models than SGD and ALS?

Thanks!
