I use the default traffic light buttons on OSX. For some strange reason when I do beginSheet on my app and show an NSWindow, the traffic light buttons go to the top. Right now the height is 38 on the titleBar.

Is there a way to fix this?

This problem reproduce with the latest code. And some app such as SoureTree\WeChat has the problem also,reason and solution as below:
The problem caused by the call of convertBaseToScreen(INAppStoreWindow.m line 567),it works well if caculate the offset of window move without the convert.
NSPoint now = [window convertBaseToScreen:theEvent.locationInWindow];
NSPoint now = [NSEvent mouseLocation];

Hi,
Where do I start to add this to my existing project?
I haven't found a guide yet.
Thanks

To reproduce:
1. Set System Preferences -> General -> Appearance to 'Graphite'.
2. Run SampleApp.
3. Note that 'traffic lights' are monochrome in other apps, but colorful in SampleApp.

When using INAppStoreWindow in a document based application on 10.11 the window theme widgets are positioned incorrectly briefly when showing a sheet. I tracked down the cause of the issue and unfortunately the only place to hook into NSWindow to correct the behavior is in -(void)_updateCollectionBehavior. So the fix I have in place looks like this:

-(void)_updateCollectionBehavior
{
    [super _updateCollectionBehavior];
    [self _layoutTrafficLightsAndContent];
}

Of course, the problem here is that the method is private and therefore may cause problems with App Store applications.

Faced with trouble with one user that runs yosemite with NSAppKitVersionNumber == 1331.12, which is less than 1343 in code.
I think you should better detect OSX version via NSFoundationVersionNumber:

``` objectivec
    floor(NSFoundationVersionNumber) > NSFoundationVersionNumber10_9
```

Hello i have a question:

![titlebar](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5613199/5146265/d7ea1e2c-71aa-11e4-8714-a75ce81fe663.png)
Is this a bug?

I change the color for the title text, but the color for Document Edited State Title ( -- Edited)  does not change

I'm looking for a solution for the problem :-/ hope someone can help

I've run my app (built on Xcode 6.1) on Yosemite, and I've noticed that the three buttons in the top-left are positioned incorrectly - they sit in the top-left part of the title bar like in standard apps, and they jump to center-left of the bar when the window is moved. Is this a known issue (or something you've fixed on master)?

If we are full screen then move them where we expect them to be.

On Yosemite, when the window is in full screen mode, the window buttons are on a different window other than the INAppStoreWindow. If we set the frames of window buttons, they disappear from the floating titlebar when the mouse is moved up to the menu.
The patch fixes the issue by checking if the window buttons are in a normal window.
