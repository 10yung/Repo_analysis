[React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) is a new addition to React 16.8, I've refactored the classes here to use hooks instead and removed HOCs.

I've also introduced [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) and updated the version of Redux and React Router being used.

I removed Prettier as well since it's an opinionated code formatter and an `npm audit fix` just to get rid of the vulnerabilities that are easy to fix.

Let me know what you think @rokoroku!
My routes work fine unless they are nested more than one level deep.

If I have this:
```
<Switch>
    <Route path="/rooms/:id" component={ShowRoom} />
    ...
</Switch>
```

I get errors on that page: 
```

```

It looks like somewhere it's injecting the `.js` file as a relative path `<... src="app.xxxxx.js">`, instead of `<... src="/app.xxxxxx.js">`

I can't find where it is. Any help?
How do I set up VSCode to debug with breakpoints?
Considering package update 
PR #73 
since there is a prettier config in the project. Should I add husky to the project for only staged files?

whenever i add local script to index.html it shows Error: Parse Error

This package is awesome!
I would like to apply `React Hot Loader` in my project. But I config same as you but still not working. 
Tell me if I missing

webpack.config.js
```js
// about plugins
// 1st Remove new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),
// 2nd about devServer
devServer: {
	hot: true,
	inline: true,
},
 // 3rd about module
module: {
	rules: [
	//...
	{
		test: /\.(ts|tsx)?$/,
		include: appPath.appSrc,
		use: [
					{
						loader: 'babel-loader',
						options: { plugins: ['react-hot-loader/babel'] }
					},
					{
						loader: require.resolve('ts-loader'),
						options: {
							// disable type checker - we will use it in fork plugin
							transpileOnly: true,
						},
					},
				],
	},
],
```
`App.js`
``` 
// 4th import hot
export default hot<any>(module)(AppConfig)
```



I cannot run this project by Docker. anyone tries to run inside of a docker?
