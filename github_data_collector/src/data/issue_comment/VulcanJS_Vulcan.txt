Need upsert mutator like this:
```javascript
return upsertMutator({
    collection: Movies,
    document: movie,
    data: movieData,
    validate: false,
  });
```
The query field on a nested schema doesn't seem to get the data from another collection.
So `CollectionUtils.getCollectionAsOptions` does not get the data it needs to have a `select` within a nested schema.
Since Meteor uses a really outdated Node.js version (v8.15.1) while the latest LTS version is already on 12.x, it is highly likely that the Node.js version on anyone's computer still defaults to 8.x; it is better for the npm packages to be installed with the Node.js installed with Meteor.js.

Instead of doing a `npm install`, `meteor npm install` should be used in https://github.com/vulcanjs/vulcan#install and https://docs.vulcanjs.org/index.html#Install.

If you don't want to expose `meteor` cli to the user, maybe wrap it around a npm script and call it something like install-dependencies and ask the user to run the following instead:

```
npm run install-dependencies
npm start
```
Hello, I added 3 new views for the MuiRadioGroup to display : 
- 10 columns of MuiRadio (if the max length of the label is < 3) 
- 8 columns of MuiRadio (if the max length of the label is <7 ) 
- 5 columns of MuiRadio (if the max length of the label is <12 ) 
and made some minors changes to the responsivity of already existing views. 

Also, I fixed some margin issue with the label. The label had a 12px margin, and the radio none. So, the label was higher than the radio.

You can find here screenshot of a SmartForm with radiogroup on different devices:

the special handling of a change is relevant only while `native` and `multiple` are selected 

This needs to be properly tested before getting merged. Based on Unit
Tests it does not break anyting.

When building the demo application for the new datatable with @loustak,
we will make sure to try this commit out.
â€¦dation errors. (#14)

Currently Vulcan does not support a required field that is created via `onCreate`. A really common example is `dateCreated`, but in general it should be possible to have fields that are required but generated by the server in `onCreate`.

One could argue that passing a dummy value would solve the problem. While this might be reasonable for `dateCreated`, it is not a general solution, since there may very well be fields whose purpose/existence is completely hidden from the client.

*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.3.0 - September 24th, 2019
> Fixes:
> 
> - Security: Disallow calling "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" directly - 2078c72
> - Disallow calling "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" directly - 2078c72
> 
> Features:
> 
> - Add new runtime option `allowCallsToHelperMissing` to allow calling `blockHelperMissing` and `helperMissing`.
> 
> Breaking changes:
> 
> Compatibility notes:
> - Compiler revision increased - 06b7224
>   - This means that template compiled with versions prior to 4.3.0 will not work with runtimes >= 4.3.0
>     The increase was done because the "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" are now moved from the helpers
>     to the internal "container.hooks" object, so old templates will not be able to call them anymore. We suggest
>     that you always recompile your templates with the latest compiler in your build pipelines.
> 
> - Disallow calling "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" directly - 2078c72
>   - Calling "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" directly from a template (like in `{{blockHelperMissing}}` was 
>     never intended and was part of the exploits that have been revealed early in 2019 
>     (see https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). *It is also part of a new exploit that 
>     is not captured by the earlier fix.* In order to harden Handlebars against such exploits, calling thos helpers 
>     is now not possible anymore. *Overriding* those helpers is still possible.
>   - If you really need this behavior, you can set the runtime option `allowCallsToHelperMissing` to `true` and the
>     calls will again be possible
> 
> Both bullet points imly that Handlebars is not 100% percent compatible to 4.2.0, despite the minor version bump.
> 
> We consider it more important to resolve a major security issue than to maintain 100% compatibility.

We have some conflicting issues for Webpack version, necessary to build Storybook:

- This needs us to update Webpack to at least 4.31: https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/9154
- This locks us to at most 4.28 to support dynamic import: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/8656

But maybe the second issue is now solved so we should try a Webpack update. I've locked some package versions to bypass the first issue but it has to be temporary.
