Recently Homebrew started to "Migrating cache entries" on updating.
But it looks like it fails to import plist from Launchrocket and generate an error:

```
j0k@MBP:~$ brew update && brew upgrade
Updated Homebrew from 7ed3be5 to 46f531b.
Updated 3 taps (homebrew/cask, homebrew/core, phinze/cask).
==> Migrating cache entries...
Error: Failed to import: /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/jimbojsb/homebrew-launchrocket/Formula/launchrocket-plists.rb
launchrocket-plists: undefined method `sha1' for #<Class:0x0000000112f1eb50>
==> New Formulae
```

Everything goes fine after that. But I'm wondering if that error make the whole "migration cache entries" to fail.
According to https://github.com/jimbojsb/launchrocket/issues/68#issuecomment-360616116 taking 2 to count-1 instead of count-3 should keep both the name before @ and version after @, did I understand that right?
Running the prefpane and executing commands using the sudo.app does not work with macOS Mojave anymore and produces the following error:

    2018-07-25 11:06:47.243209+0200 System Preferences[11264:321795] Result of `/bin/launchctl list | grep homebrew.mxcl.postgresql$` was (null) with error: {
        NSAppleScriptErrorAppName = sudo;
        NSAppleScriptErrorBriefMessage = "Not authorised to send Apple events to sudo.";
        NSAppleScriptErrorMessage = "Not authorised to send Apple events to sudo.";
        NSAppleScriptErrorNumber = "-1743";
        NSAppleScriptErrorRange = "NSRange: {104, 64}";
    }

There is some explanation over here: https://www.felix-schwarz.org/blog/2018/06/apple-event-sandboxing-in-macos-mojave
brew install mysql@5.7, the service in launchrocket list , appears as `7`

When there are many items it is needed to scroll down to a specific service.
I recently installed a brew package that was added at the bottom of the list.
Given that I would use it very often I would like to be at the top of the list instead.

I've tried to look into `~/Library/Preferences/com.joshbutts.launchrocket.plist` but it seems the order of the items in that file is not related to the actual visual order of the panel.

How would it be possible to reorder the panel items?
Launchrocket can't show valid service name.

May be I can to define it manually? 

`curl: (56) SSLRead() return error -36

using `brew cask install launchrocket`, but it throws error. May be something wrong at launchrocket  file server?
ref #67 

## nginx does not need `root` permision

## NOPASSWD set

`/etc/sudoers`:

```
root		ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
%admin		ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

i type `sudo` in terminal no need to input password, like:

```
sudo brew services start nginx
```
