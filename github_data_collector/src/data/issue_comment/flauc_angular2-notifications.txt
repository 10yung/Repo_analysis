At the moment, the library does no integrate to Angular 9 with the following error message :

> SimpleNotificationsModule.forRoot returns a ModuleWithProviders type without a
> generic type argument. Please add a generic type argument to the ModuleWithProviders type. If this occurrence is in library code you don't control, please contact
> the library authors.
#351 
Please update the example code or add something to the documentation, because I don't know what that method is expecting for the content field. An entire HTML document or a partial?

It would be great to have the ability to play an audio sound with each notification.  Like on an error notification to play an error type sound.

Hi @flauc , Thanks for creating such an amazing library.

I have a requirement where I want to show success notification at top-right corner and warning in middle-centre.

As I can see we can override the default position property by defining at the root.

Can I expect the changes in the near future, where "position" property accepts as an override property on each notification creation?
Hi .....I have  the following installed
angular2-notifications 0.7.8  with: 

Angular CLI: 1.7.4
Node: 8.11.4
OS: win32 x64
Angular: 5.2.0  ....up from 4.5
... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms
... http, material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic
... platform-server, router

@angular/cdk: 5.2.5
@angular/cli: 1.7.4
@angular-devkit/build-optimizer: 0.3.2
@angular-devkit/core: 0.3.2
@angular-devkit/schematics: 0.3.2
@ngtools/json-schema: 1.1.0
@ngtools/webpack: 1.10.2
@schematics/angular: 0.3.2
@schematics/package-update: 0.3.2
typescript: 2.6.1 ....up from 2.4.2
webpack: 3.11.0

when I attempt a --prod build I am getting this error:
ERROR in ./node_modules/angular2-notifications/src/push-notifications.module.ts
Module build failed: Error: C:\coderepo\puppydog\puppydog\node_modules\angular2-notifications\src\push-notifications.module.ts is missing from the TypeScript compilation. Please make sure it is in your tsconfig via the 'files' or 'include' property.

I don't want go to angular2-notifications 2.0 since it has more breaking changes. I have tried ver 1.0.0 and got errors also. 
How can I solve this problem?
I have this in my app.module

```
const options = {
  maxStack: 1
};

@NgModule({
....
imports:[
...
    SimpleNotificationsModule.forRoot(options),
]
```

This works, however if I want to add the position attribute as:
```
const options = {
  position: ['top', 'right'],
  maxStack: 1
};
```

A compiler error comes up saying that
```
Argument of type '{ position: string[]; maxStack: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Options'.
  Types of property 'position' are incompatible.
    Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'Position'.
      Property '0' is missing in type 'string[]'. [2345]
```

Is this normal behaviour? is it not possible to setup position from app.module?
What has changed since version 0.9.5? I can't find changelog for those things. I would like to know if there is any breaking changes. It seems that node version support has been changed at least.
