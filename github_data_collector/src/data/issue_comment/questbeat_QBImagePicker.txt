I am getting this error while compiling my react-native app. 
I am using react-native-image-crop-picker and that library uses QBImagePicker.
Any help is appreciated!

**How can we navigate user to Camera Roll when image picker is prompted.**

Whatsapp is directing users to camera roll by default. User mostly goes to camera roll to pick files, therefore, making user to choose camera roll everytime might not be the best experience. Is it possible to this with this package?

Is there any way to get reference URL same returned by UIImagePickerController
issue is i have a PNG image of 55mb with dimension 10,000*10,000
when i select that image from UIImagePickerController,i get this as jpg with size 5mb as iOS compress it and i can easily perform any operation on it.
but when i use this library,and get image through PHImageManager with request options and write it to Documents directory,its still 55mb and taking too much time to write.
With the current framework version is not possible to support for new languages directly in the Application. 
This pull-request retrieves messages also from App bundle. 
When i switch my language from arabic to english my apps language gets changed but on opening the image picker the titles are still in arabic, it only get converted on app launch. How to solve this problem.
1. fix from PR #180, but with missing `}` added. `: `Fatal Exception: NSInternalInconsistencyException attempt to delete and reload the same index path`
2. fix for `Fatal Exception: NSInvalidArgumentException *** -[NSPlaceholderString initWithString:]: nil argument`
3. fix for `Fatal Exception: NSInternalInconsistencyException negative sizes are not supported in the flow layout`
4. added type safety by explicitly setting some double literals to floats for `Parameter type mismatch: Values of type 'double' may not fit into the receiver type 'CGFloat'`

A feature I would love to see in this project is the ability to tap an image and have it show full screen, with the ability to scroll thru and select those full screen images.  Tapping the upper right corner of the images in the grid would behave as it currently does, and select the grid image.  But tapping anywhere besides the upper right corner would show the image full screen.
