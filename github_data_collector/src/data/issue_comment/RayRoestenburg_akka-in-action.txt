Sending the very first http messages always gets ignored. Seems like its stuck in identify state. Sending the first message (which will get ignored) seems to force it to move to identified state. All subsequent http messages then are accepted / handled. 

Im not sure why (still learning). can be fixed with stash() and unstashAll() but sure this is not best way.
Any readme file for these programs ?  This is what i get from running the first program
```
