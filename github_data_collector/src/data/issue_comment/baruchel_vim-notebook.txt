You mention this in the docs.  I'm still seeing it despite using the suggested config:

```
let g:notebook_cmd = '/Applications/j64-804/bin/jconsole'
let g:notebook_stop = "exit ''"
let g:notebook_send0 = "''"
let g:notebook_send = "'VIMJNOTEBOOK'"
let g:notebook_detect = '   VIMJNOTEBOOK'
```

To clarify the issue, the 3 spaces before every prompt are collected and included with the output.  Therefore if I execute a code block with N lines, the first line of the output will include 3*N spaces at the start.  Eg,

```
    x=.7;8;9
    x=.2;x
    *:&.> x

         ┌─┬──┬──┬──┐
│4│49│64│81│
└─┴──┴──┴──┘
```

The desired behavior would be:

```
    x=.7;8;9
    x=.2;x
    *:&.> x

┌─┬──┬──┬──┐
│4│49│64│81│
└─┴──┴──┴──┘
```

Any suggestions?

Thanks!
I've tried the following configuration:

```
" attempt at node
let g:notebook_cmd = 'NODE_DISABLE_COLORS=1 node'
let g:notebook_stop = "process.exit()"
let g:notebook_send0 = ""
let g:notebook_send = "'VIMNODENOTEBOOK'"
let g:notebook_detect = "'VIMNODENOTEBOOK'"
```
Note that the final two lines reflect the fact that node echoes back quotes when literal strings are entered:

However, when I `:NotebookStart`, vim just hangs and needs to be killed.  Do you know the correct settings for node?  If not, any tips for debugging or what I might attempt to make it work?

Thanks!
