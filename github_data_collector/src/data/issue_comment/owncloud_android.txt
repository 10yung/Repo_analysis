### BUGS & IMPROVEMENTS

After releasing 2.14 version, let's do some retrospective in the upgrading for app versions with old endpoints, that's it, versions older than 2.9

```
Old endpoint: remote.php/webdav/ <br>
New endpoint: remote.php/dav/files/<user>/
```

Upgrading matrix was totally correct: 

| From..To | 2.9.3 | 2.10 | 2.11 | 2.12 | 2.13 | 2.14 |
| :-------: | :---: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 2.6 | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | 
| 2.7 | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | 
| 2.8 | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | 

An specific upgrading scenario was reporting here https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/2787

So, the scenario of upgrading from 2.6 to 2.13.1 was also recorded. The final result is OK. In the video you will see the following steps (using the creation of a folder as operation)

1. In device, 2.6 version is installed (you will see in the User-Agent)
2. Creation of a folder called "Test1" (MKCOL operation), by calling the old dav endpoint, as you can check in the mitmproxy flow.
3. Upgrading to 2.13.1
4. Creation of a folder called "Test2". In this case the endpoint is the new one.

[upgradeFrom2.6.zip](https://github.com/owncloud/android/files/4065793/upgradeFrom2.6.zip)

I noticed one issue:

1. Install an old-endpoint-supported-version (<2.9). No matter the server version.
2. Upgrade to 2.14.1

Current: app crashes, but after restarting it works properly.
Expected: no crash

Time difference between release 2.8 (latest old-endpoint-supported-version) and 2.14.1 is 18 months... so, it will not be a usual case to upgrade from one to the another one. Does it worth to check and fix the issue for the following versions @michaelstingl ?

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently one of the photo apps on my phone are not able to store the picture on the folder which is used from owncloud client and the other photo app to sync with my server.
Therefore tasker is coping the pictures to the correct folder but a sync is not started.
I would like to tell the client ... do a folder sync .. or .. a new picture is stored. Sync it.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to have a trigger which can be used from tasker to start a folder sync...
I would like to tell the owncloud client ... do a folder sync .. or .. a new picture is stored. Sync it! ...from tasker

### PR

- App
- Library (if needed)

Hi,

We're working on the release of 2.13.1 to our CERN community and there were a couple of issues that we found.
Please keep in mind that we have our own implementation of the backend (REVA), which differs from the OC10 server, so some of these issues are not bugs _per se_ but what we see as limitations.
I can open some of them in separate issues if you prefer.

## 1. App crashes looking for parent
If I have a folder, I would expect dav to return `httpd/unix-directory` as `d:getcontenttype`. This is actually something that is present in the new REVA/OCIS ([propfind.go#L230](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/blob/e56f28d27e3d0aaedc3d193e4415c0248d0c38b3/internal/http/services/owncloud/ocdav/propfind.go#L230)).
But, if I return this, the app crashes [here](https://github.com/owncloud/android/blob/88089179b0f10b491174524850bac5e4874a6a2d/owncloudApp/src/main/java/com/owncloud/android/datamodel/OCFile.java#L517) with `parentPath` null.

## 2. App fails to load shares
Due to our storage infrastructure, where files might live in different storage instances and fileIDs are not shared between them,  `item_source` and `file_source` have the format `InstanceName:FileID`, for example `home:123456`. This works for both the web and sync clients.
But on the mobile app, when getting the shares of a file (`GET ocs/v2.php/apps/files_sharing/api/v1/shares`), the app gives an error and displays nothing. This happens because it tries to convert file/item source into `Long` ([ShareXMLParser.kt#L246](https://github.com/owncloud/android-library/blob/9a806469c5a0289494fbf8dae3491d632ae8c53e/owncloudComLibrary/src/main/java/com/owncloud/android/lib/resources/shares/ShareXMLParser.kt#L246) and [ShareXMLParser.kt#L263](https://github.com/owncloud/android-library/blob/9a806469c5a0289494fbf8dae3491d632ae8c53e/owncloudComLibrary/src/main/java/com/owncloud/android/lib/resources/shares/ShareXMLParser.kt#L263))

## 3. App uses the old webdav endpoint
When we released 2.13 into our beta channel, our testers (including me) were updated from the version 2.6.0. Everything seemed to be working fine, until someone tried to install the app in a fresh device (and when I removed my account and added it again).
What happened was that the people who updated still used the old webdav endpoint (`/remote.php/webdav`) and the people who started clean used the new one (`/remote.php/dav/files/`), which was not compliant. After discussing this in the OC chat, I was informed that the app should always use the new endpoint and is not compatible with the old one. So this is a Bug that need to be fixed before we release the update to everyone else.

## 4. App freezes when app switching
If I opened OC, switch to another app and tried to return to OC, the app froze and I had to close it and open it again.
I cannot reproduce this problem anymore, maybe there were some leftovers in the device like the ones reported in 3.. Maybe it was caused by the fact that the app was using the old webdav endpoint, I'm not sure. I'll report back later if I manage to reproduce it again.

Android version:
10
Device model: 
OnePlus 6T
Stock or customized system:
Stock
ownCloud app version:
2.13.1
ownCloud server version:

Not sure if this app is supported anymore. I can probably put up a PR for this after digging into it. Creating the ticket anyway.

### Actual behaviour
App crashes when trying to connect to server secured with self signed certificate

### Expected behaviour
App should not crash
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Have a server secured with self-signed certificate
2. Open the app and try to connect to it

### Environment data
Android version: 9

Device model: OnePlus 5T

Stock or customized system: stock

ownCloud app version: 2.14.1

ownCloud server version: ownCloud 10.0.10 (stable)

### BUGS & IMPROVEMENTS

Btw, I see this inconsequent maintained @author still as redundant and pointless, because `git` has **much better** tools to see who did something
