After upgrade to 3.x version, I created a bottom sheet menu on 10" tablet landscape orientation. I found that only bottom sheet title is shown and i need to swipe up the sheet to show all menu item.
But when i change orientation to portrait, it works perfectly.

How can i show all menu items when bottom sheet is shown when in landscape mode
I found that the hiding of MenuItem doesn't work. Is it my way of using it?
