Due to JUCE, importing the font will increase the software size. I think that try to directly call the system font when initializing the window and use precompiled headers to distinguish the files.

I've known of the project for a while and I think that, in terms of the easy to use navigation system and the polish interface, Helios might be one of the best DAW on android for making a quick melody. But I reckon it would be if user on mobile platforms can have a virtual keyboard (VB for short)And I think I might have found one that doesn't felt clumsy to use. So there's this app called "Grantophone":
https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/grantophone/id476003757

which is probably the most amazing pocket synth I've tried (cause I pretty much haven't try anything else at all :p). So basically the idea is that the volume of each notes are control by the vertical position of the fingers on each keys (closer to the midle, louder the note) and there no elevation of the blackeys either. This both give the user more note range, more controllable note Dynamics (how do you call when peoples intentionally play loud or softer) all the while being less awkward to play (to me at least) than a piano layout on a 2D phone screen.

And I think we can implement it in the daw like...
![Untitled49_20200111231307](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41716684/72618485-c191d580-396d-11ea-9388-33d8a115609e.png)
The user can access the VB via the track's drop-down menu, something like '[track name] > Open Keyboard'. The keys are highlighted to match the user-defined scale and the notes overview have been moved on to the timeline, as it no longer needed for navigating around the project. And similar to grandtophone, the velocity (it could be volume or filtergate depending no the plugin i think) of each key is determined by how close user hit the vertical middle of said key. This way the playing dynamics can be more expressive and reliable AND can be supported by more devices, since it doesn't reqpuire 3D touch or other fancy hardware to function. 

 Another idea (though a bit borderline featureCreep) is that first key could become like a editable held-down buttons to add another layer of expressions, like adding sustain or tremolo to the currently playing notes (I might or might not be influenced by the Ondophone making this), things that people might find difficult to pull off on a touch screen:

The Keyboard menu could contains options to change octaves, customise the key-switch-things and maybe the option to hide all the off-scale notes, in case the keys are too cramped:

Overall, I think that it would increase the creative process of users a lot, as they can quickly place notes in recordings or just to test out a melody of sorts. 

EDITs: Up the quality of pictures, also just pretending that no one had read this and casually rewrite moreorless the whole thing
So I just discovered this project, and it feels like it could be really useful if I spent enough time with it, but my muscle memory from a decade of using other programs is tripping me up pretty bad right now and I have a few questions. (I'm using the current 64-bit Windows master build.)

## Things I LOVE
- The circular chord tool. I keep inserting random notes by mistake, though. 
- The way you can use the arrow keys to nudge notes around. That's a really interesting concept and if there was a modifier key that let you edit length too, it'd be perfect.
- The fact that it's just a single EXE with no installer. I wish more programs did this, hats off to you.

## Things that frustrate me
- Are there keyboard shortcuts for switching between the tools? (For example, [Sekaiju](https://openmidiproject.osdn.jp/index_en.html), another somewhat minimalistic MIDI editor, binds D to draw, E to erase, and S to select, allowing for quick input, correction of mistakes, and shifting around of notes.) 
- When I press space, the playhead moves a few pixels and freezes for about a second before continuing on.
- Can you toggle the quill/note insert behavior to change start position and not length? I get how you might think this is better UI design, but it's just making my skin crawl. (Or alternately, use a modifier key.)
- Why is there a paint roller button that changes which lines are highlighted? 
- Why is there a button for deleting notes when you can just use the delete key on your keyboard?
- Are any of these buttons and functions documented? OpenMPT has a really good [wiki](https://wiki.openmpt.org/Manual:_Patterns) that has helped me countless times.
Hi, awesome project!
I really would like to use Helio as a way to sequence external synths. Is it possible to send the note and velocity data out a normal midi jack of an external sound card?
I found the "MIDI Output" in the settings of a loaded VST plugin, but no way to configure the port etc.
Thank you!

Software Version: Helio Workstation v2.3 x64[Portable]
Export File: .MID/.MIDI
Issue: Sound levels too low on export

When exporting any song I input to .MIDI or .MID, the output volume is far lower than when I'm editing any song, making it incredibly difficult to hear any songs when I choose to publish them after the export.

I can however export to .WAV, convert that and have no problem with the audio levels when playing them back.
Hi,

i'm experimenting with eg Kushview Element (VST HOST only, modular design) a lot but it lacks of a Midi Sequencer. It would be absolutely great if there comes a VST version of Helio workstation near future!

Any plans like that?

Add a window about the program 
This step allows users to identify project information, host new contributors, and even an error reporting button and a donation button
Add a window to collect error information and send it to the team to correct the problem 
With the possibility to allow the user to comment on the problem from the same window/dialog
Added support for dealing with audio files such as MP3 and support for dealing with quotes tools from known programs such as Audacity and Ardur And LMMS
Alt+3 only splits a note but doesn't allow to move parts.
