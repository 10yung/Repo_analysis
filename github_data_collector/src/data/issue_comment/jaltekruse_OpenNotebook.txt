I have downloaded and unzipped the files for this program but I do not see an executable file to run it. What am I doing wrong? Is there a OpenNotebook.exe?
I love this program!  As a math teacher, it's very useful, and I have already started promoting it to my colleagues.  The one issue I have is that when I create a new graph (generate a coordinate grid), the x-axis values are placed above the x-axis, instead of below it.  For elementary students, it's customary for the x-axis labels to be placed below the x-axis.  I can't find a way to change the placement of these values.  Can this option be added?  I am attaching a photo which shows what I mean.  Thanks for all your hard work on this valuable project!
