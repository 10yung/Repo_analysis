In the detect_obects function we have :

    list_boxes = model(img, nms_thresh)
    
    # Make a new list with all the bounding boxes returned by the neural network
    boxes = list_boxes[0][0] + list_boxes[1][0] + list_boxes[2][0]

In the last line, why do we need to concatenate the 3 terms ? What do they represent ?
    
adding the link which will give the real experience of running the program.
The link can be created using lod-tools.

If it's a real time detection code, it would be better to upload a .py file along with the notebook file.
