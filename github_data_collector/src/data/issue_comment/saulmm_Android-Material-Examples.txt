Replicating some parts of the lollypop dialer app basing on the material design principle: Motion provides meaning



How much is the support the smallest minSdkVersion under ah

When I try to build the project in Android Studio, I get following error
android-apt-compiler: [main] invalid resource directory name: D:\Working\Android\workspace\MaterialExamples\app\src\main\res/transition


change "classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.1.0'"

I am trying to import this project in my Android Studio version 1.02 and unable to open it as it is not able to find gradle.
