Hi,

i get this error every time i run the script "The number of users is different than the number of passwords! This is most likely due to a regex mismatch".

I ma running Win7 in a VM with only 1 User on the system and latest Google Chrome.
I ran the script in 32bit powershell.

What is the issue here?
+ Script now finds and runs all 'Login Data' databases.  No more providing path DB.
+ Provided parameter for alternative output format.  This output is more PowerShell-like and easily manipulatable.

I added a lot more comments than were needed.  Feel free to remove some.
