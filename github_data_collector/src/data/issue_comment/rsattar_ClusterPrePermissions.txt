Can this be installed via Carthage (in an Objective-C app)?

I received this warning when I recently submitted an app that uses ClusterPrePermissions from the app store:

> This app attempts to access privacy-sensitive data without a usage description. The app's Info.plist must contain an NSCalendarsUsageDescription key with a string value explaining to the user how the app uses this data.

I'm not using the Calendar permissions at all, I'm only using microphone permissions.
In my project running 9.0, I imported ClusterPrePermissions, but I got dozens of warnings of deprecations (UIAlertView, ALAuthorizationStatus, ALAssetsLibrary, etc.). I'm not sure how open source code is supposed to deal with OS version changes, so what is the best way to deal with this, and does this warrant an issue in the future? Thanks.

I am using showPushNotificationPermissionsWithType method for a pre-validation of the push notifications. 
The first time the method is executed works fine. But if I request again the permission check then, the result is always false. 

I changed the 
            completionHandler((status == ClusterAuthorizationStatusUnDetermined),
 to 
            completionHandler((status == ClusterAuthorizationStatusAuthorized),

 and worked for me.

ClusterPrePermissions now supported Photo Library/Camera/Microphone/Contacts List/Events/Location, did you have a plan to support Bluetooth permissions?


If user denies access in system dialog and then tries to use the function that requires permission. ClisterPermissions will not show dialog and return a negative result without interaction.

It is logical in this situation to show the pre-permission dialog and if user tap "Give access" open Settings (UIApplicationOpenSettingsURLString)?
Developer won't have to implement whole opening of UIApplicationOpenSettingsURLString and leave it to ClusterPermissions.

With Xcode 7 no longer supporting iOS 7 simulators, I think the writing is on the wall for iOS 7 support. Also, since June 1, 2015, [we have been required to submit our apps with at least the iOS 8 SDK](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12172014b).

Is there a way to customize the permission dialog, the first dialog not the system dialog?
