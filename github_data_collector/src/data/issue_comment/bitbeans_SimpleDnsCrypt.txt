I would suggest, and request, a text search box in the 'Resolvers' screen to quickly sort through them.
It is sort of a hassle reading the names of all 60 servers to find the slow ones listed in the query log.

Thank you

Like the forwarding.
Some sites have DNS records only on resolvers in the specified country.
I can't seem to get [time based filters](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Filters#time-based-filters) working at all? If I try to manually add them to the config file they are removed each time I apply settings.
I'm sorry if this has already been asked before, I've searched through the issues and couldn't find anything on it.

With `dnscrypt-proxy`, you have the ability to use Automatic Mode while still blocking the use of certain resolvers. (In my case Cloudflare, Google, and a couple others.)

Is that possible with Simple DNSCrypt? Because I can't seem to find any options for it.

Note: I have to use the portable version mentioned [here](https://github.com/bitbeans/SimpleDnsCrypt/issues/373#issuecomment-447745415), because for some odd reason UAC refuses to appear with the installer. I'll literally sit there for around half an hour and UAC simply refuses to appear for the installer.
I first tried using automatic mode as is default, which is supposed to automatically select the fastest resolvers. But it just picked two resolvers, doh-crypto-sx and qualitology.com, the former not being very good and the latter being SUPER slow taking at least 5 seconds to resolve (and the domain is "for sale" so I don't understand how it's even working), _and it used the slower one most of the time_!

So I manually selected only cloudflare and that is working fine.
Cannot open any network industry after setting all, it shows that the connection has been reset

There are several issues with Forwarding Rules

### 1. Forwarding rules are not displaying in the Simple DNSCrypt interface after their initial creation.

1. Creating forwarding rules
2. Exit Simple DNSCrypt
3. Restart Simple DNS Crypt
4. No forwarding rules are displayed (still in forwarding-rules.txt)

### 2. Importing Forwarding Rules does not see to work at all

1. Click "Import existing forwarding rules"
2. Select a forwarding rules txt file
3. Wait
4. No rules are added. forwarding-rules.txt does not change

### 3. After rebooting, the contents of forwarding-rules.txt is wiped

1. Add forwarding rules
2. Reboot
3. forwarding-rules.txt is empty
User looses ability to perform ANY dns queries when the client is uninstalled. Requires manually setting DNS settings again (found in static IP configuration, not checked against DHCP configuration)
Thats a no-go
Expected:
The program window is resized to the size most comfortable for the user, the size is remembered on window close and restored when the window is open next time.

Current behaviour:
The program doesn't remember its last window size, when the window is open again, its size is reset to default.
