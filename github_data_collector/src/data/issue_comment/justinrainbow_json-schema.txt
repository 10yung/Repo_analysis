In some cases php-7.4 warns that in CollectionContraint.php (lines 93 and 122) `$schema->items` used as array, but it is actually just 'true' (boolean)
Solution: check it beforehand with 'is_array'

Note: this problem happens when I use draft-07 for schema validation: eg
`validate-json json-schema-draft-07.json json-schema-draft-07.json`
1. Since we've pinned HHVM to 3.18, and the tests are passing, we should probably take it out of allowed failures now.

2. Nightly was failing to install dependencies (because, quite rightly, people have marked their code as not working on PHP 8 yet). We can instruct composer to ignore PHP version requirements.

3. No interaction mode is already enabled due to travis setting an env variable that enforces it.

üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇ Personally, I would not use the `@Symfony` ruleset, but instead configure fixers one by one. I do this with [`localheinz/php-cs-fixer-config`](https://github.com/localheinz/php-cs-fixer-config), which allows me to re-use a configuration for `friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer` across projects. Together with https://dependabot.com, this works excellent, by the way, in keeping projects updated with a consistent configuration.
php-cs-fixer is still trying to apply new, breaking changes to the source - in this case it's removing parts of the documentation comments - despite #537 which was explicitly intended to prevent this.
