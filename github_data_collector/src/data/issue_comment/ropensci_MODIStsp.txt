Hello,

Firtsly, thanks for developing MODIStsp.
Until now, I had never had problems using MODIStsp. Recently, I encountered an error. 
Initially, I thought it was GDAL. But I installed GDAL and the error persists. I have also reinstalled MODIStsp several times.

Please see the error message below (Report). 

Thank you in advance. 

Oliver.

Hello,

I'm trying to install the package on my MacOS system and followed the instructions in the README file.
At following point I get the error that there is no --with-x11 flag.

`2. Install the cairo library with x11 support. Enter the following into your terminal:

~$ brew uninstall --force cairo --ignore-dependencies
~$ brew cask install xquartz
~$ brew install --with-x11 cairo`

I googled it and it says something about writing own tabs. I'm not an expert at this and just want to use the tool.
Does anyone know the alternative lines to install cairo with x11?

Best and thank you,

Johannes

Hi,

I'm experiencing problems while downloading MODIS data using MODIStsp() in R.

[Sun Nov 17 17:54:46 2019] Processing Terra LST_Day_1km files for date: 2014_01_01
Error in gdal_chooseInstallation(hasDrivers = of) : 
  No installations match.
In addition: Warning message:
In system(cmd, intern = TRUE) :
  running command '"C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\gdalbuildvrt.exe" -sd "1" -srcnodata "0" -vrtnodata "0" "...\RtmpuOc27T/mstp_temp\file412c14fa134e.vrt" "...\RtmpuOc27T/MODIStsp/HDFs/MOD11A1.A2014001.h18v02.006.2016179224152.hdf"' had status 1

This is the error which occurs every time. I checked all the environmental paths, packages and checked the GDAL installation and version in R itself. Everything seems to work fine, but the gdal_chooseInstallation keeps stating there is no match... 

Do you have a solution for this? (I already re-installed R, R studio, all packages and OSGeo4W64) I'm using Windows 10.

I can provide more information if needed.

Thank you in advance.
Running revdep checks for current rgdal on R-Forge - see:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-geo/2019-November/027801.html

shows the errors in the attached test log, related to use of PROJ&/GDAL3
and required changes to sp and rgdal. If useful find a regerence to a docker
image in this thread:

https://github.com/r-spatial/discuss/issues/28

Changes will occur quite fast, and packages need to be prepared.

Hello, 
I downloaded the QA for vegetation index (VI) MOD13Q1_QA. I got 4 classes per tiles (0,1,2,3), but I can relate these value with MODIS documentation ? Any help to understand what each classe significate ?

Hello professor and researcher, I am Rodolpho, post graduating in meteorology in Brazil and you could ask an email question about your time series automation package ?!
First question: Can you add new MODIS products for GUI download
Second question: I have observed all the processes and there is no way to go wrong, but in MODIStsp_extract to extract the time series of values mean and standard deviation in the different polygons occurs
Error in .local (.Object, ...):

Thank you for your attention and availability Professor!

I'm testing **rgdal** and its reverse dependencies with PROJ 6 and -DACCEPT_USE_OF_DEPRECATED_PROJ_API_H. The CRS offered by PROJ >= 6 are changing, so that even though **rgdal** is still using the proj_api.h interface (for a few more months), the underlying CRS parameters are changing. Since few are using PROJ 6 yet, you have some time to fix this as **rgdal** will be built with < PROJ 6 metadata files in most cases. However, PROJ 6 was released 1 March, so you'll need to adapt. I attach my check files:

Great package! I have just 1 question, while running the package I saw written that QA's were computed. In my PC several folders were created. In which folder the 'corrected' images of MODIS are? Or should I make something else (e.g. use another package) in order to take the good quality images?
When working non-interactiveli.  (e.g., using an options file) it would be better to allow at least some parmaters to be specified from command line. For example: 

- [ ] Start and End Date
- [ ] Bounding Box (if spatial file not specified)
- [ ] Ouput folders
- [ ] Output options (format, compression, etcetera)
- [ ] ....
I am trying to use MODIStsp for running a large batch job on a remote Linux server while logged in via ssh, i.e. solely on the command line without access to a graphical user interface.  I am using the standalone bash/Rscript version. Unfortunately without an available X11 output, both the installation and (after successfully installing the package via X11 forwarding) the loading of MODIStsp fail due to the requirements of loading the GTK/cairoDevice, even when one is interested in only using the package from the command line entirely without GUI. This is true both for an interactive session and when calling the standalone bash/Rscript version directly from the command line without GUI. See below for an example. 

Is this a known issue? Or can MODIStsp not be used in command line-only mode logged into a server due to its dependencies on GTK? Is there a workaround other than forwarding X11 to the local host (everything works fine when doing the latter but for various reasons I'd prefer not to do that)? I imagine ideally the GTK libraries should only be loaded if the user requests the GUI and remain unloaded as long the user works on the command line.

Example of simply trying to load the package without X11 forwarding:
```
> library(MODIStsp)
