Hi,

plain text version should be encapsulated with pre tag in order do display tabs.
Is there a way to limit the mailbox size and drop old emails? I would like to prevent mailcatcher to consume all available disk space.
It would be extremely useful if MailCatcher kept the browser synchronized with latest mail that's been received.

Is there any way to do this? If not, please consider it a request for a new option/action to always show latest. Then you can just keep the page open and don't have to interact with it to preview changes.
This is my first shot at adding an option to change the 'MailCatcher' title to be able to see the difference between multiple mailcatcher instances. I couldn't decide if it only should be an addition that it should be able to replace the whole title. In the end I settled for an addition, as it keeps the 'branding' in place.

See feature: https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/issues/320

Please tell me if this is a valid fix for the issue, or that it needs to be done differently.
Hi,

On a plain text mail, Plain Text tab displays HTML.
On a HTML mail, Plain Text tab displays HTML and HTML tab displays plain text.

This is just weird and should be easy to fix I guess. :smiley: 
TODO: You should provide step-by-step installation instructions, since problems seem to be quite common: https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/issues/144

It took me some trial-and-error to finally get it running.
I added a badge of Travis CI.
So that the result of Travis CI can be known from README.
The branch of the target is master.
