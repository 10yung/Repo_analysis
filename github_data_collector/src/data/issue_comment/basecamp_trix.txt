I'm looking for a way to have custom text pointing to an attachment.
I'd have expected the ðŸ“Žattachment button to do that but it replaces the text highlighted with the info of the document.
I'd just expect my text to remain.

##### Steps to Reproduce

1. type a text an select it
2. click on the ðŸ“Ž"attachment" button and select a file
3. your text is changed and you can't edit it

How do I prevent an attachment / image to be deleted  in the storage directory / remotely inside the `trix-editor` after resetting the contents inside the `trix-editor` or in the form, since after submitting the form inluding the trix-editor. I would reset all the fields and clear the fields in the form.. and after resetting it, I found out that the attachment that I have stored inside the default storage disk is now deleted. means the `trix-attachment-remove` is fired each time I submit the form(including the trix-editor)

> this is how I handle the removal of the attachment 
- I use vue.js  for this ..
> this is how I handle the deleting the attachment..

```js 

	let url = file.attachment.attachment.attributes.values.url.split("/").pop();
	console.log(url);
	axios.delete(this.remove_attachment_endpoint + `${url}`).then(response => {
		console.log(response);
	}).catch(error => {
		console.log(error);
	});
```
> And this is how I register the person..
```
registerPerson(){
	// console.log(this.endpoint);	
	axios.post(this.endpoint,{
		form : this.form 
	}).then(response => {
		if ( response.status == 200){
			alert("Successfully Registered This Person");
	        this.resetForm(); //clear form automatically after successful request
	    }
	    else {
	    	alert("We encounter some errors while adding that Person"); 
	    }
	}).catch(error => {
		alert("We encounter some errors while adding that Person, try to check your inputs"); 
	});
}

When pasting an image from the clipboard on iOS 13 that has multiple representations, it can insert all representations instead of just a single image. It may affect earlier versions of iOS, but I haven't seen it until iOS 13.

##### Steps to Reproduce

Here are two methods:

1. Go to trix-editor.org in mobile Safari on iOS 13
2. Focus the field and insert a Memoji from the keyboard
3. It will insert a JPG and PNG

OR...

1. Go to trix-editor.org in mobile Safari on iOS 13
2. Take a screenshot and tap the floating thumbnail
3. From the screenshot markup screen, tap the share button and choose "Copy".
4. You'll now have a JPG and PNG on the clipboard.
5. Focus the editor and choose "Paste"
6. It will insert both the JPG and PNG

I ran into the problem described in [this PR](https://github.com/basecamp/trix/pull/715). I think the solution in my PR should add the nested `code` tags as it worked locally. I'm not as familiar with coffeescript however and so am not entirely sure if this is the best approach (would be great to get a second opinion on this actually). Essentially, this treats the `code` tags as a list item nested beneath the `pre` tags.

I've updated the tests to take the new tag into account. I noticed the following test would fail in an unrelated way (it returned `quote` tags but expected `code` tags) so I've changed this as well. I will see if this passes in Travis and try to change it back if it doesn't.
  - `Block formatting: backspace selection spanning and entire formatted
    block and a formatted block`
It would be cool to allow the user to highlight parts of the text and comment on them. I'm not sure how to do this in the current implementation of trix-editor. The main suggested way forward here was to do HTML post processing, but subsequent edits to the highlighted text would then need to be somehow mirrored back to trix-editor, which seems difficult (and also no longer takes advantage of trix's document updating implementation).

If this could be baked into the original editor, that would be great, but also happy to be walked through some suggestions on implementing this.

When I enable the attribute href with a link on some segment of text, is there a way to allow the user to click on this text to travel to the page? Currently, it seems like the trix-editor eats my onclick events.

Thanks!
Same issue as #663, but still occuring in 1.2.1

When you use an input element to load stored HTML and it has an unordered list in it, any text that comes after the list closing tag is handled as if it is part of the last list item.

##### Steps to Reproduce

This code reproduces the issue:
```
<input id="x" type="hidden" name="content" value="<ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li></ul>This should not be in the list" />

<trix-editor input="x">
</trix-editor>
```
