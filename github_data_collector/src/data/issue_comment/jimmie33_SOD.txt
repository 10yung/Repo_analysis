Hi, we are interested in your work. Our work needs to leverage your method to generate salient area/bbox.  Can you guide me in detail how to use your codes on my dataset? I am really confused because I mainly use python to write my codes now. Many thanks!
I want to train the VGG16_SOD_finetune.caffemodel by myself, but I don't know how to write the solver prototxt.
Can you give me a detailed information about the solver prototxt to train and get the VGG16_SOD_finetune model?
