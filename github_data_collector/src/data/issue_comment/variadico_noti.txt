Nobody seems to have mentioned notifications over XMPP (‘Jabber’).

Each time Noti runs, it adds a new terminal icon to the taskbar overflow.

In regular use the overflow can sometimes fill beyond Window's ability to display them all.

Windows 10
noti: 3.2.0

#### Description
How hard would it be to create releases for those pesky non-64bit OSes?



#### Description
Feature request to show the time spend by the process(es) passed.
For example by adding: ````(22s)````

#### Use case
Give an idea of how much time the process(es) took to finish.

#### Description
While testing this lib, found that notifications on screen coming 1 by 1. Some queue appears. 
If it is possible, that might be better to have a flag or a config option to let noti to render more than 1 card of notification on a screen. 


 
#### Use case
For example, if you start some build process on terminal, and connected to remote server, and wanna go for a cup of tea while script is running... It will be much better to come and see all notifications on screen stacked one under another instead of last one. 

For example 3 or 5. With the timeout config option - that would be great for home automation and DevOps cases.


Omit non-relevant sections.

#### Description
What is this issue about? 

#### Use case
What use case would this solve?
We should have a feature to monitor the process on a remote server.

#### Steps to reproduce
What steps did you take when you found this issue?

#### Expected behavior
What did you expect to happen?

#### Actual behavior
What actually happened?

#### Version
What `go version` and `noti --version` are you using?

There is no configuration file option equivalent to `NOTI_DEFAULT` environment variable. This requires user like me to pass more command-line flags, especially on servers, where dbus is not installed, and `--banner=false` flag is required.
#### Description
So last night, I upgraded to High Sierra. This morning, noti no longer respects the configuration for custom sounds and is now just playing the default sounds. I confirmed that the sounds are still present and working in the MacOS "Sound Effects" window. I confirmed that I am running noti v2.7.0 and I confirmed that the environment values are being set correctly

#### Steps to reproduce
1. Add custom alert sound to mac (I use `TNGViewscreen`)
2. Configure this sound in noti (`export NOTI_SOUND=TNGViewscreen`)
3. Run `noti`
4. Default MacOS sound plays

#### Version
MacOS High Sierra 10.13.1
go v1.9.2
noti v2.7.0
