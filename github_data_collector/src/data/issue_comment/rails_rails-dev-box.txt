Hi, I've tried many things but still keep getting locked at:

default: SSH auth method: private key

Has this happened to you? Would you say is something related with the disco64 machine?

Im running laravel homestead and works fine which makes me think it is not related about my vagrant or vbox.
I think it should be mentioned somewhere in the readme or in the guides that we need to use

    mysql -uroot -proot

to login to mysql. Ideally, it should be in this [guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#running-tests), in **5.7.4 Testing Active Record** before mentioning `create database activerecord_unittest`
