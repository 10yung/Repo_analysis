I see the option to set a pager but it does not seem to be working for me. Is this currently supported and if it isn't, what is the status of this feature?
The overview section of the readme specifices that this tool supports context based auto completion, but I can't find anything on that. Does usql currently support any type of completion, and if it doesn't, are there any plans to do so?
Hi @kenshaw ,
In Linux, I have used odbc+DB2 to connect to the DB2 instance. Thanks for the going an extra mile and providing a Dockerfile for DB2 instance. Can I use a similar approach to connect to Tibero?
Apart from that, Can you elaborate on how to use adodb to connect to DB2 in windows? And can we apply this adodb process on Tibero too?

Thanks,
Chakri
Would be nice if there was a native way to configure connections to use an SSH tunnel (similar to how [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-mysql-connections-methods-ssh.html) and other GUI clients allow you to do this). I know this can be set up manually, but managing the lifecycle of one or many ssh tunnels can be very annoying.
```
usql --set SHOW_HOST_INFORMATION=false mysql:// -c "SELECT * FROM items LIMIT 1;" -C`
# this works (outputs pipe-separated CSV)

usql --set SHOW_HOST_INFORMATION=false mysql:// -c "SELECT * FROM items LIMIT 1;" -C -F,
usql --set SHOW_HOST_INFORMATION=false mysql:// -c "SELECT * FROM items LIMIT 1;" -C -F ,
usql --set SHOW_HOST_INFORMATION=false mysql:// -c "SELECT * FROM items LIMIT 1;" -C --field-separator=","
usql --set SHOW_HOST_INFORMATION=false mysql:// -c "SELECT * FROM items LIMIT 1;" -C --field-separator=,
# all of the above return the following error:
usql: error: --csv must be passed a value, try --help
```

After window switch, coming back to usql window, tab switching problem generally happens when some query is written but not executed and after coming back to usql window and using back space.
1. key strokes- d,f,b don't work.
2. Back space erases multiple key strokes at once.    
I've found on [Postgres `\dt` is not yet supported](https://github.com/xo/usql/issues/57), and on sqlite `.tables` is not working either.

Btw since [there is no standard way to list all the tables in a dbms ](http://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-list-all-tables/), i'd like to suggest adding a usql-specific query that does just that on every supported db.

The prompt is hard to read.
Example prompt:
`my+unix:user_name@/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock=>`
The `user_name` part should be highlighted with one color.
The `/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock` part with another color.
Highlighting the `=>` at the end of the prompt with a bright color (in **bold** for multi-line `->`) would help noticing the forgotten `;` at the end of the command.
When a partial command is typed in readline, and up arrow is pressed, it should bring up only commands starting with the typed text (see how the [Elvish](https://elv.sh/) shell does it).
if usql meet error, should return exit -1 or stderr

for example:
x.sql -- wrong sql
```
insert abc; 
123abc
```

`usql mysql://root:pwd@127.0.0.1/test_db -f x.sql`

 only returns
