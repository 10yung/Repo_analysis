Just updating the README to markdown and fixing a spelling error

hi,

thought you might want to pull this change in. i was trying to use templates from my app as described in the README but it did not work. with the patch it does.

cheers,

Looks like something in Rails changed, as response.status is now a string and not an int. I made sure the incude?() comparison works and also stopped notifying about 422-based errors.

Hi,

I've added the condition to use ExceptionNotifier only when running in production to the README -- as using it in other environments does not make much sense (by default),

best!,

Hello, these changes remove escaping of HTML characters from exception e-mails in the 2.3 branch.

Please apply :-).

Hey, 
as described in ticket no. 87 (see https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8995-rails-plugins/tickets/87), when using exception_notification middleware with Rails, you get an "Uninitialized constant" exception. Lawrence Pit provided the patch, which I just put as a pull request.

;)


local_addresses doesn't exist after a "include ExceptionNotification::ConsiderLocal"

This is because self.include is defined in ExceptionNotification::ConsiderLocal::ClassMethods instead of ExceptionNotification::ConsiderLocal

Hello Rails-Team,

my 2 commits solve some issues with Rails 3 final. Perhaps you could merge some of the stuff back to the main repo.

Thanks!
