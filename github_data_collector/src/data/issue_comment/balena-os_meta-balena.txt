### Reviewer Guidelines
- When submitting a review, please pick:
  - '*Approve*' if this change would be acceptable in the codebase (even if there are minor or cosmetic tweaks that could be improved).
  - '*Request Changes*' if this change would not be acceptable in our codebase (e.g. bugs, changes that will make development harder in future, security/performance issues, etc).
  - '*Comment*' if you don't feel you have enough information to decide either way (e.g. if you have major questions, or you don't understand the context of the change sufficiently to fully review yourself, but want to make a comment)

```
root@balena:~# systemctl show os-config-dev* | grep Restart
Restart=no
```

This is to improve overall robustness.

Will catch cases like the ones addressed by this PR: https://github.com/balena-os/os-config/pull/25

os-config-devicekey failed and crashed with a panic as it didn't correctly block on a getrandom call. No random, no key, no connected device on pi0w.

HUP-ed an RPI3 from v2.12.3+rev1 to 2.46.1+rev1:

root@567d97b:~# hostapp-update -i resin/resinos-staging:2.46.1_rev1-raspberrypi3
[INFO] Checking if boot partition can accommodate the new update... success.
...
[INFO] Deploying /mnt/boot/splash/resin-logo.png...file blacklisted. Ignoring.
....

A solution needs to be adopted to replace the old resin logo with the new balena one only if it has not been replaced by the customer with his own company or product image.
This will allow the supervisor to do interesting things like disable splash screen, serial getty, ModemManager

Has boot time implications, baseline memory usage implications, overall a nice feature.

Needs thinking about how to architect it.

There should be an easily implementable way to capture good triggers of reboot.

`reboot` command is the same as `systemctl reboot` which is what the supervisor triggers via dbus when clicking reboot via dashboard.

```
root@9fc5842:~# ls -al /sbin/reboot 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14 Nov 25 09:15 /sbin/reboot -> /bin/systemctl
root@9fc5842:~#  
```

All these ask systemd to change the state of the OS from its current taget `multi-user.target` into `reboot.target` (or `shutdown/poweroff.target`)

We can have a service that triggers as soon as a request to enter `reboot.target` comes. That can `curl` the api and say i'm rebooting/powering off.

e.g. https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/39226/how-to-run-a-script-with-systemd-right-before-shutdown

This is not the same as knowing exactly what caused the reboot. But this is a low hanging fruit that definitely improves the overall experience compared to what we have now.

figuring out exactly what caused the reboot can be step 2
Both the meta-balena-genericx86-64 and meta-balena-raspberrypi apply a patch that avoids a coredump for 64bits platforms:
https://github.com/balena-os/balena-raspberrypi/tree/master/layers/meta-balena-raspberrypi/recipes-support/usb-modeswitch

This should be moved to meta-balena.
https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/pull/1610 does this on boot. we should do it periodically instead.

perhaps something like once a day should be fine?
The meta-balena-raspberrypi integration layer increases the default initramfs size in:

https://github.com/balena-os/balena-raspberrypi/blob/master/layers/meta-balena-raspberrypi/recipes-core/images/resin-image-initramfs.bbappend

To avoid this change spreading across integration layers move it to meta-balena.
