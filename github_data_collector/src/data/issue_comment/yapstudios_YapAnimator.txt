I added Swfit 5 compatibility üëç
Hi!

This is an awesome library!! Is it going to be updated to Swift 5?

Thanks for all your effort!! ^_^
Dear Author,
    I found your code did not support MacOS as you described, UIKit / UITextField is for iOS, not for MacOS, have you tried MacOS? May i have your update for supporting MacOS?
hello dears,
I hope this awesome library by supported by documentation and more examples...
thanks in advance... üëç
