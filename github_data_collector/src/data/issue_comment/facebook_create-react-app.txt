Someone please try to help me on this
Advice anyone pls ,whats it could be?Cause function still inside of component body and i have no idea what is it

errorType:>>

Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.

Check the render method of `App`.
./src/index.js
src/index.js:65

  62 | }

### Describe the bug

I have set ` GENERATE_SOURCEMAP` to false, but I still see sourcemap files.

```
"build-no-sourcemap": "set GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false && react-scripts build"
```

### Did you try recovering your dependencies?

<!--
  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.
  Let's try to recover it. First, delete these files and folders in your project:

    * node_modules
    * package-lock.json
    * yarn.lock

  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.
  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).
  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.

  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:

    npm install -g npm@latest
    npm install

  This should fix your project.

  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
  Then run in your project directory:

    yarn

  This should fix your project.

  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.
  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.
  Otherwise your project will break again.

  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?
  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.
-->

dependency is OK.

### Environment

<!--
  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.
  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.

  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.
  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.

  `npx create-react-app --info`

  Paste the output of the command in the section below.

### Is your proposal related to a problem?

<!--
  Provide a clear and concise description of what the problem is.
  For example, "I'm always frustrated when..."
-->

I've been maintaining universal-react-scripts, a version of react-scripts which includes SSR support. I've recently been trying to merge in the changes from 3.3.0, but as it stands, it would now require that instead of just asking the user to specify `--scripts-version` with CRA, they'll also need to specify the `--template` option.

The reason for this change is that universal-react-scripts was already applying some changes to the template within its `init` script, with the files stored next to the existing `template` directories. However, with 3.3.0, the template could be anything -- so it's no longer possible to apply this transformation. Instead, the user will need to specify an SSR template from the start.

### Describe the solution you'd like

For something like SSR, the template and scripts version need to work together. To facilitate this, I propose that we add support for a `defaultScriptsVersion` property to `template.json`. Then, the `create-react-app` script should:

1. Install and unpack the template to get access to `template.json`.
2. Check for a defaultScriptsVersion, falling back to `react-scripts` as the default.
3. Then install the scripts and other packages as before.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

The obvious alternative is to ask people to pass compatible `--scripts-version` and `--template` options to `create-react-app`:

```bash
npx create-react-app --scripts-version=universal-react-scripts --template=universal
```

This is pretty verbose though, and will break if only one of the two options are passed. Ideally, the user could just do this:

```bash
npx create-react-app --template=universal
```

Another alternative would be to somehow allow the scripts version to transform the template name. This has the advantage of allowing the scripts to bail on unsupported templates -- but it sounds far more complicated.

### Is your proposal related to a problem?

I'm not expert on software licenses, but from what I gathered, when deploying an javascript application bundle to production and serving it on a web server, this counts as distribution of statically linked software, where I need to follow the licenses of all javascript npm packages used by my project. So when I'm using create-react-app in my application, most dependencies are MIT or similar, which cause no issues. But there is an exception: [caniuse-lite](https://github.com/ben-eb/caniuse-lite) has CC-BY-4.0 license, which states the need to **give explicit credit to the author when distributing the software**. Does this mean that all projects using create-react-app need to provide such credits somewhere in the web application they are producing? Or am I misunderstanding something?

### Describe the solution you'd like

 If so, then I think we should state somewhere in the documentation of create-react-app that the users need to credit caniuse-lite or caniuse.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

I've already [contacted caniuse-lite](https://github.com/ben-eb/caniuse-lite/issues/40) but they say it's the license coming from the mother project caniuse.
Also caniuse are not willing to change this:
https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse/issues/4062

### Describe the bug

I am in a locked down environment with our own private npm repo. We have `create-react-app` `3.3.0` onboarded. Installing it with the TS template fails:

1. npx create-react-app ts-test-react --template typescript

### Expected behavior

New react app created

### Actual behavior

npm modules correctly install and I can see cra-template-typescript in the newly created node_modules folder.
It seems to be looking for cra-template-typescript in 
`C:\users\gilesr\other\cra-template-typescript`
rather than
`C:\users\gilesr\other\ts-test-react\node_modules\cra-template-typescript`
where it is actually installed

### Reproducible demo

Unable to share anything from real projects publicly. No repo anyway as this is an issue creating a new project.

Hi , i am facing problem regrading createing an new project 
while creating new project i am able to fetch only Module and package.json file and rest of the folder like src, public is not being generated while creating react new project early it was working but from today it's not working
