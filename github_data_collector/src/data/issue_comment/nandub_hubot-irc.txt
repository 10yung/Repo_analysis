In #170 / 52fcb1c the hubot-irc adapter was moved from node-irc to a fork, and pinned to a specific ref. There appear to be two problems with this:

1. Because the dependency is pinned to a ref, the hubot-irc adapter is no longer tracking any bugfixes or updates made to that fork.
2. The [fork](https://github.com/matrix-org/node-irc) that has been selected is missing vital bugfixes from [upstream](https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc).

An example of one such missing bugfix is martynsmith/node-irc#452. I happen to be encountering this multiple connection error right now.

Suggested fix: move back to [martynsmith/node-irc](https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc).

I'm happy to send a PR to do so. Let me know if the maintainers are open to switching back.

Hi,

I noticed my bot was accepting invites to random channels despite having both HUBOT_IRC_PRIVATE and HUBOT_IRC_IGNOREINVITE set to 'true.'

Some investigation found the issue.  Line 333 in irc.coffee is:

```
  if not process.env.HUBOT_IRC_PRIVATE or process.env.HUBOT_IRC_IGNOREINVITE
```

This actually seems to work opposite - the order of operations is wrong.  I believe it works out as

If (not process.env.HUBOT_IRC_PRIVATE) or (process.env.HUBOT_IRC_IGNOREINVITE)

So, if you set it, it won't ignore the invite.  This is fixed by either unsetting HUBOT_IRC_IGNOREINVITE which is more of a workaround than a fix, or the following change.  I don't know coffeescript but I was able to fix it in my test by changing the line to:

```
  if not process.env.HUBOT_IRC_PRIVATE or not process.env.HUBOT_IRC_IGNOREINVITE
```

But I'm not 100% sure that's the correct fix, hence why I'm not doing a pull.  Thought I'd mention it in here though.

In #hubot, @arnaudmm was trying to use the`notice` method like:

``` coffeescript
robot.hear /^!toto$/, (msg) -> robot.adapter.notice "#systest2", "tototo"
```

This didn't work because the first argument is an `envelope` object that should have a user or room. This does work:

``` coffeescript
robot.hear /^!toto$/, (msg) -> robot.adapter.notice {room:"#systest2"}, "tototo"
```

When a user quits, the channels listed are all the channels the bot is in, not just the channels the user is in.

Hi,

When trying to install hubot-irc, I'm getting the following warning:

```
.../...
node-icu-charset-detector.target.mk:86: recipe for target 'Release/obj.target/node-icu-charset-detector/node-icu-charset-detector.o' failed
.../...
npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing node-icu-charset-detector@0.0.7
```

node-icu-charset-detector is an optional dep of the irc module you're using for hubot-irc. The issue seems to be fixed if we use version 0.4.0 of the irc module. I see that you recently updated your package.json with this version in your master branch but hubot-irc tagged 0.2.8 still ships with version 0.3.9 of the irc module.

I know that this is not really a critical error but do you have any plans on updating irc module version so we can install hubot-irc without warning ?

FYI, I'm using node v4.2.1

Cheers

We have found that sometimes, when the bot is cycled, it reconnects to the room before its old nick is released, and therefore reconnects with a different, deduplicated nick. E.g., instead of connecting with `my_robot`, it uses `my_robot1`, which is automatically generated by the irc server. 

When that happens the robot will not respond to its new nick, e.g., `my_robot1`, but only the nick it was expecting, e.g., `my_robot`. This makes it difficult and confusing for users to interact with.

This seems like something that would need to be dealt with via the irc adapter, hence I am opening this issue.

Our team is using the IRC hubot way - i.e. create a real slack user for hubot and used hubot-irc adapter.

We have some customized hubot command but recently some of them are failing. I look at the debug code and found out that if the message we send to hubot contains url/link, the message will get changed. 

Say we send hubot:

```
command abc.com
```

And when receiving this from hubot, the message has became:

```
command abc.com http://abc.com
```

Thus will cause our command fail to parse. It was completely fine in the past months until last week. Is there anyway we can avoid this?

Thanks in advance.

I already raised an issue in github/hubot#941, but I was told to try it here. Right now I try to create a Dockerized Hubot instance, but it stucks while launching:

It connects fine to the actual IRC server (I can tell, since I can `/whois <botname>` and see it's connected) but doesn't want to join the channel.

Not sure what's the problem is right now.

You can find the Docker repository over here: http://git.frd.mn/frdmn/docker-hubot/tree/master
