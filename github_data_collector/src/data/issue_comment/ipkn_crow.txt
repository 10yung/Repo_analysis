Hi, I now successfully hosted a page with crow. However are there any existing alternatives like send_from_directory in Flask so as to read static files in a more convenient way? Thanks!
when using the library with boost >= 1.7 it gaves :
**class boost::asio::basic_stream_socket  has no member get_io_service**
so i searched the error , the problem is in newer version of boost i.e. boost >=1.7  the get_io_service is not a member of the basic_stream_socket anymore , i tried this solution i found here : https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/pull/1335/commits/cbba1ebf8fcecb24392f0cc07b1235b17d0de9d8
and works with my , and i think to create a pull request to help if anyone get this error , thanks ..

Hello, how can i return a json response to the client and also add a header with Set-Cookie?
get double numbers from string values

after receiving request ()
Try to process DB SP..
Is there any way to do it in other threads by putting it in a queue without doing DB processing immediately?

```

// Not this way.
CROW_ROUTE(m_lpWebServerBase->m_kCrowApp, "/").methods("POST"_method)([](const crow::request &_request) {
	....
	std::string test = DB.callSPTestSelect();
	return crow::response(test.c_str());		
});

```

```

// Processed in this way
CROW_ROUTE(m_lpWebServerBase->m_kCrowApp, "/").methods("POST"_method)([](const crow::request &_request) {
	....
	queue.push(...);
	return "";
});

void DBThread()
{
	...
	getQueue();
	std::string test = DB.callSPTestSelect();
	return crow::response(test.c_str());	
	...
}
```
