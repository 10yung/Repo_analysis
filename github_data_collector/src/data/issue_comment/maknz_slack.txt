Use `GuzzleHttp\Client::postAsync()` instead of `post()` and return the promise so program execution isn't waiting on Slack messages.

FYI, we move a copy of this abandoned library under the Nexylan namespace: https://github.com/nexylan/slack

The 1.x branch is not touched, with same code and release so the migration will be smooth.

The unreleased change of this library plus other ones are under the v2.0.0.

The `nexylan/slack-bundle` now require this package and the v2.0 release support is in progress.

@maknz I let you update the README to add the reference if you want to.

Regards.
Hi, @maknz !

Thank you for this great package! And for this big job.

As you say in ["Maintance notice" commit](https://github.com/maknz/slack/commit/89ff7b2a75379a326f48f3db839912f38511a44e): **"this package is no longer being actively maintained"**.

But its really hard to find this message (I spend much time myself for understand, that this package abandoned).

It would be better to **mark** it as "**abandoned**" on _Packagist_.
And **archive repo** on _GitHub_, so it will become read-only.

I make a fork [php-slack/slack](https://github.com/php-slack/slack) & will support this great package for open source community.




I decided to use bundle for symfony and it use version 1.7.0 which has last commit in 2015! I even can't set `ts` field in attachment!
Please do it! 
sorry, please close the issue. my bad
Need to know message ID
I would like to use something like this.

```php
return (new SlackMessage())
        ->from("New user request on " . config("app.name"))
        ->content(":bangbang: An user has requested a new feedback on " . config("app.name"))
        ->attachment(function ($attachment) use ($notifiable) {
            $attachment->title("Feedback ID: {$notifiable->uuid}")
                ->content("**You can moderate this feedback right away**")
                ->markdown(["title", "text"])
                ->fields([
                    "Request from" => "{$notifiable->user->name} (ID: {$notifiable->user->uuid})",
                    "Request topic" => "{$notifiable->topic->name}",
                ]);
        });
The attachment is missing some features like footer, footer_icon and ts.
Also the actions (buttons) are not possible at the moment.
