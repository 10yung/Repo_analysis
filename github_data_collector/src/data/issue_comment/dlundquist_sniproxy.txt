Such as:
      The configuration file is rewritten as:

table {
       # If no port is specified the port of the incoming listener is used
       example.com 192.0.2.10 | 166.111.8.0/24,58.48.0.0/13
       example.net 192.0.2.20
}

Indicates that only addresses from 166.111.8.0/24 and 58.48.0.0/13 can access example.com.

I am a C  programmer. Where can I modify this source code to achieve this function? Can you give me some tips?
I use sniproxy for name based vitrual redirect for hundreds of hosts and for the most part it works properly.  I am having issues with one hostname in particular - www.bbc.co.uk.  

Here are the symptoms:

- Initial Query parses successfully
- Subsequent Queries fail with with HTML body error "Not found. Please check your DNS. Internal reference TA-1437"
- Wait 60s (TTL for www.bbc.co.uk) and it works
- Restart SNIPROXY daemon and it works before the 60s TTL expires
- Clear Cache on local web browser

Its worth noting,  those workarounds will only work for one or 2 queries to the hostname, errors will repeat the cycle.   Also on the sniproxy server,  no DNS queries are being initiated to target recursor once entered into this error state. 

A good start is to understand logically what data sniproxy holds on to during the DNS Cache period and what triggers a restart to fix the problem.   

I have tried a myriad of configuration options without luck, including:

- Using a local resolver instead of public DNS (ie. google/cloudflare)
- Fresh install of SNIProxy (sniproxy 0.6.0+git.8.g3fa47ea)
- Tested on Multiple Virtual Machines
- Tested on FF Dev + Chrome browsers
- Enable Debug logging on sniproxy (no errors logged)


Here is an exceprt of the console error from FF Dev Browser

The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol.

...can anyone help me resolve this please? 

Thanks.
There seems that at some point the Debian image Travis is using broke and now requires "fakeroot": https://travis-ci.org/dlundquist/sniproxy/jobs/602559628#L1423
Hi Guys,

maybe someone of you can help me. Im currently experiencing some issues with FOX, TNTDrama and Syfy.

On TNT when i try to watch AEW i have Problems with the Page token.ngtv.io where i get a ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH
Same for sbp.ngtv.io

Both are https Pages.

For Fox it seems to be caused by uplynk.com which is giving me 404 Errors.

If i try to download something with youtube-dl i get ERROR: Unable to download webpage: <urlopen error EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:600)> (caused by URLError(SSLEOFError(8, 'EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:600)'),))
This PR changes the behaviour of permission dropping, by inheriting user's supplementary group if no group has been explicitely specified in the configuration file.

The reason behind this PR is that I need to connect from sniproxy to a stunnel4 UNIX socket. Said sockets are created in Debian with permission 775 and user stunnel4, which means only users in the stunnel4 user and group can connect to said tunnels.

I thought about adding the sniproxy user to stunnel4 group so it could access the pipe, but it didn't work, and I spent quite some time figuring out why it was getting a connection refused even though the groups were properly set.

This PR thus allows using more than one group in the sniproxy user, which is more natural and behaves as in sudo or start-stop-daemon where the supplementary groups are also setup.
Hi,

I have been using Sniproxy several months to proxy data to/from a local TV provider to another network. Everyting was fine under iOS, Android 8 and Android TV 8 (TV Box).
Last week I got a new TV with Android TV 9. Sniproxy does not seem to work anymore. There is a problem with HTTPS/TLS requests. In my wireshark protocol I can see, that Sniproxy sends a reset command after my TLS request.
Is there anyone who has an idea why this could happen? How can I contribute to a solution?

Hi Guys,

currently when i try to watch a Video on CBS i get an Error 404 for the Player.
https://can.cbs.com/thunder/player/chrome/cbscom/prod/vod/canplayer.js
If i call it directly it works fine. I guess it has something to do with the Referrer.
Message i get in the Network Debugger of Firefox is no-referrer-when-downgrade

Has anyone experienced this Issue or knows how to solve it? 

Kind Regards,

Invi
