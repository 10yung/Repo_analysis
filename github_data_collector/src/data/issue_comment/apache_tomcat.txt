I had a situation when driver closed connection because of I/O error, bur connection has been added to the avaialble ones and then returned to another caller.
The `testOn*` properties were not enabled in that case.

It looks like the pool can easily check if connection has been closed and don't accept it back.
WDYT?
Currently undefined values are returned as an empty string by `Parameters#getParameter(String)`, though `null` should be returned.

**Background:**
A query string can contain defined and undefined variable values.
A variable with a defined value is followed by a `=` (e.g. `?foo=abc` where `foo` is the string `abc`, or `bar=` where the string is empty).
A variable with an undefined value is not followed by `=`.
In Java such a value is coded with `null` and not an empty string because the latter is already the defined value of a string with zero length.

If TldResourcePath was already registred during parsing of jsp-config
section of web.xml, the implicit TLD map entries (derived from TLD files
URI) have not been added to uriTldResourcePathMap.

This was not in line with JSP2.2 specification section 7.3.4.
This modification has been done based on the below bugzilla

Below are the modifications that has been done during the task:

1-	org.apache.juli.FileHandler.compress();
2-	org.apache.juli.FileHandler.deleteRotatedFile();
3-	org.apache.catalina.valves compress();
4-	org.apache.catalina.valves.deleteRotatedFile();
5-    External configurations, where you can enable or disable the compression function based on new configurations keys to located in logging.properties
1catalina.org.apache.juli.AsyncFileHandler.compress = true
2localhost.org.apache.juli.AsyncFileHandler.compress = true
3manager.org.apache.juli.AsyncFileHandler.compress = true
4host-manager.org.apache.juli.AsyncFileHandler.compress = true


This PR combines two things:
* Allows quoted parameters for `RewriteValve` config and adds a new default method to `RewriteMap` to allow for more than one parameter
* Uses a `ServiceLoader` to make implementations of `RewriteMap` available in the httpd rewrite module style a-la `int:toupper`.

It is missing a lot of documentation and a few test cases.
# Tomcat - Source-to-Image (S2I)
This resource provides a CentOS-based Docker image that enables [Source-to-Image](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) building for Tomcat. It builds the sources of a webapp and deploys it to a fully functional containerized Tomcat Server. The generated image can then easily be run locally or deployed to a Kubernetes-based Server.

## Usage
1. Build an image:
```bash
$ s2i build [SOURCE_URL] tomcat-s2i my-webapp-image
```
Where `[SOURCE_URL]` is either the URL to a Git repository or a path to local sources.

2. Run it:
```bash
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 my-webapp-image
```
share it for all connections to not have mixed connections (multiple driver instances when fallbacking on TCCL)

Side note: the setters of DataSource(Proxy) should likely recreate the pool when called, not sure it is not already the case but looks fishy so a follow up issue can be needed
