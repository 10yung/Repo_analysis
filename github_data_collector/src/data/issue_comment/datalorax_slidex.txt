Thank you very much for this package. Very useful.  I will use it to convert my lecture notes into html slides. 

My presentations include many graphs and pictures. Some images are transferred as expected:

```
![](assets/img/image48.png)
```
but others are transferred as background:
```
class: inverse
background-image: url('assets/img/image31.jpg')
background-size: cover
```
I could not understand the logic behind this difference. Is it because when there is one image per slide, or if there is accompanying note or text per slide? Being png or jpeg also does not matter, some are background, some are as picture.

Thank you again for the package.
 

When trying to execute slidex using the slidedemo.pptx example, I've got the following error: 
```
convert_pptx(path = "/Users/macher1/Downloads/slidedemo.pptx", author = "A M")
Error in convert_pptx(path = "/Users/macher1/Downloads/slidedemo.pptx",  : 
  All nested columns must have the same number of elements.
```

It seems related to this issue with unnest and tidyr https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr/issues/328

I am using the following versions:

```
> packageVersion("dplyr")
[1] â€˜0.7.8â€™
> packageVersion("tidyr")
[1] â€˜0.8.2â€™
> packageVersion("xaringan")
[1] â€˜0.8â€™
> packageVersion("knitr")
[1] â€˜1.20â€™
> packageVersion("tibble")
[1] â€˜1.4.2â€™
> packageVersion("kableExtra")
[1] â€˜0.9.0â€™
```

I am starting to get into building slide decks in RMD, and came across this package in the wiki for xaringan.

Below is the error that I am seeing:

```
Error in convert_pptx(path = "test-ppt-slidex2.pptx", author = "Brock Tibert") : 
  Result 1 is not a length 1 atomic vector
```

I see #16, and this is the original build process I started with (built in Google Slides -> PPT), but the file above, was opened in PPT locally and saved with a different name.  I was hoping that would fix it.

Daniel, 

Thanks for a really interesting package.  A couple of points:-

1.) For some reason, the Powerpoint images are not coming across into the img folder.
2.) When I bring over the Windows metafiles (.emf) manually as .jpg files and then rename them with the .emf extension in R, they work fine (but not if brought across as .emf files).
3.) The first time that I use the convert_pptx command only six slides are rendered from the .Rmd file, despite all being contained in the .Rmd script.
4.) However, after making any simple change to the .Rmd file, the full number of slides are rendered satisfactorily.

I hope this feedback is helpful.
There seems to be a fair amount of interest in getting this running with other languages. I'm all for it, but at this point in the development I can't devote the time to it. If there are others out there that are willing to put in the time, I would love the contribution. I am also happy to chat about the code I have and how I think it could be modified to support other languages, particularly if you don't have a lot of prior experience with xml code. If you're an expert in navigating xml trees, all the better. ðŸ˜Ž 
I don't mean to post an issue, but I'm just so very impressed by this package! I knew pptx/docx are essentially XML files, but I have never imagined the possibility of converting them to Markdown. I have to say this is the most creative and beautiful magic I have seen in the rstats world this year! âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨
