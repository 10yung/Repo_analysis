Super cool tool you made , thanks @kshvmdn
I would like to see some plugins, (how to extend the `fsql`)
for example

-  `git` : can find uncommit / unstage files  ref: https://github.com/src-d/go-git https://github.com/cloudson/gitql

-  `tag`: can find with macOS file/folder with [tag](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202754) 

-  `exif`: can find photos with exif query
As requested, this PR was created to replace the name property with the path property as an interim solution to relative path indicators.
A simple SELECT query should be able to identify the relative path of a file, which should include its folder name.

Example:

````
fsql "SELECT * from /Users/---/vagrant/jenkins"
````
prints:
````
`-rw-r--r--	5248	Dec  7 14:28:14	b874568	config.xml`
````
instead of:
````
-rw-r--r--	5248	Dec  7 14:28:14	b874568	jobs/1/config.xml
````
what if i want to find which file contains the specific string? just like in IDE.
Would you mind add update support to this tool.
eg.update dest = 'xxxx' to copy select result file to dest folder.
or delete from where XXX
I just want this tool long ago. Thanks in advance.

If I run a query like in the README gif it works:

```
$ fsql "SELECT * from . WHERE name LIKE mkv AND size > 1gb"
...lots of results
```

but taking away the `name LIKE mkv` clause breaks it:

```
$ fsql "SELECT * from . WHERE size > 1gb"
2017/06/09 22:52:28 strconv.ParseFloat: parsing "1gb": invalid syntax
```
Introduce subqueries to be used in condition statements, example:

```sql
"SELECT name FROM foo WHERE name NOT IN (SELECT name FROM ../bar WHERE date < ...)"
```

This shouldn't be too hard to implement.

First step is to introduce an `IN` operator for strings/numbers. The operator will return true if current the value is in the provided list.

The subquery should be evaluated individually. It returns a `[]Result` for all files that _passed the query_ (a `Result` struct holds each of the applicable attributes for a single file). Now we can apply `IN` to this result list.
