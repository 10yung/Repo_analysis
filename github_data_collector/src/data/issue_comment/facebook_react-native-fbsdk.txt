## üêõ Bug Report
The LoginManager callback returns the following 
`"com.facebook.sdk:FBSDKErrorDeveloperMessageKey": "FBSDKGraphRequestConnection cannot be started before Facebook SDK initialized.",` therefore, I cannot obtain the accessToken.

## To Reproduce
Follow the FacebookSDK iOS installation tutorial.

## Expected Behavior
The LoginManager Browser dialog should return with valid access.

  I have created Deferred Deep Links but how can I use this in React native as I have not seen anything related to deep link in FBSDK. Can React native's Linking.getInitialURL() can handle Deferred Deep Links after installation from play store?


I wanna use the custom loading manager on my application, so How can i can be hide the loading property default that provide by this library? Please help!!!
``` jsx
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {View} from 'react-native';
import {LoginButton, AccessToken} from 'react-native-fbsdk';
import get_user_by_email from '../services/get_user_by_email';

export default class FBLoginButton extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View
        style={{
          justifyContent: 'center',
          height: 80,
          alignItems: 'center',
        }}>
        <LoginButton
          publishPermissions={['email']}
          onLoginFinished={(error, result) => {
            if (error) {
              console.log('login has error: ' + result.error);
            } else if (result.isCancelled) {
              console.log('login is cancelled.');
            } else {
              AccessToken.getCurrentAccessToken().then(data => {
                console.log(data.accessToken.toString());
              });
            }
          }}
          onLogoutFinished={() => alert('User logged out')}
        />
      </View>
    );
  }
}

module.exports = FBLoginButton;

```

This code was copypasted from the README. And not work. BUT onLogoutFinished its called perfectly.

### Env

## Temporary Solution

Similar issue was in facebook-ios-sdk
https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk/issues/1102#issuecomment-551872120

Problem solved by adding to project podfile

```
 # Added because without modular_headers error occurred
 # https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk/issues/1102#issuecomment-551872120
 pod 'FBSDKCoreKit', '~> 5.8', :modular_headers => true
```

## üêõ Bug Report
I upgraded react-native@0.60 and use react-native-fbsdk@1.1.1 but I found "Deferred Deep Link" is not worked. Finally I changed the IOS sdk version and it works. 

## To Reproduce
`yarn add react-native-fbsdk` and follow [deferred Deep Link](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-ads/deep-linking?locale=en_US#deferred-deep-linking)

And Deferred Deep Link is not worked.


this is patch `react-native-fbsdk+1.1.1.patch`
``` diff

and it works.
## Expected Behavior

The above is my workaround. 

I have tried to use the latest SDK but, it will build fail. It might related to https://github.com/facebook/react-native-fbsdk/issues/676, so I tried to downgrade it.


when i try to login with facebook it gives me an  error: server_error: [code] 1675030 [message]: error performing query. Please help
