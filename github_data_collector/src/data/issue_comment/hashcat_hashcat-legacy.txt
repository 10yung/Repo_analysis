Fixed missed package openssl 0.9.8 link from debian repository
GLIBC's termio.h is just an empty file with 2 include directives:

 #include <termios.h>
 #include <sys/ioctl.h>

and a comment that says that it is obsolete and you should use termios.h
and struct termios instead - exactly what musl libc does.

since the obsolete interface was replaced with termios by POSIX, musl
only implements the standardized interface.
