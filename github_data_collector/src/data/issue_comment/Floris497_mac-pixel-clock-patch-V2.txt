I have a copy of a misapplied place locally that I somehow made that matches the md5 sum of the expected patch output from the latest commit to master for 10.14.6.

```
md5 CoreDisplay.bin 
MD5 (CoreDisplay.bin) = d4f2aca73c7915c639dbe9a7b9cf5ecd
```
(exactly the expected value of a successful `d4f2aca73c7915c639dbe9a7b9cf5ecd '10.14.6 (18G84)' `)

```
otool -t CoreDisplay.bin  |tail -n +2 |md5 -q
105051509e563ba96f190ed78a52feb9
```
(still the original value, and the one used in the source check)

```
hexdump CoreDisplay.bin | grep -i "bb 01 00 00 00 A8 01 0f 85"
00187c0 20 bb 01 00 00 00 a8 01 0f 85 8a 07 00 00 49 89
```

```
hexdump CoreDisplay.bin | grep -i "31 DB 90 90 90 90 90 90 E9"
-> nothing
```

It looks like this was just a bad patch that was applied?

It doesn't work.say:

followed the steps mentioned in #338 and #339 
it looks like the os thinks it's feeding the monitor 1440p via HDMI but my display simply went into "power saving mode"

the other display (same model) works with 1440p via an active mini-displayport to HDMI adapter.

./CoreDisplay-patcher.command patch v5
Wait and reboot. 

I got patch running on OSX 10.14.6 (buildVersion 18G84). After a system update (I don't know what installed) patch got broken, but still I saw OSX as 10.14.6 (no minor change!). After checking, the build version was different.

Just ran (again) the command for patching (chmod +x CoreDisplay-patcher.command && ./CoreDisplay-patcher.command) and updated correspondingly the md5 included in this commit. 

In my case, I just had to reboot (after repatching), re-run SwitchResX, and select the appropriate resolution (2560X1080) for my monitor (LG UM58).
On Mac mini 2012 (late) Intel HD 4000

Ran script, thought it went fine, rebooted. Got image fine, but then tried to change to 4K @30hz = black screen. Even changing back to previous resolution of 1080p wasn't working. Unpatched, image back. 

Ran install again, and actually read output this time. Shows:

Any ideas?
I get the following output when running CoreDisplay patcher
```SIP looks to be disabled, all good!

Hi guys, patched yesterday and it worked. Just went off and when i wake up today, i got black screen in my external display, i wont even 4k@60hz, just 2k@60hz.
Unpatched and patched again using v5, did sudo mount -uw / before, to avoid read-only, but nothing. Someone know why?

**The code is still the same. Patch seemed to run, but was probably for the wrong version.**
If you are running a new OS, run ./CoreDisplay-patcher.command md5 and ask the maintainer of this script to add support for your system.
