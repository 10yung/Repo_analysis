Hello,
I followed the exact instructions for the Brill POS Tagger in the README but I'm getting 'N' tags for all the tokens. What am I doing wrong? Do I need to train it?
index.d.ts does not contain type definitions for the SentimentAnalyser class
This PR adds a link to the [saasified version](https://natural.saasify.sh) of natural in the readme.

### Context

[Saasify](http://saasify.sh) is a bootstrapped startup that I founded **to provide sustainable funding for open source developers**.

That's why we're making it really simple to transform OSS projects like natural into FaaS APIs which scale funding as usage increases.

### Notes    

- We haven't promoted this API publicly yet and won't do so without your approval.

- **80% of all revenue generated by this API is set aside for natural maintainers**. We do this automatically even if you haven't setup payout info. Payout details can be customized via [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/connect).

- [natural.saasify.sh](https://natural.saasify.sh) was completely auto-generated from this [source code](https://github.com/saasify-sh/saasify/tree/master/examples/typescript/natural).

- This version is a demo to get the point across. We're happy to add you as an owner to any resources so you can customize anything you'd like.

- Things like pricing, rate limits, docs, domain, and website theming are all customizable.

- Saasify takes care of all support requests, so you can focus on OSS.

- You can read more about our [mission](https://saasify.sh/#/mission) on our [site](https://saasify.sh).

### Next Steps

- It's totally okay if you don't want to accept this PR or offer a saasfied version of natural. Our platform is really young and feedback is the most important thing we need right now.

- We're happy to answer any questions you may have in this thread. Also feel free to get in touch via [email](mailto:dev@saasify.sh) or on our [open slack](https://join.slack.com/t/saasify/shared_invite/enQtODAxODA5MzU0NjczLTczOGU3NzNkYTJlMWIwZDkyNjJkOTk3MGEwZThlOWQyNTQxODZjZTExNjAzODJlZDQ3MWM5NWQwMGRiMDcyZTY).

Thanks for all the amazing work you've put into natural && we're looking forward to helping you earn passive income from this work!
I've added functionality for skip ngrams. 

I have updated `README.md` to explain the purpose and functionality, as well as unit tests to cover the main functionality.

The code for padding with start/end symbols contains a sub-optimal check for duplicates. I think this can be refined to be more optimal, but in the interests of adding new functionality that is not already in place, I have committed the work so far.

This is my first PR to another github repo, so please go gently :)
It's been over 10 months since the last release. Can we when the next version would be released?
For example:

```
// Returns ['j', 'aim']
natural.PorterStemmerFr.tokenizeAndStem("J'aime");

// Returns ['aim']
natural.PorterStemmerFr.tokenizeAndStem("j'aime");
```

In both cases the return value should just be `['aim']`.

I think it's because the lowercase is applied *after* stopwords are removed, and not before.
The -f / -fe to -ves rule can be handled but with many exceptions that need to be explicitely set.

1. Words ending in -ff or -ffe you just add s to make the plural.
Sheriffs | Giraffes

2. words ending in f that just add s:
roof - roofs
chief - chiefs
oaf -oafs

3. Example of words using the -f / -fe to -ves rule
leaf - leaves
wolf - wolves
calf - calves
half - halves
knife - knives
loaf - loaves
life - lives
wife - wives
shelf - shelves
thief - thieves
yourself - yourselves

4. Some words have multiple valid plural forms endings with -ves or -s:
scarf - scarfs/scarves
dwarf - dwarfs / dwarves
wharf - wharfs / wharves
handkerchief - handkerchiefs / handkerchieves

var natural = require('natural');
var stemmer = require('stemmer')
console.log("The Road is one of the great fundamental institutions of mankind.".tokenizeAndStem());

output:[ 'road', 'on', 'great', 'fundament', **'institut',** 'mankind' ]
Expected op: [ 'road', 'on', 'great', 'fundament', **'institute',** 'mankind' ]

it is omitting some letters
