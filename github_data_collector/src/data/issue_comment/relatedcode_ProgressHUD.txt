For what I'm making with this, the popup lasts too long. I searched the ProgressHUD.m and .h, but I couldn't find anything. Is there a way?
When run on iPad that in split screen is still put the pop up in the middle of total iPadâ€™s screen not the split screen size 
It'd be great to be able to set timeout to dismiss the hud. Im saying it as an improvement. 
Hi,
I was wondering if you could supply 3x images in ProgressHUD.bundle, since my app is going to support iPhone 6+ and would prefer if you have 3x images.
Cheers
