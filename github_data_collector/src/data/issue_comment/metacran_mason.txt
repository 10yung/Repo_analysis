mason is taken: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mason/index.html
For me with current versions, this gets stuck at the Travis/Appveyor question.  I can select buttons with space move up and down but can't move the questions ahead.  On both Mac and Linux, in the terminal.  In the R gui thing on a mac it works OK.  I suspect this is an ask problem?


I.e. the user can have a config file (or something) that contains the answers to some questions, and then these are never asked. Will need to work out, how exactly this would work.

A template can build on another template.
