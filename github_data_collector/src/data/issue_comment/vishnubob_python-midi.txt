When I try to read a mididump.py mary.midi shows this error

anyone knowa what does it means?


Working for py3.7
When running 
"mididump.py /Users/apple/Desktop/magenta/python-midi" command

I am getting this error:
   script_code = compile(script_text, script_filename, 'exec')
  File "/Users/apple/anaconda3/envs/magenta/lib/python3.6/site-packages/midi-0.2.3-py3.6.egg/EGG-INFO/scripts/mididump.py", line 9
    print "Usage: {0} <midifile>".format(sys.argv[0])

How can I solve this problem?
Since this file belongs to my Anaconda environment , I cannot make any 2to3 conversion for this Py file.


Suggest:

running_tick = 0
for event in self:
	t = event.tick
	event.tick -= running_tick
	running_tick = t

python3
> There are 27 different MIDI Events supported. 
Where can I get a document describing what each MIDI Event means?
Thanks! 
I converted all the print / raise / assert statements to python3 syntax

I converted the `__init__.py` and `fileio.py` relative imports to python3 syntax
Hi,

I am trying to install the package python-midi. When trying the alternatives described (pip install git+webpage) the package does build successfully but when I try to import it (import midi) I get a ModuleNotFoundError.

I would appreciate it if you could please help me on that issue.

Regards,
Mary
When appending events in absolute mode and the tick of the event added is less than the previous events, the event order is kept, resulting in an invalid order if the mode is kept as absolute, or negative and invalid tick values if restored to relative.

    pattern = midi.Pattern()
    pattern.make_ticks_abs()
    track = midi.Track()
    pattern.append(track)
    track.append(midi.NoteOffEvent(tick=50))
    track.append(midi.NoteOnEvent(tick=0))

While, from the list inheritance point of view this makes sense, it does not from the midi file perspective.
The previous code will result in an invalid order of absolute ticks (and inconsistent results in a saved file) and, most importantly, negative values whenever the pattern is set back to relative mode: in this case, the saved file results like this:

    midi.Pattern(format=1, resolution=220, tracks=\
    [midi.Track(\
        [midi.NoteOffEvent(tick=50, channel=0, data=[0, 0]),
        midi.NoteOnEvent(tick=268435406, channel=0, data=[0, 0])])])

I've not yet understood how the write_midifile() actually behaves whenever the make_ticks methods are inconsistent between pattern and tracks, maybe I'll do some digging about this.
The workaround is to do a `[track.sort(key=lambda e: e.tick) for track in pattern if not track.tick_relative]` before actually exporting the midi file.
Maybe it is better to implement `append()` and use bisect_right whenever the track is using the absolute tick mode, but the `insert()` method might need some further investigation too.
Hi,

How can I use your code to extract the meta data: marker events from type 0 MIDI? if not, would be nice if you could guide me to write it myself!

Sorry. I desperately need this and couldn't find email address.
