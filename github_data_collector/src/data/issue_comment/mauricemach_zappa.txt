```

From my understanding it's impossible to do via connect/express middleware, and it could be nice addition to zappa.
Say, 

```
@get '/': ->
  @render index: {foo: 'bar'}
```

And if request has header `Accept-type: application/json`, server will respond with JSON `{"foo":"bar"}` instead of view `index` rendered with `{foo:"bar"}` 
Will it be accepted into upstream? If yes, I can do that

Today i tried to run a simple app to test zappa but after 
npm install express
npm install zappa

i goto windows console with node

a=require('zappa')
i get the error
Cannot read property 'prototype' of undefined
at
zappa.js (65:15)
zappa.js(702:4)


Edit: now running at https://github.com/zappajs/zappajs

Trying to get a sense for where we're at, following the [recent discussion on the list](http://groups.google.com/group/zappajs/browse_thread/thread/d7faad1a0f587874) and the [similar issue with coffekup](https://github.com/mauricemach/coffeekup/issues/110) that lead to [coffeecup](https://github.com/gradus/coffeecup).

I just noticed off-the-shelf `npm install zappa` got broken with the release of express 3.0.0alpha1 so I'd be looking at putting something together rather rapidly.

Has anyone already started on this track?

I was using [everyauth](https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth) lib as middleware, and it doesn't work with Zappa, when passing express middleware object as arguments of context.use.

Didn't see any shortcuts for joining/leaving rooms as well as broadcasting to specific rooms.  Thought these shortcuts are a nice touch. Included dynamic chat-room example.  Thoughts?
