Can I custom like this? Thanks
I think it would be great to have different colours for the dot border and the dot fill color.
Hello,

Have successfully added this control to an Obj C project but am unable to see the func set(progress: Int, animated: Bool) from my class.

Is this a limitation or is there workaround to get the control to animate?
Your lib is so cool :)) But can you support more animation like zoom (zoom at current circle).
Thanks !
