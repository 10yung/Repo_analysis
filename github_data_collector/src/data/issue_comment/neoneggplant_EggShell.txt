Please help me. I can get the bash command to connect, but after this the whole thing collapses. I expected it to open a shell for me to make commands on, but it just crashes and gives me this. I can't find esplinux anywhere on the internet. Please halp.
How do I use Eggshell with Ngrok to hack computers over WAN?
I can not build/make esplios!
theos installed
make installed
Ios jailbroken (11.3.1)
error: libcrypto.a not supported armv7
error: liblaunch.dylib not supported arm64

Not sure it if it has not been implemented or a bug but I can't seem to download a whole directory and can only download one file at a time.
Whenever I try the webcam command, it just gets stuck at “Taking Picture” Any fix for this????
Does EggShell still work for IOS 12 devices or is the exploit closed? thank you!:)
For Macs, the bash script works fine but the payload that is delivered is easily detected and I'm wondering if there's a way for me to protect the payload. Overall it's pretty good besides this one issue if this is a mistake at all. Thank you!
For a class project, we built a lot of testing for EggShell, and would like to contribute it to the upstream repository.

We added some unit testing, mutation testing, and fuzzing capabilities to the project. We also fixed some bugs, including one that wouldn't allow a Linux system to be used as a victim.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thank you!
I am trying to create a payload on Eggshell using ngrok as a tunnel for port forwarding. How do I do so?

I have another question as well: does this work on jailbroken iPhones with ios 12 or higher? Thank you.
