计算meanF是否需要将三个值进行平均？
I only calculate the edge map of SOD according to the code from SOD website? Could you provide the GT saliency map of SOD? Thanks~~
Hi I have found that the DUTS testing set has 2 errors ground truth as mention in [here](http://saliencydetection.net/duts/) that stated:
```
We have corrected these errors and updated the dataset. Please re-download the dataset. Otherwise, you can also corrected the errors manually as below
1. Go to DUTS-TE/DUTS-TE-MASK, delete files ‘mILSVRC2012_test_ 00036002.jpg’, ‘msun_ bcogaqperiljqupq.jpg’
```
Have you updated the accuracy table of DUTS dataset changes?
-Thank you-
