Hi,sonicether.This addon is amazing.
I found in SEGI.cs, the high setting is 256.I have tried to increase the number to 512 or more.But the result doesn't change.

	public enum VoxelResolution
	{
		low = 128,
		high = 256
	}

May i ask what i should do?Do i need to modify other related code at the same time?Thanks
Hi, i was setting my scene up with SEGI when i realised that i had really strange shadow issues with Ethan (and every other mesh renderer).
The size of the circles you can see on the following gif is changing depending of the Voxel space size. here is the result at 30, the only way to have a descent shadow is having the value between 5 or 7.

Any idea of what coul be this strange shadow and how to avoid it ?

I'm on Unity 2018.1.5f1 btw

Hey, 
With the HD SRP around the corner and having checked it out myself. Unity is moving closer to photorealism. and closer to Unreal like graphics . 

And our current project is making heavy use of SEGI . I opneded up the SEGI and shader script. It seemed pretty straight forward at first. But I am having trouble to see where you are acessing Unity Standard shader "_MainTex,_Albedo" and what not 

I was wondering if you could provide us on an insight on how I could go around port in to HD SRP   
Just some API example wher I can modify the texture being sampled and maybe the render Passes 


Thanks a ton :)

If someone digging into the code can figure out how to get SEGI working in VR that would be a huge boon :)

Billboard particles don't face the direction of the camera. After changing Render Alignment in the Particle System to World, problems like random spazzing stopped happening, but the particles still don't face the camera.
