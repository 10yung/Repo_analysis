### What issue did you see?
Overridden config for DynamoDB not working. 

I am using Dynamo DB locally through docker. I am able to connect to Local Dynamo DB from Laravel using the `endpoint` config option as ` localhost:8001`(Running DynamoDB on Port 8001) in the main/global section of the config array. However, doing so points all other AWS services to localhost:8001; which is undesirable. My objective is to use different config for Dynamo DB and other AWS services. 

The documentation has a section like the following:
```
// You can override settings for specific services

'Ses' => [
    'region' => 'us-east-1',
]
```
My understanding from the above section of the documentation is that this package allows overriding config for specific services from the main config which would ideally solve my purpose.

### Steps to reproduce
If you have a runnable example, please include it as a snippet or link to a repository/gist for larger code examples.

File: config/aws.php

```
<?php

use Aws\Laravel\AwsServiceProvider;

return [

    // You can override settings for specific services
    'dynamodb'=>[
        'endpoint' => (config('app.env') == 'local') ? 'http://localhost:8001' : env('AWS_URL', ''),
    ]
];

From windows computer whenever I try to do a request using the SDK:
`cURL error 7: Failed to connect to 169.254.169.254 port 80: Network unreachable (see https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-errors.html)` 

`Can't ping`

Works from ubuntu server. `Can ping`.

Exact same code base. Basically a copy paste. Works if I move code between ubuntu servers, won't work from other windows 10 computers though.
Can you please help me to resolve it or help me to get it work if i am doing something wrong?

```php
use Aws\MarketplaceEntitlementService\MarketplaceEntitlementServiceClient;

$clientEntilement = new MarketplaceEntitlementServiceClient([

            'region'      => 'eu-central-1',
            'credentials' => [
                'key'    => 'xxxxxxxxxx',
                'secret' => 'xxxxxxxxxx',
            ],
        ]);

$clientEntilementRes = $clientEntilement->getEntitlements([
            "Filter"=>[
                "CUSTOMER_IDENTIFIER" => [$result['CustomerIdentifier']]
            ],
           'MaxResults' => 10,
           'ProductCode' => $result['ProductCode'], // REQUIRED
        ]);
        print_r($clientEntilementRes);exit;
```
