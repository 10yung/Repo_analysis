Hello, I wanted to ask if Debian support is planned?

Greetings Christopher
Hi, it is possible to add such thing as bind to interface/IP and IP whitelist? Also will be nice to bind on multiple ifaces/IPs/ports
Thanks!
I was happy to see that it contained a Dockerfile... but what should I name the config-file?
