At.who attaches `<span class="atwho-query">` whenever # followed something is typed but failed to remove the `atwho-query class` if nothing from the list is selected/ Instead we type anything else apart from list. Hence the `atwho-view` is formed at the previous position

Sample Looks something like this 
`Some Data <span class="atwho-query">NotInList&nbsp; Some more data #536 </span> `

Our implementation has values with javascript reserved characters like open round brackets which causes atwho to error out on the highlighter callback:
Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: 
/>\s*([^<]*?)((1)([^<]*)\s*</: Unterminated group 
    at new RegExp (<anonymous>) 
    at EditableController.highlighter (<anonymous>:130:14) 
    at View.render (<anonymous>:1227:53) 
    at EditableController.Controller.renderView (<anonymous>:538:22) 
    at EditableController._callback (<anonymous>:624:21) 
    at i (<anonymous>:3:6336)

    at App.dispatch (<anonymous>:337:22) 

  highlighter: function(li, query) {
    var regexp;
    if (!query) {
      return li;
    }
    regexp = new RegExp(">\\s*\([^\<]*?\)(" + query.replace("+", "\\+") + ")\([^\<]*\)\\s*<", 'ig');
    return li.replace(regexp, function(str, $1, $2, $3) {
      return '> ' + $1 + '<strong>' + $2 + '</strong>' + $3 + ' <';
    });


The function only escapes the + sign and not the others.

As a workaround I have overwritten the highlighter callback:
highlighter = function(li, query){
    var regexp;
    if (!query) {
      return li;
    }
    query = query.replace(/[\-\[\]\/\{\}\(\)\*\+\?\.\\\^\$\|]/g, "\\$&");
    regexp = new RegExp(">\\s*\([^\<]*?\)(" + query + ")([^\<]*)\\s*<", 'ig');
    return li.replace(regexp, function(str, $1, $2, $3) {
      return '> ' + $1 + '<strong>' + $2 + '</strong>' + $3 + ' <';
    });
};

This should be part of the base product.
here is a link to a app I built to showcase the problem, anyone  know of a work around?

When `.` is the first character in a query, the regex incorrectly matches any character after a closing `>`, not the intended query text.
Hi,
 currently i'm trying to create a facebook style tagging system with tinymce3 editor(i don't have a choice to upgrade to 4th version) and i'm following this example here https://github.com/ichord/At.js/wiki/usage-with-TinyMCE. The problem is i'm not able to initiate the facebook style dropdown tagging system as i type in the editor. can anyone help me with this.
the code i tried so far:

```
tinyMCE.onAddEditor.add(function(mgr, ed) {
        var editor = $('#' + ed.editor + '.atjs');
        var names = ["Jacob","Isabella","Ethan","Emma","Michael","Olivia","Alexander","Sophia","William","Ava","Joshua","Emily","Daniel","Madison","Jayden","Abigail","Noah","Chloe","你好","你你你", "jeremy"];
        if (editor.length == 1) {
          ed.onInit.add(function(ed, l) {
            $(ed.contentDocument.activeElement).atwho({at: "@",data: "names"});
          });
        }
      }); 
```
Only 5 options are showing , how to increase the size.
When i am add multiple at value like @ and p@ it works fine with @ but not work with p@.
p@not works first time but when i select next time it works.

How to use both At value
When we at mention user and navigate using alt+left the research happens on alt keyup. how do we prevent it? Overriding the event doesn't fix the issue. For reference the event called was 'keyUp.atwhoInner'.
