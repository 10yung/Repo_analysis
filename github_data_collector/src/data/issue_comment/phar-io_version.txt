Following code is generally not valid from a static perspective (note: still works at runtime)

```php
interface MyMarker
{
}

try {
} catch (MyMarker $e) {
}
```

The rationale is that the contract to be followed for a symbol to be used in a `catch ()` is that it should implement `Throwable`.

In practice, the idea is that the interface should be extending `Throwable`:

```php
interface MyMarker extends Throwable
{
}
```

This currently affects following:

While it is arguable whether or not the string `7.0.28-1` is semver compliant, we obviously have to face reality and deal with it.
