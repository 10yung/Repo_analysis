Added more comprehensive tests for Problem 31 from S99

Hi,
while solving one of the S99 problems, I came up with a solution that passed all the tests but failed for some edge cases not covered by them. I added some additional constraints to `P28Spec.scala`.

I also added some missing type parameters caught by my IDE, made the lines a little shorter and removed some redundant imports.

The given solution can't handle situation when List is made from only one element, list contains elements that are not repeated, or if the last element is not repeated.

Use `solutions` val in exercises to collect different solutions following the commit https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/scalania/commit/abad695f34f7f80d66d4b9b82adbc324fd3910d0.
