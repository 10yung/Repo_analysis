I use the following js as an action to be fired after request execution:
`const a=getVariable("myList");`
where myList is a selection menu. 

http request is not being executed until I click on selection menu.
Hi,

Able to have a wiki on how to build this? e.g. import and compile in Android Studio
I had difficulties importing it. Thank you.
Enable security (like Androidâ€™s Biometric API) on execution of a shortcut. 
Function to be set on shortcut level so it can be activated per shortcut. 
If not possible per shortcut, make it general on executionof the tool. 

Some examples of implementation:

I use your app for kodi shortcuts. Custom icons are very relevant and widgets don't need to show label under them. Ex: I'd like to have a play/pause button without the text play pause under it.
Very nice app, congratulations !
I found a small bug when using the "curl export" feature of an action.

When a GET request is exported as curl it shows "-X POST" which would execute a POST request in curl.

Could you take a look? Thank you very much!
I tried to set my base URL (something like "http://server.com/") as a variable but when using this variable in a shortcut I cannot save it because the URL validation fails. I have to begin the URL with "http://{shortcut}", that works.

I am using version 1.25.0 and also added a comment to https://github.com/Waboodoo/HTTP-Shortcuts/issues/70 but as this is already closed I opened this ticket here.

Would be nice if you could solve this problem. Thank you very much for this great App!
Hi i'm very new to HTTP-Shortcuts and in like it very much. My requests to an RESTAPI return some values:

1) i would like to see the return values (like Temperature in the shortcut-list 
2) could color change according return value (like button etc...)

is that possible, might that be possible ?

Thanks in advance
