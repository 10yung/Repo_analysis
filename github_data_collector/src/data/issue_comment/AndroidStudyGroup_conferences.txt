Added info for Touraine Tech '20
It will be great if the page also shows a label **Calling 4  volunteers**, this way everybody can know when an event is looking for volunteers.

A great conference needs a great staff. Volunteering at a conference it's an inexpensive way to have access to the conferences and having the opportunity to meet a bunch of great developers.   
It would be great if there is any functionality to add events to the google calender specially for people using android devices as google calender can sync on every device i.e mobile devices, tablets etc. (considering option of iCalender is already given that can help ios users), hence a better track of confrences can be taken place.

Hello, please excuse the issue but it seemed the best way to get in touch. Just close this if you don't care and I'll get the hint!

I work on Open Source software specially for what your doing - namely, a calendar that the community works together on. It lets many people edit the calendar safely and has all kinds of Open Data feeds (including for when data changed - #9). Honestly, the CFP deadlines is not something we have an easy way to hook up but is something that would be an interesting challenge to look into. But apart from that I hope you'll find this pretty good.

Anyway, the software is at http://ican.openacalendar.org/ and it's used mainly in the UK to run this calendar of Tech Events: http://opentechcalendar.co.uk/

Hope this is of interest and happy to answer questions, 
Thanks,
James

Can you guys do that?
