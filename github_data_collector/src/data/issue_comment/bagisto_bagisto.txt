### Webkul\Core\Repositories\SliderRepository does not exist
I get this error in a fresh install
**Please assist**

Issue #1183 suggests the possibility to switch guest checkout on and off. 
This PR provides two different configuration options: 

1. In Configure -> Catalog -> Products, you can allow or deny guest checkout globally. 
2. If global guest checkout is turned on, you can configure the guest checkout specifically for each product while editing it. 
  - This works for all product types except _downloadables_, as those deny guest checkout per default.
  - For _configurables_, the guest checkout configuration of the main product is responsible, not the one of the variants.
  - Attention: If the global guest checkout is turned off, the product specific configuration is hidden. I added a hint below the select box.

**Change config('mail.from') to config('mail.from.address')**
I have noticed that after the latest release, the installation is having a issue

I'm using Laravel homestead
I have created a new site and specified the php version to be 7.2
On the command line I execute this:

composer create-project bagisto/bagisto bagisto

It starts downloading v 0.2.2
  - Installing bagisto/bagisto (v0.2.2): Loading from cache
    Failed to execute unzip -qq  'bagisto//42eb53d8e2b1a8735d3dd57e44159190' -d '/home/vagrant/code/vendor/composer/c4747b87'

(EOF or read error, treating as "[N]one" ...)

    The archive may contain identical file names with different capitalization (which fails on case insensitive filesystems)
    Unzip with unzip command failed, falling back to ZipArchive class

Any hints ?
