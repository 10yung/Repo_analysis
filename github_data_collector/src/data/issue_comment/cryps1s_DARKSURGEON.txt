Grouper2 - github.com/l0ss/Grouper2

**What does this tool do?**
I'm guessing you know this already since you put Grouper in there. :-)

**How does this tool improve DARKSURGEON?**
The old PowerShell Grouper has a bunch of pretty bad bugs and I'm not planning on fixing them when i could spend the time making G2 better.

**Describe the bug**
hi. great job. i did everything right using the box link and everything is fine in hyper-v. but as i scan inside my windows, i don't see many packages that are listed in the packages section. should i get them manually or i have made an error?

**Operating System/Hypervisor**
1. Windows 10 v1803 
2. Hyper-V 
3. DARKSURGEON_1803

**Expected behavior**
having all listed packages in the my darksurgeon instance.

**Describe the bug**

This is most likely a configuration issue on my end, or a lack of understanding of packer and vagrant. I've extracted the repo to a local directory and placed the preconfigured .box file within that same directory. Executing vagrant up fails when attempting to run import_vm.ps1.

**Operating System/Hypervisor**
Please include the operating system, hypervisor, and DARKSURGEON build you're having issues with.
1. Windows 10 v1803 
2. Hyper-V 
3. DARKSURGEON_1803

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Windows comes with a security feature named ASR (Attack Surface Reduction) which is a set of security restrictions that should be applied to various Microsoft software and the operating system. It doesn't look like this is enabled by default in Windows 10, but I might be wrong. I also could not find anything pertaining to it already in DARKSURGEON. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard) for more info.

Thanks.
