**What OS are you using?**
Ubuntu 19.10

**What browser(s) is this bug affecting:**
Chromium 75

**Current behavior:**
If you put a tab-bar inside a top-app-bar its behavior and animation is separate. It seems the animation behavior is applied to a header element within the top-app-bar, and there's no way to join it with the tab-bar. This is similar to the behavior that's *not* recommended in the MD spec.

**Expected behavior:**
See the MD specs:

https://material.io/components/tabs/#behavior

We should have an option to choose either of the two recommended behaviors, i.e. "When tabs are attached to a top app bar, they can scroll off the screen with the bar and lock in place at the top of the screen." or "Tabs can scroll offscreen on scroll, and reappear when the page is scrolled up." Given that these are the two behaviors intended in the spec, it should be explicit and documented.

**Steps to reproduce:**

    <mwc-top-app-bar>
        <span slot="title" class="app-bar-title">My Title</span>
    <mwc-icon-button icon="search" slot="actionItems" class="notCenter"></mwc-icon-button>
    <mwc-tab-bar>
      <mwc-tab label="introduction"></mwc-tab>
      <mwc-tab label="whatâ€™s new"></mwc-tab>
    </mwc-tab-bar>
      </mwc-top-app-bar>

**What OS are you using?**
Ubuntu 19.10

**What browser(s) is this bug affecting:**
Chromium 75

**Current behavior:**
When you open the drawer, the top app bar doesn't resize, it is pushed to the right, and anything in the actionItems slot gets pushed off screen. Centered headings also get pushed to the right.

**Expected behavior:**
Top app bar resizes when drawer is opened so that elements stay either centered or on the right where appropriate.

**Steps to reproduce:**
In the glitch demos you can see it by putting some content in the actionItems slot of the "Dismissible Drawer with header" example.

fix(textfield): change root element to <label>

BREAKING CHANGE: text field's root element has changed from a `<div>` to a `<label>`. Existing labels should be changed to `<span>` with an ID. `<input>` should use `aria-labelledby` and reference span's ID
