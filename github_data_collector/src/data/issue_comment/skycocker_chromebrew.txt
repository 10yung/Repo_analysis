Compilation options have changed with php74 to activate zip and gd modules (did not test the other ones)
## Description
I currently am on a fresh install, with nothing but crosh window (and by extension, secure shell app) and chromebrew. I installed sommelier, firefox, neovim, and pulseaudio. Firefox works great, but there is no sound. I am only using firefox to test because I want to eventually install Clone Hero and have it usable. Below I have the output of firefox whenever something with sound loads.

I believe this is because `~/.cpan` does not have execute permission.  For example, `cpan -i X::Y` is unable to compile and as a result fails to install.  A possible solution would be to move `~/.cpan` to `~/.config/.cpan` and then symlink `~/.cpan` to this directory.  This solution would require a `xdg_base` package dependency in perl, however.

In some not so ancient history, php7 was a chromebrew package.

I had it.
I discovered that if a user with it upgrades, they get this very exciting error:

```
chronos@localhost /usr/local $ crew upgrade -v
Updating packages...
Package php7 not found. :(
```

Looks like now it ain't there:

```
chronos@localhost /usr/local $ crew search php

... so maybe something needs to refer to the 7* instead of the 7, or whatever
