I find the circles are huge for my screen and I want to change the sizes of circles, but I didn't succeed. I tried to change frameSize value in framework(SwiftSpinner) `(h:200,w:200)` to `(h:100,w:100)` but it didn't work as I expected. Actually nothing changed, sizes were still same.

By the way I really like the SwiftSpinner, in my opinion it's a cool framework to use.

Really weird issue where if I'm coming in and out of a view controller via a navigationController.popToRootController and a navigationController.pushViewController, the 2nd time the SwiftSpinner.hide() doesn't hide the view.  I'd have to call it twice

SwiftSpinner.hide()
SwiftSpinner.hide()

then if I do the push/pop thing again, it still has an issue and I would have to call it 3 times.  It's as if each time the view controller pops/pushes it's adding another SwiftSpinner.show() for whatever reason.  
my code looks like this 

```
    let bgContext = NSManagedObjectContext(concurrencyType: .mainQueueConcurrencyType)


    func doCoreData(progress : @escaping (Double) -> ()) {
        bgContext.perform {
            for i in 1...10{
                let cent : Double = Double(i)/Double(10)
                // do some coredata work adding and updating
                progress(cent)
            }
        }
    }
    
    func orgnizeThings (){
        doCoreData { (cent) in
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                let perCent = cent * 100
                SwiftSpinner.show(progress: cent, title: "loading \(perCent)")
            }
        }
    }
```

calling the orgnizeThings() function will get the core data work done but I would like to to show the user how far the function is done 

in this setup the SwiftSpinner view is frozen
The subtitle label is not working when called as well as where in the dependency do you blur the background and how to change that thanks!

Hey everyone,
I recently got a beautiful newborn at home and it feels it'll be a bit difficult to add some new and fresh features to SwiftSpinner... I feel like SwiftSpinner is due for a new major version that will unify all the changes merged through the years and present the developers with a consistent and fresh API (also maybe some visual changes - there are tons of ideas in the issues section)

If anyone feels like tackling this, let me know!

best, Marin
Hi, i really love swiftyspinner and use it alot, there is very little it cannot do that i need.

But i would like it to support longer texts right now the text goes beyond the bounds of the animation circle, it would be nice if it would expand to hold all the text, or if it was possible to remove the circles so that it was possible to use the spinner as to give information on screen.
Hello everybody, i get an "error" i used cocoapods for integrate sprinner but only works in my first view for others doesnt do anything like be in freeze, i implement the code in AppDelegate with a observer, and property in SwiftSpiner i change a few features, please help me and i add a snippet of my code

AppDelegate 
```swift
	func showWaitScreen() {
		DispatchQueue.main.async(execute: {
			self.window?.currentViewController()?.view.endEditing(true);
			UIApplication.shared.isNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible = true;
			SwiftSpinner.sharedInstance.titleLabel.font = FONT_TEX_TITLE_Diezyocho
		if nil == SesionCBHandler.sharedInstance.currentSpinner {
			SwiftSpinner.sharedInstance.removeFromSuperview()
			SesionCBHandler.sharedInstance.currentSpinner = SwiftSpinner.show("T2J0ZW5pZW5kbyBkYXRvcy4uLg==".base64Decoded(),
				animated: true);//"Obteniendo datos..."
		}
		});
	}
	
	func hideWaitScreen() {
		DispatchQueue.main.async(execute: {
		if nil != SesionCBHandler.sharedInstance.currentSpinner {
			SwiftSpinner.hide();
			SwiftSpinner.sharedInstance.removeFromSuperview()
			SesionCBHandler.sharedInstance.currentSpinner = nil;
		}
			UIApplication.shared.isNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible = false;
		});
	}`
```
SwiftSpinner

```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.33, delay: 0.0, options: .curveEaseOut, animations: {
                
                spinner.blurView.contentView.alpha = 0
                  spinner.blurView.effect = nil
                spinner.blurView.effect = nil
                spinner.blurView.contentView.alpha = 0
                
                }, completion: {_ in
                    spinner.blurView.contentView.alpha = 1
                    spinner.removeFromSuperview()
                    spinner.titleLabel.text = nil
                    spinner.blurView.contentView.alpha = 1.0
                    spinner.removeFromSuperview()
                    spinner.titleLabel.font = spinner.defaultTitleFont
                    spinner.titleLabel.text = nil
                    
                    completion?()
            })
            
            spinner.animating = false
        })
    }

UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.33, delay: 0.0, options: .curveEaseOut, animations: {
                
        spinner.blurView.contentView.alpha = 1
                spinner.blurView.effect = spinner.blurEffect
                
                spinner.blurView.contentView.alpha = 1.0
                spinner.blurView.effect = UIBlurEffect.init(style: UIBlurEffectStyle.dark)
                
                }, completion: nil)
            
            #if os(iOS)
                // Orientation change observer
                NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
                    spinner,
                    selector: #selector(SwiftSpinner.updateFrame),
                    name: NSNotification.Name.UIApplicationDidChangeStatusBarOrientation,
                    object: nil)
            #endif
        }
        
        spinner.title = title
        spinner.animating = animated
        
        return spinner
    }
```
I'm having problems when I do SwiftSpinner.hide () since this hides me all spinner and I just want to hide one of them, is there any solution for it?
Thank you
