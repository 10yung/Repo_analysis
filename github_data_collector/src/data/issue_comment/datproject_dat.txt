## The devDependency [pkg](https://github.com/zeit/pkg) was updated from `4.4.0` to `4.4.1`.

üö® [View failing branch](https://github.com/datproject/dat/compare/master...datproject:greenkeeper%2Fpkg-4.4.1).

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build failed**.




pkg is a devDependency of this project. It **might not break your production code or affect downstream projects**, but probably breaks your build or test tools, which may **prevent deploying or publishing**.

# Bug Report

* Operating system: Linux (Fedora)
* Node Version: v10.16.3
* Dat Version: 13.13.1

### Expected behavior

`dat init` should create a `dat.json` or, if it already exists, update selected properties (such as `title` and `description`) while keeping any previously set properties intact. (I am hoping to keep e.g. `experimental` intact for Beaker...)

### Actual behavior

`dat init` discards all previously set properties in `dat.json`, creates a file that only has the `title` and `description` set.

### Note

A similar issue was previously discussed in #148, but it seems the behavior has since changed (again?).

## The devDependency [hypercore](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore) was updated from `6.26.0` to `8.2.6`.
This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don‚Äôt accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

Is anyone successfully running dat from inside kubernetes? The following Deployment is currently working for me, but it would be nice to avoid requiring `hostNetwork: true`. Also wondering how to best specify the .dat keys. I am currently sharing them from the host which works all right in this scenario, but isn't a very general solution. Also, the node this container is running on essentially has a public ip which might be making this easier. I haven't yet tested it from inside kubernetes on a node without a public ip.

Can't seem to get the root public root for web page. Using beaker but when try to connect it does not display correct root file path. It display c:\ drive dir instead.

Found the bug in metadata.data file when I compare to window to Linux there is 

C:/README.md (windows 10)  vs /README.md (Linux)


I tested Windows 10 subsystem Linux (ubuntu). Work correctly.

# Bug Report

Please give us details about your installation to assist you. Run `dat -v` to see the version of Dat you are using.

* Operating system: Debian
* Node Version: v12.10.0
* Dat Version:13.13.1

I am trying to store a [borg](https://www.borgbackup.org) repository in dat. It creates a file called `lock.exclusive` while writing to the repository and deletes this when it is done. I have added `lock.exclusive` to `.datignore`, in many formats just to be safe, but dat still crashes regardless:

My `.datignore` includes:
```
lock.exclusive/*
lock.*
lock.exclusive
/lock.exclusive/*
/lock.exclusive
```

### Expected behavior

<!-- What do you think should happen? -->

Dat should not look at ignored files and would not crash. Even if it is watching the file, it should handle the error gracefully and continue running.

### Actual behavior

<!-- What actually happens? -->

Dat crashes.

### Debug Logs

<!-- If it is easy to reproduce your bug, please run with the debug output so we can see what is going on. Type `DEBUG=dat* <your-command>` to print debug logs. -->
