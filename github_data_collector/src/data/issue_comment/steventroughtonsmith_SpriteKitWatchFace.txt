The custom face comes back if you set the right settings for the timeout, but if you put the face to sleep manually the normal watch face comes back. I saw on twitter that Steve was able to get his watch face into the watch face picker but it was ‚Äútoo hacky‚Äù. Is there a way we can do it ourselves, even if it‚Äôs hacky?
- There seemed to be a complication with the bundle versions, one being 127 and the other 133. Now both versions are the same leading to no more failed builds

- Updated iOS and watchOS versions for the kit

Can you use SpriteKit WatchFace on PC or you need to use a Macbook?
 
Why the color in watch series 4 is different form iPhone?
I picked HermesPink for the theme, when I ran the demo on iPhone the color is correct, but when the watch app is installed the color has changed!



I was able to compile everything, it's working on the watch... but I cannot succeed to run DesktopShim on the Mac...

I've the error : "'WatchKit/WatchKit.h' file not found FaceScene.h ... 

and of course it's the line "#import <WatchKit/WatchKit.h>" who give a me file not found ...
any idea as google didn't help me there...

Recently an option was added to use a static image as a watch face bg. It‚Äôd be equally great to be able to set a video (or series of videos) as the bg as well.

I‚Äôve extracted the new fullscreen motion faces from Xcode in .mov format, would be sweet to see them on my S2 üôÇ 












I can't see the FaceScene.sks file for more than a second without Xcode crashing. It gives me this long error message afterwords.
