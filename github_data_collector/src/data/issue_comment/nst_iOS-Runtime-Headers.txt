I need to toggle AirPlane mode programmatically using the Private API RadiosPreferences, but I am getting a compile error that RadioPreferences does not support 64-bit architecture arm64. 
I have import below header file in my project. 

```
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@protocol RadiosPreferencesDelegate
-(void)airplaneModeChanged;
@end


@interface RadiosPreferences : NSObject {
    
    struct __SCPreferences *_prefs;
    int _applySkipCount;
    id <RadiosPreferencesDelegate> _delegate;
    BOOL _isCachedAirplaneModeValid;
    BOOL _cachedAirplaneMode;
    BOOL notifyForExternalChangeOnly;
}

- (id)init;
- (void)dealloc;
@property(nonatomic) BOOL airplaneMode;
- (void)refresh;
- (void)initializeSCPrefs:(id)arg1;
- (void)notifyTarget:(unsigned int)arg1;
- (void)synchronize;
- (void *)getValueForKey:(id)arg1;
- (void)setValue:(void *)arg1 forKey:(id)arg2;
@property(nonatomic) BOOL notifyForExternalChangeOnly; // @synthesize notifyForExternalChangeOnly;
@property(nonatomic) id <RadiosPreferencesDelegate> delegate; // @synthesize delegate=_delegate;

@end
```
Here is the Xcode compile error.  
Can you please update the header file or give a proper solution to use this. 

Thanks in advance.

Sadly there is not RuntimeBrowser for Apple Watch.
Hi all

May I ask the community if someone has experience with Private API's and Bluetooth Low Energy?

I wonder if and how I could implement the following two requirements without Jailbreak:

- Accepting a bonding requests automatically without manually approving it (via bonding request dialog)
- Removing BLE entries in the pairing table

Thanks in advance for every comment or input.

Cheers
Is it possible to add XCTest.framework?
It can be effect when we use the iPhone to delete some method of keyboard input through the system's setting. But can we use the code to finish this function?

If you have finished this function,please tell me some details about this. Thanks.
I got this message during a review  by our app update. 

What could be the reason ? 

Thanks !

==========================================================
Your app uses or references the following non-public APIs:

PrivateFrameworks/CameraUI.framework (CAMZoomSlider)

The use of non-public APIs is not permitted on the App Store because it can lead to a poor user experience should these APIs change. 

Continuing to use or conceal non-public APIs in future submissions of this app may result in the termination of your Apple Developer account, as well as removal of all associated apps from the App Store.

Hi everyone,
I would like to know if by including this package in my iOS project, I will be able to actually run these methods - these methods are then action handled my the os.
Why I'm asking, because although we may have these packages, as a user which is in xcode's sandbox, might not be able to request these method's outputs.
