Fixes https://spark-solutions.atlassian.net/browse/SD-704


Ruby 2.7 is out. It doesn't change much, but it brings on some new, cool features. Spree seems to work fine on it, except occasional `FrozenError (can't modify frozen String)` in a few places. It shouldn't be difficult to fix in my opinion.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Some promotions can be displayed on a product, like `Spree::Promotion::Rules::Taxon`,  `Spree::Promotion::Rules::Product` or `Spree::Promotion::Rules::UserLoggedIn`

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

I have a store with a Category A, for which I created a 15% discount on all its articles.
All of those articles should be able to be displayed on the store with their original price and their 15% discount price, like this:

Is there any temporary workaround to do this ?
I am creating a new order from the Api and here is the Parameters  which i got from the Api documentation -:
{
  "order": {
    "line_items": [
      { "variant_id": 1, "quantity": 5 }
    ]
  }
}
 and the line_item_attributes are -: 
 {"line_items_attributes"=>[<ActionController::Parameters {"variant_id"=>1, "quantity"=>5}

 in the filter_order_items(order, params) function in the  services/spree/cart/update.rb  i am getting this issue for the line items .Please help me.

<summary>Changelog</summary>

*Sourced from [thor's changelog](https://github.com/erikhuda/thor/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).*

> # 1.0.0
> * Drop support to Ruby 1.8 and 1.9.
> * Deprecate relying on default `exit_on_failure?`.
>   In preparation to make Thor commands exit when there is a failure we are deprecating
>   defining a command without defining what behavior is expected when there is a failure.
> 
>   To fix the deprecation you need to define a class method called `exit_on_failure?` returning
> 
>   `false` if you want the current behavior or `true` if you want the new behavior.
> * Deprecate defining an option with the default value using a different type as defined in the option.
> * Allow options to be repeatable. See [#674](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/thor/issues/674).
> 
> # 0.20.3
> * Support old versions of `did_you_mean`.
> 
> # 0.20.2
> * Fix `did_you_mean` support.
> 
> # 0.20.1
> * Support new versions of ERB.
> * Fix `check_unknown_options!` to not check the content that was not parsed, i.e. after a `--` or after the first unknown with `stop_on_unknown_option!`
> * Add `did_you_mean` support.
> 
> ## 0.20.0
> * Add `check_default_type!` to check if the default value of an option matches the defined type.
>   It removes the warning on usage and gives the command authors the possibility to check for programming errors.
> 
> * Add `disable_required_check!` to disable check for required options in some commands.
>   It is a substitute of `disable_class_options` that was not working as intended.
> 
> * Add `inject_into_module`.
> 
> ## 0.19.4, release 2016-11-28
> * Rename `Thor::Base#thor_reserved_word?` to `#is_thor_reserved_word?`
> 
> ## 0.19.3, release 2016-11-27
> * Output a warning instead of raising an exception when a default option value doesn't match its specified type
> 
> ## 0.19.2, release 2016-11-26
> * Fix bug with handling of colors passed to `ask` (and methods like `yes?` and `no?` which it underpins)
> * Allow numeric arguments to be negative
> * Ensure that default option values are of the specified type (e.g. you can't specify `"foo"` as the default for a numeric option), but make symbols and strings interchangeable
> * Add `Thor::Shell::Basic#indent` method for intending output
> * Fix `remove_command` for an inherited command (see [#451](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/thor/issues/451))
> * Allow hash arguments to only have each key provided once (see [#455](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/thor/issues/455))
> * Allow commands to disable class options, for instance for "help" commands (see [#363](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/thor/issues/363))
> * Do not generate a negative option (`--no-no-foo`) for already negative boolean options (`--no-foo`)
> * Improve compatibility of `Thor::CoreExt::HashWithIndifferentAccess` with Ruby standard library `Hash`
> * Allow specifying a custom binding for template evaluation (e.g. `#key?` and `#fetch`)
> * Fix support for subcommand-specific "help"s
