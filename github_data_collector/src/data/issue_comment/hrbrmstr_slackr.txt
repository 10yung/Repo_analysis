I added a new parameter to define default locale value 
When I send a message to slack channel acute characters appear with wrong codification.  Messages are written in Spanish language. 
Hi,
I am using history_slackr function to retrieve communciation history of a channel.. The data returned doesnt have actual usernames as column. The current column "user" shows some ID (ex: WAA2XMZEU in place of my name). Is there any option to be set to get the same?
For functions that has more than 1000 records , need additional parameter 'cursor' need to be supplied to move to different pages. 
The example code on the documentation page https://github.com/hrbrmstr/slackr still has `slackrSetup(.)`

(I'm not a regular user and a Ubuntu noob, and was stumbling around in an effort to answer a SO question. I also needed to search out a load error message that I eventually discovered was due to a failure to install pkg:texPreview. I thought that packages listed in Imports were automagically installed in Ubuntu, but I guess not if they require system package support. So should the package DESCRIPTION list Tex as a System requirement?)
Hi,

I can correctly send messages to slack with the following:
slackr("hello", channel="mychannel")
but the delete_slackr function is not working.

I am using the slackr version 1.5 from github.

I tried with both the following and it does not work
delete_slackr(count = 1, channel = '#mychannel')
delete_slackr(count = 1, channel = 'mychannel')

Do you have any suggestions?

Also I would like to know how to delete messages that appear sent from slackr APP
Hi,
I had setup a web-hook URL, and then created config file config1 in the directory where my R code resides as well. This looks like the following (private info omitted):
```
api_token: [my_token]
channel: #my_test
username: user_w
incoming_webhook_url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/[identifying part here]
```

Then I issued these R commands

``` 
library("slackr")
slackr_setup(config_file = "config1", echo = T)
slackr(head(iris))
```

I get no error and it seems like the command was successful, but I see nothing in the channel! The app is configured with the channel and my slackr version is 1.4.2. The channel is private. The app's name is not user_w, but I understood that it does not matter and that you can specify a different user name (it does not work when I set the username as the app's name either).

Also when I issue this command:
```
slackr_channels()
```
I get the list of all channels accordingly so the connection does work as I understand.

I just want to say that if I issue this command in the terminal:

```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"text":"Hello, World!"}' https://hooks.slack.com/services/[identifying part here]
```
 
Then I can see that the app name posts in the channel accordingly.
What's wrong? Am I missing something?
Hi,

I was able to set slackR up successfully and am able to post into a Slack channel. However, it always uses my actual username and not the one I set in the <slackr_setup()> function.

Is there anything I need to do besides providing the api_token and incoming_webhook_url? I set up the slackR app with my Slack account. Also, is there any way oAuth support is coming for slackR anytime soon?

This is my first OSS PR, so please forgive me if I'm doing something silly. 

- Resolves [59](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/slackr/issues/59):  `tmp$ok = FALSE` will now noisily error, and state why. 
- error checking for failure flags


When an `tmp$ok == FALSE`, it attempts to explain why:
```r
Error in okContent(res) : 
  Calling function: slackr_upload::slackr.png::Testing::#general
   had error: missing_scope
   Needed: files:write:user
```

* Add slack_conversations (channels.list is deprecated)
* Pull entire list when there is a cursor for more records both in this method and slack_users
* Use these for channel name translation to id.
