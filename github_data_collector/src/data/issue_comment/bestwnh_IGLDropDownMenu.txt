If anyone think it should re-write to a swift version, please leave a comment to tell me.
If this implement in swift, there are two plan:
1. Just a swift version, no api or struct change, will work fine in your project to replace the objective-c version.
2. A total new swift version with struct re-write and api change, can implement most of(not all) the old functions and some new effect. But maybe more change for replace the objective-c version.

Which one you prefer?

I've been trying to figure out how to close the menu when user taps somewhere on the screen. When users don't pick an option, or try to type something in a textField, I want to close the menu to keep the UI clean. How can I achieve this?
