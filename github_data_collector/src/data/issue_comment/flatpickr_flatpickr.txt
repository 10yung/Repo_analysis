rangeSeparator added
Some times we don't want the year input be an actual input for the header. This PR makes it possible to have the year indicator on the header be a `span` like we're able to do with the month selector.
This PR adds the possibility of making `prevMonthDays` and `nextMonthDays` hidden if chosen with the config variables `hideNextMonthDays` and `hidePrevMonthDays`.
The Malaysian localisation uses "Min" and "Minggu" for Sunday (shorthand and longhand).  These should be "Ahd" and "Ahad" respectively.   See the output of both PHP's strftime() and IntlDateFormatter for confirmation.  Test program below:

~~~~php
<?php

$locale = 'ms';

setlocale(LC_ALL, $locale);

$patterns = array('ccc', 'cccc', 'ccccc', 'cccccc', 'eee', 'eeee', 'eeeee', 'eeeeee', 'EEE', 'EEEE', 'EEEEE', 'EEEEEE');

echo "<table>\n";

echo "<thead>\n";
echo "<tr>";

echo "<th>'%a'</th>";
echo "<th>'%A'</th>";

foreach ($patterns as $pattern)
{
  echo "<th>$pattern</th>";
}

echo "</tr>\n";
echo "</thead>\n";

echo "<tbody>\n";

$dateObj = new DateTime;

for ($i=0; $i<7; $i++)
{
  $dateObj->add(new DateInterval("P1D"));
  echo "<tr>";
  echo "<td>" . strftime('%a', $dateObj->getTimestamp()) . "</td>";
  echo "<td>" . strftime('%A', $dateObj->getTimestamp()) . "</td>";
  foreach ($patterns as $pattern)
  {
    $formatter = new IntlDateFormatter($locale, 
                              IntlDateFormatter::SHORT, IntlDateFormatter::SHORT, null, null, $pattern);
    echo "<td>" . $formatter->format($dateObj) . "</td>";
  }
  echo "</tr>\n";
}

echo "</tbody>\n";

echo "<table>\n";

Hello!
Could you add option to define variable 'shouldChangeMonth' in function 'selectDate'? something like canChangeMonth.

Would like the ability to display the timepicker dropdowns vertically in a similar fashion to Google Calendars usage instead of horizontally.  Is this a possibility ?   I cannot find any config options for this.

Thanks very much.

## Description
When `allowInput` and `enableTime` are `true`, changes to the input field are reverted before I can examine the changes in a hook.

The repro link contains similar examples for a flatpickr with and without time enabled. Only the flatpickr instance with time exhibits this behavior.

Not a bug, just wondering how to trigger an input update when it's populated via jquery IE:

If I have this:

```
$('input[name="example_date_range"]').flatpickr({
mode: "range"
});
```

and try to populate with this:
`$(''input[name="example_date_range"]').val("20-01-20 to 22-01-20");`

Then the value updates but the calendar doesn't show this value when you click it open.. I thought onChange would be triggered by automatically entering the value with jQuery and cannot find a way to trigger it due to my lack of knowledge

Any advice appreciated

Thanks

You can check this in the plugin itself.

I know you can type it directly and use the mouse wheel but is it possible to make it increment/decrement continuously when you click and hold the year up/down buttons? Thanks
