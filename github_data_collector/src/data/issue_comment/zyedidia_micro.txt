No plugins get loaded either =(

Right now every time when "messenger" Message is appearing, it'll stay forever, while it'll make more sense just to show it for 2-3 sec (to confirm the action) and let it go.

For example: 
- you save the file
- Micro showing "Saved .." message
- and this message will stay forever, until any other action with Message will not be involved
- and again, supposing you saved your file once
- now, 1min later you want to save it again
- the same "Saved.." message will remain and not move
- so, it's even hard to say if the file was really saved the second time, or this message was stack here from the first save..

And so on..

Look at the broken indentation.

When I use `micro` to edit my files in WSL, the indentation above seems normal. Wiping the repository and doing a fresh clone, does not change anything about it. In `micro` the indentation seems normal. When I view it with `nano`, the indentation is shown as seen in the above link, which is the actual truth.

You can use `micro -version` to get the commit hash.

## Description of the problem or steps to reproduce.

When a string (e.g. `"foo"`, `'foo'`) is on the same line with other words, syntax highlighting breaks on some of those words.

![2020-01-09-172837_681x61_scrot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17011090/72113329-be5f6f80-3305-11ea-8a75-3096fc51c3f5.png)

As seen in the images, when I remove the string from the line, all the other highlighting works as expected.

I made some tests. When I use `constant.string: "\".*\"|\'.*\'"` in the syntax file this doesn't happen, but multiline strings don't get highlighted. The issue happens if I use:

```yaml
# ~/.config/micro/syntax/sh.yaml.

- constant.string:
    start: "\'"
    end: "\'"
    rules: [ ]

- constant.string:
    start: "\""
    end: "\""
    rules: [ ]
```

## Description of the problem or steps to reproduce
The current state of the syntax highlighting is mediocre at best, and terrible at worst
Given that the leading editor (VSCode) is using TextMate grammar, is it possible to 'swipe' their complex tmLanguage files to get much better highlighting?

Here is the vscode interpreter solution in javascript
it's neatly written and not hard to understand
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-textmate
so it should be rewritten in go which while a big task im not certain it would be extremely comlicated

This is a huge request and may only stay as a 'nice to have' for maybe 2.0? 3.0?

In any case I wouldn't disregard this idea.

[`pledge(2)`](https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2) restricts which system calls can be called, terminating the process on a violation.

Probably not very essential for micro, but nice to have.

Enable softwrap.

Write or paste a line longer than your terminal's column count.

The line is wrapped one position before end of line and continued at the 3rd position of the following line.

This is not about a problem, but rather kind of workaround (or maybe solution as well if integrated or implemented "natively" in Micro ;-))

I wrote a small [CopyBox](https://github.com/dimitrik-fr/copybox) plugin which helps me a lot now, and may be also useful for someone else. It allows you to select text by marking Begin/End of Selection with F3 key, and then Copy it with F5 key into any place you need in your text. Or copy it to file (F4), restore from file (F6) when you want to copy it also to another file(s), or execute it as Shell command/script (F9). This is all by-passing OS clipboard, so may just work (even when I'm opening my SSH session from my iPad ;-))

Of course, you can re-assign key bindings as you like.

Install "comment" plugin, works well with micro-1.4.1.
now start micro-2.0-rc2 => and you have error messages about plugin
```
Error: comment.comment does not exist
``` 
## Specifications

It looks like "comment" plugin is coming pre-installed with micro-2.0, is it so? 
Any changes on plugin API since 2.0 ?
