I make the new one from your code to the individual scanner and review the image controller. People can use it easier and they can custom control UI.

Thanks for the review and feel free for any questions or comments on my code.
I hope all you guys accept my merge request.
I am trying to add a library "WeScan" to my Xcode project manually. I just downloaded the source file from GitHub and by drag and drop, added that we scan folder to my project. Then I tried to import that, but it is giving an error like : "No such module 'WeScan'"

Could you please update this library to 1.2.0 on CocoaPods? I'm using this through a library which depends on this. I'd like dark mode support but 1.1.0 doesn't support it. Thanks.
It would be awesome if we could pass in which camera to use.
UIImagePickerController.CameraDevice.front
or 
UIImagePickerController.CameraDevice.back
Magnifying glass position is under the touch point. So user can not see the zoomed image easily. If i change the coordinate of corner view whole corner view position change. I need to change the only magnifier glass position.
I can detect edge in background mode, but after getting the edge how can i crop the image without going to EditScanViewController? I need to crop the edge detected image in background mode.
pod spec updated for ios13 release
