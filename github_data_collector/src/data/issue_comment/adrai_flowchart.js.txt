I have a lot of elif to show, but now I don't know how to write it.

Maybe I should use the `markdown mermaid` syntax?

Hi, 
    It seems the following chart is error drawn:

```
a=>operation: a
b=>operation: b
c=>condition: yes or no
d=>operation: d
e=>operation: e
f=>operation: f

a->b(right)->c
c(yes, right)->e
c(no, top)->d  // top not recognized; it seems that only 1 direction instruction of 2 branches is valid
e(top)->f        // top line is drawn through operation box
```

The result chart is:

Hi 
I need to show tooltip or else Onmouseover event when hover the Message Area of flowchart

Any possible solution?
thanks in advance.
What a fantastic library!  I'm curious, however, if we can code in js directly to achieve the same output.  It'd be really nice to not have to learn a new language and get the same output.  Here is an example I quickly converted from the README.md:
```js
import {
  start,
  end,
  operation,
  subroutine,
  condition,
  inputoutput,
  parallel }  from 'flowchart.js';
// st=>start: Start:>http://www.google.com[blank]
const st = start({ title: 'Start', url: 'http://www.google.com', target: 'blank' });
// e=>end:>http://www.google.com
const e = end({ href: 'http://www.google.com' });
// op1=>operation: My Operation
const op1 = operation({ title: 'My Operation' });
// sub1=>subroutine: My Subroutine
const sub1 = subroutine({ title: 'My Subroutine' });
// cond=>condition: Yes
// or No?:>http://www.google.com
const cond = condition({ title: 'Yes\nor No?', url: 'http://www.google.com' });
// io=>inputoutput: catch something...
const io = inputoutput({ title: 'catch something...' });
// para=>parallel: parallel tasks
const para = parallel({ title: 'parallel tasks' });
//
// st->op1->cond
st.link(op1).link(cond);
// cond(yes)->io->e
cond.yes.link(io).link(e);
// cond(no)->para
cond.no.link(para);
// para(path1, bottom)->sub1(right)->op1
para.path1.bottom.link(sub1.right).link(op1);
// para(path2, top)->op1
para.path2.top.link(op1);
```

Will it be possible to do something like the following where images can be displayed with chart elements.

Thanks for a great project
Hello and thank you for best flowchart solution i found

In vertical structure condition line set right "No" back to the top. Line from right too short, just 3-4px. How to increase it?
I am using the following script:

```
st=>start: Start
e=>end: End
opy=>operation: statements
opn=>operation: statements
cond(align-next=no)=>condition: Condition

st->cond
cond(yes,left)->opy->e
cond(no,right)->opn->e
```

The `yes` and `no` paths are always `bottom`, `right` respectively, ignoring the directions I've set.

Is there anything wrong with my script?

It would be great to add a circular layout to the flowchart similar to visio. This could function as an easy way to create simple DFD's/Context Digrams. 

Is anyone working on this?
I am using this cool library with react, now have a requirement to add drag and drop . is it possible to use same drag and drop  functionality with existing library and code flow or could add positions of every element . your help or suggestions could be appreciated 
Are comments allowed in the flowchart DSL?
