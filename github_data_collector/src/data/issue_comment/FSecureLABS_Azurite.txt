I am not sure if there is a change that can be made to the HTML, but in FireFox, you can edit

privacy.file_unique_origin

to False and it will run.
added some cli options tenantId subscriptionId loggedInId.  The first two help with automating.  The last one, takes an id to check against to see if that user is logged in, so you don't need to keep logging in if you have an active session
Hey there! I've been testing out your Azurite tool and love it so far! Great work! I have been seeing an issue though. If you have some time I'd love for you to look into this. 

The issue has to do with the scanning of resource groups in a subscription. It look like Azurite is scanning resource groups that are not in the scope of the subscription that I've specified. I can provide screenshots if needed (prefer not to in this public forum)
Running the Visualizer against the vm JSON I get:

I am on Windows 10 running from cmd.
When I ran this script, I received a KeyError: 'vmNetworkConfigurationIpConfigurations' which was a reference I didn't see anywhere else in the file.  I deleted it out, and the script ran great.
The PS portion seems to run fine and produces the JSON output as expected.  The subscription JSON file seems to be properly formatted.  When running the Visualizer against the subscription JSON file produces this.
