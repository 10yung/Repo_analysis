### Description

`canActivate()` has the ternary of `pipe.name === '' ? pipe : () => pipe` which seems to be intended to tell if the `pipe` is in either this format `() => pipe` or `pipe` format currently. If it in `pipe` format then the output of `pipe.name` seems to be `piped` however if it is  in `() => pipe` format the the result of `pipe.name` is actually the name of the function which appears to what has been overlooked with the original logic as `pipe.name` never seems to be an empty string.

Adjusting to `pipe.name !== 'piped' ? pipe : () => pipe` should fix this issue in all situations unless the name of the function is `piped` which would result in `authGuardPipe` being set to `() => () => pipe` which in my testing seems to behave has expected still activating the pipe however I am unsure of the exact ramifications of this.

I have only been playing with this for about an hour or two, so if there is something I am missing definitely let me know.

Since v7.6.0, the `CollectionReference` for Firestore in firebase-js-sdk has supported a `withConverter` method that allows the specification of a converter object that will automatically map `DocumentData` from firestore into application types. I would like to use this feature as I would allow me to write some more generic APIs for data access with firebase. Unfortunately, the current version of angularfire does not support it for `AngularFirestoreCollection`

Is there any plan to support this feature in angularfire? I was thinking about submitting a simple PR but didn't know if this would be possible due to the current firebase js sdk dependencies.

### Version info

<!-- What versions of the following libraries are you using? Note that your issue may already
be fixed in the latest versions. -->

**Angular:** 8.2.14

**Firebase:** 7.6.2

**AngularFire:** 5.3.0

**Other (e.g. Ionic/Cordova, Node, browser, operating system):** N/A

### How to reproduce these conditions
I've captured the issue in a simple project on StackBlitz: 
https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-scftvu

<!-- 
Provide a failing test unit, or create a minimal, complete, and 
verifiable example (http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) using either 
Plunker (http://plnkr.co/) or JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/).
-->

**Steps to set up and reproduce**
1. Open the console at the bottom of the StackBlitz-rendered browser
2. Click between the "Public", "Protected" and "Login" hyperlinks.

### Debug output

** Errors in the JavaScript console **
```
errors.ts:30 ERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): NullInjectorError: StaticInjectorError(AppModule)[AngularFireAuthGuard -> Router]: 
  StaticInjectorError(Platform: core)[AngularFireAuthGuard -> Router]: 
    NullInjectorError: No provider for Router!
NullInjectorError: StaticInjectorError(AppModule)[AngularFireAuthGuard -> Router]: 
  StaticInjectorError(Platform: core)[AngularFireAuthGuard -> Router]: 
    NullInjectorError: No provider for Router!
```

** Output from `firebase.database().enableLogging(true);` **
N/A (No output)

### Expected behavior
User should be navigated to the route `/protected`.

### Actual behavior
User remains on previous route with the JS error complianing about `NullInjectorError` as a provider wasn't provided for `Router`.

I have demonstrated this on a StackBlitz Project: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-scftvu

## Feature

I'm trying to show a files list of a specific user, which I store in firebase storage. Firebase offers a list method:
https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.storage.Reference#list

But angularfire doesn't have such method.

I am aware I can access `this.storage.storage.ref('my-folder')`, just wanted to ask for a better service-solution
### Version info

<!-- What versions of the following libraries are you using? Note that your issue may already

**Angular:**

**Firebase:**

**AngularFire:**
^5.3.0-rc.4

Using the `AngularFireAuthGuard` works, but does not support redirect with query parameters.
When a user isn't authenticated, I'd like to direct them to login, and once they are logged in send them back to where they tried to access.

```ts
const redirectUnauthorizedToLogin = (route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot) => {
  const path = route.pathFromRoot.map(v => v.url.map(segment => segment.toString()).join('/')).join('/');
  const params = String(new URLSearchParams(route.queryParams));

  // const url = '/?' + String(new URLSearchParams({redirect: path + '?' + params}));

  return redirectUnauthorizedTo(['/']);
};
```

But I can't redirect to this url as its not a valid segment, and `redirectUnauthorizedTo` doesn't support query parameters

I am using Angular 8, with the following packages:
    "@angular/core": "~8.2.14",
    "@angular/fire": "^5.3.0",
    "firebase": ">= 5.5.7 <8",

Works really well in development, but when I compile for production, I get the error

TypeError: Object(...)(...).auth is not a function

this is where in your code:

this.auth = zone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
            const app = _firebaseAppFactory(options, zone, nameOrConfig);
            return app.auth();
        });

I've seen this in other posts, but not with these versions which are the latest from this repo.

### Expected behavior

<!-- What is the expected behavior? -->
I am running ng add @angular/fire and it should let me select a project from my firebase projects

### Actual behavior

<!-- What is the actual behavior? -->
the terminal is saying: Server Error. certificate has expired
After adding @angular/fire to the project the Angular universal prerender breaks. It shows this warnings at first:

### How to reproduce these conditions

This is an issue that seems to only occur with SSR (Angular Universal).
As such, the steps to reproduce involve cloning a sample repository, installing dependencies, building, and then running the node server locally.

**Steps to set up and reproduce**

1. Clone the repository located at: https://github.com/blove/angularfire-prerender-analytics
2. Run the `npm run build` command to build the Angular project, server project and webpack.
3. Run the `npm run serve:ssr` command to start the node server.
4. Open http://localhost:4000 in your browser (or make the request via curl)

```

### Expected behavior

The `AngularFireAnalyticsModule` uses the @firebase/analytics module that determines if the gtag script is already present in the DOM. This functionality relies on a global `window` object in the `findGtagScriptOnPage()` function. This function should check if the `window` object is first available.

### Actual behavior

Using SSR locally, pre-rendering locally, and running the server in a Firebase cloud function all result in this error.

### Possible Workaround

One potential workaround I attempted was to mock the `window` object using domino:

```javascript
const win = createWindow(template);
(global as any)['window'] = win;
(global as any)['document'] = win.document;
```

However, this results in another error:

```
