Hi, I can't launch vagrant, here is the error message after typing `vagrant up`
$ vagrant up Vagrantfile 
Vagrant failed to initialize at a very early stage:
The plugins failed to load properly. The error message given is

I am working on Manjaro.
$ uname -a
Linux Manjaro 4.19.62-1-MANJARO #1 SMP PREEMPT Sun Jul 28 09:14:58 UTC 2019 x86_64 GNU/Linux

I can get "hello world !" in lucid32(Ubuntu 10.04 32-bit), but I can't get  "hello world !â€œ by command: 
`"C:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-i386.exe" c.img`

BTW, the `qemu-system-i386.exe --version`:
`QEMU emulator version 3.1.50 (v3.1.0-13607-geb2db0f7ba-dirty)`

Further more, it's OK on Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit by `qemu-system-i386 ./c.img` command;
Hello, the author , I've also been implementing an operating system recently . Read your book, feel very wonderful . So I want to translate it into Chinese . While translating, I will try my best to use what I have learned to keep the original meaning of the article.

This is the operating system I implemented before.

I can see the titles in gitbook. But there are no links for these titles. Will they be updated soon?
When I run `vagrant box add lucid32 http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid32.box` in my terminal, the following error comes up:

How do I correct this?

Fixes #145 
something to do for my assignment: change wording to sound more 'technical'
Hi,

Currently trying to get started with this project and I've encountered an issue with Vagrant and my VM.

Whenever I try to run `vagrant up` with my Vagrantfile in the directory, I receive this issue:

`Stderr: VBoxManage: error: The virtual machine 'Intro-to-OS_default_1515950615625_22554' has terminated unexpectedly during startup with exit code 1 (0x1)
VBoxManage: error: Details: code NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005), component MachineWrap, interface IMachine`

I've tried to uninstall VirtualBox and reinstall it, removed this Vagrantfile and initially did a `vagrant init`, and removed everything and restarted, but no luck.

I did encounter an issue with reinstalling VirtualBox and that may be the issue, but I'm unsure of how to solve it.

If anyone can steer me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it!

Additional information:
Using macOS 10.13

Thanks,
Mark
First, lucid32 is old release Ubuntu so that the default sources.list is out-of-date
Second, independent the provision.sh
