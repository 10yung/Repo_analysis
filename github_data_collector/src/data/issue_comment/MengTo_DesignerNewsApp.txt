It seems that this project has not yet been updated in awhile. Are there plans to convert this to Swift 3? This issue is especially frustrating when trying to follow along with the tutorial in design+code.
Yes, it's weird too, but the truth I found is the app crashes just at `webView.delegate = nil` in `WebViewController` because webView has been destroyed 
If you click on a cell with a multiline header label they wildly resize itself. If you open the app, **most** headlines are single line and shorted by "â€¦". At these shortened cells appears the bug.
As you can see on the GIF below, after clicking the cell label resizes and keeps so after closing the WebView. If you click again the label shrinks again, but this time only in the animation.

Would be nice to use the iOS 9 `SafariViewController` instead of the `WebView` to benefit from the new features of it. At least a small option to use it would be great.

**PS: Is the app still maintained? We've seen no commit for a long time.**


Please update this repo

Hi, are there any plans to support iOS 9 and Xcode 7.
My builds using iOS 9.2 and Xcode 7.2 are breaking (especially in Alamofire...)

Just wanted to know before I delve into further.

Thanks in advance.

The build fail for Swift 2 because external library already up-to-date to Swift 2 and using cocoaPod as module dependence get latest version.
