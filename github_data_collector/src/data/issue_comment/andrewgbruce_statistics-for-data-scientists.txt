 As recommended in the book I downloaded from GitHub R source file and when I execute them  I get the following error message while downloading the data from Google drive.

Error in curl::curl_fetch_disk(url, x$path, handle = handle) :
  Failed to open file C:\Users\amitk\OneDrive\Documents\statistics-for-data-scientists\data\state.csv.
 
I tried to find the solution for this error message but didn't get any luck. This is a humble request to kindly share the datasets so that I can practise the same.

Where are the ".png" files used in the program located?
I've also see that this PR mentioned by other issues in #3 and #5 ðŸ˜„ 
in your prep_datasets.r

you load the data file "state_populations.csv" and "murder_rate.csv"

**state_pop <- read.csv("/Users/andrewbruce1/book/state_populations.csv")
murder_rate <- read.csv("/Users/andrewbruce1/book/murder_rate.csv")**

but in your download_data.r

you didn't download the data file "state_populations.csv" and "murder_rate.csv"





Just encountered an error when executing the `download_data.r` script and modified it so that it creates the required data subdirectory upon first execution. I saw that this was also mentioned by other users in #3 
I am working through the example of session times in Chapter 3 > Permutation Test > Example: Web Stickiness. I have assumed that the data to which this example refers is that located in the file **web_page_data.csv**.

For pages A and B, respectively, it seems that the time is listed in the table as minutes, because the correct result for mean_b - mean_a (21.4) is obtained after converting to seconds. However, if this is correct, then Figure 3-3 is not. Figure 3-3 appears to show Time as minutes*100, rather than as minutes*60 (i.e., seconds). Which is correct?

Thanks!
The download_data.r script assumes the presence of a /data/ directory as in ~/statistics-for-data-scientists/data/

The user could create this manually or add a line to the script to do so.
The book uses a couple of datasets for coding examples. When will they become available here?
Where will I be able to access the code samples and example datasets of the book????
