Hey, this is great project, thanks for your effort!

Maybe you could use https://github.com/nbp/holyjit to get JIT for free. Not sure in which state it is now but at least this was the idea I had when I was thinking about doing js engine in rust myself.
Currently the spread operator (https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread) is unimplemented. Are there plans to implement this?

Node.js:

```javascript
console.log(1 + 2*3 ** 2 - 1);
// Output: 18
```

Rapidus (WASM):
```javascript
print(1 + 2*3 ** 2 - 1);
// Output: 7
```
