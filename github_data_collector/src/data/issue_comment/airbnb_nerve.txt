json gem version 1.8.2 is not compatible with more recent versions of ruby (such as the default on Ubuntu 18.04)

I had some problems running nerve due to a missing GEM_PATH (I'm not a Ruby guy). I resolved it after finding the instructions on how to run Synapse.

This change adds similar running instructions borrowed from the Synapse readme.
Should fix #92 

I think that we might need to somehow touch zk in zk_delete for this to really work, but WIP.
**Setup**:
6 nerve service watchers on the same instance connected to the same ZK pool

**How to reproduce**:
1. The instance has a problem connecting to ZK
2. Nerve -> 
`Nerve::Nerve: nerve: watcher service1 not alive; reaping and relaunching`
`Nerve::ServiceWatcher: nerve: stopping service watch service1`
`Nerve::Nerve: nerve: could not reap service1, got #<Zookeeper::Exceptions::NotConnected: Zookeeper::Exceptions::NotConnected>`
3. This continues in a loop for each service watcher until nerve is restarted.  

**Actual problem**:
The problem is that in start() in zookeeper.rb there are no checks to see if the ZK connection is alive before re-using in.  

Catching only StandardError is not enough.

Hi,

It would be nice if nerve would support serf as a reporter out of the box. I've been using a fork by  https://github.com/patrickviet and this has worked well for us so far. 
The original commit is here: https://github.com/getyourguide/nerve/blob/bb1734211b7d5b162ad9e4d62f33cb2834bdf481/lib/nerve/reporter/serf.rb

Your contributing guidelines say to open a PR onto the `pull_requests` branch; though that one seems very much out-of-date, so I'm opening the PR to `master`. Let me know if I should re-open the PR to another branch.

If you accept this I can also open a PR to synapse for serf support.

Thanks.

The mysql service connectivity check is similar to haproxy option mysql-check, and is used for local
mysql service check. A simple mysql-check uses a user with minimal USAGE privilege and the user may or may not have a password. In our company production, we use haproxy option mysql-check for synapse side service health check, however it does not work with a new db proxy service that we build, and the nerve tcp port health check on the local server is not sufficient. The simple mysql service check borrows the idea of haproxy option mysql-check but it uses mysql client and therefore works with the new proxy. It had been verified in our production test environment.

We've run into a few situations where hitless nerve reloads aren't so hitless because we have 5 registrations that take 5 seconds (zk timeout), and then our 30s sleep isn't enough.

Perhaps we should make it async.

I see that you pin Bunny to `1.1.0` exactly. Not sure why that's necessary but that version is dozens of releases behind `1.6.3`. There should be no major breaking changes (for some apps, no breaking changes period) and I highly recommend you upgrade.

[Bunny change log](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) is fairly detailed. I'm happy to answer questions if you have any.
