The world out there still speaks C by and large. To let more people use the library, Orz should get a C API exported, so that people can use it from C++, Objective-C, Nim, Python, Node.js and everything else.

The [A little Rust with your C](https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/interoperability/rust-with-c.html) chapter explains how to make public functions C compatible and how to generate headers using cbindgen.

It seems that there is no test code added in the project, how do we ensure that the compression and decompression results are correct. The current project version has reached 1.4, which means that the project function has been stable and can be used in the production environment. In this case, it is very necessary to add the corresponding test code.
