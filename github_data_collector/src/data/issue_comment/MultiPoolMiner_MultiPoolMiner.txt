Don't understand, but several last issues do not produce profit on my PC, vice versa, after 2-3 hours PC stops working and it' stucks.
Is it only me complaining ?
Thanks !
It seems as though recent versions have removed the support for solo and party support on Zergpool.  Can this be added back?
 I keep getting a "Powershell 6 or later is required. Cannot continue." It seems the miners are not downloading. I have installed 6.0 6.0.2 6.2.1 and even 7 with no luck. I have also run the start.bat with admin privileges. I have tried running it without modifying the address or settings at all and I still get the same error. I have installed both 64bit and x86 versions of powershell too. 

What could I be doing wrong?
Seems to be a consistent issue with WildRig miner, I believe happens with another miner but eventually mpm receives the data. With WildRig  when viewing the miner itself it's showing a hashrate , PowerShell window shows a hashrate , then fails with message , failed to receive hashrate information in time. Any tweaks to the configs that could be done to rectify.

Hi there returning MPM user here.
I could not get the miner running after completing my setup, and I had to do the fix mentioned here:
https://github.com/MultiPoolMiner/MultiPoolMiner/issues/2382#issuecomment-549949736
And here to solve the "No pools available" issue: https://github.com/MultiPoolMiner/MultiPoolMiner/issues/2405#issuecomment-533481080
Now I've run into another issue. I cannot get the miner to do anything after initialization. It won't go past this:

There is no indication that nothing has crashed, no extra/missing window, and I cannot tell it is doing anything in the background.

Hello U-Guru,

Really sorry if I'm wasting your, genuinely valuable time.  I did read your comment on the Lyra2RE3, no pools available issue (which is minor to me), but from what I read I can only conclude there is an issues with the available "Lyra2Rev3" Pools.

I have 2 machines, 1 Nvid and 1 AMD, both get the same result if I just try to mine just "Vertcoin" (for testing perposess) which has only 1 coin related to the "lyra2Rev3" Algo.  So when I tested just for this particular Coin/Alog (of which there is only 1 coin)  I get "No Pools Available" (see attached TXT file)

So when;

"MPM polls all configured pools and builds a list of all available pool/algo possibilities (http://localhost:3999/allpools.html).
* MPM selects the best paying pool for each algorithm (http://localhost:3999/bestpools.html)
* MPM scans the files in the MinersLegacy folder and builds a list of all available miner/algo combinations (http://localhost:3999/miners.html) thereby evaluating the GPUs capabilities, e.g. min. RAM required for each algo, and pool/algo availabilty in allpools
* MPM selects the fastest miner for each algorithm (non-benchmarked miner/algos are always selected first) from bestpools and builds a list (http://localhost:3999/activeminers.html)
* MPM calculates the best paying miner per GPU (miner speed * price) and starts mining.

and it finds "No Pools available" when the only Algo chosen is used for Vertcoin, is this a fault with the "Lyra2R3 MPM Pool", or some other Pool.

1/ I have included only 1 pool/algo possibility
2/ The best paying Pool (it finds No Pools)
3/ I have the available Miners and a 1080ti (+another one) on one machine and a Vega 64 on the other + stacks of RAM on both, so should be able to mine this algo (I used to be able to anyway)
4/ As for it selecting the fastest miner for each Algo,  I've checked and have the required miners, so it should choose whichever one it deems fit.
5/ As to calcutating the best paying miner, I don't know, as it never benchmarks any of them due to not finding a Pool.

In short, is this down to, Pools that are out of your control, or am I just a dimwit (my guess is dimwit).

Hello all.  After reading and researching as much as I could, I still have the same issue.  

We have 4 rigs running the same win 10pro 64bit OS  All four have 1060 or 1080 nvidia cards
Two rigs run perfectly now.  The other two stop at the 'Starting MultPoolMining' prompt

Here is what we have tried so far.
-updated nvidia drivers on all rigs
-updated shell on all rigs
-disabled defender/firewall
-changed default browser (two bad rigs can't see localhost:3999)
-made fresh installs and used installs from working machines
-cleared logs/benchmark, etc.
-cleared cache
-checked proxy server settings
-reset ip and cleared dns cache
-downloaded and installed the latest MPM release
-moved the install directory to different locations including the desktop

We have two machines that work properly and two that hang on the starting screen.

Any help would be greatly appreciated

If you own such a card then please port the output of 

http://localhost:3999/devices

here - Thank you!
