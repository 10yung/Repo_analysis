## Overview (Required)

Your google-services.json file contains some secrets. I guess you are aware of it since you decrypt it in [your CI step](https://github.com/DroidKaigi/conference-app-2018/blob/f19dd63f8b691d44ba7f758d92c2ca615cdad08d/.circleci/config.yml#L41), so I suppose adding the decrypted file into the repo history had to be a mistake.

## Overview (Required)
- Users can specify settings for each Notification Channels from Android 8.0 Oreo.
- So we need to implement links to Notification Channel settings, like this:

```java
Intent intent = new Intent(Settings.ACTION_CHANNEL_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS);
intent.putExtra(Settings.EXTRA_CHANNEL_ID, channelId);
intent.putExtra(Settings.EXTRA_APP_PACKAGE, getPackageName());
startActivity(intent);
```

Currently, the session is removed from the screen when remove favorite on mysession screen. Checking "what session is removed" is difficult when remove favorite accidentally.
So, I propose "keep showing the session" (or "show navigation for 'undo'") in mysession screen.

Now, once a speaker view is opened, one has to click once more on the user icon to display its SNS links. I don't think that's really intuitive and I didn't know we could do that before I saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/new_runnable/status/958977353673203712). How about just always displaying it as a bottom view?
