It seems like #105 is not resolved. I am opening a new one, since the original one got lengthy, sidetracked and closed.

The colors for the bold text are completely wrong.

Run this to reproduce:

```
tput setaf 2 # green
tput bold
tput sgr0
tput setaf 1 # red
tput bold
tput sgr0
```

Below are a static screenshot of the output. and the SVG in a ZIP file (since Github wont accept SVG).

See how both green and red become different colors when they are bolded.

I used [Pysintaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) with the following command : `use pyinstaller --clean --ascii --strip --onefile --name termtosvg --hidden-import pyte --hidden-import lxml --add-data termtosvg/data/templates:termtosvg/data/templates __main__.py`

Maybe it could be added to the documentation, if helpful.


Howdy!

I'd love to see incorporated into the window-like templates the ability to include the "window title" (/ "icon name") in the actual title area of the presented window-like interface.  This would involve special handling for the following sequences:

* `ESC]0;stringBEL` — "set icon name and window title to **string**"

* `ESC]1;stringBEL` — "set icon name to **string**"

* `ESC]2;stringBEL` — "set window title to **string**"

For example, my shell's default window title becomes (after Zsh init and startup) `amcgregor@Samkiel.local (10.0.1.22) - byobu — zsh`
If stdin is closed `termtosvg` will create a (mostly) empty svg. E.g. running this:

``` shell
     termtosvg -g 82x19 -c 'echo hello' out.svg
```

with closed stdin won't produce any frames. Instead one has to do something like this:

``` shell
     (tail -f /dev/null || true) | termtosvg -g 82x19 -c 'echo hello' out.svg
```

which _will_ produce an SVG file where we see "hello" being printed.
`termtosvg: error: unrecognized arguments: --version`

tested using 0.6
on ubuntu 16.04, firefox 60.0.2, a recorded session shows mangled powerline fonts in my oh-too-blingy zsh config.
