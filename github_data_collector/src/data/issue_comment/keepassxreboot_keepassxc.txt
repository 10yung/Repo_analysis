## Summary
Report all passwords that contain the master-password or variants of the master-password.

## Details
Please check in the Health Report (#551) if the master-password (the password to access the KeePassXC database) is reused as password for entries in KeePassXC.
Please also check for variants of the master password (like different up-case / lower-case, added some special characters).

## Example
The master-password of the KeePassXC database is for example **hellopassword**. 
If the password of an entry is using the same password, then you show a warning that the password of the entry must not be the master password:

The following passwords are variants of the master-password and are reported in the Health Report:
- hellopass
- hellopass01
- hellopass_01
- HelloPassword
- HelloPassword01
- HelloPassword_01
- Hello_Password
- Hello_Password01
- Hello_Password_01

Here you should show a message that the password of the entry is similar to the master-password / is a variant of the master-password.

This will help users to increase the security of the KeePassXC master-password.


I import a second kdbx file using keeshare: 

I created a new folder, put in a name, chose `keeshare`, chose `type: import`, chose the path to the kdbx (I had to switch to `show all files`) and put in the password. It seems to work, but some entries are just missing. I opened the file as a new database and it works, it is the same file that is imported and is opened as new database, but some files in the imported folder are just missing. 

I tried to find out what is the difference between the entries that are shown and the missing ones, but could not find any yet.

- Changed command and option names in man page to bold. Because it's easier to understand than if it's not bold.

I have a DB that takes a rather long time to unlock, so while it unlocked I switched to another DB. When the first one unlocked, it crashed right away. I was able to easily reproduce this.


## Expected Behavior
Do not crash, open the first DB in the "background" tab.


## Current Behavior
Crash.


## Possible Solution


## Steps to Reproduce
Prerequisites: have two locked DBs in two tabs open, one of them (the one to unlock first should take a rather long time to unlock, enough time to switch tabs after PW entry).
1. Unlock the first DB (happens only when unlock is (would be?) successful).
2. while it is computing, switch to the other tab.
2. Crash.
3.


## Context
I have 2 Databases, at least one of them takes a long time to unlock.

## Summary
Add an advanced check for insecure passwords (check against a dictionary)

## Desired Behavior
We all know that passwords should not contain normal words that can be found in a dictionary, because hackers use word lists to attack passwords via brute force/rainbow tables.
I am not an security expert, but you know what I mean.

Adding numbers or symbols at the beginning or at the end of normal words makes passwords also not safe. 
Also replacing single letters with special characters (like replacing an "a" with an "@" or replacing an "i" with "1") is not a good idea, because hackers know this trick. 

So here are some examples of weak and Insecure passwords:
- J@nu@ry01
- p@$$w0rd
- n00b
- all words from a normal dictionary (with or without numbers at the end, like "vase" or "vase01")
- names (with or without numbers at the end, like "Oliver" or "Oliver01")

It would be great if KeePassXC warns me if I use such insecure passwords. 
Here I don't mean pwned passwords, that can be found in Have I Been Pwned. 
I mean insecure passwords that can be found in dictionaries (like described above)

I don't know id there is a **web service** that checks the security of passwords (like you have "Have I Been Pwned" for pwned passwords).

When I search for "check password security" then I find these websites where users can check their passwords:
- https://howsecureismypassword.net/
- https://password.kaspersky.com/de/
- http://www.passwordmeter.com/
- https://www.my1login.com/resources/password-strength-test/
- https://lastpass.com/howsecure.php
Maybe these links are useful to test this feature (test the results of the password strength report).

When I search for "check password security" then I find these services
- https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19245/Google-Password-Strength-API
- https://www.enzoic.com/docs-passwords-api/
- https://cmatskas.com/password-validation-and-creation-using-a-public-api/
I am not a programmer, so I don't know if these links are helpful (at least I tried).

I think **programming this manually** is a lot of work, because you would have to:
- convert the password to lower case
- replace symbols with the corresponding characters (like convert an "@" to "a")
- remove leading and trailing symbols
- remove leading and trailing numbers
- check if the password is in a dictionary (multiple languages)

My intention is to tell users if they are using insecure passwords.
I know that this is a huge task and much to code, but this would increase password quality in KeePassXC.
**OS**: Fedora; **Environment**: Gnome; **File**: /KeePassXC-2.5.2-x86_64.AppImage, renamed _keepassxc_.
```
$ file -b keepassxc
ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.18, stripped
```
Despite the application can be launched in a Wayland session, the following output is produced:
```
$ ./keepassxc
Warning: Ignoring XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland on Gnome. Use QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland to run on Wayland anyway.
```
Following output is produced both in Wayland and X sessions.
```
$ firejail --appimage --private --noprofile ./keepassxc
Mounting appimage type 2
Error mounting appimage: appimage.c:119 appimage_set: Invalid argument
```
Issue: Appimage types reported in `file` and `firejail` outputs **differ from each other**.

It seems possible to integrate file's _check-sum_ into the file while compiling it as format Appimage. One case is from [cpvrlab Imageplay](https://imageplay.io/).
```
$ file -b imageplay
ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.18, BuildID[sha1]=d629f6099d2344ad82818172add1d38c5e11bc6d, stripped
```
**Expected Behavior**

Should be able to fully view windows associations of an entry without making any changes and not be prompted about "unsaved changes" when leaving the entry.

**Current Behavior**
If you view the window associations by clicking on them, you can't leave that entry without getting the warning about unsaved changes (with nothing being changed).


**Steps to Reproduce**
1. Open an entry with multiple Auto-Type Window Associations.
2. Click Auto-Type
3. The first Association will be highlighted in grey. Select the second one.
4. Press Cancel

**Context**
Just normal use. Work with a new database with just a single entry.

**Debug Info**
Version: 2.5.2 64-bit on Windows 10.10.19536

Remarks:
[#3013](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/3013) is quite similar, except that the fix for that one obviously did not solve this one.

For some reason, I did not get the bug-reporting template when creating this issue. I have therefore tried to mimic the template.

Adds Browser Integration page to Group Edit page. This allows to set the following options for all entries in the group and its subgroups:
- Skip Auto-Submit for entries
- Hide entries from the browser extension
- Use entries only with HTTP Basic Auth

The checkboxes are tristate, so if any of the entries has a different setting from others, the state is set to `Qt::PartiallyChecked`. However, user can only set two states, `Qt::Checked` or `Qt::Unchecked`.

Fixes #1789.
Fixes #3998.

[TIP]:  # ( DO NOT include screenshots of your actual database! )

## Summary
[NOTE]: # ( Provide a brief overview of what the new feature is all about )

Ability to (like Firefox) customise the toolbar.

## Desired Behavior
[NOTE]: # ( Tell us how the new feature should work, be specific )

I would like to be able to:

- Reorder the elements
- Remove specific elements (this would solve #3539 for specific users then)

This would also help with #505 as users could put the Find option first to prevent it overflowing and becoming hidden.

## Possible Solution
[NOTE]: # ( Not required, but suggest ideas on how to implement the addition or change )


## Context
[NOTE]: # ( Why does this feature matter to you? What unique circumstances do you have? )
