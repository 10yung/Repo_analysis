Hello, 
I found some problems in your code using the PVS-Studio static code analyzer, I described the issues in the article: "Checking Emby with PVS-Studio". Not all of the analyzer's warnings have been considered in it, so I suggest that you check the project yourself. Perhaps, some of the warnings that have not been described in the article will seem more interesting to you than the ones that I found :)
To work with the analyzer you will need a key, please, use the following one:
Name: Emby
Key: HGSG-5K94-1NFG-TZGB
License Type: Team9 License up to 9 developers
License Valid Thru: Feb 15, 2020

After I started to have both 1080p and 4K versions of movies, I have started to correct the file naming of all movies and moving the same movie into one folder. Before it was in separate folders for 3D, 1080p and 4K.
This all works great unless there is a multi disc rip in the folder. As soon as there is part# or any of the other split video naming, the multi version display is not working, resulting in two movies in the list. The multi disc version now only have one file recognized (disc1) and disc2 is missing.
If I move the multi disc version to it's own folder (Movie name (year) 3D), Emby correctly identifies both discs. But of course it still shows as two movies in the list.

I have tried different naming, but no matter what I try, the result is two separate movies and the multi disc version missing the second disc.
I have attached the logs from the server. The movie is The Hobbit An unexpected journey (Extended version and 3D).

hi, i have  a problem with the lastest version(the newest server, emby for koid and IOS client). When I choose the Chinese subtitle, it doesn't work any way. But it works in PotPlayer-x64 on Windows 10.
 
I find the issue for such ass subtitles is because the format line in Events section: 
**Format: Name, Fontname, Fontsize, PrimaryColour, SecondaryColour, OutlineColour, BackColour, Bold, Italic, Underline, StrikeOut, ScaleX, ScaleY, Spacing, Angle, BorderStyle, Outline, Shadow, Alignment, MarginL, MarginR, MarginV, Encoding**
 ![Snipaste_2019-12-05_14-17-43.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/12/05/cBVs19ZYPe3gMF2.png)

After update to: 
**Format: Layer, Start, End, Style, Actor, MarginL, MarginR, MarginV, Effect, Text**   , the subtitle works for all clients.
Hope this could help you fix the issue.
Thanks.
Hi,
I try to use emby (mainly for the existing mycroft-skill), set it up, let it index my collection. 
Strangely there are some artists missing e.g. Pink Floyd. I tried to check this and learned that it had nothing to do with the mycroft call, but the artists are not shown in the web interface as well.
My collection is completely id3tagged (and even has musicbrainz-ids - as a feature request it might directly lookup the IDs rather than the names, but that's another issue, see below) - switched  on debug and restarted indexing the following excerpt appears in my log.

The contained queries `2019-12-01 15:49:33.967 Info HttpClient: GET http://musicbrainz01.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com:8080/ws/2/release/?query="1969-Ummagumma-album"` looks like emby looks up the folder name rather than the album name contained in every mp3. If this really is what's happening I wonder why other albums are recognized at all. 
My complete collection is stored in `artist/year-name-type` style ...
imo it should look for (the musicbrainz-id if present, but at least) the album name stored in id3tags and use the folder name only as last resort when no tags are available ...
Any hints on this? Can I provide something else? 
Oh - I just updated and am running version 4.3.0.30 on a raspberry 4 if that matters (which I doubt).
4.3.0.26

Samsung smart tv when you fast forward the loading/spinning icon does not go away... only way to clear it is to fast forward to where you want to be then back out of the movie/show and then resume play.
According to how an empty value of the `LanNetworks` is computed (source ref below), the corresponding help field is partially correct:
> If left blank, only the server's subnet is considered to be on the local network.

Source: https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/blob/dffad1c52cbc73336fbbcb91894a0f0220c4c3fb/MediaBrowser.WebDashboard/dashboard-ui/strings/en-US.json#L1797

Basically, all well-known IPv4 private subnets, according to: https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/blob/dffad1c52cbc73336fbbcb91894a0f0220c4c3fb/Emby.Server.Implementations/Networking/NetworkManager.cs#L154

Instead, an indication that well-known subnets are also used should be displayed, for example:
> If left blank, only the server's subnet and common private IP subnets (eg. 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/24, etc.) are considered to be on the local network.
I've just been doing a little testing in preparation for a new home theater setup (eventually going to be built around the new 2019 Shield) using my Pixel XL running Android 10 and the Big Buck Bunny files available here - http://bbb3d.renderfarming.net/download.html

When testing with the 2D 1080p60 file:

- Direct mode results in ~10fps playback
- Transcoding to 1080p 4mbps results in solid 60fps playback

Whereas in Google Chrome (and other Android players like Kodi) I am able to achieve a solid 60fps playback. With the 2D 1080p30 file things are better, but I still see dropped frames in Direct mode. Judging from the video timeline indicator, it appears I have plenty of frames buffered, so I don't think it's my network. 

Is anyone else able to replicate my tests? 
Hi there,

Emby have a recurrent issue with Chromecast. Everytime I pause a movie, and then click back on play, the playback just freeze many seconds later (it's random, but generally less than 5 minutes).

I have to restart the playback (stop and play) to continue.

I ran the lighthouse performance, best practises, and PWA audits. The full results are available [here](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/?gist=cc7613430fe943cd1f29e44b953b3eb0).

Some notable results from the performance audit:

* Text compression should be enabled on the dictionary files
* Script evaluation takes ~3s on the main page
* There are 188 requests on the main page
* Another note not shown in the above audit that appeared on re-runs:
