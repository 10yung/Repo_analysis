Hi,

First of all thank you for very much for this code. I am using this code in my application and added file upload also in  form components. Its working fine to create new form with that element but after creating tried to upload  the file and form submitted not getting the file.I found out the problem because ng-model can only read the string not file.I want to get uploaded file also along with remaining data now we are getting after the data entered in created form.I am trying my best to do this .if any help i would be thankful.

Hi,
 I have used this angular-form-builder in my application , but my application's form has many sections when I try to drag and drop a widget it is getting fixed at the last but not in the place where i am trying to drop it , it is getting added at the end by default Please tell me solution to fix this.
form building works fine until the form is built with two components.
While trying to drag and drop third component,second components gets repeated as part of form.
Please help!

Thanks @kelp404  for this library!
I have been using form builder and it was working fine until there comes a case, Where admin creates dynamic forms and they get stored in mongoDB. 

Thereafter when user logs in we need to show those forms to user by fetching the fields from DB.

But when I fetch fields from db and calling the api named `$builder.addFormObject`, it is not updating view on the ui and nor it is inserting the field in the form.

I am also able to reproduce the issue and created a simple plunkr describing the same. Here is the url for that: https://plnkr.co/edit/0gzxKr7amvaOGhuwiV0M?p=preview

Can you please try to resolve the issue if possible?

Thanks
How to make following control using angular form builder 
1.Configuration List 

**Example :**
Product Name | Qty | Price | Amount
infinite loop (with + icon)
If above control it's possible than let me know.
I'm able to add dateObject and file upload component in form builder.

My date picker template:
<div class="form-group">
    <label for="{{formName+index}}" class="col-sm-4 control-label" ng-class="{'fb-required':required}">{{label}}</label>
    <div class="col-sm-8">
        <input type="date" ng-model=dateObject validator-required="{{required}}" validator-group="{{formName}}" id="{{formName+index}}" class="form-control" placeholder="{{placeholder}}"/>
        <p class='help-block'>{{description}}</p>
    </div>
</div>

My Image upload template:

<div class="form-group "> 
<label for="{{formName+index}}" class="col-sm-4 control-label" ng-class="{'fb-required':required}">{{label}} </label>
<div class="col-sm-8 uploadImageDiv">
 <input type="file" ng-model="inputText" class="imageType" validator-required="{{required}}" validator-group="{{formName}}" id="{{formName+index}}" class="form-control" placeholder="{{placeholder}}"/>
         <p class='help-block'>{{description}}</p>
    </div>
</div>

It works fine either i add it in demo.js or angular-form-builder-component.js.
I even render them and create a awesome form but when i submit the rendered form , it doesn't pass any value to date or image in my DB.
"[{\"label\":\"Text Input\",\"value\":\"Abda ka dabdaa\"},{\"label\":\"Upload image\",\"value\":\"\"},{\"label\":\"Date\",\"value\":\"\"}]".

What should i add to pass value into my DB.
I have seen Angular-form-builder.js but i dont understand Angular much.
