I am using a this library to displays a CollectionView as an asymmetric grid layout.

**I am trying to create custom section headers between multiple grids, however the section headers are not displaying even though it creates an empty white space**. I am looking to achieve something like this:

Here is my code:

    - (CGSize)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView layout:(UICollectionViewLayout*)collectionViewLayout referenceSizeForHeaderInSection:(NSInteger)section {
    return CGSizeMake(320, 60);
    }

How to set the cell items size to be equal?
How customization the cell size to be equal,I find the RACollectionViewReorderableTripletLayout must set a large size,and the other cell be a half of  large size,can there be equal?


Hi,
I added size classes to the demo project so it could work on both iPads and iPhones. 

Regards, Gabe

there is a warning for:

``` Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, assign) RAScrollDirction scrollDirection;
```

auto property synthesis will not synthesize property 'scrollDirection'; it will be implemented by its superclass, use @dynamic to acknowledge intention

I did see a `scrollDirection` in UICollectionViewFlowLayout:

``` Objective-C
@property(nonatomic) UICollectionViewScrollDirection scrollDirection
```

I am not sure, if I rename `RAScrollDirction scrollDirection` to `RAScrollDirction scrollingDirection`, will it break anything? I don't if it is a hack to replace scrollDirection, or careless used the same name.
