"react": "16.8.6",
"react-native": "0.60.5",
"react-native-image-zoom-viewer": "^2.2.27",

All of the portrait images are not visible, the error message always return 'source' of undefined and the status is "fail", when the app go to background and then go to active mode, the image status is "success" and the image is visible, so weird.

Even i have set the width and height on imageUrls, the status is "success", but the image still not visible.
I am trying to display images and videos inside the viewer, but can't figure out how to add the videos. I don't mind if they show at the end, but they been part of the numeric count, and the swipe motion is required. 

Thanks
How to change the color position of the top page number
Cool component, will you add web support?


I would like to change the indicator color but i don't know how to do so.
i try to change the renderIndicator by doing  this.

`(currentIndex, allSize) => <Text style={{color:'red'}}>currentIndex + "/" + allSize</Text>` but it doesn't even show.

Please help !!
Hi! It would be great to have a changelog, maybe you could use https://github.com/ascoders/react-native-image-viewer/releases for it. Thanks
