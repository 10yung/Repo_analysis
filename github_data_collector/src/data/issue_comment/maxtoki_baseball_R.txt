In the example, it says "the best talent in this season was Detriot...and the lost the World Series." In the example you are using, Detroit didn't "lose" it (you have to be "in" it, to "lose" it; instead, they "didn't win" it. Small, but slightly confusing difference.
Hi, i've been working through the book, and found a few typos in the stock scripts. I went ahead and corrected them. Thought you may be interested in seeing them. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll be going through the other chapters too, and can send anything else i find if that's ok. 
Corrected code in "get.stats" function to reflect correct OBP formula. Added HBP to numerator and denominator, removed H from denominator.

Hello, I searched online but couldn't find anywhere to post errata, so I'm trying here :-) In section 3.2.1 of the book, we enter the following text:

hof$Era <- cut(hof$MidCareer, breaks=c(1800, 1900, 1919, 1941, 1960, 1976, 1993, 2050), labels=c("19th Century", "Lively Ball", "Dead Ball", "Integration", "Expansion", "Free Agency", "Long Ball"))

I think this command incorrectly switches "Lively Ball" and "Dead Ball". Because in the paragraph above, DB comes before LB, but in this cut() command, LB is first. Also, later in the section, the book shows that "Lively Ball" has 46 entries in the hofbatting table. But with the command above, it's "Dead Ball" that has 46 entries. 

So I think the correct command is:

hof$Era <- cut(hof$MidCareer, breaks=c(1800, 1900, 1919, 1941, 1960, 1976, 1993, 2050), labels=c("19th Century", "Dead Ball", "Lively Ball", "Integration", "Expansion", "Free Agency", "Long Ball"))

When I enter this command and the subsequence ones, I get the results shown in the book.

Thanks, and I apologize if this has already been reported or if it's the wrong place to do so :-)

Hi Max, I think the Lively Ball and Dead Ball era are switched in your source code
