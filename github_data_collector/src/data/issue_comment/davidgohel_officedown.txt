This PR adds variants of `rdocx_document` and `rpptx_document` so to support cross reference base on the syntax of the bookdown package.
Hi, 

I am in the process of creating a mail merge with R Markdown. I have an R script to scan a Contact List which inputs the Rmd document (Letter Template) to produce letters for each individual on the Contact List.

Another loop is written within the Rmd document that reads 3 data frames to produce 3 tables. For example:

1. Store Details
2. Financial Details
3. Transactions 

So far, everything is producing beautifully but the only problem is the table layout. A letter for each contact may have 2 or more Stores and so, 6 or more tables all with varying numbers of rows. 

I was hoping that by incorporating chunk_page_break_ at the end of the loop it would create a new page for the next 3 tables. 

I have attempted to create blank space that separates the tables but that does not work well. 

Would you be able to assist me with this? Thank you in advance!
The readme mentions using narrow margins, but I can not find any example of how to do so.  Is this only possible with a reference document?

Interested in how to create a chunk to add a new line much like <!---CHUNK_PAGEBREAK---> adds a pagebreak.
