Hi, snsun
Thanks for your code.
I think that we should use the eigenvalue of correlation matrices to solve the permutation problem.

However, here you used the matrix of eigenvectors. Is this a bug?
Another question is that in

The author addressed that

Do you have any idea of how to realize matrix normalization and keeping objective function stable
