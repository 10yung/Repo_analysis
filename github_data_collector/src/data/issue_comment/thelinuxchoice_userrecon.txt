I strongly suggest changing all instances of:
_$username >> $username.txt_
to this:
_$username >> targets/$username.txt_

This would keep from throwing tons of username files all over the app directory and instead keep them all centrally located in one directory inside the app directory. This keeps things tidy and allows the user to make a symlink to the targets dir for easy use.

Of course you will need to add the _mkdir targets_ line of code for this...but I am sure you already realize that. =)

Is there any way to put tinder and whatsapp to scan?
how can i put more social media?

Can we have tool that search user names based on domain? That would be ideal for some conditions.

The issue is at this line, you forgot to add the .txt extension: 
https://github.com/thelinuxchoice/userrecon/blob/master/userrecon.sh#L119
Google Plus print line had missing .txt

This resulted in two files created one username with only the plus.google line, one with the rest
