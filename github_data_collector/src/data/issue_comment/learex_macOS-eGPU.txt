won't work without the beta tag.. almost everything in beta mode says command not found.
Hallo egpu users,
 
after a few attempt the graphic card is recognized by the system
and is working well.
The only remaining problem: the integrated screen stays black.

Any suggestions what I could do to get the integrated screen working
with the internal graphic card? 
 
Really keenly looking forward hearing from you,
Freddie
TensorFlow requires Nvidia GPUs.  Has anyone used this script to enable TensorFlow GPU running on a Mac? What type of performance gain?
This is a patch I applied to this script to enable [closed-clamshell](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201834) mode with my NVIDIA eGPU. 

In IOGraphicsFamily's [IOFramebuffer](https://opensource.apple.com/source/IOGraphics/IOGraphics-530.9/IOGraphicsFamily/IOFramebuffer.cpp.auto.html) the line of code `gIOGDebugFlags |= kIOGDbgNoClamshellOffline` (only executed when an NVIDIA GPU is detected) causes closed-clamshell mode to be disabled, so when I close the macbook's lid the internal display doesn't get disabled. 

This patch adds an optional (not installed by default) package `--nvidiaClosedClamshellPatch` to install a patch that NOPs out this line of code.

(I understand the repository hasn't been updated in some time so no big deal if this can't be merged at the time, just contributing this in case it's useful).
[macos -egpu -C.docx](https://github.com/learex/macOS-eGPU/files/3077320/macos.-egpu.-C.docx)

I installed my ePGU using this script

bash <(curl -s  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learex/macOS-eGPU/master/macOS-eGPU.sh) --beta --nvidiaDriver 387.10.10.10.40.105 --iopcieTunneledPatch

Setup ok. My systems detects the eGPU but I have a black screen with the mouse not showing.

I tried the suggested solutions on the page "Make your Mac compatible with NVIDIA and AMD eGPUs. (macOS High Sierra)" but with no success.

Attached is the result of macos-egpu -C


I have an Akitio TB3 SSD enclosure that used to work prior to 17G5019.  Now I cannot mount my SSD array.  It's as if I don't even connect anything to the computer.  I've tried all the other ports with and without my eGPU, no dice. My eGPU works just fine.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I'm not a programmer and I am limited in my understanding of how this works, but I know enough to apply simple terminal commands and so far I've been able to handle issues by doing research on my own and this problem has me stumped.  I haven't been able to access my external SSD array in about a month now.  I need to get in there! haha.  Thanks in advance for all your help!

When I try to open Spotify or some other app (but not all apps) the whole OS gets really slow and unresponsive. When I use safari/firefox/sublime text it doesn't do that.
This doesn't seem like an issue when I am not using the eGPU with external monitors

Setup: MacBook Pro 2018 15" with HP OMEN Accelerator and two external monitors with a GTX 1070.


I have a few small script changes to share.  My machine is on a corporate network that filters pings, so I've added a second way to check network connectivity.  Also, I use the Homebrew's version of 'find' that I place ahead in my PATH, and that version complains of the ordering for -maxdepth.   Putting the -maxdepth argument before -iname works for both GNU find and BSD find.

Hi,

Just tried the script. Looks like the newest security update on High Sierra Version 10.13.6 (17G5019) hasn't been approved yet.
https://gist.github.com/achainan/1e3a6bb4b1dc5dfcbec1cc8a6b649f3c


Tried with beta flag and also looks like NVIDIAEGPUSupport doesn't support 17G5019 yet.

Thanks.
