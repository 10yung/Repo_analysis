Dear O'Reilly,

I have watched your video of pyData 2017 presentation and want to say that your talks was tremendously helpful for me. 
I have downloaded basemap library and would like to show some pollutant concentrations in certain coordiantes of Lahore city. I have  a file with coordinates and pollutant concentration. I would like to create a simple representation which can be published in an article. Can you suggest some projections that will do my above stated task. 
I have in my mind to use projection='cyl' cylinderical. Could you guide me about my choice!!
are there instruction on how to run the notebooks in python 3?
