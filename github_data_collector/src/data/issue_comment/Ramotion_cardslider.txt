In iOS13, if I present the cardslider by defining 
`cardSlider.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen`
How can I get back to the master view controller?
If I use something like 
`cardSlider.modalPresentationStyle = .automatic`
It will not be displayed well.

It means either I display it well but cannot get back, 
or it shows up with the layout totally messed up.

Does anybody else have the same problem?

The rating star is not showing itself. 
Maybe you should add the star image into Pod resource.
iOS 13 supports native dark mode and this repo's demo project will put up a white background irrespective of the device's theme settings. This causes the text to become invisible when the user is on dark mode since the background color becomes white and so does the label color. 
I tried to delete a cell from collection view on didSelect method. But I had get a crash:`[self.collectionView performBatchUpdates:^{
        [self.movies removeObjectAtIndex:0];
        NSIndexPath *indexPath = [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:0 inSection:0];
        [self.collectionView deleteItemsAtIndexPaths:@[indexPath]];
    } completion:^(BOOL finished) {
        NSLog(@"finished");
    }];`
Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[__NSArrayM insertObject:atIndex:]: object cannot be nil'

some times I receive this exception when dismiss CardSliderViewController:

"Property animators must either finish animating or be explicitly stopped and finished before they can be released."

i suppose the exception is about animator property of CardTitleView

Any help?
thank you
i like this rep , i think add  swiper top to remove card  is very useful
[Fix] fix this issue:
Crash:
*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: 'Could not find a storyboard named 'Main' in bundle NSBundle.
When I try to do something like this:

self.movies.insert(newMovie, at: 0)
self.collectionView.insertItems(at: [IndexPath(item: 0, section: 0)])
self.collectionView.collectionViewLayout.invalidateLayout()
self.collectionView.layoutIfNeeded()

I get that card on top of the first one, it has a strange layout problem.
Is it possible to scroll left for more cards?
no pod found

I'm using Carthage 0.31.2 and Mojave OS. 
When i building your framework using carthage, it emit `Dependency "CardSlider" has no shared framework schemes for any of the platforms: iOS` message. 
How can i fix it?
