Someone, please update this source! It was obsoleted for 2 years
Some armor blocks including slabs and the underside of slopes have problems with the texture which would normally continue between blocks but instead sharply cuts off between blocks.

Another thing that bothers me is how some armor blocks (slabs for example) don't have that metal trim at the edges of the block, making them look out of place when used with regular blocks. 
Round blocks do have that metal trim, but it doesn't go away when you use them to make cylinders.

The armor cubes to the right have a nice, continuous texture. The slabs and ramps to the left cut off sharply between blocks.

TL;DR - Please make armor blocks more coherent and aesthetically pleasing.
In the folder "SpaceEngineers/Sources/Sandbox.Common/ModAPI/" and its subfolders there is no "IMyTimerBlock.cs" file. The class IMyTimerBlock is accessible via in-game script but here on GitHub is no information given about the interface.

I know that the interface has at least the Methods "Trigger()" and "StartCountdown()".

This field only seems to update on a grid the first time you use the ship when in multiplayer.  After that, it never updates again until you logout, login, then use the ship again.  Only then will you see the current status of stored power, and only for that one run.  After that, it won't update again until you repeat the logout/login cycle.

It also seems to update when one connects to a connector.   This is in multiplayer using a dedicated server.

**it says missing RecastDetour lib for navmeh navigation, I had used this lib before.
Do I need to compile dll form https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation by myself?**
When synchronized with **Steam Cloud**, you can't edit or add bluepirnts:

- If you try to add a blueprint from the clipboard it will just **replace** the last one and name it the same.
- You **can't edit** blueprints:

The class is defined [here](https://github.com/KeenSoftwareHouse/SpaceEngineers/blob/master/Sources/Sandbox.Common/ModAPI/Ingame/IMyTerminalBlock.cs#L37)

The spelling is defined [here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/extension) :P 

The [`IMyProjector`](https://github.com/KeenSoftwareHouse/SpaceEngineers/blob/master/Sources/Sandbox.Common/ModAPI/Ingame/IMyProjector.cs) interface returns a `Dictionary<MyDefinitionBase, int>`. However, unless there is some other way to use this, it becomes a useless method to access from the In-Game Script API as the [`MyDefinitionBase`](https://github.com/KeenSoftwareHouse/SpaceEngineers/blob/master/Sources/VRage.Game/Definitions/MyDefinitionBase.cs) is prohibited.

        /// <summary>
        /// A comprehensive list of blocks left to be welded
        /// </summary>
        Dictionary<MyDefinitionBase, int> RemainingBlocksPerType { get; }

Also I found that the method, `RemainingBlocksPerType`, is [not used](https://github.com/KeenSoftwareHouse/SpaceEngineers/search?q=RemainingBlocksPerType&unscoped_q=RemainingBlocksPerType) except for when it is being implemented by the [`MyProjectorBase_ModAPI`](https://github.com/KeenSoftwareHouse/SpaceEngineers/blob/4275f7af265a14ea4f15eb3bda2da5cf7a250e1d/Sources/Sandbox.Game/ModAPI/MyProjectorBase_ModAPI.cs).
Due to the restrictions of the In-Game Script API and it's common "Script is to complex" Error; I would suggest that there should be a method that could get a grid's outline at a specified angle as well as the outline from a certain square and position.
`grid.getOutline(Vector3D angle)` returns `2DOutline` would contain points of collidable points as well as test methods.
`grid.getSlice(Vector3D angle,Vector3D pos)` returns `2DOutline`
`grid.getSlice(Vector3D angle,Vector3D posStart, Vector3D posEnd)` returns `2DOutline`

Reason:
I am currently trying to auto print my ship using for loops and `hasBlock` to a lcd/text panel however the "Script is to complex" Error shows up.
