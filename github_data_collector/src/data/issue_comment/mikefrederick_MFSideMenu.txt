We can disable pan mode of the center navigation controller. But I need to know, how to disable pan mode of center navigation top view controllers and enable iOS default pop to back view controller gesture? 
Thanks for MFSideMenu bar  . I am wondering how we can present the Left Side bar menu on my View. Actually  it is presenting behind My View . 

Note : When user presses side menu , it should appear above my view . 
Waiting for ur reply , 
Thank You .
```
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]];

    MFSideMenuContainerViewController *container = [MFSideMenuContainerViewController
                                                    containerWithCenterViewController:[[UINavigationController alloc]
                                                                                       initWithRootViewController:[[MainViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MainViewController" bundle:nil]]
                                                    leftMenuViewController:[[SideViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"SideViewController" bundle:nil]
                                                    rightMenuViewController:nil];
    self.window.rootViewController = container;
    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
    return YES;
}
```

The menu appear correctly and all of it's contents but the components inside it (button, tableview, etc...) not responding to any interaction . I've created a new clean project and add the menu only on it but with no hope.
Fixed issue of black bar on bottom when either side menu is open. Side menus now have full screen support.
Added a BOOL property that determines if the rotation methods result should be taken from the top view controller of a navigation controller (in the case of a UINavigationController being the centerViewController) or from the navigation controller itself.

This is useful for subclassing a UINavigationController and controlling the rotation from the superclass globally.

The default value is YES, so the default behavior matches the current implementation (using the top view controller by default).

Also added the same kind of BOOL but for the status bar style.
We ran into issues where the shadow does not change on rotation.
### Possible Solution

For us, we pulled the shadow draw methods up to the root view controller, but here's what we did:

We need to redraw the shadow on rotation.
We added a delegate method that redraws the menu on the completion of a rotation.

``` objective-c
- (void)viewWillTransitionToSize:(CGSize)size withTransitionCoordinator:(id<UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator>)coordinator
{
  [coordinator animateAlongsideTransition:^(id<UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorContext> context)
   {
   } completion:^(id<UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorContext> context)
   {
        if(self.shadowEnabled) [self drawMenuShadows];
   }];

  [super viewWillTransitionToSize:size withTransitionCoordinator:coordinator];
}
```

Since we're redrawing the menu at the end of the rotation, and `interfaceOrientation` is deprecated at iOS 8, we could return only the width and height.

``` objective-c
- (CGSize)sizeAdjustedForInterfaceOrientation:(UIView *)view {
        return CGSizeMake(view.frame.size.width, view.frame.size.height);
}
```
