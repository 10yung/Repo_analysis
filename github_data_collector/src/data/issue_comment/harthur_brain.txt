Hi.

I try to learn to detect the gender of names. 
The TrainingData looks like this

> { input: [ 2, 26, 11, 8, 13, 4 ], output: { h: 0, f: 1 } },
>   { input: [ 2, 4, 17, 8, 18, 4 ], output: { h: 0, f: 1 } },
>   { input: [ 2, 4, 18, 0, 8, 17, 4 ], output: { h: 1, f: 0 } },
>   { input: [ 2, 26, 18, 0, 17 ], output: { h: 1, f: 0 } },
>   { input: [ 2, 7, 0, 13, 19, 0, 11 ], output: { h: 0, f: 1 } },
>   { input: [ 2, 7, 0, 13, 19, 26 ], output: { h: 0, f: 1 } },
>   { input: [ 2, 7, 0, 17, 11, 8, 13, 4 ], output: { h: 0, f: 1 } },
>   { input: [ 2, 7, 0, 17, 11, 14, 19 ], output: { h: 1, f: 0 } },

Do you know what I'm doing wrong?

Thx!
You have two flows:  Train and Run.
I import it to Node-Red and press the inject node to Train it.  I get this in the debug window.
"TypeError: May not write null values to stream"

If the demo doesn't work, I am a bit worried.

Hi,
I am trying to use brain for training RSSI and sensors coordinates as inputs and position as output in x,y,z normalized in single number. can you suggest on data modeling this into brain.

inputs : [{x1,y1,z1,distance1},{{x2,y2,z2,distance2},{x3,y3,z3,distance3}}
output: {x*100+y*10+z} as position.

i get constant error while training even up to 20000 iterations.

Regards
 

So I try to run this project, here is the steps I take, not sure if it is correct

```sh
yarn install
```

When it asks

```
Couldn't find any versions for "esprima-six" that matches "0.0.3"
? Please choose a version from this list: (Use arrow keys)
```

Choose `1.0.1`

Then, create a file like `basic.js`

```
var assert = require("assert"),
    brain = require("./lib/brain");

var net = new brain.NeuralNetwork();

net.train([{input: { r: 0.03, g: 0.7, b: 0.5 }, output: { black: 1 }},
           {input: { r: 0.16, g: 0.09, b: 0.2 }, output: { white: 1 }},
           {input: { r: 0.5, g: 0.5, b: 1.0 }, output: { white: 1 }}]);

var output = net.run({ r: 1, g: 
```

Run `node basic.js` to see the result. Hope it help
If I running single my script to recognition a charecter then Neral Network skip layer input, but if require it from server Hapi error occur at line: 366, 367.
And I resolved it:
   `this.biases[i][j] = layer[node] ? layer[node].bias : 0;`
   `this.weights[i][j] = layer[node] ? _(layer[node].weights).toArray() : 0;`
I`ll do like to know: can I reopen this repository? 

I train my network on a set of data containing car data (year of fabrication, mileage, type, model as input and price as output). I try to predict price for another car but output is NaN. NaN is not even among the values in the training set so this seams like an issue with the brain module.

My code is on GitHib Gist, here: https://gist.github.com/alexnix/146fea914501d283c80635087dd87036

On NeuralNetwork.prototype  initialize: method

For loop improvement has been made. Removed the unnecessary condition check  if (layer > 0)  for each iteration on loop.

In the past I have used Brain.js and some other JavaScript based machine learning libraries but unfortunately I have found them not matching my needs. That's why, working on my personal projects, I have developed the idea of creating a different approach by myself. So, sorry to be here to talk about another project but I would really like to receive some opinions and suggestions from experienced people that, being into this specific field, could help me to set useful and shared expectations. By the way, thanks for the great support given to Brain.js so far. The library is called DN2A and is on https://github.com/dn2a/dn2a-javascript

@harthur  I was looking at your profile and saw this:

Why do you not maintain these projects anymore? If you don't have time to do that, why do you not search somebody to keep them alive?
