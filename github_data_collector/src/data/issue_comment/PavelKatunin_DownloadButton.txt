Hello, 
I am not able to see the progress. I am just able to see the circle with stop button but no progress even though the app is downloading the content. I have manually added classes from the Download button folder under the Example app. Below is the relevant code: 
if (self.progress.fractionCompleted > 0){
                    DLog(@"***** %f",self.progress.fractionCompleted);
                    self.downloadProgress.stopDownloadButton.progress = self.progress.fractionCompleted;
                } 
I find the default color of the empty line is gray, and I want to change it to red. and implement the following code.
self.btnDownload.stopDownloadButton.tintColor = UIColor.red

But it does not work, it only makes the filledLine color changed.

Who knows how to change the color of empty line?
Could you add Swift Example Code ?
to make me understand how to use it in swift .

Thank you
kPKDownloadButtonState_Pending for PKDownloadButton state not rotating.
When I tried to compile it on Xcode 8, the compiling fails, and here is the error description:

Does anyone knows what's the going wrong?
Hi, 

I m trying to set the progress to the `stopDownloadButton` in a `NSURLSessionDownloadTask` . I see the stopDownloadButton, but the progress is not increasing. Here is my block:

```
progress:^(NSProgress * _Nonnull downloadProgress) {
     self.downloadButton.stopDownloadButton.progress = downloadProgress.fractionCompleted;
}                                                                
```

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks in advance, 

Hi,

after I upgraded from 6866d4d to ff72143, my app started crashing. I discovered that it is due to me setting attributedTitle of the startDownloadButton to `nil`, and [this code](https://github.com/PavelKatunin/DownloadButton/commit/c7be4aace3efcc9b94cddd05d36774b2fdd990b3#diff-3ad36d91b66ed5d3501db1cd749c212cR117) thus initializing an `NSAttributedString` with a `nil` string.

I think the solution is quite easy - in `[PKDownloadButton updateButton:title:]`, check if the passed `title` is `nil`. If yes, initialize `attrTitle` itself as `nil`.

I think the podspec file is not set correctly. It targets iOS and 7.0 only. I think it should have the greater than or equal to 7.0 in the podspec so it can support all versions.

I currently get an error when trying to add it to my project.

[!] Unable to satisfy the following requirements:
- 'DownloadButton' required by 'Podfile'

My Podfile targets 7.1 and up.
