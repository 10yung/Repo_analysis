## What is the current behavior?
Currently there's no way to align vertically the Spans in a FormattedString

## What is the new behavior?
Spans in FormattedString support the vertical-align CSS property.

Implements #4795.

Updated the #7076 PR to can be merged in master

## What is the current behavior?
There is no way to add links to Labels/TextViews.

## What is the new behavior?
Span now has a `linkClick` event which, when bound, makes it possible for it to be interacted with via tap.

Implements #3671.

reponed #7996 as draft

Related to this issue https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues/7988

For now this PR only checks for auto in width or height. This is clearly not enough.
But the idea is to check if it is necessary to requestLayout on the parent. Most of the times it is not necessary.

In the case of a complex app the improvements is huge!. It makes apps using animations (not using {N} animation system which is too limited) far more snappier.

This is only a POC!
Good morning,

I'm trying to find out if a file exists prior to (example) delete it or rename it, and of course, I'm using the exists function of File class, but it always return false, so this is causing a big problem for me. Here there are my examples:

try 1:
```JavaScript
const fileSystemModule = require("tns-core-modules/file-system");
const documents = fileSystemModule.knownFolders.documents();
const path = fileSystemModule.join(documents.path, "my_sqlite_database_db.db");
const exists = fileSystemModule.File.exists(path);
console.log(\`Does my_sqlite_database_db.db exists: ${exists}\`);
```
try 2:
```JavaScript
const fileSystemModule = require("tns-core-modules/file-system");
const documents = fileSystemModule.knownFolders.documents();
const path = fileSystemModule.join(documents.path, "my_sqlite_database_db.db");
const path2 = fileSystemModule.path.normalize(path); // <--- here is the change
const exists = fileSystemModule.File.exists(path2);
console.log(\`Does my_sqlite_database_db.db exists: ${exists}\`);

```
I've already verified that my file (my_sqlite_database_db.db, that is actually a sqlite database) is there and can be opened without any issue.


Here is my version info:

iOS: 13.3 (simulator iPhone 8) (Android not tested yet)
tns: 6.2.2
tns-core-modules@6.3.1
tns-ios: 6.2.0

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

The `Image` placeholder in BottomNavigation is currently supporting resources (`res://`), local images or font icons (`font://`).

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Extend the image support by providing options to pass **base64** string or image with **url()**


**Environment**
Provide version numbers for the following components (information can be retrieved by running `tns info` in your project folder or by inspecting the `package.json` of the project):
 - CLI: 6.3.2
 - Cross-platform modules: 6.3.2
 - Android Runtime: 6.3.1
 - iOS Runtime: 6.3.0
 - Plugin(s):
  - nativescript-angular: 8.20.4

**Describe the bug**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Please, explain whether it's a build time error or a runtime error. More detailed logs can be easily obtained by following the instructions in this guide: https://docs.nativescript.org/get-support#how-to-obtain-diagnostic-reports. -->
Navigation to another page from a `BottomNavigation` and back again breaks the content of the current tab.
ListView can no longer be scrolled, items cannot be tapped etc.

**To Reproduce**
<!-- Add commands used or steps taken to reproduce the behaviour. -->
1. Create a `BottomNavigation`, with a `ListView` on one of the tabs.
2. Add a page-route to another page (full page, not tab content).
3. Navigate to the other page
4. Go back.
5. The ListView can no longer be scrolled and the items cannot be tapped.
6. Switch to another tab and back again.
7. The ListView now can be scrolled again. (If you tapped on an item, that action is triggered)

**Expected behavior**
To be able to interact with the content of the tab.

**Sample project**
<!-- If possible, provide a link from the [Playground](https://play.nativescript.org) with reproduction of the problem. If not, consider attaching a sample project or link to a repository with such project. -->
I've created a demo project in my ns-debugging repository:

https://github.com/m-abs/ns-debugging/tree/master/bottomnavigation-break-on-navigation

**Additional context**
<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->
I've tested on Android 10, both hardware device (Oneplus 7T pro) and emulator.
Might be related to the fix for #8104 

**Environment**
 - CLI: 6.3.3
 - Cross-platform modules: 6.3.2
 - Android Runtime:
 - iOS Runtime: 6.3.0
 - Plugin(s):

**Describe the bug**
Unable to build when using native api (iOS) in angular code sharing project. I have tried using multiple different ios specific functions and classes but I always get the same error. "Cannot find name ..."

When trying to access the same function in a regular project (non-code sharing) everything works as expected.

**To Reproduce**
1. Create a code-sharing project.
2. Install tns-platform-declarations (https://www.npmjs.com/package/tns-platform-declarations)
3.  Write some code that interacts with the native api.
4. Build/Run

**Expected behavior**
The code-sharing project should build just like the regular one.

**Sample project**
https://github.com/johandrott/ns-codesharing

**Additional context**
Console output:
ERROR in src/app/home/home.component.tns.ts:9:21 - error TS2304: Cannot find name 'UIVisualEffectView'.

9     public overlay: UIVisualEffectView;
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
src/app/home/home.component.tns.ts:19:22 - error TS2304: Cannot find name 'UIApplication'.

19       const window = UIApplication.sharedApplication.keyWindow;

**Environment**
Provide version numbers for the following components (information can be retrieved by running `tns info` in your project folder or by inspecting the `package.json` of the project):
 - CLI: playground
 - Android Runtime: playground
 - Plugin(s): none

**Describe the bug**
In the app I am building I require a TextField to be positioned quite low in a StackLayout. The result is that on my Android device the soft keyboard tries to open but closes before fully doing so. See [this](https://imgur.com/a/tRlcDcy) video.

**To Reproduce**
It can also be reproduced in [playground](https://play.nativescript.org/?template=play-ng&id=h6pubY).

**Expected behavior**
I would expect the UI to move up like it does with all the other textfields due to the `windowSoftInputMode`. I have tried the modes `adjustPan` and `adjustResize`.
Hi,
Having issue when running to XCode, terminating the app. Every time I click back button of application and navigate to different route.

Here's the code:
```
if (this.routerExtensions.canGoBack()) {
this.routerExtensions.back();
} else {
this.routerExtensions.navigate(['/nav/default'], { clearHistory: true });
}
```

```
