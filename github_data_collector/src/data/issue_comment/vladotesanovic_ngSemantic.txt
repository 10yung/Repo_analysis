I follow the instruction to install ng-semantic. It is installed. 

When I try to start the app using "ng serve", I got the following error:

`

Reset <sm-select> after form submit? #148  
clear content when the model change to null or undefined
use: [checked]="true" as attribute.
 Allows user to pass in an error check function and applies error style if the function returns true.
I read all the documentation and I do not find it compatible with angular 4

I know that with a model you can change the multiple selection
but if i clear the model to an empty array, the selected items still exist
how can i delete it with my own preferences which item i want to delete

Seems a bit dead to me, doesn't it?
When you click on a tab to activate it, the content is activated at the same time. When the activate Input() is used to activate a tab programmatically via the component.ts file however, the content is not activated and only the tab changes.
tab component is not working on ie11. When you use sm-tab, all tabs are shown and no hide/show functionality is working.
