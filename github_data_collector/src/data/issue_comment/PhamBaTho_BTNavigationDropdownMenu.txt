Hi, I've done some work for displaying icon on navigation bar and table cell.

1. Prepend icon to navigation title.
2. Prepend icon to table cell title.
3. Add new `init()` parameter `itemImages:[UIImage]? = nil`
   If set, the corresponding item image would be added to each table cell.
4. Add  new configuration option `shouldChangeTitleImage`
  If set to true, the icon of the selected item would be presented on navigation bar.
5. Add new configuration option `iconImage`
  A placeholder used for cell item postioning.
5. Update touch area in `layoutSubview` to avoid small touch area problem.

This problem still exists and I cannot fix it.

Can you please help with this?

I installed the pod correctly and whenever I build I get tons of errors but the main issue is saying this:

Im opening the .workspace file so I'm sure that's not the issue.

I also tried setting "Buid Active Architecture Only" to 'NO' 

I tried using pods deintegrate as well and then re running pod install but that also didn't fix the error.

I also tried adding the pod in this manner as another issue with an answer suggested. But still no luck.
