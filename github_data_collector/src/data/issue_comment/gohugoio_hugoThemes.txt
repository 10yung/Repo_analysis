# Theme submission

**Please make sure that you have read the [theme submission guidelines](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes/blob/master/README.md#adding-a-theme-to-the-list) before submitting a theme**. The guidelines provide all relevant information and requirements that **have to be fulfilled** before the submission. Please tick the relevant boxes for your theme in the checklist below:

**Link to my theme repository:** https://github.com/kongdivin/hugo-theme-okayish-blog

### I made sure that...

- [x] the repository contains a good `README.md` describing my theme
- [x] an open source license has been added to `LICENSE.md`
- [x] all metadata have been added to `theme.toml`
- [x] screenshots have been added in the `images/` folder with the [required dimensions](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes/blob/master/README.md#media)
- [ ] in case I'm using a customized demo via the exampleSite folder that
    - [ ] `https://example.com` is set as base url in `exampleSite/config.{toml, yaml, json}` to [avoid the abuse of unused domains](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/2575)
    - [ ] I tested that my theme's demo works with the content directory of [gohugoio/HugoBasicExample](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoBasicExample/tree/master/content)
- [x] I tested my theme against the [gohugoio/HugoBasicExample](https://github.com/gohugoio/HugoBasicExample)
    - [x] I've checked the developer tools' console in my browser for error messages
- [ ] in case my theme is using Hugo Pipes features like `toCSS` and `PostCSS` that I have committed the `/resources` directory with all generated assets, for my theme to work in the basic version of Hugo

**N.B.** By submitting a theme to the Hugo Themes Showcase you understand that **you need to maintain your theme**. You will need to keep an eye on whether your theme's demo generates on the Hugo website, whenever there is a new release. We are a very small team and we just cannot keep up opening issues in the various theme repositories to notify authors. Whenever a theme demo breaks and remains broken then at some point it will be removed from the list without prior warning. If you no longer wish to maintain a theme please let us know.

Feel free to ask questions. We're glad to help.

This issue records the 60 themes currently in the Hugo Themes showcase that have not been updated and currently use deprecated variables in their templates that will be removed from Hugo at some point in the future.

These themes throw console warnings in the deploy logs of the Hugo Themes showcase.

@bep I am notifying you with this issue about the need to apply the removal of the various deprecated variables gradually (whenever you deem necessary) and not all at once. As you know the Build Script allows for 50 broken theme demos, beyond this number we won't be able to update the Themes Site, until we have removed these themes.
