# Report
~~Markdown~~ Highlighter JS incorrectly highlights code block

## What did you do?
I’m using FSNotes.app that leverages Down and thus Highlight.js. 

Anyway, try this markdown:

```
1. List
    1. Nested list
    2. Second item

    This line is still list item 1

Test
```

## What did you expect to happen?
`This line is still list item 1` should be rendered as part of list item 1.

## What happened instead?
`This line is still list item 1` is rendered as a code block.

This is contrary to what every other markdown preview I have found does it (with the exception of Sublime Text 3)

### Possible solution
Swap out (largely abandoned) Highlight.js with google-code-prettify. It’s the only syntax highlighter I’ve found that is still actively developed.
