I am trying to reproduce your work , but `predIsMSIMUTScore` is not defined in https://github.com/jnkather/MSIfromHE/blob/27b351b9220583271cd2bcedbc9e75459916e06c/step_07_evaluate_performance_per_patient.m#L86
any missing?
thanks.
I am trying to reproduce the results and I found following function is not provided in the subroutine.

currMPP = Info2MPPrescue(currImInfo,ni(end),... % extract MPP; if fail try to rescue
         cnst.rescueFolder,strrep(strrep(currImName,'.svs',''),'.tiff',''));

Though I can use Info2MPP() which I found in the subroutine, but I think it does not help on many WSIs from the TCGA-COAD (colon).
