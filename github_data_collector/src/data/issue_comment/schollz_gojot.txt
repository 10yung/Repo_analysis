I tried setting my editor to `nvim` and `gojot` opens the program alright, but I don't see any of my entries: just the default splash screen for [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/).

[Here's an asciinema of what I'm seeing](https://asciinema.org/a/E0VgWnWWTb8bz3oZ9Ji9Kqrws).

```
gojot version 2.1.0 f881b41 2016-11-17T07:03:28-0500 osx
NVIM v0.2.2
```

`vim` works fine.

gojot looks for the pubing.gpg file to initialize.  If the keys were created under gnupg 2.1 which is now default in Ubuntu 17.10 and other distro releases, the pubring.gpg does not exist and instead the new keybox file format is used.

Is there a work-around for this?
