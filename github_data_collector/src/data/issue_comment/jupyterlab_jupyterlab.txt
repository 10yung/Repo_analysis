When using "Create new view for output" with a cell that outputs a Bokeh plot, it just doubles the plot in the original cell output, with no plot output in the new View. If a second "Output View" is created, the plot is tripled in the original, and so on...

Edit: the same happens with "New View for Notebook".

The issue is the same as [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56135643/create-new-view-for-output-in-jupyter-lab-does-not-work-for-holoviews) (with holoviews).

Other outputs (such as strings in the example below) are instead correctly sent to the new "child" Views.

Interestingly, splitting the original cell (Shift+Ctrl+-), while making disappear all the plots in the original cell output, correctly updates the first created "child" View. All the other "child" Views remain instead without any plot. This splitting also makes "orphan" all child Views (they are no longer linked/updated to the original cell).

Code to reproduce the issue (tested on a trusted notebook, in a fresh conda environment with `jupyterlab 1.2.5`, `bokeh 1.4.0`, `python 3.7.6`):

```
from bokeh.io import output_notebook, show
from bokeh.plotting import figure

output_notebook()

print("First line")

p = figure()
p.circle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 2, 4, 5])

show(p)

print("Second line")
```
Some members of the JupyteLab team had a meeting with the team at Kite, discussion the technical constraints of integrating Kite LSP, Completions, and eventually snippets into JupyterLab. These are the meeting notes:

JupyterLab <> Kite call, Jan 17 2020

Agenda
* Presentation from Kite on what an integration would look like from a user perspective.
* Discussion of surfacing an integration to users


## Presentation, how the collaboration would benefit users

Slide deck: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jPDwrrn0IiGbF87aCVA1zCERlSkHihPHpU7qjvetPyo/edit?usp=sharing

### v0: Imminently possible using the existing infrastructure in JLab for completions

Noticable improvement in completions UX
* Completions sorted by relevance
* Show docs for highlighted completion in the contextual help panel
* Completions that show up automatically instead of needing to press Tab
* Faster completions: side by side GIF showing difference in speed between Jedi and Kite
* 1.4x more completions than Jedi

Function assist
* Richer contextual help
* Keyword arguments not in the argspec but learned from code on Github
* Updating docs display based on which parameter the user is typing


### v1: More build-out

Snippets
* Starts with extending the editor to support snippets (inserted text with template variables)
* Kite can return completions contain snippets
* Helps the user fill in arguments to function calls

Users could also define snippets. Example use-cases
* Common import sets
* Common code snippets

Jason: We would need a snippet editor.


### v2: Future ideas

"Search reference examples" to find common answers.
* Kite has a large curated data set of answers to common queries
* Examples: https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fkite.com%2Fpython%2Fanswers%2F&oq=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fkite.com%2Fpython%2Fanswers


### Discussion of the above

* Jason: This functionality sounds great!
* Brian: We also have infrastructure for sharing data-sets across extensions.
* Jason: Snippet editor-like functionality is: we're working on a new way for users to write very short extensions (< 100 LoC) and those happen via the JLab UI.


## Discussion of extension manager

### Summary

Goal
* Helping users as much as possible by making it easy to discover relevant & high quality extensions

Summary of requirements:
* Neutrality / Level playing field
* Low burden on curating extensions
* Explicitly not taking Liability for users installing 'dangerous' extensions
* Low code maintenance burden on Jupyter core team (e.g. avoiding a live service to maintain)


### Discussion log

Brian
* There's a lot of potential to surface extensions to users more clearly.
* → There's opportunity to make it easier for users to find the extensions that are most helpful to them.
* E.g. how stable is the extension, how popular, etc.
* The first step would be to re-design the extension manager and in general a notion of the extension universe.

Examples of other extension marketplaces
* Firefox surfaces extensions based on what the user is doing.
* Jetbrains recently revamped their extension marketplace.
* VS Code does a pretty good job.

Jason: We don't have the infrastructure to heavily curate an universe of extensions.
* So we punted to NPM.

Brian: There's a line we can't cross: implying that any particular extensions (that we don't own / verify quality) are special.
* But the internet has many models now that don't require central approval for things to bubble up.
* E.g. popular → likely secure, but vetted by the community.
* (Any legal risks?)

Jason: This is a good example of the types of conversations / collaborations we like to have with motivated 3rd parties with resources to push things forward. (And adding perspective beyond open source devs.)

Brian: There are ways to go beyond the extension manager → contextual recommendations.
* Level playing field is key.
* In theory another extension could do the things you do and also show up in contextual help.

Brian cool idea: using ML to manage prompts

Daniel: When I was writing Go I didn't know about go-imports and once I found it I realized I had a lost opportunity there.

Brian: In an app store there are multiple levels of sorting: (1) is it in the list? (2) how they're sorted.
* Should we have a mechanism to [lightly] curate the list of extensions, managed from code on Github (e.g. pull requests, etc)?
* Implements minimal oversight to e.g. blacklist a hostile extension.
* But avoid the problem of large-scale review/approval of a traditional app store.
* Whitelist vs blacklist approach, and blacklist approach is lower maintenance.
* Jetbrains is the full commercial app store experience and VS Code is much more informal.
I recently installed Jupyterlab and after i launch it, i am unable to browse contents of Desktop, Documents and Downloads. Every other directory that it lists, i am able to browse into except these three where majority of my work is. I can click on these three folders repeated but nothing happens.

Anaconda navigator 1.9.7
Jupterlab 1.2.5
jupyter notebook 6.0.2

However, jupyternotebook works perfectly fine.

Not to mention
I have rebooted OS
clean installed anaconda navigator as mentioned on their website.
Still same issue


If i repeatedly click on any of these folders, i get this error message in anaconda-navigator

## Description
In jupyter notebook, I used the following styles to control DataFrame display:
```
%%html
<style> 
table {display: inline-block;}

.dataframe table {
  width: 100% ;
  border-collapse: collapse ;
  border: 1px black solid ;
}

.dataframe thead tr th {
    vertical-align: center;
    text-align: left;    
    border: 1px black solid ;
    padding: 10px ;
}

.dataframe tbody tr th {
    vertical-align: top;
    text-align: left;    
    font-weight: normal;
    border: 1px black solid ;
    padding: 10px ;
}

.dataframe tbody tr td {
    vertical-align: top;
    text-align: left;    
    border: 1px black solid ;
    padding: 10px ;
}
```
This seems to be ignored when using jupyter lab.

## Reproduce
Create a notebook and include the %%html above.
Create a sample DataFrame df
Error: the .dataframe class changes are ignored by jupyter lab, but used by jupyter notebook

## Expected behavior
display(df) should follow the styles you set.

## Context

- Operating System and version: macOS 10.15.2
- Browser and version: Safari 13.0.4
- JupyterLab version: 1.1.4


Is there some way to detect addition/removal of workspaces?

I Would like to know if jupyterlab expose a handler for post `rename` file as it does for `save` with the handler named `post_save` ?

Thanks
