Hello, I am a 4th year student in ITCarlow, Ireland. a part of my project is TDOA localization. I want to ask you a question that if I put all the microphones array as a line, 5cm distance between each microphone.
I got the bad result on localization, However, When I rise the sample rate as larger as I can, the result become accuracy, but I can't do this on real world.
i am currently doing a project similar to this using mbed system with two electret microphone breakboard from sparkfun. I am amazed by the sum of the algorithm that you have derived. i respect your work and effort that you have made.But i do have certain question to ask regarding this project that u have completed.i am not familiar with matlab programming and i have not touch on it before during my study.Do u have a c++ format of the program? so that i could further understand on it. In your expository paper, you stated that it only yields a solution when M>=5. To my next question, do my 2 microphone work similar when using with your algorithm?
