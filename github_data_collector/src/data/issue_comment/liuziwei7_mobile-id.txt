I download the prototxt and caffeModel from google drive , but can't load in in my matlab,  matlab will crash when I run the following code.

def = fullfile('./models','mobile_id_gallery.prototxt');
net = fullfile('./models','mobile_id.caffemodel');
convNet = caffe.Net(def,net,'test'); //matlab crash at this line.

for example,sub mean image or just divide some value
Runtime on CPU
Memory footprint during inference
97.32% (mean classification accuracy)
250FPS (frames per second)

is it information about caffe?
Hi, there. Could you release more about the setting of training parameters. I found it difficult to reproduce the result. 
Hi, I am using torch openface for testing the performance of lfw dataset.
Since your model is caffe based, I use loadcaffe library for torch to convert the model into torch.

Standard preprocessing process of caffe is resizing the scale to [0,255] and substract the mean value of the image, and the input channel should be BGR.

However, I still cannot reproduce the performance of mobild_id model.

Can you please tell me what kind of preprocessing do you perform? Or any special operation?


Also, in the paper they claim to use Euclidean distance for face verification in LFW dataset instead of SVM or Joint Bayesian, but the github page claims that one has to use Joint Bayesian to get the 97% performance. Does this mean the provided model cannot get similar performance in the paper by using Euclidean distance?


Hello, @liuziwei7  I want to train my model use my dataset  and use your pre-trained model to predict ,so I need the train_val.prototxt solver.prototxt  deploy.prototxt  files. Can you commit these files?
