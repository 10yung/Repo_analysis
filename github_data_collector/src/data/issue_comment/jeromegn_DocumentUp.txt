Dear @jeromegn,

DocumentUp is such a wonderful project. Thank you! 

I want to use it to create a simple 'blog' whose content is stored in one single markdown file. I love this simplicity! :+1: 

I have one question:

Would it be possible to add an option - similar to disable issues - to disable the "Fork me on Github" label?

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/170947/9958530/3431000e-5e0b-11e5-8ffd-b44506b955d8.png)

Thankfully,

Robert

I would like to create a documentation site with multiple markdown pages. I have a standard readme file, with a dozen or more additional pages for specific purposes. How can I add navigation menu links and sections for the child pages?

Compare http://revelytix.github.io/backbone-nestify/ with https://github.com/revelytix/backbone-nestify.

The former has ugly line breaks, the latter does not. I'm guessing this is due to the line breaks in the README.md file itself (I have made a change to break all lines at 80 chars).

To automatically recompile my page each time I change my readme, I included a Webhook to `http://documentup.com/recompile` as mentioned in the documentation, which seems to work fine as it always returns response code `200`.

Unfortunately, the page is not recompiled; that is, the changes I pushed to my readme is not not being reflected in the page. The page hosted at `documentup.com` is also not changed.

Please do look into this.

First of all, thank you @jeromegn for this awesome tool / service.
I think it would make sense for DocumentUp to have an option to generate the docs from another file than README.md, like DOCS.md, as one may want to keep the README file small or to contain other information than the whole docs.

I imagine something like:

``` yml
name: DocumentUp
file: DOCS.md
```

Could of course also be `filepath` or something similar.

Another question not worth opening a separate issue for:
is it possible to use `.documentup.json` instead of `.documentup.yml`? I saw this in https://github.com/wout/svg.js.

I'd like to make custom themes for DocumentUp.

Can we have an option to, say, pass it via `http://documentup.com/kriskowal/q?css=http://...` ?

I understand from the docs that the documents are only recompiled when the following url is visited: 
http://documentup.com/{user}/{repository}/recompile

To recompile it automatically you can add a webhook to Github. 
So I've set the Payload URL to: http://documentup.com/recompile
Shouldn't that be _http://documentup.com/{user}/{repository}/recompile_ ?

It didn't seem to work when I left the content type to _application/json_ (default), but changing it to _application/x-www-form-urlencoded_ seems to help, it then received an `ok` as response. 
Maybe you can add this to your readme? 

I left the event that should trigger the hook to _Just the push event_, which is the default. I couldn't find the _Post-receive hook_.
