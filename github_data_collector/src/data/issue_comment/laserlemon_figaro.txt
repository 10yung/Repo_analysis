There have been rails and heroku failing tests for a very long time. See https://travis-ci.org/laserlemon/figaro/pull_requests for a history of failed tests for pull requests.
Let's say you have `app_key: e$Gu768HKkiec` in your application.yml. When calling `Figaro.env.app_key` Figaro will display the value as `e\$Gu768HKkiec` which does not match what is the config file because of `\` escape character. Figaro needs to be improved to remove the escape characters.

I've used Figaro for years on Heroku, and am even using it at present with Capistrano. I'm not a fan of Rails encrypted secrets, and even with the Rails 6 enhancements it is not as easy to use and full-featured as Figaro!

What is the status of this project? I see there is a v2 branch but it has been quiet for a while.

Do you need some help to get this released @laserlemon ? 
I :heart: Figaro!

I not found any proposals on this. Is it possible to introduce herarchical structure? Currently we in able to make linear list of settings/variables (excepting environments).

I think it will be helpful to be able to avoid repeating for some settings like:
```yml
database_host: localhost
database_name: postgrdb
database_user: postgrusr
database_pass: 111

# or

deploy_user: root
deploy_port: 2121
deploy_server: example.com
deploy_dir: /var/www/domain
deploy_branch: master
```
It might be look like this:
```yml
database:
  host: localhost
  name: postgrdb
  user: postgrusr
  pass: 111

# or

deploy:
  user: root
  port: 2121
  server: example.com
  dir: /var/www/domain
  branch: master
```
This is only for definition things. I think it's need to be merged into single string variables as well as previously: `deploy_user` (although it may be available and by the new way)

In this case the first level keywords like `development`, `production` or `test` can work as previously - to define environment.
```yml
production:
  database:
    user: prod_user
    pass: prod_pass
```
This feature will especially helpful for some developers who uses variables prefixed with an app name, like:
```yml
app_database_name: db_name
# ...etc.
```

Thank you! :smile: 

I added the configuration in config/application.yml file:
KEYCLOAK_REALM: 'aaa-dev'

then I try to use it in config/keycloak.yml file:
realm: <%= ENV["KEYCLOAK_REALM"] %>

but it seems not working, any suggestions?
Hello

Thanks for Figaro.

I'm thinking about moving one of my apps from Heroku to Elastic Beanstalk on AWS.

Figaro seems to be Heroku-focused. As far as I can see, I have a few options to make Figaro work on Elastic Beanstalk.

1) Copy the environment variables into my Elastic Beanstalk environment one-by-one.

I'd like to avoid doing this if possible because I have a lot of them and it is bound to be error-prone.

2) Just remove application.yml from the gitignore file.

I haven't tested this yet but this seems like the route of least resistance. It obviously undercuts the whole purpose of using Figaro in the first place though.

3) Generate a remote configuration file

You mention this is in the docs but I can't see any examples. I'm not sure what this means. Could you elaborate a bit on how Figaro could retrieve a file from an S3 bucket, for example?

Thanks

Tom
Is it currently possible to control what in the `application.yml` file after running `figaro install`? I've looked around docs but can't find anything conclusive...
Eg instead of it looking like:
```
# Add configuration values here, as shown below.
#
# pusher_app_id: "2954"
# pusher_key: 7381a978f7dd7f9a1117
# pusher_secret: abdc3b896a0ffb85d373
# stripe_api_key: sk_test_2J0l093xOyW72XUYJHE4Dv2r
# stripe_publishable_key: pk_test_ro9jV5SNwGb1yYlQfzG17LHK
#
# production:
#   stripe_api_key: sk_live_EeHnL644i6zo4Iyq4v1KdV9H
```
having custom contents like:
```
# custo_key_1: "2954"
# custom_key_2: 7381a978f7dd7f9a1117
```
Hi,

When I run : 
`figaro heroku:set -e production `
and
`figaro heroku:set`
I have : 
`Could not find command "heroku:set".`

I tried few versions of figaro like : 
gem 'figaro', '~> 1.1', '>= 1.1.1'
gem 'figaro', github: 'sealocal/figaro'
gem 'figaro', '>= 1.0.0.rc1'
gem 'figaro'

Then : 
bundle install
bundle binstubs figaro
figaro install
spring stop

but the command is still not found.

Versions:
ruby '2.3.5'
gem 'rails', '~> 5.1.4'

I've done some search and try a lot of things without find any solution ðŸ˜¢ 
  
  
Hello, I'm trying to push my application.yml keys to heroku with the command `figaro heroku:set -e production` but I'm getting the following error:

```
!    Please specify a version along with Heroku's API MIME type. For example, `Accept: application/vnd.heroku+json; version=3`.
```

I'm on Ubuntu 16.04, I've tried to reinstall heroku as a standalone and through npm, still getting the same error.

halp!
