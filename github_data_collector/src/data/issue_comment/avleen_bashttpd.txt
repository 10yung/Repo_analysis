If you get an error with netcat about option "-e" missing, it's because linux use by default an alternative version of netcat: GNU-Netcat.
To use Traditional netcat:
`sudo apt install netcat`
`sudo rm /etc/alternatives/nc`
`sudo ln -s /bin/nc.traditional /etc/alternatives/nc`

Now use the alias "nc" instead "netcat":
`:;while true;do nc -lp 8080 -e ./bashttpd ;done`

(ctrl-z to stop file descriptor listening and `kill -9 %1` 2 times to kill the process)
If you want to load the process in background: `:;while true;do nc -lp 8080 -e ./bashttpd ;done&`
Hi! Now the URI is being url-decoded before being handled by on_uri_match() and unconditionally(): this is useful in case of html forms.
This can be done with:

`:;while [ $? -eq 0 ];do nc -lp 8888 -e ./bashttpd ;done`

you can listen on socket directly with bash

Added improvements for:
  - minimal POST support
  - Binary files transmission (such as images) support
Adding a missed word.

Changed serve_file_from_dir to check for index.html then fall back to checking for index.htm


Hi, 

i've fixed support for binary files.

I also did some cleanup, indenting, removed semicolons, changed curly brackets to the same scheme always and i've added an example for browsing local directory in browser with support for view/download files (serve_dir_or_file_from).

There was also an issue with older tree version (i've 1.5.2 here) which i've fixed.
It treats "" as directory, weird but it stopped the serve_dir stuff working.

Additionally i've added character encoding.

There's still an issue with filenames with spaces in it. Maybe will check next week.

Cheers, Frank
