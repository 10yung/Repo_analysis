Please let me know how to use this in swift 5 with Xcode 11. and how to use this in scene delegate class. 
After switch centerviewcontroller from leftViewController (didSelectedRowAtIndexPath method) with this code:

```
      ViewController *vc = [mainStoryboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"CenterViewController"];
                if (vc)
                    [appDelegate.drawerController setCenterViewController:vc withCloseAnimation:YES completion:nil];


                break;
```
There are no more top bar buttons (button to open/close sidebar)

Why? 

Thanks
Is it possible to disable open/close by swiping? 

I want to disable swipe. when we click on UIBarButtonItem then it will open.

Thank You in advance
The memory hikes up when rootviewController is changed from app delegate. Drawer is somewhere retaining it's reference. 
I swipe my finger from the left side bezel onto the screen. This should open the menu. But it doesn't. My gesture seems to pass through to the scroll bounce.

The scroll view is edge to edge with horizontal scroll. This seems to capture the gesture where I swipe from the bezel onto the screen.


I'm having an application which can be used in the landscape also.
But left menu should be used in portrait mode only. So center view can be rotated to either landscape left or landscape right.
I wrote below code in LeftMenu, but it is also preventing Centerview to being rotated.
```
-(void)willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration {
    if (UIDeviceOrientationIsLandscape([UIDevice currentDevice].orientation)){
        [[UIDevice currentDevice] setValue: [NSNumber numberWithInteger:UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait] forKey:@"orientation"];
    }
}
```

How can I achieve this (leftmenu should be in portrait only while centerView can be used in landscape and portrait)?
`-(void)setDrawerVisualStateBlock:(void(^)(MMDrawerController * drawerController, MMDrawerSide drawerSide, CGFloat percentVisible))drawerVisualStateBlock`

Above callback only return percentVisible: 0.0 and percentVisible: 1.0 upon start and completion of swipe gesture. Can we have continuous values while user being swiping left/right drawer?
Hello, i am using mmdrawer controller in swift 4, i have a homeView controller, and in that home that homeView controller there is a bar button item from where the right view controller in calling. my question is after right view controller is closing, HomeVc is appearing, then which view controller life cycle is called?
