Is it possible to add RSA support? 

When i try to decrypt big file(around 100mb) that time it shows  around double sized memory  allocation when i profile the application for memory allocation.

Can you guide me if any way to do stream read data from file and stream output the decrypted data which can be written to  file at last.

I have big size file to decrypt. any way for asynchronous decryption? It hangs execution un till decryption completed.

Using system method to base64, and check OS version.

As noted in https://github.com/nicklockwood/Base64 readme.

"In the iOS 7 and Mac OS 10.9 SDKs, Apple introduced new base64 methods on NSData that make it unnecessary to use a 3rd party base 64 decoding library. What's more, they exposed access to private base64 methods that are retrospectively available back as far as IOS 4 and Mac OS 6."

I wanted to fork and submit a PR. But in NSData base64 encoding, there is this `NSDataBase64EncodingOptions` parameter that I'm not sure which one I should use. So I created this issue instead.

Currently CS uses malloc() to allocate memory.  This allocation is not zeroed and old data resides there.  While most operations will succeed and overwrite the data, the best practice (especially in a security class) is to use calloc() instead to zero out the allocation before use.

```
malloc(1024) -> calloc(1024,1)
```
