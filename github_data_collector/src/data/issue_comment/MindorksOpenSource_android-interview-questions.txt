Hi all,

I found that there is a better visualized article on activity launch modes with a more descriptive explanation.

Is it possible to link to this article on the `Activity -> What are "launch modes" `?
Add some new interview questions

The github link provided with the question "Differences between abstract classes and interfaces?" is not available anymore. Please remove/update it.
Add the difference between Serializable and Parcelable.
The descriptions are inverted.

Instantiation is when you allocate memory in the heap (for objects)
Initialization is when you assign a value to the object's fields.

To my knowledge answer to this question: "What are the access modifiers you know? What does each one do?" is wrong.

default is more restrictive than protected because default's scope is within the same class and package whereas the scope of protected is the same class, same package, and other packages as well through inheritance.

So the order of the access modifiers from the least restrictive to the most restrictive should be:
                **public > protected > default > private**
What is the right answer for design questions?

I think it would be great to separate the questions between junior, middle and senior
This is really awesome! It really helps to prepare for the Android developer interview. When will we have answers? Some questions are hard or too general to me, it's difficult to find the answer.

Thanks
