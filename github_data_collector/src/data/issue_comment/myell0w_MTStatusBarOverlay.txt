MTStatusBarOverlay will fill all my screen when it appears. That is because [UIWindow init] will set it's size (MTStatusBarOverlay.frame.size) to screen size, after it calls initWithFrame method. So I changed the code like this. That means all the code in [MTStatusBarOverlay init] will be called after [UIWindow init]. This did solve the problem.

BTW, I found this problem in iOS 9.3.4


Changed initWithFrame to init because in init method super calls _resizeWindowToFullScreenIfNessesary and it sets frame as full screen.
Added setting clear background color to self because after tap and view shrink there are black background of self.

Since upgrading to Xcode 7 and deploying on iOS 9 the UI becomes unresponsive as long as a message is displayed on the status bar. Is this a known issue or is there perhaps something wrong with the way I'm using it?

Fix for iOS 9 on which the overlay takes over the entire screen

When testing the overlay in iOS 9 on iPad, the overlay takes over the entire screen and/or is positioned incorrectly. I have created a sample project with just the sample code:

```
-(IBAction)showStatus:(id)sender {

    MTStatusBarOverlay *overlay = [MTStatusBarOverlay sharedInstance];
    overlay.animation = MTStatusBarOverlayAnimationFallDown;  // MTStatusBarOverlayAnimationShrink
    overlay.detailViewMode = MTDetailViewModeHistory;         // enable automatic history-tracking and show in detail-view
    //overlay.delegate = self;
    overlay.progress = 0.0;
    [overlay postMessage:@"Following @myell0w on Twitter…"];
    overlay.progress = 0.1;
    // ...
    [overlay postMessage:@"Following myell0w on Github…" animated:NO];
    overlay.progress = 0.5;
    // ...
    [overlay postImmediateFinishMessage:@"Following was a good idea!" duration:2.0 animated:YES];
    overlay.progress = 1.0;

}
```

iOS 8.3 only, if you start an app in landscape with the status bar showing then rotate to portrait there is an issue.  A large black box appears

- major refactor for iOS 7+ 
  - remove old OS 6 style status bar background "hex" image
  - remove old OS 6 style label shadow
  - add ability to set custom text/background color, overriding default coloring that depends on UIStatusBarStyle
- add demo project
- add demo.gif


i admit it could be a new function requirement rather than a bug

Thanks
