First of all, it's a great application, thanks for creating it.

How to create resource like namespace w/o leaving k9s. I tried to type 's' to invoke shell, but the screen flashes and nothing happened. I am not about to find info in any doc. Any pointers?

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Kubernetes YAML is often extremely verbose.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The k9s YAML viewer could have a shortcut to toggle [Koki Short](https://docs.koki.io/short/) syntax view. This goes hand-in-hand with k9s making kubernetes resource discovery more approachable.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
It would be nice to see this integrated. I am not sure if the k9s plugin system currently allows for shelling out the the short binary with YAML contents to then view the simplified version.

It seems that the "force delete" option introduced after  https://github.com/derailed/k9s/issues/215 got broken somewhere.
In 0.11.x and 0.12.0 the option to force delete is there but it has no effect. 
I can --force --grace-period=0 delete with kubectl of course.

Let me know if I need to add more details / logs (I know that k9s can log some of its events, but I never tried it)

**Describe the bug**
It would appear this bug has arisen as a result of the most recent changes adding the logic for detecting connectivity with the k8s API server. More specifically, this has to do with the DialTimeout call that is made. It should be noted that currently for my setup, communication is achieved to the k8s API-server via rancher's proxy. Based on the code changes I can't imagine this has any impact but it's worth noting nonetheless.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open k9s session
2. Enter a pod shell
3. Exit from the container
4. Attempt to display the YAML or Describe the pod (may take a few tries)
5. K9s should terminate the current session

**Expected behavior**
The session should not be terminated as there was not a connection lost to the api-server

**Versions (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: OSX Mojave
 - K9s: 0.12.0
 - K8s: 1.15.5

K9S is released very often. It would be nice if release contains a static symbolic link to "latest" release:

For example:

https://github.com/derailed/k9s/releases/download/latest/k9s_latest_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
would currently point or redirect, download:
https://github.com/derailed/k9s/releases/download/0.12.0/k9s_0.12.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz

Label filter on pods works fine. Trying to use the label filter command `/-l key=value` on nodes resources, it doesn't seem be working, the full list of nodes are always displayed without filter honoured.
Can we add the label filter support on nodes too? Thanks! A great tool!

**Describe the bug**
Unable to use `h` to go left when viewing long logs. It looks like it is bound to the `toggle header` and `<left>` navigation options. A quick way to reset the log viewer is to enable word wrapping and disabling it. Am I missing something to switch between `general` and `navigation` key bindings?

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to a pod instance that produces long logs
2. Click `l` to view logs within `k9s`
3. Use `l` to scroll right
4. Try to scroll left with `h` only to see it toggle the headers.

**Expected behavior**
Have a way to navigate `left` and toggle headers separately while viewing logs. Maybe `:h` for header toggle and `h` for `left` navigation.

**Screenshots**
`h` is listed under both `general` and `navigation`

I know to pronounce `K8s` as "kubernetes"

How do you pronounce `K9s`

I am curious... But also think it should be put into the README
