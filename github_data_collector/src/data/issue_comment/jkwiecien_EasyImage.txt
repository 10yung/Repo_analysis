Hi dear support, may i know to make intent data mediafile and media source into new activity. As well as how to get the intent data from previous activity to him. Third question, how to determine user pickup video from gallery. tq
When targeting Android 10 the images are not copied to the public PICTURES directory, because the destination directory is not accessible anymore.

`Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES)` is deprecated and does not return a writable folder. This results in an io exception.

I don't use fragment in android X and android.app.Fragment is depcrecated.
How to use Easy Image with fragment?
Thank you!!! 
We do not need camera permission due to the intent structure used in take picture and capture video operations. 

You can check the details on the [link](https://developer.android.com/training/camera/photobasics).

In some devices in chooser mode select camera.  ResultIntent not null  onActivityResult. 

```
   if (resultIntent != null) {
            onPickedExistingPictures(resultIntent, activity, callbacks)
            removeCameraFileAndCleanup()
        } else if (lastCameraFile != null) {
            onPictureReturnedFromCamera(activity, callbacks)
        }
```

Now the lib gives the same result if user cancels (by clicking Cancel button, back or outside the dialog) or if user clicks on Camera when no camera permission is added.
I'm using ```implementation 'com.github.jkwiecien:EasyImage:3.0.3'```

Excellent library, but i'm struggle in capturing image from camera but onActivityResult is not even called after captured. 
Facing an error while trying to build kotlin project:

More than one file was found with OS independent path 'META-INF/library_release.kotlin_module'


What was done:
1. set permissions to the Manifest file
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />

2. set implementation 'com.github.jkwiecien:EasyImage:3.0.3' to app
3. try to compile
I would like to ask, will you upgrade your library for new API where we dont have access to save our images in public storage, like it happens now, instead we have to use temporary files for saving data about captured images and write it into MediaStore?
