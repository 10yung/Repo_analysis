## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

When I update my `.chezmoi.toml.tmpl` and add a key, I run `chezmoi init` to update my config file. I then have to re-enter every configuration key, even if they are already present in the config file.

## Describe the solution you'd like

I'd like to be prompted for only the configuration keys not already present in my config file.

## Describe alternatives you've considered

A possible workaround would be to manually edit my template to only prompt for a config value if it is not already set. I would like it better if `promptString` had this built in, though.

**Describe the bug**
Having an encrypted file the chezmoi dir and modifying it locally with the intent of calling `chezmoi merge $filename` afterwards results in the crypt text being shown in the diff and not the plain version.

**To reproduce**
```
chezmoi add --encrypt file
nano file
chezmoi merge file
```

**Expected behavior**
The file should be encrypted before presenting it in the merge via (`chezmoi diff` shows decrypted version). 

**Output of command with `--verbose`**
```
$ chezmoi merge --verbose --debug .netrc
3 files to edit
2020/01/13 17:04:55 Run("/usr/bin/vimdiff /home/fbartels/.netrc /home/fbartels/.local/share/chezmoi/encrypted_private_dot_netrc /tmp/chezmoi366635937/.netrc") (2m46.753657707s)
/usr/bin/vimdiff /home/fbartels/.netrc /home/fbartels/.local/share/chezmoi/encrypted_private_dot_netrc /tmp/chezmoi366635937/.netrc
```

**Additional context**
I have not reproduced it yet, but it also seems that `chezmoi merge` ignores templated files (would store the file as it is locally discarding templated syntax).
No bug, just wanted to let you know that I love using chezmoi and appreciate you and the effort you've put into maintaining it.  Cheers!

Hi,

I am trying to install chezmoi on my Raspberry Pi and I get this message:

```sh
$ curl -sfL https://git.io/chezmoi | sh
twpayne/chezmoi crit platform linux/armv7 is not supported.  Make sure this script is up-to-date and file request at https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/new
```
[age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) is a modern alternative to `gpg` and a good candidate for encrypted file support. Maybe chezmoi should support it.
**Describe the bug**
Adding and encrypting a file with `chezmoi add --encrypt` requires two subsequent calls to `chezmoi add` for the unencrypted file to show as the source state.

**To reproduce**
````shell
printf "%s\n" test > myfile.config
chezmoi add --encrypt myfile.config
cat $(chezmoi source-path)/encrypted_myfile.config # encrypted as expected
chezmoi add myfile.config # added the same file without encryption
cat $(chezmoi source-path)/myfile.config # file still encrypted when it shoudn't
chezmoi add myfile.config
cat $(chezmoi source-path)/myfile.config # file is not encrypted anymore
````

**Expected behavior**
The file should show up unencrypted on the first call to `chezmoi add`.

**Output of command with `--verbose`**
```
$ chezmoi add --verbose myfile.config  
mv /home/wilson/.local/share/chezmoi/encrypted_myfile.config /home/wilson/.local/share/chezmoi/myfile.config
```

**Output of `chezmoi doctor`**
```

**Additional context**
There's another bug related to this issue.

Follow these steps to fall into an infinite loop:

````shell
printf "%s\n" test > myfile.config
chezmoi add --encrypt myfile.config
chezmoi add --verbose --debug myfile.config # infinite loop
````
I get the following line over and over again:

```
2019/12/27 14:04:27 Rename("/home/wilson/.local/share/chezmoi/encrypted_myfile.config", "/home/wilson/.local/share/chezmoi/myfile.config")
```

**Describe the bug**
A non-empty source file `myfile.config` gets emptied without warning when `chezmoi add -e myfile.config` executes on an empty target file.

**To reproduce**
````shell
printf "%s\n" test > "$(chezmoi source-path)/myfile.config"
touch $HOME/myfile.config
cd $HOME
chezmoi add -e myfile.config # myfile.config gets removed on source state 
cat "$(chezmoi source-path)/empty_myfile.config" # outputs nothing as expected
````

**Expected behavior**
Expected to get a warning that a non-empty `myfile.config` file existed on the source directory before removing the file.

**Output of command with `--verbose` and `--debug`**
```
$ chezmoi add -e myfile.config --verbose --debug

```

**Describe the bug**
Say `myfile.config` was already populated, added to the source directory and applied to the target state. Then user empties out `myfile.config` on the source state using `chezmoi edit`. Then `chezmoi apply` 

**To reproduce**
````shell
touch "$(chezmoi source-path)/myfile.config"
touch $HOME/myfile.config
chezmoi apply # removes myfile.config on the target state but not on the source state
ls "$(chezmoi source-path)/myfile.config" # file still exists
````

**Expected behavior**
Since the source state of `myfile.config` was empty and it does not have an `empty_` prefix, I expected `chezmoi apply` to also remove the file at the source.

Perhaps `chezmoi edit` should check if the source state is an empty file when the editor subprocess finishes and then simply show the same prompt `chezmoi rm` shows for removing files.

**Output of command with `--verbose` and `--debug`**
````shell
$ chezmoi apply --verbose --debug 
rm -rf /home/wilson/myfile.config
````

chezmoi currently uses [VSCode's Markdown All in One plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) to generate the tables of contents for documentation. However, this plugin is changing the format of the tables of contents regularly, which lead to large, unwanted diffs like 035e416cbe135696292a1079a4749d91e140384b.

chezmoi should use its own method to generate tables of contents. Related to #526.
#### Troubleshooting
- [x] I ran `chezmoi doctor` and fixed as many issues as possible and retried my command.
- [x] I have double checked the instructions for [Installation](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md) and the [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/blob/master/docs/QUICKSTART.md).
- [x] I have search for previous issues that have been reported/opened, and none of them relate to my problem.

Failure to follow the troubleshooting steps (and to report information requested below), may make it difficult to provide the proper support required. Furthermore, your issue may be closed without reply, if the instructions were not properly followed.

#### Description of issue

I added this block in my `.chezmoi.toml.tmpl`:
```
[data]
   isLinux = {{if eq .chezmoi.os “linux”}}true{{else}}false{{end}}
   isMac = {{if eq .chezmoi.os “darwin”}}true{{else}}false{{end}}
   isUnix = {{if eq .chezmoi.os “linux” }}true{{else if eq .chezmoi.os “darwin”}}true{{else}}false{{end}}
   isWindows = {{if eq .chezmoi.os “windows”}}true{{else}}false{{end}}
```

The file that got generated is this one:
```
[data]
    isLinux = false
    isMac = true
    isUnix = true
    isWindows = false
```

But trying to use those variables doesn't work, unless I write them down all in lowercase, i.e `islinux`.

A quick note is that it looks like my system (macOS Mojave, 10.14.6) has a non case-sensitive file system, which might or might not be the cause of this. But I would like to not have to change that setting because this machine is my main programming device, and I am afraid changing that setting might cause other issues. Also, all other `chezMoi` data strings are cased correctly (like `chezmoi.fullHostname`) 

**EDIT**: Looks like the same thing happens in WSL (Linux subsystem on Windows), so might not be related to the filesystem being case-sensitive.

I could also just use the `.chezmoi.os` data directly, but those data fields help me keep things more readable and avoid typos better.

Also, just wanted to say I really appreciate this software, it really helps me manage my dotfiles much better!
