Update readme
Just completely outdated, and I seem to have got the code to work in the new versions but however it starts saying missing files, and i keep redownloading so...
I am trying to build and have edited all signing areas and modified to a unique name replacing com.gabrieloc but am receiving a build failure with the following listed. 

giovanni WatchKit Extension 
Swift Compiler Error
-Switch must be exhaustive (ComplicationDataSource.swift)

and 

Command CompileSwift failed with a nonzero exitcode

any suggestions in getting these items fixed so xcode build will succeed?

I canâ€™t save the game! If I save in game and I close  and reopen the app I must restart the game
First of all, thank you so much for sharing your efforts!

I followed the tutorial, and change the build settings Skip Install to 'NO' everywhere. Everything compiles fine, no errors. But when I try to run in the simulator (as series 2 or 3) I get the same error:
<img width="537" alt="couldnotinstallapp" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9641531/39815840-4ee28266-5367-11e8-9517-abdd83a0d7e9.png">

I googled the message but have been unable to determine what the problem is (I even went through the log directories and scanned the error/system logs but still didn't find a reason for the error. I cleaned, deleted the app off the simulator, rebooted, etc. multiple times, but I still get that message. Has anyone seen and solved this issue before?

Thanks.

Can anyone help me out with this error? I don't know what to change my bundle identifier to for this to work? @gabrieloc 
Will audio output ever be implemented?

I don't know whats wrong

I am commenting because I have a lot of problems and a video about how to install easier the application.
I searched all over the internet and I didn't found a video that teach how to install, and the site Redmondpie it's not very helpful for me since my english is poor and i am a newbie on this programming world.
Can you please help.
WARNING: It's not required to do a video but I will REALLY APPRECIATE if you do that video for me. :)
