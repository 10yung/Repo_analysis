Hi there. We are trying to use EddyScan to simply draw hulls around eddies in the GOM HYCOM, from SSH. We can get the code to run just fine. Where we're running into trouble is how to visualize the hulls created by EddieScan, as the centroids are in degrees (Lon, Lat), but the other attributes of the hulls are in pixels, which we think are linked to the "area map" - however, it's not clear where the pixel IDs are, or how we could use the output in any way other than in the GUI visualizer. Any thoughts? Many thanks!
Quote from readme:
Below is an example for using scan_single.m (assuming current directory is eddyscan):
% Find all anticyclonic eddies
ssh_slice = ncread('ssh_data.nc', 'Grid_0001');
No such ssh_data.nc file found in the eddyscan directory.
Dear Sir/Madam;
I have a problem to run the script in the Persian Gulf area.
I have 3 ssh files and area map and other files specific for the area. but it returns 
###------------------------------------
Scanning SSH data for eddies
Iteration 1

ans =

    33    53

can any one help me to solve it?
I can send all of my data if needed.
Sincerely 
Dear 
I am not familiar with python.
And I want to learn about it.
Should I install Python 3/2 to run and modify the code of you which is in python?
Hi,
I'm a freshman in the field, and confused about inputs and outputs.
I have run the eddyscan.m with the CMEMS SLA data. However, in the scripts, SSH is input, so I don't know whether SLA is appropriate for the scripts. 
In the outputs, I'm confused about the units of the variables. 
In addition,  all I need is the latitude, longitude of eddy center, maximum amplitude and radius of the detected eddy. Are 'Lat', 'Lon', 'SurfaceArea' and  'Amplitude' corresponding to the latitude, longitude, radius and maximum amplitude,respectively, right?

Hello,
 I followed the instruction mentioned in “A daily global mesoscale ocean eddy dataset from satellite altimetry “, and I could run the “setup SSH data”. 
The input was “dt_global_en_phy_vxxc_l3_20070219_20170110.nc.gz” which extracted from “ftp://ftp.sltac.cls.fr/../../Core/SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L3_REP_OBSERVATIONS_008_045/dataset-duacs-rep-global-en-phy-unfiltered-l3-v3/2007/” and results were following items:
 
1.      “lon.mat” which contains 26298×1 matrix.
 2.      “lat.mat” which contains 26298×1 matrix.
 3.      “SSH-32007053.mat”
 4.      “SSH-32007030.mat”
 5.      “SSH-32007021.mat”
 6.      “Dates.mat”
 
I expected to have a 26298×26298 matrix as SSH output but I had just 26298×1 matrix. Maybe I have not used right input file. Also following errors reported:
Error using scan_single (line 25)
Error- Invalid SSH data size, should be [length(lat), length(lon)]
 
Would you please advise me how to solve this problem?
 
Best Regards
Boshra



Hello, 

My concern is if the matlab codes you are providing are prepared for SLA data or for SSH data. In the
paper it says that you used SLA data but in the codes it is written SSH everywhere. I am asking because I am getting pretty different results on the eddy polarity if I am using SLA or SSH. With SLA the most common eddy polarity in the Mediterranean, computed as (#ant - #cyc)/(#ant + #cyc), looks like a random map while with SSH it makes sense.

Thanks.
Hello,

First of all, thank you for making this tool freely available. I'm using MatLab's version to track and characterize the eddy field around Cape Verde. Everything worked fine! However, I'm getting seemingly incorrect geographical patterns for the rotational speed.

![eddies_inside_rot_speed_30days_v2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31186692/29498936-cd7120fc-85fd-11e7-85e2-1b128b3e563e.png)

I posted a similar result in a comment related with the same issue. What bothers me the most is the close to zero speed values... Is this problem related with the "tolerance_track_lnn" or the "process_eddies_and_tracks_tolerance"? Or am I doing something wrong? 

Greetings,

Hi,
It's a great work for your team to provide such an validate method to detect eddies.  Using your code, I studied statistical characters of eddies in the South China Sea. 
In order to compare results through your code and Chelton's dataset from 1993 to 2015, we limit amplitude biger than 1 cm and lifetime longer than 28 days. 
Compared with Chelton's dataset, lots of characters of this codes have validate improvements (e.g., number of eddies, frequency, polarity,  amplitude). However, mean geotrophic speed and radius are much smaller than Chelton's. This is rahter confusing. According to geostrophic equilibrium, if radius is smaller (bigger), the geotrophic speed is bigger (smaller). 
Take cyclonic eddies for example,

Would you mind explaining this phenomenon? 
I am looking forward to your reply. 
Best wishes!

Why this line is there in the prepare_eddy_data_for_viewer.m  ?
Is it required?
