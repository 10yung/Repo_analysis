could be run before using `ft_get` to then maybe just not try to get full text for publishers you don't have access to - e.g,. 

- take in a set of publishers (crossref member id, or text)
- grab a random DOI from that publisher via crossref api (maybe up to 3 cause maybe 1 at random may give a false sense of access if it happens to be 1 OA paper in a sea of non-OA content)
- try to get the full text for that DOI
- report back with access or not
Greetings, I have the following question;

I want the package to harness my institutional access when I am working from home: meaning that I need VPN connection and automatic proxy. configuration when accessing articles via the browser.

Could this be done in R in such a way that fulltext can harness these parameters?

seems hard to automate this because so many different scenarios with different IP address/permissions/etc - so could let users filter out publishers - e.g., 

JSTOR is likely not going to be availlable to most, and we have no way to sort out links anwyay, so likely may want to filter out all JSTOR DOIs
right now, when we deal with unknown publishers to our plugins for `ft_get` we use their publisher name, which can be very long and unwieldy

```r
[1] "inter-university_consortium_for_political_and_social_research_(icpsr)"
[2] "acoustical_society_of_america_(asa)"
[3] "american_society_of_clinical_oncology_(asco)"
[4] "american_society_for_microbiology"
[5] "presses_universitaires_de_rennes"
[6] "sri_lanka_journals_online_(jol)"
[7] "ieee"
```

Ideally - have a dataset within the pkg, then get Crossref member number and match against it to get a short name to use as the name for the result for that publisher
thinking through now

Hello,

Thanks for developing this fantastic package!

Has anyone thought about implementing optional EZproxy re-direction for full text? If not, I will have a go at it.

This [database of EZproxy links](https://github.com/tom5760/ezproxy-db) could be used to create GET requests.

Thanks,
Andrew
