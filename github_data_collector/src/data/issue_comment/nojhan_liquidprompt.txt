Hi, I tried to change the color of the prefix for the prompt with 

     LP_PS1_PREFIX="${RED}TL19${BLACK}" 

and with 

     LP_PS1_PREFIX="\${RED}TL19\${BLACK}"

...but neither worked. I suppose it's probably an user (me) problem; how should I fix this?

Working with themes seems to be quite complicated at the moment. Not just in liquidprompt but also in plain terminal apps, e.g. [Change color scheme for xfce4 terminal manually](https://askubuntu.com/questions/676428/change-color-scheme-for-xfce4-terminal-manually).
I would like to request a very single theme switch option for night/day theme modes.
Basically "night mode" could be (AFAIK) as the current default one (black background), and the "day mode" could a white background theme.
Why the request?
During the day it is sometimes difficult to read console output like `git status` where unstaged files are listed in dark red color. Switching to a "day mode" would basically resolve problems like this. That would be a big advantage for liquidprompt over a plain bash, where you cannot easily swap colors (as explained in linked askubuntu).
Thanks for the great software!
Hi!

I would like to have different emoticon in the prompt depending the result of the command.

```
$ true
ðŸ™‹
$ false
ðŸ˜ 
```

How to do that?

I'm just wondering if a feature to desktop notify when a process that exeeded some threshold ends exists or is in plans of being added or sth. I'm inspired on this: https://askubuntu.com/questions/409611/desktop-notification-when-long-running-commands-complete

When I have have liquidprompt enabled and ```zstyle ':completion:*' menu select=0 search``` near the top of my completion config file, I get a duplicate character being printed after I press Tab.

The top right term is after I press Ctrl-C and hit backspace twice. If I were then to press return, then the l would disappear. If I hit Ctrl-C again, it stays.

I'm using iTerm2 and when I set `LP_ENABLE_TITLE=1` but the title doesn't seem to be escaped correctly, and I see `??` at the end for every terminal. 

What would be the correct settings for `LP_TITLE_OPEN` and `LP_TITLE_CLOSE` to fix this?
