Looks like latest `npm` is unhappy...
1. either with `cheerio`'s internally used `dom-serializer`
1. or maybe it's supposed to be part of `gulp-vulcanize` which is one of your `dev-dependencies` (and also long been deprecated)?

## Steps

1. Did a fresh `git clone`
1. `cd todomvc`
1. `npm install`


## Log

Install fails with this error (copied from NPM install log file):

Hello, there is a question regarding the typescript react example. Now it's compiled with tsk and browser. There is issue with source maps because .tsx compiles to js and then bundle.js.map links to compiled js instead of raw .tsx. 

Is there any possibility to bundle it in a single file, so that  bundle.js.map will link to tsx files?
Can I add it? Is there a documentation to follow? What are the basic requirements?

node_modules folder shouldn't have been in git repository.
Partial solution/adition to #1971 with pretty simple changes:

### Description
I edited the index.css file 
```
.todo-count strong {
	font-weight: 800;
}
```

A simple to uses, deploys anywhere boilerplate to get you going in GO and GraphQL that uses todomvc around create-react-app and apollo client to query the GO GraphQL backend.

Partial solution/adition to #1977  with pretty simple changes: 

- The h1 title element sets its inner HTML with page title (in  examples/react/js/app.jsx)
- Css property font-size and top, from .todoapp h1, altered to fit its page title text ( examples/react/node_modules/todomvc-app-css/index.css).

Just need to know if it's okay to do these alterations.
Addresses #1989

Looks like the Travis build is failing for some reason, even on master.

Title says it all.. it fixes the performance issue #1732.
