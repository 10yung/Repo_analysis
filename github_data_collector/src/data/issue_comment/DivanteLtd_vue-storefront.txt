 i have defined card_category in line 14 and txt_category_name in line 15 but as u can see in lines 19 and 20 i get error when i try to use them 

thanks in advance for help
 i am still a rookie :)



During the tests of #3994 we found out, that cart sync works incorrect in terms of quantity of products:

## Steps to reproduce the issue
1. Login to user account
2. Add some product to cart
3. Logout, clear cache
4. As anonymous user, add **the same product** to the cart (color & size must match)
5. Now login to the same account again

## Current behavior
Only one item of added product is in the cart. 

## Expected behavior
Added item should be in cart with quantity set to two (one from current session and one that already was on the account)

When we try this scenario with **two diffrent products**, everything is working correctly - after step 5 (2nd logging in), user have in cart all items - the ones he added before logging in and ones added before when logged-in. But for 2 pieces of the same product - quantity is not summing.

### Short Description and Why It's Useful
<!-- describe in a few words what is this Pull Request changing and why it's useful -->
This allows to create cart token when user add product to cart. There is edge case: when user load page, go to offline, add product, go to checkout => can't make order. That's because he hasn't got payment methods which are loaded after token creation. Also I've added refresh payment methods in checkout. Right now in demo if somehow user get to checkout without loaded payment-methods then he can't make order, even if he get back online

### QA
A.
1. clear cache
2. add product to cart
3. go to checkout
4. make order
5. Expected: user made order

B.
1. clear cache
2. go offline
3. add product to cart
4. check cart - there should be product
5. go to checkout
6. you should not make order
7. turn online
8. now you can make order

Same can be checked with user logged in.

## Current behavior
Install on local and it works
Install VueStoreFront Production Setup it creates redirect loop
Server Ubuntu 18.04
Varnish => configured for multiple backends. If we dont config backends in Varnish for VueStorefront ports (api and vuestorefront) we get 502 bad gateway. 
Elasticsearch same version of tutorial
Complete tutorial and yarn start in both folders
Result => able to access myvuestore.domain/api
Redirect Loop in myvuestore.domain

## Expected behavior
Access VueStorefront without errors
## Steps to reproduce the issue

Install VueStoreFront setup in Ubuntu 18.04
Use LetsEncrypt
Apply the directive return 301 on server 8080 (we can't bind to port 80 while using varnish as it is already in use for it)
If remove directive 301 we get 403 unathorized

## Repository
Master Branch with redirect loop fix merged, but I found someone who was having same problem

No. I tried every possible NGINX/VARNISH configuration. 
We also get an error in webpack undefined for = index.minimal etc which is also described here but for docker install

## Current behavior
When accessing a page via its dispatcher-route (e.g. https://next.storefrontcloud.io/men/men-11) its scroll position when moving away and then back (Browser-Back-Button) is lost, whereas when accessing the category via https://next.storefrontcloud.io/c/men-11 the scroll position is correctly restored

## Expected behavior
Correct Scroll Position when using back button for url dispatcher routes.

## Steps to reproduce the issue
1. Goto https://next.storefrontcloud.io/men/men-11
2. Scroll down
3. Enter a product
4. Press Browser Back Button -> you are on top of the category page again.

5. Do same thing with https://next.storefrontcloud.io/c/men-11 -> you are on your previous scroll position
