I am getting this error:
Exception: Could not load type 'Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.MessagingEntityClient' from assembly 'Microsoft.ServiceBus, Version=3.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35'.

I was running the 4.1.112 release (downloaded from Github releases page). I unblocked the zip file, before unzipping and running SBE.
I also tried building the latest code from develop and it has the same issue also.

The develop branch contains code that is using the new Service Bus SDK. In the default configuration it requires the ports 5671 and 5672 for outbound traffic, which will affect some users with locked down environments. 

If using a proxy you would have to somehow make it use AmqpWebSockets, see #396.

It is also dependent on .NET 4.6.2 instead of 4.6.1.
The latest code in the developer branch is using the new SDKs for Service Bus, Relay and Event Hubs. These dlls and most likely some of their dependencies need to be included when releasing.
The Options dialog box would be more user friendly and use less screen estate if tabs were used to separate the settings on different tab pages.
Customer reported that some of their IOS device can't receive notifications. The azure notification hub product group confirmed that some devices use installation and their channel expired, so azure notification hub didn't send notification message to those devices. 

We also use the NotificationHubClient.GetInstallation(String) SDK to make double confirmation. Its returned Installation Class  contains ‘PushChannelExpired’ property and this value is also True.

But when we use the service bus explorer latest version 4.1.112 to check the "ChannelExpired"  value, it show as false.

Please help us fixing this issue.
Microsoft.Azure.NotificationHubs v2.16.0.234 has been unenlisted from NuGet. Unenlisting is not as bad as being deprecated, but still not a good thing. Information about unenlisting and deprecating NuGet packages may be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/deprecate-packages).  

We should switch to an enlisted version of Microsoft.Azure.NotificationHubs. 

The recently merged PR #381 includes changes that cause ServiceBusExplorer to use the new SDKS for ServiceBus, Relay and EventHubs. Currently the only functionality that is using the new SDKs is the purging of ServiceBus messages.

However the new functionality does not have support for setting the TransportType to [AmqpWebSockets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.transporttype?view=azure-dotnet), which is required if you are connecting to ServiceBus through a proxy. 

TransportType in the new client translates to ConnectivityMode in the old client, but there is no automatic mode in the new client which would correspond to ConnectivityMode = AutoDetect. To handle that the GUI needs to be changed. Preferably it should support configuring the proxy settings too. This is brought up in issue #343.

**The workaround for this is to just Receive and Delete the messages.**

Hi ,
I would like to know if auth with active directory is supported ( clientId/clientSecret/tenantId).

Thanks in advance for your response.
I created an IoTHub listener and everything works smoothly. But when I right click on an event and choose "Save Selected Event" context menu option, literally nothing happens and the content does not go to the clipboard!

## Affected services
