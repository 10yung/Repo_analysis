Hi @victorBaro 

This is with reference to issue: [39](https://github.com/victorBaro/VBFPopFlatButton/issues/39)

I have created the [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) bridge plugin for using this library with React Native projects.

I have added the same in README. Can you please merge this request so that if someone is looking to use this library for React Native projects can easily do the same.

Please let me know in case any changes are required.

Thanks

GitHub changed the way Markdown headings are parsed, so this change fixes it.

Hey there, thanks for sharing this awesome component Victor.

I'd like to make a suggestion or maybe it's me not using the button as I should and you can give me a hand. I'm trying to create a small button but increase it's touchable area so as it's not difficult for the user to touch it, know what I mean? I usually do this with vanilla UIButtons by adding a contentEdgeInsets, but that's not working for me with the VBFPopFlatButton. I end up having to increase the frame size which in fact it ends increasing the "icon drawing" size.

Let me know if that makes sense. Thanks!

Agus Guerra. 

... so that "+" button can be green and "X" button can be red... ;-)
- Add "setCircleColor:forButtonType:" method
- Add "setLineColor:forButtonType:" method

I have noticed a rendering Bug in my project and I could verify it in your example project using the following setup :

```
-(void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
    self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];

[...]
    self.flatPlainButton = [[VBFPopFlatButton alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(200, 100, 22, 22)
                                                       buttonType:buttonMenuType
                                                      buttonStyle:buttonPlainStyle
                                            animateToInitialState:NO];
    self.flatPlainButton.lineThickness = 2.0;
    self.flatPlainButton.tintColor = [UIColor darkGrayColor];
    [self.flatPlainButton addTarget:self
                             action:@selector(flatPlainButtonPressed)
                   forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
    [self.view addSubview:self.flatPlainButton];
}
```

This adds another button type called buttonMenuChatType that shows a small rounded bubble on the menu button denoting there are action items hidden by the menu.

to have a bigger button touch area than the drawing size of segment lines. 
Also added NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER to force warnings when not using given init
