Is there a way to remove/uninstall removed formulas from brew using CakeBrew?

I recently encountered this error: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/48553#issuecomment-571253725

Can CakeBrew notify users about removed formulas?
please add a date column this way can see what are the latest releases eg, either can sort or have drop down 'updated/release' last 30, 60, 90 days etc
brew does show newly added but unable to see entire list because it scroll past the window of the  terminal
Here is **full** Italian localization.

Giving an option for removing unused dependencies is very desirable~
There is a square in the formula popover view

It would be awesome for Cakebrew to comply with the user's preferences for Mojave's dark mode or enable it on an in-app basis.
I would like to localize Cakebrew into Turkish.
Would be nice to see formulas which are installable or have been installed via cask

like `brew cask list`

cheers

There is a small spelling error discovered within french localization, see PR https://github.com/brunophilipe/Cakebrew/pull/208.
