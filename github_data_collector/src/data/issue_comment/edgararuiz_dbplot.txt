Cordial saludo, de forma atenta me comunico porque estoy estudiando temas de big data con R studio+Spark y presento problemas para instalar el paquete "dbplot", es posible puedas ayudarme con este error. Por su amable atenciÃ³n y pronta respuesta, gracias 
It is not possible to add a legend to a boxplot with dbplot.

How can I use this after a call to make a JDBC connection with `DBI::dbConnect()`? I would love to have an example vignette that I can follow. Thanks! 
Thanks for the work on this project.
I've noticed that the calculation of the histogram bins is done using rlang and sparlyr/dbplyr verbs.

Have you considered using the histogram_numeric function from hive? 
- https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/StatisticsAndDataMining

For some reasons, summarise(histrogram_numeric(column_name, nbins)) doesn't work. However it should be possible to encode this as a SQL statement directly.
Thank you very much for developing this package, it looks very interesting.

I can reproduce the examples in the documentation, however when I try the function on real data I get the following spark error:

Error: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job 1 cancelled because SparkContext was shut down

The table I am trying to plot is quite big - but even after trying head %>% compute or head %>% coalesce, the error remain.

Do you have any suggestion on how to debug this, or which parameters could be adjusted?

Thanks
@edgararuiz I very much enjoyed your webinar on "Best practices for working with databases". Using SQL server isn't that convenient for many of our students, however, so I wanted to adapt your databases-and-R.Rmd file to work with SQLite.

Unfortunately lots of errors popped up with dbplot and, for example, the sampling example. I just wanted to check with you if that is expected. I know that SQLite is more limited as a database so perhaps this is expected.

```r
db_flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(arrdelay)) %>%
  dbplot_histogram(arrdelay)
```

```r

Great package! :)

It would be nice to be able to facet plots computed in the database, e.g. via `facet_wrap()` or on a grouped table. Or is there a straightforward approach already that I am missing?
In the "Calculation functions" section you show a histogram with a scale on the left and a color legend on the right.  This color legend is not needed and is not conventional with histograms (IMHO).  The color legend doesn't add any information that's not in the scale at the left.

But how can I change the bars in the histogram to some constant color?  Why doesn't something like fill="red" work?
