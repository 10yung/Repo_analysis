This PR is not a complete version.If my implementation of `AFGenericLocalCounter` is acceptable, I will continue to improvement a `AFGenericLocalHistogram` and some macro.The final target is to make local metrics have a same interface with the global ones.
Being able to set a counter is useful when a counter is set at scrape time, for example to the sum of other counters.

Prometheus doesn't have any issues with Counters getting reset.
Wherever possible, use the default linking style of looking names up in the
enclosing namespace without adding an explicit link, but sometimes we need to
add the link target via parens, in those cases correct from `::Name` to
`crate::Name`.

Thanks for the library! Would it be possible to get a new release soon? In particular it would be nice to get #275 in a version on crates.io so that macro imports work properly in Rust 2018.
This needs to wait for the final release of reqwest 0.10, but wanted to get a PR out that handles the necessary API changes.
This adds an example that uses warp for serving the metric data. It's based on the hyper example.
Currently still waiting for this PR https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp/pull/336.

for https://github.com/tikv/rust-prometheus/issues/282 and https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/5705, try to use Cow<'static, str> to improve the memory usage.

`make all` passed. 
Open the PR.
Still have problem to be solved.
See the FIXME part in code

Hi!

The data I'd like to put into `Histogram` comes in aggregated form. This includes bucket bounds, counts, sum and total count. I do not have individual observations, and cannot use `observe` unfortunately.

Is is possible to create a new (or maybe reset existing) `Histogram` metric with already aggregated data?
