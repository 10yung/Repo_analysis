In the Attention notebook, when you are adding the node SoftSequentialAttentionLayer, does it return the final attention vector created using the input 1 and input 2? However it says TODO in the output in SoftSequentialAttentionLayer?

It would be nice to add to the README file a link to the online nbviewer for each notebook .
