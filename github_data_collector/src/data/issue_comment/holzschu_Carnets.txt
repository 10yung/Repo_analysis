Is there an undo? If not, it would be a useful editing addition.
What are the steps to install and enable an nbextension (e.g., code prettify)? I tried !jupyter nbextension but that gave command nbextension not found.
Is Carnets able to access the microphone to record audio (and play it back) and the camera for photos and video? If so, are there examples?
Once opening a notebook in preview mode, can't return to the notebook view.
I installed your wonderful app last week and discovered when I issue path commands from a notebook I get another user’s iCloud path:

In[1]: pwd
Out[1]:
'/private/var/mobile/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~AsheKube~Carnets/Documents/welcome'

What is going on? The notebook is still being saved to my iCloud account. Is there a security issue here?
This is more a question than an issue. I was wondering if it is feasible for Carnets to implement Jupyeterlab (as opposed to Jupyter) and if so, what additional capabilities would result? This is not a request as there are undoubtedly many more important enhancements that people would like to see but Jupyterlab with its extensibility seems to be the new “standard”.
Support the IOS share sheet so that cell content could be sent to other apps and vice versa (i.e., also accept input from other apps to be added as cell content). This would make interoperating with editors and apps like Pythonista more seamless than cut/paste.
How does one access the on screen keyboard to use shortcuts (e.g., selecting multiple cells) when in command mode? 
Could you add Scipy to the app? I cannot get the installation to function.
