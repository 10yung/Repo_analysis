Hi,

I'm experiencing some strange issue with my Nsynth build. I already spent hours to troubleshoot, but couldn't source the problem. I am very desperate. 

Everything seems to be working fine except:
- the OLED screen doesn't work (remains totally black) 
- there is no sound at all
- since there is no sound, I don't know if midi signals get processed or not.

I already checked for any soldering bridges and checked for the right polarity of all components.
Even though I'm quite confident in my soldering skills, out of pure desperation I decided to build a second unit with a second set of components (including a new screen). As for the second unit, I followed [this advice](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/open-nsynth-super/issues/27#issuecomment-388999063) and left a tiny gap between the 2 PCB to avoid any solder bridges. To my surprise, the finished build shows **EXACTLY** the same issue as the first one.....

- I used Elecrow to produce the PCB according to the build instructions.
- I sourced and soldered all components myself (including SMD)
- I have a raspberry B+ with the 64gb image.
- I also tried it with a raspberry B, but still the same problem.
- Nsynth starts up normally. I logged in and successfully flashed the board.
- When I connect the Nsynth to a monitor via HDMI, the mini-screen appears on the upper left corner. I can see on the monitor that the encoders, the pots and the touch panel work completely fine.
- All pins on the OLED PCB have voltage. So unlike [this user](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/open-nsynth-super/issues/27#issuecomment-392628556), it doesn't seem that bad solder joint are the cause of the problem.
- I bridged both the SJ1 and SJ2 on the OLED PCB.
- Running i2cdetect -y 1 shows MCU at 0x47, the display at 0x3d and a device at 0x4c.


Please help... :/
Hi, 

I have a PI 3B and it seemed to be the default option a while ago. But today when I tried the latest image onss_1.2.0_full - it appeared to be non-functional on my Pi.
What is the image compatible with PI 3B and how can I download it? 
Or is the only option now to switch to PI 3B+?

Thanks!
Hello!
I just finished my build, using the original PCB layout. As I did not get the encoders without momentary switch, I use encoders with switch. but I did not cut off the unnecessary legs, I just bent them upwards so they are lying on top of the PCB.
If I read the current version of the schematics correctly, the switches for using the "new" feature to store patches are connected between ground and GPIO pins. So would it be possible to use some thin wire to connect one pin of each encoder to ground and the other one to the correct GPIO pin, or are there other changes to the schematics to make this feature work?

Hello!
I got an SMT presoldered PCB from ebay really cheap and just finished building my NSynth Super :) It is working, all pots and encoders functioning correctly. The only issue I have so far is that the contents on the OLED display seem to be too far left - just one pixel I think - so the first column is cut off. Perhaps the OLED is buggy, but as it is quite expensive and I don´t want to order a new one, is there a way to change the position of the displays´ contents, so I could move everything just this one pixel to the right?

Hello, 

I just finished an 3d print enclosure for the nsynth.
It worked quiet well, without support and Ethernet still accessible.

I am currently unable to run  
`bazel build //magenta/tools/pip:build_pip_package`

I am receiving the error 
```
ERROR: /magenta/WORKSPACE:1:1: name 'new_http_archive' is not defined

It may be that http_archive is unsupported in the current version of bazel 28.1.
Maybe some documentation on which version of bazel was used would be helpful.
Hi , 

Just got my unit. 
All controls runs fine. But no sound at jack.
Is there any command line to test the sound ?

Thank you.

the `05_clean_files.py` script converts from wav to mp3, and then back to wav again. what's the purpose of this?
Ubuntu 18.04
Python 2.7.16
magenta-gpu 1.1.2
tensorflow-gpu 1.14.0

i ran `01_compute_input_embeddings.py`, `02_compute_new_embeddings.py` and `03_batch_embeddings.py` successfully.

however the data now has a different shape than `nsynth_generate` seems to expect:

```

```

checking one of the .npy files, i see it has shape `(1, 125, 16)`, resulting from this reshape in `02_compute_new_embeddings.py`:

```
#	reshape array
interpolated = np.reshape(interpolated, (1,) + interpolated.shape)
```

if i comment out this line, `nsynth_generate` starts to run. no idea whether this makes sense though… surely there is a reason for the reshape?

any advice would be appreciated.
