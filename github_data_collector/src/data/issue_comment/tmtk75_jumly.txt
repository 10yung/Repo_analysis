hi All,

I am trying to render Jumly sequence diagram in my Primefaces application(.xhtml page) , I could see diagram is perfectly render when we try to display in HTML but this provide error when i try to display at .xhtml page..

So my question is : Is it possible to render sequence diagram in .xhtml as it doesn't load 

sequence instruction in variable e and hence it is undefined and that's why it provide the above exception

here is code .xhtml code

Hi there

I like the tool that you've developed. However, I was wondering if it's possible to customise the grammar use such that it more closely mirrors something like https://www.websequencediagrams.com/. If this is possible, where can I make this customisation?

Thanks
Ash

Let's say I wanted specific order of lifelines.
For now, I'm using these dummies `@found` statements to set it up

```
@found "1"
@found "2"
@found "3", ->
 @message "prepare", "2"
@found "1", ->
 @message "use", "2"
```

Of course there are display artefacts because of that...
It would be really cool if order could be set up without artefacts.

When I run Jumly, Chrome developer tools tell me that:

> 'SVGElement.offsetHeight' is deprecated and will be removed in M50, around April 2016. See https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5724912467574784 for more details.

This works fine:

```
@found "blah", ->
    @message "example", "baz"
```

But this longer message text is displayed badly -- browser tries to break it into lines, overlaying the arrow:

```
@found "blah", ->
    @message """example_call("foo", "foobar", "foobarbaz")""", "baz"
```

> I have a question! Is there any way to execute(or init) jumly dynamically? I need to import jumly lib asynchronously. I've tried $('<script/>').attr('src', 'http://jumly.tmtk.net/public/j... kind of thing but it doesn't be executed well.

There seems to be an issue with this type of code :

``` html
    <div class="diagram_panel">
      <script type='text/jumly+sequence'>
        @found "You", ->
          @message "get", "JUMLY"
      </script>
    </div>
```

``` css
.diagram_panel {
   display: none;
}
```

When I do a `JUMLY.scan()` with this code, I obtain this result :

![capture d ecran 2015-11-19 a 10 06 29](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6572765/11266589/ddce74be-8ea5-11e5-82c0-c13cb4286b75.png)

It works well when the `diagram_panel` is `display: block;`, but this is not my intended behavior.

The top of context of JUMLY DSL is a jQuery object wrapping the diagram DOM node. So you can fix whatever you want after building the DOM like this. Take a look at last two lines.

```
@found "You", ->
  @alt
    "[found]": ->
      @loop ->
        @message "request", "HTTP Server"
    "[missing]": ->
      @message "new", "HTTP Server"

@find(".fragment > .header > .name:eq(0)").text("this was alt")
@find(".fragment > .header > .name:eq(1)").text("this was Loop")
```

You can try this on http://jumly.tmtk.net/try.html pasting above code :star: 

This issue depends on phantomjs, https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs

To reproduce this issue, please follow next instruction on the branch, https://github.com/tmtk75/jumly/commit/7a8ff635afd8fa44336020c0b3d43f7846cf964a

```
$  npm install
$ ./node_modules/phantomjs2/bin/phantomjs a.js
```

Open a generated `a.png` with your browser. You'll see as follow.
