Travis-CI Configuration

Features
- Adds build pass/failure indication to README.md
- Allows for easy addition of merge rules based on build status.
- Enables mindlessly simple releases - just tag a commit and push it.

Requirements - These changes require the repository owner to perform some setup.
- link the project to [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
- [generate an oauth token](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2013-01-28-token-token-token) for GitHub Releases. (`gem install travis && travis login && travis token` Make sure the token is encrypted)
- update build status url in README.md to point to correct travis job.
Hi,
Regarding the new terms and conditions which state:
> Weâ€™ve updated our User Guidelines, making it clear that all types of ad blockers, bots, and fraudulent streaming activities are not permitted;

Since Spotifree doesn't block, it simply mutes, do we - Spotifree users - need to be concerned about our accounts?
I love Spotifree as much as my playlists ðŸ˜„

Thanks!

Hi There!
There is a problem in some ads more than 3 mins lenght.
spotify doesnt run any song and stuck in starting ads.
and when spotifree is not open there is not problem like that.
thanks for your amazing application ðŸ˜ƒ

I would love to add some other languages. I can personally contribute to Spanish and Vietnamese, and I have seen some typos in the French language. An easy PR to start.
Current release is approaching 3rd birthday, with 30+ commits since.
Would love to take advantage of some of the new features - any timeline on pushing a new release?
Or is there some reference on how to build this from sources?
Podcasts are being muted by Spotifree, presumably because they have a track number equal to 0. But I would guess there's also an easy way to check the audio type to make sure it's not a podcast before muting it. Or maybe there's an episode number field? Tried skimming through the [API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) but not sure where to look. ~Maybe the "type" key in the [Track](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-track/)?~

Have to be playing / on a song already and then switch to a podcast.

Looking at the Spotify URI for a podcast it looks like it's not treated the same as a track 

podcast:

    spotify:episode:<id>

versus a track:

    spotify:track:<id>

But the web API doesn't seem to have endpoints for episodes. Based on [this Github issue ](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/issues/551) it looks like this functionality may not be supported yet. Although I don't know if that should prevent Spotifree from handling podcast episodes properly.
New release of Spotify. When ad plays, Spotifree mutes as expected, but ad then never finishes not does the music continue.
Saw in my console a large amount of logging output.

```log
AppleEvents: received mach msg which wasn't complex type as expected in getMemoryReference.
```

Perhaps a simple fix? I had to quit so I could read other outputs to find a different problem I have.
It would be nice if the user could provide an MP3 to play in the background while Spotify is muted.
Apparently you can skip ads now, maybe add an option to skip instead of muting?
