Hello,
I am creating the styleguide and I have many similar css classes for color. I don't want to type a lot of similar text in the the example block.
is there a way to create a loop in the markdown? 
Adding a reference to the Ruby Hologram Webpack Plugin.
Is it possible? I dug around and it appears that this can only be done with html

This ensures the text inside of the `pre` section of the gh page is wrapped around. See the result:

Compared to previous:

I wasn't sure if I should `overflow-x: auto` or wrap line, but figured wrapping was a bit cleaner - overflowing didn't make it obvious that text was available past the scroll point. Also wasn't sure if I should be updating both styles.sass and styles.css or if there's a compile SASS > CSS step somewhere, so I covered both.

For the main nav there is currently no way to set their order/priority. If they were classed with their name this could be one method to accomplish it. 

For sub sections we currently have to prefix their name with an index (number or letter) to force the order we want. This gets messy when we need to move sections around or add new ones into the order, having to update the naming for all the others. 

[Note: by primary menu I don't mean the top level nav - I mean the top level menu for the sections in the content. It renders as an unclassed ul without any sub ul hierarchy. ]

I end up doing display: none; on the primary menu, as it contains no hierarchy within the lists - all sections and sub-sections are at the same first level. There are no classes generated to differentiate as well (unlike .section-nav). As a result all of the top level sections below the fold are unknown without a proper primary menu. 

Multiple members of my team were distracted by this emoticon, which is backwards from the traditional version (in this country anyway), :) — somehow it always looks like a :( frown as it slides by on the console.

Also took the opportunity to add "Hologram", since in our situation where you're scanning a lot of build output, it's helpful to be specific about what just finished.
- Remove distracting backwards emoticon
- Add “Hologram”, which is helpful messaging in a multiple-build situation

gem install hologram stopped working for me, when run with a -V flag the output just stops.

I noticed there was an update to rouge dated 14th June, when I specify version 1.10.1 things progress as normal. haven't tried 1.11.0 or 1.11.1. But I thought I should give you the heads up.
