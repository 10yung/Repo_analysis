The same code, drag and drop to the normal operation of the project, the use of cocoapods integration problems!
there are 4 view controllers in one navigation stack . i only want the animation worked in 2 and 3. how to do this 

Tab bar swipe animation stopped working 
if tabBar.selectedIdex = n is called. (n index of tab)
If I removed this line then all animation will work good again.
tabBar.selectedIdex = n is called in a callback method. (didUpdateLocations)

i.e.

Otherwise when using these in isolation you get a compile error.

table image view improved a bit.

CEHorizontalSwipeInteractionController method's 
wireToViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController forOperation:(CEInteractionOperation)operation

has popOnRightToLeft = YES within method. So, whatever I change back to YES. So, I need to change the initial code. I think it be better we remove this line.

Thanks

Hey Colin,

Big fan of the library! I encountered a small issue - when I present a new NavigationController with a ViewController as its root as such:
   UINavigationController *n = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRoot:someVC];
and then manually wire up the VC's interactionController in its viewDidLoad, the interaction is off: I will start a horizontal slide, and the view seems to slide to the right twice as fast, and on release often bounces back again. When I do the gesture a second time it works fine. Any suggestions what might cause this behaviour? Thanks!

Nothing exploding at all! Looks like an iOS8 issue

In landscape the pan animation still only moves the portrait width of the screen. I'm using it to pan between viewcontrollers in a UITabBarController.

I am using Fold animation but all the text and images in my view controller gets blurry.
