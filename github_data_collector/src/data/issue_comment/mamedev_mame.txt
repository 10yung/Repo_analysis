With the latest release, the protected sets of Alligator Hunt are showing some odd behavior:

1.  The ships flying in during the intro are delayed, giving it an odd 'missing sprites' feel.
2.  When the lizard appears, the left side appears first, the second side a second later, followed by the head a second after that.
3.  At the title screen, the scrolling effect on Alligator takes several seconds to appear.  The game goes to demo mode before 'hunt' can even be shown.
4.  During the demo, player is shown shooting at empty air, with sprites appearing about 3 seconds after the demo has started.

In short, it seems like the sprites in the intro are running half the normal rate, while other graphics are running normally.

Back checking, .215 the protected sets are normal and match the unprotected sets.  In .216 and .217, the lagging appeared.

Adding config.set_perfect_quantum("gaelco_ds5002fp:mcu"); right after line 1221 in gaelco2.c corrects the protected set's behavior.  That is, assuming this is a timing issue similar to slow gameplay in TH Strikes Back and not just covering up something else.

We are trying to build Mame on Window with VS2017. It failed to run  "make vs2017" due to error "make: 3rdparty/genie/bin/windows/genie.exe: Command not found". Could you please help to take a look?

According to the log file, genie.exe is generated at "3rdparty\genie\bin\windows\genie.exe". But we found the genie.exe is actually generated under path "3rdparty\bx\tools\bin\windows\genie.exe". 

**Repro steps:**
1. git clone https://github.com/mamedev/mame F:\gitP\mamedev\mame
2. Put msys2 under F:\gitP\mamedev\tools
3. set PATH=F:\gitP\mamedev\tools\msys64\usr\bin;F:\gitP\mamedev\tools\msys64\mingw64\bin;%PATH%
4. make vs2017

This started to happen after the TGP updates in 0.217GIT (tested in both 0.216 and recent GIT versions to verify vformula doesn't crash in 0.216). The crash happens during the second attract loop right before the "pit in" sequence. This is what the crash message said:

This does not happen in vr as I tested that game in both versions.
