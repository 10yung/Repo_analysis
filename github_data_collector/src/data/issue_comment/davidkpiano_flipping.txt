Hi, 

Great work but can't seem to get this working in Firefox OSX, get the above error in the console.

Works fine on Chrome / others.


Hi,
I'm working in a TypeScript project with webpack.

I stumbled across this post [[https://css-tricks.com/animating-layouts-with-the-flip-technique/](https://css-tricks.com/animating-layouts-with-the-flip-technique/)] and decided to try your library. In your example, you use this import syntax:

```typescript
import Flipping from 'flipping/adapters/web';
```

Unfortunately, this doesn't work (I'm using the latest version, 1.1.0). The only way I found for importing the Web Adapter is this, which feels unnatural:

```typescript
import Flipping from 'flipping/lib/adapters/web';
```

This works, but the editor complains about that file not having a default export.

I think that with some minor changes to your project structure/configuration we should be able to use the syntax you used in that article, let me know if I'm doing something wrong :) Cheers!

Still, a good recommendation on which to use would be great.
And how far the css one is.
