Can you update the release version for SPM?

With Cocoapods version 1.8.3, try to update or install pod was sending this error messages: 

```
- `Timepiece-library` does not specify a Swift version and none of the targets (`Pods`) integrating it have the `SWIFT_VERSION` attribute set. Please contact the author or set the `SWIFT_VERSION` attribute in at least one of the targets that integrate this pod.
```

after some investigation, there was a small typo in the podspect. Fixed the typo there is no error anymore
Hello,
I've recently had to reinstall pods in my project and I am getting this error in CocoaPods:

`Timepiece-library` does not specify a Swift version and none of the targets (`Pods`) integrating 
it have the `SWIFT_VERSION` attribute set.
Please contact the author or set the `SWIFT_VERSION` attribute in at least one 
of the targets that integrate this pod.
Is it possible to fix? thank you very much

Added a feature to get the number of days in a specific month.

Let me know if something should be rearranged, or changed in any way.
I'm dim.  I'm not 100% sure how to use this library to do something like  (I'm shortcutting the syntax)

let christmas = Date(year: today().year, month:12, day:25)
let daysUntilChristmas = christmas - today ?????  //give us some examples please
the first screenshot is the dates being handled by iOS 11. The second screenshot is the dates being handles by iOS 10.


First, there is a row where the exact timestamps pulled from parse are printed, then a row showing what happens to the timestamps after .endOfDay is called and then I try to calculate the number of days between the two dates.

`        
        
         if let start = self.transaction.pickupDate{

            if let end = self.transaction.returnDate{

                print("start date: \(start),  end date: \(end)")

                let days = abs(end.endOfDay.daysFrom(start.endOfDay))

                print("Start Date: \(start.endOfDay), End Date: \(end.endOfDay),  number of days: \(days)")

            }

        }
`

You can see clearly that endOfDay is doing something really weird in iOS 11

endOfDay might be from an older version of Timepiece that I have.  But basically, it does the following: return change(hour: 23, minute: 59, second: 59)
```swift
// shortcut for date1.timeIntervalSince(date2)
date1 - date2
```
