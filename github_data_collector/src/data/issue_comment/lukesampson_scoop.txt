I'm using Windows 10, and I've followed the instructions to install scoop and other prerequisites by opening powershell (with admin rights):

~~~~
set-executionpolicy remotesigned -s CurrentUser
iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex
scoop bucket add extras
~~~~

Then I try to install ios-webkit-debug-proxy, using the following command:
`scoop install ios-webkit-debug-proxy`

However, that throws an error. Here's the output (I've replaced my username with "currentuser"):

~~~~

Note that I executed all those commands with full admin rights.

ALSO NOTE - i've already created an issue with the ios-webkit-debug-proxy project, but they said that the issue is with Scoop!
I have the following (nonsensical) autoupdate snippet:
```
"url": "https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/releases/download/v$version/pomerium-windows-amd64#/pomerium.exe",
"hash": {
    "url": "$basename.sha256",
    "find": "^([a-fA-F0-9]{32,128}).*$basename$"
}
```

which, the way i read [the docs](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/wiki/App-Manifest-Autoupdate#url-variables), scoop should check for hashes in the file `pomerium-windows-amd64.sha256`.

Instead, what it does is this:
```
.\bin\checkver.ps1 -f pomerium
pomerium: 0.5.2 (scoop version is 0.5.2)
Forcing autoupdate!
Autoupdating pomerium
Searching hash for pomerium.exe in pomerium.exe.sha256
```

[Here](https://github.com/MCOfficer/scoop-bucket/blob/master/bucket/pomerium.json)'s the actual manifest to play around with.
I followed the [guide for switching java versions](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/wiki/Java#switching-javas) but it somehow seems to not work in my case.

I have both `openjdk11` and `openjdk13` installed from the `java` bucket:

```bash
$ scoop info openjdk11
Name: openjdk11
Description: Official production-ready open-source builds of OpenJDK 11
Version: 11.0.2-9
Website: https://jdk.java.net/11
License: GPL-2.0-only WITH Classpath-exception-2.0 (https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only WITH Classpath-exception-2.0.html)
Manifest:
  C:\Users\marcin\scoop\buckets\java\bucket\openjdk11.json
Installed:
  C:\Users\marcin\scoop\apps\openjdk11\11.0.2-9
Environment:
  JAVA_HOME=C:\Users\marcin\scoop\apps\openjdk11\current
  PATH=%PATH%;C:\Users\marcin\scoop\apps\openjdk11\11.0.2-9\bin
```
```bash
$ scoop info openjdk13
Name: openjdk13
Description: Official production-ready open-source builds of OpenJDK 13
Version: 13.0.2-8
Website: https://jdk.java.net/13
License: GPL-2.0-only WITH Classpath-exception-2.0 (https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only WITH Classpath-exception-2.0.html)
Manifest:
  C:\Users\marcin\scoop\buckets\java\bucket\openjdk13.json
Installed:
  C:\Users\marcin\scoop\apps\openjdk13\13.0.2-8
Environment:
  JAVA_HOME=C:\Users\marcin\scoop\apps\openjdk11\current
  PATH=%PATH%;C:\Users\marcin\scoop\apps\openjdk13\13.0.2-8\bin
```

The current `java` is `openjdk11` in my case

```bash
$ scoop which java
C:\Users\marcin\scoop\apps\openjdk11\current\bin\java.exe
```

Now I want to switch to `openjdk13` by using `scoop reset` command (as mentioned in the [guide](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/wiki/Java#switching-javas))
```bash
$ scoop reset openjdk13
Resetting openjdk13 (13.0.2-8).
Linking ~\scoop\apps\openjdk13\current => ~\scoop\apps\openjdk13\13.0.2-8
```

The command ends with success. However, the `java` version is not switched. It is still locked at `openjdk11`:

```shell
$ scoop which java
C:\Users\marcin\scoop\apps\openjdk11\current\bin\java.exe
```

A quick investigation revealed two `java` executables on the `%PATH%`

$ where java
```shell
C:\Users\marcin\scoop\apps\openjdk11\current\bin\java.exe
C:\Users\marcin\scoop\apps\openjdk13\current\bin\java.exe
```

So the shell will always take the first one available, `openjdk11` in my case.

Is the the `scoop reset` command broken ATM? Or, maybe I misunderstood the `scoop reset` command?

My `scoop` version is

```shell
$ scoop -v

tldr: title

I use a lot of buckets. It becomes tedious  that every time I use scoop to install software, it automatically starts to update buckets. Which takes quite a few minutes. So is there an option to set it off? I looked at the wiki and couldn't find it. Thank you.

I have seen several comments regarding scoop and "The system cannot find the path specified". This happened to me as well. When I debugged to the bottom of it, it was nothing scoop related actually. Whenever, I launched a cmd window, I was receiving this error. When scoop was trying to execute the     

& "$env:COMSPEC" /c $cmd 

for the git pull command, this error was messing up the output and making it look like the repo was not valid and then scoop failing.

In the documentation (help cmd) it pointed me to these two entries
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun
        and/or
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun
I had an invalid program reference to anaconda3 still in the second one. Deleting this solved my problem. 

However, I think by adding the extra command line switch /d 
& "$env:COMSPEC" /d /c $cmd
this will solve other peoples problems by removing side effects from executing autostart programs.
Here are the steps to reproduce:

I'm running latest version of scoop:

```
Current Scoop version:
a9fa775d (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) chore(buckets.json): Update scoop-nonportable URL (#3776)
```

When I run `scoop status` shows I have IntelliJ-IDEA v 2019.3-193.5233.102 installed.

But when I open IntelliJ it tells me there's an update.

So I run `scoop update *` and scoop reports:

```
IntelliJ-IDEA: 2019.3-193.5233.102 (latest version)
Latest versions for all apps are installed! For more information try 'scoop status'
```

So, based on the workaround mentioned in #3644, I run `scoop update -f IntelliJ-IDEA`. Scoop dutifully updates IntelliJ to version 2019.3.1-193.5662.53.

But I don't want the old version on my machine, so I run a cleanup `scoop cleanup *`, only to watch scoop uninstall the new version that it just installed!

```
Removing IntelliJ-IDEA: 2019.3.1-193.5662.53
Everything is shiny now!
```

No, scoop, everything is _not_ shiny now.

So my question is, why is scoop not registering the new version as new? I thought that was supposed to be fixed with #3644? And until that is fixed should I just never run cleanup?

Thanks!
As soon as manifest specify hash extraction, and hash is found, URL is not checked. This lead to possible problem when hash was extracted correctly, but installation failed since developers changed URL.

This line need to test HTTP Status and then return hash. Cannot think right now how to test remote file existence and do not download full file. It should be possibe to download few bytes and see status
Dear all

I have got the result as below when using `scoop status`

```
These app manifests have been removed:
    heroku-cli
```

I have tried both `scoop update` and `scoop update heroku-cli` but scoop status still show the same result

> `scoop update heroku-cli` results `heroku-cli: nightly-20190321 (latest version)`

Please guide how can I fix this issue

Thanks

P.S. the `scoop  --version` results
