Was using "employees" instead of "employee"

Code was broken and example had no logic at all
I think you broke a rule within the example of another.

In **Don't add unneeded context** you say that this is bad

```
public class Car
{
    public string CarMake { get; set; }
    public string CarModel { get; set; }
    public string CarColor { get; set; }

    //...
}
```

But then you do it in **Use searchable names (part 2)**

```
public enum PersonAccess : int
{
    ACCESS_READ = 1,
    ACCESS_CREATE = 2,
    ACCESS_UPDATE = 4,
    ACCESS_DELETE = 8
}
```

So it actually should look like this IMO

```
public enum PersonAccess : int
{
    Read = 1,
    Create = 2,
    Update = 4,
    Delete = 8
}
```

 To highlight that this function will return something.
hello, I have translated your content into Chinese, please accept my pr.
The `ShapeBase` actually should be `RectangleBase`
In the `Square` class, better to set the `Width` and `Height` properties as both are protected properties inherited from `RectangleBase`. 
In the section "Make objects have private/protected members", the parameter type is missing for parameter "name" and the "Name" property is mistyped as "GetName()"
