T1519 emond says it needs a test but you have one in https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1165/T1165.md

just letting you know :-)
**Details:**
After the latest change to these tests, they are now failing with the following error:

```
New-ItemProperty : Cannot convert value "C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe" to type "System.UInt32". Error: "Input string
was not in a correct format."
At line:7 char:9
+         New-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $name -Value $Valu ...
+         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : WriteError: (HKEY_LOCAL_MACH...Options\osk.exe:String) [New-ItemProperty], PSInvalidCast
   Exception
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.Management.Automation.PSInvalidCastException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.NewIte
   mPropertyCommand
```

This is due to incorrect reg value type DWORD being used where it should be STRING.

**Testing:**
Tested with new STRING type value and the appropriate reg keys were being created.

i follow this `https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1193/T1193.md#atomic-test-2---word-spawned-a-command-shell-and-used-an-ip-address-in-the-command-line`

when I run this in powershell,and didn't exec any VBScript 
```
Start-Process $PathToAtomicsFolder\T1193\bin\PowerShell_IP_Doc.doc
```
then I start to find VBScript in doc,and nothing found

**Details:**
'/domain' parameter fixed.
I think it would be very good for a lot of users of this framework to have releases. For example, we (Security Research Team of Splunk) are using the Atomic Red Team Framework in our Attack Range (https://github.com/splunk/attack_range). If something is broken on the master branch, it will be automatically also be broken in other projects using the Atomic Red Team framework.
If there would be releases, we (and other users) could always pull the latest stable release.

## What did you do?
Powershell:
Import-Module c:\AtomicRedTeam\atomic-red-team-master\execution-frameworks\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.psm1

Invoke-AtomicTest "T1003" -Force -PathToAtomicsFolder C:\AtomicRedTeam\atomic-red-team-master\atomics -Confirm:$false

## What did you expect to happen?
I expected that T1003 can be successfully executed as before the latest change to the file.

## What happened instead?
ðŸ’¥
The new added atomic test #13 throws a lot of errors.

## Your Environment
Windows Server 2016

Our project https://github.com/splunk/attack_range use Atomic Red Team to execute attack simulations. Everything was working fine until the latest change to T1003 (adding of the new Atomic Test #13).

## What did you do?

â„¹ Please replace this with what you  did.
Ran Invoke-AtomicTest T1085
## What did you expect to happen?

The atomic test executes the first case and `notepad.exe` is launched. And the rest of the test cases should continue to run after the first test case is executed

## What happened instead?

The execution was stuck at the first test case and no progress to another test cases. T1085 has a total of 6 test cases.

## Your Environment

* Which *specific* operating system are you running (e.g. Windows 7 SP1 32-bit)?
* Did you run the test from an elevated or root prompt?
* If relevant, which atomic test is this specific to?
* If relevant, which [execution harness](2) are you attempting to use?

**Details:**
Moved C-source for test 1 to /src directory, automated test 1, added a number of other minor corrections including clean-up commands for all 3 tests

**Testing:**
Did not test, made simple changes to code

I tested it in intranet  enviroment and replace the reg url into intranet url
