Is it possible to have sorting columns for the snippets/clips.
Some columns examples within square brackets:
* [ Title/Name] (title/name of clip/snippet)
* [ Date/time created ],
* [ type ] (image, text,...) ,
* [ source ] (from where: notepad, firefox,...) ,
* [ url ]

I searched on how to activate them but couldn't find it (also coudn't find in the theme-file).
Thank you

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

it would be extremely useful to have a fuzzy search system in copyq. I usually search for code snippet or other stuff with the search function, right now however this function searches only on the current tab. A way to do real fuzzy search on all the tabs at the same time would be incredibly useful for when one has many different tabs in which to search for the item.
In my specific use case i have many python snippets that are on different tabs related to different libraries. If i would like to search for an item that has 'np' in it (an abbreviation for a very popular python library) i would have to click on each tab to look for the appropriate snippet of code. 


**Describe the solution you'd like**
it would be optimal to have an option to change the kind of search in the preferences, one will keep the current system while the other will use a system that when fuzzy searching will filter the items from all the sub-tabs of the current tab for the searched string.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I found and tried to use the copyq command that the author of this library released online, this however is extremely clunky to use with the necessity of calling it with a key combination ( instead of just starting to type) and having the results in a ulterior tab. Overall the most fundamental problem of the command is the inability to make the search fuzzy and real-time (you have to send the query by hitting return), this strongly limits the ability of using copyq as a snippet manager.


CopyQ Clipboard Manager v3.9.3
Qt: 5.11.3
Compiler: GCC
Arch: x86_64-little_endian-lp64
OS: Ubuntu 19.10

I've noticed my os becomes really slow when copy pasting. By using `top` command I see that it is gnome-shell spiking the cpu to 100% for no apparent reason. I saw this is also happening when clicking the copyq taskbar icon (taking many seconds to appear, spiking gnome-shell again).

Disabling copyq makes everything fast again. (I have two screens so might be related to #1286).
Thank you for this awesome paste tools, when i want paste the previous clipboard content, i have to move my finger to down arrow or use mouse click item i need, is there any chance make me use 
can config to use emacs keybinding (Ctrl+N move to next previous item, Ctrl+P reverse).

Thank you.

Hi guys,

I love CopyQ, but now I have some problems with it. I recently upgraded from Ubuntu 16.04 to Ubuntu 18.04. With this, I started using Gnome 3. After the upgrade, CopyQ wouldn't start or run at all, so I completely uninstalled and removed all CopyQ packages, then started fresh according to your docs. 

Now it's installed and partially functional, but not working as it was prior to the OS upgrade. The clipboard fills the CopyQ list and the items are there, but when I click them (with my mouse) to fill in fields (whether in the web browser -- Firefox 71.0 -- or on my system), the data doesn't fill in. I can click an item with the mouse, then use Ctrl-V to paste (apparently that puts it into the clipboard), but this defeats the whole purpose for me. I fill in lots of fields routinely with the same information. Or I might need to copy, say, 10-15 items all at once, then sequentially add them to a message or set of forms, one by one. Going back and forth between two applications, pressing Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V, respectively, is super annoying; this is whole reason I started using CopyQ in the first place.
Is there a option to do not put the mouse or keyboard selected text in the copied list ?
