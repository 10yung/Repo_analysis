Any idea of what kind of crashing is this? I'm wondering if this is because of the library so I can dig in more. Thank you so much in advance.
Is there a way to get the cells for:

1. Calendar
2. Invitees
3. Add Attachments

for my NativeIOSEvent file ?
As you know the above 3 cell's are not available currently for the Native iOS Event. 
I have downloaded images for the dots before work and home in Calendar cell but i have no clue how to use them.
I have not worked on Objc so I have no clue how to achieve those. Would be great if someone can guide me a little or can tell how to get them/make them.
Thanks

How could i rounded my section corners using XLFormSectionDescriptor or something else.

I am using XLForm (4.0.0) and I need to set the tint color of a row with a segmented control on iOS 13.
```
let row = Row(tag: myTag,
  rowType: XLFormRowDescriptorTypeSelectorSegmentedControl,
  title: "")
```

How can I set the tint color for this row?
The following does not seem to work.
`row.cellConfigAtConfigure["segmentedControl.tintColor"] = UIColor.orange`

Thanks.
        row = XLFormRowDescriptor(tag: "usr_image", rowType: XLFormRowDescriptorTypeImage, title: "Add/Update Photo")
        row.cellConfig.setObject(UIFont(name: "HelveticaNeue-Light", size: 15)!, forKey: "textLabel.font" as NSCopying)
        row.value = UIImage(named: "add_home")
        row.hidden = (self.edit == "0") ? true : false
        section.addFormRow(row)


usr_image always comes back nil in formValues()
I load map view in the cell. when I back from view memory not deallocate and again when I come to map view memory is increased.
I recently updated to 4.0.1 and i notice that  "XLFormRowDescriptorTypeSelectorPickerView" only have Single column selection，not have Multi-column selection。So I hope it can be  Multi-column selection。
Hi,

I recently updated to `4.0.1` and the rows with XLFormRowDescriptorTypeSelectorPush, valueTransformers

```swift
row = XLFormRowDescriptor(tag: "tag", rowType: XLFormRowDescriptorTypeSelectorPush, title: "title")
row.valueTransformer = CustomValueTransformer.self
```

Values of such rows are not coming up in form.formValues on submit. When I revert back to `4.0.0` it works fine. Can you please check? 

Note: I upgraded it as a part of Swift 5 migration. Please check if that could be the issue. 
Hi guys,

It looks like the tag of the 4.0.1 version is missing. Could you please create it on the repo so we can get the latest version with CocoaPods.

Thanks,
Julien
