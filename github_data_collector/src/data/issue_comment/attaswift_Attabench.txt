First up; big fan of your book!

I wanted to run Attabench to check the performance of my own data structures. However while following the Carthage step; I'm running into the following error:

- [ ] The chart should be improved so that the legend is automatically placed in a corner where it doesn't intersect any of the curves.

- [ ] I should also be able to click and drag the legend to move it somewhere else, in case it happens to cover some interesting area.

- [ ] There should be a command to forget the custom position and restore automatic layout.

The chart renderer already includes support for drawing the legend at a custom position. The position is given as a relative offset vector to one of the corners of the chart. It is important to anchor the legend to one of the corners, so that the user does not need to keep repositioning the legend after resizing the chart.

There should be a more intuitive way to select the size range on which benchmarks are run.

The chart has an option to highlight the active range. We could make that highlight interactive, for example: let me drag the endpoints of the highlighted range to change it.

We should still display the exact numerical value of the current size range somewhere on the toolbar, but the current popup buttons could (and probably should) be replaced by something else.

I want to be able to easily access measurement values for any size.

- [ ] Make the chart interactive by automatically labeling curves with the measurement values corresponding to the horizontal position of the cursor.
- [ ] Allow me to select a particular size by e.g. option-clicking on the chart. This should toggle between the labels following the cursor and staying in place at the size I set.
- [ ] Allow me to switch between the labels displaying exact measurement values or speedup/slowdown factors relative to a particular task. For example, this could be toggled by option-clicking on a particular curve (or a line in the legend).
The chart is currently always autoscaled to fit the active size range and all existing measurements for the active benchmark tasks.

It would be nice to have a toggle to disable this auto-fitting, and to allow the user to select their own size/time range to display instead.
