If you have a question about usage of the software, do not post here, instead post to the Bioconductor support site:

This GitHub repo is to facilitate browsing of the code, and pull requests. For non-minor pull requests, it's a very good idea to first post to the support site link above, where we can discuss beforehand. I probably will not accept major PR that haven't been discussed beforehand, because I would need to have time to ensure that it won't cause unintended consequences on the user base.
