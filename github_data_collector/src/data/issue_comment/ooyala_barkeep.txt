> ### Security
> 
> #### Address CVE-2019-5477 ([#1915](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1915))
> 
> A command injection vulnerability in Nokogiri v1.10.3 and earlier allows commands to be executed in a subprocess by Ruby's `Kernel.open` method. Processes are vulnerable only if the undocumented method `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file` is being passed untrusted user input.
> 
> This vulnerability appears in code generated by the Rexical gem versions v1.0.6 and earlier. Rexical is used by Nokogiri to generate lexical scanner code for parsing CSS queries. The underlying vulnerability was addressed in Rexical v1.0.7 and Nokogiri upgraded to this version of Rexical in Nokogiri v1.10.4.

Among your future plans, are we going to use checklists for code reviews and evaluate them accordingly?
First of all, I'd like to thank the Barkeep developers for their wonderful tool. We've started doing daily code reviews with it in early 2015 and had really positive results.

However, since Barkeep is obviously no longer maintained, I quickly started to develop our own "continuous" code review tool, which has been in use at my current employer since November 2015.

I've just open sourced it so other teams might make use of it and find a living alternative to Barkeep. It's available on https://github.com/BenRomberg/cordonbleu

We also held a talk about it at a conference in Germany with our "Continuous Code Review Process" explained in more detail, it's in German only though: https://entwicklertag.de/karlsruhe/2016/sites/entwicklertag.de.karlsruhe.2016/files/folien/ContinuousCodeReview.pdf
It looks like OpenId server is not reachable from my barkeep server

Unable to contact OpenID server: Error fetching https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/ud: execution expired

It looks like openid is no more supported https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenID2

Can anyone help me with this error ?

I am trying to install Barkeep on a fully updated Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS machine using the `install_barkeep.sh` script, but the compilation of Ruby 1.9.3-p194 fails:

Seems to have something to do with OpenSSL lacking SSLv3 support.
Is there a newer Ruby release that can be used for running Barkeep on newer distributions?

Me and other people have firewall restrictions which causes this script to fail when running git clone commands that use the git protocol. I suggest instead that we use https. Technically, it will also verify that you got the repository code from the correct server as well. See this link for details: https://gist.github.com/grawity/4392747

I followed steps in https://github.com/ooyala/barkeep/wiki/Vagrant to install barkeep with vagrant. I'm using OS X Yosemite 10.10.3. I get following error.

Appreciate any help solving this.
