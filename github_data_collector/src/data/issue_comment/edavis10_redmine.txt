Hi all - there are some requests I found to make redmine load user plugins in a configurable sequence. Some advised to use config.plugins - settings (http://www.redmine.org/issues/12253, www.redmine.org/boards/2/topics/27473, http://theadmin.org/articles/redmine-plugin-dependencies/) but that never seemed to get actually implemented. I needed this for my plugins and changed the code which determines the plugin sequence. It is now minding the config.plugins setting as described in the contributions above. Cheers, Andreas

Added cloud66 folder, which makes it possible to deploy Redmine to any cloud or your own servers through Cloud 66. Unfortunately I had to add a Gemfile.lock, hope that's not a problem.

I specifically placed our folder in config/cloud/ so that any other vendors could provide similar functionality if they wish to do so.

Hello, I think this order more correctly because of ascending sort order.
And it is logically select 'today' first



Modified pop3.rb and email.rake to add an option for POP3 SSL.

I had problems with the following regex:

```
key =~ /\A[a-f0-9]+\z/
```
- On a match the index is returned but an index of zero == false.
- The range "a-f" is not enough

is this '!' at the end needed?

when I try to update a wiki content in redmine 2, it throws exception 
ArgumentError (comparison of Symbol with Arel::Table failed):
  lib/plugins/acts_as_versioned/lib/acts_as_versioned.rb:438:in `next_version'
  lib/plugins/acts_as_versioned/lib/acts_as_versioned.rb:432:in`set_new_version'
  app/controllers/wiki_controller.rb:152:in `update'

This should use maximum not calculate :max
