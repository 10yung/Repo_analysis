I read that flux is not open source. However this repository is confusing by saying "Open source GUI for xflux". It would be nice to mention that the xflux daemon is not open source. Usually I only install open source software to prevent spyware but I installed this app by mistake since it was misleading.
If someone has a suggestion for an open source alternative, it would be nice also.
When setting eg. an external display's brightness via `xrandr` or `brightness-controller`, the new settings gets immediately reset to the original value. Stopping `flux` before doing that will eliminate the problem.

Using `fluxgui 1.2.0` from the PPA and Ubuntu 18.
Before opening a new issue for a bug, please:

1. Check that you're not experiencing an existing issue. In particular, [Issue #27](https://github.com/xflux-gui/xflux-gui/issues/27) is very common.

2. Install `xflux-gui` from source if you used the PPA and the PPA is stale. This [is easy to do](https://github.com/xflux-gui/xflux-gui/blob/master/README.md) and ensures your issue isn't already fixed.

Thanks!

Hi fluxgui geeks, how to run it on raspberry pi 4 ? ( Raspbian OS) ( I installed it manually like on README described)

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ fluxgui

Hello!
I just tried to install from source f.lux. It actually works (only when i use `./xflux12 -l 0 -g 0 -r 0 -k3400 -nofork` in the CLI) BUT when i try to launch the GUI, i get this error message:
```
(fluxgui:2817): Gtk-WARNING **: 22:40:57.793: Theme parsing error: gtk.css:68:35: The style property GtkButton:child-displacement-x is deprecated and shouldn't be used anymore. It will be removed in a future version

```

I'm using Arch Linux `(Linux pc-pc 4.19.36-1-MANJARO #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat Apr 20 22:05:46 UTC 2019 x86_64 GNU/Linux)` and i have all the python dependencies it needs.
Love to get some insight. Thanks!

After installing and opening it, it gives the message "The f.lux indicator applet needs to know your latitude and zipcode to run. Please fill either of them in on the preferences screen and click 'Close'." Thing is, I can't click or type anything in the preferences screen because when I click OK to close the message box, the preferences screen goes away too.
There's been no progress on #27 for two years, and now `xflux` doesn't work on either of the computers I (the `fluxgui` maintainer) use regularly. On the other hand, `redshift-gtk` works great on both those computers. So, I'm thinking that either `fluxgui` should be abandoned until `xflux` is fixed, or we should add a [Redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) backend.

Is there some benefit to continuing this project when there is a viable alternative in `redshift-gtk`, and seemingly no future for `xflux`?

Thoughts? Pull requests?

Hello. 

Would you consider making f.lux as snap package so that it can be installed on any Linux distro? 
I've also heard that starting from 18.04, Ubuntu will be "all snap" packages instead of current .deb packages.
