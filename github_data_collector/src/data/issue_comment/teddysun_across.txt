Starting December 30, 2019, we will be requiring users of our GeoLite2 databases to register for a MaxMind account and obtain a license key in order to download GeoLite2 databases. We will continue to offer the GeoLite2 databases without charge, and with the ability to redistribute with proper attribution and in compliance with privacy regulations. In addition, we are introducing a new end-user license agreement to govern your use of the GeoLite2 databases. Previously, GeoLite2 databases were accessible for download to the public on our developer website and were licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

Starting December 30, 2019, downloads will no longer be served from our public GeoLite2 page, from geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/*, or from any other public URL. See the section below for steps on how to migrate to the new download mechanism.
