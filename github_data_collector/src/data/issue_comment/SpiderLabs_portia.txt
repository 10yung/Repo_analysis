Portia fails to verify credentials due to the fact that portia does not parse the **-d parameter**, instead uses the default WORKGROUP.

I make a temporary validation check on **line: 2342** by printing my inputs (username, password, domain).

Editing the portia.py file and manually specifying the domain value it seems to work only for account verifying function and next keep using the WORKGOUP value for the rest of the code.

I have identified also on lines **number 2720** and **2730** domain value is assigned with the value WORKGROUP instead taking the user's input.

Maybe domain="WORKGROUP" parameters exists also in multiple lines on .py file.
Hi,

I think that will be interesting to  add the possibility to obfuscate the powershell cmd executed on the remote host.
I've tested your script on host protected by KASPERSKY, and all the cmd executed on the remote host are dropped by the AV.

I've tested some manually obfuscated cmd  and its are not dropped by the AV.

Thank you.
Hi !

I think it will be cool to add an option to specify the group admin.
In French Windows, the domain admin group is named  "Admins du domaine". 

Thank you ! 
add missing 'cd impacket'
Looks very useful.  After installing I unfortunately am receiving the following:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "portia.py", line 9, in <module>
    from deps.secretsdump import *
  File "/root/portia/deps/secretsdump.py", line 56, in <module>
    from impacket.examples.secretsdump import LocalOperations, RemoteOperations, SAMHashes, LSASecrets, NTDSHashes
ImportError: No module named secretsdump

any thoughts? Thanks
My first impression was: a great tool. But after I saw the list of dependencies I started to wonder.

Do you really expect it to be installed on a compromised machine??
First of all, it might be no internet in the intranet. Second, you will not be allowed to install all these on a client's machine (unless you developed a tool for hackers which is totally illegal)

Is any solution for this problem?
#The change of directory (cd impacket) was missing, it causes an execution error.

./portia.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./portia.py", line 6, in <module>
    from deps.psexec import *
  File "/opt/portia/deps/psexec.py", line 26, in <module>
    from impacket.examples import logger
ImportError: No module named impacket.examples
When running the tool against my own Windows machine I get the following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "portia.py", line 4626, in <module>
    mountSysvol(username,password)
  File "portia.py", line 3382, in mountSysvol
    status,foundAdmin=testDomainCredentials(username,password,None,dcList[0],'WORKGROUP',True)
IndexError: list index out of range

Am I missing a dependency or something?
