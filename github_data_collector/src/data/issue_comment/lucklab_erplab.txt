Function crashes with EEG datasets that happen to have artifacts in the wrong place.
Here's a minimal test example to produce the bug:

`% [winRej2 chanRej2 ] = joinclosesegments(winRej, chanrej, shortisisam);`
`joinclosesegments([500 1000; 2000 2500], ones(2,64), 500)`

--> crash in line 109 due to non-fitting assignment
(Sorry, currently no time for more detailed report, will follow up with one. Disclaimer: I am using the cont. rejection functions not from within ERPLAB - so this may not occur from within ERPLAB)
### Description

[*Error using fseek
Invalid file identifier. Use fopen to generate a
valid file identifier.*]




<br>
my file is in the path but when i use fseek it turns uo the problem.


<br>
My code is shown as below:


dataNO = 50400;
fileNO = 1;
point  = 0;
finish = 50400;

dataBin = double(dataNO);
fn = ('C3trace%05d.trc');
null ~= ('C3trace%05d.trc');

for j=0:1:fileNO
    s = sprintf(fn,j);
    fid = fopen(fn,'r','b');    
        if fid == null
            fprintf('Cannot open %s files \n',fn);
            system(pause)
        end
        
end


fseek(fid,0,'bof');

I am attempting to use the Pop_summary_AR_erp_detection feature within a loop in MATLAB but have been getting errors.

I have the subject_list and then define the subject as subject_list in the loop.  In the loop, I successfully use load and process and loop through and save the subjects' data using:
'filename',[subject '.set'],'filepath','C:\\Users\\ERPLab\\Desktop\\'

But using this strategy for getting a .txt summary of artifact rejection has not been working:
ERP = pop_summary_AR_erp_detection(ERP, 'filename', [subject '.txt'], 'C:\Users\ERPLab\Desktop\

And I get these errors (where 055 is the subject):

Error using pop_summary_AR_erp_detection
Unmatched parameter name '055.txt' must be a string scalar or character vector that can represent a field name.

Error in pop_summary_AR_erp_detection (line 136)
p.parse(ERP, fullname, varargin{:});


How can I use Pop_summary_AR_erp_detection in a loop to get the .txt of artifact detection for each subject?

Orestis suggests that in ploterp (not pop_ploterp) the ERP trace can be overloaded. There should be rotation thru colors then different line types (sold, dashed, dotted).

Suggests possible typo in ploterp? Vector incorrectly reduplicated?
There is a report of bin numbers in the contra/ipsi assistant tool being different from expectations and manual equation entry.

Let's check.

Report:
Dear sir or madam,

I'm currently investigating selective attention, but I've found a strange thing when I tried to create contra/ipsi waveform. For example, I have 2 bins,

bin1-target on the left,129 epochs

bin2-target on the right,96 epochs.

 

When I use contra/ipsi assistant, it automatically creates

nbin1-target contra,98 epochs,

nbin2-target ipsi,203 epochs.

 

However, if I manually enter the equations, it will be

nbin1-target contra,225 epochs,

nbin2-target ipsi,225 epochs.

 

The only difference between the equation automatically created by the assistant and manually entered is that I didn't manually enter the first line as the assistant did, which is 'prepareContraIpsi'. I'm quit curious about the function of this command, and would like to know which calculation is correct.(I personally suppose nbin1 and nbin2 should have the same number of epochs). Sorry to bother you and many thanks!!
### Description

I am trying to interpolate bad channels with the surrounding channels using 'channel operations'. I typed in the formula following the recommendation in the manual (e.g., ch39 = (ch29 + ch38 + ch48 + ch40) / 4 ). When I click 'Run' i get the error message 

"Error: eegchanoperGUI cannot create a new dataset without "nchan" syntax."

Any help in solving this is much appreciated.

### Description

When plotting ERPs, legend displays one line and label clearly, and all the others are jumbled atop one another.

<br>
#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Plot ERP --> Plot ERP waveforms
2. Plotting 5 bins, on a 1000ms time range, auto Y ticks and scale, Positive up, all channels, Pre baseline correction, Classic ERP style, and Legend Position bottom.
3. Plot, and get 32 waveforms. But legend has issues.


<br>
#### Expected behavior:
Expected clearly displayed legend identifying bins.


<br>
#### Actual behavior:
Bin 1 is always clear, with a representative line across the whole ERP plot, and bins 2-5 are always layered on top of each other.

### Description

When saving a created EventList from the Advanced window, when I select a location from the 'Browse' button, it always saves in the base MATLAB folder, regardless of the actual destination I choose.

<br>
#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create EventList
2. Advanced
3. 'Write resulting EventList to...', I have 'Current dataset', 'Text File', and 'Warn me...' checked.
4. Click Browse and choose my location (MATLAB --> [Experiment Folder] --> [Participant Folder] --> [Session Folder]).


<br>
#### Expected behavior:
Expected file to save in the Session Folder that I selected above.

<br>
#### Actual behavior:
File actually saves in MATLAB base folder. This isn't a huge problem, and occurs at no other steps. Just thought you ought to know.

Hi,
Can some one help me ? From the attached figure, how can I select my required event ? I want to select two signal frequent and rare. But I am confused how to do . Please help.
