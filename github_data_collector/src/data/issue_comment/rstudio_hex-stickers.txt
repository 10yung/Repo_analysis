When I added the googlesheets4 logo, I realized that, for example, googledrive doesn't have this meta `.json` file.

Do we care about those?

In any case, I took a look more broadly at the overlap between the `PNG/`, `SVG/`, and `meta/` directories, in case we want to encourage rationalization.

Reveals that there's an errant `SVG/tidypredicts.svg` file (note the "s" in tidypredictS).

Thanks for sharing these! Would you be opposed to me creating a [hexbin](https://github.com/maxogden/hexbin) PR for the newer stickers that aren't there yet?
