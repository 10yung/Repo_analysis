I ran the checks on the package in RStudio and I got 1 error and 2 notes. You might want to fix them if you are thinking about putting dashboardthemes on CRAN.

Later, I used [goodpractice](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/goodpractice) to check your package and found quite a lot of notes. They were mostly about the lack of unit tests, using `<-` instead of `=` for assignments, and avoiding long lines of code. There were too many of those cases to list here but it might be worth addressing them. This will make your code more readable and will follow good practices.
