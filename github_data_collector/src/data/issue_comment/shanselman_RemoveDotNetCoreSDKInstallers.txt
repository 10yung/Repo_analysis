This version uses Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\... and QuietUninstallString reverting to UninstallString if the former is not available.
Complete rewrite using the uninstall list in the registry and quiet uninstall values provided by those reg entries.
Changed the code to remove all but latest version - had to convert WMI version to System.Version for sorting.
Used a select first to show current, select -skip 1 to remove all but current.
added /QN and IGNOREDEPENDENCIES=ALL for silent uninstall other than UAC prompt.
I'm not a PowerShell expert, but I've read somewhere on the interwebs that `Get-CimInstance` should be used instead of `Get-WmiObject`.

Also, you are loading the entire database and filtering after the fact.

This script will bring only the wanted products and only the wanted columns (I've added `Version` for further filtering):

     Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Product -Filter 'Name like "%Microsoft .NET Core SDK%"' -Property Name,Version,IdentifyingNumber


Might also work for 1.0, not sure since I don't have it installed.
