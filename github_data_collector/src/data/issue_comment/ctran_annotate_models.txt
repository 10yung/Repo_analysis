`spec/integration` contains a lot of files that were used for integration tests. They stopped were [disabled in 2014](https://github.com/ctran/annotate_models/commit/9540121243da58cad3ab3c0ba444f22445a995ed#diff-78ddf877ecc2a9344997ef077a77955a) and haven't been working since.

Removing because those tests don't run, don't work, and are outdated. The plan is to re-introduce integration tests sometime in the future.
Hi,

The scope of this pull request is to allow annotate_models to generate models documentation using YARD. This is the first step, i'll add more features later.
Sometime gems have their own models in their own namespace and these are not present in the app/models directory of your app. In these situations it would be very handy to have the annotate gem create a document someplace which annotates all those models.


Hi, love this gem, been using it for years.

Recently, I started using the [solargraph](https://solargraph.org/) ruby language server in my editor, which uses YARD documentation to provide intellisense like features for ruby projects. Is there any interest in adding support for this to annotate_models? If not, do you have any recommendations on the best approach to build an extension to this gem to assist with generating that documentation?

Cheers!

I refactored and structuralized RSpec test cases of AnnotateModels for readability and scalability because it was too complex to read.
