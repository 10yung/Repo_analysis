Updating the contribution guidelines a bit to send submissions to an issue. Also updating the contribution language around this process.

@primer/octicons 
Hello,

the readme states that the SVG file can be downloaded here: https://www.figma.com/file/FP7lqd1V00LUaT5zvdklkkZr/Octicons however when opening that link the only thing I see is this:

![octicons-figma](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53026/72425013-3ce56280-3787-11ea-90c0-4504de5daf44.png)

But there is nothing I can do on that page (excluding the sign-up). Am I missing something here? Or is it broken in some way? Funnily enough when you stay on that page for a while, you can see other people's hand roaming around in the same confused manner. (I tried this in latest Firefox and Chrome on a Mac.)

Thank you!

`heart` glyph updates | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4926824/71935230-23c32d00-315b-11ea-84bf-95013e6246b8.png) | Outlining the heart in the glyph vs via css enables the stroke to be centered on the path without increasing the glyph frame dimensions. Regardless of stroking method, the inset point needs to be slightly rounded or the angle increases in an awkward manner. This also updates the vertical centering in the frame to make it easier to align with text.

`line-arrow` glyphs | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4926824/71934760-f9bd3b00-3159-11ea-9f5b-2c5e90a805cb.png) | These are based on the caret/chevron symbols and are used on pricing pages to denote "<- contains all of these features". We also use the up arrow on small screens when the plans reorient to be vertically-listed.

I'm trying to use Octicons as toolbar button icons within an Atom package. I have installed `octicons` as a dependency of the package, and now am able to use the SVGs like this in my stylesheet:

```
.toolbarButton#sidebarToggle::before {
  content: url(path/to/book.svg);
}
```

What I haven't been able to achieve is to color the icons in the same stylesheet. I assumed that something like

```
.toolbarButton#sidebarToggle::before {
  color: red;
  content: url(path/to/book.svg);
}
```

might work, but it doesn't. I suppose the reason is that the SVGs are embedded but their code is not affected by the embedding document's styles. Is there a way to achieve what I want?

I found ways to colorize using CSS filters, but none of the filters allow to simply specify the color. One can come up with suitable filter sequences, but the colors I'd like to apply exist as LESS color variables (from Atom's theme), i.e. they can change, and the relation between color and filter sequence is complicated.

I have seen that the package exposes a JavaScript interface which among other things allows to access the actual SVG code, which in principle would allow to inject a color, or to create an SVG element within the document which can then be styled. But if at all possible, I'd like to avoid programmatically changing document elements and stick to CSS/LESS.
The octicon for issue notifications appears to imply urgency (!)

I don't have an origin story for this octicon, but if I had to guess it would be something along the lines of:

1. A clever take on the letter "i"
2. An issue being tightly coupled with a bug and therefore requiring urgent/immediate attention

Can we explore introducing an alternative notification octicon for issues, introducing "i" in place of "!"? 

This might be a personal issue but I notice while triaging a large volume of notifications, my attention is unnecessarily drawn to "!" when often times there is little/no urgency behind the issue itself.

@iolsen pointed out to me that we never added the `internal-repo` icon to Octicons. @pmarsceill is the original designer and I added it to github.com when we added the option for repos to be internal (vs. public or private).

We're still using the raw svg in our codebase:

```svg
<svg width="26" height="32" viewBox="0 0 13 16"><path d="M10 2a1 1 0 0 0 1 1h1v13h1V3a1 1 0 0 0-1-1h-2zM7 3v1H6V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1h2a1 1 0 0 1-1 1H7z"></path><path d="M10 4h1v2h-1V4zM10 7h1v2h-1V7zM10 10h1v2h-1v-2zM10 13h1v2h-1v-2zM9 0h1v1H9V0zM8 2a1 1 0 0 1 1-1h1a1 1 0 0 1 1 1H8zM3 11h1v-1H3v1zM3 6h1v1H3V6zM3 8h1v1H3V8z"></path><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M0 12v2c0 .55.45 1 1 1h1v1l1-.5 1 .5v-1h4c.55 0 1-.45 1-1v-2H0zm1 1h7v1H4v-1H2v1H1v-1zM0 5c0-.55.45-1 1-1h7c.55 0 1 .45 1 1v7H8V5H2v7H0V5z"></path></svg>
```

Example from the github PR (not posting link here since this repo is public):

The website proposes to download the 9.2.0 [here ](https://github.com/primer/octicons/releases/download/v9.2.0/svg.zip) but the link is broken.
GitHub uses an infinity icon and a line-arrow on the pricing page and we'd like to use them in signup. Unfortunately, it appears that marketing had to use a non-octicons set to make those happen?

I've drafted up a couple icons to achieve the same stylistic goals while matching the octicons checkmark and x which are the most-used icons on these pages (provided for context below).

The line-arrow icon is derived from the chevron octicon and is already in use in a signup flow experiment and I'd like to use the infinity icon in another one shortly. I think this would be a particularly nice addition especially since it'd let us support all of the cases on the pricing page too!
The circle shape is not circled enough and the animated rotation is not ideal. This problem is the most noticeable when the spinning icon changes back to a static one.

Here's a jsfiddle to see it live (note the circle edges floating around):

I tried to play with `transform-origin: 51% 50%;` but the main problem is in the shape of the circle.
