Hello, would it be possible to duplicate Sublime's Mariana color scheme? (https://github.com/twolfson/sublime-files/blob/master/Packages/Color%20Scheme%20-%20Default/Mariana.sublime-color-scheme)
The GitHub page has a pretty bad user experience due to loading 207 large images (74,000 vertical pixels). Refactoring the screenshots and credits into their own page.

If you're supportive of this idea I'll submit another pull request to clean up the README to showcase a few screenshots and another to probably fix the `tools/genMD.py` script which I think is not doing what it is intended to do, or not used at all.
Hi there. 
Releasing the very first attempt at console graphic design by a sweet 17yo girl. 
Appreciate merging as support in further makings :)
The "Paraiso Dark" theme seems to have been originally added in commit fd97e4b9e4c8edd7fb47f6a02e30c366688c73c0, and its name ended up with a typo ("Parasio" rather than "Paraiso").

In practice, this means there are duplicate "Paraiso Dark" and "Parasio Dark" themes in many of the subdirectories in the tree.
Alacritty has support for colors:

Some schemes are available here:

Greatly improve the Atom One Light theme (the existing color scheme has @hue-4 (green) in place of @hue-1 (cyan) and does not include @hue-6 (yellow) or @hue-6-2 (bright yellow)).
Can ayu's mirage theme be added, it looks amazing! And its easier on the eyes.
With ColorTool, it's possible to import any existing scheme in .itermcolors format, and paste it in the schemes/ directory. Could you add a "How to" install guide using ColorTool?
I love these themes, thank you for documenting and sharing them on GitHub. My MacBook was just reimaged this week, and I lost all the themes that I had [manually] installed before.

Right now, the installation directions don't contain any automated installation steps. It would be really awesome if I could simply do a `git clone`, and then run some script to install the themes.

I can help contribute this capability, if someone can describe the process to me. Let me know.

Cheers,
Trevor Sullivan
