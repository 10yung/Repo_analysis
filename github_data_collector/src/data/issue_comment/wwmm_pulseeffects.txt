I expect that exception handling is usually supported by a C++ program. I wonder why your function “[main](https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects/blob/b0c52fa2f52c8a22b3b61be3cc47950afaa6efaf/src/pulseeffects.cpp#L18 "main() function")” does not contain [corresponding try and catch instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/368184/does-it-make-sense-to-catch-exceptions-in-the-main "Does it make sense to catch exceptions in the main(…)?") so far.

How do you think about recommendations by Matthew Wilson in [an article](https://accu.org/index.php/journals/1706 "Quality Matters #6: Exceptions for Practically-Unrecoverable Conditions")?

Would you like to adjust the implementation if you consider [effects for uncaught/unhandled exceptions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/try_catch "Description for exception handling")?
Would you like to add more error handling for return values from functions like the following?
- [bindtextdomain](https://linux.die.net/man/3/bindtextdomain "Set directory containing message catalogs.") ⇒ [main](https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects/blob/b0c52fa2f52c8a22b3b61be3cc47950afaa6efaf/src/pulseeffects.cpp#L18)
- [strdup](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/strdup.html "Duplicate a string.") ⇒ [gst_pecrystalizer_class_init](https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects/blob/8e853108b3bdb0e61bc1ea13a0c6dc907ef4fcce/src/crystalizer/gstpecrystalizer.cpp#L151)
Would you like to wrap any pointers with the class template “[std::unique_ptr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer#unique_ptr "Description for the usage of smart pointers")”?

Update candidates:
- [Filter::create_bandpass_kernel()](https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects/blob/8e853108b3bdb0e61bc1ea13a0c6dc907ef4fcce/src/crystalizer/filter.cpp#L63)

[An extra null pointer check is not needed in functions](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/freestore-mgmt#delete-handles-null "Do I need to check for null before delete p?") like the following.
- [Filter::create_lowpass_kernel](https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects/blob/8e853108b3bdb0e61bc1ea13a0c6dc907ef4fcce/src/crystalizer/filter.cpp#L28 "Filter::create_lowpass_kernel function")

I would like to point out that an identifier like “[`_GstPeadapter`](https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects/blob/8e853108b3bdb0e61bc1ea13a0c6dc907ef4fcce/src/adapter/gstpeadapter.hpp#L15 "Update candidate")” [does not fit](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/cplusplus/DCL51-CPP.+Do+not+declare+or+define+a+reserved+identifier "Do not declare an identifier which is reserved for the compiler implementation.") to the expected naming convention of the C++ language standard.
Would you like to adjust your selection for unique names?
.wav file extension should be accepted for an impulse file.  
If that's impossible, then at least it should be noted somewhere in UI how exactly it wants you to rename your files.  
(it is not shown in file picker and you have to guess or search the web)
Hello there,
I'm completely new to linux, i use eOS and i instaled PulseEffets from FlatHub.

I clicked "instal"
![Capture d'écran du 2020-01-11 21 12 16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59776975/72210143-0f629580-34b7-11ea-977f-4bc3270bdba8.png)

And i don't know how to completely remove it.

Regards
Two questions rather than issues.

currently I have the following sample rate, sample format chain.

float32le,96.0kHz->F32LE,96.0kHz->s32le,96.0kHz.

![pulse](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/471260/72205180-056d7200-3478-11ea-99c6-5ee540b6693b.png)


1) In this scenario am I correct in assuming there is no re-sampling taking place as the sampling is the same at each step?
2) is it possible to change the output sample format method from s32le? I have looked around the GUI and source and cannot see anything obvious.


Thanks,

Pete.
I've decided to move from 5.1 to 2.0 and i see a weird issue, where output is too silent if i enable pulseeffects. I don't know how it's caused and why.
First off, @wwmm excellent work with this software package. You've really done something great for the Linux Audiophile community.

So, when I register this in startup in Ubuntu 18.04 (`pulseeffects --gapplication-service`), I am seeing lots of errors in syslog. It looks like it starts with this:

```
~$ update-notifier.desktop[4739]: Failed to register: Unable to acquire bus name 'com.github.wwmm.pulseeffects'
~$ pulseeffects-service.desktop[3473]: Failed to register: Unable to acquire bus name 'com.github.wwmm.pulseeffects'
```

I also see another error that looks pretty serious:

`~$ pulseeffects[10772]: pulseeffects: Fatal IO error 11 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server :0.`

But Nautilus and everything works fine?? Is this an X11 issue?? Why do we see this if it is launching as a service and not presenting the GUI?

Then later:

`~$ gnome-session[18553]: gnome-session-binary[18553]: WARNING: Could not parse desktop file pulseeffects.desktop or it references a not found TryExec binary`

I saw some bugs here related to this but they were never closed without resolution. I think I also saw a segfault in dmesg so I'll see if I can find that and post it here too
