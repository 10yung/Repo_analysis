not including that texture is harassment...
(not to include that texture in gro will create avoidable redundancy over the time)
Is it possible to run singleplayer campaign from First Encounter?

I was successfully able to run Second Encounter (Steam version), but when I copy all the files from FE in the same way, I get errors: it still looks for SE specific files (like Levels\LevelsMP\1_0_InTheLastEpisode.wld).

Hello, I'm getting this error
Severity    Code    Description Project File    Line    Suppression State
Error   C4430   missing type specifier - int assumed. Note: C++ does not support default-int    Engine  C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Include\um\winnt.h  342 

All over the place in Visual Studio 2015, it looks like DirectX is enabled by default too. What is the build configuration ( includer paths libraries , vc++ compiler versions) you are using ? 

I feel like I should be using the windows platform sdk 7 but not sure how to set this up in vs 2015

Would there be any way for you or us to create #seriousengine and #seriousengine-admin on freenode.net?

It would be useful to have a community website for this game engine and tools. E.g. The site could include screenshots, documentation, and a discussion area (such as Discourse). What are the plans for creating a portal to build community around this project?

Will this run on FreeBSD?

As far as i know there were a Linux ports of the game.
how can i build this engine in Linux.

Thanks for freeing the serious engine! I was just wondering what license the LightWave SDK is under. The README only states it's 'not under the GPLv2', but there is no different licensing information available.
