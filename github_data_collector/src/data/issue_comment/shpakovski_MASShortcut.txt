Tried demo on macbook pro with touch bar using a shortcut like "Shift+Cmd+b", it works everywhere except the case where I actually would like this to work: an OpenGL application that runs in a fullscreen and possibly takes over a keyboard. System shortcuts like Cmd+Tab work just fine, but the demo stops working when the application is in foreground.
We're seeing an issue where a registered shortcut does not get called until after a popup button's menu is dismissed.

This sounds like the same or very similar issue: https://github.com/shortcutrecorder/shortcutrecorder/issues/45

Any known issues or workarounds regarding shortcuts and menus?
When MASShortcutView starts the recording, a shortcut it currently holding will be temporarily deactivated to allow the user to type the same shortcut.
Added method overloads to pass an action that will be called on shortcut key up.
Hi, I'm building an app that when is visible (it's a borderless window so even if he app is front most the active app is the one behind it) it captures all the important keys and does something with them. All works fine except when I enable the sandbox, then only the arrows and backspace and enter is captured, if I type letters and numbers they go to the active app.
Is this a limitation of sandboxed apps or i'm doing something wrong?
Proposed solution for https://github.com/shpakovski/MASShortcut/issues/107. (Having a way to execute the event handler on key up as well).

I'd love some feedback on how to resolve the little code duplication caused by this pull request (and of course anything else that could improve the pull request).
See PR #108 for the original hint. We say that “…most shortcuts can be changed in the Keyboard & Mouse panel in System Preferences”, but the correct path should be _Keyboard_, as this pane has been split in two for a while on macOS.
Is there a way to make the make the action execute on both key down _and_ key up?
I've just spend an hour trying to hide the delete hint button because I don't want users to leave a hotkey empty. They're pre-filled and users have the option to override them.

I managed to delete the button by overriding the `getShortcutRect method and setting showsDeleteButton to No` like below, but it would be nice to have an option to hide this without overriding the code.

```Objective-C
#import "DropShortcutView.h"

static const CGFloat MASHintButtonWidth = 23;

@interface DropShortcutView()
    @property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL showsDeleteButton;
@end

@implementation DropShortcutView

- (instancetype)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)coder
{
    self = [super initWithCoder:coder];
    if (self) {
        self.showsDeleteButton = NO;
    }
    return self;
}

- (void)getShortcutRect:(CGRect *)shortcutRectRef hintRect:(CGRect *)hintRectRef
{
    CGFloat hintButtonWidth = self.shortcutValue == nil || self.recording ? MASHintButtonWidth : 0;

    CGRect shortcutRect, hintRect;
    CGRectDivide(self.bounds, &hintRect, &shortcutRect, hintButtonWidth, CGRectMaxXEdge);
    if (shortcutRectRef) {
        *shortcutRectRef = shortcutRect;
    }

    if (hintRectRef) {
        *hintRectRef = hintRect;
    }
}
@end
```
If shortcut is alread exist by other apps，it will work fail with any information.The api "RegisterEventHotKey" always return ture. Does anything I can do with it?

And it cause a problem that hotkey bind ,in fact it is a failure and can not bind same hotkey again.
so I want to change this block(@property (nonatomic, copy) void (^shortcutValueChange)(MASShortcutView *sender);),but I can found where is his implementation?

Thank you for giving me the answer.
