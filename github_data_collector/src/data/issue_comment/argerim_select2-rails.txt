Trying to upgrade to rails 6 and got the below error.

```

rails (~> 6.0, >= 6.0.2.1) was resolved to 6.0.2.1, which depends on
      railties (= 6.0.2.1) was resolved to 6.0.2.1, which depends on
        thor (>= 0.20.3, < 2.0)

    select2-rails was resolved to 4.0.3, which depends on
      thor (~> 0.14)

```

I assume select2-rails needs to update it's dependency requirements to make it compatible with rails 6.
How / Can I use this with Rails 6 and webpacker. Including the scss is fine, but  I'm trying to require the js like this in app/javasript/packs/application.js

`require("select2")`

and get Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'select2' 
I added a bootstrap 4 theme from https://github.com/ttskch/select2-bootstrap4-theme

It seems to be working for me, but I would like others to verify.


Hi,

I am facing issue with I18n for German language for **errorLoading** message and it's showing in English. 

as per my analysis   **errorLoading** function is is missing from **select2_locale_de.js.** file.
Please update.

See https://github.com/select2/select2/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#408
for changes in select2 versions since 4.0.3.

I updated the code with `rake update-select2` and selected tag 4.0.8. (Cool feature!)
Case sensitive search was resolved in select2 version 4.0.6, can the gem be updated with the new version, please? Thank you
Hi, I have rails 5.2 and ruby 2.5.1, 
i installed "gem rails-select2" 
and added to application.js 

```
//= require select2-full
//= require select2_locale_es  
```
and added to application.scss

```
@import "select2";
@import "select2-bootstrap";
```

and this is sample of call in provider.coffe.erb

```
$('#provider_provider_type_id').select2
    ajax:
      url: '<%= url.admin_provider_types_path(format: :json) %>'
      dataType: 'json'
      delay: 250
      cache: true
      data: (term, page) ->
        {
          q: term
          page: page
        }
      results: (data) ->
        myResults = []
        $.each data, (index, provider_type) ->
          myResults.push
            'id': provider_type.id
            'text': provider_type.description
          return
        { results: myResults }
    minimumInputLength: 3
    initSelection: (element, callback) ->
      if element.val().length > 0
        data = element.data('pre')
        serv_data =
          id: data['id']
          text: data['description']
        callback serv_data
```

and this is a fragment of view


```
  <div class="form-group required">
        <%= f.label :provider_type_id, type: 'number', class: 'col-sm-4 control-label required' %>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <%= f.text_field :provider_type_id, class: "form-control",
                          'data-pre' => "#{@provider.provider_type.to_json unless @provider.provider_type_id.blank?}" %>
        </div>
      </div>
```


what is wrong, what make bad?  Tanks for your help!
