A more practical way to save messages instead of html or json would be with database format so that the new messages can be added to the old ones instead of remaking the messages files and losing information.
Is it possible to suppress things like Embedded website previews and Reactions from showing up in the plain text log, or is that perhaps a feature that could be added?
So eg for website previews you'd just have the bare link someone sent instead of the preview, and for reactions you'd just have nothing in the plain text.

Note that for my purposes I'd definitely to keep the discord image link generated when you attach an image. So I wouldn't want to suppress all content outside the main body of the message, just some selectively.
H,l I'm having an issue with the plain text output format.

On Discord you can use `>>>` to indicate a block quote, and then all the text after that will have a quote level applied, though attachments and embeds will not have a quote level.

So e.g. if you write something like this in Discord:

```
Line1, above block quote
>>> Line2, in block quote
and a link https://constitutionus.com
```

It will render as something like this within Discord:

Line1, above block quote
> Line2, in block quote
> and a link https://constitutionus.com

...with an embedded website preview following the quote if you have those set to display

But the plain text output from DiscordChatExporter looks like this:

```
Line1, above block quote
>>> Line2, in block quote
and a link https://constitutionus.com

{Embed}
https://constitutionus.com
Constitution of the United States - We the People
A highly accessible, easy to use online version of the U. S. Constitution with the full text including the Bill of Rights and the rest of the Amendments includes both sequential and subject indexes.
http://constitutionus.com/we_the_people_fb.jpg
```

What I would prefer is if the output is was something like this:

```
Line1, above block quote
> Line2, in block quote
> and a link https://constitutionus.com

{Embed}
https://constitutionus.com
Constitution of the United States - We the People
A highly accessible, easy to use online version of the U. S. Constitution with the full text including the Bill of Rights and the rest of the Amendments includes both sequential and subject indexes.
http://constitutionus.com/we_the_people_fb.jpg
```

(and actually I'd like to be able to suppress embedded website previews from the text log, but that's a separate request :) )

Now interestingly, DiscordChatExporter can output what I want, *if* I have "Preview emojis, mentions, and markdown syntax as you type" beta feature turned on Discord. Here's an example of plain text output with the beta Preview stuff turned on, followed by explanation:

```[29-Dec-19 10:02 PM] JustinCEO#3132
Line1, above block quote
> Line2, made a block quote with markdown preview off
> Line 3, hit shift then then enter, then started typing this line, then enabled markdown preview before sending
```

So to be clear, on Line2 in the above, I had actually input `>>>` with Markdown Preview off, then turned it on before sending my message. And the plain text output I got was reasonable and what I'd like.

But:
1. I'm not a big fan of the beta preview features overall
2. Everyone else doing block quotes in a chat would have to use beta preview features for a whole chat log to not have the problem I'm discussing
3. There would still be the issue of past messages having suboptimal quoting

Some context for why I care:

I'm on a server that is really into detailed discussions, heavy quoting, and also posting snippets of Discord logs to markdown-supporting blogs. It'd be easier to do this if the output coming out of DiscordChatExporter were refined in the way I discuss above. This change would avoid the problem posting a snippet of a Discord log to a blog and of e.g. the first paragraph in a multiparagraph block quote being rendered as having three levels of quotes, and the rest having no quoting.

So far I've just been adjusting my chat logs manually, but since I noticed that in Markdown preview mode, Discord apparently has the ability to output the format I want, *even when a Discord message "in draft" was composed with the `>>>` to indicate a block quote`, I figured perhaps this change wouldn't be too hard to implement from a technical perspective.

Thanks for all the work on this program, I make serious use of it :)
The CSV export lacks a field for the message ID, if this was in the CSV it'd make programatically working with the data 100x easier!

I know there's a push to replace CSV with JSON but for the time being it'd be a useful additional feature to have.

Thanks!
And the release page hints that it is supposed to work for 32 bit, noting the link to the 32 bit .net 3.1 installer.
Is there a build in way to specify how partitioned exported logs are numbered?

I have chat logs that are ```Chat name - chat id -- 1 of 4``` and I'd like to drop the ```of 4``` part so that they just read ```Chat name - chat id -- 1```.
While using a user account in the client it states what's a group and what's a dm however in the export it counts it all as dms and the only way I was able to differentiate them was:

Text/Html/CSV
1. looking at the file name and how many people are listen in it (if any)
2. looking if anyone was added or left
3. Counting how many usernames are in the chat

Text/Html

4. Looking at how many people are listed in the channel (if any)

Anyway my point is it would be nice if it would notify the user that it's a group and not just a dm
If I'm wrong and it does say it somewhere I'm sorry for wasting your time
Thanks in advance
It would be amazing to have the option to use unix timestamps. This would make it much easier to migrate channel data to slack via csv import.
The core issue is for users who have large servers, a way to organize the output programmatically, rather than manually, after the export.

Including the category information in the title \ csv are the simplest solutions I can think of.

it would be great to not just have a flat hirarchie of channels names but to add the group name those channels are in to the filename AND/OR (even better) create subfolders so an entire discord server can be backed up with directory tree structure.
