compressPositions() -> fill() -> evalLocal takes bind pose rotation, should take animated rotation (probably) to fix this

- [ ] single pass probe blending
- [ ] blend different indirect light sources - env probes, light probe grids, ...
- [ ] probe visibility cubemap / handle leaking better
- [ ] indirect light on transparent objects, particles
- [ ] profit

 Array<u8> is slow in debug since constructors/destructor calls are not removed by optimizations. 
Replace it with OutputMemoryStream, which is much faster in debug
Steps to reproduce:
1. place many entities on terrain with terrain tool
2. change material of one of them and save it
3. observe infinite loop

TGAs are loadded as is right now, there should be an option to conver to dds on import
Reimplement in L2


Bugs / Missing features:
- [x] entity rotation
- [ ] normalmap in the same format as standard.shd
- [ ] mipmaps with correct coverage
- [ ] roughness & metalness
- [ ] vertical direction
- [x] use impostor shader and correct textures when creating impostor material
- [ ] save in some lossless compression, uncompressed tga is huge - related to #1298
