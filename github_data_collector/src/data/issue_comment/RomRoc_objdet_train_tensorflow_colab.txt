Can you help me with this?

The RAM is full with yellow blinker on it and it throws an error like this

Last few days I have trying to do object detection for custom dataset. Problem is, it works for single class detection like given here eg. dog. I tried it with https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/ and there is no bounding box appearing after inferencing the fine tuned model. When i do it for single class it works normally. What am I doing wrong?? I tried with different models from tensorflow zoo(ssd/faster rcnn) as suggested here https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/2773 but nothing works for multiclass training. 

MODEL used = 'faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28'

Please help...?
Hi,
While running your code on colab I found that for me it's going in root directory so object_detection/builders/model_builder_test.py gives me error. I modified that part by replacing os.path.abspath(os.curdir)   from  hard coded value.
Thank you.
First of all let me say this is not an issue regarding your code, but I think you will have some suggestions to make. I am training custom object detector with ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco as the pre-trained model. For this I am following this tutorial : https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
But in the training section it crashed after about 700 steps. My train set has about 2000 images and test set has 50. The batch size is 24, which is the default value in the config file.
Have you faced any similar issues when training? Would like to hear your suggestions.

@RomRoc any help will be great .

Hi,

- Currently `%cd` sets `/root` directory, not `/content`. Is this a change in colab VM directories structure?
- It seems like `os.mkdir('datalab')` is missing in the code?

When trying to run the notebook on google colab using Python 3 + GPU kernel, I get the error below. It looks like the correct folder has not been exported to the PATH
