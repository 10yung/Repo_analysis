Running fcserver-osx on macOS Catalina (10.15) results in a `Bad CPU type in executable` error. This is likely due to Catalina dropping support for 32 bit applications. ðŸ˜­ 

Hello Micah

I am Tony from China. Fadecandy is a very good product. It allows users to quickly display the effects of led.
But fadecandy can only be manufactured and sold in the United States. It is very inconvenient for people in Asia who want to buy fadecandy. It took more than 10 days and 30$(ship and tax) to get one fadecandy. Any plans to manufacture and ship in China or Aisa? Like raspberry pi,  raspberry pi is manufactured and sold in China and UK.
This is the first time I have used FadeCandy. I connected the raspberry pie with a USB cable, but the raspberry pie was unrecognizable. And the little lights on FadeCandy were not on. But when I connected FadeCandy to my computer, it worked very well. What's the matter with this? The voltage I use is 220V AC. I use it in China. I'm very grateful to anyone who can help me.
This is my first time to use FadeCandy. I canno0t run fcserver on my raspberry.
when I use    sudo ./fcserver-rpi         I get these errors.   someone help me please!!!!

For anyone using Processing 3 out there and trying to run the examples. This worked for me.

Found this post by Tony Massey

"For info, to convert to a sketch to run in processing 3, here's what I changed:

On the OPC tab there are 2 code changes;

1) line  33-> parent.registerDraw(this); needs to change to parent.registerMethod("draw", this);

2) line 364-> thread.sleep(500); needs to change to Thread.sleep(500);

..and that's it! (so far tested with the following example sketches grid8x8_dot and grid8x8_orbits) "

Hi Micah,

I got my RGBW stripe working. Now you can address individual pixels with R, G, B, W.
I will further develop the idea, but I thought, that this simple test may be already value to others.

Best,

Hi. I've edited my fcserver.config file to turn off the onboard led. On my fadecandy server web socket the new config shows up, but the led is still on. I used vi to edit the file on my OpenWRT router. Am i doing something wrong?
Thanks for any help!

Here is my config file as shows up in my browser:
{
    "listen": [ "0.0.0.0", 7890 ],
    "verbose": true,
    "color": { "gamma": 2.5, "whitepoint": [ 1, 1, 1 ] },
    "devices": [
        {
            "type": "fadecandy",
            "led": false,
            "interpolate": false,
            "dither": false,
            "map": [ [ 0, 0, 0, 512 ] ]
        }
    ]
}
I've been working on a proof of concept to drive APA102 led strips with [FT232H](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2264) usb to spi boards. The high-speed interfaces are ideal for driving long runs of LEDs over usb. I've gotten this to work using libftdi and libmpsse, and I'm attempting to get this work within the fadecandy server ecosystem. WIP here - [ft232h-device](https://github.com/derekolson/fadecandy/blob/ft232h-device/server/src/ft232hdevice.h)

I'm having a bit of trouble getting the ft232h chip to work using only libusb commands and was wondering if there is anyone out there who can help or has interest in getting this working. Its eventually going to be a kind of a hybrid between the fcdevice and apa102spidevice. Thanks!
fcserver.exe device polling error Windows 10 October 2018 update.

After some small period running fcserver.exe (generally < 10m) the console will report an error message:
**Error polling for USB devices: Access denied (insufficient permissions)**

After this error message has been seen, fadecandy device removal | insertion events are not recognized, side effect, subsequent calls to the same serial number will also fail with error:  **Error submitting USB transfer: Input/Output Error**

When fcserver.exe is run initially, it successfully discovers new fadecandy boards, responds to removal | insert etc.. Only after several minutes: Error polling for USB devices: Access denied (insufficient permissions) -- board removal, new insertions are non response to the program.

even fadecandy devices that were initially discovered and "online" and responsive with fcserver will eventually stop responding to commands altogether after the polling error is received.
