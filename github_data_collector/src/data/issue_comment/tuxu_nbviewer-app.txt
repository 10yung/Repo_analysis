This is a very interesting app. I wonder if there is any plan for Windows 10 users? 

I'm using QuickLook on Windows, which supports plug-ins.
https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki/Available-Plugins
I'd love to be able to link to `nbviewer://~/path/to/notebook/notebook.pynb` and have it open an instance of that notebook. I *believe* this only requires setting a plist variable, as defined in [Apple's docs here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/inter-process_communication/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/defining_a_custom_url_scheme_for_your_app).
Please consider submitting the app to be notarized by Apple for Gatekeeper.

While users can get around it by telling macOS to open it anyway, it would be nice if the app were notarized. From looking at [the developer ID page](https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/) and [the more detailed instructions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution), it seems like a fairly simple step to add to a release checklist or even a script.

I often recommend the app to folks new to the Python data science ecosystem (especially for the quick view functionality), and this would eliminate one (small) hurdle for them.


When you include images in the markdown text, they are not displayed in Nbviewer-app.

None of these methods work.

**Image in same directory**
`![](curse-of-dim.png)`

**Attached image**
`![curse-of-dim.png](attachment:curse-of-dim.png)`

**Image with img tag**
`<img src="curse-of-dim.png">`

Hello,

Could it be possible to embed external css and javascripts (like prism.js) files, just in case there isn't internet connection? When you are offline, you get a white quicklook preview because of this.

Best.
When I open a notebook, I just get a blank window. quicklook works fine but not the viewer.

I is possibly a corporate-enforced something-or-another. Is there a way to debug what's happening? I do not even know what information you would need from me. It happens on all notebook files.

Thanks
Is there a way to change the font that nbviewer uses?
Is it possible to add LaTeX support?
Hello tuxu, thank you so much for your awesome work on nbviewer! It's a real time saver for me.

Is there any plan for adding Table of Content (TOC) support into nbviewer? Like [Table of Content (2)](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/toc2). It would be a really nice feature, since many notebooks are kind of long, and a TOC would be super convenient for navigating through notebooks.

Thank you again for your hard work and contribution. Cheers!
For your convenience, [here's](https://gist.github.com/ryb/178d9bb0b2ec39c33d37685217b6d166) a trivial notebook. Clicking the link takes you to Google, but there's no way to go back to the notebook.

I think either a shortcut to go back (like âŒ˜[ in Safari) or opening external links in the default Web browser (my preference) would be good.
