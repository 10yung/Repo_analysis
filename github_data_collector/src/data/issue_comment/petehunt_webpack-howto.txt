I was hoping this howto would help an absolute beginner, but it seems to be dead-on-arrival.  Any ideas?

```

fix small typo.
English: 'inline base64 URLs for <=8k images, direct URLs for the rest'

Chinese: "内联的base64的图片地址，图片要小于8k，直接的url的地址则不解析"

I think the Chinese translation is incorrect. It should be: 

"图片小于8k时，采用内联的base64的图片地址；其余的采用直接的URL"

I must include them before. What way to do this.
I try inject to head but vue demo stop work.

Update the example app to use webpack 2.x. It also has some explanations about using html-webpack-plugin in the readme
Include extra documentation for `html-webpack-plugin`.
webpack 2 is released for a time. Is there any plan for updating this guide to webpack 2?
Really clear and well-tailored document. Like it! 

 - However maybe it could be helpfull to extend a section of https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto#4-compile-to-js-languages with more relevant in 2017 , TypeScript config for example?
 - Also Angular/React/Vue specific configs could handy, maybe ?
