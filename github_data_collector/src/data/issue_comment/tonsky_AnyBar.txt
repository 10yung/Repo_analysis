The [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) provides a bunch of folders for collating config files, and mechanisms to override the default (`~/.config`), so our home folders don't end up stuffed with dot files.

It would be great if AnyBar could support `.config/AnyBar` in addition to `.AnyBar`.
```
mv secret_icon.png ~/secret_icon.png
echo -n "../secret_icon" | nc -u localhost 1738
```

What should happen:
A question mark icon is displayed as no valid icon was found in ~/.AnyBar

What happens:
The secret icon is displayed which is located at ~/.AnyBar/../secret_icon.png

I can't think of a way to exploit it however.
Hi, I couldn't run the `nc` command as expected.
It seems I have a different version of netcat.
I am using macOS Sierra 10.12.5

$ echo -n "black" | nc -4u -w0 localhost 1738
```bash
nc: invalid option -- 4
Try `nc --help' for more information.
```
$ nc --version
```bash

$ nc --help
```bash
GNU netcat 0.7.1, a rewrite of the famous networking tool.
Basic usages:
connect to somewhere:  nc [options] hostname port [port] ...
listen for inbound:    nc -l -p port [options] [hostname] [port] ...
tunnel to somewhere:   nc -L hostname:port -p port [options]

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
Options:
  -c, --close                close connection on EOF from stdin
  -e, --exec=PROGRAM         program to exec after connect
  -g, --gateway=LIST         source-routing hop point[s], up to 8
  -G, --pointer=NUM          source-routing pointer: 4, 8, 12, ...
  -h, --help                 display this help and exit
  -i, --interval=SECS        delay interval for lines sent, ports scanned
  -l, --listen               listen mode, for inbound connects
  -L, --tunnel=ADDRESS:PORT  forward local port to remote address
  -n, --dont-resolve         numeric-only IP addresses, no DNS
  -o, --output=FILE          output hexdump traffic to FILE (implies -x)
  -p, --local-port=NUM       local port number
  -r, --randomize            randomize local and remote ports
  -s, --source=ADDRESS       local source address (ip or hostname)
  -t, --tcp                  TCP mode (default)
  -T, --telnet               answer using TELNET negotiation
  -u, --udp                  UDP mode
  -v, --verbose              verbose (use twice to be more verbose)
  -V, --version              output version information and exit
  -x, --hexdump              hexdump incoming and outgoing traffic
  -w, --wait=SECS            timeout for connects and final net reads
  -z, --zero                 zero-I/O mode (used for scanning)

Remote port number can also be specified as range.  Example: '1-1024'

I found it useful to identify what a particular dot was doing using a label in the menu.

I added some code to add a label to the menu based on the environment variable ANYBAR_LABEL. If this variable is set the text is shown in the menu. 

I've created a fork which adds support for any icons from icons8.com. Just pass a icon id and the icon will be used for the menu item.

Not sure whether you want this functionality in AnyBar or want to stick to the colored dots? Should I fine tune my fork and create a pull request?

i know in shell i can do `echo -n black | nc -4u -w0 localhost <port number>` but i cant figure out how to accomplish this in applescript (besides using `do shell script "command"`)

this would suggest its possible to set the udp port but i cant figure out the syntax.
â€¦ for ANYBAR_DESC env var to set the tooltip for the icon and added an entry above the port to show the description as well so you can run multiple instances of the app and keep them straight easier.

open -a AnyBar
ANYBAR_DESC="My build" open -na AnyBar
ANYBAR_DESC="BLAH BLAH" open -na AnyBar

The first will just be named AnyBar (the default).
The second would have its status bar item tooltip as "My Build" and the menu would have the same text at the top.
The third would would have its status bar item tooltip set to "BLAH BLAH" and the menu would have the same text at the top.

It would be awesome if it is possible to play some sound every time it changes. 
Please, add extension for ipython based on AnyBar  in description README.md

So how come my anybar dot reverts to red after blinking momentarily into the desired colour for a second or two? very frustrating. however this problem fixes itself once i disconnect/reconnect my wifi. please help.
