Is there a way to get an integer mask indicating the unique segment each pixel belongs to? That is, two pixels may end up with the same color in the Potts segmentation but, if they do not belong to the same contiguous region, should receive different labels. This is the result returned by the [scikit image](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.segmentation.html#skimage.segmentation.felzenszwalb) segmentation algorithms, for example.
