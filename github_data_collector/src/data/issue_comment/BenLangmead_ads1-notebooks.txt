Greetings, 

Thanks for the effort! 

A tiny issue in the **4.03_DeBruijn.ipynb** - 
The install_ext magic has been removed from IPython. Extensions should be published as Python packages, and installed with pip. 
@BenLangmead what would be the license for these?

Hello Ben,
May be you can help me.
I could not understand 
How using `shift` as argument in `max(shift, skip_bc, skip_gs)` and
`max(shift, skip_gs)` affects computation optimization ?
Is it redundant ? 
Or I just miss right test case .
