I hve tested this following code into the online editor and mermaid does not recognize it. Maybe updating the plugin should resolve the issue ?
```
\```mermaid
classDiagram
class Serie
  Serie : serieID
  Serie : titre
  Serie : annee
\```
```
Hi I found mermaid.js has new version. I thought we can upgrade it.

 It will be very cool to integrate mind map function.
Example:
https://github.com/TobLoef/text2mindmap
http://beta.textizemind.com/
https://freetxtmind.github.io
This is really annoying, when I copy a URL such as https://www.google.com/, it pastes the whole thing as:

```
[https://www.google.com/](https://www.google.com/)
```
Just leave it **alone**! It already will turn URLs into links without the brackets, and this interferes when writing markdown for hyperlinks.

Is there a way to disable this?
Diagrams of type `classDiagram` in the StackEdit app do not render.

<img width="1673" alt="Screen Shot 2019-12-28 at 1 53 10 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2332648/71548244-7ccfdb80-2979-11ea-8b50-1352606ad385.png">

Example taken from [mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/classDiagram?id=class-diagrams):

There are several mermaid.js issues ([#749](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/pull/749), [#748](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/748), [#859](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/859)) that deal with this functionality, but none here in the StackEdit issue queue.

I have not spun up a local instance to check into this, but I do see that the `classRenderer` is imported and configured in [mermaidExtension.js](https://github.com/benweet/stackedit/blob/master/src/extensions/mermaidExtension.js). Not sure what else is missing.
Has anyone successfully gotten StackEdit to work in Angular?

I've been doing research on different js-based markdown editors and StackEdit is the nicest one I've seen.  I'm surprised that it's such an active project, with no real information (anywhere) on getting it to work with Angular 2+.

I looked at StackEdit.js, but I don't necessarily want it hosted elsewhere.  I suppose I could run a simple (non-Angular) StackEdit site separately and point StackEdit.js to that.  Is that the best way, or has anyone had any success getting StackEdit to run natively with Angular?

Thank you
Hello,
I would like the ability to upload a LaTeX and or Word template. Most conferences, such as [HCI International,](http://2019.hci.international/guidelines-for-final-camera-ready-papers) [ACL,](http://www.acl2019.org/EN/call-for-papers.xhtml) [ICAD,](https://icad2019.icad.org/call-for-participation/#FullPapers) and every other conference or journal has a LaTeX and or word document they ask that you provide your paper in.
When I introduce the idea of using StackEdit to my colleagues, they love the idea of Markdown, but will not use StackEdit until they can upload the template they need for the conference.

I know pandoc allows both doc and LaTeX templates, so an option would be to allow these templates just for Pandoc export.
Ideally, we could view the paper in the viewer in real-time, but at the moment there is no support for these templates, and that makes StackEdit a no-go for my colleagues.
If we could use either a Word or LaTeX template, that would go a long way in having StackEdit accepted in the academic community, along with [bibtex citations.](https://github.com/benweet/stackedit/issues/1580)
Hello,
I would like support for bibtex citations. I would like to have a citation list and a set of csl files, as well as the link citation option.
I see that there is pandoc support. There could be three options:

1. You pay for adding bibtex citations, similar to what you do with pandoc, and when the markdown renders in the viewer, you can choose to have it rendered with pandoc.
2. Have a button that says "render with citations", and when you press that, the viewer will show the rendered markdown with citations.
3. Just have the bibtex citation work with pandoc exports and no viewer.

https://github.com/benweet/stackedit/issues/20
Talked about this issue, and if pandoc is not an option, then there is [a js biblatex csl converter.](https://github.com/fiduswriter/biblatex-csl-converter/)
[There is citeproc-js](https://github.com/Juris-M/citeproc-js)
[There is citation.js](https://citation.js.org/)
I'm sure there will soon be pandoc using emscrypten, but that hasn't happened yet.
Actually, the extension does add the _blank attribute - the attribute is there if I inspect the source code in the right window (iFrame).
But it seems that the _blank attribute is stripped away when I click the  HTML-code button or publish the HTML on a file.
Is there anything that I can modify? Thanks in advance

After permitting StackEdit to access Google Drive files - but using 'Restrict access to files opened by Stackedit' the following happens:
