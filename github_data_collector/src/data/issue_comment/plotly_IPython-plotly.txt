FYI, I just noticed this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17533365

The comment show that you all are throttling the plots, so Plotly's getting some bad press at this point. Maybe unthrottle?
I changed the link to this one: https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3338657

@jackparmer mentioned to me that these notebooks were published under a CCBy-like license. There is no license file in the repository and the published versions do not have a license.

Can we add a license to both? 

You're going to loath me :unamused: for this but it throws errors when I try and compile v4 notebooks for contribution.

Think you referenced this is #4 at least in terms of IPython 3.

The `body.html` output  of `make publish` is suppressed in some python environments.

The root of the problem has not been identified yet. 

Possible causes:
- Package conflicts in Anaconda installs
- A bug in https://github.com/etpinard/delightfulsoup
