**Description**
<!-- Please describe the theme error, and how to get to the page-->
-open search
- type in some letters
- click enter

the pictures on the result page are too big (wider than my screen)

the behaviour started with Frost 2.4.2
setting back Frost to Default settings (deleting date) did not help
downgrading to 2.4.1 solves the problem, so the cause is not a server-side change from FB

perhaps it's the root cause is similar to #1617

I would like to be able to download images from posts in the quality available via the desktop web version of Facebook.

For example, I'd like to be able to download each image from this post (https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2991689560842073&id=100000031755553) in the quality available here after pressing "Download" (https://facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2991686384175724&set=pcb.2991689560842073).

I appreciate you considering my request.
Hope to get a response as to whether the suggested feature is going to be added.

Enjoy!
In the newest version of Frost v2.4.2, when I turn Enable Overlays off in Behavior then personal pages and group pages load incorrectly with horrible large images and cheap low res links.
Intro buttons have backgrounds when they should be transparent

**Describe the bug**
In the right popup panel, on top, I see 3 profile pictures. When you have 4 or more profiles, then there is drop-doen menu. Also in the same menu is 'manage profiles'. 
This is not working with latest version. When I tap the drop-down button, nothing happens, nothing popup, no changes in the menu, I still see ONLY profile specific menu items like 'most recent', 'top stories', etc.

Frost 2.4.2

- [x] I have verified that the bug does not occur in my mobile browser (at https://touch.facebook.com/)

**Describe the bug**
This issue actually started with v2.4.1 but I figured I'd just go back to v2.4.0 and wait for v2.4.2 which I did, but the same thing is now happening with v2.4.2 as well (so I'm back at v2.4.0 now, but will be happy to load v2.4.2 again to test).

Everything works fine, except for when I try to Share an article to Frost.  I have always used "SmartNews" and have never had a problem doing this until v2.4.1  The problem still exists even when trying to Share a page from my Web Browser to Frost though.

What happens is that the Frost screen, where you tell it to "Post" it (after share) pops up, but it doesn't show anything except a solid white background, with the blue Frost border, that says, "Frost Web", in the top blue border.

The thin little bar that would go across (right where the top of the white meets the the bottom of the top blue border) as it loads, looks like it's about 10% of the way done and it just stops there.  I let it sit there for a while, but it didn't do anything.

I did try performing a clean install.

I like the other changes in the app and would love to get v2.4.2 working! :-)

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behaviour:

The steps are simple:
1) Open article (or whatever) in app or browser.
2) Choose "Share".
3) Chose "Frost".

Thank You!

would it be possible to automatically remove exif from pictures before sending them to fb servers (posting and sending in conversation)? there is external app for that (like scrambledexif), but would be great to have that in built in frost. facebook strips any exif for us anyway, so why to feed it with information by default?

It will be great to open pages, like "Messages" when you don't have internet connectuon or for mobile data save.
FaceSlim has "Offline mode" option, and "Max number of pages to save"
