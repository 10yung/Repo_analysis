Related issue: #1928 

This PR adds support to Mezzanine for Django 2.2. I've used some of the code from @khadegd 's [August](https://github.com/khadegd/august) fork but tried to stay away from the more major changes such as the bootstrap version bump.

Features:
- Working keywords fields
- Working drag and drop inlines
- URLs in 2.0 format

Notes:
- Removed references to Python 2 (since Django no longer supports it)
- Since Django 1.11 will be unsupported in April this PR is only compatible with Django 2.2+
- I've updated Tox to only support Python 3.6+ and Django 2.2+, it will obviously fail with the django master branch since that is now at version 3.
- Also requires [an update to grappelli-safe](https://github.com/fermorltd/grappelli-safe/tree/2.2-compat) for inlines to work correctly.

When using radio buttons in dynamic inlines this raised an 'Unhandled
field in dynamic_inline.js:' alert. This was fixed by dublicating the
'checkbox' case in the function 'anyFieldDirty' in 'dynamic_inline.js'
This PR includes two improvements to the thumbnails code when using remote media storage (eg. S3).

### 1. Allow absolute path for THUMBNAILS_DIR_NAME
Allow the `THUMBNAILS_DIR_NAME` setting to specify an absolute path. In this case, `THUMBNAILS_DIR_NAME` will be created relative to the `MEDIA_ROOT` directory, rather than relative to each image's directory. Each image's path is recreated below the root `THUMBNAILS_DIR_NAME` directory to avoid name collisions. Default behavior is not changed, so existing installations are not affected.

    THUMBNAILS_DIR_NAME = "/.thumbnails"

Using this feature offers improvements to `listdir()` on eg. a Boto3 storage backend, which is constrained to pulling all objects under a particular directory (ie. recursively) due to the nature S3-like object storage systems. With many thumbnail images, this can be a major performance hit, for example when browsing the Media Library in admin. By keeping this directory at the root level, outside of the location of media library files (`/uploads`), thumbnails do not show up in the Media Library at all, mitigating the problem.

### 2. Use default_storage for thumbnail creation rather than os
Implementation of the fix described here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mezzanine-users/WGVaNhD5vRs/7Ktw7-UkosgJ. Thumbnails are now created solely with `default_storage` rather than `os` functions, which of course does not work when using S3 for media storage.

Note that this fix also appears to be implemented in a couple of other PRs: https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine/pull/1951 and https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine/pull/1922

Make thumbnail template tag be compatible with custom storage engines

* Doesn't create thumbnails in local fs while using custom storage
* Fix existence check logic with custom storage

I have updated all the urlpatterns according the DJango 2 updates as i have changed urls that contain regex from url() to re_path() and the urls that doesn't contain regex to path(). Also imported new modules for django.urls
Hi, I forgive for my bad English, I have a problem with mezzanine cms, it allows me to edit the main page (exallievidonbosco.it) but not the subsites created, for example, potenza.exallievidonbosco.it. It tells me the following error message: Sorry, an error occurred.

Any problems with permits? I made the mark of the subsite, just created, and the problem always reappears, where can I find the logs?
thanks in advance, Andrea

On a fresh install, running the local django development server shows the following:
> ?: (urls.W005) URL namespace 'djdt' isn't unique. You may not be able to reverse all URLs in this namespace

When installing the demo pages the following error occurs:

> django.db.utils.OperationalError: (1366, "Incorrect string value: '\\xCC\\x81vila...' for column 'file' at row 1")

Django 1.11.23

For the time being, this can be fixed by setting your database character set to utf8mb4 after creating the database:
`ALTER DATABASE yourDBname CHARACTER SET = utf8mb4 COLLATE = utf8mb4_unicode_ci;`
Upon answering the prompt for installing the initial demo pages, I am presented with the following traceback:
```

Would you like to install some initial demo pages?

The contact form seems okay, the gallery seems okay, the About page just says "About us" at the top and has two sub-categories - Team and History.  There are two empty boxes on the right side of the page on all pages except Blog (the bottom box fills in with "Feeds RSS/Atom"), and the footer seems a bit wonky.
