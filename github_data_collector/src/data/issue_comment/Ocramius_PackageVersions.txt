The error has already been reported at #98, but the assumption that it is a permission / UID issue is wrong.

When installing under xfs it works without problems:
```
mkdir /tmp/ocramius
cd /tmp/ocramius
composer require ocramius/package-versions -vvv
```

But when installing under vboxfs (Virtualbox, Windows) it fails:
```
mkdir /home/vboxfs/ocramius
cd /home/vboxfs/ocramius
composer require ocramius/package-versions -vvv
```

The error-message ist:

Tested with Cent OS 7, PHP 7.3, composer 1.9.0-1.6.0

I can install many other packages without problems under the vbofs:
```
composer require chadsikorra/php-simple-enum
composer require friendsofsymfony/rest-bundle
composer require ldaptools/ldaptools-bundle
composer require nelmio/api-doc-bundle
composer require paragonie/random_compat
composer require ramsey/uuid
composer require symfony/routing
```

However, only when using the sleep-trick at https://github.com/laravel/homestead/issues/1240#issuecomment-513989365 in composer I can install ocramius/package-versions under vboxfs without problems. So it looks like there is something special in ocramius/package-versions which other packages do not have. But what?
