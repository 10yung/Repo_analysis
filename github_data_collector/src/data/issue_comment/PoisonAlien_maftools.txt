Sorry to be this much annoying 

I need help please 

I have a list of genes that have been previously reported in the COSMIC database about ESCA. I also have my own maf object for my tumours in ESCA

How can I show the status of COSMIC genes in oncoplot of my maf object please?

Something like this
![nihms474888f4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43682980/71494529-7a507300-280d-11ea-931b-ea2ebe227be4.jpg)

For example showing in my oncoplot if a gee has been previously reported in COSMIC or any information like if this is a false positive (belong to big gene families like TTN1, etc)
Thank you for any help
Hi

Thanks for this software. Can we show alongside the plots come from GISTIC visualization? Something like this

Thank you in advance for any help for getting this 

Can I easily extract which mutations are within each of the clusters in each of the genes. 
For example if the oncodrive results say there are 35 mutations in clusters and there are 3 clusters, can extract each cluster and its contents?

Thanks
I am using the options `sortByAnnotation = TRUE`, `groupAnnotationBySize = FALSE` and `annotationOrder = c(1:4, "NA")` and the samples in the heatmap are plotted in a desirable order. However, the clinical legend is in an unappealing, seemingly random order.

Hi

For each patient I have been given .vcf for snp and indel separately. So I annotated those separately by annovar I am not sure how I could deal with these in maftools? Should I combine .vcf for snp and indels before annotation by annovar or maftools can find the matched snp and indel files for each patient?

Thank you for any help
Hi, dear authour,

When I use oncodrive() function of maftools, there is the following error message:
My sript is: laml.sig = oncodrive(maf = laml, minMut = 5, pvalMethod = 'zscore');
The message: 
################################
Estimating background scores from synonymous variants..
Assuming protein change information are stored under column HGVSp_Short. Use argument AACol to override if necessary.
Not enough genes to build background. Using predefined values. (Mean = 0.279; SD = 0.13)

Error in merge.data.table(getGeneSummary(maf), nonsyn.scores, by = "Hugo_Symbol") : 
  Elements listed in `by` must be valid column names in x and y.
#####################################

It seems that Hugo_Symbol lacks in  "nonsyn.scores" obtained by " parse_prot(dat = non.syn.maf, 
        gl = gl, m = 5, calBg = FALSE, nBg = 100)". 

My maf file is OK, since the other functions work well, and I also check the file structure.
The data include 40 patients' SNV from TCGA. The  length(laml@gene.summary$Hugo_Symbol) is 954. This function works well when I use 300 patients' data.

Many thanks.


Hi,

since oncotator is discontinued - is this gonna be updated to use with their new foncotator?
Hi, 
Resently, I used extractSignatures to get signatures,but it alway reported bug as below.
So, how could I can deal with this bug?
Thank you very much for replying!

If the user specifies `genes`, the value of `top` is ignored.

**Use Case**
The user is interested in tumour suppressor genes and downloads a database from [TSGene](https://bioinfo.uth.edu/TSGene/).

```r
> tumourSuppressors <- read.delim("Human_TSGs.txt")[, "GeneSymbol"]
> length(tumourSuppressors)
[1] 1217
```

There are 1217 genes. The user wants to see the top 10 mutated tumour suppressor genes `top = 10` , but maftools creates an unreadable plot containing all of the genes.

A second problem is that it doesn't seem possible to only plot copy number variants, even if providing a dummy MAF object. For example,

```r
MAFnone <- data.frame(Hugo_Symbol = "FAKE-IGNORE", Chromosome = '.', Start_Position = '.', End_Position = '.', Reference_Allele = '.',
               Tumor_Seq_Allele2 = '.', Variant_Classification = "Missense", Variant_Type = '.',
               Tumor_Sample_Barcode = "SP13-2986primaryTissue", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Then, when I do `oncoplot(MAFnone, top = 10)` I get 9 copy number genes and the fake missense mutation in the MAF table in the bottom row of the oncoplot, even though there are plenty of high frequency copy number variants which could be in place of the fake gene rare SNP. I have to set `top = 11` to see the top 10 copy number genes, as shown below.
