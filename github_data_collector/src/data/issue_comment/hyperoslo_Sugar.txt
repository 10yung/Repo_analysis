I added Sugar to my Podfile. On pod install it installs version 4.0.0. In this version somehow the Swift language is still set to 3.  All code changes for swift 4 are correct so that I could manually change this value to 4 without any problem. 
integrate with https://github.com/SwifterSwift/SwifterSwift 
to have all of great things in one place  

As @vadymmarkov brought up in  (https://github.com/hyperoslo/Sugar/pull/78#issuecomment-220854098), Sugar is growing out of proportion, one can even start to call it obese.

We need to come up with a good strategy to tackle this problem. As I wrote in #78;

> I think we need to adress this is a good way, maybe splitting it out in to separate repos where it makes sense and then starting to mark things as deprecated and then remove extract and remove bits and pieces from the Sugar core.

That could be one way of handling it. But we need to find a good middle ground to find what goes into Sugar and what does not. Do we see `Sugar` as a incubator for future pods, exposing where there could be potential for more components or is it more like the name implies, a syntax sugar for Cocoa and Cocoa Touch were we feel that Apple default implementation is falling short.

Regardless of that, the issue needs solving so, without further ado, discuss peoples!
