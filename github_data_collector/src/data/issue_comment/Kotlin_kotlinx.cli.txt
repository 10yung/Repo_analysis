If an ArgParser has subcommands registered, these subcommands do not appear in the default help text. In addition, if an ArgParser *only* has subcommands registered, running the program with no arguments gives no output.

This is using the current version of kotlinx.cli bundled into Kotlin/Native.

Add gradle installation script to readme file (using jitpack.io) 

(The `> TODO download link` have been on readme file on since **Sep 20, 2017** ðŸ˜³ !!!!! fabe2de1cc74a7793f050f6c7b5165fcceb29eee )
This is tied to option "printHelpByDefault", and my assumption this meant if there a real argument parsing error the command help would be printed.
I need to define multiple commands and using the dsl syntax is nice. 
Hi, I would like to use your library but would prefer if I could just consume the dependency in my Gradle build file.  https://jitpack.io/ is a fast an easy way of doing that.
Thanks for this project. Today, I am using  https://github.com/airlift/airline for most my CLI parsing and it has better support for Single and multi-command modes. Does kotlinx.cli have any plans to support something like that in future?
