Under Adding A Panel -> Configuration , setting the environment variable $PANEL_FIFO="/tmp/panel-fifo" doesn't point to a directory that exists. Does /tmp/panel_fifo need to be created ? or is that something that is created from one of the example scripts ?

When I `echo $PANEL_FIFO` i just get a blank output.
Under the point
**Configuration / Without a Display Manager** it would be helpful, for inexperienced arch users like me, to give a note where to find the  /bspwm/example/... files

Thanks
im using mint 18.3
i got error when `make` on bspwm and sxhkd 

> /var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/make-0.3.1/bin/make:4:in `<top (required)>': undefined local variable or method `make' for main:Object (NameError)
	from /usr/local/bin/make:23:in `load'
	from /usr/local/bin/make:23:in `<main>'

i have installed `make` and `gcc` 
THanks for helping
In your readme you said you use tint2 for a windowlist in the statusbar. I don't see any config files for this anywhere in the repo and I don't see this in the scrot. Where is that hiding?
Is the xmonad configuration still usable? I am having issues with the panel only extending halfway across the screen. 

if you want to update the wiki, there is no bspwmrc file for the DM users but on the last section there is a reference to this files for non DM users

i've followed the instruction on https://github.com/windelicato/dotfiles/wiki/bspwm-for-dummies for install bspwm and add the lemonbar,i can run bspwm but the lemonbar is nothing?
this is my ~/.xinitrc : 
..................................
session=${1:-2bwm}
case $session in
        dwm             ) exec dwm;;
        2bwm            ) exec 2bwm;;
        bspwm           ) exec bspwm;;
        xmonad          ) exec xmonad;;
        gnome           ) exec gnome-session;;
        gnome-classic   ) exec gnome-session --session=gnome-classic;;
        *) exec $1;;
esac

sxhkd &
keybinding is work for me but the problem only lemonbar.

You might want to adapt your dotfile to the way bspwm now loads up.

Check [this commit](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm/commit/400cb3af693260d8e0aacbf7e2cd3c62373020b2 Loads sxhkd at bspwm startup.).

when i run make, i get this:

```
ubuntu@udoobuntu: ~/bspwm $ make
cc -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra -I/usr/local/include -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112L -DVERSION=\"0.9\" -Os  -c -o bspwm.o bspwm.c
