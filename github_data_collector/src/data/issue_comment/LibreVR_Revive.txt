 In the HMD Steam VR home menu, ReVive overlay button displays no games but upon clicking where the games should be, get a manifest error before the game loads. How to repair this disconnect between Steam VR and Revive? 
**Describe the bug**
Reprojection (I assume) doesn't seem to be functioning in any way while playing Stormland

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Start SteamVR on either the latest stable Revive build or the latest daily build (1/15/20)
2. Select 'Revive'
3. Select Stormland'
4. Entire game, including splash text, experiences a player feedback delay.

**Expected behavior**
Stormland runs as normal, prioritizing viewport feedback over overall framerate.

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - App: [Stormland]
 - OS: [e.g. Win10]
 - Headset: [Acer Windows Mixed Reality Headset]

**Versions (please complete the following information):**
 - Revive: 1.9.2.5
 - SteamVR: 1.9.16


Hello, I've recently installed revive and all games seem to work fine with the exception of contractors.

Once the game is loaded through the revive launcher within steam VR it gives a "Fatal Error" with a black screen.

Oculus Quest - Oculus Link
Defector not working on Lenovo Explorer. I get the following message when I try to play  "Rendering to your HMD, please put on  your rift headset" and nothing shows on the headset.
**Describe the bug**
The native desktop gameplay window for The Climb has multiple "black outs" occur during gameplay.  Some are very fast, but others, such as when landing a jump last multiple seconds.  It does not appear to be caused by the "obstructed view" prompt in game.  Inside the Index HMD,  the game has no blackouts.

I wonder if it has to do with the presentation of the SteamVR chaperone system (like if it appears AT ALL)?  Or the other possibility is if it is caused by Motion Smoothing (or other steamvr video improvements).

It is really hard for me to test this,  but I have some recorded footage showing the blackouts.  I'll do another quick test to see if I activate the chaperone, if it blacks out the screen.  But I obviously can't record that for you.

**I did confirm the blackout displays on my monitor at the time of recording.**  I recorded the content using OBS in multiple ways and it also made no difference.  One test the issue occurred when OBS was not recording.

**I also confirmed that the on-screen presence of the chaperone boundary is not the cause.**

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Play The Climb
2.  Randomly experience blackouts on the "default" desktop gameplay window. (I am recording it via OBS - other games do not seem to have this issue, like beatsaber/SteamVR for example)

**Expected behavior**
I expect the window to show the exact same as what I see in game.

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - App: The Climb
 - OS: Win10
 - Headset: Index

**Versions (please complete the following information):**
 - Revive: latest
 - SteamVR: latest

**Additional context**
I'm using room-scale chaperone for SteamVR.

When opening vader immortal 3, i am able to enter the dojo with no problems. The story mode, however, has a black screen with no audio whatsoever. I've tried injecting and launching from the vive dashboard. My version of revive is 1.9.2

 - App: Vader Immortal - Episode 3
 - OS: Win 10
 - Headset: HTC Vive with Index controllers

**Versions (please complete the following information):**
 - Revive:1.9.2
 - SteamVR:1.9.16

Edit: Injecting opens the story with visuals but no controller buttons are responding.
Edit 2: Have tried betas of Revive and SteamVR with no luck
Edit 3: Complete reinstall of revive and oculus home with no results.
Am I missing something or is there no way to swap bindings from one controller to the other?
**Describe the bug**
Upon launching the game, initially a few maybe gold or yellow dots appear, within an otherwise totally white volume. Then the game title reappears, say 'waiting', then a white dome appears a few feet beyond the tracking volume, then it crashes out.

**To Reproduce**
It will happen every time, regardless of if I launch it from in the headset or the desktop using the Revive menu.

**Expected behavior**
I'm not really sure what this means, or how it differs from the describe the bug thing above. I feel like expected behaviour is for the game to work, but that sounds like I'm being rude.

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - App: [Shadow Point]
 - OS: [Windows 10, specifically 18362.535]
 - Headset: [HTC Vive with Valve Index Controllers]
I've seen other bug reports include specs, it's an i7-9700k with an RTX 2070.

**Versions (please complete the following information):**
 - Revive: 1.9.2.0
 - SteamVR: 1.9.16

**Additional context**
I found that this issue seems to have happened to someone who posted a bug around the time the game launched, but an update they hadn't installed had already fixed the issue, so perhaps whatever was fixed was somehow undone later.

Thanks.

Today I bought Stormland and tried everything.
Stormland is still not starting.

I have an Samsung Odyssey, i7, GTX 2070 OC. Win10.
Everything patched.
Game installed in Oculus app as described with standard paths.
Tried Revive 1.9.1 with Revive Stormland Fix
Tried Revive 1.9.2 with and without Revive Stormland Fix
Tried Revive 1.9.2.4 without Revive Stormland Fix
I also tried the direct injection. 

Nothing works.

After Starting the Game in the Revive Dashboard the Stormland Pic shows up for some seconds then Home is loaded. No errors.
All other apps within the Revive Dashboard are starting.

Help would be great!!
**Describe the bug**
The game starts normally, and I even played the tutorial.  However, when I choose the main story, the game begins to load, and when the loading screen transitions to the level, the screen turns black in my headset.   The picture shows up on my desktop though.  

**To Reproduce**
Start the game inside Steamvr, then start a new game.

**Expected behavior**
Should be a game showing up in my headset.  Not just a black screen.

 - App: The Tower 2
 - OS: Windows 10 Pro 1909 - 18363.476
 - Headset: Samsung Odyssey+
-Revive - 1.9.20
