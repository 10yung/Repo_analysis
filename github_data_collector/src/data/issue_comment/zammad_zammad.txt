### Expected behavior:

Permissions of object manager attribute for screen should merge correctly for multiple permissions.

### Actual behavior:

Permissions are always set based on the last permission looped for the screen of the object manager attribute.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Create a object attribute for 2 permissions:

- ticket.agent
- admin.organization

Enable **shown** state for admin.organization but not ticket.agent

Login with a user which contains a role and the configured permissions.

Now the Organizations tab in the admin interface will not show the object attribute because of the permissions which are not merged correctly.

Yes I'm sure this is a bug and no feature request or a general question.

### Infos:

* Used Zammad version: 3.2 (hosted)
* Browser + version: Firefox 72.0.1
* T#1065092

### Expected behavior:

* When I set the time for a "Waiting for" status, a click on the hours and an entry of e.g. "13" should enter it correctly before the colon as "13:00".

### Actual behavior:

* When changing the ticket status to a "waiting-state", I select a date, then I click on the hours in the time field and enter e.g. 13

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22768032/72250249-74bf9f00-35fb-11ea-86a3-092b6186d026.png)

*Actually the 11 should become a 13, but in the time field "01:03" is entered:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22768032/72250355-b2242c80-35fb-11ea-8d5d-9b98cb7432ed.png)

* It's just possible to correct the time field by deleting everything and entering 13 again. 

* But if I select another field in between, the input will again be displayed incorrectly. 

### Steps to reproduce the behavior:

* Open Zammad with Firefox
* Go into a ticket and change the status to a "Waiting status
* Try to enter an hour e.g. 11 o'clock

### Expected behavior:

* When starting to type a quick text, then noticing that I don't want to use quicktext. The text written directly afterwards should stay where it is.

After typing out the actual text I simply press enter.
I could not test this yet in the latest Zammad version as it is not deployed yet on our servers but I saw nothing related to this in released notes so I assume it is also broken in the later version.

Yes I'm sure this is a bug and no feature request or a general question.

### Expected behavior:

It's perfectly possible to reference ticket variables with a depth of more than 2 layers ( `#{first.second.third}`).


### Actual behavior:

Some of the ticket variables are not working.
If this does affect other object spaces is not know.

### Tested variables:

The following variables have been  verified working / not working:

```
- #{ticket.owner.firstname} not working
- #{ticket.number} working
- #{ticket.created_by.lastname} not working
- #{ticket.customer.firstname} not working
- #{ticket.created_at} not working
```

* create a custom object and fill in the link template settings like so: 
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6549061/71411550-10d43700-264a-11ea-80b6-ff1dde199e64.png)
* apply the changes to the database
* fill in a value into the link template, submit the ticket
* now check the links value being generated (some variables are not working and will instead provide `-`)

You can also check several variables at once (or one each time).


Yes I'm sure this is a bug and no feature request or a general question.


*Original text (for history reasons)*
I can't reference some variables in linked objects.
For example if I try to call #{ticket.number} ort  #{ticket.created_by.lastname} within a link-template of a custom object, I get an empty response.
