Small fix for the mediacontrollers, these "Commands" need to be enabled before they will work.
Issue: Song in playlist is automatically skipped with alert "skipping unavailable video."

Version: 1.0.6 on Mojave 10.14.6.

Reproduce: play Killing in the Name by Rage Against the Machine on desktop, should auto-skip it. Try it on mobile YT Music and mobile will respond with notification that content may be potentially offensive to some audiences and offers the option to continue or skip.

The official webapp (music.youtube.com) now supports seamless playback. However, it looks like that functionality is somehow being suppressed when using the YT Music port. Is it possible to get that working?
I love the app! The media control buttons for next/previous aren't functioning though. Play/Pause works, however.
Hi, love the app really makes using YT Music much more enjoyable! Is it possible for some Menu Bar controls to be added, something similar to SpotMenu (https://github.com/kmikiy/SpotMenu)?
Most of the times I receive a call or I enter into a Google Hangouts meeting the music starts playing.
One should be able to zoom in/ zoom out the player, like in browser or various other apps

P.S.
[Pause] button works fine
Song doesn't start and switches to the next
I'm putting this out there in case it's doable, but that's definitely a "nice to have" feature rather than a "must have" one.

*Context:*
I like to mark songs with "like" or "dislike" or add them to a playlist when discovering new songs. But obviously, I'm not gonna do that at the beginning of a song.

*Feature description:*
About 15 seconds before the end of a song, a notification would remind us the name of the song that's finishing with buttons to:
- like it (closes the notif, registers the like, but doesn't focus on YT Music app)
- add to playlist (closes the notif, focuses on YT Music app)
(dislike button doesn't make sense, since we'd click it sometimes during the song to skip it)
When the song ends:
- if Mac OS allows to edit and ongoing notification content, then put the new song without buttons
- if not, discard notif and show notif of new song (as is today)

*Design:*
If notifications allow for GIFs, loaders or anything of the sort, then we could indicate how long until the song changes.

*Doability:*
- Is there a listener or another way that would allow us to know when we're at 'x' seconds from the end ?
- I know Mac notifications allow for at least two buttons, with one having a context menu. Not sure if we could add the last 2-3 playlists in that menu.
