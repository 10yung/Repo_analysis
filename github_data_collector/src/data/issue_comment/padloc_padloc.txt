What is the purpose of only allowing certain fields to be maskable? As a user I would like to be able to mask any field type I want. 

In a previous issue I mentioned 2FA-recovery codes, which I am storing in a note. I would like them to be masked. It would be acceptable for me if I could just use the password field for this, but the password field is not multiline, so it doesn't work.

Another benefit of being able to mask any field type is that I can have Padloc open when someone is looking over my shoulder, or when I'm sharing my screen without having to worry about accidentally exposing any kind of sensitive information.

Please consider giving the user the ability to mask any field type.
Good news! We've started working on the browser extension and will have something to show very soon! In the meantime, we'd love to get some feedback about what features you'd like to see, how the optimal auto-fill flow would look like for you etc. So we'd really appreciate if you could take a moment and answer the following questions (just reply to this issue):

1. Have you used other password manager browser extensions before? If yes, ...
    a) which?
    b) How reliable was the auto-fill in general?
    c) Where there any instances where the auto-fill did **not** work as expected / intended?
    d) Anything specific you really liked?
    e) Anything specific that bothered you?
    f) Did you encounter any performance issues?
2. What features would you like the Padloc extension to have? (assign a priority rating between 1 and 10)
3. Do you have any specific security-related concerns?
4. Rate the following aspects in terms of priority (1 - 10)
    a) convenience
    b) security
    c) performance
5. Anything else you'd like to add?
    
    
When creating a new item, filling all fields, and saving, the desktop (Mac OS) saves the item with all fields empty. 

This doesn't happen all the time. It happens often (probably 40% of the time) and I haven't been able to identify any pattern on why/when this happens.

<img width="494" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-09 at 8 30 33 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27868414/72071786-98f94400-32ba-11ea-9c7d-cb93a1e941c6.png">

Current behavior:
- User is in Vault X
- User creates New Item 1
- New Item 1 is placed in "My Vault" by default (user can change that when creating the item, but if doing it quickly, they will likely overlook this)

What I think should be a better behavior:
- User is in Vault X
- User creates New Item 1
- New Item 1 is placed in "Vault X" by default (user can change it if needed when creating the item)
Would it be possible to have an LDAP / Active Directory integration for Teams ?

Some ideas as a brainstorm :
- Login with LDAP username / passwords
- Filters for login
- Attribute mapping when a custom LDAP server is used.
- Group synchronization with tags (RO / RW)
- Group synchronization with vaults (RO / RW)
- Group synchronization with organization admin role

This approach would be compatible with RBAC as well.
I know you've confirmed with me off-list that the newer Padloc will have hosting instructions and instructions on how to build the mobile apps for using these custom instances (since the newer apps won't support custom instance for syncing anymore) added to their repositories.

I'm opening this bug to track the efforts for these tasks, since as much as I love the new service(s) (and am I beta user myself) I won't use a centralized, managed service to sync my passwords. 

Padlock, in the past, has been a phenomenal tool for managing my passwords and secrets efficiently and I would love for Padloc to carry on this legacy.

PS: Obviously, I'd rather love to have the official apps support custom servers, but right now there isn't any other choice I'm afraid
It would be very helpful to have an option of "All Vaults" when creating an encrypted backup of your vaults. 
Currently the app expects various scripts and assets to be located under the root path within the pwa host url. This leads to problem is the app ist hosted on a subpath (e.g. `https://myserver.com/padloc/`. We'll probably need another environment variable to allow customizing this. Relevant lines:

https://github.com/padloc/padloc/blob/master/packages/pwa/webpack.config.js#L18
Both major mobile Operating Systems now support an API to integrate third party authentication providers for logins within the confines of the OS, like apps and browsers.

I haven't looked at the Padloc mobile app code yet, but this is very likely a cordova plugin requirement. A quick google of that did not show any results. So this feature request might be blocked until that is available.
