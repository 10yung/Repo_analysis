I'd like to motion to archive this repo. Seems like the perfect candidate since it has a successor org and is no longer maintained. 

Would love your thoughts! 
1)I'm using Angularjs 1 and crossfilter is working fine on controller load in all browsers but not on controller parameters change.
2)it is showing "Aw. snap" at ndx.groupAll on chome Version 66.0.3359.117 (Official Build) (64-bit) and higher while working fine with safari and firefox.
 
HI, i am a good fan of crossfilter but i have one very little problem u could help me with.
It is in filtering charts and the "foreach function"..i like the way u explained the filtering and grouping for the data tables but how can i do the same for the charts especially with dc.js charts.
Thanks
I would like to know if this format is compatible with the crossfilter: 
`{"timestamp": ["2013-11-01 00:00:00", "2013-11-01 01:00:00", "2013-11-01 02:00:00", *...], "V1": [24, 24.7, 24.2, *... ],  "V2": [511.32, 509.7, 507.3, ...], "V3": [26.1, 26.1, 26.2, *... ]}`
 *... -> it continues (larger data)

If I send my data in this way I'm able to send more values in compact way instead to use:
`{{"timestamp": "2013-06-01,'V1': 25.5, 'V2': 52.6 }, {"timestamp": "2013-06-02,'V1': 25.5, 'V2': 52.6 }} , etc`

Could you suggest me something about? (by he way in the first format, the data is order by time)

Thanks,
Roberto
