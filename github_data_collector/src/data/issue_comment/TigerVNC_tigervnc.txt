Underscore key does not work properly in macOS Japanese keyboard. This patch fixes the problem.
I am testing TigerVNC (latest 64-bit version) between two Windows 10 Enterprise 64-bit installations in a domain.  The product installs successfully on both machines but I cannot successfully remote from either one to the other.

I found that the installer does NOT create any Windows Firewall rules.  I manually added an inbound rule for the server executable for all profiles, IP's, protocols & ports.  (By the way, why does it not create a Windows Firewall rule automatically?)

The viewer requests the password, which it accepts, but then displays nothing and closes.  No blank screen or anything else.  I have the options set at their defaults, and have defined a password.  I have tried between other PC's but get the exact same result.

Interestingly, I have the same issue with UltraVNC.  However, TightVNC works perfectly with a default install, and it automatically creates the correct Windows Firewall rule.

Any ideas as to why TigerVNC is not working?  I'd really like to be using this version.

Lastly, surely good Windows documentation would not be difficult to create for TigerVNC.  Why isn't there any?

Added new startup argument:
name: ForceScreenRefresh
value: int - seconds
Starts timer that will send screen refresh command, after time in seconds passed.

That can solve problem described in issue 922 and can be useful in other cases.



when using tigervnc viewer 1.10.80 on windows,  i can connect to x11vnc on my freebsd machine fine UNTIL i start using a window manager and such

for example, flux-box and xfe, when i add those, i suddenly cannot connect via VNC, citing a image library mismatch

seriously this vnc has so many problems...

When libvnc.so is used with Xorg to expose a physical display directly, and use MacOSX native screen sharing program to do VNC, I randomly get the following error which resemble https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc/issues/914  with the latest tigervnc (1.10.1).

I especially get this error, when I maximize and move windows. Xorg server version is 1.20.6.
Also IBUS input is very slow. Normal alphabet typing is fast, but as soon as I use any input method like ibus-anthy, ibus-mozc, keyboard input gets also dropped.

**Describe the bug**
Winvnc4 1.10.1 x64 is running as a service but when I try to connect using 1.10.1 x64 client, no window is shown. Telneting to the port works.

If I use the 1.9.0 server running as a service (client still 1.10.1 x64) it works. But if I use launch Winvnc4 1.9.0 server 1.9.0 as Administrator with "-Log *:file:100" I can't connect either and the logs show basically the same error.

My Windows firewall is on. I only use the loopback interface and rely on an SSH tunnel.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Install 1.10.1 x64, register service enable service
ssh into Windows server with port forwarding
open VNCviewer 1.10.1 x64 and connect to forwarded port
(When I tried it with 1.9.0 x64, I just reinstalled over 1.10.1 x64)

**Expected behavior**
Console windows should be displayed

**Screenshots**
none.

**Client (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Windows 10 1909 x64
 - VNC client: TigerVNC
 - VNC client version: 1.10.1
 - Client downloaded from: TigerVNC Github

**Server (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Windows 10 1909 x64
 - VNC server: TigerVNC
 - VNC server version: 1.10.1 (1.9.0 works running as a service, but not running as Admin w/ -Log switch)
 - Server downloaded from: TigerVNC Github
 - Server was started using: system service, and running from cmd prompt

**Additional context**
Log files here. I attempted to change the service to produce the log file by filling in the parameters text box but no log was created in c:\temp, so manually running winvnc4.exe created the log files.

TigerVNC Viewer 64-bit v1.10.1
macOS  Catalina version 10.15.2

I have two monitors. With VNC viewer running on one of the monitors in full-screen mode and taking system keys directly to server.

When my mouse goes to the other monitor without VNC, the mouse clip works there just instantaneously, but the focus remains at the VNC viewer, as any keyboard input will be directed into the VNC viewer.

In another thread below, a similar issue (on ubuntu but not mentioned on macOS) was resolved. But I'm still having the issue with v1.10.1.

- Updated deprecated macOS key event types
- Addressed compilation issues with clang 11
**Describe the bug**
When I try to connect to a vnc server using the same commands that work on a different installation, I get the following error:

``` CConnection: Server supports RFB protocol version 3.8
 CConnection: Using RFB protocol version 3.8
 CConnection: Choosing security type None(1)
 CConn:       Using pixel format depth 24 (32bpp) little-endian rgb888
 CConn:       Exception on worker thread: End of stream
```
When this happens, a vnc window opens and then disappears immediately

**To Reproduce**
1. open an ssh session to my jump server with port forwarding
```ssh -A -oPort=12344 user@host -L 5908:localhost:5905```
2. Open the connection to the server I am VNCing from:
```ssh user2@host2 -L 5905:localhost:5900```
3. From a new tab:
```vncviewer :5908```

from VNC log:
```

This issue is only happening on an installation of Clear Linux with KDE desktop. The same commands work as expected under Xubuntu/


**Expected behavior**
Opening a VNC window and it staying open


**Client (please complete the following information):**
 - Clear Linux
 - TigerVNC
 - 1.10.0
 - Client downloaded from: Clear Linux

**Server (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: [e.g. Windows 8.1]
 - VNC server: [e.g. TigerVNC, or UltraVNC]
 - VNC server version: [e.g. 1.8.0]
 - Server downloaded from: [e.g. my Linux distribution]
 - Server was started using: [e.g. `vncserver`]

Good day. 
I encountered bug using vncviewer under centos 7.7.1908.
vncviewer version is 1.10.0-4.el7.x86_64

Test case is:
1) Start script
while true 
do 
	vncviewer -passwd 7.vnc -AlertOnFatalError=0 -ViewOnly *WINDOWS PC ADDRES"
	sleep 1
done

2) Connect to windows machine with vncserver
3) Reboot windows machine
4) VncViewer will restart and reconnect, you will see windows shutting down screen.
5) After that vnc will wait forever for mouse or keyboard event, and don`t disconnect from server that closed connection.


gdb backtrace:
(gdb) bt
#0  0x00007f6eabd3cbd3 in select () from /usr/lib64/libc.so.6
#1  0x00007f6eaea86a56 in fl_wait(double) () from /usr/lib64/libfltk.so.1.3
#2  0x00007f6eaea2786f in Fl::wait(double) () from /usr/lib64/libfltk.so.1.3
#3  0x000000000042f056 in run_mainloop() ()
#4  0x000000000041fc25 in main ()


I think, main problem is that network events processed only after keyboard or mouse events acquired. 
Because without -ViewOnly flag, vncviewer works properly.
