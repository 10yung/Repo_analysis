https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/07/nic76#dark-mode Standard is now made available in nearly all major browsers.
There are a couple of changes made here.

1. I fixed the layout of the HTML to be much more clean.

2. I added a class called control-section and encapsulated all of the control sections inside of a div with this class.

3. I made the text inputs display: block. I also set a width so that they would be uniform. Added a border radius and a little padding for aesthetic.

4. I gave the control-sections some padding and margin, along with a bottom border so that they would be easier to see the separation.
How can I solve this issue? Please help, thanks!
Trying to see the sw in action . According to instructions
npm run builld
npm run precache  - not exists in package.json ?

added 144-x image which is required fot install prompt.
How can i access this web from other device?
This project is using sw-precache instead of the latest `@angular/service-worker` and `ng-pwa-tools`.

At Google I/O last week, they announced that https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox would be the preferred option over sw-precache going forward.

However, Angular seems to be creating a better integrated SW and PWA story using the tools mentioned above. That said, it would be interesting to see if these tools actually reduce the size of the config and improve performance or load time.
With Firebase, leveraging [h2 push](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2016/09/http2-comes-to-firebase-hosting.html) seems straightforward which is awesome. Tried this quite some time ago but didn't notice any particular wins, however I do think it's something worth exploring again.

[AggressiveSplittingPlugin](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-http-2-7083ec3f3ce6), although experimental, seems to be a viable solution to output multiple smaller chunks that can be pushed from the server. However, spent a bit of time trying to include it and it doesn't output the generated chunks to the html due to an [issue](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/issues/446) with `HTMLWebpackPugin`. Definitely something to keep an eye on when this gets resolved.

Open to all kinds of suggestions and tips!
Hello, thanks for your tutorial and project.
I tried to create the prod version with
`ng build --aot --prod --bh ./ #  or variants`
it works when served within a http server but it doesn't when it's called as "file://..."
while the basic angular/cli works generating the "app works!" trivial example.
I have to create a demo, static only, angular2 cli generated dist to be called as "file://" and I tried with your project. I suppose it is just a question of using the right commands 'cause it should not be necessary to have a real webserver, even for the html5 internal routing.
Am I wrong? What is the sequence of shell commands to get, in dist folder, a working version that can be called in the browser as "file://<absolute_path>/dist/index.html"? Thank you for your time.
