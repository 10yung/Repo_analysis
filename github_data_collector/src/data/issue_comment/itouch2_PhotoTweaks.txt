it would be great if we add two new option along with zoom
1. Brightness
2. contrast 
version 1.0.3

Lets say image size is 2448x3264, and do the crop on screen of the the width as 1224x3264, but the final output image size is 2448x6157, this is a bug?
 

I want to use this library in swift, How can i use this?

I want such options and not want to let user change CropView's frame by touching. Can you show me some way? or At least few hints about how to approach
If trying to rotate 90 degrees to a landscape view from a portrait view it appears the limits of the window are based on the dimensions of the portrait view. Might I suggest adding either a button to rotate the image 90 degrees below the reset button or using some variant of sin((angle+M_PI_2+M_PI_4)*2)<0 to change the bounds to map height to width and width to height in those scenarios 


Firstly, thanks your fantastic works.
 I checked codes and can not understand `checkScrollViewContentOffset` did clearly. When I commented those invocations simply, it seems that no weird actions occur.
Could you explain the related codes?

sample code does not work.. and crop view controller does not fit in the pop over

The PhotoTweaksViewController does not handle orientation changes gracefully, often resulting in misplaced UI components. Could you give me some advice about handling orientation changes, or look into it yourself?

Thanks for this great component!
