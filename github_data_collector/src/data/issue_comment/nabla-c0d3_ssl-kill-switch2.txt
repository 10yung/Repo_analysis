 Not working with Unc0ver v3.8.0~b1 iOS 12.4.1 A12 (iphonexs max)

crash all apps
I successfully loaded the signed framework into the cloudd process, returned a non-null pointer, so success.
But SSL pinning is still active. Either the method the process uses isn't hooked, the hooking doesn't work. I verified that the framework launch code is being executed
I seen multiple Apps - for example ExpressVPN using FABCertificatePinner, which can't be bypassed by ssl-kill-switch2 yet
> The crash people are seeing is due to Substitute (the library that Chimera uses for hooking C functions) not supporting functions that are very short. I think if there's less than ~60 bytes of stack space available after the function prologue, Substitute will cause a crash.

> Alternatives:
> * Wait for Chimera to switch to a better hooking solution.
> * Make Chimera use the hacky version of MobileSubstrate that unc0ver uses.
> * Use an in-house function interposing technique that supports short functions. This technique works on functions as long as they're 5+ bytes: https://github.com/thomasfinch/CRuntimeFunctionHooker/blob/master/inject.c#L52

I'm getting this error: `not valid for use in process using Library Validation: mapped file has no Team ID and is not a platform binary (signed with custom identity or adhoc?)`

Full Error:

```

I'm trying to view the requests to/from the App Store. I codesigned using: `codesign -f --deep -s "Self-signed Applications" build/Release/SSLKillSwitch.framework`

I tried both using the Dylib method and lldb and got the same error.

I have SIP disabled and I even copied the binary from /Applications to ~/Desktop.

Hi,
I'm trying to decrypt the SSL traffic of Apple's Home App (official homekit app). After installing the newest SSL-Kill-Swich2, I thought I killed related process (e.g. ,  apsd, homed), but it didn't work. I still got the Handshake failed error: the client may not trust proxy's certificate for courier.push.apple.com. 
Could anyone provide any ideas on this issue? Can ssl-kill hook Apple's push service? 
Thanks!
Just jailbroken on iOS 12.0.1 but when activated, all applications [apart from settings] crash. Would really like for this to work as I've followed all the instructions and am not sure as to why this is happening.

- iPhone XS Max [iOS 12.0.1]
I follow the README OS X usage, and everything seems right, but it still does't work...
Is it not support macOS Mojave?
