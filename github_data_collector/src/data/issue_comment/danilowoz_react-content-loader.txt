- [x] Update key name of `primaryColor` and `secondaryColor` for something more meaningful, maybe `backgroundColor` and `foregroundColor`;
- [x] Revisit `width`/`height` keys and if it really necessary to apply on `viewBox` attr its values;
- [x] When `viewBox` is set up, the svg is truncated, see #173;
- [x] Check aria-* is used right;
- [x] Rename the key name of `uniquekey` for something more meaningful, maybe `id`, or `loadingId`;
- [x] Remove uncessary keys: `preserveAspectRatio`, `className`...
- [x] Name the export of the main component (SVG);
- [ ] Reduce bundle as much as it possible;
- [x] Update test (aria);

## What did you do? 

I followed the provided examples

`import ContentLoader, { Facebook } from 'react-content-loader/native'
function HomeScreen() {
  return <ContentLoader />;
}
`

## What did you expect to happen?
On iOs, everything is working fine. I expected the same on Android.

## What happened actually?
On Android, the app simply crashes when it renders one of the `react-content-loader` component.

As shown in the above image the [home page](http://danilowoz.com/create-content-loader/)'s cpu usage is always more than 40% and also more 20% in my app. I think this is abnormal, please confirm whether it is a bug or the normal phenomenonï¼Ÿ
