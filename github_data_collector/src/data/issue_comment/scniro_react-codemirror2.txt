Updating the code in the editor by updating the variable the code is stored in clears the editor history (no ctrl+z :cry: ).

```
cursor={{
          line: activeLine,
          ch: 1
        }}
```

Is this intended? Once the component mounts, the line property seems like it can't be changed.

*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

We know Editor's onCursorActivity could be set like this:
```
<CodeMirror
          value={script.code} 
          onCursorActivity = {this.xxxx}
        />
```
How about the Editor.Doc
Hello.
I am a Web Developer from Japan.    
Thank you very much for making the module `react-codemirror2`.

When I try to convert Japanese using IME, characters are entered into the editor without permission after a few seconds.

```js
import {UnControlled as Codemirror} from 'react-codemirror2';
import NoSSR from 'react-no-ssr';


handleChange(value) {
    if (this._subscription) {
      this._editorContent$.onNext(value);
    }
  }

  render() {
    const { executeChallenge, content, height, mode } = this.props;
    const style = {};
    return (
      <div
        className='challenges-editor'
        style={ style }
        >
        <NoSSR>
          <Codemirror
            value={ content }
            options={ this.createOptions({ executeChallenge, mode, options }) }
            autoCursor={false}
            onChange={(editor, data, value)=> {
              this.handleChange(value);
            }}
          />
        </NoSSR>
      </div>
    );
  }
```
The following URL is the problem we are facing.

Also, this bug does not occur at the end of the editor.

Is there any solution?

こんにちは。
私は日本のエンジニアです。
モジュールを作ってくれて本当にありがとうございます。

IMEを使用して日本語を変換しようとすると、数秒後に文字が勝手にエディターに入力されてしまいます。

以下のURLは私達が直面している問題です。    
https://gyazo.com/72fbaa830c23850048eff57859ac8383

また、エディターの末尾ではこのバグは起きません。

解決策はありますでしょうか？
Hello!  I'm trying to see what changes come with 6.0, but it's not included in `CHANGELOG.md`.  Any chance of updating that for clarity?  Thanks!
Hi there,

is there a way to insert a string at the current cursor position?

So I have a toolbar (a component) and there I have some buttons prepared for the user to add some pre-defined commands (like bold, underline, etc.) when clicking on each of them, a different type of strings should be inserted into the editor, where the cursor is set. how is this achievable with current configurations? is there any workaround?

many thanks
Hi @scniro, I need to invoke a method (registerHelper) on the codemirror object encapsulated in the React component. This PR exports the cm instance to make this possible.
