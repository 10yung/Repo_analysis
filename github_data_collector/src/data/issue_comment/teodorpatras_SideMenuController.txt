Hi Team,
I found you support only Swift 3. When i use XCode 11.2 and change the target to Swift 5, i am getting lots of errors. Kindly let me know do you have any plan on Swift upgrade.
I am facing this crash in Xcode 11 and iOS 13

*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'App called -statusBar or -statusBarWindow on UIApplication: this code must be changed as there's no longer a status bar or status bar window. Use the statusBarManager object on the window scene instead.'

Please help me out if anyone can?
status bar and status bar window have been deprecated. Need to use statusBarManager. PLease  can you update the library so it works with Xcode11?
Carthage update build failed for swift 5
I'm having the following issue when testing with iPhone X

I tried to push side menu controller using below code, controller is pushed but no navigation bar of side menu controller, Here app is showing main navigation bar with previous controller tile on back button. 

**Note:**  In my app SideMenu Controller is not initial controller.

Here "MYSideMenuViewController" is subclass of SideMenuController.  SideMenuViewController is subclass of UIViewController act as a right side menu in my case.
EvaluationViewController is subclass of UIViewController and act as center view.

	let sideMenuController = MYSideMenuViewController()
	let sideMenuVC = SideMenuViewController.instantiate()
	let evaluationViewController = EvaluationViewController.instantiate()
	let navigationVC = UINavigationController(rootViewController: evaluationViewController)
	sideMenuController.embed(sideViewController: sideMenuVC)
	sideMenuController.embed(centerViewController: navigationVC)
	navigationController?.pushViewController(sideMenuController, animated: true)


Please help to fix this issue.

- Fixes bugs related to Swift 4.2

centerPanelOverlayColor does not seems to work with underCenterPanelLeft. Could we add this feature?
