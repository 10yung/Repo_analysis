### Summary
Hi ! We have recently integrated Mattermost in the [SystemA's plAtform](https://systema.earth) and mattermost's accounts are automatically created (via the API) when participants register to the plAtform.
The plAtform allows 255 characters password that can contain any characters.
But Mattermost limits them to 64 characters and even if all password's limitations are unchecked in the System Console, passwords like `"aahh47a૱┯┰┱┲❗►◄ĂăǕǖꞀ¤Ð¢℥Ω℧Kℶℷℸⅇ⅊⚌⚍⚎⚏⚭⚮⌀⏑⏒⏓⏔⏕⏖⏗⏘⏙⏠"` don't work, the api raises this error : `Your password must contain at least 10 characters.`

#### Consequence
When a participant give a password that is not allowed by the Mattermost server, it's account on the plAtform is created but he cannot authenticate to the discussion space cause its Mattermost account was'nt created.

#### Steps to reproduce
- Uncheck all passwords' limitations in the System Console.
- Try to create an user with `password = "aahh47a૱┯┰┱┲❗►◄ĂăǕǖꞀ¤Ð¢℥Ω℧Kℶℷℸⅇ⅊⚌⚍⚎⚏⚭⚮⌀⏑⏒⏓⏔⏕⏖⏗⏘⏙⏠"`

#### Question
I know that the 64 characters' limitation is due to the blowfish 72 characters' limitation. (https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues/9972)
I know that if this limitation was raised, user that gave a 100 characters password could authenticate with the 72 first characters of its password  only.
But it will also work if he type its 100 characters' password.
**So I would like to know if it is possible to override the 64 characters limitation and to know which special characters are allowed by the Mattermost server (maybe there is a regex ?).**

Thanks for your help :)

Lilian.
#### Summary
Makes the Guest Accounts flag not required to use the feature, fixing https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/pull/13231

#### Ticket Link
https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-16798
When providing a multi-line payload to a slash command, it’s currently necessary to add a space character immediately after the trigger word (e.g. `/standup \n<payload>`) instead of being able to start the newline right away (e.g. `/standup\n<payload>`).

Fix this in [ExecuteCommand](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/blob/b71a6b9f8dafc17a5c3d5b0772c67c989f839a3a/app/command.go#L158) by splitting /once/ on any whitespace character, and then reassembling safely. Be sure to write good unit tests to prevent regressions!

#### Summary
This is part of the problem of the MM-20345 bug, when you get all the users it was generating an etag based on your view restrictions, but is not enough to decide to not update the data, so we need also all the memberships to all the channels (which is not possible), so I removed the etag completely here.
