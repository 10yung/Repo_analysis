Hello,

Firebase InAppMessaging stopped working. As it was working from one month.
i updated the pod, previously FirebaseInAppMessagingDisplay was 0.13.1 and now it’s 0.15.5

As there isn’t any single line of code for that just followed this steps

https://firebase.google.com/docs/in-app-messaging/get-started?platform=ios 

As i can able to get instance id, previously i can able to test on simulator as well as device

but now i didn’t Please help

it also says in log : *No auto data collection enable setting entry detected.So no FIAM programmatic setting from the app.* *No programmatic or plist setting at FIAM level. Fallback to global Firebase level setting*

what does this log mean?
The Firestore sample has a sign in page but doesn't actually validate if a sign in was successful or not - on a project that's misconfigured and has a bad API request back it will dismiss the sign in view and act as though a user is signed in. This will then later crash the app since it tries to force-unwrap the `currentUser` property on `Auth`.

Hello,

I was wondering if they could help me, I would like to use your test app without [MLVisionFaceModel](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-ios/blob/master/mlvision/Podfile#L11) as directed [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/ios/detect-faces#before-you-begin) but the array of [faces](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-ios/blob/master/mlvision/MLVisionExample/ViewController.swift#L825) is empty when i run whit this configuration. Can you tell me, what did i do wrong?

best regards.
Hello.
I just got a strange bug: when I set the videoOrientation to portrait, I can't use VisionFaceDetector to detect face.

And I try my other efforts:
1. I changed the VisionImage's orientation from rawValue 1 to 8, and it still can't detect any face.
2. Face can be detected when I rotate my iPhone.
3. When I set videoOrientation to LandscapeRight, everything goes right.
4.When I   rotate my sampleBuffer by vImage, everything goes right too.

Did I miss something? Can someone tell me what's wrong about this bug.

Here are my environments:
Firebase (5.20.2)
FirebaseCore (5.4.1)
FirebaseMLVision (0.15.0)
FirebaseMLVisionFaceModel (0.15.0)
do not merge
This will hopefully help issues like #843 and also increase our integration testing abilities.
Hello,

So I'm trying to create a dynamic link for my app. I created this project under iOS 13 target so I have the `SceneDelegate` file.

I believe everything is well setted in my firebase console, bundle id, team id, app id, ...

I successfully created the link and no error are detected with `DynamicLinks.performDiagnostics`.
I added the capability and setted the "associated domains" to "applinks:https://mydomain.page.link" (also tried "applinks:mydomain.page.link").

After this process, when I try to open the link from iMessage, i got redirected to the preview page, then when I click on "Open", I got redirected to the App Store, showing me a message that says the app is unavailable (since it's not on store yet). 

I heard the apps created after iOS 13 release don't use the `"application" delegates` but the `"scene" delegates` but I have no idea how to implement it and I'm not even sure that it comes from this part.

Anyone have an idea of what i'm missing ?
Hello team,

I tried the face tracking sample and worked with **headEulerAngleY** value. I realized that the value worked incorrectly. Actually, it took a delayed time (~0.2s, 15 frames) to make the **headEulerAngleY** value to be correct. The other values (face position, headEulerAngleZ) also worked well.

Could you please take a look on this issue?

Regards.
I'm trying to add Firebase to an iMessage app extension.
I created a project in Firebase and added two iOS apps, one for the main app (id: `com.company.app`), and the other for the extension (id: `com.company.app.stickers`).
I followed the guides and added the proper `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to each target.
But when I run the extension I see error this in Xcode output:

> 6.9.0 - [Firebase/Core][I-COR000008] The project's Bundle ID is inconsistent with either the Bundle ID in 'GoogleService-Info.plist', or the Bundle ID in the options if you are using a customized options. To ensure that everything can be configured correctly, you may need to make the Bundle IDs consistent. To continue with this plist file, you may change your app's bundle identifier to 'com.company.app.stickers'. Or you can download a new configuration file that matches your bundle identifier from https://console.firebase.google.com/ and replace the current one.

I made sure the bundle identifier of the extension is actually `com.company.app.stickers`. But the interesting thing is that when I tried to use the main `GoogleService-Info.plist` for the extension target the error disappeared although the bundle id in this plist file is `com.company.app` and the bundle id of the extension target is different!

So, am I doing anything wrong here? Or iOS extensions are not supported?
