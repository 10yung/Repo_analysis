I wanna try to use redmon to monitor redis-cluster metrics but i only could config like what #23 issue does,Is it possible to add redis cluster support?
Any one PLEASE guide me how to get RPM package of REDMON tool as i don't find in google any where.
This package is not available at my repository .
I'm using SideKiq-Cron, which behaves _very_ badly when the DB gets flushed (it no longer sees any cron configuration until the server is restarted), so I'd prefer to disable this feature globally and leave flushing the DB to a more organized ops runbook.

Similarly, I'd like to be able to disable the CLI as well.

Really, all of this would be fairly easily achievable for my needs if I had a way of telling redmon to load an extra stylesheet that I could use to hide the relevant DOM elements.  I'm not concerned from a _security_ perspective -- just a fat-fingers/uninformed-users perspective.
Please let me know that How to install Redmon in cPanel on CentOS 7.4?
Since redis 4 the previously deprecated #connect method has been removed. Redmon should use #new instead.
Hi,

I just installed it with gem, but I've got this after starting with `gem redmon`

What am I missing?

```Redis server v=3.0.6 sha=00000000:0 malloc=jemalloc-3.6.0 bits=64 build=687a2a319020fa42```

Thanks
In the commit https://github.com/redis/redis-rb/commit/895cc3211e335a8fd9ba9322cd311c09eea9621f the Redis library deprecated the `Redis.connect` that this application depends on. Because the Redis dependency doesn't have the version pinned, using the latest version of this application is broken out of the box.

This merge request helps fix that.
When I try to install redmon on my Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS system, it encountered the following error:

Hi,

Could you please help me getting *redmon* up and running ?

I have installed *redmon* like this:
```
tasks:

      - name: "Install redmon (redis)"
        tags:
          - redis
        become: yes
        gem: name="{{ item }}" user_install=no state=latest
        with_items:
          - redmon
        environment:
          http_proxy: "{{ prx.http }}"
          https_proxy: "{{ prx.https }}"

      - name: "Update Ruby gems (redis)"
        tags:
          - redis
        become: yes
        command: gem update --system
        environment:
          http_proxy: "{{ prx.http }}"
          https_proxy: "{{ prx.https }}"
```

But when I try to connect to local redis instance, I am getting the following error:
