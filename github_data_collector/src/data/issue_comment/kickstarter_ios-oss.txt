# 📲 What
- Fix a bug on the BackerDashBoardViewController where the list wasn't being refreshed after watching/unwatching a project on iOS 13.

# 🤔 Why
- Because bugs are no good. [JIRA ticket](https://kickstarter.atlassian.net/browse/NT-795)

# 🛠 How
- On iOS 13, the `viewWillAppear` is no longer being called due changes made on the default modal presentation. So to be notified that the list and starred projects count should refresh, the existing `.ksr_projectSaved` notification is used.
- The notification is posted only if, after tapping the save button, the project was successfully updated on the server side.

# ✅ Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Using a iOS 13 device/simulator, go to Profile and tap the `Saved` button to see a list of saved projects. Select on project and tap the heart icon to "unwatch" the project. Dismiss the viewController. The project should be removed from the list and the saved projects count should be updated.

# ♿️ Accessibility 

- [ ] Tap targets use minimum of 44x44 pts dimensions
- [ ] Works with VoiceOver
- [ ] Supports Dynamic Type 

# ✅ Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Navigate to Setting > Help > Accessibility Statement > The a11y statement view

# ⏰ TODO

- [ ] Add new string from https://github.com/kickstarter/kickstarter/pull/18671


# 📲 What

Updates the variants for the "Back this project" CTA experiment. Previously we only had one experimental variant, called `experimental` which was associated with the "See rewards" copy. Now we have two experimental variants, `variant-1` and `variant-2`, for "See the rewards" and "View the rewards" copy, respectively.

# 🤔 Why

For our first Optimizely experiment we want to test two versions of updated copy instead of one.

# 🛠 How

- Updated the `Variant` enum and the logic to correspond to the correct copy
- added VM tests
- removed screenshot tests since they're not really covering anything that's not already covered by the general `ProjectPamphletViewController` tests. VM tests to verify the correct copy is displayed are sufficient for this behavior.

# ♿️ Accessibility 

- [x] Tap targets use minimum of 44x44 pts dimensions
- [x] Works with VoiceOver
- [x] Supports Dynamic Type 


# ✅ Acceptance criteria

You can whitelist your device-id on Optimizely by looking for the property `session_device_distinct_id` which is fired with most events.
- [x] Whitelisting your device-id into the `control` group: navigate to any project, you should see "Back this project" as the CTA copy.
- [x] Whitelisting your device-id into the `variant-1` group: navigate to any project, you should see "See the rewards" as the CTA copy.
- [x] Whitelisting your device-id into the `variant-2` group: navigate to any project, you should see "View the rewards" as the CTA copy.

# 📲 What

Removes the deprecated checkout code.

**Note:** This is based off the Xcode 11 branch of #1003.

**Also note:** See TODOs below for some lingering code that needs a little more consideration before removing.

# 🤔 Why

We've rebuilt this flow natively and this code is no longer needed. We thank it and hope that it sparks joy in another code base.

# 🛠 How

- Removed all deprecated checkout files.
- Removed old checkout related Storyboards.
- Did a sweep for functions that are no longer in use and removed those.
- Removed redundant tests that depended on disabled feature flags or experiments.
- Removed v1 endpoints that we aren't using anymore.

# ✅ Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Confirm that all of the deleted code was correctly removed and is no longer needed.
- [ ] Test affected areas of the app for regressions (Project page, Checkout, Manage Pledge, Backing VC, etc).

# ⏰ TODO

- [ ] ~~Remove `BackingViewController` if possible.~~ Unlikely to be possible soon.
- [x] Refactor `FeatureFlagToolsViewModelTests` to not depend on actual Feature flags as we will remove these from time to time.
- [x] Remove native checkout feature flags once our tests don't depend on them.
- [ ] ~~Run [periphery](https://github.com/peripheryapp/periphery) on the code base to be sure I found all of the unused code.~~ Unfortunately there are [issues](https://github.com/peripheryapp/periphery/issues/49) running this with Xcode 11.
- [x] Remove old checkout-related tracking functions.
# 📲 What

"Back a Project" flow event cleanup. Renames some events, adds others, and updates the property groups associated with the events.

# 🤔 Why

More event cleanup work.

# 🛠 How

The following events are now white-listed and flowing into the data lake:

- `Project Page Pledge Button Clicked`: session properties, user properties, project properties // fires when a user taps the "Back this project" button in the non-backed state
- `Select Reward Button Clicked`: session properties, user properties, project properties, pledge properties // fires when the user selects a reward from the rewards carousel
- `Pledge Submit Button Clicked`: session properties, user properties, project properties, pledge properties, checkout properties // fires when the user taps the "Pledge" button (ie. backs a project with a credit card)
- `Checkout Payment Page Viewed`: session properties, user properties, project properties, pledge properties // fires when the user visits the pledge screen

# ✅ Acceptance criteria

- [x] `Project Page Pledge Button Clicked` should fire when you tap "Back this project" on the project page: project properties
- [x]  `Select Reward Button Clicked` should fire when you select a reward in the rewards carousel: project properties, pledge properties
- [x]  `Pledge Submit Button Clicked` should fire when you tap the "Pledge" button on the pledge screen: project properties, pledge properties, checkout properties
- [x] `Checkout Payment Page Viewed` should fire when you navigate to the pledge screen: project properties, pledge properties

# 📲 What

Adds additional custom properties for us to send to Qualtrics.

# 🤔 Why

These additional properties allow us to better-filter our targeting logic for surveys.

# 🛠 How

- Added `distinct_id` to distinctly identify the device.
- Added `user_uid` to be able to de-dupe survey responses if necessary.
- Added `first_app_session` which we set to `0` after the first evaluation of the targeting logic in order to have a way of knowing that the app has been used at least once before prompting the user to complete the survey. 

# ✅ Acceptance criteria

- [ ] This PR should just be code-reviewed, we will test the behaviour with Qualtrics Intercepts separately in an alpha build.
- [x] Testing passed on alpha build.
<!-- This template is **just a guide**, delete any and all parts which you don't need! -->

# 📲 What

In rewards carousel, X in the top bar is in a different location than the project page so we're moving it to the same location as rewards carousel page.

# 🤔 Why

So that transitioning between these screens is smoother.

# ✅ Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `X` buttons in Project Page and Rewards Carousel appears in the same position 

Please kindly add "Sign in with Google Account" option so that we can seamlessly log in kickstarter from all platform.

# 📲 What

Updates the app to compile in Xcode 11 and Swift 5.1 with some caveats:

- The app is currently compiling in Xcode 11 and Swift 5.1 but snapshot tests are failing. We will address this in a separate PR and merge that into this one.
- We can't merge `master` just yet because we first need a Swift 5.1.3 compatible version of the Qualtrics SDK.

# 🤔 Why

We know that we'll need to compile against iOS 13 and Swift 5.1 in the near future and want to get ahead of that requirement from the App Store as well as to keep our codebase up to date and compiling in the latest version of Xcode.

# 🛠 How

- Combed through the code and updated anything that wouldn't compile, mainly:
  - `Double`s that were being inferred as `Int` in many places.
  - Lenses that were causing ambiguities.
- Updated our Formatter tests due to some changes introduced by iOS 13 (will note in the code).

# ✅ Acceptance criteria

For now, this PR addresses everything except the tests in `Kickstarter_Framework`. I expect that it will be a fair bit of work to fix all of the UI and snapshot regressions and will open a separate PR based off this one to address those.

- [ ] KsApi tests pass.
- [ ] Library tests pass.
- [ ] Formatter test changes are 👍 

# ⏰ TODO

- [x] Fix UI regressions and snapshot tests in separate PR which we'll merge into this one.
- [x] Merge https://github.com/kickstarter/Kickstarter-Prelude/pull/96.
- [x] Merge https://github.com/kickstarter/Kickstarter-ReactiveExtensions/pull/81.
