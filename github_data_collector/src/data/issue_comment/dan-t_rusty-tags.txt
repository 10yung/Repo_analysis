Currently if I have a `struct Foo { ... }` and `impl Foo { ... }`, rusty-tags generates two tags for `Foo`, one for the type definition, another one for the impl. Most of the time unless I'm looking for a function I only want type definitions, so a flag for omitting impls would be helpful.
Previously, no tags was created for crate-public declared functions,
like following:

	pub(crate) fn foo(x: u32) { /* body */ }
