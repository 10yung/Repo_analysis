Added a few words on documentation based on #212.
I have followed all guides to setting up lemon bar, including bspwm for dummies, it just doesn't work...

when i type panel in the terminal i get a 
`/home/kronikpillow/.config/panel/panel: line 17: .: panel_colors: file not found`

which is weird bcz

```
[kronikpillow@susanoo panel]$ ls
panel  panel_bar  panel_colors
```
this is my .profile
```
XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config"
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME
PANEL_FIFO=/tmp/panel-fifo
PANEL_HEIGHT=24
PANEL_FONT="-*-fixed-*-*-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"
PANEL_WM_NAME=bspwm_panel
export PANEL_FIFO PANEL_HEIGHT PANEL_FONT PANEL_WM_NAME
export PATH="$PATH:~/.config/panel"
```

what am i doing wrong?

When a string of text is aligned to the right, the second character is deleted for some reason

1. Are application launchers possible in lemonbar;  in other words, integrating a 'docky'-style section in lemonbar?   
2. If so, could the lemonbar launcher icons be of types .svg, .png, etc.?

Having searched on the internet re using .svg/.png style icons over font symbols (e.g. Fontawesome) in lemonbar particularly, the only hints I could find were as follows:-

https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar/pull/96

https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewtopic.php?id=2463

If possible, could sample code for these launchers please be spelled out?  Hopefully, the code would contain a line demonstrating where an .svg/.png file would appear (or even a .desktop file, which contains a reference to a .svg/.png-type icon).

Many thanks in advance!
I'm running a clean Arch install with bspwm.

So I'm really enjoying lemonbar but I can't get font awesome working. I'm using the lemonbar-xft-git version. When I try to do a little test: 

`echo -e "\uf1eb"` in terminal (Urxvt with nerd-fonts-complete "Hack:size=12") it shows the correct glyph (wifi icon). However when I try to echo it into lemonbar: 

`echo -e "\uf1eb" | lemonbar -f "Font Awesome" -f "Hack" -p` I don't see anything. 

I've added all possible font paths in /usr/share/fonts/ to my xorg.conf. 
Is this behaviour expected?
Here is the data I send to the bar. Pay attention to the end `%{r} 00:31:46`.

```
%{l}%{F#FFF} %{B#111111}  4.119/16 GB RAM %{F#000} %{B#1F4B17}⮀⮁%{F#FFF}  Hello! %{F#1F4B17} %{B#111111}⮀⮁%{F#FFF}   %{F#111111} %{B#00000000}⮀⮁%{F#FFF} %{c}%{F#111111} %{B#00000000} ⮃⮂%{F#FFF}%{B#111} %{F#644}17 %{F#644}2 %{F#644}3 %{F#644}14 %{F#FFF}20 %{F#644}18 %{F#644}4 %{F#644}11 %{F#644}10 %{F#111111} %{B#00000000}⮀⮁%{F#FFF} %{r} 00:31:46
```
Result: https://i.imgur.com/sstD0Se.png

But when I want to specify a background on the right part by changing it to `%{r}%{B#497933} 00:31:46`: https://i.imgur.com/9gXb6XQ.png (please ignore slightly different time of day...)
That is, the background of the right part now fills all the gaps between the left, middle and right sections, as if it leaks.

The documentation in README.md and in the manpage does not explain that the contents of the bar is populated via stdin. 

Examples are also missing. Simple example to get one going like these would be helpful:
```sh
while true; do date; done | lemonbar
```

```sh
cat /etc/hostname | lemonbar -p
```
Hello, i just wonder if it's possible to add consistent underline or overline across entire bar (for aesthetic).
because i do want to fill my center section with it which is mostly blank and filled with active window title. it feels weird the underline and overline shrink and grows every time i hover through windows.

it would be nice if my top bar underline could expand and fill the remaining space rather than leaving it blank

P.S. Thank you for this awesome bar. 
Currently lemonbar always makes itself always on top, however that messes up with fullscreen windows since the bar is always above them. _NET_WM_STATE_BELOW looks like what is necessary to force the bar window to the bottom.

And this is not a WM issue. bar is an unmanaged window.
eg `%{l}left %{+uU#ffffffff} %{c} %{-u} center %{r} right` would show `#ffffffff` underline across the left half inbetween 'left' and 'center'.
