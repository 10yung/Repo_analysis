Is it possible for the pre-commit hook to work just upon the committed code instead of the entire file?
This:
```
        NSDateComponents *todayComp = [calendar components:(NSCalendarUnitYear |
                                                            NSCalendarUnitMonth |
                                                            NSCalendarUnitDay |
                                                            NSCalendarUnitWeekday |
                                                            NSCalendarUnitHour |
                                                            NSCalendarUnitMinute |
                                                            NSCalendarUnitSecond)
                                                  fromDate:today];
```
gets formatted into this:
```
        NSDateComponents *todayComp = [calendar components:(NSCalendarUnitYear |
                                                            NSCalendarUnitMonth |
                                                            NSCalendarUnitDay |
                                                            NSCalendarUnitWeekday |
                                                            NSCalendarUnitHour |
                                                            NSCalendarUnitMinute |
                                                            NSCalendarUnitSecond);
                                                  fromDate:today];
```
ex:  /user/hom/works/ç™¾åº¦/xxx.m   cannot be formatted


After run git commit -a, I get this:

> ðŸš¸ Format and stage individual files:
"/Users/aren/Documents/lollypop/spacecommander"/format-objc-file.sh 'lollypop-client-ios/femometer/femometer-client/thermometer/App/BMTAppDelegate.m' && git add 'lollypop-client-ios/femometer/femometer-client/thermometer/App/BMTAppDelegate.m';
ðŸš€Format and stage all affected files:
	 "/Users/aren/Documents/lollypop/spacecommander"/format-objc-files.sh -s
 ðŸ”´  There were formatting issues with this commit, run theðŸ‘† aboveðŸ‘† command to fix.
 ðŸ’”  Commit anyway and skip this check by running git commit --no-verify

It works when run format-objc-file.sh for one file, but nothing happen when run
> "/Users/aren/Documents/lollypop/spacecommander"/format-objc-files.sh -s

Have I missed something?
In this line, we should be using `diff -q` instead. It returns on the first difference, doesn't need to construct a "diff", and is subsequently much faster.

```
difference=$("$DIR"/format-objc-file-dry-run.sh "$file" | diff "$file" - | wc -l)
```

simplify and optimize the script of format-objc-file-dry-run.sh file and format-objc-file.sh fileand format-objc-file.sh file
Can we have a link to the wiki page "All about Mobuild" to setup for pull request?
Space Commander is great, but one downside I found is that I have to manually execute commands from a terminal to fix formatting problems. Even though it tells me which command to run I still need to copy and paste it into the terminal (or type manually).

Is there a less painful way of using Space Commander, e.g. a GUI or Xcode plugin?

Running it as a build step is one option, however, it destroys your undo history inside Xcode: if you hit Build and Xcode reloads your file you can't use undo.


Instead of `--diff-filter=ACM` use `--diff-filter=ACMR`

```
 UIViewController *const modalToDismiss = ^UIViewController *{
            switch (container.presentationStyle) {
                case MQCardOnFileLinkingFlowViewPresentationStyleModal:
                    return self.currentModalViewController;

                case MQCardOnFileLinkingFlowViewPresentationStyleFullScreen:
                    return (self.currentModalViewController != self.fullScreenNavigationController) ? self.fullScreenNavigationController : nil;
            }
}();
```

becomes

```
 UIViewController *const modalToDismiss = ^UIViewController *
        {
            switch (container.presentationStyle) {
                case MQCardOnFileLinkingFlowViewPresentationStyleModal:
                    return self.currentModalViewController;

                case MQCardOnFileLinkingFlowViewPresentationStyleFullScreen:
                    return (self.currentModalViewController != self.fullScreenNavigationController) ? self.fullScreenNavigationController : nil;
            }
        }
        ();
```
