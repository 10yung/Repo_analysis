It would be nice to people that arrive there from google to know that this great project has survived.
Without installing, users receive the following error:

I am using shairport with forked-daapd. The prior changes submitted by ejurgensen were not reliable for me. After starting a couple AirPlay streams, shairport would become unresponsive, and I would have to restart it. I reverted to the prior version of audio_pipe.c and made changes. To achieve the functionality that ejurgensen added, I first open the pipe for reading, opening it for writing, and then close the read fd. I have been using this for a couple weeks with no issues.

This is my first attempt at using git and GitHub, so I apologize if I haven't made this request properly.

This addresses #351 by adding a FIFO for playback position.

This example script will read the metadata FIFO created by Shairport's -M option, and call a script with the read parameters.

Improvement over #365
- By specifying no parameters to the 'create' command, we are asking
  logrotate to create the new log files with with the same permissions
  and ownership of the original file.

I think it would be nice to have a more convenient support for Gentoo. So let me know what you think.

This is mostly a direct copy of the metadata implementation. I'm not a C programmer by trade, so please tell me if I've done something silly.

On FreeBSD, OpenSSL is always there, but no .pc file is installed,
so pkg-config does not report it, and <code>./configure</code> fails.

For some reason, shutting down work fine on Linux.
Anyway seems logical threads are shutdown in the reverse order they are created.
