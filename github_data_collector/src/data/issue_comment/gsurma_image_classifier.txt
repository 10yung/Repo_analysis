I've some trouble to reproduce the trained models from the information in the [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/image-classifier-cats-vs-dogs-with-convolutional-neural-networks-cnns-and-google-colabs-4e9af21ae7a8) and the [readme Usage section](https://github.com/gsurma/image_classifier#usage). The training data is not provided in folders w.r.t. to classification. Probably I missed some info to get it work as well. I'd like to use the model in a github repo as example about how to wrap a trained model into a microservice. In case you have the [fully reproducable `model.h5` file](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#savingloading-whole-models-architecture-weights-optimizer-state) (the final 5th version of the model) flying around somewhere it would be great if you could add it to the repo. Great blog post btw!
