### What does it do?
When using a `Listbox (Single-Select)` type TV one can set the ''Force Selection to List" optional effectively allowing the manager to choose from the list OR enter a custom value.
The same option however was not available for `Listbox (Multi-Select)` type TVs, but this PR enables it.

### Why is it needed?
The need to benefit from both the ability to choose a value from a predefined list AND to enter a custom value if needed is not related to the choice if the given input accepts a single value or more as well, so it is not reasonable to allow such option for the Single variant, but not for the Multi.

Since there was a bug that prevented new values to be added to a `Listbox (Multi-Select)` TV, even if the option was enabled, my assumption that it was not allowed in the first place, because it didn't work anyway. 5729093 fixes that, and c3b4f1d adds a very similar TV Input Option as the one already available for `Listbox (Single-Select)`: the ''Force Selection to List".

## Feature request
It would be useful to have a setting that allows you to create folders with the resource ID in the media source.

It often happens that the source for the TV is one, but resources are many, with an additional ID folder it would be easier to manage resource files.

Many file management components have this default setting. I think it would be useful to have it in the core.

Extracted the "resource preview URL" computation into a dedicated method inside modResource class

### Why is it needed?
Previously we were having duplicate & inconsistent code to generate those preview URLs

### What does it do?
Fix date generation error for resources created by processors

### Why is it needed?
This fix will allow you to use system time() property and create resources like '12.01.2001'
### What does it do?
If a resource has no parent (either by being deleted or hitting an ACL policy - the ) in that the resources parent has been removed but not the main resource, if the main resource is marked as deleted the recycle bin breaks with a 500 error as end() cannot get an object

### Why is it needed?
If a user has access to the recycle bin but not access to all resources (I think) - the recycle bin 500's because we can't always get the parents. This just stops the 500 error

## Bug report
### Summary

The UI/description regarding the "Default Value" for Template Variable's is confusing and creates wrong expectations of its behavior.

### Observed behavior
The value of the input field whose label is "Default Value" is used to set the default_text field for the modTemplateVar object.

When getting the value of a template variable for a resource it return the raw value of the template variable in context of the specified resource.
When no value is found the default_text for the template variable is returned.
 
### Current UI/Description 
The input field for the `default_text` can be found under the "Input Options" tab.

> Here you can edit the input options for the Template Variable, specific to the type of input render that you select.

The input field for `default_text` is labelled as "Default Value", under this field there is also a description/help text:

> The default value will be stored if the user does not specify a value.
