It's better to clearly instruct new users that outgoing messages will cause a 'message' event emit in order to prevent infinitely sending messages

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

Support Moments related methods could make Wechaty be better.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

The API which I design based on the WeChat underlying protocol:

```javascript
  // post text moments
  postText (moment: string): Promise<Moments>

  // post some images with text or one video moments
  postMedia (moment: MomentsMedia[], text?: string): Promise<Moments>

  // post link moments
  postUrlLink (moment: MomentsUrlLink): Promise<Moments>

  // get all or one's moments
  timeline (contact?: Contact, momentsId?: string): Promise<Moments[]>

  // get one's moments detail
  moments (momentsId: string): Promise<Moments>

  // comment or like one's moments
  comments (comments: MomentsComments): Promise<boolean>

  // revoke bot moments
  revokeMoments (momentsId: string): Promise<boolean>

  // revoke bot comments
  revokeComments (momentsId: string): Promise<boolean>

  // revoke bot like
  revokeLike (momentsId: string): Promise<boolean>
```

The model data:

```javascript
Moments {
  comment?: MomentsCommentsDetail[], // for detail
  commentCount: number,
  description: string,
  id: string,
  likeCount: number,
  like?: MomentsLikeDetail[], // for detail
  nickName: string,
  time: number,
  userName: string,
}

MomentsLikeDetail {
  createTime: number,
  nickName: string,
  userName: string,
}

MomentsCommentsDetail {
  createTime: number,
  replyId: number,
  userName: string,
  nickName: string,
  replyNickName: string,
  id: number,
  content: string,
}

MomentsUrlLink {
  contentUrl?: string,
  description?: string,
  title?: string,
}

MomentsMedia {
  thumb: string,
  url: string,
  width?: string,
  height?: string,
  totalSize?: string,
}

MomentsComments {
  toUserName: string,
  comments?: string,
  momentsId: string,
  replyId?: number,
}
```

And I have saw the related issue which @huan created.

```javascript
wechaty.on('moments', ...)
```

Could not supported by underlying protocol, because of they have no Moments stream.

记得puppeteer有一个接口,puppeteer.connect(options), 可以连接到现有的puppeteer上,
wechaty有暴露出puppeteer.connect(options)接口吗,   这样我们就可以开一个puppeteer服务,
wechaty测试开发时连接 puppeteer服务,更好的调试逻辑代码,避免每次都要扫码登录,烦琐调试工作!
        小白一个知识面小, 如有其它好调试的方法, 希望能告知一二,谢谢
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]

We can download image by this method `toFileBox()`, but we can not choice the image quality. Sometime we need compressed image only.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

Maybe we could set a param for `toFileBox()`, just like this way : `toFileBox(compressed: boolean): FileBox`, and the default param value is `true`.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

**Additional context**

If you agree with me, I will create a PR for it.

When I use command: sudo yarn add wechaty-puppet-macpro@next,

wechaty is not only wechat connector, but it also contains a lot of tests, pack and deploy things.

Each time we made a new puppet, we have to reset these things.

If we could publish a wechaty-puppet-template package in the future, maybe it will make us way easier to do a new puppet.....
