I'm new to HTML5Blank and I've started to use the Elementor builder with HTML5Blank which hasn't been a problem. But the problem starts with Woocommerce and Elementor, the catoregies page and the product page is conflicting with some coding or something, as the description of the product is displaying twice along with the related products. And on the catoregies page none of the products are displaying. This isn't an issue when creating the pages in Elementor but when previewing them on the website the problem occurs. 

How do i find out which pages are conflicting or any other idea. Any help would be grateful 
Updated packages.json to use:
- npm 6.10.1
- gulp 4.0.2
- gulp-sass 4.0.2

Fixed gulpfile.js for compatibility with gulp^4.0, in particular using gulp.series() in place of arrays and fs.writeFileSync instead of fs.writeFile. Added also a return signal to modernizr task.

Final npm fixes to correct vulnerabilities.
Hello there,
following the instructions I moved to `themes/mytheme` and when I ran `npm install` the process failed installing node-sass@4.7.2 with this message:
````
Downloading binary from https://github.com/sass/node-sass/releases/download/v4.7.2/darwin-x64-64_binding.node
Cannot download "https://github.com/sass/node-sass/releases/download/v4.7.2/darwin-x64-64_binding.node": 

HTTP error 404 Not Found
````

Running `npm audit fix` solved the issue, but I'm wondering about what was the cause in the first place.
Hello,
 when I assign the "Post Page" option to a particular page, for example a page called "Blog" to publish my posts, in the page "Blog", the menu-header and the footer menu do not appear, and the postsI also publish, 
Someone has an idea of what is happening please, thank you in advance
when running gulp watch 
```

edit: somehow it switched to gulp 4, sorry.
Review list not working. It only shows the comment form but not showing all the lists of comments posted on a specific custom post type page
Hi There! I just started using HTML 5 Blank, and just loving it! But, There's a thing I'm not able to figure out how's gonna be done. I want add custom class for "li" of navbar. Any sort of help would be appreciated.
