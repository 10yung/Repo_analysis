## Description:  

I have added colour temperature and brightness to the Flux switch state attributes.  

mired values are also shown when mode == mired, 
xy values are shown when mode == xy, 
rgb values are shown when mode == rgb.

This is my first contribution to the project so please forgive my first attempts.
