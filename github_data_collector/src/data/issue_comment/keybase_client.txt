It would be nice if Keybase used `https://` instead of `http://` when adding the Keybase repository to a system.
I've no notification sound on incoming chat messages on desktop (Gentoo Linux), while text popup notification works okay.

My friend doesn't have notification sound both on desktop (Ubuntu) and on phone (Android), but do have text notifications on both. (I've notification sound on phone (Android)).

This is very annoying and may become a reason to stop using keybase. :(

* [x] add a checkbox for user consent about "FUSE for macOS" being closed-source
* [x] add the same checkbox for finder integration popup when user clicks the icon when integration is not enabled
* [x] persist "dismiss" action across app restart so banner won't show up in Files tab after app restarts, if user has dismissed it
* [x] hide the finder integration icon on rows and in header if user has dismissed the banner - user can still enable it in Settings if they want
* [x] a few design tweaks for the Files settings tab, including getting rid of the banner there and replace the checkbox with texts and a button
* [ ] automatic uninstall the kext with helper upgrade cc @mmaxim

Also, index filenames separately from contents.  This will let us rename documents without having to re-index their contents.  And tokenize the names by removing the punctuation.

@keybase/react-hackers, this is ready for review. It adds buttons to the “What's new” rows and a Nyctographic hover effect for desktop.

This refactors `indexChild()` a bit to make it easier to update an existing, already-indexed file.  It moves the docID into place for the new block ID, and makes sure it is used while indexing.

Issue: HOTPOT-1491

A user tried to resolve an implicit team by ID when their network was flaky.  They got back an `AppStatusError` with an `APINetError` code. This caused them to fallthrough to the code that treated it like a normal team, which unfortunately set the name of the TLF to the `__keybase_implicit_team__`-style name, which caused a lot of confusion until the next reboot.

We should treat network errors like that as real errors, and only fallthrough for certain kinds of errors.  There's not a proper error type yet for that, so this commit does our best to improve the situation for now.

Previously this just panic'd on an error, which could lead to a smiliar issue to the one that exposed HOTPOT-1553 (fixed in 91e6a458). There's no reason not to handle the error in the normal way.
