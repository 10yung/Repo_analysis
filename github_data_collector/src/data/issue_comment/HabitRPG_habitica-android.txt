**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
People do not find our guild challenges because many only use the app. We have to link them in chat. Putting them into the guild description is a pain to maintain and it looks bad on the browser version.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I want the guild challenges to be listed below the guild description in the guild details view.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
As a workaround we can put the links to the guild description and maintain it when challenges are created, but we have many challenges and they change once a month, so this is a lot of extra work for the guild leader.

**Additional context**
I guess you need to put it to the fragment_guild_detail.xml, but this means in GuildDetailFragment.kt a guildChallengesView has to be added. I saw the ChallengeListFragment.kt, but I don't know if this can be used as a view like the TextView vals. I'm lost on how to implement this in detail and couldn't test it even if I knew how to put it there. Could someone please explain to me what's happening there and how the fragments are used?

Apple requires all iOS apps to support their new sign-in method by april, so we will also have to implement this on Android, so that users who sign up on their apple device can sign in on all their devices. This will depend on the server issue for implementing this.
**Describe the bug**
My reminders across nearly all of my dailies and tasks don't occur at the expected time.

For example, I just received this push notification reminder:
![Screenshot_20200106-112811](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6856899/71843243-49c3d100-3078-11ea-9c22-00d3d7985a3a.png)

However, this notification should come until tonight and as I understand it shouldn't even come on a Monday based on how it's configured. Even so, it certainly shouldn't have come this morning
![Screenshot_20200106-112902](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6856899/71843308-6a8c2680-3078-11ea-8407-7cbd3046bc86.png)

I received this alert last night around 11PM:
![Screenshot_20200106-113415](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6856899/71843392-a0310f80-3078-11ea-9262-f142183daa03.png)

As a final example, I have this alert that I don't think has ever occurred and I certainly did not receive it this morning:
![Screenshot_20200106-113629](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6856899/71843466-d2db0800-3078-11ea-9746-49ce0fbad195.png)

I have many other dailies with reminders that are simply not happening at all or coming at completely random times.

Here are my settings. Frankly, I have no idea what the reminder time in the settings is for, but I've never gotten a reminder for it. Everything in push notifications is enabled:
![Screenshot_20200106-113754](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6856899/71843586-1a619400-3079-11ea-8497-6706fe357167.png)

Update: as I was writing this bug I did get the push notification to check off my to-dos. Except it chat at about 11:45 AM and mine is configured come at 10:30 PM as you can see in the above screenshot:
![Screenshot_20200106-114343](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6856899/71844034-226e0380-307a-11ea-8673-295799df68df.png)


**To Reproduce**
Create a daily. Set a reminder on said daily.

**Expected behavior**
To receive my reminders at the expected time

**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**
 - Device: Pixel XL

Allow people to pull to refresh on the sub page, and request a server check to their subscription status when they perform the action.

Right now if someone cancels their subscription, it will still show as active for up to a few days. Would like to be able to accurately reflect their cancellation faster than that.
**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Get invitation to quest in party
2. In Party view click accept invitation to quest.
3. Nothing happens. When you click again then popup message appears saying that you already joined quest.

**Expected behavior**
You are redirected to party tab / get notification that you successfully joined quest.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**
 - Device: Xiaomi MI 9 SE
 - OS: Android 9
 - App Version: 2.3
 - Habitica Username: @sebastianzie

**Additional context**
In mobile app there are numerous places where accepting/rejecting things do not give any feedback. Reloading existing view will do a thing, or redirecting to somewhere else.

Here is my use case:

I have a "Drink 8 Glasses of Water" in my daily llist and a "Drink a Glass of Water" in my habit list. Every time I drink a glass of water I tap the habit plus. At the end of a day I would check steaks and tick the daily item if I hit the goal.

If the habit widget can show streaks I can see how close I am to my goals without opening the app.

Thanks again for the amazing work!
**Describe the bug**
The "Read More" option is not available anywhere tasks with long descriptions. 

**To Reproduce**
Just create any task with any title and long descriptions. 

**Expected behavior**
Long descriptions should be compressed and displayed completely when the "Read more" option is clicked.

**Screenshots**
- It's the task:

**Describe the bug**
In the web version you only need to spend gems for public challenges, and you can create non public challenges by assigning them to your party. In the Android version, your party does not show up as a choice on the location menu. If you create a party challenge on the web and try to edit it in Android, it lets you but prevents you from saving changes with the message "you need at least one gem to create a public challenge" 

**To Reproduce**
While having 0 gems ...

1. Try to create a party-only challenge on the app
2. Create a party-only challenge via the website
3. Find the challenge in the app and make any edit to it
4. Attempt to save changes


**Expected behavior**
Step 1 above: your party is one of the choices for location
Step 4 above: changes saved successfully

Let users choose how many of an item they want to buy.

-Especially needed for Gems (implement number limit to match how many they have left)
-Adding it to things like food and potions would be nice too
     -Carry over the warning from web when they're buying more than they need
