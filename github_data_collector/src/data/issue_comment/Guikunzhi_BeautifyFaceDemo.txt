When filtering an image, instead of a live stream, I'm getting nil. Any ideas on what could be happening? Here's the code:

```
GPUImagePicture *stillImageSource = [[GPUImagePicture alloc] initWithImage:img];
GPUImageBeautifyFilter * filter = [[GPUImageBeautifyFilter alloc] init];

[stillImageSource addTarget:filter];
[filter useNextFrameForImageCapture];
[stillImageSource processImage];
   
UIImage * result = [filter imageFromCurrentFramebuffer];  // nil
```

I've also tried using [filter imageByFilteringImage:img], but it's the same.
Hi there!
I’m using your filter and it’s amazing!
Do you planning to rewrite your beauty filter with metal?
For compatibility with GPUImage3

有瘦脸效果的滤镜麽?
Hi Guikunzhi,
I got a trouble when dealing with BeautifyFilter. I also posted this issue for BradLarson.

I got a headache with it for a few days. Could you please help me find out the reason for this issue?
Thank you very much.

请问这个有android版本吗
