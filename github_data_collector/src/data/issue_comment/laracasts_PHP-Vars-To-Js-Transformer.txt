Fix for php5.5 support in build test

This solves issue https://github.com/laracasts/PHP-Vars-To-Js-Transformer/issues/110

Queued tasks add the JS code multiple times. The fix keeps track of each js that is to be added with an array with hashes in the `$view` data. If there already is a hash for the js code, skip it. It seems todo the trick.

It's not really a solution to the problem that the queue is adding multiple (unnecessary) listeners, but it is a failsafe.
This way the config file still gets published if ``php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config`` command is used.
In certain cases, a user of this package might need to add one or more HTML attributes to the `<script>` tag outputted in the compiled view file. For example, if CSP headers are set up for the site, you need to add nonces to inline `<script>` tags so that the browser allows them to execute.

This is achieved by adding a new function to the `ViewBinder` and `Transformer` classes: `setHtmlAttributes(array $attributes)`.

If this method is called, the `ViewBinder->bind()` method will include the attributes that were given to the `setHtmlAttributes` function.

For example:
```php
\JavaScript::setHtmlAttributes(['foo' => 'bar']);
\JavaScript::put(['fizz' => 'buzz']);
```
Will result in the following output in the HTML file:
```html
<script foo="bar">
   JS.fizz = "buzz";
</script>
```


Does it support json format like 
`
window.App = {"csrfToken":"TpqYeKgl8ejmbPaSNPBjmpf0lwYjW4TaP1rfpree","user":{"user_id":2,"user_firstname":"Esperanza","user_lastname":"Sasha","user_email":"jewell.mckenzie@example.net","user_created_at":"2018-07-20 14:52:10","user_updated_at":"2018-07-20 14:52:10"},"signedIn":true};
`
PHPStorm complains about passes arguments to a function with no parameters. This is because the `put()` method uses `func_get_args()` to dynamically retrieve args from the caller.

I followed the suggestion on this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14513356/phpdoc-documenting-a-function-with-a-variable-number-of-arguments) and it fixes the issue. I am also using Laravel IDE helper.
For Laravel

This change adds publishable blade template for when there is a need to change <script> tag. Ex: to add CSP nonce

Can i set dynamic value of `bind_js_vars_to_this_view`
In addition to controller-method specific variables, is there an easy way to also specify some variables to use on all pages? This would be used, for example, to pass options from config files to JS frontend apps.
