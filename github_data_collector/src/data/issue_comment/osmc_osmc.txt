Hello, I installed OSMC on a raspberry pi 0w. But my OTG adapter has problems and I had to do all the configuration through the Kore app, through the wifi network registered in the installation process. Now I need to take this device to another home, where it will be used, and I need to put the wifi network there, but I have no keyboard (broken OTG) and would like to take the raspberry with the registered wifi network. Is there any file in the SD Card folders that I can include the information if I access it through my linux computer?
provision for 4.9 card names;
tidied up audio sink names
OSMC for Linux has silently been pulled from OSMC webpage. Will it come back?
@samnazarko - We have a script that monitors new PINN OS releases that runs every day and notifies us of changes.
Are you aware that whenever you make a new OSMC release, we get notified for days that the release date has changed, then it's reverted, then it's updated, then reverted again.

For example, here are the last 3 notifications:

Sunday 10th Nov.
`os.json Release Date Change: OSMC_Pi1 - 2019-10-31 -> 2019-06-21`

Monday 11th November.
`os.json Release Date Change: OSMC_Pi1 - 2019-06-21 -> 2019-10-31`
`os.json Release Date Change: OSMC_Pi2 - 2019-10-31 -> 2019-06-21`

Tuesday 12th November
`os.json Release Date Change: OSMC_Pi2 - 2019-06-21 -> 2019-10-31`

I'm guessing maybe one of your mirrors is not getting updated in a timely manner.
The notifications are not a problem for us, but it does indicate that some of your users might not always be getting the latest release.

I keep getting this even when running as "admin" on my admin account. Help?

Hello to all the team,

And thanks for your work. I am enjoying great moments with **OSCM / RPi / Official Remote Controller**.
That being said, I am facing an issue with the DLNA, more especially witht the "Set as watched" feature. It does not work with DLNA.

Is it normal please ?

I would expect that when I watch an episode, it is being marked as watched, even if it is DLNA.

Regards,
F.
Added humanizing refresh rates for GUI resolution and whitelists. Also added a few new settings. And a little code cleanup.
Hi! Finally installed a2dp-app-osmc. I had to make some changes in order to make it play nicely with my retrosmc/emulationstation/retropie installation besides it. 
I changed the following:

in file:  `/etc/pulse/client.conf` (makes `pactl` work):
> default-server = /var/run/pulse/native

In file `/etc/pulse/daemon.conf` (fixes audio / emulationstation buffer underruns; source: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=185736 ):
> default-fragments = 5
> default-fragment-size-msec = 2

in file `/etc/pulse/system.pa`':
> load-module module-cli-protocol-unix

(This enables the use of `pacmd` command. Example:
```
osmc@osmc:~$ sudo su
root@osmc:/home/osmc# export PULSE_RUNTIME_PATH=/var/run/pulse
root@osmc:/home/osmc# pacmd
Welcome to PulseAudio 10.0! Use "help" for usage information.
>>> ^C
```
However, you're advised against doing this due to security reasons. Just like you're advised against running pulseaudio systemwide.. but this is not really a problem in single-user htpc scenarios)

I also changed the following settings in `/etc/pulse/daemon.conf`:
```
high-priority = yes
nice-level = -11
exit-idle-time = -1
flat-volumes = no
default-sample-rate = 48000
resample-method = speex-float-5
```
default-sample-rate to 48000 as that is default of emulationstation, and changd the resample-method. 


Now I can play audio via bluetooth on osmc and play star wars rogue squadron on my rpi3b+ at the same time; yay! 
k8s complains if these are not available.
