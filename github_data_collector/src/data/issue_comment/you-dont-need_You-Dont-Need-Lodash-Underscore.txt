> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

add new method to achieve _.fromPairs
During the process of dropping lodash for [hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo) project, we have faced serious obstacles when replacing `lodash.assignIn` with native javascript. We have tried the example function from the README but soon run into serious performance regression. After some investigations, it turns out that the `Object.getPrototypeOf()` is the culprit.

After trying `Object.getPrototypeOf()`, `Reflect.getPrototypeOf()` even the deprecated `__proto__`, the performance regression remains. We finally drops `lodash.assignIn` (https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/pull/3969) with a pure javascript alternative without bringing in any performance regression. It proves that `for...in...` is still the fastest way to iterate over the properties of an object.
When immediate is true, the debounced func will never called.
https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#curry

```javascript
// lodash
var abc = function(a, b, c) {
  return [a, b, c];
};
 
var curried = _.curry(abc);
 
curried(1)(2)(3);
// => [1, 2, 3]
 
curried(1, 2)(3);
// => [1, 2, 3]
 
curried(1, 2, 3);
// => [1, 2, 3]
 
// Curried with placeholders.
curried(1)(_, 3)(2);
// => [1, 2, 3]

// non-ready for review native example
const curry = (foo, len = foo.length) => (...args) => {
    if (args.length >= len) {
        return foo(...args);
    }
	const _foo = (foo, ...nextArgs) => foo(...args, ...nextArgs);
	const _len = foo.length - args.length;
	return curry(_foo, _len)
}
const add3 = curry((a,b,c) => a + b + c);
add3(1)(2)(4) // 7
add3(1)(2, 4) // 7
add3(1,2,4) // 7
```

To be discussed:
* placeholders support
* `_.curryRight`

Just seeing if there's interest in adding, issue creation was inspired from:
* https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-Loops
* https://marmelab.com/blog/2018/03/14/functional-programming-1-unit-of-code.html
- `_.isFunction(x)` could be written as `typeof x === 'function'` (https://stackoverflow.com/a/17108198/938297)
- `_.isString(x)` could be written as `typeof x.valueOf() === 'string'` (https://stackoverflow.com/a/58892465/938297)

Would be happy to create 2 PR's for these if this is something you'd like to add.
I think it would be super helpful to have an ESLint rule that checks for `_.chain` usage.  It breaks the mold of the other methods / rules in that it has no direct translation to ES2015, it just goes away; so I can see why it doesn't exist. But it'd still be nice to see where in code it is being used via ESLint, especially since it appears to break tree-shaking with lodash.

- Adding lodash `_.clamp` function native replacement to `README.md`
