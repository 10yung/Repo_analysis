Same as https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire/commit/2523f84f0f0b30030d75c7e95927c20bd68b95e6
You have a hardcoded domain name "lab.com" in the script. You might want to have the user enter it as a parameter., or auto discover it. Perhaps use [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetComputerDomain().Name.ToString() for this (haven't verified it).
Many times after shutdown, the elastic IP is not released. After running 5 times I reach my limit and get "AddressLimitExceeded" on the next run. If I go into the amazon console and manually release them all, I'm good to go.
Greetings!

Saved the helpful blog pages you wrote up for each tool and stuck them in docs/* as a reference for when you have no network connectivity.

Changed the shebang in proxyCannon.py to 

```#!/usr/bin/env python```

that way the script can be run in a virtualenv.

when i start 3 ec2 in my aws , and  i don't know how to do in the next. should i config the proxychains.conf? 
or something else?
fixes a "not a memory leak", sniff() by default stores sniffed packets so we need to tell him to store=0
quickly tested but shouldn't break stuff
I'm trying to deploy this, and run into this error:
