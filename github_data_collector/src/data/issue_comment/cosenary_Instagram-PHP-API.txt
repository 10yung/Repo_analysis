Hello!
I kind of configured to receive a token, but I can’t get user data even in the test phase
fixes #64
Each time i login and try to get user media or serch user it gives error .

```
 +"meta": {#176 ▼
    +"code": 400
    +"error_type": "OAuthAccessTokenException"
    +"error_message": "The access_token provided is invalid."
  }
```

on authenticating i am receiving access token. this is my code,  i think access token which i receive from instagram is not working.

```
$instagram = new Instagram(config('instagram'));
$instagram->setAccessToken(Session::get('token'));
dd($instagram->getUserMedia(Session::get('id'), 10));
```
When i request to sign in with my IG app, it automatically sends the user this weird login:

And this URL is generated: "https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/?force_classic_login=&next=/oauth/authorize%3Fclient_id....."

I've noticed that if i remove the parameter force_classic_login= it takes me to the new branded one:

**## Does someone know how to control it from SDK ? thanks !**

It seems like this repo owner is not maintaining this handy package, can anybody share his repo latest updated package 
Loads of open PRs and loads of forks... This project needs some love. @cosenary , if you don't find time to maintain this package yourself, please ask the community for help maintaining it! I, for one, would be interested in helping.
I was reading the docs and found out that I had to always use `$instagram->getLoginUrl()` before I could do anything as I had to click the link first and thet it would kind of store some cookie for me to use.

But what I am looking for is a way the script can run in an automatic way, in a cron job for example. Is there some way this could be achieved.?

Thank you in advance.
Is there some way I can post an image with this library to instagram?
What can be wrong? 
On android, when I try to log in from my application opened in the Chrome browser, Instagramm app open over chrome authorization window opens and after it a redirect in chrome does not happen? My app stay in this window by instagramm, and i cant save cookie. Device Xiaomi Redmi 4a. Same behavior in xiaomi native browser. In other browsers evrithing is fine.
Added the getMediaShortcode method to support the shortcode Media api call.
