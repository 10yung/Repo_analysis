A minor fix to topo UI. This change alert user when they try to change log level on topology page without providing a logger name.
Currently user can do this and get a 500 Server Error at the bottom which could be confusing.

Currently topology UI page is showing wrong resource request info if the topo is not scheduled.
This PR:
1. Fix the getTopologyPageInfo method to calculate the correct resource map even if they are not populated yet
2. Rename the component-level resource_map related keys in order to prevent name collision of mustache.render. Now even if the client failed to retrieve the data for resources, it will be left blank instead of getting same named value from topology level.

Example: this wc2 topo is not scheduled and the assigned on-heap mem is 0. Now the components are showing the right requested value.

A dimensional metric collects information into multiple sub-categories (dimensions). 
Add an interface `IDimensionalMetric` extending `IMetric` in hope for supporting a better fine-grained metric reporting.
`DimensionalCountMetric` serves as an example for creating and using dimensional metric
[STORM-3566]add serialVersionUID field to class which implement Serializable interface.
[MINOR]complete log info in TransactionalState.java file
This is @dandsager1 's work to create a new page to see all topologies with the min worker uptime on one page.  I've updated the generated thrift.

We've had issues where nodes are bad or there were bugs were some topologies could not launch workers.  This page allows one place to quickly find topologies that may be having issues with nodes, rather than having to go to each topology page individually.

Use HdfsLoginUtil singleton to login to hdfs exactly once for a process.

This will break backwards-compatibility. I didn't find a better way to resolve this. Suggestions are very welcome.
