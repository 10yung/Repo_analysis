**Bug description**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->
My Surface Pro is connected with a normal DELL screen. It works well in the first screen, which is the screen of Surface Pro itself. However, it works quite strange in the second screen, I have gif file to record these behaviours:
![second screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28227509/70873028-915dbc80-1fe6-11ea-8370-dffcb4d42f8d.gif)

The screen layout is shown in the screenshot:

 The first screen:

The second screen:

**To Reproduce**
I think 2 screens with different resolutions and scales will reproduce it.

**Expected behavior**
Expect `mutrin` works well in the second screen.

**Screenshots**
It is shown in the former chapter.

**Details:**
 - Operating System: Windows 10 (10.0.18362.535)
 - Multrin version: 1.1.1
 - Last known working Multrin version:  N/A
 - Scaling (in percentage, if present): 100% and 200%, works well with 200%, but 100%

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I don't like that every time I want to change the Icon of my `multrin` I have to search it in the file explorer.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A list of icons I can choose from and to that I  can add icons

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Open one specific folder I can put my icons into.

**Bug description**

Drag and drop did not respond, how to solve

**To Reproduce**

I dragged the app in and it didn’t work.

Would be nice if I could eventually use this as a tabbed Windows Explorer replacement.

It would have to automatically add apps (in this case explorer.exe) as new tabs.
Checkbox that uses the app icon of the first window that was added.
**Bug description**
Can not show UWP app icon on tab bar correctly.

**To Reproduce**
Open a UWP app and pin it to tab bar and look its icon.

**Expected behavior**
Show the icon correctly.

**Details:**
 - Operating System: Windows 10 19H1 18362.267 x64
 - Multrin version: 0.4.1
 - Last known working Multrin version: None

I would like to have a list from which I can select the window I want to open in multrin because dropping a window into multrin if it is in fullscreen or on another desktop is annoying
Thank you for a great app @sentialx. 
Is it possible to add an option to **minimize to tray** on Windows instead of closing the app when pressing **X**?
