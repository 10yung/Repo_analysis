Can we remove the space the piechart when it is not created ?

Hi,
Thank you for making such a great library for pie charts.
I wanted to know that is it possible to change the radius of the individual elements on the graph using your library. Thanks in advance.

Also casted some layers for clarity.

Incompatible pointer types initializing 'CATextLayer *' with an expression of type 'CALayer \* _Nullable'.

Just need casting to (CATextLayer *) or (SliceLayer *)

Hi,
I don't use the gesture recognition (tapping on the slices, etc.) and I was wondering what is the best solution to disable it?

Shall I modify your code and add a `BOOL` property? And is there something simpler?

If you want I can do a pull request, but I wanted to know your opinion about it before.

Thanks

Now when I need to remove a slice I got a short duration for white before the slice behind the removed slice run to the place. 

So I should make a progress for this issue! :P
