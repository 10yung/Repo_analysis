i just read the #12 , i have the same problem too,but i download the latest kawa,it  still wrong,i think it should be change switch workflow.
Here is the workflow i use kawa now(Russian,Chinese,English):
1: use chinse type something
2: use kawa switch to Russian, wrong ,cant type any Russia character
3:then i need to switch to Chinese,i see kawa auto switch to Russian, it can type Russian.

I observed when want to switch to Russian,first switch to English and then switch to Russian,it worked.
Suggestion:
when switch to another language input,just switch to the english first,then switch to the purpose source input

F13 works like a charm, but next keys simply don't detect beginning from F14. For me it's more preferrable way to assign languages than Cmd+key and similar combos.
I checked in Karabiner and it see these F-keys. What may be wrong?

After upgrading to newer versions of macOS, the old workaround for CJK input methods are not working any more.

I have tried with various of switching input methods, and found that:
1. The "Select next source in input menu" shortcut works reliably.
2. The `TISCopyCurrentKeyboardInputSource` can return currently selected method reliably if there is recent key stroke or window switch.

So I have taken a policy by keep pressing "Select next source in input menu" until target input method has been switched to.

There is a bug in macOS that, if one switches to different input methods in a very short time without doing any typing, the `TISCopyCurrentKeyboardInputSource` will return wrong result. I worked around it by remembering last selected input method, and use it as current input method if user is switching input methods too fast.

Note that I don't really know much about Swift, please refactor the code if necessary.
Could the command line version be provided?

Thanks!
