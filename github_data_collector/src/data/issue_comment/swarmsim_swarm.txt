I just wanted to say thanks for this awesome game. 

Since I discovered it long ago, I never stopped playing it. 
My current game was created **2 years ago** (Sun Sep 18 2016 14:22:25 GMT+0200) and my swarm has infested (only) **10** new worlds so far. (I don't ascend as fast as possible).

Currently, I am working on having the Overmind III's generate enough Overmind II's and right now I have **3.89086e759** meat. I hope this gives a good picture on how much time I put into this.

Played the game for hours just fine, as soon as I close the tab and reopen it a couple of minutes later the page will work for a few seconds before freezing up and ramping up CPU usage. If I stop looking at the tab for a bit it kinda works for another couple of seconds before freezing up again
On Chrome 65 on Linux (Debian and also Ubuntu), after starting a new game and playing it for 8 minutes, swarmsim.github.io becomes unresponsive: several times in a minute the game pauses for 10 seconds, not updating the display, and not reacting to mouse clicks. The CPU usage goes up to 100%.

It's so unresponsive that it's imposible to enjoy the gameplay.

It works fine in Firefox 52 on the same system.
Just submitted a $4.99 purchase for 55,000 crystals, and now I own 110,000 crystals. Maybe this is on purpose, but I figured it was worth pointing out.
After updating from iOS 10.2 to 10.3.1, the app locks after about 2-3 seconds, and interaction in the browser is about 1/10 fps.  I cleared website data, including storage, as well as killed Safari, but the freezing happens the next time I open swarmsim.
* the list is very long late-game. This will make it more readable.
* Updating this list causes lots of lag late game since meat math doesn't scale well. Hiding some of the list doesn't solve this, early units still get slightly slower with each new gen, but it removes one dimension of scaling.

No-unot-selected would have no change. This is just for the sidebar with a unit selected.

I'm thinking of a drop down in the middle of the list, like:

Om6
Om5
More... >
Queen
Drone
Meat

Options menu can disable this change of course. It should probably be on by default, but we need to make it obvious how to turn it off.

Most of these ideas exist already as debugging tools, we'd only need to unlock them - say, at 100% achievements?

There are many reasons not to do this - for example, once we do this, we can't really add new content for players past the "end of the game" today (OM6). I think that's okay, no such content planned anyway. In any case, make the decision while planning the next release.
First step: pick specific achievements to implement

I'm stuck on 1e91 Overmind VI's and still have 9 ascension to go for the 20 ascension achievement.
This game definitely needs more meat generating tiers. Even if it's just Overmind VII, Overmind VIII etc.
