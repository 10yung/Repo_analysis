Let's say each comment around field and definitions is an entity. Is it possible to group those entities in some logical sections?

e.g. group documentation regarding Credentials in 1 sections and other data in another. So they are all not generated always in Queries/Mutations, but

-> Queries -> Credentials section
-> Mutation -> Credentials section

or

-> Credentials:
      -> Queries
      -> Mutations

<h2><strong>Release [2.6.0] - May 4, 2018</strong></h2>
<p>May the 4th be with you!</p>
<h2>Big Impact</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://lightningdesignsystem.com/components/overview">Component Blueprints</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Renamed our 'Components' to 'Component Blueprints' to create distinction between our SLDS Components and (<a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/aura_compref.htm">Lightning Components</a>). We define our 'Component Blueprints' as 'Framework agnostic, accessible HTML and CSS used to create components in conjunction with our implementation guidelines'. For more details, check out the glossary we added to our <a href="https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/blob/master/faq">FAQ page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://lightningdesignsystem.com/components/form-element/#Layout">Form Layout</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Merged Form Layout into Form Element (<a href="https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/commit/f3c5b48">f3c5b48</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://lightningdesignsystem.com/icons/#utility">Icon</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Addressed 2 issues with the usage of <em>Warning</em> and <em>Error</em> icons. (<a href="https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/commit/cd98ab6">cd98ab6</a>)
<ol>
<li>Research showed that the ban icon best represented an error for our users, so we switched the error and ban icons. The new error icon is the circle with a diagonal slash through it</li>
<li>We also realized that we used the same icon for both error and warning states in many components, so we updated components that were using the warning icon in red as an error state to use the new error icon.</li>
</ol>

<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/Trott/node-slug/blob/master/CHANGELOG">slug's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>2.1.0</h2>
<p>Fallback to base64 if slug is empty. This allows minimal out-of-the-box support
for character sets not in the default mappings.</p>
<h2>2.0.0</h2>
<p>Add support for Farsi. (Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/hassan-jahan">@hassan-jahan</a>!)</p>
<p>This is being released as a breaking change because it changes some of
the slugs for Arabic strings. It probably won't break anything, but just
in case....</p>

> # [4.2.2](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v4.2.2)
> 
> - `isMergeableObject` is now only called if there are two values that could be merged.  [a34dd4d2](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/commit/a34dd4d25bf5e250653540a2022bc832c7b00a19)

> 
> - Properties are now only overwritten if they exist on the target object and are enumerable.  [#164](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/pull/164)
> 
> Technically this could probably be a patch release since "which properties get overwritten" wasn't documented and accidentally overwriting a built-in function or some function up the property chain would almost certainly be undesirable, but it feels like a gray area, so here we are with a feature version bump.
> 
> # [4.1.2](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v4.1.2)
> 
> - Rolled back [#167](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/issues/167) since `Object.assign` breaks ES5 support.  [55067352](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/commit/55067352a92c65a6c44a5165f3387720aae1e192)

> 
> # [4.0.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v4.0.0)
> 
> - The `main` entry point in `package.json` is now a CommonJS module instead of a UMD module [#155](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/pull/155)
> 
> # [3.3.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v3.3.0)
