The dark mode should have white color text if using System label color.

But in iOS 13 dark mode, the background is dark, and the input text is still dark.
How do I put screenshot by the way?

Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSGenericException', reason: 'Access to UITextField's _placeholderLabel ivar is prohibited. This is an application bug'
I after iOS 12 update Floating Label Text color is becoming white or it's disappearing which is sporadic.
This block declaration is not a prototype

Block implicitly retains 'self'; explicitly mention 'self' to indicate this is intended behavior

Hi, 

I'm getting an error since I updated to Swift 4.2 last week and am unable to build. Can you look into it. 
Added a background view for floating label  which increase self height when floatingLabelYPadding changed. Because when you have a large text view and large floatingLabelYPadding, when content scrolling text appears under floating label

But now, my xib's display in a clutter, I mean it's all of property seem correctly just same before I replace my xib's UITextField to JVFloatLabeledTextField.
# However, my xib's UI component element display disorderly, but I ensure their auto layout constraints are correct.

UIView(i5M-Pr-Fkt) is my controller's view.

Anyone might help me?
