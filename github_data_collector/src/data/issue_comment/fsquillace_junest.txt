I found nvim, nodejs and some tools would aborted at startup.

For example:
```
$ nvim
Aborted
```

Executing nvim would lead to Aborted instantly.

The OS is CentOS 6.9
```
lsb_release -a
LSB Version: :base-4.0-amd64:base-4.0-noarch:core-4.0-amd64:core-4.0-noarch:graphics-4.0-amd64:graphics-4.0-noarch:printing-4.0-amd64:printing-4.0-noarch
Distributor ID: CentOS
Description: CentOS release 6.9 (Final)
Release: 6.9
Codename: Final
```

The reproduce steps
```
  junest proot -f -b "-k 3.10"
  nvim
  Aborted
```

Is this a known issue? Is there a solution for this?
The reason why `junest -u` is not used as the main backed solution for JuNest is that some Linux distros do not have the linux user namespace enabled by default. It is required to have root privileges in order to enabled it.

Fortunately, in several distros like Ubuntu and Arch Linux it seems they have enabled it by default.

This issue is to report the list of distro which have the namespace enabled by default and decide whether is the right time to have such backend as the primary solution for JuNest and Proot as secondary solution.

Major Distros to look at:

- Ubuntu
- Arch Linux
- Debian
- Fedora
Try to rename a file in junest:

```
$ junest -- bash
/home/me/.junest/opt/junest/lib/core/common.sh: line 95: /usr/bin/getent: Permission denied
/home/me/.junest/opt/junest/lib/core/common.sh: line 95: /usr/bin/getent: Permission denied
/home/me/.junest/opt/junest/lib/core/common.sh: line 95: /usr/bin/getent: Permission denied
$ cd /etc/tor
$ ls
torrc  torrc-dist
$ mv torrc torrc.orig
$ ls -l
total 24
-rw-r--r-- 1 me me  8648 Jun  7 17:08 torrc
-rw-r--r-- 1 me me  11099 Jun  7 17:08 torrc-dist
$ mv torrc torrc.orig
/usr/bin/mv: cannot move 'torrc' to 'torrc.orig': No such file or directory
$ exit
```

Back in the host system:

```
$ ls -l .junest/etc/tor
total 24
-rw-r--r-- 1 me me 8648 Jun  7 17:08 torrc
-rw-r--r-- 1 me me 11099 Jun  7 17:08 torrc-dist
$ mv .junest/etc/tor/torrc .junest/etc/tor/torrc.orig
$ ls -l .junest/etc/tor
total 24
-rw-r--r-- 1 me me 11099 Jun  7 17:08 torrc-dist
-rw-r--r-- 1 me me  8648 Jun  7 17:08 torrc.orig
```
When I run junest (CentOS 6), I am getting:

```
$ junest
/home/dev/.junest/opt/junest/lib/core/common.sh: line 95: /usr/bin/getent: Permission denied
/home/dev/.junest/opt/junest/lib/core/common.sh: line 95: /usr/bin/getent: Permission denied
/home/dev/.junest/opt/junest/lib/core/common.sh: line 95: /usr/bin/getent: Permission denied
```

I don't know if it's related, but I am having trouble ^z'ing out of (at least some) running processes.  If I try emacs, I get

```
$ jobs
[1]+  Stopped(SIGTSTP)        emacs -nw
```

but it doesn't clear the screen properly, writing among the data that was in the emacs buffer.  Then `fg` just comes back with `emacs -nw` and a blank screen.  (Actually, it seems emacs is still there, but the screen is all screwed up and it's not responding to control characters properly.)

[Someone else was also having trouble with ^z](https://github.com/fsquillace/junest/issues/214).

This [work around on the locale issue](https://github.com/fsquillace/junest/issues/161#issuecomment-291731190) solved the ^z problem for me.
Hi!

Recently, I noticed that the default build system provided in your URL seems outdated, in that it gives problems installing packages like vim. This problem was also raised in an issue #219. The problem is rectified when I build my own image using your instructions. I then created my own repo, uploading my own latest system build image so I could use it as needed. I will also be maintaining this repo from time to time.

I thought of somehow possibly including this in your project too, so new users without an existing Arch Linux system (therefore can't build their own system image), or simply to avoid the pain of building one themselves, can now use the images maintained in my repo.

I have updated your README to include this. I have also deleted the section using yaourt to install since yaourt is no longer in use in Arch Linux.

If you are happy with this change, or edit as you see fit, kindly accept the proposed changes.
I have just updated with pacman -Syu and I'm getting lots of random crashes. The first one is in install-info, which runs as part of the pacman command.
I also have a crash in my own c++ program which wasn't happening before. It seems to be memory related, in my code I'm just appending strings in a loop and sometimes it works, sometimes it crashes. If I reserve enough memory for the destination string so that it never needs to reallocate to accomodate for the appended substrings then the crashe disappears completely.

If I downgraded to glibc-2.28-5 all goes back to normal, but I obviously end up with non-working packages, eg vim won't start anymore as it doesn't find the right version of glibc, plus some other system packages.
As soon as I re-install glibc-2.29-1 the crashes are back. Is there a solution for this?
    git clone git://github.com/fsquillace/junest ~/.local/share/junest
    export PATH=~/.local/share/junest/bin:$PATH
    junest -f

I am getting

What does that mean? How can I fix it?

It's a HostEurope Managed Server on Debian 8


It seemed like it was written in docs that proot development is halted.. However, some forks are still in active development, it might be worth looking at code of repos such as termux/proot for potential improvements.

Also, is it possible to provide junest as an app for Android? It seems it can be helpful in terms of project funding, by keeping some addons for small price, say like a donation version, on play store.

As per the title, are opengl programs supposed to work? I'm trying glewinfo and glxgears, they both fail with this message:

libGL error: No matching fbConfigs or visuals found
libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
Error: glewCreateContext failed

Ultimately, I'm trying to run openra.
