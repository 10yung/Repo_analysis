## Bug report

#### Steps to reproduce

1. create a file 'config.styl'
```styl
$textColor = #000000
```

2. edit file '.vuepress/config.js`
```js
{
  stylus: {
    import: ['config.styl']
  }
}
```

#### What is expected?

initialized `$textColor` `#2c3e50` is replaced with `#000000` 

#### What is actually happening?

nothing happens

#### Other relevant information

look up code in file `@vuepress/core/lib/node/internal-plugins/palette/index.js`

```js
10    // 1. enable config.styl globally.
11    const configFile = ctx.getLibFilePath('client/style/config.styl')
12    if (!ctx.siteConfig.stylus) {
13      ctx.siteConfig.stylus = {
14        import: [configFile]
15      }
16    } else if (isPlainObject(ctx.siteConfig.stylus)) {
17      ctx.siteConfig.stylus.import = (ctx.siteConfig.stylus.import || []).concat([configFile])
18    }
```

I propose to amend the 17th lines of code

```js
ctx.siteConfig.stylus.import = [configFile].concat(ctx.siteConfig.stylus.import || [])
```

**Summary**

Let's say I have a file system like this.

```
content
├── api
│   ├── file2.md
│   ├── file3.md
│   ├── graphql
│   │   ├── file2.md
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── README.md
├── biz
│   └── README.md
├── docs
│   ├── README.md
│   └── vuepress.md
└── README.md
```

Then I run `vuepress build content`. 
The compiled js files would be like this.

```
public/assets/js

By this PR, compiled js files would be like this.

```

This has two benefits.

1. This enables route-based access control from reverse proxy. For example, if `/api` route should only be accessed by `admin`, then the proxy can block `/api/*` and `/assets/js/api/*` for others.
2. This is more easy to find compiled output of certain markdown.

#2117 was the original motivation.
The Google Analytics plugin should probably not only be added to the 'devDependencies', but to the 'normal' dependencies.
