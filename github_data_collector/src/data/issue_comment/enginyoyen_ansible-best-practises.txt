Is there a plan to extend this best-practice template to include support for Fedora/CentOS/RHEL distributions (i.e. to those using yum)?

Ideally the extension should work in environments using both Debian (apt) and Fedora (yum) distributions. 
Running ./extensions/setup/role_update.sh
 downloading role 'git', owned by -%20src%3A%20https%3A//github.com/yetu/ansible-apt
Sorry, - src: https://github.com/yetu/ansible-apt.git was not found on galaxy.ansible.com.
 downloading role '4%22', owned by version%3A%20%22v0.1
Sorry, version: "v0.1.4" was not found on galaxy.ansible.com.
 
Can you please suggest?

I am getting below error while executing setup.sh
   compilation terminated.
    error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1
If I ignore this - will the configurations still work?
