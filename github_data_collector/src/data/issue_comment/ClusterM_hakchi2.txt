So, literally when booting games through the menu lets them run for a few seconds with input, then they freeze and I'm back on the system menu with a save state. Only happens on retroarch games when launched through the menu. I am using a phone charger as my usb adapter for the snes if it helps.

So My snes eur haves a problem when i try to uninstal hakchi it refuses.
HELP!


I still have a lot of space 40mb used only, but when i add more games i'm starting to have sound issues on various games and even the menu music can  glitch. I don't know how to describe the problem, it's like small hiccups in the music.
I just unmodded my NES Classic, but after turning it on, it show on screen with out even showing any of the games, "SHUTTING DOWN...". I have no clues what to do, and I even tried re-flashing the old kernel back into the system. For your information I simply for this article on how to unmod(https://nesclassicmods.com/how-to-uninstall-hakchi2-ce-and-factory-reset-nes-classic-mini/ )and I was using hakchi v 2.3
Any time I try to put the games I want on to the NES Mini it shows this can anyone explain it?

I Need Help On The Snes Controller
when I set  --nes-version=pal flag the game is still 60 hz, however the sound gets glitchy. Is there a way to play games in 50hz? (don't ask why lol)
