Hi all,

I'd like to propose the addition of a glossary for certain terms that may be misinterpreted or need additional explanations to be unambiguously interpreted by readers.
This would also require a review of the complete document to ensure the uses of such words are correct according to their glossary definition.
This is particularly important in some specific cases like crypto, where terms are sometimes misused and there can be confusion as to their meaning and the instances of their use across the document could be linked to the definition in the glossary for fast reference.

Here's an example of what glossary entries could look like:

_encoding_ - function which transforms input into a different representation without the use of a key. These are reversible and do not provide real security because if the algorithm is known, their output can be reversed.

_hash_ - may be a reference to a hashing function or its output. 

_hashing/hash function_ - cryptographically-secure function which transforms input into fixed-length output, also known as trapdoor or one-way function. Their output cannot be "reversed", in the sense of retrieving back the input information from the output, because its fixed-length property does not retain the original information, but it can be "guessed" by attempting all possible inputs until we get the same output.

_encryption_ - process by which input data (plaintext) is transformed into encrypted data (ciphertext) via the application of a secret key. The output of an encryption process may be reversed (decrypted) using a key.

_KDF_ (or _Key Derivation Function_) - In this document, when referring to a KDF, we mean a function which takes a user password as input and derives a key which can be used for storage and authentication or a high entropy key for use with symmetric encryption algorithms. This is **not** a hash function, but a construction around a hash function to make it more resistant to attacks such as brute-force, rainbow-tables, etc. A simple example to understand what is meant by construction is [PBKDF2](https://github.com/golang/crypto/blob/master/pbkdf2/pbkdf2.go) which uses salting and iterations to increase the cost of breaking the hash to the attacker.

The crypto section would then be revised to use these terms appropriately.
I want to translate this book into Chinese, It's a pretty good book. 

Hi, this book is useful for gopher to follow the best practice of secure programming. Would you mind I translate this book to Traditional Chinese? I will link to origin repository and follows the license.

thanks
