resetting calendar view on click, in order to cater for any changes within the disabled date ranges

replacing ng-focus with ng-click to fix bug with show/hide when clicking on the directive

_Note:_ This is a re-create of https://github.com/adamalbrecht/ngQuickDate/pull/69 as that fork has been deleted. Also worth noting that **ngQuickDate seems to be failing 8 tests**, but that's already the case on master, not due to these changes.

Adding read-only option: `read-only="true"`

This makes the directive not trigger the popup, preventing the user from selecting a date.

See bottom form, data updates according to the model using $watch, but user cannot manually edit End Date.

ngQuickDate does not work on mobile devices with the current version of Angular 1.x.
The reason is that Angular does not emit an ng-mousedown when the user taps on a calendar entry.
Two new options have been added, both default to false to prevent breaking changes on legacy installations.
isTouchDevice: Allows ngQuickDate to be manually configured to use ng-click instead of ng-mousedown
detectTouchDevices: Detects if touch is available and uses ng-click or ng-mousedown as appropriate.
Updated version number to 1.3.4

Related to #20 this very simple fix updates the calendar available dates when the date picker opens.

Resolves #41 

I added a binding to watch ngDisabled. When disabled is true, the button is grayed-out, the cursor changes to 'not-allowed', and the date picker does not open. It also does not open if the user sets focus by tabbing to the button.

I also updated demo.html to demonstrate the disabled functionality.

Also added a couple of tests.

I need an option to hide weekends. This approach adds an additional CSS class to the main calendar table, and the stylesheet simply hides the applicable cells.

As title.

Adds ok button and deletes 'instantaneously disappearing option'  after user picks Date,
so the user can pick also Time.

Sometimes I need to deal with UTC dates so I updated a little bit:
1. Add `timezone` configuration. Accepted values: `null` or `UTC`
2. Add `timezone` parameter for angular `date` filter to show date in UTC timezone
3. Change date format to ISO 8601 format so that date string will be parsed as UTC timezone (only when the `timezone` configuration is set to `UTC`)
