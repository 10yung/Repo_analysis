I am able to establish a PPP connection with the Sara-R4 modem, but attempts to
create and use a TCP socket connection, supplying an actual IP address to an echo test server always fail with -3004.
Attempting to use a hostname and DNS also fails, although I was successful once or twice by supplying a hostname
but could never reproduce it.

I am able to successfully Connect and transmit to test Servers (broker.hivemq.com or test.mosquitto.org)
using AT socket commands.

This seems to be the same exact problem described here: https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/issues/7464
with similar PPP problems reported for the Sara-R4.

Generally it looks like the recommended 'fix' for this problem has been to send AT&S0 before establishing the PPP 
connection, but I do that, and in fact I don't have any problem establishing the PPP connection, just trying to use it.

I have also tried this with a simpler application (mbed-os-example-cellular-master), modified for my target
with the same results.

Additionally, exiting PPP mode is never successful using the +++ or DTR (via GPIO control) methods described in the Sara-R4 AT command manual
Per the SARA-R4 AT command documentation:
The data session is terminated by one of the following events:
• sending ~+++.
• via a DTR transition from ON to OFF.
• sending an LCP Terminate Request.

My target board uses an MTQN-MNG1-B01, modem firmware as follows:
Manufacturer: u-blox
Model: SARA-R410M-02B
Revision: L0.0.00.00.05.08 [Apr 17 2019 19:34:02]
mbed-os-5.15

### Description of defect

I'm trying to test the LoRaWAN 1.1 feature branch. While the code compiles fine, the LoRaWAN example code (https://os.mbed.com/teams/mbed-os-examples/code/mbed-os-example-lorawan/) prints `Connection error, code = -1014`. I have traced this back to:

https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/feature-lorawan-1-1/features/lorawan/lorastack/mac/LoRaMacCrypto.cpp#L280

Which returns `MBEDTLS_ERR_CIPHER_ALLOC_FAILED`.

I'm following these steps: https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/Introducing-LoRaWAN-11-support/.

When compiling without `"lorawan.version": 10,` set (thus using LoRaWAN 1.0.x), I still see the same error. When switching the `mbed-os` to the `master` branch, the error is gone and the device joins fine.

#### Target(s) affected by this defect ?

I have tested with `DISCO_L072CZ_LRWAN1` and `NUCLEO_L073RZ` (with SX1272 shield) with the same result.

#### Toolchain(s) (name and version) displaying this defect ?

gcc-arm-none-eabi package from Debian Buster (7-2018-q2-6) (https://packages.debian.org/buster/gcc-arm-none-eabi).
`gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2` downloaded from https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads.

#### What version of Mbed-os are you using (tag or sha) ?

master: 4924264769fc8226f764ee6c86443a6d7e6cfcf4 (works fine)
feature-lorawan-1-1: 8bbf43e209b8f2e8a46dd0a8d956b917a2c0345b (results in the error)

#### What version(s) of tools are you using. List all that apply (E.g. mbed-cli)

mbed-cli: 1.10.2

#### How is this defect reproduced ? 

```
mbed import mbed-os-example-lorawan
cd mbed-os-example-lorawan/mbed-os
```

Update `mbed_app.json` to set DevEUI, AppEUI and AppKey.

Compile:

```
mbed compile -m DISCO_L072CZ_LRWAN1 -t GCC_ARM
```

Confirm that device joins fine.

```
cd mbed-os
git checkout feature-lorawan-1-1
cd ..
mbed compile -m DISCO_L072CZ_LRWAN1 -t GCC_ARM
```

At this point I get `Connection error, code = -1014` (caused by `mbedtls_cipher_setup` returning `MBEDTLS_ERR_CIPHER_ALLOC_FAILED`).

It doesn't matter if `"lora.version": 10,` + `"lora.network-key":` are set or not. 
### Summary of changes

This is a fix to the tools for running under Python 3.

This call to `sorted` does nothing in Python 2, as there is no way to sort a list of Exceptions without providing a key. It will simply return the evaluated generator as a list.

In Python 3 this call fails with `TypeError : '<' not supported between instances of 'ValidationError' and 'ValidationError'`, as there is no comparison implemented for the `jsonschema.exceptions.ValidationError Exception`.

This is fixed by providing the key `str`, which sorts by the string representation of
the Exception.

Add mergify bot to all PRs (all branches). The configuration already resides on master but not yet  enabled, only been enabled for feature-mergify to test it.

 Docs: https://doc.mergify.io/

The configuration should follow our workflow. If it does not, we should fix via new pull request anytime (note: one drawback, the config is fetched from the default branch, in our case master. So even rules for non master, need to be in the config there). The auto merge is disabled, the bot does not have write access to any of the branches anyway. This bot can move labels, post comments.

To verify for each PR, use "Checks" where you can review Mergify conditions.

To disable, just revert this comment - to have all rules only on feature-mergify for instance. Hopefully, this won't be necessary and we tune the rules once we get more PRs involved (compare to few testing we did).

### Summary of changes <!-- Required -->

Disable coverage report filtering because of poor results.

e.g. `mbed test --unittests -r Socket --coverage html`g
This command will run all unittests with names containing `Socket` and then create coverage report with the same scheme, filtering all source files with names containing `Socket`. 

The problem is that coverage report will be correct only when filtered test name will be the same as corresponding source file name (to be covered) - the same (-r) pattern is used to filter both test names and source file names used in coverage report

Due to described problems it was decided to disable coverage report filtering.
`-r` will only filter test names and pattern won't be passed to coverage report generator.

### Summary of changes <!-- Required -->

Non-secure core IPC, Mailbox and Interface init for TFM_TWINCPU (CY8CPROTO_064_SB target).

These changes concentrate on getting mbed-os(Non-secure, M4) working with TF-M(secure, M0+).
Changes reflect towards any Cypress based TFM-TWINCPU targets at the moment and making it more generic in the near future.

Key changes:
* Override CY8CPROTO_064_SB target serial baud to aid debugging.
* Init IPC, Mailbox and Non-secure Interface.
    These changes specifically target TFM_TWINCPU platforms. We are initializing the following:
    * IPC Interrupts for syncing multi-core platforms.
    * NS Mailbox to receive messages.
    * NS interface.
* Add Object-specific memory allocation.
  This will enable all Cypress targets to use an Object-specific memory allocation for mutex creation in an efficient way handled by the RTX. The mutex is required by the tfm_ns_interface_init() for any TFM_TWINCPU based platform.

### Test results <!-- Required -->

These changes are tested on CY8CPROTO_064_SB with M0+ running TF-M Secure binary and M4 running blinky example with mbed-os non-secure binary.

The TF-M secure binary is tested from https://git.trustedfirmware.org/trusted-firmware-m.git/commit/?h=feature-twincpu&id=c1872ef0990102fcfb85724794101c614513d360

The blinky example is tested with both compilers
```mbed compile -t ARMC6 -m CY8CPROTO_064_SB```
```mbed compile -t GCC_ARM -m CY8CPROTO_064_SB```

Further, a patch is required to fix the semaphore issue to make the testing pass which is ought to be upstreamed to TF-M/Mbed-os. A temporary fix is attached - [mbedos_ipc_sema.txt](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/files/4075711/mbedos_ipc_sema.txt)
