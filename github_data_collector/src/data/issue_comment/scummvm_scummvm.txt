Because the 3DS hardware supports RGBA8 textures but not ARGB8 textures, adjust colormasks.h accordingly at compile time.

This PR does two things:
 - It changes `hasFeature()`, `setFeatureState()` and `getFeatureState()` to explicitly reject unsupported features and fall back to the parent implementation for everything else. This provides filtering support on the relevant platforms, and fixes a regression in the SamsungTV port from commit ce32745.
 - The overrides of those functions are also moved into the OSystem subclass. This is consistent with the Vita, Switch and AndroidSDL backends, and removes the need for a separate graphics manager subclass for Symbian and SamsungTV.

Mixer managers can now be used with non-SDL backends.
Implement a kind of font mapper which takes a list of font files, font
face name, size, slant and weight and finds the best matching face.
Fakes italic and bold if there it isn't available.
This commit adds support for TTC files which contains multiple faces
(used by CJK Windows fonts).
This moves code files out from the main scummvm project and into new projects.

Specifically, it uses these new projects:
* Audio
* Graphics
* Video
* Common
* Backend
* Gui
Switch target Android to 29 as it is required by Google Play Store
Switch minimum Android to 16 (4.1) as it is the lowest supported version by NDK
Switch to NDK r20
Removed MIPS and armeabi as they are no longer supported
Renamed Android build names into official ones

> The FluidSynth reverb, while not as good as the old Live!/Audigy hardware reverbs (which were quite good), can still sound decent with the right settings. I have no idea how to change this in ScummVM, but I have found the following FluidSynth settings to sound much better:
> 
> Reverb:
> 
> Room: 0.61
> Damp: 0.23
> Width: 0.76
> Level: 0.57
> 
> Chorus:
> 
> N: 3
> Level: 1.2
> Speed: 0.3
> Depth: 8
> 
> This gives a much more spacious sound, as opposed to the "stuffy room" that seems to be FluidSynth's default.

> I basically tested these settings with every (!) game, and it was indeed a huge improvement.

> In addition, the `reverbWidth` setting in ScummVM master is handled internally as an `int`. This is a bug, which means the value can never be adjusted correctly - it should be a `double`, like all the other parameters.
This PR adds support for the Red Comrades 1, Red Comrades 2 and Red Comrades Demo by S.K.I.F
The demo is fully supported.
The other games can run, but are unplayable due to a lot of bugs.

The engine misses walking system implementation. This is the main reason why the engine is bugged.

I'm not sure if it should be merged in current state.
Looking forward to your suggestions.
