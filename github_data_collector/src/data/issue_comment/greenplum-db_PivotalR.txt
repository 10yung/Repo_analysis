The current error as shown in R: 

> Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable)  : 
>   unable to find an inherited method for function ‘as.db.data.frame’ for signature ‘"function

While debugging the error using as.db.data.frame I learned the dataframe I was using was not in the environment. Would suggest making this error more specific to missing data.
Bug report from Mark Malamut: 

I believe I encountered what appears to be a small bug in this package that I cannot get around when trying to incorporate it into my own package which provides a db access layer for our team.  Here is what I believe is the problem.
 
Note that I am using the most recent version from CRAN 0.1.18.3
 
The PivotalR package implements cbind and therefore overrides the base `cbind` when the fully library is loaded using the `library(PivotalR)` directive.  From the behavior I have seen it appears that a reference to `cbind` in your package uses whatever `cbind` is available in the current environment as opposed to explicitly using `PivotalR::cbind`.  I believe this to be the case as my code works fine when specifying `library(PivotalR)` but fails during `db.disconnect` with the following when the library is not fully loaded.
 
Sample Code
```
#library(PivotalR)
 
connect = function(){
  PivotalR::db.connect(host='x1', user='x2', password='x3', dbname='x4', quick=TRUE)
}
 
disconnect = function(id){
  PivotalR::db.disconnect(conn.id=id, verbose=TRUE)
}
 
query = function(str){
  id = connect()
  result = PivotalR::db.q(str, conn.id=id, verbose=TRUE, nrows='all')
  disconnect(id)
 
  result
}
 
X = query(“SELECT * FROM <table>”)
Error in .localVars$conn.type[[conn.pkg]] <- .localVars$conn.type[[conn.pkg]][-which(.localVars$conn.type[[conn.pkg]] == : replacement has length zero
 
 
 
When the library PivotalR is loaded, I see the following informational messages and my code works without error:
> library("PivotalR", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.3")
 
Attaching package: ‘PivotalR’
 
The following objects are masked from ‘package:stats’:
 
    sd, var
 
The following object is masked from ‘package:base’:
 
    cbind
 ```

Which is why I believe there is an implicit call to cbind in your code ( It doesn’t seem that sd or var are the issue).  Note that the first time it fails in db.disconnect but if you rerun without resetting the environment subsequent calls will fail in db.connect with the following error message:
```
Error in .localVars$conn.type[["rpostgresql"]] <- c(.localVars$conn.type[["rpostgresql"]], : more elements supplied than there are to replace
 ```
```
db.list()
Error in postgresqlExecStatement(conn, statement, ...) : 
  RS-DBI driver: (could not run statement: no connection to the server
)
Error in if (gsub(".*(HAWQ).*", "\\1", dbms.str, perl = T) == "HAWQ") { : 
  argument is of length zero
In addition: Warning message:
In postgresqlQuickSQL(conn, statement, ...) :
  Could not create executeselect version()
```
File `R/db_conn-generic.R` has line
`eval(parse(text = paste("suppressMessages(library(", conn.pkg, "))")))`, 

where `conn.pkg` can currently only be `RPostgreSQL`. This pollutes the namespace by attaching all objects from `RPostgreSQL`. We should avoid this by using the scope operator `::` instead of attaching the objects. 

hi,
  when I run  a by processing in Hawq using a  custom function, i only get results for 100 rows. Any ideas as to why that occurs?

if i do something like this
`samples_tissue_mu_logcpm` <- by(gtex_df[, "logCpm"], c( gtex_df$gene, gtex_df$Tissue_type),mean )`

Then i get the correct number of rows 112636
however if i submit my own function or a non-standard function as below I only get 100 results retrieved 
`samples_tissue_logcpm_q_lo <- by(gtex_df[, "logCpm"], c( gtex_df$gene, gtex_df$Tissue_type),
                                 FUN=function(x)
                                   {
                                    y <- lookat(x, nrows=NULL)
                                     return(quantile(y, prob=0.25 ))
                                    })`

Is any method like sql method insert into one row or a query?
Or like rbind method?

Implement plr.map, plr.reduce, plr.filter, plr.flatmap functions, which utilize PL/R to create functions directly in Postgres databases.

Using these functions as the basis for building more complicated algorithms.

When estimating large models, it would be nice to get some feedback on progress like the verbose flag in MADlib. E.g. printing the iteration number for logistic regression.

I know that MADLib supports association rules, and i would like to use it from R. Is there a possibility to implement this feature?
