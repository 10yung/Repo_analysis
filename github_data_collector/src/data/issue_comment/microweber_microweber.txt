Image description and image alt text are not saving. I've uploaded a screen capture on issue #465 that demonstrates. (The url link seems to save). The updates I suggested in that issue no longer work.
1) Tabindex after 'Admin username' goes to 'Admin URL' and then back to admin email.
2) Specifying admin URL during setup works but upon completion of the install the system always redirects to /admin/?install_done=1 instead of /$adminurl/?install_done=1
I tested mw1.1.13 Dream template on a test domain and ran a GTmetrix report as attached. The first 3 checks are graded F; the first two relate to image optimisation and the third to file ui.css being served via 2 urls, one with and one without the version parameter.

The images that are hugely scaled down and are listed for optimisation are the png images loaded in the company logo slider. The original assets are small in terms of byte size, but the sizes for the same images in the cache are much larger. For example the first image listed is the 'dribble' logo, the original png file 'partner3.png' is only 10KB file size. However the thumbnailed image in the cache increases to 95KB! I see that in template file userfiles/templates/dream/modules/pictures/templates/skin-1.php (and others) the dimension 993x350 are passed as parameters in the thumbnail function.

3 questions:

1) Do the picture gallery templates need to set the thumbnails so large at 993x350? Because increasing pixel size increases file byte size to the detriment of page load speed and SEO?

2) Any idea where the references to userfiles/modules/microweber/css/ui.css are not consistent? I can't see any evidence in the home page source, but maybe GTmetrix is checking across several pages. Sounds like a GTmetrix test on the WordPress Twentyseventeen theme flags up a [similar issue](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/gtmetrix-says-serve-resources-from-consistent-url/).

3) The iconsmind.woff fonts file is a great resource of icons, however it adds a 1.1MB overhead that slows down page loading. Could the woff file be reduced in size maybe by using the woff2? Intial conversion test suggests that a woff2 file would be about 365KB which would be a huge saving.

Hello,

I have an issue on live edit. When I want to add a layout from sidebar, scroll not working (on touch device). Only working with mouse scroll on desktop. How can I fix this issue.
P.S: I'm not updating mw version. Because I changed some core code in src folder. 

I forgot to write the version I use. My Microweber Version is: 1.1.2.1
