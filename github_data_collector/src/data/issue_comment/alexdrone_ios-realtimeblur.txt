Is there any way to change how strong the blur is? Thanks!

I'm new so I can't really offer much more than that. Does this still work?

When i change frame size after initializing the view, it renders a black background and no blur effect

even with less frames <10 if this is applied on a view which contains a tableview everything is extremely jerky.

Good try though. thank you for your work.

I tried everything nothing works on iOS 7 tintColor, backgroundColor you cannot change it it's always white, my app has a dark theme and the blurred view needs to match the app, but you cannot change it

This errors happens when the `visibleArea` width or height are zero.

The performance of this library could be greatly improved, below is a list of recommendations to take to increase the performance:
- To capture the raw pixels you can utilise a CGBitmapContextCreate with your own memory buffer as the first argument. This allows you to skip compressing it to a JPG and then an NSData object just to unpack it back into raw pixels using the image provider methods.
- You can use the vImage_Buffer as both the source and destination to avoid using more memory than necessary.

Both of the above recommendations can be found here: https://gist.github.com/robertjpayne/6775157. I didn't create a pull request because the code is not heavily tested.

In the simple testing I did it resulted in a speedup of about 2-3x.

Did you want to create the pull request/issue on CocoaPods/Specs to add this to the list? Or would you like me to go ahead with it?

Looks like this doesn't work correct. Trying to build something like the control center in iOS7. So if I try to present a blur view modally from the bottom of the window, the blur view isn't real time. Just statically contains its background and doesn't change as it's animated. 

Any ideas how to implement this?

I have a moving transparent view on top of the blurred view and I can see it in the blurred view.
