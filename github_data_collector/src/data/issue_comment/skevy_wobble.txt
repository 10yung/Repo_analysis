*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

I added a `setValue` function that acts as sugar
for updating config and starting. This is somewhat akin
to `setEndValue` in rebound. Name of method is totally
up for debate. 

Second, I added a `raf` config option (again, name up for
debate) that stops `_step()` from registering its own
requestAnimationFrames. With `raf: false` all spring
advancing must be done manually.

That said, I mangled the living hell out of `_step`
and `advanceSpringToTime` in order to get this to work.

It needs some cleaning up. Perhaps `_step` becomes
what `_advanceSpring` is now? Usually in GL land
step/tick functions are called by your main draw loop
to do whatever time-based advancing they need to do, so there'd
be some parity to existing convetions that way.

Finally, check out the squares demo I added (again it's messy).
If you watch the performance monitor heap allocation remains
constant and there's only a single raf frame :thumbsup:
I'm noticing pretty bad GC sweeps every few seconds using a dozen or so springs.

I think the majority of this is coming from the object/closure oriented way springs are updated via `updateConfig`.

```
  updateConfig(updatedConfig: PartialSpringConfig): this {

    this._advanceSpringToTime(Date.now());

    const baseConfig = {
      fromValue: this._currentValue,
      initialVelocity: this._currentVelocity
    };

    this._config = {
      ...this._config,
      ...baseConfig,
      ...updatedConfig
    };

    this._reset();

    return this;
  }
```

For reference, this [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18364175/best-practices-for-reducing-garbage-collector-activity-in-javascript/18411275#18411275) answer details pretty nicely all the things that are going to allocate memory in js

I haven't looked too closely at `_advanceSpringToTime` yet, but I don't see any major culprits at first glance.

I like the minimalism of wobble and I'd like to submit some PRs if you want to discuss alternative syntax here first to avoid the `{}`'s.
Works well for a single spring, but starts being a major performance snag having many Springs all calling `requestAnimationFrame`.

Using this in a webgl app targeting 60fps.

Is there a way to not have them all register their own raf on every `_step` and instead manually loop each one? Similar to how rebound does it?

I have a single raf callback that I do all polling, updating, and then drawing in. Multiple raf's kill the performance.
I haven't played with this library yet. It seems interesting.

If there is GIF showing at least one animation from the library, it will be awesome.
