Hi
Is there a way i can get the equation if the ellipse that are formed through the ggbiplot function.

Thank you
In R,
> library(devtools) ##gives following error
Error in library(devtools) : there is no package called ‘devtools’
How to fix it?
I have a problem in installation of ggbiplot and the error is Error: Failed to install 'unknown package' from GitHub:
  schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_CERT_EXPIRED (0x80090328) - The received certificate has expired.


please help me for resolving the error
thanks 
Hi is it possible to compute this function with an object of phyl.pca?
The library allows drawing a normal data ellipse for each group. Is there any way to choose to what group draws an ellipse?

and thanks a lot for this package!


I've tried the experimental or not experimental versions of vqv, richardjtelford and vangalamaheshh github ggbiplot sites without success
Hi,
Does anyone know which parameter can be used to change the color of varname?
The dependency on `plyr` means that `ggbiplot` masks functions from `dplyr`. This isn't too much of a problem if loading the package using `library(ggbiplot)`, as I can just reorder my imports, but `ggbiplot` also loads all of `plyr` if you use the `ggbiplot::ggbiplot()` syntax. 

So currently there is no way of preventing `ggbiplot` from masking `dplyr` functions without ensuring that you explicitly import `ggbiplot` first.

Is there some way of changing how `ggbiplot` uses the functions from `plyr` to prevent it being fully loaded when you use the `ggbiplot::ggbiplot()` syntax?
Hi,

Thanks for making a great package. It saved me lots of time!

I work with high-dimensional data. Plotting all arrows makes the figure too crowded. I modified your code to plot only a few arrows at a time (toggled via the `labels.subset` argument). Please accept this pull request if you think others might find this feature helpful too.

Cheers,
Thom
