This change will make radiolists and checklists useable

I have a tv box with armbian installed, debian, and I dont have a __platform that can be use to install on a s905x board, vero 4k and odroic-c2 have this kind o cpu but are demanding install dependencies that are not easy to resolve.

there's any way to create a installation for a generic s9xxx board ?
Now that the Mali branch has been merged into the SDL2 super branch #2809 we need to explicitly set `--enable-video-mali` as per other Mali platforms.
After install [`Dolphin`](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/blob/master/scriptmodules/emulators/dolphin.sh), PCSX2 will be removed, due packages dependencies.

User should be able to just reinstall PCSX2, but after request the reinstall, system will be lead to a broken dependencies state in `apt`.

The reason: Dolphin **build** requires `portaudio19-dev` and the PCSX2 package is missing a dependency on `libjack-jackd2-0:i386` (and both packages are not compatible).

This PR is just changing the PCSX2 script to explicitly require `libjack-jackd2-0:i386`, so when we request to install/reinstall, `apt` will be able to solve the dependencies.

This is valid for Ubuntu and Debian.

Similar to other SDL1 based emulators, pass the resolution arguments to the emulator, to be expanded by `runcommand` when started. Enable the `dispmanx` SDL1 videodriver only for the Raspberry Pi platforms that don't use the KMS driver.
capricerpi install with +sh access for scanlines and high resolution activate for default
the title says all.
Retrieves missing Atari 800 / XL / XE colour palettes so they are usable in the emulator.
I had problems installing virtual gamepad because pm2 installation was throwing errors (Method Not Allowed). Installing it using the official installation script instead of npm worked for me
I never liked the blurry scaling that we get as a side-effect of our SDL upscale, so I found a way to leverage vcgencmd to apply a better looking (IMO) nearest neighbour scaler. this is the same way that Retraorch does it with the dispmanx video driver. see https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/2641

It's also (probably unmeasurably) faster :)

Screenshots! From my phone as I couldn't get the internal screenshot button to work. Ignore the debug info in the corner :)

opinions may differ as to what looks better, but IMO the look the emulator should be controlled by the emulator config (in this case the various n64 video plugins do support AA, etc), and our upscaling should not apply additional effects.
