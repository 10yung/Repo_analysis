Hello! First off, thank you so much for this repository, it's amazing.

I noticed in #401 you said:

I tried to change /usr/local/airflow/airflow.cfg to default_timezone = America/Sao_Paulo .. i tried set TZ=America/Sao_Paulo  AIRFLOW__CORE__DEFAULT_TIMEZONE=America/Sao_Paulo .. but all of them don't work ..

My environment is Airflow running in Docker. Python 3.6 downgraded from 3.7 and Airflow 10.7 ->upgraded from 10.4 to try and solve this issue. Here is the error on docker logs airflow.  No dags are getting executed or scheduled or triggered although there are being correctly picked up and displayed on the web UI.
