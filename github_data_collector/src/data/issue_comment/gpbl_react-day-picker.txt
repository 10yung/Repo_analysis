Trying to set dates to undefined to clear, causes the below error
`A component is changing a controlled input of type undefined to be uncontrolled. Input elements should not switch from controlled to uncontrolled (or vice versa). Decide between using a controlled or uncontrolled input element for the lifetime of the component.`

Caption.js:10 Uncaught TypeError: f.default.instanceOf is not a function

**Describe the bug**
In Safari (13.0.03, for me), clicking a date sets aria-selected and class attributes for the preceding day, rather than the date clicked. This happens despite the correct date having appropriate hover + focus styles on click, and the correct date is verifiably selected when attaching console output to the onDayClick event.

I should note that doesn't appear to happen with 100% consistency in Safari, as I was not able to reproduce my team's bug reports on this until today.

This bug is occurring in an instance of DayPicker in a fairly minimal React component.

**Expected behavior**
The date that is clicked gets the correct attributes: aria-selected="true" & class="DayPicker-Day--selected"

**Screenshots**
I've created an animated gif to show the effect:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/qr5x0p6qbpi2znm/animation.gif?dl=0

**Describe the bug**
I click a few of the examples, such as this: http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/elements-year-navigation then the whole page crashes and I get the below in the console.

**To Reproduce**
N/A

**Expected behavior**
Not crash the website.

**Screenshots**

**Additional context**
Browser: Waterfox 2019.10
OS: Windows 8.1

When implementing date range with caption element, on iOS (13) Safari browser - the start day selection is working correctly, but when trying to select end date,  only onDayMouseEnter event is being registered and required second tap on the same element to count as a click, the issue is only present if there is at least one input family element (input, select, textfield, button) in the caption element component.

**To Reproduce**
https://codesandbox.io/s/react-day-picker-base-w8bh1
Visit the sandbox with iOS(13) device, first try to choose a date range without disabling  custom caption, after that click the toggle button and try it again, this time it should work as it should. 

**Expected behavior**
When choosing the end date the date should be set and not require second tap on the screen for safari to register it as a click.


**Describe the bug**
selecting month is not working properly

**To Reproduce**
check Matching days with modifiers in https://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/matching-days

**Expected behavior**
Month should be 1-12 which is Jan to Dec. It shouldn't show 1 as Feb and 11 as Dec and 15 as March and so on. 

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

Thank You

Minor tidy-up to use `moment`'s documented `localeData` APIs, and avoid its private `_locale` field.
Problem:
1.	The full date of a day cell in the calendar day picker grid is not announced with NVDA, just the number of the day (e.g. 11 instead of Wednesday November 11th, 2019)
2.	The month name is not announced when changing between months

Solution:
1.	Some screen readers (NVDA) do not read ariaLabels directly on `<div>`s. 
a.	Place the visible text in a span hidden from screen readers
b.	have the screen readers read from a separate span that contains the ariaLabels.
c.	Add css class to hide only the screen reader span from display.
2.	Add aria-live=”polite” to caption so that it reads the month when changing between months.

**Describe the bug**
In the DayPickerInputProps interface, style property has been missed, although it was provided to the component earlier. Typescript throw error. 
Someone tried to add in the pull https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/918 

**To Reproduce**
Clone [this CodeSandbox]
https://codesandbox.io/s/react-typescript-v4kd8?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark
to reproduce the bug.

**Expected behavior**
Typescript throw error that style is missing in DayPickerInputProps.

This PR reverts the (unreleased) type refactorings and instead exports LocaleUtils as const again. This should fix the linked issue.

Imo, the refactoring is too big in scope and seems to be abandoned due to the new major release currently in development. This way, we have a working version again and aren't forced to pin to a lower version.
