Thanks much for sharing this awesome tool.

I am struggling to get it to display any notifications though. This is on gnome, so its using notify-send which works fine otherwise. I am calling this script at boot to start dude: 

```
watchdir=$(git config dude.watchdir)

if [ -n $watchdir ]; then
    git dude $watchdir  
fi
``` 
The directory where I am keeping the repos I want monitored is  ~/.git-watch, which i have defined in the .gitconfig

As far as I can tell everything seems to start and run fine, as you can see in the screenshot of the relevant processes.

I am pretty much at a loss on what could be preventing the notifications from displaying. I am not using gdm or any display manager / screensaver. Is git-dude supposed to sleep if the screensaver is active and not fetch any info from git, if I am understanding correctly? 

If you have any thoughts on what could be going wrong I would love to hear them.  


Assuming an exit code of 0 indicates "success"/that the screensaver is active, the "screensaver is running" check needs to be reversed.
If i have a repo with a parenthesis in the name the script breaks when running eval

```
icon_path=/home/grok/code/salt-states/icon.png
cd "$dir_name"; git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
cd "$dir_name"; git config dude.ignore
basename "$dir_name" .git
git config dude.remote || true
git fetch $remote 2>&1 | grep -F -- '->' | sed 's/^ [+*=!-] //'
git config dude.icon || true
pwd
icon_path=/home/grok/code/salt-states\ (copy)/icon.png
/home/grok/bin/git-dude: eval: line 67: syntax error near unexpected token `('
```

Pull Request #30 added support for OS X Notification Center (OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion and newer) using [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier). Unfortunately, it also added GitHub-specific support, so was not accepted, but the OS X Notification Center support would be a nice addition.
