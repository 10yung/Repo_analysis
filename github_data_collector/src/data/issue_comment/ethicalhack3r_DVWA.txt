我使用PHP-7.1.33+MySQL5.6+NGINX-1.16。
单击创建数据库时提示500错误，查看NGINXerror log：

Google了一一下这是由于PHP7更改了MySQL的链接方式导致
请问如何处理？？只能用PHP5.5及以下版本吗
Hello!

I'm having problems setting up DVWA on CentOS 7 + NGINX. 

Although the config directory and phpids_log.txt permissions is set to 777, setup still says it's not Writable.

What's weird is that they have the same permission as the hackable/uploads directory which is working.

[User: nginx] Writable folder /usr/share/nginx/html/DVWA/hackable/uploads/: Yes
[User: nginx] Writable file /usr/share/nginx/html/DVWA/external/phpids/0.6/lib/IDS/tmp/phpids_log.txt: No


[User: nginx] Writable folder /usr/share/nginx/html/DVWA/config: No

Got DVWA from git using the command:

> git clone https://github.com/ethicalhack3r/DVWA.git

Maybe a bug?
Sorry for the mistakes earlier. This should do the trick!

Tested on php 7.2.
Also installed 'php-xml' within my docker container. 

Please let me know if i need to fix anything. 
how to solve this problem 
csrf token issue
I've created a new user on the mysql server and their password is blank. I can log in as them with no password but dvwa can't ever seem to see the mysql service. My config file appears to be correct.
test
Tried everything i could think of still getting this error whenever i try to create the database. Using XAMPP to host it. 
I set the security to "Low" so I could test my hack, but when I move to the SQL injection page, the security settings revert to "Impossible".  I've tried mucking with my cookies and fiddling with the dropdown to no avail.  It is simply broken.

How can I fix this?

Add docker-compose support. After cloning the repository, all you have to do is run: `docker-compose up -d --build`. 

When a database container is started for the first time, a new database will be created and initialized with data from `./docker/init.sql`.

Config parameters can be changed via `.env` or `docker-compose.override.yaml` files.

MySql 5.7
PHP 7.2
Apache 2.4

This PR also fix some errors in `dvwa/includes/dvwaPhpIds.inc.php` and `php.ini`
I have the DVWA installed on a system (http//security-labs.web.astronaut.training).

I've turned the security down to "Low".

I can't get the alerts to pop up.  I've tried Safari and Chrome.

I'm doing the basic <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

Can anyone help me?
