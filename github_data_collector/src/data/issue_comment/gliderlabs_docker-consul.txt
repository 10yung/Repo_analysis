Hello guys,
I updated this repository to alpine 3.6 and consul to 1.0
I am trying to set my bind interface through CONSUL_BIND_INTERFACE and it is pulling the correct IP for the interface but it is still giving me an error:

```
[fakeuser@fakeserver fakedir]$ docker run -it --rm --net=host -e "CONSUL_BIND_INTERFACE=eth1" consul consul agent -client=0.0.0.0 -ui -retry-join=server1.us.local -retry-join=server2.us.local -retry-join=server3.us.local -data-dir=/tmp/consul
==> Found address '100.73.14.171' for interface 'eth1', setting bind option...
==> Starting Consul agent...
==> Error starting agent: Failed to get advertise address: Multiple private IPs found. Please configure one.
```

When I run it and fill in the bind address manually it works:

``` 
[fakeuser@fakeserver fakedir]$ docker run -it --rm --net=host consul consul agent -ui -client=0.0.0.0 -bind=100.73.14.171 retry-join=server1.us.local -retry-join=server2.us.local -retry-join=server3.us.local -data-dir=/tmp/consul
==> Starting Consul agent...
==> Starting Consul agent RPC...
==> Consul agent running!
           Version: 'v0.7.1'
         Node name: 'server1.local.us'
        Datacenter: 'dc1'
            Server: false (bootstrap: false)
       Client Addr: 0.0.0.0 (HTTP: 8500, HTTPS: -1, DNS: 8600, RPC: 8400)
      Cluster Addr: 100.73.14.171 (LAN: 8301, WAN: 8302)
    Gossip encrypt: false, RPC-TLS: false, TLS-Incoming: false
             Atlas: <disabled>
```

I'm not sure why its not working as its getting the right bind address to pass to -bind.
Any specific documentation on how to configure the docker-consul to enable security ?
In the Legacy branch the dockerfiles used to expose the consul ports: https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-consul/blob/legacy/Dockerfile#L31

This has been removed in the current Dockerfiles.  Was there motivation for this or was it simply an oversight?  I maintain a test suite that spins up ephemeral Consul containers to test API calls against and it's easier to map ports when they are exposed, so if this is simply an oversight I'll open a PR to add them back.
To be specific : 

How does consul support scalability (for example : providing the services info via the round robin) 
Unable to elect leader even after all nodes join the quorum.
Starting one server (node1) with -bootstrap-expect 3, other nodes join the cluster i.e (node2 and node3) and complete the quorum. But the leader election does not start, it always gives the above error.
Please suggest the possible solutions.
Thank you
I´m using the latest version (0.6) from 

I have cloned and tagged locally the image (consul/server:1.0) from your repository docker-consul agent and server

All the cluster and membership core functionalities work like a charm, however I´m struggling to see the UI in action

OEL0043:consul-server mfarache$ docker run --name nodeUI-server -p 8400:8400 -p 8500:8500 -p 8600:53/udp consul/server:1.0 -bind=127.0.0.1 -client=0.0.0.0 -dc=dc1 

Whenever I access to localhost:8500/ui I get a 500 error. Reason seems to be related with this JS stack trace

eferenceError: consulHost is not defined

In old distributions there were a /UI directory in the image and browsing old code I noticed that consulHost was defined in the static html file.

Now with the consul-server image, the static code is packed as part of the  consul binary. I wonder which value or how can I configure so the UI is available, hopefully adding some parameter on startup? Or is it possible that the old consulHost variable within the html file is still not initialized? 

Curl is great for http checks but netcat would be great for generally checking tcp sockets. 

After the start of the service, the consul.wath connection service is rejected.I don't know how to solve it:(
