HI, i test the code taged cvpr16_results in OTB2013 datasetï¼ŒOPE result of overlap AUC is 0.593 which differs from 0.600 in paper. I am sure the dataset is fine as other algorithms run the corresponding results. It helps a lot if you solve the trouble.
Is the Staple - TIR code, which was submitted to VOT - TIR'16 also part of this repository?
`im_patch_scale = getScaleSubwindow(im, pos, base_target_sz, scale_factor*scale_factors, scale_window, scale_model_sz, p.hog_scale_cell_size);
xsf = fft(im_patch_scale,[],2);`

why  the 33 scales multiply the scale_window(33 length) respectively?

fft(X, [], 2), the arg '2' it means fft by row, but we konw each column of 'im_patch_scale'  is a scale. so, why don't set the arg '1' to fft by column for a scale image?
What hp_name and hp_value mean?
Thank you.
