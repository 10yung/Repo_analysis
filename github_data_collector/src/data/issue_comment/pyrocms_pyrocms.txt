Pyro 3.7

Steps to reproduce:
Change the CP language to anything else than English and visit the roles-table at `admin/users/roles`.
-> `admin`,`guest` and `user` are gone.
Same happens when trying to attach roles to a user. If the CP ist that to anything else than english you can't attach admin,user or guest role because they're missing in the dropdown.

Update:
Seems like you can't even edit a user anymore because of this problem. Saving a usersprofile in the control panel results in a `Call to a member function getId() on null` error.

**Describe the bug**
If you place a date field type within a repeater and set it to be text and not datepicker. It only instantiate on the first repeater, not the others. So it's a javascript thing there.

Then see images on how i set my dates. Please let me know if there are other ways to set the timezone than these and ill try. But basically if i use the datepicker, and have the values set according to the timezone and rules in the images it fails validation..

**Describe the bug**

If i remove a block in admin, its data is deleted from the blocks table, but not from blocks transalations and not from block-extension tables.

If i remove a block programmatically via $blockModel->delete(),  its data is not deleted from block-extension tables.

**Expected behavior**
In both cases, all block data should be deleted from all tables.

**Additional context**
Over the time much garbage data will bloat the database.
**Describe the bug**
When searching an exact phrase with double quotes, the following error occurs: 

> An exception has been thrown during the rendering of a template ("SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'plato"*") >= ? or MATCH (searchable) AGAINST ("+"plato"*") >= ? or `title` LIKE ' at line 1 (SQL: select * from `default_search_items` where `locale` = nl and MATCH (title,description) AGAINST ("+"plato"*") >= 3 or MATCH (searchable) AGAINST ("+"plato"*") >= 3 or `title` LIKE %"plato"% or `description` LIKE %"plato"% order by MATCH (title,description) AGAINST ("+"plato"*") desc, MATCH (searchable) AGAINST ("+"plato"*") desc)").


**To Reproduce**
Do a search between double quotes, e.g. "plato".

**Expected behavior**
Searching the exact phrase that is placed between double quotes as described in [the docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/fulltext-natural-language.html).

Version history builds up over time - let's keep it under control with garbage collection.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Trim garbage past "max age" setting on `artisan refresh` or Schedule.
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When adding routes in a module `ex1-module` for another module `users-module`, for example when adding a section/form/table, its not possible to add these routes to the service providers `$routes` property. This is because `AddonProvider::registerRoutes` adds/overrides the streams:addon value to $addon->getNamespace(). This would result in empty control panel sections.

So the routes need to be defined in the map() method. This way the control panel sections for the users-module are shown

_See screenshots below_ + [code examples](https://github.com/pyradic/dev/tree/609cba101d2561a761880292b70f0a5820d75539/addons/shared/examples/ex1-module#routing)

**Describe the solution you'd like**
On [`AddonProvider@339`](https://github.com/anomalylabs/streams-platform/blob/1.7/src/Addon/AddonProvider.php#L339)
Would it be possible to implement something like:
```php
if(!array_has($route, 'streams::addon')){
    array_set($route, 'streams::addon', $addon->getNamespace());
}
```

This way, in `$routes` you can define `streams:addon` yourself like
```php
    protected $routes = [
        '/admin/users/departments'           => [
            'as'   => 'examples.module.ex1::departments.index',
            'uses' => 'Examples\Ex1Module\Http\Controller\Admin\DepartmentsController@index',
            'streams::addon' => 'anomaly.module.users'
        ],
   ];
```
**Describe the bug**
If you change the page type of a page, the type_id in pages_pages is correctly updated to the new type id, but the entry_type and entry_id are not updated.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a page using the Default page type
2. Create a new page type ( e.g. Custom page type )
3. Edit page and change the type from Default to Custom
4. In page tree you will see the correct Type referenced but on viewing the page, the original content will be shown. This is because entry_type is still set to 'Anomaly\Streams\Platform\Model\Pages\PagesDefaultPagesEntryModel' along with associate entry_id

**Expected behavior**
After changing the type, as well as the type_id being updated, entry_type should also be updated to 'Anomaly\Streams\Platform\Model\Pages\PagesCustomPagesEntryModel' alognm with the entry id in that model.
**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a foo.css file with a media block that starts with an id, e.g.
```
@media(print) {
  #foo { color: red; }
}
```
2. Run `yarn run prod`
3. In your layout, add
```
asset_add('bar.css', 'theme::foo.css');
asset_inline('bar.css', ['parse']);
```
4. Load the page
5. See error "Unclosed comment"

This is caused by `yarn run prod` minifying the CSS.
The output CSS file looks like
`@media(print){#foo{color:red}}`
This contains `{#`, which is interpreted as a twig comment (the `}}` at the end would probably break things as well).

**Workaround**
Compile themes with `yarn run dev`

This might be difficult to fix as it would be difficult to tell minified CSS from a legitimate twig comment... if it proves too difficult to fix then improving the error message that tells the developer to run `dev` instead of `prod` would help at least.
