As mentioned on https://github.com/jscherer92/Quark/issues/21, maybe http://www.lowjs.org/ ( https://github.com/neonious/lowjs ) could be used in the core. I would like to know what you think :)

@pojala what is state of this project. Is it active. Even if you can list out the help you need some of us can help you out.  
The [webview](https://github.com/zserge/webview) is a tiny cross-platform webview library for C/C++/Golang to build modern cross-platform GUI. This project has no ambition to provide neither Node.js backend nor the Electron API, but has similar objectives like generating small self-contained executable using platform native webview.
I've just found [nodekit](https://github.com/nodekit-io/nodekit) today, didn't try it yet. 

Just put it here for further reference.
Say I wanted to build a concept using electrino. Just to see what I would bump into or find out some of the limitations. How do I get started?
Provide a nodejs native-addon, then we have full nodejs API in the main process, and only using BrowserWindow to render UI.

There are something like [pkg](https://github.com/zeit/pkg), [nexe](https://github.com/nexe/nexe) to bundle a nodejs application as a single execuable, so people can create a nodejs + browser based application.     
Browserify implements many Node.js libraries but for the browser, such as [http](https://github.com/substack/http-browserify), [crypto](https://github.com/crypto-browserify/crypto-browserify), [buffer](https://github.com/feross/buffer) .

Since they work in a browser, they should work in a webview.
