On page 60, the book states that the transformation used from figure 5.2 (e) to figure 5.2 (f), a perfectly determine quadratic landmark-based map, "is invertible and thus meaningless for image registration purposes". This should say uninvertible instead of invertible, right?
Mostly typos or copy&paste errors.
I also told FAIRcheckFiles to consider all mex files as known - not just linux mex files.
Extending #5 to 3D and matrix-free implementations. Extends on Hari's work. 
1. ‘yn’ is not defined when wc is empty. Therefore, xn should be
updated by yRef.

2. Addpath for add-ons folders during FAIR startup.

3. solver is defined as a char, not string. Probably, this issue has
recently arises because of structural changes in R2017a.
Pull #2 breaks any example code that calls GaussNewton.m. For instance, E6_HNSP_MLPIR,SSD_affine2D.m breaks at line 65 in GaussNewton.m. There are actually two issues: (1) line 65 of GaussNewton.m has a syntax error and (2) the variable `solver` is being parsed as the string 'backslash'. Line 65 should be changed from `error(1)` to `error('Error')` because `error()` only accepts strings. A workaround for the second issue is to comment out lines 60-66 in GaussNewton.m. A fix will require further investigation into the parsing of the `solver` variable.
