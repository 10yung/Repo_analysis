The `getSignalsFromList` function has a sanity check, that is not working.  It might be worthwhile to make it into a internal `for` loop or a `lapply` to check if the attributes match.  But generally if the `gr_list` was made using the snippet as template, it is unlikely that that the `attributes` will not match.
