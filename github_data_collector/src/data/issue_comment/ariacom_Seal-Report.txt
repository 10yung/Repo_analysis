At current there is only a picture of a seal and some UML diagrams on the main project homepage.

This could be improved by showing the actual product.
Hi,
I am able to create the reports with report designer and run them. But I wonder, is there any way we can integrate the reports with Visual Studio like the SSRS. Can we run the reports directly in visual studio.
Please let me know.


Thanks.
Hello,

I've recently begun using seal report and it seems like a great reporting tool. I however seem to constantly have a challenge with the website published on IIS from the Seal Server manager. Instead of showing the reports which I created with the server manager and designer, it just keeps showing the default seal demo reports.
Is there anywhere that I need to update a connection string or is there something not being done right? An urgent response would be really appreciated.
thanks.
HI, is there a way to run seal report on a Windows Server 2012 to generate multiple reports from SQl Server database on a monthly basis.
I ask this because the only implementations I've seen from the available online documentations are through the **Report Designer** and using with a web application project.
Please an urgent respond would be appreciated.
Thanks.
SEAL report is great, there is no plan to support. NET core, easy to run on Linux
