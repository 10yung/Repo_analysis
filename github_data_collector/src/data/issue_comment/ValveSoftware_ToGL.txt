Is there a tool you used to convert the IDL or header, or was it done manually?
Compiled togl lib is not working with source sdk2013.

Since Direct3D loses a bit of performance by going through OpenGL with regard to state, maybe mapping D3D9 to Vulkan would allow slightly better performance for Source 1 games on Linux. (Emphasis on the slightly, I know this isn't a magic bullet!)

I put this under "issues", but while it's not really an issue with ToGL, I'm not sure where feature requests are best put.

After some time performace is very bad only restart helps. With mat_queue_mode = 1 all source games run without this issue. Don' know if this is related to ToGL.

Please make to ToGLES2 too.

Straightforward question. Do you guys need help with anything and how can I help?. Thanks for your attention.
