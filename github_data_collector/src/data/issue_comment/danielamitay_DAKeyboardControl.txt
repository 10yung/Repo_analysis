Hello Denielamitay,
I build your source code successfuly, but when I tab on the textfield, it didn't work, seem like doesn't focus on textfield.
I am newbie in iOS dev, so please help me how to fix it.
Thank you
hello sir

i just want to use below cone in swift 3 language so can you please change it in swift as soon as possible because it's urgent for me.

[self.view addKeyboardPanningWithActionHandler:^(CGRect keyboardFrameInView) {
        // Move interface objects accordingly
        // Animation block is handled for you
    }];

Fixes an issue where we attempt to get self.keyboardActiveInput.inputAccessoryView, but the target doesn't respond to this request, resulting in a crash. Example case is presenting an `MFMailComposeViewController`. Can be recreated by creating a new application, integrating the project, presenting an MFMailComposeViewController; first launch will crash; subsequent launches have no effect.

'DAKeyboardControl.m' line 553, column 1 with start address 0x0000000100215854

Sometimes it will crash here 

The library works well with XIBs, but i been having a lot problems with custom views made programmatically.

run test will crash, when swizzle uiview.

Keyboard target moved, I've targeted the new location. But have not gone in deep to check how all your code works. I've not tested with older versions of iOS, but did add a check to use this fix only for iOS 9+. I apologize if my code is not super clean, I had very little time for this. Cheers.

I am facing an issue while using DAKeyBoardControler with Intercom ios sdk. https://github.com/intercom/intercom-ios/issues/80

Their iOS team told me, "We have NSNotifications for when Intercom opens and closes. Anything in the app that customises text field or keyboard behaviour can cause problem like this."

How should I disable the DAKeyboardControl when interacting to Intercom sdk ?

The keyboard refuses to go down with the swipe gesture, I'll try to find some time to take a look at it later, if anyone has any suggestions, feel free to share them.

In ios8, apple began to use the 'center' property instead of 'frame' to support UIScrollViewKeyboardDismissModeInteractive. This breaks the KVO used by this repo.

 https://github.com/danielamitay/DAKeyboardControl/pull/82 has the solution, but this repo hasn't been updated to include it.

Anyone looking through the issues trying to find a solution to this problem, merge in that pull request.
