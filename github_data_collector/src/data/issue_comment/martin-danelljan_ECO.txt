I use VOT-2017 with ECO tracker in MATLAB 2018a
this is from the matlab

How to fix this? I already change the timeout but it's same..
Thankyou
Hi!
Thanks for you execllent work!I test ECO_HC on  OTB100,the pression plot of OPE is normal, but the success plot of OPE is much too high. It's weird. I don't  know why, can youn give me some hint?

Hi! I wanted to try a different combination of features from your paper. So I copied .\runfiles\VOT2016_DEEP_settings.m and changed something.

After I commented `struct('getFeature',@get_fhog,'fparams',hog_params),...` without changing any other things and run run_test.m, it reported '`Tracker execution interrupted: Unable to establish connection.`' Do you know the reason?
Hi! I just tested the ECO tracker on the VOT2016 dataset but the result curve below is different from the ECO paper. Is there something wrong with my testing results?

Hi MD,
Thanks for you great work! One thing I need your help, I tested your code on my PC, which is of 24 GB memory, Intel i7-6700 CPU with 3.40GHz x 8, and NVIDIA TITAN X.
When I run ECO_HC file, the speed is only about 20 fps - 30fps, but in the paper said it can run at 60 fps, There are big difference between the two, I want to know why it happened and how should I do to run it at 60 fps.
Sorry for disturbing you and hope you can help me with it.
Thanks!
Hello ,DM

Thank you for your excellent working. I run the experiments on VOT2016 recently but got strange results. I use the VOT_integration/configuration_file/tracker_ECO.m directly and got 0.3579, the baseline EAO， which is the same as that in https://github.com/martin-danelljan/ECO/issues/1. And when I use VOT2016_HC_settings, I got 0.28 only, which is much worse than 0.32 in your paper. Can different machine cause so different results? Is there any other reason lead to that?
