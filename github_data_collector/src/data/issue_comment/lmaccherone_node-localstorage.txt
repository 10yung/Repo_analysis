Trying to implement the feature as spoken about on #15 (non persistent storage)
Seems to work great except when many instances of LocalStorage are run simultaneously, see [this part](https://github.com/lmaccherone/node-localstorage/blob/d06cd893578a84747d9161ea7a821e8e6640ead5/test/in-memory-test.coffee#L39-L55) of the tests.

By the way, I wanted to illustrate the confusion between the two storage types, but I'm now realizing two things : 
* The same path (`os.tmpdir()`) is used for both of them, and there would also be a mess with two instances using the the same path on the actual file system. _edit_: same path case removed.
* Once a LocalStorage is instanciated without a path and mock-fs has taken over, the whole `fs` module would be affected. Also on other parts of the application.
I think having the option of not persisting data would be helpful. I just need this for running unit-tests where data shouldn't persist past the current run.
