Hello, please tell me how to install your package through the composer for the version laravel 5.44?
Hi!
I have a little dificult to Order my tree.
My Case:
 when I use Model::all()->toTree(), my result is:

```
{
    "permissoes": [
        {
            "id": 34,
            "permissao_id": null,
            "componente": "vsjComponentVisualizar",
            "descricao": "Ordem de Servico",
            "descricao_detalhe": "Registrar ordem de servico etc",
            "_lft": 23,
            "_rgt": 28,
            "status": true,
            "created_at": "2020-01-07 14:26:25",
            "updated_at": "2020-01-08 20:38:52",
            "bits": 0,
            "children": [
                {
                    "id": 35,
                    "permissao_id": 34,
                    "componente": "faskjhsadkjfhlkajsdfh",
                    "descricao": "Consulta",
                    "descricao_detalhe": "Consulta de Ordem de servico",
                    "_lft": 26,
                    "_rgt": 27,
                    "status": true,
                    "created_at": "2020-01-07 14:27:35",
                    "updated_at": "2020-01-08 13:34:05",
                    "bits": 67,
                    "children": []
                },
...
```
when I use Model::defaultOrder()->get(), my result is:

```
{
    "permissoes": [
        {
            "id": 24,
            "permissao_id": null,
            "componente": "vjsClientes",
            "descricao": "Clientes",
            "descricao_detalhe": "Módulo de Clientes",
            "_lft": 1,
            "_rgt": 10,
            "status": false,
            "created_at": "2020-01-06 11:57:37",
            "updated_at": "2020-01-08 20:40:20",
            "bits": 149
        },
        {
            "id": 36,
            "permissao_id": 24,
            "componente": "vjsGrafico",
            "descricao": "Relatorio de Clientes",
            "descricao_detalhe": "Mostra relatorio mensal de clientes",
            "_lft": 2,
            "_rgt": 3,
            "status": true,
            "created_at": "2020-01-08 12:39:42",
            "updated_at": "2020-01-08 12:39:42",
            "bits": 1
        },
```

how you can see, tree not work when I use defaultOrder().
How can I orderBy my tree?

Thanks




Currently the migration style is such that, it adds columns into existing users table. My aim is to create a separate relation table named `user_hierarchy`/`user_tree` with `user_id` as foreign key in it. 

1. is it possible?

2. what changes i need to do in my user model (relations) so that the plugin works without any extra modifications. 
> shows good performance when tree is updated rarely.

How big is the penalty for updating the tree regularly? Is the penalty for appending/prepending less than the penalty for inserting at a specified position?

Is there an alternative structure thats more appropriate for frequent updates?
when i use withDepth()->find($id), somethin wrong happend;
i noted strict mode,but my db is Postgresql.

If i try to nest multiple nodes the `rebuildTree()` doesn't work corrently. Sometimes the complete tree is crashed or the nested nodes are all root nodes after i try to sort them.

**CategoryController.php**
```php
public function index()
{
    $categories = Category::select('id','parent_id','name')
        ->get()
        ->toTree();

    return view('categories.index', compact('categories'));
}
```
**categories/index.blade.php**
```html
<category-tree :data="{{ json_encode($categories) }}"></category-tree>
```

**CategorySortController.php**
```php
public function update(Request $request)
{
    Category::rebuildTree($request->data);
}
```

**CategoryTree.vue**
```vue
<template>
    <div>
        <draggable 
            :list="categories"
            :group="{ name: 'g1' }"
            handle=".handle"
            ghost-class="ghost"
            @change="updateSort"
        >
            <div v-for="category in categories" :key="category.id" class="group border-l border-dotted">
                <div class="item flex items-center font-medium px-2 py-1 bg-white border-b">
                    <div class="handle flex items-center">
                        <i class="fal fa-fw fa-bars text-xs mr-2 text-gray-500"></i>
                    </div>
                    {{ category.name }}
                </div>
                <category-tree class="pl-4" :data="category.children" />
            </div>
        </draggable>
    </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.handle {
    cursor: move;
}
.ghost {
  opacity: .5;
}
.flip-list-move {
  transition: transform .5s;
}
.no-move {
  transition: transform 0s;
}
</style>

<script>
import draggable from 'vuedraggable'

export default {
    props: ['data'],
    components: {
		draggable,
	},
    data() {
        return {
            categories: [],
            drag: false,
        }
    },
    mounted() {
        this.categories = this.data
    },
    methods: {
        updateSort(data) {
            axios.put('/api/category/sort', { data: this.categories })
        },
    },
}
</script>
```
I cannot use factory to do some tests and seeds:
```
$parent = factory(Category::class)->create();
$child = factory(Category::class)->create();

$child->appendToNode($parent)->save();
```
i get this error:
```
BadMethodCallException  : Method Kalnoy\Nestedset\Collection::appendToNode does not exist.
```
I have an imported structure seeded into a nestedset table. This causes the order of the items to change when I fetch as tree or ordered by _lft.

Is there a way to rebuild the tree with this order?
I have used this many times in CakePHP`s Tree behaviour:
https://book.cakephp.org/3/en/orm/behaviors/tree.html#recovering-with-custom-sort-field


Hello,

how can is use this method Node::fixTree(), if i have more user id in Mysql and i'd like to fix just 1 userid.

Regards,
Gabor
If you delete the middle of the tree, the descendants of that tree will be deleted. How can I link the descendants to the target parent without deleting the descendants? 
If the target element is deleted after changing to Array, and then rebuildTree is executed, parent_id disappears and the Tree structure is broken. Is there any good way?

I'm not good at English. I'm sorry
