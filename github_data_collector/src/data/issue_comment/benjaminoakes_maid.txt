This worked ok when run with crontab, but error occurs when I switched to launchd(unfortunately [jurriaan's blog](http://jurriaan.ninja/2015/01/01/maid-on-os-x.html) is down/certificate is out of date at the time of writing so I couldn't get help from there.)

and line 93 in rules.rb goes like this

```
    rule 'Move old screenshots to NAS' do
        dir('~/Pictures/screencapture/스크린샷*').each do |f|
                if 1.week.since(accessed_at(f))
                    up_to_NAS(f, '/volume1/homes/canor/myfiles/mac/screencapture/')
                end
         end
    end
```

CJK character there seems to be the problem but have no idea how to handle this.
Thanks to @phylor, there are a bunch of new changes.  I'd like to release this as v0.8.0 after we can verify that things are still working.  The first part of that is releasing a beta, which just involves bumping some versions, etc.  It's been a while since I've done a release, so after those changes are made, I also need to make sure I can release to rubygems.org.

Help with bumping the internal versions and testing would be very appreciated!  I'd also be up for updating dependencies.  We can drop any old Ruby versions that stop working, but if the tests are still passing, I'm fine with keeping them for now.

I'm still using maid, but much less than I used to, so thank you @phylor for making some contributions.
Is there a way to change log file destination? or redirect to stream/application

regards
This allows you to do, e.g.,

```ruby
repeat '1s', overlap: false do
  # ...
end
```

so that your jobs don't run on top of each other.
Watch rule in daemon mode throws an error. The syntax looks right as this is the sample rule. 
Repeat rule works fine. Any ideas what's wrong? Tested with Ruby 2.0.0, 2.2.0 and 2.4.1_1. Thanks

rulesD.rb:
```
Maid.rules do
  watch '~/Pictures' do
    rule 'organize images by dimensions' do
      where_content_type(dir('~/Pictures/*'), 'image').each do |image|
        width, height = dimensions_px(image)

Hi, have no idea where to get this info, but what is the performance of this vs hazel?
Is it possible to unzip password protected files? 

Somehow the Maid daemon crashes at startup when I use the move tool in a simple watch rule. Any idea why this occurs and what I could do to work around this?

**Conditions:**

Ruby 2.3.1 (installed with Homebrew)

``` ruby
watch "Move screenshots" do
    destination = "~/Pictures/Screen Shots/"
    dir("~/Desktop/Screen Shot *").each do |path|
      move(path, destination)
    end
end
```
- The daemon crashes _only_ when there is already a screen shot on the desktop when it's started
- If the daemon is started while there is no screenshot on the desktop, it starts successfully but doesn't seem to watch the folder for changes (dropping a screenshot on the desktop does nothing)
- Replacing `watch` with `rule` and running `maid clean --force` does the expected thing (moves the screenshot in the `~/Pictures/Screen Shots/` directory.

**Stack trace:**

``` shell
