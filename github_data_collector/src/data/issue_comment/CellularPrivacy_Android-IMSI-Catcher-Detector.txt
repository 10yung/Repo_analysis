Hi, I'm Emanuele Iannone, a master student at University of Salerno.
Since my bachelor's thesis I have been working on a **code smell refactoring plugin** called *aDoctor*, which is able to identify and fix energy-related problems in Android apps.
I launched it on your project, finding different instances of code smells. I chose one of them and let the plugin automatically fix it.
In this case I chose Member Ignoring Method, that is present when a non static method does not use at all instance variables and other non static methods. These kind of smell may have a non trivial impact on energy consumption, as shown in this paper: `https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584918301678`.
Besides, this kind of refactoring does not impact on the functionalities of your app, so it is totally safe. Let me know if you are interested in this refactoring proposal.
There is new model of Nokia 3310 launched,will oscombb work with it?
Can someone recommend me please?
"Cause: android-apt plugin is incompatible with the Android Gradle plugin. Please use 'annotationProcessor' configuration instead." 

Please help me fix it.
Could you please help me fix it 

ERROR: Could not initialize class io.freefair.gradle.plugins.android.AndroidProjectPlugin$ProjectType


Hi 
my question is: does this app root access? I install it and run a FBTS using openbts and SDR. I also implemented some parameters of stingray..but this application doesn't show any warning...
thanks for your help
Is this app still working in 2019. I remember I used to have it and would like to install it again.

[Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/2.28.7/supply/README.md#images-and-screenshots) and Triple-T are two tools for syncing app store texts/graphics/screenshots/etc from a git repo to Google Play.  Both of them are also [directly supported](https://f-droid.org/docs/All_About_Descriptions_Graphics_and_Screenshots/) by F-Droid.  Weblate just launched a beta feature for directly translating the app store name/summary/description/whatsnew texts.  As far as I know, no other translation platform supports these file formats.

See this in action for F-Droid's Android client:

Sir,

Please refer following code snippet from Device.java for MCC/MNC parsing code...

        switch (phoneId) {

            case TelephonyManager.PHONE_TYPE_NONE:
            case TelephonyManager.PHONE_TYPE_SIP:
            case TelephonyManager.PHONE_TYPE_GSM:
                phoneType = "GSM";
                mncMcc = tm.getNetworkOperator();
                if (mncMcc != null && mncMcc.length() >= 5) {
                    try {
                        if (cell.getMobileCountryCode() == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                            cell.setMobileCountryCode(Integer.parseInt(tm.getNetworkOperator().substring(0, 3)));
                        }
                        if (cell.getMobileNetworkCode() == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                            cell.setMobileNetworkCode(Integer.parseInt(tm.getNetworkOperator().substring(3, 5)));
                        }
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        log.info("MncMcc parse exception: ", e);
                    }
                }
                networkName = tm.getNetworkOperatorName();
                if (!cell.isValid()) {
                    GsmCellLocation gsmCellLocation = (GsmCellLocation) tm.getCellLocation();
                    if (gsmCellLocation != null) {
                        cell.setCellId(gsmCellLocation.getCid());
                        cell.setLocationAreaCode(gsmCellLocation.getLac());
                        cell.setPrimaryScramblingCode(gsmCellLocation.getPsc());
                    }
                }
                break;

The line...
cell.setMobileNetworkCode(Integer.parseInt(tm.getNetworkOperator().substring(3, 5)));

should be...
cell.setMobileNetworkCode(Integer.parseInt(tm.getNetworkOperator().substring(3)));

Otherwise 3 digit MNC code will be parsed incorrectly.

Thanks
