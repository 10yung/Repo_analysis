Update bison to 3.5

Release notes:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2019-12/msg00002.html

Note for future: release notes mention that YYPRINT macro is declared deprecated, but apparently still works for now. I found one possible use of that in scripts/config/zconf.tab.c_shipped
That might be modernized at some point, but as the file is synced with the one from upstream Linux, it might get fixed there.


Tested in compiling for ipq806x/R7800
This is only a cosmetic correction, as the driver works as expected.
However, the error message confuses users about a missing reset definition.

On a deferd init we donÂ´t see the following error message now:
[    0.078292] ar7200-usb-phy usb-phy: phy reset is missing

This commit fixes an issue where linkage with libpcap fails when targeting
ramips with glibc. It has been reported at https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/pull/2488#issuecomment-546664153.

Note that this also requires the commit e8f79474c97949454b8d0ea966be006013471336, should anyone want to cherry-pick this commit into the openwrt-19.07 or other branch.
In some situations you need to set the compress param without an
algorithm. Compression will be turned off, but the packet framing for
compression will still be enabled, allowing a different setting to be
pushed later.

As it is not possible to have options with optional values at the
moment, I've introduced a pseudo value "frames_only" which will be
removed in the init script.

If anyone has a cleaner/better solution, please let me know.

CZ.NIC confirmed to me, that the latest revision (CZ11NIC23) are being shipped with a newer U-Boot version, which relies on the existence of `/boot.scr`.
 
The particular version deployed seems to be [this one](https://gitlab.labs.nic.cz/turris/turris-omnia-uboot/commit/81ba547351a9436c5748e96f4c3359814627937f). To make matters worse, the address of the firmware environment in `/dev/mtd0` seems to have changed as well.

This is an attempt to support the new version, by adding the necessary boot script (similar to clearfog.bootscript) to medkit & sysupgrade images. Some U-Boot version logic is added, to keep the old behaviour for the old devices.

If somebody with a CZ11NIC23 version can build medkit & sysupgrade images with this and report back, it would be highly appreciated. I guess those 3 commits can also be rebased onto the 19.07 branch, if the tester prefers.
Arduino Yun is a microcontroller development board, based on Atmel
ATmega32u4 and Atheros AR9331.

Specifications:
- MCU: ATmega32U4
- SoC: AR9331
- RAM: DDR2 64MB
- Flash: SPI NOR 16MB
- WiFi:
  - 2.4GHz: SoC internal
- Ethernet: 1x 10/100Mbps
- USB: 1x 2.0
- MicroSD: 1x SDHC

Notes:
- Stock firmware is based on OpenWrt AA.
- The MCU can be programmed with avrdude linuxgpio.

Installation:
1.  Update U-Boot environment variables to adapt to new partition scheme.
    You'll need to access serial console via YunSerialTerminal.
```
> setenv bootcmd "run addboard; run addtty; run addparts; run addrootfs; bootm 0x9f050000 || bootm 0x9fea0000"
> setenv mtdparts "spi0.0:256k(u-boot)ro,64k(u-boot-env),15936k(firmware),64k(nvram),64k(art)ro"
> saveenv
```
2.  Boot into stock firmware normally and perform sysupgrade with
    sysupgrade image.
```
# sysupgrade -n -F /tmp/sysupgrade.bin
```
Add missing call to `free` for variable `filebuffer`.
Add missing calls to `fclose` for variables `fd` and `fd_out`.
