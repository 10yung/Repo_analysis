Detail error is "Unknown system variable 'transaction_isolation' "

I can confirm that 
```
connectAttributes:
    tx_isolation: 'READ-COMMITTED'
```
is correctly generated as part of config/docker.yaml, but still got the error. Suspect `plugin/mysql/` got some unexpected changes that make the setting above not respected.
Hi, I can submit recurring cron style requests, but I cannot seem to find a way to query cron schedule. Workflow descriptions only display the next scheduled execution time not the actual schedule. Is there a way to do this via cli or programmatically?

It is `> docker docker run ...` now, but it's likely `> docker run ...`

I hadn't found where to push merge request with correct version, so I've opened issue. Sorry for any inconvenience it may cause.


Currently TLS for mysql is using any version of TLS between 1.0-1.3 depending on the server and there is no way to pin your config to a certain version. Offering a way to plumb the desired version down to the config would be nice for users.

See context:
> MinVersion for the minimum TLS version that's acceptable. By default, the minVersion is 1.0, which pretty much should not be used. The default value for this should be 1.3.
>
> CipherSuites - Ideally, this should also be set. TLS 1.3 already prevents you from choosing bad ciphersuites

This pr implements the task processing job, the smallest building block for the multi-tenant task processing logic. On top of the processing job, another component will be implemented to manage a list of jobs with disjoint range (can be viewed as a queue) and responsible for managing their life cycles, read tasks, etc.

Logging and metrics will be added later.
