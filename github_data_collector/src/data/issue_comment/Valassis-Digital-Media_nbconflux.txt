Pass through a 'verify=False' to `requests` actions for sites with invalid/debug/internal certificate configurations
Interesting package. it would be nice if it worked. we are using confluence across the org and it would be awesome if we could share are results like this directly from the notebook.

Unfortunately, it does not work:

`nbconflux path/to/notebook.ipynb https://path/to/page`

Loosely related to #19.

The QA version of my on-premise wiki has been updated to use OAuth2 supported by AWS Cognito which in turn is authenticating with SAML.  I'm hoping no one at my organization plans to roll this out to production - but they do need to eventually move our confluence instance to the cloud.

I'm very far from needing a solution, but others may not be so lucky.  I think something could be done with the python package `requests-oauthlib`.
This appears to simply be a matter of the confluence template not paying attention to the resource flag.

- Since the image is attached to this page, using ri:attachment should be better than ri:url
- The documentation is at https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-storage-format-790796544.html#ConfluenceStorageFormat-Images
  at the time of this writing.
The image is properly attached to the page, but is not displaying correctly.   After I run nbconflux to update the page, and then request its content with body.storage expanded, I see this in the body.storage.value:

```html
<ac:image><ri:url ri:value="https://wiki.nlm.nih.gov/download/attachments/146342104/output_15_1.png?version=3" /></ac:image>
```

However, when I fix this manually in the page with an attachment link, I see:

```html
<ac:image ac:height="250"><ri:attachment ri:filename="output_15_1.png" /></ac:image>
```

It looks like the two lines that need a change are:

[confluence.tpl line 148](https://github.com/Valassis-Digital-Media/nbconflux/blob/master/nbconflux/confluence.tpl#L148)
[confluence.tpl line 156](https://github.com/Valassis-Digital-Media/nbconflux/blob/master/nbconflux/confluence.tpl#L156)

I will attempt a fix and get back to you.

It would be great to be able to prevent watchers from receiving too many updates when I'm doing several exports to fine-tune the page. It seems you can do that with the confluence API by setting "minorEdit" : true in the version description:

Hi,
Great tool! Would it be possible to have an option to exclude all cells by default and only include cells that I tag with a particular tag? Because in my use case, I don't want to include most of the details and export a simplified and clean report.
Let me know what you think.
Thanks!
Hi! I'm a big fan of this module. I'm using it more and more. However, my (offline mode) plotly charts don't render in confluence. It looks like a raw HTML dump. Do you have any suggestions for remedying that?
