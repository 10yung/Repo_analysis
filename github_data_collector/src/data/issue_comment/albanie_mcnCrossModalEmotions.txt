Hi,

Where should we put the three parts in the EmoVoxCeleb dataset in order to use it? 
matconvnet/contrib/mcnDatasets
or
matconvnet/contrib/mcnCrossModalEmotions/emoVoxCeleb? And how to map the classification result in the .m file to the .wav files?

Thanks!
I'm really confused why i got this warning

could not find expected audio file at /home/affcgroup/MatConvNet/matconvnet-1.0-beta25/data/ramdisk/voxceleb_all/Aamir_Khan, did you download VoxCeleb?

 I have downloaded the dataset, but the Audio files are not labled with the celebrity, for example ‘Aamir_Khan’, thus I don't know how to put the uncompressed audio files in the place where it should be.

Could you please explain how to solve this problem? Thanks!
