Hey just a quick suggestion.
There's a repository that includes the google material icons but also has icons created by other artists. Seeing that google rarely adds new icons would you be willing to include [these](https://materialdesignicons.com/) as well? It would help the community out a lot as it's updated constantly  and also the artists who created those icons would benefit as well. 
Could be a simple checkbox and then it'd move the icons to:
- drawable-night-ldpi
- drawable-night-mdpi
- drawable-night-xhdpi
- drawable-night-xxhdpi
- drawable-night-xxxhdpi

Have configurable default settings or set the default to 24dp and white with all DPI's checked.

Instead of a long dropdown list, it would be really nice if the icons were displayed in a grid list with a search bar at the top. Clicking an icon would select it and allow adding multiple icons at once.

The ability for a user preference to set their own default color, size, and dpi variants would be really great.

Another great feature would be to detect the icons already used, set them as checked. If an icon is unchecked it should remove that icon from the drawable folders.

Thanks again for this great plugin!

OS: Deepin 15.1

Current "Overview icons" link is http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/ , which is "Material Icons Guide". Maybe it should be changed to https://design.google.com/icons/ ?

Specifically the action/ic_reorder icon has defects. Some of the icons show up as a block instead of the actual icon (36dp xxxhdpi and xhdpi for example, several others have this issue as well).

The plugin steals focus from android studio. Would like a minimize button or at least ability to click back to Android Studio.

The stacktrace :

A padding is always set, I would like to be able to remove it.
