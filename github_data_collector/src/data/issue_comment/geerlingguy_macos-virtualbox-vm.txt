I kept running into this issue with `Install macOS Mojave.app` when the `prepare-iso.sh` script would get to the `asr restore` command:

```
	Validating target...done
	Validating source...done
	Retrieving scan information...done
	Validating sizes...done
	Restoring  ....10....20....30....40....50....60....70....80....90....100
	Restored target device is /dev/disk4s2.
	Remounting target volume...done
Personalization succeeded
asr: Couldn't personalize volume /Volumes/macOS Base System
```

Oddly enough, though, it appears the "Personalization succeeded," but this emits a non-zero status, so the script dies right here.

I decided to see if I could manually run the commands that followed to see what would happen, and sure enough, everything succeeds, but there was one other thing I needed to change.

I needed to replace:

    /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System

with:

    /Volumes/macOS\ Base\ System

For Mojave, it appears that, when the `asr restore` command mounts the volume for the base system, it uses the name "macOS Base System" instead of the older "OS X Base System."
From https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-macos-virtualbox/:

```
VBoxManage setextradata "[name of vm]" "VBoxInternal/Devices/efi/0/Config/DmiSystemProduct" "iMac11,3"
VBoxManage setextradata "[name of vm]" "VBoxInternal/Devices/efi/0/Config/DmiSystemVersion" "1.0"
VBoxManage setextradata "[name of vm]" "VBoxInternal/Devices/efi/0/Config/DmiBoardProduct" "Iloveapple"
VBoxManage setextradata "[name of vm]" "VBoxInternal/Devices/smc/0/Config/DeviceKey" "ourhardworkbythesewordsguardedpleasedontsteal(c)AppleComputerInc"
VBoxManage setextradata "[name of vm]" "VBoxInternal/Devices/smc/0/Config/GetKeyFromRealSMC" 1
```

Neither Mojave nor High Sierra would boot until I set those values.
So, I enabled FileVault, not thinking this would cause issues. And unfortunately, now the VM won't boot. I've managed to find a way to boot the OS to where I can input my FileVault password, but then the system just doesn't recognize my keyboard. I suspect there might be some missing drivers that I can hopefully `load`?
When I let it wait, I get the error: "The operation couldn't be completed. (com.apple.OSInstallerSetuo.error error 702.)!
Any solutions?

The boot freezes if I have selected more than 1 CPU in the Settings.
Hi :)
The proposed way of changing the resolution didn't work for me. After a bit of googling I found out that in VirtualBox >= 5.2.0 they changed the way to define the resolution. Thanks to this thread: https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=85097#p404438
I'm curious if you ever tried to write a Vagrant script for this.  I've seen [some other people](https://app.vagrantup.com/AndrewDryga/boxes/vagrant-box-osx) have done it.
Using `set -x` and the `$?` construct to detect failures doesn't work, instead use `if cmd ...` to detect if something failed.
Stuck in shell. Always went back to Mojave image until I removed it. Now it simply doesn't boot.
During first boot from iso, boot always stopped at a certain time "Dawin bootstrap 6.0.0....".
After changing number of processors from 1 to 2, boot continued. Don't know if this is only an issue for my Macbook Air 2014 (MacBookAir6,2).
