Is there any work being done to add metadata support?

https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/04/drive-metadata-beta.html
I'm using sync upload to upload a large static collection of files (~ 95k files, 1.6 TB) to a google drive folder.

I only have one instance of the sync running at a time, yet somehow when restarting the sync (after a network timeout for instance) the subsequent run will often complain that there is a duplicate file at the destination, and in fact there is: there will be two files with different ids but the same path.

They show the same path, md5sum and parent ids, but have different ids and viewUrls.

I have to manually delete one of the instances before sync will run again.

Unfortunately I can't show actual output since this project has not been released yet but I can potentially send it to a developer privately - contact me directly if you need this.

Frequently I have to resolve several of these before the next sync will run. Nothing else is accessing this folder yet and only one sync is running at a time. I believe the duplicates are happening while files are being uploaded to drive but don't have any evidence. I may not easily be able to reproduce anymore because I've finally finished syncing the data set, but I suppose another copy could be uploaded for testing if necessary.
