On **tools.py** which beta is calculated by **get_optimal_temperature**? Global or local beta? Would you please be so kind providing functions to calculate both? Thank you very much indeed!
How do we obtain ranks for a specific beta? Thank you very much indeed!!!!


Issues are below:

Error in crossValidation (line 58)
    idx = shuffle(1:M);
Error in demo (line 108)
[sig_a,sig_L] = crossValidation(A,5,1);



Error in eigenvectorCentrality (line 5)
[V,~] = eigs(A+regularization,1);
Error in demo (line 89)
s_eig = eigenvectorCentrality(A);
I got an MemoryError,does this implement can only process data with limited nodes?
