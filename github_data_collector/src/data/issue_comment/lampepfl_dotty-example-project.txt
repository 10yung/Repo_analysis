[This section](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-example-project#getting-your-project-to-compile-with-dotty) described how to use normal dependencies published for Scala 2.

I think it would be great if the section also mention regarding sbt plugin, for people like me who lack of in-depth understadning sbt.

When I updated my `project/plugins.sbt` like below:

```sbt
def dottySupport(moduleId: ModuleID): ModuleID = moduleId.withDottyCompat(scalaVersion.value)

addSbtPlugin(dottySupport("org.scala-js" % "sbt-scalajs" % "0.6.31"))
addSbtPlugin(dottySupport("org.scalameta" % "sbt-scalafmt" % "2.3.0"))
```

`error: value withDottyCompat is not a member of sbt.ModuleID` occured.

Using `dottyLatestNightlyBuild.get` pulls `ch.epfl.lamp#dotty-library_0.21;0.21.0-bin-20191211-731ee3c-NIGHTLY!dotty-library_0.21.jar` (as of around 12:20 PM PST), so the link in the readme to visually confirm the latest nightly build needs updated so they are consistent.

0.19.1-... is an incorrect latest build. The right latest nightly is 0.19.0-... (and tomorrow will be 0.20.0-...).
