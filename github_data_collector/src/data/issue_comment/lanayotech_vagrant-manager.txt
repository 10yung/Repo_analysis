I have set up a synced folder with NFS and now I'm required to supply my password when starting or reloading the machine. So far so good.

On the command line it all works as expected, but when using Vagrant Manager, a password prompt appears, and even though I input the correct password, it keeps reappearing and then the operation fails (see log file extract below).

Vagrant Manager: 2.7.1
Host:                     macOS 10.14.6
Vagrant:                2.2.6
Virtualbox:            6.0.14 r133895
Guest:                   CentOS

```==> master: Exporting NFS shared folders...
==> master: Preparing to edit /etc/exports. Administrator privileges will be required...
tee: /etc/exports: Operation not permitted

==> master: Mounting NFS shared folders...
The following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.
Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed!

mount -o vers=3,udp 192.168.56.1:/*** /var/www/***

Stdout from the command:



Stderr from the command:

mount.nfs: requested NFS version or transport protocol is not supported```
The ability to export/import a list of custom commands for associated vagrant boxes would be helpful in both migrating from one development machine to another as well as for deploying custom commands to a large sub-set of users. Some expansion on this:

- Command line option to import/export (so it's scriptable as part of an install)
- Ability to choose between appending existing commands or overwrite

Today, it's only seemingly doable by copying plists around.
Hi, i am using Laravel Homestead to provision my boxes. We have setup where we use one Vagrantfile for multiple boxes.

In the vagrant manager ui only one box is shown.

```
My software versions.

- Vagrant 2.2.3
- Virtualbox 6.0.4 r128413
- Vagrant Manager 2.7.0

Can you assist with any suggestions on how to correctly register all the boxes. 
There is no functionality at the moment to fork with boxes which use custom names for vagrant file and dot file.

f.e. im using it to place two separate box in the same directory and run them with command

```
VAGRANT_VAGRANTFILE=Vagrantfile.centos6 VAGRANT_DOTFILE_PATH=.vagrant_centos6 vagrant up
VAGRANT_VAGRANTFILE=Vagrantfile.centos7 VAGRANT_DOTFILE_PATH=.vagrant_centos7 vagrant up
```

Because of vagrantfiles have different name then "Vagrantfile", **Vagrant Manager** doesn't detect that boxes. Also **Vagrant Manager** don't have functionality to configure name of Vagrantfile.
Would love to be able to chose a different editor other than TextEdit when editing a Vagrantfile.

Would it be possible to add VMware AppCatalyst as a Vagrant provider? All state information is accessible through their REST API a la prlctl and vboxmanage. AppCatalyst is handy because it runs VMware boxes headless without a Fusion / Vagrant plugin license.

To get available VMs:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/vms
["vagrant-d3f0c18f-75ee-4990-8cf2-8ef757813b22"]
```

To get power state:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/vms/power/vagrant-d3f0c18f-75ee-4990-8cf2-8ef757813b22
{"code":200,"message":"powered on"}
```

Everything else should be reasonably close to the vmware_fusion implementation.

My everyday user account on OS X is not an admin, as a matter of general security. Some Vagrant machines require me to put in my Admin password – such as before altering the Hosts file on Up or Halt – but there's no opportunity to use a different user, so the password fails because I'm not an admin.

When doing this in Terminal, I would probably just su in before running vagrant up. Perhaps Vagrant Manager could allow something similar?

Hi there,
Reading http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/other/environmental-variables.html I can specify a different place to store the virtual machines and the vagrant boxes using environmental variables.

When I'm on a terminal, I specify it, and have it different for each "bookmark"/Vagrantfile set of servers. However, with Vagrant Manager I can't specify it per Vagrantfile/bookmark.

Not sure what is involved, but it would be great to specify the desired profile to be opened with iTerm.

I wrote a bash script which automatically adds new .conf files for new pages and activates them. But it needs the sites name as a parameter. I would be nice if I could specify the "Custom Command" with an request for input data.

Atm. I prompt that in the Terminal, but a Input field or any prompt in the app would be great.

Any thoughts about that ?
