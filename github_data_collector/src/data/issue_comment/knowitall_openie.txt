I can't understand the sentense in Some(Context()). And what 'List([385,412))))' means?
Hello, I have a question for columnated format.

For the example: U.S. president Barack Obama gave his inaugural address on January 20, 2013.

we want to get information like:

```
(Barack Obama; is president of; U.S.)
(Barack Obama; gave; [his inaugural address, on January 20, 2013])
```

however, my output is:

```
U.S. president Barack Obama gave his inaugural address on January 20, 2013.
0.8926589187155131      SimpleArgument(U.S. president Barack Obama,List([0, 27)))   Relation(gave,List([28, 32)))   SimpleArgument(his inaugural address,List([33, 54)))    U.S. president Barack Obama gave his inaugural address on January 20, 2013.
0.9485479188231729      SimpleArgument(U.S. president Barack Obama,List([0, 27)))   Relation(gave his inaugural address on,List([28, 32), [33, 54), [55, 57)))  TemporalArgument(January 20,List([58, 68))) U.S. president Barack Obama gave his inaugural address on January 20, 2013.
0.8847999636040884      SimpleArgument(Barack Obama,List([15, 27))) Relation([is] president [of],List([5, 14))) SimpleArgument(United States,List([0, 4)))  U.S. president Barack Obama gave his inaugural address on January 20, 2013.
```

How can I remove the class name for further process?
Besides, it seems that --binary option does not work

Thank you, :) 

In Ollie it was possible to train the confidence function.
Is the same feature available here?
