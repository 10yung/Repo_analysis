It seems like you don't need to store ```visibleItemCount```, ```totalItemCount``` and ```firstVisibleItem``` as member variables of the listener, since they are recalculated on every invocation of ```onScrolled``` and aren't used anywhere else.
Also, I guess it is a good coding practice to store ```VISIBLE_THRESHOLD```  as a ```const val``` in the listener's ```companion object```
- Use compile SDK version 28
- Gradle 5.1.1
- Use new version of Kotlin Coroutine 1.2.1
