There are many type of  lbp features and which was choosed in this joint-bayes?
How to get 5900 dimension  lbp feature ? How to understand 5900?

Thank you very much.
Su = np.cov(u.T, rowvar=False)

here u mean Su is the covariance matrix of u, 
but according to the paper, Su is covariance of x.

your matlab code caused all joint bayesian on git hub are wrong~
matrix A and G should be nonnegative positive semi-definite.
 I used zero-centered feature(not the face data) to train, but I got A and G which are not positive semi-definite.
what could be the problem?

hi
    I am using your excellent idea to processing some data, but I got an error.
    When run to line: "if norm(Sw - oldSw)/norm(Sw)<1e-6", the Sw=0 and then the result become "NAN" ã€‚

```
Can you help me fix it out or tell me is my data illegal to get this result ?
Thanks very much.

After running your script,  it is only 66%.
