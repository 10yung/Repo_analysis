Hello,

Getting a horific VBoxManage error while at `==> vccw.test: Booting VM` stage. 
Wondering where to find help for this situation.
Do not know where to look for help.
Is this a Vagrant, VirtualBox or VCCW issue?
Which forum should this question be sent too?

Meanwhile, successfully installed [another random vagrant box](https://app.vagrantup.com/laravel/boxes/homestead-7) and was able to run both `vagrant up` and `vagrant ssh` commands on that box,  It seems like vagrant is setup properly. 

Any clues appreciated.
Thank you.


Output of VCCW listed below.
==========================
```
antho@DESKTOP-LHRUNLM MINGW64 ~/Documents/vagrant/vccw
$ vagrant up
Bringing machine 'vccw.test' up with 'virtualbox' provider...

There was an error while executing `VBoxManage`, a CLI used by Vagrant
for controlling VirtualBox. The command and stderr is shown below.

Command: ["startvm", "88425bd1-8d24-44d2-a17c-c5c69e95690e", "--type", "headless"]

Stderr: VBoxManage.exe: error: Failed to open/create the internal network 'HostInterfaceNetworking-VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter' (VERR_INTNET_FLT_IF_NOT_FOUND).

My computer configuration
==========================

- Operating System: Win10x64
- Vagrant Version:  2.2.6
- Virtual Box Version: 6.0.14 r133895 (Qt5.6.2)

how do we set what PHP to use in the default.yml ? before we hit vagrant reload --provision?

That's the place to set it right?

using this doesint work,
composers:

phpunit/phpunit:7.3
squizlabs/php_codesniffer:~2.0
wp-coding-standards/wpcs:*
it just makes version like this:
7.0.26-2+ubuntu16.04.1+deb.sury.org+2

Another question:
Also when i tried to do 'vagrant reload --provision' it deleted my database which was very unfortunate. Any idea how to update php to 7.3 without deleting the database?


Operating System: Ubuntu 19.04
Vagrant Version: 2.2.4
Virtual Box Version: 6.0.6_Ubuntur129722

When you try to send an email with accents the following error is triggered:

Actually the solution is really easy but I'm not that technical in vagrant provisioning:

My Mailcatcher is not working. Is there any log to diagnose this?

When I installed, in first time works. But after a second `vagrant up`, I can't access http://{myurl}:1080 and it gives a ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED error in browser.
I can't find instructions on enabling a multisite in VCCW. How can I do that? I've tried to enable it by adding the `wp_allow_multisite: true` entry to the `site.yml` file but it doesn't work. I can't find Tools -> Network Setup option in the WordPress menu.
Check for .git directory in shared folder, suppress destructive actions on provision if it is a git repo. Most users will not notice any change, but users that put their own WordPress repo (git) in the shared folder will notice that it stays the same on provision.
Operating System: OSX 10.14.3
Vagrant Version: 2.2.4
Virtual Box Version: 6.0.4 r128413

Whenever i try to upload a image it gives me the following error:
[image].png
An error occurred in the upload. Please try again later.

In my hosts file the ip is added as:
192.168.33.10  vccw.test  # VAGRANT: 8c946ab570f7ca07b58c888b0901508d (vccw.test) / 30a27543-0f54-4391-bee3-9049e5bc6e6c

Does anyone have clue on how to fix this?

I moved my project to another computer after having done alot of changes etc. 

When I "vagrant up" and provision I want to keep the vm and wp install, db, edits etc. exactly how they were before on the other computer - however, the database keeps on getting dropped. 

Is there a way to edit the site.yml file so that I don't keep on having this problem. 

I have "reset_db_on_provision: false" in the site.yml file , but that didn't seem to help at all. 

Any help would be appreciated - I really like working with VCCW by the way! Thanks for all your hard work!
