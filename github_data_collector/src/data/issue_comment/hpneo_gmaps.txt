Hey guys and Owner..

Is this project still maintained?

Let me know,

Thanks
Is this project using continuous integration services (e.g., Travis-CI or Jenkings)? Or has it used at any point of its lifetime?
//This is a Hybrid Map. Map works fine on all browsers except Internet explorer (Loads a blank page)
//Window.onload does not seem to get triggered on IE.

- OLD way (won't work after Jul 16th 2018.):
`<script type="text/javascript" src="//maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true"></script>
`
- NEW:
`<script type="text/javascript" src="//maps.google.com/maps/api/js?key=(PASTE-YOUR-GOOGLE-MAP-APY-KEY-HERE)"></script>
`

- Get your new Google Map API key at:
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/maps-backend.googleapis.com

You can check whether your gmaps.js uses New API Access with this Google official Chrome extension.
"Google Maps Platform API Checker"

I am getting this message " Use two fingers to move the map" on mobile devices on the integration of gmaps.js. Bit explored, and found that 

gestureHandling: 'greedy'

is not implemented. Can you please give me any direction how to achieve map movement on mobile devices with a single finger

Hi,

How do you properly destroy a map, to free up the memory?  I have an app I'm working, and it annoyingly requires me to re-init the map every time (as the div its showing in, is a popup modal that doesn't remain in the DOM). As such, I want to make sure I clean out the map from memory when closing the modal the users use. I can't find anything about destroying it though in the documents?

Thanks

Andy
I am trying to use this with my angular project and unfortunately, there is no documentation or _how to?_ for that.
Also, I prefer using this because working with a Metronic template and they've used this.

So, first of all, it'd be great if someone can assist on how to use gmaps with an angular (angular2 or 4 or 5) application.
Basically, I just want to get the map data of a selected place. Initially the latitude and the longitude.
Hi friends . 
I just want to know how to add a mouseover event to an overlay ?

Hi,
Thanks a lot for this great package !
Please, is there a possibility to se icon (exp : car) for travelRoute to show it moving ?

Cdt.
I'm using this tool to get Lat+Lon data of a given point in a form, BUT, it could be VERY usefull if we can get those values in UTM. I dont know if a conversion function could be added directly to the library or what, but i think that this would be a very interesting utility. Thanks for such a good work!
