I'm now trying the same with TWRP 3.1.1-0
DAR (Disk ARchive) is an archiving library that may be more interesting that TAR.

It support the same feature as the current implementation:
- compression (gzip, bzip2, lzo, xz or lzma)
- encryption (password or certificat)
- archive split

The libraries also support:
- full backup OR differential backup
- support Linux file Extended Attributes
- ACL support
- hashing on the fly, not after so we can detect if the archive is corrupted during write to disk
- filesystem specific attributes (for some fs)
- **archive repair**

[Official documentation](http://dar.linux.free.fr/doc/Features.html) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dar_(disk_archiver)).

If TeamWin is interested but don't want to work on that now, I may have time in 2020 to test a basic implementation. But I won't start that if it's not an interesting features for the recovery.

Happy New Year :D

What should I do in this case?

Device: Oneplus 5
Twrp downloaded from: https://dl.twrp.me/cheeseburger/
Problem: Twrp recovery not recognizing the phone's password.

**z2_row**
**3.3.1-0-z2_row**

#### WHAT STEPS WILL REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM?
Have TWRP access encrypted partitions.

#### WHAT IS THE EXPECTED RESULT?
Mounted partitions can be accessed through USB cable via mtp or if ADB sideload activated, able to talk with the phone using the adb commands.

#### WHAT HAPPENS INSTEAD?
Device isn't detected by Windows (tested with Windows 10 host, but also Windows 7 VM) nor Linux host (OpenSUSE LEAP)

#### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
When flashing TWRP 3.2.3-1-z2_row, device is detected by Windows/Linux. However, decrypting the partitions does not work in this release.

I have to downgrade to TWRP 3.2.3-1 if I want to completely wipe the device and load a new ROM on the phone. After installation is finished, upgrade recovery again to 3.3.1-0 to be able to access the filesystem if a ROM upgrade zip got downloaded OTA. (Running Mokee 90.0)

Did something considerable change on kernel / available drivers or modules level change between 3.2 and 3.3 ?

**Device codename**:  walleye 
**TWRP version**: 3.3.0-0

#### WHAT STEPS WILL REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM?
If I create a backup with TWRP and restore from it, Android hangs on boot. Confirmed working with Magisk 19.3, fails with any higher version.
Magisk developer claims that it's not related to Magisk itself, so probably it's a TWRP issue. Related Magisk issue [here](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/issues/2171)

#### WHAT IS THE EXPECTED RESULT?
Android restores from backup successfully and boots fine.

#### WHAT HAPPENS INSTEAD?
The system hangs on boot.

#### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Magisk related issue has some additional info, check logcat.txt og the failed boot.

**Device codename**: raphael
**TWRP version**: 3.3.1.-0

#### WHAT STEPS WILL REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM?
Try to make backup of /data after installing some apps and using the phone for a few days

#### WHAT IS THE EXPECTED RESULT?
The backup succeeds

#### WHAT HAPPENS INSTEAD?
The backup fails with error "error: process createTarFork ended with ERROR 255"

#### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
There are actually a few another bug reports about this problem, but it exists already for a long time, and i just would like to say, that i also have this error. I dont know exactly since when it happens, but i am sure for 1,5 years if not more. I have few devices (Google Pixel 2, Mi 9T Pro), and on both i am unable to normally make or restore backup. This error comes just every time, and every time there is a different file as reason in the log file, and every time i must uninstall a bunch of apps, to complete backup or restore and then reinstall them again. There is also a bunch of theads and questions on XDA, a lot of people also exeperiencing this problem. So its definitely not a problem of my device / ROM. I undestand that you are a free project, and only a small procent of people who using TWRP donates to you, but please, at least try to fix this. Its just a nightmare, its so hard every time to make a backup.
