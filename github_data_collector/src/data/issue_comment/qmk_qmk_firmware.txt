## Description

This adds QMK Firmware support for the PloopyCo Trackball to the repo, as the first mouse/trackball. (fight me)

This mostly works. However, the scroll wheel is a problem, and likely due to noisy optical sensors.   
Unfortunately, it's a bit beyond me to be able to fix that, or ... convert the arduino code that has been added "recently".   Everything else works, though.
