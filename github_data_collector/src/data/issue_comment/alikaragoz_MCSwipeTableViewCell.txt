Add `rightFirstTrigger`, `rightSecondTrigger`, `leftFirstTrigger` and `leftSecondTrigger` properties to `MCSwipeTableViewCell` to make #81 "Different swipe percentages for left vs right" possible.

This fix is backward compatible, and you can still use `firstTrigger` and `secondTrigger` properties.

Fixing up some warnings, no big deal.

This feature helps not swipe separator for example or other elements on cell.
/** Delegate of `MCSwipeTableViewCell` */
`@property (nonatomic, assign) id <MCSwipeTableViewCellDelegate> delegate;`


Change
[view.layer renderInContext:UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()];

To: 
[view drawViewHierarchyInRect:view.bounds afterScreenUpdates:YES];

It runs much faster. From my tests on my app it went from 0.625468s  to 0.014225.

Heres is a better explanation on possible choices and it has a link to why it is better:

It will be more awesome if we can have more than one action buttons on swiping. 
Eg. Instagram comment cell which on swipe provides multiple action buttons eg. "Reply", "Delete", "Report" etc. 

Instead of setting the default color on the cell itself, allow customizing the default color for each swipe. This is useful if you have more than one swipe gesture on a single cell (e.g. a left and a right swipe) and you want to show the same color background whether the trigger point has been reached or not.
