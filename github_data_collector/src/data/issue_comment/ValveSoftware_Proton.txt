1. Play Budget Cuts
2. Reach the Showroom level (or start a new game from there)

Game performs as it has up to this point.

<!-- Please add `PROTON_LOG=1 %command%` to the game's launch options and drag

## Symptoms <!-- What's the problem? -->

Both left and right eyes render on the left eye viewport.

## Reproduction

Boot the game.

## Workaround

This can be fixed by using winecfg to reconfigure the Proton bottle to Windows 10. People report that the same bug exists on Windows 7, so this is not a bug in wine but still requires a compatibility profile to fix as Proton currently defaults to Win7.

# Compatibility Report

- Steam AppID of the game: 1198740

## System Information
- GPU: AMD R9 Fury
- Driver/LLVM version: mesa-aco-git / LLVM 9.0
- Kernel version: 5.4.8
- Link to full system information report as [Gist](https://gist.github.com/brandonegbert/32af2fb9b98196f153ad5be79b726d7e):
- Proton version: 4.11-12

## I confirm:
- [x] that I haven't found an existing compatibility report for this game.
- [x] that I have checked whether there are updates for my system available.

<!-- Please add `PROTON_LOG=1 %command%` to the game's launch options and drag
and drop the generated `$HOME/steam-$APPID.log` into this issue report -->

## Symptoms <!-- What's the problem? -->
Fails to launch with "Error opening data\default\default_gradient.dds".  Requested that I send a bug report which I did but was sure to note that it was via Proton on Linux.

## Reproduction
Launch the game
# Feature Request

## I confirm:
- [X] that I haven't found another request for this feature.
- [x] that I have checked whether there are updates for my system available that
      contain this feature already.

## Description: What do you want to be added? 
Instead of fiddling with the Steam client and the terminal to figure out where my `proton_dist.tar` tarball is and why it's not there;
Instead of attempting the massive journey of compiling Proton myself and running out of SSD in the process;
I suggest we have binary Proton distributions available via Github.

## Justification [optional]: Why integration in Proton instead of Wine?
```
~$ sudo apt-get install wine
```
Or at least make Proton independently downloadable!

# Compatibility Report
- Name of the game with compatibility issues: TrenchesWIP

## System Information
- GPU: NVIDIA Corporation GeForce GTX 1060 3GB/PCIe/SSE2

[steam-1118920.log](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/files/4056162/steam-1118920.log)

## Symptoms <!-- What's the problem? -->
When trying to run TrenchesWIP using Proton 4.11-11 on Ubuntu Linux, a pop-up appears saying "DX12 is not supported on your system. Try running without the -dx12 or -d3d12 command line argument." I tried to Set Launch Options to `PROTON_NO_D3D11=1 %command%` , and it results in no more pop-up warning, but it only shows it's running for a few seconds, but then never starts and goes back to the Library - that is the log attached. The pop-up appears with PROTON_USE_D9VK and PROTON_USE_WINED3D options separately.

## Reproduction
Force TrenchesWIP to use Proton 4.11-11, or any Proton version - tested all available in options with same results including Proton 4.11-11, 4.2-9, 3.16-9, 3.7-8.

[steam-644830-ignore.log](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/files/4050956/steam-644830-ignore.log)


## Symptoms <!-- What's the problem? -->
When launching the game, it immediately crashes with the following message: "Failed to execute Vulkan command 'result' (file 'D:\BuildAgents\buildAgent_pc\work\git_checkout_per_agent_branch\FledgeRenderer\renderer\src\vulkan\FledgeRendererSystemVulkan.cpp' in line '353'), returned: VK_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_DRIVER' "
This is what it looks like:
![2020-01-12-130823_330x126_scrot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17114382/72223555-1da7c480-353e-11ea-803a-53f0a65084f9.png)


It presents this in a window with three options: Abort, Retry, and Ignore. Abort will just close the window and stop the game from running. Retry and Ignore both do the same thing. The game will technically be running, seeing as I can see the .exe running in top, but it doesn't actually launch into a playable or viewable state (just a process running in the background). After a minute or two, that process ends and the game quits. Above, the first log is from an abort, and the second is from an Ignore.

## Reproduction
Launch the game.
