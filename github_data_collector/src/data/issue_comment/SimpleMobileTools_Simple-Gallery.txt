Example: the video is 16:9, the device is 18:9 so the leftmost part of the bottom bar is in the white area displayed because of the light theme.

Visibility is fine on the dark theme.

F-Droid marked your app with `This app has features you may not like: NoSourceSince`.
Do you know why and how to fix this? :)

Is this, because of the license change? Or because of the new photo editor?

Latest release was 6.10.8 on F-Droid.

It seems to be that the double tap zoom doesn't work if fit to screen is the same as native size.

Example1: 1200x1314 png image on an sony experia z2 (1200x1920 resolution)
If the device is in portrait orientation, so the the width of the image and the the device match, nothing happens on a double tap. If the device is turned to landscape orientation (so that neither resolution match the screen), zoom defaults to fit to screen and double tap cycles between fit to width, native size and back to fit to screen/height.
Expectation: In the above portrait case, the double tap should cycle fit to height, and fit to screen/width (which in this case is native size)

Example2: 1000x1920 png image
Same behaviovior as above, just that the default/native now is fit to height.

In both examples, if manually zooming just a bit, double tap will cycle through the expected fit to height/width before getting stuck in native again.

Version tested: v 6.11.4 Pro, from playstore.
I tried to play some video files on Android 10, using the new gesture based navigation. When doing so, the video plays fine, but the seek bar at the bottom (where you can jump to a certain point/time in the video) does not show for me.

When I try to fiddle around the bottom area to make it show, I only get the Android 10 gesture bar behavior, but not the seek bar.

Is this a setting I missed somewhere, I could not find it yet in the  app or the FAQ so far.
Steps for reproducing according to the reporter:
1. Go to Discord or probably any app
2. Attach a picture
3. Use Gallery to find the picture
4. Select a folder
5. Filter for only GIFs and videos
6. Cancel
7. Come back later and open Gallery
8. Change filter back to everything
9. All pictures are un-favorited and almost all folders are unpinned
Would be nice to add content providers to included folders similar to adding USB drives. For example google drive provides one: ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/smaufPX.jpg)

  
Opening the editor seemingly opens a new empty black screen what automatically closes, opens up a second time, then returns the gallery with the same initial image opened.

_(Hi from GooglePlay, thanks for answering to my review, i moved this here because that way of communication is rather bad)_
Sometimes when you "temporarily show hidden folders" they show but you click them and the photos inside don't appear. Even if you wait. Kinda annoying to be quite honest, hope to see it get fixed.

Android Pie, LGv40
The 1:1 zoom doesn't work when an images width and height are equal
