Hello.
Our provider seems to be analyzing domain names through an http \ https request for 443 and 80 ports.

Is it possible to somehow configure the OpenVPN server so that with an http / https request on port 443 and 80 it will issue a website or redirect to some popular website.

Please tell me what to read on this topic, what to study in order to implement this.

Or is there an option for someone to perform this work remotely.

Thanks.

Great work, i just have a minor issue. Debian 10 + systemd + nftables....

it still uses iptables, would it be possible to add support for nftables too? 
I've configured the open-vpn client like other 3rd party vpn,I have several open vpn on my pf (PIA),
I have same config with the match security algorithm,encryption,etc, 
the vpn client won't connect to the phase 1?
any steps I should follow ? 
by the way am looking to make a whole network vpn,like my PIA vpn, 
Hello. I have problem with Debian 10 and Ubuntu 18.04. After installation on clean debian 10 or Ubuntu 18.04 network speed over openvpn is slow, looks like it cutting to  max 50Mbis/s, but if install it on Debian 9 or ubuntu 16.04 speed is ok more than 100Mbit/s. I used different port and different vps(KVM) or dedi but speed is not ok on debian 10. Even if install on debian 9 and upgrade to debian 10 bug exist.

Test network speed with iperf3 over VPN
`iperf3 -c 10.8.0.1 -t40 -R -p5331`

Bug can be seen on
netcup VPS 200 G8 (on debian 9 100Mbits/s, on debian 10 30-50Mbit/s)
online.net Start-2-S-SATA (Paris and Amsterdam) (on debian 9 100Mbits/s, on debian 10 30-50Mbit/s)
online.net Start-2-S-SSD (test only Amsterdam) (on debian 9 100Mbits/s, on debian 10 30-50Mbit/s)
Virmach (USA, NY / DE) (on debian 9 100Mbits/s, on debian 10 30-50Mbit/s)



Please, take a look at it. I think not only this providers have that bug.
This problem has been solved.
I add  tun-mtu 1388 both server and client config. 
the 1388 is tested by ping -s 1360 -D ip -c 1. os is archinux.
Hello,

This might not be an "issue" but I did not found any other place to ask for it. Might just be a feature request. 

Can Gigabit Network mode as seen in https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Gigabit_Networks_Linux be enabled as an option while installing the OpenVPN with your script?

Thank you for your attention.

R. 
 i use ubuntu 16 nut this script not work 
this scrip create ovpn but i can't connect to server by windows and ubuntu 16

my client: windows, android, linux (ubuntu 16)

my server: ubuntu 16.0.4 

my config: default 



Hi there,

first, thanks alot for your script, been using it several years now.

Now ive got issues using your script with debian 10.

When creating a new user the <tls-crypt> part is empty, so its not possible to import it in any openvpn client.

I think it has something todo with the line:
openvpn --genkey --secret /etc/openvpn/tls-crypt.key
in your script.

any workarounds here?
