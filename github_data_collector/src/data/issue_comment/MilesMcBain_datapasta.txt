An error occures when copying tables that contain cyrillic letter "я". For example, this table can be easily copied:

English | Russian
-- | --
London | Лондон
Paris | Париж
Rome | Рим

while this table produces an error "Text could not be parsed as table." in RStudio: 

English | Russian
-- | --
London | Лондон
Paris | Париж
Reykjavík | Рейкьявик

When I remove letter "я" from the last cell, it works well:

English | Russian
-- | --
London | Лондон
Paris | Париж
Reykjavík | Рейкь*вик

The example given in the intro:

```
iris %>%
     head() %>%
     dmdclip()
```

results in this:

```
data.frame(
  Sepal.Length = c(5.1, 4.9, 4.7, 4.6, 5, 5.4),
   Sepal.Width = c(3.5, 3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.6, 3.9),
  Petal.Length = c(1.4, 1.4, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 1.7),
   Petal.Width = c(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4),
           Species = as.factor(c("setosa",
                                 "setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa"))
    )
```

... rather than markdown-formatted output.
Only just come across this great addin. Will be really useful!

However, I need to add that this is quite an important issue. Many official reports, especially those with budgets involved, quote numbers with the thousands separator (e.g. www.sfc.ac.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=19286&sID=11697). 

There's a locale issue here also. In most continental European countries the comma is used as the decimal point marker.

Both of the above don't work well without manual intervention.

When I try to create a vector from space-delimited values I get this error when using Fiddle Selection:

```
Error in rstudioapi::modifyRange(doc_context$range, text = vector_form) : 
  object 'vector_form' not found
```
Simple example is to type `-1 2` into the console, mark it and execute Fiddle Selection. When I remove the leading `-` it works.
Closes #61.

Simple fix to `guess_sep` to allow space to be used as a separator. Tested with the example provided.

```r
to RealAge
513 59.608
513 84.18
0 85.23
119 74.764
116 65.356
data.frame(
          to = c(513L, 513L, 0L, 119L, 116L),
     RealAge = c(59.608, 84.18, 85.23, 74.764, 65.356)
)
tibble::tribble(
   ~to, ~RealAge,
  513L,   59.608,
  513L,    84.18,
    0L,    85.23,
  119L,   74.764,
  116L,   65.356
  )
```

Also modified a test file for use with this

```r
datapasta:::guess_sep(readr::read_lines(file = "tests/testthat/brisbane_weather_empty_lines_spaces.txt"))
#> [1] " "
```
Closes #39.

Added as a branch of the `dt_paste` PR because I wasn't sure how it would interact (diff will reduce significantly once that PR is merged).

Extracts (all) factor levels and pastes them into the `factor` (not `as.factor`) call.

```r
head(iris) %>% df_paste()
data.frame(
   Sepal.Length = c(5.1, 4.9, 4.7, 4.6, 5, 5.4),
    Sepal.Width = c(3.5, 3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.6, 3.9),
   Petal.Length = c(1.4, 1.4, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 1.7),
    Petal.Width = c(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4),
        Species = factor(c("setosa", "setosa", "setosa", "setosa", "setosa",
                           "setosa"), levels = c("setosa", "versicolor",
                           "virginica"))
)
```

Please test thoroughly before merging.
Hi
This is cool.  However, at work we use RStudio Server.  When I try pasting with RStudio Server I just get the following:

`Clipboard is not available. Is xsel or xclip installed? Is DISPLAY set?`

It this a technical limitation with remote execution?  Will it only work on a local desktop?


Cheers
Based on https://gist.github.com/noamross/0cb3708e72c4f18c5ab747a1609468b7
Minimal breaking example:

```
c(Name,Location,Part of)
```
Is this possible? From the manual and my poking around, it didn't seem to be. But maybe I missed something?

If it is not possible to use these functions outside RStudio, could I ask this as a feature request please?

Thank you!
