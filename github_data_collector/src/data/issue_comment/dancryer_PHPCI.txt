Detailed description of change:
I added a configurable text input for changing the path where the phpci.yml can be found.

I need it for storing different build settings for the same project to my GIT repo. If the field is empty, or a configuration cannot be found the PHPCI defaults will run (look for a file names phpci.yml, .phpci.xml etc.)

The online WIKI says anyone can edit via GitHub. Is this safe and gets validated by anyone?

### Expected behaviour

- *Detailed step by step instruction about the installation and setup.*

### Actual behaviour

- *Missing steps such as renaming of htaccess and configuration details such as phpci.yaml.*
- *Location of phpci.yaml is not explicitly defined.*
- *Examples of directory and file structures.*

To help us better understand your issue, please answer the following.

### Expected behaviour

There is no option to pass -s to php-parallel-lint, so even if the server supports php shorttags, the linter will fail if you use shorttags.

### Actual behaviour

php-parallel-lint will fail with various php parse errors like unexpected end of file if you open an if statement in a <?php section (typically the opening line of the file?) and close it in a <? section.

### Steps to reproduce

```php
<?php
if (true): ?>
Hello PHPCI
<? endif; ?>
```

### Environment info
Operating System: Debian GNU/Linux 7.11 (wheezy)
PHP Version: 5.6.31
MySQL Version: n/a

### PR 
https://github.com/Block8/PHPCI/pull/1338

I would like to ask, if there is any way to change admin credentials after the installation is done. 

The reason I need this is [this](https://github.com/it-herz/docker-phpci) docker image, which seems to be the only one working. It does not support any credentials settings, and looking through code, I did not find any `phpci:install` command, where I could change credentials. 

The image seems to use `phpci:update` for installation, and this command provides no way to choose credentials (as far as I found). 

The author of image is not responding, so I decided to ask you. Since I did not find any IRC, or other way to ask you, I am submitting an issue.

Detailed description of change:

When working with GIT webhooks every commit of every contributor triggers a build in PHPCI. As I have very time consuming acceptance tests with Codeception and my contributors are pushing a lot of stuff PHPCI is always very busy. For me there is no need to run all tests for every commit on every branch. Important for me is my master branch and my release candidate branches where I put all branches of my contributors together to see if it works. 
So I've added a textarea with the name "observed_branches" to the project configuration page. 
Before a build is triggered via webhook by WebhookController::createBuild I check if the requestet branch is in the projects branch observation by getting the text from "observed_branches" and exploding it by PHP_EOL. After that I'll check if the branch name submitted by the webhook is in my exploded array. If not I will not create the build. 
If the project option "observed_branches" is empty all incoming branch names are triggering a build creation as it is now.
You may also use the * sign as a wildcard for branch names when configuring the "observed_branches" option, as I use this for my RC branches. For example a configuration like 

```
master
rc-*
```
would accept a build creation via webhook for the "master" branch and all branch names starting with "rc-"

Maybe this can be helpful to others.
