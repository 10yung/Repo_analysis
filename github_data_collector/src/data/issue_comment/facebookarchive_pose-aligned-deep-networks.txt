Hello 
 I am trying to run your PANDA code on my data; however, I have problem to download poslet detection code as well as data set provided on GitHub page for this source code. I was wondering if you have any suggestion for me to deal with this problem.
Thanks.

helllow ! How to run this code ..Kindly provide me mannual,

Thank you for putting the code up.

I noticed that init.m adds several directories to the path, including ./detector and ./detector/poselet_detection. However, it doesn't seem like there are any such directories in the repo. Maybe this is just an outdated path that has been fixed in later work.

However, also create_training_directory.m calls function generate_poselet_hits. I get an undefined  function fault at that point. It has a similar name to generate_poselet_hits_and_patches, and seems to take the same few arguments (a data object, a model, and a config object), so I made that simple substitution. But that causes a halt on line 16, since generate_poselet_hits_and_patches expects data to have a .phits property.

Did I make a mistake, and generate_poselet_hits is not interchangeable with generate_poselet_hits_and_patches? Is the former in the directories that appear to be missing?

Sorry if these questions are very simple; I'm only just beginning with this type of work, so I might have just overlooked something obvious.

Thanks for putting the code up on Github!

I was trying to reproduce the result but got an error from get_iccv_data.m that `trainvaltest.txt` is not found. I downloaded the dataset from https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/shape/poselets/attributes_dataset.tgz. Is that file generated from another function, or should I download the dataset from another link?

Thank you again!
