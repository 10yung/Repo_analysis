which version of fluent should I use for fluent.sender?
in getting-started.md
# start the FaaS server 
$ cd functions && python3 function_server.py 

I can't find function_server.py , only have server.py in the directory.
When I use the command "python3 server.py" to start the script,  I get errors as follows:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "server.py", line 20, in <module>
    from benchmarks.server import *
  File "/xxx/fluent-master/functions/benchmarks/server.py", line 7, in <module>
    from . import composition
  File "/xxx/fluent-master/functions/benchmarks/composition.py", line 6, in <module>
    from include.functions_pb2 import *

Thanks!
This has proven difficult/impossible. As a result, adding Anna lattice types requires recompilation, and potentially code changes. 


Currently the system operates at either causal mode or non-causal mode.
Refactor the codebase so that it can support both with a single build.

Currently, durable PUT is implemented by letting the client issuing multiple PUT requests to servers that hold replicas. These servers, however, will again gossip the payload to each other, which is redundant. We should eliminate these gossips to improve performance.
Currently, all keys are gossipped under the same gossip period. Ideally, we should adjust the gossip frequency based on the access frequency. Hot keys will be gossipped more often and cold keys less often.
Currently, the monitoring system runs single node single threaded, which could be a bottleneck when we increase the scale of the workload. We should make it multi-threaded and distributed!
