Currently the rescue alignment cop has an issue on variable assignments where it enforces this style:
```
return_val = begin
  # computation
             rescue
               # rescued value
end
```
which is bad. 

https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/pull/7531 will maybe fix it, but I think it makes sense to disable this for now until it's fixed in a rubocop release.
Adds `indented_relative_to_receiver` as a valid option for `Layout/MultilineMethodCallIndentation`.

Hi!

Added additional detail to style guide regarding the use of map and collect. 
Closes airbnb/ruby#101.
Which is the preferred style?

```Ruby
# 1
return I18n.t('Guest Profile Page: A note for the Host saying the potential Guest has '\
              'not cancelled a reservation since joining Airbnb.',
              :default => '%{guest_name} hasn’t canceled a reservation since joining '\
                          'Airbnb',
              :guest_name => @user.smart_name)
```

or

```Ruby
# 2
return I18n.t('Guest Profile Page: A note for the Host saying the potential Guest has '\
              'not cancelled a reservation since joining Airbnb.',
              :default => '%{guest_name} hasn’t canceled a reservation since joining '\
                          'Airbnb',
              :guest_name => @user.smart_name,
)
```

or

```Ruby
# 3
return I18n.t(
  'Guest Profile Page: A note for the Host saying the potential Guest has '\
  'not cancelled a reservation since joining Airbnb.',
  :default => '%{guest_name} hasn’t canceled a reservation since joining '\
              'Airbnb',
  :guest_name => @user.smart_name,
)
```

or

```Ruby
# 4
return I18n.t(
  'Guest Profile Page: A note for the Host saying the potential Guest has '\
  'not cancelled a reservation since joining Airbnb.',
  :default => '%{guest_name} hasn’t canceled a reservation since joining '\
              'Airbnb',
  :guest_name => @user.smart_name
)
```

Hi! :D

I've decided to translate this guide into Spanish on behalf of @ruby-ve, greatly inspired by the work of @1c7 on #102

Just one question: Should I translate the fork or is it better to create a new repo for the translation?

I found an example in this guide

```
def obliterate(things, options = {})
  default_options = {
    :gently => true, # obliterate with soft-delete
    :except => [], # skip obliterating these things
    :at => Time.now, # don't obliterate them until later
  }
  options.reverse_merge!(default_options)

  ...
end
```

I'm wondering whether this is a good practice. When you use this method, the input options hash might be modified by `reverse_merge!` method, which, in my opinion, is very error-prone process in a big project.
