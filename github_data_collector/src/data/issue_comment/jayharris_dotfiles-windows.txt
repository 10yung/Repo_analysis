Add support to the `vs` and `vsadmin` PowerShell commands to launch Visual Studio 2019. Use the location found in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\devenv.exe`
The `bootstrap` command will copy all of the repository files to their appropriate location. Create a reverse file that will gather scripts back into a local repository directory. This will be useful for when modifications to the scripts have been made in their primary locations and the changes should be persisted into the repository.
I use several VSSettings files, including one for a Single Monitor (on the road) and one for Multiple Monitors (at my desk). It would be great to have PoSh commands within Visual Studio's Package Manager Console to easily import VSSettings (rather than wasting time with the Import UI).

```
$dte.ExecuteCommand("Tools.ImportandExportSettings", "/import:""$path""")
```

When installing some node packages that use `node-gyp`, such as `node-inspector`, a `CodeTaskFactory` error is thrown by MSBuild.

> C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v14.0\CodeAnalysis\Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.targets(219,5): error MSB4175: The task factory "CodeTaskFactory" could not be loaded from the assembly "C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\bin\Microsoft.Build.Tasks.v12.0.dll". Could not load file or assembly 'file:///C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\bin\Microsoft.Build.Tasks.v12.0.dll' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.

This only occurs when the main Visual Studio is 2015, and not under 2013.
