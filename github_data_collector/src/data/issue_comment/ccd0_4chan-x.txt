Add an option/button to download all file formats in a thread. It's quite the  annoyance and unneeded hassle to press right click and save every image one by one when it could be implemented into 4chan-x. I'm suprised it hasn't been done yet. There has been a few similar requests but they are quite old. I know there are programs and extensions that already let you do this but they are complicated and confusing, it would be nice to have it in the script. Thank you

Is there a way to customize this so only few boards appear?

yuki.la's search URL looks something like this:
https://yuki.la/search.html?boards=%board&startdate=2008-02-02&enddate=2019-12-10&sort=descending&imagemd5=%MD5#page=1
The enddate value is fixed to a certain date and has to be changed manually to include today's archived pages in the search.
It would be easier if there were date placeholders like %Y, %m, and %d for the current year, month and day (eg: ...&enddate=%Y-%m-%d...).

What it says on the tin.
The blue wheel keeps spinning with no puzzle or whatever to complete.
Captcha only begins working again upon disabling the script.

I've tried reinstalling the script. Didn't help.
The default Webm volume under the header changes if you manipulate the volume from the controls of an expanded webm. The next video you open will play at the volume level the last video was raised to, even if it's higher or lower than the default.

Is there a way to keep the default volume independent from the player volume?

voca.ro seems to be the popular way for people to link vocaroo now, any way to make this embeddable?
