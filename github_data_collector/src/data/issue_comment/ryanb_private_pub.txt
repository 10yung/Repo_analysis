Nothing happens after this request.
When I try to curl faye with below command, I get success message
`curl http://localhost:9292/faye -d 'message={"channel":"/leads/agent_id_2", "data":"hello", "ext":{"private_pub_token":"oidb2d36a8c4b83db97dfh4147735829bc370036c0552e7d4eb945f9c90c4b"}}`

Response: 
`[{"channel":"/leads/agent_id_2","successful":true}]`
 But nothing happens at client side.
Can anyone please tell me what could be the reason behing 502 bad request? or overall configuration?
P.S I am using AWS & HTTPS
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Following this link
https://github.com/ryanb/private_pub#serving-faye-over-https-with-thin
I have configured my thin and faye server. When I run the server using
`thin -C config/private_pub_thin.yml start`
it is saying 

Listening on 0.0.0.0:4443, CTRL+C to stop
But when I hit the url in browser, "This page isn't working. didn't send any data."
Please help me in this.

This will prevent PrivatePub from subscribing to a channel multiple times.

I just got private chat working with private pub, but am having trouble differentiating between the sender and recipient of a message. When the message is published to the recipient, the sender class is applied to the message (the same problem that this user is having: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35989728/differentiate-users-with-private-pub )

Is there a solution to this problem that I missed?

Thanks

I am running application on localhost.following command I use to generate certificate and private key
`sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.key -out cert.crt`

following is my configuration on localmachine
`port: 9292`
`ssl: true`
`ssl_key_file: /home/bissa_c/cer/private.key`
`ssl_cert_file: /home/bissa_c/cer/cer.crt`
`environment: development`
`rackup: private_pub.ru`

command to run thin server
`thin -C config/private_pub_thin.yml start`

while post message on channel I am getting error  `SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed`

I am also running  my application with thin 
`thin start --ssl --ssl-key-file ~/cer/private.key --ssl-cert-file ~/cer/cer.crt`

Please help

I am having strange behavior of faye when I publish message from controller. It doesn't send message to 100% of channels subscribed. I mean if I open 20 tabs and send a message, the message does not always publish on all 20 tabs, instead it misses out some tabs.

I am using private pub gem version 1.0.3
I am using heruko app as faye server for implementation. Please help. 

Hello,

I`m using jbuilder to create json responses. Is there a way to publish jbuilder response? I tried to pass different things as second argument for publish_to class method, but nothing work.

If you specify the host like this:

```
development:
  server: "http://0.0.0.0:9292/faye"
  secret_token: "secret"
```

Then start a server with either `rackup` or `thin`, both will start it incorrectly:

```
thin -C config/private_pub.yml -e development start
Using rack adapter
Thin web server (v1.6.4 codename Gob Bluth)
Maximum connections set to 1024
Listening on 0.0.0.0:3000, CTRL+C to stop

rackup private_pub.ru -s thin -E development
Thin web server (v1.6.4 codename Gob Bluth)
Maximum connections set to 1024
Listening on localhost:9292, CTRL+C to stop
```

Of course I can override host/port for both, but seems like the issue described it's not a desired behaviour.

Hi. 
I can't work with the gem in production mode. In local mode it works fine.
In the page, when i try to put a message in the chat, nothing happens. 

I'm using nginx, passenger, thin.

Below it includes information that can be useful for support:

My private_pub.yml:

> development:
>   server: "http://192.168.1.48:9292/faye"
>   secret_token: "secret"
> test:
>   server: "http://192.168.1.48:9292/faye"
>   secret_token: "secret"
> production:
>   server: "http://181.160.190.149/faye"
> secret_token:"79301c39f07005f5e0ba58a4387c316c028d8c573fa3032b18c24d5ac35645935a64b93189eb19c514cfe34e0851a479b808041d32cd29735cfadd05f1a6f5c4"
>   signature_expiration: 3600 # one hour

In the nginx config I added a proxy:

> location  /faye {
>        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9292;
>        proxy_http_version 1.1;  
>            proxy_set_header Host $host;
>            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
>            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
>            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
>            proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
>            proxy_buffering off;
>            proxy_redirect off;
>            proxy_connect_timeout      90;
>            proxy_send_timeout         90;
>            proxy_read_timeout         90;
>            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
>            break;
>     }

Information about errors (when I try to put a message in the chat):

In the browser console:

> Failed to load resource the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error).

In the file production.log:
