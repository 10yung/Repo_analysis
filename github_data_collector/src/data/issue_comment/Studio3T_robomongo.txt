When using SSH tunnel to connect to DocumentDB in AWS, SSL does not appear to work. The following error occurs:

However, when using the same SSH tunnel with pymongo+tls, I am able to connect.

Hi,
When I want to edit a field of a document that has textual content (e. g. , Persian or Arabic), it does not display texts correct and legible.

.
**This problem only exists when editing:**

.
**Not when displaying information (Displays texts correctly):**

**information:**
```
OS: Windows 10 64bit Version 1903 (May 2019 Update)
Robo 3T Version: 1.3.1
MongoDB version: v4.2.1
```
Hi,

Here's my environment:
```
Robot 3T 1.3.1
MacOS 10.15.1

5 Nodes Replicaset
MongoDB 3.6.13

SSL is configured with a private CA
```

### What am I trying to do?
I'm trying to connect directly to a Secondary node of the replicaset - using `Direct Connection` - to a database and authenticating on another one.

This does work like a charm with mongodb cli, as expected with the `authSource`/`--authenticationDatabase` parameters.
But it doesn't when I use Robot 3T.

### What happens?
I've setup a standalone MongoDB with authentication enabled, an authentication database `authdb` and two other databases: `mydb` and `otherdb`.
I've setup a user named `benoit.bui` with the following accesses:
```
"roles" : [ 
    { "role" : "read", "db" : "mydb" }, 
    { "role" : "read", "db" : "otherdb" } ]
```
Here's captures of my configuration

With this configuration, authentication and connection does work but I end up on the `authdb` database, not `mydb` as specified on the `Default Database` setting in the `Advanced` toggle.

This does work with Studio 3T

This results to a scan of accessible databases:

I do have the same behaviour with MongoDB Compass, it scans accessible databases
<img width="1281" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/561357/72167117-d0efac80-33ca-11ea-8049-bf511aba6c26.png">

Am I missing something or did I misconfigure Robot 3T?

Thanks!



Implement clearer and more specific error when attempting to use an SSH tunnel with a private key in an incompatible format.

Newer versions of the Git software for Windows are shipping with a version of ssh-keygen which generates private keys in a new format by default rather than the previous default, PEM.

When using these incompatibly formatted keys, Robo3T should show an error that the key is in an invalid format, rather than a generic "Error - 16".
# Description
When paging between queried results or trying to increase the page size fails with an error.

## Expected results
Increasing the page size shows that number of documents. Navigating between pages shows that page of data.

## Actual results
Increasing page size fails and returns error `Unrecognized field: 'ntoreturn'`. Navigating between pages fails and returns error `Unrecognized field: 'ntoreturn'`.

## Notes
- DocumentDB cluster running engine **docdb 3.6.0**
- Connecting to Primary cluster endpoint
- SSL enabled
- SSH tunneling (ssh -> jumpbox -> documentdb)


I tried to type korean on query command window, but I can't type korean because of mal-functionality. (on Windows, not tested on Mac, Linux)

It keep removed previous word when I type korean.

I think it occur korean is multi-byte character. so It maybe occur on Chinese, Japanese, so on.

Please refer to below example about typing "로보몽고"(Korean) (It means RoboMongo)
```
ㄹ -> 로 -> 롭 -> 로보 -> 로봄 -> 로보모 -> 로보몽 -> 로보몽ㄱ -> 로보몽고
```
