I just did a fresh reinstall of youtube-dl-gui on Windows using the Windows installer. When I try to download a youtube video, the status says "Finished" while Percent says "0%" and the file doesn't appear. I'm guessing that youtube-dl is throwing some kind of error, which is supressed by youtube-dl-gui. I recommend that you don't supress errors like this, so that the user has some chance to fix them.
I used the newest version (0.4) but it does not work with a single private video in a playlist. Instead the complete playlist will be downloaded, but if I modify the URL and want a single video, this won't download.
[Tartube](https://github.com/axcore/tartube) is a fork of youtube-dl-gui. 

Tartube is still being actively developed so, if you have a feature request / bug report, and if you don't want to wait for work on youtube-dl-gui to resume, then you should consider opening an issue on the link above. I might be able to help you.

@MrS0m30n3

there are some issues about language available in the installer and GUI vs the number of languages available in github repository.

The language availble in GUi are 10

AR_SA/cz_CZ/en_US/es-ES/fr_FR/it_IT/ja_JP/ko_KR/pt_BR/ru_RU

For me the same number of languages should be availble in

Installer languages (now are 6 but are really 5 - DE not ncessary)
GUI languages (now are only 6)

**- GUI vs. github languages available**

After run the installer I checked that

cs_CS/it_IT/ja_JP

languages are not included in GUI
Please update the instalelr to include CZ/IT/JP languages in GUI.

**- Installer language vs Gihub languages available**

Arabic/Italian/Portuguese (Brasilian)/Russian are missing as instalelr language
Pelase add them.

German installer language is not useful because there is no de_DE GUI interface.


@MrS0m30n3 

Please merge it.

I'd like to be able to download portions of a video instead of an entire video.
 
For example, if a video on YouTube I wanted to download was 23 minutes long I'd like to be able to be able download only the part of that video, say, from the 5 minute and 22 seconds to, say, the 7 minute and 34 second mark.
Would someone be able to incorporate these two into Youtube-dl?

### Bug report

#### What operating system do you use ?
Windows 10

#### List of actions to perform to reproduce the problem:

  1. Open Options
  2. Click the "Filename format" drop-down
  3. Select Custom
  4. Specify a custom file format
  5. Click Close button
  
#### What is the expected behavior ?
There should only be a custom file format set.

#### What happens instead ?
Setting a custom file format wipes out all the preset provided file formats and makes them the same as my custom file format.

So for example, if I click the dropdown for file format and pick "Title + ID" it is now the same string as my custom format.

I am using the Portable version of youtube-dl-gui. Even if I completely delete the folder the application is in and unzip a fresh copy of it, the formats are still wiped when I start the application.

This takes away the ability to look at the pre-provided formats and use them as a base for building custom formats.
