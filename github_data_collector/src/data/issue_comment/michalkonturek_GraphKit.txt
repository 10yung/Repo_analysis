I have to draw day, week, month and year graph in segmented view and when I try to change the segment tab just need to reset the graph lines and redraw graph but when I call [self.graph reset] in viewwillappear and call [self.graph draw] its crashing the app in _removeTitleLabels method.
- (void)_removeTitleLabels {
    
    if (self.titleLabels.count > 0) {
        [self.titleLabels mk_each:^(id item) {
            [item removeFromSuperview];
        }];
    }
    self.titleLabels = nil;
}
-[_UILabelLayer convertPoint:fromLayer:]: message sent to deallocated instance
 Please help
I'm using https://github.com/ermalkaleci/CarbonKit for plot graph for, today, week, month and year, when switch between the tabs I call draw method everytime but it still crash at some points
Possible to make the edges (point to point) smooth so it flows like a nice curve?
In the _positionYForLineValue method, the denominator ([self _maxValue] - [self _minValue]) may have 0 value. In this case, exception arise for NaN.

The fix should be:

  ```
 int diff = ([self _maxValue] - [self _minValue]);
    CGFloat scale;
    if (diff > 0) {
      scale = (value - [self _minValue]) / diff;
    }else{
        scale = 0;
    }
```
Hi,
Am trying to draw a multi-line graph, what i have noticed is, if the data set have same number if values then only line will be drawn complete, i have attached a sample project, tap on, line graph and see the blue line , if the data is this ,line is perfect
        self.data = @[
                  @[@10, @4, @8, @2, @9, @3, @6],
                  @[@1, @2, @3, @4, @5, @6, @10]
                  ];

if the data has been changed to this 
     self.data = @[
                  @[@10, @4, @8, @2, @9, @3, @6],
                  @[@1, @2, @3]
                  ];
line doesn't reach till the end, lets assume i have number 3 which is for year 2007  and number 2 is for 2003 but i dont have any data for between 2003 and 2007 but i want by line to reach 2007 to reach till the end. i have attached a sample project, please check line graph.

Hi, 

I have a chart with a single line
I set startFromZero as true
I set data values to [0,0]

you then get

**\* Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'CALayerInvalidGeometry', reason: 'CALayer position contains NaN: [20 nan]'

Caused by

```
(CGFloat)_positionYForLineValue:(CGFloat)value { CGFloat scale = (value - [self _minValue]) / ([self _maxValue] - [self _minValue]);
```

because ([self _maxValue] - [self _minValue]) == 0

I can try and add a possible pull request when I get chance. Thanks!

Now performs check for the dataSource to respond to the selector before actually creating/positioning the labels.

Should fix: #16 

WARNING: I haven't tested the fix locally, so you will want to test before pulling it in.

Hey,
I needed to write a GKStackedBarGraph class based on the regular GKBarGraph class, and figured it may be of general interest. It's basically the same as the bar chart, except each bar consists of several segments (stacks) of colour. I added an example so that you can take a look.

The protocol looks like so:

``` objc
- (NSInteger)numberOfBars;
- (NSInteger)numberOfStacks;
- (NSNumber *)valueForBarAtIndex:(NSInteger)index stack:(NSInteger)stack;

@optional
- (UIColor *)colorForBarAtIndex:(NSInteger)index stack:(NSInteger)stack;
- (UIColor *)colorForBarBackgroundAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;
- (CFTimeInterval)animationDurationForBarAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;
- (NSString *)titleForBarAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;
```

Note: It's not very well tested. Also, its draw animation is not as pretty as it could be.
// E. G.

Implemented logic to be able to change the font colour, font size or  font name on either the Bar Graph or Line Graph. 

Adjusting the height of a bar with cashapelayers by covering up what
was there, not everything was covered, leaving behind artifacts. This
is due to the rendering of uneven float numbers. I changed it so only
full and half pixels are used.

the datasource delegate specifies 

```
@optional
- (UIColor *)colorForBarAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;
- (UIColor *)colorForBarBackgroundAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;
- (CFTimeInterval)animationDurationForBarAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;

- (NSString *)titleForBarAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;
```

however in it is being treated as required in the code..
