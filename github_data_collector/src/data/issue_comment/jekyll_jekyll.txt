In order to avoid having to install and recompile all gems on each push, we could cache the dependencies using action/cache:

  - I updated to the latest `github-pages`
  - I ran `bundle exec jekyll doctor` to check my configuration
  - I read the contributing document at https://jekyllrb.com/docs/contributing/

## Expected Behaviour

I had a post with a Unicode Tamil file-name (`‡ÆÆ‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Æø‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÇ ‡Æµ‡Æï‡Øà‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Øç.md`). I expected the generated permalink to include all the letters and combining marks, while converting spaces to hyphens. Specifically, I expected the generated file-name to be `‡ÆÆ‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Æø‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÇ-‡Æµ‡Æï‡Øà‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Øç.html).

## Current Behavior

Instead, it generated something like `‡ÆÆ‡Æ≤-‡Æ≤‡Æø‡Æ™-‡Æ™‡ØÇ-‡Æµ‡Æï‡Øà‡Æï‡Æ≥.html`, breaking up words in unexpected places.

I looked at the code, and in `jekyll-3.8.5/lib/jekyll/utils.rb`, I found `replace_character_sequence_with_hyphen` which replaces `/[^[:alnum:]._~!$&'()+,;=@]+/` with `-`. The problem is that there many Unicode letter/mark codepoints that don't match `alnum`: in my specific case, `U+0BCD`. It turns out that the *Alphabetic* Unicode property only applies to some of what we'd want to consider Letters/Marks.

Instead, the recommendation I got on [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59707795/why-do-some-unicode-combining-markers-like-u0bcd-not-match-alpha-in-ruby) was to use Unicode categories. My suggested fix would be to change the Regex to match `/[^\p{M}\p{L}\p{Nd}._~!$&'()+,;=@]+/`.

## Expected Behaviour

No BOM warning is produced when files are read

## Current Behavior

When using `encoding: ISO-8859-1` in `_config.yml`, the following errors occur when building a jekyll site, once for every time a file is read:
- `.../vendor/bundle/ruby/2.5.0/gems/jekyll-4.0.0/lib/jekyll/convertible.rb:41: warning: BOM with non-UTF encoding ISO-8859-1 is nonsense`
- `.../vendor/bundle/ruby/2.5.0/gems/jekyll-4.0.0/lib/jekyll/tags/include.rb:179: warning: BOM with non-UTF encoding ISO-8859-1 is nonsense`

Inserting `puts file_read_opts(context)` on line 179 of `include.rb` shows `{:encoding=>"bom|ISO-8859-1"}`. Hard-coding the second argument to `File.read()` to be `{:encoding=>"ISO-8859-1"}` fixes the warning. I'm not sure where the `bom` bit is coming from or whether `File.read()` ought to be happy with it being there, but that appears to be the source of the problem.

(Sorry, I wish I could use utf-8 encoding too :smile: )
- This is a üêõ bug fix.
- *No unit-tests.*

## Summary

Since `Liquid::Templates` are now cached, ensure that every render starts with a clean context.

## Context

Resolves #7811 
- This is a üôã feature or enhancement. 


## Summary

**Proof-of-concept**
Warn a user if there's an existing instance being served already.

## Context

Resolves #7956 

/cc @7hoenix In case you want to take this for a test-run:
```ruby
gem "jekyll", git: "https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git", ref: "refs/pull/7961/head"
```
## Motivation

Following your instruction on Debian 10, doesn't work.
Here the detailed explanation:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59569136/how-to-install-jekyll-on-ubuntu


## Suggestion

Update your instructions in order to allow Debian users to install Jekyll. In detail, remove the installation of `Ruby` from the repository and instead:

```
curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
restart the shell
rvm install 2.6.0
```
Added a step to the macOS documentation that explains how to edit your .bash_profile file.  Thought it might help some newer users out!

## Summary

<!--

A short change to the macOS documentation page that explains how to edit your shell config file. Previously it said ' Add the brew ruby path to your shell config', now in addition it suggests using 'sudo nano ~/.bash_profile' to edit the file. 

This was admittedly a stumbling block for me, so I thought adding it might help other users out.  I found [someone else](https://rebeccaeilering.github.io/my-dev-blog/moving-my-blog-to-gatsby) who mentioned this being a stumbling block to using Jekyll as well.  Hopefully this is helpful!

Jekyll markdown export from Github, It's supposed to show a table of chords for the ukulele, which are defined using only numbers formatted as italic, bold and strikethrough, besides the standard format.

`3~~1~~2~~1~~`
in the markdown should render as
3~~1~~2~~1~~  
thus in the HTML output created by Jekyll as
`<td>3<del>1</del>2<del>1</del></td>`

But the output is this
`<td>3<del>1~~2</del>1~~</td>`

rendering as  
<td>3<del>1~~2</del>1~~</td>
## Summary

Situation: User is trying to do a production build passing in environment `JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build`

--> BUT the user also has a development server running (say in VSCode from a week ago üò®).

Observed Behavior:

Jekyll will do the build. . . but it will prefer the development server's environment instead of the environment variable being passed in.

## Motivation

This happened to me on a side project and it was very frustrating. I didn't have any optics around why the system wasn't behaving as I would expect it to. . . it just felt like broken software.

I imagine that beginners are the folks most likely to get burned by this as they pull up some development server (as per the docs) and then try to do a production build in a different tab.

#DoItForTheBeginners

## Reference-level explanation

Preferred Behavior:

If a user attempts to run a `jekyll build` and we observe that in their system they also have a running development server then it should give a warning of some sort that declares that they are clobbering the environment and that they should go turn off the development server (perhaps with a tip like: You can see if you have a local development server running with a [command](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3855127/find-and-kill-process-locking-port-3000-on-mac) like `netstat -vanp tcp | grep 4000` )

An implementation could work if we create a lockfile of some sort when the development server is running?

## Drawbacks

Time == money

<!--
  Hi! Thanks for considering to file a bug with Jekyll. Please take the time to
  answer the basic questions. Please try to be as detailed as possible.

  If you are unsure this is a bug in Jekyll, or this is a bug caused
  by a plugin that isn't directly related to Jekyll, or if this is just
  a generic usage question, please consider asking your question at
  https://talk.jekyllrb.com where non-bug questions go.

  Thanks!
-->

<!-- 
  Make sure that you've done all of these. If you're sure that the bug you're
  reporting is only apparent in a previous version of Jekyll, please say so explicitly
  in your description.

  - I updated to the latest Jekyll (or) if on GitHub Pages to the latest `github-pages`
  - I ran `jekyll doctor` to check my configuration
  - I read the contributing document at https://jekyllrb.com/docs/contributing/

## My Environment

<!--
  Replace the values in the Version(s) column with the ones in your build. If you're not
  using `github-pages`, just replace it with "No".

## Expected Behaviour
Jekyll can't render a formula properly which contains `}_  _{`, such as `${a}_1$ $b_{2}$`. It should be like this under normal conditoins.

But It's like this in Jekyll.

I create a new environment by `jekyll new envir`, and then I just change the default markdown file `201-12-26-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown`in the `_post` to 
```

<script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
    MathJax.Hub.Config({
        tex2jax: {
            skipTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre'],
            displayMath: [['$$','$$']],
            inlineMath: [['$','$']],
        },
    });
</script>

$y=ax+b$

$a$$b$

$\mathbf{T}_{ij} - \mathbf{T}_{ji}$

${a}_1$ $b_{2}$
```
And it looks like this in chrome

But It works  in other markdown editors like Markdown Preview Enhanced in VScode which also use Mathjax. So It should not be caused by Mathjax.

I aslo tried on the github-pages and it's the same problem.
