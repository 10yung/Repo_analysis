## Scope 

- Please indicate which category or categories from our [package fit policies](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/policies.html#package-categories) this package falls under: (Please check an appropriate box below. If you are unsure, we suggest you make a pre-submission inquiry.):

	- [x] data retrieval
	- [ ] data extraction
	- [ ] database access
	- [ ] data munging
	- [ ] data deposition
	- [ ] workflow automation
	- [ ] version control
	- [ ] citation management and bibliometrics
	- [ ] scientific software wrappers
	- [ ] database software bindings
	- [ ] geospatial data
	- [ ] text analysis
	
- Explain how and why the package falls under these categories (briefly, 1-2 sentences): 
  `healthdatacsv` falls under *data retrieval* because it accesses and ingests data from an online source.  This package focuses on health-related data made available from the [HealthData.gov API](https://healthdata.gov/node/25341).

-   Who is the target audience and what are scientific applications of this package?  
Target audience would be researchers, instructors, students, and analysts in health-related fields (i.e. Epidemiology, Health Economics, Health Services Research).  The data accessed are collected by agencies of the US Dept. of Health and Human Services, and are often nationally representative. Scientific applications include, among others, the investigation of: disease patterns, trends in health behaviors, or deficits in health systems.

-   Are there other R packages that accomplish the same thing? If so, how does yours differ or meet [our criteria for best-in-category](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/policies.html#overlap)?
There is [rHealthDataGov](https://github.com/rOpenHealth/rHealthDataGov); however, this package has not been updated and does not function properly with the current [HealthData.gov API](https://healthdata.gov/node/25341).

-   If you made a pre-submission inquiry, please paste the link to the corresponding issue, forum post, or other discussion, or @tag the editor you contacted.

Pharmaceutical researches who are interested to use data science and machine learning tools in their Drugs Development research

-   Are there other R packages that accomplish the same thing? If so, how does yours differ or meet 
There is **drugbankR** that might do a similar task by loading the whole DrugBank database into a single R dataframe and provide some queries to for specific data. 
On the other hand, **dbparser** extract drugbank database in to different 75 scientifically detailed dataframe with clear attributes. These dataframes need no extra functionalities to query them except regular base R functionalities. Also these dataframe can be saved in to a given SQL database. 
Also, **dbparser** comes to greater coverage in terms of functionality, documentation, and robust test coverage and error handling, In comparison to **drugbankR**.

## Scope 

- Please indicate which category or categories from our [package fit policies](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/policies.html#package-categories) this package falls under: (Please check an appropriate box below. If you are unsure, we suggest you make a pre-submission inquiry.):

	- [x] data retrieval
	- [x] data extraction
	- [x] database access
	- [ ] data munging
	- [ ] data deposition
	- [ ] reproducibility
	- [ ] geospatial data
	- [ ] text analysis
	

- Explain how and why the package falls under these categories (briefly, 1-2 sentences):

The package accesses existing data sets, adapts them to a standard format, and provides a set of functions for accessing the resulting database.

-   Who is the target audience and what are scientific applications of this package?  

Anyone using data including species names, especially for datasets that may have taxonomic inconsistencies.

-   Are there other R packages that accomplish the same thing? If so, how does yours differ or meet [our criteria for best-in-category](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/policies.html#overlap)?

`taxaize` provides accesses to many of the same datasets via an API interface. Our package is specifically designed to work around the API to offer the faster access necessary for large datasets, as well as provide a standardized format for all datasets.

## Scope 
- Please indicate which category or categories from our [package fit policies](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/policies.html#package-categories) this package falls under: (Please check an appropriate box below. If you are unsure, we suggest you make a pre-submission inquiry.):

	- [X] data retrieval
	- [ ] data extraction
	- [ ] database access
	- [ ] data munging
	- [ ] data deposition
	- [ ] reproducibility
	- [ ] geospatial data
	- [ ] text analysis
	

- Explain how and why the package falls under these categories (briefly, 1-2 sentences):

Data retrieval: ruODK retrieves data from ODK Central, a data clearinghouse containing data which have been digitally captured by the data collection app ODK Collect using Xforms.

As mentioned by @annakrystalli, the below categories are touched by ruODK, but don't apply:

Data extraction or munging: ruODK transforms and sanitises the data from ODK Central from the original format (which parses to nested lists in R) into tibbles.

Reproducibility: ruODK allows to script and repeat the data extraction step - the main use case it is being written for.

Geospatial data: while ODK allows to capture location data (points, lines, polygons), and ruODK extracts these values, ruODK is not primarily a spatial package.

-   Who is the target audience and what are scientific applications of this package?  

(Scope and use cases are also mentioned in the [README](https://dbca-wa.github.io/ruODK/index.html).)

Any organisation collecting data with the [OpenDataKit](https://opendatakit.org/) suite will need to extract the data from the data clearinghouses, ODK Aggregate (outgoing) or ODK Central (new). Some may want to analyse the data straight out of ODK Central, some may need to transfer the data into another data warehouse for further post-processing, QA, and integration with other data sources. 

For both use cases, `ruODK` bridges and simplifies the gap between the data sitting in ODK Central, and the data being a tibble in R, ready for further processing.

In a nutshell, `ruODK` aims to be to ODK Central what `ckanr` is to CKAN.

As per [release notes for ODK Central 0.6](https://forum.opendatakit.org/t/odk-central-beta-v0-6/21489), next to the other options, ruODK is now the recommended package to access ODK Central data in R.

-   Are there other R packages that accomplish the same thing? If so, how does yours differ or meet [our criteria for best-in-category](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/policies.html#overlap)?

## Scope 

- Please indicate which category or categories from our [package fit policies](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/policies.html#package-categories) this package falls under: (Please check an appropriate box below. If you are unsure, we suggest you make a pre-submission inquiry.):

	- [ ] data retrieval
	- [x] data extraction
	- [ ] database access
	- [ ] data munging
	- [ ] data deposition
	- [ ] reproducibility
	- [x] geospatial data
	- [ ] text analysis
	

- Explain how and why the package falls under these categories (briefly, 1-2 sentences):

[`mapscanner`](https://github.com/mpadge/mapscanner) fits nicely into both data extraction and geospatial data. It is definitely geospatial because it concerns maps, and ultimately generates spatial output in standard (sf) format. It is nevertheless primarily a "data extraction" tool that extracts useful (spatially) structured data from unstructured input in either pdf or image formats.

-   Who is the target audience and what are scientific applications of this package?  

The target audience comprises social researchers interested in spatial phenomena such as subjective perceptions of regions or areas, or perceptions of location. More specifically, these kinds of analyses are currently restricted to (highly) commercial service provision, and the package aims to aid and empower social researchers in financially disadvantageous circumstances by providing analytic abilities that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive.

-   Are there other R packages that accomplish the same thing? If so, how does yours differ or meet [our criteria for best-in-category](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/policies.html#overlap)?

No R packages whatsoever that we are aware of. Vaguely similar software exists in other languages, such as [`mapmatcher`](https://github.com/julienperret/mapmatcher) (in `java`; long abandoned) and [`Maplat`](https://github.com/code4nara/Maplat) (`.js`; mostly in Japanese, and comparable only in algorithmic terms; purpose is entirely different).

-   If you made a pre-submission enquiry, please paste the link to the corresponding issue, forum post, or other discussion, or @tag the editor you contacted.
