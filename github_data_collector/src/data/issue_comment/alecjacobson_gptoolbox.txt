The system() call to generate MD5 hash was Mac-specific. Updated to include Linux and windows calls
I'm trying to use a few MEX functions, but am running into an error in MATLAB saying `XXX.mexw64 is not a valid Win32 application`. This happens with most of the functions needing CGAL, everything else seems to be fine. Followed the instructions below: 

> Ok, did you already download CMake and VS2015?
>
> 1. Open CMake-Gui.
> 2. Set "Where is the sourcecode" to `./gptoolbox/mex` and "Where to build the binaries" to `./gptoolbox/mex/build`.
> 3. Click on configure. 
> 4. A window opens. Select "Visual Studio 14 2015 **Win64**" for "Specify the generator for this project". Click "Finish" in the same window.
> 4. Process the error messages CMake might throw and select the features you want for your build by checking/unchecking the associated checkboxes (e.g. WITH_ELTOPO).
> 5. Click on configure again. If there are still error messages, then fix them. Repeat until there are no more error messages.
> 6. Click on generate. There should be no error messages. If there are errors... fix them. :-)
> 7. Click on open project, which opens the project in VS2015.
> 8. In VS: Compile the project.

Configuration:
- MATLAB r2019b
- VS 2015 (Tried with VS 2019, same problem)
- Boost 1.71.0
- CMake 3.15.4

Any help would be much appreciated!

U = perform_fast_marching_mesh(V,F',1); 
is not working for meshes I gave as input n it kept running indefinitely ...is there any requirement that mesh needs to be manifold?? if not, why it is not working? it is not giving any error also :(


[Line 14](https://github.com/alecjacobson/gptoolbox/blob/master/mesh/remove_unreferenced.m#L14) indicates that `IM` for the removed vertices is set to `-1`. But it's actually set so that the removed vertices have a value larger than `size(RV, 1)`. Line 15 should be changed to
`  %    and V(find(IM<=size(RV, 1)),:) = RV`
to describe the actually implemented functionality.
The input description for [`mesh/remove_duplicate_vertices.m`](https://github.com/alecjacobson/gptoolbox/blob/master/mesh/remove_duplicate_vertices.m) suggests that `epsilon` is the "uniqueness tolerance (significance digit)". However, the current behaviour of the function does not comply with this definition.

Changing line 52 to this should do the trick:
`[~,SVI,SVJ] = unique(round(V*(10^epsilon)),'rows','stable');`
In the example Surface/Surface Intersection of the function SurfaceIntersection by Jaroslaw Tuszynski to find intersection between two objects( #2 and #3).

 [https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/48613-surface-intersection](url)

```
 % Create Surface#1
[x,y] = pol2cart((0:2)'*2*pi/3,40);
Surface1.vertices = [0 0 110; x y [0; 0; 0]];
Surface1.faces    = [1 2 3; 1 3 4; 1 4 2; 2 3 4];
%Create Surface #2
load tetmesh;
TR = triangulation(tet,X);
[Surface2.faces, Surface2.vertices] = freeBoundary(TR);
% Create Surface #3
Surface3.vertices = [x y [30; 30; 30]; y x [60; 60; 60]];
Surface3.faces    = [1:3;4:6];
% Plot them
clf; hold on
%S=Surface1; trisurf(S.faces, S.vertices(:,1),S.vertices(:,2),S.vertices(:,3),'FaceAlpha', 0.5, 'FaceColor', 'r');
S=Surface2; trisurf(S.faces, S.vertices(:,1),S.vertices(:,2),S.vertices(:,3),'FaceAlpha', 0.5, 'FaceColor', 'g');
S=Surface3; trisurf(S.faces, S.vertices(:,1),S.vertices(:,2),S.vertices(:,3),'FaceAlpha', 0.5, 'FaceColor', 'b');
view([3 1 1])
axis equal
title ('Three test surfaces')
legend({'#2', '#3'});
 %[intersect12, Surf12] = SurfaceIntersection(Surface1, Surface2);
%[intersect13, Surf13] = SurfaceIntersection(Surface1, Surface3);
[intersect23, Surf23] = SurfaceIntersection(Surface3, Surface2);
clf; hold on
%S=Surf12; trisurf(S.faces, S.vertices(:,1),S.vertices(:,2),S.vertices(:,3),'EdgeColor', 'r', 'FaceColor', 'r');
%S=Surf13; trisurf(S.faces, S.vertices(:,1),S.vertices(:,2),S.vertices(:,3),'EdgeColor', 'g', 'FaceColor', 'g');
S=Surf23; trisurf(S.faces, S.vertices(:,1),S.vertices(:,2),S.vertices(:,3),'EdgeColor', 'b', 'FaceColor', 'b');
title ('Surface/Surface intersections')
legend({'#2/#3'});
view([3 1 1])
axis equal
zlim([0 80])
```



The result Surf23.edges is (60x2 double) array, every row represents the ID# of points that make the edge of intersection Surface#2 and Surface#3. These edges (blue lines) look like 5 separate continuous groups in the plot, which represents the free boundary of the legs of Surface#2. as shown in the pictures attached.
What I'm wishing for is to post process the data points of these 5 lines(continuous polygons of edges) and store it in a (C= 5x1 cell) array. each line (continuous polygons of edges) is (Nx3 double) inside the C array? Sorted from beginning to end in one direction (CW or CCW)
In other words, how can I get every group of continuous polygon in a separate (Nx3 double) array.Sorted from beginning to end in one direction (CW or CCW)?
And in general, if there was more than 5 continuous lines (continuous polygons of edges), is it possible to have every continuous line in a separate double array Nx3 ,as long as they are connected through a vertex, ? and these double arrays will be inside Cell array=Mx1, where M=Number of lines (continuous polygons)??
Help would be appreciated.
Thank you so much !!!

### _I have wrote the following code where I used **S=Surf23**  as an input and it worked fine for this example as shown in the picture._ 

%% plot the intersectiom
trisurf(S.faces, S.vertices(:,1),S.vertices(:,2),S.vertices(:,3),'EdgeColor', 'b', 'FaceColor', 'b');
xlabel('X')
ylabel('Y')
zlabel('Z')
 
 hold on
 %%
 %S is the result of Surface/Surface intersection
C={}; %Index of data points in S.edges.
 Line_Sorted_all={};% Original data points.
% length_of_data=2;
Num_Of_Lines = 0;% To counts # of loops and find # of continuous lines 
rest_of_data=1; %means its not empty yet !!!line
 while (rest_of_data==1)
 Num_Of_Lines = Num_Of_Lines + 1;

          S1=[S1;S.edges(row,:)];  
      end
        %ordered=[ordered;ordered(end,:)];
      for i=2:length(S.edges)
          [row,col,v]=find(S.edges(:,2)==S1(end,end));
          B= fliplr(S.edges(row,:));

### **### But when i used it for the next example it didNOT work:**
S1(is the surface number 1)
S2(is the surface number 2)
**(NOTE: I TRIED TO ADD S1 AND S2 DATA (faces and vertices) here but couldn't. Can someone tell me how to add matlab.mat file here)**

**Here are the intersection lines BEFORE applying my code:**

The results for the second example according to my code was **_Line_Sorted_all=5x1 cell_** as in the picture below , **_which is wrong._** 

I was supposed to get  **_Line_Sorted_all=2x1 cell_.** One cell for inner line and one for outer line.

**Thank you so much ** 









I'm almost totally new to programming except for Matlab and I cannot compile the mex files as per the instructions in the mex readme.  It's probably just my lack of experience but I don't know what programs I need installed and how to execute the commands.  I am familiar with command lines etc but have never used visual studio, cmake etc.  Could someone please clarify a list of what programs are required and list the steps in the compilation procedure.

Thank you, Garrick
i've 2 stl files, and i'm tryngo to do simple boolean operation in matlab, 
i'm loading the two meshes with mesh_load and then i get this error while doing mesh_boolean,
some suggestion?

Error using intersect (line 80)
Not enough input arguments.

Error in importare (line 16)
[V2,F2]= mesh_boolean(V,F,V1,F1, intersect);
Hi!
I'm using Linux and trying to compile Mex.

Using came version 3.9.1 and libigl has been downloaded under /gptoolbox/mex/../libigl
I had this error and not sure why. Do you know what's going on here?
CMake Error at cmake/FindELTOPO.cmake:22 (message):
