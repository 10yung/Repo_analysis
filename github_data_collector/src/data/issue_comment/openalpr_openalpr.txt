The configuration I made when creating an AlprNet object is not valid. Instead, the values in the openalpr.conf file are valid. How do I use the configuration I made when creating the object?






```
                    alpr = new AlprNet("eu",ConfigFile,RuntimeDataDir)
                    {
                        
                        Configuration =
                        {
                            DebugShowImages = true,
                            PostProcessMinConfidence = 90,
                            PostProcessConfidenceSkipLevel = 100,
                        }
                    };
```

Im getting an error when running make:
```
make[2]: *** No rule to make target 'opencv_videostab-NOTFOUND', needed by 'openalpr/libopenalpr.so.2'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/Makefile2:544: openalpr/CMakeFiles/openalpr.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [Makefile:152: all] Error 2
==> ERROR: A failure occurred in build().
    Aborting...

```

The readme contains a link to Xamarin docs https://github.com/kevinjpetersen/openalpr-xamarin which does not exist, error 404.
Hey all, 

Was just wondering if version 2.3.109 and above (particularly 2.6.103, since I need the Malaysian and Singaporean data-set) are free.

Could not find any information regarding this, and if it is free how do I go about updating the API. Currently on this repos latest release (OpenALPR 2.3.0). 

Thanks! 
Hello i have the next problem

Can this open source openALPR be used for processing live stream videos on the fly? 
I am planning to connect a Jetson Nano to my dash cam and I want to feed the video directly from the cam to the Jetson Nano and I want the model to process the video while the dash cam is capturing.
