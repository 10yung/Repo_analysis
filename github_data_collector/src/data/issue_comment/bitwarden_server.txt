Hi,

I've notice the heavy use of "new HttpClient();" throughout both the Controller and Service layer - https://github.com/bitwarden/server/search?q=new+HttpClient%28%29%3B&unscoped_q=new+HttpClient%28%29%3B

Is this something you would have the appetite for fixing via IHttpClientFactory? Happy to submit the pull requests.

Thanks
Justin
Hi,

Relaying this here :
https://community.bitwarden.com/t/office-365-is-categorizing-all-bitwarden-emails-as-a-phishing-attempt/9761

Since a few days, Office 365 users do not receive Bitwarden mails anymore.
Mails are even not available in SPAM box.
Of course it used to work perfectly.
A tricky situation, especially in companies using Office 365 !

Could we dig into this ?
Many thx üëç

I only have two Yubikeys for 2 step verification(YubiKey OTP). After recover from my previous backup(I migrated my installation from one machine to another), my premium account license is missing and two step verification is disabled.

I'm sure I followed the backup instruction and configurations related to 2 step verification are included in my backup. Because once I uploaded my premium license after migration, those two yubikeys are correctly configured.

So, it seems that once my premium account expired (in my example, I lost this license during migration), premium functions are disabled including YubiKey OTP, which means my 2 step verifications are invalid (Again, this is my only 2 step verification method).

My question is:

1. Is there something wrong with my backup which makes me lost my license?

2. Is this a bug? "When no available 2 step verification method exists, disable 2 step verification and you can login ONLY with your password."


Hi, 

Similar to issue #125 it would be good to allow the same for the letsencrypt certbot container, could you please add a bind IP question during the bitwarden.sh install part in the letsencrypt section.

https://github.com/bitwarden/server/blob/36e97ccbd255ec50ddbcb668ba12792d3a485985/scripts/run.sh#L65-L77

And something similar with (or storing the information for later in the previous step):
https://github.com/bitwarden/server/blob/36e97ccbd255ec50ddbcb668ba12792d3a485985/scripts/run.sh#L116-L123

or maybe instead making it part of the docker-compose.yml?

Thanks

I'm trying to setup with bitwarden my Firefox profiles accounts, but when a click on the plus sign (top-right) it shows me the first account I created for the first profile. Anyone knows how to use on such cases?

Since RHEL, Fedora, and Centos have all dropped support for docker in favor of podman, I believe it is pertinent to make sure that Bitwarden is able to run on podman. Currently, it does not run on podman (even with docker commands aliased to podman.

Is there any way to renew the ssl certificates without using ./bitwarden.sh restart ?

Also, is there a way to schedule those restarts in a good way (say each month) to get the certificates updated automatically? I have the team installation in an ubuntu instance.

Hello dear colleagues,

since hours, Bitwarden installation/startup on my Bionic server fails for some reason (never worked thus far). No other daemons like apache2 are listening on the same ports, everything is ran as sudo and followed by Bitwarden/Docker official docs. Resources with not much running should be sufficient (4GB RAM, 2 vCores, 100GB SSD of which 7% is used). 80 and 443 are open of course and URL is correct. All packages are up-to-date.

Still hard to sense a pattern here, especially since I'm also getting "resource not available" bash-errors after some while, i.e. retrying without rebooting the server. It's never able to create all containers.

Terminal logs of a whole from-scratch installation (including Docker):

Gonna test in a local VM (/Docker Windows?) later in the morning, anyone got an idea still? Appreciate any help I can get!

Best regards,
ceeazy
Hello there
I have downloaded the latest version of bitwarden, and installed it; however when I want to configure the smtp settings and I want to send email for the admin connection, I always get a timeout
here is the log
```

globalSettings__mail__smtp__trustServer=true
```
I have tried many things with no success and I am out of ideas 

do you have any leads ? 
Thnak you for your help
I "manually installed" Bitwarden, approx 2 months ago, it worked first time no issues.

Recently we have noticed that it has stopped sending emails, for example admin logins, new accounts

I have installed swaks in the api container and can send emails.

I see no dns lookups (when the mail server was an FQDN)

application and docker logs show nothing remotely related to sending emails, apart from the back and forth for the html /admin authentication request

Even rolled admin and api back to 1.31.1, no difference
