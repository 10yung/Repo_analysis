#### Details of the scenario you tried and the problem that is occurring
Sometimes the integration tests fail with the error. Most likely a timing issue when running the integration test `RemoveHandlerExcludedOptionalParameters`.

```
Win32Exception: An instance of the service is already running
InvalidOperationException: Cannot start service IISADMIN on computer '.'.
```

#### Suggested solution to the issue
None

#### The DSC configuration that is used to reproduce the issue (as detailed as possible)
See integration test.

#### The operating system the target node is running
Windows Server 2019

#### Version and build of PowerShell the target node is running
5.1

#### Version of the DSC module that was used
From branch `master`.
When the new CI pipeline was added (PR #549) only one build worker was added (Windows Server 2016) to run integration tests. We should add the other available builds workers as well; Windows Server Core and Windows Server 2019
**Thank you very much for developing and sharing this DSC Module!**

Unfortunately, one thing is not quite clear, in the GitHub project description you write:
_This module contains DSC resources for deployment and configuration of web servers and components around those_

#### Is this Module for IIS Webservers or for Webservers in general?
It would be great if the GitHub project description could clearly communicate this aspect, for example:

- This module contains DSC resources for deployment and configuration **of IIS web servers** and components around those

Or:

- This module contains DSC resources for deployment and configuration **of IIS, Apache and nginx web servers** and components around those

This would help a lot to decide if this module is suitable for a project :-)

Thanks a lot, kind regards,
Thomas
#### Details of the scenario you tried and the problem that is occurring
When you specify an application pool that does not exist in a xWebsite resource, the resource does not check if the specified application pool exists. This results in a broken website with error "Unknown:The object identifier does not represent a valid object. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x800710D8)"

#### Verbose logs showing the problem
N/A

#### Suggested solution to the issue
Check if the specified application pool really exists, before applying the configuration.

#### The DSC configuration that is used to reproduce the issue (as detailed as possible)
```powershell
xWebsite "Website"
{
    Name            = "Example website"
    ApplicationPool = "NonExistentApplicationPool"
    BindingInfo     = @(
        MSFT_xWebBindingInformation 
        {
            Protocol              = 'HTTP' 
            Port                  = '80'
            IPAddress             = '*'
            Hostname              = "www.example.com"
        }
    )
}
```

#### Details of the scenario you tried and the problem that is occurring
I am trying to add some entries to the "system.ftpserver/security/authorization" collection, both in the root of an FTPSite and in 2 virtual directories within that site. Essentially I am trying to match the output of the script below.

```powershell
import-module webadministration

new-webftpsite -Name "FTPSite" -Port "21" -physicalpath "D:\resources" -Force

set-itemproperty "IIS:\Sites\FTPSite" -name ftpServer.security.authentication.basicauthentication.enabled -Value $true
set-itemproperty "IIS:\Sites\FTPSite" -name ftpServer.security.ssl.controlchannelpolicy -value 0
set-itemproperty "IIS:\Sites\FTPSite" -name ftpServer.security.ssl.datachannelpolicy -value 0
add-webconfiguration "system.ftpserver/security/authorization" -value @{accessType="Allow";users="User1,User2,User3";permissions=3} -PSPath IIS:\Sites\FTPSite

New-WebVirtualDirectory -Site "FTPSite" -Name "Config" -PhysicalPath "D:\Config"
Remove-WebConfigurationProperty "system.ftpserver/security/authorization" -PSPath IIS:\Sites\FTPSite\Config -Name "."
add-webconfiguration "system.ftpserver/security/authorization" -value @{accessType="Allow";users="User2";permissions=3} -PSPath IIS:\Sites\FTPSite\Config

New-WebVirtualDirectory -Site "FTPSite" -Name "AppData" -PhysicalPath "D:\AppData"
Remove-WebConfigurationProperty "system.ftpserver/security/authorization" -PSPath IIS:\Sites\FTPSite\AppData -Name "."
add-webconfiguration "system.ftpserver/security/authorization" -value @{accessType="Allow";users="User3";permissions=3} -PSPath IIS:\Sites\FTPSite\AppData
```

The problem is that I can't find a way to use the xWebConfigPropertyCollection resource to set an entity in this collection. There are 3 properties that need to be set at the same time, and the resource doesn't seem to have the functionality to achieve this.

I am aware that there is a PR (#425) open with a new feature for adding FTPSites which will cover most of what I need to do, however I don't think it will help with modifying the collections on the Virtual Folders.

If I have completely missed something and this is really simple, please point me in the right direction, otherwise I think there may need to be an enhancement to the resource.
#### Verbose logs showing the problem
I have tried all the permutations I can think of, which has produced many different errors, far too many to display here.
#### Suggested solution to the issue
N/A
#### The DSC configuration that is used to reproduce the issue (as detailed as possible)
This is as far as I have managed to get, I have tried laying this out similar to the examples for this resource without success. I have also tried the format suggested in Issue #379, again without success.

            ItemName = "add"

            ItemKeyValue = "1"
            ItemPropertyName = "AccessType"
            ItemPropertyValue = "Allow"
        }

        xWebConfigPropertyCollection FTPRootAuthorizationUsers

            ItemPropertyName = "AccessType"
            ItemPropertyValue = "Allow"
        }

        {
            WebsitePath = "IIS:\Sites\FTPSite\AppData"
            Filter = "system.ftpserver/security/authorization"

This example https://github.com/PowerShell/xWebAdministration#registering-php should be moved to the Examples folder. Preferably in the root of the Examples folder as an end-to-end example.

*Please note that examples are tested so they can be compiled.*

We should add at least one example for this resource.
We should opt-in to publish wiki content https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests#publish-wiki-content

To be able to opt-in we need to

* Resolve issue https://github.com/PowerShell/xWebAdministration/issues/452
* Remove all of the resource documentation from the README.md (it will be generated automatically) - effectively closing issue #449 and #450
