the "RoomLayoutTypes" (which is in the line 15 in the matlab/getLSUNRes.m) is missed, where can I find it?
Will mixed-precision be able to accommodate the 10.9gb in 8gb since using fp16 essentially doubles the VRAM.
Where can I find the LSUN toolkit to further process/fine-tune my results (corner locations) on perspective images, as stated here: https://github.com/zouchuhang/LayoutNet#extension-to-perspective-images ?
I'm trying Matlab scripts, but preprocessPano.m requires pano_edge_tr_1024..
Could you show how to run it properly?

```
>> preprocessPano
pano_aadmuaxyxouqic
Error using load
Unable to read file '..\data\pano_edge_tr_1024\vp\pano_aadmuaxyxouqic.mat'. No
such file or directory.

Error in preprocessPano (line 59)
    load(['..\data\pano_edge_tr_1024\vp\' im_name '.mat']);
```
Instead of generating one room layout from one panorama, I'm wondering if LayoutNet can generate a complete floor plan from multiple panoramas? 

Thank you
JJ
Is there any way to use this logic to make a 3d box from single RGB image of indoor room.. (without panorama).

like of this image

Hi, thanks a lot for sharing your work! 
I download your full approach model pretrained on the panoContext dataset and use it to predict on the test set of the panoContext dataset. However, I find that the results inferred by your pretrained model are 73.85, 1.07 and 3.40 respectively while the results on the paper are 74.48, 1.06 and 3.34 respectively. I doubt wheter the pretrained model can obtain the results reported on the paper or whether I did something wrong...
Can u help me? Thanks a lot!
Hi , 

Thanks for sharing your work. This is very interesting and has some great use cases. 

With regard to the result, is it possible to find the measurements of the actual room from the 3D reconstruction? Or in other words, how accurate is the 3d reconstruction in terms of wall width or length measurements to the actual room ?

As shown below

How to handle such memory issues.?

My system has 8GB RAM
Nvidia GTX 940M 4GB
Core i5 6th GEN
