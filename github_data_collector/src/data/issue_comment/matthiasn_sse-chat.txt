Hi Matthias,

We have deconnexion using Ok.feed on heroku. It seems that Ok.chunk should be more apropriate when the connexion is persistent without knowing the total lenght of the stream data and Ok.feed is usefull when streaming a know length, for example streaming a long file.
What is your experience/tests on both methods as the Play documentation is not very helpfull.
