Thanks for publishing this! I think it would be better findable, if displayed on [GitHub.com/topics/ggplot2-themes](https://github.com/topics/ggplot2-themes), please consider [adding that topic](https://help.github.com/articles/about-topics/) to this repo. Thank you :-)
Hi there, 

Thanks for developing a cool package! :) 
 
It is used in production as part of the data analytics pipeline for the response to Ebola in North Kivu, DRC. So far we put *ggthemr* on our [deployer](https://github.com/reconhub/deployer) but it'd be nice to know if / when a CRAN release is to be expected. Any rough ETA?

For now only Travis. Builds beautiful documentation: https://krlmlr.github.io/ggthemr/ .

After merging, you'd need to run a few steps:

1. Remove the old `gh-pages` branch:  `git push origin :gh-pages`
2. Set up deploy keys: `travis::use_travis_deploy()` from https://github.com/ropenscilabs/travis/
3. Link to documentation from https://cttobin.github.io/ggthemr

Will add one more commit to test against dev version of ggplot2 (which currently seems to fail).

NB: I have no idea why the plots were updated, can remove them from the PR if you prefer.
ggplot2 just updated 6 days ago to 3.1.1.  Loading a ggthemr theme now throws the following message:
Warning message:
New theme missing the following elements: axis.ticks.length.x, axis.ticks.length.x.top, axis.ticks.length.x.bottom, axis.ticks.length.y, axis.ticks.length.y.left, axis.ticks.length.y.right 

Calling ggplot now results in the following error:
Error in axis.ticks.length.x.bottom %||% axis.ticks.length.x : 
  object 'axis.ticks.length.x.bottom' not found

Any chance these elements can be specified in the themes or is there a workaround?  Thank you!
