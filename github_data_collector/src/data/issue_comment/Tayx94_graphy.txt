I believe it should be pretty straight forward. Some info on what it takes to make it so people can just download this through the package manager can be found here.

I was trying out the Universal SRP in 2019.3b and the LWRP in 2019.2 (same thing, new name) and noticed Graphy having a stroke. Looks like the FPS shader isn't too happy. 

Here it is in normal mode: https://i.imgur.com/Uuuj3te.gifv
and here in light mode: https://i.imgur.com/PyuMnyh.gifv

I mentioned in Discord but will mention again in case it is lost in chat, with 19.3's release, LWRP/Universal RP will be default going forward and I don't believe there will be a non-SRP renderer.

From @nevaknevak :
I'd say we could potentially get rid of both classes all together if we use TMPro and SetText / SetCharArray which doesn't allocate memory. But this would need some research
I get a compilation error on Unity 2019.1.0f2 and Switch platform in the GraphyDebugger class at line 548.
It seems like the Switch platform wants rather to have the native screenshot code used (I can't give more info about that sadly due to Nintendos NDA. If you need more info about it, you need to register at the nintendos dev portal).
Not even with the LIGHT shader versions. The problem may be something related to the arrays used in the shader not being supported somehow.
**What**
AssetBundle with Scene A has an refrence to prefab `[Graphy]`.

When this prefab (and all its assets) is bundled into the same AssetBundle as Scene A it does work.
When this prefab (and all its assets) is bundled into its own AssetBundle it does not work.

**Cause**
This seems to be connected to a limitation of unity, which causes it to be unable to load shaders at runtime from AssetBundles.

**Solution**
The shader fields on the prefab must be replaced with materials in order to be loaded at runtime (as far as I know)



I can work around this with including graphy into the main application but I'd love to use graphy as an optional module.
Hi,
first of all great asset, I bought it a few month before you made it free and it's served me right on all my project since.

I like to use [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) on my projects so that if I'm reusing an asset I can have 1 separate repository for the asset. I would love to do this with graphy without having to use the asset store but since this repository contains all the unity project and not just the `Graphy - Ultimate Stats Monitor` folder I can't do it.

I would suggest only having this folder in the repository.
Remake the Graphy UI using Vertical and Horizontal Layout Groups.
