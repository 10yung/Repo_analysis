Is there any guide how to host this in production?
This removes ~60 lines of boilerplate.

Anchors don't work in basic-http-server. Naming is wrong.
(these two are actix-web based, http-server-rs has been updated recently to latest)

- [http-server-rs](https://github.com/gdamjan/http-server-rs)
- [simple-webserver](https://github.com/foundpatterns/simple-webserver) ([a torchbear app](https://github.com/topics/torchbear))
Also pass config object around so it's easier to access config settings.


Also give good error message when address is in use.

I've reopened this PR. If you want to test it before merging

```
git remote add derekdreery https://github.com/derekdreery/basic-http-server
git fetch derekdreery
git checkout derekdreery/handle_addr_in_use
```

(I hate looking up git commands so I thought I'd save you the trouble :P)

It should work - I'm not sure why it wasn't for you. Maybe it was to do with a merge artifact, which this shouldn't exhibit since it's rebased on master.
This PR adds an option to redirect all file misses to the path '/index.html'. This is useful for single-page apps where the routing is done client-side. I'm raising this as a draft PR because it's a new feature out of the blue, and you might not want it. :)
At the moment it seems that on every request, a file is loaded from disk. Can this be cached?
