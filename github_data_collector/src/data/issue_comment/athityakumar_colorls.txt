After upgrading to colorls 1.3.1 the git-status icons for directories are missing. The git-status icon is displayed correctly for files.

Steps to reproduce:

```sh
mkdir colorls-stuff
touch test.txt
mkdir foo
touch foo/bar.txt
git init
git add .
git commit -am"initial commit"
colorls -l --gs
cd foo
colorls -l --gs
```
Note the missing git-status icon for directory `foo` in screenshot below.

- OS: Arch Linux
- colorls installed via pacman (Source: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ruby-colorls/)

Hi,

I've recently found that's not possible to pass -Z arguments to the command, like for example

```bash
ls -lrtZ /home/$USER | grep -v $(matchpathcon /home/$USER)
```

Could it be possible to add it?

Thanks!

### Description
It would be nice if (especially on case-insensitive file systems like APFS) directory names were checked case-insensitively. This already seems to be the default behavior for file extensions, so it would just be making directories match the existing functionality.

First of all, great project! Thanks for the time and effort you have shared!

I'd really like to be able to import hex color codes directly into the yaml file for reading by rainbow, this would allow theme compatibility with other tools such as pywal.

So far i've tried stringifying and dropping the leading # from the hex string etc but the dark_colors.yaml file seems to only accept rainbow color name descriptions. Apologies if i have missed something, any help is gladly appreciated.
setup:
1. Ubuntu (app is displayed as Ubuntu (not Ubuntu 18.04 or Ubuntu 16.04. just Ubuntu)) inside Windows AppStore
2. tried with "ruby" and "ruby-full" apt packages
3. tried with and without "-- --use-system-libraries"
-----------------
This is error I'm getting. Any ideas on how to fix? Thanks

In the output of `-l`, it'd be nice if we could also include a "header row" that shows information about each column. Is this possible?
