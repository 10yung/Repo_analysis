### Steps to reproduce*

This maybe a question more than an issue with CSV but I'm trying to make email confirmation sometimes required and sometimes optional depending on the circumstances.

Note when testing the validation 

### Expected behavior*
By default CSV should not validate email confirmation because it is conditional. If `validate: true` is passed then it should validate.

### Actual behavior*
Always validates `email_confirmation` regardless of what `validate_email_confirmation?` returns

Note: testing this out serverside validations work as expected

### System configuration*
**Rails version**: 5.2

**Ruby version**: 2.4.1

**Client Side Validations version**:
    client_side_validations (11.1.3)
    client_side_validations-simple_form (6.10.0)

### Code snippet from your model of the validations*
```
    validates :email, presence: true, confirmation: true
    validates :email_confirmation, presence: true, if: :validate_email_confirmation?
```

### The whole form code from your template*
```
        = simple_form_for @contact_message, validate: true  do |f|
          = f.input :email
          = f.input :email_confirmation
```

### The resulting HTML*

### Browser's development console output*
- [x] I confirm that my browser's development console output does not contain errors

### Additional JavaScript Libraries*
_If your issue depends on other JavaScript libraries, please list them here. E.g: *Bootstrap Modal v3.3.7, jQuery UI Datepicker 1.12.4*._
N/A
### Repository demostrating the issue
Debugging CSV issues is a time consuming task. If you want to speed up things, please
provide a link to a repository showing the issue.
- I can provide if required

**\*** Failure to include this requirement may result in the issue being closed.

Add a callback when CSV has been initialized to run custom code

This will prevent the need of duplicating initialization code and check for turbolinks / jquery

## What's new?

### Proper SemVer
A proper SemVer allows us to **break things very badly**. The first feature which will be removed from CSV will be the middleware.

### The Middleware
If you want need the middleware, stay on 6.0 but please note that it will not be supported and bugfixes/new features will not be backported by me.

If there is someone who wants to maintain the middleware as a separate gem, you are the welcome!

Please note that you may also need to import the middleware from the mongoid plugin

When using numericality: greater_than with other model attributes, if i remove 1 of the fields, it doesn't show any messages anymore, but when i try to submit, i'm getting server validation fail. I suppose it's better to reproduce server side behaviour for that case

validates :maximum_players,
          allow_nil: true,
          numericality: { only_integer: true, less_than_or_equal_to: 2147483647, greater_than_or_equal_to: :minimum_players }

validates :minimum_players,
          allow_nil: true,
          numericality: { only_integer: true, greater_than_or_equal_to: 0, less_than_or_equal_to: :maximum_players }

At the moment travis is only running ruby related tests (`rake`). There is another suite of tests (`rake test:js`) which only runs locally. I would like to see unit tests run on the cloud. Running on travis with phantom.js is ok, saucelabs would be way better

Anyone can help on this?

TIA
