It would be great to have a dark theme for the website to spare my eyes in the evening.
This center aligns the heading in the `no-awards-page` section in the awards page. The page is designed to center align the paragraphs and the buttons but the heading is left aligned. This disrupts the page styling on tablet screen especially that of an iPad.

#### Issue in focus
There are no issues related to this. This make the design consistent for smaller screen devices.

The changes were tested using the responsive mode on Firefox 71 and Chromium 79
When recording or validating, text appears above the record/play button saying things like:

> Great work! Listen again when you're ready
> 2 down, keep it up!
> Last one!

These sentences aren’t all that useful and it seems like that area could be better used to provide genuine help. For example:

> Press Skip to skip a sentence
> You can play back your recordings before submitting
> Background noise is ok as long as the speaker can still be heard clearly
> Report a sentence if it doesn’t make sense
> Don’t say punctuation out loud
> Set goals from the Stats page
> Don’t repeat a sentence - re-record if you make a mistake

This would aid in feature discovery and educate users to create recordings that are more likely to pass validation.

Currently the text appears to be fixed depending on which clip number is being recorded. It would be better to have a list of more than five help phrases and randomly choose between them.
During the sentence recording there is a little "basket" icon that lets you share the link voice.mozilla.com to twitter and facebook:

- Why does this exist at every sentence you record?
- It doesn't have a explain text when you hover it like the other two icons.

This icon is very confusing for me and I don't find it useful at this position at all. Do I misunderstand this feature?  
Hi,
During the schema creation in MySql has_login column is not added in user_clients table. But when we bring up the webpage on http://localhost:9000, the client makes some requests to the api and we get this error in the backend :

/api/v1/en/clips/votes/daily_count Unknown column 'has_login' in 'where clause'. 

There is a query for altering the user_clients table and add this column but that does not seem to execute which is causing this error. Could someone please guide us on how to resolve this.
Hi! 

I would like to suggest a change in the User Dashboard interface. I think it would make sense that if I select a language other than "All" in Your languages ("Čeština" in my case), the Top Contributors and Contribution Activity should switch to statistics for that selected language by default, as this is presumably what the user wants to see when they switch to a specific language.

If you think this change is worth accepting, I am willing to help out in implementing it. 

Best Regards,
Jan Koscielniak

The big change in this PR is that we're upgrading React / React DOM from v16.8 -> v16.12. Unrelated / minor changes are broken into separate commits.

There are no breaking changes in this version of React, but I clicked around to ensure there were no obvious breakages. I paid special attention to API changes / deprecations detailed in https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md.

Remember: you may need to kill existing Docker processes / images to ensure dependency updates happen within `docker compose`.
Note: The values in here are somewhat out pulled out of a hat, might need adjusting

Fixes #2493
