Original author seems to have removed the repo, found a fork.
Hi there,

I hate to do such self-advertisement but I came across this project and though IVRE might be useful here.

Maybe you'd like to have a look at it? If so:
* Website: https://ivre.rocks/
* Github: https://github.com/cea-sec/ivre/

Please let me know if I can help you somehow or if you have any questions.
Bye finishing downloading all the repos I was looking at a few like Delivery and Phishing manage to notice that only 2 of them were actually downloaded CredSniper and Modlishka then the '{Reconnaissance' folder I don't know why there is an extra one and its recursively shown by many other empty folders.

But still what an incredible script and really awesome tools please do keep it up!!
when i run the tools bas shr3dkit.sh it download the requirments after that nothing happened ?
