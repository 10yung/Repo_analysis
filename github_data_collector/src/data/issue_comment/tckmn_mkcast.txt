- Using `screenkey` official repo as submodule.
- Fix bug in `mkcast`, shown in `newcast`. Fix #30.
- Modify `Makefile`. Don't `install` but `ln -s`.
- Add an installation script for `Debian`.
I propose to package mkcast for debian (and maybe fedora, if it runs successfully on it). I am a beginner and would love to package it. Also I think of creating a docker image for mkcast. What do you think?

It looks as though something is adding extra quotes to escape, but doing it badly.  Running the newcast script with -x, I get the following (right before it blows up):

```
+ ENDCMD='--exec "bash -c '\''while kill -0 25811; do :; done'\''" '
+ echo ENDCMD= --exec '"bash' -c ''\''while' kill -0 '25811;' do ':;' 'done'\''"'
ENDCMD= --exec "bash -c 'while kill -0 25811; do :; done'"
+ byzanz-record -x 279 -y 230 -w 808 -h 538 --exec '"bash' -c ''\''while' kill -0 '25811;' do ':;' 'done'\''"' out.gif
```

Notice the extra quotes in the byzanz-record commandline; this is what's causing me grief, I believe.

Any ideas? Running ubuntu 14.04

Thanks!

Gives error message whenever wmctrl is not installed and quickly exits the program.

Happy to debug if needed. Just used the `newcast` command to test

On Fedora 20 byzanz-record doesn't have an --exec argument. This makes `newcast` inherently broken.

First, I read https://github.com/KeyboardFire/mkcast/issues/5 and I liked the idea of having the option to make the screenkey screen not automatically hide. I use a tiling window manager (Xmonad) by default, and this enables me to use (a small variant of) mkcast there instead of flipping to GNOME.

This causes no changes on behalf of the user at the moment. On the other hand, the functionality is not viewable at the moment either. I'm only partially proficient at bash scripting (embarrasing to say), and I'm not sure of the best way to take a flag given to mkcast or newcast and to pass it to screenkey. But this should be easy. I foresee the ability to type `newcast -n` and have the `-n` flag ultimately passed to screenkey "nohide".

Get an error when running this on Ubuntu 14.04.

```
$ newcast

Error persists after installing missing `wmctrl`:

I use Tmux from within Terminator, if that has any value.

I use the LXDE desktop environment. My default terminal emulator is evilvte.
I changed "gnome-terminal" to "evilvte" in newcast script and the program did record a gif. The quality is good. However, it recorded the whole desktop instead of just the terminal. I believe fetching the dimensions of the evilvte window failed.
This might be reproducible with any terminal emulator other than gnome-terminal. Can you please add support for some more terminal emulators other than gnome-terminal?

Hello, I think will be awesome if put the translations on Transifex and get contributions for another languages (inclusive my language portuguese).
