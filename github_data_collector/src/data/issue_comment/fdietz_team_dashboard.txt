Trying to hook it into Travis for the last week..cant find any documentation on how to activate it, how it points to Travis with creds/no creds or URLs to your GitHub account and how to troubleshoot common problems. It just doesnt seem to do anything...just looks at me...(mocking me...)
Fix compatibility issue with mysql 5.7 based on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37315546/uninitialized-constant-activerecordconnectionadaptersmysql2adapternative-d

Big dump to re-synchronize with averell23 version.

Since we made a number of modifications, I don't see any way to break this down into neat little pull requests, at least not within my available time.

Changelog includes:
- **secrets.yml/BackendSettings configuration replaced** with betterplace's configuration gem. Reasons in e55d894f42b19cfd6e07781f08635931d666bbdf commit message
- New plugins for jenkins/pingdom as status tables
- Update to ruby 2.1.5, updated gems
- Some bug fixes

It would be great if you could review and merge this, so that we can continue to work on the same code base.

Is this dashboard IE compatible? If yes and it's not too much trouble for what version of IE is this dashboard compatible for. Thank you.

Ok, here's another one for you :)

The previous implementation of the sensu data source would return an error if you specified a server filter but the event list didn't contain any events from that server (master on line 60). In this state you actually want a "green" result because it means there are no errors on that server.

I did some refactoring of the code as well.  I'm not a Ruby programmer so I have a feeling there are some non-Ruby-ific style in there.  Also, I tried to test all of the cases and I think they all work (e.g. with/without server filter, with/without event filter, etc.).

Give this one a thorough review before accepting it.

If the user presses "enter" while naming a dashboard a "br" tag is added to the name that cannot be removed. Many people press enter thinking it will commit the name change so this bug shows up very frequently.

Take a look at all the test dashboards on the hosted site for examples

Hi Frederik,

I added a TeamCity CI provider. 

It is unit tested as well as manually tested against TeamCity 8.1.x. 

If you want to verify it you can download TeamCity for free. In order to use the TeamCity REST API without credentials you have to enable guest access. 

You should configure the widget with the TeamCity host (e.g. `http://localhost:8111` without trailing `/`) and the project id. If you hover a project in TeamCity you see a link like `http://localhost:8111/project.html?projectId=peeone&tab=projectOverview`. In that example `peeone` is the project name that needs to be configured when setting up the widget.

I although updated ruby to 2.1.0. I hope this is fine;) Further I added `gem sqlite3` in order to skip installing mysql. To clean things up I extended `.gitignore`.

Regards, Leif 

Thanks :smile: 

I want to use the number widget to get only the latest datapoint from a graphite target, is there a way to accomplish this? I don't mind modifying the code, but I can go around it. 

Basically I just want not to add any aggregate function and just get the real number of the latest datapoint.

It would be nice to have the option to lock a specific widget to it's place or at least a whole dashboard so that things don't move around accidentally
