let emptyLabel = UILabel()
        emptyLabel.text = "暂无查询内容"
        emptyLabel.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 14)
        emptyLabel.textColor = colorWithHexString(hex: "CCCCCC")
        collection.ly_emptyView = LYEmptyView.emptyView(withCustomView:   emptyLabel)
view.addSubview(collection)
这样添加没有用吗
自定义的视图emptyViewWithCustomView如果是tableView ，tableView的cell点击事件不走代理方法
在iOS13 系统，在App进入后台然后在回到前台会，导致CPU达到100%，具体问题位置没定位出来
应该多增加一个 通过否判断存在组头部,来控制显示隐藏的 好一点,现在这种情况 只能手动的显示隐藏
.ly_emptyView = [LYEmptyView emptyViewWithImage:nil   放在网络请求前设置报错

1.自己遇到的情况是，用了这个之后，提交审核不通过
2.删除之后就审核通过了

拒绝审核通过的原因是：

Your app, extension, or linked framework appears to contain code designed explicitly with the capability to change your app’s behavior or functionality after App Review approval, which is not in compliance with App Store Review Guideline 2.5.2 and section 3.3.2 of the Apple Developer Program License Agreement.
This code, combined with a remote resource, can facilitate significant changes to your app’s behavior compared to when it was initially reviewed for the App Store. While you may not be using this functionality currently, it has the potential to load private frameworks, private methods, and enable future feature changes. This includes any code which passes arbitrary parameters to dynamic methods such as dlopen(), dlsym(), respondsToSelector:, performSelector:, method_exchangeImplementations(), and running remote scripts in order to change app behavior and/or call SPI, based on the contents of the downloaded script. Even if the remote resource is not intentionally malicious, it could easily be hijacked via a Man In The Middle (MiTM) attack, which can pose a serious security vulnerability to users of your app.
Next Steps
To resolve this issue, please perform an in-depth review of your app and remove any code, frameworks, or SDKs that fall in line with the functionality described above and resubmit your app’s binary for review.
