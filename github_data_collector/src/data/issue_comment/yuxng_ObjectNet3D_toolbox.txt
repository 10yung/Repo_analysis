  First, thanks for your great work, we've been writing a paper about indoor scene object pose estimation, your dataset would be a great help to us.
     But, your annotate_pose.m seems can only work on the images that belong to your dataset.
     After viewing the source code ,it seems like  that   we need to have a corresponding annotation file first.  
     So, how can I  make my own annotation files, and what is the annotation format? Thanks.
