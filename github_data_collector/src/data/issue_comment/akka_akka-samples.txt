This includes the feedback from this PR:https://github.com/akka/akka-distributed-workers-scala.g8/pull/19/files

It now uses the receptionist 
I guess I'll do a PR with updates to the Scala sample first and then follow up with the Java one so that they are aligned.

Corresponding for Scala was https://github.com/akka/akka-samples/pull/156

Todo

* [x] Add query side via gRPC or HTTP to show advantage of processing happening in a sharded actor rather than just locally
* [x] Running the sample instructions, including start processing with 1 node, then increase the size of the cluster and showing the shards moving as the partitions move between consumers
* [x] update producer to send messages that update the running totals
* [x] add to travis 
* [ ] Upgrade to a released akka version once dynamic sharding has been reelased
When the consistent hashing router is completed akka/akka#27729 we should update the cluster samples to use that for the Worker routing

https://github.com/akka/akka-samples/pull/137/files#r341505873
from "com.typesafe.akka.samples"

we can do this as a global search replace across all samples in 2.6 branch
Update all samples Akka 2.6 and convert to Akka Typed (if relevant). Also revisit if the sample makes sense, adds value or should be removed.

Creating this as an overview, even though not all samples are located in this repository.
