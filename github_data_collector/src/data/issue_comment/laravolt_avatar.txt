Had to switch to imagick for better image quality but now text is not aligned properly inside the icon with **toBase64**, text was aligned correctly with GD Library without any issues. I am using an Arabic font.

Thanks :)
With SVG output, text is not centered vertically.
Chrome : not well centered
Edge : text is on top

Solution : correct default value + add parameters to give an offset X, Y to the text.

version : 2.1.0
