With iPhone XR , iOS 13.1.3,
`CIFilter(name: "CIQRCodeGenerator")` will crash, and the error message is:

您好:我在使用EFQRCode时,在真机器iPhone X以上机型中:CIFilter(name: "CIQRCodeGenerator") 方法会崩溃,在真机器iPhone X以下,及iPhone 8 等,系统版本均为iOS13.1.3最新的,方法会无缘无故崩溃掉.请帮忙分析以下.谢谢
Expected behavior:
- QR code should scan if it is framed by the rect of interest with a small margin

Found behavior:
- QR code does not scan unless it is significantly smaller than the rect of interest

Steps to reproduce:

- Modify example so that the preview is full screen. (To do this I deleted all constraints on it and used the autoresizing mask to cover all of the superview.)
- Modify the region of interest so that it appears approximately square even though the view is non-square
- Start scanning a QR code from up close, then zoom out
- It will be a while before the region detects the QR code - the QR code is only detected at scales much smaller than the region displayed (see image)

^ this is the maximum scale I could get the QR code to scan with, starting from a close zoom

Tested on iOS 13 with iPhone X






Hello, thank you very much for the cool project!

It could be so good as QRcodeReader will be able to read raw QRcode bytes. In my current project I pack raw bytes into QR code, but default apple implementation prefers string results by reading from QR code. But raw results are also available via KVP. I've made quick-and-dirty solution here https://github.com/LeoSchleicher/QRCodeReader.swift/commit/cb191209d4b5a20ca501d49a9a76e6733c8e6958 - I just pack raw data against string (if the string is available), and I've inserted a global property to allow to finish scanning if raw result is sufficient. I can create a merge request, but my solution is not so elegant. If you give me tips to improve, I'll made this and prepare a better solution 
After scanning a barcode, if you go back to open the scanner, the still image of the previous barcode flashes on the screen, then the preview is reset. How can we fix this to where the previous image is not /cached/ and flashes when we relaunch the qr scanner view controller?
Hi,

I am using the **pod version 8.2.0** in my project.
Sometimes, the scanning controller opens up, but the scanner doesn't work.

Thanks in advance.

Thanks for the wonderful library.
I faced a retain cycle. I'm not sure its just for me.

codeReader.didFindCode & codeReader.didFailDecoding builder should be accessed via weakSelf. Like weakSelf.builder to avoid retain cycles.


Hi,

I am trying to stop camera after validation code.

Example - I am validation domain first after scan because end user may be scan other QR code. So if I am using didFindCode and after that I am validating code if code is not for my app so I start scanning again but in this case camera screen is fluctuating.

Here is my code I am using QRCodeReaderView for custom view  

```
        reader.didFindCode = {[weak self] result in
            guard let `self` = self else { return }
            let url = result.value
            let url1 = URL.init(string: url)
            if let baseUrl = url1?.host{
                if baseUrl == "domain.co" || baseUrl == "domainName.co"{
                  // Some Code Validation 
                    }
                }else{
                    self.snackbar.text = "Invlid QR code"
                    MDCSnackbarManager.show(self.snackbar)
                    self.reader.startScanning()
                }
            }
        }
        reader.startScanning()
```
So please let me know if I am missing anything.

Thanks for great QR example 
First of all, thanks for building this!
