Added the quickstart script to the overhauled Harbor docs.

@kacole2 can you please review? Thanks!
Hi,

If harbor is installed on kubernetes (with ingress and nginx controller). If a get request on /v2/ is sent, the reply (http 401) contains a header www-Authenticate with a wrong realm. It doesn't use the url given in X_Forwarded-Port nor url given in Host headers.

The request received by the harbor-core is : 
```
GET /v2/ HTTP/1.1
Host: harbor-xxxx-1.dyn.xxxx.net
X-Request-ID: 0ff89dd6a132a07e5ba12e93d78c962c
X-Real-IP: 10.158.100.2
X-Forwarded-For: 10.158.100.2
X-Forwarded-Host: harbor-xxxx-1.dyn.xxxx.net
X-Forwarded-Port: 443
X-Forwarded-Proto: https
X-Original-URI: /v2/
X-Scheme: https
user-agent: curl/7.65.3
accept: */*
```

and the reply : 
```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Length: 87
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Fri, 17 Jan 2020 13:03:04 GMT
Docker-Distribution-Api-Version: registry/2.0
Set-Cookie: sid=f60f779453bbb05911e480f53c3ed30b; Path=/; HttpOnly
Www-Authenticate: Bearer realm="http://harbor-harbor-core.default.svc.cluster.local/service/token",service="harbor-registry"

```

This behavior has an effect on skopeo, which uses the Www-Authenticate received to login to the registry.... and is not able to do it!

Hello.

I recently upgraded from 1.8.1 to 1.10.0, using helm on kubernetes.
There are some errors while upgrading, I fixed (might be)...
anyway I can see `helm upgrade` command's normal output without error, and can login the web successfully, and pull and push also no problem.

But please look at this capture.

Is this my problem or 1.10.0's problem?

Thanks,
