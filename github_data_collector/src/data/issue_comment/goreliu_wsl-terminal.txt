请教这个中文说明页面怎么实现的，https://goreliu.github.io/wsl-terminal/README.zh_CN.html，我在goreliu.github.io项目中没有看到对应的文件啊，我觉得这个不错想学习下。
I've updated cygwin and mintty to the latest version and I've replaced wslbridge with wslbridge2 in order to support WSL2
wsl2 can not work
Is this expected to work?  If anyone has gotten it to work, any pointers on what to do?  I did notice that wsltty released an update https://github.com/mintty/wsltty/releases/tag/3.0.6 for it to work with WSL V2.  I'm guessing we might need a similar update from @goreliu?
While using "shell=/bin/bash --login" in conf,  "open-wsl" apply ".profile".
But run *.sh file with "run-wsl-file" don't apply ".profile".  even "whoami" cannot executed in *.sh file.
Is there any way?
When I open a new terminal using open-wsl, the default color appears to be bright white.

I go to options, leave everything as is (base16-solarized-dark.minttyrc), use "Apply" (or "Save") and the colors revert to the lighter gray of Solarized Dark.

I need to do this for every new terminal I open; any way to pass an option to change the theme when opening a terminal?

Thanks!

Open WSL terminal. Alt-space to bring up menu, select options. 

Hang.
在商店装的`ubuntu`, 我姿势不对吗?

When I'm using vim and type `/` and then enter a few searches, if I hit `/` to start a new search and then hit the up and down arrow keys to go through my search history, I just get these:

`<UP><UP><DOWN><DOWN>`
It prints into the editor ;5u for example. This does not happen in wsl bash via the ubuntu launcher.
