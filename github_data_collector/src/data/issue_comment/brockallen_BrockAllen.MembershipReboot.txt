I'm using MembershipReboot as my back-end store for IdentityServer3, but now I need to have a page setup to change passwords. I have done this before in the past when just using MembershipReboot without ID Server but haven't done it with this new type of configuration.

What's the best practice to do this? My client is a AngularJS client.
In my business logic I would like to remove a claim from several users and add that claim to another user within a single transaction.

How could I achieve that this operation of removals and adding happens in one transaction in the SQL database?

I guess I could use the DbContextUserAccountRepository class, edit the accounts and then do a save operation. But I was wondering if there is a better approach.
I know there is a good following of folks that have used this library over the years (as have I) and are in the midst of trying to get to dotnet core from netfx.

My question is ... is there enough interest to push an update that is compiled for dotnet core, and if so, what is the preferred netstandard version we should support?

I've done some preliminary work to get the base library over to dotnet core on netstandard 1.3, but am unsure if this is acceptable, or if we should support netstandard 2.0 now that it has [basically] become a thing.

My motivation for doing this is that I'd like to get onto IdSrv 4.0, but without having much time to learn IdSrv 4.0 & ASP.NET Core Identity frameworks both, I'd rather stick with the user management library I use today, and then put a feature request in to build time into my release schedule to port the MR database over to ASP.NET Core Identity.

Thoughts/Comments?
userAccountService.GetByMobile(string mobile) always returns null even if the mobile is already present.

GetHandlers(evt) method returns no handlers and email is not being sent.
This issue is similar to https://github.com/brockallen/BrockAllen.MembershipReboot/issues/159

Last trace line logged: [UserAccountService.ResetPassword] account not verified -- raising change email event to resend email verification
Not sure if i am missing anything here.
Could you please help?

The ChangeEmailRequest checks the RequireAccountVerification config value. If no verification is required the e-mailaddress is changed without sending a verification request first, which is fine.
However when the e-mailaddress is also the username, the username is not changed by this method. This leads to unexpected behavior. Because when the account was created the user could login with an unverified username (=e-mailaddress) but when we want to change the username (which needs to be done through ChangeEmailRequest because ChangeUsername cannot be used when EmailIsUsername) the verification must be done in order for the change to take effect.
Why? :-)
Is there a list or something of the fixes/changes that went out with 9.0? I can't find anything.
Hello,

we want to make a CustomUserRepository based on our own database repository (no EF, Mongo or Raven). I derive this repo from QueryableUserAccountRepository, register the user & group repo's (as singletons) plus their services with the IdentityManagerServiceFactory and implement the repo-methods. I have some trouble to make it work. I manage to get the list of users on the screen but when I try to edit a single user I get _Error: An error has occurred._ 

Some useful hints would be great.

thanks,
Vincent
Hey Mate,

Just seen that new message on the readme and have a couple of questions.

Our implementation of idsrv currently uses this and an updated version of the RavenDb implementation. I am ok with switching over to the asp.net identity however I just went looking for an updated package for that and noticed that it has not been updated since mid 2015. So I am a little confused as to what package would be best to replace membershipreboot with?

The other thing i'd like to offer is to take on the maintenance of MembershipReboot. We use it at my company and i use for most of the startups that i help with writing auth servers. To convert over right now would be a pain, while i work through understanding what needs to be done for upgrading i'm happing to take on the maintenance.

Is there any option to prevent user from Login after email is updated?
requireAccountVerification = true, prevents login for the first time not every time email is updated.
