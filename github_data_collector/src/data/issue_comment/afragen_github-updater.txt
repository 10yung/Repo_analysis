I can't connect to my private bitbucket theme and plugins. 
I tried to change my BB app password, and enter that into the Github updater settings page, but it will not save them, but revert to the old bitbucker login/pw.
Even after deleting the plugin, reinstalling, and also deleting the corresponding item in the database itself, it STILL reverts to the old bitbucket login/pw.
Even changing the settings in the database directly won't work.
I'm having an issue connecting to an enterprise Bitbucket server. None of my themes and plugins can connect to the server. I have tried setting the Bitbucket URI with these formats:

- https://bitbucket.dev-intranet.fbcna.com:8443/projects/FMCMEW/repos/helpdeskwiki
- https://bitbucket.dev-intranet.fbcna.com:8443/projects/FMCMEW/helpdeskwiki
- https://bitbucket.dev-intranet.fbcna.com:8443/FMCMEW/helpdeskwiki

I have entered my username and password of course. None of the themes or plugins can connect to their repos, as you can see by the red mark:

I copied a multisite to a different domain, changed the urls and everything (GitHub Updater was already installed) and then removed the old theme and plugin and reinstalled it with GitHub Updater.

Everything went fine at first, installed theme + plugin from GitLab, but now (now idea what changed) i can't see the plugin and theme in the GitHup Updater configuration.
Also, when i try to reinstall them, the third input for the access token is not appearing, so i can't reinstall.

Clearing cache doesn't help, and when i activate the 'change branch option', save it, deactivate it and try saving again, i get an 
`Warning: array_merge(): Expected parameter 2 to be an array, null given in .../wp-content/plugins/github-updater/src/GitHub_Updater/Settings.php on line 649`
Warning.

Any idea where i can start looking for the configuration data of GitHub Updater and maybe figure out if sth. is missing?

This originated from a Slack conversation with @sc0ttkclark. It’s probably easier to contain the conversation here.

In thinking about how to engineer this solution it might be best to add to the `class CLI_Integration` with a couple of new commands `plugin branch-switch-git` and `theme branch-switch-git` with similar arguments as `plugin install-git`.

Install was easier as we already had that class. Update/Branch switch might be a little trickier. There’s no class currently for it. Perhaps use the URL for branch switching and send to a `wp_remote_post`? Not sure.
I have created a [GitHub Updater team for Slack](https://github-updater.slack.com).

Anyone can join and any member can send out invites. Any member may create a new channel.

Please let's keep actual issues here but any other discussion should take place in Slack. Please [click here for an invite](https://github-updater.herokuapp.com).

The [golden rule](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule) applies. Everything is quite unrestricted at the moment. If I find the need to restrict something I will let everyone know.

I hope you all choose to participate. I enjoy the feedback and the engagement.

GitHub Updater is now dogfooding it's own Language Pack updates. Translation files reside in a separate repo, https://github.com/afragen/github-updater-translations

**Translators**
The main plugin will always contain the most recent POT file, as will the official Language Pack repo.

I'm getting prepared for the next release and many new strings have been added. Please make PRs to afragen/github-updater-translations

Well, I think I've gotten Travis-CI working and now all I need are some unit tests to make this work.

This is a great opportunity to contribute. Thanks!

I'm going to need some help with this.
