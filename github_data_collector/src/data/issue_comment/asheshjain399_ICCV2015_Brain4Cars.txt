I don't have dropbox pro.  This makes the downloading of the data painful since I continue to receive [the folder is too large to download message](https://www.dropboxforum.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/201445459-Message-the-folder-is-too-large-to-download-).

Is there another site, ftp even, that has the data set that I can grab in one download?  Or do I just need download the files from dropbox a little bit at a time?
