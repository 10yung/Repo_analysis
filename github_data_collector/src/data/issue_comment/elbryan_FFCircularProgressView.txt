Please can you do a new cocoapods release. The latest pod version isnt in sync with the latest code in the repo
Add a flag called hideCompletionIcon that skips the drawing of the check mark upon completion.

Adds a flag for using a play icon instead of download icon.

I would like an option to use this control in indeterminate mode. A ring spins around but does not actually show progress. This could be our UIActivityIndicator replacement. MBProgressHUD support both determinate and indeterminate modes which is nice.

Food for thought!

using FFCircularProgressView makes table view slow on ipad we show about 18 instances of FFCircularProgressView and scrolling is slow

any ideas how to speed up?

Hi,

having an upload arrow would be a nice addition.
