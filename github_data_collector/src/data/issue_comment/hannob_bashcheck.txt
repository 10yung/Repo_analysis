#36

added a -c option to remove colour

GNU bash 2.05b does not do “{1..3}” expansion, which leads to mis-detecting
a fully patched bash on Debian sarge (my own packages) as vulnerable to
CVE-2014-7187 and missing CVE-2014-7187; expand those bashisms to keep
compatible and return correct values even for that version of GNU bash.

bash might not always been in /bin/

I'm having a cosmetic issue: When run on a black-on-white terminal, at least the yellow output is nearly complete unreadable and I have to copy-and-paste it to be able to actually read it. Please either provide a switch to deactivate coloring or detect whether the output goes to a terminal and show colors only then, so that './bashcheck | cat' removes the colors, like ls does.

In the BusyBox-Kernel (for instance on QNAP-NAS) the 'mktemp'-command have no support for the '-t'-switch and right problems to create subdirs in some dircetorys.
