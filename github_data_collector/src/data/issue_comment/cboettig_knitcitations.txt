Hi, I am currently co-authoring an R Markdown Cookbook and thought this would be a nice package to include as an alternative to the typical bibliography workflow. Will be looking to play around with the package as I have not previously used the package, but I just wanted to check the status of the project? The repository looks like it is in a good state :)

If you were interested in it being included, would it be possible to use content from your README file? Another alternative would be for you to write updated content if you were interested. Let me know your thoughts!

Thanks,
Michael
Here is my reproducible example. When I use `citep()` with the `citation()` function, I get an error. I'm running Windows 10, R 3.4.3; RStudio 1.1.383. My `sessionInfo()` is listed below, along with the code that produces the error `Error in nchar(aut) : invalid multibyte string, element 1`.

Note: `citep()` works fine for most of the other packages I'm currently citing in my project. I would appreciate any suggestions on how to fix this citation for the `dplyr` package.

To cite package ‘dplyr’ in publications use:

  Hadley Wickham, Romain Francois, Lionel Henry and
  Kirill Müller (2017). dplyr: A Grammar of Data
  Manipulation. R package version 0.7.4.
  https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr

A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is

  @Manual{,
    title = {dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation},
    author = {Hadley Wickham and Romain Francois and Lionel Henry and Kirill Müller},
    year = {2017},
    note = {R package version 0.7.4},
    url = {https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr},
  }
```

knitcitations seems to be broken by me (used to work before).
citep("doi") works, but then 
bibliography() returns the error mentioned above.

if I use write.bibtex, it does write the bib file correctly.

citing R packages works, btw. 
I am the only one with the problem?
Date not in most recent DESCRIPTION file. Open #34

I'd like to use `knitcitation` outside RStudio, specifically in the CRAN build and check process, using an .Rmd file.  I have the vignetteEngine set to knitr.  In the vignette I'm doing:

``` r setup, echo = FALSE
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("knitcitations"))
cleanbib()
jnk <- read.bibtex("unmixing.bib")
```

 and then where I want an inline citation I'm doing

   `r citep("SomeAuthor2011")`

But the system doesn't see my .bib file doing this (I don't think `read.bibtex` was really intended for use this way).  Since it is the CRAN system I don't think I can do any yaml.
Is this possible?  Or is another package the better way to go? Thanks.

Dear Dr Boettiger,

First of all, thanks for providing this package, it's really quite useful for me!

I've been using the `citep` function in my text and it works well, however, when trying to use the `bibliography` command, I can only get the plain no-argument version to run (`bibliography()`).

I tried using `bibliography("html")` but that throws error messages:

```
Error in mget(nom, envir = .BibOptions) : invalid first argument
Calls: <Anonymous> ... bibliography -> PrintBibliography -> BibOptions -> mget
```

I also tried using `bibliography(style = 'nature', sorting = 'ynt')`, which generated this message:

```
Error in cat(list(...), file, sep, fill, labels, append) : 
  argument 1 (type 'list') cannot be handled by 'cat'
Calls: <Anonymous> ... withCallingHandlers -> withVisible -> eval -> eval -> bibliography -> cat
```

I'd appreciate any advice you might have in fixing these issues!

Best,
~Lina

PS: this is the output of sessionInfo in case it is useful.

Hello:

Your package is very, very usefull, currently I am trying to use it to send a mansucript to the Journal of Statistical Software. In their papers, the in-line citations (citep or citet) have a link to the bibliography. I can't find a way to do that using knitcitations. Is that at all  possible?

```

but when I use the link http://dx.doi.org/10.1684/ejd.2008.0573 the site opens,

Other DOIs work well. This happens for selected DOIs only. 

I tried to generate a bibentry for a NBER working paper with a doi "10.3386/w15616" (`citet("10.3386/w15616")`), but got the following error

``` r
Ignoring entry 'Chetty_2009' (line1) because:
    A bibentry of bibtype ‘TechReport’ has to specify the field: institution

Error in if (entry$key %in% keys) { : argument is of length zero
```

I wonder if this is something that can be fixed, because I do find the an institution field provided by the NBER website http://www.nber.org/papers/w15616.bib:

``` tex
@techreport{NBERw15616,

 abstract = {How can price elasticities be identified when agents face optimization frictions such as adjustment costs or inattention? I derive bounds on structural price elasticities that are a function of the observed effect of a price change on demand, the size of the price change, and the degree of frictions. The degree of frictions is measured by the utility losses agents tolerate to deviate from the frictionless optimum. The bounds imply that frictions affect intensive margin elasticities much more than extensive margin elasticities. I apply these bounds to the literature on labor supply. The utility costs of ignoring the tax changes used to identify intensive margin labor supply elasticities are typically less than 1% of earnings. As a result, small frictions can explain the differences between micro and macro elasticities, extensive and intensive margin elasticities, and other disparate findings. Pooling estimates from existing studies, I estimate a Hicksian labor supply elasticity of 0.33 on the intensive margin and 0.25 on the extensive margin after accounting for frictions.},

I am seeing this error on my Windows machine, but not Mac. I am assuming some settings on my Rstudio/R installation with regard to UTF-E encoding is screwed up. I think the output of `rcitep(citation("pander"))` is causing this problem (the \xf3 ?) If anyone please direct me to the right direction to solve this, that would be great. Thanks.
