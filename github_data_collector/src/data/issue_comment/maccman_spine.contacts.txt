Running `hem build` under ubuntu with a fresh install.
Output:

```
node.js:201
    throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick
          ^
Cannot find module: spine/lib/tmpl. Have you run `npm install .` ?
```

The guide / tutorial need's to be updated as the code on the site does not match the cloned code.

Accepted e-mail addresses include test@me, without any TLD. Scanning the source I couldn't find the validation, otherwise I would have fixed it myself.


hi there,

i followed the readme for spine.contacts.
once i start hem server and open http://localhost:9294/ in my browser i get a 500 on http://localhost:9294/application.js
Load path not found for false

what am i missing?

I realize it isn't used by the demo, but someone grabbing this demo to use as an example and wanting to convert it to ajax rather than local storage will hit a problem on line 38 of spine.model.ajax.js
