I got a error message when running 'ipvsadm -l'.

I traced it by gdb,  and found there is a service with two 'dests' on master lcore whereas the same service with only one 'dest' on slave lcores,  so got the error message above.

I checked the code,  but got confused. Why do operations asynchronously in 'dp_vs_set_svc'? As I know, 'keepalived' not support to load configurations asynchronously yet.

I tested the scene below:
Firstly, I add the first 'dest' to a exist service, 'multicast_msg_send' return immediately after sent requests to all slave lcores, but do not wait for any replies,  and add 'dest' continuously on master lcore.  
Then, I add the second 'dest' ,  but get anther error message: 'repeated sequence number for multicast msg' because the previous message reply still in queue.
Finally, I run 'ipvsdam -l', and get the same message i mentions at the begining.

It seems like a bug. 

* scheduler module for both data and control plane
* worker performance tuning method
* per-cpu inetaddr and sapool
* async lcore msg for inetaddr/svc/dest/sapool
* mempool underflow bugfix and neigh mempool
* toa crash bugfix




functions as well.
- dp_vs_dest_set_avail()
- dp_vs_dest_clear_avail()
- Keep conformity of the same function name style, module_name_verb() like
  dp_vs_conn_get().
- Remove dp_vs_copy_stats() that has no definition.
**when i make the dpvs,i suffer it:**

**there is a Makefile console:**
```
rm sockopt.o libipvs.o ip_vs_nl_policy.o
make[4]: Leaving directory '/usr/local/dpvs/tools/keepalived/keepalived/libipvs-2.6'

```
**i have instatall openssl ,and the version is OpenSSL 1.1.1d
i have the dynamic library  /usr/local/lib/libcrypto.so,   /usr/local/lib/libssl.so.
my os is ubuntu 16.04.**

how can i do it, thanks a lot!

option. In this mode, dest addr is needed in FDIR instead of dest addr and dest port mask.

NOTICE:
number of laddrs should be greater or equal to number of slave lcores.
Or, some slave lcores will have no laddr causing FNAT fowarding failed in
those slave lcores.
