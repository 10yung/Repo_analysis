On my EC2 instance, I ran the quickstart instructions, and all the Docker containers went up fine. When I access my server through the browser, the notebook comes up fine. However, when I go to create an new notebook, I get the following:

Checking `docker logs` for that container yields the following:
```

I am trying to use JupyterLab using tmpnb.
However, I  am facing some troubles setting it up. 

To avoid duplication of content I am sharing the question I asked on Stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47670983/using-jupyter-lab-with-tmpnb

The question failed to get any response on Stackoverflow. Can someone help me out?
If the proxy loses it's routing table it can cause errors when spawning containers.

For example, let's say I create an ad-hoc container with the user "username". Some time later the routing table is lost (e.g. because of a new deploy). If I try to use that tmpnb, the proxy will route me to spawn another ad-hoc container because it's not in the table. However, since it was created before it still is alive in Docker, meaning that tmpnb will fail to spawn the container and will return a 500 response.
Changing the LICENSE file to current language.
At least that seems to be the case on the demo server: https://tmp58.tmpnb.org/user/kfGh0NpBuzKk/notebooks/Welcome%20to%20Python.ipynb#

For reference, I'm referring to [this functionality](http://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/embedding.html).

Hi,

I'm following this guide: https://github.com/jupyter/tmpnb

I've set up a local installation for a workshop, which works as expected.

Now I need to reverse proxy this installation with my Apache front web server (to share public URL to users)
I need to reverse proxy like this:
`https://my.domain/jupyterworkshop/ ----> http://localserver:8000/`

Which implies final urls like `https://my.domain/jupyterworkshop/user/XnXqexlEzX8f` for example.

But when I'm doing my ProxyPath rule, it always redirect to `https://my.domain/spawn/jupyterworkshop/`

Is there a way to specify a subpath to jupyter tmpnb ?

I don't know if I'm clear, ask me questions if needed.

BTW thanks for all your work on Jupyter!

**Edit: I have it working with docker-compose and the .yml config, but would like to understand what happened with socket connection refused issue.** 

Hi Jupyter team!
Complete Docker newbie here in action (trying to deploy an automated tmpnb environment for PyLadies) - so please be patient!
I am trying to deploy tmbnb on a t2.micro EC2 instance running Ubuntu. 
I have run the following three commands from the tutorial

```
docker pull jupyter/minimal-notebook
export TOKEN=$( head -c 30 /dev/urandom | xxd -p )
docker run --net=host -d -e CONFIGPROXY_AUTH_TOKEN=$TOKEN --name=proxy jupyter/configurable-http-proxy --default-target http://127.0.0.1:9999
docker run --net=host -d -e CONFIGPROXY_AUTH_TOKEN=$TOKEN --name=tmpnb -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker.sock jupyter/tmpnb python orchestrate.py --container-user=jovyan --command='jupyter notebook --no-browser --port {port} --ip=0.0.0.0 --NotebookApp.base_url=/{base_path} --NotebookApp.port_retries=0 --NotebookApp.token="" --NotebookApp.disable_check_xsrf=True'
```

However, the tmpnb docker logs are showing the following errors:

```

My user has been added to the docker group and I've checked the owner of the file /var/run/docker.sock.  It was root:docker. In a vain attempt to fix this I tried changing the owner of docker.dock to ubuntu, but that did not work. 
Unfortunately, searching for answers has not resulted in anything fruitful. 
All tips/comments/help will be super super appreciated! 

Edit: I should add that I've run basic docker examples such as

```
docker run hello-world
```

and they do work ok. 
I just tried to do the quickstart, but alas it is not working.

The server is running on `9999` and not `8000` as stated in the instructions:

> BAM! Visit your Docker host on port 8000 and you have a working tmpnb setup.

When I go to `http://127.0.0.1:9999` I am redirected to a temporary URL: `http://127.0.0.1:9999/spawn/user/KKxt1mJPq754/tree`. Looks fine, but the page does not:

Then I check the `docker logs tmpnb`:

This is reproducible. I tried the whole thing 3 times now, always the same error. Some container is already using a name. When I kill that container and reload the URL I was redirected to, simply another container already uses that name.

I ran the quick start instructions line by line as given, no changes to anything.
In this repository, we use docker-py (in requirements.txt, or in Dockerfile-alpine). This is older package, last version 1.10.6 on pypi is from 2016-11-02. The newer package is called docker (newest ver. 2.2.1 from 2017-03-28). Besides the ambiguous name, docker package is incompatible with docker-py. 

I cannot find the list of incompatible changes, maybe someone will have better luck. I tried to use docker instead of docker-py in Dockerfile-alpine and got a lengthy trace of errors, ending with such "suggestion":
`TypeError: 'ContainerCollection' object is not callable. You might be trying to use the old (pre-2.0) API - use docker.APIClient if so.`

If developers decide to use docker package in the future, the codebase here needs to be adapted. Maybe, this is not a big task, but I am unable to do it.
 
The jupyterhub wiki describes a way to start jupyterhub automatically at startup as a system service: https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/wiki/Run-jupyterhub-as-a-system-service

Is there a way to similarly host a tmpnb server automatically at startup, preferably as a system service as well?
