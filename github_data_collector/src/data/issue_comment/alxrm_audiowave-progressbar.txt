I'm getting this error when building.

Error:(251, 5) error: duplicate value for resource 'attr/progress' with config ''.

Don't know what to do!
Unfortunately this library does not give correct audio wave on marshmallow, nougat and oreo. When I input a file of length 2 seconds and sound starts at 0:00 and ends at 00:01, rest seconds are blank.. then the audio wave shows no blank moments. Instead it shouw as if the there was sound during the whole recording.

Hi
i record voice in telegram and final wave form is like following image

but when i used from this audio for test app the result was like this!

my code is
```java
byte[] soundBytes = null;
try {
    InputStream inputStream = getApplicationContext().getResources().openRawResource(R.raw.f);
    soundBytes = new byte[inputStream.available()];
    soundBytes = toByteArray(inputStream);
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
waveView.setWaveColor(Color.parseColor("#007fff"));
waveView.setScaledData(soundBytes);
waveView.setRawData(soundBytes, new OnSamplingListener() {
    @Override
    public void onComplete() {
    }
});
```

How Detect Correct Raw Data?

Hi, I'm using this library for a personal project where I place the progressbar between an image and a panel, with the default alpha channel it doesn't look very fine. I suggest accepting parameters for the not filled bars color, for the filled bars color and also for the alpha channel instead of using a hardcoded alpha value.
Thanks for this project. I use this in recyclerview, and start progressAnim, there is some problem I think that caused by reuse with recyclerview. For example, the first item`s wave progress will be set for three or four item`s. How can I deal with it? Thanks
Hi
Thank you for the great library.
I wonder where I can find the required array of bytes that I must pass to setRawData(), if I want to play a mp3 file. should I get file input stream and then get the byte array? I tried to do that but the created waves were not Compatible with the voice.
