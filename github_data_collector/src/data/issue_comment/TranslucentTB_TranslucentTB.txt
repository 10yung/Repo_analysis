 - TranslucentTB version: Latest, store version
 - Windows build number: 1909 os build 18363.592
 
This is a weird problem, microsoft pushed a cumulative update last night and i updated but TranslucentTB(store version) doesn't work and just crashes 2 sec after starting the app.
When i use TranslucentTB(github version) it works fine without crash but when all of my settings are lost and when i try to open the color picker to choose an accent the app crashes.
I had a system restore point before the update and i reverted back and everything works just fine. today, i wanted to check if the problem still exists so i updated and my doubts were right, the same problem happens again.
update version: kb4528760 kb4532938
uninstalling these updates doesn't seem to fix the problem only restore point works


2nd Update: system restore doesn't work anymore


 - TranslucentTB version: 7.0.0.0
 - Windows build number: 18363.535
 - Steps to reproduce: After I updated to Windows 10 1909 from 1903 my taskbar does not show the desktop image colour even though I have full clear set everywhere, I can see the clear when on my desktop but not when in a maximised window or start menu opened. Timeline and desktop are fine. I have the dark Windows theme but not the apply accent to the taskbar enabled. This worked completely fine in 1903
 - Expected results: Clear blue taskbar everywhere
 - Actual results: Clear taskbar desktop and timeline
 - Other: Changing to Windows light mode makes my taskbar fully black and hides the Windows Icons along with some other taskbar icons, toggling transparency has no effects

 - TranslucentTB version: <!-- The current version of TranslucentTB you're using. Open the properties of the TranslucentTB.exe file and look at the details tab to find this out. -->

 - TranslucentTB version: 7.0.0.0 2019-0728 Version 4 hotfix 3 <!-- The current version of TranslucentTB you're using. Open the properties of the TranslucentTB.exe file and look at the details tab to find this out. -->
 - Windows build number: 18362.418 <!-- You can find this by opening winver.exe and checking the number to the right of "OS Build" -->
 - Steps to reproduce: Probably related to computer wake up from sleep and/or display changes from one internal laptop display to two external displays and/or going from locked stae to unlocked. For me these states are tightly connected so I have a hard time reproducing the issue separately <!-- What you do that triggers the problem -->
 - Expected results: Translucent is set to be Clear in all options. It should continue to be clear after a display change <!-- What should happen -->
 - Actual results: Sometimes, it becomes "not active at all" on the main display, but it remains Clear on the secondary display<!-- What happens instead -->
 - Other: Manually "Refresh taskbar handles" solves the problem. I could live with a work around like "at Windows Security event 4648 (logon), refresh taskbar handles. But that would require a scriptable access to TTB. <!-- Other things that you feel could help in diagnosing the problem -->

 - Steps to reproduce: <Regular -> clear>
 - Expected results: <All task bars should go clear trans>
 - Actual results: <I have in total 4 monitors and #3 and #4 monitors' task bar go trans. The main monitor and the #2 monitor have no changes.>
I have installed the latest update from the windows store AND off of google, I'm not sure exactly what causes it but after a short while of it working it will just crash, stop working and I have no clue how to fix it or what is causing it.
I try to translation some menu items to Chinese.Maybe you can put it to the [WIKI](https://github.com/TranslucentTB/TranslucentTB/wiki/Tips-and-tricks-for-a-better-looking-taskbar)？

And here are some of my questions:
1.Will the software support start menu transparent in the future?
2.Maybe "Tips and tracks" could be renamed "Help"?

 - TranslucentTB version: 5.0.0.0
 - Windows build number: 17763.504
 - Steps to reproduce: 
    1. Screen standby until extinguished
    2. Wake up the screen and enter the desktop
    3. Found that the software settings have failed
    4. The taskbar is no longer transparent
    5. Need to restart the software to make the software take effect again
 - Expected results: Like the 2017 version, my settings are valid no matter what the circumstances, not an unexpected situation.
 - Actual results: After restarting the screen again, the taskbar transparency effect of the software setting is invalid. It is useless to change the settings. The software must be restarted.
