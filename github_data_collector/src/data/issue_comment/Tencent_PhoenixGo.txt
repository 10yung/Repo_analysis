Hi! I'd like to ask, do you have a plans for update and develop this repository by any way?

1) Will the new version of PhoenixGo be published? Maybe the 40 blocks one.
2) Will you publish the evaluation games from last 2018 year, the ones between the current agents and a candidate networks? Would be interesting to take a look at PhoenixGo's Opening ideas.
so,

one person interested in PhoenixGo asked me if it is possible to add an option to have noise only for the first moves, because it is boring to play always the same opening in the games

for example, this : 

```
enable_dirichlet_noise: 1
dirichlet_noise_alpha: 0.03
dirichlet_noise_ratio:  0.25
dirichlet_noise_min_threshold: 0
dirichlet_noise_max_threshold: 40
```

would add noise only at the first 40 moves @wodesuck 

i am sure that other people are interested in this

big thanks as always @wodesuck 
貌似没有看到，谢谢
Can you release 2 windows releases for modern computers please ?

Computer from google cloud : 
Windows Server 2016
Tesla V100
Intel Xeon Phi (supports AVX512F)

![cpu instructionsv2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38690718/50028570-6ebe4f80-fff0-11e8-9d48-ed128561f7c6.png)


after that the games are played no problem,
but it is slower because no AVX / AVX2 / FMA / AVX512F

- release 1 : supports AVX and AVX2 and FMA
- release 2 : supports AVX512F (in linux it is supported by the compiler)

on ubuntu no problem to use these modern CPU instructions

Since tensorRT does not support batch size higher than 4, there is little benefit to use ubuntu instead of windows (harder to configure too)
So i think these 2 releases for windows and mac would be greatly appreciated :+1: 

can you make these 2 releases for windows (and mac) ?

big thanks ! @wodesuck 

我想要见到最新最强大的网络, 哈哈.
the default config PhoenixGo lost 4:0 to lz 3ef82227  
my command line, cpu.conf is same as mcts_cpu.conf
Black command: D:\tool\valid14\leelaz.exe -g -w D:\tool\valid14\3ef8
White command: D:\tool\PhoenixGo\bin\mcts_main.exe --config_path=D:\tool\PhoenixGo\etc\cpu.conf --gtp --log_dir=D:\tool\PhoenixGo\log --v=1
Black version: 0.15
White version: 1.0
My Mac is 2.6 GHz intel Core i7 8G DDR3 and Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536MB.
when i run star.sh. It show the problems as follow:

start.sh: line 4:  3096 Illegal instruction: 4  ./bin/mcts_main --config_path=etc/mcts_1gpu_notensorrt.conf --gtp --v=1 --log_dir=log

please help to solve it.


As Nvidia said the tensorrt GIE would improve much performance of inference. But i've never seen a report about improvement when tensorRT applied in Gtx 10xx GPUs, especially Gtx 1080ti. Could anyone tell me how much performance of PhoenixGo gained when tensorrt enabled versus tensorRT disabled in 1080Ti.

You don't have to be rocket scientist to know this is beyond saving and moribund

## Soon the Leela Zero GO will go the same route, their steriod injections of ELF are NOT working! It only boosted for two days and now it is FLATLINING and goin ginto cardiac arrest!

**_One benefit of pushing forward open bots that are superhuman is it may force the hand of others as well, now that Fb and Tencent have open sourced their bots that are both much stronger than LZ, maybe Deepmind will come back for thirds and get a fourth place prize in openness to cheapshot score one last PR hooray for Google by open sourcing their AGZ weights to spit in fb's face and to show whos the alpha by mastering the Chinese competition once again.. open competition is good for go. This is truly the end of a human era._**
