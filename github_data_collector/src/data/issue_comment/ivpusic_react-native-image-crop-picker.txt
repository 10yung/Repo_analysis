If the background of the image is white, the choose and cancel buttons are invisible. Adding some shadow fixes this.

CocoaPods install in the example app does not work:

```
$ pod install

Command `config` unrecognized. Make sure that you have run `npm install` and that you are inside a react-native project.

This is because the example app's `package.json` points to react-native CLI v2, which has since been moved to `@react-native-community/cli` V3.

### Expected behaviour,
I wanted to know does this library allow with configuration or some work around  to pick only files with certain max file size? Currently I am facing problem with large file size (20MB), in some devices like Xiomi redmi note 4/5 series. When I select a image with size more than 20 MB, the app crash silently. So to solve this problem , can we check the image size while picking the image, and validate before send for compression or can we list only files with a specific max image size, e.g list images with size less than 20MB?
I don't know whether this kind of behaviour is support or not . Let me know if anyone know.

### Actual behaviour
 List images with size less than 20MB(X MB) or pick image with size less than 20MB(X MB). Can we do this via configuration options? something like 
configOption = {
                compressImageMaxWidth: 360,
                compressImageMaxHeight: 360,
                includeBase64: true,
                multiple: multiple,
                mediaType:'photo',
                showsSelectedCount: true,
               max_file_size: 20 MB  // should list images with less than 20 MB.
            };

Hello, i have the following problem on IOS devices:

When using .openCamera and .openPicker the first attempt works as expected, it opens the camera or the image library, but when i close it and try to open a second time it just freezes and nothing happens. It works fine on android devices. Help will be appreciated.

Solution 1:

It works fine when i put the .openCamera or .openPicker in a setTimeout with 500ms, but i don't think thats a good solution.
