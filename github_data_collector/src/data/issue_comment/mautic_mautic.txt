My Mautic version is: 2.15.3
My PHP version is: 7.1

My problem is: I activated a cron job “/MY_DIR/app/console mautic:emails:send” on cPanel. What do I need to set additionally, since it is not working now? The cron job actually runs, but the messages are stuck in "spool" and no sending is done. I like to let you know that all the SMTP settings are proper and correct - tested and verified this.

These errors are showing in the e-mail that this cron job sends on my account each time it executes: Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ‘$value’ (T_VARIABLE) in /MY_DIR/vendor/aws/aws-sdk-php/src/functions.php on line 36
It is this function: https://gyazo.com/eda7b9e4ac5126a24393ee755ec0e42b

Steps I have tried to fix the problem: Commented out the contents of this function inside { } and another error appeared. Again, commented the "problematic" rows => another error appeared... etc... never ending. So I need to know, what I am doing wrong if so? And what needs to be set on my cPanel so that this may work properly?

I HAVE to use the “Queue” option. That is why I use cron jobs. Can somebody share: is there a bug in the Mautic software in the lines of code I shared on the screenshot upper? What can I do to fix this or how can I do a workaround? If a bug is the case, then where ever I migrate this will be issue again and again.

But when speaking on the subject… actually, my first option with which I started was with “Send immediately” but after sending of the first batch of for instance 100 addresses, the “Send immediately” was stopping, so the process HAD to be started all over again to continue… which apparently is NOT an option in case of mass e-mail sending :( Can you share why was this process stopping, since I could not find out in the configuration what was causing this issue.

Thank you

## Bug Description
1. Try to install M3 either from the released edition or the one hosted on Github.
2. When you reach the point in the installation process, the point to select sending email using queue. 
3. You will get 500 error due to `mkdir` permission issue. 

The error cause is the parameters saved in the file `local.php` which is generated during the installation, it uses the variable `kernel_root_dir` which should point the root directory of M3 installation, instead it points to `app` folder. 

Therefore an error is generated because it tries to create a folder called `default` inside the folder `app/var/spool/default/` but this folder does not exist. instead it should be created at `/var/spool/`.

A quick solution could be changing the folder location to a fixed path, the same problem occur to the folders `cache` and `logs`
