**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

I tried to install oauth2-proxy with `extraArgs.bitbucket-team=myteam`. 
I got pod in CrashLoopBackOff status.

```
kubectl --namespace=kube-system get pods -l "app=oauth2-proxy"
NAME                            READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
oauth2-proxy-68cd79475d-tr9zt   0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   8          17m
```

I checked the pod log, I got : 

```
flag provided but not defined: -bitbucket-team
Usage of oauth2_proxy:
  -acr-values string
 ..... blah blah blah
```
 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to establish OAuth2 between oauth2-proxy and bitbucket (namely team account).


**Additional context**

This https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/15148#issuecomment-551726118 mentioned `bitbucket-team`.  That's why I used
Is it removed in the latest version? 
or the comment is about another chart?
or when bitbucket provider will be supported

#### Is this a new chart

No

#### What this PR does / why we need it:

Updates the version of the kubeless function controller, fixes invalid resource definitions due to kube api and updated CRD handling for helm3 compatibility.

#### Which issue this PR fixes

None

#### Special notes for your reviewer:

The description field on CRDs isn't valid any more and deployment resources live in the apps/v1 api now.
They were all the changes I intended to make, but after the e2e tests failed I needed to include a change to support helm 3 wrt the crds directory.
In helm 3, CRDs in that dir no longer support templating.
This meant that the `kubeless.io/namespace` annotation had to be removed from the functions.kubeless.io CRD.
Because of this the function manager would no longer be able to read the target namespace from the CRD and would default to "kubeless" which may be wrong depending on where the chart was installed.
To fix this I added the KUBELESS_NAMESPACE env var to each container to inform the controllers of the correct namespace.

**Describe the bug**
In https://github.com/helm/charts/commit/6ba801353386aba170d803534f1051f81b784f57#diff-f94f3489fb0810db0ffcc8d410026981, `metrics_path` was added as filter in many expressions. This change breaks the related rules, because `metrics_path` is not present in prometheus metrics.
There is already the comment https://github.com/helm/charts/commit/71d5b06c1547ed2bf7fa3df17873f1f3f27bf7ef#r36782310 which asks about this change but has not get answered yet.

**Which chart**:

**What happened**:

**What you expected to happen**:
Alert `KubeletDown` is not firing.
`absent(up{job="kubelet"} == 1)`

**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):
Install kubernetes v1.17.0 and install this helm chart. 

**Anything else we need to know**:

The query `up{job="kubelet"}` shows the elements like the following:

#### Is this a new chart
No

#### What this PR does / why we need it:
This PR adds the possibility of defining environment variables to be passed to the Verdaccio container, using a common implementation (this one is based on `fluentd`'s chart). The values of these environment variables can be either defined directly (name/value), or from secrets.

Verdaccio plugins (such as `aws-s3-storage` and `verdaccio-github-oauth-ui`) accept environment variables as an easy way to pass configuration, such as AWS or GitHub OAuth credentials. This is very useful, for example, in GitOps, allowing these secrets to be kept encrypted in the repository, instead of in plain text.

**Describe the bug**

We are trying to provision a slack Notification Channels through configuration.
I tried to set basic notification channels configuration using `values.yaml` but one field in settings (which is a secret) through `--set` when releasing it with Helm.

The interesting part that if you hardcode the url (part of settings) inside the `values.yaml` it works perfectly.

When you try to set it using `--set`, Grafana fails with exception: "Alert validation error: Could not find url property in settings"

_values.yaml file:_

```
grafana:
    enabled: true
    notifiers: 
      notifiers.yaml:
        notifiers:
        - name: slack-notifier
          type: slack
          uid: slack
          org_id: 1
          is_default: true
          settings:
            url:
```

```
helm install --name my-release stable/grafana grafana.notifiers.notifiers\.yaml.notifiers[0].settings.url=xxxSlackHookUrlxx
```

**Version of Helm and Kubernetes**:

_helm version_
```
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.0.2", GitCommit:"19e47ee3283ae98139d98460de796c1be1e3975f", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.13.5"}
```

_kubectl version_
```

```

**Which chart**:
- prometheus-operator
- grafana

**What happened**:

_Grafana fails to start with the following logs_

```
t=2020-01-17T15:35:44+0000 lvl=eror msg="Server shutdown" logger=server reason="Service init failed: Alert notification provisioning error: Alert validation error: Could not find url property in settings"
```

**What you expected to happen**:
Grafana notification channel gets created with the right url

**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):
helm install --name my-release stable/grafana --set grafana.notifiers.notifiers\.yaml.notifiers[0].settings.url=xxx

Values.yaml content:

```
grafana:
    enabled: true
    notifiers: 
      notifiers.yaml:
        notifiers:
        - name: slack-notifier
          type: slack
          uid: slack
          org_id: 1
          is_default: true
          settings:
            url:
```

**Anything else we need to know**:


**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Yes. Not having this flag causes route53 entries to intermittently fail, requiring manual modifications to the entries.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Add the flag for aws-evaluate-target-health to the chart. Seen [https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/pull/628](here).

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
The only alternative right now, is manual modification.
