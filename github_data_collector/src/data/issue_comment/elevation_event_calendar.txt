â€¦ the Gem work with Rails 4

when i install the gem and ran with the route /calendar..I am getting the above error. Please some one help me

Removing .scoped call and find(:all...) in events_for_date_range function.  Event calendar now works well in Rails 4.10


- replace query in events_for_date_range

lib/event_calendar/calendar_helper.rb

line  215:                 cal << %(style="padding-top: #{options[:event_margin]}px;">)

should be changed to 
                               cal << %(style="margin: #{options[:event_margin]}px;">)

It would be nice if there was a data-date attribute added to each day.  This way it's more accessible from the outside with javascript

Hi,
i've been using this since rails 3.0.x and it worked fine until i upgraded my rails recently

i've forked your beautiful code, and play around with it
i notice in your lib/event_calendar/railtie.rb
i can see you created your railties class which inherits from Rails:Engine
isnt it supposed to be Rails:Ralitie
i've changed it and it does the magic

Cheers

Hello,

I am trying to launch to heroku and when I go to /calendar nothing shows up. I think it has to do with how this gem works and how it uses static javascript and stylesheet files. Any advice to make this work?

The calender is working fine and when I manually add an event through the console the calender displays it. When I use /calender/new though, the events aren't saved at all and do not display.
