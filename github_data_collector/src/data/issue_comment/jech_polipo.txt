Hello, is it possible to have something similar like --enable-http-violations in Squid?
`DNS: couldn't open /etc/resolv.conf: No such file or directory
config.sample:1: parse error.
Disabling disk cache: path /var/cache/polipo/ is not absolute.
Disabling local tree: path is not absolute.
Couldn't bind: Unknown error
Couldn't establish listening socket: Unknown error`
I want know did it support WINDOWS10x64?
I'm using polipo to convert a sock5 proxy to http proxy. The socks5 proxy works fine as below

    curl -v --socks5-hostname xx.xx.xx.xx:1080 https://www.google.com

But I got `SOCKS protocol error` when using http proxy from polipo.

1. start polipo

    polipo socksProxyType=socks5 socksParentProxy=xx.xx.xx.xx:1080 proxyAddress="0.0.0.0"

2. use the http proxy

    curl -v -x 127.0.0.1:8123 https://www.google.com

        * Rebuilt URL to: https://www.google.com/
        *   Trying 127.0.0.1...

        > Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive
        >

Excuse me, what reason is this?

I'm trying to let polipo make use of large memory, so I increased chunkHighMark to 2G-8K, it works.
If I set it to 2G+1-8K, it would be ignored and set to default value 25165824.

Is this limit desired? or by accident?
Adds the old fix by @jech to return 407 for CONNECT requests when proxy authentication is turned on and no authentication headers are present in the request, instead of dropping the connection. See discussion in https://sourceforge.net/p/polipo/mailman/message/19691768/.

Resolves #93.
Adds project files and missing definitions to compile polipo with Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 Community Edition.
I use ssh tunnel as upstream sock5 server, and polipo will always forward all requests to upstream. this causes access to local network (e.g. `172.16.100.x`, `192.168.0.x`) goes through ssh tunnel.

Can we have a way to ignore such internal networks or given websites/hosts?
I found a strange behaviour while handling CONNECT requests when authentication is enabled. If the client does not provide credentials the connection is just simply closed instead of responding with 401 and demanding (basic) authentication as it happens with regular proxy req's.

Could be tested easily:

```
CONNECT test.service:14442 HTTP/1.1
Host: test.service
Connection: keep-alive

Connection closed by foreign host.
```

... whereas:

```
CONNECT test.service:14442 HTTP/1.1
Host: test.service
Connection: keep-alive
Proxy-Authorization: Basic cHJveHk6dGVzdA==

HTTP/1.1 200 Tunnel established
```

Non-tunneling requests does it correctly:

```
GET http://test.service:14142/ HTTP/1.1
Host: test.service
Connection: keep-alive

HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy authentication required
Proxy-Authenticate: Basic realm="proxy-auth"
```
