If so, why?

A slightly more complicated example than hello world would go a really long way :)

After building the project (i'm running on Mac by the way) with cmake, whenever I try to include the code it says there is no such header in my include directory and it's right. I checked my /usr/include and /usr/local/include and there is no sight of any raphter files. I'm excited to use this library, but I just can't get around this bug. If you could help with this issue you'd be a life saver.

Hi,

Where can i find someone to help us make Raphters work inside Gwan ?

Thanks

It's possible I'm just doing something wrong, but I have an apache server that can run the test script at http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/288 but when I try to run simple (renamed to simple.fcgi) I get a 500 error. The apache logs show:

```
[Mon Dec 12 08:10:04 2011] [warn] [client 127.0.0.1] mod_fcgid: error reading data, FastCGI server closed connection
[Mon Dec 12 08:10:04 2011] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] Premature end of script headers: simple.fcgi
[Mon Dec 12 08:10:04 2011] [debug] mod_deflate.c(615): [client 127.0.0.1] Zlib: Compressed 615 to 378 : URL /simple.fcgi
```

If I run simple directly I get this:

```
> ./simple.fcgi 
content-type: text/html

error: NULL method_str
```

Apache config is up at https://gist.github.com/1467099

Thanks for your help, look forward to trying out Raphters!
