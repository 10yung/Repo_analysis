Is someone able to please post a working, sane nginx tracker conf, please?
Hello to all,

after finally solving a memcache problem, now I am faced with this problem when I go to create the first user and consequently I do not know if the others can have the same problem.

The query is located on the sections / register / index.php page on line 108 - 112.

Hello to all,
installed everything correctly without errors, edited the config.php and with the correct path together with the door and edited the memcached.conf file, restarted the service but when I open the index.php page I always have "Memcache Extension not loaded."

Does anyone have any suggestions to give me?

Thank you

I am using a gazelle site and am subscribed to an RSS feed that works, but after a few weeks, the authkey in the feed changes (server side) and my feed connection breaks. Is there some way to change the feed url format, like for instance, including the password instead of the authkey that will make the feed continue to work without breaking?
toolbox (tools.php) need to contain option to manage and create new forums and manage/delete/add formats to upload and browse pages
Hello,
We have a site under Gazelle, it is functional for 4 months, we would like to make some modifications.

For this we would like to make contact with one or more developers at the origin of Gazelle or who have a great experience.

Contact address: contact@hdf.world

Thank you

Hi,

I installed Gazelle for testing the WhatCD Android app. On my localhost:8080 install I don't get any image art in the "Cover" area of the torrent details page (see pic). I've tried both a URL as well as a local file location c:\ . . . "
I just tested personal profile avatars and they don't work either. Is there an image handler thing I should change? Sorry, I'm a noob!

Any ideas of how to make this work? Thnx!

****UPDATE****
After messing around a bit, I discovered that the problem is that all image handling requests end up rendering with "http://localhost/image.php?c=1&i=" as part of the URL address. This is directly followed by the actual URL "https%3A%2F%2Fs8.postimg.org%2Foac2yuplh%2Fglp.jpg". So, the image location is being defined by Gazelle as "http://localhost/image.php?c=1&i=https%3A%2F%2Fs8.postimg.org%2Foac2yuplh%2Fglp.jpg". 

Can anyone let me know if there's a place change an image setting to remove the localhost/image.php?c=1&i=" portion of image handling? Thnx a ton!!! 
Hello,

if you query the API with group_results=0 a lot of information is missing making the results mostly useless.
Exampe: /ajax.php?action=browse&group_results=1&order_by=time&order_way=desc

Missing group attributes: 
* artist
* groupYear
* releaseType

Missing torrent attributes:
* editionId
* artists
* remastered
* remasterYear
* remasterCatalogueNumber
* remasterTitle
* media
* encoding
* format
* hasLog
* logScore
* hasCue
* scene
* vanityHouse
* time

Looks like the theme gallery images inside of the user account page are broken.
