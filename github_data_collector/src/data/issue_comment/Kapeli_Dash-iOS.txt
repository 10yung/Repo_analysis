Transferred .docset files from Mac to iPad via (now) Finder on Mac (by dragging and placing converted .docset file to Dash on device) don’t appear to be installed on iPad. Transfer Docsets tab show the file, but nothing is recognized on device as a reference. 
Hi, RoR updates seem to have stalled; Rails 6 has been out for 3 months, but does not show on the list of docsets to download.
When trying to access MySQL documentation for autocommit the app starts to load and then crashes.
Hello. 

I'd like to request dark mode be implemented for the iOS Dash app. The app is quite useful and with the new iOS 13 update, a dark mode option is now native. Since it's mostly text, black on white text in Dash can become an eye strain after long hours.

Thank you for your consideration in advance. 
I was listening to some music while I was working this morning and I noticed that when I typed something into the search field, the music would stop. I had AirPods in, so I disconnected those and tried it again while playing music through the iPad speakers and it had the same result.

The iPad I was using is a 12.9” iPad Pro, 3rd generation, running iOS 12.4.1.

Music was streaming through the Apple Music app. No music is stored on the device.
Dash crash when navigate into _Available Services/EC2_ with the "User Contributed Docset" for boto3 v1.9.226 downloaded.

HW: iPad pro 2018 12,9. 
iOS: 12.4.1

Dash version installed from App Store: 1.8.13


The Java SE12 docset is missing.

Also the way the app sorts the Java docsets in the download screen is unnatural. Starts with Java SE11, then goes from 6 to 10.

EDIT: And since 17/09/2019, Java 13 is released. The Java SE13 docset needs to be added too.
~~Searching for a docset seems broken. I type “cm” into the docset search and “Craft” comes up but not “Cmake”.~~

Searching for a docset hides the first result under a nearly opaque grey bar. Note in the below screenshot, I expect to see "CMake", but it is only faintly visible.

When rotating between landscape/portrait, you can lose your open document and position. I have encountered this issue on an iPhone XS Max running iOS 12.3.1.

Steps to recreate:

 - Search for something.
 - View an article.
 - Rotate into landscape mode (on my iPhone XS Max, this shows the search view and the document view side-by-side)
 - Rotate back to portrait

Expected behavior: Show the document view

Actual behavior: Shows the search view
