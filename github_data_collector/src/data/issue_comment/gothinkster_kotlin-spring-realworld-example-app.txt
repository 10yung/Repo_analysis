@Email(message = ......) (But it doesn't)
```

Can we add a docker-compose to run the whole application and  load the dependencies such as the database?
Does the back-end have a designated place for serving up static resources (eg JS, CSS, and HTML files)?
Hi, I am working on adding this project as a part of [my amalgam of various demos](https://github.com/dancancro/great-big-example-application/tree/blogwithkotlin/src/main/kotlin/org/exampleapps/greatbig) and I have a couple questions.

1) Why did you choose not to use Spring Security?

2) How does the tagList of an Article work? 
I'm getting the following error from [this code in my app](https://github.com/dancancro/great-big-example-application/blob/blogwithkotlin/src/main/kotlin/org/exampleapps/greatbig/domain/Article.kt#L29) and I'm wondering why I don't get it in the original
