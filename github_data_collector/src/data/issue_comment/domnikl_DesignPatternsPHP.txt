Github Actions should also test building documentation for pushes and pull requests to check for broken docs. Seems like there is a Docker container for that: https://hub.docker.com/r/readthedocs/build/
Docs using Sphinx should be build in a Python container and then copied over to a fresh nginx container to serve the docs, no PHP needed here.
For example mediator have the next demonstration, but in the phpstorm is not the same. It create wrong picture. It's problem of php. Bcz only php 7.4 and above support Typed Class Properties. reverse engineering php with phpdoc will be work correctly with earlier versions of php.
