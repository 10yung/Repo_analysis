I'm having trouble viewing these notebooks on Github.  Downloading the repository and trying to open the notebooks locally is returning the following error: 

Unreadable Notebook: Y:\pdata\174741\Project Info\Python_Scripts\misc\Cognitive-Vision-Python-master\Cognitive-Vision-Python-master\Jupyter Notebook\Computer Vision API Example.ipynb NotJSONError('Notebook does not appear to be JSON: \'{\\n "cells": [\\n {\\n "cell_type": "m...')

Was wondering if I can use the same model for PDF's and TIFF images that have handwritten text on the document similar to the below implementation

A C# Example for using Cognitive Vision on Real time videos can be found here. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/vision-api-how-to-topics/howtoanalyzevideo_vision

I cannot find something similar for Python.
How would I go about do that in Python?
from __future__ import print_function   
needs to be moved to the top. Otherwise gets errors! 
I was wondering whether we could have a client library in Python that is more in sync with the windows client for the service. 

I could contribute something I wrote while working on a project recently.
