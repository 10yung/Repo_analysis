Because the latest release does not work on Catalina, I've build the latest version of SpotMenu from source on macOS 10.15.2. It builds fine, but it crashes on startup. The message is:

```

The app seems like it's stuck when I highlight over the frozen image I just get the mac spinning rainbow.

I can't figure out how to quit the application.

MacOS Version: 10.15

Version 1.9.0

Hi,

I am creating an automated installation script for all my needed and most wanted apps. Is there a way to export my specific settings, so that on a new system I just need to import/replace the settings file and it is already as I set it before? 

Thanks in advance and thank you for the great app!

greetings
### Description

I have a multiple monitor setup - 2 displays and my MacBook Pro's built in display. When working on another display, the menu bars on other displays goes semi-transparent. At this point, the menu bar icon becomes invisible. This can be shown below:

Occurs both on dark mode and light mode.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Click on the desktop of a second configured display
2. Observe the change shown above

**Expected behavior:** Some similar but more translucent icon is shown

**Actual behavior:** Icon goes invisible

**Reproduces how often:** Always

If the menu bar item is placed too far to the right, the popover overflows.

Hi,

First of all thanks for your work, it's really amazing and exactly what I needed.

I would like to ask you just one thing - some song titles are really long (ex: "Eric Clapton - Key to the Highway - Live at Staples Center, Lost Angeles, CA") and the text slides constantly and keeps drawing my attention (i know its also my fault haha).

Could you make the text static, and to only make it slide and show the full title when I hover over the title?

Hope you understood what I meant, I'm a little tipsy haha. Thanks a lot and really appreciate your work!
### Description

Would be great to have a keyboard shortcut for skipping the current track
Again: Thanks a lot for this wunderful project! :).
