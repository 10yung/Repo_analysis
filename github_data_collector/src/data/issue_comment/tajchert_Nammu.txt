AskForSpecialPermission method was removed in 1.4.0 due to memory leaks with Fragment declared anonymously inside. Help in that area is wanted.

How to differentiate between the permission that I am calling is first time or user have selected on the never asked again.
In sample you have mentioned this thing.

`
@OnClick(R.id.buttonLocation)
	public void clickButtLocation()
	{
		if (Nammu.checkPermission(Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION))
		{
			boolean hasAccess = Tools.accessLocation(this);
			Toast.makeText(this, "Access granted fine= " + hasAccess, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
		}
		else
		{
			if (Nammu.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(this,
					Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION))
			{
				//User already refused to give us this permission or removed it
				//Now he/she can mark "never ask again" (sic!)
				Snackbar.make(mLayout, "Here we explain user why we need to know his/her location.",
						Snackbar.LENGTH_INDEFINITE).setAction("OK", new View.OnClickListener()
				{
					@Override
					public void onClick(View view)
					{
						Nammu.askForPermission(MainActivity.this, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION,
								permissionLocationCallback);
					}
				}).show();
			}
			else
			{
				//First time asking for permission
				// or phone doesn't offer permission
				// or user marked "never ask again"
				Nammu.askForPermission(MainActivity.this, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION,
						permissionLocationCallback);
			}
		}
	}

Here in comments you have mentioned 
First time asking permission
or user marked "never ask again."

I want to know when user selected never asked again and proceed further
the command **`gradle install`** will install the arr file into the local maven repo so it can be referred to as a static dependency such as **`compile 'pl.tajchert:nammu:1.0.2'`**

Very nice idea to put all granted permissions into one collection. 

I am just wondering 'when' to check the permissions. Gathering data during `onCreate` in `Application` class results with a fixed collection. My idea would be to check for permissions using `ActvityLifecycleMonitor` after every `onResume` ?
