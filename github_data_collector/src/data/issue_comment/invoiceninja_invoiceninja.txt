As the 'Archive' button is right beside the dropdown arrow for more options, and since it's the same color, it's easy to accidentally click the Archive button and because there is no prompt or confirmation it's even simpler. 

The issue is as one can accidentally archive many selected invoices, it's not easy to unarchive them.

There's no UI field for this. Is there any way to do this currently?
Currently the only way to add to a specific created invoice is to go into the individual entry and via more actions > add to invoice #1234.  It jumps to the invoice. I'll need to save the draft and jump back to the task list and repeat for the rest of the task lines.

If this can be done via the task list view or project's task list, via the select drop down button, it would definitely speed it up. Or even better a checkbox selection and bulk add to the same invoice.
**Problem description:**

When trying to email an invoice, nothing was happening; the draft popup appeared, but hitting 'send' didn't do anything. No errors, nothing in console, nothing in logs, nada.

However, I realized that my logo image file was missing (due to me futzing around in the ftp and mistakenly removing it). "Removing" the missing logo in settings and reuploading then allowed me to email invoices properly.

Best-case scenario would be a more graceful fail, or some sort of alert that the image file is missing!

**Other troubleshooting info**

- Tried to clear site cookies & prefs, but still wouldn't send.
- Win10, Chrome 79.0
- Self-hosted v4.5.17 on Dreamhost

**Steps to reproduce:**

- Delete logo file from ftp manually
- Go to an invoice
- Invoice preview will try to load image and log an error in console
- Press 'email invoice', see popup draft/preview screen.
- Press 'send'
- Nothing happens. No errors in console, nothing on-screen, just... nothing
- Go to settings, delete old (missing) image, reupload a new image
- Back to invoice, 'email invoice', success
The time tracking view becomes quickly too crowded. It would be nice if one can filter the list by a date, a date-range respectively where I would see the following use cases:
- filter by day => user can chose the day  and optionally year
- filter by month => user can choose the month  and optionally year
- filter by quarter => user can choose the quarter and optionally year
- filter by a custom range => user chooses start and end date
The current view can quickly become crowded if many people work on multiple task for the same customer. It would be nice if one can say filter the list so that one only sees the own tracked time
when inviting a new user to the system, it seems like the mail settings isn't used, because mailserver rejects message with we do not relay, but all other emails is working  as they should
Hello!

This PR allows tasks to optionally be linked to products, and passes that information along to the invoice when invoices are created from tasks. It:

1. Adds a new `product_id` field the tasks table.
1. Adds an auto-filling Product field to the task entry screen.
1. When an invoice is created from tasks, sets the correct values for service and rate based on the Product.

I did not open an issue, but I believe this fixes already-existing #2721.
Hi I would love to add variables to the footer or conditions, like {$clientPlace} or {$date:ddmmyy}. (example). I've added it but it doesn't parse.
Is it possible in a way?

Also adding an image would be nice < _img src="signature.jpg" _> would be handy.
**Story:**
I have clients in Europe, but I receive payments in British Pounds. My bank only deals with British Pounds; any payments received are automatically converted by them.

When I create payments in Invoice Ninja, I use the currency converter to record that the payment was converted by my bank.

The amount paid is the same as on the invoice, which is the amount in EUR. The amount after conversion is the amount in my bank account.

**Problem:**
When I type in the amount, Invoice Ninja calculates the exchange rate for that amount. The exchange rate field only allows 4 decimal places. It can't calculate the correct value to reach the same number I just typed in.

The result is that I'll type in a number like "902.09" and Invoice Ninja will change it to "902.07" for me, which does not match the amount that I actually received.

**Proposed solution:**
Increase the exchange rate field to allow 5 decimal places. This will allow every possible value to be represented.
When  creating a line item with a 100% discount it is possible to get a non-zero line total. For example, set quantity to 2.25 and unit cost to $64.22. The resulting line total rounds to $144.50 as expected. However if you add a 100% discount to that line then the line total -$0.01 because the rounding is not done prior to the discount calculation. 

An alternate implementation would be 
*  linetotal = round(qty * unitcost,2)
*  linetotal = linetoal - round(linediscountrate * linetotal)

Would be even nicer if we could define the number of digits for rounding as an invoice setting.
