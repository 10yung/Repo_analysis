Hello,

I was taking a look again on this project and it has no activity for a while, so I would like to know if it is still going to be supported by the team/community yet.

Thank you

When clicking "Pages" I am presented with a screen that lets me search my current pages (of which there are none) and a message stating "Relax, nothing selected yet! Select a page from the menu on the left".

If I hit F5 I get the add page screen "Oh my! You donâ€™t have any pages yet! Let's change that" which I type "Homepage" into and it just reloads with no page being added. The back button also doesn't work here.

The same is true for the templates page.

There is an error in the console referenced by issue [445](https://github.com/relax/relax/issues/442) which could be halting the JS from running any further.
i can't make a blog via content types?

how can i fix this ?
Hi guys i have this error with Mongodb 3.6 when i publish.

I am unable to log into the demo site with un: demo / pw: demo.  It looks like the fonts aren't loading (404 on all .ttf files), which could be related but I suspect not.

After cloning this project and running it, when i  press on any navigation bar button i get this error. Any suggestion?

Looks like removing nucleo icons stylesheet include has broken this.
