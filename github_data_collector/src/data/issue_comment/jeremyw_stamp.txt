Temple seems to provide the compilation and transformations that are needed.
It is also quite quick. Many of the fast erb replacements are using it like slim and hamlit

but it adds a dependency.

if it sounds good, I'll look into this in my copious free time. (wanted to swing back in 2015... darn)

`t = Time.current.stamp('14:00 UTC')` and `t = Time.current.in_time_zone('any time zone').stamp('14:00 UTC')` both return just the time with the string UTC. For some reason UTC is not being parsed correctly and replaced with the actual timezone.
