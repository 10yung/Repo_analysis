- Laravel Version: 6.2
- Laratrust Version: 5.1?

### Description:
It seems that Laratrust "teams" are built around permissions more so than memberships.  Meaning, rather than having separate line items for "user/team", it conflates "role/user/team" and doesn't account for, perhaps, activity in the context of a specific team at a specific point in time.

Are there any plans for "membership-scoped" functionality rather than simply permission-per-team?

In this case it would require an ID/GUID for the actual role entry, and separate join for "membership" (rather than team_id directly).  This may require a bit more "coupling" of team functionality, but I think the ability to retain "membership-related" activity is important.

Hopefully the question makes sense.

### Description:
You said: "If you made changes to your database directly and the changes aren't reflected in your app, please clear your application cache".
After direct change on database, I clear cache app on local app and it worked correctly but I did it on cPanel in the following way:
I wrote in the routes/web.php file the following code and executed it through the browser (myDomain/cache-clear):

`
Route::get('cache-clear', function () {
    \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Artisan::call('cache:clear');
    return back();
});
`

But again the changes did not reflect:

Please help me. Thanks.

Of course, there are 4 empty files in the root of my Laravel project called description, display_name, name and save() that I didn't transfer to the server. Because those were empty.

### Steps To Reproduce:

Just run php artisan --seed

P.S: Please suggestions of "create a new project" isn't a solution, this is being happened many times per day, per week, and suddenly stops happening, and suddenly back.
i have used laratrust roles which are used on multiple tables (2 tables, for example, User and Cross) for auth

I have problems when attaching and syncing

every time I do an attachRole / syncRoles action for example I do in the User Model with id 1 then the Cross Model with id 1 is also attached or synchronized by the same role.

i have used laratrust 5.2
and laravel 6.6.0 version

I have set in config/laratrust.php


'user_models' => [
        'users' => 'App \ User',
        'crosses' => 'App \ Cross'
  ],

### Description:

I would like to be able to add additional metadata to a role assigned to the user, preferably using the `role_user` pivot table. The reason I need this is that a user may have custom data pertaining to that role that another user with the same role may not have.

Initially I had thought about adding a `metadata` column on the `users` table, but the cost of evaluating the data on the column and making sure it doesn't deform was too much in the long run.

Any ideas on how to go about this? I did try adding the column into the migration but it didn't appear in any queries of user roles.

### Description:
Hi, 
This is less of an issue and more of a question; is there any efficient way to list the members of all teams that the current auth user has the role "manager" in.

Ie. user_id 1 is assigned to "Team 1", "Team 2" and "Team 3" as Team Leader (with the permission "list_users" but only assigned as User in "Team 4" and not assigned at all to the rest of the teams so he will see all users that have any role within Team 1/2/3 but noone from Team 4/5/6 etc.

I can do it with raw SQL but i'm new to Laravel and unsure how to do it with eloquent and which would be most efficient.

Thanks

Hey hey,

thanks for your amazing work! I like your package (saw it at jacurtis youtube channel). I am using the teams feature but I run into some problems now. 
I am organizing users of an enterprise within teams. This works well, except that a user can be now within multiple enterprises. I don't really need that. I think, that I misunderstood the teams feature in the beginning of the project. But what I need is the following:
An enterprise with multiple users. Each user is a member, a few chosen ones are administrators of the enterprise. Every user of an enterprise can create projects. They are 'project-admins' now and should be able to add other users to their project, so that they can work together on project related reports. A contributor cannot change project related data, but reports (c, r, u - not d). I don't know, if laratrust can help me out here. Any ideas where to start or what to change?

I can use the teams feature perfectly for the projects - reports permissions, but how can I implement the admin/member stuff within an enterprise? 
The middlewares automatic registering option doesn't as expected with Laravel 6, I had to manually add them to register them.

```Route::middleware(['role:superadmin|developer'])->group(function(){});```

```Illuminate \ Database \ QueryException (HY093)```
```SQLSTATE[HY093]: Invalid parameter number: parameter was not defined (SQL: select "roles".*, "role_user"."user_id" as "pivot_user_id", "role_user"."role_id" as "pivot_role_id", "role_user"."user_type" as "pivot_user_type" from "roles" inner join "role_user" on "roles"."id" = "role_user"."role_id" where "role_user"."user_id" = 1 and "role_user"."user_type" = App\Models\User and "name" = superadmin limit 1)```
I want to contribute to the project translating the docs files to Portuguese. So I created a new folder in the 'doc/5.1' named pt-br and I'm inserting the .md translated files into it. Will it work or you suggest another way?
