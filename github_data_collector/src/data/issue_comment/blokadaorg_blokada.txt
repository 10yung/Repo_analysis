### Steps to reproduce (theoretically)
1. connect to wifi requiring IEEE 802.1X
2. activate blokada
3. try to access the internet


### Expected behaviour
the VPN api should work together with IEEE 802.1X


### Actual behaviour
Internet doesn't work


### Configuration
4.4.4 (android-28 full official arm64-v8a OnePlus-OnePlus5 touch webview compatible)

sometimes the screen gets stuck and looks weird.
Currently they need to be manually committed. fdroid build process needs to be adapted for this to work.

(I was told by Peter to open this here)

I make my own Hosts filter list & wanted to know if I could have it added to the list of filter lists that users get to pick from?
I work hard to keep this list updated & want to share it with as many people as I can so they don't have to do all this work to enjoy ad free Internet & Apps. I also try to respond to any issues with my list as fast as I can & I try to encourage people report any kind of issue with my list.

### Steps to reproduce
1. I´m using the new feature of blocking rules on a main domain level.
2. It would be good to use the feature of a smartlist in parallel, to see what was really tried to access.
3. So idea is to blog e.g. "facebook.com" and to see later in smartlist, which subdomains of facebook.com have been tried to access...


### Expected behaviour
<!-- What would you expect to happen? -->
Generate a list for the "new rules" and activate. Then activate Smartlist-Feature

### Actual behaviour
<!-- What happens instead? -->
When switching on Smartlist Blokada asks to first stop the "new rules"

### Configuration
1. Blokada version
4.4.4

2. Device model
Samsung Note 10 on Android 10 (Nova Launcher)

3. Android version / ROM
Android 10 (Samsung)

### Questions
1. How long have you been using Blokada? 
half a year now

2. How long time ago has the problem started to happen? 
some days ago, but never tried it before

3.  How often does this problem happen to you?
every time I´d like to switch on Smartlist ("New rules" is active)

Blokada ran perfectly fine [since 547 was fixed](https://github.com/blokadaorg/blokada/issues/547) but on some point in the last months (I guess it was December or November) it began being closed every now and then. The notification bar disappears and when I open Blokada it will reestablish the connection again.
It's _not_ the battery optimisation thingy (because I excluded Blokada from battery optimisation).
I don't _think_ that Blokada is killing itself but I guess it's not prohibiting others from killing it. :wink: 

### Steps to reproduce
1. Run Blokada on Samsung S9

### Expected behaviour

Blokada would keep running. :+1: 

### Actual behaviour

Blokada closes. :-1: 

### Configuration
1. :shield: Blokada version: [`4.4.3 (android-28 community release arm64-v8a samsung-starlte touch api compatible)`](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.blokada.alarm/#4.4.3)
2. :iphone: Device model: [`Samsung S9`](https://www.samsung.com/ch/smartphones/galaxy-s9/)
3. :robot: Android version / ROM: `9` / `One UI 1.0` / Kernel `4.9.59-16947752`

### Questions
1. *How long have you been using Blokada?*
Since a long time but I'm still struggling why this is relevant. Maybe you want to add a comment to the issue template that explains how and why this is relevant. This would help to answer this question better, I guess.

2. *How long time ago has the problem started to happen?*
Not too long ago. I would say since two months at maximum. But I didn't had a look on it exactly.

3. *How often does this problem happen to you?*
All the time.

### Settings

Notifications: `No`
Start on boot: `Yes`
Settings location: `Internal Storage`
Background animation: `No`
Keep alive: `Yes`
Watchdog: `Yes`
Aggressive wakeup: `Yes`


**PS:** there were similar issues on Blokada [2.2.2](https://github.com/blokadaorg/blokada/issues/73), [3.6](https://github.com/blokadaorg/blokada/issues/317), 3.7 ([1](https://github.com/blokadaorg/blokada/issues/346), [2](https://github.com/blokadaorg/blokada/issues/379), [3](https://github.com/blokadaorg/blokada/issues/498)), [4.3.4](https://github.com/blokadaorg/blokada/issues/553).
**PPS:** Please note that other applications are staying in background perfectly fine on the same device (i.e. messengers like [Conversations](https://github.com/siacs/Conversations) or [Threema](https://threema.ch/de)).
Blokada has a lot of potential, 
it already have the ability to resolve HOSTS like files, 
I wish it could handle IP-blocking lists, 
for example like ones from <a href="http://iblocklist.com/lists.php">http://iblocklist.com/lists.php</a>.

Here is an example for a list content: 
<pre>

It is essentially a range of IPs to block, 
if you'll implement it into Blokada, 
it will one of the most powerful security programs currently available in the market. 
Sometimes the VPN connection breaks and then Blokada enters a connect -> fail -> connect loop which can last for minutes before a new succesful connection is created. From the logfiles this happens over and over again:

### Steps to reproduce
There doesn't seem to be a distinct pattern, but I've been able to trigger it sometimes when turning off Wi-Fi and then turning on mobile data, or vice versa.

### Expected behaviour
Tunnel establishes as normal.

### Actual behaviour
Attempts to create tunnel, fails, tries again, fails, ...

For a better user experience, it worth to pre-check a few things before the ad blocking service starts up. 
Ideas:
1.) Check if [Data Saver is off](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/data-saver) (it can prevent ad blocking on mobile internet).
2.) Check if VPN API is free to use or another app uses it
3.) If the provider is Google Fi, it provides [VPN by default](https://www.reddit.com/r/blokada/comments/e6inp5/on_google_fi_blokada_keeps_turning_itself_off/)
