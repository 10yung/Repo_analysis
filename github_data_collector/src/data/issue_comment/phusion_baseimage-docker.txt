My docker file:

`
FROM phusion/baseimage:0.11

COPY limits.conf /etc/security/limits.conf
COPY sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.conf
`

The /etc/sysctl.conf is worked, but /etc/security/limits.conf is not valid.



Hi, 
Activity on this project is pretty rare, the target of `baseimage-docker` really resonated with me. 

Is there a maintained alternative?

I'm trying to set a timeout for a container following this hack `docker stop -t 15 $(docker run -d --stop-signal 2 --rm phusion/baseimage-docker) ` but as `docker stop` sends a `SIGTERM` first, my container is instantly stopped, as if `--stop-signal 2` wasn't considered by my_init.

So I have 2 questions:
+ Is my_init compatible with `--stop-signal` option
+ Should I use another approach like `timeout XX docker run -d --rm phusion/baseimage-docker` (I tried it with SIGKILL/SIGTERM/SIGINT without success), and can my_init handle this?

Thanks a lot for your work, it provides a really smooth path deeper into docker usage

PS: I followed this thread before thinking you could be interested by this question https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/1905 
PS2: I expected to use a timeout for this kind of usage https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker/#login_docker_exec.
PS3: Here is my usage of your image https://github.com/jclaveau/php-library-development-toolkit/blob/master/php#L42-L70
Hi contributors to baseimage-docker! Thanks for working on this repo!

I wanted to share with you an issue I hit tonight. I use bazel to pull images from hub.docker.com . I was looking to pull https://hub.docker.com/r/phusion/baseimage , tag 0.9.22 or tag latest. However, I was getting this issue:

```
2019/11/12 00:05:10 Image pull was unsuccessful: reading image "index.docker.io/phusion/baseimage:0.9.22": unsupported MediaType: "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v1+prettyjws", see https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/issues/377
```

It seems like Bazel won't support pulling schema 1 images. I don't know much about schema 1 or schema 2 version manifest images. I was wondering if baseimage-docker was considering updating to schema 2 version manifest images?

In the meantime, I'll try an alternative. Maybe I'll pull manually or I'll use another base image.
I have noticed that exposed ports are reachable only from localhost.
In spite of the fact the the hosting systems itself shows that the container is listening againts 0.0.0.0.

in the previous dockerfile if I use phusion/baseimage:master, the port 22 is reachable only from localhost.
I am proposing we change the version scheme for the tagging of `baseimage-docker` container images to match the version of LTS Ubuntu which it is built from and attach our semantic version. 

Here is one idea:

- phusion/baseimage-docker:18.04-1.0.0

Any additional feedback is welcomed! I would like to solidify this before we cut the next release.
The error is listed below, the problem arise since recently, before that there was no problem building images.

The step is

RUN apt upgrade -y 

`Configuration file '/etc/cron.weekly/fstrim'
 ==> Deleted (by you or by a script) since installation.
 ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** fstrim (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? dpkg: error processing package util-linux (--configure):
 end of file on stdin at conffile prompt
Errors were encountered while processing:
 util-linux
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)`
I should do the following while I want open bbr support in ubuntu 18:

echo "net.core.default_qdisc=fq" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo "net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sysctl -p

I do this success in host machine, but in baseimage, I got error:
sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control
sysctl: cannot stat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_available_congestion_control: No such file or directory
## System info

* OS: **Arch Linux**
* Arch: **x86_64**
* Docker version: **19.03.2-ce, build 6a30dfca03**
* Affected `phusion/baseimage` tags: **0.10.0 and newer**


## Steps to reproduce

Try to start a `phusion/baseimage` container with the following command:
```
docker run --rm -t -i phusion/baseimage /sbin/my_init -- bash -l
```

## Actual behaviour

Here's the output:
```

*** Running /etc/my_init.d/10_syslog-ng.init...

(... after some seconds ...)

```

## Additional info

I've managed to start a `phusion/baseimage` conteiner for tag 0.9.22. Although it starts the container, it keeps showing the error message above in a loop.
It would be great if latest non LTS versions of Ubuntu (19.04 and 19.10 currently) are support.
