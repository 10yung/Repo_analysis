Getting a ridiculous number of notifications for each and every incoming text. Every time I dismiss one, another for the same text pops up. Number of times is random. Up to ten for the last two texts. Sometimes as few as four. Happens whether YakYak is open or not. Also YakYak has never opened when the notifications are clicked.
Available in Menu->View->Show image preview .
It is possible to toggle the image preview with
CTRL+P keyboard combination.

This feature tries to cover [this request](https://github.com/yakyak/yakyak/issues/620) .
Seems like the last release dates of Nov 8, 2018. What is the status on this project? PR's are pilling up. Is this project dead?
Yakyak never shows the status of users correctly. The offline users are displayed online and online users are displayed offline.

YakYak v1.5.3 (latest)

The Chrome Hangouts Extension has the feature where you can switch Tabs of conversation with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+ <kbd>Tab</kbd>.

It would be amazing if this could be implemented in YakYak.

Hi,
notification popups appear, but I can't find any notification in Gnome notification area.
Thus, if I'm away I won't come to know having a new message.

`--> lsb_release -a      
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Debian
Description:	Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
Release:	10
Codename:	buster`

Gnome 3.30
Yakyak 1.5.4
Related to issues https://github.com/yakyak/yakyak/issues/1069 which was closed due to inactivity.

I'm having the same issue. I'm running on Windows 10 x64.

I tried direct running of the executable from the 1.5.3, 1.5.2, 1.5.1, and 1.5.4Beta releases. I also did a clean build of 1.5.3 from source and a checkout from master branch.

All of them would stay stuck at connecting after authorizing my Google login. Nothing is printed in the Inspection Tool console or the Windows command line that indicates an error has occurred. I am behind an enterprise firewall and have their http proxy configured. It looks like the proxy is correctly resolved by YakYak. There are no security events on my google account.

Here is the output when running YakYak.exe:

As the description says: The emoji "Smiling face with three hearts" is missing from the Mac client. It seems to show up correctly on the PC version though. The visibility of the emoji is unchanged whether sending or receiving
