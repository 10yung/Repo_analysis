Bumps [bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) from 4.1.1 to 4.3.1.
<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [bootstrap's releases](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases).*

> ## v4.3.1
> * **Security:** Fixed an XSS vulnerability (CVE-2019-8331) in our tooltip and popover plugins by implementing a new HTML sanitizer
> * Fixed a small issue with our RFS (responsive font sizes) mixins
> 
> ## v4.3.0
> ### Highlights
> 
> - **New:** Added `.stretched-link` utility to make any anchor the size of it's nearest `position: relative` parent, perfect for entirely clickable cards!
> - **New:** Added `.text-break` utility for applying `word-break: break-word`
> - **New:** Added `.rounded-sm` and `.rounded-lg` for small and large `border-radius`.
> - **New:** Added `.modal-dialog-scrollable` modifier class for scrolling content _within_ a modal.
> - **New:** Added responsive `.list-group-horizontal` modifier classes for displaying list groups as a horizontal row.
> - **Improved:** Reduced our compiled CSS by using `null` for variables that by default inherit their values from other elements (e.g., `$headings-color` was `inherit` and is now `null` until you modifier it in your custom CSS).
> - **Improved:** Badge focus styles now match their `background-color` like our buttons.
> - **Fixed:** Silenced bad selectors in our JS plugins for the `href` HTML attribute to avoid JavaScript errors. Please try to use [valid selectors](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-identifier) or the `data-target` HTML attribute/`target` option where available.
> - **Fixed:** Reverted v4.2.1's change to the breakpoint and grid container Sass maps that blocked folks from upgrading when modifying those default variables.
> - **Fixed:** Restored `white-space: nowrap` to `.dropdown-toggle` (before v4.2.1 it was on all `.btn`s) so carets don't wrap to new lines.
> - **Deprecated:** `img-retina`, `invisible`, `float`, and `size` mixins are now deprecated and will be removed in v5.
> 
> ### Links
> - [Read the full ship list](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/27893)
> - [Review the project board](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/16)
> 
> ## v4.2.1
> Bump to v4.2.1 to republish package on npm. [See v4.2.0 release notes](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v4.2.0) for changes introduced in v4.2.
> 
> ## v4.2.0
> Here are the highlights of what's new and updated in v4.2.
> 
> - **New:** Added a new spinner loading component.
> - **New:** Added new toast component for displaying notifications.
> - **New:** Added a new iOS style switch (a modifier class to our custom checkboxes).
> - **New:** Added touch support in our carousel component.
> - **New:** Added `.font-weight-lighter` and `.font-weight-bolder` utilities.
> - **New:** Added `.text-decoration-none` utility class.
> - **New:** Added `.modal-xl` modifier class for our modals.
> - **New:** Added new negative margin utility classes (e.g., `.mb-n3`). These rad new classes not only allow you more control over your general spacing needs, but also allow you to create responsive grid gutters at each breakpoint.
> - **New:** Validated form fields now have feedback icons on `:invalid` and `:valid` fields. Disable them with the `$enable-validation-icons` boolean Sass variable (defaults to `true`).
> - **New:** Added a new versions page to our docs
> - **New:** Tooltips/Popovers work with Shadow DOM
> - **Updated:** Redesigned the custom checkboxes and radios for more obvious states.
> - **Updated:** `bootstrap-grid.css` now includes our `margin` and `padding` utilities for full control of our grid system.
> - **Updated:** Changed auto columns (e.g., `.col-auto`) from `max-width: none` to `max-width: 100%` to prevent content from causing a column to overflow the parent.
> - **Updated:** Improved rendering of custom selects, ranges, file input, and more.
> 
> Checkout the full [v4.2.0 ship list](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/26952) and [GitHub project](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/6) for the full details. Up next is [v4.3](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/16) with some bugfixes, a few new modifier classes and variables, and some new utilities.
