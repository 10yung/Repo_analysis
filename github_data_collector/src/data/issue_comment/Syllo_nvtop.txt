apt-get install nvtop

The following NEW packages will be installed:
  libnvidia-compute-418 libnvidia-compute-430 ...

The following packages will be REMOVED:
  libnvidia-compute-435 ...

Can nvtop be updated to use the current driver?  Thanks.
Dear Maxime,

Please consider this PR as a small improvement over this great tool. It fixes consistency throughout all units displayed (they're all now multiples of 1024 bytes). Also available/total RAM is displayed with 3 decimal digits.

Thank you.

After I upgraded the Nvidia driver to 440, I can no longer use nvtop and can't install it.
Is there any solution other than downgrading the driver？

I've found option to select or ignore some GPUs, but the bar-plot still draws two main GPUs charts on one plot.

I've 3 GPUs - 1 710 (device 0) to connect to monitor and draw X-server and two more 1080ti (devices 1 and 2) for DS calculation. 
With default "htop" run - we have two plots - one for both 1080ti on one chart and one for not needed 710.
When i run "htop -i 0" it selects right GPUs but still draws only one plot with both 1080ti on it.

Is it possible to have two separate graphs for GPU 1 and GPU 2?

Thanks!

Under the lastest Jetpack version 4.2.1 for embedded devices like Xavier or TX2 I'm seeing this issue when trying to cmake:
```
cmake .. -DNVML_RETRIEVE_HEADER_ONLINE=True
```
I get the error:

It seems it finds NVML and doesn't find it in the download part where you look for:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-settings/master/src/nvml.h
```
Any insight is appreciated!
Hi guys, thanks for awesome tool.
Could you give an example how to wrap nvtop in docker?

Unfortunately this one:
```
FROM nvidia/cuda

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y cmake libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev git && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* && \
    rm -rf /work/*


RUN ln -s /usr/local/cuda-10.1/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/stubs/libnvidia-ml.so /usr/local/lib/libnvidia-ml.so && \
    ln -s /usr/local/cuda-10.1/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/stubs/libnvidia-ml.so /usr/local/lib/libnvidia-ml.so.1



RUN cd /tmp && \
    git clone https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop.git && \
    mkdir -p nvtop/build && cd nvtop/build && \
    cmake .. && \
    make && \
    make install && \
    cd / && \
    rm -r /tmp/nvtop


CMD ["/usr/local/bin/nvtop"]
```
Results in:
```

When I try to run with:

>  docker run --runtime=nvidia  nvtop

Any ideas? 
Would it be in the scope of the project to have nvtop run as a daemon and have a collector to serve nvidia metrics that Prometheus can consume?

I am imagining a flag `nvtop --daemon --metrics --metrics-port 8000` or something, that would be useful to get the information into Grafana :)

Thanks
Would it still be possible to have the consumed watts drawn in the diagram?
Thank you

I installed it on AWS without any problem. When I try installing it on server with docker I am using, I got that error.
