A quite silly problem that takes me nearly one hour. I found all the worker for phear.js is crashed. The reason is I didn't put phantomjs in path, which is not mentioned in its download page and I assume phear.js can find it... Hope it can save time for other users.
Hello there,

I tried to install @ Windows ,but failed , ofcourse I dont have memcached ,butI do have bitnami stack which I can install through : https://bitnami.com/stack/memcached

Anyway I am not interested in caching now,so
1- I have Node js installed
2- I have phantom js last version
3- No Memcached yet
4- Followed this code : 

```
git clone https://github.com/Tomtomgo/phearjs.git
cd phearjs
npm install
```
The installation create error and debug log is attached.

[npm-debug.txt](https://github.com/Tomtomgo/phearjs/files/687400/npm-debug.txt)

Now starting the service with : node phearjs , getting this error

```
module.js:471
    throw err;
    ^

Error: Cannot find module 'C:\Bitnami\phearjs\phearjs'
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:469:15)

```
Might be a nice addition to have the option to return images generated by phantomjs as Base64
phearjs is effectively incompatible with Windows because of the memcache dependency. It may be desirable to have a config flag that removes the memcached dependency when running phearjs for Windows users who want the scraping features without caching capabilities.

P.S I can attempt to make a PR for this but it might take 1-2 weeks to find a good time for it. Let me know if I should.
