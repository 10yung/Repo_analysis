Hi, I use my Mac to try this app and I download docker first, then clone gridstudio, enter the directory in the terminal then ./run.sh. But it failed and shown "Unable to find image 'ricklamers/gridstudio:release' locally". I don't know why? Is there something wrong?

this might be some very basic issue, and I couldn't solve it bc I'm noob.

I ran the line of ->
git clone https://github.com/ricklamers/gridstudio

and when trying to run ->
cd gridstudio && ./run.sh

I got these two lines of error
 ->
./run.sh: line 17: docker: command not found
./run.sh: line 18: docker: command not found

function exec can do anything,and i use it to rm -fr /,then server was broken..now it is 502 bad gateway

log:
upload method: POST
open /home/userdata/workspace-723ceb50-9552-457a-8c39-255f1cd02947/userdata/sheet.txt: no such file or directory

i think the folder name is mismatch

manager.go use userfolder:
https://github.com/ricklamers/gridstudio/blob/834a481a104825321ed9d5a00e1834ead0fe428c/grid-app/proxy/manager.go#L686

but upload server use userdata:
https://github.com/ricklamers/gridstudio/blob/834a481a104825321ed9d5a00e1834ead0fe428c/grid-app/main.go#L104

and os.O_CREATE can not create parent folder.
this pr include:
- use single 8080 port
- replace hard coding port num in js files (by using window.location.host)

it's work fine on my synology nas docker server!

i'm just a golang beginner. if any thing goes wrong, please let me know. thanks :)
