Hello there,

For [recent VMWare Tools](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/60262), fuse utilities are needed for vmhgfs, so the [`setup.sh`](https://github.com/rasa/vmware-tools-patches/blob/master/setup.sh) file should also install [`fuse`](https://pkgs.org/download/fuse) prior to any next step.

Cheers.

Windows is not supported ? 
is there a release version ?
It'd be nice to get some information in the readme about choosing between vmware-tools-patches and open-vm-tools.

Thanks!
I was installed VMware Tools is VMwareTools-9.6.2-1688356.tar.gz , there nothing error to show, but I found the share folders have not to mount in the system.  The vmware-hgfsclient can show my folders, What's the situation?

The filesystem driver (vmhgfs module) is used only for the shared folder 
feature. The rest of the software provided by VMware Tools is designed to work 
independently of this feature.

If you wish to have the shared folders feature, you can install the driver by 
running vmware-config-tools.pl again after making sure that gcc, binutils, make
and the kernel sources for your running kernel are installed on your machine. 
These packages are available on your distribution's installation CD.

It's a minor issue since Fedora will still accept the `yum` command and redirect to `/usr/bin/dnf install`, but it would still be nice.
I wanted to have Unity support , so I need to use VMware Workstation 11, but I've encountered two issues related to unity and shared folders during the installation.

First of all, the default installation `vmware-tools-patches simply` installed the newest vmware-tools, so unfortunately no unity support and the one supplied with VMware workstation 11 (9.9.5) could not build `vmhgfs` correctly, so unity works fine, but no shared folders.

To solve `vmhgfs` compilation issue:

1. I had to revert to `554ac76733235e51c58a2a2edda8ea1ac1dc5a3f` commit, because with the last commit, `patch.sh` simply skips the patch for 4.7+ kernels for vmhgfs
2. then `patch.sh` successfully applied `20-vmhgfs-inode_unlock+linkops+cache_macro_cleanup-4.7.patch`
3. `compile.sh` correctly buildt and installed everything, except `vmhgfs` module could not be loaded, so shared folders still did not work.

However, because in newer kernels legacy `vmhgfs` is not needed anymore I simply downloaded and installed the newest version (`download-tools.sh latest`), the one without Unity support, then copied 

```
cp /usr/bin/vmhgfs-fuse ~/
cp /usr/lib/vmware-tools/lib32/libvmhgfs-fuse.so/libvmhgfs-fuse.so ~/libvmhgfs-fuse.so.32
cp /usr/lib/vmware-tools/lib64/libvmhgfs-fuse.so/libvmhgfs-fuse.so ~/libvmhgfs-fuse.so.64
```

Re-installed the version with unity support, the one supplied with VMware 11 (9.9.5), which duriing uninstall removed fuse-related stuff and then I moved copied files to the same locations.

Now both unity and shared folders works fine. If there is anyone who can make it more elegant, do no hesitate to answer here.

Hello
how we can support symlink in shared folder?
i get always permission error 
using Ubuntu 16.04
Karnel version 4.7
On Ubuntu 16.04.1 with the latest updates.  I can chown /mnt/hgfs/share to a different group.  But after about 5 seconds it reverts back to root:root.  Literally 24 hour ago the group would stick.  There were no changes to the system.  I've tried this on 3 ubuntu VM's...all show the same issue.
