When there are large number of items, it takes too much time to show the view. Is there anything that can be done to improve this? Currently it takes about 9 seconds to present the list with 200 items.
Currently it will make the whole view blur. How to change only Content View background colour?
Hello!

The separator color does not seem to change with the following code:

`actionSheet.separatorColor = UIColor(red: 30, green: 30, blue: 30, alpha: 0.2)`

Anyone got this working on iOS 10?


Hello!
This project is amazing, very customizable! I have a question about rotation.
When the device is rotated the UIActionSheet does not update. There is a way, is it a bug or a feature not yet implemented?
Thanks

Support Presenting AcitonSheet directly through UIViewController and add precompile preprocessors to avoid compilation errors for App Extensions targets.

AHKActionSheet breaks the build if it is used in an App Extension, all errors due to [UIApplication sharedApplication]
