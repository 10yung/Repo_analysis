你好：
一直在使用这个库，挺好用的。
您可以把它委托给愿意维护的人的继续维护，至少我就是一个。
希望能继续更新，期待～
Line 857 of iRate.m currently contains this code:

    UIViewController *topController = [UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate.window.rootViewController;

However, the `window` property of the `UIApplicationDelegate` is declared as optional. Thus, the above code leads to a crash when my application delegate does not implement the `window` method.

I suggest checking for existence of that method via `-respondsToSelector:` first and using `[UIApplication sharedApplication].keyWindow` otherwise.
Under iOS 11 GM in an app built with Xcode 8.3.3 (and currently in the app store) I'm seeing first launch of the day produce the prompt. I've seen this occur twice now.

Additionally, when this occurs, the Submit button does nothing. The cancel and Not Now buttons work, however.

In our `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` we configure as follows:

```
    //configure iRate
    [iRate sharedInstance].daysUntilPrompt = 0;
    [iRate sharedInstance].usesUntilPrompt = 0;
    [iRate sharedInstance].remindPeriod = 0;
    [iRate sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch = NO;
```

That is the only iRate code at app startup. Later in the lifecycle we explicitly call

```
    if ([[iRate sharedInstance] shouldPromptForRating]) {
        [[iRate sharedInstance] promptForRating];
    }
```
I have added code in `AppDelegate` and added `iRateDelegate` also


**func iRateUserDidAttemptToRateApp() {
	Analytics.track(event: .UserRatingNow)
}**


**func iRateUserDidDeclineToRateApp() {
	Analytics.track(event: .UserDeclinedToRateApp)
}**


But these 2 delegates are not getting called
I have added code in didFinishLaunch 

iRate.sharedInstance().messageTitle = "TITLE TEST"
iRate.sharedInstance().message = "TEST MESSAGE"

Its showing still its default message

**UPDATE**
iRate.sharedInstance().messageTitle = NSLocalizedString("Rate MyApp", comment: "TITLE TEST")
iRate.sharedInstance().message = NSLocalizedString("If you like MyApp, please take the time, etc", comment: "TITLE MESSAGE")

Stil Not working

@nicklockwood : Please Help
It appears as if ratedThisVersion is not set when requesting reviews with SKStoreReviewController? If I'm reading things correctly, the rate method is never called.

This would mean that once the other thresholds are crossed for requesting a rating, we will continually prompt for a rating if using SKStoreReviewController.

Or I'm misunderstanding something :)
How can i make it show on . the basis user posted/submitted any review earlier or not.
Hi        
setting paramters,iRate alert not show.Why?

iRate.sharedInstance().delegate = self
iRate.sharedInstance().applicationBundleID = Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier
iRate.sharedInstance().useAllAvailableLanguages = true
iRate.sharedInstance().promptForNewVersionIfUserRated = false
iRate.sharedInstance().usesUntilPrompt = 2
iRate.sharedInstance().daysUntilPrompt = 2.0
iRate.sharedInstance().remindPeriod = 3.0
iRate.sharedInstance().verboseLogging = false
iRate.sharedInstance().declinedThisVersion = false

 
Hello,
I have an app that always requires login.
After login, I call promptIfAllCriteriaMet.
My question is, what should I call exactly  after logout to reset iRate totally? (So, the next user will have the same experience than the first one)
Thanks.
