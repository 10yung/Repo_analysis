**Describe your feature request**:

It's a bit weird that you can view the IP address at the Information tab but need to go to Configure tab to renew the IP. And after you've done that, you need to go back to Information to see the current values.

I would personally even opt for merging these tabs entirely.
1) Add option to do DNS look up to show name as well as IP address for the Remote IP Address, in a separate column

This will make tool so much more useful in a big network as can quickly see devices connected by name rather than then having to look up the IP myself each time

Hopefully as DNS look up integrated in lots of other places this won't be too add?

2) Show process ID and process name for each connection (where relevant)

Basically in same way as 'netstat -abo' does e.g. example output below

Add some templates for ports/ranges/common ports:

Webserver: 22; 80; 443; 8080 etc.
Windows: 
Mail: 
etc.
Currently the ip scanner only uses icmp (ping).

Hi

Getting odd results from Port Scanner, scanning my whole network of 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254 for ports 1-80 as a test and getting odd results.

Basically it is showing ports like 25 being open for IP addresses which don't even exist on my network (home)

See screenshots showing some of the results for one address, and also showing my connected devices on my router where that address is not used, and I can't ping it either

So why is it finding open ports for something which doesn't even exist??

Any thoughts or tests I can do please?
