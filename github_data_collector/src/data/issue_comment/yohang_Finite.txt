PHP Deprecated:  Calling the "Symfony/Component/EventDispatcher/EventDispatcherInterface::dispatch()" method with the event name as the first argument is deprecated since Symfony 4.3, pass it as the second argument and provide the event object as the first argument instead. in /vendor/symfony/event-dispatcher/EventDispatcher.php on line 58
Hey,

I get the following error when I try the code provided by the Read Me:


```
Warning: 
require_once(/Users/creadisc/GIT/test/Psr/EventDispatcher/EventDispatcherInterface.php):
failed to open stream:
No such file or directory in /Users/creadisc/GIT/test/index.php on line 6

Fatal error: require_once():
Failed opening required 
'/Users/creadisc/GIT/test/Psr/EventDispatcher/EventDispatcherInterface.php' 
(include_path='.:/usr/local/Cellar/php@7.2/7.2.20/share/php@7.2/pear') in 
/Users/creadisc/GIT/test/index.php on line 6
```
This error occurs as soon as I instantiate a StateMachine object.
When I check the /vendor folder I cannot find any element named Psr/EventDispatcher/EventDispatcherInterface.php. There are EventDispatcherInterface files related to Symphony but they reside in a different folder structure.
Btw: I'm on MacOS

Is this a bug? How can I fix this?

Thanks in advance
Adrian
PHPUnit 4 already Support ended,  update  PHPUnit to 8 can be better. And we can Support PHP7
below，there is `'from' => '-proposed'` and  `'from' => 'proposed'`. 

what is the difference ? 

```php
    'callbacks' => array(
        'before' => array(
            array(
                'from' => '-proposed',
                'do' => function(Finite\StatefulInterface $document, \Finite\Event\TransitionEvent $e) {
                    echo 'Applying transition '.$e->getTransition()->getName(), "\n";
                }
            ),
            array(
                'from' => 'proposed',
                'do' => function() {
                    echo 'Applying transition from proposed state', "\n";
                }
            )
        ),
        'after' => array(
            array(
                'to' => array('accepted'), 'do' => array($document, 'display')
            )
        )
    )
```
**On php 7.2 there is a warning:**
Warning:  get_class() expects parameter 1 to be object, null given

**get_class ([ object $object ] ) : string**
Php 7.2.0 | NULL was removed as the default value for object, and is no longer a valid input.

I have a specific case where numbers (integers) are used as state names.

For some reason creating the state machine even with integers as strings, like "0" or "10", will make getName()/__toString() fail because it does not return a string.
