I'm loving the app so far, so thank you to everyone who has contributed to its success! 

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't see any visualizations that track whether you have completed all of your habits for a particular day. For example, this photo shows how Productive has a calendar view with green circles filled in to show full completion, along with some aggregate stats: https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Productive-Habit-1.jpeg

I apologize if there is an issue for this already -- I scanned the existing issues and did a search for previous issues, but I didn't see this idea specifically. This was the closest relevant issue I could find: https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits/issues/521

I've never worked on an Android app before, but I'd be happy to learn and help build this into your app if you think it's a good idea and feasible. I'd also be willing to work closely with a designer to figure out the UI/UX and pair program with an Android developer to build it out.
Spaced repetition learning is based on the idea that the forgetting curve is exponential. To reinforce long term memory formation or habit forming a review repetition of increasing intervals is proven helpful. Spaced repetition intervals seem to vary as I read from different papers, but all are somewhat similar to that of the Fibonacci sequence.

A custom repeat in Fib seq would be as follows:
0 = initialization
1 = 8 hr (hours from initialization)
1 = 24 hr
3 = 72 hr
5 = 120 hr
8 = 192 hr
13 = 312 hr 
21 = 504 hr
34 = 816 hr (approximately 1 month)

Thank you to the developers of this great project. It's so useful for me.
I looked at the screenshots of the IOS close of this app mentioned in the issue https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits/issues/548 and there was one thing that caught my eye that we could use in Loop as well that could improve the usability.

I'm talking about the big tiles in the history (see attached screenshot). My suggestion is to increase the size of the tiles of the calendar card in a similar fashion. With that change in place we could also think about the possibility of making the execution dates editable from within the habit itself.

I think it would be great to enable the user to sort the widgets in the habit details view. That would make problems like the following obsolete:

1. I think the best place to show it is as a new card in the ShowHabitActivity, either directly below the current SubtitleCard, or after the OverviewCard. (Originally posted by @iSoron in https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits/pull/547#issuecomment-572012252_)

It would also enable the user to sort the information according to his preferences. For some the calendar is more important than the Score graph. Some others might want to see the Best streaks or the history immediately.

**Changes**

* added ```question``` column to ```Habit``` table. This is a nullable text column, similar to description.
* added migration from db 22 -> 23. What this does is copy our old "description" to the question column and set the description column to null.
* Refactor ```edit_habit_name``` layout to a constraint layout (added dependency). Related to this is updating ```NameDescriptionPanel``` (the view class that uses ```edit_habit_name```) to include the notes input.
* I think most everything else is just updating code across the app to refer to the ```question``` field instead of ```description```

**Follow up questions/comments for @iSoron** : 

1. where/how do you actually want this new field to be shown? :)
2. Right now importing from various importers takes their "description" field and puts it into uhabits "question" field since I just replaced the name. Maybe that doesn't make sense anymore and it should go into the new notes/description field?
2. I ignored one test. It's failing when trying migrate 21 to 22 because of the ```findAll``` method. I think the method ```findAll``` should be refactored. The reason the test is failing is because ```findAll``` queries all columns on the ```HabitRecord``` class even though version 22 didn't have that column. Maybe I'm over thinking things here. Let me know if that makes sense. The failure reported by the unit test shouldn't actually happen in prod.
I might be wrong, but I recall that notifications when in large number (3+?) were combined together in the top bar in Android 10 and were visible as one icon there.  When swiped down I had to expand the Habits category to see them all (which was much better than 8+ notification at 11 pm to scroll).

However, it no longer happens after an upgrade to 1.8/1.8.5/1.8.6. There is one other icon at the first place, 3 habits icons next and a small dot (informing that there is no many icons to be displayed). I wonder if it could be related to https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits/commit/58ed7592241d3bad87b3b70517147807052056bc#diff-fac3426849f74e19413fdcc13a8e54baL129-R127 and if it can be brought back by some settings changes (I haven't found any).
Having the dark theme enabled I was surprised to open the settings page and be glared by the while background there. It's not a big issue, but it the back theme could be used consistently.

1.8.5 on Android 10.
Phone: Samsung Galaxy S9 Android 10 Beta 
App Version: 1.8


Scenario: two or more notifications present, click the "Yes" option and notice all notifications are dismissed at once. The habit that I clicked "Yes" on goes through but the rest are not marked.


What should happen: only the notification that I click "Yes" or "No" should disappear. 
when I try to create a new habit it's name changes to a random habit I already created .
this mostly happens when I try to rearrange my new habit.
hi,
first - thank you for this great app.
I noticed that i still get reminders for archived habits - is this normal?
Thank you.
