What about adding the possibility to let users upload photos that its size is bigger than the max allowed size of attachment by auto-resizing it?, if it possible. 

For example: Max size of attached files is 2 mb but we need resizing any photo that bigger than allowable limit to provide storage space for the server.

Hi,

i use the Rocket.Chat app on the current iPad Pro and found that the app consumes 5.4 GB of disk space. We use Rocket.Chat excessively in our company. I suspect that the high storage space consumption is due to sent pictures and documents, which are also on the Rocket.Chat server.

Is it possible to delete the cache and data from the app?

Thanks for your help.

Hello.
I dragged all your files into my project.
Almost everything works, but incoming messages are not displayed.
The NSLog shows that incoming messages are coming.
I’ve already dug everything up, and I don’t know what else to watch.
Please help me, what I could not correctly transfer from your project?

Make sure your server supports WebSocket. These are the minimum requirements for Apache 2.4 and Nginx 1.3 or greater.

Since the new update, some of our users have been complaining of being unable to login to our rocketchat server on iOS. They are capable of getting in on PC and through Safari on their phones, but the app produces the following error:

```
Error loading page

Domain: NSURLErrorDomain
Error Code: -1200
Description: An SSL error has occurred and secure connection to the server cannot be made.
```

We authenticate to our private rocketchat server using Keycloak SSO with two providers: GitHub, and our internal enterprise user accounts, which communicates with Keycloak using SiteMinder. GitHub works fine, but if they're using their internal user account, we get the error above. It worked fine before the update to app version 4.1.0. 

Has anyone else had a problem like this?

I was wondering if I could make a custom build of the app to only connect to my instance of rocket.chat.
Thanks!

Hi,
Whenever I try to connect I get "Oops! - Could not connect to this server!".
I have a valid cert (https://msgz.xyz/) and I have nginx setup as a reverse proxy.
I'm entering 'msgz.xyz' but i've also tried with http and https prefix.

```
:~$ curl -i -N -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" -H "Host: msgz.xyz" -H "Origin: msgz.xyz" -H "Sec-WebSocket-Key: blahblah" -H "Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13" https://msgz.xyz/websocket
HTTP/2 400
server: nginx/1.14.0 (Ubuntu)
date: Fri, 06 Dec 2019 12:38:43 GMT

Not a valid websocket request
```


Websockets seem to work, any ideas?
