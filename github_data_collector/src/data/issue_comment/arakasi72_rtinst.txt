Hi,

This is not an issue more of a request if possible.

I was wondering if it is possible to change from a basic auth popup login to rutorrent to a form based login.

Thanks.
Hello

I have install PHP 7.4, it's work perfectly, so you can maybe migrate the script to PHP 7.4 =)
I installed rtinst Master on Kimsufi KS-3 | Intel  Atom N2800.
OS Debian 9.4 Stretch (stable) (64bits)
 
Everything is ok except this**
**"autodl-irssi: Plugin will not work. PHP extension must be installed (xml)."**

Please tell me how to fix this?

Whenever I stop rtorrent it restarts itself. I've tried using, 'rt stop' and sigterm the process in htop. After a few minutes rtorrent restarts itself. How can I shut off rtorrent?
[17.12.2019 01:59:12] WebUI started.
[17.12.2019 01:59:12] No connection to rTorrent. Check if it is really running. Check $scgi_port and $scgi_host settings in config.php and scgi_port in rTorrent configuration file.

I rt restart and reboot my raspberrypi for more than a weeks. Before this, it always works fine. Then, I add 2 torrents and it said 502 Bad Gateway and after my reboot, it is always crashing.

When I start rtorrent from ssh it says:

After rt restart, I check with the "rt" command and rtorrent will be running for about 5 minutes and it turns to NOT Running.

I am not good at linux so much, just copy code to my box for personal use.

Thanks for your help,
I have set up some remote seedox to upload content to rtinst seedbox.

But the FTP connection gives error - could not upload to ftp error : Could not log in. Reason 530 Non-anonymous sessions must use encryption.

What should I do? 
For the last week ruTorrent has started having issues communicating with rTorrent, although I don't know if the problem is with rTorrent or ruTorrent. Existing torrents are seeding fine but no plugins work, so autotools which I use to automate my torrent grabbing isn't working. If I reboot my server or restart rTorrent everything seems to start working fine again and autotools grabs the torrents but if I check back an hour or so later then I have the below errors 

```

```

I also found the below errors in the tmp/rutorrent_errors.log

Could they be related to the issues I'm having? I'm not quite sure what they are telling me but it appears to relate to user settings

Any idea what the problem might be?

Ubuntu version: 18.10
rtinst version 1.8.6
ruTorrent version 3.9
rTorrent version 0.9.8
Hi arakasi. Love your script and it's been working great for nearly a year. 
After last packages update and server reboot rtorrent never could start again until I've changed scgi port to different than ruTorrent user settings. If I do that rtorrent starts and seeding but haven't got connection to ruTorrent. Once I'll bring back scgi port to proper rtorrent is crashing. 
Tried add another user then another one and it's all same rtorrent crashing on them if scgi port is same in .rtorrent.rc and user config.php in var/www.
Even deleted var/www folder and rerun rtinst script in hope it will solve the problem but unfortunately it's same. I'm out of ideas now. Appreciate any help! 
I was expecting that rutupgrade would upgrade the installed version to v3.9, but it upgraded to v3.10-beta instead. It's probably because there is `v3.10-beta` release.

```
$ sudo rutupgrade
Installed version: 3.8
   Latest version: 3.9
Choose which build to install, (if you are not sure select 1)
1. Use the latest stable release
2. Use the most recent master build
Select 1 or 2: 1

Installing version 3.9 of rutorrent
Your existing rutorrent folder will be moved to /home/harupong/rutorrent_old

If you are not happy with the upgrade you can restore the old version, by rerunning this script
