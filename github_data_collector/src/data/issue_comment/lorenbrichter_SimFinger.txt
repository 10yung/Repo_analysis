just need to change to the following on line 544 of the delegate class

```
NSDictionary *options = @{(id)kAXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt: @YES};
BOOL accessibilityEnabled = AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions((CFDictionaryRef)options);
 if (accessibilityEnabled) {
     [self positionSimulatorWindow:nil];
     hideTheCursor();
}
```

Is it possible to only show gestures and taps, and not the general mouse movements? It would make a demo of an app seem even more realistic.

I have already tried every fix on your blog and everything I can find online. Nothing is working to fix the issue if you have any other suggestions please let me know.  I am attaching an image of what is happening.

I'm getting a build error when trying to run from the current Master branch:

FakeFingerAppDelegate.m:65:32: Use of undeclared identifier 'kAXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt'

Followed by a warning on the next line:

FakeFingerAppDelegate.m:66:30: Implicit declaration of function 'AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions' is invalid in C99

Am I missing a build option or something?

Hi, 
I've the same pb than https://github.com/atebits/SimFinger/issues/14, but we are in 2013. My config is : 
XCode 4.6.3
Projet compilation in OSX SDK 10.7. / My mac 64-Bit. 
The iOS simulator's version is 6.0 (369.2)
The device version in the iOS Simulator is 6.1(10B141)
I'm localised in French, and the name is "Simulateur iOS"  in the menu
I've added  a ln -s (symbolique link) in the directory 
I've load the zip of the project on  https://github.com/atebits/SimFinger/archive/master.zip

Thanks for your help.

The fix method written

Do you have a new link to your blog? Can I recommend that the README link to that blog be updated?

Hello, I try to use SimFinger with Czech language set in iPhone simulator, but the names of the faked apps stay in English. Could you tell me, how I could change them please?

It looks like iOS 4.2 removed support for the SBFakeCarrier key in the plist. I don't think there is much of anything that we can do about this, but it would be great if there was a note in the README about the supported versions of the iPhone Simulator.

This way people looking to demo an app supporting iOS 4.2+ wont be confused when the carrier string cannot be changed.  I haven't checked, but there may be other keys that are also no longer supported.

Would you check the iphone simulator's position and frames when screen resoultion is iphone simulator position when screen resoultion is 1280 x 800(13" MacBook and 13" MacBook Pro's) ?
Frame and iphone simulator seems clipped to me.

The identifier for the SimFinger simulated iOS App Store appears to be preventing the new Apple OSX 10.6.6 App Store from launching. Here's the error:

```
Process:         App Store [574]
Path:            /Users/my_user_name/Downloads/atebits-SimFinger-325d0b5/Fake/SimFinger/SimAppCollection/FakeApps/FakeAppStore/App Store.app/App Store
Identifier:      com.yourcompany.App_Store
Version:         ??? (???)
Code Type:       X86 (Native)
Parent Process:  launchd [282]
```

My guess is that it doesn't like the identifier namespaced to App_Store but, again, that's just a guess. Moving the SimFinger folder to the trash allowed Apple's App Store to launch.
