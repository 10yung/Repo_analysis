2 days holiday (No color).
5 days working (Color Green),
2 days holiday (No Color),
5 days working (Color Blue)

in total, a cycle of 20 days will be completed and will return to the beginning and it will be infinite.

I don't have a problem adding decoration to the date I want but. I have no idea how to use it in an infinite loop. Can you help me?
I cannt find this listener
When using with app bar an octagon shape shadow was visible
Current version event dot position shows under date number but I want to show Top-right of date.
i have added the event to calendar ,after that added the decorator for weekend with event,weekend without event and change the background of today's color.
 But adding such decorators event circle background is flickering like circle to oval many time.
Please suggest ho to resolve the problem 

I want to select multiple dates simultaneously.

I would like to have a checkbox instead of dotspan to allow multiple selections. Is there anything defined?
hi guys I want to change color of weekday labels im trying to set value by
`mcv_dateTextAppearance`
,`mcv_weekDayTextAppearance`,`mcv_headerTextAppearance`
 with style `@style/TextAppearance.MaterialCalendarWidget.Date` and trying to set color directly but its not working
please help me.
Can we hide weekdays in this library. The top sun, mon etc?
Like how Google's Material Date Picker shows?
Can there be an easy way to change the background drawable for currently selected day without using a decorator since the default behavior works just fine.
