DAV files are produced by Dahua security cameras
I can upload a sample if required.
The playback is somewhat supported now but no seeking and sometimes it stops before end of the file.
It can play Canon 5D4 M-jpeg 500Mb/s video,
But fps is too low ,CPU not used great on it.
It is the Canon video download:

Dear Developer,
Your Lavfilter failed to play m2ts video format with WMP12 on Windows 10 v1909. It also failed to play videos with audio encoded in Dolby TrueHD MLP FBA. 
Here is the link to the site I download all those high quality videos encoded in 8 channels and and higher for testing:
https://thedigitaltheater.com/dolby-trailers/

Pick a video encoded in Dolby TrueHD 7.1 and test play it with Lavfilters. Also pick a trailer called Pufferfish which was encoded in h265 with m2ts file format. These video and audio types cannot be played with Lavfilters. All other audio types play fine, except those mentioned. Please fix your filter to support these file types.

Plus, your filter cannot play videos with audio encoded in dtsx or DTS:X. The audio fail to play but the video works though.

Please fix these issues as soon as possible.

Thank You,

Brian

D3D11 HW encoding didnt trigger on VP90 MKV video
edit: Copy-Back (Override Automatic Hardware Device) didn't give any luck

I successfully build a DVD-graph with LAV-A+V filters latest version. Works fine in windowed-mode, but with some DVD-source i got multiple DS-error: EC_VMR_RECONNECTION_FAILED special when DVD-navigator changes to VideoManagerMenu or VideoTilteSetMenu.

So far no prob, but when video window is in fullscreen-mode, i got an smaller resized windowless video window.
This seems a problem of LAV-audiofilter because other decoders (e.g. ffdshow) don't produce such an error and will play the fullscreen properly.

I can't open a video in FAB SUBTITLER
It is recommended to compile a release version that supports China AVS + AVS2 decodingã€‚Now ffmpeg can support AVS, but I can't compile with LAV, I hope to provide a release version, thank you!
Thios happens with the latest nightlies (tested .24 and .28:

I have an Intel i5 6500 processor and GTX 1660 GPU. When I use D3D11 Native hardware decoder with my integrated graphics, MPC-HC always gives a green screen with the audio still playing in the background. But with my GTX 1660, the same works perfectly fine. Is this an issue on Intel's side or with LAV.

Player: MPC-HC + madVR
Greetings. I've been trying to set up my subtitle settings to be more robust and I've hit a snag that seems to depend on which audio is default.

I'll give an example. Lets say I have german audio default, with english secondary. And for subtitles, I have full english subtitles default and a secondary english track that translates signs and text and stuff meant to be used with the english audio.

It's easy to set. I just do ger:eng|d and I'll have it. Perfect. But what if it's reversed? If I get something else that has eng audio and sign subs default, now I'm setting it to give german audio + sign subs. 

As far as I know I can't reconcile that. I can choose "ger:eng|n" or "ger:eng|d" to work with one or the other, but it doesn't work with both things. 

I would like to be able to do something like audio: "ger;eng", subtitles: "ger|d:eng|d,ger:eng|n", or something along those lines. 

I guess that sums it up. Thanks for your time.
