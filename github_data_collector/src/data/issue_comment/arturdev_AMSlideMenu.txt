Hi,

I have noticed that sometimes when menu is closing with animation, the left view disappear before the end of the animation. However, I found that solution is just move one line of code to another place. 

In AMSlideMenuMainViewController.m, in closeLeftMenuAnimated: method, hiding the left menu (self.leftMenu.view.hidden = YES) should be moved to completionBlock of the animation.
#In many points of code you initialize `AMSlideMenuContentSegue` with identifier @"ContentSugue".

Should be checked and fixed!

Hi, thanks for the library.

I have noticed that for each press of one of the menu options, a new MainVC, LeftMenuVC y RightMenuVC is instantiated and the previous one is not released correctly.
It would be possible to reuse this navigation controller and not create a new one.

This happens witch with a StoryBoard project.

Thank you..


ContentView is not going to scale down (small) as displayed in gif image.
Is there any option from which I can make small my content view while opening leftMenu?
Good day someone could explain how to pass parameters between views I tried different ways but I have not found a solution
Hi,

[self mainSlideMenu] return nil after second call of MainVC, I use the storyboard version and the MainVC. The difference I see compared to your example is that the view -1 (just before the MainVC I have a ViewController not a NavigationController).
to fix the problem I had to do this:
`AMSlideMenuMainViewController *mainVC = [self mainSlideMenu];

```
if (mainVC==nil)
{
    UINavigationController *navigationController = self.navigationController;
    //look for mainvc
    for (UIViewController * view in navigationController.viewControllers)
    {
        AMSlideMenuMainViewController * viewtmp = (AMSlideMenuMainViewController *)view;
        if (viewtmp!=nil) mainVC = viewtmp;
    }

}
```

best regards,

Hello,

In GIF image provided in starting it is shown that when side bar is opened the side bar view covers the full screen including the status bar and the view controller size is reduced leaving the space of status bar. But when i downloaded the demo it is not the same the view controller size is not reduced. I need exactly the same as given in GIF image. Please help as soon as possible. Find the attached GIF.

Thank you.

I am not sure if I did everything right, but my left menu table is not able to scroll up and down. Any idea? Thanks.

Is it possible to perform segue with animation when triggering it with a `openContentViewControllerForMenu` call?

I swipe right to reveal the left menu and I can tap on anywhere in the displayed content view to close the menu, how can I configure so that I can swipe left to close the menu too? Thanks
