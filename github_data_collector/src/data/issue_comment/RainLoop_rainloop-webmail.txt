The original HTML for the field is 
`<input type="text" size="70" autocomplete="off" data-bind="textInput: subject, hasFocus: subject.focused"/>`

It would be nice to get the field to be remembered via an option to change the HTML but even if I could achieve this by doing it manually. I've tried changing the HTML to 
`<input type="text" size="70" autocomplete="on" name="subjectRemember" data-bind="textInput: subject, hasFocus: subject.focused" />`

Can anyone give any insight into this? Thank you.

Rainloop 5.2, CentOS 7, Owncloud 10.2

As announced by Owncloud, some deprecated calls have been removed in 10.2.
https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/34927
Such as the OCP\Config, which worked until Owncloud 10.1.1.

Error log will show the following:
`{“reqId”:“gYAVuoJgNWtHeq00BvnZ”,“level”:3,“time”:“2020-01-05T20:31:43+00:00”,“remoteAddr”:“IP-address”,“user”:“username”,“app”:“index”,“method”:“GET”,“url”:"/index.php",“message”:“Exception: {“Exception”:“Error”,“Message”:“Class ‘OCP\\Config’ not found”,“Code”:0,“Trace”:”#0 \/var\/www\/owncloud\/lib\/private\/legacy\/app.php(239): require_once()\n#1 \/var\/www\/owncloud\/lib\/private\/legacy\/app.php(190): OC_App::requireAppFile(‘rainloop’)\n#2 \/var\/www\/owncloud\/lib\/private\/legacy\/app.php(124): OC_App::loadApp(‘rainloop’)\n#3 \/var\/www\/owncloud\/lib\/base.php(896): OC_App::loadApps()\n#4 \/var\/www\/owncloud\/index.php(54): OC::handleRequest()\n#5 {main}",“File”:"\/var\/www\/owncloud\/apps\/rainloop\/appinfo\/app.php",“Line”:16}"}

I can see a way of replacing those calls here (as an example):
https://codecov.io/gh/owncloud/core/pull/34927/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YXBwcy9maWxlc190cmFzaGJpbi9saWIvRXhwaXJhdGlvbi5waHA=

Any plan to implement this update in next version?
**RainLoop version, browser, OS:**
Rainloop 1.13.0 (as a plugin of Nextcloud 16.0.7), Chrome 79.0.3945.88, MacOS 10.14.6

**Expected behavior and actual behavior:**
Expected: A configured email signature is appended as is with the signature delimiter "-- ".
Actual: The signature is appended, but the delimiter is deprived of the trailing space: "--".

**Steps to reproduce the problem:**
1. Define an email signature with signature delimiter line consisting of "-- " as per RFC 3676 section 4.3.
2. Compose a new email, check for the trailing space in the signature delimiter line.
3. Send this email to yourself and check for the trailing space in the signature delimiter line in the received email.

**Logs or screenshots:**
n/a

**Result:**
email readers are unable to interpret this line to distinguish the email content from the signature.


In local network, when I try to open the page of index.php using firefox ,progress is very slow,and developemnt tools show "mutating the [[Prototype]] of an object will cause your code to run very slowly; instead create the object with the correct initial [[Prototype]] value using Object.create"

Rainloop version: 1.12.1, SO: Windows 10, Google Chrome: 79.0.3945.88 (x64), 
Google recently announced a change in its terms which will disable less secure application access, will this impact on using rainloop for gmail accounts?

Access to LSAs will be turned off in two stages:

June 15, 2020 - Users who try to connect to an LSA for the first time will no longer be able to do so. This includes third-party apps that allow password-only access to Google calendars, contacts, and email via protocols such as CalDAV, CardDAV and IMAP. Users who have connected to LSAs prior to this date will be able to continue using them until usage of all LSAs is turned off.
February 15, 2021 - Access to LSAs will be turned off for all G Suite accounts.

*** attached google email about it
