Hello, I downloaded your revised annotation of full AFLW from
http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/compositional/AFLWinfo_release.mat
However, I couldn't find the AFLW-frontal dataset with 1314 images. Could you please help me with the problem? Thank you.
Unconstrained Face Alignment via Cascaded Compositional Learning
你好，请问什么时候能把代码开放呢？
有没有计划开放cfss或Unconstrained的cc++实现呢？
Hi,
In the test mode of singe threading, there is no error when i run the inferenceCFSS.

Because my version is 2014b, 
 I replace【if (m<100) || (matlabpool('size')==0)】  with 【if (m<100) || isempty(gcp('nocreate'))"】 for using multithreading; 
and turn on  multithreading by  【parpool(8);】 in the file(inferenceCFSS.m) .
The error as follows:
![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10649637/20828861/701e42e8-b8b4-11e6-86c9-aecb932577b4.png)

Thank you!
The result of the arrayfun() with the imtransform call in transImagesFwd.m [(lines 13-14)](https://github.com/zhusz/CVPR15-CFSS/blob/master/codes_release/trans/transImagesFwd.m#L13), causes problem when called withimages of much lower dimensions than the new row, col data. Specifically, it fails to specify the spatial locations (x, y) appropriately and thus the program crashes on the extraction of the windows before the vl_hog(). 

I  propose initially a check for the image size, and then a version with imwarp, since as mentioned [here](http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/67114-what-is-the-difference-between-imwarp-and-imtransform) it is faster and more efficient.

Therefore, all the lines where you check `(matlabpool('size')==0)` throw an exception. This can be fixed by replacing them with `isempty(gcp('nocreate'))`.

However, I'm not sure if that call works on older versions of Matlab. If someone confirms this still works then I can make a PR to fix this.
