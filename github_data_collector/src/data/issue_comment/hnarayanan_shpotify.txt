Use `mdfind`/ `kMDItemKind == Application` functionality to locate Spotify.app.
Rather than hard-conding and specifying specific locations.
This helps users who may have unconventional install locations.

@hnarayanan First, thanks for the original script included here! 

Currently we use this script to share a spotify account between users. Before meetings however, we want to be able to gracefully fade the music to a low threshhold (zero makes the room feel eerily quiet, heh). This seemed like a graceful way to approach that, but I was curious if you would be interested in including this in the original code? 
I had issues running locally, so you may want to pull and verify this works, but it seems as if it would.

Thanks again!
Starting Spotify - if it's not actually started - is magic, and should only be done explicitly.

Thus, this PR changes starting Spotify.app via `osascript` to printing the according error and exiting with 1.

Adresses #114 
Hey there, love the tool!

One feature that I would love to see is an updating spotify status command that I can keep in a small section of my screen. 

Essentially what `watch spotify -n 1` outputs, without any weird characters, updating until i ctrl-c. 

Thanks!
Currently shpotify autostarts Spotify.app if it is not running - on any command.
This behaviour is not desirable for my use case - i am trying to run shpotify in _tmux_ command line to get current song playing.

Add ability to silently quit if Spotify is not running.
Adding feature **"Search by Lyrics"** &  #play it instantly.
It could use lyric search engines to fetch song name. This is very useful since Spotify itself doesn't have this feature. And when we forget song name simply play it by the catchy lyric words we remember!
like :
`spotify play lyric kiki do you love me` --> Plays Drakes "In My Feelings"
I would be good to add the functionality of queueing songs doing something like:
```
shpotify queue song "ble"
shpotify queue album ""
```
as to be able to make yourself a short list of songs to hear at once, without it having to be a fixed album or pre-existing list.

There's already an open [issue](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/issues/462) on spotify but it has a lot of support for them to add the functionality so we can expect it to happen soon.
I'd like to do some scripting around this tool, including capturing the output. It'd be helpful if there was a flag that could be given like `--no-colors` to disable colors.
