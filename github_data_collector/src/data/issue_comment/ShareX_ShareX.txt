Just learned that you can upload video to imgur and have it attempt to convert it to gif. That would be a nice option to do.
Click on a picture preview and the program takes over the full screen.

Please add an option to instead whow the picture in the current window.
Hello everyone,
having problems adding external local storage (USB drive) since I updated to nextcloudpi v.1.20.1.
Doing all the same I did with older versions - so the external drive is added and I can see the folder, but when I click on it, it´s not opening but going back to my files.
Reinstalled nextcloudpi on another sd-card but same behaviour.
I hope the description makes the problem kinda clear.
I´m already using nextcloud for a while but I´m definitely not an experienced user - so any help is highly appreciated!
Regards
Martin

Enhancement Idea - in the main landing page of the windows application, it shows all the screenshot I've taken. Those have their random gen names above them, could it be possible to rename this with the application on the fly but double clicking on the text? Or even a re click menu option on the screenshot to rename the image.

screenshot for help of the text/name location:

thanks!
Is it possible to take screenshot and save it in custom folder that will take name from process name?
If you use the image editor on a notebook+monitor configuration, you cannot add any items at the top of the image on the connected monitor when opening the editor. That is, most likely, that the default height is used for editing from the notebook monitor, and when using the editor on a connected monitor, anything above the resolution of the notebook is not included in the editing area.
My ShareX is set to save screenshots in a DropBox folder. Afterwards, I often need to share a link to the image, which I get by right-clicking the file > Copy DropBox link.
Therefore I thought it'd be much more convenient to copy the DropBox link to clipboard right after upload. But when I set After Upload > Copy URL to clipboard, I only get a local link, which is absolutely useless in my case.
Is there a ShareX setting that sends the DropBox link to clipboard?

Thanks
Hello,

Generally I used to need reauthorize Google Drive in Destination settings every 2-3 weeks as it say that failed to upload on Google Drive, even when settings show "Status: Logged in." from I started to use ShareX like 2 years ago.

Same happent a few days ago, but this time it just logged me out completelly and clicking "Open authorize page..." does nothing. None page is opened. Right now while writting ticket, changed default browser from Opera GX to normal stable Opera and noticed it worked. Now not sure should I report it here or to Opera team? Other links opened by default browser (for example news links from game launchers) are fine in Opera GX.

Greetings

I'm uploading to s-ul.eu. It looks like it started happening after the 30th of Dec.
