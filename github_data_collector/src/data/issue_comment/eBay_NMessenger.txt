First of all very nice library ðŸ’¯ 
Since I implemented it in my application I have noticed constant crashes in the `DefaultBubble` class specifically in the method `sizeToBounds`. At the beginning I couldn't understand why it was crashing but later, after enabling thread sanitizer in xcode, I found that a data race was happening on the **path** property (multiple threads trying to read and modify the same property). Does anyone else has noticed this weird behaviour? Is there a way to fix it?

See below screenshot:

When using latest version of swift, the texture framework use old AssetsLibrary, in order to work pls add AssetsLibrary in Texture framework

Because of jankiness when adding messages, it seemed a good try to update Texture from 2.3.2 to ideally 2.7.0, or at least something more recent.  
Was able to update Texture as far as 2.3.4 with minor modifications to NMessenger to keep everything working.  However with Texture 2.4.0 addToGroup in MessageGroup fails for some reason.
Anyone else experience this?

ASDefaultPlaybackButtonType buttonType = (ASDefaultPlaybackButtonType)[parameters[@"buttonType"] intValue];
  UIColor *color = parameters[@"color"];
These lines give an error 
 Expected method to read dictionary element not found on object of type 'id<NSObject>'

In my application, I am trying to give UI like Live chat where the latest message should be shown on the bottom. I am also using Load more functionality to fetch data in group of 20
While first 20 messages shown perfectly from bottom to top using
`messangerView.messengerNode.inverted` 
but when I load more and going to display another past 20 messages on top it's not working & its appends at the bottom.
Issue# 1 : 

Why does the batch fetch content is not called by itself? 

Here is my code for that : 

    func batchFetchContent() {

        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + .seconds(1)) {
            
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                self.pageIndex += 1
                self.performCallToGetConsumerMessagesHistory(limit: "20", offsetValue: "\(self.pageIndex)", isAdd: false, completionBlock: { (cells) in
                    DispatchQueue.main.async {
                        let messageCells = self.createNextBatch()
                        self.endBatchFetchDirectly(messageCells: messageCells)
                    }
                })
            }
        }
    }


    private func endBatchFetchDirectly(messageCells: [GeneralMessengerCell]) {
        self.chatWindow?.messengerView.endBatchFetchWithMessages(messageCells)
    }



    private func endBatchFetchAdjusted(messageCells: [GeneralMessengerCell]) {
        let currentHeight = self.chatWindow?.messengerView.messengerNode.view.contentSize.height ?? 24
        self.chatWindow?.messengerView.endBatchFetchWithMessages(messageCells)
        self.chatWindow?.messengerView.addMessagesWithBlock([], scrollsToMessage: false, withAnimation: .none) {
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                if let contentHeight = self.chatWindow?.messengerView.messengerNode.view.contentSize.height {
                    let addedHeight = contentHeight - currentHeight
                    self.chatWindow?.messengerView.messengerNode.view.contentOffset.y = addedHeight
                    
                }
              }
        }
    }


issue 2 : What are the prerequisite for that ?
Batch fetch content call.
