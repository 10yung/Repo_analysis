Currently, if `setOpenInAppStore` is set to true, if the user is on iOS 10.3 or above, it still uses the StoreKit's alert. This PR will change that and show the Appirater alert if the user has chosen `setOpenInAppStore` to be true.

Also, this PR adds two more delegate methods to `AppiraterDelegate`.
- `-(void)appiraterDidDisplayAppiraterAlert:(Appirater *)appirater;` Will tell if the AppiraterAlert was shown.
- `-(void)appiraterDidDisplayStoreKitAlert:(Appirater *)appirater;` Will tell if the StoreKit alert was shown.

when appirater used by cocoapods in swift project, appirater can't get correct localized string due to wrong resource bundle path.
// If SKStoreReviewController is used, skip the custom dialog and directly go the the rating 

Hello,

It would be nice to still show the custom dialog first, you could use it to ask the user if they are happy. If not, there is no reason to show the window where they can easily tap on 1 star.
I think that Apple has changed the direction url of application pages on AppStore after they change AppStore app. When I click of course button on rate popup it directs to AppStore but cant open the app page with

"itms-apps://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewContentsUserReviews?id=APP_ID&onlyLatestVersion=true&pageNumber=0&sortOrdering=1&type=Purple+Software"

but it works with 

"itms-apps://itunes.apple.com/app/idAPP_ID"

Can you look for that @arashpayan ?

Thanks

GitHub changed the way Markdown headings are parsed, so this change fixes it.
