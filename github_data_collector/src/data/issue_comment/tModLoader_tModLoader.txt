## Description

In the base game, connecting a console (or pressing the WASD keys) will make the cursor draw an infinity symbol. In tModLoader, when the game loads mods, the cursor is redirected to the top left of the screen. It shouldn't be too hard to do this action slightly below the cancel button while finding mods. 

Side note: also make the cancel button accessible to controllers. Probably warrants another issue detailing complete controller support.

## Possible Drawbacks
Not much, really. This is almost completely harmless and won't even affect many tmodloader users. This is purely novelty.

## Additional info
N/A
At first, I used the version of TML v0.10. When I changed to v0.11, I couldn't compile mod source code in the game

### Description
Unloading a mod with placed tile entities keeps references in `Terraria.DataStructures.TileEntity.ByX` when exiting into the title screen

### Log File
totally applicable

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Load mod with TEs
2. Go into a world (tested SP), place TE, use it maybe
3. Save & Exit world
4. Disable mod and reload
5. Create a memory snapshot and find references to the TE

### Expected behavior 
Since I'm on the title screen after exiting the world it'd expect it to be unloaded and thus `Terraria.DataStructurers.TileEntity.ByX` should not store tile entity positions and ids on the title screen

### Actual behavior
`Terraria.DataStructures.TileEntity.ByID` as well as `Terraria.DataStructures.TileEntity.ByPosition` are not ready yet to let go of my mods precious TileEntities causing the mod list to display the "not fully unloaded" warning.

### Reproduction frequency
yes

when ever I try to click on things with my mouse it always goes to the thing that was highlighted even if my mouse is highlighting another thing and the only way I can move on the home screen is to use wasd and it wont let me update and I tried to check the mouse without tmodloader and it worked until I put tmodloader back on terraria
When using the generic approach to saving and loading a List of Item, you'll end up with undesirable results:

```
public override void Load(TagCompound tag) {
	TestA = tag.Get<List<Item>>("TestA");
	TestB = tag.GetList<TagCompound>("TestB").Select(ItemIO.Load).ToList();
}

public override TagCompound Save() {
	return new TagCompound {
		["TestA"] = TestA,
		["TestB"] = TestB.Select(ItemIO.Save).ToList(),
	};
}
```
In this example,  TestB will Save and Load properly as Air, but TestA will Save and Load as Unloaded Items.

My guess is this logic doesn't expect the "<Type> = Terraria.Item" that will result from the automatic approach:
```
public static void Load(Item item, TagCompound tag) {
	if (tag.Count == 0) {
		item.netDefaults(0);
		return;
	}
```

A possible solution is this, but I'm not sure yet, I'm not sure if I'm missing something or if trimming such tags should happen beforehand:
```
public static void Load(Item item, TagCompound tag) {
	if (tag.Count == 0 || tag.Count == 1 && tag.GetString("<type>") == "Terraria.Item") {
		item.netDefaults(0);
		return;
	}
```

### Description
Im on Windows 64, recently repaired laptop. I was playing Terraria, and decided to download TModloader to play Calamity. So I tried to install this, both manually, and with the automatic installer, and I get the following error message, which I dont seem to get if I revert to Vanilla Terraria, then upgrade to v1.5. I also get the error upgrading from 1.5.

"System.BadImageFormatException: An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007000B)
    at Steamworks.NativeMethods.SteamAPI_RestartAppIfNecessary(AppId_tunOwnAppID)
   at Terraria.Social.Steam.CoreSocialModule.Initialize()
   at Terraria.SocialAPI.Initialize(Nullable`1 mode)
   at Terraria.Program.LaunchGame_0   "

If It helps, Terraria is on a separate drive from steam.

### Steps to Reproduce
Install newest TML from Vanilla, or upgrade from 1.5


### Expected behavior 
Terraria should start normally

### Actual behavior
Crash

### Reproduction frequency
Consistent. I will try with a completely new install of Vanilla, play for a bit, and see if that changes anything.

### Additional Information
Newly repaired computer, Windows install is ~1week old.

**NOTE:** This replaces #743. My other branch got a little screwy so I made a fresh one.

### Description of the Change
Currently, hovering over a UI element and scrolling the mouse wheel will adjust your hotbar in addition scrolling. This is obviously undesirable, so this change aims to fix that.

It was a little tricky because of the order events happen. The important ones from my perspective:

- `Main.InGameUI.Update()` -> Technically this happens first, but because the player's input hasn't been read yet, it's actually one step behind for picking up scrolls.
- `PlayerInput.UpdateInput()` -> Sets scroll wheel values.
- `Player.Update()` -> Updates the hotbar/recipes position based on scroll value.

This creates a problem, since we don't want the hotbar to move if a scrollbar has been scrolled, but we haven't reached that point yet. It's also not possible (or at least quite difficult) to identify if a scrollbar _will_ update at the point of `Player.Update()`. My change records the input scroll value when attempting to move the hotbar and delays processing by one cycle. This gives the UI elements and mods an opportunity to reset the value if they handle the scrolling and want to cancel out the hotbar offset.

### Alternate designs
I originally relocated the hotbar handling so it would happen just after the UI update, and added a condition that it would only update if a scrollbar event had not been handled. However, this was a bit of a more significant change to the original code, so it was suggested that I try delaying the processing a frame instead of changing the order altogether.

I also tried identifying in the player update method whether the user was hovering on a UI element with a scrollbar. I did not get this working, and decided there must be a better method.

### Why this should be merged into tModLoader
It's a bug that is core to scrollbars with tModLoader, so it impacts lots of mods.

### Benefits
Better user experience.

### Possible drawbacks
Some mods may have relied on the old behavior. For instance, BossChecklist (and many of @JavidPack's other mods) would calculate how much the hotbar moved and reverse it. [(See here.)](https://github.com/JavidPack/BossChecklist/blob/master/BossChecklistUI.cs#L205) This fix breaks the workaround, but obviously it's better to have a proper fix in tModLoader that prevents stutter.

### Applicable Issues
N/A

### Sample Usage
N/A
### Description
Achievements sometimes seem to reset when relaunching tModLoader. **May or may not have to due with new Steam Library UI**, as its been happening since that beta was released and used. Seems to nearly always happen on computer reboot, and when relaunching Steam.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Reboot computer/ relaunch Steam (I think it has happened with both of these on occasion)
2. Launch tModLoader through normal means, or through debugging
3. Enter a world with a character
4. Brace for incoming (obtainable) achievement spam

### Expected behavior 
Achievements should be maintained as completed when completed when relaunching the game.

### Actual behavior
Achievements are re-obtainable and marked as incomplete.

### Reproduction frequency
Achievement reset doesn't seem to happen EVERY time, but when rebooting computer its almost guaranteed.
