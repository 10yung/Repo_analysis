Not an issue, but an tip from an old user that I think needs to be documented. 

There is a setting to save current settings on exit, but if you setup the appearance the way you like it you have two options to have it open in the save way.

1) Set save settings on exit to yes, then save and reopen app and turn this setting off.
2) Hold down shift key and right double-click the upper left icon of the file image.  This will save the current settings to the default.



Even though the original Winfile had it
Here one MDI child has ClientEdge, and the other does not

I've made this work using Resource Hacker so I can achieve clean DPI levels on Winfile

Feature request to add file / directory browse buttons to various fields

This is mainly for dialogs that are opened from the FILE menu

I think it would be appropriate for these dialogs

File > move
File > copy
File > run
File > goto directory
File > search
Shortcut key for Create New Folder - CTRL+SHIFT+N, like in Windows Explorer
Creation Date column in detail view as currently there is only date modified.
Header in Details view to sort Name, Date, Size etc... just like in Windows Explorer.

Should be able to short ascending and descending.
It would be nice if I could start the file manager from the command line using the `winfile` command.
