How do you calculate the FLOPs for each model? Are there relevant papers or learning materials available?
And is this FLOPs defined as the time it takes to run a forward propagation during testing or the time it takes to complete forward and backward propagation completely during training?
You've calculated the FLOPS per respective CNN architecture, what execution performance can be expected from particular device (GPU or CPU)? means what would be estimated inference time per single image where FLOPS performance of device is known? 
FLOPs = Floating-point operations.
FMAs = Floating-point multiplication-adds.
Based on the values you give, I think they should be FMAs instead of FLOPs, and the number of FLOPs is approximately 2 * FMAs. Could you please clarify? Thanks.
Please tell me what is mean by res5c_relu? and why 
Estimates for a single full pass of model at input size 224 x 224 takes 8GFLOPs
while, res5c_relu features with the network 224 x 224 input sizes using a batch size of 128 takes 974 GFLOPs?
