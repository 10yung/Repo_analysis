Hello,
I'm Using this library to capture image and video in my application. Its works fine but problem is there when I'm capturing picture in portrait mode then captured Image return by SDK is landscape. Another Issue when capturing picture with landscape left then result Image 90 degree rotated.

Please Resolve this issue ASAP.
There is no error message if my device not having enough memory for video recording.
when camera  landscape left , right and down â€¦ show image protrait 
I am trying to remove the Camera from my view but I can't.
I have tried [camera stop], [self.camera removeFromParentViewController] and self.camera = nil.

Still it's not removing from super.
Could you please provide me a solution for this problem?

Thanks in advance
