Hi,
when running the command setup.m, I am getting the following errors. I tried this on a windows computer as well but the same problem persists :

> setup
> Warning: Name is nonexistent or not a
> directory: 3rd-party 
> In path at 110
>   In addpath at 87
>   In setup at 1 
> Warning: Name is nonexistent or not a
> directory: sample-maps 
> In path at 110
>   In addpath at 87
>   In setup at 1 
> Warning: Name is nonexistent or not a
> directory: tests 
> In path at 110
>   In addpath at 87
>   In setup at 1 
> Warning: Name is nonexistent or not a
> directory: tools 
> In path at 110
>   In addpath at 87
>   In setup at 1 

The gui comes up and I can add the landmarks and obstacles, but when clicking execute slam simulation, nothing happens. 

Can you suggest something to fix this.

Thanks 

Alex
