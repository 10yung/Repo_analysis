i faced errors when running
`dbSet.Remove(entity);` & ` dataContext.Entry(entity).State = EntityState.Modified;`

The object cannot be deleted because it was not found in the ObjectStateManager
where dbcontext turned down to be null in each request
while using correct connectionString, i cannnot build the correct database, tables etc...
sir good work you have done a lot of work i appericiate you on this but sir  when we invite people to the group no invitation is stored in database and so user get no notification same the case is is inviting the people to follow the cant search the person to invite for following goal
How I will connect to two databases in SocialGoal Infrastructure??
SocialGoal.Data  Repository How testing

Navigating to Account/Followers, clicking on a follower's link, throws NULL Reference exception cause UserId is null at: 

var followers = Mapper.Map<IEnumerable<ApplicationUser>, IEnumerable<FollowersViewModel>>(users);

id will be null when reaching Account/UserProfile(string id)
var user = userService.GetUserProfile(id);

Changing both  FollowingViewModel and FollowersViewModel to have string Id (not UserId) and their respective partial views will solve the problem.

updates in .net 4.5.1 and above ?

Changed the one of the properties of  User. From "UserId" to just "Id" since the ApplicationUser is just inheriting the IdentityUser' Id.
