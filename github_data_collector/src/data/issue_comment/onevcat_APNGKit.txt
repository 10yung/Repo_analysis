Using Xcode 11 GM with Swift 5 tells me to convert APNGKit to support Swift 5.
I can see only one line of code needs to be changed, will we see an update for that?
Thanks!

MSStickers object expects an URL. How do I use this with the iMessage Stickers?
Sometimes my app crashes when removing `APNGImageView` in Objective-C coded `UIViewController` .
In case of Swift, that's not happen.

I think this workaround is not enough for Objective-C.
https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/blob/ccad7588e3428bfcd53862f457c5bda61f298e9f/APNGKit/APNGImageView.swift#L168-L169
In Objective-C, sometimes `deinit` is not called when removing the `APNGImageView` from the parent view  because of `AutoreleasePool`. So this workaround dose not affect, and crash it.

commit 5f1e32b2391663ac558cced0a5a6de96a9c931bc causes this issue: if an image is hidden and the app enters background, when entering foreground again, the image appears and animates. This commit does not covers the case if isHidden == true.
In my app I have a looping animation. One thing I've notice is the animation will start from index 0 when all I want is the animation to resume from where it left off.

This adds the ability to "pause" the animation. 

I've updated the `WillResignActive` so that when it resumes, it keeps the same index and resumes the animation (instead of starting from 0 again). This results in a cleaner app and less jaring when the animation resets itself.


使用的时最新的demo，看起来是动画的timer延迟了一段时间调用引起的。
**The repeat count info is not working.**

The repleatCount in png metadata means that repeat animation after end of the last play.
So #0 means that 1 time animation from first frame.
#1 means that 2 times repeat.
#2 means that 3 time repeat.

REF. https://wiki.mozilla.org/APNG_Specification
`num_plays` indicates the number of times that this animation should play; if it is 0, the animation should play indefinitely. If nonzero, the animation should come to rest on the final frame at the end of the last play.
Hello, I've been using the library for quite a long time, and it's great. Recently I found an issue with specific apng files which leads to and unexpected output when loading the file with the library. There is no different method when loading apng files, it just happen sometimes to specific files.

Here you have a video of the glitch (look at the vertical line created between the letter t and y):

And here the expected result:

Hey,

I'm trying to use APNGKit with Carthage in Objective-C context. I can't use Swift because its an Unity project. Is this combination possible? I imported `<APNGKit/APNGKit-Swift.h>` but the header file does only expose the default `init` and `initWithDecoder` methods. I tried `[[APNGImage alloc] contentsOfFile:@""]` wich throws `No visible @interface for 'APNGImage' declares the selector 'contentsOfFile:'`
