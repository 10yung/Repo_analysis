**Background Information:**
 - Build: 19041.21 (should be unrelated)
 - WSL: Arch
 - Version: current

**Describe the bug**
The new "baseexec_gen" function, which has to succeed at least once,

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
- Install a non-store Distro (using [wsldl](https://github.com/yuk7/wsldl), or `wsl --import`
- Install wslu >= 2.3.3 in that Distro
- Run any wslu command (`wslvar`, `wslview`, `wslupath`, `wslsys`, `wslfetch`, `wslusc`, and `wslsys` are all affected)
  - See error messages appear related to a registry key and some path executables listed by `find`
  - From what I can tell, the commands then proceed to function correctly despite this function failing.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
- wslu commands to function as normal, without error messages

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
The current `baseexec_gen` in the header expects a registry key called "PackageFamilyName" to be present for the current Distro, which doesn't seem to be created for Distros installed manually instead of through the store.

Also, within that function, the first call to `reg.exe` doesn't fully qualify the path which may cause issues if these commands are run during login before `$PATH` is fully set up.
This is the pull request for the release of wslu 3.0.0.

This will be the first component of wslu written in C. Thus, it will be developed in a dedicated repo: https://github.com/wslutilities/wslconf

Update 1: as more I think about it, it is better to write it as a Windows Desktop app to manage all system at once instead of just each command per system, Also, put on the store.

**Background Information:**
 - Build: 18875.1000 (version 1903)
 - WSL:  Pengwin
 - Version: 1.2.3.0

**Describe the bug**
x-www-browser command has problem with "tcgetpgrp" and It looks like "tcgetpgrp" problem. But when I checked the internet it shows, it is an old bug and It was fixed.
 

**To Reproduce**
I ran jupyter lab (it should open "localhost" link for auth) 

**Expected behavior**
x-www-browser should work

**Additional context**

To confirm it is actually coming from your x-www-browser

Second picture has no "windows interoperability" and basically no "tcgetpgrp" problem appeared 


If there is anything needed, I would love to provide it.

Thank you.



the Cygwin project has this tool, which opens a FILE with the default application

it seems the closest match is wslview, but only works with URLs not local files
