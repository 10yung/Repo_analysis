I am curious if it is, and if yes how you did it?

hey yosh :-)
I really enjoyed all the useful stuff you collected and bookmarked a lot of things.
I did not check things in a long time, but today went through quite a few of my older bookmarks to clean things up and figured that a lot of your links are dead.

It seems you either moved or removed a lot of helpful content.
I guess I can still find it checking previous commit, but I wonder about the reason.


Hey @yoshuawuyts, I really enjoy this repository as it has all kinds of useful tidbits in it :+1: 

The [browserify](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/knowledge/blob/master/browserify.md) and [streams](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/knowledge/blob/master/streams.md) references are very well written. Have you considered contributing them to   [nodejs/docs](https://github.com/nodejs/docs)?

@Qard or @chrisdickinson any thoughts?

Create a dedicated overview page - http://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/

a bit, I guess?
