I am getting a crash in this code block in wtftw/core/src/config.rs

It seems to be in the first line as I have gotten output from debug! just before result().

Any thoughts

        if let Ok(lib) = DynamicLibrary::open(Some(&Path::new(&libname.unwrap().unwrap().path().as_os_str().to_str().unwrap()))) {
            unsafe {
                if let Ok(symbol) = lib.symbol("configure") {
                    let result = mem::transmute::<*mut u8, extern fn(&mut WindowManager,
                                                        &dyn WindowSystem,
                                                        &mut Config)>(symbol);

                    self.internal.library = Some(lib);
                    result(m, w, self);
                } else {
                    error!("Error loading config module")
                }
            }
        }

Hi II have an issue that wtftw runs fine  with no config.rs in place but as soon as I add one the system dies on startup after compiling the library. Nothing useful seems to get logged so I was wondering if there was any logging that could be enabled.

The other option that I would be fine with is to have the config.re be built in and not use ithe dynamic linking but I have not yet seen  how that can be done.
I love the looks of this window manager.

Am I right that you are intending to use rust as thin configuration language in that same way that xmonad uses haskell. That is one the the things that I love about using xmonad.

Also do you have plans of a dynamic master/stack layout similar to xmonad. Looking through the sources I only see the bsp style layout
