It says my new Firefox version is behind the times. Uhm. No, it is so new your code doesn't know what it is. Fix that, please.
Haven't seen activity for quite some time now... what happened to this project?
Hello David, Duncan, and contributors,

I'd like your opinion:

If we have a node in a 3D scene, and it has many descendants (a sub tree), what should happen when we apply opacity with a value less than `1` to it?
1. It, and all of it's children should become transparent, multiplying opacities down the scene graph.
2. It's content should become transparent but not that of its descendants.
3. Same as (1), but the whole object should be flattened into a plane.

The reason I want your opinion is because the new specs for CSS 3D (css-transforms) [state here](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/#grouping-property-values) that the answer is (3).

To see what I mean, view these two examples in Chrome 53 or higher:
- https://jsfiddle.net/trusktr/ymonmo70/16
- https://jsfiddle.net/trusktr/ymonmo70/17

The second example has opacity applied to the node that contains all the sub-nodes which compose the car. The opacity, according to spec, flattens the car into a plane (turns it into paper!).

I'm asking various 3D engine authors for opinions of what the correct or most expected behavior should be.

All the best,
~ Joe

I'm not sure, if it is a bug that has anything to do with the turbulenz_engine. 
I have a bug report open [at openSUSE](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=986180), 
so please feel free to just close the current issue promptly, if You do not see it to be relevant, 
but, the console output is:

hello, sry if this isnt the right place to ask...

i`m just starting with turbulenz and followed some steps from http://docs.turbulenz.com/starter/getting_started_guide.html 

now i want to undestand more about some apis, like camera api, and cant find a good documentation about it, i found this http://docs.turbulenz.com/jslibrary_api/camera_api.html but i need more examples, someone can guide me? for now i need some documentations about camera, floor, creating cube objects and colisions objects. Any good youtuber or website with examples? I need examples with step by step description.

Look for the code applying : Event listeners on shapeB

line 11210 : cb.thisObject = shapeA;

need to be replaced by cb.thisObject = shapeB;

Otherwise the shape A will register callback to itself many times.

Hi,

I'm trying to get the jsfiddle prototype app to run, however its not working for me.
Is this a browser issue that is only happening with me ? anyone have idea of what is wrong ?

http://jsfiddle.net/jamesaustin/WF47C/

```
vmath.js:4931 Uncaught ReferenceError: TurbulenzEngine is not defined
turbulenzbridge.js:21 Uncaught SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin "http://fiddle.jshell.net" from accessing a frame with origin "http://jsfiddle.net". Protocols, domains, and ports must match.
turbulenzservices.js:158 Uncaught SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin "http://fiddle.jshell.net" from accessing a frame with origin "http://jsfiddle.net". Protocols, domains, and ports must match.
turbulenzengine.js:183 GraphicsDevice not created yet.WebGLTurbulenzEngine.onerror @ turbulenzengine.js:183
turbulenzengine.js:117 Uncaught ReferenceError: WebGLMathDevice is not defined
```

So glTF has hit 1.0

https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-finalizes-gltf-1.0-specification

It's made with WebGL engines in mind, so, is there any place for it on the Turbulenz roadmap?
