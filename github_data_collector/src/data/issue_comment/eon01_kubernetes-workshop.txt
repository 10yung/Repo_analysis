* Access the list of pods should not use the command with "$HOSTNAME"
* The command with "$HOSTNAME" needs verbs: ["get"] not ["list"], so causes 403 Forbidden
fix docker run arg typo: --it is not valid. 
Needs to be -it or --interactive --tty
using shorter version


When I apply it, I still get the 403 when I run the curl command. When I check "Cluster Roles" in the dashboard, the role seems to be defined.

Thanks for an otherwise great resource! (Got me up and running with most of the stuff I need, without too much trouble.)
I'm still quite new to Kubernetes, but I've read that Kubernetes secrets provide a way to securely pass credentials etc. to containers.
In `kubernetes/api-deployment.yaml`, `CLIENT_ID` etc. are hard-coded, which is probably not a good practice, since those files are mentioned to be committed to VCS. I'd like to have the workshop being extended in a way that it should how to properly handle such confidential variables ðŸ™‚.
In `README.md` there is the following command:

```bash
docker run --it  --name tgr -p 5000:5000 -e CLIENT_ID="xxxxxxx" -e CLIENT_SECRET="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" -e DEBUG="True" tgr
```

There is two issues with that:
1. It should be `-it`, rather than `--it`, since the first one is invalid
2. You also need to specify `-e HOST="0.0.0.0"` and `-e PORT="5000"` in order for the app to start.

Additionally, you might want to add:
1. `--rm` flag
2. When not explicitly passing a value for the env parameters (e.g. just `-e CLIENT_ID`) the values from the user's local environment are being used, which might be preferable (because easier), since the user sourced the `.env` file before anyway.
