Would it be possible to provide a custom transformer/converter that would be used for nested field?

Our usecase is that ScalaPB prduces case classes with `ByteString` fields, but in our domain case classes we use `ByteVector` (from `scodec`). So we would like to be able to provide a `ByteString` => `ByteVector` trasformer which would enable converting from ScalaPB to domain.

It would be analogous to [Chimney's `Transformer`](https://scalalandio.github.io/chimney/#Customtransformations)
The library will be useful not only in jvm but also in .js/.native/.shared projects
adding a `to` method on any product has significant chance of conflicting with other libraries (e.g. `EitherOps` in cats)
