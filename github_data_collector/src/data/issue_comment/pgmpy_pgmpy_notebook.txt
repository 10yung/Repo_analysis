ImportError: cannot import name 'DiscreteFactor' from 'pgmpy.factors' 
When I try to run this code:

std_normal_pdf = lambda x : np.exp(-x*x/2) / (np.sqrt(2*np.pi))
std_normal = ContinuousFactor(['x'],std_normal_pdf)
std_normal.discretize(RoundingDiscretizer, low=-3, high=3, cardinality=12)

I obtain the following error:

Thank you
In the Linear Gaussian CPD chapter,when using LinearGaussianBayesianNetwork ,there have following codes:

`cpd1.variables = [*cpd1.evidence, cpd1.variable]`
`cpd2.variables = [*cpd2.evidence, cpd2.variable]`
`cpd3.variables = [*cpd3.evidence, cpd3.variable]`
However,it caused syntax error and can't run it . So I changed it to 

`cpd1.variables = ["".join(cpd1.evidence), cpd1.variable]`
`cpd2.variables  = ["".join(cpd2.evidence), cpd2.variable]`
`cpd3.variables  = ["".join(cpd3.evidence), cpd3.variable]`

But "ValueError: ('CPD defined on variable not in the model', <pgmpy.factors.continuous.LinearGaussianCPD.LinearGaussianCPD object at 0x000000000AFECA58>)"
occured.I don't kown what to do .By the way, Iâ€˜m in Python2 Enviroment,
https://github.com/pgmpy/pgmpy_notebook/blob/master/notebooks/5.%20Approximate%20Inference%20in%20Graphical%20Models.ipynb
most of the work here is very light - pgmpy isn't available in anaconda - so I included a small bit of code -
```
import sys
sys.path.append('/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages/')
```
that looks for the python 3 framework - this only seems to be a problem on mac with jupyter notebook.  

This is an initial thought of how to handle this, perhaps some other thoughts would be good around this.
Hi there,

   In the three_nodes.png image, for Common Cause the arrows should be pointing from $A\rightarrow B\leftarrow C$, and likewise, for Common Effect, the arrows should be pointing fr

Recently we refactored pgmpy (https://github.com/pgmpy/pgmpy/pull/731) so we need to update the notebooks according to that.
