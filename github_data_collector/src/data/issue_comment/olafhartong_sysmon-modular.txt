As per [Mitre detection techniques  ](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1482/) if  and adversary tries to collect knowledge about domain trust such as nltest /domain_trusts. 
I have written a sysmon rule to detect T1482.

It's not related to this thing but I wanted to know is there a way to Map **Kill Chain** phases ? or is it already done somehow. ??

Please Guide.
What may be the reason ?

Hi,

I am new to sysmon and experimenting with configs from this repository.
Now I have installed a clean client with my baseline settings and I get a lot triggers for the rules T1130/T1089. 
I came to the conclusion that this happens after every GPUpdate since my settings tell the client to process every object even if these have not changed.

Would there be a good way to filter this events. One possibility I see is to filter based on the Image which did the change. In this case it would be svchost.exe. Now I wonder if this would lead to missing out on critical detections.

Thx Bernhard
Fantastic work on doing the mapping; love it! 

We use a modified version of either yours or Swift's config and remove entries from certain areas to reflect what we want to see in our environment. With modular, it'd be super handy if we could have a file of things we want to remove that the script would reference when it's done putting things together that would then remove those entries. 

That way, we could update from the git when there's a change and not have to manually go remove entries from the final product.

Thanks!
Hi,

I have been testing the latest master branch with the latest sysmon, I have customised by removing some of the rules for tools i do not use, i have also added a new rule as below.  From my testing though it seems part of the config is not applying,  My rule is not applied and generates alot of events, if i dump the config with sysmon -c , picking some key executables from the config i cannot find them in the dump, where as if i use swiftonsecuritys z-alpha config i can find matching words.

Below is my 10_process_access config and an example of portion of the event firing still.  Also event 12 seems to hit alot whereas z-alpha doesnt, comparing the configs i cannot see why it would be triggering unless the event hides the actual reg path.  I have tried your default config and seem to have similar events triggering with the obvious inclusion of sfc.exe.

Any suggestions/tests?

Hi,

Congrats for this great work!
just suggesting a few more exlclusions, regarding the Microsoft Azure Sentinel SIEM's agent :)

**PROCESS CREATION**

`
<Sysmon schemaversion="4.22">
	<EventFiltering>
	<RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
		<ProcessCreate onmatch="exclude">
		<Rule groupRelation="and">
			<ParentCommandLine condition="is">"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent\MonitoringHost.exe" -Embedding</ParentCommandLine>
			<CommandLine condition="is">C:\Windows\system32\cscript.exe" /nologo "MonitorKnowledgeDiscovery.vbs</CommandLine> 
		<!--Microsoft Sentinel SIEM agent, based on MOM-->
		</Rule>
		</ProcessCreate>
	</RuleGroup>
	</EventFiltering>
</Sysmon>
`

**PIPE CREATION:**

`
<Sysmon schemaversion="4.22">
	<EventFiltering>
	<RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
		<PipeEvent onmatch="exclude">
		<Image condition="is">"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent\MonitoringHost.exe"</Image>
		<!--Microsoft Sentinel SIEM agent, based on MOM-->
		</PipeEvent>
	</RuleGroup>
	</EventFiltering>
</Sysmon>
`
