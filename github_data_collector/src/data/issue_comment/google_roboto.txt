the password dot is small and doesn't scale well with font size. When font size are big, dot still tiny

Please add Latin letter glottal I
Please add signs ꞽ = U+A7BD (Latin small letter glottal I) and Ꞽ = U+A7BC (Latin capital letter glottal I) to Latin Extended D. These are part of Unicode 12 and are used in Egyptology. They are not found in Roboto as of 13.01.2020
Here is an example of how these letters look like (small and capital glottal I as the first letter of italicized words in the passage

A Danish customer noticed that the overring on the Å character was cut off in the input fields of our website, and after some investigation I determined that this was happening due to their font-size. I tested this out a bit and found that the input field height wasn't adjusted to account for the overring at various font-sizes (I didn't see an obvious pattern). 

At first I assumed this was a Chromium issue, but I was able to create a simple test page (HTML page attached to this issue as .txt) that demonstrated the problem in Internet Explorer, EdgeHTML-based Edge, and Firefox as well. As such, I'm submitting this as an issue here in the hopes that this is something that can be corrected in the font.

Hey,
we want to use this font in a WPF App. In WPF you reference fonts by it´s name and not it´s filename. 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6453640/how-to-include-external-font-in-wpf-application-without-installing-it/22669818

So in Roboto the name for Roboto-Bold.ttf and Roboto-Regular.ttf is the same. See also attachment.

What can we do to fix this and use the bold and regular font in our WPF app?
Some characters, like _g_, are getting their right edge clipped when using the italic version of Roboto Regular.

- [Italics, clipped](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cSG9s.png)

This appears to be only on Windows and limited to IE and Firefox.

And i can't figure out where is a problem :/ 
₮ sign missing
The letter eñe (ñ) is part of the Spanish alphabet.
Examples of words:
year - año
brother in law - cuñado
old - añejo

**'ş'** letter looks smaller than **'s'** when lower case. It's basically 's' with tail. I'm facing this problem in my own web application which uses Roboto via CDN. And also facing on Gmail. 
Attaching screenshots from Gmail so you can notice. Thanks for beautiful font.
