- Vectorised most operations to improve performance (program now runs
only two nested loops instead of four).
- Added optional variable `dispboo`: allows the user to select whether the
filter bank will be plotted or not, e.g. 
```Matlab
gaborArray = gaborFilterBank(5,8,39,39); % does not plot the filters
gaborArray = gaborFilterBank(5,8,39,39, true); % plots the filters as usual
```
