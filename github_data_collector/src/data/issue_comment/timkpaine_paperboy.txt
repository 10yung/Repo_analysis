**Describe the bug**
working in ubuntu 18.04
after running the first three commands 
npm install

i get this warning... 
npm WARN ts-jest@23.10.5 requires a peer of jest@>=22 <24 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.

npm run build - runs fine
pip install -e .  - says it installs successfully

i ran "python -m paperboy"

and got this error

https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/operators/papermill_operator.py

right now its hardcoded to local output and it dumps into `~/Downloads` across all schedulers

If notebook generates outputs, we should be able to monitor these and generate alerts when user-defined conditions are met.

Will be working on it [here](https://medium.com/@t.paine154/production-notebooks-4ac545f80a9a)

Didnt read the docs:
"If both args and kw are None, then the default value is None. If args is a tuple and kw is a dict, then the default is created as klass(*args, **kw). If exactly one of args or kw is None, the None is replaced by () or {}, respectively."
