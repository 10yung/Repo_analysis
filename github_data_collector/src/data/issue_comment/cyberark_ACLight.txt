I had this warning message:
Scanning ACLs - Layer 4
WARNING: An error occurred while enumerating through a collection: The (&(name=*)(distinguishedname=*)(|(objectSid=S-1-5-21-915214332-934432599-2099212325-31100)(objectSid=S-1-5-21-915214332-93443259
9-2099212325-31990)(objectSid=))) search filter is invalid.

There were no previous layer warnings or errors.
