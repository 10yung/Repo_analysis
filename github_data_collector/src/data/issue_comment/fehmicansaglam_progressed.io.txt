Hi,

First I have to admit... this is amazing!
However, it seems that the app doesn't recognize this markdown when other markdown such as :books: would work.
Is it normal? Any clue why? Any chance that it would work with the app in the future?

Thanks and keep up the great work!

I would love it if the suffix could support strings of length greater than 1. eg. if I want to show that the bar's maximum is 95 and not 100 I would've used "out of 95" as a suffix.
I hope this fixes #15.
There is a limit of 999 for how big the progress value can be.  While I see that it can be a good thing to _have_ such a limit, I would appreciate if it could be made larger.  For my project, 9999 would be enough, but maybe even 99999 would be a suitable limit?

# Background
I have a project where my progress goal is over 3000.  When my progress passed 1000, I was happy about that, until I saw that the progress can no longer be displayed.

So this does not work:
````
Progress: ![1039](http://progressed.io/bar/1039?scale=3299&suffix=+)
of 3299 tests passed
````

I have a workaround, but it feels a bit clunky, and I would like do be able to use my actual numbers directly:
```
Progress: ![1039](http://progressed.io/bar/103?scale=329&suffix=9)
of 3299 tests passed
```
Progress: ![1039](http://progressed.io/bar/103?scale=329&suffix=9) of 3299 tests passed

I'd like to give you a PR about more parameters support like following, but forgive me stupid that I can't even run the codes that you provided. Maybe I will study Scala someday, but I'll show you my idea because that's simple to implements them, if you like them.
- color  `request a fixed color no mater what progress is it`
- suffix=  `suffix is not support empty now, but sometime users may need show 70 without % or other chars`
- text `a text param is for replacing the progress number like 70%, draw as 70% but show text instead of 70%(not like title)`
- width `a fixed width to draw`

I have no idea if this feature already exist, but the bar is too short for my purpose, if you could customize if the user could choose length of the bar, that would be amazing :+1: 

Hi,
I used progressed.io in one of my markdown scripts. Its nice, but its not showing negative or floating point numbers.

Example

![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/9?title=progress)

![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/9.4?title=progress)

![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/-9?title=progress)
