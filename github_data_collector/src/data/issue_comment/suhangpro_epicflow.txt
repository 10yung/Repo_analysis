Tried this
`I1_eq_path = '../I1_eq.png';`
`I2_eq_path = '../I2_eq.png';`
`flow_save_path = '../flow.flo';`
`f = get_epicflow(I1_eq_path, I2_eq_path, flow_save_path);`

but got this error 
deepmatching-static:** conv.cpp:710: void fastconv(float_image*, float_layers*, int, int, int, float, int, res_scale*): Assertion `res->res_map.pixels || !"error: ran out of memory before sgemm"' failed.

This looks like [similar issue](https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/deepmatching/issues/1) but there is no solution available yet, do you have any work around for this?

Thanks
I want to complie the Epicflow code by myself. (macOS 10.12)
but I get this error (The error is same using the original Makefile):

`image.c:214:36: error: cannot convert between vector values of different size ('float' and 'v4sf' (aka '__v4sf'))`

how to solve this problem?

Thanks very much! 


 Hi @suhangpro  , 
    Thank you for your code. I have downloaded your code and use provided test code to generate optical flow of two images. I just choose two frames of a video, but there are some errors when I run the code.  
    Errors display as:

    What's the problem with it? I need some more operations?? Thank you~
