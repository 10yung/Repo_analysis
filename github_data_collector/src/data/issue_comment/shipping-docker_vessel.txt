## Is there a way to change the node version ?
I have install via npm `n` but I can not manage to change the node version.
Is there anyway you can do that since I can not bash into the image or ssh in ?

 
This new PR supports laravel websockets running on same container to have a good integration with websockets Library, it runs on PORT 6001 and works only installing its library.
## Description
I've used these steps: https://vessel.shippingdocker.com/docs/get-started/ to install vessel to a mock up Laravel project.  
After installing it, I've started it and i went to localhost, but it just gives me 403.

This is the output of ```./vessel logs app```:

## Description

It's currently not possible to init a Vapor project with the default Vessel docker setup.

The vapor init and deploy script needs node and npm inside the docker container.

Laravel 6 also needs by default php-redis but this is already fixed in the vessel patch-2.

I lost my commented line for alternative DB host :-(
I think it's better to replace active DB_HOST line only.
## Description
Laravel Dusk is the browser test suite using Chromium to make UI test automation.
Currently, Vessel doesn't support it. It would be a great addition !

I found a package that already use it for gitlab-ci here : https://hub.docker.com/r/chilio/laravel-dusk-ci

Thanks :-)

An optional option to optionally add your composer config, which will prevent the need from creating Github API access tokens when doing a lot of composer work.
You need to run the docker-compose with the -T to disable pseudo-tty allocation if you want to restore a mysql dump via piping it to the command.

(Maybe it could be just "restore" since we have "dump" already?)
