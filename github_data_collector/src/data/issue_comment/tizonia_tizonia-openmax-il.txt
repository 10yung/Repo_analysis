Hi All,

LOVE the software!!!!!

Wondering if we can get the ability to equilize or sound level the music across different tracks. I'm finding spotify streamed music is loud for some songs, others are quiet

Much appreciate regardless

Thanks!!

### Description

It would be nice to read `tizonia` help with `man tizonia` like other man pages. Everything in one page and render nicely in less pager based on the user man page settings.

### Installation Method Used

Should be packaged along with source.

### Additional Information

Man pages could possibly get input from command line.

### Description

I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature request, or if the Plex API even has the capability. I get an error when I try to search Plex using multiple "playlists" (e.g. artist AND album). The error message seems to indicate that this is expected behavior, but being a music player I would usually expect to be able to play a specific album by an artist, rather than ALL albums by that artist or ALL albums that have a specific keyword in them (e.g. tizonia --plex-audio-album "Ocean" brings up multiple albums by different artists).

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Attempt to run tizonia with more than one "playlist".
Example:
```tizonia --plex-audio-artist "Lady Antebellum" --plex-audio-album "Ocean"```

**Expected behavior:**

tizonia plays the album Ocean by Lady Antebellum.

**Actual behaviour:**

Error message:
```Only one playlist type must be specified.```

**Reproduces how often:** 100% of the time

### Versions

tizonia version: 0.19.0

Debug Info:
            * [Boost 1_62]
            * [TagLib 1.11.1]
            * [MediaInfoLib - v0.7.91]

OS version: Raspbian 9 (stretch)

### Installation Method Used

It was a long time ago so I don't remember but my bash history shows that I used the install.sh script.

### Additional Information

None.
### Description

I've been playing around with `v0.19.0` in a fork of the [`docker-tizonia`](https://github.com/tizonia/docker-tizonia) repo (find my fork linked below in Installation Method), and I've noticed an issue I suspect might be a problem with the main codebase.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Using `tizonia v0.19.0`, make a call which will give back non-ASCII characters. My test case for this is `tizonia --gmusic-unlimited-album Nivalis`, which will return the album Nivalis by the band √Årst√≠√∞ir.

**Expected behavior:** In previous versions, the software is able to convert some characters and ignore others, shown below (from `v0.18.0`):
```
   Arstiir : While This Way
     Album : Nivalis
     Year : 2018
     Duration : 3m:10s
     Track # : 1
     2 Ch, 44.1 KHz, 16:s:b 
```
Note the accentless `A` and the ignored `√∞`.

**Actual behaviour:** When running `v0.19.0`, I get the error message shown below:
```
[Google Play Music] (UnicodeEncodeError) : 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\xc1' in position 43: ordinal not in range(128)

tizonia exiting (OMX_ErrorInsufficientResources).

 [OMX.Aratelia.audio_source.http:port:0]
 [OMX_ErrorInsufficientResources]
```

**Reproduces how often:** 100% of the time when encountering these special characters in any way in the response from the remote service.

### Installation Method Used

This was from a [specific branch of my fork](https://github.com/matthewarmand/docker-tizonia/tree/python3-tiz19-upgrade) of `docker-tizonia` in which I was playing around with an upgrade of that project to Python3 and Tizonia 0.19.0.

### Additional Information

I wonder if its possible whether this is related to the Python3 upgrade, and if there are any notable differences in Unicode/ASCII parsing between Python 2.7 and 3.6. I haven't been able to find anything specific yet to that effect, but its possible.

It's yet still possible that its due to how I've configured the container; in which case this is more of a "how did i screw up" question.
### Description

Calling Tizonia from Crontab does not give any result

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Edit your Crontab with crontab -e
2. Add a Tizonia command to be reproduced at a certain time, this is what I've used for test (every minute):
* * * * * tizonia --spotify-playlist-id 1Sr0qSlojHmWQaP70ZqdK9
3. Wait till the end of the world, nothing happens üò≠

**Expected behavior:**
The playlist should start again every minute

**Actual behaviour:**
Nothing

**Reproduces how often:**
100%

I have solved all my issues running the app however i am trying to figure out how to control the app remotely via ssh. I have tizonia running on my headless raspberry pi inside a docker container which is connected to my speakers and i would like to be able to control it (mute, volume +/-, next track[n], previous [p]) by sending ssh commands. Does anyone have any idea on how this might be possible? I looked at xdotool and similar tools but i don't think this will work in this situation since i am running the pi headless with the desktop disabled. I am hoping to be able to use tasker on my phone to send ssh commands in a tasker shortcut i made to effectively turn my phone into a remote.
Steps on Ubuntu 18.04:

- tizonia-dev-build --deps
- sudo apt-get remove libspotify12 libspotify-dev
- tizonia-dev-build --no-player --debug --install --without-libspotify

Output:
```
checking for SPOTIFY... no
configure: error: Package requirements (libspotify >= 12.1.51) were not met:
No package 'libspotify' found
configure: error: ./configure failed for spotify_source
```

The second step is too simulate the fact that it seems that libspotify is not packaged in Fedora.
In any case it seems that `--without-libspotify` has regressed and does not work anymore.

We are trying to enable Tizonia https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-ci/issues/20 in the automated builds of gst-omx (GStreamer OpenMAX)
