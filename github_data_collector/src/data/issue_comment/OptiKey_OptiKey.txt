2. Uploade it to http://communikate.equalitytime.co.uk
3. Download .obz file  - https://designs.theopenvoicefactory.org/a0a0bf8720b438d78b9acb3518dd8c44/data/pageset.obz
4. Export into Optikey
5. open Kommunicate keyboard


# Any other information that helps to describe and/or reproduce the problem
Very strange is i have three pc's-  my dev pc and other two is used by my disabled child- home PC and MS Surface PRO for school. So, on my dev PC Kommunicate tables are showing images, but the button "Yes" still untranslated, but on child PC's no images for translated buttons and "Yes" is untranslated

1. Define 'SharedStyleGroups' for keys in the XML heading section with the override values I've added at the key level, and then each key can use the default style from settings, a 'SharedStyleGroup', or the individual overrides available today.
2. Define 'SharedTimeGroups' in the XML to enable overriding the default settings. This would be useful for the DynamicKeys. It would useful to have 'lock on time', 'activation time', and 'min time before key can be re-activated'.
3. A way to cancel a mouse action
# How OptiKey was being used

Optikey was set up with EyeX + left mouse click for trigger. EyeX was not connected, so I went to manual mode to demo Optikey to someone.

# What the user expected to happen

Mouse position used as input while in manual mode, and left click trigger should work

# What the user actually experienced

I keep getting the error "Uh-oh! I cannot detect where you are directing your attention..." and clicking on buttons doesn't work.

# Version
Windows 10
Optikey 2.31.0

# Steps to reproduce the issue
1. Set up with eyetracker + mouse trigger
2. Turn on manual mode.
 



A new key to translate and replace the scratchpad text.
Hi I'm a dental school student. I'm wondering about whether this software can be used for dental purpose.As I know, the dental procedure can sometimes be time-consuming and tedious, since the patients have to lie on the chair and cannot move for a long time which can last for hours sometimes. By using this software, patients can use their eyes to control the panel (which is above their heads) of the dental chair , so they can play games or select videos they want to watch during the whole procedure without the help from their dentists. 
I hope my issue can help you find more potential applications of this software.
Is there any limitation that prevent OptiKey from operating on the Secured Desktop screen? For example if the user runs an application as administrator, can OptiKey operate on the permission screen?

I have my keyboard running at a  pretty fast rate. Key fixation to lock on is 250 ms, and time to complete is 50 ms. With these settings I can get a nice typing rhythm.

One thing that I have been getting frustrated by is the behavior of the Ctrl, Alt, and Shift keys. I do like them to activate at the same speed as all my other keys, but it is sometimes challenging to get them into the state I want without accidentally double activating. I have a couple ideas to improve usability:

1. Timing: It would be nice if the initial time to activate was the same as text keys, but the time to switch on keylock was longer. Alternatively, add a setting so the key has an individual cool down period before it can be activated again.
2. Deactivation: It would be nice if the keys could be configured to remain in 'key down' state if a 'physical key' (home, end, arrows, etc...) is pressed and only automatically return to 'key up' state after pressing a 'text key' (letter or number).
3. Background color: It would be nice if the key background color would change when they are on because just changing the font color isn't always enough. When locked, a bigger bolder lock icon, or additional background color might also help.
This enhancement is to add two new features.
1. The ability to retrieve a value, such as the "Adjust by pixel" amount and display it in a key's label.
2. The ability to submit a change to a system setting, such as the "Adjust by pixel" amount.
