Hi,
Could you please provide a documentation how to run inference given the video as input? I saw the code, but couldn't figure out where to pass video file.
I assume we have the pre-train models.
How to make cnt_frm_sample.mat and cnt_frm.mat?I can't find the wrappers. @kezhang-cs 
We get pred and pred_k by the model, and then how to use these results to select keyframes？ @ @kezhang-cs 
I tried to get change points using KTS code.
But i couldn't get proper change points.

If someone get change points using KTS, please help me?

Hello！ I want to know how to put my video into the test. Do you need to generate a HDF5 file? How should I make it?
Why do we have negative values for pred and pred_k? Isnt frame level importance scores should be in range 0 to 1. 

Thanks
