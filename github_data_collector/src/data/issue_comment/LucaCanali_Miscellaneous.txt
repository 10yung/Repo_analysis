Hi

Thanks for your help in advance. I have read your notes in ( https://github.com/LucaCanali/Miscellaneous/blob/master/Spark_Notes/Spark_EventLog.md ) 
I want to aggregate all task metrics in every stage. For example, to sum all the tasks metrics (eg: Disk Bytes Spilled,Executor CPU Time,Executor Deserialize CPU Time,and Executor Deserialize Time )  

How can i do that using the spark logs?
