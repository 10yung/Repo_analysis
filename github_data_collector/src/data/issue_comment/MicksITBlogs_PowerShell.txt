Hi Mick,
1. Is it mandatory to put exclusion path to script. I don't have anything to exclude it for now but later on it could  be. Can I mark those lines as comment ?
2. Can I deploy script as baseline in sccm instead creating package ?

Note: I have deployed the script as Baseline in sccm but not getting compliance from Client. I have not mentioned correct path in exclusion variable in script.
