Hi, My name is shauyin.
I am working on bees. My bees are around 1000 and each video is around 3.5 GB, i wonder if  JAABA is possible for tracking bees and can also check multiple bees at the same time?
Can you please make some suggestions?
Thank you for replying
Best,

Hello everybody! I have a minor question: there is a feature on the PrepareJAABAData interface which I am not entirely sure what it is used for (see attached image). Would it be possible to use this "regions of interest" feature to limit a specific behavior to happen only inside a certain ROI? (e.g.: every time the mouse is inside the ROI, the assigned behavior is always "Investigating"). If not, what is this feature used for? I couldn't find any information about it on the JAABA website.

Thank you for your time!
Hi, 

I would like to use JAABA to assess mouse grooming behavior. 
In our lab we use the open source software Deeplabcut (DLC) for tracking of mouse body parts, and all the input data required by JAABA and prepared by PrepareJAABAData GUI can be extracted using DLC. 
I was wondering how it would be possible to create adequate input for JAABA manually - not using the GUI.
Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance,
Yara.
I already have tracking data and video frames labeled with behaviors. Could one use the program by using the inputs of tracking and behaviors rather than labeling the behaviors in the GUI?
The JAABAPlot window does not resize and can not be moved around when opened on a small screen like a laptop. This makes program unusable because the menu bar and experiments loading are not available to user. 

Is it possible to update the params file used by Eyrun's Fly Tracker? 

As seen in the [FAQ](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Tools/FlyTracker/FAQ.html), the last version is [here](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Tools/FlyTracker/download/featureConfigEyrun.xml). I can make a pull request with this change if you want.

Also, could we get a compiled JAABA version with these last modifications? Something like 0.6.1.

To adapt to multiple behavior jab files. Right now we only show the jab file names in the list, but it might be better to show individual behavior in the list in addition to the jab file names.

When an old score file being used as perframe feature is removed by the user, it gives an error.

Need to fix this.

JAABA is compatible but these two might also need updating.

- Start JAABA, 2014b
- kill "JAABA Open..." window
- File> New project
- input some stuff for a new proj
- Hit Done, get harderr, trace below
