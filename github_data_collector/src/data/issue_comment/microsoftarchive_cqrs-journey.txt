I could not access either the pdf or the samples on the msdn website

   https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj554200.aspx

The link to download the pdf takes me to a page on microsoft surface products and the link to the code samples does not find any webpage
Please fix the URL for downloading the reference source code in MSDN site:

I have created a new Conference and can view the conference on conference.web,public app
But when I go to Register/StartRegistration method, I am not able to see anything on the page

The StartRegistration method does not give me anything to register
Registration Type , Price , Available, Quantity

I don't have any item to register for....

When I am on conference.web.admin app

Following method returns orders variable as null.

``````
public ViewResult Orders()
        {
            var orders = this.Service.FindOrders(this.Conference.Id);

            return View(orders);
        }



```To summarise, I have just created a conference.
I haven't done any registration for orders and attendees.
I can see the conference and seat types but not anything in the registration tab.

There is nothing in the Orders table.
