Hello,
I just created an animation with facets using tmap. The frames are representing single timestamps. So far everything works fine. The only issue I couldnt solve is that each facet in each frame has an adapted colour scale range. I want to fix the colour scale range so that the values are visually comparable over time. By the way, I think this should be default with an option to set an argument "free.scales.fill.frames" = TRUE. Is that somehow possible? Or is there any work-around?
Thanks a lot!
Hi! 

When I try to modify a layer of county labels using tm_text, I am able to use the function in tmap_mode("plot")... but when I switch to "view" mode, the formatting of the text goes away.

Any ideas?

Thanks!
Adam
When saving a plot as pdf with tmap the result file does not keep the spatial information of the shapes or rasters used, is there a way to include it?.

Command used:
`tmap_save(m_map,"result_map.pdf")`

I also posted it on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59425832/export-geopdf-when-using-tmap-save). 
Hi,
I would like to have control of several overlays, with only one displayed at a time. We've done this in the past with raw leaflet/R - see [https://gntem2.github.io/Google-Map-to-Victorian-ECR-Hospitals
/R/three_hospital_models.html]. There will be other layers that can coexist. What is the correct way of placing layers into base groups vs overlay groups in tmap. In addition, is there a way of controlling initial choice of visible layers?

Thanks

Hi @mtennekes 

When I export an animation with `tmap_animation()` as an `mpg` there are some very noticeable compression artefacts. Is there a way to adjust the export quality or turn off compression? gif looks fine suggesting it's compression rather than a problem with shapefiles.

The attached screenshots show the problem (they've been scaled up but otherwise unadjusted).

Below is the relevant log file:

Hi! I was creating some maps with lines and text and I found this weird behaviour. The following should be a reprex of the problem. First I create some data with lines and text
``` r
# packages
library(sf)
#> Linking to GEOS 3.6.1, GDAL 2.2.3, PROJ 4.9.3
library(tmap)

# create some fake data
my_sfc <- st_sfc(
  st_linestring(matrix(c(0, -2, 0, -1, 0, 0), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)), 
  st_linestring(matrix(c(0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)), 
  st_linestring(matrix(c(-2, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)), 
  st_linestring(matrix(c(2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE))
)

my_sf <- st_sf(
  data.frame(my_text = c("1", "2", "3", "4")), 
  geometry = my_sfc
)
```
Then I create the map and everything is fine. 
```r
tm_shape(my_sf) + 
  tm_lines() + 
  tm_text("my_text", size = 2, along.lines = TRUE)
#> Warning: Currect projection of shape my_sf unknown. Long-lat (WGS84) is assumed.
```

The problems occur when I try to modify `xmod` and `ymod` to move the labels since, in this case, they do not preserve the `along.lines = TRUE` option.  
``` r

tm_shape(my_sf) + 
  tm_lines() + 
  tm_text(
    "my_text", 
    size = 2, 
    along.lines = TRUE, 
    xmod = c(1, 1, 0, 0), 
    ymod = c(0, 0, 1, 1)
  )
#> Warning: Currect projection of shape my_sf unknown. Long-lat (WGS84) is assumed.
```

Is this a bug? If not, is it possible to solve the problem? 
Thanks 
When using leaflet one can assign highlightOptions to the different layers to make them pop when hovering. Is there a way to achieve this with tmap?
I've seen this multiple times when trying to teach tmap (at least 4 times in the last few weeks). People have a lot of trouble remembering that the syntax is different -- tmap_ instead of tm_

It would be much better for usability if this function also started with "tm".
Apologies if there are good reasons this doesn't make sense, but I love the way `tmap` makes it easy to make thematic maps that mix raster and vector data (including support for `sf`) and very intrigued by a lot of the functionality of `stars` in working with rasters.  Is this in scope for support in `tmap`?  

Thanks for considering!


For a `'cont'` styled raster with custom breaks, label alignment is unexpected when using scientific notation with a fixed number of digits. This seems to be because the left-aligned string has leading white space. Is this intended, or was the intention for digits to just define the number of significant digits (in which case perhaps the white space should be stripped out)?

```R
library(raster)
library(tmap)

r <- raster::raster(matrix(runif(100, 0, 4.5), ncol=10))

tmap::tm_shape(r) + 
  tmap::tm_raster(style='cont', breaks=pretty(cellStats(r, range), n=7),
                  legend.is.portrait=FALSE,
                  legend.format=list(scientific=TRUE, digits=2)) +
  tmap::tm_layout(legend.outside=TRUE, 
                  legend.outside.position='bottom')
```
