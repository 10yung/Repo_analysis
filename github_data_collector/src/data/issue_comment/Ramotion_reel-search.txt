`let textColor: UIColor = .white
        let listBackgroundColor: UIColor = .blue
        let font: UIFont = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 18)
        
        ramReel.theme = RAMTheme(textColor: textColor, listBackgroundColor: listBackgroundColor, font: font)`

Useful when data changes and when you want to get textField events.
