Related with #85.

### Changes:
- Support for [APNS push type](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/sending_notification_requests_to_apns).

apns-push-type | (Required for watchOS 6 and later; recommended for macOS, iOS, tvOS, and iPadOS) The value of this header must accurately reflect the contents of your notificationâ€™s payload. If there is a mismatch, or if the header is missing on required systems, APNs may return an error, delay the delivery of the notification, or drop it altogether.
-- | --

- Update project to Xcode 11.

Add the ability to set `apns-push-type` and/or `apns-priority` header.

For example, in iOS 13 it is required to set `apns-push-type` to `background` if we want to use background remote notifications, otherwise notifications won't be delivered.

My initial idea for this would be something like a history drawer or similar, where you can "replay" a previously sent notification, and therefore have multiple of them alive at the same time.
Hi,
Apple supports JWT token authentication and I was wondering if there is a plan to add this to the Knuff app. If no, what would be the contribution guidelines?

cheers
`SecPKCS12Import` seems to auto import the identity to the keychain, therefore we should use `SecItemImport` instead.
