Not able to find that function
Observed on iOS 12.4.2 JGProgressHUD v2.1. If hideHUD() waits for async task to be finished and user leaves the viewController before (In my case I'm able to tap on "back" button on navigation bar), the JGProgressHUD isn't dismissed and blocks user from interaction with current screen. 
One solution is to call hideHUD()in viewWillDisappear() or viewDidDisappear(). But I believe this wasn't happening in previous versions of JGProgressHUD.
Please add a completion callback to dismiss functions, in order to avoid strange behaviour during dismissal animation.
It should be easier to interact with JGProgressHUD during UI tests. 

I added a very basic sample Swift UI test project and some basics `accessibilityIdentifier` to some relevant things of JGProgressHUD. 

It's just a basic proof of concept (I'm really not an expert of Objective-C) in order to make you understand the idea, I'm sure there is plenty of space for improvement.
Could you support dark by default

if the user turn Dark mode off the style be light
but when turn Dark mode on the style change to dark 
Trying to get this to work in SwiftUI is impossible - I have code that wraps it in a `UIView` that can be displayed in a `View`:
```
import SwiftUI
import UIKit
import JGProgressHUD

struct ProgressHUD: UIViewControllerRepresentable {
    
    
    func makeUIViewController(context: UIViewControllerRepresentableContext<ProgressHUD>) -> ProgressHUD.UIViewControllerType {
        let hud = JGProgressHUD(style: .dark)
        hud.textLabel.text = "Loading"
        hud.dismiss(afterDelay: 3.0)
        
        return hud
    }
    
    
    func updateUIViewController(_ uiViewController: ProgressHUD, context: UIViewControllerRepresentableContext<ProgressHUD>) {
        print("")
    }
}

```
If you could consider adding some basic SwiftUI compatibility that would be very much appreciated.
