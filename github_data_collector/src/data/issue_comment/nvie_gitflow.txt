Git management systems (github, gitlab, etc) often support referencing existing commits as part of issues, merges etc.

When finishing a feature it would be neat to get the commit hash of the created merge commit so you can share it easily with your peers.

### Proposal
```
Summary of actions:
- The feature branch 'feature/xyz' was merged into 'develop'
- The merging commit is f356242{...}5459702cf
- Feature branch 'feature/xyz' has been removed
- You are now on branch 'develop'
```


Is there any gitflow configuration file that can be shared, so that gitflow works the same way across all developers in a team.

There are several "ways" that gitflow works, that are against how you should work in a team.

Example:
* After you create a feature branch from develop and work on it... and you finish it... that should NEVER ALLOW that branch to be merged into develop locally and even more important... not on origin. That's why in the XXI century we have PR's.
* Should never allow under any kind of circumstance the deletion of branches (mainly origin) deleting on local should always be false (unless specified differently)

Is there any way to configure this by default?

Thanks

I have configured notepad++ through git bash and it used to work really well. But now since two days it says that notepad.exe not found.

Also, now since 5 minutes it says:
syntax error near unexpected token (' 
I am not being able to understand the problem
Just do these commands in your terminal:

```
git status
git add .
git status
git commit -m 'Commit typechanges'
```

It works well for me ;)

The following may be a Git Flow issue or a Git for Windows issue.  In addition to this ticket I also opened the following:

https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/2176

### **With the following environment:**

Git for Windows:

_git version 2.21.0.windows.1
cpu: x86_64
built from commit: 2481c4cbe949856f270a3ee80c802f5dd89381aa
sizeof-long: 4
sizeof-size_t: 8_

Windows Version:

$ cmd.exe /c ver
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]

### I have the following issue
$ git flow release start v12.12.12.0 8c165e101d7b2d8f8e7bd6f73edc9a56c3e9c4cf   
Fatal: Base '8c165e101d7b2d8f8e7bd6f73edc9a56c3e9c4cf' needs to be a branch. It 
does not exist and is required.

### Notes
This does not happen when using Git for Windows version 2.13.1.windows.2 or git for *nix 2.17.

The same issue happens when using SourceTool 3.1.2 (embedded or system).

The work around is to use the following raw command:

_git checkout -b release/12.12.12.0 8c165e101d7b2d8f8e7bd6f73edc9a56c3e9c4cf_

How about support `git flow release start` but with changes in the working tree? Will need to require that the commit is on the `develop` branch to avoid merge conflicts. See #32
