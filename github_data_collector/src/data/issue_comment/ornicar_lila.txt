Mod message presets are currently hardcoded in English. If they were translatable, it would increase the number of people who can understand the mod messages they receive.

Turns out the hi/gl/hf/u2/gg/wp/ty/gtg chat preset buttons are not translated.

If they were, it would allow people using different languages to communicate with each other in a nice and polite way.

It would really make my day and i know a lot more people would appreaciate this option too - since i am not a dev i have no clue if this is possible or how difficult it might be to implement?
Thanks for reading,

If a team systematically schedules future team battles, they are listed in the wrong order in the team page. Intuitively you would expect that the most recent event is at the top and as you go down the list you see events further away in time. However the ordering is the opposite of this, and if there are many events scheduled, the most recent ones, including the ongoing one are shifted out of visiblity. So you can join events weeks from now, but not aware of events starting within a few days, a few hours, or even the team battle in progress.
While private tournaments usually don't need action from moderators, there have been some big private tournaments recently with mass-reported chats. The chats of private tournaments are currently only visible to people in the tournament. Those reports seemed correct but we could not time out the offenders because we couldn't get into the tournament chat.

Based on uptime, does not appear to be near a restart.
It is contrary to the spirit of a team battle, that during team battle games, the team of the opponent is not shown.

Next to the opponent name show some abbreviation of the team name, with the color coding used in the tourney. Or at least color code the players name according to their team.
I don't know how to make a date input, and fix the layout.
I find the UX within the Stripe patron flow to be inconsistent.  I'd like to improve upon that, but before I put any time into it, I thought I would bring it here and see what others thought first.

When you first get to the Patron page, this is the version you see: ![Screenshot of Patron interface](https://i.imgur.com/yJVXI1e.png)  I believe this page has the best design between all of them.   For example, the success page you end up on after a successful payment looks like: ![Screenshot of Patron interface](https://i.imgur.com/OC8BTDW.png) (ignoring the content, which changes based on what you did), this page isn't very compelling. 

If you donate a one time payment your patron page will now look like this: ![Screenshot of Patron interface](https://i.imgur.com/aRvWC55.png)  While this looks good, it's not immediately obvious that the text in the green has switched out to say that you're a patron.  I suspect many people miss this on their first glance.  In addition, the `No ads, no subscriptions; but open source and passion` message is gone.  If you're back on this page, I feel like this message is still important.

If you donate a lifetime payment amount, your patron page will now look like this: ![Screenshot of Patron interface](https://i.imgur.com/Ghy9UNz.png) Again, the primary lifetime message has replaced the original ads/passion message. This time, the lifetime button changes colour, which is a nice touch, but is inconsistent with the monthly and one-time payment pages.

If you donate a monthly amount, your patron page will (by default) look like this: ![Screenshot of Patron interface](https://i.imgur.com/ewENCyZ.png)  This is completely different from the other pages. While it is better than the thank you page in terms of overall design details, I feel it is not as nice as the original page. Additionally, it will list the payments from your current subscription here, but none of your one-off payments or lifetime payments or payments from your previous monthly subscriptions are listed, which is confusing and in some ways disheartening. If you had been making a number of one-off payments and then were able to afford a monthly payment and switched, it feels like lichess has forgotten about your previous payments.  

If you click the "view other lichess patrons" or "make an additional donation now" then you end up back on the original page: ![Screenshot of Patron interface](https://i.imgur.com/yJVXI1e.png)  this time around though, the message in the green is back to the ads/passion one, (no indication of a monthly payment) and the tools in the middle also give you no indication of what your monthly payment is now.

There are also some other UX changes suggested in other tickets, like: #5856 which I also agree with. I also feel that we should be showing back to each patron their entire history of payments, if possible.  While I, personally, know that lichess appreciates every payment from every person no matter how frequent and no matter the amount, it would great it this UI reflected this sentiment in a consistent manner.

Utlimately - I'd like to see these changes:

- [ ] Consistent design for each page.
- [ ] Consistent messaging about what you are supporting regardless of what your status is
- [ ] Complete history of your patron activity.
- [ ] Clear and understandable way to change your current status to something else.
- [ ] Consistent and clear messaging about our appreciation for all of our patrons

I have some ideas kicking around in my head, but won't bother putting them here until I better understand whether this is important for me to spend my time on or not.
