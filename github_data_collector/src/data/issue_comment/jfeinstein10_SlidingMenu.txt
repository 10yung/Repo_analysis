Anybody help me please 
当左滑菜单出现的时候，想让右侧的小块内容页，出现黑色遮罩效果

Extending SlidingActivity uses SLIDING_WINDOW mode by default for the sliding menu. This causes the menu (and the rest of the activity) to overlap behind the navigation bar. Setting the mode to SLIDING_CONTENT is a workaround, but changes the style.

Does it work with Adobe Flash ? or do you have any suggestion on what coding might works on Adobe Flash ?
We did upgrade all our Android application and libraries to use Java 8 and API v25. The CustomViewAbove class uses a deprecated library FloatMath since API v23. 

The Android documentation suggest to use the library Math instead of FloatMath. We did correct this is our codebase. Along with the Gradle file to compile with Java 8 and use the latest API.

With that changes, the CustomViewAbove cannot be compiled. I suggest to use the Math library instead of the FloatMath library to support latest Android tools.

The exact line is CustomViewAbove line 303
I'm using
`menu.setMode(SlidingMenu.LEFT_RIGHT);`
` menu.setTouchModeAbove(SlidingMenu.TOUCHMODE_MARGIN);`
But i want to disable sliding only one menu(first or second). Not both of them(`menu.setSlidingEnabled(false);`)
Hi, and tnx a lot for your library.
i have problem really strange, that , when i open sliding menu , its look good, then when i close that, i can't scroll on list view, and it kind of stuck there, note that , if you act fast, while sliding menu closing, you can scoll it a bit , then it stock again.
any idea?
tnx
Can You tell me how to add fragments to the Sliding menu and switch between them. I have tried  whole day on this. I have also refered this <a href="http://androidgifts.com/android-sliding-menu-library-tutorial/">link </a>. But I can get where to add new fragments for the sliding menu items. 

In CustomViewAbove.java, line 300, 
`float distanceInfluenceForSnapDuration(float f) {
		f -= 0.5f; // center the values about 0.
		f *= 0.3f * Math.PI / 2.0f;
		return (float) FloatMath.sin(f);
	}`
"android.util.FloatMath is deprecated" and cannot reslove method sin(float).

I changed "FloatMath" to "Math" and it seems that I can run correctly.
