fix issue #233
Change from around_filter and before_filter to around_actiond and before_action to support Rails 5.

the erros on CI appear to be some deprecated things

obs.: until the maintainer accepts the PR people can use my branch on Rails 5: (https://github.com/cassianoblonski/render_sync/)
Why should plural, what if we want to use singular?

ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [GET] "/faye/faye.js")
 WHy ?????
@ajb I am missing partials intermittently and am trying to debug the cause. I am currently using Pusher with Render Sync, and am trying to get the connection states as stated in this document from Pusher: https://pusher.com/docs/client_api_guide/client_connect

Would someone be able to point me towards how to do this?
This happens when I try to start the Faye server with Rackup in development mode `-E development`. The problem itself is with the Faye gem (I think), but I just to understand a little better what happens when I select the different environments.

I tried to start with development mode because in production I use Pusher and I don't want to use an external API in development and test envs.

I was getting this error when I tried to push my app to Heroku.
I get the same error running on my machine too.
After some research I saw that the pusher gem isn't available outside the development of the gem.

I set an instance variable in my controller action to decide whether to hide/show some information in my sync partial.

I found that this instance variable is empty when sync_new is called elsewhere to append a new model to my table. How can I solve this issue?
Hi!

I added the include Sync::Actions in my form object class expecting to be able to use the Sync::Model.enable and saving my record. But I got this error: NameError (uninitialized constant Sync::Actions).

Any ideia what could it be?
Thanks, Paulo
