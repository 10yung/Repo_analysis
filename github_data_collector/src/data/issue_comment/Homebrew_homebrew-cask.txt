### Description of feature/enhancement

Following on from https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/72782#discussion_r356951390, where I already tried to implement something like this:
~~~ rb
if ARGV.include? 'upgrade'
    installer script: {
                        executable: "#{staged_path}/Backblaze Installer.app/Contents/MacOS/bzinstall_mate",
                        args:       ['-upgrade', 'bzdiy'],
                        sudo:       true,
                      }
else
  installer manual: 'Backblaze Installer.app'

  uninstall_postflight do
    bzpkg = '/Library/Backblaze.bzpkg'
    system_command '/bin/mv', args: [bzpkg, "#{Dir.home}/.Trash"], sudo: true if Dir.exist? bzpkg
  end
end
~~~
which did work perfectly, but was deemed too much of a "hack".

### Justification

Some casks would benefit from having a separate `upgrade` procedure from `install`. For example, in this case `brew cask upgrade backblaze` results in a reset of the previous backup state, triggering a whole new lengthy backup from scratch! Yet the app binary explicitly supplies an `-upgrade` argument, which could be utilised for a much smoother `upgrade` procedure.

Another example, which @vitorgalvao cited [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/72782#discussion_r351945906) is [lulu](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/lulu.rb) which removes the user configuration on `uninstall`, making `upgrade`s through Homebrew a pain.

### Example use case

Usage could look something like this:
~~~ rb
installer manual: 'Backblaze Installer.app'

upgrade do
  system_command "#{staged_path}/Backblaze Installer.app/Contents/MacOS/bzinstall_mate",
                 args: ['-upgrade', 'bzdiy'], sudo: true
end
~~~
Although, we would also need something like:
~~~ rb
upgrade trash: '/Library/Backblaze.bzpkg'
~~~
