Reference: [my comment in #253](https://github.com/diogobernardino/williamchart/issues/253#issuecomment-571149030)

I think it's a useful addition - my use-case was to redraw a chart when clicking on it with different data set. Unfortunately it wasn't fully possible before - `Renderer`classes had new data in `data` variables so chart was drawn correctly. Only x and y labels were not redrawn, so my commit fixes that.

I hope it will be useful and bug-free - I'm still kind of a programming newbie.

Would be nice to have different colors for bars in BarChart. (was possible in v2, right?)
Hi everyone
i wanna to show bar value top of every bar. is it possible?

Error at --> **This declaration is experimental and its usage should be marked with '@com.db.williamchart.view.ImplementsAlphaChart' or 'Use@Experimantal(com.db.williamchart.viewImplementsAlphaChart::class)'**

**val dcvReportChart: DonutChartView = layout.findViewById(R.id.dcvReportChart)**

here is my XML -->

 **<com.db.williamchart.view.DonutChartView
                android:id="@+id/dcvReportChart"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="match_parent"
                app:chart_donutBackgroundColor="@color/colorApp"
                app:chart_donutRoundCorners="true"
                app:chart_donutThickness="16dp"
                app:chart_donutTotal="200" />**

What I'm missing here? Can you please help?
FYI, I am using it inside a PageAdapter of ViewPager. But the Error is still if I use it any Fragment or Activity.

This has been [asked already](https://github.com/diogobernardino/WilliamChart/issues/206) for an older version of the library, but it doesn't seem to be possible with the new version anymore:

Can I display multiple lines (with different colors) in one chart? I didn't find a way to do it using `show()` or `animate`.
Currently the labels i get on the y-axis of e.g. a line chart are like 5.93333334. Is there a way to display values like 5.90‚Ç¨ there?
And thanks for the library!
Navigating away from an activity and returning yields the following crash. The chart is inside a RecyclerView, if that makes any difference.

Let me know if you need any more info üëç

Hello,

First of all, lovely library - Im super grateful for stumbling upon this! 

Everything works great, _with one minor caveat_: Whenever a `LineChartView` is inside a `HorizontalScrollView`, it always matches the parents height as a maximum, not making X-scrolling possible when using a wider dataset. 

Long term suggestion: Make the Y axis stick to the left edge of the chart, so that you can scroll through the lines while still seeing the axis values.

Short term: Just make it scrollable. Even if that means that the axis will disappear as you scroll far enough (at least this sounds okay in my mind).

Hope that makes sense :)

I have implemented a bar chart view with minimum border value as 60. So the graph starts displaying values starting from 60. Sometimes there can be situation where a the value can be zero.

`show(Animation().inSequence(.5f)` makes the above weird animation in sequence from start to end. Picture took while the animation happening.
