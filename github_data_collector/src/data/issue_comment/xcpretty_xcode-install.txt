With bundler 2.0.1 everything works fine.
Having Xcode 11.2.1 installed, by default simlators with iOS 13.2 are installed.

However, these are not listed in the `xcversion simulators` output:

Why is iOS 13 missing in the output?
Since fastlane/fastlane/pull/14509 was published in `2.120.0` we need the version to being able to use Spaceship with modern AppStore Connect API.
This version bump will prevent issues like fastlane/fastlane/issues/15671
I got crash during run: `xcversion install 11.2.1 --no-show-release-notes --no-ansi --no-progress` on Jenkins.

Exact command run is `xcversion install 10.3`

The command prints two lines after a while: 

/Applications/Xcode-10.3.app: valid on disk
/Applications/Xcode-10.3.app: satisfies its Designated Requirement

During this Xcode-10.3.app is in /Applications.

After the command completes however, Xcode-10.3.app is deleted from /Applications and xcversion list shows no installed versions. 
When you uninstall an xcode version and automate this behaviour you may end up in a lot of wasted disk space by having unavailable simulators installed.

As an easy first step we could simply delete unavailable simulators upon uninstall.

I initially ran xcversion install 6.3 and it looked like it installed xcode 6.3, but it disappeared from my applications, so I'm not sure if it's a spotlight issue, although I can't seem to find it on my machine. However, I need at least version 8+, but when I try to install any version now, including 6.3, I get the following error (and nothing changed to my knowledge):

$ xcversion install 8
```

Some potentially helpful info:

$ xcversion --version
`2.6.1`

$ ruby -v 
`ruby 2.6.5p114 (2019-10-01 revision 67812) [x86_64-darwin16]`

$ xcode-select -p 
`/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`

$ system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType

Restarting and running

$ xcversion 8 install

```

xip: error: The archive “Xcode_8.xip” does not come from Apple.
No `Xcode.app(or Xcode-beta.app)` found in XIP. Please remove /Users/OSx/Library/Caches/XcodeInstall/Xcode_8.xip if you suspect a corrupted download or run `xcversion update` to see if the version you tried to install has been pulled by Apple. If none of this is true, please open a new GH issue. 
```
However, it still randomly goes back to original undefined method 'match' error as above when run again. 

I've noticed the certificates for xcode < v9.2 are all expired since a few days ago for the .xip files, even downloaded directly from apple dev site. Not sure if there's a work around for this.
In order to reduce disk space we should delete all unavailable simulators once an xcode version gets uninstalled.

I also had this in mind to do for an install as maybe developers remove their Xcode versions via the Finder - but it violates the single responsibility principle I guess. What do you think?
There's very little to say, tried to download different versions recently and always get the same error after an hour or so... 🙁

```
