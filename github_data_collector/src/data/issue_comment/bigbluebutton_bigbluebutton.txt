I successfully installed bbb 2.2 html5 version on ubuntu 16. I also plan to install greenlight later. I want to convert my bbb website to android, ios and windows apps which can be uploaded on app stores and have native app features.

While searching for a solution, I found Phonegap and cordova. The best thing I found about phonegap is that it has a build tool where we upload the website and it converts into cross platform apps and its free.

Can I download and then upload my bbb website to phonegap build tool?

Have you people tried any of the tools out there?

Please share your experience.
**Describe the bug**
Reconnecting users are generating an `user left` message that removes the the registry of that registered user from it's meeting data. When the user finishes reconnecting, the `user joined` message received does not regenerate that registered user data so the meeting's users list gets an user and the meeting's registered users list gets none.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Monitor the registered user's list on bbb-web
2. Join an user
3. Force reconnect this user. On Firefox I did it setting the browser to work offline and setting online again
4. Watch the user being removed from the registered user's list and not being added again on the further rejoin

**Expected behavior**
I would expect the registered user's list to include all users that are in the meeting.
I'm using BBB 2.2.0-rc3 + Greenlight

It looks like if you know the recording URL you can access a conf room recording, without authentication, regardless of any Site settings. There is no way to restrict access to only authenticated BBB users.

So if the information inadvertently leaks because someone forwarded an email containing the recording URL by mistake there is no way to block the recipient from accessing the recording.

Ideally I'd like to specify exactly which users can access each recording. In the absence of that I'd like to restrict access to only authenticated BBB users. Is it possible to do either of these?

Mongod fails to start (EDIT SOLVED) and can't use Bigbluebutton (clicking inside Mattermost, JOIN MEETING is nor working 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Installed Mattermost on an Ubuntu server 16.04

Installed BigBlueButton plugin in Mattermost
Router forward port 80 and 443 to Caddy proxy. Caddy proxy to forward port 8065 (Mattermost) https://xxx.duckdns.org to the Ubuntu server

Hi pretty straight forward request. To make the minimise button transparent just like the full screen button. I tested `rgba(0,0,0,0.4)` and that works nicely, though I leave that up to someone more pro at UI/UX.

Here are some screenshots at different resolutions:

**Describe the bug**
Akka-apps marks a still valid registered user as invalid if a moderator takes his time to approve a guest user. This is due to incompatible timeouts.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Set bbb-web to ASK_MODERATOR guest policy
2. Join as moderator
3. Join as guest
4. Keep monitoring akka-apps logs
5. After 5 minutes https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/blob/b7ce8657aaaad8f26ad915a9e4344960ab87dd73/akka-bbb-apps/src/universal/conf/application.conf#L42 akka-apps flushes the guest's registered user
6. Moderator still can approve the guest and the guest is able to join (what looks risky)

**Expected behavior**
If akka-apps marks an user as a failed to join I would expect that he wouldn't be able to join after that.

Fixes #8203 .

This includes in `bbb-web` a monitor for the guests that are polling for their status.
 - If the waiting guest doesn't make a poll to the server for 15 seconds (guest page default is 5 seconds), `bbb-web` removes his registered user and sends a `GuestWaitingLeftMsg` to `akka-apps`.
 - `akka-apps` removes the user from the waiting guest list and from the registered users list and sends a `GuestWaitingLeftEvtMsg` for the clients to update.
I use Yandex.Browser, when i start room - BigBlueButton show me browserWarning about incompatibility with my browser. When i switch UserAgent to Chrome, for example, "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/77.0.3835.0 Safari/537.36" - all OK.

BigBlueButton version is 2.0.5. My UserAgent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/78.0.3904.108 YaBrowser/19.12.4.25 Yowser/2.5 Safari/537.36"

When BigBlueButton was 1.1, everything worked with this browser. The problem started after upgrading to 2.0.

Yandex.browser is the second most popular desktop browser in Russia (32% market share compared to Google Chrome, which has 40%)
My objective is replacing English audio system to Arabic. I have 4 wave sound but I could not replace the default audio system successfully. As I know "bigbluebutton" use Freeswitch to run sounds in virtual classroom.

I went to file location of the sounds which is mentioned in this xml file:
/opt/freeswitch/conf/autoload_configs/conference.conf.xml

Then I found the "muted" and "unmuted" sounds in this location
/opt/freeswitch/share/freeswitch/sounds/en/us/callie/conference

There are three folders I thought it's only bitrate issue. So, I replaced the following files:
conf-alone.wav
conf-unmuted.wav
conf-muted.wav
in those paths
/opt/freeswitch/share/freeswitch/sounds/en/us/callie/conference/48000
/opt/freeswitch/share/freeswitch/sounds/en/us/callie/conference/32000
/opt/freeswitch/share/freeswitch/sounds/en/us/callie/conference/16000
/opt/freeswitch/share/freeswitch/sounds/en/us/callie/conference/8000

After restarting "BBB" and greenlight, there is no sound anymore in conference room, neither  old or new ones.

Thanks
