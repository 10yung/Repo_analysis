The nodesource-release-el7-1.noarch.rpm package provides a repo for source rpms, but the base url value (https://rpm.nodesource.com/pub_10.x/el/7/SRPMS) returns a 404.
Hi,

Was wondering what it would take to build and provide IBM Power (ppc64le) RPM packages for nodesource here?
https://rpm.nodesource.com/pub_10.x/el/7/

Node is already well supported on Power and I can help with any changes needed to build scripts and such, please let me know.

Thanks and looking forward for your support!
The Node.js RPM appears to be configured such that requests made with the http2 module print noisy debug messages to standard error, and there is no way to suppress them.

I originally filed this bug as googleapis/nodejs-logging#668 the Google Cloud Node.js Logging module, which uses the http2 module under the hood.

**Steps to reproduce:**

Install Node.js 10.x on Centos 8 from the NodeSource repository (consider starting from a cleanroom environment like the `centos:centos8` dockerhub image):

```bash
$ curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash -
$ sudo yum install -y nodejs
```

*Note: this also reproduces on the 12.x stream.*

Run the following Node.js program from https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-logging/issues/668#issuecomment-572316853:

```javascript
const http2 = require('http2');
const client = http2.connect('https://www.google.com');
client.on('error', (err) => console.error(err));

const req = client.request({ ':path': '/' });

req.on('response', (headers, flags) => {
  for (const name in headers) {
    console.log(`${name}: ${headers[name]}`);
  }
});

req.setEncoding('utf8');
let data = '';
req.on('data', (chunk) => { data += chunk; });
req.on('end', () => {
  console.log(`\nReceived ${data.length} bytes of data.`);
  client.close();
});
req.end();
```

**Expected:** There should be nothing logged to standard error.

**Actual:** A lot of messages are printed, such as:

```

send: aob->item = (nil)

send: reset nghttp2_active_outbound_item
send: aob->item = (nil)
```
after install everything works fine except in the jailkit environment I get an error with npm

```
npm -v
node: ../deps/uv/src/unix/core.c:556: uv__close_nocheckstdio: Assertion `fd > -1' failed.
Aborted
```

this is my jailkit configuration file settings.. nano /etc/jailkit/jk_init.ini


```
[env]
comment = environment variables
executables = /usr/bin/env


[node]

executables = /usr/bin/npm, /usr/bin/node, /usr/bin/nodejs

```
According to the [`README.md`](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions):

> **Supported Ubuntu versions:**
> 
> NodeSource will maintain Ubuntu distributions in active support by Canonical, including LTS and the intermediate releases.
> 
> * **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS** (Trusty Tahr) - **not available for Node.js 10 and later**
> * **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS** (Xenial Xerus)
> * **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** (Bionic Beaver)
> * **Ubuntu 18.10** (Cosmic Cuttlefish)
> * **Ubuntu 19.04** (Disco Dingo)
> * **Ubuntu 19.10** (Eoan Ermine)

However, a `Release` file for Node 12 on Trusty Tahr exists: https://deb.nodesource.com/node_12.x/dists/trusty/Release

Is this intentional? What is the support status for Node 12 on Trusty Tahr? Will the `Release` file be purged at some point?
```

Error: 
 Problem: cannot install the best candidate for the job
  - nothing provides /usr/bin/python needed by nodejs-2:12.14.0-1nodesource.x86_64
  - nothing provides python >= 2.6 needed by nodejs-2:12.14.0-1nodesource.x86_64
(try to add '--skip-broken' to skip uninstallable packages or '--nobest' to use not only best candidate 
packages)
```


But in CentOS 8 there is no package provides /usr/bin/python - you can install different versions and create symlink.


So is only way to install nodejs 12 - use rpm without deps:
`rpm -i nodejs-12.14.0-1nodesource.x86_64.rpm  --nodeps`

Hey, I have a Debian 10.2 no DE machine and I need to install Node8 to get MineOS working. Problem is that I'm pretty sure it won't work. I already had Debian 10.1 installed two times and it didn't work. 

these are the commands I used:

`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | bash -
apt-get -y install nodejs`

node --version and I got 10.5. blah blah blah.

I got the commands from the official mineos wiki.

https://minecraft.codeemo.com/mineoswiki/index.php?title=MineOS-node_(apt-get)

If anyone knows a workaround to get node8 on Debian, please share your fix with me :(

I'm decently familiar with the Linux environment but I don't think I'm great at troubleshooting lol.

Have a great day!
We use `setup_11.x` on an Ubuntu 18.04 VM (hosted on Azure). When this machine deploys, we call the following code from a bash script:
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_11.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y install nodejs
```

Sometimes the first script fails with the following output
```

I am not sure the error is related to the `setup_11.x` script but any help is appreciated! Thanks
When I install nodejs on an debian system (debian 10, buster with sama3d35 processor) and I start node afterward, I got an illegal instruction immediately.
I tried with the official debian package (10.15.2~dfsg-2) and seval packages provided here (10.x, 13.x) and all show the identical behaviour. 

I found a issue for buildroot that may be related: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/28906

node --v8-options shows the following on the first two lines:
```
target arm v7 vfp3 hard
ARMv8=0 ARMv7=0 VFPv3=0 VFP32DREGS=0 NEON=0 SUDIV=0 USE_EABI_HARDFLOAT=1
```
When I start with gdb:

```
Program received signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.
0x010eb4e8 in _armv7_tick ()
(gdb) disassemble
Dump of assembler code for function _armv7_tick:
=> 0x010eb4e8 <+0>:     mrrc    15, 1, r0, r1, cr14
   0x010eb4ec <+4>:     bx      lr
End of assembler dump.

```
Unfortunately, I did not manage (yet) to build the debian package from source to check different compiler settings.
