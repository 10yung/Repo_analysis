Hello,

so far, I really enjoy working with GIFU. So, this is just a feature request and I don't know if it is even possible - but if it is, please add a way to compress a GIF before I e.g. upload it to my server.

Thanks!

My uicollectionview has a list of cells which contains images. When I scroll up and down, cells show duplicate images. I think it causes by cache. I tried to set imageview.image = nil before set imageview's image by url but it's not working. Please help!
Hi,
  When i Call stopAnimatingGIF() method the Gif Image is hidden.Any Solution For this ?  Please help
How is the completion handler parameter below intended to work?

`public func animate(withGIFNamed imageName: String, loopCount: Int = 0, completionHandler: (() -> Void)? = nil)`

Per the api docs it says:
`completionHandler | Completion callback function`

The issue is that the completion handler is fired immediately and not when the animations are finished. Seems that the completionHandler is being used by prepareForAnimation and therefore firing immediately. Is this by design?

I'm trying to compile my project after installing the pod on my Swift 4 project and get the following error: “Missing argument for parameter #1 in call”

<img width="1680" alt="screen shot 2019-02-04 at 1 23 15 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12003060/52199619-7abdd500-281b-11e9-9047-8af6e16337ae.png">

Any ideas on how I can troubleshoot this? Thank you!
It seems that `FrameStore. animatedFrames` is not thread safe, it will write in `preloadFrameQueue` and read in `main` queue. Is that right?
When installing Gifu version 3.2 using Cocoapods, it's not getting the latest revision which contains the swift version and the compiler thinks that the pod is on Swift 4.0 even though it's actually using 4.2 syntax. I think that you either need to bump the pod version or recut and tag a release that matches version 3.2 so the podspec is pointing to the latest commit.
If you turn on ThreadSanitizer and animate a gif, an access race is reported in `FrameStore.swift` at line 119.

The error summary is: `SUMMARY: ThreadSanitizer: Swift access race FrameStore.swift in _T04Gifu10FrameStoreC14animatedFramesSayAA08AnimatedB0VGvg`
Is it possible to change the speed of the gif?
Thanks
