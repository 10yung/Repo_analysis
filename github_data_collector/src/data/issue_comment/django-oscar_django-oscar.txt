### Issue Summary

The documentation for [migrating forked apps](https://django-oscar.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.4/releases/v2.0.html#migrating-forked-apps) from version 1.x to version 2.0 is incorrect. It states that the `name` attribute of the `AppConfig` subclass in `apps.py` should be renamed to `namespace` but this is not correct and, in fact, doing this means that the forked version of the app is no longer used.



### Issue Summary
When a `ProductAttribute` with type `boolean` is set to `required=True`, it requires any underlying`ProductAttributeValue` to be set to `True`, otherwise the Product you're trying to create/change won't save in the dashboard. I don't think the `required` field makes sense for a boolean field in this case. A Boolean field could still be `False` but be required to be filled in as `False`. It's all a bit confusing. 

It makes sense purely on a form, where you might need to check a checkbox to submit the form. But in this case it's a field in a database that's required. 

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to dashboard
1. On any `ProductType` defined, add an Attribute with type `True / False` and set the `Required` field to `True`.
1. Create a new product with this `ProductType` and set the attribute on the product to `False`

The dashboard interface says it's required to be set to `True` and as such the option for `False` is not possible.

### Proposed solution
Don't allow `ProductAttribute`'s with type `boolean` to be set to `required=True`.

### Technical details
I've tested this on an older Python version. But couldn't find any reference of a fix for this in the latest version.

* Python version: `2.7.17`
* Django version: `1.11.23`
* Oscar version: `1.6.7 `

Got error 500 when create voucher

<img width="844" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-09 at 9 37 03 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10126934/72033027-a49d3880-32c3-11ea-819e-cbc0c8a9bbde.png">

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create new voucher
2. Delete that voucher
3. Create voucher again with same **voucher name** deleted


Breadcrumbs for child products are not [properly generated](https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar/blob/master/src/oscar/templates/oscar/catalogue/detail.html#L24-L40) because the child product is not assigned to any categories. The template should use the parent product's categories if it is a child product.
### Issue Summary

Writing to products attributes with `product.attr` can lead to data loss

### Steps to Reproduce

Create a productclass with 3 attributes, the second one you create must be optional.
Create a product and do not fill the second optional attribute. Now write to the non-optional attributes with code like this:

        p = Product.objects.get(pk=4)
        p.attr.subtitle = "lama"
        p.attr.available = False
        p.attr.save()

One of the 2 attributes will not be updated because the attr object will not be intialized. During save it will encounter the second attribute which is not on the object and trigger initialization. Initialization will overwrite one of the 2 values written and reset it to whatever is in the database.

### Technical details

This problem occurs with all python versions and all oscar versions.
Leaving out child products from ranges causes offers to not work on child products.
Let's include them and make all products really mean all products.

### Issue Summary

I customized so many oscar's model. But when customizing PartnerAddress model, showing me an error called `cannot import name 'PartnerAddress' from 'oscar.apps.partner.models'`

### Code 
```
from oscar.apps.address.abstract_models import AbstractPartnerAddress

class PartnerAddress(AbstractPartnerAddress):
    pass

from oscar.apps.partner.models import *  # noqa isort:skip
```
### Technical details

* Python version: 3.7.4.
* Django version: 2.2.4.
* Oscar version: 2.0

# Issue Summary

![Screen Shot 2019-08-29 at 17 02 19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8855366/63931190-01b7f080-ca7f-11e9-8e34-d93f01c3d102.png)

2. Only 1 offer apply
![Screen Shot 2019-08-29 at 17 06 09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8855366/63931399-67a47800-ca7f-11e9-8989-988bd9cf5b05.png)

**Expected**
1. Should apply both offers if it does not exclusive.?

Note
I try to dig into the issue and  compare the load, I found out that, in condition.py they are some changed about is_satisfied like this image below

<img width="1606" alt="Screen Shot 2019-08-29 at 17 08 11" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8855366/63931528-a6d2c900-ca7f-11e9-8f08-24e6a7966516.png">

When I reverse code back it work like a charm, Any idea why you guy change that?

### Technical details

* Python version: 3.6.8
* Django version: 1.11.5
* Oscar version: 2.0.1.
