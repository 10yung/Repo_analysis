Hi!

I am using Ubuntu Classic Server 16.04.5 LTS for Raspberry Pi 3, on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, over SSH from a Linux Mint machine.

Trying to follow the Open VPN setup instructions, I am faced with the fact that I don't have the file/directory/function called openvpnsetup.sh in any directory.

Looking through the instructions, it seems that this file is supposed to be included when cloning the GitHub link. but I can't find it. With the instructed chmod command, I got the following message:

`sudo chmod +x openvpnsetup.sh`
chmod: cannot access 'openvpnsetup.sh': No such file or directory

How can I find this file?
I have modest skills--I created my Pi VPN by following directions, but that's my limit.  I can create multiple clients, but is there an advantage beyond security and putting all eggs in one pot?  Will multiple devices work on a single CA?  Slow things down?

As much a theoretical question as practical.
I want to get access through my Chromebook, which I often use while traveling.  It is unclear a relatively easy way to do this (I am well versed enough to follow directions to create the Pi VPN, but not much more).

Not your project, exactly, but this write-up shows you are someone who knows the ins-and-outs well.
I have tried making new client profiles using both `sudo ./setup.sh` and `sudo ./MakeOVPN.sh`.  My installation does not have the `./openvpnsetup.sh` file but instead just a  `./setup.sh` file. Does this make sense?

After running this `./setup.sh` file, things seems to install the same. However when attempting to make client profiles, I am unable to ignore/skip the remaining identification fields, so I just end up typing the same pass phrase for everything. Also, I haven't seen a prompt for the challenge field yet either. Despite these minor differences, the client creation menu acknowledges that I've successfully created a new user profile, and that it has moved its location to `/home/pi/ovpns`. However, these files are either never created, or not successfully moved into the target directory. Any insight would be appreciated!

Will the `wheezy` branch also work with `stretch`?

Or will you create a `stretch` branch soon?

Latest Raspbian as of this date comes with three openssl.cfg alternatives:
openssl-0.9.6.cfg
openssl-0.9.8.cfg
openssl-1.0.0.cfg

You have to rename the openssl-1.0.0.cfg to openssl.cfg to make the script work.
Hi,
I switched my internet access to a 4G router and Raspberry works now fine using a static address, which you can set up with some help from Raspberry users.
Now the problem is that OpenVPN-Setup generates an entry to enable firewall using eth0 instead of using wlan0 as in the guideline: http://readwrite.com/2014/04/10/raspberry-pi-vpn-tutorial-server-secure-web-browsing/
Now you just have to find this out manually and edit /etc/firewall-openvpn-rules.sh to enable wlan access. There should be an option to choose between Ethernet and wlan to automatically generate a proper firewall access.
Thanks!
