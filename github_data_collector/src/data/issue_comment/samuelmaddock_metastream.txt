https://plex.tv used to work fine for months but recently it has been not playing the added shows consistently. one or more of the room watchers will only get loaded the main dashboard of plex or the details page of the selected episode. This is very frustrating since Metastream is one of the best sync watching platforms since rabb.it shutdown. Please fix this soon :)

For the chrome engines, they media works, but because of vrv player, the media will be half the size of the screen still even with auto zoom and clicking full screen. A fix i found was using the extension Stylish and getting the Theater theme which blows up the default player which lets meta zoom in on it easier.



https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/metastream-remote/versions/ reportedly works with Firefox 48.0 and later however https://app.getmetastream.com/ *appears* to be incompatible with Waterfox Classic 2019.12. 

tl;dr historically, Waterfox 56.0 was based on Firefox 56.0.2. 

Can someone clarify the requirements for <https://app.getmetastream.com/>? Thanks. 
I use metastream all the time to listen to music with others as its the most efficient way to do it as most, if not a very big majority, of music can be accessed by YouTube specifically.  If it would be possible, either client-side or for the entire room to allow users with a slower connection to only load audio instead of both video and audio.

- Metastream Version: 0.6.1
- Browser + Version: Firefox 71, Chrome 78
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Add direct download link to a session.

Observe download save as dialog appearing in browser.

Fix:
Need to wait for whatwg/html#4293 to become a standard and be implemented into browsers.
In the mean time, it could be prevented by using an allow list of HTTP content types.

Any Mega videos being played will result in playing a blank, grey screen.

Hi guys,

I have a little problem with metastream, when I invite a friend to watch an anim√© if I don't talk on the chat everything is fine but when I send her a message on the chat she gets disconnected, do you have any solutions? 
I'd like to make a request to add an option to both hide the user list, and video bar, through the three vertical dots on the bottom right. You could for instance reduce the bottom bar to only the 3 vertical dots when you opt to hide it, and it would be very easy to pull it up again as the 3 dots will still be there. I am aware that the user list, bottom bar, and playlist disappear when your mouse doesn't move for a couple of seconds but I personally still find it bothersome when you accidentally make all of them show again because you accidentally moved your mouse
