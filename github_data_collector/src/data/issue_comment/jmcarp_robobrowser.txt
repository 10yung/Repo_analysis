The `follow_link(value=None, *args, **kwargs)` documentation notes are incorrect.

On https://robobrowser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html, the method description reads 

> Find a click a link by tag, pattern, and/or BeautifulSoup arguments.

Which appears to pertain to `find()` or `find_all()` Should just be 

>click a link
Is it possible to force the RoboBrowser instance to reload a page?

In my use case, I'm waiting for a download to finish before scanning for hrefs to follow, but the `parsed()` method doesn't appear to update as the page loads â€“ e.g. it's forever stuck at 0% downloading even though the expected wait time is 30s.  If I refresh the page mid-download (manually), it doesn't interrupt the download progress.  My guess is that `parsed()` references a snapshot of sorts taken once when a page loads, and further invocations reference that snapshot instead of the live HTML?

I've tried invoking the `open()` method again, but that seems to create a new "window" of sorts, losing all the download progress... 

Thanks!  
It seemed to be treating this as a normal input type when it should be treated as like a submit button.

There is also the slight change when it serializes from just a single field and value to two fields appropriately named with the x, y values of where on the image the user clicked.

Currently, I am not handling there being different x and y values, simply just creating two new fields with `.x` and `.y` appended to the name.

Robobrowser object have args [tries, delay, multiplier], but delay is disappear in __init__ function, and multiplier default is None. Multiplier is Urllib3's backoff_factor, default is 0. This change make a error:
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'NoneType' and 'int'

I get from the Readme how to set a checkbox, but I cannot see how to remove one if it is already checked.

The form I am working with can change which fields are checked based on whether someone else has logged in and manually chosen some fields. 

So from my code I need to specify which fields are set when submitting the form. Is this possible?
The [`<input type="image" />` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/image) was not yet supported. 

I've ignored nameless elements for now (technically it is permitted to omit the `name` attribute, at which point only `x` and `y` values are submitted).
Hi, 
I have this issue. I am trying to fill forms of this website using robobrowser. My code in python is below:
```
new_CRTS_DR3_beta_url = 'http://crts.iucaa.in/CRTS/'
browser = RoboBrowser()
browser.open(new_CRTS_DR3_beta_url)
form = browser.get_form(action='/CRTS/imaging')
form['query_input'].value = '332.64277 -22.66323' 
form['radius'].value = '0.1'
```
However, 'query_input' does not have the attribute value before I fill the input, and when the input is filled the attribute value appears and is set with the input value. The HTML code looks like:
- Before when it is empty:
```
 <input class="form-control input-sm" type="hidden" id="query_input" 
name="query_input">
```
- After setting an input: 
```
<input class="form-control input-sm" type="hidden" id="query_input" name="query_input" value="332.64277,-22.66323">
```
Thank you for any help!

Hi, 

Not an issue per se, just wondering the status of the project...
Can I make screenshots webpages?
