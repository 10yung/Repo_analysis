Most western languages are read from left to right, however some languages (Persian, Arabic...) are read from right to left, which impact how they should be displayed. I would find useful if this crate could, in addition to detect languages, map a Language or a Script to the direction it should be displayed (which could be a simple enum `Direction::Ltr` or `Direction::Rtl` for instance)
It would be interesting to know how this library compares to cld2 https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2.
