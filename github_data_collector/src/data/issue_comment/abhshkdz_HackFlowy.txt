Thank you for providing us a such great tool! In order to contribute, I found a couple of bugs in the views/task:

1. the List's get method is not finding new elements (f.i. pageView.collection.get(prevSibId) ). By switching it by a filter on the array solved the issue ( f.i. pageView.collection.models.filter( (node) => node.id == prevSibId )[0].view );

2. In the addNote method, the blur occurs after the new task is inserted, making the previous item to be set as empty. By positioning the blur before the new note fixed the problem.

Hope this helps!

For example using ipfs (e.g. saving to ipfs and then returning a hash so you can continue working on it, also maybe enabling p2p collab editing...)
When I hold shift, WorkFlowy permits to select several blocks at once, but HackFlowy moves the selection over to another line.
After folding a list item when someone hovers over that folded item, the hover option which have complete[or uncomplete] etc, the `fold` option must convert to `unfold` option.
I setuped test heroku instance
Each time I load it - I get items in random order

if you select item, click on tab, than on shift+tab - it doesnt moved to the previous position, byut placed above it

Also tab not always works. After some time it just stop moving items or can move it in the invalid location (2 levels at once)
