Hi Alamot,

This commit adds a download functionality to `mssql_shell.py`.

The function uses the `certutil` utility to base64 encode, in a temporary file in `%TEMP%`, the file in order to download files with non printable characters. After download, the temporary file is automatically deleted.

The overall process is (very) slow, I would say around 1MB/minute. This is mostly due to the fact that the base64 encoded file content needs to be retrieved through a `type`.  

Tested on the `hackthebox` machine that originally inspired your script ;) 

Best regards,
Qazeer.
