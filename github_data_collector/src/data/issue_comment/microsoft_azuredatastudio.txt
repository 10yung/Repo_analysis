- Azure Data Studio Version:

Steps to Reproduce:



Users who are authoring a Book in ADS will be editing the toc.yml in the book. ADS books section does not reflect the changes until the ADS is relaunched. This will slow down the authoring experience.

This makes it so a validation error message now can show when input box validation is false. Previously in the dacpac wizard, invalid file names would just disable the Next button but no message would show why.

This also adds validation in the dacpac wizard to check if database names are unique when deploying dacpacs and importing bacpacs. Fixes #8124.

Still shows default message when inputbox is empty:

The changes included incorporates some cleaning up as well as a fix for the issue.

Here are the primary changes listed:
1. On Line 378 in editdatagridpanel.ts: changed the formatter in the columnDefinitions to use a custom formatter, instead of one in tables.
2. On Line 175 and 918: NULL needs to be used to indicate a null row as the loading of cell values is handled primarily by slick.grid api which only recognizes NULL as empty and not undefined.
3. slick.grid api is called first when a cell is clicked and loads the value in before it can be processed by the main code. The code cannot determine whether a cell has been changed or not because of this.
4. Some cleanup changes specified in #8363
