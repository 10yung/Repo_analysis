From https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/blob/master/docs/usage.md:

> * `lang` - The locale these tags are marked up in. Of the format `language_TERRITORY`. Default is `en_US`.

Whatever `lang` is set to seems to be used both for the `lang` attribute in the `html` tag as well as for the `og:locale` property. 
HTML's `lang` should adhere to [ISO 639-1](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) (that is, language only) but `og:locale` should be on the [`language_TERRITORY` format](https://ogp.me/).

Suggestion: Add `locale` config setting and use that for `og:locale`. Use `lang` setting only for HTML's `lang`.
When choosing for the Organization it add's headline and publisher and are not allowed.
Been knee deep with a i18n project, and this plugin does not work well with page title tags (maybe other elements too, haven't investigated.) 

The `jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin` [1] works by changing the title frontmatter to refer to separate language files placed in `i18n/language-name/posts/blog.md` where the actual translated text lives. As such:

```
---
title: posts.blog.title
subtitle: posts.blog.subtitle
---

{% tf posts/blog.md %}
```

The end result is translated files, but bad seo, as titles are being outputted as a literal `posts.blog.title`.

Now I am willing to look into this plugin and figure out how to do it and then do a PR, but I am not the most well-versed in Ruby. Any pointers or help would be highly appreciated.

[1] [Jekyll Multiple Languages Plugin](https://github.com/kurtsson/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin)

Hello, maintainers! :wave:

By my calculations, it's time for a new release of jekyll-seo-tag. It's been over 2 months since the last release, v2.6.1.

What else is left to be done before a new release can be made? Please make sure to update History.markdown too if it's not already updated.

Thanks! :revolving_hearts: :sparkles:

I have pricing pages e.g. /pricing (USD), /pricing/usd, /pricing/eur, etc. Instead of baking the site base_url into the `canonical_url` setting, it would be better if there were instead an option to override just the canonical path.
@mike-ward posted in this issue https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/issues/120 a while back, but the issue has since been closed without a resolution.  His original post:

I had this same need.  Here's how I solved it:

In the `<head>`...`</head>`:

```
{%- seo title=false -%}

<title>
    {% if page.title-tag %}
      {{ page.title-tag }}
    {% else %}
      {{ page.title }} | {{ site.title }}
    {% endif %}
</title>
```

With that in place, I can define a fully custom title tag on a per-page basis that is different from the page's title and description attributes by using this front matter:

```
title-tag: "My custom title tag text here"
```

If `title-tag` is not defined, then the page will fallback to this format:

```
Page Title | Site Title
```

Hope that helps :) 
Is there a simple way to get the plugin to recognize a blog post image?
Hi!

Is it possible to disable the Schema.org JSON-LD output globally or on a per-page basis? Our product pages are shown as BlogPosts instead of a Product.

Thoughts? 

BR,

I've removed the `<meta name="author" />` tag from `template.html`

The reasons are is that this specific `meta` tag has been dropped back in 2014.
The correct way to use the `authorship` tag is through the `rel="author"` tag,

Example:
```
<a href="/authorname/archive" rel="author">Author Name</a>
```

However,  the `meta name="author"` is primarily used as `citation`
```
<meta name="citation_title" content="Crystal structure of squid rhodopsin" />
<meta name="citation_publication_date" content="1999" />
<meta name="citation_author" content="Murakami, Midori" />
<meta name="citation_author" content="Kouyama, Tsutomu" />
<meta name="citation_pdf_url" content="crist_struct.pdf" />
```

It seems almost every time I `jekyll build`, the JSON-LD output appears to have changed when it hasn't.

I use a git-based deployment and it'd be nice to not have every page on the site change for every build to make it easier to review beforehand or afterwards, as well as for size of the repository over time.

I suspect the issue is with the key order not being deterministic. Would you be open to a pull request that makes this deterministic?
