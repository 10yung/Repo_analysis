Facebook is rolling out a new frontend at some point soon. Most likely this will break certain parts of the tool, which will need to be rewritten to work with the new site, or some way to force the use of the existing mobile version of the site.
- [ ] Chromedriver version should be configurable
- [ ] If downloading, the location should be configurable and use a sensible default (maybe `~/.cache` on *nix systems)
- [ ] Consider shipping chromedriver binary with the pip package data. It won't be platform independent however so that would probably require shipping different builds for different platforms (not really something I want to do at this point)
While I was working on a bug, I noticed that once a user is logged in, we check to see if the current url is `https://www.facebook.com/` and if it is not we block the execution until the user manualy navigates to `https://www.facebook.com/`. My suggestion would be we atleast try to do it for the user and if we fail after a retry we can ask the user to manually navigate to the URL.

#### Here is how I have done it on my branch.
If it is a feature we would love to have, I can create a PR for it. cc @weskerfoot

We already know Facebook employs counter measures while deleting posts indiscriminately (#39), but I am confident that it's not limited just to changing the layouts. Facebook actually hides individual posts at random(or with some pattern) while deleting linearly.

I had successfully deleted thousands of posts (partially using this tool & manually). Though it looked like I have deleted all the posts, every couple of months some random post becomes visible in my profile.

The likely reason is that the post was hidden from me when I was deleting (or) the worst case scenario is Facebook didn't delete the post when I deleted them although this is unlikely.

So incase you have deleted your posts, do visit your profile once in a while to see whether this is happening.
When I pass the parameter "-M comments" it logs me in but as soon as it navigates to the comments it just stops and closes chrome. Should deleting comments work or is it still a work in progress?
Thanks
Can the script be altered to go to https://www.facebook.com/USERNAME/allactivity instead and delete everything from there, or if not everything, then filter what can be deleted from the activity log? In my view, this is a much better place to delete FB content a user has posted on his/her wall, or commented on and liked than by doing it through the Wall.

Probably better than the current manual method
I have a Bio update that can not be deleted, so the script hang on the page, waiting for nothing and can not go further.
The big downside of Facebook official archive feature is that they provide to you only your content. So when you make a post and others comment on it, you do not get those comments (and likes) saved.

This tool could be better and save in JSON also all comments you got on your posts, before deleting them.
I have many posts with links to YouTube and stuff like that. In the archive content for those posts is simply empty. It would be great if archive would preserve those links and save them in JSON.
