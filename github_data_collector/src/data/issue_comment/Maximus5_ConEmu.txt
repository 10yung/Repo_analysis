### Versions

ConEmu build: 191012 x64
OS version: Windows 10 1903 x64
Used shell version (Far Manager, git-bash, cmd, powershell, cygwin, whatever): bash on MSYS2


### Problem description
When ```bash.exe``` is run through the MSYS2 connector, I get this warning: "bash.exe: warning: could not find /tmp, please create!". Running it without the connector is fine. It worked before on Windows 7, and I just did a clean install of Windows 10 and MSYS2.


### Steps to reproduce

1. Refresh default task
2. Run bash through default task
3. 


### Actual results
Warning: "bash.exe: warning: could not find /tmp, please create!"


### Expected results
Proper bash prompt with logged in user

I prefer making fonts bold or italic based on their background color, and keep terminal 16 colors only. Sadly only there's only one option, allowing to remap 1 background color, when there are 16 bg-colors available. How about adding more same options there?
I'm not sure if this is a bug or something I'm pressing. Every hour or so CMDER seems to go into a weird shortcut mode. Half the keys I press no longer type the character, they start opening windows. 

e.g. the A key opens up a "Set active processes affinity and priority" window like below..

Is this something I'm doing wrong?
Console scans are processed usually by blocks or rows sequentially.
Probably with sort of thread pool ConEmuC may do the work faster.
But it depends... will parallel calls be processed seamless by the kernel?
### Versions

ConEmu build: 191012 x32/x64
OS version: Windows 10 Pro x64, Server 2016
Used shell version (Far Manager, git-bash, cmd, powershell, cygwin, whatever): cmd, Far

### Problem description

You can run new console (create new tab) as another user.
You can run new console (create new tab) with elevated privileges (run as administrator).
But not both at the same time.

### Steps to reproduce

(ConEmu just unpacked and have clear config.)
1. Launch ConEmu: cmd tab is opened.
2. Shift-Win-W: "Create new console" is opened.
3. Alt-R: "Run as administrator" is checked.
4. Alt-A, input credentials of another admin account, "Start"

### Actual results

New cmd tab is opened with current user account and elevated privileges.

If not check "Run as administrator", then new cmd tab is opened with another admin account and without elevated privileges.

If firstly input credentials of another admin account, and afterward check "Run as administrator", then radiobuttons auto switch to "Run as current user".

Elevation of privileges can be tested:
1) Environment variable ConEmuIsAdmin must be set.
2) openfiles command closed without error "not have administrative privileges".

### Expected results

New cmd tab is opened with another user account and elevated privileges.

### Versions

ConEmu build: 191012 x64
OS version: Windows 10 LTSC x64
Used shell version (Far Manager, git-bash, cmd, powershell, cygwin, whatever):  git-bash

### Problem description

How can I use single quotes, as well as git-bash when I drag a file to the window?

### Steps to reproduce

1.  drop file

### Actual results

file\ name\ v2.exe

### Expected results

'file name v2.exe'

Apologies if this topic has already been raised, I searched but didn't find anything. Is it possible to disable the history of opened console windows? Obviously there's a "clear history" button but I'd rather just not have a history at all rather than regularly clearing it. Can't find anything in the settings for this but I assumed I'm just missing something. 
On Windows 10 1909 64bit, ConEmu 191012 Preview and Vim 8.1.2424 from https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer with shell `cmd.exe`, start
```
vim --clean
```
Then start a command line program with output to stdout, such as `:!help echo`.
It produces no output.

If instead
```
vim -n -u ~\.vim\viminrc
```
with `viminrc` reading, as suggested at <http://conemu.github.io/en/VimXterm.html>,
```vim
set term=xterm
```
then there is an output, but `ConEmu` does not show the stdout of Vim, while stdin is still received. 

There are similar issues, such as https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/116 and https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/320 .

As a side note, the Windows Terminal handles this fine; perhaps its [source](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) helps to find out why.

Used shell version: PowerShell, 5.1.17763.316

### Problem description
Good afternoon

Sometimes, users report that not all characters are inserted when they paste the Clipboard.
Now, I can reproduce one situation very easily:

### Steps to reproduce

1. The ClipBoard Text has the special character **¬**: `c:\Data\IT¬Scripts\`
2. Keyboard Layout: **Swiss German**
3. Pasting does remove the ¬ character, result: `c:\Data\ITScripts\`
4. Keyboard Layout: **German**
5. Paste works:, result: `c:\Data\IT¬Scripts\`

**Maybe Important:** Pasting into the Windows default Powershell console always works as expected, for all keyboard layouts.

### Actual results

Depending on the active keyboard layout, some characters are filtered while pasting text from the clipboard.

### Expected results

Independent of the keyboard layout, pasting the clipboard does never lose any characters.

### Additional files

I guess, it is not necessary because it depends on the Keyboard Layout.
