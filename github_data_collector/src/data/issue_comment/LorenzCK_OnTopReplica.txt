I want to use this program because it's supposed to be better then picture in picture mod. But if I use web-page tab and there is a video, if I minimize the video it will not be playing for me. The picture will basically froze.  

Same goes for picture-in-picture mod. If apply p-i-p video first of all I will have 2 versions of this page, then p-i-p will be on top of every app and at last only your app will be able to click through. 

PS why every time when I minimize apps I have to apply "click through option" on your app?
After enabling Advanced -> Click Forwarding, 
Whenever I click on the ontopreplica window, nothing happens, and my ongoing application is deselected and ontopreplica window comes into focus.
couldn't find where to submit feature requests, 

It would be cool if we could choose a color to key out (make transparent) much like the "color key" filter in OBS studio. 

so for example, If were watching some numbers, I could select the region around my numbers, then key out the background. Then my window just shows the numbers, rather than a black rectangle with numbers. so it would like like the images attached for example.

It's bugged somehow and OTR window moved outside of visible display area.
I tried:
- reinstall
- delete registry
- use keys alt+space+m to get "move" menu called
- use keys winKey+arrows
- switch display to portrait mode
- turn on/off display
- turn on/off second display

nothing helps.
As it is now, ontop replica will not overlay when non windowed fullscreen games are playing.

Click-through is set, but sometimes I will click the taskbar item incorrectly. I need reset the click-through again.
I hope that add the function about tray display, and hide the item on the taskbar.
I was seeing if it was possible to get this to work in fullscreen and I saw you said this about it.

"This is probably much harder than it looks like, since Window's windowing manager does not work as usual when another application takes over in fullscreen mode. I will look into it however, I understand it is a very useful use-case."

I just wanted to mention that there was an experimental firefox feature that I don't think got added called min-vid. I used to use it a lot and it would work in fullscreen. Just putting this out there so maybe you can look into it.
Hey just as the title says does anyone know the command line arguments to open a specific window?



This tool is very useful in videogames such as Overwatch, whose doesn't allow the user to modify the UI.
I was wondering if is doable to make the region selection less limited to a single rectangle, but on multiple rectangles.

Let me attach an image to illustrate:

Thanks! And good work!
