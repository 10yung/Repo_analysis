I am not getting TLS 1.2 connection from my ssl.com certificates.
Does the current version in it's minimal support cover TLS 1.2? 

If, after an SSL_read operation, there is still data pending in
the SSL layer (such as the remainder of a TLS record), we need
to simulate an EV_READ event on the watcher. OpenSSL won't attempt
to read the data from the underlying socket until this data is
consumed. Since there is no new activity on the socket, libev will
not trigger a new EV_READ notification.

This just happened to work with the large () buffers passed to
SSL_read from the ringbuffer. However, when adjusting these buffers,
it becomes increasingly likely to deadlock a socket by leaving
this pending data in the OpenSSL buffers.

...on on redhat derivatives that put libev in its own subdir. does not affect compilation on debian derivatives.

The mode should display to _stdout/stderr_ (and/or syslog if the _-s_ option was invoked) more detailed information about the inner workings - e.g., "Connection established with client _w.x.y.z_", "Start handshake with _w.x.y.z_", "Handshake successful with _w.x.y.z_" - perhaps even the SSL handshake details (ciphers, key exchange, etc.).. For a really flexible logging configuration perhaps something like SSH's "-v", "-vv", "-vvv" configuration will do.

When you run stud with --daemon and --chroot, it tries to reopen stdin as /dev/null after doing the chroot, which returns an ENOENT.

I see in the Makefile that there is a switch expected for 

ifeq ($(STUD_FIPS_MODE),1)

However, there is no configure script where I would give a flag for FIPS mode, the README makes no mention of how to enable FIPS mode, and I need to use a static library to get a write-off on FIPS 140-2 OpenSSL for government use. 

I am just going to modify the Makefile to temporarily assume its built and ready and declare a build directory for FIPS-2.0

Are you planning on modifying the build process to allow for alternate static FIPS implementations? True FIPS builds cannot change the directory (and with FIPS-2.0 you dont declare to build the fipscanister any longer).
