### SPECIFIC ISSUE ENCOUNTERED
when launching magic window mode as recommended in the google vr developer website, the magic window launches with an offset. Of course I can swipe the screen to recenter, but I can't figure out how to get it to launch straight from the beginning. I assume it has something to do with the global gyro coordinates, but not sure.

### SPECIFIC ISSUE ENCOUNTERED
The controller for the cardboard view works really well for looking around, but not all of my users will have a cardboard. Is there a way to turn off the cardboard view that uses 2 eyes (cameras), so that the controller can be used for looking around with just a single camera as a handheld device completely? (I believe it is called magic window)

setting `XRSettings.enable = false` will get rid of the overlay and double eyes view. however the overlay will still be shown for a couple of seconds when starting up, before you can set that setting to false. Can it be suppressed completely? 

### HARDWARE/SOFTWARE VERSIONS
- Unity: 2019.1.8
- Google VR SDK for Unity: v1.200.1

### ERROR ENCOUNTERED
There is a weird glitch that distorts the image of the app when it's built with the Universal Rendering Pipeline.

### DETAILS
- Unity: 2019.3.0b7
- Google VR SDK for Unity: v1.200.1
- Target OS: Android

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE THE ISSUE
 1. Download the URP from the Package Manager
 2. Install and update the project's materials
 3. Go to the Project settings and set the Stereo Rendering Mode to single pass.
 4. Enable Post processing to the camera.
 5.  Build and run the app
 6. Install the app
 7. Run the app on the phone

Here's the result:

Can't confirm if it's something from the Pipeline, the SDK or the editor. If anyone has an answer, please let me know.


### ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
I tested it on a Samsung Galaxy S7. Not sure if it also happens to other devices.
Here are my Project settings on detail:

Yes, i lowered some graphic aspects on purpose to reduce heating.
### SPECIFIC ISSUE ENCOUNTERED
http://www.jaguar.com.co/web/unity_googlevr/unity_google_vr_unaligned_aspect_ratio%202.1.jpeg

The depicted issue in the JPG of the link above occurs in a Xiaomi mi8 with 1080x2280 screen resolution and 2.1111 aspect ratio. It doesn't happen in a normal 1.777 aspect ratio mobile 1920x1080 screen. As you can see, it shows aproximately 7% of the video image outside the stereo mask (3.5% on each side), and the white vertical mark unaligned.

It also occurs on a Xiaomi mi 9 with display size of 1080x2340 px

### HARDWARE/SOFTWARE VERSIONS
- Unity: **2019.02.f1**
- Google VR SDK for Unity: **1.18.4**
- Device manufacturer, model, and O/S: **Xiaomi Mi 8 Lite / Android 9 PKQ1.181007.001**
- Device fingerprint: **Xiaomi/platina/platina:9/PKQ1.181007.001/V10.3.5.0.PDTMIXM:user/release-keys**

- Device display metrics:  **Physical size: 1080x2280 / Physical density: 440**
The command `adb shell dumpsys display | grep mBaseDisplayInfo` returns the error "'grep' is not recognized as an internal or external command", so I used "adb shell wm size" and "adb shell wm density"

- Google VR Services: **???**
The requested command: `adb shell pm dump com.google.vr.vrcore | findstr /i "packages: versionName"` returns the error "'findstr' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file".

- Viewer manufacturer & model: **Xiaomi Mi 8 Lite / Xiaomi Mi 9**
- Link to Unity project that reproduces the issue: 
The Unity project http://www.jaguar.com.co/web/unity_googlevr/baq360.zip
The APK http://www.jaguar.com.co/web/unity_googlevr/baq360_aspect_ratio.apk

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE THE ISSUE
Having previously added the "Cardboard" VR SDK at the "XR Settings" of Unity "Player Settings" I turn on the Cardboard mode through the code:
`UnityEngine.XR.XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName("Cardboard");`

The app is in spanish, you have to select first "Cardboard" and then "Galería de experiencias". After that it will happen with any of the first videos that appear on the list

Trying to correct it, when I change the "Aspect ratio mode" found at Unity "Player Settings" to "Custom", and assign the "Up to" value to 2.1 or any other float value, the Unity Console throws the following error:

C:\Users\USER\Documents\Unity\360app\Temp\gradleOut\build\intermediates\merged_manifests\release\AndroidManifest.xml:50: AAPT: error: '2,1' is incompatible with attribute maxAspectRatio (attr) float

### WORKAROUNDS (IF ANY)
I exported the project to Android Studio, and changed manually the AndroidManifest.xml adding the parameters specified at https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens-distribution

`<activity android:resizeableActivity="false">`
`<meta-data android:name="android.max_aspect" android:value="2.2" />`

But it didn't solved the issue
