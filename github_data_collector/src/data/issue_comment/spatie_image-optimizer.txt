This should be fixed.
Fixes #97 
I have a package that is utilizing image-optimizer and I want to detect if the optimizers are present on the system. On my local machine I've installed all of them but binaryPath is an empty string. I had assumed that if that path was empty they were not present. Maybe that's incorrect?

Do I need to do something more to point image-optimizer to those binaries? 

In this case the libs are installed with brew as mentioned in the documentation.
