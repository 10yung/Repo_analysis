Hello,
I am using walkabout version.
I would like to display some text of undefined length, then display on its right an image.
The only way I can see as of now is to:
1. estimate the text screen size based on font selected and text length
2. declare a flow of this width
3. add another flow behind with the image
Is there a better way to do avoiding the painful step 1 please?
Thx!

Adding some sample files to the sample folder.

These are all problems I "how do I do this????" and couldn't find an easy answer to online or in the manual. They are ~exceptionally~ straightforward, and might help other new users.

Hello,

An edit_box is not displayed on my following ruby example, can you please help?

```
Shoes.app do
    app.stack do
        app.flow do
            app.stack width:95 do
                app.inscription "Personal comments:", align: "right"
            end
            comPerso = app.edit_box height: 40, width: 201
            valButton = app.image "img/ok.jpg", height: 25, width: 45, margin_left: 10, margin_right: 10
        end
    end
end
```

Thx & regards,
David

Hello,
I just migrated to Ubuntu, and I would like to run my shoes program easily by opening it with Shoes 3.3.
Can you please help on the procedure to:
- install Shoes 3.3 (what to do of the .install file?)
- open systematically a .shoes file with the installed Shoes 3.3?
  Thanks in advance!
  Regards,
  David

According to [this page](https://github.com/shoes/shoes/wiki/Building-Shoes-on-Linux), I should be able to install on ArchLinux using shoes-git, but it looks like this package doesn't exist anymore.

Quick, distracting and aggressive animation in the background of the main menu is highly unpleasant. What worse there is no obvious way to stop it.

At least link to working installation instructions would be nice.

Not sure what the issue is here.  I'm thinking maybe permissions?  But I'm not sure what process needs permission.

This is the stack trace.  Any ideas?

Shoes 3.2, Mac OS X 10.10.2, everytime I open an app with Shoes, it produces logs like

> 5/21/15 11:46:29.264 AM bird[48933]: Assertion failed: ![_xpcClients containsObject:client]

And the whole Shoes app UI freezes for about 5-10 seconds.
Any idea what happened? Thank you!
