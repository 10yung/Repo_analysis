How to reproduce:
1) Tick the auto generate checkbox in lighting settings in Unity 2018.3
2) In scene, right click > GameObject > Create CSG > Rebuild the default cube
3) Auto generate checkbox is disabled
Sometimes the clone texture face hotkey "c" will fail to trigger.
It looks like it is due to KeyMappings.EventsMatch Function failing to match the key event in OnKeyAction() due to the event only having a character set but not a KeyCode

adding this to the top of the [EventsMatch function](https://github.com/sabresaurus/SabreCSG/blob/c434ce86730dce2ee6972232aff316dbed999339/Scripts/Input/KeyMappings.cs#L93) fixes it for me, but I don't know if this is a decent way to fix it and if it is just me having this problem.

            if (event1.isKey && event1.keyCode == KeyCode.None)
                event1.keyCode = (KeyCode)event1.character;

            if(event2.isKey && event2.keyCode == KeyCode.None)
                event2.keyCode = (KeyCode)event2.character;
Adding the ability to choose default/instance options for the menuitem `SabreCSG > Create Material(s) ...` would allow a bit more flexibility when creating a bunch of transparent materials.

This was suggested over on discord by **dsc**

My own personal addition to this would allow checking the texture name for an arbitrary user-defined flag, e.g. `_masked`, etc. and applying the proper material properties that way.
Currently there is no support for HDRP. Surface shaders aren't supported so brush materials are displayed as pink error shader.
Creating a prefab of a CSGModel and then trying to edit its brushes in the prefab editor keeps the visible handles aligned, but their usable area, depending on the size of the brush, becomes misaligned and unusable.
Basically what the title says.

It will write out the meshes next to the scene, labelled `"VisualMesh" + materialMeshDictionary.MeshCount + ".asset"`.
While perfectly fine with one single CSG model in the scene, it breaks with multiple CSGModels. Each one has its own materialMeshDictionary (makes perfect sense too) and each one is counting from zero upward, overriding meshes from another CSGModel.

The same happens for the collision mesh of course.

I went there and looked if the names can be made unique somewhat.
Certainly, there are many ways to make it so.
Add a GUID to the file name. Add a timestamp to the file name. Add some form of Hash value. Whatever.
Those are, perhaps, not exactly pretty solutions though, hence I didn't jump straight in and PR the thing.

Anyone fancy dropping some input on this?
The places in question are `MeshGroupManager.FinalizeVisualMesh` and `MeshGroupManager.FinalizeCollisionMesh`

When using the Draw tool, it is snapping to the correct grid size, but not the global position of the grid properly. The Vertex tool and other tools match up with the projected grid perfectly but the draw tool doesn't.
[Found this topic while needing this feature.](https://answers.unity.com/questions/42996/how-to-create-layermask-field-in-a-custom-editorwi.html)

Notice this version excludes empty layers in the resulting field.
This has been requested here and there.

PR #202 "The polygons in a group are not always coplanar. This may be caused by some bugs in the core algorithm, and I can't fix it. But I added a coplanar test in CalculateConvexHulls to skip the optimization of corrupted polygon groups."

Issue #103 "It seems that the root of this problem is not in Optimize Geometry. The CalculateConvexHulls function in Optimize Geometry assumes that all polygons in a group is coplanar, but this is not true. I add a test of PlaneEqualsLooser for every two polygons inside CalculateConvexHulls, and found that there are polygons not coplanar when this bug occurs.
So I think the bug is actually in the core algorithm. When building subtract brushes, polygons are not correctly grouped by plane, means there is wrong UniqueIndex."

Requires investigation.
