Not really an issue, I just want to know how did you get to know the points for writing "Loading". I want to write a different text and was in need of some resource to give me those points.
Will you make it support cocoapods install?

Hello Nghia Tran,

You have created very usefull classes for loaders.

I am using one of them in my application. "FeSpinnerTenDot" I am using.

I have write some methods in AppDelegate for showing loader and removing loader.

It works fine for first time, but I don't know while executing the same code another time it's not removing loader from screen.

Below is my code that I have written in AppDelegate

-(void)ShowHUDWith:(NSString*)strtitle inView:(UIView *)view
{
_spinner = [[FeSpinnerTenDot alloc] initWithView:view withBlur:YES];
_spinner.fontTitleLabel = [UIFont fontWithName:@"Helvetica" size:18];
_spinner.delegate = self;
_spinner.titleLabelText = strtitle;
[_spinner show];
[view addSubview:_spinner];
}

-(void)dismissLoadingView
{
[_spinner dismiss];
}

-(void)DismissWithSuccessLoadingView
{
if (self.isLoaderVisible)
{
_spinner.titleLabelText = kSuccess;
[self performSelector:@selector(dismissLoadingView) withObject:nil afterDelay:1.5];
}
}

-(void)DismissWithErrorMessage:(NSString *)strMessage
{
if (self.isLoaderVisible)
{
_spinner.titleLabelText = strMessage;
[self performSelector:@selector(dismissLoadingView) withObject:nil afterDelay:1.5];
}
}

And I am calling the delegate methods from another view controllers. like in completion blocks.

Let me know if I have something mis-understood or created some wrong code.
