My S3 bucket is in AWS-CHINA, region is "cn-northwest-1", but I didn't find anything about this in the src, Is ice support china-region?

I used ice in kubernetes way.
**Here is my configmap-ice.yaml**

```

**Here is my deployment.yaml's env part**

```shell
  - name: ice
          image: harbor.shannonai.com/test/ice:latest
          ports:

            - run-app
```

**The error I met is**

```shell

It seems that ice is still connect to the default s3 region "us-east-1", where did I misconfig? Please help me to figure it out, thanks very much!
Hi,

Since the 12/07/2019, ICE stopped getting AWS EC2 Reserved Instances (RIs) information. It will only displays the cost of your on-demand EC2 instances. Therefore ICE _ec2_instance_ costs are on-demand cost only.

This is a FYI only because ICE seems unmaintained (by Netflix and Teevity) and I don't have the skills to fix it. So be aware of this issue before trialing ICE. If anyone has the courage to fix, please ping us in this ticket.

The rest though still seems to work. 

Hi,

After purchasing some RedShift RI's (9 x dc2.large), our Redshift costs has increased dramatically whislt ec2_instance has dropped dramatically. Any thoughts on the issue?

i don't see ca-central-1 in the UI , is this supported? i see it in  src/java/com/netflix/ice/tag/Region.java, but doesnt seem to show anything in the UI for the accounts that are using that region.

When im looking at AWS Summary i should see Region ca-central-1 as this is one of my most used zones, any idea why this isnt showing up?

I'm trying to get the dockerized Ice running on OS X.  I'm using the default settings from jbrouse's repo with of course my AWS key/keyid, bucket name and prefix in it.   I can't get anything on the nginx port - nginx reports an upstream timeout to my browser (so I know I"m reaching nginx).  Whenever I run docker-compose, ice starts scraping price information from region ap-south-1, and it stops producing output every time after (I should point out that my bucket is in us-west-1 and I set it as such).
```
ice_1    | 2018-05-15 16:15:48,578 [localhost-startStop-1] INFO  basic.BasicReservationService  - Setting RI price for ap-south-1 HEAVY x1.32xlarge.windows 1578185.0 0.0
```
I am using VirtualBox under docker-machine, and other docker workloads are working fine.  I upped the VM's memory to 4G prior to running docker-machine, which doesn't seem to make a difference.  I don't see any other error messages beyond the nginx timeout error.  I tried upping the proxy_read-_timeout via an additional proxy_settings.conf for nginx, and it's obeying that larger timeout, but still timing out.

I've verified the AWS keypair works, and can read the billing reports and write to the ice reports prefix I assigned.

Any suggestions would be most gratefully appreciated.
Get error:
 Caused by UnknownHostException: bucketname.s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
->> 1280 | getAllByName0            in java.net.InetAddress

Cause:
/src/java/com/netflix/ice/common/AwsUtils.java has a "public static boolean downloadFileIfChangedSince" definition that is incorrectly formatting "s3Client.setEndpoint" as "("s3." + bucketFileRegion + ".amazonaws.com").

Resolution:
Manually modifying the local AwsUtils.java file, changing as follows: ("s3." + bucketFileRegion + ".amazonaws.com").

Restart service and errors should go away.  Need this part of the codebase updated!!!
