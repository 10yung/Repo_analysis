#### Issue
I have created a custom field via Studio in Project Task Templates called 'category_c'.
I have created a custom field via Studio in Project Tasks called 'category_c'.
I have filled in some data in the custom 'Category' field in some Project Task Templates that are related to a Project Template.
When a project is created using the Project Template referenced above the Project Tasks are created successfully but the values in the 'category_c' field are not propagated.

#### Expected Behavior
When a custom field of the same name and type exist in both Project Task Templates and Project Tasks then the value of the Project Task Template's custom field should be written to the respective custom field in the newly created Project Task associated with a project created with the relevant Project Template.

#### Actual Behavior
The value is not written

#### Possible Fix
modules/AM_ProjectTemplates/controller.php should be updated with something similar to what's detailed in these posts: 
https://community.suitecrm.com/t/project-template-tasks-extra-fields/23648/2
https://community.suitecrm.com/t/project-template-tasks-extra-fields/23648/8
https://community.suitecrm.com/t/project-template-tasks-extra-fields/23648/17

The code would need to be generalized to pick up any custom fields in the Project Task Template and check for that field (of same type) existing in the Project Task
Some checks would likely need to be added before the JOIN is performed.

#### Context
This impacts the usefulness of Project Templates moderately.

#### Your Environment
* SuiteCRM Version used: 7.11.10
* Browser name and version: Firefox 72.0.1 (64-bit)
* Environment name and version: MySQL, PHP 7.2
* Operating System and version: Ubuntu 18.04


#### Issue
When installing a module with multiple logic hooks using the module loader on an opcache enabled configured server, only the last logic hook in the manifest is enabled

#### Expected Behavior
All logic hooks are enabled

#### Actual Behavior
When multiple hooks for the module are defined in the manifest, only the last hook is enabled. this is reflected in the file custom/modules/<modulename>/logic_hooks.php

#### Possible Fix
I will create a pull request for shortly.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Setup the php configuration to use opcache (opcache.enable =1)
2. Create a simple basic module with module builder and publish this module
3. Modify the manifest in the published module by adding two logic hooks
3. Use module loader to load the published module
4. Check the file custom/modules/<modulename>/logic_hooks.php

#### Context
Default php configurations have opcache enabled. When installing modules, all logic hooks should be activated accordingly

#### Your Environment
* SuiteCRM Version used: 7.11.10
* Browser name and version: Mozilla Firefox 72.0.1
* Environment name and version: MariaDB PHP 7.2
* Operating System and version: Ubuntu 16.04
#### Issue
When installing a module with the module loader on an opcache enabled configured server, the database table is not created.

#### Expected Behavior
The table is created (which is the case when opcache is not enabled)

#### Actual Behavior
The database table is not created: when creating a new entry for this module a database error is shown. The log file contains an entry with the corresponding error message.

It requires to do a "Quick repair an rebuild" to create the table.

#### Possible Fix
Fixes I will create a pull request for shortly.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Setup the php configuration to use opcache (opcache.enable =1)
2. Create a simple basic module with module builder and publish this module
3. Use module loader to load the published module
4. Navigate into this module and create a new entry

#### Context
Default php configurations have opcache enabled. When installing modules, the tables should be created accordingly without having to do an extra "Quick repair and rebuild"

Use the module name as a key for the `$modulePathDisplay` list, so that later when iterating, we can check if keys match their value. We do this because we only want to translate the module label for actual modules and not relationship labels.

## Motivation and Context
<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->
If you have a module label or relationship label that equals the module name/key of another module, Reports get mixed up when building the module patch display string and display inccorect module/rel labels.

## How To Test This
<!--- Please describe in detail how to test your changes. -->
1. Rename `Opportunities` module to `Projects`/`Project` (Note this will change the relationship label `LBL_OPPORTUNITY` to `Project` in `Accounts`).
1. Rename the `Projects` module to anything else other than `Projects`. 
1. Create a report with `Accounts` as the main module and at least one `Opportunity` field (Note that the path displays fine).
1. Save the record and then return to it's edit view to see the new `Projects` module label displayed instead of the `Opportunities` relationship label.
