authentication for SSH.

For headless servers with serial console only we want to change the
order of consoles on the kernel commandline.  In addition we add
the ability to configure the kernel commandline for the arbitrary
console configurations in case the default nor headless order is
appropriate.

Defaults is en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8 which is the backwards-compatible
behaviour.

A number of minor tweaks to enable linting and fix linting complaints.
Many hosts (including the docker host) set HOSTNAME in the environment,
which means that unless the HOSTNAME is explicitly set in a 'config'
that the resulting image hostname will be the build host's hostname.

We fix that by unsetting HOSTNAME prior to reading the configs and
applying defaults.

    There are use cases where pi-gen can be useful that need different
    image generation that the current defaults.  Rather than force such
    users to require carrying modified versions of the default exports,
    allow users to specify alternate exports (e.g. instead of export-image
    and export-noobs, or in addition to these).  We do this using a
    mechanism similar to STAGE_LIST, except that the lists of images are
    per-stage and default to paying attention to the presence of
    EXPORT_IMAGE and EXPORT_NOOBS as is currently the case.

    Demo the new custom export capability with an new export type
    'export-swappart-image' that uses a swap partition.  Note that it really
    only makes sense if one tweaks stage2 to not include dphys-swapfile.

This fixes two small grammar errors and the confusing description of stage2.
The `loop` kernelmodule is needed, otherwise the script `export-image/prerun.sh` fails in this line
https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen/blob/f8f3d6fe93a6709f02f63f3a203a38bcd33a0c0d/export-image/prerun.sh#L42
with the message
```
losetup: /pi-gen/work/2020-01-08-Raspbian/export-image/2020-01-08-Raspbian-lite.img: failed to set up loop device: No such file or directory
```

So this is a fix for #320

(I suggest you pull my previous pull-request first, in order to reduce the commits in this pull request from 2 to 1. [This pr is based on the previous one])
As is written in the README, `binfmt-support` needs to be installed for Docker:

Ref: https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen/blame/024840034e2fab7efe170a303ef726fed1314f82/README.md#L230

(This pull-request makes that explicit and checks that it holds true)
For each stage check if the path is absolute or starts with a `..`
If so add a it to the docker instance as a volume. Also modify the
STAGE_LIST variable with the paths that will be seen from within
the docker container.

Fixes #364
