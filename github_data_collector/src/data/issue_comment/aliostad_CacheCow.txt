Hi, 

I have a question, is there a way to disable CacheCow? 

I would like to disable the cache whenever I am working on my local environment, my current workaround is to force chrome to disable caching. 

Is there a better way to do this? Also, this is an awesome project!
It seems the three assemblies (CacheCow.Common.sn, CacheCow.Server.sn & CacheCow.Client.sn)
were one time releases and were left in version 1.1.1

Any chances to update them to their latest version (2.4.2)?

Thanks in advance.
On .NET Core (I've tested 2.0 and 2.1) calling `DeserializeToResponseAsync` on `MessageContentHttpMessageSerializer` will crash with certain http responses. (google.com being one of them)

I've tested this on 4.7.1 and the crash does not occur. I'm guessing this may be a framework issue, but I'm not 100% sure. 

I've attached a project that reproduces the problem

Thanks
it would be nice to have a way of adding hook for POST Action and other custom HTTP verb.
