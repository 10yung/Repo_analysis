The route is known, but it is not in the database of cameradar. Here is the official forum:
https://support.reolink.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007010473-How-to-Live-View-Reolink-Cameras-via-VLC-Media-Player
Here is also a good resource (you might want to add more cameras)
https://www.ispyconnect.com/man.aspx?n=Reolink

```
h264Preview_01_main
h264Preview_01_sub
```

btw, I have tried to add these to into ```routers``` files but it did not work. Any ideas what's wrong?

The full url must be the following:
rtsp://username:password@192.168.0.1:554/h264Preview_01_main
