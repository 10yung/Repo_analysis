I use an option key (⌥) with mouse drag to copy a clip in Adobe Premiere.  I would like to show the option key press on the screen.  Currently it doesn't show unless I press a regular key with the modifier.
Can this application be set to a fixed position, it will return to the bottom left corner each time it is turned on? #
Delete key is ⌫, forward delete is ⌦, but _shifted_ forward delete shows as a boxed question mark indicating, I guess, an unknown character.  I have a full mac keyboard with number pad and home, end, page up, page down keys section including the forward delete key.  I use a key combination in Adobe Premiere for ripple delete: ⇧⌦ which poses 2 problems for KeyCastr: 1) Shift Glyph doesn't show at all (See my comment on @akitchen 's [issue](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr/issues/140) about shift modifier behaviour for my thoughts on a "menu style" mode for how to handle shift and key labels), and 2) shifted forward delete shows as a boxed question mark.

Allow including key commands in a Blacklist that will not be shown in KeyCastr.  Use case: screencasting or screen recording where some key combinations are for operating the screencasting software and should not be displayed on screen while recording another operation.  Specific Example: I record my screen using OBS.  I have a key combination set to switch screens for recording, but I do not want that combination displayed on screen while I record whereas I do want most other key presses displayed on screen.

Whitelist would operate conversely, where ONLY key combinations in the whitelist will appear on screen.
Added a new screenshot and instructions for Mac OS Catalina since preferences changes a bit.
Holding down a key, e.g. 'x', will make KeyCastr show "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx" etc., but on my screen I will only type a single 'x'.

There is a configurable setting in System Preferences with which I have disabled key repeat.
I want to know that if it is OK to add localization support?
If it is OK, I can work on Chinese localizatoin because this software is quite mostly used among Chinese people.
I just downloaded 0.9.7 on a mac mini running 10.15
when I launch it, I get the dialog requesting Accessibility API access
I removed & re-added Keycastr as suggested but the process just repeats
Anyone else having this problem?

```
Could not create keyDown event tap!
Please grant KeyCastr access to the Accessibility API.
If KeyCastr already has access, please remove it and add it again.
```

While I was investigating a failing `brew cask` install of keycastr:

```shellsession

Error: Failed to quarantine one or more files within /usr/local/Caskroom/keycastr/0.9.6. Here's the reason:

So I unzipped the file manually and tried to investigate what is the non-existent files.

I'm not sure why the wrong symlinks are there (my crude guess is that you're locale is french and macOS treats the developer's locale specially?), but I think they should be removed from the release zip file.
