Hello, 
I found some problems in your code using the PVS-Studio static code analyzer; I described the issues in the article: "[Checking Telerik UI for UWP as a Way to Get Started with PVS-Studio](https://www.viva64.com/en/b/0677/)"

The text doesn't cover all analyzer warnings that were issued in course of the check. Perhaps, some warnings that aren't mentioned in the article will seem to you more interesting if you check the project yourself. Project developers know better what problems are more critical. :)

To work with the analyzer, you will need a key, here it is:

## Summary
All databinding support for Indicators and Annotations to the chart component.

## API Changes

```Telerik.UI.Xaml.Controls.Chart.RadChartBase```
Add the DependencyProperty for `AnnotationsProvider` and `IndicatorsProvider`

Create classes
`Telerik.UI.Xaml.Controls.Chart.ChartAnnotationsProvider`
`Telerik.UI.Xaml.Controls.Chart.ChartIndicatorsProvider`
`Telerik.UI.Xaml.Controls.Chart.ChartIndicatorsDescriptorCollection`
`Telerik.UI.Xaml.Controls.Chart.ChartAnnotationsDescriptorCollection`
`Telerik.UI.Xaml.Controls.Chart.ChartAnnotationsDescriptor`
`Telerik.UI.Xaml.Controls.Chart.ChartIndicatorsDescriptor`

Telerik UI for WPF already supports this feature. So it should simply be a matter of copy pasting from there. 

## Intended Use Case
I need to create an app with dynamically generated annotations and indicators. At this time it is not possible to do this easily in a data bound way.

### Description
I am using RadCartesianChart in my UWP app to plot some values and there is a little issue. The data when plotted on the chart shows most of the values accurately but with some values it just skips the data rows entirely and then moves on to next. Also it does not show the first data row and the last one on mouse-over behavior which works well otherwise in the data. Have a look at the screenshots.
In first one the trackball is at start but it does not show the first value, it shows 2nd or 3rd value from the data. If you actually look close enough there is a small gap there which indicates that it wont go any further to the start. So it also happens at the end of the data with the same behavior. Second thing can be seen from the 2nd and 3rd screenshots where the tooltip is being shown but there is a lot of gap between the data. I think it could be due to the the fact that value of the actual data is quite same there but there is difference in time and it's around 15 minutes but still it skips all the data and goes to the next intersection point.
### Steps to Reproduce

1.  Use any type of data value and plot it on the Chart, just make sure the data has atleast 3 values in it otherwise it would not make sense
2.  Enable the trackball behavior and see for yourself

### Expected Behavior
The trackball behavior should show all the data that is available on the chart and should not skip it.
### Actual Behavior
As discussed above.
### Basic Information

- Version with issue: 1.0.1.6
- IDE: VS Community 2017
- UWP SDK: I am running Windows 10 v18875 and targeting v17763
- Nuget Packages: 1.0.1.6

### Reproduction Link
If you want the actual data that I am using, please head to https://dps.psx.com.pk/ in your browser so the website sets a cookie and then head to https://dps.psx.com.pk/timeseries/int/KSE100 to see the actual data. This data is in reverse format as so the first value will be the last value for the day and the last value will be the first one for the day. So you can reverse the whole JsonArray and be done with it. Every item in the array has 3 values: UNIX timestamp, Current Value at that time and Volume. It's a Stock Exchange website.

The XAML part that I am using is here:
```

Scenario:

I am loading RadDataGrid with more than 15 columns along with dynamic frozen columns 

Since I have Frozen columns there will be some columns left out towards the right side which I have to scroll and see

Issue:

I scroll towards the right side and If I start doing resize with the last column using resize handle it automatically scrolls me to the left side without allowing me to resize and not user friendly

Also , at time I am seeing exception being raised if I repeat these action multiple times

Kindly help me on the same as I was able to reproduce this with simple example with columns more than 20
## Summary
The RadDataGrid and RadPaginationControl solver several common UI problems.  However, they are mutually incompatible and cannot be used together to solve a very fundamental UI design pattern; data-grid with pagination support.

RadDataGrid is not derived from the Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Primitives.Selector class.  In addition, the RadPaginationControl class has a PageProvider property which is class specific and thus is not flexible enough to work with any other types.  It could be more adaptable if this property's type was  Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Primitives.ISelector (an interface that Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Primitives.Selector implements).

## API Changes
**Suggestion 1**
The RadPaginationControl's PageProvider class should be of type Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Primitives.ISelector instead of the concrete Selector class.  This would allow us to implement any control we'd like.  

**Suggestion 2**
In addition, the RadDataGrid should implement the Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Primitives.ISelector interface.  This second suggestion would remove the implementation complexity for the user community and embed the implementation details into the RadDataGrid class.  

e.g.

If RadPaginationControl.PageProvider was of type Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Primitives.ISelector instead of Selector, then we could create a custom RadDataGrid class that implements this interface and do the following....

    var grid = new MyCustomRadDataGrid();
    this.idRadPaginationControl.PageProvider = grid;

If RadDataGrid implemented the Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Primitives.ISelector type, then the user community would not need to create a custom RadDataGrid class.

## Intended Use Case
With both of the aforementioned changes, RadDataGrid and RadPaginationControl can be used together.  This would provide seamless data-grid, pagination support for the user community.  

If only the first suggestion is implemented, then the user community would still be able to define a custom RadDataGrid derivatives that implement the Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Primitives.ISelector; thus achieving the same objective. 
Though we set Frozen Column count the Horizontal Scroll bar starts from the first column

Is there a way to highlight the vertical column line to differentiate between frozen and unfrozen columns

or 

Can the vertical scroll bar be made available only from the Unfrozen columns ?

Scrollbar option is supported here - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/communitytoolkit/controls/datagrid_guidance/styling_formatting_options

Is the same support available?

I have a stacked bar chart with dynamic series - where each series relates to a specific color - how do I bind the color of the series bars to the ColorCount.Color? 
each series is a ColorCount:
 public sealed class ColorCount
    {
        public Color Color {get;set;}
        public IEnumerable<TimeCount> Count {get;set;}

        public int Total {get;set;}
    }

`     <chart:RadCartesianChart x:Name="Chart">
            <chart:RadCartesianChart.SeriesProvider>
                <chart:ChartSeriesProvider Source="{Binding Colors, Mode=OneWay}" x:Name="Provider"   >
                    <chart:ChartSeriesProvider.SeriesDescriptors>
                        <chart:CategoricalSeriesDescriptor ItemsSourcePath="Count" CategoryPath="Time" ValuePath="Count">
                            <chart:CategoricalSeriesDescriptor.Style>
                                <Style TargetType="chart:BarSeries">
                                    <Setter Property="CombineMode" Value="Stack"/>
                                </Style>
                            </chart:CategoricalSeriesDescriptor.Style>
                        </chart:CategoricalSeriesDescriptor>
                    </chart:ChartSeriesProvider.SeriesDescriptors>
                </chart:ChartSeriesProvider>
            </chart:RadCartesianChart.SeriesProvider>
            <chart:RadCartesianChart.HorizontalAxis>
                <chart:CategoricalAxis/>
            </chart:RadCartesianChart.HorizontalAxis>
            <chart:RadCartesianChart.VerticalAxis>
                <chart:LinearAxis/>
            </chart:RadCartesianChart.VerticalAxis>
        </chart:RadCartesianChart>`
The Map should support that configuration as well when it gets officially released with the next version of Visual Studio.

Any plans to add Diagrams control to this UWP offering similar to [one for WPF](https://www.telerik.com/products/wpf/diagrams.aspx?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=desktop-ui-trial-dsa-search-NA&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8qGRg62h3QIV1I2zCh2CnAKKEAAYASAAEgLtvvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CMTzwJCtod0CFU--swodXY8Cpg)?
The DataGridBooleanColumn shows a box filled with an X (Unicode character U+2612, Ballot Box With X) for false values. In my opinion this is incorrect. I believe it should show an empty box (Unicode character U+2610, Ballot Box) instead.
