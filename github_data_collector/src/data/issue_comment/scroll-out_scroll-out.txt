I need your help to add scrollOut js in Nuxt js project. I am getting window not defined error.

I have followed Nuxt's guidlines of adding a plugin like
`if (process.client) {
  require('external_library')
}`
However this isn't working for me even after adding the plugin in the nuxt.config.js file
```

import ScrollOut from "scroll-out";

export default {
  methods: {
    textAnim() {
      TweenMax.set("#logo, .hidetext, #about-text", { visibility: 'visible' })
      const tl = new TimelineMax();
        tl.from("#logo path", 1, { stroke: "white", drawSVG: "0" });
        tl.to("#s_1_", .5, { fill: "white", stroke: "none" }, "-=.3")
        tl.to("#k_1_", .5, { fill: "gray", stroke: "none"}, "-=.3")
        tl.staggerFrom(".hidetext", 1, { y: "130%", ease: Power4.easeOut }, 0.5);
        tl.from("#about-text", 0.5, { alpha: 0, y: 50, ease: Power1.easeOut }, "-=.5");
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    ScrollOut({
      targets: "h3, [data-splitting], ul li",
      threshold: .5
    });
    this.textAnim();
  },
  components: {
    Logo
  }
};
```
Also in my package.json file I see` "nuxt": "^2.0.0",` version. I created the project using `create-nuxt-app`.

Any help is really appreciated.

Thanking you
Hi! I am working with svg and i have an issue. I try to add `data-scroll` to group tag (g) in svg to animate it. But Scroll out seems not work with svg
I get slideinup animation with following code as you described in your demo.
```
.scroll {
  opacity: 0;
  will-change: transform, scale, opacity;
  transform: translateY(6rem) scale(0.93);
  transition: all 1.5s cubic-bezier(0.165, 0.84, 0.44, 1);
}
.scroll[data-scroll="in"] {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0) scale(1);
}
```
```
ScrollOut({
targets: '.scroll'
});
```
I would like to have more css codes for animation. Can you point me to some css codes for animations like bounce, fade, flip, rotate, zoom etc
### Device Information:
- Safari Version 12.1.1 
- Device: MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)
- MacOs Mojave 10.14.5 (18F132)


### Package Version:
```json
"scroll-out": "^2.2.7"
```

### Application code snippet:

```js
static initScrollLogic() {
    // init scroll out object
    ScrollOut({
      cssProps: {
        scrollPercentY: true,
      },
    });

    /* Calling function that handles the scroll
      animation of the 'Beagles' text in the sidebar */

    beaglesNameAnimationFn(config);
  }
```

### Issue Summary:

On safari (desktop), the scroll percent variables do not seem to update properly, and remain at 0 (ex. `--scroll-percent-y: 0`).

**I'm am not seeing this issue on other browsers. I've tested it on Chrome and Firefox and everything seems to work as expected.**

Below is a screen shot of what I'm seeing on my end. As you can see if you take a look at the `style` attribute on the `html` tag, the styles and data attribute are all added to the document properly (`style="--name-diff: 44.0409%; --scroll-percent-y: 0;"`).

I'm not sure if this is related to this issue or not (#16).

Please let me no if you need anymore information. Thanks in advance!
I can see through the doc and the code that viewportX/Y values are clamped but when doing parallax, I want to see object moving while their center position isn't yet in the viewport (so value can be greater or lesser than 1/-1).

Maybe you can give possibility to clamp or not values with an option?
First off: Thank you for this! Really easy to get setup and works wonders!

I'm under the impression that most of the setup can be done using data attributes. Such as `<div data-scroll data-scroll-once="true" data-scroll-threshold="0.9">`.

If it's already supposed to work, could you point me in the right direction? If not, could it be added?

Again, thank you for the fine work!
I saw this is mostly written in Typescript (Awesome choice!). But I noticed that the typings aren't distributed with the npm package. Is there a reason for leaving them out?
I have a set of sections ~`150vh` each. How do I know percentage of scrolled space within current section? `--viewport-y` not seems to be helpful here as it gives values relatively to viewport center. or can anyone suggest how do I achieve parallax for with this variable? I planned to give transitionY to the image based on the `--viewport-y` but seems I need scroll position within current element from 0 to 1
When using Mobile safari in an iframe, scroll tracking does not appear to work.  I think the scrolling element might be different in that particular scenario.
Add a callback that fires each time the css properties are being recalculated.
