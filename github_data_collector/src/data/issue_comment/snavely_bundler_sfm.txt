I came across this problem too. Some how I find where cause it and it may help.
I run " ./../RunBundler.sh ../examples/dyck_jpg " . Notice that my directory named "dyck_jpg" where my images save. Then I check list.txt and find the image path become "dyck/0000.jpg.jpg" which is obviously wrong. I think it is because the directory name contains underline or "jpg". So change your directory name and it will be ok.
**Do not have underline or "jpg" in your directory name !!!**
However, it is 2019 now.

how can i  resolve it
Hi,
I try to get the feature point with the cv::keypoint format:
_pt	x & y coordinates of the keypoint
_size	keypoint diameter
_angle	keypoint orientation
_response	keypoint detector response on the keypoint (that is, strength of the keypoint)
_octave	pyramid octave in which the keypoint has been detected
_class_id	object id

I'm not clear with the bundler_sfm output file.
How should I get them?
can more of Photo Tourism be made open source?
As I mentioned in Issues, these two files (time-unix.h and time-unix.cpp) are needed for building with windows system.
Also I found difference between rot2aa() and ceres::RotationMatrixToAngleAxis and between aa2rot() and ceres::AngleAxisToRotationMatrix.
The sign is different in the output of each function

Hello,
can you please add command list for typical JPG -> bundler -> PMVS2 -> meshlab workflow to README.md?

For example MVE package has this simple HOWTO:

```
#Put JPG images into ./img directory
makescene -i ./img ./scn
sfmrecon ./scn
dmrecon -s2 ./scn
scene2pset -F2 ./scn ./scn/pset-L2.ply
meshlab ./scn/pset-L2.ply
#fssrecon ./scn/pset-L2.ply ./scn/surface-L2.ply
#meshclean -t10 ./scn/surface-L2.ply ./scn/surface-L2-clean.ply
```

I would like to see similar HOWTO for bundler+pmvs2 workflow.

Thank you.
Hi ,

i encounter another error as below

Performing Bundler2PMVS conversion...

Any idea how to solve it?

Many thanks in advance
Hi
I wonder where RunSFM_Ceres is implemented.
According to header file(BundleApp.h), the function is not defined.
If I want to use Ceres solver, do I have to implement it?
Hi
Is it possible for your sofware to create a bundler for a ground truth dataset such as Middlebury. where you have all information about the camera
