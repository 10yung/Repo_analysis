My MBP only supports up to High Sierra... Will macOS 10.13 support be in position one day? 

Appreciate it.
I keep seeing this error when attempting to use AltServer to install AltStore. This is on a Windows machine. Tried logging out on iCloud + iTunes, rebooting, logging back in, changing Apple ID password, logging in with a browser to appleid.apple.com and try again, creating an app-specific pass + revoke them all + change password again, disable Windows Firewall, rebooting the phone: nada, nothing works. I see fastlane/sigh had similiar issues and they fixed it a while ago allegedly. And using XCode on Mac tons of users are reporting it happening there as well (and fixing it by disabling DVTDeveloperAccountUseKeychainService) - but this is Windows anyway, hehe. 

I've done some Google'ing around as well. Lots of people with the same problem using AltServer, none that have found a work-around. Any clues as to why this is happening? Out of ideas. :) 
AltStore on iPad looks really small, and I wish it could actually fit the screen AKA a iPhone/iPad app. Could you please fix this?
Hello,
I had this error message during my first use of the Altstore but then was able to download Delta after a few tries (reinstalling, rebboting etc...). But now I can't refreshthe apps and am shown this same message : "Could not find Altserver"
My phone is linked by cable, with iTunes running (internet windows version) ; on the same hotspot (tried my box and using my phone as a hotspot) ; firewalls down ; various combination of restarting phone, altserver, comupter etc... reinstalled altserver on the computer. Nothing seems to work
Ideas ? Thanks in advance
Every time after I enter Apple-ID/PW and press Install, it crashes...
The gray icon on the tray disappears....

I just download AltStore today, the version should be the newest...

Thank you very much~

attempting to install altstore on primary phone.
- states that altstore was downloaded to other devices and will be unable to be used on other devices. > clicked continue.
- occasionally after this step it will error out its random but this is the error :The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (NSURLErrorDomain error -1011.)

installation failed
- could not connect to AltServer
- mail addon is downloaded and enabled in mail preferences

config
- MBP 10.15.2
- iPhone 11 Pro max 13.3

* downloaded altstore to another iPhone using a different Apple ID.
* Apple ID freshly created and has not been used to download before.
* altserver app showed as not responding in activity monitor.

- - - - - - - - - - -- 

working instal
- iPhone XR  : iOS 13.3
- used different Apple ID 
- able to re-download altstore with old Apple ID that was originally used.

Is there a way to side load an .ipa, like Chimera's .ipa?
I tried installing Altstore on my iPhone X from my computer and it says that Altstore is already installed on another device. I haven't installed it on any other device, so I clicked continue, but when it gets installed and I try to open it, it immediately closes.
I can't very well paraphrase, but I have a log:

When I attempt to install the beta, delta or even enter my credentials into the settings it will crash when correctly entered, if entered incorrectly it alerts me. I'm using an iPhone 11 Pro on ios 13.2.3
