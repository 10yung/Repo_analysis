Is it still possible to use this project now? (Be used for In App Purchase）
I'm looking forward to your reply, thanks！

please!!!!!!!
Implements the continue App Store transaction delegate method.

```- (BOOL)paymentQueue:(SKPaymentQueue *)queue shouldAddStorePayment:(SKPayment *)payment forProduct:(SKProduct *)product```

I followed the same pattern as the other delegate methods.

Let me know if I missed something.
Line 555 of Cargobay.m 

`  __Require_noErr(SecKeyRawVerify(receiptSigningKey, kSecPaddingPKCS1SHA1, dataToBeVerified, sizeof(dataToBeVerified), signatureBlob->_signature, sizeof(signatureBlob->_signature)), _out);
`

started to show this error on Xcode 9

> This function declaration is not a prototype

How we can fix that?


Hello Matt,

Is this library still working, I would like to add your library for Auto-Renewable Subscription.

Kindly Please update.
I always get java.langNullPointerException error when trying to validate restored InApp Purchase. InApp is an automatically renewing subscription if that matters.
Verification of the transactions for sandbox account is always fails. Debugger says that value stored in "signatureBlob->_receiptVersion" is equal to 3, but expected to be 2 as described here:

>          3. Sanity check that signature is 128 bytes.
>          4. Sanity check certification size <= remaining payload data.

"The issue here is that solution locally validates the Apple signature that is a part of the transactionReceipt. This works so long at the same certificate is used to sign the transactionReceipt. Yesterday, May 16, 2016, the certificate was changed. The signature in the transactionReceipt now fails verification with the hardcoded signature built into the app."
