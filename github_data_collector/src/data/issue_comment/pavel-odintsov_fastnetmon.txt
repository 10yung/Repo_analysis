Started the installation of fastnetmon on a freshly installed Debian 10 Buster using https://fastnetmon.com/install/ guide. After a short time, the following error occurs:

Hello,

Is it possible to whitelist source of traffic? 

I would like to whitelist for example Google Servers IP addresses.

Regards,
Ramiro.
# If you want to solve your issue please read following information below

First of all, please check following steps:
* Do you have latest FastNetMon version? If not, please upgrade to 1.1.3 version.
We're running 1.1.3
* Do we have similar tickets already? Please check [bug tracker](https://github.com/pavel-odintsov/fastnetmon/issues) and [Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fastnetmon) about similar issues.
None than I can find

If it does not help, please fill information below:
* Your operating system name and version?
Debian 10
* Please attach your /etc/fastnetmon.conf configuration file
https://github.com/wikimedia/puppet/blob/production/modules/fastnetmon/templates/fastnetmon.conf.erb
* What capture engine are you using: netflow, sflow, miror?
Netflow

Then please describe your issue as detailed as possible! Thanks you :)

Fastnetmon report some attack as "Attack type: unknown", "Attack protocol: tcp" while it's for example the ICMP pps threshold that is being hit. And all the other values (eg. TCP pps/bandwidth) are well under the limits.
Eg.  "Incoming icmp pps: 2020 packets per second".
Before we bumped the threshold in https://github.com/wikimedia/puppet/commit/e7ad32b82748a11521551445548a5233528c49c4

This caused us some confusion as we were looking at TCP traffic only at first, based on the report.

We're tracking the issue in https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T241374 as well.

Thanks!

Hi,

I have issue when trying to change some value in fastnetmon.conf and then restart the services.
I found that new threshold setting are not loaded and fastnetmon service still use old value, ex:
Old setting:
```
# Different approaches to attack detection
ban_for_pps = on
ban_for_bandwidth = on
ban_for_flows = on

# Limits for Dos/DDoS attacks
threshold_pps = 7000
threshold_mbps = 75
threshold_flows = 3000

# Per protocol attack thresholds
# We don't implement per protocol flow limits, sorry :(
# These limits should be smaller than global pps/mbps limits

threshold_tcp_mbps = 70
threshold_udp_mbps = 70
threshold_icmp_mbps = 10

threshold_tcp_pps = 7000
threshold_udp_pps = 7000
threshold_icmp_pps = 7000

ban_for_tcp_bandwidth = on
ban_for_udp_bandwidth = on
ban_for_icmp_bandwidth = on

ban_for_tcp_pps = on
ban_for_udp_pps = on
ban_for_icmp_pps = on
```

And new config:

```
# Different approaches to attack detection
ban_for_pps = on
ban_for_bandwidth = on
ban_for_flows = on

# Limits for Dos/DDoS attacks
threshold_pps = 15000
threshold_mbps = 94
threshold_flows = 13000

# Per protocol attack thresholds
# We don't implement per protocol flow limits, sorry :(
# These limits should be smaller than global pps/mbps limits

threshold_tcp_mbps = 92
threshold_udp_mbps = 92
threshold_icmp_mbps = 10

threshold_tcp_pps = 14000
threshold_udp_pps = 14000
threshold_icmp_pps = 14000

ban_for_tcp_bandwidth = on
ban_for_udp_bandwidth = on
ban_for_icmp_bandwidth = on

ban_for_tcp_pps = on
ban_for_udp_pps = on
ban_for_icmp_pps = on
```
I'm still seing that FNM banned traffic over 7k pps and 70mbps, please see below:

Hello,

I have im seeing some "false positive" DDoS alerts, aparently caused by clients that use Google's QUIC protocol (UDP traffic on ports 80/443 from Chrome users to Google servers).

I would apreciate any ideas to get around this "issue".

Hi!

I'm sending sflow v5 from Cumulus switch to fastnetmon. Cumulus use the hsflowd daemon.

The fastnetmon_cli shows 0 bytes/pps etc

I get the following log :

Fastnetmon version 1.1.4 community

For documentation purposes, it would be great to allow comments in network_list and network_whitelist.

When i comment out the whole line, it currently works, but throws an error in the logfile:
`2019-09-13 09:54:22,272 [ERROR] Can't parse line from subnet list: '# testcomment'`
I think a WARNING would be more accurate in this case.

Unfortunately, inline-comments doesn't work at all, because the whole line is ignored.
`2019-09-13 10:01:03,982 [ERROR] Can't parse line from whitelist: 1.2.3.0/27    # testcomment`

I think the function load_our_networks_list() in fastnetmon.cpp has to be rewritten respectively the parsing logic has to be expanded in this case.

FastNetmon Community Edition currently exports pps, bps and number of flows on a per host base to Graphite. Total values are only exported for pps and bps and unfortunately not for number of flows. 
It would be great, if you could check if it's also possible to implement export of total number of flows.

Thanks in advance.

Hello,

it would be quite nice to use fastnetmon with multiple uplinks (each for example has it's own vlan) and apply vlan based limits.

So, for example, your network has two uplinks - one with e.g. 10Gbit and one with 20Gbit. A attack should not trigger the banning if it goes up to 15Gbit on the 20Gbit link, however on the 10Gbit link it should not trigger the ban as long as it does not go in a dangerous load level (for example it stays below 8Gbit).

I've already checked the lua hooks, but they dont seem to be the right solution for that. The other solution would be, to adapt the source code on my own if such a feature doesnt exist already.


We are use a port mirror for collect traffic and community version of Fastnetmon.
The value of TTL in /var/log/fastnetmon_attacks  is always displayed as 0.
