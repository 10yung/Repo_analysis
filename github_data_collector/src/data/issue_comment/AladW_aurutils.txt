Fixing some more breakage. In particular #636 surfaced again.
1. First try to retrieve data from custom pacman.conf, then from default.
1. Default is pacman-extra.conf (instead of pacman-multilib.conf

The Github wiki could be a place for practical examples for beginners and a repository for gems like https://github.com/AladW/aurutils/issues/641
It might also save you having to read some [painful reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/dzm6h1/understanding_aurutils_setting_up_an_easytouse/) on aurutils usage :)
Tests are running the installed aurutils, where we should be testing the scripts in `lib/aur-*` instead.

This could be solved by placing a new `aur` script with the customized `AUR_LIB_DIR` early on `PATH` or by removing the limitations we imposed and make `aur` respect `AUR_LIB_DIR` at runtime, allowing us to set AUR_LIB_DIR appropriately on each test.
Rewrite of `aur-fetch` to implement features such as
- ~ability to choose between `git reset (default)`/`pull --rebase` to update cached repos. (discard local commits vs trying to reapply local commits on top of the incoming changes)~ #639
- ~ability to choose between a `git log` or `git diff` to generate review patches.~ #640
- fetch packages in parallel
Initially this PR removed aur-vercmp-devel and introduced documentation changes that were biased towards a repo-based workflow for vcs packages.

Since these are actually two actions, the removal was split into PR #622.
EDIT: Using `master` branch.

With `mongodb-bin` available,

```bash
$ aur sync unifi --provides
==> Using [aur] repository
  -> mongodb: (none) -> 4.0.12-1
  -> python2-scons: (none) -> 3.1.1-1
  -> unifi: 5.10.25-1 -> 5.10.26-1
    dependency mongodb satisfied by mongodb-bin
```
still tries to install `python2-scons`, which should not be needed if `mongodb-bin` is fulfilling the `mongodb` dependency of `unifi`.

If a dependency is satisfied via `--provides`, I would expect the leaves of that dependency tree to also be pruned. In this case, it seems like only `mongodb` is being pruned, but not its (make) dependency `python2-scons`.

`parallel` is bulky and has questionable ethics regarding licensing (i.e. ignoring https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#RequireCitation as a GPL-licensed project). Look for some alternatives as suggested in #579.
pacutils gained some functionality to automatically solve conflicts:

https://github.com/andrewgregory/pacutils/commit/4d3251a435581363d5e3e922accf923d6f9a9f66

This could be used to implement the elusive "batch interaction" for non-chroot builds. Problematic is that pacman calls for installing dependencies are beyond our control in `makepkg -s`.
This is another big one so we should have some plan + prerelease cycle. I propose the following:

General:
- [x] Remove `aur-jobs` (#579)
  * The script is only used in `aur-sync`/`aur-srcver` and has no non-trivial functionality otherwise.
- [x] Rename `aur-rpc` to `aur-query` (#580)
  * "rpc" describes the protocol, while "query" describes the intent.
- [x] Replace `aur-vercmp-devel` with `aurvcs(7)` (#511)
  * See https://github.com/AladW/aurutils/issues/511#issuecomment-508938979
- [ ] Update the changelog
  * @rafasc started work on this, see https://github.com/rafasc/aurutils/commit/6bb045d25bf04fb0612ddb5a487f61b5512d0975
- [x] Replace `AUR_COLOR` with `NO_COLOR` (#599)
- [ ] Documentation updates
  * [ ] `aur-build`
  * [ ] `aur-repo`
  * [ ] `aur-sync`
  * [ ] `aur-chroot`
  * [ ] `aur-fetch`

`aur-chroot`:
- [ ] Use static `pacman.conf` for chroot (#655)
  * Remove`-d`

`aur-build`:
- [x] Remove the `SHELLOPTS` workaround, implement `AUR_DEBUG` in `aur` instead.
- [x] Only remove temporary files on clean exit (#593)
- [x] Expose common makepkg options (compare `aur-sync`)
- [x] Remove default options to `makepkg` (#635)

`aur-fetch`:
- [x] Add `AUR_SEEN`
- [x] Add `--rebase` to preserve local commits, `--reset` for the previous behavior (#639)
- [x] Add `--results` to indicate if a given `git` repo was cloned, or fetched (#379, #639)
- [x] Add `--format`

`aur-repo`
- [x] Add `--table` (#607)
- [x] Add `--path` (#649)

`aur-srcver`:
- [x] Remove `parallel` usage (#583)
