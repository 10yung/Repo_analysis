Hi all,
Is it possible to get total number of calls per recording and per time point?

For example- I recorded mice for 6 min and I would like to get the total number of calls as well as number of call in min 1, min 2, min 3 etc..


Thanks!

When running Unsupervised Clustering with 128 files, I get the following errors during file loading:

```
Output argument "ClusteringData" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "CreateClusteringData".

and

The loading freezes at file 40/128. I don't know in what order DS loads the files. If you can tell me that, I can send you the offending detection file.
After detecting calls with a trained network and editing some of the boxes with saving the file inbetween I run it through a classification network. 

However for the classification to work the .mat needs to be loaded in, which fails.

This sometimes happens to me and I do not know why this occurs. When I try just loading the .mat file into Matlab by drag and drop this gives me also an error message saying cannot load file X. 

This is the error message that pops up:

Error using load

Error in

Do you have a solution for me to rescue that file?

Cheers,

I get a warning stating "Upper range above sampling frequency" and then a ton of lines of "Lowering threshold" -- I assume the first means that my audio file doesn't have calls that reach the maximum frequency set... but I am wondering what the lowering threshold means

Hi!

I'm using the 2018b Matlab version on Windows 10.

I have been using the Long_Rat_Call_Network_V2 to detect (mostly) successfully over the last couple of weeks. The only time I've gotten an error was when there weren't any calls actually present in the .wav file (which makes sense). However, for the last couple of files, I have been getting an error when trying to use the Long Rat_Call_Network_V2 for detection, even though there definitely are calls present in the file. Basically the .mat detection file is created, but I am unable to load it. I have tried using the Short Rat_Call_Network_V2 which does work, however it also detects a lot of noise and double (or tripple) counts the calls since they are longer. 

I have been using the same set of parameters for all previous detections, and it has worked fine. There shouldn't be a difference in the file itself, so the error is a bit odd.

I'm attaching screenshots here:

Perhaps this issue has already been raised, but my programming skills aren't very advanced so I wasn't sure! 

Thank you in advance :) 






When I first start DeepSqueak with Matlab 2019b (on MacOS 10.14.6) I get the following

Hi Kevin and Russell,

I am running into a bit of a problem with long 22kHz rat calls. The detector tends to only detect portions of the long calls, and it is not usually possible to manually correct this because the view is zoomed so that the ends of the call are usually cut off. I think this must be because the long calls tend to have small breaks in the sound, but I would like to count them as one call unless they are separated by at least 20ms (like in Wright et al.). I would also like to do this for short calls, as sometimes the detector bins calls which are temporally quite separate together, and sometimes splits up what I would count as a single call. Is there a way to do this? I have used your detectors as well as training my own, and I seem to always have the same outcome.

Thanks for all your help!

Hi,

I've been trying to retrain the existing mouse call network to detect pup calls since the original network is missing more than half of the calls in my files compared to manual counting. I tried to retrain the network with around 20 3-minute audio files, but it it seems like it's still missing a large chunk of the calls. Is there any way to modify the sensitivity to allow the network to recognize the calls that are missing? Or do I need to feed more files into the network in order for it to recognize these calls that it's missing?

Thanks and have a good weekend!

Hi,

when I train a supervised classifier to discriminate between two different call types I eventually get a confusion matrix, showing how many of the calls were correctly and how many very incorrectly classified. 

Is there a way that I can look at the misclassified calls and see whether they share some similar features to get a feeling which calls are confusing the classifier?

Thank you,
Isa
Dear Kevin and Russell,

I have been trying to train the existing all short calls network with the manually isolated ultrasonic vocalizations of mice. However, I am encountering the following error when I try the training option:

These are the training images.

Is the problem due to the version of MATLAB? I would be very grateful, if you have a look at the problem. Thank you in advance for your help.
