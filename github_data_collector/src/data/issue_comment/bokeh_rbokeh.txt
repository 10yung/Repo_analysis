Hello, I'm working on a shiny app that shows a grid of graphs. I would like to be able to place the legend outside the graphs, either with one legend next to each graph, or one legend for the whole grid of graphs, since they are using the same color/shape attribute. Is this possible, maybe with a hack of some kind? The issue being that the automatic legend for rbokeh appears on the graph, and often blocks data points.

Thank you!
If I have already a complex plot in `ggplot2`, is it possible to transform it into a `rbokeh` plot? I used for a while `plotly::ggplotly()` with a low degree of success.

I am really a fan of what you did and I would love to use some of its functionalities. Thanks a lot in advance!
Hello, I was wondering whether there is something in rbokeh that mimics the "span" functionality in bokeh. I want to create an infinite horizontal line on my rbokeh graph, and I have not been able to find any way to do this in rbokeh so far. 
Hi,

I am using trelliscopejs with rbokeh for the first time and encountered some issues when i tried to create a trellis of around 740 pages with each page containing 4 scatter plots and each scatter plot has around 200 points

I have managed to created the webpage but there seems to be some plots that take an indefinite time to load

Strangely , when I display them one by one, they are fine

The json file size seems to be quite small as well

Does this occurs because I have too much pictures to display ?
 
Here is a simple example of barplot expressed in Rbokeh.

    library(rbokeh)
    
    # total yield per variety
    figure() %>%
      ly_bar(variety, yield, data = lattice::barley, hover = TRUE) %>%
      theme_axis("x", major_label_orientation = 90)

Result are shown as below

**Question 1)**
I want to plot bars, reordered on x-axis by yield in descending order

I know that there's simple way of doing this in ggplot with 'reorder' function, but have no idea how to do this in Rbokeh.

How can I do this?

**Question 2)**
 Running the code above, I can see this error message, what does this mean and how can I solve this problem?

Hi,

Thanks for the awesome package. The hover doesn't work when I flip the x and y variable.

For this example, the hover works and I can see 3 value showed up (variable, value, color):

```R
diamonds <- ggplot2::diamonds %>% top_n(n = 10)
figure() %>%
  ly_bar(x = cut, y = carat, color = color,
         data = diamonds, position="dodge", hover=TRUE) %>%
         x_axis(label = "Cut") %>%
         y_axis(label = "Carat")
```

However, when I flipped the x and y-axis, the hover doesn't work anymore. See example below:

```R
diamonds <- ggplot2::diamonds %>% top_n(n = 10)
figure() %>%
  ly_bar(y = cut, x = carat, color = color,
         data = diamonds, position="dodge", hover=TRUE) %>%
         x_axis(label = "Carat") %>%
         y_axis(label = "Cut")
```

I tried using the version via devtools and from CRAN. Both have same output.

Thanks!
I have seen that having `legend_orientation` was planned for release back in 2016, but I don't think that it was ever implemented. Would that be something to add to the next CRAN release?
Thanks
It would be good to be able to use the bokeh `click_policy` functionality, which lets you click on the legend to hide and show classes.  See https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction/legends.html

In terms of where to put this in the interface, if there isn't going to be a distinct `legend` function, then I think the way the API should look is that in the call to `figure`, the user can specify a `list()` of additional options which get converted to json and passed to the `bokeh` js.  

So to add click policy the call might be `figure([some stuff], options=list(legend=list(click_policy='hide')))` 


Hi, thanks for rbokeh, I've been looking into it from htmlwidgets, it looks great!

I'm trying to figure out how to build a web app without shiny and rbokeh seems very promising. However I can't find any information linking rbokeh to the [bokeh server](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/server.html). I've also searched[ rbokeh docs](http://hafen.github.io/rbokeh/) for any mention of server but couldn't find any.

Is it possible to use the bokeh server to serve rbokeh apps? 
@hafen FYI Bokeh 1.0 has been released. Let me know if I can help get an updated RBokeh ready (I will not be around most of November, but can help before/after)
