Now you can use `CustomBackground` and `CustomForeground` for the ColorZone if you choose `Custom` as its mode because sometimes you need your own colors like for a GroupBox or something

Update Flat and Outlined button border brush and ripple feedback based on [material.io documentation](https://material.io/components/buttons/)

**Changes Preview:**

`<TextBox materialDesign:TextFieldAssist.HasFilledTextField="True" materialDesign:TextFieldAssist.DecorationVisibility="Hidden" BorderThickness="0" />`

Underline is still shown. Not shown if `HasFilledTextField="False"`

If I have some free time this week I'll fix it myself.
### **Overview**

Hello,

We are now implementing the library into a relatively big/complicated system (with about 200 screens).

Keeping developing the system, we have found the problem; The button's ripple effect can only get fired AFTRE the corresponding function is all finished. So, there is some gap (especially when the processing is heavy(3-4 seconds seriously)). 

Our understanding of the main purpose or concept of the Material Design's micro  interaction(ripple effect) is letting users know that their action is successfully started so they can avoid confusion. Therefore accordingly, we do not think the current move is appropriate leading our users interviewed to the answers " When we click the buttons, we don't know what's happening" And we believe that this issue should be fixed on the library layer.

### **Code**
XAML file    
----------------------
    <!-- EmpButton derives from Button -->
    <cc:EmpButton
        Style="{StaticResource EmpButtonStyle.Plain}"
        Command="{Binding RefreshCommand}"
        Content="一覧を更新"/>
----------------------

ViewModel file 
----------------------
    RefreshCommand.Subscribe(() =>
    {
        //heavy method… like getting data from servers
        RefreshUketsukePatientList(false);
    });
----------------------

### **What we tried (and failed)**
Firstly, we tried to asyncronize the method. However, UI processing methods(like ones  opening a dialog) didn’t let us do so. Plus we already have got synchronous codes that we cannot touch. Then we gave up.

Secondly, we tried to overcome it by creating and using a wrapper letting us execute methods aftre ripple effect has been completed. But it had shown several side effects; Not opening dialogs and not showing messages etc. So we decided not to use the way as well.

### **So please help us**
It is our pleasure if you could change the timing of the effect to start BEFORE the function runs. Please ask questions if you do not see what I meant above (Because of my English and so forth)

Thank you so much. 

I have added character counter to text field.
It is visible when both MaxLength is non-zero and (new) TextFieldAssist.ShowCharacterCounter is true. Only TextBox is supported because calculating RichTextBox's length is non-trivial and I don't think PasswordBox needs one.
I implement this via cloning (thus duplicating) styles: there is no Text property on TextBoxBase.

Hi, i want make my Textbox Hint Horizontal Alignment to center, but i can't do it because of this lines in SmartHint.cs file. I try to copy all SmartHint templates and change this property but this code will change style properties after all XAML setters and i finally use an event trigger and storyboard to do this.

Hello,

the following issue is reproducible in the demo application, so I have not prepared a demo repo.

Description
-------------
If there is an editable combobox near the bottom of the screen, the calculation of the popup position seems to be incorrect. The normal windows combobox behavior is to have the popup placed above the combobox so that the bottom of the popup aligns with the top of the field. With MaterialDesign, it seems that the bottom of the popup aligns with the bottom of the screen, which leads to a look that is probably not intended.

Steps to reproduce
---------------------
- Open the demo application
- Go to the "Fields" section
- Move the window so that the "At least 8 characters" HelperText of the Password control aligns with a normal height windows taskbar (see screenshot 1)
- Open the "Fruit" combobox

You should be seeing something roughly like screenshot 2. The popup is positioned incorrectly and the transparent part of the popup that should contain the editable textbox of the Fruit combobox now contains the OS combobox. If the popup is supposed to cover the combobox then the transparent part needs to be at the bottom of the popup. In any case, the list of items should all be displayed above the combobox

Thanks for your time in advance,
David
