clink was set up as 
`"clink.bat" inject --quiet`

and in QT creator I getting an errors

![](https://i.gyazo.com/b0a44e8fa948377fc810c69c4c53254b.png)

Problem not in MSVC, I'm using MinGW!!! 

Also, I can't build projects in QT creator when clink is injected.

it's possible to configure **Clink** to avoid that errors?

I almost always get a duplicated MOTD when logging in via SSH, while other times the message is only printed once. I'm connecting to Ubuntu 18.04 using Clink 0.4.9.

This happens even if I comment out the following lines in `/etc/pam.d/sshd`:
```
session    optional     pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic
session    optional     pam_motd.so  noupdate
```

and set `PrintMotd` yes in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, or vice versa. It also doesn't matter if I include or exclude the contents in `/etc/update-motd.d` in the MOTD (i.e. only print the "Last login:", message).

However, the message in `/run/motd.dynamic` is not duplicated. It's as if that file is printed twice on login.

I previously posted this on Stackexchange, but it doesn't replicate in Cygwin so I figured it must be a Clink problem. I've tried suggestions given in other threads on SE, but usually duplicates seem to be the result of having MOTD activated in both SSH and PAM at the same time, which is not the case here.

In [Microsoft Windows Terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal) Preview on Windows 10 Version 1903, clink appears to be somewhat unstable and show erratic behavior. It could of course be caused by Windows Terminal itself. however, Windows Terminal now uses the new Pseudo Console API, which could mess with clink?

Issues I have seen:

* Pressing Ctrl+L repeatedly crashes prompt window entirely and leaves cmd.exe at 100% CPU load
* Alt+Backspace often doesn't remove entire word, and afters inserting new characters result in strange behaviour.

None of the issues are totally consisten. I've tried clink 0.4.7, 0.4.9 and 1.0.0a1
There is a link to extending clink in its [website][clink-website] and in the github [readme][clink-ghub-readme]. Both these links lead to [clink.md][clink-md-doc] page which is `TODO`.

However, the clink installation folder has a `clink.html` file which has a completed section on **Extending clink**. I haven't read that part of the document yet, but I think that should go in the [clink.md][clink-md-doc] document.

Not sure if there is a minimum Windows version, but this is needed
on newer versions of Windows 10 (1903+) with the new Windows Terminal
application. https://github.com/microsoft/terminal

Without this fix the prompt is wrapped based on the number of characters - ***including*** the ANSI escape sequences.  Also, if the line is wrapped in the middle of an escape sequence the output can be corrupt.

This fixes the 0.4.9 release.  I haven't been able to get any of the v1.0 alphas working with my lua scripts.
and is there any documentation for writing the lua extensions? Want to customise via cmder, but have no idea where to get started
Works perfectly with Clink 0.4.9.

Fails with Clink 1.0.0.a1.
```
C:\>clink set history_io 1

1. Why was this removed.
2. Can it be added back.
[Cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder) team is attempting to integrate Clink 1.0.0 Alphas and getting this error upon starting Cmder:

```

Cmder relies on this argument to load extra lua from `%cmder_root%\vendor` so we can have a package default lua config while setting the `--profile` to `%cmder_root%\config`  for user unique lua config using the following startup code:

```
:: Pick right version of clink
if "%PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%"=="x86" (
    set architecture=86
    set architecture_bits=32
) else (
    set architecture=64
    set architecture_bits=64
)

if "%CMDER_CLINK%" == "1" (
  %lib_console% verbose_output "Injecting Clink!"

  :: Run clink
  if defined CMDER_USER_CONFIG (
    if not exist "%CMDER_USER_CONFIG%\settings" (
      echo Generating clink initial settings in "%CMDER_USER_CONFIG%\settings"
      copy "%CMDER_ROOT%\vendor\clink_settings.default" "%CMDER_USER_CONFIG%\settings"
      echo Additional *.lua files in "%CMDER_USER_CONFIG%" are loaded on startup.\
    )
    "%CMDER_ROOT%\vendor\clink\clink_x%architecture%.exe" inject --quiet --profile "%CMDER_USER_CONFIG%" --scripts "%CMDER_ROOT%\vendor"
  ) else (
    if not exist "%CMDER_ROOT%\config\settings" (
      echo Generating clink initial settings in "%CMDER_ROOT%\config\settings"
      copy "%CMDER_ROOT%\vendor\clink_settings.default" "%CMDER_ROOT%\config\settings"
      echo Additional *.lua files in "%CMDER_ROOT%\config" are loaded on startup.
    )
    "%CMDER_ROOT%\vendor\clink\clink_x%architecture%.exe" inject --quiet --profile "%CMDER_ROOT%\config" --scripts "%CMDER_ROOT%\vendor"
  )
) else (
  %lib_console% verbose_output "WARNING: Incompatible 'ComSpec/Shell' Detetected Skipping Clink Injection!"
)
```
As you can see we use the `--scripts [path]` argument to point at an additional config dir for including additional lua code.  Startup with Clink 0.4.9 results in:

Currently, the prompt color can be easily customized:

However, I'd like to add a space between the prompt and the command (like in PowerShell), as I find it easier to read.

Would it be possible to have a built-in setting for this? This way, users wouldn't have to fiddle with writing a custom prompt in Lua to have this feature :slightly_smiling_face:
