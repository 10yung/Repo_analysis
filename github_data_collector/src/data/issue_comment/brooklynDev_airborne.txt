Hello! I love what you've built here and want to help maintain it. I see multiple folks have offered to help maintain but I've noticed you haven't been active in years ( #134 ). I hope all is well. I have a growing concern that this project won't receive any more attention and will eventually become useless. That would be a shame!

What do you need? Would you like to completely transfer ownership to someone else? What can I do to help?
Using Faraday I am also able to make changes to the URL from the base url 


```carrierwave was resolved to 1.2.2, which depends on
      mime-types (>= 1.16)

    carrierwave-base64 was resolved to 2.6.1, which depends on
      mime-types (~> 3.0)

    airborne was resolved to 0.0.18, which depends on
      rest-client (>= 1.7.2, ~> 1.7) was resolved to 1.8.0, which depends on
        mime-types (< 3.0, >= 1.16)

 rails (~> 5.1.5) was resolved to 5.1.5, which depends on
      actionpack (= 5.1.5) was resolved to 5.1.5, which depends on
        rack-test (>= 0.6.3)

    airborne was resolved to 0.2.13, which depends on

seems that dependency on rack-test and mime-types need to be updated for what rails 5.1.5 are locked to
Some of the api's we're testing require xml, is it possible to use airborne for this?  Also how do I find out all the header options that airborne does support?
I would love to be able to use this type of response validation without making an HTTP request but instead operating directly on JSON that I already have but unless I'm missing something this isn't currently possible with this library.
Hi, I was trying to test out the response headers. And the response header is something like `"X-TV-subscriptionId": "12345678"`, and I tried to `expect_header "X-TV-subscriptionId", "12345678"` and it returns false, it will return true only if I do `expect_header "x_tv_subscriptionid", "12345678"`.

Wondering is this behaviour intended? As headers are case sensitives anyway, case switch is not an issue for me. But converting hyphen into underscore is breaking my test.

Many thanks in advance.

**Update**: looks like even `expect_header :X_tv_subscriptionid, "12345678"` will return a false? The downscore is not working?
Hi, I'm trying to test an api call with JSON array as the body:

`
post "/accounts/#{id}/subscriptions", body, header`

For the body, it is a JSON array like ["12345", "23456"] instead of a hash. Can I do that in airborne?

Thank you very much.
