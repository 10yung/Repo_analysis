Hello,
Here is the fix to Bug 624. The fix follows the agreed behavior (see emails from around October 25) . For the sake of convenience see the agreed behavior below:

_"- first, check the xml-file. If it contains illegal shortcut duplicates, refuse importing. Shortcut duplicates are LEGAL if default settings also have those operations with the matching shortcuts. A refusal to import shortcuts must happen with the message that warns the user of a failure and explains the reason. 

- if the xml-file looks ok, import the shortcuts. As discussed before, because different versions of Audacity might have different sets of operations with shortcuts, it is still possible to end up with illegal shortcut duplicates for a perfectly correct xml-file. This situation must be monitored. In case of any conflicts, the shortcut from the xml-file is used, and the pre-existing shortcut is wiped clean.

When telling the user the commands which have had their shortcut removed, I think it would be useful to tell the user the name of the command, the shortcut, and and name of the command which still has that shortcut."_

I didn't find a clean way to intercept the imported content before it makes its way to the shortcut preferences, so I had to jump through some hoops right in KeyConfigPrefs::OnImport().
In general, I tried to keep changes minimal.

MacOS High-Sierra 10.13.6, audacity version 2.3.3.

in the saving-project-as window....
when i try to use all the keyboard commands, like copy, paste or Command+a [mark all], it fail or screw things up:
when i try to paste something into the text, it instead reset it and paste my thing INSTEAD of what was in the box already, for example if i wrote ''some file name from today'' and i mark only the ''today'' or the spot after the word, in either case when i try to paste something like ''2020-01-12'' it instead erasing everything up and putting just the ''2020-01-12'' over,
like so:
some file name from today .aup
turn to
2020-01-12.aup
instead of 
some file name from today 2020-01-12.aup
or
some file name from 2020-01-12 .aup

as for all the other stuff like copy and mark all, they just make some system sound and fail....
right click and choosing the options like copy and paste from the menu work fine btw.

its been really bugging me for a while now, giving me so much hell, and also so many times i forgot audacity do it, writing some long name and then pasting something in the end only to get all what i wrote beforehand deleted, and i can't undo ect' coz the undo also fail like copy and mark-all and just do the system sound, and undo don't even exist in the rightclick menu....

i tried to update right now from 2.3.2 to 2.3.3 in hopes you fixed it, but sense you didn't then you might not be aware about this bug....

so please fix? its driving me like crazy, thanks for reading.
Currently on Linux, Audaicty creates `$HOME/.audacity-data` directory. Please follow XDG base directory specification to avoid cluttering `$HOME`.
**Bug Description**
The "Export2:" Method from the macro / scripting section opens an export dialog.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to 'Tools'
2. Go to 'Macros'
3. Click on 'New'
4. Enter a name
5. Add a new Step
6. Select "Export2"
7. Apply macro on Project
8. See export dialog

The bug also ocours if you trigger the method via scripting (through the pipe).

**Expected behavior**
The export should be done in the background without promting a dialog.
The method is documented here: [https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/scripting_reference.html](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/scripting_reference.html)

**Additional information (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Windows 10
 - Version: Audacity 2.3.3

Thank you guys for your work! :-)
As discussed on audacity-quality list.
I'm trying to get the start and end times of the current selection for scripting purposes but I have only managed to _set_ the time via `SelectTime:`.

I am looking for some command `GetTime:` which returns the information that is displayed in the audio position toolbar:
