What UNetbootin is trying to load with Osascript on Mac using additional privileges? I'm really concerned on the security of this tool. Where can I see the script that it runs? How can I rollback changes made by it if I stopped script (it just doesn't respond)? And yes, it hasn't installed anything visible. Just non-responding process.

Version is 675
On Windows 7 and above, progress bars can be shown in the Taskbar like so:

It would be nice to show extraction/installation progress on Unetbootin's taskbar icon this way too. Since the app itself has a progress bar already, all the required information is already present.

Added new language(Korea)
When attempting to use unetbootin 675 to install FreeDos 1.0 to a flash drive, I noticed that the `syslinux.cfg` is setup to load `menu.c32`, which does not exist. When booting from the drive, `syslinux` reports that it failed to load `menu.c32`. There also is no `ubnkern` file, which is also referenced.

My syslinux is version `6.04.pre2.r11.gbf6db5b4-3`

```
pacman -Ql syslinux | grep menu.c32
syslinux /usr/lib/syslinux/bios/cmenu.c32
syslinux /usr/lib/syslinux/bios/libmenu.c32
syslinux /usr/lib/syslinux/bios/menu.c32

```

```
# FreeDOS 1.0
$ cat /mnt/syslinux.cfg

append initrd=/ubninit 

$ ls /mnt
ldlinux.c32  ldlinux.sys  syslinux.cfg	ubninit
```

As a sanity check, I tried arch linux. It also references but did not install a `menu.c32`.

```
# Arch linux (core)
$ cat /mnt/syslinux.cfg 
default menu.c32

When downloading and extracting ubuntu 19-10 the total file size is shown as 17592186042669MB (around 17.5 exabytes), which obviusly is a bit high, even for a big distribution like Ubuntu
