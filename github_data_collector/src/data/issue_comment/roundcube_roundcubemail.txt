Hey folks - pretty simple stuff: I'm fishing around the RC UI for a link to the main RC site, and there's none I could discover. Maybe there is one, but then it's well-enough hidden to escape my search.

Could you please add a link to RC.net (or something) to the About pop-up, or some common-sense place like that?

Thanks!
We upgraded to Roundcube 1.4.2 last week.

One of my users just reported that they received a bounce from a LISTSERV mailing list that they subscribe to:

```
Your message contains a QUOTED-PRINTABLE encoded composite MIME part, which is
not allowed by Internet standards (see  RFC2045, section 6.4, paragraph 5). In
plain English, an error in your mail program, or in a firewall or mail gateway
between your computer and LISTSERV, has caused  an error in the format of your
message.
```
RFC2045 , section 6.4, paragraph 5 states:

```
Certain Content-Transfer-Encoding values may only be used on certain
media types.  In particular, it is EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN to use any
encodings other than "7bit", "8bit", or "binary" with any composite
media type, i.e. one that recursively includes other Content-Type fields.  
```

A brief test with a message which triggers quoted-printable encoding ("£££" in the message text is my normal approach to trigger quoted-printable) and an attachment does indeed seem to indicate a change in behaviour somewhere between Roundcube 1.0.12 (that we were previously running) and Roundcube 1.4.2.

I attach a test message that I generated (later updated to be copy from my sent folder):

[Test.eml.txt](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/files/4054959/Test.eml.txt)

The significant bit is:

```
Content-Type: multipart/mixed;
  boundary="=_7b1d300b2c34571f16e451985990c4b7"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
```
where the "Content-Transfer-Encoding:" line is new.

I don't see this with Roundcube 1.0.12 running on the same machine.

I'm used to a certain behaviour from (neo)mutt that would make my life easier in roundcube as well: When composing a new message, the currently opened folder is automatically selected as the "Save sent message in" folder. This should of course be a new option, because it departs from current behavior.
I do like the new elastic theme but it does block the ui while refreshing and I do have to wait quit often before I can continue with working on my mails. 

I have many message folders with messages from 20 years, maybe this is the issue, but still, this does not happen with larry...

_Edit: It does happen with Larry as well_
The size of emails is not visible with Elastic theme.

The most useful place for that is in the list of emails, perhaps near the date. This could be shown/hidden by editing CSS if needed. Perhaps size could also be shown in the headers section of emails.
I recently started using the new Elastic skin. It is really great, thank you very much for all the effort!

One little drawback is the use of a 16x16px ICO-formated favicon, which looks blurry or even pixely on modern HiDPI screens.

There are multiple ways to approach this, and [this post][1] gets rather deep into that topic, with the small addition, that Chromium-based browsers [will support SVG-based favicons soon](https://caniuse.com/#feat=link-icon-svg) (finally!).

Whatever solution will be chosen, it will definitely polish the look of the new Elastic skin.

Currently Roundcube uses the [unique user id](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/blob/a9abe62d58df8a321591af30a9e02d1bd6b0f5dc/program/lib/Roundcube/rcube_user.php#L256) as the keyring identifier in [Mailvelope integration](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/blob/a9abe62d58df8a321591af30a9e02d1bd6b0f5dc/program/js/app.js#L3718). However, as I use GnuPG with YubiKey, it's impossible for me to import my private key into the Roundcube keyring and there doesn't seem to be a way of wiring the GnuPG keys into other keyrings in Mailvelope, either.

Is it possible to allow users to select the main/preferred keyrings from Mailvelope? I think it could also be more convenient for users in some cases if they simply want to share the same keys for different users/websites.

Hello,

when using roundcube via google chrome the web design is unresponsive (when resizing the window). 

The used resolution was 1080 x 2340 pixels, 19.5:9 ratio (~398 ppi density)

Thanks.
Using Roundcube with the elastic skin requires enabling the selection boxes to be able to select more than one message for bulk actions on messages. These boxes are disabled by default upon each login. It would be nice if there were a toggle option within the settings>Preferences menu to set the 'withselection' class as active for the message list so that the steps of activating the selection boxes does not need to be performed upon each login.
