Hello,

First of all, I want to say thanks for this awesome lib!

But I'm having some visual glitches when collapsing cells if total height of cells is less than screen size (e.g. having just one cell):

I was able also to reproduce this bug in demo project:

1) Change DemoTableViewController to return 1 instead of 100 `tableView(_: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection _: Int)` method
2) Launch app, select single cell
3) When clicking on `<`, cell collapse with a visual glitch

Any idea of how this can be fixed?

Thank you in advance,
Anton
The demo has some unusual setups that will take to understand without proper commenting, so i thought to just ask.  Why two back buttons on the detail view, and why does commenting one out or th other cause such erratic animation on the return to the main view?

And.. none of the buttons are hooked up, and my usual code techniques employed in many other apps to attach a tap gesture to a view are not working. A dropped button works but not the tap. I suspect your overlays may somehow be eating the tap (but then why does the button itself work?)
Is there a way that I can use it with Kingfisher to load the images run time from server?
Hi @RamotionRussell 

I'm trying to use this library with fullcode or programmatically not with storyboard or xib, so how to use this library or you can make example to use it. i'm very thanks for you 👍
