HI,

I have a wow animation :

`<nav class="navbar wow fadeInDown" data-wow-delay="0.5s" data-wow-duration=".5s" id="top-nav">...</nav>`

I would like to trigger a jquery function as soon as it ends.

Any help please?

Thanks 

Alex

Greetings,

First of all I'm not what we could call an experienced dev, so i'm sorry if my issue is not related to wow.js itself.

I'm trying to import an html page / template in an angular app & installed the required wow.js npm. Here is what it looks like in the console :

Here is my scripts array :

Here is the offending 'this' :

I googled the error but no luck.

Thank you

Google Code has closed down so the link no longer works -instead use `https://oss.maxcdn.com/html5shiv/3.7.3/html5shiv.min.js` which Bootstrap 3 uses: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/getting-started/#template
I have a problem with the wow library that only appears on smartphones: At the end of the animation, if I stop scrolling, the page goes up... Does anyone have an idea?
Hello! It seems the WOW version is v1.1.2 with npm (I mean the dist files), can you please confirm? Don't know if it's actually a local NPM issue.
I am trying to build the projdct with wow.js but it throws error in path while building ..but when I run in developement mode it does not give path error

if I remove that import of wow.js while build then error goes away...
