- What were you trying to do when the issue happened
I changed Download folder to ~/Documents
- If it is a hang (beach ball), please provide a process sample
I used Instruments.app and discovered that
`DownloadManager.updateDownloadedFlagsByEnumeratingFilesAtPath`
freezes the app because I changed Downloads folder to ~/Documents where I store all my files (50 Gb).
```
guard let enumerator = FileManager.default.enumerator(atPath: path) else { return }
guard let files = enumerator.allObjects as? [String] else { return }

```
`enumerator.allObjects` freezes the app because I have a lot of files in the Documents directory.

As a solution, we can disallow choosing an non-empty directory as Download folder.

Also there is no button to reset Download folder to default value. I think we should add this button. I can open Pull request with this button.
Hopefully this desired functionality can adequately be described as being the opposite of what the 'Downloaded' filter provides. Essentially displaying what videos have not yet been been download, allowing one to hone in on what videos may want to be added to the download queue.

This would be in addition to the existing downloaded indicator within each list cell, and would most likely (hopefully) have no bearing on this nicety.
As described in #578, the ConfCore.realm file can get quite big. Realm offers a way to re-save a database file in a way that compresses it. I remember trying to do this automatically a long time ago but having trouble getting it to work reliably.

Maybe something changed that would allow us to implement this now, or at least offer a manual way for the user to do so that doesn't require downloading another piece of software.
My MBP is running macOS 10.15 Beta (19A512f)
I'm running WWDC Version 6.1.2 

I have been going through the videos I wanted to see, using the filters Downloaded and Unwatched to ensure that I was always getting new one. But for a while the Unwatched filter has not been working. It could be that it stopped when I installed 10.15. Now, after watching a video to the end, it still shows up even when I have Unwatched switched on.

The videos I watched earlier are excluded and if I turn the Unwatched filter off, those ones come back to the list.

### If you answered YES to all of the questions, please provide as much information as possible about your issue.

- Version of macOS: 10.15
- Version of the app: 6.1.2
- What were you trying to do when the issue happened:
    Mark session as read

- If it is a wrong behavior, list all steps required to reproduce it:

What happened:
Trying to use the Mac OS standard approach of Ctrl-Click for context menu does not work.

What did happen:
Only a two finger click summons the context menu.  I was hours into the using the app, was frustrated with anther bug in which watched sessions were not recorded as such, and was hoping for a way to mark watched sessions as watched. To be sure it wasn't my keyboard, I double checked with the keyboard viewer, and again with a browser to make sure there wasn't some change in the routing of secondary-click messages

What should happen:
The WWDC app should support both modes for control-click: two finger tap, and Ctrl-Click (as is the case for every other Mac app that I have tried).

How to reproduce:

Open app, hover over left / index column, hold down control and tap the trackpad.  Nothing happens.  Only doing a double-tap with a trackpad seems to work.


Great app though - thanks!
There are three colours in the playback progress indicator -- the current time, the hovered time, & the background colour. The WCAG contrast ratio (not normally applied to two non-font elements, but ðŸ¤«) doesn't pass on simply the current + background colour, never mind the intermediary hover colour.

I suggest we increase the contrast between these elements to increase legibility.
When the user filters the amount of items in the left list decreases. It would be nice, also as motivation to watch more session videos, to know how much videos are left in the left list, e.g. when I activated the `unwatched` filter.
macOS 10.14.5
WWDC Version 6.1.2
The action "Add to Favorites" syncs via iCloud to my other Mac, but "Remove from Favorites" does not sync. Not a huge deal, but would be a nice-to-have feature.


It would be cool to provide an option in the settings to auto-delete watched session videos so they do not clutter up disk space.
