Hello,
I want to also select column name which are visible in view port.

The API example shows this:
"rowHeight": 35,       // constant row height (px)

Could this be changed dynamically?  For example, imagine row content that is actually very "tall", but by default only 1 line of that content is shown in a row.  Next, imagine you wanted to let users expand the row so its full content can be seen.

(How) Can this be done?

Are there any plans to do search bar?

I'm not sure if you intended this, but it seems as though the goTo and the setScrollXY conflict. That is, targetY seems to deal with the columns (inside of goTo) but in setScrollXY, the targetY variable would be used to scroll up and down. 

To get the goTo working, I actually changed the javascript code to (changed targetY and targetX):

``` javascript
TableView.prototype.goTo = function(i, j) {
    var targetX, targetY;
    targetY = i != null ? this.rowHeight * i : void 0;
    targetX = j != null ? this.columnOffset[j] : void 0;
    return this.scroll.setScrollXY(targetY, targetX);
};
```

Since the move to translation + move everybody I assume...

Who does that though? 

When you click your scroll-wheel (cursor changes to circle with an arrow in each direction) to scroll, the page only moves a few pixels in each direction.

Tested in Chrome.

Page Up, Page Down, Ctrl+Home, and Ctrl+End hotkeys do not work.
