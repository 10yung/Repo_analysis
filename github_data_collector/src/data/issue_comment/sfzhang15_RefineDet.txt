hi 

i want to use the refinedet_test.py to test the mAP of the model , and i copy the single_test_deploy.prototxt from deploy.prototxt. the error is TypeError: 'float' object has no attribute '__getitem__' . the mAP is {120000: 0.0}. is the single_test_deploy.prototxtn right? how to solve this issue?

best
