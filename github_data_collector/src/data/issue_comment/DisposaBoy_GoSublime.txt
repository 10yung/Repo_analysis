When typing in a manner that would normally cause the autocomplete to pop up, there is intense lag that seems to last for around a quarter of a second with no autocomplete suggestions appearing. A peek into the Sublime console shows messages that appear alongside the lag spikes:

```
[15:44:47] margo: agent#007: log: gocode.go:201: gocode didn't respond after 250ms taking 261ms
[15:44:47] margo: agent#007: log: gocode.go:176: gocode didn't accept the request after 101ms
[15:44:48] margo: agent#007: log: gocode.go:176: gocode didn't accept the request after 114ms
[15:44:48] margo: agent#007: log: gocode.go:192: gocode eventually responded after 1.384s
```

This behavior is observed no matter which package the autocomplete is running on. It occurs on both the `next` branch and the normal `development` branch.
The local repo for `github.com/mdempsky/gocode` is on commit `939b4a6`, the latest as of today. `which gocode` shows that it is correctly located in GOPATH's `bin` directory, which is also located in the path variable (Windows 10 64-bit).
I'm not super familiar with Sublime Text plugins, but some quick Googling pointed at `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/` (I'm on OSX).

Apparently if you `git clone https://margo.sh/GoSublime` into that directory, menu items show up but don't work, and `margo` never gets set up correctly. After banging my head against the wall for a while, I tried the same `git clone` up a directory, in `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages`, which immediately worked, and as a cherry on top created a `GoSublime` subdirectory of `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/` with the layout the rest of the docs implied.

This narrative is the long way of asking, any reason not to explicit put the correct plugin parent directory into https://margo.sh/b/migrate/ for each supported platform?
I switched to the development build of GoSublime and reinstalled it. Now I'm getting this error:

```

SublimeText version is 3.2.2 (Build 3211) , Go version is 1.13.4 and Python version is 2.7.17

I've tried reinstalling GoSublime several times but I'm still getting the same error.

GoImports on save will not add imports that are in `vendor/` but not in `$GOPATH`.  Running `goimports` from the terminal does not have this problem.
There is no way to pass argument to the goimports linter.  Previously this could be done with something like:

```
"fmt_cmd": ["goimports", "-srcdir", "$_dir", "-local", "github.com/gz-c/foo"],
```

Now it seems that the `Args` are buried inside here: https://github.com/KurokuLabs/margo/blob/45053645555797217b3f6df7d90975cbfae7e609/golang/gofmt.go#L47

In my case I use the `-local` flag to sort the imports differently.  It would need to be configured per-package.
If we have slice or array of struct, there are two options of literal syntax (Example A and B):

**Example A:**

```go
type Movie struct {
	Title  string
	Year   int  `json:"released"`
	Color  bool `json:"color,omitempty"`
	Actors []string
}

var movies = []Movie{
	{Title: "Casablanca", Year: 1942, Color: false,
		Actors: []string{"Humphrey Bogart", "Ingrid Bergman"}},
	{Title: "Cool Hand Luke", Year: 1967, Color: true,
		Actors: []string{"Paul Newman"}},
	{Title: "Bullitt", Year: 1968, Color: true,
		Actors: []string{"Steve McQueen", "Jacqueline Bisset"}},
	// ...
}
```

Example B:

```go
type Movie struct {
	Title  string
	Year   int  `json:"released"`
	Color  bool `json:"color,omitempty"`
	Actors []string
}

var movies = []Movie{
	Movie{Title: "Casablanca", Year: 1942, Color: false,
		Actors: []string{"Humphrey Bogart", "Ingrid Bergman"}},
	Movie{Title: "Cool Hand Luke", Year: 1967, Color: true,
		Actors: []string{"Paul Newman"}},
	Movie{Title: "Bullitt", Year: 1968, Color: true,
		Actors: []string{"Steve McQueen", "Jacqueline Bisset"}},
	// ...
}
```

In GoSublime auto complete struct fields only works Example B.

Hi GoSublime,

After installing Govendor this morning.
I found the error message appear on the sublime status bar, it says

_"margo.sublime build failed: press `super+.`,`super+x` to configure margo or check console for errors"_

but after I checked the log file, which saved under this location
_"/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/GoSublime/osx-x-64/log.txt"_

it didn't even updated since 3 days ago

Please anyone have any experienced like this before? what would I suppose to do? 
Thanks,
-gs
I was recently debugging a problem with goimports not working properly and found it wasn't working quite right when working with modules outside of the gopath, specifically importing internal packages within your module. I created a [quick fix](https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime/compare/development...cgilling:run_goimports_in_code_directory) for this for anyone who has this problem as well. (I haven't done a PR because I think the problem is actually in goimports code, but I got it working and haven't had the time to dig into goimports code)

Trying to install GoSublime now is a pita. Isn't easier to just leave it in package control?
