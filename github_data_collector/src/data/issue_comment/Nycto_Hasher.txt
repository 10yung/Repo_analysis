Please provide version for Scala 2.13.
Hello! I've added HmacSHA384 algorithm implementation. I think it must be here.
The README indicates that 1.2.1 is the latest release but it seems that [only 1.2.0 is available](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.roundeights%20AND%20a:hasher_2.12&core=gav).
I am having several failures when testing on Windows. Is that expected? I have seen [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) being used to test on Windows. Have you considered that?

Is there any reason for `Algo` being package private? In this case, how could I implement a new one?
Do you plan adding ECDSA implementation in Hasher lib ?
