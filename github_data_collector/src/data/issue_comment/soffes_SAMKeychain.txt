We store an encrypted string in keychain as the password for Touch ID or Face ID login,but some of our users fail to load this string which make them unable to use Touch ID/Face ID login, is there any bugs that will cause this problem.BTW,most of the abnormal devices are iPhone X with iOS 12.0.1
Hi .. with iOS 12` [NSKeyedArchiver archivedDataWithRootObject:object];` is Deprecated.. 
```
- (void)setPasswordObject:(id<NSCoding>)object {
	self.passwordData = [NSKeyedArchiver archivedDataWithRootObject:object];
}
```
are there any updates for SAMKeychain?

Hi,
This PR is for Xcode 10 compatible.

In Xcode 10 (GM or later), We need to update watchOS Deployment Target version to 3.0 or later.
While using 2.0, We can build ipa but can't submit to App Store.

Same issue is discussed in Forum:
https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/108408

Thanks!
above, thanks!
This small PR just updates all project and scheme files for Xcode 10.
Thanks, Max
## Description

This PR updates the library to add support to Keychain Access Control features, including creation flags, which allows authentication using biometry.

It also deprecates `useNoAuthenticationUI` that was deprecated by Apple.

Lastly, it adds an utility to check if the device has passcode and/or biometry configured, and fixes a bug when setting properties that should be mutually exclusive. This last bit would cause a failure on queries.

## Note 

❌  Code is untested on macOS;
✅  But it's in production on iOS for several weeks now.
The crashed line is  -[SAMKeychainQuery save:] (in SAMKeychain) (SAMKeychainQuery.m:0)
in the iOS 11.3.1.
