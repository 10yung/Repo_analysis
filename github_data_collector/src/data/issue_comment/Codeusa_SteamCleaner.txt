Hi , I downloaded the binary file of your app and i know you used the MaterialDesignThemes package, but the binary file does not have any third party dlls like MaterialDesignThemes.Wpf.dll.

How you compile all files into one exe file?
Hi there,

i have small issue, that when running steam cleaner it deletes the Shared Redist' Folder steam is now using to consolidate all the Redist' into 1 directory vs every game having its own copy

"~\Steam\steamapps\common\Steamworks Shared"

this folder may be beneficial to keep since it serves many games with one set of redist, older games may not utilise this folder however and can be cleaned up as per what this tool is used for

There are some directories that are corrupt/unreadable in my Steam environment due to me moving some files around en masse.

However, with that Steam Cleaner doesn't have a valid try catch around looking through the directory and crashes on open.

I already replaced all the \r\n, and \n with newline characters - so the log should be a bit cleaner.

[UnhandledException_4-2-2019.json](https://github.com/Codeusa/SteamCleaner/files/3036556/UnhandledException_4-2-2019.log)

Specifically, it looks like the code in the AnalyzerService at function CheckNesting is the culprit.


Hi there, sometimes we don't run the installers before we use steamcleaner, so to help with that, a feature I suggest is a toggle box to run installers first and then delete them or to just delete without running them.  Sure, it'll take a little longer to delete the installers but we'll know our games will run without issues this way.
Hi !

I installed the games on other hard drives and SteamCleaner didn't look them.
How to do to specify directories on other hard drives ?
Thank you very much.

`default.exe` is deleted and the game can't be launched as a result.
