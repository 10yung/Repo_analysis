I've grown accustom to not quoting the right hand side of variable assignments,

```sh
var=$othervar
var=$(subshell)
var=value
```

This is perfectly safe in all POSIX shells (AFAIK). [Reference](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/68694/when-is-double-quoting-necessary).

Shellharden adds quotes to all of these. Do you consider this a bug?
