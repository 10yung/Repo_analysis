Hi,
I want to know which processing techniques you have done with the data.How can I process the data into '' MotorImagery.mat ''. Kindly reply back as soon as possible.

Thankyou.
Hi,

I am using your toolbox for classification of two-class Motor Imagery BCI. I use the datasetⅠ from the BCI competition IV. The time interval is restricted to the time segment comprised between 0.5 and
2.5s. But I do not filtered the data. And I use the method of "MDM classification - Binary case" .

However, the accuracy I calculated is only about 70%. Do you know where the problem is? Does filtering have a big impact on the results? I hope to get your reply as soon as possible.

Thank you
Hi, 

I am using your toolbox for classification of two-class MI BCI. However, it gives me this warning, "Warning : Nombre d'itï¿½rations maximum atteint" when I run MDM, Discriminant Geodesic + MDM and  Tangent Space LDA with reimann_mean. 

I even changed the number of iterations from 100 to 10000 and 20000 in the function of reimann_mean. But no use, Somehow, this condition nidter == niterations is always satisfied resulting in a warning.  Can I remove this if condition? Does this warning effects the classification accuracy? Kindly reply back as soon as possible.

Thankyou.
