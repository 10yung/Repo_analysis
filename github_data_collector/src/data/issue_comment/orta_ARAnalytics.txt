The RAC 2.x Objective-C APIs have been moved to [their own repo](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveObjC) so that the main ReactiveCocoa repo can focus on Cocoa bindings. We should update our DSL subspec to point to the new repo.
 After installing pods i am getting following compilation error

In file included from ~/TestProject/Pods/ARAnalytics/Providers/FirebaseProvider.m:3:
~/TestProject/Pods/Headers/Private/Firebase/Firebase.h:1:9: fatal error: 'FirebaseAnalytics/FirebaseAnalytics.h' file not found
#import <FirebaseAnalytics/FirebaseAnalytics.h>

My podfile looks like this -
```
# platform :ios, '9.0'
target 'TestProject' do 
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
use_frameworks!
pod 'ARAnalytics/Firebase'
end
```
After installing, cocoapods ends with warning:
`[!] AppsFlyer-SDK has been deprecated in favor of AppsFlyerFramework `
Currently, it seems that localizedFailureReason, localizedDescription, localizedRecoverySuggestion and localizedRecoveryOptions are being logged. Curiously, error domain and error code aren't logged. Often, this is the most pertinent information.

Case in point: I have some logged errors which only contains the description "The operation couldn't be completed", and no other information. This makes them hard to track.
I had my own category for ARAnalytics to extend it for my project but was limited by not having access to superProperties (since sharedInstance is not exposed either). For now, I'm using this fork in my Podfile, but thought this could go in the main project.

setupWithAnalytics missing support for Firebase (ARAnalytics 4.0.0)

Perhaps:  ARFIRAnalyticsKey

```
+ (void)setupWithAnalytics:(NSDictionary *)analyticsDictionary {
// ...
    if (analyticsDictionary[ARFIRAnalyticsKey]) {
        [self setupFirebaseAnalytics]; // :analyticsDictionary[ARFIRAnalyticsKey]];
    }

```

The properties dictionary that I'm passing in is a static dictionary (a. la. `@{ ... : ... }`
This doesn't happen every single time.

```
+ (void)event:(NSString *)event withProperties:(NSDictionary *)properties
{
    NSMutableDictionary *fullProperties = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithDictionary:properties];
    [fullProperties addEntriesFromDictionary:_sharedAnalytics.superProperties]; // CRASH HERE!!!

    [_sharedAnalytics iterateThroughProviders:^(ARAnalyticalProvider *provider) {
        [provider event:event withProperties:fullProperties];
    }];
}
```

```

I'm trying to use ARAnalytics in a OS X application with the Hockey App provider. I've successfully installed them with Cocopods, but after configuring it with

`[ARAnalytics setupWithAnalytics: @{
                                       ARHockeyAppBetaID : @"appKeyHere",
                                       }];`

if I log the current list of providers it's empty. It didn't add the provider.

Any idea of what is going on here?

Thanks in advance

I haven't dug into this fully yet, wondering if anyone here has come across this

When using both NewRelic and screen tracking via DSL, the app crashes when the first UIViewController that is being tracked is shown:

_Note: I'm installing NewRelic via it's own pod rather than via subspec because I run into a dynamic frameworks compatible issue_

Is there any other info I can give? Thanks

Would be great to have support for the aspect-oriented DSL style tracking in Swift.

I can get tracked screens and some events to come through, but for events, some selectors don't seem to work and can't figure out how to properly type the Properties callback.

The following is working for me for now:

```
let trackedEvents =  [
        [
            ARAnalyticsClass: AccountEditVC.self,
            ARAnalyticsDetails: [
                [
                    ARAnalyticsEventName: "Account Edit Save Button",
                    ARAnalyticsSelectorName: "saveChangesBtnTapped:"
                ],
            ]
        ]
   ]

let trackedScreens = [
     [
        ARAnalyticsClass: FeaturesVC.self,
        ARAnalyticsDetails: [[ARAnalyticsPageName: "Slideshow"]]
      ]
]
```

Can't figure out how to do properties though. And sometimes selectors that aren't IBOutlets are never called.
