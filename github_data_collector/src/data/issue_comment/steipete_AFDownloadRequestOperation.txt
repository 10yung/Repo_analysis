found if i got wrong url, the failureBlock cannot callback. because of the self.error is set by super.responseObject.

Changing import to allow AFDownloadRequestOperation to be built as a framework.

This method was not implemented so caused a compiler error

I'm using `AFDownloadRequestOperation` on my project, but when it receives 416 HTTP status (Requested Range Not Satisfiable), the success block is being called. So I created this fix: every time responseObject is accessed, it validates the response using the (default) `responseSerializer`, which checks acceptable HTTP status codes.

Adding to that, I removed `+ acceptableStatusCodes`  method that is not called on AFNetworking 2.0.

I hope this helps.

...he setter of targetPath and do all the stuff related to targetPath in the custom setter instead of initializer 3. overriding the designated initializer of superclass

I am still thinking on the best place to assert targetPath != nil before the operation is enqueued
