for all animations which support right/left (e.g. `SlideInLeft` and `SlideInRight`) there should be a variation for start/end (e.g. `SlideInEnd` and `SlideInStart`) to support right-to-left layouts.
I am getting this error when I use animation to show a view, how do I fix it?

I use this code for add view to main activity

```
View add = G.inflater.inflate(R.layout.loading, parent, true);
        contentLoading = add.findViewById(R.id.contentLoading);

        YoYo.with(Techniques.RubberBand)
                .onStart(animator->{contentLoading.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);})
                .duration(700)
                .playOn(contentLoading);
```

But `contentLoading` animation is wrong and not work correct
when I use  the method "onEnd" or "onStart" and so on, YoYo.AmimationComposer will add a callback in callbacks, which maybe cause the risk of memory leak.
In my opinion, We could add a method means "removeListenerAfterEnd" or other to remove callback in callbacks
what do you think
I tried using interpolator but it has no effect 

using `compile` is going to be obsolete, and I felt this library is very useful so it should be implemented with new gradle standard of `implementation`

调用如下代码隐藏view控件后，调用view.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);无法恢复显示，请问该如何处理
YoYo.with(Techniques.SlideOutUp).duration(300).onEnd(new YoYo.AnimatorCallback() {
                            @Override
                            public void call(Animator animator) {
                                view.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
                            }
                        }).playOn(view);
