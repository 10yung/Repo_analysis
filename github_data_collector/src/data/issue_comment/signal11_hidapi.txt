Hi 
I am using the hidlib to make a project both on windows and linux

    int res;
    unsigned char buf[65];
    buf[0] = 0x00;
    buf[1] = COMMAND MODE; //0xcc
    state->signature = SIGNATURE;
    memcpy(buf+2, state, sizeof(STATE));
    res = hid_write(handle, buf, 65);
    if(res == -1)
    {
        return -1;
    }
when I try on windows everything is work,but on linux "res" return -1. 
As I am creating an app in kivy python using buildozer a wrapper for python-for-android where a buildozer.spec file needs to be maintained and I simply wrote hidapi as requirement but it seems not working when says import hid
Basically, the idea is to allow users to configure hidapi without using iconv, as icvon may have dependencies that may not be supported
Hi there,
I can't find any U2F device when I use hid_enumerate(v_id, p_id) function in Window 10 (build 18362).
I try to test in Window 7, It's OK.

Please help me if you know the reason why.
Hi all,
I wrote a simple app to send data to LED strip device.
Using the library statically linked there are no problems.
Then I wrote another program with the library dynamically linked.
The device is not opened.
This is my code:

`

       lwsl_user("Devices:\n");
	struct hid_device_info* pInfo = pHidEnumerate( 0, 0);
	if (pInfo){
		struct hid_device_info* p = pInfo;
		while(p){
			lwsl_user("> %04X:%04X '%s' '%S' '%s'\n", p->vendor_id, p->product_id, p->path, p->manufacturer_string, p->product_string);
			p = p->next;
		}
	}
	else
		lwsl_user("- empty\n");
	// hid_free_enumeration(pInfo);
	// Open the device using the VID, PID,
	// and optionally the Serial number.
	wchar_t sn[80]={0};
	handle = pHidOpen(0x20A0, 0x41E5, sn);
	lwsl_user("fnOpen=%p sn='%S'\n", pHidOpen, sn);
	if (handle==0){
		lwsl_user(".. Device not found\n");
		return CMDRET_ERR;
	}	
	lwsl_user("> device handle: %X\n", handle);
	return CMDRET_OK;
`

This is the output:

`

Pointers ok. Open device ..
hid_init: 0
Lista devices:
 20A0:41E5 '0001:0027:00' '(null)' '(null)'
 14C8:0005 '0001:0003:00' '(null)' '(null)'
 0BDA:481A '0003:0002:ff' '(null)' '(null)'
fnOpen=0xb5dcda39 sn=''
.. Device not found
 closeLedStrip handle=0 hLibrary=80848690
`
The device is enumerated but not opened.
Any idea?

Thanks, regards
Hi There,

I would like to use hidapi in a program that I'll release under LGPL. As far as i know a LGPL program is not allowed to use GPL code. 

Can I still use hidapi in my LGPL code?
Witch of the following two licenses should I use?

https://github.com/signal11/hidapi/blob/master/LICENSE-bsd.txt
https://github.com/signal11/hidapi/blob/master/LICENSE-orig.txt

Cheers,
Cedric
Dear Sir,
Thank you for your library.

I assume that I plug my HID device to USB hub.
I try using SetupDiGetDeviceRegistryProperty(... , ... , SPDRP_LOCATION_INFORMATION, ...) in hid_enumerate() function
but I can't get port number.

Please let me know if you have an ideas for this case.
Thank you so much
hello 

i use your libraries Hid4Java on My Ubuntu 16.04

all is fine to detect devices and read them parameters

but when i call 
        HidDevice hidDevice = hidServices.getHidDevice(6753, 13904, null);
i have null result
it's a FreeStyle Libre device, and it's detectable with hidServices.getAttachedHidDevices()

i'm trying to find the problem , i'm sure it"s the Path
HidDevice [path=0001:0008:00, vendorId=0x1a61, productId=0x3650, serialNumber=null, releaseNumber=0x100, manufacturer=null, product=null, usagePage=0x0, usage=0x0, interfaceNumber=0]

but the function return Null , there is any problem with the path path=0001:0008:00 ?

if i can't to connect to the device , i can't communicate with him 

any suggestion ? Thank's a lot 
Hi:
   Thanks for such great project. Recently, I am using hidapi to test my bluetooth. On Ubuntu, I can communicate with my bluetooth devices when I link myproject with libhidapi_hidraw.so, things go well. But when i turn to windows, something goes wrong, I have compiled hiapi.lib && hidapi.dll successfully,  and i run the application hid-test, but none of my bluetooth found. Is hidapi support bluetooth on windows? Or what can cause this issue ?
As USB host, am5728 evm  board is connected with dlp module through USB HID V1.11.
The test function uses hidtest. in hidapi-master open source Running the test function on the ti am5728 evm board
 failed to call hid_open (). Why did the call to hid_open () fail? Do you need to write dlp driver on 5728 single board? 
 Usb1.0 and udev libraries are currently used. Are there any restrictions on the version of the library? Thank you!

The same test function can also correctly read dlp information in ubuntu, as follows:
[root@tl hid_test]# ./hid_test

There is a usbhid module on am5728 single board, but see hid code, there is no dlp drive, do you need to add dlp driver?
