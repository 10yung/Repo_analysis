Related to issue 129 from myexploit. All shells caught from win10 test machine from powershell generated by unicorn fail to load the stdapi extension and are non-responsive.  If you'd like I can upload the win10 test vm so you can duplicate the issue
This is not a issue but a request.

Could you guys create a function for unicorn to take custom .ps1 payloads and generate them into .hta payloads? This would be great, thanks.
