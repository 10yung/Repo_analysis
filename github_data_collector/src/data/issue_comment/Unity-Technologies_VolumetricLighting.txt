Hi,
Just updated to the last version of  VolumetricLighting and i'm using Unity 2019.2.15.

VolumetricFog script start killing my game performance (see pic) i'm using Enviro and ONE spot light ?!

Any help ?

Hi there I updated the readme to redirect to the HDRP volumetric fog and specified its a Legacy package. Also tested it up to 2019.3.0b12 and it works.

We're still using it in ourproject so keep it live :)

Thanks for everything
Best
Hi All
I am working with the last released Unity 2018.3.1f1 version and I got the following error

Compute shader (InjectLightingAndDensity): Property (_AreaLightShadowmap) at kernel index (0) is not set
UnityEngine.ComputeShader:Dispatch(Int32, Int32, Int32, Int32)

For it, Could anybody help me with that?
Thanks
Alejandro

I can't remember where I read this asset was discontinued and some of it integrated in Unity 2019.1
Might be worth putting something in the readme for those hoping that directional lights are still scheduled to be added soon?
Is this project still being actively developed? And if so, is there a roadmap for when things like directional lights will be working?
subject says it all
I have a test scene with an area light and some 3d objects as occluders for testing.  Here's what It looks like with just one area light turned on (intensity turned way up to help visualize):

There is a little bit of leaking, but shadows are mostly working.  When I add a second area light it seems to break the shadows.  Here is after a second light has been added, with 0 lighting contribution:

Here's a comparison between OpenGL and Metal. 
OpenGL 4.1:

Spotlights with light cookies supported?
Hi,

When frustrum is under 370 Far range (near does not affect this) height fog is allright, whenever a value is set above 370 then we got black pixel from the bottom.

< 370
