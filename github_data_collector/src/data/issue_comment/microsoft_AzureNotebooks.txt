Having created an iPython notebook I tried to download it as pdf.  A pdf file is created, but it doesn't contain all of the cells in the notebook, i.e. it is truncated.

### Required:
#### Which site did you access us from?
    [] https://notebooks.azure.com

#### Describe the issue you are encountering

I tried multiple times to create the pdf and the resulting document was truncated at different points in the file.  Here are the 3 examples

#### Describe the issue you are encountering

Installing additional packages takes enormous amount of time, hindering the use of notebooks in teaching. I would like to request to add the widely used geopandas library ( and dependencies) to the default stack, as a substantial enabler of better useability.

The dependencies are already mostly installed, with the exceptions of [http://geopandas.org/install.html]:

shapely (interface to GEOS)
fiona (interface to GDAL)
pyproj (interface to PROJ)
six

Further, optional dependencies are:
rtree (optional; spatial index to improve performance and required for overlay operations; interface to libspatialindex) important dependency!
psycopg2 (optional; for PostGIS connection)
geopy (optional; for geocoding)

For plotting, these additional packages may be used:

descartes
mapclassify

Wasn't able to open the terminal (yesterday it worked). There appear to be significant performance issues with Azure notebooks in the last few days.
Thanks for getting in touch. Python 3.7 is in the roadmap for later this year.

Question on the above quote for a closed issue: is there any firm plan on when PYthon 3.7 will be available in Azure Notebooks?
Thanks.

#### Describe the issue you are encountering

New notebook doesn't open as a notebook but as a text file.

#### What steps can we take to reproduce this issue? If you have this in a notebook already, you can just share a link here.

1. Open the 'Create New Notebook' popup
1. Pick the language, Python 3.6 
1. Enter text into the "Notebook Name" field
1. Press the Enter key

Result:

1. A new file is created, without an extension. 
1. Because it is without extension, the notebook opens as a text file

'Enter' triggers the forms submit before the other necesary logic completes.

Hi
I have created a azure jupiter notebook and running Rstudio in it

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32902481/71264804-c3e81c00-233c-11ea-8c1f-08065a1694e6.png)

When trying to run R script from inside it, I am getting error 

Error: cannot allocate vector of size 106.1 GB

I check the memory allocation is enough and free available memory is also enough on the VM. Do I have to do something so that memory can be used by RStudio? As far as I read linux doesnt restrict memory access for applications. Any helpwill be appreciated!

  I have written the code for DEV-330x of Eric Camplin(Microsoft Dev-330x_Unit_3)
  I had a prob statement to delete a few .txt files from the directory which was given before, but Unfortunately, I wrote the .remove() inbuilt condition to the existing directory and all my saved and written modules were deleted(except the current file and few other .txt files)...
I had a lot of important code in it...
