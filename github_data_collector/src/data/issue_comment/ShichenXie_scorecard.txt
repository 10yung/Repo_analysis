Hello,

I just discover a Github repo, [jstephenj14/Monotonic-WOE-Binning-Algorithm](https://github.com/jstephenj14/Monotonic-WOE-Binning-Algorithm), which provides a Python implementation  of a variable binning algorithm that optimizes information value (IV) monotonicity and representativeness.  

I think it would be great to include this algorithm is your fantastic package `scorecard`. Since the author provides the Python version, I wonder if it could be incorporated into you `scorecard` R package. 

Thanks!
