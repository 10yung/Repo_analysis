Hello. It seems the main class of this library is extending from `androidx.cardview.widget.CardView` class. Therefore it's not an actual toolbar and cannot be used in coordinatorlayout alongside with scroll or recycler views. I had to do abnormal usage of `paddingTop` in xml of those views in order to prevent toolbar overlap.
I'm using the Nestedscrollview.
How can I apply that library?

If someone knows how to listen to `ListView` scroll, please contribute to this project. I've used all possible scroll listeners and no one worked/was effective.
For those who are wondering why supporting `ListView` is necessary, since `RecyclerView` is already supported, remember that it's used in `PreferenceFragment`.
