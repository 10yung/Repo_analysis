Hi,

This `PR` is a **maintainance** one

+ [x] Remove https://github.com/fafhrd91/benchmarks since not relevant anymore
+ [x] Change **web-frameworks** link :information_source: I'm the maintainor of this project :information_source: 

Regards,
The link to the [rustwebapp](https://github.com/superlogical/rustwebapp) demo is broken -- the owner seems to have closed their GH account. 

[This](https://github.com/kordless/rustwebapp) seems to be a fork of that project, though.
Just noting some new ones down I came across
 - https://github.com/Pauan/rust-dominator
 - ~~https://github.com/ivanceras/sauron~~ (already included)
 - https://github.com/axelf4/dumle
https://github.com/dessalines/lemmy

Benchmarks can be easily done with the examples that they included in the project source itself.

For most of the frameworks, we could just use (except a few weird crates that name it differently such as `hello_world` or `hello`):
```
git clone git_url
cd git_url
cargo run --example hello-world --release
```

And then on another terminal:
```
wrk http://localhost:3000
```

If we could, we could bump each repository and let them have a standard name `hello-world` with a standard port to simplifies things in the future. What I learned from benchmarking ~7 different frameworks? I am surprised that `actix_web` was the fastest even when lower level frameworks (`hyper`, `tokio-tinyhttp`, `tokio-minihttp`) is included and does not have routing.

By the way, it would be great if this was included in http://arewewebyet.org

Probably we should add this note for Rocket:

`rustup run nightly cargo run --examples hello_world`
