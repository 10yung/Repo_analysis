## What does this PR do?

Instead of requiring a file with credentials, the beat uses Google's ADC

## Why is it important?

<!-- Mandatory
Explain here the WHY, or the rationale/motivation for the changes.
-->

Without this change, Filebeat requires a path to a file with credentials to be provided in its config and is unable to use for example a default service account.

1. Upload the Filebeat binary to a GCP instance created with default config

1. Filebeat should be able to detect that it's on GCP and use ADC (get a token for the default service account for the VM from the metadata server)

Cherry-pick of PR #15640 to 7.6 branch. Original message: 

## What does this PR do?
This PR is to fix Total Estimated Cost visualization for billing metricset in aws module.

## Why is it important?
In Total Estimated Cost visulization, `aws.dimensions.ServiceName : *` query of Total Estimated Charges is wrong. It's returning total charges with any service name instead of returning total charges from all service names. Total charges from all service name does not have a ServiceName as dimension. So the KQL should be `not aws.dimensions.ServiceName : *` instead.

## How to test this PR locally
Download this PR locally and build metricbeat with `mage update; mage build`.
Enable aws module: `./metricbeat modules enable aws`
Load dashboards:  `./metricbeat setup --dashboards -E setup.dashboards.directory=build/kibana`
Change metricbeat aws.yml to:
```
- module: aws
  period: 12h
  credential_profile_name: elastic-beats
  metricsets:
    - billing
  regions:
    - us-east-1
```
Start Metricbeat: `./metricbeat -e`
Make sure you have billing metrics show up in ES before checking the dashboard.
