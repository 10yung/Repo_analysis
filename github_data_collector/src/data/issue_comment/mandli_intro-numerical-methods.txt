As described on [computational science](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/33300/classical-vs-modified-gram-schmidt).
The last equation in the last block has an error. The backwards substitution method starts with i+1, not i-1. See

[link](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LUDecomposition.html)

It doesn't make sense as written so hopefully people will realize it, but this could confuse people!
Plots under L-stability section have typos in labels:

"Comparison of error for backward euler" should have label for Backward Euler.

"Comparison of errors for trapezoidal rule" should have label for Trapezoidal Rule (not Forward Euler).

Typo or unfinished block within Taylor Series Methods?

Example (no math mode):
[ u^{(p)}(t_n) = f^{(p-1)}(t_n, u(t_n)) ]

In 10_linear_algebra, "complement" is misspelled as "compliment"

Want to take content and make it more modularized and re-orderable for ease of re-use.

...or go find a good one.
