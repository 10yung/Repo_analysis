I think it is possible, cause you can flip image using `transform: scaleX(-1)` and `transform: scaleY(-1)`
```
picture.guillotine('v-flip')
picture.guillotine('h-flip')
```
How can I use multiple guillotine plugin for images on the same page?

I created two new instances but couldn't workout. The issue is when I click on any of the guillotine actions, both the image wrappers are affected.

Like, I have two images side by side. They their own guillotine action buttons. When I click on any of the actions both the images take the effect.

How can I have two different guillotine plugins on the same page which will work separately.

Can we have functionality like following in this cropper?

User should be able to see full image with cropper window over it. 
So that it would be easier to select image.

Any help would be appreciated.

![cropper](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27685304/40113277-901506cc-5926-11e8-93f9-0db98bc29b1a.png)

I want to allow user to select image and load that image to the `<img>` tag instead of the existing image. I use the following code:

```
     <form id="form"  method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
            <input type='file'  name="fileToUpload" id="fileToUpload" />
     </form>
     <div id="theparent" style="border:1px solid; width:300px;height:300px">
         <img id="thepicture" src="/images/lpreloaded_image.jpg" alt="my image"/>
     </div>

<script>
              function readURL(input) {
                if (input.files && input.files[0]) {
                    var reader = new FileReader();

                    reader.onload = function (e) {
                        $('#thepicture').attr('src', e.target.result);
                    }

                    reader.readAsDataURL(input.files[0]);
                }
            }

            $("#fileToUpload").change(function () {
                readURL(this);
            });
</script>
```


It loads the image very badly, scale goes crazy and aspect ratio as well, it distorts the image badly
Could you please help me out how to integrate Guillotine into my Aurelia application??
I'm drawing the image to be guillotined in canvas and then zoom in or out the canvas itself. As a part of functionality I'm also drawing squared rectangles over it, for which I've written custom logic. 

However, if I zoom in the image and then draw something over it, then being scaled image viewer gets an impression as portion intended for highlighting is not actually highlighted, although user is not able to see it in the current view and needs to manually drag image to search the highlighted portion.

I'm trying to establish this manual dragging as automated to the portion highlighted since we've coordinates of the portion highlighted. However, I'm not sure if it is at all doable with the plugin at all. 

As per my understanding plugin does certain calculations while dragging is manual. But how to automate it is something I'm unclear about. It'd be of great help if someone can suggest any approach.

Thanks in advance.
Hi there,
How can we ensure that all of the image is shown by default? E.g. not cropped slightly as in the demo.
Thanks!
The drag feature is not working when I apply it on #src. Help? My code looks pretty much like this:

HTML
`<div class="picture-container" style="width:80%"><div id="src" style="background-image:url(http://localhost/images/image.jpg)></div></div>`

JS
`var p = $('#src'); p.guillotine();`
Check it out if you want to use a slider for zooming.

Here is simple input type='range'. Min, max and value are set in callback, so the important one is only a step. You can pass max zooming value in options (maxScale).

Rotating and zooming buttons affect the slider also.
