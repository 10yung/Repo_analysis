Suggest housekeeping refactors. Per commit text, refactor constructor to smaller nonadic or monadic functions, etc. Contribution to increase readability and maintainability of code. 
The `redirectUri` property of `SlackAdapterOptions` is only relevant for apps that uses OAuth. It is treated as optional by the code and the type definitions should reflect that.
There is a class definition missing from the botbuilder-streaming library that causes this error when building Botkit:

`../../node_modules/botframework-streaming/lib/webSocket/browserWebSocket.d.ts(17,26): error TS2304: Cannot find name 'WebSocket'.`

This currently blocks Botkit from building. 
I have a dialog (in Botkit-CMS) with this thread:
```

                "topic": "809920a98ed",

                                {
                                    "default": true,
                                    "pattern": "default",
                                    "action": "goto_1"
                                },
                                {
                                    "pattern": "?",
                                    "type": "string",
                                    "action": "goto_1"
                                },
                                {
                                    "pattern": "Okay",
                                    "type": "string",
                                    "action": "goto_2"
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            },
```

Note that there is an option with type `string` for which the pattern is "?"; which I would expect to match the exact character "?" only.

Current result; the dialog is crashing the bot completely:
```
SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /?/: Nothing to repeat
    at new RegExp (<anonymous>)
    at BotkitConversation.<anonymous> (/Users/etienne/Code/cerebro/node_modules/botkit/src/conversation.ts:625:32)
```

Looking at the code here https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/packages/botkit/src/conversation.ts#L624 it is quite obvious what goes wrong. The string is transformed into a regular expression directly, which does not work for "?" since it is a regex special character.

Expected result: The dialog should work, and if the user inputs "?" the correct action should follow.



### Context:

- Botkit version: 4.6
- Messaging Platform: Web
- Node version: 12
- Os: MacOS / Linux

botbuilder-adapter-slack should be be patched to add support for using the new oauth/v2/authorize URL instead of generating a link to oauth/authorize
Exposes oauth.v2.access for new granular scoping.

I know this is tricky because the granular scoping still has a BETA tag on the Slack side, but bot installation fails because `getInstallLink()` and `validateOauthCode()` call against oauth.access, which throws `oauth_authorization_url_mismatch` when granular scoping is enabled on the Slack side.
Docs & samples should be updated to notify developers of Facebook's echo and delivery confirmations. If the `message_deliveries` and `message_echoes` webhook events are subscribed to and are not filtered for in the bot's incoming messages, then the user will receive continuous echoes / responses. This is something that does not occur via the Azure Bot Service Facebook channel as that service filters these events at the connector level.

> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

### Why I use this?
In the older version of the bot, i wanted to make the chat look like a goup chat, so in that version i could in global variables save the bot and message from each user separating them by channel. So when someone in that channel sended a message, i looped in this variable and send messages to all the users that was using the same channel.

### Possible solutions
Now when I'm trying to remake this features to the new version I couldn't get the same result, using the same way and neither with other ways.
So my question is, how can I send message to others active users using like trigger a message from another person?
