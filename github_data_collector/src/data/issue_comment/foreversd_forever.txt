I am trying to run my Typescript app, 
with command `forever start -v -c ts-node /src/index.ts`
and it was say running, but when I run `forever list` it was nothing my app running, not list
can I know why? do I make something wrong command ?
I am trying to run ```forever.js``` via the Windows command prompt and I get the following output:

```>npm i -g forever```

```/my-project>forever start index.js```

*Log output:*

```'C:\Program' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file``` 

I think it's something to do with the ```PATH``` that ```forever``` is using for the ```node``` binary, but I don't know how to fix it...

When I run the command "$ sudo npm install forever -g", I get this error log.

[npm-debug.log](https://github.com/foreversd/forever/files/4007752/npm-debug.log)

I am using forever in **windows 2016 server** to run node and react process but forever daemon is killed from time to time clearing all the forever processes.

Node Version - 10.15.3
forever Version - 1.0.0
System info -arch : x64
platform - win32
type : Windows_NT

That PR adds support for `--exitOnFail` or `-x` parameter.

```
node ./node_modules/.bin/forever --minUptime 1000 --spinSleepTime 1000 -m 10 -x some-script.js
``` 
When you run the forever script with that param like in the example and the `some-script.js` fails 10 times, the forever script will exit from the process with -1 code. 
This might be a feature idea if it doesn't already exist.  

Iwas wondering if there is any way to setup forever to send an alert via email when a chosen process has STOPPED - for example due to an error preventing the code from running? I recently had this problem of a missing module which caused the process to stop and not be able to restart due to a module dependency that had somehow changed.
i have install forever successfully but not able to run it

How do I do something like this in my npm scripts

`"debug": "forever start --inspect node_modules/@google-cloud/functions-framework --target=api",`

however it doesn't accept it with

    help:    usage: forever [action] [options] SCRIPT [script-options]
    help:
    help:    Monitors the script specified in the current process or as a daemon
    help:

ideas?
I have the following problem:

I have a `startbot.timer`, a `startbot.service` and a `startbot` script (bash).
The `startbot.timer` says, that after reboot via `OnBootSec=1m`, that the `startbot.service` file should be executed one minute after booting. 
The `startbot.service` says `ExecStart=/bin/bash /usr/local/bin/startbot`.
The startbot script looks as following (after several tries):
```
su - alarm -c "cd ./projectfolder/anotherfolder; forever start index.js"
```
The first attempt was
```
cd /home/alarm/projectfolder/anotherfolder
forever start indexjs
```
The second would probably be enough, but I tried some different stuff.
When I run the script via command line: 
```
[alarm@alarm ~]$ /usr/local/bin/startbot
```
everything works as expected.
However, when I reboot the raspberry pi (with an arch linux distro -> need this for 64bit OS) no forever process is running.
When I check what happend with the service I type:
```
[alarm@alarm ~]$ systemctl status startbot.service
```
This says, that all worked fine and the service terminated with code: SUCCEED.
Also the output says: 
```
* startbot.service - starts the startbot script
    Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/startbot.service; static; vendor preset: disabled)
    Active: inactive (dead) since Fri 2019-08-30 08:58:16 CEST; 54s ago

Aug 30 08:58:16 alarm systemd[1]: startbot.service: Succeeded.
```

Then, when I type `forever list` it just says no process is running and the server is also not running. So its no problem just with forever list, as often mentioned in other Issues here.

also when trying the script as root like:
```
[root@alarm alarm]# /bin/bash /usr/local/bin/startbot
```
Everything thing works just fine and as expected, only when executing the scipt after reboot via systemd won't work.
I am using node js script to start and stop. I am able to start server successfully,When I try to stop it then it is hanging and no time out for it to come out of it.
After running stop command when I see the forever list, my server is shown as STOPPED

data:    [1] asNZ /Users/Test/.nvm/versions/node/v8.8.1/bin/node user_server.js 8375    10350    /Users/Test/Library/Logs/test/forever.log STOPPED 

And then I have to run the command again to stop the server. Is there a way to timeout this stop.
