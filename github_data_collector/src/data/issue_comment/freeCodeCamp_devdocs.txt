If you're updating an existing documentation to it's latest version, please ensure that you have:

- [x] Updated the versions and releases in the scraper file
- [x] Ensured the license is up-to-date and that the documentation's entry in the array in `about_tmpl.coffee` matches it's data in `self.attribution`
- [x] Ensured the icons and the `SOURCE` file in <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> are up-to-date if the documentation has a custom icon
- [x] Ensured `self.links` contains up-to-date urls if `self.links` is defined
- [x] Tested the changes locally to ensure:
  - The scraper still works without errors
  - The scraped documentation still looks consistent with the rest of DevDocs
  - The categorization of entries is still good

Ad license: https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html and https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/blob/master/src/theme.js and https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13593 mention different licenses. Let's stick with the current one?

Fixes #1122.
I have not yet checked to see if this breaks things. Fixes #1154.

Steps
- check if doc includes `<dt>`
- check each `<dt>` to see if it has unwanted content

Potentially affected docs:
- [ ] ansible
- [ ] bottle
- [ ] cmake
- [ ] codeigniter
- [ ] django
- [ ] falcon
- [ ] godot
- [ ] julia
- [ ] matplotlib
- [ ] numpy
- [ ] pandas
- [ ] python
- [ ] scikit_image
- [ ] scikit_learn
- [ ] statsmodels
The Sphinx `clean_html` filter removes all formatting from `<dt>` elements:

https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/58a0120697a701f2cb9ca87061ec7ef6fde3b013/lib/docs/filters/sphinx/clean_html.rb#L64

However, this is not entirely desirable since the formatting makes things look better. For example, the [header for `BaseException`](http://devdocs.localhost/python~3.8/library/exceptions#BaseException) ([original](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/exceptions.html#BaseException)) is transformed from this:

> *exception* **`BaseException`**

to this:
> `exception BaseException`

cc @Thibaut since you might have a reason for implementing this this way. (no worries if you don’t reply though)
@denilsonsa on Trello:
> We already have Moment.js documentation. (See [Moment.js](https://trello.com/c/h4qjRwIR))
> However, it is missing the documentation for `moment-timezone`, which is an optional part of moment.js.
> I imagine the scraper would be mostly the same. You could even group both documentation pagess (moment and moment-timezone) under the same "Moment.js" project insie devdocs.

These docs were moved to their own section (`base`) in v0.7.

If you’re **modifying an existing** scraper, please ensure that you have:

- [x] Tested the scraper on a local copy of DevDocs
- [x] Ensured that the docs are styled similarly to other docs on DevDocs

Add commonmarker as dependency for parsing markdown

<!-- Remove the sections that don't apply to your PR. -->

<!-- Replace the `[ ]` with a `[x]` in checklists once you’ve completed each step. -->
<!-- Please create a draft PR when you haven't completed all steps yet upon creation of the PR. -->

<!-- SECTION A - Adding a new scraper -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-new-documentations -->

If you’re adding a new scraper, please ensure that you have:

- [x] Tested the scraper on a local copy of DevDocs
- [x] Ensured that the docs are styled similarly to other docs on DevDocs
<!-- If the docs don’t have an icon, delete the next four items: -->
- [x] Added these files to the <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> directory:
  - [x] `16.png`: a 16×16 pixel icon for the doc
  - [x] `16@2x.png`: a 32×32 pixel icon for the doc
  - [x] `SOURCE`: A text file containing the URL to the page the image can be found on or the URL of the original image itself
