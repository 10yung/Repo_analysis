Does this have an option to detect if one item valid added?
I am looking for disabling a submit button before an item converted to a tag.
I am guessing it is called a race condition, so the better way is to disable the submit button.

With `onFocus` & `onBlur`, I can create events to disable the submit button, but it can not detect if one valid tag success added then enable the button, I have to click outside of the `tag` input field.

```
<button [disabled]=isFocus" mat-raised-button color="primary">Submit</button>

  onInputFocused($event: string) {
    this.isFocus = true;
  }

  onInputBlurred($event: string) {
    this.isFocus = false
  }
```

Also, if with `onFocus` & `onAdd`, it would not work as what I am looking for.

So it would be great if we have `afterAdd` option.
is it possible to set an input mask? Not a validation pattern.
Is there a way to display lesser tags on UI rather than actual inputs with show more option at the end, and on user click on button show more, all tags are displayed?

It will be great if this feature is already exists or can  be used with minimal changes.

Currently we are using version: 2.0.2

**Current behavior**
<!-- Describe how the bug manifests. -->
The type of `theme` in [`module/defaults.ts`](https://github.com/Gbuomprisco/ngx-chips/blob/44dc70f04c37ecc8fc081099efe752767353d436/modules/defaults.ts#L18) is not properly set, and will raise error when assigning default theme:
```
The expected type comes from property 'theme' which is declared here on type '{ separatorKeys?: string[]; separatorKeyCodes?: number[]; maxItems?: number; placeholder?: string; secondaryPlaceholder?: string; validators?: ValidatorFn[]; asyncValidators?: AsyncValidatorFn[]; onlyFromAutocomplete?: boolean; ... 24 more ...; animationDuration?: { ...; }; }'
```

**Expected behavior**
<!-- Describe what the behavior would be without the bug. -->
Change
`theme: '';`
to
`theme: string;`
will make things work again.

This fixes #887 as it prevents triggering autocomplete when navigating to first result with down arrow from keyboard.
