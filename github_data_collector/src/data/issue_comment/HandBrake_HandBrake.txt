### Problem description:

I have 3900x so to get maximum core usage I use 2 versions of handbrake running at the same time. One of the apps just closes, no error message just stops and when I reload it shoes the queue and where it was broken. According to the Event Viewer its an unhandled exception....

### HandBrake version (e.g., 1.3.0):
1.3.1 (2020010400)

### Operating system and version (e.g., Ubuntu 19.10, macOS 10.15 Catalina, Windows 10 1909):

### Description of the feature or enhancement you'd like to see in HandBrake:

In case an queued job fails, one has to work himself through the Activity Log to figure out why. But since the app already found out why, why not show this as a "Status" or "Result" as the latest Summary Item? - from my point of view, and if all users have >= Full-HD displays, there is plenty space and either a Result: Succeeded or the specific error message (which can be found in the Activity Log anyways), are displayed.

Depending on the size of the job - or so to say the length of each item specific Activity Log - this would save some time... and still, if the error is more complex, a user can dig deeper.

From my point of view, this shouldn't be such a big deal just due to the fact that the error is already handled at the point the item is marked failed, nor? :)

### What version of HandBrake are you currently running (e.g., 1.3.0)?

### Problem description:

Bug 1: Title says it all really, with Handbrake 1.3.1 custom dimensions always reset when adding multiple files to a queue, meaning anyone who wants to convert 4:3 to 16:9 aspect ratio for instance has to tediously load each file individually, make the dimension changes, hit "start encode", wait for it to complete, load the next file, repeat the process, continue until you want to blow your own brains out.

Bug 2: Considering the option is there I'm assuming a H.265 2-pass encode is meant to be possible but the 2-pass option is grayed out. 

System is an R7 1700 on Win 10 Pro build 1709.

Is there any danger of getting more options in Handbrake? Such as being able to encode with VP9 and having more control over encoder presets than just moving a slider left or right as GPU based encoding still looks like arse vs. CPU based I'm sure that gap could be lessened with more control/options.


Elapsed time and remaining time are not accurate when an encode takes longer than 24 hours. For example, if an encode has been running for 25 hours elapsed time will display 1 hour.
**Description of Change:**

When `nlmeans_prefilter()` is preparing to apply a pre-filter to an image plane, it first attempts to make a copy of the `mem` image plane into the `mem_pre` plane which will hold the pre-filter's output.

However, the existing logic, which mirrors the loop over all pixel rows in `nlmeans_alloc()`, improperly leaves the bottom `2*border` rows of the `mem_pre` plane uninitialized.

Where `nlmeans_alloc()` correctly copies the source image's rows into its plane, by adding the correct offset to the `memcpy(3)` destination to locate the image pixel data between the horizontal and vertical borders, in `nlmeans_prefilter()` the intention is to copy both the image and the borders.  However, the current loop only iterates `h` times, i.e., the size of the image itself, and skips the last `(bh - h) = 2*border` rows.

As described in #2576, this bug is not apparent when using the older "mean" and "median" pre-filters as they rewrite every pixel's value in the `mem_pre` plane.  However, when using the newer CSM pre-filter, which only rewrites a pixel's value if it should change, any pixels whose value should remain unaltered by the pre-filter (i.e., those which fall through the end of the [`if/else` block](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/blob/073c2fb84b3ead86d2f2b28cbd737bb936cc0696/libhb/nlmeans.c#L457-L481) in `nlmeans_filter_csm()`), and which happen to be in the bottom `border` rows of the image, will actually be left with uninitialized values.

Instead, we replace the loop with a single `memcpy(3)` call which just duplicates the entire `mem` image plane, including the border data.

**Tested on:**

- [ ] Windows 10+  (via MinGW)
- [ ] macOS 10.13+
- [x] Ubuntu Linux

**Screenshots (If relevant):**

After applying this PR and re-running `HandBrakeCLI` with the same options and inputs:

![nlmeans_csm_edgeboost_fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28857117/72214636-1c818380-34bb-11ea-9c93-5c1d59f866e6.png)

Resolves #2576. 
### Problem description:

The NLMeans filter includes the option to use a pre-filter such as the new CSM (Conservative Smoothing with Median-like tendencies) pre-filter, introduced in 57465d4ab6.  However, the bottom rows of an image may be corrupted when using this pre-filter because they are not fully copied from the source image into the pre-filter's scratch buffer.

Before any pre-filter is applied, the image is first duplicated by the `nlmeans_prefilter()` method into a second buffer.  However, the duplication code [uses a loop](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/blob/073c2fb84b3ead86d2f2b28cbd737bb936cc0696/libhb/nlmeans.c#L616-L622) which only copies `h` rows (the size of the actual image) when it source copy `bh` rows (the size of the image, plus the size of the upper and lower borders).

Unlike the previous existing pre-filters such as the "mean" and "median" ones, the CSM pre-filter does not overwrite every pixel, so this bug becomes apparent when using this pre-filter for any pixels in the bottom rows which should not change value in the pre-filter step.  (In the "mean" and "median" pre-filters, *every* pixel is written into the second buffer, so it doesn't matter that the buffer wasn't populated correctly, and the bug has no effect.)

When using the "edge-boost" option with the CSM pre-filter, the problem may be especially apparent, as shown in the following screenshot.

### HandBrake version (e.g., 1.3.0):

HandBrake 1.3.1.

### Operating system and version (e.g., Ubuntu 19.10, macOS 10.15 Catalina, Windows 10 1909):

Ubuntu Linux.

### HandBrake Activity Log:

Run the `HandBrakeCLI` command-line utility with the `--nlmeans=y-prefilter=3080` option to run the NLMeans 3x3 CSM pre-filter with the edge-boost pre-filter (or `--nlmeans=y-prefilter=3104` for the 5x5 CSM pre-filter) in pass-through mode.
encoding with veryfast VP9 with 2-pass makes the first pass run SLOWER versus the other presets.. I looked at cpu usage and it is much lower versus the other presets on the first pass
I read that specifying a speed for the 2-pass just slows things down and can reduce the amount of cores it runs on and am wondering if that is what it is doing
Am using Handbrake 1.3.1
### Description of the feature or enhancement you'd like to see in HandBrake:

Currently in HandBrake, I can control when encoding stops only for the current job by hitting the Stop button, which shows options to cancel immediately, stop after current, etc. But what I would really like is the ability to insert a "breakpoint" into my queue, telling HandBrake to stop when this is reached, as this would allow me to tell HandBrake to stop after finishing a season, a folder of files, or after five roughly one hour jobs etc.

I would envision this being added to the contextual menu for jobs the queue window, with an option for "Stop After This Job". Selecting this would insert a "breakpoint" into the queue after that job to show where HandBrake will stop. It should also be possible to reorder or remove the breakpoint if the user changes their mind.

When HandBrake encounters such a breakpoint, it should stop encoding, and remove the breakpoint from the queue, ready to continue when the user chooses to.

It would also probably make sense to adjust the Stop button's "Stop after current" job option to use the same behaviour, i.e- it would add a breakpoint after the current job, with other options removing such a breakpoint if one is found.

### What version of HandBrake are you currently running (e.g., 1.3.0)?

1.3.1

### What operating system and version are you running (e.g., Ubuntu 19.10, macOS 10.15 Catalina, Windows 10 1909)?

macOS 10.15.2 Catalina
### Problem description:

My Google Pixel phone records MP4 H.264 video with yuvj420p flag. The videos directly from the Pixel play fine on VLC. When I use HandBrake to re-encode the videos to H.264 or H.265 the flag is changed to yuv420p but the videos are washed out when played with VLC.

To eliminate playback issues I converted the same video with ffmpeg  using

`-vf scale=w=-1:h=-1:in_range=pc:out_range=tv`

That video plays with correct colors in VLC. Only the HandBrake video plays with washed out colors.

### HandBrake version (e.g., 1.3.0):

1.3.0 (2019110900)

### Operating system and version (e.g., Ubuntu 19.10, macOS 10.15 Catalina, Windows 10 1909):

Windows 10 1909

### Error message text and/or screenshot:

N/A

### HandBrake Activity Log:

An Activity Log is required for support. Please read https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/latest/help/activity-log.html for more information.
