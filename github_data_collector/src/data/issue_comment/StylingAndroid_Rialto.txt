I have a class subclassing TextView. Using rialto does not seem to work there as string resource annotation processing isn't invoked there as the TextView subclass isn't converted to a `RialtoTextView` during View inflation. And as `RialtoTextView` is final I cannot subclass that one instead of plain `TextView` to make it work.

Is there a specific reason why `RialtoTextView` is final?

From what I can see this would also affect subclasses of Button and EditText.
