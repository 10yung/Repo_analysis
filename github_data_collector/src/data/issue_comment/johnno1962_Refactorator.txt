Hi, I'm using https://github.com/johnno1962/RefactoratorApp and noticed that it's no longer working  correctly in Xcode 9, probably due to the new build system.

Slightly digging into `DerviedData`, I couldn't find `\(projectName).xcindex/db.xcindexdb` sqlite DB anymore, which seems to be replaced by `UniDB/\(projectName).xcindex/v8/saved/data.mdb` (I have no clue what this DB format is ðŸ˜• ).

Is there any plan to update the code for Xcode 9?
Will you update or you will wait until Xcode 8 released?

I tried to rename class. As result I got such screen (see screenshot).
When I click preview system error is displayed: 

```
Exception communicating with daemon: NSDistantObject (0x7fd9d9825dc0) is invalid (no connection)
```

Plugin was installed by Alcatraz Package Manager.
