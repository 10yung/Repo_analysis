Hi,
I want to add a scrollview under to stepBar ( _stepViewControllerContainer ).

I add it programmatically but it didn't scrolled. 

How can i do that?
iPhone X displays a huge header space between the bar and the actual content of RMStepsController.
RMStepsBar.cancelButton does not seem to be receiving touch events under iOS 11. Has anyone else faced this issue?

iOS 9 and 10 are working perfectly.

Guys, I'm passing throw a problem and hope you guys can help, you know if there is a way to increase the size (height) of the bar? I'm asking it because it is located closer of the navigationbar, and sometimes when we try to click on the last stepper, user touch the done accidentally
Is there a way to reload one of steps views controllers ?
The views of my controllers are under the stepBar. How can I remake the constraints ?

Hi

I was wondering if it is possible to make the stepbar scrollable.
For my app, it needs a lot of different parts like 8-9 ususally. 
If I run the app on iphone6, stepbar looks all squished. 
This is natural behavior tho.
I was wondering if there would be a way to make the bar scrollable if it is wider than device's screen size.
