Even. with Cocoapods it won't compiles because its missing RestKit

  GNU nano 2.0.6                                       File: Podfile                                                                                     

```
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'Example' do
  # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for Example
  pod 'RestKit'
  pod 'UIColor-HexString'

end

```


Come on guys.
I've successfully used this pod in an app for a number of years (thank you!).  Noticed lately that the border lines on the left side of each event cell would disappear when the current time triggered (each minute).  Also, the layout of the labels in each cell were incorrect after the current time changed.

Spent some time tracking this down, and relates iOS autolayout changes that were put in place in the last few releases of iOS.

In any case, I found that contentView of the event cell (e.g., MSEventCell in the example) was not constrained to its parent view.  I added the following constraints in the example MSEventCell::initWithFrame method to resolve the issue:

    ```
    [self.contentView makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {
            make.top.equalTo(self.top);
            make.bottom.equalTo(self.bottom);
            make.left.equalTo(self.left);
            make.right.equalTo(self.right);
        }];
```

Hope this may save anybody still using this pod some time if you run into similar issue.
How can I able to add image inside my event before Title?
How to modify the current time scale line?I need to set the scale line, not the default of the current time.
Urgent urgent, Please reply as soon as possibleÔºÅ
Is this calendar layout compatible with ios 10.2?

Because I have error on view calendar layout. Like all event on single day, and shows only one date.
Is it possible to set custom view on MSEventCell?

I would like to add background image, buttons and multiple labels on MSEventCell.
I want time to be shown on top and date on the left. Is it possible? If yes, pls let me know! What i find is this is the crux of the code where it is handled i guess. Reply ASAP.

- (UICollectionReusableView *)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView viewForSupplementaryElementOfKind:(NSString *)kind atIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    UICollectionReusableView *view;
    if (kind == MSCollectionElementKindDayColumnHeader) {
        MSDayColumnHeader *dayColumnHeader = [collectionView dequeueReusableSupplementaryViewOfKind:kind withReuseIdentifier:MSDayColumnHeaderReuseIdentifier forIndexPath:indexPath];
        NSDate *day = [self.collectionViewCalendarLayout dateForDayColumnHeaderAtIndexPath:indexPath];
        NSDate *currentDay = [self currentTimeComponentsForCollectionView:self.collectionView layout:self.collectionViewCalendarLayout];

        NSDate *startOfDay = [[NSCalendar currentCalendar] startOfDayForDate:day];
        NSDate *startOfCurrentDay = [[NSCalendar currentCalendar] startOfDayForDate:currentDay];

        dayColumnHeader.day = day;
        dayColumnHeader.currentDay = [startOfDay isEqualToDate:startOfCurrentDay];

        view = dayColumnHeader;
    } else if (kind == MSCollectionElementKindTimeRowHeader) {
        MSTimeRowHeader *timeRowHeader = [collectionView dequeueReusableSupplementaryViewOfKind:kind withReuseIdentifier:MSTimeRowHeaderReuseIdentifier forIndexPath:indexPath];
        timeRowHeader.time = [self.collectionViewCalendarLayout dateForTimeRowHeaderAtIndexPath:indexPath];
        view = timeRowHeader;
    }
    return view;
}

I want to show time row 0-24 hrs format. It is always showing current time onwards. please, let me know how to stop this. I just want 0-24 hrs in row. please let me know asap.
change method name from `scrollCollectionViewToClosetSectionToCurrentTimeAnimated` to `scrollCollectionViewToClosestSectionToCurrentTimeAnimated`

PTAL @erichoracek 

When trying:  $ pod install    I get the following message:

Johns-iMac:Example iMac$ pod install
Re-creating CocoaPods due to major version update.

Evidently I am doing something wrong with cocoapods. I have added MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout to the Podfile in the Example folder.

If someone could set me straight that would be awesome.
