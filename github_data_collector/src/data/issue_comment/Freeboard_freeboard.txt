Dear freeboard developers,

I'm currently trying to package freeboard to Debian. 

There are current 3 releases.
https://github.com/Freeboard/freeboard/releases

The latest one is 2014. Can you make a new release if possible? I see there are many good features in master branch. It is easier for downstream packages.

Thanks,
Paul


Hi, what is the current status of this project? Is it still actively maintained?
Is it possible to integrate with my existing application? if yes, can you share the documentation if any.
There's no data, just a dropdown menu visible at the top. No widgets either.

Sorry for misusing the issue tracker for a question, but you might interpret this as a documentation bug...
I am not sure if I understand the feature set of freeboard, so I just want to know: does it **persist data** in any way, e.g. to browser **historical data**? Or is this a pure "realtime" solution that throws away the showed data after some time?
Thanks and have a nice day!
I'm facing a big problem when try to connect to an MQTT broker (CloutMQTT) via secure websocket.
CloudMQTT would accept max 5 concurrent connections and Freeboard seems to open more than 5 (simultaneous) connection to this broker; in this way the broker definitively deny the connection.

```
2018-12-09 17:13:44: Client connection from 79.43.134.88 denied: max_connections exceeded.
2018-12-09 17:13:45: Client connection from 79.43.134.88 denied: max_connections exceeded.

2018-12-09 17:13:46: Client connection from 79.43.134.88 denied: max_connections exceeded.
```

How to resolve this issue?
Hello,

I am trying to install on aws server. First i installed npm to the server and then followed instructions;

> git clone https://github.com/Freeboard/freeboard.git
> cd freeboard
> npm install

And then i installed grunt with:
> sudo apt install node-grunt-cli
Then i run following command;
> grunt

That gives me the following error;

> internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:582
>     throw err;
>     ^

What is the solution?  What am i missing?

Best regards
