Hello;
In the import-export functions the possible additions and very useful is the QR code generator/reader function for secure password movement between databases/users, would be really nice

**Espected action:**


 - display passwords, usernames etc. (or the full entry/group) as a QR code
 - scan QR codes to quickly find an entry
 - scan QR codes to add the scanned text to your Keepass database.

**For what:**

Used to transfer database entries or group from one Android device to another.
_(e.g. if you want to securely share credentials with a friend, or family member)_

**Espected behavior:**

 1- open the entry you want to share
 2- select "Show (or generate) QR Code" from the options menu (dot menu)
 3- open the QR code generator (in KeePass DX) on the other device
 4- select "Scan QR code from other device"
 5- scan the code from the display of the first device
 6- you are asked wether you want to search and open an entry or create a new one.
 7- select the group where you want to add the entry and click "Add entry"
 8- Select "Save"

If this feature could be made, I would even be quite willing to pay to see it added (Feel free to contact me about this).

Thank you for your excellent work.

PS: Sorry for my Bad english, I'm French <3 # 

**Describe the bug**
With compressed database files, after the database is modified in KeePassDX, it will no longer be readable in KeePassXC. A temporally solution for now is to save the database uncompressed

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a database in KeePassXC and have some data in the database (over 50kb in compressed size)
2. Open the database in KeePassDX and edit and field and save the database
3. Try opening the database in KeePassXC, it will give the error "Error while reading the database: Unable to decompress binary" but the database can still be opened in KeePassDX



https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/4050
Version 2.5.0beta25 from F-Droid via Android 5.1.1

**To Reproduce**
use KpDX to open a read-only file using a third party file explorer, and create an entry.

###### * maybe from Android itself might work. i used [Material Files](https://f-droid.org/app/me.zhanghai.android.files) from f-droid.

saving an entry should save and let you know about the progress of it. if any errors occurs, the usual red bad should appear at the bottom like the other errors in the app.

what actually happens is that the progress bar flashes and nothing else happens, and the file is not edited, nor an error about the read-only state (or "failed to read") is shown.
I apologise if I missed it, but it says this app does 2FA? I cannot find this, where is it? If not please add this feature, thank you for this amazing app it is really appreciated! 

Magikeyboard won't open the keepass app when I click the key-button. The other buttons work as expected. If I open an entry in the app beforehand the keyboard gives me the option to fill in the username and password as usual, it's just when I try to open the database from the keyboard it is not working.

It has worked before with the same device and database. It might be the miui 11 that broke it.

The form-filling has the same problem but I don't use it.

** Keepass Database **

 - Version: 2.5.0.0beta25

We recently worked with KeePassXC to add OnlyKey support for challenge-response, so now you have two options, YubiKey or OnlyKey for challenge response with KeePassXC.

While these issues mention support of challenge-response through other 3rd party apps:
https://github.com/Kunzisoft/KeePassDX/issues/137
https://github.com/Kunzisoft/KeePassDX/issues/8

I wanted to suggest a different approach that would allow users to use all Yubikey models, not just the NEO, and OnlyKey. The idea is to keep using the device of your choice on desktop OS with KeePassXC but on Android don't use the device, instead use the Android keystore. This would be a lot more user friendly and avoid lots of potential technical issues like NFC issues, USB issues, etc. Here is how it would work:

- On Yubikey (or OnlyKey) device you load your HMAC SHA1 key
- You use your device with KeePassXC or KeePass on desktop OS with challenge and response (v4 KBDX)
- On mobile you use an app like KeePassDX and have the option to import an HMAC SHA1 key in the app by typing it in (or maybe by QR code, typing would be fine for first run)
- KeePassDX imports this key to the android key store and protects it with fingerprint

So now you can open your KBDX on desktop OS with your device, or on Android with a fingerprint. The Android keystore according to this supports HMAC SHA1 so you would be able to generate the challenge-response in the app, with the key never leaving the Android keystore - https://source.android.com/security/keystore/features

I think from a user experience perspective this would be a game changer. All that is required is a fingerprint on mobile and its backwards compatible with KeePassXC.

I usually keep direct links to web pages where I change passwords on sites.
