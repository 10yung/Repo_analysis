There have been some changes to how carbon.now.sh handles URL parameters, so this fixes the carbon.now.sh URL so that the correct gist is opened. Basically, I just removed the extra parameters; adding any parameters causes carbon to drop the gist. It's somewhat annoying to have to pick the correct language, but preferable over not having the code populate from the gist.

I also updated the gist URL that is shortened to point directly to the user-facing gist. Previously the shortened gist URL pointed to the API url instead of the html url.

I still use this addin regularly, so thanks!
It would be nice to grab a gist and insert it into the active source tab or clipboard.

There's some thinking to do about the interface that goes along with this: exploring your gists, filtering etc.
