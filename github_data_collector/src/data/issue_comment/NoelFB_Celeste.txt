Russian translations for dialogues in the 'Farewell' chapter seem to be slightly inaccurate in a few places:

* `Russian.txt:4630` - ... `присматривала за мной{n}на горе {+MOUNTAIN}.`
    Since `MOUNTAIN =`**`Гора`**, it ends up as "присматривала за мной на горе **Гора**." ("looked after me on the **Mountain** Mountain"). It should probably be "на горе **Селеста**" ("on the **Celeste** Mountain"), or something similar.
    Same for `:4902` ("на горе {+MOUNTAIN}" = "на горе <s>Гора</s>**Селеста**").
* `:4746` - `Птица не хочет, чтобы я спасла {+GRANNY}.` = ... "спасла **Старушка**" ("to save **Granny**") Here the grammatical case is incorrect, it should be "спасла **Старушку**".
    Same for:
    `:4717` (`не увидим {+GRANNY}` = "не увидим <s>Старушка</s>**Старушку**"),
    `:4903` (`бросить {+GRANNY}` = "бросить <s>Старушка</s>**Старушку**"),
    `:4976` (`{+GRANNY} не понравилось бы` = "<s>Старушка</s>**Старушке** не понравилось бы")

There's probably something else, but I've not finished the chapter yet, so I want to avoid spoilers. :p
Version 1.3.1.2 crashes in the following scenario:

1. Start the game.  (Starts in fullscreen mode.)
2. Enter the Options menu.
3. Switch the option Video: Fullscreen from ON to OFF.
4. Drag the game window to another monitor.
5. Game crashes as soon as more than half of the window enters the other monitor.

This used to work without issue on whatever version I was running earlier, probably pre-v1.3.
After updating to 1.3 Celeste suddenly gets stuck at the initial loading screen when you boot up the game. Killing the game from System Monitor also requires killing an additional SDL Audio-related process.

The game didn't work initially, then it worked for a day or two, and it stopped working today again. No clue what could be the issue behind this.

Running the game on Fedora Linux, native port from Steam.
I don't know if anyone has seen this, but my game is glitched and I can't figure out how to fix it. When I get to the main menu the game freaks out and rapidly alternates between the first two option (Climb and Pico-8). I've tried relaunching the game, restarting my computer, and reinstalling the game, but I still can't make it stop. It makes the game nearly impossible to get into. I've also unplugged all USB ports with the problem persisting, so I don't think it is a peripheral issue. 

Thanks
I play the game on both Ubuntu and Windows with an X-Box One controller. On Windows, I get a controller rumble whenever I dash. On Ubuntu 18.04.1, my controller never rumbles. I'm running kernel 4.15 currently. 
When looking at Celeste in the Discord game library, there's a dropdown for "play". One of the options is "Celeste OpenGL". Upon choosing this option, the game opened as normal (but in fullscreen, when previously it was set to windowed) and then had none of the three save files that were stored there, two of which had significant progress (one of them had gotten past all C-sides but one).

Looking through the DiscordGames\Celeste\content folder, there are `0`, `1`, and `2.celeste` files in the `Saves` and `Backups` folders, sized 21, 25, 22 KB respectively (suggesting that they are empty).

It's (understatement) rather upsetting to lose 46 hours worth of progress on a paid game. This should not be allowed to happen.

### Steps to (maybe) Reproduce
1. Back up your game
2. Launch Celeste from the Discord library by clicking "Play"
3. Make progress
4. Close Celeste, and launch it again, this time by clicking "Celeste OpenGL" in the Play dropdown
5. Observe progress gone
Hey there!

I am really curious on how you implemented the hair in `Celeste`. Reading the source code it looks like the hair is dynamically generated somehow depending on the character's velocity(?). I wanted to ask if you guys would be okay with uploading the `PlayerHair` class used to animate the hair :smile:

Have a great New Year's Eve

If you manage to get to the bottom-right corner of the screen at the start of the breaking mirror cutscene (level 2-A), the character will appear inside the floor (one layer lower than usual) after skipping the cutscene.
Apparently, the animation still happens and the character gets moved horizontally rather than to a specific place.

Steam, v.1.2.5.2
Turning the game speed down in Assist Mode causes the player to be unable to (instantly) hold on to dream blocks (hope that's the correct term, I mean those in Chapter 2) after dashing through them.

The 50% Game Speed Option seems to be unaffected by this.
70% Speed seems to work for most blocks but not some.

Platform: Linux
Celeste Version: 1.2.4.1 (itch.io)
