I have used QBPopup menu with multiple items, but i didn't get which button clicked, so any solution for that?
If the `QBPopupMenuItem` was the sender, a single action could handle multiple menu items. This is good when the menu items are generated programatically.

For example:

```
- (void)contextMenuItemSelected:(id)sender {
  QBPopupMenuItem *item = (QBPopupMenuItem*) sender;
  assert(item); // This currently fails.
  [self performCommandNamed: item.title];
}
```

This change is as simple as modifying `-[QBPopupMenuItemView performAction]`:

`[self.item.target performSelector:self.item.action withObject:self.item afterDelay:0];`
I am using QBPopupMenu in Swift, but popmenu button are not clicked it's target method. here i am attaching my code.

class MenuViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet weak var tapView : UIView!
    var popUpMenu : QBPopupMenu!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        let menuItem = QBPopupMenuItem(title: "Split", target: self, action: #selector(splitProcess))
        let menuItemTwo : QBPopupMenuItem = QBPopupMenuItem(title: "Duplicate", target: self, action: #selector(MenuViewController.splitProcess))
        let menuItemThree : QBPopupMenuItem = QBPopupMenuItem(title: "Speed", target: self, action: #selector(MenuViewController.splitProcess))
        let menuItemFour : QBPopupMenuItem = QBPopupMenuItem(title: "Delete", target: self, action: #selector(MenuViewController.splitProcess))
        
        let items:Array = [menuItem,menuItemTwo,menuItemThree,menuItemFour]
        let popUpMenuFinal = QBPopupMenu(items: items)
        
        let tap = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(MenuViewController.split))
        tapView.addGestureRecognizer(tap)
        self.popUpMenu = popUpMenuFinal
    }
    func split(){
        print("Split Clicked")
        self.popUpMenu.showInView(tapView, targetRect: tapView.frame, animated: true)
    }
    func splitProcess(){
        print("Clicked")
    }   
}
I want to get the popup menu how to get it in vertical style

Set an accessibility label on QBPopupMenuItem (needed if item contains only image) :

QBPopupMenuItem *item = [QBPopupMenuItem itemWithImage:image target:self action:@selector(tappedImage:)]
item.accessibilityLabel = @"do something";
