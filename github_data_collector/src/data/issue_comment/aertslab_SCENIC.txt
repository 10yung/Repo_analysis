Dear SCENIC team,

I am working with completely new organisms. I have the annotation file and gene expression, and now I want to use SCENIC to cluster the based on expression and motif present in promoter. I am having hard time with motif database. I have the motif list in promoter region but I am unable to convert it to 'feather' files, which can be used in SCENIC.

I will be grateful if you could help me regarding this issue. 
Thanks 
Hi,
where Can I find related paper or explanation of cisTarget databases?

Hi,
      How can I run runGenie3 using a custom list of transcription factors(TFs)? For example, as mentioned in the GENIE3 vignette, it can be done using regulators <- c("Gene1", "Gene2", "Gene3") and then weightMat <- GENIE3(exprMatr, regulators=regulators). My .loom file is huge and runGenie3 detects 1286 TFs in it. I need to run the .loom file just for 10 TFs. Any advice on this will be really helpful. Thank you.
Hello aertslab,
Wondering how can I compute regulon_specificity_scores to get cell type specific regulons in SCENIC? Is there a function like regulon_specificity_scores in pySCENIC?

Hello, aertslab

Since all regulons targeting fewer than 20 genes are dropped (in the modules_from_adjacencies function, why I got regulons with fewer than 20 genes?

Hope for your reply
I read the introduction  part about applying SCENIC into another species. It suggests us to download cis element database and other settings. But I am still confused. Could you give some more details or some specific procedures about it ? Thank you very much.
Hello,

I have been trying SCENIC on our data and got the error message mentioned in the title. The dataset I am using is a 22057 * 17057 matrix processed by scanpy package. If I use the whole matrix then it give me the error, however, if I only use part of the matrix (10000*17057), then it can be finished. At first I thought it is memory issue, but I am using a cluster with 128Gb memory and SCENIC only takes 32Gb before it shows the error. Thus, I have two questions here:
1. Please advice me on how to solve this error
2. If I chop the matrix into pieces and run GRNboost on each piece to get regulon and then take the union and run aucell. Does it equal to run GRNboost on whole matrix and then apply resulted regulon to aucell?

The detailed code and error message is shown below.

Thanks

Hello,

Is it possible to extract the binaryAUC data to plot on UMAP or tSNE plots in a seurat object?

I know it is possible to plot regulonAUC based on a previously solved issue. Somehow I could not find the binary data in the 'int' folder of the SCENIC output.

Thanks,
Po

Hi, @cflerin @s-aibar  since the question #88 hasn't been solved, I open a new issue about this question.  
I do find scenic.loom file in the output folder, not sure if it is available with error reported. Or how can i try another way to export my output to a loom file?
```

> export2scope(scenicOptions, exprMat_filtered)
