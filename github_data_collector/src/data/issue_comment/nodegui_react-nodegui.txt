⚠️ **Dependabot won't automerge this PR as it didn't detect CI on it** ⚠️ 

You have automerging enabled for this repo but Dependabot didn't detect any CI statuses or checks. You can disable automerging on this repo from [here](https://app.dependabot.com/accounts/nodegui/projects/109851).

I tried to use a style sheet on a ScrollArea like so:

```
  QScrollBar { background-color: transparent; }
  QScrollBar::sub-page:horizontal { background-color: red; }
  QScrollBar::add-page:horizontal { background-color: green; }
  QScrollBar::sub-page:vertical { background-color: blue; }
  QScrollBar::add-page:vertical { background-color: yellow; }
```

but it doesn't actually change the scroll bar, so I'm just wondering if I'm doing something wrong, or if there is something that needs to be implemented for this to work.

**Describe the bug**
Opening and closing new windows doesn't work properly when nested inside another window

**To Reproduce**
Run the following example code
````tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Renderer, Window, View, Button, Text } from "@nodegui/react-nodegui";

function MainWindow() {
  const [open1, setOpen1] = useState(false);
  const [open2, setOpen2] = useState(false);
  const [open3, setOpen3] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <Window windowTitle="Main window">
        <View>
          <Button text="Nested in view"   on={{clicked: () => setOpen1(!open1)}}/>
          <Button text="Nested in window" on={{clicked: () => setOpen2(!open2)}}/>
          <Button text="Not nested"       on={{clicked: () => setOpen3(!open3)}}/>
          {open1 && <Dialog text="Nested in view"/>}{/* Does not work */}
        </View>
        {open2 && <Dialog text="Nested in window"/>}{/* Partialy working */}
      </Window>
      {open3 && <Dialog text="Not nested"/>}{/* This works */}
    </>
  );
}

function Dialog({text}: {text: string}) {
  return (
    <Window windowTitle={text}>
      <View>
        <Text>{text}</Text>
      </View>
    </Window>
  )
}

Renderer.render(<MainWindow />);
````

**Expected behavior**
That windows can be open and closed no matter where they are placed in the react tree.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Linux
 - NodeGUI version: 0.12.1
 - React NodeGUI version: 0.4.0 
 - OS Version: Arch Linux

I append text to the control QPlainTextEdit after interval, please help me how to scroll to the bottom,

I can't find any APIs: [https://docs.nodegui.org/docs/api/generated/classes/qplaintextedit](https://docs.nodegui.org/docs/api/generated/classes/qplaintextedit)

Thanks
**Describe the bug**
When following steps on Getting started block, got an error with CMake.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Clone project from GitHub
2. Go to project folder
3. Run `npm install`
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
Dependencies installed.

**Screenshots**

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: `macOS`
 - NodeGUI version: `0.6.7`
 - React NodeGUI version: `0.2.6`
 - OS Version: `10.15.1`


**Additional context**
The problem is gone when install CMake using `brew`. I think to add install CMake requirement to Getting started page for not confusing people.

![nodegui](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32788126/65655706-b6234300-e03a-11e9-9008-c4c90d47ec56.jpg)
on  npm start  get below error 

error in index.ts 
Module not found : Error  : cant resolve  @nodegui/nodegui  in c/user/lenovo/node-sarter/src
npm ERR! nodegui-starter@1.0.0 start .......

 - OS: windows 7

Kindly suggest

**Supporting inline SVG**

React by default can support inline svg code. Because NodeGUI does not render to a browser window though, we can't use that.

**Possible Solutions**
One solution might be to bridge [QTSvg](https://docs.huihoo.com/qt/4.2/qtsvg.html) albeit I am not savvy enough to do this.

**Sample code that triggered error**
```
import React from 'react';
import { letterFrequency } from '@vx/mock-data';
import { Group } from '@vx/group';
import { Bar } from '@vx/shape';
import { scaleLinear, scaleBand } from '@vx/scale';

const data = letterFrequency;

const width = 500;
const height = 500;
const margin = { top: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20, right: 20 };

const xMax = width - margin.left - margin.right;
const yMax = height - margin.top - margin.bottom;

const x = (d: any) => d.letter;
const y = (d: any) => +d.frequency * 100;

const xScale = scaleBand({
  rangeRound: [0, xMax],
  domain: data.map(x),
  padding: 0.4,
});
const yScale = scaleLinear({
  rangeRound: [yMax, 0],
  domain: [0, Math.max(...data.map(y))],
});

const compose = (scale: any, accessor: any) => (data: any) => scale(accessor(data));
const xPoint = compose(
  xScale,
  x,
);
const yPoint = compose(
  yScale,
  y,
);

function BarGraph() {
  return (
    <svg width={width} height={height}>
      {data.map((d: any, i: any) => {
        const barHeight = yMax - yPoint(d);
        return (
          <Group key={`bar-${i}`}>
            <Bar x={xPoint(d)} y={yMax - barHeight} height={barHeight} width={xScale.bandwidth()} fill="#fc2e1c" />
          </Group>
        );
      })}
    </svg>
  );
}
export default BarGraph;
``

Hello, look like a really promising project. 

Do you know if it's possible and if it would be hard to provide a way to create native menu like `File` `Edit`, etc ?

Something like this : https://electronjs.org/docs/api/menu

maybe even something like dock menu : 
https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/macos-dock

I didn't use Qt in many many years but would making the bindings be a hard thing to do?
