Currently it seems it is not possible to include a file, is that the case? Other
projects have this built in:

https://gohugo.io/functions/readfile

Windows builds are failing. This PR attempts to find and fix the issues preventing it from passing.
This adds a virtual box that can be brought up configured for sculpin, using https://github.com/liip/drifter/ (which in turn uses vagrant). Completely optional, but can help in getting consistency into the environment in which sculpin runs. Adding additional things like a database etc is also made much easier with this.
Currently attempting to create a namespaced path: https://symfony.com/doc/4.1/templating/namespaced_paths.html and doesn't seem to be possible but please advise if I'm incorrect.

Would expect something along the lines of:

```
sculpin_twig:
    view_paths: ['_views', '_layouts', '_partials', '_includes']
    paths:
        'path/to/my/thing': my_thing
```
It can be quite difficult to understand how all the pieces of Sculpin fit together - in fact, it seems a bit more difficult than is necessary for what the tool does. This is partly because it's based on earlier versions of Symfony, partly because it used to be oriented around being a phar (with embedded composer), and partly because some of the internals are just ... tangled.

When starting on a refactor of this, it would be a good idea to add some new functional test cases to ensure that some currently untested real-world usages of Sculpin are handled as expected - this would help to prevent surprises. Things like bundles/plugins, themes, etc.
In `generate --watch --server` mode it might be helpful to have some way of editing the site within the browser. Particularly if it could handle errors more gently than Sculpin currently does, in case a typo causes a crash and leaves the web browser disconnected.
Getting this error when trying to do the Hello World basic project: https://sculpin.io/documentation/basic-project/
Version: 3.0.0-rc1

When I run `vendor\bin\sculpin.bat generate --watch --server` it keeps giving this error:
`Didn't find at least one of this type : posts`

This is my composer.json:
```
{                                                      
    "require": {                                       
        "dflydev/embedded-composer": "1.0.x-dev",      
        "sculpin/sculpin": "3.0.0-rc1"                 
    }                                                  
}                                                      
```
I'd like to propose the following feature.

filtered pagination is providing an opportunity to generate an overview page only with blog posts which have a certain meta block provided. It is indifferent if it is part of a list or a simple string. 

example
In blog post itself:
```
---
...
show: this
...
---
```

in overview page:
```
---
...
generator: pagination
pagination:
  max_per_page: 9
  provider: filtered.posts.show.this
...
---
```

On this overview page will now appear only entries with the meta information 'show: this'.

I hope you find this feature helpful and consider to merge it in.

I'm trying to create myself a web blog and want to include images to my blog posts, so I created a new folder into my _posts-folder and give it the same name as the .md file inside it. Then I put some images in my posts folder and linked them in the .md-file. 
When I'm not trying to fetch the posts I get twice the posts I really have on my _posts-folder. Is it not possible to have posts-folder or did I something wrong?

folder structure:
- source
-- _posts
--- sample
---- sample.md
---- image.jpg
