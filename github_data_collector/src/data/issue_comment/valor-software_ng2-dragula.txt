<!-- Note: Please fill out the below. IF YOU DO NOT, YOUR ISSUE WILL BE CLOSED AUTOMATICALLY. -->

**REQUIRED: Before filing a usage question**

Change each `[ ]` to `[x]`  when you have done it.

- [x] My issue title starts with `[usage question]`
- [x] I have read the [README](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-dragula), especially the ['classic blunders' section](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-dragula#classic-blunders)
- [x] I have looked at the [demos](https://valor-software.com/ng2-dragula/) to see if my use case has obvious examples.
- [x] I have searched the [`ng2-dragula` issues](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-dragula/issues), including closed issues.
- [x] I have browsed [the issues labeled "future reference"](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-dragula/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22future+reference%22) for problems that have been solved before.

**Use case description (required)**
When providing a nested array of data everything is working perfectly. However, when providing the EXACT SAME data structure via a BehaviorSubject subscription (async pipe) and drag the items in a particular way it results in the UI duplicating the item, however the model remains correct. 

A clear and concise description of what you want to achieve.
I hope to be able to throw nested data at this template and be able to manipulate it as the user sees fit. 

**Can you show a demo, or a picture of what you want to achieve?**
Steps to reproduce:
Visit: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ng2-dragula-base-kzxgfm and click `use static data` and try dragging an item from one column to another. 2. Select the same 'named exercise' however a different one to the one that you dragged back to the original column. All should work as expected. 

Then try to perform this using the dynamic data. See GIF below for an example of this behaviour. 

**Additional context**

*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

**REQUIRED: Before filing a feature request**

Change each `[ ]` to `[x]` when you have done it.

- [ x] My issue title starts with `[feature request]`
- [x ] I have thoroughly read through the README, and the [dragula docs](https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula).
- [x ] I have searched through the **[`ng2-dragula` issues](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-dragula/issues)** for related problems, including closed issues, and I didn't find anything.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I have two lists and I move items from one to another... but there are some items inside that I want them to be fixed on top. I already implemented that they are not draggable by checking class "fixed" on start dragging. But how do I prevent it(them) to be reordered?

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Would be great if I could set a directive to the specific items I don't want to be draggable nor sortable... so when shifting items around they would be fixed in their place




i tried to build, but there so no suuccess
i cant drag one icom, but return in same position or removed self!

cant i have please exampe drag multipe icons inside image (image size 700x400 
and icon size 16x16)

**Describe the bug (required)**

When using Angular 8, just add ng2-dragula as you normally would and everything works fine till compile but on browser console, i am getting the following error:
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: global is not defined
    at Object../node_modules/crossvent/node_modules/custom-event/index.js (index.js:2)
    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:79)

    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:79)
    at Module../src/app/app.module.ts (app.component.ts:9)
    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:79)
```

**To Reproduce (required)**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to 'your angular demo project with latest cli & angular version ^8
2. add dragula & ng2-dragula to your project
3. ng serve or npm run start
4. See error in browser console, project won't run

is this due to ng2-dragula behind the current cli , is there any way i can use it with angular v8 since my project is already most done with newer version.
possibly related to #849 but that thread is talking about angular cli 6 while i am using 8, please suggest the best.

thanks

**Describe the bug (required)**

We've been using ng2-dragula (latest version), and sets some items to be 'droppable' using `accept` option. While setting the others as non `accepted` ones.

Upon dragging the draggable item, passing through the accepted one.
We found out that dropping it into unaccepted item still can be done eventhough the `target` still detects as the previously hovered `accept` ones.

Please kindly assist

**To Reproduce (required)**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Set any item (not all of them) as `accept` on ng2-dragula options
2. Drag the draggable item hover pass the accept
3. Drop the draggable item into the item that not listed within the `accept`
4. It will still trigger the drop, and will still gave `target result (despite the target still remains to be the hovered one).

**Versions (required)**
 - `@angular/core`: 8.2.13
 - `ng2-dragula`: 2.1.1

**Browsers affected (optional)**
Tested on Google Chrome Version 78.0.3904.97 (Official Build) (64-bit)
