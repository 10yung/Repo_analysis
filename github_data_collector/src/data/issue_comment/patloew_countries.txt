Hi sir, i want try your mvvm structure but i got exception, kotlin-template (android studio 3.4) (kotlin 1.3.21)
```java
e: error: incremental out directory should be set to aar output directory.
e: [kapt] An exception occurred: java.lang.RuntimeException: failure, see logs for 
details.
```
Navigator is injected into ViewModels and used there.
What is the correct way of adding some shared views to navigation?
Hi Patloew,

I really appreciate your work for this template, and I want to learn your template, but I don't know where to get started. Would you like give me some guidelines or instruction for using this template?

thank you
- Use kotlin stdlib functions where applicable.
- Use marginStart/End instead of marginLeft/Right where possible.
