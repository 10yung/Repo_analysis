Modified Terminal-Icons.format.ps1xml to format output of Length property into B|KB|MB|GB respectively.
## Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->
This adds a formatted Length output for files and directories (including sub-folders). Makes the output slower (though it's reasonably fast even for bigger folders), but also adds useful more readable info.

Thanks a lot for creating such a nice module. Something I'm missing a bit when using Terminal-Icons is having a formatted Length output, indicating the size of files and folders in B|KB|MB|GB respectively. 
I have created a pull request with a modified Terminal-Icons.format.ps1xml file to add this.
When `Get-ChildItem` results contain a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file, the file name has an extra space prepended in front of it when Terminal-Icons is imported. Tested with multiple fonts, including fonts without glyphs, all come back with a space in front of that file. Also tested multiple paths.

## Expected Behavior
`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`'s file name is aligned with the rest of the files.

Normal output before importing Terminal-Icons:

## Current Behavior

## Possible Solution
Remove extra space?

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
<!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->
<!--- reproduce this bug. Include code to reproduce, if relevant -->
1. Change location to a path with a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file in it.
2. `Get-ChildItem`

Thanks so much for the module! I want exactly what's in the screenshot on Twitter. Can you create QuickStart guide on how to do that? Which font you used, etc. That way we can expand into the module slowly?
