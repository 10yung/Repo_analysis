In #34021 the ngtsc compiler gained the ability to emit type parameter
constraints, which would generate imports for any type reference that
is used within the constraint. However, the `AbsoluteModuleStrategy`
reference emitter strategy did not consider interface declarations as a
valid declaration it can generate an import for, throwing an error
instead.

This commit fixes the issue by including interface declarations in the
logic that determines whether something is a declaration.

Fixes #34837
In #34564, I only support hover over the directive name. And have a problem, when hovering over `*ngFor="exp"`, it will show `ngForOf` property of `NgForOf` class, this pr will show `(directive) CommonModule.NgForOf: class`. This PR also supports the microsyntax(e.g. `trackBy `, `of`).

## Other information

Fixes Ivy detecting changes inside child embedded views, even though they're detached.

Note that there's one subtlety here: I made the changes inside `refreshDynamicEmbeddedViews` rather than `refreshView`, because we support detecting changes on a detached view (evidenced by a couple of unit tests), but only if it's triggered directly from the view's `ChangeDetectorRef`, however we shouldn't be detecting changes in the detached child view when something happens in the parent.

Fixes #34816.
earlier in the docs it was told that adding typescript's type checking makes JSON response typed so changed docs to say that it adds all typescript capabilities during compile time

Fixes #34746
