The BASIC code does not run unless the line numbers are a multiple of 10.
Also contains code for a terminal based BASIC compiler.
on line 194:
replace

``` scala
def RUN() = gotoLine(lines.keys.toList.sort((l,r) => l < r).first)
```

with

``` scala
def RUN() = gotoLine(lines.keys.toList.sortWith((l, r) => l < r).head)
```

I believe on Scala 2.10+ (that I have tested) the sort definition is not available anymore.

Just a suggestion. SBT will help you run tests and build easier.
Right now it looks like tests are run via a shell script.

Baysick should support subroutines.  They would work something like this:

```
10 PRINT "Subroutine test"
20 LET ('a := 0)
30 PRINT "Variable is " % 'a    // prints 0
40 GOSUB inc
50 PRINT "Variable is " % 'a    // prints 1
60 SUB "inc"
70 LET ('a := 'a + 1)
80 RETURN
90 GOSUB 60
100 PRINT "Variable is " % 'a    // prints 2
110 END
```

-m
