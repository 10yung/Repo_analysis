Not sure if I got it right, but it seems like you have to push and pop the ExpandingTableViewController, is there any easy and clean way how to push a UIViewController?
Hi,

I created an UIView in xib file(front container) instead of the background image. How can I set the header of TableViewControler with my UIView? 

Thank you very much!
Adding `pod 'expanding-collection'` and running pod install makes compilation errors.
Hello,

How can i align this to the top of the screen ?

let insets = automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets has a Swift Compiler Warning.
'automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets' was deprecated in iOS 11.0: Use UIScrollView's contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior instead

Hi developers
`The func collectionView (_ collectionView: UICollectionView, didSelectItemAtIndexPath indexPath: IndexPath)` method of DemoApp DemoViewController is not called, but how do you pick up the event of didSelectItemAtIndexPath.

```
extension ExpandingViewController: UICollectionViewDataSource, UICollectionViewDelegate {

    // Need to add method ??
    open func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, didSelectItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
    }

}
```
Once you have access the UITableViewController you have the image that comes from the collection view cell on top of the view. How can you reload or change that image for a new one in the same UITableViewController without going back to the collection view?
