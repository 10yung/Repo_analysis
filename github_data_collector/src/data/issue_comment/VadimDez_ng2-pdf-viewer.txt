On chrome and firefox with a pdf-viewer without height I cannot navigate to an outline, or navigate to a page.
It's seems to be working only for edge.
If i want the navigation and the scrolling to work I have to put a height to the container of the pdf-viewer.

Hi, I've been struggling to find this issue but I could not make a progress so I'm posting it here..
Basically, I want to use pdf-viewer component embedded in a div. 

I have two divs, left and right. 
The left side has pdf-viewer component and since it's long it uses the window's scrollbar. But I don't want to let the right component div to move so I gave a fixed height like 70vh to .ng2-pdf-viewer-container class. It uses the scrollbar in that div instead of window scrollbar and now all the features moving the scrollbar such as scrollToPageView() and searching the words in the pdf document is not working. 

I'm assuming it manipulates the window's scrollbar not the scrollbar inside .ng2-pdf-viewer-container div. When I search a word, I want it to scroll to the searched word or when I want to go to the page that I'm looking for I want that scrollbar to locate to that page. 

Does anyone know how I can do this with ng2-pdf-viewer?

Thanks.

PR #508 introduced a regression in release 5.3.4.

A PDF file can be rotated when created/edited with a PDF tool (Adobe Reader, Preview, etc).
The rotation is stored in the PDF file as a property: `/Rotate 270 ` e.g.

Open a PDF in a text editor to check if it has rotation.

Note: page orientation (portrait vs landscape) has nothing to do with rotation.

**Before release 5.3.4**
The scale was computed as follows
```
scale = this.getScale((page as any).getViewport({ scale: 1 }).width);
```
As explained [here](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/8307#issuecomment-294984298), if the `rotation` parameter is not defined, PDFJS uses the `Rotate` property defined in the PDF file.

**Since release 5.3.4**
The scale is computed as follows
```
scale = this.getScale(
  (page as any).getViewport({ scale: 1, rotation: this._rotation })
    .width
);
```
By default, the scale is computed assuming no rotation (`this._rotation = 0`).

So, if the PDF file contains a rotation of 90, 270, etc., width and height are inverted and the PDF is displayed in the viewer with a scrollbar on the x axis (if width is originally smaller than height).

This bug cannot be solved by setting the `[rotation]` option.

**Solutions**
One solution (hot fix) is not to specify rotation in the scale computation if the `rotation` option has not been specified by the user. However, the `rotation` option will still not work for PDFs that already contain a rotation.

A better solution would be to take into account the `Rotate` property of the PDF.


Bugfix #539

Stop multiple emits of pageChange, which was causing a multi-page view problem when the user switched pages rapidly and repeatedly.
Here are my stepsï¼š
1.Get pdf resource address: filePath
2.set the variable 
 `  this.filePath = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl (filePath)`
3. html
`<pdf-viewer id = "pdf-set"  [render-text] = "true"  [src] = "filePath"></ pdf-viewer>`

I got this error: `ERROR Error: Invalid parameter object: need either .data, .range or .url`

I am displaying the test PDF (https://vadimdez.github.io/ng2-pdf-viewer/assets/pdf-test.pdf) with the following HTML, in an Ionic 4 app:

```
<ion-content class="ion-padding">
    <pdf-viewer [src]="pdf" [original-size]="false" style="display: block;"></pdf-viewer>
</ion-content>
```
On Android 9 and 10 (in emulator), it works as expected:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34931916/70399221-f60e9980-1a71-11ea-8b7d-fd523962af4a.png" width="200" >

  On Android 8 (in emulator), the display is not rendered correctly (graphics are missing), and as you scroll the screen up and down, black rectangles flicker on the screen and eventually the app locks up:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34931916/70399304-b2685f80-1a72-11ea-814e-4c2a10bb0094.png" width="200" >

I tried pdf viewer versions 6.0.0, 6.0.2 and also the 4.1.2 that I originally used - all the same.

Part of this change caused zooming to no longer function properly.
https://github.com/VadimDez/ng2-pdf-viewer/pull/445

I have put the code back exactly as it was before on width and tested it.
Zoom behaves as it did before.

Please see Issue #524 for details

in html I wrote
`{{cond}}`
in ts I wrote 
  `get cond(){
    console.log('update')
    return null;
  }`

and console.log a lot of times . sometimes doesnot stop
