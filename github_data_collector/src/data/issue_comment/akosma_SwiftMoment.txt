## Detailed Description

I'm having problems running the framework in Swift 4 the project simply stops running when it comes to checking the framework SwiftMoment I'm in the latest version of Swift 4 and Xcode. If I'm not mistaken in this last update, the class set that started with NS was untouched.
Xcode basically complains about all Swift class that starts with NS it complains.

How do you get hour in military time (0-23) vs. (1-12)?

moment().hour // returns 1-12


I'm trying to get tomorrow's date like this, but it just returns today's.

moment().add(1, "days").format("MMMM do")

This works fine in Javascript
moment().add(1, "days").format("MMMM Do")

## Your Environment
Swift 4.0
Xcode Version 9.2 (9C40b)


It seems to subtract 30 days instead of 1 whole month.

## Detailed Description
If the starting date is 1/30/2018, and I subtract 1 month, it becomes 12/31/2017, I would have expected 12/30/2017. If I subtract 2 months, it becomes 12/01/2017. I would have expected it to be 11/30/2017.

## Detailed Description

`getLanguageBundle` is returning nil. Strangely, `locale.identifier` is returning  `zh-TW`, without the "Hant".

The 2nd part of  `getLanguageBundle` therefore only get the language code as `zh`.

Since now the bundle only has `zh-Hant`, no localized string is found.

## Context

Localization does not work for Taiwan app users.

## Possible Implementation

I believe another  fallback using Bundle to load will work.

## Detailed Description
When I use the `moment().endOf("M")` in many 31 days months, as December, the return is the day 30th.

`moment().endOf("M").format("dd/MM/YYYY")` return 30/12/2017

## Context
I use this to show the start and end of a month report

## Environment
* Version used: 0.7

In momentjs, we simply do `moment().utc().format()`, how would we accomplish this in SwiftMoment?

For completion, this is what I ended up doing using `Date()` and `TimeFormatter()`


```
    let UTCDate = Date()
    let formatter = DateFormatter()
    formatter.dateFormat = "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'"
    formatter.timeZone = TimeZone(secondsFromGMT:0)
    let utcTime = formatter.string(from: UTCDate)
 ```

Thank you
There's a bug when getting EndOf a year

## Detailed Description
```swift
let now = moment()
let endYear = now.subtract(1, .Years).endOf(.Years)  // 2016-12-30 23:59:59
```
expected result is `2016-12-31 23:59:59`
## Detailed Description

Using `fromNow()` did not return the localized version for "%d days ago" and others.

The string format used in `fromNow()` is `%%1.0f %@days ago`, but in the strings files all uses `%d` and not `%f`, therefore it never get matched.

## Context

Seems like a broken change.

## Possible Implementation

Change the format to `%d days ago`, and use `value` as `Int`.
