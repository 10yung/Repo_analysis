@gundalow I would like to switch the default location of published documentation of molecule from  https://molecule.readthedocs.io  to  https://docs.ansible.com/molecule/ so it would also match how ansible-lint is published.

Do you think this is possible?
# Issue Type
This is a doc bug regarding gitlab-ci config

# Bug report
PR https://github.com/ansible/molecule/pull/2112 edited the gitlab-ci config to remove tags and make it more generic. It also removed the part of the config where the virtualenv is setup. However, the descriptive text in the docs still contains:

```Here is an example setting up a virtualenv and testing an Ansible role via Molecule. User-level pip is cached and so is the virtual environment to save time. And this is run over a runner tagged pip36 and docker, because its a minimal CentOS 7 VM installed with pip36 from IUS repository and docker.```

# Desired Behavior

This is confusing given that the example config no longer uses tags or venv. I would suggest adding a separate config for users who want to use tags, and a more generic one for those who don't. I actually think the example using a venv is valuable and should be added back.
Either this, or the descriptive text needs to change to reflect what is actually in the current example.

# Issue Type

- Feature request

It's possible to provide a template for scenario with `--driver-template` but it's quite limited.
Is there a way to change the `molecule.yml` template ?

# Desired Behavior

Please give some details of the feature being requested

I'm using the same `molecule.yml` file for role testing, with the only difference being the instance name and the docker image to use (for my docker based tests). In reality, it's the same `molecule.yml` everywhere and I'm using variables.

Of course, it's not the same as the default one provided by molecule. It would be nice if it was possible to provide a template for it, instead of using `molecule init scenario ...` and then overwrite the `molecule.yml` file. That would make one thing less to do.

We should migrate from Travis CI to Ansible Zuul CI as this would allow us to test on many other plaforms and also speedup the gating.

We do expect to run Travis and Zuul in paralele for a long time before disabling travis.

## Pending actions

- [ ] @ssbarnea: https://github.com/ansible/ansible-zuul-jobs/issues/292
- [ ] @gundalow  to add [ansible-zuul](https://pypi.org/user/ansible-zuul/) as maintainer of [molecule](https://pypi.org/project/molecule/) package, also to cleanup the list of accounts there (keep two humans as backups in case we ever need to remove a bad release).

## Delayed actions
- [ ] @gundalow to perform repository move to ansible-community
- [ ] @ssbarnea to remove travis config
Here we are testing molecule on zuul.ansible.com. This PR should not be
merged.

Signed-off-by: Paul Belanger <pabelanger@redhat.com>
Fixes: #2488
Depends-On: https://github.com/ansible/ansible-zuul-jobs/pull/311

Podman tests would fail with older version of podman due to missing
cp command.

Now we also check the version and skip the tests if installed version
is too old.

# Desired Behavior
I would like my base-config to merge with molecule.yml correctly. Actually the params `dockerfile`   and `image` from base-config.yml are ignored and skipped in the "Create Dockerfiles from image    names" task. I would like the `molecule_yml.platforms` object to be merged between base-config.yml and molecule.yml at this step. 

# Actual Behaviour

So, currently, my use case is that i have this **base-config.yml** : 
```

    - destroy
verifier:
  name: testinfra
  directory: ../shared_files/tests
  options:
    vvv: true
  lint:
    name: flake8
```

I set my **molecule.yml** as following : 
```
---
platforms:
  - name: molecule-bash-deb
  - name: molecule-bash-rhel
provisioner:
  log: true
scenario:
  name: default
```

I faced this error using `molecule -c ../../test/molecule/base-config.yml test` : 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22600727/71363032-17a27180-2598-11ea-875a-1d6bb69acf8c.png)
  

And as you can see here, i added some debug : 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22600727/71363066-30128c00-2598-11ea-8108-0d8129b8a570.png)


I added a task in the create.yml playbook to check the content of `{{ molecule_yml.platforms }}`. And I can see that there are only `molecule.yml` variables 🧐  
When i decide to fill `image` parameter in my molecule.yml, it gives me the same error but with `dockerfile` parameter. And when i decide to fill `dockerfile` param in my molecule.yml, all works good and the variables used well came from my base-config.yml.   
  
That's why I'm sure that the problem is only from here : 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22600727/71363227-c5158500-2598-11ea-8eee-0f2ab263b086.png)
   
  
**I'm currently investigating to make a PR by myself but if you can drive me it would be good ! **
  
And **PS** yes i saw that PR passed : https://github.com/ansible/molecule/pull/2287/files.
So I tried with `molecule 2.22` & `molecule 3.0a4` and it's not works too for `image` and `dockerfile` params in the "Create Dockerfile from image names" step. (from `create.yml`)
