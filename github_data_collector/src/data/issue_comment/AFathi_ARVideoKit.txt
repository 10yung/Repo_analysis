Hi,
I'm using ARCore to create arvideo, and the codes like this:
 sceneView.scene?.background.contents = videoLayer,

videoLayer.contents = frame.capturedImage as CVPixelBuffer.

but when I record the video, the  videoLayer is frozen. 

ARVideoKit is working well in ARKit.

Thx.
This happens both on `record()` and `.photo()` call.

Error:
```
*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[AVAssetWriterInput initWithMediaType:outputSettings:sourceFormatHint:] 4 is not a valid channel count for Format ID 'aac '.  Use kAudioFormatProperty_AvailableEncodeNumberChannels (<AudioToolbox/AudioFormat.h>) to enumerate available channel counts for a given format.'
```

I doubt it matters but I'm using the Swift 5 branch.
When i install pods it throw's 20 error's and doesn't work properly when i embed framework sceneView doesn't initialize.
I tried to record a video with ".personSegmentationWithDepth" enabled but the resulted video don't keep the frame hiding the 3d object.

Hello
I Started to use ARVideokit in my project but can you help me to preview the video inapp before saving to photo library. I want to add the share button while previewing the video inside the app and then add a save button to save it to photo library
Seems Apple introduced a new render path for the coming iOS 13 release with the RealityKit, but it is not supported currently by ARVideoKit.

My attempt is to record the official "CapturingBodyMotionIn3D" demo project with a modified branch but failed.

Here is my branch:
https://github.com/jerryrt/ARVideoKit/tree/ios_13_reality_kit

Now it only crashes the app, with the following log. Any help/suggestion deeply appreciated.

Hello Ahmed, I'm Amr

I have to make my app with two views of "ARSCNView"
```
    @IBOutlet var sceneViewL: ARSCNView!
    @IBOutlet var sceneViewR: ARSCNView!
```
then should record them on the same video, how can I add it on recorder ?!

`recorder = RecordAR(ARSceneKit: sceneViewL)`
