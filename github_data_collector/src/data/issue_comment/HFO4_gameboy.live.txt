I´ve tryed both windows and linux terminal:
"telnet gameboy.live 1989"
and i always get:
"telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused"

I´ve also tried from mobile phone using 4G
Would be great to easily deploy / use with a docker embeded version
Hi,

I am providing about 4.6k roms and finding the right game is quite hard.

Please implement some sort of paging or search mechanism.
