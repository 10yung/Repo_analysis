#165 现在参数不输入pid的情况下，会列出java的pid列表给用户输入。
vtop还要先jps/ps看一下pid然后再用不是很方便
如题，动态隔离线程池这个酷炫功能啥时候能上？

[vjmap readme](https://github.com/vipshop/vjtools/blob/master/vjmap/README.md)上说支持CMS和ParallelGC,为什么报错呢

`./vjmap.sh -old 3887`
Error Happen:Only support CMS GC. Unsupport heap:sun.jvm.hotspot.gc_implementation.parallelScavenge.ParallelScavengeHeap


你好，请问vjtools有没有计划支持java 11啊
拼写错误
Rule 5. 【推荐】如果变量值仅有有限的可选值，用枚举类来定义常量

尤其是变量还希望带有名称之外的延伸属性时，如下例：

//WRONG
public String MONDAY = "MONDAY";
public int MONDAY_SEQ = 1;

//RIGHT
public enum SeasonEnum { 
    SPRING(1), SUMMER(2), AUTUMN(3), WINTER(4); 
    int seq; 
    SeasonEnum(int seq) { this.seq = seq; }
}
默认的default的访问域是不能跨包的，如果枚举类放在基础包下的话，seq的访问就无法生效了。所以感觉这里写的不够严谨。
