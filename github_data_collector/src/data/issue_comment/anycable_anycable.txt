There should be a way to estimate these parameters before real usage

Hey everyone!

First, here is the survey for AnyCable users: https://evilmartians.typeform.com/to/W35uRm.
We want to learn more about you to make this piece of software better.

This thread (not a an issue at all) aims to collect your feedback/stories in a free form:
- “How and why I switched to AnyCable”
- “How AnyCable helped us to improve the app performance”
- “Why we migrated from AnyCable to X” (yep, un-success stories are welcomed too)

That would help others to decide whether AnyCable is the right tool or not, and help us to improve it.

Please, comment on this issue to share your story!

Currently, AnyCable requires Redis as a dependency for the only one thing: sending messages from the application to the WebSocket server for broadcastings (`ActionCable.server.broadcast ...`).

The idea is to provide more options for the users and thus not to require Redis for everyone.

TODO adapters:

- [ ] HTTP REST – great for development/testing, small projects with the only one websocket server instance
- [ ] [PostgreSQL pub/sub](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actioncable/lib/action_cable/subscription_adapter/postgresql.rb)
- [x] Redis Sentinel (see https://github.com/anycable/anycable-rails/issues/3)
- [ ] RabbitMQ

Other possible options:
- UDP ?
- ...
