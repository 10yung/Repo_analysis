This package doesn't seem to work with Composer Autoload.

I've seen that a similar issue was already opened #346 but I don't seem to be able to make this work.

Right now as a workaround I had to put this in my own project's `composer.json`:

```
"autoload": {
    "files": ["vendor/wp-bootstrap/wp-bootstrap-navwalker/class-wp-bootstrap-navwalker.php"]
},
```

But this is not needed with other packages that I use and I would prefer it `wp-bootstrap-navwalker` could load itself as well.

Thank you :-)
Is there a way to easily add classes to elements of the dropdown submenus, in order to correctly style them and their child elements?

Right now, they always get the default styles, which is a white background whit blue highlight.

Is it possible to somehow pass list of classes to add to the relevant elements when the `WP_Bootstrap_Navwalker()` is instantiated?  This would make it easier to always keep the relevant styling, because by directly modifying `wp-bootstrap-navwalker.php` all customizations would be lost when updating to new released versions. 

As an example, with a simple dropdown with just one sublevel, I think that the elements that should be able to receive list of classes should be:
`ul.dropdown-menu` > `li.nav-item` > `a.dropdown-item`.

I don't know what could be the best way to accomplish this, but like I said, a suggestion could be to have variables containing list of classes passed down when instantiating the class, in a similar way of the Wordpress core function `wp_nav_menu()`
I have the challenge that I need to change

```
ul.dropdown-menu
li itemscope=...
```

to

```
div.dropdown-menu
a.dropdown-item bg-transparent
```

and don't know how to do it. Does someone know?

PS: Basically I want to create a basic Bootstrap markup https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/ as overall project requirements need the markup to be exactly like this (no css tweaking).

Thanks for contributing this, super helpful.

I just ran into a limitation that I thought might impact others. I had not run into an issue with this before, but I needed to control [dropdown menu alignment](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/dropdowns/#menu-alignment) and found I could not.

I added the following within start_lvl() replacing line 50:

`if ( isset( $args->dropdown_menu_class ) )
            {
				$classes = explode(" ", $args->dropdown_menu_class );
            }
            else 
            {
                // Default class to add to the file.
                $classes = array( 'dropdown-menu' );
            }`

Then usage looks like such:

`'dropdown_menu_class' => 'dropdown-menu dropdown-menu-right'`



The following code wouldn't work when escaping html in the title attribute (using ACF plugin):
```php
function my_wp_nav_menu_objects($items, $args) {
	foreach ($items as &$item) {
		$image = get_field('image', $item);

		if ($image) {
			$item->title = '<img alt="' . $item->title . '" class="img-fluid" src="' . $image . '" title="' . $item->title . '" />';
		}
	}

	return $items;
}
add_filter('wp_nav_menu_objects', 'my_wp_nav_menu_objects', 10, 2);
```

Removing `esc_html` fixes it.

Add menu item type checking for WPML support. 

When using the WPML plugin while using this nav walker, the menu item is displayed with escaped HTML instead of just outputting HTML. If the menu item does not contain a flag, we can safely strip all HTML tags

Fixes #

#### Changes proposed in this Pull Request:

* Added 'wpml-ls-flag' check in the menu item title to ensure flags are displayed correctly, otherwise just strip tags. If the menu item type is not 'wpml_ls_menu_item', just escape the html

#### Testing instructions:

* Use this nav walker while adding a WPML language switcher to the same menu.
