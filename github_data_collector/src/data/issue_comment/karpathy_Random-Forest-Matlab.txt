What to do at the edge cases, when a branch has no data?
How can we use the same code for image classification for image processing?
```
Undefined function or variable 'treeTrain'.

Error in forestTrain (line 39)
        treeModels{i} = treeTrain(X, Y, opts);

Error in mnistforHoHD (line 58)
model = forestTrain(double(traningImage), double(traningLavel), 26);
```
