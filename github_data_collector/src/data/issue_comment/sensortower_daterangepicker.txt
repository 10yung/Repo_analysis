Hey,

The week no does not get displayed in the week section.

I have made the desired changes in the fork repo(https://github.com/AltamashShaikh/daterangepicker), but in the js file.

Can you check if its helpful and can be merged, I can send a pull request after that

Thanks,
Altamash Shaikh

Hi 
I have attached above the screenshot for reference.

I have made some customization in this plugin and attached screenshot is showing week Period view that means i can select weeks. One whole week is selected upon clicking any row of calendar. 
Now, 
I had my requirement to set the first day of week according to configuration. Lets say if First day of week is Monday then it should appear as first day and date should be accordingly adjusted. I am facing this issue that week days are rotated correctly but the date is not rotating.

For Eg. 29th Sept is appearing under Monday but it should appear under Sunday. How can I fix this Issue ? 

Thanks
Currently, there is no way to display week numbers in the calendar table. It would be great to add a new column before week days (as shown on the attached image). Thank you!

Can we have a destroy method for destroying a particular daterangepicker?
I need to remove the apply and cancel button. Automatically update the selected date range to input field
In the documentation, its stated:

> Sets time zone. If you want to use user's computer time zone, pass null

However the code which implements this, will always cast the null into "UTC".
`Config.prototype._timeZone = function(val) {
      return ko.observable(val || 'UTC');
 }`

So passing null does not have the desired effect, and instead its reverted to UTC.
I'm looking for a timezone aware date range picker. I hoped this one could be it, but unfortunately I need a time picker which this one doesn't provide. It made me think though, why are there timezone settings for this date range picker even?
Is there an option to edit the quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) and also change the first month of the year and hence the span of a quarter.
For eg: I want my year to start in on 1st April and end on 31st March (According to Indian Financial Calender) and Q1 to be replaced by Quarter-1 and Q1 should start on 1st April and end three months after that. Is there a way I can achieve this using this library ?

Please let me know, is there any option to open daterangepicker above input element.
Ex:- like in other daterangepickers there is an option to pass (drops:-below/above) to open.
