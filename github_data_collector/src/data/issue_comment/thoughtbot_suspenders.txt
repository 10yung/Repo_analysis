This adds a description to all of our generators, except for the main
one. The main one will continue to use the `USAGE` file.

The descriptions are stored in a Markdown file under
`templates/descriptions`, named after the generator. For example,
`Suspenders::ViewsGenerator` is described by
`templates/descriptions/views.md`.

A little metaprogramming is used in the parent class to make this
seamless for the generators.

While here, fix a few generators:

- `.env` is now `.sample.env`.
- Move the `remove_prior_config` method up, so we don't remove the
config that we just added.
We locked Sprockets to `< 3` in https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders/pull/1007 to get around some CI failures, but this constraint may make it more difficult to upgrade Rails.
spent the past 2 days on this, I am not 100% sure why this happens, when deploying project generated by suspenders. The application deployed on elasticbeanstalk doesnt boot up correctly and, and it silently fails? I tried on cloudwatch and pull logs, it doesnt show any crash error, but neither does it boot. 

I have tested this with rails 6.0 ruby 2.6/2.5, on both phusion passenger and puma 2.6/2.5 of the elastic beanstalk. 

when deploy a vanilla rails 6 project to the exact same stack, the application works fine. I think possibly due to the puma config in cluster mode, I tried to copy and paste the vanilla config from rails 6, but that doesnt seem to work either. Neither honeybadger nor skylight reports any crash error when trying to reach the site, my assumption was that the application isnt even running after deployment. 

any idea on the possible causes? 
Rails and Puma added support for early hints in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/30744 and https://github.com/puma/puma/pull/1403. We could enable this by default by adding `early_hints` to our puma config.
https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/31241 removed the advice to use `worker_on_boot` in config/puma.rb. I am guessing we can drop that now as well.
Hello - this is more of a question than an issue (please correct me if this is the wrong place to ask), but I was wondering why the `suspenders` scaffold registers a new javascript driver for headless Chrome, when the driver [:selenium_chrome_headless](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/blob/3.28_stable/lib/capybara/registrations/drivers.rb) is pre-registered in capybara.
I don't understand this yet but [Rails 6 will be introducing an `ActionDispatch::HostAuthorization` middleware](https://medium.com/rubyinside/whats-coming-to-rails-6-0-8ec79eea66da#831a) that automatically configures itself. A quick search indicates that [it configures itself via the `config.hosts` value](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/528c5bb224a2f9ea6eee7b15ef5de5e9d17bf309/railties/lib/rails/application/default_middleware_stack.rb#L16).

We should probably find a way to set that.
Filter from the back trace commonly used gems during RSpec failure logging. Many framework gems are rarely relevant in tracing testing errors, particularly while doing TDD, and their presence in the failure log makes it more difficult to find the test error that is driving the next change. 

For example, 

```ruby
GEMS_TO_EXCLUDE_FROM_BACKTRACE = %w[
  bootsnap
  capybara
  delayed_job
  factory_bot
  honeybadger
  rack
  railties
  shoulda-matchers
  skylight
  sprockets-rails
]

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.filter_rails_from_backtrace!
  config.filter_gems_from_backtrace(*GEMS_TO_EXCLUDE_FROM_BACKTRACE)
end
```

RSpec allows developers to temporarily suspend this filtering through the use of the `--backtrace` flag should seeing those gems be necessary.
Writing a simple feature test to start with:

*spec/features/user-sees-homepage_spec.rb*
```
feature 'User sees homepage' do
  scenario 'and it works' do
    visit "/"
  end
end
```

Leads to the following error (partial trace):

```
$ bundle exec rspec
```
```
NoMethodError:
  undefined method `feature' for main:Object
# ./spec/features/user-sees-homepage_spec.rb:1:in `<main>'
# -e:1:in `<main>'
Run options: include {:locations=>{"./spec/features/user-sees-homepage_spec.rb"=>[3]}}

All examples were filtered out

It might be nice to keep related configuration grouped together.
