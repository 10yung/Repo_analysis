Once interfaces ( or other entities ) have been defined inside the main application `/src/**` and imported from within `/functions` --> `import { InterfaceTest } from '../../src/app/path';`, where the path resolves to a file within a sibling of `/functions`, the folder structure of compiled output generated by `tsc` in the `/functions` folder changes to reflect the "touched" structure of the imports from `/src/app`.


Is there a method i'm missing for using types within both projects? Aside from adding more build steps or a type file.
