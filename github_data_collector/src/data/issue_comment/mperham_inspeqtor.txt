Here's some information that may help.
- mysql.inq
```
check service mysql with hostname localhost, port 3306, username root, socket /tmp/mysql.sock
  if memory:rss > 1g then alert
  if mysql:Queries > 5/sec then alert
  if mysql:Seconds_Behind_Master > 3 then alert
```
- mysql version: 5.7.24
- os version: Ubuntu 16.04
-  installed by: apt-get install inspeqtor ./inspeqtor_2.0.0-1_amd64.deb

I'm not an expert in mysql, but I tried to run `show status;` in mysql and found no field like "Slave_running". I wonder how can I fix it, or what can I do about it. 

Thanks in advance. :P 
Hi, I am finding this project quite interesting to build it on embedded devices (ARM/MIPS & so on).
Unluckily I hit a wall as there are some dependencies that requires native compiling tools and they fail with short or no debug message

I am trying to do this inside a docker container for reproducibility, will paste it below

```
FROM alpine:3.9 as build

ENV RELEASE_VERSION=2.0.0-1
ENV RELEASE_URL=https://github.com/mperham/inspeqtor/archive/v$RELEASE_VERSION.zip

RUN apk add -qU \
  go \
  git \
  make \
  gcc \
  libc-dev \
  curl \
  unzip

WORKDIR /app

RUN curl -o "inspeqtor.zip" -L $RELEASE_URL \
  && unzip inspeqtor.zip \
  && cd inspeqtor-$RELEASE_VERSION
  && make prepare \
  && make
```

Can someone help me in producing a working Docker image?

Moreover I am hoping the project dependencies don't hinder it when trying to cross compile for exotic platforms, did anyone try compiling for arm/mips ?

It would be great if Inspeqtor supported CGroup based metrics for CPU and memory usage.

The current method for `total_cpu` and `total_rss` is flawed, since a systemd service represents a CGroup, but the `total_*` metrics only account for the main PID of the service and its children.

However there are cases where multiple parent processes exist in a single CGroup.

For example, if you use NGINX and Passenger, the `nginx` process forks the Passenger watchdog and the nginx master process and then exits, which causes both processes to be adopted by init (PID 1).

This causes Inspegtor to only count memory and cpu usage for the nginx master and the workers it spawns and completely ignores Passenger.

Inspeqtor could either use CGroup CPU and Memory accounting to get the metrics or just get the list of PIDs in the CGroup and use it with the existing methods.

Using CGroup accounting should be more efficient, since it doesn't require recursively walking the pid tree, like the current `total_rss` implementation for Linux.

Documentation for the different cgroup controllers mounted in `/sys/fs/cgroups` can be found here:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v1/
While Amazon SES can be used via SMTP, it would be great to use the Amazon SES API (via `aws-sdk`) so that outbound SMTP isn't needed.
I just upgraded our staging environment to the latest Inspeqtor version (2.0) and swap is always 100% under inspeqtor, when in fact it's actually 0:

I suspect this commit could have broke something? https://github.com/mperham/inspeqtor/commit/41680d7528fd6a63bc885d5159fdb56e478d6cc7#diff-c187630e5b94e88c6486c75cccb5a092L25
I don't want to send any alerts as I am already doing that using datadog, but when I remove the send alert config and restart inspeqtor, it won't start, the log says this
`Please configure a "send alerts" statement in inspeqtor.conf`

is there any way to skip this?
When something breaks, it's often the case that several rules will break at the same time.  Each cycle's email should summarize **all** the rules that are broken and not a single email per rule.  This summary allows the reader to see everything broken at a glance and possibly understand the root cause.
