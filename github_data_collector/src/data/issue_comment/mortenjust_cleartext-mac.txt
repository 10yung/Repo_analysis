https://1000mostcommonwords.com/1000-most-common-english-words/ I see tool on this list of common words. Why is it not allowed?
version 2.45 claims to be version 1.45 when selected in the Finder
These words are used fairly frequently by Trump and should be added.

It may also be a good idea to update the dictionary using some of his newer speeches.
Hey Morten,

first of all thank you for the project. Nice work! üëç 

I have observed some mismatches between the given license of the project and the stated license of the code (mostly the .swift files). In the .swift files it is stated that "all rights reserved" whereas in the License.txt you pasted the GPLv3. My question would be, under what terms i can improve and share your work?

Thanks again and best regards,
Tim

If you type a contraction, OS X automatically changes the upright apostrophe/single quote to a slanted one. Cleartext recognizes "I'm" as a valid word, but not the corrected version "I‚Äôm" (notice the subtle difference in the apostrophe character).

This requires you to quickly type the space after the end of the word before OS X recognizes the contraction and changes the apostrophe, which can get a bit annoying.


v1.4 crashes when switching to "Jobs" or "Hemingway" languages. This is caused by the dictionary filename mismatching the language code. This change corrects the mismatch, and prevents the the app from crashing if a dictionary is not found.

Currently names are rejected. Words beginning with a capital letter should be allowed. 

Example: "Yesterday Patrick said to me..." 

Issue: Patrick is rejected. Proper names are rejected.

Desired result: words that are capitalized should be excluded from the rejection behavior.

The English list is currently more than 1,000 words to cover conjugations. But if we use NSLinguisticTagSchemeLemma, we can find the root word before we look it up in the word list. 

I propose modifying the `isSimple` function in in the `SimpleWords` class, and adding a `lemmaForWord(word:Stirng)` function. 

Here's an example to get you started

``` swift
var question = "We were lovers"
let options: NSLinguisticTaggerOptions = [.OmitWhitespace, .OmitPunctuation, .JoinNames]
let schemes = NSLinguisticTagger.availableTagSchemesForLanguage("en")
let tagger = NSLinguisticTagger(tagSchemes: schemes, options: Int(options.rawValue))
tagger.string = question
tagger.enumerateTagsInRange(NSMakeRange(0, (question as NSString).length), scheme: NSLinguisticTagSchemeLemma, options: options) { (tag, tokenRange, _, _) in
    let token = (question as NSString).substringWithRange(tokenRange)
    print("\(token): \(tag)")
}
```

It returns 

```
We: we
were: be
lovers: lover
```

Once this is in place, we can look into making the lists longer, and providing the user with the option of writing with the 1,000....10,000 most common words.

Similar to issue #24 , but not. I think there is a lot of value in having the unacceptable words highlighted, but allowing the user to easily continue without removing them. I've noticed that I can leave the word there by hitting the down arrow which jumps the cursor ahead by a few characters and disables the highlight. I'm not sure why that works, but I'm glad that it does. 

I'd rather the ability to just highlight the bad words and continue. Then the choice to leave them is intentional, but the app will continue to point the issue out.
