**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Right now we can`t contribute to the making of this programs and having every program in a different package is useless.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Have a repository in the NodeOS organizations like `binutils` with all the programs in the bin-* packages with a unified package named `nodeos-binutils`

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Having a repository for every bin-* package, but this would be very tedious.

Is it possible to create an electron app for NodeOS to act as an application or GUI?
`require('fs').readFileSync('/bin/node').toString('utf8')`, in the interpreter, crashes the entire system.

There's a bunch of extremely fast scrolling text and then the system immediately powers off.
