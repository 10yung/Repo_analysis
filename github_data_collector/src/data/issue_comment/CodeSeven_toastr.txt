Hi,
Is there a way to stack all toasts together at one location in screen and add a counter?

Currently **linkedin** website implements this behavior with the toasts:

Thank you

Notes:
- better is to have a counter per type of toast in the stack (warning, error...)
- if not possible consider this as a feature request :)

When I call the toaster message function that will show console messages also and line no 245, please remove it.
Is there a way to uniquely identify an interdeterminate toast?

I have a potentially long running Ajax operation and I want to be able to close specific toasts, similar to the way that gritter does.
Fixes #438 
## Current Behaviour
With a next.js app, import the toastr styles from `'toastr/build/toastr.css'` and configure the `toastr.options` object, the displayed toastr loses its styles and shows at the bottom of the page.

## Expected Behaviour
The toastr should display properly on the screen, corresponding to the options specified.

I think the css stylesheet isn't injected into the code base.
Is there any method or way to remove the icon of toast?
Hello, have some one know about the option "maxOpened".
option: {
    maxOpened: 1 
}

because I have a problem is need display 3~4 types info 
and check each type by date, decide it can be see or not.

if I use "preventDuplicates", only display 1 type info .

so I search some reference, they suggest use "maxOpened" & "preventDuplicates"
but seens the lastest version, not have the "maxOpened" can set
Clarify that timeout values are in milliseconds. Include more realistic examples of timeout values (3s rather than 30ms).
Steps to Reproduce:
Send javascript in message

Expected Result:
javascript code should be considered as string

Actual Result:
Code is being executed.

Hi,

i use toastr an call the function normaly with e.g. toastr[msgtype](msgtext, msgtitle, {timeOut: 5000, closeButton: true, progressBar: true, positionClass: "toast-top-center"})  

My problem is, that the title is first in the message, but there is no line break. The text is directly after the title.

How can i insert a line break between the title an the message?

Thanks for help!

greets Sascha
