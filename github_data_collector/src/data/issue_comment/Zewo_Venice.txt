https://github.com/Zewo/CLibdill/pull/2 Merge CLIbdll PR First.

This implements several discussed changes to Venice:

1. Bundles libdill directly, this avoids the need to use an apt/brew package
2. Adds coroutine local storage support
3. Refactors coroutines so they manage their own lifetime and clean up automatically
