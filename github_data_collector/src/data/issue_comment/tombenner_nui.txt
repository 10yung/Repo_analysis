I have few classes only which needs theming changes, and I dont want other classes to be changed. here through this library how can i achieve this?
This library is forcing all the classes to be applied through nui.
Any leads would be appreciated.

I want to set UINavigationBar shadow image empty. how to set this in stylesheet file.
I'm trying to use padding with UITextview, but strange results are produced
In the renderer NUITextViewRenderer is used "setContentInset", wouldnt be "setTextContainerInset"?

I recently installed NUI using cocoapods and faced the non-module import issue. After fixing it for myself, I found that Tim had taken care of this matter long back with this pull request: https://github.com/tombenner/nui/pull/307

Can you please help in checking why his change is not part of the latest pod? 
As mentioned in Readme.md: **Its pod name is “NUI”** 
But the users do not get latest changes on installing this pod.

You can also refer to the question posted by Peter at stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41810758/could-not-build-module-nui-nuiparse-nuiparse-h-file-not-found
The docs saying: 

> FontName - A font name. See available values here. Can also be one of the following:
> system
> boldSystem
> italicSystem
> blackSystem
> heavySystem
> lightSystem
> mediumSystem
> semiboldSystem
> thinSystem
> ultraLightSystem

But, only some types are supported: 

```
[NUISettings.m, line 202]
+ (UIFont*)getFontWithClass:(NSString*)className baseFont:(UIFont *)baseFont
{
    NSString *propertyName;
    CGFloat fontSize;
    UIFont *font = nil;
...
    propertyName = @"font-name";
    
    if ([self hasProperty:propertyName withClass:className]) {
        NSString *fontName = [self get:propertyName withClass:className];
        
        if ([fontName isEqualToString:@"system"]) {
            font = [UIFont systemFontOfSize:fontSize];
        } else if ([fontName isEqualToString:@"boldSystem"]) {
            font = [UIFont boldSystemFontOfSize:fontSize];
        } else if ([fontName isEqualToString:@"italicSystem"]) {
            font = [UIFont italicSystemFontOfSize:fontSize];
        } else {
            font = [UIFont fontWithName:fontName size:fontSize];
        }
    } else {
        font = baseFont ? [baseFont fontWithSize:fontSize] : [UIFont systemFontOfSize:fontSize];
    }
    
    return font;
}
```

Moreover I think it would great to throw assert if some font is not found.
I can make the UIView to have a corner-radius, and it makes all the 4 corners rounded...

But how can I make only `top-left` and `top-right` corners to be rounded?

This is is the best that I´ve come up to:

using `corners: 1 1 0 0;`

And I don´t know why, it cuts the view leaving empty a lot of free space to the right...
Resolves "The master repo requires CocoaPods 1.0.0 - (currently using 0.39.0)" error.
When there is a shadow applied and also a corner radius,
NUIButtonRenderer should mask all sublayers except the internal
UILabel. Currently, `masksToBounds` is set to NO, which effectively
breaks the corner radius setting. See #266.
