Reduce function has two scenarios. It was not coming through in the docs. The formatting was updated for readability and to make sure these two scenarios came through easily to the reader
spacing
Hello, I'm a first-time user of clojure, and thought the [`reduce` core function docs](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/reduce) could use clarification regarding its callback function's arguments.

I just noticed this project does not accept pull requests via github, but I figured this PR would be a good way to communicate my intended contribution before learning how to contribute a patch via JIRA.
I think that 'this._first = _first; ' is better.
