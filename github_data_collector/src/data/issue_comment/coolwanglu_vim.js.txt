I'm not sure what the status of the project is, but if it's permanently unmaintained or abandoned please, please, please archive the repository on GitHub.

Hope all is well, you did a really bad ass job.
I tried to compiled the vim.js but got stuck at
```
checking for tgetent in -ltinfo... no
checking for tgetent in -lncurses... no
checking for tgetent in -ltermlib... no
checking for tgetent in -ltermcap... no
checking for tgetent in -lcurses... no
no terminal library found
checking for tgetent()... configure: error: NOT FOUND!
      You need to install a terminal library; for example ncurses.
      Or specify the name of the library with --with-tlib.

Havent changed anything in the `build.sh`. Any idea how to pass this `tgetent` thing?
Program crashes when typing `:e .` in normal mode. :cry:
Thanks for every distributor, bring so great app, 
Now, I expect a interesting using journey.
Thanks to everyone.

But why,  
vim is hot, web is hot, js is hot, node is hot, 
However, 
why does vim.js developing is so cold?
I am so puzzled with this, 
Would someone thinks  like what I thought?
Would someone discusses on this issue?

It is disabled by default.
Fix $ to end of line, HOME, END, CTRL+F (forward) and CTRL+B (backward) on Chrome. Also tested on Firefox and IE.
Consistently use -Oz optimization across all stages of compilation: configure, make and link.
Remove 'handled' if.
Add exported functions to emterpreted version.

Dependencies on Ubuntu are [emscripten dependencies](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/building_from_source/toolchain_what_is_needed.html) and for vim libncurses-dev, libxt-dev and cproto. PS: It can be a bit hard to track down what is missing because make proto will just omit definitions that require more headers rather than fail, so compile will fail later with the missing definitions. You can run e.g. 

``` bash
cd src
gcc -E -DPROTO -DFEAT_SMALL -DFEAT_GUI_WEB ui.c
```

on the file in question to check for error messages regarding headers.

While running configure, there is a problem that emcc calls clang instead of gcc and then doesn't pick up ncurses system library which makes the configure fail, so before configure do:

``` bash
cd $EM_DIR
mv emcc emcc.orig
ln -s emcc gcc
```

Then after configure finishes and before building:

``` bash
cd $EM_DIR
mv emcc emcc.link
mv emcc.orig emcc
```

There may be a better way to do this using an environment variable, but I didn't find it.

As seen in the screenshot - wherever the cursor goes, it leaves behind boxes around the characters.

This is on chromium 49.0.2623.112 (64-bit)
