Is there an easy way to get a scope of roots sorted by number of descendants? Thank you!
Switching to squish keeps log output on a single line.

Before:
```
Page Load (2.7ms)  SELECT "pages".* FROM "pages" INNER JOIN (
SELECT descendant_id, MAX(generations) as depth
FROM "page_hierarchies"
GROUP BY descendant_id

) AS generation_depth
ON "pages".id = generation_depth.descendant_id ORDER BY generation_depth.depth, position
```

After:
```
Page Load (1.9ms)  SELECT "pages".* FROM "pages" INNER JOIN ( SELECT descendant_id, MAX(generations) as depth FROM "page_hierarchies" GROUP BY descendant_id ) AS generation_depth ON "pages".id = generation_depth.descendant_id ORDER BY generation_depth.depth, position
```

in the auto generated migration for adding hierarchy table, we added timestamps. but on creating a new node, it is giving a

the library is not passing timestamps. How do we go about this?
Hello!

While testing how closure_tree is handling deep nesting for a project I noticed that at some point it started to issue an unreasonably large number of SQL queries. Looking at the `max_join_tables` (currently 50) I assumed that for 55 levels of nesting there will be something like 2 queries and not 50!

I tracked down the issue to the use of [in_groups](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Array.html#method-i-in_groups) which splits the path array in "(the given) number of groups" and replaced it with [in_groups_of](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Array.html#method-i-in_groups_of) which would rather split "in groups of (the given) size".

Check out the updated spec example SQL output:

Trying to integrate Closure Tree with Ruby Serverless application based on [Jets Framework](https://github.com/tongueroo/jets).

The issue is, the moment I put `has_closure_tree` method inside the model, it starts throwing weird errors. 

Error:
```
`connection_pool': ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished (ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished)
```

Traceback:

```

The error occurs when I run `jets console`. It disappears the moment I remove `has_closure_tree` method from my model. 

EDIT: `connection_pool.release_connection` inside `has_closure_tree` method is causing the issue with jets. 
Based on https://github.com/ClosureTree/closure_tree/pull/338

Adds ability to set `database_type` in `initializers/closure_tree_config.rb`:
```ruby
ClosureTree.configure do |config|
  config.database_type = :mysql
end
```

The type will be used across all the closure tree models in the application.<br>

This solves problems with numeric ordering and `db:create`.
```
delete FROM `fc_location_hierarchies` WHERE descendant_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT descendant_id FROM (SELECT descendant_id FROM `fc_location_hierarchies` WHERE ancestor_id = 46179 OR descendant_id = 46179) AS x);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.16 sec)
```
this query runs when updating the closure tree hierarchy.  It's taking a while on mysql (160ms), with no matching hierarchy rows to delete -- and less than 200k rows in the hierarchies table.

I made a mysql-specific query here: https://github.com/Crowd-Cow/closure_tree/commit/712de3f3ebf60abd7d171958ff2562c877d2e167#diff-693c6ab46fe400dd004a79a24ab8d56b
that speeds up the update of the hierarchy tree from 100ms to under 1ms.

Thoughts? Obviously, this would mean that we would have different SQL for different databases.. but the performance was bad enough on mysql that we had to fork. 

We're using msyql 5.7.
Hey

Sorry, I don't know how to go further here, i found uuid support in the changelog, but yet

I will appreciate every help very much
(or the variable is assigned nil and it's always false)

While the rails maintainers decide whether it's a good idea
https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/35059

I found this because out of curiosity I ran our test suite with
ApplicationRecord#present? raising in our projects
Reviving #320 under a different organization and on the latest version of master.

The call to release_connection, added in #263, might release a connection that was opened outside of has_closure_tree (if the caller is loaded dynamically in the middle of some other operation). This is especially problematic if the connection has an ongoing transaction, as that transaction will be lost.

This PR changes has_closure_tree to use with_connection instead, which only releases a connection if it was acquired. If a connection already existed prior to the call to has_closure_tree, it won't be released.

@seuros made a comment on the previous version of this PR about Databaseless setup, which I didn't understand. If someone could point me at a doc/readme/whatever I'll gladly add the necessary tests.
