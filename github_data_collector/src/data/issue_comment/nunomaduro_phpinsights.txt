I inititiated a support for slevomat/coding-standard 6.0. Many other dependencies needed to be updated as well.

localheinz/phpstan-rules is abandonned so I changed it to ergebnis/phpstan-rules (see [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/localheinz/phpstan-rules))
roave/no-floaters does not support phpstan/phpstan:^0.12 yet so I had to drop it (https://github.com/Roave/no-floaters/pull/18)

New rules make phpstan and insights fail. I did not want to take the responsibility to change the code yet as I don't know if some rules have to be ignored and which (in phpstan.neon.dist and phpinsights.php).

Feel free to tell me what to do next, I will be happy to continue on this.

This will add coloring to the File:line output, as we discuss in the related issue #336 I picked a combination of colors at based on the 'severity' of the categories.

Hey! I worked on autofix feature. It's not totally ready yet, but I wanted to create a PR to at least show you.

It add a `--fix` option to analyse command to apply check where it's possible during a complete analyze. 
I also add a `phpinsights fix` command to don't get full report, but only apply fixes.

@caneco do you have idea on how improve the output ?

It's look like this for now:

## TODO: 

- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add documentations
- [ ] DefinitionResolver for booting container and create configuration (TODO in the code)
- [ ] Launch fix on all project

I'm also wondering if we should create a **next** branch for aggregate developments on **v2.0** ? What do you think @nunomaduro @olivernybroe ?

I was using insights without setting an IDE (even if set, it doesn't work on Windows 10 anyway, I'm using cmder) and noticed that it would be nice to have the file:line clearly differentiated from rest of the line 

Default color from `formatFileLine`

Trying some variations.

If this is something desirable, I would like to send a PR to add it.

Also we should pick a color for it ðŸ˜…

Updating composer minimum version to 2.X dev branch.

Hello,

If I use insights on a class that has a method called `namespace()` the following error is thrown

```
Symfony\Component\Debug\Exception\FatalThrowableError  : Argument 1 passed to NunoMaduro\PhpInsights\Domain\Collector::addNamespace() must be of the type string, bool given, called in /Users/adi/code/enso/vendor/nunomaduro/phpinsights/src/Domain/Analyser.php on line 166
```

Thank you for this awesome package!

This fails:

```
<?php

namespace {
}
```

I think it's because you expect a name, e.g.

```
<?php

namespace foo {
}
```

Fix by replacing:
```
                    $namespace = $this->getNamespaceName($tokens, $i);
```
with:
```
                    $namespace = $this->getNamespaceName($tokens, $i);
                    if ($namespace !== false) {
                        $collector->addNamespace($namespace);
                    }
```

Hi,

PhpInsights current version requires `"composer/composer": "^1.7"`
Composer versions 1.7 to 1.9.1 (latest on v1 master) requires : 
```
"symfony/console": "^2.7 || ^3.0 || ^4.0",
"symfony/filesystem": "^2.7 || ^3.0 || ^4.0",
"symfony/finder": "^2.7 || ^3.0 || ^4.0",
"symfony/process": "^2.7 || ^3.0 || ^4.0"
```

This prevents SF 5 installation.

Composer version 2.x release now supports symfony v5 versions for all before mentioned package. I would therefor recommend support for `"composer/composer": "^2.0"`.

Will produce a PR accordingly if you are OK with the change
