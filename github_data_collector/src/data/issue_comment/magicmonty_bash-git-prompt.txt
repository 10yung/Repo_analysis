I am not entirely sure what might be going on here.
I have a server set up with ssh access and I have a key for it in ~/.ssh. I did have to add a host entry in ~/.ssh/config so maybe that setting is ignored but either way I keep getting password prompts from bash-git-prompt in the middle of my prompts.

I would be happy to help debugging if you have any specific questions.
I am using bash-git-prompt: stable 2.7.1 and it is slow, but only when i open directory with git repository in it. The lag is around 2 seconds after any command, for example 'ls'. How to debug what causes this lag? Not every repository affected, but some does.
Private index was tried to create in non-existent location, no error
was ever displayed, and then unconditionally GIT_INDEX_FILE variable
was set pointing to non-existent path. Git used this location and
reported many changed files.

Additionally in case of non-existent index file most of
files were marked with `D` in second loop pass of `gitstatus.sh`
which was wrongly identified as 'Stashed'.

It is common on Android devices - there is no /tmp directory
Termux creates one and sets `TMPDIR` variable, which is commonly
honoured by most of unix utilities.
If any script saved in PROMPT_COMMAND wants to know last command exit status (without using GIT_PROMPT_LAST_COMMAND_STATE, but based on "$?" shell variable) after installing bash-git-prompt it stopped working, because "$?" variable was set to success after assigning GIT_PROMPT_LAST_COMMAND_STATE variable.

This PR fixes it.

Reopening again PR #457 under new name, as need `master` branch in my forked repository :-)
Additional fix when ${GIT_PROMPT_PREFIX} or ${GIT_PROMPT_SUFFIX}
contain color sequences git_prompt_help's formatting was wrong
Add ability to place virtual environment infos between prompt and git status (instead of left to the prompt).
I've done a fresh Mac installed and enabled bash-git-prompt as I've done many times before; however it is not detecting a Git folder ie. no change in prompt. I've checked my .bash_profile many times to no avail. If I re-run gitprompt.sh in the terminal it magically starts working so it's something that's going on in my .bash_profile but I don't see what (in fact the .bash_profile is copied from another machine that is working). 

I'm guessing Bash versions, or Git version (I'm on the latest of both) - what else can I do to debug this? I can see gitprompt.sh is called and loads up, it's just not detecting the Git folder (I've tried multiple folders too)

I had to add `export` in front of https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt/blob/master/gitprompt.sh#L492 in order for it to work.

Presumably, other variables in that stack should also be exported as well, but I didn't test those.

This is on MacOS 10.14.6.
I want to remove the branch name from the prompt.

I am using iTerm status bar to display the branch name and I'd like to remove it from the prompt. Is there a way to do this?
