How can I deal with it?
Hi,
In /pysot/pysot/models/model_builder.py line 112, the mask_loss is always equal to None and the output of "total loss" will be int * NoneType value, it will have a error:

```
outputs['total_loss'] += cfg.TRAIN.MASK_WEIGHT * mask_loss
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'int' and 'NoneType'
```

Can these trackers be used to do inference (not evaluation as I don't have the labels) on a new dataset?

The README.md states: "If you want to test tracker on new dataset, please refer to pysot-toolkit to setting testing_dataset." But pysot-toolkit seems to be for evaluation on a new tracker, not a new dataset... Isn't that right? Or have I misunderstood?

Thanks!
Which layer should I train in backbone net？
In pysot/core/config，only resnet50 backbone train layer provided. For Mobilenetv2, which layer should I train? Thank you.
原码        dist_model = DistModule(model)在model = ModelBuilder().cuda().train()后面，现在为什么改为10几句后面才出现呢？OTB100的结果为什么只有没fineturn附件的结果0.673？我fineturn了的。

I am only using coco 2014 datasets for training. I have done crop and generate data info ( train2014.json , val2014json, val.json, train.json ) but I got this error if it image path problem where to fix it, I checked dataset.py as well.

These datasets are inside /pysot/training_dataset/coco:  (which has crop511, train2014 and val2014 folder of images) 
Hello, 
can you provide Baidu pan links to the pre-trained backbone network?

When i first run eval.py just like the Quick Start said:
>>python ../../tools/eval.py 	 \
	--tracker_path ./results \ # result path
	--dataset VOT2016        \ # dataset name
	--num 1 		 \ # number thread to eval
	--tracker_prefix 'model'   # tracker_name
(ps: the argument should be model not 'model', there is no ' ')

i got an error:

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Finally, i found the cause of this bug. 
  trackers = [x.split('/')[-1] for x in trackers] in File "../../tools/eval.py", line 37, in main()
This code split tracker name incorrectly. the return value is 'results\\VOT2016\\model' while correct value should be 'model'.

Conclusion: 
This code should change "x.split('/')" to "x.split('\\')" when you use Windows. Besides, i've not met any other bug caused by this, but i'm not sure that whether the other place uses x.split('/') may lead to bug or not.
I train the model with 4 GPU and find that the speed is very slow (about 1.8s/iter), so I want to know whether there is any problem? How long does it require to train on all 4 datasets?
