I'm seeing this weird issue where formatting is not working. Here is the link to the codesandbox example: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-text-mask-bug-5hrjn

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the link and click on the button, below the input.
2. Input is filled with a value, but is not formatted.

And the weird thing is if I first manually input some value and then click on the button, everything works. I don't know if I'm doing anything wrong.

PS: Thanks a lot for this library! ❤️ 
I'm using React Hooks `react: ^ 16.12.0` ... I need to get the length of the enter value and compare it with the mask size. when both are equal, the seek button is activated.

I tried to use props `pipe`, but it issues` useState` overrun error (I found it very strange);

Then I tried, using props `ref`, not getting the result I would like. In addition to having more code;

So I came to use `onChange`, for example:

```typescript
...
const mask:any[] = '[/\d/,/\d/,/\d/,/\d/,/\d/,'-',/\d/,/\d/,/\d/]';
 const maskCount:number =  mask.length;

const [disabled, setDisabled] = useState<boolean>(true);
const verify = (e:React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
        const {value} = e.target;
        setDisabled(value.length !== maskCount);
    }

return (
<>
  <MaskedInput
                    mask={mask}
                    guide={false}
                    placeholder='02145-874'
                    onChange={verify}
                />
  <button type = 'button' disabled = {disabled}> Search </button>
</>
);
...
```

but there is a bug, in this example, passing the `-` character cannot be deleted. Example:

```
  Entry: '05143320'
 Exit: '05143-320'
when trying to delete the sequence stops at '05143-' infinitely.
```


This happens when there is `setDisabled` in the` verify` function. Removing it returns to normal.


I did the same text in another library, like: **[react-input-mask](https://github.com/sanniassin/react-input-mask)** and there is no such problem.
Can anyone help me get the original input value before applying the mask?
I use the component on multiple form (Vuejs) and want to have a global config not to repeat it every time, but can't find a way in the doc. On other Vuejs Component I've already did it with `extends` like bellow, but here it's not working : 
```
<script lang="ts">
    import MaskedInput from 'vue-text-mask';
    import { Vue, Component, Prop } from "vue-property-decorator";


    @Component({
        extends: MaskedInput,
    })
    export default class AppInputmasked extends Vue {

        @Prop({default: true}) guide!: boolean;
        @Prop({default: true}) keepCharPositions!: boolean;
        @Prop({default: false}) showMask!: boolean;
        @Prop({default: '-'}) placeholderChar!: string;

    }
</script>
```
Any idea to set global default configuration ?
When deleting the entire value of a field at once, e.g. `cmd+backspace`, onChange is not called. This is most likely due to `value` being an empty string, so when the text is deleted the new value is also an empty string, resulting in not raising a change event. 

Changing `defaultValue` to `value` worked for me, but it fails the unit tests. This is just meant as a way to illustrate the problem and hint at a solution. I would appreciate if someone could look into this. 

Addresses issue #992
When the entire value is deleted at once, e.g. with `cmd + backspace` or selecting the value and hitting backspace, onChange is not called. 
Can I receive unmasked values using with any form libs ?
Can I revive unmasked values using with any form libs ?
As of today, with Angular 8, if you enable ivy in `tsconfig.app.json` the application will not build. There is such an error.

```
ERROR in There is no format with import statements in 'D:/gits/nereus-safety-portal/node_modules/angular2-text-mask' entry-point.
```

With Angular 9, the Ivy will be the default rendering engine, thus the text-mask will not work with it.
when entering in decimals with the create number mask can't enter in 3 then 0 then 4 expected 0.304.
