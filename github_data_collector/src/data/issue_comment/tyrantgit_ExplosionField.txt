After the item in the recyclerview is deleted, the position of the item is shifted due to the jitter of the deleted animation.
I am trying to use this with a library which I being developer by me. But the explosion is not working file. Only the Button is disappearing.

I have tried copying the Java classes directly but the idea was of no use.

Will this library work within another library? If not is there any way I can make it work? Also is there any other library or resource available which can help me achieve this beautiful explosion effect?

Any help will be really appreciated.
if the explosionfield is attached to callingActivity and if I try to explode a view on alertdialog, it crashes.

  public static ExplosionField attach2Window(Activity activity) {
        ViewGroup rootView = (ViewGroup) activity.findViewById(Window.ID_ANDROID_CONTENT);
        ExplosionField explosionField = new ExplosionField(activity);
        rootView.addView(explosionField, new ViewGroup.LayoutParams(
                ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT));
        return explosionField;
    }

    public static ExplosionField attach2WindowViewGroup(ViewGroup viewGroup,Context context) {
        ExplosionField explosionField = new ExplosionField(context);
        viewGroup.addView(explosionField, new ViewGroup.LayoutParams(
                ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT));
        return explosionField;
    }
I want to show the clicked image after some time,can you please guide me.
ExplosionField  Always on top
Error is in below line.

  ```
mExplosionField = ExplosionField.attach2Window(this);
        addListener(findViewById(R.id.root));
```
Added a simple listener to trigger the event when the ExplosionField animation is finished.

You'r missing the most important:animation listener,which shall be there as the explode() argument so i will know when the animation has ended and do basics about it,plus the clear() method does not work at all,i reckon it is because i have no clue when the animation is going to end,so the clear just invalidates itself without getting and clearing the animation at all,please take a look at the code
