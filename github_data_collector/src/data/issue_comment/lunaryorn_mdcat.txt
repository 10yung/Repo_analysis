Running this on Debian Linux (Debian 10, aka "Buster")
iTerm2 and Terminal.app don't support strikethrough text; we should have a good fallback.

Currently the text just renders like normal text which isn't so good probably.

Follow up from #71.
Would be nice to support system pager and redirect stdout to it. Probably by default it is nice to handle big output via that pager, if specified and works.

It should probably look like `Command::new(env::var("PAGER")?).stdin(Stdio::piped()).spawn()`
Any way to change the color output? By default, my html comments are green, which for longer comments makes them quite hard to read in my theme (which might be partly due to my theme being at fault; nonetheless, being able to change it from green could improve readability under some circumstances)

Themes would be a more general solution, but an option that allows for more fine-grained control of colors could also be handy. 

As a slight bonus, it would be neat if themeing would allow you to se text properties (e.g. disabling bold headers, making comments italic but the same color as regular text, etc). 
Use `textwrap`, perhaps, to wrap all content to the column size of the TTY.

Will perhaps be tricky with termion formatting characters.

Need a good library to render tables to TTY?
