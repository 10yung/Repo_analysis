**Overview of change:**

Merge request of target branch for pixel perfect rendering.
**Lightweight Charts Version:** <!-- 1.0.0 -->
1.2.1

Note: I saw this issue when updating from 1.1.0 to 1.2.1. I have reverted back to 1.1.0 to verify and could confirm it does not happen. I think that it's a possible bug introduced in 1.2.1.

**Steps/code to reproduce:**
**Context**: I have a button that lets the user switch timeframe for a given market. 

Programmatically, the only thing I do is to call the `candlestickSeries.setData(selectedTimeframeData)`.

The issue happens after I set the data.

**Actual behavior:**
The chart looks fine when I set the data for the first time:

### First set of data for candlestick series

### After setting new data in the serie (another timeframe)
I can scroll the chart horizontally and I have wrong candles painted in the "future".

You can see on the half right of the chart, all these "weird candles" that should not be there.
Note that also there is no date / time on the time axis for these.

**Expected behavior:**

These unexpected candles, on the right, should not be there.

**Lightweight Charts Version:** 1.2.1
**Steps/code to reproduce:**

```javascript
// scroll to the left of the first historical bar
const range = chart.timeScale().getVisibleRange();
```

**Actual behavior:**

Key `from` of variable `range` contains timestamp of the first historical bar.

**Expected behavior:**

Key `from` of variable `range` contains timestamp before timestamp of the first historical bar.
Hi,
I would like to render the lightweight chart as an image that could be used in a modal or a hovering object on top of the web-page. I tried to search the documentation and forums for it and it seems it is not supported by default. Any recommendations on how this type of action could be achieved? 
There is a good example of it at www.finviz.com site. When you move your mouse on top of the instrument/symbol link it opens a chart.

Thanks.

**Overview of change:**

Implemented whitespaces support

```js
mainSeries.setData([
    { time: "2018-12-21", open: 108.19, high: 118.43, low: 74.22, close: 75.16 },
    { time: "2018-12-22" }, // whitespace
    { time: "2018-12-23", open: 45.12, high: 53.90, low: 45.12, close: 48.09 },
]);
```
I'm interested in implementing candlestick enhanced customization:

**1.** Rounded candlestick body.
**2.** ctx.lineCap = 'round' candlestick shadow.

Attaching image from my svg-chart project:
