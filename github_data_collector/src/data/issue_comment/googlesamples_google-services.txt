Hi,

I have added google login button to my website and after the success authentication I can retrive user profile but when I reload the page (press F5) I lose the authenticated user profile. How can I retrieve the authenticated user profile? I have added a cookie to maintain the session but I cant get the user profile by google-signin library.

These are my use cases:

A) Without reload the page -> **Working**
- Open the website
- Sign in with google account
- Browse in the website
- Logout from the website.

B) Reloading the page -> **Issue**
- Open the website
- Sign in with google account
- Browse in the website
- Reload the website.
- Logout from the website. (Issue because I lost the authenticated user after the reload and it shows an issue in the next code)

```
const auth2 = gapi.auth2.getAuthInstance()
await auth2.signOut())

```
Thanks in advance.

  * OS version: iOS 13.3
  * SDK version: 5.0.2

#### Steps to reproduce:

  1. Create a Google SignIn button and display it
  2. Rotate the device
  
#### Observed Results:

  * As you can see in the images, the text of the button doesn't fit itself well to the new button's size (more correct to say that it does fits itself when it should remain as is in bother orientations):

Portrait to Landscape:

*Notice that after "hovering" (holding the button and release it outside of the button's bounds) fixing the issue, so you may just run the same process you run when "hovering" the button on screen rotation.
  
#### Expected Results:

  * The text shouldnâ€™t smear or shrink like it does.
  * Device: iPhone X
  * OS version: iOS 13.3
  * SDK version: 5.0.2

#### Steps to reproduce:

  1. Create a Google SignIn button among with another buttons (to see the difference)
  
#### Observed Results:

  * As you can see in the image, the button's height is smaller than the rest of the buttons, what also makes the G logo to be non-centered and not aligned to the SignIn text.

#### Expected Results:

  * The button should fit it's container and align the G logo in the center of the button (vertically).
  
#### Relevant Code:

I'm getting some warning about auto generated height in the console:
```
[LayoutConstraints] Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.
	Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. 
	Try this: 
		(1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; 
		(2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. 
(
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x28030b7a0 FBSDKLoginButton:0x153d21030'\U05d4\U05ea\U05d7\U05d1\U05e8'.height == 28   (active)>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x280376e90 'buttonHeight - auto generated by GIDSignInButton' GIDSignInButton.height == 48   (active, names: GIDSignInButton:0x151f5b400 )>",

)

Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint 
<NSLayoutConstraint:0x280376e90 'buttonHeight - auto generated by GIDSignInButton' GIDSignInButton.height == 48   (active, names: GIDSignInButton:0x151f5b400 )>
```

### Step 1: Are you in the right place?
I arrived here by clicking the GitHub link at the bottom of this page:
https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in

I'm here because I couldn't find a way to submit feedback with words over there.

The directions under the heading `Specify your app's client ID` has been wrong for at least a year, as described by this Stack Overflow answer:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/52544268/996314
### Step 1: Are you in the right place?

  * For issues or feature requests related to the code **in this repository** file a Github issue.
  * For general technical questions, post a question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) tagged appropriately.

### Step 2: Describe your environment

  * Device: Samsung Galaxy S9
  * OS version: Android 9
  * [Android] Google Play Services version: 19.6.29
  
### Step 3: Describe the problem:
When font size is set to maximum on device, no scrollbar visible on google sign-in pop-up dialog.
(See below screenshot)

#### Steps to reproduce:

  1.  Set font-size to maximum on device.
  2.  Make sure device has logged in google accounts.
  3.  Open app supporting google sign-in.
  4.  Attempt sign-in with google.
  5.  Rotate the device to landscape.
  6.  Observe no indication of scrollbar. (as shown in image above)
  
  
#### Observed Results:

  * No scrollbar visible even though we have more content.
  
#### Expected Results:

  * Scrollbar should be visible indicating there is more content to be seen in the pop-up.
 

### Step 1: Are you in the right place?

  * For issues or feature requests related to the code **in this repository** file a Github issue.

### Step 2: Describe your environment

  * Device: iPhone devices
  * OS version: ios 10, ios 11, ios 12, ios 13
  * SDK version: Using the libGoogleAnalyticsServices.a file to analytics
  
### Step 3: Describe the problem:

We are getting crash logs in Fabric related to Google Analytics. Most of them occur when the user is in background. We have a theory regarding these. We believe they might be occurring as Google Analytics tries to access its sqlite file for data using a backgroundTask. But when the device is locked, it is unsuccessful to get the data as we were using NSFileProtectionComplete, and hence it crashes. This is our assumption and we would like to know if anything similar has been observed with other projects. We have changed our protection level to NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication, but are still getting the crashes. We came across a link in the Apple developer forum stating that changing the Data Protection in the entitlements file might not always update it for all files and proper update happens when we programmatically change the protection level for all files. Here's the link: https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/55933

Again this is just our assumption and we would want to know if anything similar has been seen, so that we are sure on how to resolve this issue.

#### Steps to reproduce:

We haven't been able to reproduce these. But we are getting a good number of crashes on Fabric. Possible scenario. Use the app version where Data protection was NSFileProtectionComplete. Then, update to a version where Data protection is NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication. Then use the app for sometime (for events to generate). Then close the app and immediately lock the device.
  
#### Observed Results:

  * What happened?  This could be a description, log output, etc.

As mentioned, we are getting a good number of crash logs on Fabric
  
#### Expected Results:

  * What did you expect to happen?

Expected the app to not crash

  * SDK version: 5.0.1
  * Xcode. : 10.3
# Step 2: Describe your environment

  * Device: windows 10
  
### Step 3: Describe the problem:
in the form of 
    Authorized JavaScript origins 
please note it can't use 127.0.0.1:<port>
and if someone tries to put it don't accept it, please!

and note when they are using their web app development setup the URL can NOT be 127.0.0.1:<port>
it must be localhost:<port>

please take of this in the doc and in the form validations! it wastes many developers times hairs.
I'm getting bold!


### Step 1: Are you in the right place?

  * For issues or feature requests related to the code **in this repository** file a Github issue.

### Step 2: Describe your environment

  * Device: iPhone
  * OS version: iOS13
  * SDK version:Xcode11
  
### Step 3: Describe the problem:
In iOS13, the default behavior of present a view controller is changed. It's better to add a property like `modalPresentationStyle` so that we can choose to full screen style.


  


**Describe your environment**

  * Device: multiple android devices
  * OS version: Android 8 and 9 both can reproduce
  * SDK version: targetSdkVersion = 28
  * [Android] Google Play Services version: com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:17.0.0
  
**Describe the problem:**

#### Steps to reproduce:

  1. Obtain a Google account with mulitple youtube channel (personal and brand channel)
  2. Using Google auth SDK to login with that Google account to authenticate with Youtube account
  3. Expecting one more step to prompt me to select the intended Youtube channel, the behavior is correct on web interface, but not on Android via SDK
  4. Current Behavior: The select youtube step is skipped. The user is arbitrarily bound to one account
  
#### Observed Results:

  * Did not bind with the Youtube account that the user want
  
#### Expected Results:

  * Expect the SDK to prompt the user to select one of the Youtube account from that Google account
