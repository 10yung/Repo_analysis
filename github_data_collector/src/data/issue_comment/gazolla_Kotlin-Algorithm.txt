My PR adds Breadth-First Search and Max Heap Sort.
- add Breadth-First Search code, Heap code
- add description
- add README
```
fun <T:Comparable<T>>shuffle(items:MutableList<T>):List<T>{
    val rg : Random = Random()
    for (i in 0..items.size - 1) {
        val randomPosition = rg.nextInt(items.size)
        val tmp : T = items[i]
        items[i] = items[randomPosition]
        items[randomPosition] = tmp
    }
    return items
}
```

This algorithm doesn't shuffle it correctly, not every permutation is equiprobable. You have to do:

```
val randomPosition = rg.nextInt(i + 1)
```

to fix it.

I just googled for a Kotlin Stack class and found this library...

i'd like to open this up for discussion:

things that are currently undefined:

no POM -- was there ever any  intent or success with: 
```git submodule add https://github.com/<User>/Kotlin-Algorithm.git```
?

no packages declared in the kotlin source -- curious things happen with root package in jvm 

no README declaration of whether this lib attempts pure java or js stdlib -- inconsistent due to:

junit imports in the same hierarchy as the source code -- tests are nice... but this lib is inconsistent.


i'd like to use the simple Stack class and go back to playing with my own project... but my inclination is to suggest one of the active maintainers provide one or more or pom, gradle, and raw git submodule imports, with package hierarchy chosen ... *git submodule add "Kotlin-Algorithm"* into src/main/kotlin does not imply a pleasant packagename, but there's no reason it could not be robust as a git submodule.

for now i'm fine cutting and pasting these gems, but had to scratch my head a minute to figure out what is going on, an unexpected cost.
