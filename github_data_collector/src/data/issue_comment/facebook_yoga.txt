# Issues and Steps to Reproduce

On iOS, we use flexlayout by `YGLayout` . If  I want to align items by `baseline`, I found it didn't work. After searching the code of `Yoga`, I found that I should provide `baselineFunc`.
But there isn't any method for me to set `baselinefunc`, I can't get the node of view either.

# Expected Behavior

Providing a method to set `baselineFunc`.

# Link to Code
https://github.com/facebook/yoga/blob/master/YogaKit/Source/YGLayout.h

When building and using C # libraries,
EntryPointNotFoundException thrown from YGInteropSetLogger.

so, I added YOGA_EXPORT on YGInteropSetLogger.
This is about the C-API.

I set a measure function with YGNodeSetMeasureFunc() and can assess that the node has a measure function later when the node is drawn, which is called after a layout was calculated. And the node is drawn.

However, during layout, the measure function is not called.

Are there are cases when this could be the case? I use YGNodeMarkDirty() in thought, that this will trigger a new measure round.

Code is hard to strip down at the moment...

# Issues and Steps to Reproduce
I use YogaLayout to add a TextView as a child:
```
YogaLayout yogaLayout = new YogaLayout(this);
yogaLayout.getYogaNode().setFlexDirection(YogaFlexDirection.ROW);
rootLayout.addView(yogaLayout);
TextView textView = new TextView(this);
textView .setText("test");
yogaLayout.addView(textView1, -1, new YogaLayout.LayoutParams(ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT,
                ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT));
```
after 5s,I modify the textSize of the textview,the text became larger,but the layout of YogaLayout and TextView don't change~.
```
new Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                textView.setTextSize(30);
            }
        }, 5000);
```
i try to use these codes after change textSize ,but not work:
```
yogaLayout.invalidate(textView);
yogaLayout.requestLayout();
```
so,how to change the layout after i change child's LayoutParams in YogaLayout?

# Issues and Steps to Reproduce

This project does not support the justify items and justify self properties [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-items). All browsers since IE11 support this

I think the logic is pretty much the same as align items, so it might be possible to repurpose that code

# Problem

- YogaKit crash when applying layout to a view whose child subview do not have yoga enabled.
```CALayer position contains NaN: [nan nan].```

# Solution

- Check if yoga is enabled in the view when applying layout.

# Testing plan

Create a container view with yoga enabled
Add to the container a subview to the view with yoga enabled
Add to the container a subview to the view without yoga enabled
Call ```applyLayoutPreservingOrigin``` on the container view.

Code:
```objc
UIView *container = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 50, 75)];
container.yoga.isEnabled = YES;

UIView *view = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero];
view.yoga.isEnabled = YES;
view.yoga.flexBasis = YGPointValue(0);
view.yoga.flexGrow = 1;
[container addSubview:view];

UIView *view2 = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 20, 30, 40)];
[container addSubview:view2];

[container.yoga applyLayoutPreservingOrigin:YES];
```

Error:
```
caught "CALayerInvalidGeometry", "CALayer position contains NaN: [nan nan]. Layer: <CALayer:0x7fdd6055c070; position = CGPoint (25 40); bounds = CGRect (0 0; 30 40); delegate = <UIView: 0x7fdd6055dc40; frame = (10 20; 30 40); layer = <CALayer: 0x7fdd6055c070>>; opaque = YES; allowsGroupOpacity = YES; >"
