There is an error when running under tmux 3.0a as follows:
`.tmux.conf:100: syntax error`

Could you look into it?
remove mac ox
remove submodule
use tpm to manage plug in


I think that this should resolve https://github.com/tony/tmux-config/issues/35.
And other small fixes:
- unify all home-dir instances;
- return back to the directory where install.sh was called from;
