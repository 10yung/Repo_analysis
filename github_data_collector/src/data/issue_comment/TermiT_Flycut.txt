I installed Flycut on macOS Mojave and clicked on "deny" for some initial permissions. Now I can't use it even after reinstalling another version. Please help. thanks
It would be good from a security standpoint to enable the user to list specific applications from which they do not want Flycut to copy text.  The most urgent use case is with password apps.  The one I use, OneSafe, copies all text to the clipboard as NSStringPboardType, which I believe indicates simple standard text.  For that reason, if I include this clipboard type in the "Don't copy from password files > Pasteboard types", it would block all text.  I would assume OneSafe is not coded correctly to indicate a Password PboardType, but there may be other password applications that have the same flaw.  I would love to move all my passwords to another password app, but who has time to mess with that :-)

I would love to be able to tell Flycut to ignore all text from OneSafe.  

Thank you!
FlyCut was working fine on older macOS versions. Right now I'm not able to paste from the Clip History. It was working fine in Catalina Beta versions as well, something seems to be broken by Catalina. I'm using the latest Flycut version, keenly awaiting fix for the issue.
At the moment, when I press the hotkeys, the bezel appears with one clipboard item in it, and it works like a paging system, having to press the hotkey again to get the next item. Would it be possible to have an option where pressing the hotkey shows a list of all the clipboard items, with the most recent highlighted, and then continuing to press the hotkey selects the next item?

I find that when I'm doing a lot of copying and pasting, being able to see the whole list makes things much quicker.

Cheers,
I'd like to request to make Clear All confirmation optional and configurable via the control panel.
am ready to finally upgrade Mac OS to 10.14 Mojave, but am first wanting to know if Flycut 1.8.2 is compatible or not. 

i've been using Flycut for years and IMHO it's quite simply the best clipboard app. i'd like to not loose it if possible.

is this still being developed/maintained? if not, can somebody suggest an alternative that works similarly, by having clipboard items viewable/useable/pasteable via the menubar?
thanks.
Even though I don't have 'Launch Flycut on login' ticked:

my computer launches FlyCut on login. I've noticed in System Preferences > Users & Groups, that FlyCut is here:

Any ideas why?
Would anyone recommend an alternative keyboard hotkey for FlyCut?
I'm just wondering whether this nice utility might be lowering the guards on security and what could be done about it.

It is common practice to copy and paste passwords. Thus having a history of clipboards certainly raises an issue here.

How secure is the default macOS clipboard?

Does Flycut use the same mechanism?

Might add an option to enable Secure Keyboard Input? Or add extra functionality for password type clipboards?

When typing, it would be very convenient to see Flycut in the "right-click" list of options, with the content/option list.  Not sure if I'm explaining that well, please see the attached mockup example.
