This is a great (and underrated) package and I stumbled onto it pretty much by accident. I use gt quite a bit and it could benefit by some integration with this package. Are there plans to provide examples and/or expanded support for fontawesome in gt?

Right now if I leave the color blank `fa("robot", fill=NULL)` then the color ends up being #000000. I would really like it to be the color of whatever element it's contained in (like if it's in the middle of an h1 block then have it take the same color as that text). It doesn't seem like there is a way to do this--can that functionality be added?
Great package, works well with html_output. I might be doing something wrong, but I don't think it works with other types of output? Perhaps good to specify this or extend usage (right now the README gives the impression that the package works for all types of output generated in R Markdown). 
@rich-iannone I just found this repo as I was searching for the best way to include fontawesome icons in rmarkdown docs. One option I found [here](https://github.com/ropensci/ozunconf17/issues/31) is shown below. The `fontawesome` package looks very interesting as well. Could you perhaps comment on if/when the `fontawsome` package will be on CRAN?

    ```{r setup, include = FALSE}
    htmltools::tagList(rmarkdown::html_dependency_font_awesome())
    ```
