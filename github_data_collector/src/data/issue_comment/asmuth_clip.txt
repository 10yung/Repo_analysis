Building with `make -j` as recommended in the docs is generally inadvisable. It steals all the threads it can and will cause crashes on some systems. It would be better to run `make -j $(($(nproc)/2))` for linux or `$(($(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)/2))` for mac if you want to speed up your build time by multithreading.
