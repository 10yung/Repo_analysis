I am curious to see whether there is a way to give individual observations different weights in the UMAP objective function. For instance, I have data from 2 conditions, one with 100 observations and one with 1000.  I would like to have both conditions contribute equally to the embedding. Perhaps naively, I would expect observations from each conditions to take up the same amount of real estate in this balanced analysis. I appreciate any thoughts on how feasible this would be. Thanks in advance! 
Dear all,

I can't get umap to run twice in an R-session without crashing. Initially observed using RunUMAP from Seurat 3.1.1, but also the very basic code (see below) would not work..
I have tried to resolve this using the hints in https://github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/monocle3/issues/186 and https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues/2256, but without any succes..

Any suggestions?

Session and info:

library(uwot)
iris_umap <- umap(iris, pca = 50)

\# And a second time
iris_umap2 <- umap(iris, pca = 50)

Hi,
Thanks for your invaluable work proposing umap in a native R package. Thanks also for the smallvis package.
As you already integrated largeVis and proposed tumap, I am wondering if you planned to integrate HSNE someday. [HDI](https://github.com/Nicola17/High-Dimensional-Inspector) is already integrated in interactive exploration tools such as [cytosplore](https://www.cytosplore.org/), but no R package is available. If you plan it, let me know.
Best.
@sirusb, @ttriche: as contributors of PRs to this package, would you like to be acknowledged as such in the `Authors@R` field of the `DESCRIPTION`? You don't need to provide an email address, just a suitable identifier, e.g. first name and last name. For reference, the field currently looks like:

```R
    c(person("James", "Melville", email = "jlmelville@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre")),
    person("Aaron", "Lun", role="ctb"))
```
Any plan to add a way to perform an inverse transform (from embedding to data space)? 

Thanks for the great work!
Hi,
If i run umap_trasform after tumap I get the following error

16:25:52 Writing NN index file to temp file /tmp/RtmpAAapHI/file3b610733a05

Error in .External(list(name = "CppMethod__invoke_void", address = <pointer: (nil)>,  : 
  NULL value passed as symbol address 

while instead everything works if I use umap and then umap_trasform. Of course using the same data  for both methods.

Things I should fix, but which may need a major version change. To be edited and updated as I discover more hidden horrors.

* `min_dist` default is `0.01`, but should be `0.1` for consistency with Python UMAP. Fortunately, this has no discernible effect on the output.
* should `pca` be set by default? If users attempt to throw very high dimensional data at `uwot` at the moment, they are in for a miserable time, because at best Annoy will take hours to complete. At worst, if they are using multi-threading (also a default), Annoy will fail on large datasets due to not being able to read back in an index larger in size than 2GB. I must get back to [rnndescent](https://github.com/jlmelville/rnndescent) and add rp tree support to provide a replacement/alternative.
Hi,

Maybe this is a "no issue".
I´m trying FNN as method for kNN search and need ret_model = TRUE to do metric learning, but I get a error:

Error in x2nn(X, n_neighbors, metric, nn_method, n_trees, search_k, n_refine_iters,  : 
  nn_method = 'FNN' is incompatible with ret_model = TRUE

Do you think there could be a workaround?

Thanks.

Hi,

This R implementation is very useful for me since I only know R. Thank you for making this package.

So I was trying to run a series of UMAP analysis with different parameters. I saved them with `saveRDS()` for later use, especially for `umap_transform()` function for my testing data set. However, when I retrieve it with `readRDS()` I couldn't use the object as the model for `umap_transform()`. The error message reads:
```
Error in .External(list(name = "CppMethod__invoke_void", address = <pointer: (nil)>,  : 
  NULL value passed as symbol address
```
I work on RStudio Server. Not sure if the information helps to solve the problem.

Thanks a lot for making this package again.
