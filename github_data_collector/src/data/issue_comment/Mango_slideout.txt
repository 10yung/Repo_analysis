Hello guys, any with a "right" jsfiddle working demo?
https://jsfiddle.net/zarza/xfqcev4b/2/

We tried changing to 'side': 'right' but looks like it does not take effect.
I bound toggle to ctrl+space in my app, and if I push it repeatedly, the open-close effect seems to break / stop trying to open or close.
Its posible make this? Slide behind window popup or panel...

Currently the menu opens if one swipes from left far upwards. This should not happen since touch from down to up or the other way around is scrolling other content.

The menu should only be opened if one moves it from left to right or closing from right to left.

This pr implements this fix with an allowed range of 25px up/down. (May be changed to be configurable but 25px should be a fine default value.)
Hello everyone, 

I'm having an error when i use the slideOut. Much i slide, much i have the issue...

Here's the text of the issue in console chrome :  
Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener due to target being treated as passive

To reproduce the issue : when you toggle mobile device in devtool chrome and you slide, it appears. 

my chrome version is : Version 75.0.3770.80 (Build officiel) (64 bits)

Thanks for reading ;-)
main callout is the absence of `.slideout-menu-left` and `.slideout-menu-right` selectors that break the `side: right` option.

Probably just needs a version bump and a publish to npm

Is this project still being maintained? 
Not sure if this is by design or a bug in the library. If this is a bug please consider this PR.

Setting 0 values on initialization for padding, tolerance, or duration is not possible
with the current implementation since 0 values will become their default values. 

For example, padding set to 0 will become 256. 
If using the library so it would behave as an overlay menu, having a possibility to set 0 padding is important.

This PR will add the possibility to set 0 values for padding, tolerance, and duration.

For more info, there's an issue for this: https://github.com/Mango/slideout/issues/266
I'm using <iframe> tag in my html but if i swipe the iframe content this sildeout is not working.
