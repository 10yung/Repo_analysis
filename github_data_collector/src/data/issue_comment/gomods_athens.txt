The [config docs](https://docs.gomods.io/configuration/authentication/) for authenticating to private repos don't talk about [`ATHENS_GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://github.com/gomods/athens/blob/15733395eb9d7bf1e156e0e702173d8cb1198f67/config.dev.toml#L173), but they should!
**What is the problem I am trying to address?**

Adds documentation on Athens' docker images

**How is the fix applied?**

Added documentation on Athens' docker images, moves some documentation from the walkthrough to the new page.

**Mention the issue number it fixes or add the details of the changes if it doesn't have a specific issue.**

Fixes #1526 


On every commit, we push a new image to docker hub. This means that people can lock their Athens deployment to a commit sha without worrying about it changing from under their feet (i.e. Canary builds) as well as without having to wait for our official releases. 

The dev releases are kept in a separate docker hub repository here: https://hub.docker.com/r/gomods/athens-dev/tags

However, this is not mentioned anywhere, and it would be great to include in our docs, maybe a new section called "Docker" under Install Athens, or just on the home page. 

**What is the problem I am trying to address?**

Currently the helm chart does not allow you to specify annotations to be applied to the Athens pod.

**How is the fix applied?**

`annotations` field added to values.yaml which is utilised by the Deployment to add extra annotations to the Athens pod.

**Mention the issue number it fixes or add the details of the changes if it doesn't have a specific issue.**

No issue number.

Fixes https://github.com/gomods/athens/issues/1521

Also adds a new dev formatter so things look prettier than Logrus'es TextFormatter...I'm tempted to make it even more fancy but for now it works. 
One of the main confusions is that GoEnv disabled our Request Logger Middleware if the GoEnv=production. 

That is mainly because we just fmt.Println the log line where we should be using our proper logger. 

We should make it so that the middleware is always in use, and if an Athens user wants to not see these logs, then they can just set their LogLevel to something higher than INFO 

In a related note: maybe the Request Logger Middleware should always log DEBUG instead of INFO? 
**What is the problem I am trying to address?**

Provide details on the reason for the validation failure.

**How is the fix applied?**

As part of the response message for the ValidationHook the response body can optionally contain a payload

If a payload is detected a message is logged similar to that shown below:

`WARN[0152] Module github.com/go-gitea/gitea:v1.5.1 Reason: Reason for warning Description: Detailed description of warning  http-method=GET http-path=/github.com/go-gitea/gitea/@v/v1.5.1.mod http-url=/github.com/go-gitea/gitea/@v/v1.5.1.mod
handler: GET /github.com/go-gitea/gitea/@v/v1.5.1.mod [403]`

It is the responsibility of the ValidationHook endpoint to determine if a build should fail or continue (403/200)

Fixes #1513 

**What is the problem I am trying to address?**

Underscores are not properly escaped, resulting formatting issues [here](https://docs.gomods.io/design/from-vcs2user/#fetcher)

**How is the fix applied?**

Escaping the underscore

**What is the problem I am trying to address?**

Typo in documentation.

**How is the fix applied?**

Fix spelling.

**Mention the issue number it fixes or add the details of the changes if it doesn't have a specific issue.**
