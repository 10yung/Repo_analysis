While trying to add a plotly plot, I am getting the following error 
```
Error in add_slide(doc, layout = "Blank", master = "Office Theme") : 
  could not find layout named "Blank" in master named "Office Theme"
```
Code used 
```
p = plot_ly( ldf, x = ~dates, y = ~m, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines', name = 'm' ) %>%
  
  layout( title = paste0( 'Plot of M values over time', tag ) )

graph2ppt(x = p, file="D:\\projects\\Chetan\\Variation of Values.pptx", width=6, height=5, append=T) 
```
Dear Tom,

This PR should help in adjusting your code to the usage of `officer::ph_with` and
`rvg::dml` instead of functions `officer::ph_with_*` that should be deprecated soon.

Let me know if you have questions about ph_with.

David

Hello,
I've been using your graph2ppt() function which was working beautifully appending graphs I made to an existing ppt I had. Suddenly I got this error:

graph2ppt(, file="/Users/hwaterhouse/Google Drive (hwaterhouse@ucdavis.edu)/PhD/Modesto/Manuscript 2nd chapter/Figures.pptx", append=TRUE)
Error in zip::unzip(zipfile = file, exdir = folder) : 
  zip error: `Cannot extract entry `ppt/media/image14.emf` from archive `/Users/hwaterhouse/Google Drive (hwaterhouse@ucdavis.edu)/PhD/Modesto/Manuscript 2nd chapter/Figures.pptx`` in file `zip.c:305`

It seems to think the ppt is zipped which it isn't... and now when I open my ppt other graphs I had in there from before using this function do not display (just a box with a red x in place of the picture of the graph). Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Hannah
Hi，
I get an error when using graph2ppt():

Error in xpath_search(x$node, x$doc, xpath = xpath, nsMap = ns, num_results = 1) : 
  Memory allocation failed : growing nodeset hit limit
 [2]
Calls: graph2ppt ... xml_find_first -> xml_find_first.xml_node -> xpath_search -> .Call

And I get some information from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40159864/getting-memory-allocation-failed-growing-nodeset-hit-limit-with-xml2-package. Unfortunately，I don't solve this problem. I will pleasure if you can give advice.
