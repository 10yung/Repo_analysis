This pull request fixes a retain cycle when using tombstone deletion with a predicate. The parent operation strongly retains the deletion operation using associated objects, and the parent operation is added to the dependencies of the deletion operation so that the deletion operation only starts after the parent completes, which causes the deletion operation to strongly reference the parent as well.
Hello All,

I am facing a strange issue using RestKit.Form the API I am getting (200 OK / 1199 objects).but it's saving only 1198 objects in core data.


Can any one help out on this issue.
Share Extensions (and other types of extensions, too) have no access to `[UIApplication sharedApplication]`. It's a compile-time issue. Unfortunatelly there is no `#ifdef`-based way to tell if we're compiling the library for an extension or for an app - unless we require the library consumers to add some specific macro to their projects, which may be more error-prone.

Issue: #2440, #2549 and possibly others

Tested in Xcode 10.3 and Xcode 11b5 as well.

Replaced NSURLConnection with NSURLSession.

It was about time to replace NSURLConnection. 
The NSURLConnection class should no longer be used.
For example, `connection:didSendBodyData:totalBytesWritten:totalBytesExpectedToWrite:` was not working anymore.
Please replace NSURLConnection with NSURLSession.

The NSURLConnection class is DEPRECATED.
The NSURLConnection class should no longer be used.  NSURLSession is the replacement for NSURLConnection.
Some delegate methods don't work anymore.

HI there, just spent some amount of time trying to get RestKit to work in my Siri Shortcut intent. In the end, i arrived at the conclusion that it's due to you using sharedapplication in your AFNetworking-wrappers.

I get the error
> 'sharedApplication' is unavailable: not available on iOS (App Extension) - Use view controller based solutions where appropriate instead."

I think this might be related to #2440 

Would be great to be able to use RestKit in extensions, widgets etc. but it won't be possible i think unless this is resolved.
Hi everyone!!

Has anyone run into the same problem?

Is this because of a data race issue?

Thanks!!
Thanks for nice library!
I've one issue and need your clarification.
My api's response is 11.1MB. And iOS app gets stuck on receiving the response.
What's the limit size of response using RestKit?
Is there anyway to specify the limit size?
It is 2 years to use this version of AFNetworking.
