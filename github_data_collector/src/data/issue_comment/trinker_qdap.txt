Hello, I just upgraded R and, when I try to install the qdap package, I am getting the error: Failed to install/load:
trinker/qdap
When I install qdap from CRAN, I get the error that 'chron' is not available for R 3.6

Every time I try to use the polarity function I get the following error
Error in derive_pubkey(key)

Tried all the reported approaches and doesnÂ´t help.

Please correct the issue or simply "exterminate" this piece of zgarbage
There was a duplicate `Imports` section in the `DESCRIPTION` file that caused installation issues:

![qdap_description_error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4910020/61419307-b03b1400-a8cb-11e9-8106-4ad6b4a0b49a.png)

There was also an error and warning in the vignette:

![qdap_vignette_error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4910020/61419328-c648d480-a8cb-11e9-8c7c-a0f75ec0c255.png)

This pull request passes R CMD check --as-cran
When I connected with Twitter API to get data tweets and use Qdap with polarity.frame customized throw the following error: derive_pubkey(key) : RAW() can only be applied to a 'raw', not a 'list'

for example: 
 
```
twitteR::setup_twitter_oauth(consumerKey, consumerSecret, accessToken, accessSecret) #openssl

standardKey.pol <- qdapDictionaries::key.pol customKey.pol 

customKey.pol <- qdap::sentiment_frame(qdapDictionaries::positive.words, qdapDictionaries::negative.words)

qdap::counts(qdap::polarity(phrase, polarity.frame = customKey.pol)) #throw error Error in derive_pubkey(key) : RAW() can only be applied to a 'raw', not a 'list'

qdap::counts(qdap::polarity(phrase, polarity.frame = standardKey.pol)) #sucessful
```
Any suggestion, thanks 
I am currently trying to install the qdap package on Ubuntu, but I get the "not available for R version 3.3.3. 
It has installed successfully installed on windows and works flawlessly. 
I have tried every which way to install it on Ubuntu, but have not been successful. I have tried to install using repo, install_version and downloading the package to install it. 

I currently am running Ubuntu 18.10 (an unfortunate accidental upgrade!!!). 

Any help you can provide with this is highly appreciated. 
I have word network plot and want to keep digits so they are plotted. When I use strip and set digit.remove to false it removes digits. I have used the apostrophe.remove set to true and to false to see if that works and it does. Wondering what might be going on. Thanks!
Small suggestion: It would be nice to have an option to return all top terms from `freq_terms`, instead of requiring the `top` argument.  Sure, we can set `top` equal to 1 billion, but it seems hacky and unelegant.  Or is there another way to get all term frequencies I'm not aware of?
The function replace_ordinal works fine for any number with two digits or less, but doesn't work past that. 

Works:
replace_ordinal("this is 91st")

Doesn't work:
replace_ordinal("this is 101st")
The multigsub function admittedly doesn't enable simultaneous global string substitutions which can have some unintended effects while using it. The R package mgsub implements a simultaneous string substitution which is slower than the sequential used in qdap. This pull request adds a `simultaneous` flag to multigsub to enable this type of substitution. The vignette was updated as well to reflect the change. I couldn't find any tests for this function so I didn't update those (or write any)

# input:
x <-"/index.php/front/yellow/searchHeading/heading/926/h_name/Architects/keyword/A//"

beg2char(x, "keyword")

# output:
# [1] "/in"

# expected output:
# "/index.php/front/yellow/searchHeading/heading/926/h_name/Architects/"
