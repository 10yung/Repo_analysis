Steps:
1. Create new project with modern cv template
2. Nothing is rendered and error is reported at the title display line

Hi Guys or girls, 

I am working on a more modern engine XeTeX. (under the engine directory).

One tricky question is about fontconfig, which may not work under WebAssembly environment.

Currently, I removed fontconfig such that the compilation can go ahead. 

But it means users who wishes to use non-standard tex fonts has to upload their fonts. Do you think it is a sensible decision?


First thing first, great work, looking forward to the official DockerHub image.

My question is:
Is it possible to setup a share volume between docker image and the host? 

I had some legacy tex directory for some documents, is it possible to use the SwiftLaTex docker image directly on those share volume directories with docker "-v" argument and then everything shows on web browser UI? 

It might be easier for us to handle the previous created docment with git version control without recreate the project in the UI again?

Many thanks.
I opened the local version of SwiftLatex, and I searched for a resume template. After i chose one,  something went wrong when i was about to edit it.
Please help me! Thanks anyway.

Hi,

We're heavily using Sharelatex and Overleaf for real-time collaborative edition of Latex documents. 

Does SwiftLaTeX support collaborative edition?

Thanks! --Martin

Can you please install `texlive-full` on your fileserver? I've been running into a lot of missing fonts and templates when testing with some documents from Overleaf.
Desired outcome: Be able to sign in with Google and for the session to not sign out when the browser is closed. 

Reality: I can successfully sign into Google Drive through `https://www.swiftlatex.com/oauth/login_oauth?type=google` and grant the appropriate permissions, but when I quit the browser and reopen `https://www.swiftlatex.com/ide/index.html` I get an error message: `You must log in first`, and I am forced to sign in again and grant permissions again. 
Hello,

For security reason, we can't use Google Drive or another external storage provider.
It'll be good to be able to use:

- local storage
- S3 compatible storage like minio: https://github.com/minio/minio

Regards
Can I suggest creating https://hub.docker.com/r/swiftlatex before anyone else, as I cannot find a user with that name? Then publishing the latest `swiftlatex/swiftlatex:latest` so people can fetch it like that.

Right now everybody has to either:
1. Pull the whole repo and build it themselves (and the build has its own `git clone` in it)
2. Copy the `DockerFile` and `docker-compose` manually, and build it like that.
