Extracting the contents of firesheep-0.1-1.xpi â€” Firesheep 0.1 (Toorcon Release) resulted in the warning below from Windows 10 antivirus software:

![Screenshot 30-11-2019 100739](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58370769/69904463-8aa43800-139e-11ea-9456-e6f4c09b6582.png)

The firefox is showing the add-on cannot be added because it is corrupt.
After cloning the repo and trying to run `./configure` or `./autogen.sh` I got:

`checking for Boost headers version >= 0.0.0... yes
checking for Boost's header version... 
configure: error: invalid value: boost_major_version=`

So I did:
`cat configure | grep "boost_cv_lib_version="`
And got:
boost_cv_lib_version=`cat conftest.i`
So I did:
`dpkg -s libboost-dev | grep 'Version'`
and I got:
`Version: 1.58.0.1ubuntu1`
So I changed the according line in configure to 
`version="1_58_0_1"`

And then I could configure and make.
Since 2010 I think most "famous" sites have already decided to move to mandatory SSL. I'm sure facebook have already done that, probably Twitter too. 

Are there any sites left that are still vulnerable AND this tool knows about them?
not compatible with new firefox version
Firesheep isn't working with firefox 48, and upon downgrading to firefox 45.0.6 it remained incompatible. Firefox dev addition didn't work either. All had xpinstall.signatures.required set to false, so it was simply a compatibility issue. What version _does_ it work with?
Stop making yourself chattel for Big Data.

#PrivacyRape as profit is evil.
Which firefox version is least problematic?
Help!
Any updates for the compatibility any time soon?
