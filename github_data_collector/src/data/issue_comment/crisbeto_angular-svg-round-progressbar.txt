If I set duration to 0 the circle isn't showing the current value.

i am using these angular versions:
```
"@angular-devkit/build-angular": "^0.803.4",
    "@angular-devkit/core": "^7.3.9",
    "@angular/animations": "^8.2.6",
    "@angular/cdk": "^7.3.7",
    "@angular/common": "^8.2.6",
    "@angular/compiler": "^8.2.6",
    "@angular/core": "^8.2.6",
    "@angular/forms": "^8.2.6",
    "@angular/material": "^7.3.7",
    "@angular/platform-browser": "^8.2.6",
    "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic": "^8.2.6",
    "@angular/router": "^8.2.6",

```
and this version of round-progressbar:
`"angular-svg-round-progressbar": "^3.0.1",`

the compiler will compile successfully and then get stuck with the above error. turning off ivy fixes the issue
I've used the control, and I think it's really great. But it does not seem to handle negative values. Am I mistaken? thanks
Hello, 
thanks for such a handy library!
I feel that there is a missing opportunity to be able to explicitly set initial value, just as it is there for maximum.
One possible use case could be setting a time range on a clock face, as if:
`<round-progress [max]='12' [initial]='3' [current]='7'>`

When compiling with Angular 8 with Ivy turned on I am getting the following error:
There is no format with import statements in '/node_modules/angular-svg-round-progressbar' entry-point

And the ng serve build fails. 

Using version 3.0.1
Works fine with Ivy turned off.

Thanks!
how can we change its behaviour to work on scroll instead of on page load.

If [max] is changed while the animation is still in progress, the round progress may show a wrong value. (Probably the values are not capped).

To reproduce:
Open the following link (official example):
http://crisbeto.github.io/angular-svg-round-progressbar/

- set Current to 0
- set Max to 1
- set duration to 80000 (80,000)
- set Current to 1635
- before the animation ends, set Max to 1500

Expected:
- Round progress should be filled because Current is > than Max

Actual:
- animation stops and fill value is somewhere 1%


I want to use it as circular range slider. Is it possible?
To change the value by touching to the slider stroke!
Upgrade to Angular 7 and Rxjs 6. Please let me know if any additional information is needed. 
Hi there! Can you please update bower on Heroku? I can't install the package.. It returns 502.

Thank You !
