It was  able to snap last item at v1.3.4, however after upgrading to v2.0.1 it will bounce back to the previous item rather than focus on the last item.

This PR adds support for right-to-left (RTL) layout direction.
I have a requirement where I need to center the items shown to the user, is that applicable?

hey!
is it possible to snap to a particular position of the list?

e.g. something like `rvLevels.scroolToPostion(postion);`


A warning appears when i swipe from the recyclerview.
The test machine is the Nexus 5x  android 7.0 version api 24.
Can I ignore it? 

 E/RecyclerView: Smooth Scroll action is being updated too frequently. Make sure you are not changing it unless necessary


I have a horizontal MultiSnapRV, my XML code:
```
<com.takusemba.multisnaprecyclerview.MultiSnapRecyclerView
        android:id="@+id/rv_weeks"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_gravity="center"
        app:msrv_gravity="start"
        app:msrv_snap_count="7" />
```

When I scroll it forward, it works amazing and smooth. But if I scroll backward, sometimes it scrolls 14 positions, not 7. Is it bug or I missed something?
