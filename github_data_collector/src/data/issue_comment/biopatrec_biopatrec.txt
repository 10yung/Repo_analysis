Is it possible to send a position command for one (or all) DOFs in VER?

That is, instead of sending a command about what action to take for a specified DOF, send a command about its desired position/angle. 
I followed all the steps on the starting guide and I can even create a recording session - which I created. My issue is in the Real-time Pattern Recognition which gives me the following message:

**MyoBandRecordingSession failed, trying to move on

I am not sure where the problem is. Can someone please help?
Hi,

As mentioned in my email, the minor updates here consist of:
- Adding the North American powerline harmonic (PLH NA) filter as an option to the frequency filter dropdown menu in GUI_SigTreatment.fig
- Modifying the matrix normalization in CreateMovMatrix.m; the current line, "movMatrixNorm = movMatrix ./ sqrt(sum(movMatrix.^2,2))" was producing an error message (due to that operation not being compatible with MATLAB 2014a, I believe, which is what we run BioPatRec on), so I changed it to use the bsxfun(@rdivide) function instead.

If you have any questions let me know!

Cheers,

Right now there is a "bug" on systems other than Windows (error reproduced on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Mac OS X 10.9):

When one wants to view a recording (Recordings >> "load") the "Show Recoding seassion" window pops up (as expected) but the following error occurs:

`Error using importdata (line 136)`
`Unable to open file.`

`Error in GUI_RecordingSessionShow>GUI_RecordingSessionShow_OpeningFcn (line 90)`
`backgroundImage = importdata('/../Img/relax.jpg');`
#### Reason:

Case sensitivity to file endings. Function calls an image with `*.jpg` ending which actually has `*.JPG`.
#### Fix:

Rename all file endings in `../Img` directory to `*.jpg`
