What do you mean by this?

> If you use jupyter-contrib-nbextensions, proceed as usual.

Could you spell out those steps, please?

Similar to #5, this currently fails on cells with a system command:

    !pip install numpy

These lines could be skipped in the same way.
I tried installing this with the commands you wrote:
`jupyter nbextension install https://github.com/drillan/jupyter-black/archive/master.zip --user
jupyter nbextension enable jupyter-black-master/jupyter-black`

But it's not working in Jupyter Lab...
Using Black `19.3b0`, Jupyter notebook `5.7.8`, and Python `3.7.3`, I get the following error when I try to format a cell.

```
[jupyter-black]
 Error: NameError
name 'black_reformat' is not defined
```
There's a discussion of PEP 8 on the Python ideas list. I suggest there that one might use black.py to 'line-wrap' the Python code to what is the current width of the editor window.

Hence my suggestion, that it be possible to set the  black line length to the width of the text box.

Using Jupyter Notebook in Firefox 53.0.2 on windows 7, Black freezes when I press Ctrl-l to format a cell with leading spaces.

Example:

Cell 1
print('hello')

Cell 2
[4x times Space]for a in range(10):
[8x times Space]print(a)

Pressing Ctrl-l in Cell 1 changes the code to 
print("hello")

Pressing Ctrl-l in Cell 2 freezes the notebook and I
need to kill the tab. Without leading spaces on the first line,
Cell 2 formats fine.
