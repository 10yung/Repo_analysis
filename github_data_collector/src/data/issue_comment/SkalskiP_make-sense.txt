Would it be possible to drop some noisy images from the dataset?

It'd be useful to see some running statistics like the number of labeled objects in each class and the number of images labeled so far.

When i'm labeling i always want to have these numbers in mind.

I found that labelbox (another labeling online tool) has this kind of statistics:

could you think of something like this?

Thank you for your good work

For keypoint/landmark annotation I think it would be great if the editor area would keep the keypoints from the last image when moving to the next one. As most of the times you want the same number of keypoints but you have not only recreate all the points but also assign the labels this is very cumbersome when you have many points lets say more than 10. If you already have all the label assigned points you simply need then to move them to the right place this is a lot faster than clicking them again and assign labels especially if you have images that are very similar so the keypoint might only move by less than 20 pixels between images.
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

Before the process of annotation, I believe many people go through the process of data cleaning: things like image-level labels (brightness, image quality,...). Furthermore, there might be a need to crop the images with a certain aspect ratio with a certain scale for the image.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Having a labeling and cropping tool for data cleaning with a batch ofdata. 



**Describe the bug**
The tool is very slow when we zoom in and make bounding box. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. upload images
2. zoom max in image
3. make bounding box

**Expected behavior**

In my team we are searching for some good labeling stuff and we finally found make-sense. It is very nice looking, easy to use tool, but I have some problems with it.

1. Is there any solution for saving project progress or (better) loading file with image names and labels just to keep labeling after restart of computer?

2. Is there (or will be) any solution for sharing work with many people labeling at the same time?

3. It will be nice to have information how many photos was labeled and how many are still to do.

Thank you for any answer.
I find labelling a very time consuming task, that's while a usual approach is to onboard more people to create both bigger datasets and consensus on labelled objects.

A way we could unite this with the current development of the tool is via creating a sort of "task" distribution, where a subset of the data can be added to a session and this sent to a specific labeler. That would free the need to have a user system (keep it lean and simple) and still distribute the tasks around. Could be potentially be set up through an API (but that's another feature request).

It is great to see someone picking up the visual data annotation problem seriously. 
However, you are obviously not the first one who has been trying that. I've tried and checked quiet a few data annotation tools in the past and I noticed they are all very weak if at best barely usable when it comes to doing segmentation masks. 

As either they go one of the two potential routes:

*Only allow polygonal input to mask polygons

*Only allow painting input via a pixel brush

But both of them have issues. Paint brushes are cumbersome if you wan to mask large areas and take a lot of time.
Polygons have an issue if you want to mark small and thin image regions as you simply would have to define so many points and often you can not just hit the edge correctly.

Best would be able to mix both of them so you can draw polygons and draw above the polygons in a multi layer fashion. Or if that is too complicated allow the option to bake the polygons down into the segmentation mask image and then have the option to use a paint brush to paint on top.
As you seem to answer fast ^^, I've some minor improvements that can make user gain some time.

The first time I tried your application, I wrote my first label then I pressed "Enter", which does nothing I know :D
I was hoping it would add the next label input automatically without pressing the "+" button.

I see two alternatives :
- When the user press enter after writing its label, it adds another label, and autofocus on this new label.
- And/Or when the user press the "+" button to add a new label, then it automatically focus on the label text. It will make the user gain one click and some time.

I know it is a really small feature, but I feel it can be useful !
I hope I was clear enough.

Hey :)

For my personnal use I face the problem that I have to parse again the export file to modify it to have a format I use on my AIs.

I would like to choose on exporting file, the things I want to export and how I want it. 
For example, I'm working on a project where my labels need to be on this format :
Filename.jpg x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max, class x_min2, y_min2, x_max2, y_max2, class2 etc... (if I have multiple anchors on my .jpg)

I can imagine on the export pop-up a new tab with the format I want to define. Filename, x coordinates, y coordinates, width, heigth, etc ... 

Of course I can develop a tool to convert it how I want, but I thought it could be usefull to add it.

Btw, great job. Your app rocks !
