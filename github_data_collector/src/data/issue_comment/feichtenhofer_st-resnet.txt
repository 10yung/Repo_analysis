Can anyone explain, thank you very much！
MATLAB:2015b
CUDA:8.0

When I run STMulNet.m , it comes the bug:

```
Error using cnn_train_dag (line 136)
Error detected on workers 1 2.

Error in STMulNet (line 674)
[info] = cnn_train_dag(net, imdb, fn, opts.train) ;

Caused by:
    Error using gpuArray/imresize (line 46)
    Expected input scale to be a real, positive scalar of numeric type on the CPU.

I'm not sure what's wrong? @feichtenhofer 
The models and data can not be download. Are there other links?
https://github.com/feichtenhofer/st-resnet/blob/8b4f28431b5abe881c3b5192c309ac7a303b5c9d/cnn_get_im_flow_batch.m#L87

I got an error while train: 
`Undefined function or variable 'vl_colsubset'.`
##  There is an error while I run STMulNet.m

Error using dagnn.Layer/load (line 200)
No property `pickTemporalCentre` for a layer of type `dagnn.Sum`.

## I have tried many version of MatconvNet, so I want to know which version of MatconvNet do you use while running STMulNet.m

 In your paper, xl+1 = xl ∗ Wˆ l + bl , where the biases bl are initialized as 0 and Wˆ l ∈ 1× 1× T× Cl × Cl are temporal filters with weights initialized by stacking identity mappings between feature channels,
1 ∈ R1× 1× 1× Cl × Cl , across time t = 1 . . . T. 
 I can not understand why the number of  the dimension of "1" and W is five?
