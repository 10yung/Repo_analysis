Depending on the project structure, it may be necessary to apply the plugin to multiple modules to create the required theme inheritance structure.

If we have a foundational layer (with Light & Dark) provided by module A and an intermediate layer (w/ Light & Dark) provided by module B, and then an App Layer that inherits from the intermediate layer

Currently, all `ThemeStencilProvider`s found on the classpath will be generated into every module the plugin is applied to.
Remove the extra library module and allow the app to toggle between generated themes
