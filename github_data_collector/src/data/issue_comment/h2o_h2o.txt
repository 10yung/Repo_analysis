Hi, 

I just found this URL ( [Web Framework Benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&hw=ph&test=plaintext) ) to benchmark the different web framework and the results shows the H2O ranking as well, as i found in the project README file, that is very fast and also provides much quicker response, i am not expert in bench-marking and analyze the results, may it is wrong, just i want to know, is this benchmark valid ? or why the H2O rank is not very good in different sections. 

Regards.
https://github.com/h2o/h2o/blob/2efb98da0f308c3ca1d5a322e62b74597090924b/lib/common/socket.c#L642
Hi! This PR adds `h2o_probe_log_request()` and `h2o_probe_log_response()` calls to hopefully the correct location in the http3 server code path. I checked using Linux with  h2o-httpclient + [h2olog](https://github.com/toru/h2olog) that the probes are indeed triggered.
These macros aren't used by h2o, but this header file is the first search engine hit for someone looking to polyfill OpenSSL 1.0.2 so that a single program can work portably against either 1.0.2 or 1.1.0. Therefore, it is helpful to the wider community if this header file contains the *full* polyfill for `BIO_METHOD` setters added in 1.1.0.

(The two methods I needed polyfills for, personally, were `BIO_meth_free` and `BIO_meth_set_create`. The rest, such as `BIO_meth_set_gets`, are only for completeness, following the logic above.)

OpenSSL 1.1.0 also adds getters such as `BIO_meth_get_ctrl(bm)`. I have no need for them myself, but the same logic applies: this useful header file should be a full polyfill for the benefit of the wider community.

https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/BIO_meth_new.html
(The documented `BIO_meth_{get,set}_read_ex` and `BIO_meth_{get,set}_write_ex` are new in 1.1.0 and therefore code that wants also to work with 1.0.2 shouldn't be using those.)
Hi, 

I am interested in your library (libh2o) and and want to use it in C/C++, I search for 1 day and I can not find any useful manual to cover all ability and base functionality such as multi-threading, http2, message processing, MIME parsing, complex file serving and so on..  just found the simple document 
[A warm welcome to libh2o](https://powerdns.org/libh2o/#http/2specificfeatures)

I am not application user, I mean h2o as web-server, I want to use it as library 
for now i can add it to my sample C++ code, and compile it and have a very basic functionality, but need more, to use advanced feature, multi-threading & so on.

would you please help me in this regard, 
I couldnt understand it. access log is only global directive and there is no any other directive that i can see to set log files for vhost individually.

wiki page has information but it is confusing when i looked the default config file on freebsd installation.
for example , access log information is written on top of the config file but in wiki page, it is 
bottom of host configs like this one. i also added this directive end of the host directive for only access log and error log but i couldnt see any error for config and h2o web server does not use it these too. it writes log on default location /var/logs/h2o/

how can i handle logs more effectively, for example to record logs into database like postgresql.

 https://github.com/h2o/h2o/wiki/redirect-HTTP-to-HTTPS
When i created a web site with self signed ssl and to test h2o web server for this web site.
i also created web page which has only phpinfo(); command to show php setup information.

but if i use phpinfo(); and get the information about my installation.
I can only see the page as plain text without any css modifications and no php logo etc.

When i deactivated this header in h2o.conf , it shows everything normally.

#header.add: "Content-Security-Policy: default-src https:"

This patch removes a debug printf on receiving unknown frame
type, which could flood system log when a client sends a lot of
unknown frame types.
This is necessary so that the length used here:
https://github.com/h2o/h2o/blob/master/lib/http3/common.c#L387 can't overflow the destination buffer
hi ,

I would like to try h2o on dragonflybsd but i couldnt success about it.
Firstly , one of the dependent port asked py27-setuptools and stoped to install than i install seperately python 2.7 and devel/py-setuptools then i continue to install but this time
mruby gives error and i thought i can skip that by canceling Mruby option from port option than i tried again but this time give error again and it says something is not there. important file does not exist.

First Error Related to Python in this case dependent port python 2.7 has not been installed but this port ask its setup tool.
