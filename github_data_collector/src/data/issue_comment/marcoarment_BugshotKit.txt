Sometimes e-mail is not an option and there is a need to send a report to somewhere else. 
For example as a developer I could implement a JIRA plugin that sends information to JIRA instead of e-mail. 

"os_log(3) has replaced asl(3)"
I have a temporary solution:

The static analyzer was complaining about aslresponse_next() and aslresponse_free(); the deprecation comments point out appropriate replacements, which I've substituted here.

Hello 

Well i included Bugshot in my delegate and added following line in my didFinishLaunching function 
"    #if defined(DEBUG) || defined(ADHOC)
        [BugshotKit enableWithNumberOfTouches:1 performingGestures:BSKInvocationGestureDoubleTap feedbackEmailAddress:@"xxx@gmail.com"];
    #endif
"
But when i double tap in map nothing happening there. I added breakpoint right before "#if defined (DEBUG) ..."
and its not coming in "if". Can you help why?

Very slow input when the triple tap gesture is enabled. Special character suggestions come up. Device - iPhone 5s

Although it's a clever way to prevent people from shipping BugshotKit to the AppStore, the "class dump" private API reference creates additional hassle for developers. In order to exclude BugshotKit from App Store build configurations, we have several unappealing choices: 

1) Manually create a static library every time `master` is updated, which makes it likely that the Bugshot library will become outdated compared to the current `master` branch. (I just discovered mine was 41 commits behind.)

2) Configure the Xcode project to include a freshly-built static library as a target dependency, which is not as straightforward a process as it should be. I'm not sure it's even possible to do this on a per-build-config basis.

3) Add a separate target for dev/beta builds.

4) Manually add/remove the source `.h` and `.m` files when submitting to the App Store.

It's much simpler and cleaner to include BugshotKit dynamically, leaving it up to the developer to exclude BugshotKit from `release` build configurations however she sees fit, perhaps with preprocessor macros. This isn't possible while the "class dump" safety feature is still around.

That's all, thanks a lot for open sourcing this, it's super useful!

Hi!
I recently fund that when I'm developing in the iOS Simulator my mac use one core at 100% and, consequently, the fans work and full speed and the temperature rises a lot. 
At first I was thinking that maybe is some bug with a new version of the simulator. But I tried to use instruments to search for some bug in my code and I found that BugshotKit is causing this. Specifically -[BugshotKit updateFromASL] method.

![Instruments](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/750912/2331701/71473220-a44d-11e3-8629-95f6d818ec5e.png)

I suppose that this method is the one that checks for logs. This happen every time I output a log in my code. But the main problem is that a single line of Log makes this method consume 100% of cpu time for 5 seconds or more. 

Is this a normal behavior (because we are trying to read the logs) or is this a real issue?

Thanks! ;)
