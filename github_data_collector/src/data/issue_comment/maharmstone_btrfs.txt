Winbtrfs shows perfectly to use within fully encrypted [veracrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html) devices. However, when trying to add further devices to a Winbtrfs-formated veracrypt partition, e.g. to have the benefits of a software raid1, it is not possible to choose from other virtual veracrypt devices which are mounted since Windows XP under \Device\VeracryptVolumeXXX

May I please ask to allow for further devices selection (like \Device\VeracryptVolumeXXX) than the implemented \Device\HarddiskXXX\PartitionYYY?
ARM build tested on Windows 8.1 RT, works normal, ARM64 not tested yet.
Using 1.5 on a 4tb btrfs hdd with compression and zstd enabled, I noticed that the drive kept becoming write protected. I tried setting compression to 0 and explicity setting readonly to 0 in the registry and restarting but that made no difference. Seeing issue #68 I booted back into linux and the drive was unable to be mounted. The kernel messages after trying to mount were "tree level mismatch" "failed to read block groups" and "open_ctree failed"
I then attempted ro run btrfs check and btrfs check --repair on the filesystem, and neither of those were able to start, reporting "child eb corrupted"  and "free_space_extent_key" failed


Booting back into windows however the disk still mounts, and it seems I am able to copy files off of it onto my windows disk.

Any ideas about how to fix the disk for linux, and prevent this from occurring again?
It seems that I cannot pin two folders in the btrfs drive to quick access.

How to reproduce this:
(1) choose one folder in the btrfs drive, right click and choose pin to quick access.
(2) choose another folder in the same drive and pin to quick access.

The second folder never appears.
Hello everyone. 

I wanted to try out this driver so I created a virtual disk (VHDX type, expanding, 2GB max size) and added one partition to it (primary 2GB size) then formatted to BTRFS using ".\mkbtrfs.exe P:" which went well. 

After that it is mounted I can copy in explorer and use it but from wsl I cannot create directories as it says `mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/mnt/e/a’: Input/output error` everytime I use mkdir. It works in explorer, also I can use touch to create files. Default mount options are `E:\ on /mnt/e type drvfs (rw,noatime,uid=1000,gid=1000,metadata,case=dir)` and it also doesn't work with `E: on /mnt/e type drvfs (rw,noatime,metadata,case=dir)` 

BUT when case=off it works and it creates the directory. The only problem with that is that I want to enable case sensitivity for all the sub folders too. Is there anything I can do to make it work or is this a limitation of the driver?

Driver: latest 1.5
Windows: Windows 10 Pro 1903 Build 18362.476
WSL: Ubuntu eoan (latest) installed from store then upgraded using do-release-upgrade
wsl.conf is what the README says + options = "metadata,case=dir"

Thank you for your help!
I am trying backing up the data and will attach more detailed logs.
When I try to upgrade from v1.4 to v1.5 on a Windows 7 x64 VM (ran via VMWare Workstation 15 Player) with a thumb drive formatted as BTRFS (formatted with v1.4 of the btrfs driver installed) plugged in, it crashes. I am attaching the minidump:

When I plug in a BTRFS formatted thumb drive (formatted with v1.4 of the btrfs driver installed) into my Windows 7 x64 VM (ran via VMWare Workstation 15 Player) with v1.5 of the btrfs driver installed, it crashes the OS. The mini dump is attached:

I am using Windows 10 (Version 10.0.18362 Build 18362) and after install driver I see it in device manager and regedit but I don't see a volume (e.g. in explorer).
Thanks in advance for any help.

I am using Btrfs für Win with Encfs file encryption, and now I had the issue that some very deep folders could not be read. This happened without mounted encryption, so it was just that the folders were deep and long. I can not tell the exact length though.
