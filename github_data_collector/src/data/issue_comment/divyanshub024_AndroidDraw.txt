This PR adds support for the other types of constructor which allows the view to be used from code, rather than just from XML layouts.

This is tested as working from both Kotlin and Java.
ERROR: Could not install Gradle distribution from 'https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.6-all.zip'.

Hi, @divyanshub024:

Thank you very much for your AndroidDraw library! I optimized the painting experience with multiple fingers. Example:

Hi @divyanshub024 

I just modified your drawing library, to support older API up to 15. Not sure you are interested to make it part of your official release?

Thank you very much.

Hi @divyanshub024 

I was wondering, do you have any plan to add the following feature as a part of your library? What my current use case is

1. Load an external image, as background overlay.
2. During hand drawing operation, all drawn operation will be performed on another foreground overlay. It will not "dirty" the loaded external image in background overlay.
3. If user is happy with the drawing, he can press save. Both foreground overlay and background overlay, will be combined as single new images.

Thank you.

Hi @divyanshub024 ,

I have searched for a really good drawing library, to be used in note taking app project (Is a closed source project) - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yocto.wenote

One of the most requested features of the note taking app, is the capability to insert hand-drawn picture as attachments.

I have tested your library and I'm truly impressed with it. I decide to embed it into the note taking app.

May I request for more coloring option. One of my favorite note taking apps - Google Keep, is using the following approach to provide more coloring options.

Thank you very much. Please kindly let me know if there's anything I can contribute. Kotlin is a pretty new thing for me, but I'm quite comfortable in Android development using Java.
