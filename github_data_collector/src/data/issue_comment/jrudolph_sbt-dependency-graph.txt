[coursier](https://get-coursier.io/) provides an option to print a [reversed tree](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-resolve.html#reverse-tree) of dependencies (your package being the leaves).
It could be nice to provide this kind of option for tasks like `dependencyBrowseTree`.
In its current form `sbt dependencyList` outputs even the current project module in the list of dependencies, which is not really a dependency but a reference to itself. Is it possible to exclude this?


Fixes #109
I already tried `sbt module1/compile:dependencyTree` or `sbt module2/compile:dependencyTree` but it still runs every project anyway.

I would like to generate the dependencies tree of all projects as a file. how can I do that?
I'm trying to get around a problem with our dependency tree being truncated as part of a CI task that doesn't have an interactive terminal, so uses the 80-character default and is truncating dependency versions (#173). This can be replicated pretty easily from the command line:

```
➜  stty cols 70 && sbt dependencyTree | grep jsr310
[info]   +-com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype:jackson-datatype-jsr310:2..
```

Unfortunately the terminal width also affects the output to file, which I don't think is intentional:

```
➜  stty cols 70 && sbt 'dependencyTree::toFile dependencies.txt'
...
[info] Wrote dependencyTree to 'dependencies.txt'
[success] Total time: 0 s, completed 05-Aug-2019 10:17:59
➜  grep jsr310 dependencies.txt 
  +-com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype:jackson-datatype-jsr310:2..
```
This is an PR adding support to avoid truncating trees in environments without tty and resolves issue #173 simply.

jline2 creates an UnsupportedTerminal in environments that do not have a tty, but it has a column size of 80.
In my projects I often have a very dense graph, which just doesn't fit into a 1280x1024 canvas, and also this makes the graph a bit more responsive.
I think it'd be a very useful option to filter out all `libraryDependencies` and just show all the sbt subprojects/modules.

This plugin seems to use sbt's internal APIs which are no longer exposed in 1.3.x series. This issue is to fix the same
