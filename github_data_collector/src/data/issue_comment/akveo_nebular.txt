I'm trying to authenticate with graphql, the server returns my token but NbAuth isn't taking it, I guess because of the kind of response graphql sends

```
import { NbPasswordAuthStrategy, NbAuthJWTToken } from '@nebular/auth';
import { environment } from '../../environments/environment';

export const socialLinks = [
  {
    url: 'https://github.com/akveo/nebular',
    target: '_blank',
    icon: 'github',
  },
  {
    url: 'https://www.facebook.com/akveo/',
    target: '_blank',
    icon: 'facebook',
  },
  {
    url: 'https://twitter.com/akveo_inc',
    target: '_blank',
    icon: 'twitter',
  },
];

export const authOptions = {
  strategies: [
    NbPasswordAuthStrategy.setup({
      name: 'email',
      baseEndpoint: environment.apiUrl,
      token: {
        class: NbAuthJWTToken,
        key: 'token',
      },
      login: {
        endpoint: '/',
        method: 'post',
      },
      register: {
        endpoint: '/auth/sign-up',
        method: 'post',
      },
      logout: {
        endpoint: '/auth/sign-out',
        method: 'post',
      },
      requestPass: {
        endpoint: '/auth/request-pass',
        method: 'post',
      },
      resetPass: {
        endpoint: '/auth/reset-pass',
        method: 'post',
      },
    }),
  ],
  forms: {
    login: {
      socialLinks: socialLinks,
    },
    register: {
      socialLinks: socialLinks,
    },
  },
};
```

```
login(): void {
     this.user = this.loginForm.value;
     this.errors = []
     this.messages = []
     this.submitted = true
     const data = {
       variables: {
         input: {
           email: email,
           passwordHash: pass
         }
       },
       query: 'mutation login($input: LoginInput) { login(input: $input){ token } }',
     }
     this.service.authenticate(this.strategy, data).subscribe((result: NbAuthResult) => {
       this.submitted = false
       console.log(result)
       if (result.isSuccess()) {
         this.messages = result.getMessages()
       } else {
         this.errors = result.getErrors()
       }

       const redirect = result.getRedirect()
       if (redirect) {
         setTimeout(() => {
           return this.router.navigateByUrl(redirect)
         }, this.redirectDelay)
       }
       this.cd.detectChanges()
     })
   }
```

Graphql return:

```
{
"data":{
  "login":{      "token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJkYXRhIjoiYW05eVoyNTJRR2R0WVdsc0xtTnZiUT09IiwiaWF0IjoxNTc5NDA3NjIyLCJleHAiOjE1ODAwMTI0MjJ9.adP0HmrGJPOgtTMudDGX81-E1ScGooe-XRGA_ywnKwI"
    }
  }
}
```

### Issue description

**Current behavior:**
When our nbContextMenu is empty (or null), we have to handle an ugly ngIf around that element. Potentially having twice the same tags, but just one with the [nbContextMenu] attribute and one without.

**Expected behavior:**
The nbContextMenu could simply disconnect the `dynamicOverlayHandler` when the item list is empty rather than calling a `validateItems`. That way we could support receiving the menuItems later or not having menuItems at all in some cases.

**Steps to reproduce:**
`[nbContextMenu]="null"` or `[nbContextMenu]="[]"` should just be handled. Nothing should show.

The new version of Eva changed the NbSelect's `option list container` offset from 0 to 8px. The only way I can think of customising this property is through inheritance, providing a new component.

Is there a way of customising this value with token strategy?

### Issue description

**Current behavior:**
It appears that 'active' state is set to the first NbMenuItem if the URL contains a queryParams - ?something. My understanding is that 'pathMatch' property is setting the first matching NbMenuItem in the menu as 'selected' on every URL change, so no matter what you chose in the menu - the top item will always get 'active' styles applied.


**Expected behavior:**
'active' styles are toggled per NbMenuItem selected

**Steps to reproduce:**
My sub-menu contains the items that link to the following:
/pages/report/widget?naviID=67f05152-a2c0-4a41-aee5-b05edc6fe41a
/pages/report/widget?naviID=4cd3796c-141d-43cb-87d8-ecff08469d9a
/pages/report/widget?naviID=74903d6f-38df-4382-a5a4-92825f14c13a
/pages/report/widget?naviID=b99ee72b-d7ee-4636-b58e-77656c1f2d7b
Clicking on any of the items will update URL and do other business logic, but will not set the selected item styles to 'active'.

**Related code:**
Not sure how relevant this piece is, but that's how NbMenuItem is created in my code.

**Current behavior:**
I have an event in the nb-action when clicked it will show something and hide the nb-action, if I click once the nb-action it will go all fine, but if I double click it will redirect to "#".

**Expected behavior:**
Don't redirect if I don't want to.

**Steps to reproduce:**
Create an nb-action with icon atributte and add an event to it.

**Related code:**

```
<nb-actions class="ml-auto" [@disappear] *ngIf="!info">
  <nb-action icon="info" (click)="openInfo()"></nb-action>

### Issue description

I saw the example code in nebular website:
`
<input [nbDatepicker]="datepicker" nbInput>
<nb-datepicker #datepicker></nb-datepicker>
`
That works fine, but I want to put icon into nbInput like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59679364/72322820-41a40b00-36e2-11ea-8efb-4436ae2195fd.png)

I couldn't find any example about nbIcon in input.
Have any ideas about this? 



Hello
I am facing an issue with refresh-token support mechanism.
As far as I understand, Nebular handle refresh token by invoke of **isAuthenticatedOrRefresh** method.
While sending a bulk of http requests to the server, Nebular handler recognizes that a refresh-token is needed and sends a lot of requests(1 per each request)  for refresh-token instead of waiting for one refresh-token to return.
In that situation, the first refresh-token request returns ok and the corresponding http request gets the required data with no problem, BUT, the other requests, fail.
Attached you can find the result as we get them on Network capture.
Please advise how should we handle refresh-token while working with Nebular.
Is it a bug or wrong way of implementation?
Thanks in advance,
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29532821/72220479-9d8f5800-3559-11ea-8850-50f79f720916.png)

I want to be able to show the menu items according to their permissions, the user "user" has permission to see the dashboard and iu-features and the admin has permission to everything
app.module.ts

`NbSecurityModule.forRoot({
      accessControl: {
          user: {
          view: ['dashboard', 'ui-features']
        },
        admin: {
          view: ['*']
        }
      }
    })`

page-menu.ts

`const dashboardMenu: NbMenuItem[] = [
      {
        title: 'Main',
        link: '/pages/dashboard',
        home: true,
        children: undefined,
        data: {
          permission: 'view',
          resource: 'dashboard'
        }
      },
    ];`

pages-component.ts

`ngOnInit() {
    this.authMenuItems();
  }

  authMenuItems() {
    this.menu.forEach(item => {
      this.authMenuItem(item);
    });
  }

  authMenuItem(menuItem: NbMenuItem) {
    if (menuItem.data && menuItem.data['permission'] && menuItem.data['resource']) {
      this.accessChecker.isGranted(menuItem.data['permission'], menuItem.data['resource']).subscribe(granted => {
        menuItem.hidden = !granted;
      });
    } else {
      menuItem.hidden = true;
    }
    if (!menuItem.hidden && menuItem.children != null) {
      menuItem.children.forEach(item => {
        if (item.data && item.data['permission'] && item.data['resource']) {
          this.accessChecker.isGranted(item.data['permission'], item.data['resource']).subscribe(granted => {
            item.hidden = !granted;
          });
        } else {
          // if child item do not config any `data.permission` and `data.resource` just inherit parent item's config
          item.hidden = menuItem.hidden;
        }
      });
    }
  }`
Hi,

How do I go about overriding the padding on the nb-card control?

I have tried the following:

  <nb-card-body style="{'padding': '5px, 15px, 5px, 15px'}">
    <ngx-utg-watchlist-grid></ngx-utg-watchlist-grid>
  </nb-card-body>

but it still seems to use the default values which appear to be coming the theme.  I have also tried using the [NgStyle] method and this doesn't work either.

I have even created a function in my typescript component to try and call that but that doesn't appear to work either.

I am at a bit of a loss as to what might be causing the problem - Do I need to create a CSS class and then apply it to the nb-card-body?
