I try to find way to launch peertalk ios with linux server backend.

I try to understand, is there any way to replace peertalk mac os with usbmuxd ( libimobiledevice )

Can I ask for some hint?
I am trying to make an HDMI -> iPad application.

Ideally, the configuration would go as follows:

HDMI -> converter -> USB-C -> iPad -> decode HDMI data into video

Preferably, I'd only need to use one-way communication - I don't care for the iPad to respond to the HDMI provider (unless that's necessary). Is it possible to instead of PeerTalk... just, PeerListen?
My app suite connects Windows/Mac with iOS and I'm trying to use unified communication protocol. Apparently I cannot use PeerTalk directly on Windows. So I'd love to strip off everything but the `usbmuxb` service features of PeerTalk codebase, just to ensure that a TCP socket server running on iOS can receive data through USB.

Now the question is: **Can I achieve my goal by simply using the `PTUsbHub` class alone?**
I can't initialize PTUsbHub

PTUSBHub failed to initialize: Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=1 "Operation not permitted"
By using your library I faced up with slow transferring issue. My setup is using serial port for grabbing incoming data and translate them via usb to iOS. My serial is usually has 115200 baud rate (it's about ~ 230kbits/s) and I see the big differences with displaying big data in uitextview which were received from serial port and from usb (using peertalk). The data from serial port is displaying almost immediately. 
I want to know if it's possible to connect the peertalk iOS app with Ubuntu OS, without using the MacOS app.
When pulling PeerTalk through CocoaPods it is not pulling the latest codebase. Its actually pulling an old commit since version 0.0.1 points to an old commit.

Would it be possible to push a new podspec to cocoapods master repo for version 0.0.2 and tag the master branch with tag 0.0.2?

I can do a PR for the podspec if you will
Example for iOS works ok, but when I'm trying to use libs in my own project (swift version with objective-c++ .mm classes bridges) I get next error:

`Cannot initialize a variable of type 'PTExampleTextFrame *' (aka '_PTExampleTextFrame *') with an rvalue of type 'void *'
`

in this function (Peertalk Example) `PTExampleProtocol.h`

also this header file for Mac target/project, so does why iOS target/project reference to it?

```
static dispatch_data_t PTExampleTextDispatchDataWithString(NSString *message) {
  // Use a custom struct
  const char *utf8text = [message cStringUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
  size_t length = strlen(utf8text);
  //CFAllocatorAllocate(nil, 1 + length, 0);
  PTExampleTextFrame *textFrame = CFAllocatorAllocate(nil, sizeof(PTExampleTextFrame) + length, 0);
  memcpy(textFrame->utf8text, utf8text, length); // Copy bytes to utf8text array
  textFrame->length = htonl(length); // Convert integer to network byte order
  
  // Wrap the textFrame in a dispatch data object
  return dispatch_data_create((const void*)textFrame, sizeof(PTExampleTextFrame)+length, nil, ^{
    CFAllocatorDeallocate(nil, textFrame);
  });
```

I setup a http-server on Macbook, then perform  "iproxy 8080 8080", finally I need to visit the website on an iPhone, can I directly enter 127.0.0.1:8080 safari it? or write an APP, which wrapped peertalk.

best wish for you ,i am not good at english.:-D
I just spent several hours debugging this - it doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere. Am I missing something?
