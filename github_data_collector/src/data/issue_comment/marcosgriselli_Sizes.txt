## Expected Behavior
When the size is changed to a new device, the view controller should have the same safe area that it would have if it were running on that device.

## Actual Behavior
When the size is changed to a new device, the safe area does not change.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  1. Run Sizes on an iPhone 8 Plus
  2. Select Readme
  3. The safe area is small (ok)
  4. Change size to iPhone Xs
  5. The safe area remains small (not ok)
  6. For contrast, you can run Sizes on an iPhone Xs and see the difference:

## Specifications

  - Version: Any
  - Platform: Any
  - Subsystem: Any
This is more of an experimental feature. After getting #2 done we should be able to analyze each view frame and its hierarchy and evaluate if the device/orientation/font change created a layout issue (for example a label's frame going beyond its super view frame when not in a scroll view). 

Again, this is an experimental feature and any help/recommendation/opinions are highly appreciated.
After adding #8 it would be nice to have an example of screenshot based testing with Sizes handling all the different device sizes and fonts. Ideally, we would have an **iOSSnapshotTestCase** extension for Sizes where we can call an action that evaluates the current screen on all supported devices.
The feature will be called "View All" and it will screenshot all the possible variations of devices, orientations and fonts, and display them in an image gallery. This will drastically reduce the time needed to generate an overview of our screen in every scenario.
