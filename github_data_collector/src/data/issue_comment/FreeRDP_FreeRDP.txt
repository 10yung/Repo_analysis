Reverted #5838, simply because it was a mistake in understanding how rdpNla*, rdpTls* instances are managed. After digging, I found that it is allocated in transport_connect_nla and freed by freerdp_disconnect. Furthermore, I found that the output from ASAN, that pointed to this leak, was actually caused because the proxy **itself** didn't close all active connections gracefully. And, I found a real leak in `nla_free` (it didn't free nla->negoToken).
in server.c:92 a message is malloced and posted to the queue, but if won't be processed, a leak will occur when MessageQueue_Free will be called.
-new versions of freerdp does not forward smartcard, old versions were working fine, after remmina update (uses libs) freerdp 2 and remmina stopped forwarding smart cards (currently using daily problem still persists):

When I have a FreeRDP session in focus in xmonad, and xscreensaver locks my screen, after unlocking the screen, my keyboard no longer works, neither in the remote session nor locally, until I use the mouse to disconnect from the remote session. When the FreeRDP window is out of focus and xscreensaver locks the screen, this is not a problem.

OS: NixOS
xmonad 0.15
FreeRDP 2.0.0-rc4
xscreensaver 5.43
xmobar 0.32
I have been trying unsuccessfully for a few days to get FreeRDP to connect to a Win 10 VM. I can get a connection via Rdesktop and Windows remote desktop tool however FreeRDP continues to give the following output:
`[ERROR][com.freerdp.core.transport] - BIO_should_retry returned a system error 32: Broken pipe
[ERROR][com.freerdp.core.nego] - Protocol Security Negotiation Failure
[ERROR][com.freerdp.core] - freerdp_set_last_error ERRCONNECT_SECURITY_NEGO_CONNECT_FAILED [0x0002000C]
[ERROR][com.freerdp.core.connection] - Error: protocol security negotiation or connection failure`

Our setup:
Host: Ubuntu Server LTS 18.04 running VirtualBox VMs guest system Windows 10 Pro
Client: Zero clients using OpenThinClient os pxe booted from Ubuntu server.
FreeRDP 2.0.0-dev5 (3aa6047b3) as included in OpenThinClient server package 2019.1.3.

On the VM side:
VirtualBox VMs set up with individual ports for rdp. Each instance has static ip being enforced by router to VM's MAC address.
Windows 10 Pro configured for RDP with admin user and secondary remote login user profile.
Windows firewall currently disabled during testing.

RDP connection is over LAN, no external access.

Troubleshooting steps:
Attempted FreeRDP connection with auto negotiated security as well as manually setting TLS, nla, and RDP. 
Have disabled nla requirement on windows VM.
In VirtualBox tried both null and guest options for RDP security.
Connection attempts have all been made using ip and port, no host name.
Tried connecting with '-sec-nla' arguments.

Just to reiterate, I can connect with no issues from a windows machine using default RDP client and from OpenThinClient os Rdesktop client. Server and VMs are all fresh os installs setup new in the last month. 



I have been using FreeRDP xfreerdp version 1.0.2 to authenticate/test an RDP session absolutely fine but with the introduction of TLS1.1/1.2/1.3 it means that I need an updated version of xfreerdp.

I have installed 2.0.0-rc4 (centos) from repos and also tried to build other v2 versions from source - all exhibit the same issue:

The "authenticate only" option does not work purely on the command line (i.e. no GUI). If I run "xfreerdp /version" I get errors about the DISPLAY variable, but it shouldn't be trying to open a window - just display the version on the command line. This would be the same as authonly - it shouldn't try to open up a window, just open a session to the remote computer, login with the supplied credentials, then exit out with a good/bad status) - all on the command line. There is also some confusion about the option to use (the man page says +auth-only but I have tried various combinations - none of which work.

Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?


**Environment:**

~]$ cat /etc/centos-release
CentOS Linux release 7.7.1908 (Core)

~]$ xfreerdp /version
This is FreeRDP version 2.0.0-rc4 (n/a)

**Command to launch:**

~]$ xfreerdp /u:User /v:win-machine9 /gd:networks '/p:Password'

The new window is launching properly. When I try to get a full screen of the window using **_Ctrl+Alt+Enter_** then the user in the system gets logged off and redirected to the CentOS login page as a new boot. All running applications were killed.
**Describe the bug**
Smartcard redirection doesn't work with Windows 10/2012/2016 for some of our customers and "No valid certificates were found on this smart card. Please try another smart card or contact your administrator." is shown on the server when trying to login using the smartcard. It works nicely with Windows 2008. This seems to be because of the Smart Card Service start and stop behavior:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/hh849637(v%3Dws.11)#smart-card-service-start-and-stop-behavior

However, smartcard redirection works nicely with the official client, so there must be something that freerdp does wrongly. I've tried to set `REDIRECTED_SMARTCARD` flag (https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/commit/0b85e22012a4a826cb683f1cd33a03f842205e1c), which is not set by freerdp currently, but it seems that it doesn't help, unfortunately.

The freerdp output doesn't contain any errors.

Any idea what needs to be done to fix this?

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Connect to Windows 10/2012/2016 using `--no-nla --plugin rdpsnd  --plugin rdpdr --data scard: --` options. (They use an old syntax for some reason, but it seems that it is correctly translated to `-no-nla` and `/smartcard` options).
2. Try to use smartcard when logging.
3. "No valid certificates were found on this smart card. Please try another smart card or contact your administrator." is shown.

**Application details**
Tested with rc4 on RHEL 7/8 including #5499 and https://github.com/ondrejholy/FreeRDP/commit/0b85e22012a4a826cb683f1cd33a03f842205e1c. It has been tried with several other smartcard fixes from master, but without any success.

**Additional context**
As a workaround, "net start SCardSvr" server task can be called each 1 minute, or on some concrete events. See:
