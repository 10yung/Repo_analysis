I am 40yrs old, and my career has badly changed the course and now I am looking into changing career and prefer coding. Any help how to kick start this new journey?
Thanks and highly appreciated for any guidance.
added my analysis to address Issue #36
older applicants are decreasingly likely to get a job after bootcamp.
Looking for factors that correlate with no job after bootcamp. These factors should increase with age so we can discern causality. https://www.kaggle.com/chessybo/bootcamp-success-vs-age

Why not try to assess competence?  High wages in IT are justified on the basis that IT requires greater 'intelligence'.  I have always found this suspect.  It would be great to get some insight into this from a wide survey like this.

Thanks.
I'm interested to find out the population numbers relevant to when the survey was active, ie how many users of Free Code Camp and Code Newbie was the survey sent to? This would be useful for getting a survey response % and in turn work out the P value (margin of error)

I am using this survey data for my Dissertation as part of a Master of Information Systems and Technology degree and the population data would be pretty useful. I can't find it in any of the links so far. (ping @QuincyLarson )

Hello,

I am currently working on a data visualisation project and I am basing it around this data set. I found the data dictionary below. I asked this question already on Kaggle by the way but I haven't received any reply yet.

Anyway, something that is not fully clear to me is the meaning of the field IsSoftwareDev.

Does it mean

a) I was software engineer already before attending a bootcamp, used online learning resources and so on? 
b) I am new to coding and I have already found a software dev job?

I suspect (and hope) that it's answer b. That would make more sense to me as it's a "new coder survey".

However, there is also a BootcampFullJobAfter variable which indicates whether the individual managed to get a job post boot camp. Unfortunately that only applies to coders who have attended a boot camp.

If anyone could clarify I would be very greatful. I am trying to determine what factors in the data set lead to somebody managing to get employment in software development. I am building visualisations around that etc.

Seasons Greetings by the way :)

Thanks,
John.
The quantiles of **ExpectedEarning** for India are something like this:

| 0%     | 25%     | 50%     | 75%     | 100%     |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| 6000.0 | 13811.5 | 35500.0 | 70000.0 | 200000.0 |

35,500 dollars is **Rs 2,369,090**, this is an insanely high figure for India.

PS the data for **United States Of America** seems to pretty legible hence I have raised this issue to get more clarity
i was lead here by this article
https://medium.freecodecamp.com/we-asked-15-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-4104e29b2781#.6l0lg4dng

i have completed the front end dev cert and am finding it difficult landing a job in my location (charlotte, nc) so i would also like to see what states / cities are hiring the most code campers and if minorities are finding it more challenging across the country. thanks!


Because I am a pessimist, I would like to cross/compare each question to get a neural on demographics to compare them to myself. thank you.
