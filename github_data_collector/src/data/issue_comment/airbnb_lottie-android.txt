at version 3.3.1 ,I use LottieAnimationView to playAnimation in ListViewAdapter, but found it cannot play.Then I traced the source code and found that it is because in the latest version of playAnimation there is a condition that isShown() must be true, but in the items in listView, the isShown() of all views is false, so there is no method called

I faced with growing memory consumption like it was described here #1141 #746 
Lg G5 with Android 6.0.1
Lottie version 3.0.7, 3.3.1
Sony xz2 Compact with Android 9.0 - everything is fine
I have render bug on some animations, its looks like black silhouette. 
lottie lib version 3.3.1 
tested on various android devices version 6, 8, 9 and 10.

sample json files:
[QtPonies2.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/4039967/QtPonies2.zip)

**Checklist**
1. I think this animations doesn't use any unsupported features because this animations shows properly on telegram. and the site [lottiefiles.com/preview/telegram](lottiefiles.com/preview/telegram) says me that _Your Sticker meets all Telegram Sticker Requirements_
2. I dont know what part of my animation doesn't work.
4. I have no sources AEP files

Only what I know is that this animations generated automatically from gif files by some python library and this json files have big size (around 1mb)
I know several telegram stickersets that are have render bug with this library

Lottie version: 3.3.0,
Android version: tested on all versions since 5.1,
Aep files: 
[animation1.aep.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/3930802/S3-fishconvo.aep.zip)
[animation2.aep.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/3930803/Value.Prop.aep.zip)

Animation is not fully displayed on android devices but on iOs and online preview the same animation works greate. This is expected [animation1](https://lottiefiles.com/share/OQGVmB), [animation2](https://lottiefiles.com/share/2coWAu) but on android it looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/jLX0Csf.png).

Thanks in advance!


**Describe the bug**
I have project, a mobile app for which I recently created a download screen animation. In ios everything works as it should, and in android there were problems with one of the elements of animation.

The animation contains a pattern that should be smoothly shaded in blue. All design consists of a pattern and a blue circle, the pattern is a mask for a circle, the circle increases from 0% to 100% for several seconds and this blue pattern has to be visible until the end of animation. The pattern I drew in Illustrator and exported to after effects, there created a blue circle for which the pattern made a mask. As a result, after exporting the json file, the pattern begins to paint blue and is interrupted on the middle of the animation, just disappearing.

For the experiment I created arbitrary figures and red circle, arbitrary figures I made mask for red circle and after rendering these figures are painted red as I need to.

In animation, I used Alpha Matte to create a mask. I checked supported features, Alpha Matte is supported. I think the problem is the pattern, but I don 't know what 's wrong with it, please tell me. In all animation I have 2 such patterns, this one works quite badly, and the other little. Help us find a solution.

The question is why does the pattern disappear on half the animation, and the arbitrary figures drawn in after effects work normally?!

I attached the file source after effects, json file and video as the animation should work and how it works on android (samsung galaxy s8).

Please respond as soon as possible because in a few days launch the application in the play market. Thank you.

This has been happening for a little while for us apparently, but we don't get crash logs reported from it since the crash seems to be occurring in native code. It happens on the latest version of Lottie (3.3.0) and previous ones.

We have an [an animation](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/3923770/pinning_animation.json.zip) that causes our app to crash whenever we play it forward or backward. It only crashes on devices running 7.0 (pre-7.0 and post-7.0, including 7.x.x are fine). Here's what I'm seeing in the Logcat:

```

```
I've reproduced the issue by starting a new empty project that only has a LottieAnimationView.

Here's the layout:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<FrameLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context=".MainActivity">

    <com.airbnb.lottie.LottieAnimationView
        android:id="@+id/pin_button"
        android:layout_width="48dp"
        android:layout_height="48dp"
        android:layout_gravity="center"
        app:lottie_fileName="pinning_animation.json" />

</FrameLayout>
```
And here's the Activity:
```
package com.transloc.lottietest

import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import android.os.Bundle
import com.airbnb.lottie.LottieAnimationView
import com.airbnb.lottie.RenderMode

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        val pinButton = findViewById<LottieAnimationView>(R.id.pin_button)

        pinButton.setOnClickListener {
            pinButton.resumeAnimation()
        }
    }
}
```
The animation will play briefly, then the app will freeze momentarily, and then it will crash. I've found that setting the render mode to SOFTWARE will work around the issue.

I created an animated trim path on the left side but after rendering it turns out on the right side. Could you help to resolve this?
