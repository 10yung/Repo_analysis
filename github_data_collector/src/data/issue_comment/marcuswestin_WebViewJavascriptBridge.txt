When i use WKWebViewJavascriptBridge call js method from iOS like this:
```
[self.bridge callHandler:@"notExistJsMethod" data:nil responseCallback:^(id responseData) {
        //can not get any response here
 }];
```
If sometimes the js method does not exist, i can not get any callback to know there is something wrong. If I can get feedback, I can do some default processing.

WebViewJavascriptBridge is a great library.
But when I using, I was curious that why not automatically inject JSFile, but match a specific Request URL?
If View instance A need a webview with JSBridge, automatically injection should be more convenient.

Removing `UIWebView` support from this library, since Apple is now warning developers of the usage of the `UIWebView` APIs when submitting apps to the App Store for review.   

1. Removed `UIWebView` support from the code, and the tests
 2. Kept the `WebView` macOS support, as I don't think that has been targetted by Apple yet.
 3. Updated the `README.md` file to remove any `UIWebView` references.
 4. Update the `podspec` (version number, and description)

We are under the impression that since ht e`UIWebView` warning is being shown to all apps being submitted to Apple, that it's just a matter of time before iOS apps will not be allowed to ship with this code.  This will help eliminate that possibility.  If a user needs `UIWebView` support, they can always use the 6.x version of the library.

Thanks for taking a look at this patch @marcuswestin!

I downloaded ExampleSwiftApp-iOS sample, installed pod...but the sample does not work...it seems to be missing the WebView and the related code...

Did I missed something ?

Can you Help?

Thanks
UIWebView is deprecated with Apple, can give not contain UIWebView API
Hi There:
    I'm currently migrating a swift software to a cross-platform Qt5 software. I found that the software use this project. Is there a possible way to use WVJS on qt5? Or maybe there is a WVJB for qt5?
