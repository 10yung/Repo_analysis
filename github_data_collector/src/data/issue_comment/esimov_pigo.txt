Hello, I had a bug when I execute demo. It's nothing bad ;) .

github.com/esimov/pigo/examples/facedet #Â python2 demo.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "demo.py", line 66, in <module>
    cv2.circle(frame, (int(det[1]), int(det[0])), int(det[2]/2.0), (0, 0, 255), 2)
OverflowError: signed integer is greater than maximum

I was wondering why `func Unpack() (*Pigo, error)` needs to be a method of the struct `Pigo` if that struct is never used inside the method. I think making `Unpack()` a method of the package, instead of the struct, would have less overhead when initializing the classifier.

What do you think?
The number of faces in this image should be 4 rectangles, so why get -out file is 3 rectangles (-iou 0.1 or -iou 0.2)
