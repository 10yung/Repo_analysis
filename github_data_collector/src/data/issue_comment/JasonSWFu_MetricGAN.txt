it is operate on TF domain right?
when I run ./MetricGAN.py, I get some number (maybe loss) and error, just like this:
How do I fix this error? which cuda & cudnn versions did you use? (The keras, librosa, python versions are exactly same with yours)

Hi, thanks for sharing your great work! could you elaborate on the numbers that are not listed here? I wanna exactly compare which model performs the best. Thanks!

能提供一下你们的评价指标代码吗，为什么有些我测的有些指标跟论文不一致
这个工作里志杰构造了STOI和PESQ loss 不需要用一个GAN去approximate
