When I enabled the plex docker image, for a long time I was mystified why my server was invisible to plex clients, even when connecting to the server on port 32400

Turns out you need to issue some commands to register your server with plex itself. This is summarized here https://forums.plex.tv/t/plex-cant-find-my-server-help/274370/7 and someone provided a script to do this.

For me the sequence of commands (run inside the plex container using Portainer) worked and now my plex server is working beautifully:

```
# download the script
curl -L -o plex-claim-server.sh https://github.com/uglymagoo/plex-claim-server/raw/master/plex-claim-server.sh
# make the script executable
chmod +x plex-claim-server.sh
# go to https://www.plex.tv/claim/ in your browser and get the claim token and replace PLEX_CLAIM with this token in the next command, please use use the double quotes around your claim token
./plex-claim-server.sh "PLEX_CLAIM"
```

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Some kind of note in the documentation that this needs to be done else the plex server won't be functional.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
None so far, but I'm a plex newbie.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
Add/Enable Avahi daemon in order to broadcast hostname for mDNS resolution.
mDNS-compatible computers will be able to resolve the NAS address through `<hostname>.local`.

It also enable autodiscovery of Samba shares by other computers on the same network.

**Any other useful info**:
More information on ArchLinux's wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Avahi
Vagrant tests are now using the same file structure as regular ansible targets. This way, vagrant tests can act as documentation. It also simplify customized deployements in Vangrant by avoiding modifying all.yml.


Over the next few weeks, once #188, #201 and #203 are merged I'm going to make a start on adding some new containers to ansible-nas. I'm going to leave a list here of the potential ones I might be working on and would like other suggestions (if you don't want to raise your own issue for it) or shout outs so I can prioritise if you see something you want done sooner than others.

I'm well aware that a lot of these images I'll potentially be adding are either quite similar softwares (several wiki type images, photo gallery images, etc.) or alternatives for images we already have (like adding qbitorrent even though we have transmission). I feel that ansible-nas would have more global appeal if the software stack were more flexible for first time users. 

For reference, I've marked the ones I intend to work on sooner as "(high priority)". If there are requests for particular images I'll try to prioritise those too. Once completed and submitted as a PR, I'll edit this and strikethrough the entry.

**Linuxserver Images**: These are some of the best tested, easiest to use and most stable images on dockerhub. I'll be aiming to add the majority of them:

OK, so this is my current list of what I think is useful software that's available in mostly popular (therefore well tested) images. I can't guarantee that just because I listed it, I can make it work. Some of these are reliant at the moment on docker-compose (which slightly defeats the object of ansible) and I'm unsure whether I'm happier to rewrite the docker-compose files into ansible and attempt to maintain them against the upstream versions or whether it would be simpler to use an ansible task to envoke the docker-compose. There may also be configuration issues, stability issues, or other unforeseen issues with any of these images... So no promises!

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Hello

As I'm understanding the purpose of Heimdall, it is to provide a rich integration of supported applications running on the server, and proposing an easy way to access without having to remember all the ports. In this vision, I find it strange that I have to remind myself the correct port to access the dashboard and ofter have to peek in the ansible files to figure it out.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I wonder if Heimdall should be available on 80/443 ports by default. I'm sure there are reasons why it hasn't been done (is it security? port conflict?) but can't think of one that would be a major blocker. I'm certainly missing something!

With mDNS support activated, it makes it really conveniant to head to `https://my-ansible-nas` and get served by the Heimdall dashboard.

Thank you!

**What this PR does / why we need it**:



**Which issue (if any) this PR fixes**:

Fixes #

**Any other useful info**:

A little bit of tidying up. We shouldn't ever be using "XXX_root" in /tasks/*.yml

Tested in VM and working - ready to merge
Opening this as an issue since I don't have time to troubleshoot it at the moment.

Currently the ZNC docker fails with "unrecoverable config error"

I believe this is because we are missing the "docker run -it -v znc-cfg:/znc-data znc --makeconf" step. Potentially znc will need a template. 

https://hub.docker.com/_/znc

Fix #171 
As we are likely moving to a version of ansible-nas that should be much more updatable without needing to merge changes to the all.yml file manually, we should be in a position where we never need to edit the /tasks/*.yml files. I've needed to tweak some of the memory limit settings on the containers and being able to tweak the restart policies is very useful when you have a misbehaving container.
