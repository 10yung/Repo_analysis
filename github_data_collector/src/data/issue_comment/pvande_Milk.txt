Is `Milk` still being actively maintained?
The last commit has been 3 years ago.

The link on README.md to http://pvande.github.com/Milk/playground.html

is broken since it redirects to http://pvande.net/Milk/playground.html which is not working:

This example fails: http://bit.ly/oLz9vH 

According to the spec, any non-whitespace sequence of characters should be usable as a tag name.

As verified in the [playground](http://pvande.net/Milk/playground.html?data='!'%3A%20false&tmpl={{%23!}}%20This%20should%20not%20be%20seen.%20{{%2F!}}%0A), Milk's parser does not recognize certain valid names.  This also indicates a deficiency in the specs; that will be handled separately.
