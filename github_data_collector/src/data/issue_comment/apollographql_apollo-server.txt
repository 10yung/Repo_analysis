Apollo version: apollo-server-lambda@2.9.16

When using serverless with parameter `integration: lambda` the http method is modified to be named `method` where as without that parameter the http method is named `httpMethod`.
This cause the code here: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/1f279c1ed6cebf2203aa430294f4062e4317822b/packages/apollo-server-core/src/runHttpQuery.ts#L210-L238
to throw the error.

A possible fix is to check both `httpMethod` and `method` in https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/1f279c1ed6cebf2203aa430294f4062e4317822b/packages/apollo-server-core/src/runHttpQuery.ts#L210

A serverless.yml example is provided here:
``` 
functions:
  create:
    handler: posts.create
    events:
      - http:
          method: get
          path: whatever
          integration: lambda
```

Documentation on https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/deployment/lambda/ could be updated with a note on this.

First, 🌠 thank you 🌠 for taking the time to consider a contribution to Apollo!

Here are some important details to follow:

* ⏰ Your time is important
          To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will take more
          than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an issue first.
          This is especially true for feature requests!
* 💡 Features
          Feature requests can be created and discussed within a GitHub Issue.  Be
          sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!) prior to
          opening a new request.  If an existing issue covers the need, please upvote
          that issue by using the 👍 emote, rather than opening a new issue.
* 🔌 Integrations
          Apollo Server has many web-framework integrations including Express, Koa,
          Hapi and more.  When adding a new feature, or fixing a bug, please take a
          peak and see if other integrations are also affected.  In most cases, the
          fix can be applied to the other frameworks as well.  Please note that,
          since new web-frameworks have a high maintenance cost, pull-requests for
          new web-frameworks should be discussed with a project maintainer first.
* 🕷 Bug fixes
          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,
          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should
          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.
* 📖 Contribution guidelines
          Follow https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add
          tests for all new behavior.
* ✏️ Explain your pull request
          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your
          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide 🔗 links 🔗 to associated issues!

We hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.

Fixes #1419, #1703 file upload using lambda.
Based on original [PR #1739](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1739)

TODO:

- [x]  Update CHANGELOG.md with your change (include reference to issue & this PR)
- [x]  Make sure all of the significant new logic is covered by tests
- [x]  Rebase your changes on master so that they can be merged easily
- [x]  Make sure all tests and linter rules pass

After needing `graphql-upload` support in `apollo-server-lambda`, we (me and @smschick) found [PR #1739](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1739) that was created a while ago and never was updated after @abernix had some comments on the PR. The main thing that @abernix had mentioned was being sure that the file upload process was [happening in the right order](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1739/files#r288265931).

This PR takes those comments and some of the work from the original PR and hopefully solves the issue.  Thanks to @charleswong28 for his work on the orig PR.

Please let me know if there's anything you'd like to see. Currently all tests are passing which includes single and multiple file uploads.
(node:8379) Warning: The route option `beforeHandler` has been deprecated, use `preHandler` instead

I have attached a short explaining paragraph in order to avoid waist time looking for the different parts of the code in order to get an explanation.

This PR creates a duration histogram class that can be used during reporting to create summary statistics client-side instead of sending all the traces to the server. This will allow a smaller number of traces to be reported to Apollo.
