I'm frequently using Tinker to deal with classes from a package, but the aliasing doesn't happen for classes within `vendor`.

How about config array that whitelists some classes (and/or namespaces).

```
'alias' => [
   'Statamic\Entries\Entry',
]
```

I'm happy to PR this myself, but just wanted to ask before doing so.
