Because now I am working on a iOS project written in pure swift, I like JLRoutes, so I translate it to Swift 5, all usage is the same as JLRoutes

See issue: https://github.com/joeldev/JLRoutes/issues/115

If this repo ist still maintained, feel free to merge ;)
The pattern matching breaks, when I register a route with a trailing slash (`/myapp/search/`).
It seems, that the reason are the different implementations dealing with slashes:

Trailing and leading slashes are removed:
https://github.com/joeldev/JLRoutes/blob/master/JLRoutes/Classes/JLRRouteRequest.m#L80

Only the trailing slash is removed:
https://github.com/joeldev/JLRoutes/blob/master/JLRoutes/Classes/JLRRouteDefinition.m#L40

Therefor the patterns don't matchâ€¦

Can I pass objects directly when passing parameters inside the app?
If you pass `""` as a pattern (which has been working blissfully for years) the route definition will blow up under xocde 10 beta 6 with a range out of bounds exception.
After updating from release 2.0.6 to 2.1 using Carthage my project has several JLRoutes related warnings:
