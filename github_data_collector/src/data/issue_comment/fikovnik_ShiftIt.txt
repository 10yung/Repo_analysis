When I press the "Left" or "Right" shortcuts on the latest binary build (1.6.6), it snaps / resizes to 1/2 of the screen on the left or right side respectively. However, it no longer cycles through 1/3 and 2/3 screen size options.

I am noticing this behavior on Macbook Pro 15 Inch (2016) and iMac (2014) on both macOS Mojave and Catalina. 

I try to move application with hotkeys, in log file I read:

No applications is in fullscreen!

Thanks
**Problem:**
ShiftIt work perfectly for all apps' windows except for "Google Chrome.app". Chrome windows just don't respond at all.

**System:**
MacBook Pro 15" Late 2016 model with Touchbar
macOS 10.14.3
ShiftIt 2.3
Google Chrome 72.0.3626.121

**Attempts to solve:**
+ I've tried using both the hotkey activation and the SiftIt menu bar dropdown. Both work for other apps but not for Chrome. 
+ I've trying to find any hotkeys in Chrome that might be overriding ShiftIt, but haven't found any. Perhaps I don't know where to look.
+ I've also tried searching online, both in these Github issues and generally across the internet, for anyone else with the same problem and found none.
+ I tried using different combinations of external keyboard and monitor to no avail.

Thanks in advance for any help and thanks making for this awesome app! =)
Here is what has happened. Some time ago I got my macbook stolen (from a hotel room in Vienna?!?). While I was waiting for a replacement (it is a long process at the university where I work), I got  temporary replacement, a dell with linux. While it was kind of hard at the beginning, after some time I started to like it. Recently, I got my hands on a new macbook pro and I realized that I don't want to use it anymore (I was constantly hitting the esc key on the touchbar, the keyboard was weird and it felt slow comparing to the dell I had despite the same spec).

Since I no longer use OSX, I will not continue working on Shifit. If there is somebody (@rca, @aegamesi, @vitalibozhko, @llouim, @derekwyatt for example) who would like to maintain it I would be very happy.
ShiftIt solves 99% of my windowing needs, but I still keep Moom around for one thing, making an app 'almost' fullscreen, meaning it takes up 90% of the screen with padding on each side. I like to do this with some apps because then I can easily click over to the apps behind it. I'm not sure what you would call this, but if there was an option for this it would make ShiftIt _perfect_ to me.

Here's what the setting looks like in Moom:

On a laptop, parking applications often leaves them too small.  I'd like an option to park left or right, but at 66% of my screen width.  

Could you create an option to park applications with custom dimensions, i.e.: left: 0, top: 0, right: 20%, bottom: 0.

Fantastic app!!
Sometimes the ShiftIt hotkey recorder gets confused, and won't let me assign a new hotkey combination unless I clear out all the olds ones and relaunch the app.
