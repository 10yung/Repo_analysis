I found this out the hard way when I realized my system clock was faster by an hour than the actual time, I changed my clock back an hour in timedate.cpl and started typing in etherpad, later on realized stuff I typed up didn't save when I went back to the etherpad. This being cloud etherpad at first I thought there was something wrong with the server, but had a suspicion that reverting time was the culprit. I created a local instance of etherpad on my own box, using vmware workstation etc, and lo and behold, when I reverted my client clock back an hour, and then did some more typing, then closed out of browser session, rebooted the client (not the etherpad server), then launched the etherpad in the browser again, all work that happened after the clock was reversed back an hour was LOST! 

Is there a way to retrieve or recover this if I have access to the etherpad server itself? (windows server, mysql, etc) 

Hello,

I'm trying to embed a beta.etherpad.org page onto a personal website. While it does load on Chrome, it doesn't seem to load / open on Safari. 

The following is an error pop-up on Safari:

> "Warning: it appears that your browser does not have cookies enabled. EtherPad uses cookies to keep track of unique users for the purpose of putting a quota on the number of active users.  Using EtherPad without  cookies may fill up your server's user quota faster than expected."

The embed block shows this:

> "An error occurred

Would appreciate any help! 

Thank you.

Running etherpad for ages, tried an update from 1.6.3 to 1.8 master, upgraded node from v6.17.1 to v12.14.0 LTS, updated dependencies with `bin/run.sh` - getting the same error - even after a fresh install (with existing DB):

```

Reverted back to EP 1.6.3, keeping node v12.14.0, works fine.
13d9e86be16b (part of #3677) introduced a useful feature (running a simplified version of backend tests in CI via Docker), but in doing so copied & modified & pasted two files. See https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/pull/3677#issuecomment-568810560:

- backend/loadSettings.js container/loadSettings.js
- backend/specs/api/pad.js container/specs/api/pad.js

This was very useful to get the feature out, but now it would be better to unify the spec files.

A possible idea could be pass some parameters at runtime, so that `npm test` and `npm test-container` end up calling the same script with just different command line parameters.

Any idea on how to achieve this?

#217 Etherpad should track changes against original document. It should not track changes only for the latest version. Deletion of content should be marked by strikethrough option.


Hey folks. 
So I managed to install node.js v11.15.0. (Newer versions not working on shared hosting)

I managed to install it with changes in settings.json and start it in my ssh. But I can't figure out how to access it. Is it because I have a shared IP and its not allowing me to access port 9001 on it?

I am new to coding and basically working this through reading forums. Here is the readout from my execution.

There's the problem because I access the etherpad of someone's project from different PCs (sometimes at home, sometimes at work, sometimes when I'm visiting friends...) and every time I have to set my author color again when I want to contribute to that etherpad. I know the approximate hue of color that I want, but it's very hard to get the exact same color again with that color circle thing; would it be possible to let me simply enter the RGB value of my desired color so I'd be able to get the exact same color again? Keep the inexact color circle thing but also have RGB value boxes that allow an exact selection? That would be great :-)
## Introduction

I have `ep_hash_auth` installed.

The current `settings.json.template` explicitly states:
```
...
   * WARNING: passwords should not be stored in plaintext in this file.
   *          If you want to mitigate this, please install ep_hash_auth and
   *          follow the section "secure your installation" in README.md
   */

  /*
  "users": {
    "admin": {
      // 1) "password" can be replaced with "hash" if you install ep_hash_auth
      // 2) please note that if password is null, the user will not be created
      "password": "changeme1",
      "is_admin": true
    },
...
```

## Setup 1

`settings.json` looks like:

```
  "users": {
    "admin": {
      "hash": "{{ etherpad_admin_password_hash }}",
      "is_admin": true
    }
  },
```

Log output:

```
[2019-12-09 17:44:06.270] [WARN] console - Removing user "admin", because it has no "password" field.
...
[2019-12-09 17:44:10.252] [WARN] console - Admin username and password not set in settings.json.  To access admin please uncomment and edit 'users' in settings.json
```

Cannot login with the hashed password.

## Setup 2

`settings.json` looks like:

```
  "users": {
    "admin": {
      "hash": "{{ etherpad_admin_password_hash }}",
      "password": "plaintext_password",
      "is_admin": true
    }
  },
```

Log output contains nothing suspect.

Can login with the hashed password as well as with the plaintext password.

## Setup 3 (Workaround)

`settings.json` looks like:

```
  "users": {
    "admin": {
      "hash": "{{ etherpad_admin_password_hash }}",
      "password": 0,
      "is_admin": true
    }
  },
```

Log output contains nothing suspect.

Can login with the hashed password but not with a plaintext password.

## Conclusion

Password authentication code is buggy. The easiest solution would probably be to not remove users from the config if they have an attribute `hash`. However, is the behaviour under setup 2 desired?
