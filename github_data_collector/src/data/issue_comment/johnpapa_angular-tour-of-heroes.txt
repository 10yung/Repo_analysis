I'm working on Microsoft SQL Server and I want to create Angular demo app that shows how to implement it end-to-end solution using real backend (.Net) and database (SQL Server). Current version is here: https://github.com/JocaPC/sql-server-samples/tree/angular-tour-of-heroes/src/ 

I have used this code as front-end, I have created back-end/database, and everything is working fine.

However, the problem is that I had to do few source code changes to make it work, and it would be nicer if these are some config values that can be changed instead of chaining the code. The changes that I made are:
1. Add the backendUri in environment config: https://github.com/JocaPC/sql-server-samples/blob/angular-tour-of-heroes/src/frontend/src/environments/environment.ts#L8
2. Change the backend URL in the code: https://github.com/JocaPC/sql-server-samples/blob/angular-tour-of-heroes/src/frontend/src/app/hero.service.ts#L11
3. Change the backend URL in search service https://github.com/JocaPC/sql-server-samples/blob/angular-tour-of-heroes/src/frontend/src/app/hero-search.service.ts#L15
4. Disable in-memory data source here: https://github.com/JocaPC/sql-server-samples/blob/angular-tour-of-heroes/src/frontend/src/app/app.module.ts#L24

It works for me but it would be good if the backend URL is placed in the config in your code too because I believe that other people will like to do the same. Also, it would be good do if we could disable InMemoryDataService without changing the code. Ideally this could be some property that could be changed if I deploy the app in Azure Web Apps.

If you know have some better way to re-configure this sample to work with some backend, could you point me to some instruction in docs? Otherwise what do you think about adding this in your code? I can send the PR for backendUri if you agree, but I'm not sure what would be the best way to disable InMemoryDataSource.
I want to push an array comment in to cabin.comments array and after UPDATE of the cabin array with the new comment in it when the user submits a comment using the onSubmit() and update the cabin with the updateCabin.
In the console when running "ng serve --open" I am getting an error: 

error TS1128: Declaration or statement expect

I am using a JSON database in the main folder.  
I am really new to angular and I am lost.

This is my component file with my onSubmit


		  
	 
	  onSubmit(id) {
		  
			this.cabin.comments.push(this.comment);
		 this.cabinService.updatePosts(this.cabin.id);
	  	  
		this.commentForm.reset({
			author: '',
			rating: 5,
			comment: ''
		});
	  }



My cabinService

	 updatePosts(id){
	 const data={"cabin": "Cabin"};
	 return this.http.get<{cabin: Cabin}>('http://localhost:3000/cabins/'+id).pipe(
	  map(cabin=>{
		console.log(cabin);


		 return{
			   description: cabin.description,
			   featured: cabin.featured,
			   comments: cabin.comments

			 };


		 })
		).subscribe(updatedEntries=>{
				console.log(updatedEntries);

		  updatedEntries.comments.push(data);
		  return this.http.put('http://localhost:3000/cabins/' +id, updatedEntries);

		console.log(updatedEntries);

	});


My JSON database

		  "cabins": [
			{
			  "id": 0,
			  "description": "Tucked away on the hillside among lush gardens of banana & citrus trees",
			  "featured": "true",
			  "comments": [
				{
				  "rating": 5,
				  "comment": "Beautiful place!",
				  "author": "John Gomez",
				  "date": "2018-10-16T17:57:28.556094Z"
				},
				{
				  "rating": 4,
				  "comment": "Amazing!",
				  "author": "Paul Villar",
				  "date": "2017-09-05T17:57:28.556094Z"
				}
			  ]
			}
          ]


    


I uploaded angular-tour-of-heroes to a s3 bucket (http://angular-seo-test.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com). The upload works and it seems like the app otherwise works.

However, when I try to look at it in google search console, it seems like the app doesn't work correctly. In particular, it seems like anything displayed by the router doesn't work.

Note that I'm getting a similar problem when I try to use this with my own site. This means that it seems like googlebot cannot properly traverse the angular site. This is a big deal for Angular SEO. If googlebot cannot properly handle Angular apps, then these apps will not show up in search results correctly.
