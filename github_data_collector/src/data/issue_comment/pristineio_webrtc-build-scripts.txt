I have no idea to how to fix it  in this project .
Cloud someone help me to fix this 
Tks. 
I want to compile an android version but encounter some problems when executing `build_apprtc`.

Here is the outcome:
```
Setting up build environment for Android
Export the base settings of GYP_DEFINES so we can define how we want to build

Build AppRTCMobile in Release (arch: armv7)

```
I have tried to `sudo apt install ninja ninja-build` but it doesn't work.

After I build webrtc, libjingle_peerconnection_java.jar include only one java class(its name Empty.class). Why is it becomming empty ? I followed the steps below and I didn't get any errors. I use Ubuntu.

1.source android/build.sh
2.install_dependencies
3.get_webrtc
4.export WEBRTC_DEBUG=true
5.export WEBRTC_ARCH=armv7
6.prepare_gyp_defines &&
execute_build



Hello,

First, thank you for your effort in providing the build scripts and are really very helpful. 

I tried to build WebRTC libraries for "armv8" and "x86_64" platforms. I noticed that some files are generating and some files are not generating.

**Below files are generating:**
libjingle_peerconnection_so.so
audio_device_java.jar
base_java.jar
libjingle_peerconnection.jar

**Below files are not generating:**
libboringssl.cr.so
libc++_shared.so
libprotobuf_lite.cr.so
libbase.cr.so

**Console Log:** https://pastebin.com/HH8a6ezL

Please suggest me what I am missing? Am I missing any dependencies? I installed BoringSSL library and tried again. But, even though, the above files are not generating.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Chandramouli.
Hello,

I am working on a streaming app of screen sharing. To share my screen, I am getting continuously the video stream into CVPixelBuffer format.
I want to adapt my video source to take my CVPixelBuffer variable instead of my local video device.

Does someone know how to custom the video source please?

Thanks,
Eric.
Hi,
can I still use these scripts if I need to build an old revision (13311) of the  webrtc library for iOS?

Thanks
When I run a compiled Apk on my Android phone, it's wrong

Please change build.sh files, commands from GYP to GN, for future building of webrtc ios ,
i am facing a lot of problems and hurdels in building webrtc ios ,

Due to GYP  i am  getting the following errors

Running ninja
ninja: Entering directory `out_ios_x86_64/Release-iphonesimulator/'
ninja: fatal: chdir to 'out_ios_x86_64/Release-iphonesimulator/' - No such file or directory
I'm try build the libjingle_peerconnection(Android) by my self 
it's ok to build, but I can't see the VideoCapturerAndroid & VideoRendererGUI class 
Something wrong in here? How should I do can build them?
thank you.
I am trying to create a local media stream in my iOS webRTC app. See code below

```
let localStream = pcFactory.mediaStream(withLabel: "ARDAMS")!

let audio = pcFactory.audioTrack(withID: "ARDAMSa0")
localStream.addAudioTrack(audio!)

var device: AVCaptureDevice?
for captureDevice in AVCaptureDevice.devices(withMediaType: AVMediaTypeVideo){
    if let captureDevice = captureDevice as? AVCaptureDevice{
        if captureDevice.position == AVCaptureDevicePosition.front{
            device = captureDevice
        }
    }
}

if let device = device{
    let capture = RTCVideoCapturer(deviceName: device.localizedName)
    let videoSource = pcFactory.videoSource(with: capture, constraints: nil)
    localVideoTrack = pcFactory.videoTrack(withID: "ARDAMSv0", source: videoSource)
    localStream.addVideoTrack(localVideoTrack)
}


self.peerConnection?.add(localStream)

localVideoTrack?.add(localVideoView)
```

Everything works, but when after I add the localVideoView to the localVideoTrack I get an error:

```
-[RTCI420Frame nativeHandle]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x170010620

*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[RTCI420Frame nativeHandle]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x170010620'
```

All of the code is running on the main thread and the app has the appropriate permissions and plist keys. When I walk through the code line by line using the debugger everything seems to be running correctly. This code was taken from the Obj-C AppRTC demo, it has just been converted to swift. I can't seem to find the difference between my swift project that crashes and the working AppRTC project. Any idea what I am doing wrong? I am testing on a 64 bit device. Thanks!
