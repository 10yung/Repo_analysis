Should get an expected value of 22 when execute `deploy stage`
but config_get port equals 29

use this deploy.conf
```
[stage]

[production]
port 29
```


able to install via npm.

Hi guys,

Is possible to execute on Windows?

Regards

check if env is given first before doing config_section test

Added `mkconfig` command.

```
deploy mkconfig stage \
  --user visionmedia \
  --host server-ip-address.com \
  --repo git@github.com/visionmedia/deploy.git \
  --path /home/deploy \
  --ref origin/master \
  --post-deploy ./bin/post-deploy

[stage]
user=visionmedia
host=server-ip-address.com
repo=git@github.com/visionmedia/deploy.git
path=/home/deploy
ref=origin/master
post_deploy=./bin/post-deploy
```

An alternative to #32 , this is a separate script which runs deploy on multiple environments in your configuration

Runs `deploy` on multiple configurations which are grouped by a cluster name
like `[Group1:AppA]` and `[Group1:AppB]`

Running `deploy-cluster Group1` will run `deploy` on both `[Group1:AppA]` and `[Group1:AppB]`

Runs `deploy` on multiple configurations which are grouped by a group name
like `[Group1:AppA]` and `[Group1:AppB]`

Running `deploy Group1:*` will run `deploy` on both `[Group1:AppA]` and `[Group1:AppB]`

host should accept an array of addresses

You might want to add to the documentation which security implications there are when forwarding the ssh-agent session to a server.

I am getting a "{shared" folder when I deploy (alongside "source" and "current")
