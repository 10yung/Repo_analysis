Trying to install the baseballr package using the following code:

devtools::install_github("BillPetti/baseballr")

I keep gettting an error saying "Error: Failed to install 'baseballr' from GitHub:
  (converted from warning) cannot remove prior installation of package ‘digest’"

I've tried several different times and each time I get the same error with the only difference being the name of the package that can't be removed. Is there any way to fix or work around this? My apologies if this is a simple question as I am a fairly new user of R
Hi Bill - I'm very new to R so I'm sure this is an issue somewhere on my end. I am trying to download the files and it looks like they aren't being fully processed by the Chadwick tools. I can see the Retrosheet files saved on my computer and it creates the all2019.csv but it's empty. Is it an issue with with the Chadwick files or is there a step I missed with installing your package? The other functions in your readme like teamconsistency are working so I'm a little lost on where I went wrong.

Introducing a new function to retrieve players by birthplace from Baseball-Reference.
Adding new visualization functions to:

- Visualize Run Differentials within a season
- Visualize Standings timeline (Game Behind & Winning Percentage) within a date period in a season
Hey @BillPetti, 

I've noticed a lot of the issues raised here are related to install / the package not being updated on CRAN. Is there a technical reason why it hasn't been updated, or just lack of time? If so, I could put together a PR to align the code base with CRAN policies
Is it possible to add a playid field for the daily_batter_bref and daily_pitcher_bref functions.  Or is it possible to match the names to MLBID data?
Hey Bill,

Just discovered this package, truly awesome stuff. Curious if there's any way (or if it's possible to add?) to query batter and pitcher splits vs righties and lefties? 

Thanks!
Hi there!

First off, I'm a bit of an R novice. I don't know how devtools or the inner workings of R functions work. that being said, I ran into an error using the viz_gb_on_period function.

code:
viz_gb_on_period("2018-03-29", "2018-04-05", "NL West")

error:
Error in mutate_impl(.data, dots) : 
  Column `x` is of unsupported type quoted call

Currently using R 3.5.1, latest baseballr version. Can provide more details (if provided the function to run to get them).
I think it is unnecessary. I think it would be cleaner to just define `geom_baseball_field()` and let people use the existing `ggplot2` functionality. 

Maybe I will add this to my pull request...
This is an enhancement I'd like to contribute to create a function, similar to `viz_gb_on_period` but, to visualize the timeline of the winning-losing percentage of MLB teams on a specific period in the season.
