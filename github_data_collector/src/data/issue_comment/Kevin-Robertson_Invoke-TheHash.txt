Hey,
when using TheHash, the sleep function doesn't seem to work, there is zero delay between access attempts.

thank you!
Hello Kevin,
I was looking your SMBExec code and I realize that you have constant offset(1002) at WriteAndX part. I am cofused about it. I think it is about svcctl pipe but I don't know the reason.
Can you explain the reason?

Hi Kevin,

Thanks for sharing your fantastic work. Been testing it successfully in my own lab environment, it's amazing.

I was wondering if there's any chance that your tools can be extended/modified to simply map a network share on a server that is not a Windows one, but still uses Windows domain credentials and SMB/NTLM authentication, typically a SAMBA server integrated to ActiveDirectory.

Thanks,
Regards,
Arno
