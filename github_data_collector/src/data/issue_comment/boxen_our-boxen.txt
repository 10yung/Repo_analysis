- Support ruby 2.0 with new openssl
- Ruby 2.0 is not installed osx container (ruby 2.4 or above)

Tracking branch to merge intermediate branches into whilst we get High Sierra support going.
Updates brewcask to include a fix for correctly uninstalling formulas due
inconsistencies between `brew uninstall` and `brew cask uninstall`.

Also included in this PR is a fix for some issues with `librarian-puppet`
that I have been hitting since updating to git 2.14.1.
Bumps all the available gems to their latest version.
2FA accounts are unable to log in when running `script/server`:

```
our-boxen andre$ script/boxen
--> Preparing to auto-update...
--> Complete! Nothing new from upstream.
--> Oh, looks like you've provided your login as environmental variable...

GitHub password: **********

--> It looks like you have two-factor auth enabled.

One time password (via SMS or device):
******

--> That one time password didn't work. Let's try again.

```

Repeat until you get tired and give up. It's an infinite loop.

(Yes, I'm 100% sure my password and token are correct, and I used them to log in to GitHub.com moments before using them in Boxen.)
In https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen/blob/master/facts.d/example.yaml, one could set the default ``homebrew_root`` folder. 

Since 1.0.0, homebrew now migrates the ``HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY`` when you run ``brew update``. 

Running ``boxen`` after a ``brew update`` reinstalls all packages.

anyone having this issue ?
Reproduction steps:
1. `ssh localhost`
2. `cd ~/src/bundler/bundler`
3. `git remote update`

What happens:

```
$ git remote update
Boxen Keychain Helper: Encountered error code: -25308
Error: User interaction is not allowed.
Boxen Keychain Helper: Encountered error code: -25308
Error: User interaction is not allowed.
remote: Anonymous access to bundler/bundler.git denied.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/bundler/bundler.git/'
```

While user interaction may not be allowed, the keychain is unlocked, and `security find-internet-password` works perfectly fine even inside the `ssh localhost`.

What I expected to happen (and what does happen in a local terminal window, with no GUI prompts):

```
$ git remote update
etching origin
