some protector ( example vmp ) use win32 program to dynamic execute .net code .
so we should use dnspy to debug or dump .net code in this case ,but dnspy antidebug is not strong!
ERROR with disabled profile when loading any EXE file to odbg110
OS: WIN7 X32

the default one doesn't really work. thanks
Hi,

I am fairly new to reversing so I am sorry for the dumb questions that I am about to ask.

I am trying to reverse this program which has IsDebuggerPresent and CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent to protect against debugging. I used the x32dbg and found that using the Obsidium profile will allow me to run the program without it picking up x32dbg. Now my main goal is to use ScyllaHide with other debugging software such as "Mega Dumper", "Smart assembly explorer", "dnSpy", and "fiddler". 

I have looked through the manual so I did use the InjectorCLIx86.exe program to attach the HookLibraryx86.dll file onto the program I am trying to crack. However, this only allows me to open x32dbg debugger and all of the other debuggers I would like to use is still detected by the program.

If anyone could shed some light on what I am doing wrong or how I can fix this it is appreciated!
Hi, I do not know where to turn for help, so I am writing here.
A lot of time I can not run this application in debug mode.
This is openjdk which is protected from change, protected library jvm.dll.

PEiD has detected a low version of VMProtect, although this is most likely 3.3 ++
I have a lot of creakme version 3.2, and with them there are no problems, but with this version there.
Here is the link to the file "https://dropmefiles.com/Ntu1u"
I used dbg64, and plugins,ScyllaHide,TitanHide,SharpOD ver 0.6
Windows 10 has a separate implementation for [OutputDebugStringW](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/debugapi/nf-debugapi-outputdebugstringw) rather than passing the string to **OutputDebugStringA**, quoting their note:

> **Important**  In the past, the operating system did not output Unicode strings via **OutputDebugStringW** and instead only output ASCII strings. To force **OutputDebugStringW** to correctly output Unicode strings, debuggers are required to call **WaitForDebugEventEx** to opt into the new behavior. On calling **WaitForDebugEventEx**, the operating system will know that the debugger supports Unicode and is specifically opting into receiving Unicode strings.

The plugin (if I'm not mistaken) currently supports **OutputDebugStringA** only.
This article (by ntquery) talks about this:

[scylla_hide.log](https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide/files/2626661/scylla_hide.log)
 Some Nt* WINAPI functions are not exported by a DLL, so it is necessary to get the function addresses from another source. The other source is the PDB ﬁle. The adresses can be resolved with the NtApiTool packaged in the release. It will download the PDB ﬁle from the Microsoft server to resolve the missing function addresses.


Ok. I executed PDBReader*.exe where it was(in the NtApiTool folder) , I didn't move it in the x64dbg directory. And it created some folders with some .pdb in them. What should I do now?

I must admit that I am ashamed of myself right know :(

Please, help.

I get the error C0000005 after a dll call, before the installation of the plug in I was getting the error at the start of the Module ntdll.dll, now I get the error after the call of a proprietary dll. I tried most of the options but every time I get the same error in the same location
Hello,
According to https://bitbucket.org/NtQuery/scyllahide/downloads/ScyllaHide.pdf, I can use ScyllaHide to inject a DLL:

so does this means I can inject ANY dll into a process in a stealthy way even if it's not related to debugging? 
Hi, I use ScyllaTest_x86.exe and see that ScyllaHide OutputDebugStringA protection for OllyDbg 2.0 doesn't work.
