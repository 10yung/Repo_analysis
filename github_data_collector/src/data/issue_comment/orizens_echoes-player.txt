I like the overall UI / card look, but I have two suggestions.

1) Rehaul either the chosen font-family, or if you want to stick with it, increase the letter-spacing since basically everything feels crammed together.  

2) The link url color is too light, and make readability a little difficult (and more so combined with the compressed letters)

Perhaps this may not be the same for all users since there are fallback fonts, but here is how it looks on my computer (Chromium on Linux)

Hi, why you have deleted the routing from ngrx? I'm curious, because I start new project and I don't know what to choose.
This pull request adds backers and sponsors from your Open Collective https://opencollective.com/echoes-player ‚ù§Ô∏è
  
  It adds two badges at the top to show the latest number of backers and sponsors. It also adds placeholders so that the avatar/logo of new backers/sponsors can automatically be shown without having to update your README.md. [[more info](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/wiki/Github-banner)]. See how it looks on [this repo](https://github.com/apex/apex#backers).
We have also added a `postinstall` script to let people know after `npm|yarn install` that you are welcoming donations (optional). [[More info](https://github.com/OpenCollective/opencollective-cli)]
You can also add a "Donate" button to your website and automatically show your backers and sponsors there with our widgets. Have a look here: https://opencollective.com/widgets

  P.S: As with any pull request, feel free to comment or suggest changes. The only thing "required" are the placeholders on the README because we believe it's important to acknowledge the people in your community that are contributing (financially or with code!).
