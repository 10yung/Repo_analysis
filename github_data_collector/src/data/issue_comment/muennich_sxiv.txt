Be good if there was an option to undo the removal of images.

I feel quite close to an "undo" in my `~/.config/sxiv/exec/key-handler` but I am not sure where the original file location is to restore the file.

```
"C-d")      tmp=$(mktemp -d); while read file; do mv -vf $file $tmp/; done; rm /tmp/undosxiv; ln -sf $tmp /tmp/undosxiv ;;
"C-u")      mv -vf /tmp/undosxiv/* . ;;
```

I'm a bit puzzled how to toggle between the thumb sizes as well as make sure the thumbs take as much screen real estate as possible:

If an [APNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APNG) file is visualized, only the first frame is shown.

Are there any plans to support animating APNG?
Like the "-n" option, "-F" start from a file instead of its index.
I just didn't find using 'n' and 'p' for navigation so convenient so I thought why not have scrolling and navigation in one command. This also sets the navigation keys to that command by default.
Thanks for the coolest image view so far btw!
Hi, I am currently writing a little script to generate gifs out of images marked by sxiv. I am doing this using the key handler. ctrl+x ctrl+g will launch my script with the marked images passed to stdin.

I would like the images to be passed in the order that I marked them but it seems that they are always sent alphabetically. Is it possible to have them sent to the script in the order that they were selected?
I added support for viewing WebP image files using libwebp. Animation is implemented based on the existing GIF support. I have tested this with versions 0.5.2 and 1.0.2 of libwebp (the --enable-libwebpdemux configure option is required if building libwebp from source).
Getting an error while trying to attach sxiv instance via xembed to a suckless tabbed utility patched with the transparency patch (alpha.diff from 28 Feb 2017 available at https://tools.suckless.org/tabbed/patches/alpha/).

Error text:
> $ /usr/bin/sxiv -e 0x2800002 ~/Screenshot.png
> X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
>   Major opcode of failed request:  1 (X_CreateWindow)
>   Serial number of failed request:  26
>   Current serial number in output stream:  37

It happens at the 216 line in window.c:
> cursors[i].icon = XCreateFontCursor(e->dpy, cursors[i].name);

With non-patched tabbed instance everything is ok.
At the same time urxvt, surf and zathura do not have any issues with the patched version.

Is there any additional info I can provide to help with this? Or is it an issue with this tabbed patch? If so, would really appreciate any pointers on how I can make a workaround for it.
