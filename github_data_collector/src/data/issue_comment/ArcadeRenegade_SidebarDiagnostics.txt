Windows 10, Sidebar Diagnostics v3.5.3

This happens no matter which of my two displays I dock it to.

It only makes the desktop flash that the dock is on, though the dock itself always flashes.

It flashes at different rates. Sometimes once per second, sometimes around four times per second.

Not too sure

**4. Steps to Reproduce**
Change volume on a mouse with multimedia keys whilst the taskbar is hidden

Additional notes: I have a triple-monitor setup, I'm not sure if that may be apart of this probel as well or not.

This is about the strangest bug I've come across in any application ever. I have a gaming mouse (Ajazz AJ52) with additional buttons on the side that I've set to change the volume. If the taskbar is hidden and I change the volume via my mouse it will cause Sidebar Diagnostics to reload as well as the taskbar seems to (it might be restarting/crashing explorer.exe?). If the taskbar is visible the issue doesn't seem to occur.

Sometimes I have to scan to see my CPU temp, and then scan again to see GPU temp, because it's located on two different places (one is on second line, the other is on bottom). Not immediately noticeable.

Would be nice if we can sort which appears on which line.
ItÂ´s possible to add a result of ping to a IP our various IPS, and you can add it if you want...

This app is really cool and there are great feature requests here for additional info and stuff, but to be honest when I first saw the screenshot I though it was actually integrated into the notifications area of the Windows sidebar. So I though, that's clever!
That said, it may be to complicated or even not possible to do that, right? Just wanted to throw the idea. Thanks!
It would be very interesting if the program displayed the temperatures of HDD/SDD.

First of all Thank yo keep updating this software.

I got a Ryzen 5 1600x and it seem the ad roughly 15 Celsius on the TEMP Core on the sidebar. I try many other software and i idle like 32c and with your apps i'm a ~49c

Hope you can fix it !

Readings from the graphic card are non existent. This does seem to be common from all gadgets that I have tried since getting new card.

Any plans to update to look at this issue, as the sidebar look awesome.
