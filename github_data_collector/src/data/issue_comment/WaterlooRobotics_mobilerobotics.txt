 I was speaking with a classmate this evening who was having problems understanding what was going on in the measurement linearization function.  After an attempt to explain it using the magic of the Identity matrix, I realized the current solution was still overly complex.  

This version gets rid of the intermediate Fi matrix and directly inserts the linearized measurements into an Ht of the correct size.

I also took the opportunity to get rid of the extra copy of range_bearing_meas... and the '2' that was hanging around in ekf_slam.m
Causes issues in Windows OS due to lowercase filename (ekf.m) in the same directory

Note: The kept lowercase file is referenced by current examples and the removed uppercase file appears to be a modified remanent of the code v1.0 version with a different function signature
+prefers diagonal paths
This one you may or may not want to bother with.  The original file was using the measured robot's position instead of the robot's belief in updating its pose estimate.  Kinda takes the challenge out of it.

Then there are some minor code clean up bits to stop MATLAB from complaining.

Ok, trying this again -- the old 06-mapping/fastSLAM has been overwritten with the new files, and I've updated 01-examples_lecture/mr-6-fastSlam/fastSLAM.m to point to the new versions.
