I have a problem when setting it up. I moved the .m files to my path directory but had this error: 

```
Could not compile oneProjector.You can still use the slower ".m" version.Error using rethrow
Input must be a structure.

Error in spgsetup (line 39)
    rethrow(lasterr);
```

I moved oneProjector file to my directory but still have the problem.
Do you have idea how I can fix this error? However, the _spgdemo_ runs fine.

Thanks and best regards,

Hi,

I was testing SPGL1 using Octave 4.0 and thought that someone else may find the modified code helpful. 

To get the code to run, I had to replace nested functions with private functions. I also had to replace a few shared function level variables with global variables.

With kind regards, Tim!
