I use vim, but I find keeping all 4 fingers on the home row is much more efficient. Therefore, I have remapped hjkl to jkl; in my vimrc -- is it possible to have pacvim understand this remap? Short of cloning the repo and altering `doKeystroke()` that is...
It could PVP in the feature?
One people's aim is eat all the letter and another people chase him
ps.emmmm……I am a Chinese,and my English is very pool.Excuse me for the misrepresentation.
I'm here to confirm it works in windows bash + ubuntu 16

In bash: 

```
git clone https://github.com/jmoon018/PacVim.git
cd PacVim
sudo make install
pacvim
```

BTW, would be awesome starting with easy mode, no ghosts.

BSD install flags are different than GNU's install utility. The added `install-darwin` target uses the correct `BSD install` command flags
This game has been great for getting familiar with vim movement practice. A feature that might be interesting to have is a map which consists of multiple windows, where the player could move around with `<C-w><w>`. It would be useful to also include `<C-o>` and `<C-i>`.

Another possible improvement I could think of, is to display the line numbers, to facilitate jumping around different lines. Our own vim usually has the line number displayed, after all.

Expected:
`Fa` should move to the next `a` left while `fa` should move to the next a right. 
Currently:
Neither moves.

Refactor the code so that in future more commands
can be supported. While at it, remove redundant
lines and spaces. This patch is in anticipation
for further refactoring.

I compiled the program from sources and when I start it, it simply says `LEVEL 0`, later on `PRESS ENTER TO PLAY! ESC OR q TO EXIT`. I press enter and get `YOU WIN THE GAME!` and the next level comes. There is no game drawn.

I noticed that a ~/errors.log was also generated, containing:
