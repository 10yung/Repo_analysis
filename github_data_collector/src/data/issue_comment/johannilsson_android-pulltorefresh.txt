Fixed an issue with onScroll() where the listview would not  scroll to be released state if you  stay in refreshed state.

when I run the example pull-to-refresh activity,I find that the activity will crashed when I pull to refresh crazily.

Possible to add "Load More" button at footer view to loat more data?

Since my data store in server side and will present page by page. Its will be great if there has plan to add "Load More" function in pulltorefresh list.

Anyway, this is a good widget and thanks for you guys excellent job. 

I have a problem while fast scrolling. and reach to the last visible items it some time jumped to first visible row and some time not, i don't know the reason. any help guys?

Hello, I'm trying to implement my own listview extending your lib. I found a problem while testing.
When you drag very slowly near/across boundary at first time, the view becomes unstable and reporting warnings on loading message textview. I found out that you omitted a very tiny condition judging in your codes.
It can be improved by modifying the onScroll() method in line 292 to 293, putting one more condition 
if (mRefreshView.getBottom() < mRefreshViewHeight + 20 && mRefreshView.getTop() != 0 && mRefreshState != PULL_TO_REFRESH)
instead of
if (mRefreshView.getBottom() < mRefreshViewHeight + 20 && mRefreshState != PULL_TO_REFRESH)


Tap to refresh is still appearing . can somebody suggest me how can i remove this.
I want pull to refresh only. 

I have a list. The pull-to-refresh works well. Thanks!
When the local data is old, the app should load data from the server automatically on activity start. So I want to show the pull-to-refresh animation automatically on activity start.
I tried listView.scrollBy(x, y) which only scrolls the list view but does not trigger pull-to-refresh animation.
Is there any solution? Thanks

This is to add themeability for arrows, for example, setting light arrow resource for dark-backgrounded apps, matching themes, etc.

I've forgot to add imports, so I'm requesting again, closing the old one :+1: 

I have List  with lazy loading image.
when pulling, get view of the adapter is called on every pixel for all visible items, witch makes it laggy
