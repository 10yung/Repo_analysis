Made changes in code to be able to use this gem with ruby 2.4
When response_hash.data is nil , instance_variable_set will throw error 'can't modify frozen NilClass' for Ruby > 2.2 , using the initialize of ::Hashie::Mash which duplicates the hash and does the necessary work.
**Context:** When the client is configured with the 'Enforce signed requests' checkbox signed. Calling `client.user` or any other API method.

**Without this PR:** raises `RuntimeError: can't modify frozen NilClass`

**With this PR:** raises `Instagram::RequestNotSignedCorrectly: Invalid signed-request: Missing required parameter 'sig'`
I needed something like this in order to turn off this warning in the logs:

```
WARN -- : You are setting a key that conflicts with a built-in method Hashie::Mash#count defined in Enumerable. This can cause unexpected behavior when accessing the key via as a property. You can still access the key via the #[] method.
```

I put this code in an initializer:
```
class InstaMash < ::Hashie::Mash
  disable_warnings
end

Instagram.configure do |config|
  config.mash_class = InstaMash
end
```
foursquare_v2_id is deprecated by Instagram.  Please use facebook_places_id instead of foursquare_v2_id

â€¦it further if necessary

It appears Foursquare IDs [were deprecated](https://www.instagram.com/developer/changelog/) and have recently been removed from [Instagram's API docs](https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/locations/#get_locations_search). It also appears that the Instagram gem wouldn't search with a Facebook Places ID (the request was always going to either have `foursquare_v2_id` or `lat` and `lng`). So, I swapped in one for the other.

This will break any existing use of the `location_search` method with a Foursquare Venue ID. Now that Instagram's [`/locations/search` documentation](https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/locations/#get_locations_search) no longer lists `foursquare_v2_id` as an option, I expect that this is an acceptable breaking change.

Test failures in suite have been fixed in open PR #199.

Replace `he` with `The`
Replace `inlcude` with `include`

Fixes #203, #180
