Hi,

Thanks for taking the effort for building something like this.
It's very helpful.

I want to know if Docker integration is on the roadmap.
If it is, then, how can I help?

I want to use FSS against my server on digital ocean, which I can provide the username, ip and the private key. Can I do that?

- `vpc_id` _(String)_ - AWS VPC id where desired build has to be created
- `subnet_id` _(String)_ - AWS VPC Subnet id where desired build has to be created
- `vpn` _(Boolean)_ - Default is false. When set to true, uses private ip address to connect to the server
- `key_name` _(String)_ - Use AWS keypair name
- `private_key_path` _(String)_ - Location of private key on the local machine, You will have to provide this in order to ssh into the created machine
