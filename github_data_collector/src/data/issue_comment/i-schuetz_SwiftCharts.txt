Is is possible to have the Y axis lines extend into the axis label area, and offset the text down, as shown in this layout?
Thanks

Thanks for a cool library!

What is the correct way to set background color, border and corner radius on the inner content of the chart? I tried setting background color of `contentView`, `drawersContentView`, and `containerView`, but all of those are in front of the guides. Is it correct that guides are being draw into the main chart `view`?

e.g. here is what i'm going for

Thanks for awesome library.

I use Line chart to show several lines. Is it possible to show/hide some lines without full chart redraw? Maybe it possible to change width or visibility of ChartLineModel after it was drawn and attached to view?
Hi,

is there a way of getting a static library of this project?  I really don't want to use cocoapods or carthage at this time.

Thanks, Alex.

Please open an issue only to report bugs or if you are going to contribute and have problems understanding the internals.

If you need help:

1. Read the wiki.
2. Run the examples - a good start when something isn't working is first modifying one of the examples to do what you want, then move to your actual project.
3. Search through the issues.
4. Dig in the source code - it's fairly accessible and it shouldn't be difficult to figure out what's going on by just reading it or debugging.
5. Ask in StackOverflow!

Thanks!

I just add as subview as following:
barChartView?.addSubview(chart.view)

Any idea why this happens?
please support Swift Package Manager
in the example of multi-touch chart-tracking, the chatlinelayer is always draw in front of the chartPointHighlightlayer, even though I change the position in [layer].  

I read the wiki, but dont understand in which order the layers are draw. can you please answer this.
I have a chart with 3 ChartPointsLineLayer.
How can I hide a ChartPointLineLayer programmatically ?
