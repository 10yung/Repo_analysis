The [recommended](https://angular2-tree.readme.io/docs/drag-drop#mobile) `DragDropTouch` polyfill for mobile browsers has the limitation of [disabling scrolling over draggable elements on mobile devices](https://github.com/Bernardo-Castilho/dragdroptouch/issues/12) which also [prevents dragging to drop zones beyond the visible scrolling viewport](https://github.com/Bernardo-Castilho/dragdroptouch/issues/3).

The [`mobile-drag-drop` polyfill](https://github.com/timruffles/mobile-drag-drop) does not suffer from those limitations and offers additional [configurable behavior](https://github.com/timruffles/mobile-drag-drop#api--options-). However, `mobile-drag-drop` does not detect Angular Tree Component drop zones because at present the `dragenter` event listener added by `TreeDropDirective` does not call `$event.preventDefault()` [as required by `mobile-drag-drop`](https://github.com/timruffles/mobile-drag-drop#polyfill-requires-dragenter-listener).

This PR merely calls `$event.preventDefault()` in `TreeDropDirective.onDragEnter` to allow use of `mobile-drag-drop` as well as `DragDropTouch` with Angular Tree Component.
Since Angular 6, the `@Injectable` decorator has allowed for an optional `providedIn` object parameter  to specify the module in which services should be provided as the as [the preferred alternative](https://angular.io/guide/singleton-services#using-providedin) to the `Providers` array in the `@NgModule()` decorator. This PR provides the `TreeDraggedElement` provider using the new `providedIn` syntax to improve bundle sizes by enabling tree-shaking and allowing Angular Tree Component to bundled in lazy-loaded modules without losing the ability to drag & drop across TreeComponents in different modules that running `TreeDraggedElement` as a Service Singleton allows.

The removal of the `TreeModule.forRoot()` method in this PR introduces a breaking change.
Hello Everyone,

I have a tree with 10,000 nodes. when i search something, so when it fetching the search result and re-render the tree, it takes alot time on rendering the tree. To improve the user experience, i put spinner on search click, but it is not spinning, it also stuck when DOM re-render the data.

Hi,

First of all thanks for this great library! I use your tree component in my application and it is really-really nice! üëç 

# The error:
When I try to use the tree component (Getting Started from docs: https://angular2-tree.readme.io/docs/) with Angular 9 rc3 version and run ``ng serve``, the tree component is not displayed in the browser and the browser console contains the following error:
```
core.js:3793 ERROR Error: 'tree-viewport' is not a known element:
1. If 'tree-viewport' is an Angular component, then verify that it is part of this module.
2. If 'tree-viewport' is a Web Component then add 'CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA' to the '@NgModule.schemas' of this component to suppress this message.

# Reproduce
Unfortunately I was not able to reproduce the issue with stackblitz, but with my local Angular CLI generated projects this happens always. (I generated a new project just for this and upgraded it to Angular 9 rc3)
The issue is also reproducible when I download this stackblitz project:

I know that Angular 9 is not stable yet (only in release candidate) but I try to migrate to it to catch any incompatibilities the project might have.

Any help is greatly appreciated!
Getting incorrect peer dependency warning while updating angular-tree-component version 
`warning " > angular-tree-component@8.4.1" has incorrect peer dependency "core-js@^2.4.1".` 



Angular 9.0 will/is removing Renderer.
MobX has released an upgrade 3.0.2 to remove their dependency on Renderer.
So Angular tree component will have to import the new package to be able to be used with ng 9 I suppose.

Best regards

# Reproduce
Please introduce a way to control the tabindex on tree checkboxes. According accessibility guidelines (referenced belowe), checkboxes should have a negative tabindex, so that they aren't focused with tab and instead are navigated to with the up and down arrows. 

Currently there's no way to set the tabindex attribute to the tree checkboxes without looping though all elements and adding the attribute through the elementRef. It would be great if this was available through an option of the TreeNode.

I have a large list of nodes and they don't fit inside the container. Whenever I try to drag a children node down to drop it on another parent node that isn't visible on the container, the content of the container doesn't scroll.
It does work in Chrome but not in IE11. Does someone have the same problem?
