Need an iOS_10 support for SwiftPM for the project.
note: Mac(v10_10) - is the minimum available(no 10.9)
 
## what I did

I updated README.md. Compatible iOS version, 12.0 -> 13.2.

## what I checked

I checked behaviors on the simulator and the real device.

- Xcode 11.2.1 simulator (iOS 13.2)
- iPhone Xs (iOS 13.1.3)

Reachability.swift works fine.

Please merge this pull request, if it has no problems.
I connected to the hotspot alone without the presence of the internet but its results come under **Reachability** state. It didn't identify the non-availability of the internet. Could you please help me with this? Even though it was connected with hotspot it needs to check internet availability is there in that or not?
On iOS app background getting message in console.

ReachabilitySample[5058:1405043] Can't end BackgroundTask: no background task exists with identifier 1 (0x1), or it may have already been ended. Break in UIApplicationEndBackgroundTaskError() to debug.
```swift
import Combine
import Reachability
import os

class ReachabilityStore: ObservableObject {
    private var reachability: Reachability

    @Published var reachable: Bool = false
    @Published var reachableViaWifi: Bool = false
    @Published var reachableViaCellular: Bool = false

    init() {
        reachability = try! Reachability()
        
        reachability.whenReachable = { [weak self] reachability in
            guard let self = self else { return }

            self.reachable = true
            self.reachableViaWifi = reachability.connection == .wifi
            self.reachableViaCellular = !self.reachableViaWifi

            os_log(
                "Reachable via %{public}s",
                self.reachableViaWifi ? "WiFi" : "Cellular"
            )
        }

        reachability.whenUnreachable = { [weak self] _ in
            guard let self = self else { return }

            self.reachable = false
            self.reachableViaWifi = false
            self.reachableViaCellular = false

            os_log("Unreachable")
        }

        do {
            try reachability.startNotifier()
        } catch {
            os_log("Unable to start reachability notifier.")
        }
    }
}
```
Or Is there one? Unless I'm missing something I don't see a target in the main xcodeproj, although there are folders containing samples.

Thank you.
Hi ,

I noticed the last update change `.none` to `.unavailable`
that mean `.none` should be removed

but Xcode ask me to add both on switch !

I did do clean build but noting change untill I add both !

also
`let reachability = Reachability()!
`is force me to remove ! and see it not optional 

> Cannot force unwrap value of non-optional type 'Reachability'

and after I change it to
`let reachability = Reachability()`

> Call can throw, but errors cannot be thrown out of a property initializer

the previous version was working fine !
When running unit tests on Xcode 10.3 && Xcode 11 GM Seed on Mojave 10.14.6:

`Asynchronous wait failed: Exceeded timeout of 5 seconds, with unfulfilled expectations: "Check invalid host".`

This is unit tests run on iPhone 8, Xs running iOS Simulator 12.2 & iOS Simulator 13.0

> What version of Reachability.Swift are you using?

Current TOT

> How is it installed? Manually, CocoaPods, Carthage?

Unit tests run from the provided project. No install required

> Does it occur on device or simulator? Which device?

Simulator (unit tests). Tried on iPhone 8 12.2, 13.0, iPhone Xs 12.2, 13.0

> What OS version are you running on?

Mojave 10.14.6

> How often does it happen?

Every time you run unit tests

> Are there steps you can take to reproduce it?

- git clone
- Open provided project
- Run unit tests
I can't seem to get 'whenReachable' to work even though I added 'var reachability: Reachability?' at the class level (outside any function).

I am also debugging on device (not a simulator).
```
class AnimatedLaunchScreenController: UIViewController {

    var reachability: Reachability?

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        reachability = try? Reachability()
        
        reachability?.whenReachable = { reachability in
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                print("reached")
                NetworkManager.SharedInstance.decodeJSON()
                SplashView.heartAttack = true
            }
        }
}

```
Getting this error when submitting builds to the App Store with the latest version of the library.
