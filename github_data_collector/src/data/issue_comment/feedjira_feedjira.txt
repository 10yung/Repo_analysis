I am trying to add a custom rss feed attribute `mangaLink`:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rss version="2.0" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
  <channel>
    <atom:link href="https://mangadex.org/rss/Z7y3x4nmgS2CfhFGKPRT68scYBvurtkW" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml" />
    <title>MangaDex RSS</title>
    <link>https://mangadex.org/</link>

    </item>
  </channel>
</rss>
```

I tried calling `Feedjira::Feed.add_common_feed_element("mangaLink")` as well as `Feedjira::Feed.add_common_feed_element("mangaLink", as: :series_url, value: :url)`, but neither work, as I still get this as a result of calling `parse`:

```ruby
#<Feedjira::Parser::RSSEntry:0x00007fbd02750938 
  @title="Student Council for Two - Chapter 5", 
  @url="https://mangadex.org/chapter/768898",

  @summary="Group: Rototiller - Uploader: Rotoscopic - Language: English",

```
I'm in a spot where I am rescuing for a couple errors.

`rescue Feedjira::NoParserAvailable, Feedjira::FetchFailure, Faraday::SSLError`

Recently started getting `uninitialized constant Feedjira::FetchFailure`

I see that's how it's referred to in the documentation but not sure how it's uninitialized now. 

Thanks for the help! Love the gem!

We're on version 3.1.0 FWIW
https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira/issues/428

This would be a breaking change.

Please reject this PR if the previous code has a good reason for the way it was.

Previously, RSS entry utilities assigns enclosure url to image, overwriting media thumbnail and content:

https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira/blob/master/lib/feedjira/rss_entry_utilities.rb#L31

However, iTunes RSS maps directly to enclosure_url:

https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira/blob/master/lib/feedjira/parser/itunes_rss_item.rb#L31
Hi, this seems strange to me. I had a quick look in the commit history but could not find why.

RSS maps enclosure url to image, overwriting media thumbnail and content:

https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira/blob/master/lib/feedjira/rss_entry_utilities.rb#L31

However, iTunes RSS maps directly to `enclosure_url`:

https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira/blob/master/lib/feedjira/parser/itunes_rss_item.rb#L31

Is this as intended and, if so, just wondering why (for my own interest!)?

Thanks! :)
I am going to add Media RSS parser (13.05.2018). Pretty popular format now.
http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss

If I parse youtube link 
I have this error:
**undefined method `image' for #<Feedjira::Parser::AtomYoutubeEntry:0x00007fa14be348d0>**
 
other links work

my code: 
```
def self.add_entries(entries, stream_id)
      entries.each do |entry|
          unless  FeedEntry.where(guid: entry.id).exists?
            FeedEntry.create!(
              :name          => entry.title,
              :url           => entry.url,
              :summary       => entry.summary,
              :published_at  => entry.published,
              :enclosure_url => entry.image,
              :enclosure_type => entry.enclosure_type,
              :guid          => entry.id,
              :source_id => stream_id
            )
          end
      end
end
```
How to make to parse all links?
I'm trying to parse this feed: http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/feeds/index.xml which has `<media:content>` tag with a nested `<dc:identifier>` which happen to be always "1". The problem is that the `<dc:identifier>` is overwriting the entry_id with that "1" value.

Is there a way of avoiding overwriting the entry_id in such a situation. The entry_id is correctly detected from the `<guid>` and it'd be good if the overwriting doesn't happen if entry_id already has a value.

Say I have the following nested parser subclasses.  How can I access the xml for the Trunk, Branch, and Leaf classes so I can log/save it in the case of an error?

Thanks!

```
  module Feedjira
    module Parser
      class Trunk
        include SAXMachine
        include FeedEntryUtilities

        element :trunkName
        elements :branch, as: :branches, class: Branch

        def createModel
          begin
            trunk = ActiveRecordTrunk.create( name: trunkName )
            branches.each_index do |n|
                    branch = branches[ n ].createModel
                    branch.trunk_id = trunk.id
                    branch.save!
            end
          rescue StandardError => e
            # log the error and the xml for this trunk element.  HOW??
            ::Rails.logger.error "Parse Error, xml = #{ xml }"
          end
        end
      end

      class Branch
        include SAXMachine
        include FeedEntryUtilities

        element :branchName
        elements :leaf, as: :leaves, class: Leaf

        def createModel
          begin
            trunk = ActiveRecordBranch.create( name: branchName )
            leaves.each_index do |n|
                    leaf = leaves[ n ].createModel
                    leaf.branch_id = branch.id
                    leaf.save!
            end
          rescue StandardError => e
            # log the error and the xml for this branch element.  HOW??
            ::Rails.logger.error "Parse Error, xml = #{ xml }"
          end
        end
      end
    
      class Leaf
        include SAXMachine
        include FeedEntryUtilities

        element :leafName

        def createModel
          begin
            leaf = ActiveRecordLeaf.create( name: leafName )
          rescue StandardError => e
            # log the error and the xml for this leaf element.  HOW??
            ::Rails.logger.error "Parse Error, xml = #{ xml }"
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
```

Hello,

I just update 2.1.0 to 2.1.2 and I have `Feedjira: Failed to parse last modified ''` warning. I don't see sqomething about it in changelog.

Thanks for help
