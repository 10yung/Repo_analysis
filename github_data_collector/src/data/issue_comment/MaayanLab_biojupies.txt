Hi,

is there a way to rename individual samples after uploading the fastq files and aligining them? 

Also, is there a way to merge datasets? I needed about a full day to upload all my samples, and it would have been nice if I could upload only a few files at a time and then merge all the subsets instead of having to upload all the samples in one go.

Thanks in advance. Biojupies is really a great tool!

Hi BioJupies team,

Thanks for this great program. For a BioJupies experiment, is it possible to upload and analyze both single- and paired-end fastqs at the same time?

Thanks,
Kris

Is it possible to use genesets/ differentially expressed genes for the enrichment and small molecule analysis only? So instead of using RNAseq data, one can use the differential expression results (for example, from scRNA seq) to generate these. I just love these notebooks and it'll be so much convenient compared to using the enrichment tools individually. 
Are there any issues with the platform recently? Having a lot of problems loading tables and when they do, I can't assign groups, nor can I move on to the next step? Used to work fine!
The link to export images to plotl.ly disappeared.

With the old version, there was the link to plotly's dashboard on the bottom right to each plot.
Notebooks can not be modified locally using Docker.

When running a notebook with Docker as:
`sudo docker run -it -v $HOME/docker-data/:/data -p 8888:8888 -e NOTEBOOK_UID=rMZqMp6An maayanlab/biojupies-notebooks
`

An error rises:
`ERROR:root:File '../library/v1.1.4/init.ipy.py' not found.`

Replacing v1.1.4 with v1.0.5 the error disappears, but so do some new options, e.g. in the GO analysis plugin.

Deleting local Docker images and running again:
`docker pull maayanlab/biojupies-notebooks`

does not solve the problem.

Hi, 

I have a problem with the Enrichr analysis. When I run it as:
```
# Initialize results
results['enrichr'] = {}

# Loop through signatures
for label, signature in signatures.items():

    # Run analysis
    results['enrichr'][label] = analyze(signature=signature, tool='enrichr', signature_label=label, geneset_size=500)

    # Display results
    plot(results['enrichr'][label])
```

I get the following error:
```

     50         time.sleep(0.5)
     51         data = json.loads(response.text)

I can I fix it?

Thanks in advance!

Hi, 

Would it be possible to implement the option for searching for multiple rows (i.e. genes) at a time in Clustergrammer?

At present this option is not available but I believe it could be quite useful.

Thanks a lot,
Davide
