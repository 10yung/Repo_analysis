I haven't looked closer to the code (currently no time for that), but I found an issue caused by the release animation. It's better visible with the the Interstellar view. Keep swiping up the view and releasing it for about 15-30 times. After that the images inside the parallax view will have a smaller width and height than its super view and reveal white edges.
I just cleaned some unused lines of code to make it little easier to read.
