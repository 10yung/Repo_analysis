In your sample, `PinnedSectionListView` is set `OnItemClickListener` through overridding `onListItemClick`. But if we don't add `OnItemClickListener`,  when children of section is set `OnClickListener` and section is pinned, `onClick` of children of section won't be called.

Can somebody fixed this?
Also ensures that the pinned section is drawn even if there are less than two items.
Updated example app to demonstrate fix.

Closes #39
Hi is it possiblew to use this with RecyclerView.Adapter, I tried like this but I get an error
`public class MemoAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<MemoAdapter.MyViewHolder> implements PinnedSectionListView.PinnedSectionListAdapter{`

error is here
`    @Override
    public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
        TextView view = (TextView) super.getView(position, convertView, parent);   <--- ERROR
        view.setTextColor(Color.DKGRAY);
        view.setTag("" + position);

        Main2Activity.Item item = getItem(position);

        if (item.type == PinnedSectionListActivity.Item.SECTION) {
            //view.setOnClickListener(PinnedSectionListActivity.this);
            view.setBackgroundColor(parent.getResources().getColor(COLORS[item.sectionPosition % COLORS.length]));
        }

        return view;
    }`
  add padding, when click on a pinned _item_ next to the right edge, it calls the click on the item behind it 

  the method  private boolean isPinnedViewTouched(View view, float x, float y), caculate the  mTouchRect.right has some problem;  it should be mTouchRect.right += getPaddingLeft();

I have a nested list view with PinnedListView as outermost layout and NormalList as the item of pinnedList. I have disabled the scroll action of Normal List.

Header is not pinned on scrolling list view.

I used a RelativeLayout View contains two TextViews: t1 and t2.When click on one item its t2 will change, however, other items' t2 changed either. I found one solution in "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36099052/android-listview-changes-made-to-items-affect-other-items" but it didn't work, then I found that it was caused by the function getItemViewType(), so I changed every 
`getItemViewType(XXX)` into `Item item = (MainActivity.Item)(adapter.getItem(XXX));
            int viewType = item.type;` and it worked well.

Is it possible to show the RecyclerView overscroll effect over your pinned header? At the moment the effect is weird, because it's under the pinned header, which looks not correct.

I set  a textview in section , then set a clicklistener of it so it can change its background when I click it. But after I scroll the list, I found that the section can't reserve its status. After the section get to the top of the list, or scroll down when section was on the top of the list, it turned to be the orign background color, pls help check this issue  

hi, just wondering how to combine this list view with another kind of list view, ex: index list view like ios, or multi-layer expandable list view.

thanks, good job BTW

When I scroll to session header override body session, i click to header session pinned, body item have been received action click.
