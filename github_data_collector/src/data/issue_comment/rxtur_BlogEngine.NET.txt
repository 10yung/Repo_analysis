After update (that has deleted all my widgets in the custom/widgets folder) In the backoffice I don't have anymore the Widget Zone (be_WIDGET_ZONE) where to drag the widget that I want to render with the <blog:WidgetZone>control  (eg. the dashed rectangle)

Pull request
Hi,

I've found a Server Side Request Forgery on one resource from the project. I have also audited the code searching for the bug and I was able to determine the source of the problem. 

If you want further details please contact me at nanowormer@gmail.com

Best regards.

I had two sites up on Azure with the exact settings and code. One of them had minimum version TLS 1.2 selected the other did not. The one that did not worked. The problem is in the Admin for widgets. The webapi does not return widgetzones in the xml when the TLS 1.2 is minimum. The non admin widget zones display, you just can't administer them.
Hello, I am having some trouble trying to set this up and I would like to know what is the really DocumentROOT and why it is not working.
I attach some pictures, not that my server documentRoot starts in:

```C:\Users\<user>\Documents\My Web Sites\WebSite1\```

When I reach this path: ```BlogEngine.NET/BlogEngine/BlogEngine.NET/```

I get the following error: ```Error: It is an error to use a section registered as allowDefinition='MachineToApplication' beyond application level.```

I have tried uncomenting this line in the web.config ``` <trust level="Medium"/>```` but no luck. Thank you!

Hi,
how to remove "#" char from admin links?
For ex:

http://localhost:64079/admin/#/content/posts --> http://localhost:64079/admin/content/posts

Thanks
Ingd
Having difficulty learning basic processes in blogengine.  Can't seem to find much in the way of information on working within blogengine.  Such as a user manual.
