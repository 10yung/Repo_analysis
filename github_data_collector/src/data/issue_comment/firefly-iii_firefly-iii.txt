There were a number of tabs open from before the update that had FireflyIII open inside. I thought they were just from cache but looking at the logs maybe some of the requests were successful? I then refreshed the page and got the same "whoops" error.

**Bug description**
I am running Firefly III version 4.8.2, and my problem is:

When dealing with multi-currency bank accounts, account view in the dashboard doesn't handle it quite well. In fact, everything is displayed in the default currency:
![2020-01-18-214311_424x311_scrot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8115374/72670274-fc623f00-3a3b-11ea-94fa-d9553ab0437c.png)

The green line at the top is a bank account in a currency that is 8 times the default currency (used by the other 2 bank accounts - blue and orange). This basically make useless the view because it's quite hard to see the flow of blue and orange accounts.

**For example:** the orange account is the one with the highest number of transactions. Looks like nothing is happening.

**Solution:**
The chart should show each bank account in the default currency: accounts not in the default currency should have the amount converted
I love the reconcile feature - it helps me catch transactions I forgot to record. This happens at least a few times during my monthly statement review, and that usually means refreshing the page to see freshly-added transactions. I wish the reconcile page would refresh listed transactions without clearing my check marks or changing the ending balance. I'm envisioning a "refresh" button somewhere on the page.
**Current situation**
I am importing transactions for an asset account. There are some transactions, which is money from loans or mortgages. I tried to change the deposit transaction to a transfer, but I could not change the source-account to any loan, only to the default assets (like saving accounts).

**Solution**
Add loans to dropdown-list in change to transfer window.

**Question**
Or is this something that is not on the list because of some behaviours I don't have in my mind yet?
**Bug description**
I am running Firefly III version 5.0.0, and my problem is:

I choose the Chiense Simplified to be the default language but it does not display on the sign in page.

This happens sice version 4 when I first use. At first I thought maybe you just did not set the translatioon on this page. But today when I finnaly wanna change it to Chinese by modifying /resource/lang/zh_CN/firefly.php , I saw that it has already been translated on both local file and Crowdin. Then I realize that this is a translation bug.

Please fix it. It will be so much appreciated.

<!-- Replace the version and describe your problem or your issue may be closed. -->

**Steps to reproduce**
1. Change it to Chinese Simplified

2. Log out

3. See the log in page. Just still display in English.

(From https://demo.firefly-iii.org/transactions/withdrawal)

Version: Firefly III 5.0.0-beta.1

Some places I can see it:
* Account Detail > Transactions
* Transactions
* Search

(Not sure if this can be fixed by a `<div class="table-responsive">` [🔗](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/tables/responsive/) :))
I looked on the demo site and could not find any info as to what the heck a virtual balance is and what kind of scenario would it be used in?
An actual example wold be much appreciated :)
TIA
**Description**
It will be nice to keep an history of previous import configurations files and suggest a list of these configuration files on the importation page.

**Solution**
Store in database configuration files defined during import.

**What are alternatives?**
Currently it's necessary to keep these files in local to reimport them later. 

**Additional context**
Nothing

<!-- Replace the version and describe your problem or your issue may be closed. -->

**Steps to reproduce**
<!-- What do you need to do to trigger this bug? -->
Restart firefly
Watch the logs
Chown and Chmod firefly storage directory takes very long and causes 100% IOWait on drive. This is a very heavy load on the server on startup and seems unneccessary since the directory shouldn't change (and in my case is inside the docker container). Only the upload and export directories could have changed permissions since those are mounted to the container. Chown/chmod those would not take long.
