Could you add a simple example usage with TypeScript in the doc?
**Describe the bug**
When the server respond with an error (like 500 for example), data should be null and error should be the error.

**Expected behavior**
When calling fetch, `response` should be check with `response.ok`, if response is not ok, error should be set, not data.
