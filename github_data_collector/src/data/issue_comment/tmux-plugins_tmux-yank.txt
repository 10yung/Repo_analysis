It seems that tmux-yank does not work for me in WSL with clip.exe if I am trying to copy over 1700-1800 lines.  It may be related to the number of characters I'm copying so YMMV.

I thought there may be a limit in Windows with clip.exe, but I tested copying a file with around 3 million lines with "clip.exe < file" it works even if it takes a minute or two to complete.

Is there any chance there is some sort of limit imposed when using clip.exe?
A user may have wl-copy installed, but not currently using Wayland.

This is a tweak of #120, which is now out-of-date.
When I change the global `display-time` variable, the amount of time that *Line copied to clipboard* is displayed is unchanged. Is there a smooth way to change line copied to clipboard?
Hi!
I run tmux with tmux-yank via x-forwarding on Windows, don't know if this is related. At least using xsel works fine: echo "foo" | xsel -b results in having "foo" in the system clipboard, accessible both from Linux and Windows.

However when copying from tmux by either using the mouse (with mouse-mode on) or by using the copy mode, the selection is always put in the PRIMARY clipboard, where I can paste it by using <prefix key> + ].

I tried using @override_copy_command or custom_copy_command, setting both to xsel -b, but with no effect.  Also I set yank_selection_mouse to clipboard, which also has no effect. Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks,

Is it possible to have this on a POSIX compliant installation where it doesn't specifically use the BASH functions?

I am asking this as I am on a OpenBSD installation where the default shell is the KSH shell rather than BASH.

If this is too time consuming with not enough incentive please feel free to say so and close the issue, else a small guideline for how to do it would be nice as well.

Thanks a bunch.
In Ubuntu neither xclip nor xsel is installed by default but xcutsel is available.  I think it makes sense to support that as well.

Hi,

I found ability to separate 'yank with keyboard' and 'yank mouse' actions are very handy,  because necessary to exit copy-mode to continue your actions are annoying.
Hi,

I'm using tmux 2.4 on up to date cygwin x86 on windows 7.
For some reason copy-mode y and prefix-y is not working using clip.exe (default):

> bind-key    -T copy-mode    y                 send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel clip.exe

It acts like its working but simply does not... no error I can see.
I've tried testing clip with `echo testing | clip` and that works.
I've also since added putclip and getclip via cygutils-extra and tried the override in config:

> set -g @override_copy_command 'putclip'

I check tmux bindings after reload and it still is trying to use clip.exe for some reason so there might be issue with override or I'm doing it wrong?

Finally I simply resorted to overriding the bindings with putclip which works:

> run-shell ~/dotfiles/tmux-yank/yank.tmux
> set -g @override_copy_command 'putclip'
> bind-key -T copy-mode y send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel putclip
> bind-key -T copy-mode-vi y send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel putclip
Several people have reported problems with prefix-y in tmux "normal" mode.
