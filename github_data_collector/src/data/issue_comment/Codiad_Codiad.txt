I have been a long time user of _Codiad_ and I love it, especially when combined with _CodeGit_.

However I have stumbled into a potential security issue.

I have setup external LDAP authentication to protect my instance of _Codiad_. However irrespective of which authentication source is used, it only protects _Codiad_'s files. This authentication mechanism does not protect the project files in the workspaces.

I have tried to access some of my project's PHP scripts in the workspace area `BASE_PATH/workspace/myproject/example.php` and they work without having to login using _Codiad_'s login page.

Is this by design? Shouldn't the workspaces and projects be secured with _Codiad_'s security/login mechanisms? After all they reside within Codiad. Is there something I'm missing?

The default installation on Termux complained that mb_ord and mb_chr were already defined and the error prevented normal operations like listing of files inside s project or adding a new file.

So I incapsulated definitions of mb_ord and mb_chr into a if(!function_exists('...')) {...} to avoid the error when they are already defined. Modifications has no effect on existing code if those functions are not defined.
Hi, 
i hope there is anybody still here for helping. I got a the login screen with empty textboxes after login with right user-password combination. With wrong combination i got an error, that there is an incorrect username or password.
I added ini_set('display_errors', 1); in config.php and there was a warning with permission to /var/lib/php/7.1/session, so i could fix it, but the error still is there. 
I think there is a config error

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// CONFIG
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ini_set('display_errors', 1);
// PATH TO CODIAD
define("BASE_PATH", "/var/www/html/codiad");

// BASE URL TO CODIAD (without trailing slash)
define("BASE_URL", "my.public.dns.amazonaws.com");

// THEME : default, modern or clear (look at /themes)
define("THEME", "default");

// ABSOLUTE PATH, this is used as whitelist for absolute path projects 
define("WHITEPATHS", BASE_PATH . ",/home");

Hi,

I installed a fresh version of codiad on a Ubuntu 18.04 system after the guide in the wiki. I can access codiad, but if I create a project, there's an invinite load loop in the upper left corner of at the "Explore". I don't see any coding screen nothing. 
Di I really just need apache2 and php 7.2? Don't I need something like python or such stuff?

Is python auto complete and syntax check supported on codiad? 
I cannot save the file let say if i have a file like this demo.php and when i try to save the below code  it gives **403 Fobidden error.**

```
<?php
$path    = $_POST[path] ;
```

but if i replaced the $_POST with $_REQUEST then it saves the file otherwise it gives 403 Fobidden error.
