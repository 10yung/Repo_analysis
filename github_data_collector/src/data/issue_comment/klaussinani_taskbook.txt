When I create the task, the structure is a queue. I wonder how to change the order of two tasks. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20907377/72473401-76c06400-379b-11ea-8373-7a7721f6b33f.png)
How should I exchange the order of task 6 and task 5?  
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I usually adds tasks quickly without assigning to boards and then later take some time to organize them. During the process I find myself issuing `tb -m @{id} {target-board}` repeatedly. It would be quite useful to have the option to move multiple tasks to a target-board.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Supporting a syntax like `tb -m @{id}[, @{id2}, ...] {target-board}` seems very natural to me. Thoughts?

I could also get to work on this if needed
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The timeline view only display tasks ordered by the date they were created and there is no way of listing my the date they were checked/done.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be nice to be able to pass a flag (or something) that would group tasks by the date they were closed.

**Additional context**
[nothing]

This implements an option to configure the character(s) used as the tag delimiter with a default of `@` for backwards compatibility. In PowerShell, `@` is used as the array operator. As a result, any input pre-fixed with `@` is not passed to the program unless escaped in a string. This will allow users to specify their own prefix.

**Demo of issue:**
```sh
$ cat .\argv.js
console.log(process.argv)

$ node .\argv.js -t @board Sample task
[ 'C:\\node.exe',
  'C:\\argv.js',
  '-t',
  'Sample',
  'task' ]
```

**Is it possible to create recurring task**
i have some tasks that repeats every month, like paying bills etc. Is there a recurring task feature already that i am unaware of. 


Closes https://github.com/klaussinani/taskbook/issues/17

Hey guys. I actually just stumbled upon Taskbook. The codebase is very clean and looks like a great project. Kudos to everyone here!

This PR will add "comments" to a task. I use TB for my daily task management and many times, I would like to make an "update" to a task. [TaskWarrior](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior) calls these ["Annotations"](https://taskwarrior.org/docs/terminology.html#annotation).

## Demonstration
```
[0] % tb -t @daily This is my new task

 ‚úî  Created task: 6

[0] % tb -z 6

# Opens my default editor and wait until it exits

 ‚úî  Commented on task: 6

[0] % tb

  @daily [0/1]
    6. ‚òê  This is my new task
       - I :heart: Taskbook
         - This supports multiline comments...
           - without an issue

  0% of all tasks complete.
  0 done ¬∑ 0 in-progress ¬∑ 3 pending ¬∑ 0 notes
```

## Disclaimer
I am, by no means, a JS developer. Please lemme know if the commit could be cleaned further and I'll take care of it.

Cheers and thank you for the project
**Describe the bug**
When I run the command

tb -t @coding @review review 123

Then the new categories were not created. 

Also I am note able to create note with the example.

I am using the latest Taskbook on Windows 10 with powershell 

Thanks

I use this nice tool on the company‚Äòs PC and my own laptop. Sometimes I want to synchronize my tasks. If we can have a feature to export and import tasks then it would be great :) .

Just like `tb --export mytasks.file` and `tb < mytasks.file` or `tb --import mytask.file`.
