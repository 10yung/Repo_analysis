This is personal taste, but there could be an option where the old-style numbers 0, 1 and 2 are a bit taller than the x-height. (x-height refers to the height of the lowercase a, e, o, u, x, etc.)
Would it be possible to create a simple APL ligation set consisting of squishing together `⍺⍺` and `⍵⍵` and `∇∇` and `##` and `::` similar to how other sets already treat `::`?
whew. i don't expect you to implement all of these but instead of making 100 new issues i'm just going to rapid-fire all of them here. cheers.

PRETTY IMPORTANT TO ME:
- `|->`: maplet; `↦` (U+21A6)
- `~>`: squiggly arrows and all their variants (`~~>`, `<~`, etc., `~>>` if you wanna go that far)

MEH:
- ligatures with `>=`/`=<` in them e.g. `>>=` and `>=>`: open a hole between the angle and `=` so it looks like a funnel rather than just the glyphs smushed together
- `-|`: like turnstile but just reversed. just for symmetry's sake.
- `===` and `!==`: triple bars for differentiation between double-length counterparts (`==` and `!=`)
- `[|` and `|]`: squish 'em together but still leave a gap so they aren't just thin rectangles

YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS:
- `/=`: inequals [haskell]; for an equality operator i don't think the slash should be as tall as it is; it's not division. also maybe bars of equals should extend to the side of the slash.
- `<$`/`<$>`/`$>`: fancy haskell ligature where the ends of the S curve connect to the angle brackets. adjust for stylistic `$` sets
- `<+`/`<+>`/`+>`: more haskell. squish everything together and emphasize the `+` a tad so that it feels more operator-y
- `(|` and `|)`: similar to `[|` and `|]`
Will there be stylistic sets to Iosevka Aile? (Like for example to Iosevka Extended.)
So, it would be useful to use this font in body copy.
Continuing this from the related [Sarasa Gothic repo issue](https://github.com/be5invis/Sarasa-Gothic/issues/116), as the issue apparently belongs here instead.

I do not presently use Iosevka, and while it is a very interesting/configurable font, **it does not have an option to disable the symbols it provides**. This is necessary in order to replace those via fallback to a 2nd font(or more), if a different style is preferred, or consistency with a colour emoji font where certain symbols retain monochromatic text representation due to inclusion in this font.

Perhaps a variant without symbols(variant), optionally an array of blocks or array of unicode ranges(parameters)?
Is it OK to request a new stylistic set? (I suspect there is a limit on the number of stylistic sets a font can have.) If so, then here is one where the characters are unambiguous as possible:

- `f` shape: `cv52`
- `j` shape: `cv58`
- `l` shape: `cv08`
- `m` shape: `cv26` (more readable)
- `t` shape: `cv40`
- `0` shape: `cv13`
- `1` shape: `cv51`
- `3` shape: `cv46`
- `7` shape: `cv65`
Adds a variant of the number nine glyph that is the number six glyph rotated on its head:

*I also changed the default glyph variant of seven to use `standard` instead of `normal` to be more in line with other glyphs, see `r`.*

*ps: if you have any suggestions for a better name than `180six` I'm all for it, I just couldn't think of a better one^^*

I *love* the tailed 'f' you created some time ago and I also use the curly version of 'y'.
Would it be possible to create curly versions of the letters 'k' and 'z' as used in IBM Plex Mono Italic and 'x' as used in Overlock? Please see the pictures below for illustration ...

I think could create a better design for the arrow. Because of the current font have mistake line height inside `=` and `>`.

Look example via your font and Pragmata Pro

Your font is awesome, thanks! But the arrow on the top should be improved. It's my opinion.
Again, thanks for your job. It's awesome font for coding
