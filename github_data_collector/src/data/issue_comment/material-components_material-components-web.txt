Updated to 4.0.0, Fixes #5128 
As discussed with @abhiomkar, this adds an `_index.scss` file to each package so that each package can be loaded with a single `@use` rule. As a bonus, that `@use` rule will automatically use the package's name as its namespace.

[Here's an example](https://gist.github.com/nex3/53cfb8ad8e6717e3e90a61be7aeccc23/revisions?diff=unified) of the difference between an API using each separate files versus index files.
Fixes #5257

## Bug report
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->

### Steps to reproduce
1. Go to '/material-components-web/packages/mdc-data-table/'
2. Click on 'README.md'
3. Scroll down to 'Variants:Data table with row selection'
4. See error at ` <svg class="mdc-checkbox__checkmark" viewbox="0 0 24 24">`

### Actual behavior
the `viewbox` attribute  dosen't work ,  the style of checkbox is broken .

### Your Environment:

### Additional context

Webpack/SASS/Vue

### Possible solution
this svg attribute seems to be case-sensitive, i replaced viewbox with viewBox and solved it.
Used following scripts to auto generate files based on previous example (Button):

```shell
$ export NAME='card' && \
mkdir -p packages/mdc-$NAME/test && \
cp packages/mdc-button/test/mdc-button.scss.test.ts packages/mdc-$NAME/test/mdc-$NAME.scss.test.ts && \
sed -i.bak 's/button/'$NAME'/g' packages/mdc-$NAME/test/mdc-$NAME.scss.test.ts \
&& rm packages/mdc-$NAME/test/mdc-$NAME.scss.test.ts.bak

$ export NAME='card' && \
cp packages/mdc-button/test/feature-targeting-all.test.scss packages/mdc-$NAME/test/feature-targeting-all.test.scss

$ export NAME='card' && \
cp packages/mdc-button/test/feature-targeting-any.test.scss packages/mdc-$NAME/test/feature-targeting-any.test.scss && \
sed -i.bak 's/button/'$NAME'/g' packages/mdc-$NAME/test/feature-targeting-any.test.scss && \
rm packages/mdc-$NAME/test/feature-targeting-any.test.scss.bak
