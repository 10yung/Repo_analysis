I Used CollapsingToolbarLayout in order to have smooth scroll up animation without flickering or blinking.

In the previous implementation when you scroll up or down, because of the AppBar size-changing the reported scroll amount was not stable and it results in flickering and blinking.

And I have to mention that you need to watch very carefully to see the problem.
