In the step-10 readme, the haproxy playbook contains:
- hosts: web
  gather_facts: true

While in fact this happens in step-11 as in step-10 you mention the need to run both apache and haproxy playbooks together.

You do mention in step-11 that you added this already in the previous step but I think that as a first time reader, when you see it in step-10 it's a bit confusing.
+ in some steps README.md files were updated to match the same content as in the corresponding apache.yml files
+ updated/corrected output of playbook execution output.
With step-04/apache.yml

When I perform second try to 

```bash
$ ansible-playbook -i step-04/hosts -l host1.example.org step-04/apache.yml
```

I always got 
```bash
PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
host1.example.org          : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0   
```

May be set  update_cache to true in apt task

In this case I got 
```bash
```PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
host1.example.org          : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0 




I'd like to write a chapter about two Ansible 2.0 new feature, `strategy` and `block`. 

How about that?

Demonstrate debugging techniques as suggested in #58 

As sugested in #58

As suggested in #58, write a chapter about custom plugins.
For instance, write a custom plugin to take a node in and out from haproxy.
This would also demonstrate delegation.

Explore role dependencies as suggested in #58.
Replace apache with nginx+php5-fpm as an example, where php5-fpm will install nginx as a dependency.

Set aside chapter 13 in writing branch (https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/writing/step-13).
Make chapter 13 about tags, as suggested in #58
How to apply tags to tasks
How to apply tags to a whole included file (refactor tasks/ subdirectory)
How to include or exclude tags from command line

Hey there. I really enjoyed this tutorial - great work! A pity that it stops when it becomes really interesting! Could you continue writing it, please? :)
