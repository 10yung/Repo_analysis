### Description:
After using `addNextSibling` method. Application crashes during `XMLDocument.deinit`
```
deinit {
        xmlFreeDoc(self.docPtr)
    }
```
with ` malloc: *** error for object 0x7fee7f04465b: pointer being freed was not allocated`

**What I want to do?**
I want to replace few nodes with new ones in xml.

**How I am doing it?**

```
if let doc = try? HTML(html: content, encoding: .utf8) {
    for media in doc.xpath("//replace-tag") {
                let img = "<img />"

                if let imgTag = try? XML(xml: img, encoding: .utf8) {
                    media.addNextSibling(imgTag.xpath("//img")[0])
                }
}
```
If I remove the `addNextSibling` method call, all works.
Before deallocating `XMLDocument` I can see that `doc` has properly attached `img` tags as in code.

### swift --version - 4.1

### Xcode version (optional):9.4

I used manual installation method and added the files and modules.When I build in Xcode , am getting error as :No such module swiftclibxm2 all 4 files - (css.swift, Kanna.swift , Libxmlhtmldocument.swift,libxmlhtmlnode.swift,libxmlparseroption.swift)
I also made sure I removed import Kanna on the file.

Anyone looking into fixing these warnings possibly with Xcode 9.4 and Swift 4.1? I'm getting three.

So I want to use this library instead of SwiftSoup as it seems fast as ****

SwiftSoup has a function to remove all tags from a document and just leave the content 
doc.body()?.text()

Does this library have a similar feature?
