Update some version
Add cosmos DB databases
Add azure function
Add NSG rule (seperate to NSG)
Add route (seperate to route table)
Add tag section
would be nice if we had snippets for service bus too.
Any plan to add VM ScaleSets?
The [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-functions-resource#reference) for the 'reference' ARM template function shows 3 parameters; 1 mandatory and 2 optional.

When using the 'reference' function with 3 parameters VS Code reports a syntax error, however the ARM template deploys successfully.

Trying to become an ARM power user, I've stumbled across 3 different pages for doing so with VSCode:
(1) https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools
(2) https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-manager-vs-code/
(3) https://github.com/Azure/azure-xplat-arm-tooling (this repo)

They each have vital information:
(1) describes the extension's features
(2) describes how to use the extension
(3) duplicates some documentation from (2), but has the raw file you need to complete the steps in (2).

They don't link to each other:
(2) links to (3).
(1) links to (3).
(3) links to neither. 

Getting started, it was very hard to piece all of these together:
- The VSCode extension isn't listed as a prereq in this repo's readme.md page. Is it required to be installed before the JSON snippets are added?
- Once I installed the VSCode extension, I didn't see a new language type so I wasn't sure how to "use" the extension. Site (1) only described the features. Then I stumbled across site (2), which explained how to use it.


My asks: 
Can we have all of the above pages link to each other? In case someone does a search and ends up one of the three (like me), they can still find their way to the right place. I think site 2 has the most comprehensive guide.
-I can submit a PR for this repo's readme.md. I'd like to link to (1) and (2)
-I can submit a PR for site (2) as a separate PR / GH issue.
-Not sure who to contact about (1) but I think that is the critical point of entry for new extension users and should link to (2).
