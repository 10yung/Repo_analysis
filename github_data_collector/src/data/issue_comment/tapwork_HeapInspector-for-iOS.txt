Currently not able to push to a new branch because of some creds issue.  

How would any of you like me to get these changes up and into Master?

Thanks.
when I install HeapInspector in my program,I find that your framework can product memory leak! Can you answer me the reason? I want to say my program has not memory leak. I just want to test your framwork,no except to see what it causes now.
[UINavigationBar frame]: unrecognized selector sent to class 0x1b03fcd60
When I run my app with HeapInspector, I start it in AppDelegate in didFinishLaunching, a couple of seconds in running it, the simulator freezes. Both the record and heap buttons, and everything in my app stops responding to inputs. Issue reproduces both on simulator and on device.

Debug navigator shows like 10-20% CPU activity and about 10mbps of ram, which is regular app usage.
crash on the method every time.  I have on idea to debug it
