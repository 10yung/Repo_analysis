This patch contains a bunch of very minor changes that help simplify the implementation of hibernate-rx, allowing us to do away with a whole lot of copy/paste and other hacks.

There's nothing very interesting here, mostly just changes to access modifiers and removal of `final` from a handful of classes.

This PR offers preliminary support for `traverseRelation` calls for `RevisionsOfEntityQuery` types.  The support for traversing to-many associations across the various query types will be introduced in another pull request as there is currently no support for that across all query types.

Hibernate's user guide is amazing. I learned a lot during creating this PR. Issues fixed include:

- grammatical errors (typos seem to have been eliminated to great extent, though not completely)
- UI CSS tweaking (make image positioned in the centre, etc.)
- update outdated references (basic type mapping table, etc.)
- many more

example code snippet in test folder is not included to make the code review manageable. Might create other ticket to improve the format issue (e.g. mixing of tab and spaces make the indentation inconsistent).
Add test case to replicate the issue.

Fixes a numeric overflow exception for Oracle sequence min values that
exceed `Long.minValue()`. In that case `Long.minValue()` is returned
instead.

Feel free to modify the verbiage as you see needed
Use %s in the log string format, to avoid java.util.UnknownFormatConversionException: Conversion = ']' when enabling debug logs.

Fixes HHH-13808
