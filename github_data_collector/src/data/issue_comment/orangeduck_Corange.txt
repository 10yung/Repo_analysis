I've been adding explanations, mostly for file handling to the wiki. What other stuff would be missing?
Is png a format the developer wishes to support? I've had to add a handler for pngs that uses libspng, I can create a PR to add it to the main project.
Here:

I don't understand why you do `time = fmod(time, a->frame_time * (a->frame_count-1));` and then `(time / a->frame_time) + 0` for the first frame.
I am working with CLion and it really likes CMake, so I made an implementation.

The bird in the platformer has weird movement, it doesn't seem intuitive, it seems to accelerate either too little or too much.

It would be a good idea to make the buttons add acceleration to the velocity, and not edit the velocity 'directly'.
It would be nice to show what's possible.
Is there any chance to add CMakeLists support for this project?

Makefile targets install_unix, install_win32 and install_win64 don't install header files.
The SDL_GL_LoadExtension macro is looking for NULL return to determine extension availability, that could have undefined behavior.

From the SDL2 reference manual
"if you look up a function that doesn't exist, you'll get a non-NULL result that is _NOT_ safe to call", for Linux at least.

A more correct form would be something like:
#define SDL_GL_LoadExtension(type, name) \
    if (SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported(#name)) \
        name = (type)SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(#name); \
    else if (SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported(#name"EXT")) \
        name = (type)SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(#name"EXT"); \
    else if (SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported(#name"ARB")) \
        name = (type)SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(#name"ARB"); \
    else \
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to load any of function '%s*')\n", #name); 

In any case, I found this problem because when trying Corange I can't load any of the extensions. For instance, glCreateProgram* does not exist in the extension list of glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS) and SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported() returns false for it as well.

The context is a 4.5.0, im on nvidias latest propietary drivers (gtx880). Any idea why?
