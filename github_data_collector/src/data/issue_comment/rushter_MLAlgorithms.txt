There exists a problem about the function ''ax.scatter()" in kmeans.py.
TypeError: scatter() got multiple values for argument 'c'
I want to add some of the algorithms used on recommendation systems. I have completed my graduation recently and in my final paper I wrote a recommender system, an hybrid implementation, using some simple algorithms. I like to share them in your repo if you permit.
In https://github.com/rushter/MLAlgorithms/blob/master/mla/pca.py#L48, the variance ratio of a component is calculated as the square of its eigenvalue divided by the sum of all squared eigenvalues.
But according to https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/31908/what-is-percentage-of-variance-in-pca, the proportion of variance of a component should be its eigenvector divided by the sum of all eigenvectors. Any ideas?


it is really great code , only how to run it
MLAlgorithms/mla/fm.py
may you add example , as you did for other models?
When I run `nnet_convnet_mnist.py` in the IDE , it throw the error.

Thank you @rushter 

I cloned the repo and tried running the example in README.md without explicit installation;

```
python -m examples.linear_models
```

I get the following result (using Mac/Anaconda/Python 2.7x):

```
/anaconda/bin/python: Import by filename is not supported.
```

Any ideas as to why the standard example won't work?
I notice you use a 3rd party module to evaluate the gradient of your cost function in your GD routine. What was the reasoning behind this and why not implement it?
