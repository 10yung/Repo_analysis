Running the following (with identifiers removed):
powershell -version 5.0 -noexit -executionpolicy bypass -windowstyle maximized -command "&.\SniffDogBitcoin.ps1 -StatsInterval 1 -Currency USD -Passwordcurrency BTC -interval 240 -Delay 1 -Location US -PoolName zergpool -Type nvidia -Algorithm x16r,x16rt,x16s,x17 -Donate 0"

Only Algorithm X16s reports a speed, the current algorithm running. All other slots have the placement holder "Bench"

Is it possible to run benchmarks on each algorithm before deciding which to mine, or was that suppose to happen?


4.9 has been released

@Sniffdog I'm facing this issue for couple of days, so tired of troubleshooting. Please help me to solve this issue.I'm not overclocking the GPU.

**My Rig Details:**

G4400
4gb Ram
150 HDD
Biostar btc 250 motherboard
Corsair RM1000x PSU
1x 1080ti & 2x1060 (6gb) GPU's

Software Details:
Using Sniffdogminer-2.16.A to mine only on ahashpool.


title says it all; does this have something to do with the pool changing units to mBTC/Gh/day? 
I vaguely know how to fix it, but I am sure it would break it.  THere is several pools that changed the from Kbs to GBS and it has broken sniffdog.
When this second miner lights up in yellow, my farm is never displayed on the pool. At this moment it does work to me? I wiil watch my money?
Yellow words say me : sniffdog sniffs 14% and upto 59% more profit.
If i have this words in my program pool dont see my farm 
Sry ,my english so bad 
Sniffdog 5.0 crashes after 2-3 minutes. Sometimes less.
So I ran Sniffdog 4.9 and it runs without issue.

They have identical BAT files except 5.0 also has added -StatsInterval 1
I have edited the BAT with and without that and still crashes.

So I am running 4.9 again. I am using NVIDIA only cards. 
I haven't seen anything new (responses to issues, updates to pool divisors, updating miners, adding new algos, etc) in quite a while now.
