Hi, I was wondering if there is any simple way of adding additional paths?

Otherwise I believe I might just have to edit the package to suit my needs but maybe this could be an extra feature.


Showing Json formatted data on `myapp/logs` route . 

Laravel version : `6.0`
Log viewer version:    `"rap2hpoutre/laravel-log-viewer": "^1.3"`
After upgrade to PHP7.4 It returns this error:

join(): Passing glue string after array is deprecated. Swap the parameters (View: {WEBSITEPATH}/vendor/log-viewer/bootstrap-4/show.blade.php)


Possibility to **add dark mode to the viewer**? 

I know this is a low priority, but as I work in a lot of dark mode management systems, it would be great to have a dark version of the error logs. Seems like it would be a simple option in the config to allow dark mode and quick CSS modifications.

and thanks for everyone who has worked on this project thus far, I was planning to do something for one of my projects and came across this, saved me a lot of time. 
Hello,

I am rather new to submitting these issues. If I have made an error or missed something I am sorry. Please let me know so I can fix it.

Thank you in advance.

Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. Especially, why do you consider this to be a bug? What do you expect to happen instead?

I expect no warnings or errors.

Is there an example of adding lumen authentication via route?
Authenticate or Middleware?


Best regards Renato Lucena.
I change the LOGVIEWER_STORAGE_PATH="/opt/application/logs/" in .env file but it showing log files from storage/log.
Any Help Will Be Appreciated.

Thanks
In response to issue #202 where the package doesn't detect other log files deep in the year and month folders. I modified the package to generate an array of the directory structure with the files therein so user can click on any file to view logs.
