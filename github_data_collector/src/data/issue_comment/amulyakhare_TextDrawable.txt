dynamically set icon for menu item but not showing.

Hi,
This is the code I have
    private val textBuilder = TextDrawable.builder()
    private val colorGenerator = ColorGenerator.MATERIAL;
    
    fun String.toTextDrawable() : TextDrawable {
        return textBuilder.buildRound(
                this[0].toString(),
                colorGenerator.randomColor
        )
    }

The generated drawable has aways a gray background.
Hi there,

I have tried to place a custom color coming from color.xml but it's not assuming, it's showing a random color, not the one I try to use, even on MATERIAL or DEFAULT

`String firstLetter = String.valueOf(calls.getName().charAt(0));

        ColorGenerator generator = ColorGenerator.MATERIAL;
        int color = generator.getColor(R.color.amber_400);

        TextDrawable drawable = TextDrawable.builder()
                .beginConfig()
                .fontSize(50)
                .bold()
                .toUpperCase()
                .endConfig()
                .buildRound(firstLetter, color);`

Can someone help?

Hello,

Thanks for such a great and nice lib that you have created. It saved a lot of time.

Just wanted to know whether it is possible for the ColorGenerator Class to generate only dark color. So, if I want Red Color so it has to be RED but with the with dark material color such as RED500 , RED600 aur so.

Please let me know so that it can be helpful
The [AboutLibraries](https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries) library allows you to easily create an used open source libraries fragment/activity within your app. It looks much better than text and doesn't need much of work for implementation.

I was unable to test it with the original Gradle and build tools (as my Android Studio doesn't support that), but at least with Gradle 3.0.0 it works fine for me. The newer gradle is used for debug version suffix (so you can optimally omit the update).
