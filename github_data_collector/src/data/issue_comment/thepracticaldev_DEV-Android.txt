## Description

The app works only in portrait mode before this. There was a flag which was set so that the app never switched to landscape mode even when user rotates the phone.

Probably because originally we were not saving webview's state and then restoring it. This might have caused the webview to reload the app from scratch and not preserve where user was in the app.

Since the state saving and restoring was added some time ago. This now works smoothly(ish) even after we remove that flag which sets it to portrait-only.

One problem that happens is that user is initially greeted with the splash-screen on rotating the device until the webpage loads.

## Screenshots/Recordings (if there are UI changes)

There are UI changes but the Android screen capture doesn't correctly pickup the orientation change so not posting any. Since there are no UI changes inside the app, it has just started functioning in landscape mode too now.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I was actually on my bed, upside down and I tried viewing an article on my phone on landscape mode and it just didn't work. That was not cool

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to be able to view articles on landscape mode, the same way it is been done on the PWA.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
The only alternative was using the PWA which works fine.

**Additional context**
I would suggest using a ViewModel Class which would help in configuration change. Because I know this is a pain for Android Developers.

## Description

* Adding `when` to substitute `if-elseif` as in kotlin there's no `if-elseif-else`, only `if-else`. this change doesn't affect the previous flow but adds readability.
* Removed the 'm' from 'mFilePathCallback'. The hungarian notation is not recommended anywhere, only on the AOSP but not for kotlin files. Here's a good discussion about it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/111933/why-shouldnt-i-use-hungarian-notation\#112080

**Android Version**: 5.0 Lollipop

**Version**: 4.2


Posting an image doesn't work after the fix done in `version 4.2`.
Hello,
When I am on the desktop, I mostly want to **browse**  the website. 
When I am on the smartphone on the other hand, that's a bad idea IMHO.
I would rather focus on **reading** what is in my reading list.

To enforce this, I would like to have the option to set the first screen to be my reading list.

I'm willing to implement it if you tell me how
**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

I keep getting the error about URL does not exist when trying to save posts - please see attached screenshot. It was using the DEV app on Android.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Log into account via mobile app.
Click on edit for one of your articles
Click on save
The error appeared

NOTE! This error only was raised when trying to save some articles but not all of them so I cannot tell what the cause is or how to reliably reproduce the issue.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

You should click on save and it doesn't show the error and it successfully updated the article.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**
 - Device: Samsung A50
 - OS: Android 9
 - Version 9



**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

Sometimes I find the text size on the Android app a little small, depending on where I am and what I'm doing.

It'd be great if there were an option to adjust the text size, either directly from the reading pane or within the app settings, as changing my system wide settings in Android is not ideal.
**UI bug**
MY READING LIST (EMPTY) text is clipped on the navigation menu in Pixel 2.

**Steps to Reproduce**
1. Open the app
2. Click on the top left hamburger button or swipe from the left edge of the screen to open the navigation menu
3. See screenshot section

**Expected behavior**
Either the text show flow to the next line or set the text pixel size based on the device's scale factor.
