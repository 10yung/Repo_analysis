Hi, 

Thanks for making this awesome package. I am still a beginner so I may be missing something obvious. On Windows 10, I am unable to create any of the carts that Font Awesome glyphs. I did some digging and in the extrafontsdb/fontmap/fonttable.csv, the font name and font table for the Font Awesome fonts do not match what has been specified in the waffle.R file.
```
glyph_font = "Font Awesome 5 Free Solid",glyph_font_family = "FontAwesome5Free-Solid"
```
Are you sure this is correct? In the fonttable.csv, it seems to be flipped. I want to understand if there is something wrong with the way I installed these font.

Thanks.
The waffle bar chart feature is awesome, but it seems limited to vertical bars only. Is there any way to make a horizontal bar chart. Currently, the code requires coord_equal(), which cannot be combined with coord_flip(), needed for the horizontal chart. 

Thanks!
Using the waffle package, it seems the code does not respond when factors are reordered using, for example:

`factor(data, levels=c("2", "1", "3"))`

From my testing, the order is  based on order of factor appearance in data frame. 
Thanks for this package! 

I ran into a layout issue with a data set of mine which is shown in the following example:

```r
parts <- tapply(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, mean)
waffle(parts, rows = 7)
```
which results in:

I provided a fix by sorting the even rows of the expanded grid in the opposite direction of the odd rows.  ("snake_sort"?), resulting in contiguous parts:

I suppose this is related to issue #32. 
When I try the following (see below) example from github from the R console in RStudio, the plot is right, however, I got only empty squares when I try the same example in an RStudio Notebook (rmarkdown).

I am working on MacOS, R 3.6.1, and RStudio 1.2.1564

p1 <- xdf %>%
  count(parts, wt = vals) %>%
ggplot(aes(label = parts, values = n)) +
  geom_pictogram(n_rows = 10, aes(colour = parts), flip = TRUE, make_proportional = TRUE) +
  scale_color_manual(
    name = NULL,
    values = c("#a40000", "#c68958", "#ae6056"),
    labels = c("Fruit", "Sammich", "Pizza")
  ) +
  scale_label_pictogram(
    name = NULL,
    values = c("apple-alt", "bread-slice", "pizza-slice"),
    labels = c("Fruit", "Sammich", "Pizza")
  ) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_ipsum_rc(grid="") +
  theme_enhance_waffle() +
  theme(legend.key.height = unit(2.25, "line")) +
  theme(legend.text = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0, vjust = 0.75))
While `facet_wrap()` works like a charm, `facet_grid()` leads to an error when used with a second (or more) faceting variable.

I attached a reprex below.

Thanks for a great package!

I want to make the waffle plot arranged in row,like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12443607/59976838-73496d80-95fc-11e9-8f5b-b01ef9c062fa.png)

How can I do?
Is waffle compatible with plotly?
https://plot.ly/ggplot2/

Thanks!
When I create a waffle with only two parts, ie parts=c(10,12), the plot forces a 3rd color to exist to completely fill the grid, why would it do this??
Hi,

Thanks for creating this lovely package! 

'm attempting to use iron() to stack hundreds of individual waffle plots. Each of my waffle plots is currently an element in a list. For example, my.list$waffle.1, my.list#waffle.2, etc.

I can't figure out how to supply this long list() of waffles to iron() in a simple, automated way. 

iron(my.list$waffle.1, my.list#waffle.2, etc) works, but I have no success in 1) inputting a list of waffle plots to iron() or 2) hacking it, through unlist() or by generating a character-version of the comma-delimited list. 

Any ideas? Thank you!
