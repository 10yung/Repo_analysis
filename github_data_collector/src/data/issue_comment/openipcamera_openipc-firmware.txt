I believe it should be possible to port over HomeKit support from Homebridge. I am currently looking into it. This would allow the camera to work directly without needing a bridge. I am opening this issue so I can document any updates about what I find and anyone who has experience can help me. 
Command fails without this
Hey, got this cam recently, flash it according instructions on this repo's page for v.2: https://github.com/openipcamera/openipc-firmware
Model: WYZEC2
/etc/os-release:
ISA_VERSION=5.6.1.32

Now wifi is ok, I can connect to the cam via http or ssh, but "No image" on main page of web-config, and non-working controls.

What's in logs,
dmesg:

...and so on.
Should I debug it somehow more, or post certain logs to go further?
Not sure if this is the best forum for this but when I go to https://openip.cam I receive a cloudfare error.

The Wyze Cam seems to be US a rebadged Hualai camera. Neos Smartcam is a similarly rebadged camera in the UK.

In order to be able to revert to original firmware, could process used to extract the original firmware be documented? Those who purchase a different brand (configured to connect to a different service, etc.) could contribute original firmwares for recovery use.
Will the camera still work with the Wyze app alongside RTSP? I'm looking to use this the get my Wyze Cams running on iSpy(record to my NAS) and on OpenALRP(license plate rec.)
Is it possible to use this firmware also on Apleye wifi cam. Looks like xiaomi copy.

added new driver sensor_jxf23.ko to  /system/sdcard/driver/ 

modify run.sh
## Load kernel modules
insmod /driver/tx-isp.ko isp_clk=100000000
insmod /system/sdcard/driver/sensor_jxf23.ko data_interface=2 pwdn_gpio=-1 reset_gpio=18 sensor_gpio_func=0

still no image
need help

It appears everything was flashed correctly, I get the webserver allows my to login, but I can't do anything with the camera. Any settings I change immediately revert to default, and I do not get a feed from the camera it just says "Unable to load image". I'm using a 16gb SD card formatted to FAT32.

I've also tried flashing the stock firmware back on, but nothing I try works. I tried putting the demo.bin in the root and in /Main. This camera is effectively bricked if I can't get a feed or change the firmware back to stock. Any suggestions?
My understanding is that the wifi config stays on the sdcard of the camera. I know most of the folks here are interested to use this camera as outdoor (cheap) security camera, however, this is a serious problem. If some one steal the the camera, they can easily read the wifi config from the sdcard, gain access to your home wifi and play around with your home automation or other devices while staying in the parking lot. 

The SDConfig should be moved to internal flash as soon as the firmware is installed. May be something like small jffs2 partition like original firmware to store and handle modifications in the htpasswd and wifi config.
