Is it possible to have a layer always on top of the view controller?
hi,

as title,  i am using the plugin to create prototypes.
i found if choosing "Switch instant", a backButton will not work to take me back to previous view.
but if i choose any other transition types, the backButton works just perfect.

thanks for your wonderful work~

Hi there!

This is a quick note to remind you that Sketch 45 will include a plugin update system.

It would be awesome if you could add support to it (it's really easy!) before Sketch 45 comes out. Ideally, you should release an update for your plugin while we're still in Sketch 44, so your users will have a nice & easy experience when 45 is released.

Thanks in advance!

Nice work on ViewController, Andreas! The module makes stitching together scene transitions a breeze. 

I've got a problem: framer slows down/animations lag the first time I add new layers to a new view. the lag isn't so bad the first couple times I call `my.layerView.onClick -> Views.slideInLeft(myOther.layerView)` (which then adds `myOther.layerView` as a child to `Views`. However, things get noticably slow after I do that the third or fourth+ time. I suspect the lag is due to ViewController changing parent-child relationships every time I call `my.layerView.onClick -> Views.slideInLeft(myOther.layerView)`.

Is there a way to preallocate views to ViewController such that all those layers don't have to switch to the View parent on the fly?.. or perhaps you have other tips for speeding up those view switch animations?
It would awesome if Edge Swipe events are added automatically when a user is navigating through a navigation controller.
This could be deliberate, but I've noticed that when I create a symbol instance (in Sketch) which contains a group named with a _transition_destination_, that link is ignored (presumably because framer doesn't import the symbol as layers). Symbols given an instance name of _transition_destination_ also don't work (presumably for the same reason).

You can partly work around this by wrapping an individual symbol in a group, and naming that, but this could become hard to maintain on large, evolving prototypes. 

Any ideas?

Seems like using ScrollComponent.wrap() on some layers will put them on top of everything. Which is most problematic if it is on a screen that is currently not visible. It can be manually fixed by setting the scrollcomponent parent, but that's not optimal.

Some icons (typical example is a simple back icon) are way too small to be tappable. The minimum tappable area on iPhone should be at least 88x88px (@2x). Would it be possible to maybe auto-generate a 88x88 tappable layer under each tappable element? 

If that layer would also blink when you tap outside anything tappable, that would be great.
