I am using React `^16.8.6` with TypeScript `3.8.0-dev.20200109` and react-google-charts `^3.0.15`.

I have followed verbatim the events example [Listen to chart events](https://github.com/rakannimer/react-google-charts#listen-to-chart-events) in the README.

I receive the error

    Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'GoogleVizEventName'.

and also the error

    Type '{ eventName: string; callback(...}' is not assignmable to type 'ReactGoogleChartEvent'.

It is my understanding that react-google-charts now supports TypeScript out-of-the-box, so I'm not sure what is the correct solution for my issue.

Hi, i've been trying to work this out for ages with no luck

i'm using a bar chart and have my state set up like shown.

`state = {
        data: [
                 ['name', 'min estimated diameter', 'max estimated diameter',]]}`

I want to set a additional category value  so i can then add a drop down menu to only show certain data.

`state = {
        data: [
                 ['name', 'categorie', 'age', 'height',]
                 ['louis', 'footballer', '19', '5,6',] ]   }`
but no matter what i try i always end up with a red box error saying
 

> All series on a given axis must be of the same data type
Hi Team,

I trying to use react-google-charst in a material UI app and would like to keep the charts consistent with the material UI elements in look and feel. 

I've gone through the link (https://react-google-charts.com/bar-chart#material-design)which mentions the material UI options can be used. However, I couldn't find any doc on the exhaustive list of material UI options that can be passed. 

Also is the  `chartType="BarChart"` and` chartType ='Bar' `is the only thing that differentiates a regular react-google-chart and chart with material design?

Thanks,
Arun
I am trying to change the color of xAxis line, xaxis label color etc. But it does not seem to be working. Where am I going wrong?

options={{
                allowHtml: true,
                timeline: { colorByRowLabel: true },
                backgroundColor: '#ffd',
                colors: ["#ff9999", "#abcee4", "#61bb72", "#d8d641", "#f9b93a", "#f97b3a", "#b36ec7", "#504a8c", "#2499af", "#a3c112"],
                hAxis: {
                    format: 'dd.MM.yyyy',
                    textStyle: {
                        color: "red"
                    },
                    gridlines: {
                        color: "red"
                    },
                    baselineColor: 'red'
                }
            }
I have used react-google-charts to render bar chart in my react application . Somehow the bar chart is not getting rendered in chrome browser of a one plus phone. Its getting rendered in the firefox browser in the same phone but the issue is with the chrome browser.

I tested it on Xiomi,Asus,nokia and motorola's chrome browser but its working fine there.
See [https://react-google-charts.com/timeline-chart], when doing ctrl + (+/-/0) to scale the browser page with pointer hover on the bar, the tooltip just stays.
The non-react version seems does not have this issue, I am not sure what is the best way to handle this.

Hi!

I am not being able to render the dates on the axis X.

Also added a test in the demo that allows you to manipulate the underlying DataTable
