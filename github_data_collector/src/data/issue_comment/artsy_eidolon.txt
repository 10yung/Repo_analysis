Hi, I'm new to coding, so please be gentle. I've downloaded all the dependencies, and I'm now trying to open this project in xCode, but I keep getting target integrity errors. I'm trying to attach a screenshot of the issue from xCode. Could you offer a solution, please?

<img width="436" alt="Screen Shot 2019-11-01 at 12 44 51 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11388466/68003361-fa43dc00-fca7-11e9-9d4e-fb23ed9d6d8b.png">

It seems to be looking for a "Pods-KioskTest.debug.xcconfig" file in a folder that doesn't exist. How do I get it to stop doing this?

 
Won't get to use these any time soon (see 
https://artsyproduct.atlassian.net/browse/PURCHASE-615 ) but I wanted to record them somewhere.
Hi,
By iOS HIG any active elements should become dimmed once a popover or child controller is presented.

However, in the app, the elements are not dimmed. I wonder, whether this could be considered a bug, or the decision not to dim the elements was intentional.

Hi,

I was trying to install the Eidolon project, but I get the following error when running `bundle exec fastlane oss`

Error loading the plugin `cocoapods-keys-2.0.0`.
````

I found this issue (https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/issues/636) where someone was having the same problem and that led me to an issue on the `CocoaPod-Keys` library (https://github.com/orta/cocoapods-keys/issues/139).

If I ran `sudo chmod -R go+r /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.3.0/gems/cocoapods-keys-2.0.0` and then executed `bundle exec fastlane oss` again, everything works again.

I'm not really sure where to post this issue exactly (here or on the CocapodsKey project).

Kind regards,
Frederik
Don't run Bundler as root. Bundler can ask for sudo if it is needed, and installing your bundle as root will break this application for
```
all non-root users on this machine.

App should ideally lock the home button programmatically using the new Autonomous Single App Mode API. See https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/issues/670 . This may require changes to how we provision our iPad fleet, since the API requires us to use Apple's [Mobile Device Management](http://images.apple.com/business/resources/docs/Managing_Devices_and_Corporate_Data_on_iOS.pdf), which might be good for us to adopt anyway. We probably should be using Apple for deployment anyway.
Steps to reproduce:
- Try to bid, tap "Use Artsy Login Details"
- Tap "User Artsy Bidder Details"

Expected: I can login with my paddle/phone number.

Actual: The cursor is gone and I can't enter in my number.
