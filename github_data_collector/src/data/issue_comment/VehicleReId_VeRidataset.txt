the password of the baidudisk about VeRi,can you tell me?
Hi,I‘m a postgraduate of Beijing Institute of technology and recently start to learn the field of traffic flow analysis.And I have read your codes,one question bothered me: you have the line “distance = int(input("Enter the length of the selected region in meters: "))”in your main.py, but I don't understand what is the "distance" stand for?  In my understanding,your codes ask the user to input a quadrilateral at first(formed by four points ),Is the "quadrilateral" means "selected region"?So what the length of the "selected region"(distance) stand for?
Looking forward to your replay.

Can someone help me with understanding the ground truth format please? I can't understand how to write code to calculate the accuracy of my model.
@VehicleReId 
    Thanks for your work!
    My name is QiaoPeng, and I'm a student from Xidian University. I've been working on vehicle detection and track. Recently I'm trying to use deep_sort algorithm to track cars, since the deep_sort is aimed for track of pedestrian. I need to train deep_sort model with cars dataset to improve the performance of deep_sort algorithm. Then I found this dataset, I really need this dataset for my research. I couldn't find your email address, so I write this reply, hopefully you can see it and help me get the dataset. here are my email address irisqp@126.com. looking forward to hear from you soon. Thankyou so much ! 

Hi,

can you provide please the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from the cameras used to extract the images?

great dataset by the way :-)

thanks in advance
