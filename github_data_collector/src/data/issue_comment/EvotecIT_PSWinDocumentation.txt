I tried to use a custom template for creating the report.

After a few tests the following happened

1. If I use the internal Template, the Table of Content was created correctly
2. If I use the internal Template but with the custom template option, it was created correctly as well
This are the situations which worked

If I use a own template, the headding didn't work. So there are no headding where the Table of Content could relate to.
I tested following situations, which doesn't worked:
1. I used a own template
2. I copied the builtin template and put my own stuff in it
3. I copied the builtin template and removed just the evotec background

I use Word 2016 for creating the template
