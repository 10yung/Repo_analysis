_As reported by @cTheDragons with minor edits:_

On the website in the new messaging area when I send a message to a player, my avatar shows not as I am now but as I was before in my last message.

If I leave and go back the avatar is then correct as I sent the message.

Steps to Reproduce, 
+ Send a message to someone.
+ Exit the message screen change your Avatar's costume.
+ Send another message to the same person in the first step.

The avatar of you will be displayed the same as the last image not the image currently.


The expected behaviour is that as soon as you send the message, the avatar you see next to the message is your current avatar.

Partial fix for #11083 

### Changes
[//]: # (Describe the changes that were made in detail here. Include pictures if necessary)

Allows `app.vue` to receive a new event `habitica::dismiss-modal`. When emitted, this event deletes the passed modal ID from the modal stack, ensuring that the modal stack handler won't attempt to re-show it after a later modal is closed. Note that the Bootstrap-Vue hide modal event still needs to be emitted, or a router push initiated to change the view, to actually close the modal.

I found two places where I could reproduce the original issue and where emitting the new event resolved it:

- Creating/updating/awarding/deleting Challenges
- Sending a gift to another user

I wasn't able to reproduce the specific scenario described in the issue ticket, with pet hatching / user profiles, so I'm not counting this as a complete fix.

Also corrects one place in the Challenge flow where we unnecessarily used a hardcoded English string instead of a localized string.

> Not so much a bug as it is a formatting issue, but I just noticed when I reached level 100 (woo!) and put my 100th stat point into intelligence, that the "pts" text after the number 100 gets pushed out of the box and moved underneath it. I assume this is because the number has become three digits and the entire "100 pts" text doesn't fit in the box.

Reported by JohnJSal in Report a Bug.
If you visit a guild and click on its "Member List" badge, you see a list of the guild's members. If you then immediately visit a different guild and click on its badge, you see the SAME list - i.e., the list for the first guild. You have to reload the website to see the second guild's member list.

The desired behaviour is that a reload should not be necessary.
When you click on the "Member List" badge for a guild/party or the "Participants" list for a challenge, all player's names are grey, regardless of their contributor tier.

The desired behaviour is that each player's name should be formatted with the same colour and icon that appears on posts made by the player.

Fixes  #11615

### Changes
We noticed that when we loaded a page the top nav item of that page had the class 'down' added to it. This caused the function for the mouse enter and mouse leave events to close a navigation dropdown menu that needed to be open and open a dropdown menu that needed to be closed. We replaced this with two functions; one to open dropdown menus and one to close them.  We also removed the code that added the down class to an item on loading the page. This fixed the issue causing the navigation to stick. 

After fixing this issue we noticed that the dropdown menus had transparent backgrounds on their initial hover. We updated the background color of the dropdown menu to be the correct color.
