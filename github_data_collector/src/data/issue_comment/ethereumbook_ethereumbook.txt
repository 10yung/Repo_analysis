I would like to get a second print or second edition of the book released by Q2/Q3'2020. 

Unfortunately, I cannot focus time on processing all the PRs and Issues to get it done. Many of the examples are out of date and don't compile or work properly. They all need to be updated. Many have already been "fixed" with PRs, but all need to be tested and improved.

I am looking to hire a part-time editor, someone who is willing to put in 30-40 hours of work over the next 3 months to clear out all the outstanding issues, PRs and test all the examples in the book. At the end of it, we will release a new edition or print of the book. The Github editor will be given appropriate attribution in the preface. 

Please reply to this issue if you are interested and provide some supporting information as to why I should select you to do this. Also, please post your hourly rate in your reply. Payment will be made in USD, BTC or ETH. US Labor laws apply: I will need tax documentation and cannot hire people from sanctioned countries, but otherwise your location does not matter.

Could you specify why?
Newer ethereumjs-tx version requires `require('ethereumjs-tx').Transaction`
Let the hyperlink of evm_chapter can work
The book doesn't give a detail discussion of Ethereum blockchain, including how transactions are stored in each block, how account info and contract storage are managed and how current PoW consensus algorithm work. The last chapter only mentioned the consensus protocol without explanation.

I read the 'Mastering Bitcoin' book, in which it explained all these blockchain related questions clearly and elegantly. Why not doing the same in this Ethereum book? I hope the next edition can provide these missing info.
On [Figure 2](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/04keys-addresses.asciidoc#ecc-over-F17-math) in Chapter 4, the axes should run 0…16 since 17 = 0 (mod 17).
`transferValue` is not defined in `EtherGame.claimReward()`.
