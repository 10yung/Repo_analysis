Please add functionality to allow the QR image to be displayed as inline. 
I think this is where it happens:
this._elImage.style.display = "block"

Thanks. 

引入qrcode.min.js生成含有"（）"、“【】”、“[]”的内容会报错，例如“测试(qwe)测试”
```

改引用qrcode.js就没问题。



When I meet a scene like this, I want to render the QR code image drawn to another canvas, but I can't find a suitable time to get it. Maybe it would be better to have a callback function.

Hey Developer!
I really loved this project of yours and started working with it.
But soon I realized there is no option to change the colors of the QRCode, after once an Object of QRCode is created and thus I went into it.
This pull request contains very minimal change, it adds functions to change the colorDark using a colorDark(color) function and same for colorLight!
I would really appreciate if you merge it to your Master branch!

Thank You
