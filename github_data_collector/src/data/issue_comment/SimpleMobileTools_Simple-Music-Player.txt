When playing a .opus file, when I try to move the cursor in the progress bar to another point of the song, it jumps right back to the current position, effectively making it impossible to go forward or backward through the song.

It works as intended on .mp3 and .m4a files.
Version v5.2.4
My playlist is built from a folder on extern SD-card, which ist FAT32-formatted. Half of the items appear like this:
"Atlantis
Shadows"
The other half:
"Aquarius - Hair.mp3
<unknown>"
If I play the first one, then everything is as expected, the runtime is shown and I can forward and rewind with the progressbar-button.
If I play the latter, no runtime is shown and I can not fast forward or rewind the music.

Every file is encoded the same way with metadatas filled and I can not find any difference between the first and the second kind. And I avoid any special characters in any filename like German umlauts and others (old behaviour since home-computer-times). My computer, with which I "make" the files, is an up-to-date Linux-machine set to UFT-8 characters. Every file is coded as MP3 with 128-bit, 44100 kHz.

In the attached screenshot there are three files of the odd-kind-type on the left and three of the normal-type on the right side.

What could be the reason for such behaviour?

sample video and reproduction steps at email from richard on 3rd november
I have some music files that are louder or softer than others. It would be great if smp supported audio normalization so i dont have to manually change the volume for almost every song. Thank you for considering these ideas.
It would be nice to have an pull down gesture, (swipe down to refresh in your other apps) to rebuild the playlist in case new songs are added, to the same folder.

How to replicate:

1. Download a song.
2. Import it in the app.
3. Everything right.
4. Then, move the file to another folder.
5. Reimport the song and play it.
6. Progress Bar dead, cant forward and backward.
7. Song time: 00:00
8. Then, rename the song (whatever works.)
9. Reimport the song again.
10. Everything right.

Why???
I'd like to suggest an small feature, Since I'm using this app mostly to play podcasts which I download in advance.
It would be cool if you could add  a jump +5/-5 sec buttons ( Like Netflix Player).

thanks for reading it.

I didn't see anything about it.

Is it possible to add cast support? Or does that require non-FOSS libraries?
It would be nice if the app can store the last play position. I use it often to play long podcasts and when I pause the playback to do something else and after some tim come back to the program the last play position is gone and I have to find the position again.
