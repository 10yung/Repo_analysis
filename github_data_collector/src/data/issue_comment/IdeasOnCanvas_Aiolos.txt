**Describe the bug**

I am trying to create a tab bar inside the panel similar to MindNode. When embedding a UITabBar inside the Panel I have observed that the tab bar's height changes seemingly randomly when interacting with the panel.

I then realised that this behaviour can be observed in the sample application without changing a line of code - which uses a navigation controller instead of a tab bar controller.

I believe that fixing the underlying issue will make my tab bar also behave well.

**To Reproduce**

Download the project from Github, then run on an iPhone X.
Observe that the Panel is about 81px high and looks fine.

Press option-right on simulator to rotate 90ยบ.
Observe that the Panel is still about 81px high however now the dark grey toolbar is showing.

Rotate back to normal, everything seems fine.
Drag the little line control upwards. The Panel will move to a partially open state. Notice that the grey toolbar is about 65px high. 
Now drag the little line slowly and carefully to the top of the screen. Observe that the grey toolbar is the same size, 65px, when the panel is at full height. 
Now drag the little line downwards to close the panel to the partially open state. All is well.
Now flick the little line upwards - the grey navigation bar is now 105px high, almost double the size it's been up to now.
Now drag the little line to close the panel halfway - the navigation bar returns to a normal size.

**Expected behavior**

The height of the navigation bar or tab bar on the panel's content controller should remain the same and not change based on the height of the panel or interactions with it as described above.

**Additional context**

I suppose it's proprietary but I would love to see MindNode's custom tab bar controller :-) I plan to override UITabBarController and use the standard icon size, hide the text labels and move the bar to the top to achieve a similar effect which should be fine I hope. I am a paying MindNode user who loves the app - thank you for this control, it's amazing!

Any reason why you are not supporting CocoaPods install?

Thanks for your feedback.
