Hello
How can I place SegmentedControl on NavigationItem titleView from left bar button to right bar button?

fix a bug may cause on 6/7 Plus that display an extra line on indicator right side
- Now the control can be a replacement for UISegmentedControl

@nealyoung I've added the ability to NOT have a selected segment which also makes the component more comparable to Apple's UISegmentedControl

Addresses:

How can I modify this to support `selectedSegmentIndex` = `UISegmentedControlNoSegment`


I get this error when i set my minimum deployment target to iOS 7.1

(null): Object file (/Users/jatin/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MyProject/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/libNYSegmentedControl.a(NYSegmentIndicator.o)) was built for newer iOS version (9.1) than being linked (7.1)

Can you recompile it with minimum target as iOS 7.1? Warnings are not very delightful to see. :(

I'd like to be able to set a corner radius on both the segmented control, as well as its indicator view.  Rather than making properties on the segmented control that are passed to the indicator view, why not just expose the indicator view itself?

This for my work:
CGContextTranslateCTM(context, 0, self.frame.size.height + 1);
CGContextScaleCTM(context, 1.0, (CGFloat) -1.0);

But i think need to calculate the size of the characters...
