This PR ads [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to webpack configs (postcss-loader was already included in dependencies) to automate adding vendor prefixes to CSS based on [browserlist](https://browserl.ist/) config defined in `package.json`.

Note that changing `browserslist` configuration might also impact JS output since Babel preset also uses it. I left values at defaults and on built, it only impacted CSS.
The overlay prevents anywhere else on the screen from being clickable. Having the ability to make this option would allow for more interactive tours (i.e. "click this button to continue", or autocomplete options being clickable whilst a highlight is active
Hello, I'm a new open source contributor and I'd like to make an effort on this project to solve some existing issues.

This one is about make "title" optional. Please feel free to give me any feedback about the change.

Thanks!
Seems like title is required, when a description is set.

It would be nice to be able to skip the title and only use the description instead.
It would be nice if it was possible to add custom classes to each button so that they can be styled consistently with the web page.

For example:

```
// current version
var driver = new Driver({ 
     animate: true,
     nextBtnText: "Next",
     prevBtnText: "Previous",
)};
```

```
//new feature of adding classes to buttons
var driver = new Driver({ 
     animate: true,
     nextBtnText: "Next",
     nextBtnClass: "btn btn-primary",
     prevBtnText: "Previous",
     prevBtnClass: ""btn btn-secondary"
)};
```

Can we pass component (HTML Element) for popover to render? Currently it accepts only `description`. e.g.
```
driver.highlight({
      element: 'some_element_id',
      popover: {
        title: 'some title',
        description: 'This is description',
        position: 'top',
        component: <button /> // Either description or component can be passed on
      }
    });
```
Hey guys,
i am using driver.js in an ionic4 project.
While using slider, the driver.js not work correctly.
Because of the overflow:none!important in the driver.js css, the real overflow of the slider get lost and the app always shown the first slider page.

Please change the "overflow:hidden !important" to "overflow:hidden"
In my application has a sidebar with button for toggle width (hide or show). When add step in this button, and user click in this button, the stage position crash.

Exists idea for fix this or options in current version for fix this?

See this simulation:

This is because the red circle changes position when clicked.

Since,
Thank you.
I am developing for an intro that some steps don't highlight anything, but just have a dialog in the center of screen. Cannot have any existing api to achieve that. 
Added the possibility to add the property elementPosition to a Driver.Step. When this property is set to 'fixed', the popup and the stage will be positioned 'fixed'. This fixes in issue, in which the tooltip would not stay on the highlighted Element, when the user scrolled.

It was not enough to set the position to 'fixed' on all 'fixed' highlighted elements, because a child of 'fixed' position element is itself not 'fixed' but behaves that way because of its parent.
