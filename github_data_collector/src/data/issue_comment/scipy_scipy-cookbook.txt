"For example, fancy indexing for could have been expressed by <missing info here>, but it is not possible to do the same for by means of a slice. So, this is why an object with a copy of the original data is returned instead."

"i.e. a new object with a copy (remember, fancy indexing does not return views) of some elements of is created and returned prior to call <is there missing information here? which call?>."

''Hint: think in terms of the sequence of {{{getitem()}}} and {{{setitem()}}} calls and what they do on each example.'' Not sure if something else is meant with the triple braces.

Sorry I would put up a PR if I knew what info to fill in, but i'm learning now!
Sorry not sending pull request as I am not sure I am correct. But I tried returning the slice suggested and had different output length. I am not sure of the math and how numpy.convolve works but my correction seems to pull the "middle" slice. E.g,. for window_len = 5 my suggested slice omits first two and last two elements.

NOTE: length(output) != length(input), to correct this: return y[(window_len/2-1):-(window_len/2)] instead of just y.
