Fixes #10563

I've implemented Facebook user video playlists. Apologies if it's a bit unclean, I'm still a bit of a novice. It uses the ajax pagelet API for full compatibility (https://www.facebook.com/api/graphql/ didn't support some pages for some reason). A limitation is that you must be signed in (i.e. via --cookies) to extract videos from user profiles instead of a page.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

This bugfix will help the 429 error.
Youtube is blocking requests to youtube.com/get_video_info and not other pages (even with captcha resolving), but as I checked we don't need "youtube.com/get_video_info" mostly and the `player_response` is enough.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

This pull request fixes the RoosterTeeth extractor to allow downloading bonus episodes from the service, this fixes #23590.
The following videos are examples which cannot be downloaded with the current version but can be downloaded using my fix:
- https://roosterteeth.com/watch/rwby-bonus-10
- https://roosterteeth.com/watch/rwby-bonus-25
- https://roosterteeth.com/watch/rwby-adam-short

The extractor fails to download the "episode JSON metadata" due to a "HTTP Error 404". The reason for this is that the API endpoint used by the extractor to extract the metadata (`/api/v1/episodes/<id>`) does not seem to support bonus episodes. However, by reverse-engineering the website of RoosterTeeth, I discovered the endpoint (`/api/v1/list_items_by_bulk/<id>?ordered=true&slugs=true`) which is used there to gather the metadata. Both endpoints return the same data if the request is answered. The new endpoint however does also support "normal" episodes which are downloadable with the current version.

By the way, I allowed thumbnails of the type `bonus_feature_image` to be also accepted, because this type, and not the common `episode_image`, is used to indicate thumbnails of bonus episodes.

I have tested my fix on python2.7 and python3.7, **not** python2.6, as I cannot install this python version on my system. It would be good if someone else can test this for me.

I have also tested to download videos, which could be already downloaded with the older version, and so far, every video I tested was possible to download.
I am using the 2020-01-01 version of youtube-dl in windows environment .
