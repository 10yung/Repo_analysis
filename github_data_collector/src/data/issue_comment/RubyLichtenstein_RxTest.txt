Hello,
what I lack when testing rx java things is the ability to quickly produce input observables.

RxJs has super cool functions to produce those 

`cold("--a--b--#")`: On frame 20 emit a, on frame 50 emit b, and on frame 80, error`

`hot("-a-^-b--|")`: In a hot observable, on frame -20 emit a, then on frame 20 emit b, and on frame 50, complete.

something like that in kotlin would be super valuable
