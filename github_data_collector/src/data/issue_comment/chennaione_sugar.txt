        var category: Int,
        val created_on: String,
        var description: String,

I want to be able to use the database I already designed
Can you guide?

Could be usefull if save() do a recursive save for all tables that extends SugarRecord

For the moment it only save the BaseTable and not all the other pojo inside

Is someone working on it ?
`@OneToMany(targetField = "xxx")`
Why not use the deprecated fun ?
`public static <T> void saveInTx(Collection<T> objects)`
Is this project using continuous integration services (e.g., Travis-CI or Jenkings)? Or has it used at any point of its lifetime?
