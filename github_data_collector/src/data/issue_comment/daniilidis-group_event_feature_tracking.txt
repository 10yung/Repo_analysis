Hi,
I have ran your code successfully, but after that where can I get the 6dof camera pose? I want to make figure 5 of your paper 'Event-based Visual Inertial Odometry', what should I do?
Thanks very much!
When I run main.m using boxes_6dof I met this problem.
`
Error using vertcat
Out of memory. Type HELP MEMORY for your options.

Error in undistort_events (line 53)
undistorted_events = [x_u; y_u; events(3:4, valid_points)];

Error in main (line 57)
    events_zeroed = undistort_events(...
`
My machine : 8GiB memory  and 10GiB Swap space. I want to know if there is something wrong when I run the code or this project need more memory.
My first confuse is:
This system defines two templates 'ef.prev_shifted_weights' and 'ef.template_decimated'?  Can em1 use 'ef.template_decimated' as a template?

My second confuse is:
In the em2_affine.m,Line 230:
     time_shifted_points = bsxfun(@minus, events(1:2, :), ...
          feature_pos + flow * dt) + ...
          bsxfun(@times, flow, (events(3, end) - events(3, :)));
In order to calculate 'time_shifted_points', Can this use the new feature point position and the new optical flow after the affine warping?
