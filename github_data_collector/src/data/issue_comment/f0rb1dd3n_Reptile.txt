On module loading (setup.sh install), I get:

Hello,

rootkit runs smooth on latest kernel tested on Centos kernel v4.x.

Once machine reboot rootkit didn't work anymore.
1、bin/packet send magic packet checksum problem

Through multiple tests, the packet sending magic packet, TCP/UDP/ICMP checksum are not correct, in most of the network environment the packet will be drop, Hope can solve this problem:)

2、File content tampering usage scenarios?
Hidden file content, not by other user mode application reads, what is the meaning of the content hidden?
Suggestion  add program can read the hidden content in white list function, such as sh, bash, PHP, Java process such as the function, the white list can be configured

3.Suggest to add hidden process name function with the prefix

4、About the clicent enhancements
a、Like MSF add of reverse shell session management capabilities
b、Add like vi use "!ps -ef" to exec the command of the local host capabilities
c、For Centos reverse shell, the default does not contain the/usr/sbin path, execute the command is not very convenient，Whether can add the path by default？

Finally, to thank f0rb1dd3n provide so stable to use project，very cool~!

`uname -a`

amzn Linux kernel don't hide connection(TCP and UDP)
Thanks to the author,Good job,very cool~!
but,can't hide udp port??
i try "/reptile/reptile_cmd conn <IP> <port> hide" hiden a udp listen，only hide TCP PORT,hide udp  not work! 

By the way, if can increase access to SSH, SSHD password keylogger features, the same with command line switch, then a more perfect~!


what technologies are used for communication hidden ，file hiding, and remote control？
hello,is there anyway to update the reptile without reoot?
I can't install before remove reptile,but remove it need reboot.

[cgy@localhost Reptile-master]$ make
mkdir -p bin
cd sbin && make reverse cmd
make[1]: Enter the directory“/home/cgy/desktop/Reptile-master/sbin”
cat reverse.c | perl ../scripts/destringify.pl | gcc -O -W -Wall -o reverse pel.c aes.c sha1.c  -D_REPTILE_ -xc - -lutil

reptile-client> set PORT TCP=1
[-] wrong parameter!
How to set PORT ?
This is a great design, I want to learn it.Can you tell me how to use it in centos7? Thank  you! My kernel is centos7 3.10.0-693.el7.x86_64.What should I do?
