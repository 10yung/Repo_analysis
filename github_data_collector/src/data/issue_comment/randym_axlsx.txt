I am using this gem for generating the excel charts on ruby on rails. My requirement is to generate a stacked bar chart but it is generating in a staircase format [refer the image here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4sCGY.png). To generate the chart I have used the following code,

    sheet.add_chart(Axlsx::BarChart, start_at: "B5", end_at: "I20", title: "Test Title", grouping: :stacked) do |chart|
        chart.barDir = :col
        chart.add_series(data: sheet["C3:E3"], labels: sheet["C2:E2"], title: sheet["C1"])
        chart.add_series(data: sheet["F3:H3"], labels: sheet["C2:E2"], title: sheet["F1"])
      end

When I manually edit the generated chart in Microsoft Excel and set `Series Overlap` to 100%, I'm getting the desired output [refer the image here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JyNgL.png).
Hello! I make the filter "outline_level_rows", everything works well - except for the display (+) it does not work correctly, it stands in the (-) position, this is not the problem of "sheet_pr.outline_pr.summary_below"! examine the image ...

row - 1...13  ок !
row -  3...5  ERR there should be +
row -  7...8  ERR there should be +


Changing name_to_indices regex to ignore case 
### Occasion
I was adding some comments to an sheet through a job and i didn't pay attention to upcase. This took me some debugging to find why it threw errors so it could be a plus to ignore case on this method, or raise an descriptive error maybe.

Could you please unlock `rubyzip` version to use newest version 2 ? https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/releases/tag/v2.0.0
Hello,

i can't have a background color when i make a conditional_formatting on a text : 

    style_ok = wb.styles.add_style(:bg_color => "002760", :fg_color => "FF428751", :type => :dxf )
    style_ko = wb.styles.add_style(:bg_color => "ffe699", :fg_color => "FF0000", :type => :dxf )

        sheet.add_conditional_formatting("A1:B2", { :type => :containsText, :operator => :equal, :text => "A", :dxfId => style_ok, :priority => 1 })
        sheet.add_conditional_formatting("A1:B2", { :type => :containsText, :operator => :equal, :text => "B", :dxfId => style_ko, :priority => 1 })

Do i something bad or is it an issue ? 

Thanks for ur help
I am unable to set the Title field in LineChart.
'row number' is picked by default. 
```
package.workbook.add_worksheet(name: sheet_name) do | sheet |
  sheet.add_chart(Axlsx::LineChart) do |chart|
      chart.start_at "M34"
      chart.end_at "X46"
      chart.title = " Engagement(%) per week "
      chart.d_lbls.show_val = true
      chart.add_series :data => package.workbook.worksheets.first["A10:G10"],
        :labels => package.workbook.worksheets.first["A10:G10"],
>       :title =>package.workbook.worksheets.first["B10"],
        :color => "e69138"
    end
```
This fixes colOff and rowOff for embedded images
I am adding this formula to my .xlsx:

`=BUSCARV(G2, 'Categorias'!A$2:C$3, 3, 0)`

I add it this way to my worksheet:

`sheet.add_row ["=BUSCARV(G2, 'Categorias'!A$2:C$3, 3, 0)"]`

when I check my `.xlsx` in the cell I have this error `#NOMBRE?` and in 
the entry line I have this `=buscarv(F3,B2:C2,2,0)`

I understand that this error  `#NOMBRE?` is because the formula is misspelled but I cannot understand why the formula changes when you added it to the cell

How could I solve this?
Hi,

we're using `Axlsx` for generating rather large sheets (> 20k rows; > 50 columns).

I think that there could be some quick wins by by applying `# frozen_string_literal: true` to the `CellSerializer` class and adjust some of its methods to not modify frozen strings. 

Some local profiling showed that this could safe ~1.000.000 object allocations for big sheets.

What do you think about it? If you're open to that, I could prepare a PR.

Best
Alex
Added the option to pass in `formula_defense: true` into the `#add_row` method.

It would be nice to be able to pass an option to block formula injection. We use this Gem to let clients export tables to excel sheets. This is an unsafe practice because a formula could be injected. There should be an ability to block these injections to OWASP standards. (prepending "'" to anything that starts with something possibly malicious. https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSV_Injection
