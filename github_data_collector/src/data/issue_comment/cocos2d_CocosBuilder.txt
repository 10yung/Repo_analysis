$ git submodule update --init --recursive
fatal: reference is not a tree: b51de15acb37d72719b03314771e4caa04e57a33
Unable to checkout 'b51de15acb37d72719b03314771e4caa04e57a33' in submodule path 'CocosBuilder/libs/cocos2d-iphone'

There is a multi-step process in order to make this work (detached HEAD) with the latest for tag “release-1.1-RC0”

I cloned the source code and did as the doc says:

git submodule update --init
fatal: reference is not a tree: b51de15acb37d72719b03314771e4caa04e57a33
Unable to checkout 'b51de15acb37d72719b03314771e4caa04e57a33' in submodule path 'libs/cocos2d-iphone'

This error persists no matter how hard I try and whatever I try. Please fix it!

I'm a newer, when i clone the code and checkout to branch 'develop', build and generate 
error

How to deal with this problem?

CocosBuilder's link in README.mk has change to sprieBuilder,
do you want to change the link?

Cloned the latest CocosBuilder and tried to build it. It failed.

If someone downloaded the CocosBuilder binary file (from the previous site CocosBuilder.com) or have built a binary pls upload it on dropbox or else where, and post the link here. 

I'm using CocosBuilder 3.0 (Alpha 4), and it seems that after using ImageOptim on some images referenced in .ccb files the program crashes.  To produce, I just open the .ccbproj and go to open a .ccb file. 

If I checkout the version of the image before ImageOptim was used on it, it works fine (until it finds another file it has a problem with).  If I checkout all the files then it works fine.  I've tried deleting the cache too.  No luck.  It seems that not all of the images cause problems, as I can open some screens without problems. 

The output from System.log is here: http://pastebin.com/7m589aFS

Is there some other log I can provide?

since this project is dead . 
i was thinking about idea to port this project to Qt for other users also 
its great app is a shame to let it die .
