I'm trying to use PS on a table with 100s of dynamically generated records. For some reason when one of the table controls is clicked and the bs modal pops the mouse wheel is still bound to the scroll bar. and I am able to scroll beneath the modal dialog. 

Things I have tried: 

-explicity adding .modal-open class to the table.
-destroying the the scroll bar (causes it to lose its place)
-binding and focusing to another element 

All I want is to detach it from the mousewheel. Thanks.

Just a quick question is there a way on perfect-scrollbar where you can have a initial starting point - NOT scrollTo or scrollTop where it animates the scrolling. I mean if i have have 100 divs and i want to load the page and scroll bar at point 10th's div instead of scrolling to 10 and from there it scrolls up and down. 

I played around with `class="ps__rail-y"` and `class="ps__rail-x"` but no luck.

I hope a Code Sandbox is an acceptable alternative to JSFiddle.

Demo: https://codesandbox.io/s/ps-bottom-padding-issue-3teb1

I believe I met the PS requirements:

``` CSS
.select__ps {
  overflow: hidden;
  position: relative;
  height: 15rem;
  width: 100%;
  border: 4px solid pink;
}
```

``` JS
new PerfectScrollbar("#select__ps");
```

``` HTML
<div class="select__ps" id="select__ps">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```

However there's a bunch of whitespace below the content when scrolling down:

It's not critical to my work, I just discovered it when making an example for another issue I'm experiencing (I think specific to `react-perfect-scrollbar`).

Thank you for this project. Let me know if I can provide more information or if you have ideas that I can investigate for a PR.
I am working on a project and there I have used perfect scrollbar all works fine until I have converted my project to support rtl mode.

The Scrollbar works perfectly when used with or without  `suppressScrollX : true` in ltr mode but when 
comes to rtl mode it works perfectly without `suppressScrollX :true` when once I set this parameter it shift my content to the left.

When I inspected I saw that the scroll is automatically increasing the number from left.

I am using `suppressScrollX :true` to remove horizontal scrollbar as preferred in https://github.com/mdbootstrap/perfect-scrollbar#suppressscrollx-boolean

Here is my example code

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title></title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="perfect-scrollbar.css">
    <style>
        html {
            direction: rtl
        }

  #container {
    position: relative;
    width: 600px;
    height: 400px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>


<div id="container">
    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/2098427/pexels-photo-2098427.jpeg">
</div>



<script type="text/javascript" src="perfect-scrollbar.min.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">
    const ps = new PerfectScrollbar('#container', {
    suppressScrollX : true
  });    
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

great project indeed!!
question1:
at page load, how do I scroll to the end of scrollbar when there is lot of content?

question2:
how do I handle the scroll at beginning event?
I mean suppose user wants to load history of chat so he scrolls at beginning and then ajax content is loaded and then scrollbar updates its position so that user can scroll up further

thanks

When I dynamically change the height of the main container to which the perfect scrollbar is already applied, the following occurs:
1. Perfect scrollbar correctly detects new height of content;
2. Perfect scrollbar correctly updates the new scrollbar height;
3. Click - hold the scrollbar and drag to move the new content correctly.
4. However - when rotating the mouse wheel, the Perfect scrollbar incorrectly uses the number of steps according to the initial initialization of the scrollbar (ie the height that was at the beginning).
Hi there,

I have an issue with the ps scroll in a site I built. Whenever the user hovers over an iframe, for instance a youtube embed, the scroll doesn't work anymore. You can view this issue here: https://littlefragments.com/theaterartemis2/voorstelling.php. 

I placed elements over the biggest part of the video to sort of fix this, but for instance, when you hover over the progress bar in the video (where the divs are not over the embed) the scroll doesn't work anymore.  Now the parent of the scrollable element has a transform on it. Is that maybe the reason this happens?

Best,
Tom
I'd love to be able to have a fixed or max height for the rail in the same way there is a max height for the thumb. Is this already built in, or would it have to be a new feature?
Is there a way to achieve the purpose of the css "overscroll-behavior: contain" when using Perfect Scrollbar? I don't want the scroll to propagate beyond the container using Perfect Scrollbar.
I'm opening this to partially solve #885 

I've had a look through the source code and creating a setting that can universally extend [the default class names](https://github.com/mdbootstrap/perfect-scrollbar/blob/b129f50590ca470394413c5c02a597d9114868df/src/lib/class-names.js#L1-L15) is absolutely too much of a hassle, since it would require passing around the user setting (merged with `cls`) into all the places where it's used.

It was, however, quite straightforward to support a single custom class for the container element, which basically allows users to replace `'ps'` with a class of their choosing.

This would mean any styles included in [the default CSS file](https://github.com/mdbootstrap/perfect-scrollbar/blob/master/css/perfect-scrollbar.css) will stop working, but I've added a clear warning for that in the `README.md` file and, hopefully, someone else might come up with a way to export an SCSS/LESS mixin that will allow people to regenerate the CSS without too much hassle.

Regarding the pull request _per se_, please note that I am only including the changes related to the task itself. I would leave the task of updating the version and rebuilding the `dist` folder to you when you decide to merge this.

I was not able, however, to work directly on your `master` branch because of a lot of outdated dependencies (basically `prettier` was screaming at me from the first run of `npm test`). I had to update the dependencies on my local environment in order to be able to work and test the feature.

I did not, however, include the changes I made to update the dependencies - I think that you, as the maintainer, should do this. You can [have a look at my `update-deps` branch here](https://github.com/mdbootstrap/perfect-scrollbar/compare/master...tibineagu:update-deps?expand=1). If you're ok with that, we can open another PR and merge that before this one.
