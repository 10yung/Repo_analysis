Let see if we can clean up a bit here and there to make future work easier :) 


### Synopsis

We might face capacity shortages when it comes to bring nodes active on both sides (clearnet / tor network). That's why it would make sense to introduce dynamic nodes for them who have to use the clearnet mode since the node would now be shared between both networks by default. Which makes it easy to share blocks etc. throughout both networks.

Right now you have to solely build your tor proxy on top of a clearnet node in order to archieve this very approach. Which isn't quite easy for exchanges and/or miners to handle thus I would suggest to activate the dynamic network.

### Technical Idea

**Clearnet** vs **Tor-Net**

```
your node         <->     other clearnet nodes
proxy nodes       <->     all nodes
tor node          <->     tor nodes
```

**Dynamic Networking** 
_(keeps tor networking + removes the restrictions from clearnet routes)_

```
your dyn. node    <->     other clearnet nodes
    â†•
tor node          <->     tor nodes
```
