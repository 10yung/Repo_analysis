There are two approaches mentioned in the README.md and I am a bit confused at this point. There reason is that; it looks like that first approach is impure and second approach (if I am not mistaken) creates a logger every time you use it in for comprehension.

Would it make sense to treat logger as `Resource`?

```
val logger: Resource[F, SelfAwareStructuredLogger[F]] = Resource.liftF(Slf4jLogger.fromClass[F](this.getClass))

def safelyDoThings[F[_]: Sync]: F[Unit] = for {
    _ <- logger.use(_.info("Logging at start of safelyDoThings"))
    something <- Sync[F].delay(println("I could do anything"))
      .onError{case e => logger.use(_.error(e)("Something Went Wrong in safelyDoThings"))}
    _ <- logger.use(_.info("Logging at end of safelyDoThings"))
  } yield something

```


I am still new to whole TypeLevel/FP stack so please let me know if I am doing something completely wrong. 
The use of `Sync` here propagates out to any code that wants to use the logger. If instead, it used `F: Defer: Applicative` and all the instances of `F.delay(x)` were changed to `F.defer(x.pure[F])` then this would relax the requirements and only reference type classes from cats-core instead of cats-effect.

This is quite a big change, however, as the typeclass constraints will propagate out through all the other layers of `log4cats`.
