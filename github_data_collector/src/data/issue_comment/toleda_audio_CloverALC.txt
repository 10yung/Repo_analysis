I tried audio_cloverALC-130.command installation in OSX 10.14 and did not work.
Kindly requesting upgrade.
May I ask If it's 283 is already working on 10.13 because its say in the update ...but when i look on the supported alc, 283 is not yet listed???
The script assumes EFI/CLOVER/config-backup.plist is ok to delete ... not ok if user (i.e. me) happens to have EFI/CLOVER/config-backup.plist already ...

Will be any support to Mac OS Mojave ? 
Is anyway that I can edit the file to  'force' the script to fun on my Mojave Beta installation ?

Drivers are not supported on AMD X399 chipset motherboard. Threadripper runs on x399 motherboard. VoodooHDA audio works but with lot of crackle sounds. any plans to support for x399.

I apologize if the format is not correct, as the problem reporting section of the readme no longer exists.

On a fresh install of 10.13.4 and CloverALC (master branch as of yesterday) getting audio from the digital output is infrequent at best. Yesterday I was able to hear sound from it by restarting, however today that only makes it work for a minute or so.

The Kext does exist, but I'm guessing the problem is more from the audio ID that i'm injecting using the script. In earlier versions of the script it always suggested audio ID 0 which made my sound work 100% of the time. As of commits made either this month or last it says that ID is now invalid, and suggests the ID of 1 which I chose this time.

Any ideas? And if there are any logs or files I can upload for you please let me know.
I found that the archive of the 1220A Codec is corrupted.
Could Toleda confirm it?

The EFI partition is attached to the apfs container disk but the script is looking for the EFI attached to the system disk, which is a synthesized disk.  Any way to tell it where to find the correct EFI?

I have mounted the correct EFI and can see the clover installation, but the script cannot.

Thanks!
