I included your lib in one of my java based app. First time loading is too slow and halts the UI even after loading dynamically using `ViewStub`.
Throws following error:
`W/System.err: kotlin.KotlinNullPointerException at me.ibrahimsn.particle.ParticleView$SurfaceViewThread.run(ParticleView.kt:134)`
Particles are tracing lines, and lines between particles are trancing weird beziers.

EDIT:
It happens onlyn when setting a transparent background.
