Hi

Thanks for this useful package. I have the following problem: Sometimes, it seems as Windows restarts unexpectedly to install software updates. This might be ok, but the problem is that it leaves running taskscheduleR scrips in a broken state. I'd like to schedule a script at startup to basically restore the state. Hence, I'd need support for "at startup", in addition to the existing methods like "on idle" and "on logon". Also, do you know what happens if I restart and don't log a user in? Does this already trigger "on logon" or does "on logon" mean if I enter my credentials and literally log in. Thanks.

Here is a link with the syntax: https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/help/814596/how-to-use-schtasks-exe-to-schedule-tasks-in-windows-server-2003
Who is willing to take on the challenge of writing a nicer looking addin?
