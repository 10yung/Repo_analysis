I am not getting all the videos from my iPhone. Videos stored in Photos are being fetched not all.

How can I get all the videos stored in iPhone storage.

chapter-camera/Taking Photos with the Camera/Taking Photos with the Camera/ViewController.swift:36:8: Objective-C method 'imagePickerController:didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:' provided by method 'imagePickerController(_:didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:)' conflicts with optional requirement method 'imagePickerController(_:didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:)' in protocol 'UIImagePickerControllerDelegate'

chapter-camera/Taking Photos with the Camera/Taking Photos with the Camera/ViewController.swift:88:76: '[AnyObject]?' is not convertible to '[String]?'; did you mean to use 'as!' to force downcast?

I implemented your solution for providing bus information in the today extension. All works quite fine in the Swift part, but for the completion handler for widgetPerformUpdateWithCompletionHandler to be called immediately while handing the table the old way that seem to leave empty rows while loading. Otherwise the method is called just once usually too early.
Yet when I click a cell and call openUrl, the main app is correctly opened but method handleOpenUrl is not called and so the app opens as it would without the extension.

Hi, I use "Handling Location Changes in the Background" examples

location services enabled

i add NSTimer

code:

```
import UIKit
import CoreLocation

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate,
CLLocationManagerDelegate {

  var window: UIWindow?
  var locationManager: CLLocationManager! = nil
  var isExecutingInBackground = false

  func locationManager(manager: CLLocationManager!,
    didUpdateToLocation newLocation: CLLocation!,
    fromLocation oldLocation: CLLocation!){
      if isExecutingInBackground{
        println(newLocation);
        locationManager.stopUpdatingLocation()
      } else {
        /* We are in the foreground. Do any processing that you wish */
      }
  }

 func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool
 {
    locationManager = CLLocationManager()
    locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest
    locationManager.requestAlwaysAuthorization()
    locationManager.delegate = self
    locationManager.startUpdatingLocation()
    return true
  }



  func applicationDidEnterBackground(application: UIApplication) {
    isExecutingInBackground = true
    var timer = NSTimer.scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval(30, target: self, selector: Selector("update"), userInfo: nil, repeats: true)


    /* Reduce the accuracy to ease the strain on
    iOS while we are in the background */
    locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyHundredMeters
  }

    func update() {
        println("test");
        locationManager.startUpdatingLocation()
    }

  func applicationWillEnterForeground(application: UIApplication) {
    isExecutingInBackground = false

    /* Now that our app is in the foreground again, let's increase the location
    detection accuracy */
    locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest
  }
}
```

PopoverTableViewController crashes when the + button is clicked. By default Popovers are disabled for iPhones and I have to add the following extension to run the code. 

```
extension UIPopoverController {
    class var _popoversDisabled : Bool {
        get { return false }
    }
}
```

I am using Xcode 6.3

Am I missing something, or is the VPN tunneling code non-functioning?
