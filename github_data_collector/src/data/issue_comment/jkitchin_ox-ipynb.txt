Ipython Notebooks are becoming popular in Clojure world.
It would be nice if it is supported here
The export dispatcher allows one to export either the entire buffer or a subtree by setting "Export scope".

ox-ipynb doesn't seem to respect this, and instead just exports the entire buffer?

One work-flow for me involves putting all my lecture notes into a single file, with a top-level headline for each lecture.  It would be very convenient to be able to set the relevant scope from the dispatch buffer.

Thanks for considering!  
I have `#+OPTIONS: broken-links:mark` in my header but `ox-ipynb` doesn't seem to respect that.

I get an error saying "link xxx could not be resolved"
