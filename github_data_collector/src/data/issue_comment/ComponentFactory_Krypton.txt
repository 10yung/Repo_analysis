Hi , @ComponentFactory 

I am using win 10 and visual studio 2015 Community

i need docking ```KryptonWorkspaceCell``` position change action run time.

There are description screenshot about this action
Thank you @ComponentFactory 

Sorry i have removed screenshot for someissue

This is my code
```
    private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {

	    // Setup docking functionality
	    KryptonDockingWorkspace w = kryptonDockingManager.ManageWorkspace(kryptonDockableWorkspace);
	    kryptonDockingManager.ManageControl(kryptonPanel, w);
	    kryptonDockingManager.ManageFloating(this);
	    

	    // Add initial docking pages
	    kryptonDockingManager.AddDockspace("Control", DockingEdge.Left, new KryptonPage[] { NewWinPropertyGrid() });
	    kryptonDockingManager.AddDockspace("Control", DockingEdge.Bottom, new KryptonPage[] { NewWinConfiguration(), NewWinHTML(), NewWinData() });

	    kryptonDockingManager.AddToWorkspace("Workspace", new KryptonPage[] { NewWinPage() });

	}

```

i am getting ```KryptonWorkspaceCell``` run time following code
There are not found property or method for run time 
```
    foreach (var ii in kryptonDockingManager.CellsDocked)
    {
        //MessageBox.Show( " doc cell : " + i +  "\n pages : " + ii.Pages.Count + "\n" + ii.ToString());

        if(i == 2)
        {
            var pm = ii;
            //ii.Parent = kryptonDockingManager.CellsDocked[0].Parent;
            //here i cannot found property for change Docking runtime
        }

        i++;
    }
```

hi @ComponentFactory

This is my code
```
        //load dock
        private void loadDockToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            try
            {
                kryptonDockingManager.LoadConfigFromFile(@"C:\Users\SWT\Desktop\setting.ss");
            }

            }
        }

        //save dock
        private void saveDockToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            try
            {
                kryptonDockingManager.SaveConfigToFile(@"C:\Users\SWT\Desktop\setting.ss");
            }
            catch (Exception rr)
            {
                MessageBox.Show(rr.Message);
            }
        }
        
```
I want to make a CheckboxColumn/cell having a label inside one column without loosing the palette.
The Label must have FontBold and Forecolor properties. Can you show me how i can do this right?
Maybe others have done this before. Simplified samples of inherit Columns i found would possible break the styles.

I've set my scaling to 100% in Windows 10... What am I missing here?

Top shows my design section in VS2017. Bottom is the debug session window.
-Right clicking on KryptonTreeView selects the node but not visually and this makes the user confused

And this is the code for mouse click event of a node
```    
Private Sub FilesTreeView_NodeMouseClick(sender As Object, e As TreeNodeMouseClickEventArgs) Handles FilesTreeView.NodeMouseClick
        If e.Button = MouseButtons.Right Then
            MsgBox(e.Node.Text)
        End If
End Sub
```
-Also how to make the context menu appears when right click a node only not anywhere in the TreeView?

Is there a palette for VS 17/19?
by considering some scrolling bars have to be changed
Hi

I want to use krypton navigator add from as tab control 

Ex: when use Tabcontrol, user can use menu, open new form as Tab,

Can you give me info
http://discordapp.com is very known chatting platform used by programmers and gamers. many projects use it for helping and discussing, this project is amazing and I think it deserves one.
I am a student. For the first time, I used VS third-party beautification component to find an installation tutorial for this component VS2017.
Not an issue btw.

Just an expression of appreciation for a great project.

I hope that you maintain and update the work when needed. There are many apps out there still built using Forms and there are few stable custom dock panel manager solution options.

Best
