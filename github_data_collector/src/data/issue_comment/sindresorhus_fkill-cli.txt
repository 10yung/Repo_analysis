Currently fkill-cli is only listing 4 processes, but the screen can be much larger.  Any reason to only list 4 lines?

We need to kill a node process that runs a server (e.g. on port 8000) as part of our deployment script.

Using "fkill :8000" doesn't terminate the process, so we need "fkill -f :8000"

Unfortunately, fkill is returning an error code when there is no process running on port 8000. So we added the silent switch "fkill -f -s :8000"

This works, but gives an error message when no process has been found, which should not be the case using -s.

Fixes #62 .

Style and thresholds might be opinionated, but I tuned them to the point I was comfortable finding processes.

- processes are sorted by sum of cpu and memory usage(percentage), highest first
- in verbose mode memory and cpu usage is show when it is above 0.1% (minimal number we can get)
- in non-verbose mode memory usage is shown when it's above 0.5%, cpu usage shown when it's above 2%
- cpu usage is shown in dark red
- memory usage is shown in dark yellow

Will be cool to see CPU/mem usage as often a lot of same processes running with same name.

Will be cool to distinguish them.

Forces a kill if the normal kill behavior fails. `handleFkillError` already includes functionality for handling the case of a failed kill, but `fkill` doesn't throw an error when it fails to kill a process, so I chose a different way to implement this feature.

Resolves #42
Installing the library, at least on Windows, throws the following warning:

`warning fkill-cli > fkill > taskkill > execa > cross-spawn-async@2.2.5: cross-spawn no longer requires a build toolchain, use it instead`

I gather this is a package dependency deprecation warning, you may want to look into this.
Yesterday I had a fun time when I wanted to see the usage for `fkill` and typed `fkill help`. oh boy! havoc! it very successfully killed all "helper" processes: slack, atom, chrome, etc were all nuked. Wasn't a huge deal, but I wonder what you think of special casing `fkill help` to help prevent this for others.

I'm happy to work on a PR for this!
Macos v 10.1.3.3 ( High Sierra)

There is a process running on the port 8083 ; I have checked from `lsof` command  and When I try to kill a process using port number than it gives following error:


> fkill :8083

> [AggregateError:
>     Error: Killing process 64708 failed: Process doesn't exist
>         at Array.map (<anonymous>)

In the interactive mode, entering e.g. "crome" (instead of "chrome") will show "No results...". It would be great to improve the UI to be better at fuzzy search, e.g. with the help of https://github.com/farzher/fuzzysort

I have a node.js process listening on port 3000 and I can't kill it.
