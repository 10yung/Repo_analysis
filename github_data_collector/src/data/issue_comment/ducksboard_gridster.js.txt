My English is poor, this is my first time to open an issue.
If you want a responsive gridster, you can try this : 
```
function girdsterResize ( ){
        //use the resize_widget_dimensions method, the variable baseDiemensionWidth is measured by yourself according to the container of gridster
        gridsterObj.resize_widget_dimensions({
            widget_base_dimensions: [baseDiemensionWidth, 100]
        });
    };
```
I found this answer from the Issues, but I also found it not work when I change to another router( i am using Angular to do a SPA)
After I debug my programmer , i found the solution to resolve this question.
At the source code of jquery.gridster.js, the method _add_style_tag_ has an if statement
```
if (!document.getElementById(cssID)) 
```
Gridster.js create the <style> and insert into the <head>,if you change to another router , the statement always  be false.
By remove the element which has ID called cssID before the statement, I realize a responsive gridster:
```
$('#'+cssID).remove();
```


I am using **Gridster v0.7.0**, Recently I am facing one problem that while dragging the widgets the dragged widget gets overlapped on the widget that exists on that co-ordinates.

Below I have attached the GIF for better understanding.

Adding the code for creating Gridster.

```
gridster = $("#GDashboard ul").gridster({
        namespace: '#GDashboard',
        widget_margins: [10, 10],
        widget_base_dimensions: [270, 126],
        max_cols: 4,
        extra_rows:15,
        avoid_overlapped_widgets: true,
        serialize_params: function ($w, wgd) {
            return {
                id: $w.attr('id'),
                col: wgd.col,
                row: wgd.row,
                size_x: wgd.size_x,
                size_y: wgd.size_y
            };
        }
    }).data('gridster');
```
Hi,
I recently encountered such a problem. When I move widget to right or left, sometimes it will overlap some other widget, specially when the other widget is at the far right or left.

If there are many widgets in the dashboard, the probability of this happening will increase greatly.

Thanks for any suggestions or solutions.
I'm using Gridster ( v0.7.0 - 2017-03-27 ) for my web site, and i need to add lot of widgets with "add_widget" command. While adding multiple gridster instances on the same page, page loads forever or hang during page load. Tested it on both Chrome & Firefox browser and issue exits.

Tried the solution provided here:  https://github.com/ducksboard/gridster.js/issues/166 But it does't work.

Any ideas how to fix this problem?

Here's my code:

var gridster = [];

for(i=0; i<=5 ; i++){
  gridster[i]=$(".gridster ul.grid"+i).gridster({
        widget_base_dimensions: [5, 5],
        widget_margins: [5, 5],
        shift_widgets_up: false,            
        shift_larger_widgets_down: false,
        collision: {
            wait_for_mouseup: true
        },
        avoid_overlapped_widgets: true            
    }).data('gridster');

    $.each(widgets[i], function (j, widget) {
         gridster[i].add_widget.apply(gridster[i], widget)   
    });       
}
Overlapping divs appear when responsive layouts are dragged
I'm trying to use a fontawesome class as handle_class, this classes have the format **fas fa-[some-name]** and it seems that breaks the resizing, I believe it has something to do with the fact that a class with the same name of the one you specify as handle_class + _-both_ is added to the span, and in this case what is doing is generating is a span with this class attribute **fas fa-expand-arrows-alt fas fa-expand-arrows-alt-both**
Hi,

I have created a resizable layout using gridster, and it saves on change, so for example my current configuration is:

widget base: [50,50]
margin [2,2]
and one item "Page section 1" only with sizex="10" sizey="10" row="1" col="1"

Now, let's assume one user called Mr. Whites modified his layout, so that "Page section 1" becomes: 
sizex="5" sizey="5" row="1" col="1", that will be saved in db, and every time Mr. Whites opens this page, his layout will be that size.

After long time using this solution, I've realized that, it may be useful for Mr. Whites to resize with smaller steps, so I changed the widget base from: [50,50] to [10,10], because I wanted to be flexible if one day I decide to change it again, I've created a function that will calculate the factor:

```
function getFactor(response){
    var response = response || {},
        originalWidgetBaseDimension = 50,
        currentWidgetBaseDimension;
    
        if(typeof reponse.widgetBaseDimension != 'undefined')
        {
            currentWidgetBaseDimension = reponse.widgetBaseDimension;
        }else{
            currentWidgetBaseDimension = this.widgetBaseDimension;
        }

        return originalWidgetBaseDimension / currentWidgetBaseDimension;
}
```

In this case the factor will be 5 because 50/10 is 5. 
Then I get the settings saved in DB for Mr. Whites and I multiple sizex and sizey by the factor.
So now:
sizex="5" sizey="5" row="1" col="1" 
will become:
sizex="25" sizey="25" row="1" col="1" 

I expected it to look exactly the same as previous layout, but it doesn't. I also tried to measure the width of the element while changing the widget base, so seeing if I was able to see any kind of pattern, but no luck.

when widget base is: | width()   / sizex  | height()   / sizey
5                                | 8.953846154px | 8.7px
10                              | 13.0976px         | 13.4px
25                              | 28.76px             | 27.2px
50                              | 53px                  | 51px

The dirty way, would be to ask Mr. Whites to resize his layout with the new version, I would like to avoid that.

Is there any other way to calculate this?

Thank you very much!




after reordering objects , I want to save position , But I don't know how I can do that please any one can help me
