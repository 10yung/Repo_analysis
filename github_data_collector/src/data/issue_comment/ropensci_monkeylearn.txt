@maelle just was looking back at this and noticed a few things to update in the readme 😄 

- I believe GitHub integration is no longer supported
- updated the URL of instructions for setting .Renviron variables (used to be http://stat545.com/bit003_api-key-env-var.html)
- added "custom" as an option to plans we support 
E.g. if data is "       " we should handle the same as " "
https://monkeylearn.com/api/v3/ (requires auth)
Haven't looked into what this would entail yet!

Cf #57 

In the future we could

* Try to get the waiting time built-in in the 429 error responses.

* Hit an endpoint if/when it becomes available, that'd return the rate(s) associated to the API key, memoise the result, and then use it in the whole R session.

I've also just realized that all our rate limiting efforts will fail if users open several R sessions and use `monkeylearn` in it, but in that case, we're not responsible. 😁
