### Description
This is more of a question about the face recognition encoding. Is there parity between how this works and the Mat representation that OpenCV creates? I have a deep learning model that is trained on images that are represented with the OpenCV Mat encoding, but I want to be able to use the face recognition API to get the face encodings and funnel it to my model. Does anyone have any experience doing something like this?

### What I Did

Paste the command(s) you ran and the output.

**This is not regarding issue** 
Am new to face_recognition
1 I capture videos using mobile It has precision like 1080 x 960 WITH 60 FPS etc
This is streamed via laptop camera 640 x 480 with 24 FPS
There seems to be problem that the streamed video is out of bounds
Is it possible to downsize the video and its speed before streaming
or should i set the mobile settings as per laptop camera & record

2.And is it required or can i use it just like that

3. I face 1 more problem that although i have provided tolerance filter for CNN detection as 60, it is identifying false positives because it is selecting > 60 distance in numpy array. I would like to know how to find the path from which it is taking the underlying python api

Pls help me

Is there anyway to make it detect peoples faces in real time by using an IP Camera?
ok can anyone here tell me how to make it save the names of the people it detects on a webcam, i mean if it sees me is there anyway to make it save it into a file?

### Description

Have been working with mysql databases and face_recognition module for a while now, but since my last workspace change I cant even run my regularly sign up script. Ran it as a .dbg to try to fix my issue. But received this output.

### What I Did

```
python3-dbg cadastro.py
```
Output:

Just a minor clean.
Please, update the version of PyPI to point to the latest version of the software.

### Description
This work is very helpful to check if two images come from the same person. But my case is I have a pool of faces of same person. How can I improve the accuracy by comparing my probe image with the pool rather than random chosen one? Can I get one embedding with a pool of same person face images?
