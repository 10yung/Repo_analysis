Please include the following information.

- OS Version: 10.13.6
- Mac model: Macbook Pro 17" Late 2011
- Dongle or replaced card?: Bluetooth upgraded to 4
- Used dongle/card:

Your Issue: I upgraded my Bluetooth card and it's recognized and system preferences lists it as 4 0x6 so it's correct. The Continuity Activation Tool ran and the computer reset. After that I should activate HandOff through the General system settings but unfortunately I don't have the option anywhere so somehow the new card and the Continuity update didn't work somewhere, so I spent some money and 1 hour of time for nothing so far. Can this be fixed?

yes, but no solution  Here:  https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/issues/464?fbclid=IwAR0bBgndxRhUwxbFRB1-sfRomBwF75TOoCOD33poX1d7eqnCXONxCD94xwM
Please include the following information.

- OS Version: high sierra
- Mac model: 2010 mac pro 10,1
- Dongle or replaced card?: dongle
- Used dongle/card:   IOGEAR USB Bluetooth 4.0 Micro Adapter GBU521. I set it as default bluetooth.

Your Issue:

THe Continuity Activation Tool doesn't seem to work and causes kernal panics on startup in High Sierra. I found a post complaining of the same issue in Mojave, with no solution either.  I followed the instructions to install.  After installing, the mac starts up about half way, then suffers a kernel panic about half way.  I hold down the power button to shut off, start again, and face the same problem over and over.  

Steps done to try to fix the issue:
 
I restarted in recovery and reinstalled the OS..

Have tried CAT in the past with MBP Mid 2010 13 inch, ended up bricking and had to restart from scratch. Learned that the 13 inch model is not supported due to the wireless card being inside the lid? Was wondering if anyone has gotten CAT to successfully work or a workaround.

Have you tried [these steps](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/wiki#cant-open-the-tool)? **Yes**

Is there already an open topic for this issue? **Not that I could find**

Please include the following information.

- OS Version: **10.14.6 Mojave**
- Mac model: **Mac Pro 5,1**
- Dongle or replaced card?: **IOGEAR GBU521 Bluetooth 4.0 Dongle and my WIFi card which identifies itself as AirPort Extreme  (0x14E4, 0x8E) (Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (5.106.98.102.31))**
- Used dongle/card: **Broadcom WiFi card and USB bluetooth dongle**

**Your Issue:** 
After running the CAT tool and rebooting my Mac will reboot two or three times before macOS notifies me that a third party kernel extension is preventing my Mac from booting. When I look at the logs I see airport.brcm4360 is to blame. The only fix for the kernel panics during boot is to reinstall macOS from recovery. 

**Steps done to try to fix the issue:**
Running the tool using the commands listed including the -f flag with no success.

i also want to enable the file drop exchange which says State: Disabled

Is there also a way to change the model identifier from 6,2 to 7,1 or 7,2

Also how do i solve this issue:
WARNING. Unknown Bluetooth features have been detected (code:6). This tool can try to fix this.
Hello:

Anyone had tried to work with an iPhone with iOS 13 beta?

I will explain my experience.

Mi MBP 2011 works with High Sierra and CAT since the day this macOS version appears.

I never have troubles and all works fine except sometimes an slow AirDrop devise search.

Now happens all contrary. Continuity feature works fine, but only when goes to the file: mail message, single Note, or a Safari site. All in both sides. Including Copy Clipboard. When a Note or email is been written is shared to the other devise without torubles as well.

But there is not a way to connect to internet with Handoff yet.

- OS Version: 13 beta 2
- Mac model: MacBook Pro 17 early 2011
- Dongle or replaced card?: Replaced BT Card
- Used dongle/card: BCM94331PCIEBT4CAX

I am testing at this time and if there is not chance to fix, will downgrade my iPhone.

Regards
Hi all,
After replacing both Airport card and WiFi antenna, Handoff/Airdrop/etc. work flawlessly, thanks for this awesome patch. Just a note to folks who have done this fix: when my computer slept due to low battery when traveling, it awakened with a "Wi-Fi: No Hardware Installed" message. Tried resetting both PRAM and SMC to no avail, then replaced some hardware. Finally, ran the "csrutil disable" (disable System Integrity) command in Recovery mode in order to reinstall Continuity, and it magically fixed the WiFi. WiFi stayed fixed after re-enabling System Integrity ("csrutil enable"). Just a heads-up for anyone who suddenly encounters this problem and is worried they ruined their hardware!

Cheers!

Your Issue:
I have enabled Hands Off, but when I copy something from another computer that is on the same network, the clipboard is not shared with my macbook and vice versa...
Have you tried [these steps](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/wiki#cant-open-the-tool)?

Yes have tried CAT V2.6b6

Is there already an open topic for this issue?

Not for the exact same issue I don't beleive.

Please include the following information.

- OS Version: High Sierra 10.13.6
- Mac model: Mac Pro 5,1 2010 3.33
- Dongle or replaced card?: Yes replaced card
- Used dongle/card: Broadcom BCM94360CD kit from OSXWIFI
Your Issue:

I have two OS's both on SSD's.  One is Yosemite, the other is a fresh install of High Sierra.  Wifi is working fine with both OS', however Bluetooth is completely absent from High Sierra.  When I go to Apple System Report~Bluetooth it simply says "No information found".

Yosemite has Bluetooth 4.0 LE working perfectly, Handoff and Airdrop both work fine, so it's weird that when I look at the CAT system compatibility check in High Sierra it says my hardware doesn't support Bluetooth 4.0!! 

The High Sierra disc is currently just a test disc, so no data on it.

Steps done to try to fix the issue:

I've disabled SIP then run CAT, logged in and out of iCloud, zapped the PRAM, trashed the bluetooth plist and still am not having any luck.

I've just run the CAT system compatibility check and got the following report:

![CAT High Sierra 23 4 19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29886153/56560888-ff351e00-65e8-11e9-99ca-fc79cb3c7b68.png)

Please, if anyone can help I'd very much appreciate it.

I am hoping to get this issue sorted so then I can upgrade my GPU (to GeForce GTX 680) and upgrade to Mojave.
