Hi!
Is this module being maintained in any way? I see some old bugreports but no response? 
We're compiling a list of MM modules over [here](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/wiki/Voice-Related-Modules). 
Cheers!

We can use React with Typescript to create UI for MagicMirror. It will allow us to manage components like Animation UI, Maps and RSS List more efficiently
Google TTS can be added with the help of https://github.com/zlargon/google-tts package. It can be added as default TTS since web and android also use the same.
Currently, the speech recognition is done in the following manner
- Record user voice and save it to a file.
- Stop recording when silence detected or timeout.
- Send Audio for speech recognition. 
- Display the transcribed text for audio and send it to SUSI Server.

This can be improved to support Live Speech recognition like Webchat Client and Android Client in which intermediate results are also show to the users. I found some strategies to incorporate same feature in MagicMirror.
- **Webspeech API** : Webspeech API could be used for free just like in the webclient in electron app like our MagicMirror Module using https://github.com/noffle/electron-speech. However, google recently has removed support for it and it could not be used anymore.
- **Google Cloud Speech API** : Google Cloud Speech API with streaming results is an alternative which can be used. However, free tier for Google Cloud Speech supports only 60 minutes of usage which will be easily exhausted.
- **Microsoft Bing Speech API** : Microsoft Bing provides speech api with intermediate result support. Its free tier support 5000 transactions per month, around 1250 minutes which is more than sufficient.

In my opinion, Microsoft Bing Speech API is the best choice for now. We can add support for more services if it doesn't give satisfactory results.
**Current Behavior**
Currently, only Text Responses i.e. "answer" action type is being used. Rest of the SUSI Response Action Types are ignored.

**Expected Behavior**
Parse all the action types in SUSI Response from SUSI Server correctly.

**Do you want to work on this?**
Yes, I am working on it.
