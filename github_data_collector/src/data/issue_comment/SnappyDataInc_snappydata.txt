Driver: __snappydata-jdbc_2.11-1.1.1__

It works on DataGrip 2019.1 (Java 8). But when I use (DataGrip 2019.2) Java 11, it doesn't work.

Error message:
```
Missing class Could not initialize class com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.shared.unsafe.UnsafeHolder$Wrapper.

Showing external hive metastore tables as part of HIVETABLES VTI

### Approach
Keeping a flag `hiveSessionInitialized` as part of the profile of the lead node
with the default value set to `false`.
When the hive session is initialized on the lead node, we set this flag to
`true` and distribute the updated profile.

When `SYS.HIVETABLES` VIT is executed on a server node, the server node checks
whether `hiveSessionInitialized` is set to `true` in lead's profile. If it is
set to `true` it executes `ExternalHiveTablesCollectorFunction` on the lead node
to fetch the metadata of hive tables available on external hive metastore.

`ExternalHiveTablesCollectorFunction` is only executed when
 `hiveSessionInitialized` is set to `true` to avoid unnecessary remote function
 call. 

 --- 
Note that server need to fetch these details from the leader node as the hive
  session is available only one leader.

## Patch testing

`precheckin -Pstore`
Manually tested. Will add automated coverage.
