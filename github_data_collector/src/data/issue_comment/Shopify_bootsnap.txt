When running `rspec` for an application for which a new `config/something.yml.example` file has been added, and some code expects that `config/something.yml` is present, an obscure error appears:

```
         13: from /Users/pirj/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.5.1@my_project/gems/bootsnap-1.4.5/lib/bootsnap/load_path_cache/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:22:in `require'

```
(scrubbed)

where the line that is fetching conf is:
```ruby
      @config = YAML.load_file(Rails.root.join(path)).deep_symbolize_keys[env]
```

WDYT of adding handling for this case to `lib/bootsnap/compile_cache/yaml.rb`:
```diff
          rescue Errno::EACCES
            Bootsnap::CompileCache.permission_error(path)
+           rescue => Errno::ENOENT
+             # Something explaining which file can't be found
          end
        end
```

I can send a pull request real quick but would appreciate if you suggest what should be raised and how since I'm not very familiar with the internals of Bootsnap.
Hey, when I am trying to run `rails server` I am getting the process aborted due to the following problem:

```
.rvm/gems/ruby-2.5.3@project-name/gems/bootsnap-1.3.2/lib/bootsnap/load_path_cache/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:32:in `require': cannot load such file -- dry/validation/schema/form (LoadError)
```

are you aware how can I fix it? Google does not provide and useful ideas.

I am running on Mac OS Catalina 10.15.1 - I had some kernel related issue with the curb gem, where I had to upgrade it from 0.9.3 to 0.9.10. Maybe this case is somehow related. Since I am not a backend developer, I can only guess what’s going on here.
If you're using Spring with Bootsnap, Spring requires ```fileutils``` via gem name (i.e. ```require 'fileutils'```, which in turn, always loads the latest version installed. Bootsnap requires ```fileutils``` [directly from the ruby lib dir](https://github.com/Shopify/bootsnap/blob/b2b30b3119cad30210fd803db6ddc8a68858ff20/lib/bootsnap/load_path_cache/store.rb#L4), which can cause ```already initialized constant FileUtils::``` if you have multiple versions installed.

For example, on my system I have the following versions installed:

```fileutils (1.4.1, default: 1.1.0)```

Spring will load ```v1.4.1```, and Bootsnap will load ```v1.1.0```.

Any suggestions? Or maybe Bootsnap should check if the ```FileUtils``` constant is already loaded before trying to require it? Thanks for your time.

**Update 1**

This really has nothing to do with Spring, it just so happens it uses ```fileutils``` and it's run before Bootsnap.
I decided to keep up the momentum with #277 and create a tenative pull request with my proposed changes to load path cache.

This includes:
- Additional option to exclude some path to try them as potential load path to scan
- New module in C to replace `Dir.glob`. It is both faster and easier on memory - unlike `Dir.glob` creating a large array and then iterating it, it yields with every found path and does path exclusion on C level.
- Extending TravisCI matrix to test both with this new extension and without

I tested those changes against Discourse, but without significant speedup:

|                     | cold | warm |
|---------------------|------|------|
| no exclusions, Ruby | 3.49 | 3.19 |
| no exclusions, C    | 3.48 | 3.2  |
| exclusions, Ruby    | 3.62 | 3.13 |
| exclusions, C       | 3.48 | 3.15 |

However, with my internal project with **a lot** of javascript (webpacker etc.), caching etc. savings are significant:

|                     | cold |       | warm |       |
|---------------------|------|-------|------|-------|
| no exclusions, Ruby | 9.45 | 0%    | 8.5  | 0%    |
| no exclusions, C    | 9.02 | 4.5%  | 7.94 | 6.5%  |
| exclusions, Ruby    | 8.49 | 10.1% | 6.83 | 19.6% |
| exclusions, C       | 6.92 | 26.7% | 6.86 | 19.2% |

**Legend:**
- cold - with load path cache purged (`rm tmp/cache/bootsnap-load-path-cache`)
- warm - with load path cache present and no changes to the files

I'm not the best C programmer (or even mediocre one), so to use this new C extension one must set environment variable `BOOTSNAP_EXPERIMENTAL`. This way people with project in dire need to speed up can experimentally use this, while most of the people can safely use existing version.

Let me know what you think about this direction.
I noticed that 2.5 out of 10 seconds of my application's startup time after requiring bootsnap is consumed by `Bootsnap::LoadPathCache::PathScanner.call`. By tracking the issue down, I found that it checks more than 150000 files that `Dir.glob(path + ALL_FILES)` returns. Most of those files are `node_modules`, cache files and compiled assets.

This is obviously unnecessary. By simply hardcoding skipping of those path I gained 20-25% less of application boot time. I was wondering how this can be parameterized without actually overwriting part of Bootsnap code. 

"All-in" approach would be writing a C extension that would only return those paths that are not explicitly excluded from load path optimization instead of `Dir.glob`. I have some preliminary (working) result here: https://github.com/Shopify/bootsnap/compare/master...katafrakt:dir-walker?expand=1

Lighter approach would be to just `next if excluded_paths.any? {|ep| absolute_path.start_with?(ep)}` to the block inside `Dir.glob.each`, but of course this would be a bit less performant (I don't know how much less).

What are your thoughts about this issue?
my project has many large migration files.
stack level too deep error occurs when executed 'RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake app:setup'
but not repro comment out "require 'bootsnap'" and Bootsnap.setup in boot.rb

Thank you
Since upgrading our Rails app to 5.2.3 a few months ago and introducing Bootsnap (currently using v1.4.4), I have intermittent issues with `User` and `Admin` namespaces not found after starting the rails server on my dev machine and visiting our `/login`, `/signup` or `/admin` routes. The workaround is to reload the page or restart the server and eventually I'm able to visit those pages. The errors do not occur in test and production environments. 

Below is an example of error trace:

Github:https://github.com/Zeesui/app_7
In vanilla MRI, if you `require` a file via absolute path, which is also present on `$LOAD_PATH`, MRI internally caches it under its *relative* path, and will allow it to satisfy future `require "relative/path"` calls, even if such a call would otherwise resolve to a file earlier in `$LOAD_PATH`.

`bootsnap` does not properly implement this behavior, resulting in a difference in behavior versus MRI's `require`, which turned out to break our application. This is honestly an odd behavior for us to be relying on and I'm going to attempt to work around it locally, but I wanted to report the bug for visibility.

This behavior is [rather unclear](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.1/Kernel.html#method-i-require) to me from the Ruby documentation, and arguably this could be reported as an MRI bug instead.

I've built a simple reproducer that demonstrates different behavior under `bootsnap` and without here: https://github.com/nelhage-stripe/bootsnap-reproducer
## Summary

I have a cache path problem during test: the cache path generated by bootsnap seems randomly.

This is occurred only in Debian packaging environment, this might not an bootsnap issue.

Could you give some clue for solving this failure? Which thing makes the cache path randomly?

## Problem

Hi,

when I build this gem with Debian package build tools (`dpkg-buildpackage`, `sbuild`, `pbuilder`, etc..), I got two test failures:

```diff
  1) Failure:
CompileCacheTest#test_invalid_cache_file [/<<PKGBUILDDIR>>/test/compile_cache_test.rb:106]:
Expected false to be truthy.

  2) Failure:
CompileCacheTest#test_no_write_permission_to_cache [/<<PKGBUILDDIR>>/test/compile_cache_test.rb:30]:
Bootsnap::CompileCache::PermissionError expected but nothing was raised.
```

I found that both unit tests use the path made by `Help.cache_path()` for testing (write to desired cache path, chmod the cache dir). However, cache path generated by `Help.cache_path()` and generated by bootsnap C extension are different.

More, I created a test unit to validate this mismatching problem more explicitly: #261. And failed:

```diff
  3) Failure:
HelperTest#test_validate_cache_path [/<<PKGBUILDDIR>>/test/helper_test.rb:10]:
Expected: true
  Actual: false
```

## Debugging logs

### Patch for debugging

For tracing how the caches going on, I added two patches for debugging.

This patch will add a function `Help.list_dir(dir)` on `test_helper.rb` to get a recursive `dir` directory listing.
```diff
--- a/test/test_helper.rb
+++ b/test/test_helper.rb

+          Dir["#{dir}/**/*"]
+        end
       end
     end
   end
```

This patch will raise a failure intentionally to print a `@tmp_dir` recursive listing using above `Help.list_dir()` on `compile_cache_test.rb` tests:
 - `test_no_write_permission_to_cache`
 - `test_invalid_cache_file`

#### Wrap up

In test `CompileCacheTest#test_invalid_cache_file`,
`Help.cache_path()` always output `6a/d393827a0ba05a` for all three times.
but when real cache created with `load(path)`, its locations always differ:
- first try: `b9/89185a0bb8068d`
- second try: `6c/dfdbe912ff1cc2`
- third try: `27/aa596602ef1f94`

Also same in test `CompileCacheTest#test_no_write_permission_to_cache`:
- first try: `d3/0b50628b49ab28`
- second try: `8f/7b80d46d6c834f`
- third try: `5c/941b7578d240a1`

## Question

This is occurred only in Debian packaging environment, this might not an bootsnap issue. For solving this problem, I have to know which part of bootsnap code affect this issue.

Could you give some clue for solving this failure?

Which thing makes the cache path randomly? Could the cache path affected by any arguments? or C extensions build arguments?

Thank you!
