Hi,
This is not an issue but a question. There is no other way to ask a question.

Why you did not use an MediatorLiveData instead of observing 3 differents LiveData like you do:
       ` viewModel.isLoadingLiveData.observe(this, Observer<Boolean> {
            it?.let { vRefresh.isRefreshing = it }
        })`
       `viewModel.reposLiveData.observe(this, Observer<List<Repo>> {
            it?.let { adapter.dataSource = it }
        })` 
        `viewModel.throwableLiveData.observe(this, Observer<Throwable> {
            it?.let { Snackbar.make(rv, it.localizedMessage, Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG).show() }
        }).` 

You could add those 3 different source inside the mediatorLiveData and thus observing one livedata in the your activity/fragment.


There was a toast error message. Sorry, I didn't see anything in logs. Had no time to look into it in details.
