gem imstall psd
can't install psd
Created PSD file(300dpi) using Adobe photoshop CC 2017 on windows machine. PSD file consists of list of Usertexts and their sizes 40pt, 24pt, 48pt. Using PSD parser read the font sizes i.e., 49px, 29px, 249px

Converted pixels to pts = (pixels*72)/300.

Final sizes **40** becomes **11.952**, **24** becomes **6.96**, **48** becomes **59.76**

Can you please help me out, why the font sizes were not getting matched.


Hello. 

Thanks for this great tool.

I'm trying to parse a text layer and generate HTML. But I can`t find - how to get position styles in text?
For example
I have text:

`[Test 1] [Test 2]`

Test 1 has a **green** color
Test 2 has a **red** color

_How can I get a boundary of each color?_

For example:
For **green** color
Start 0 position in text
End 6 position in text

For **red** color
Start 8 position in text
End 13 position in text
Thanks

Shouldn't it be `>=`? Or just else?
Hi, this plugin is cool for parse the psd layer,

I am thinking if this good plugin could manage the layer, for example, replace the text layer.
When trying to use the psd gem I get this error:

in `to_specs': Could not find 'nokogiri' (~> 1.5.0) - did find: [nokogiri-1.6.8-x64-mingw32](Gem::MissingSpecVersionError)

The 1.6.8 version of nokogiri is not supported?

Is there any way to distinguish artboards from groups?
Looking at the psd.tree.to_hash, they both appear as "group"

I'm reading some PSDs and when i try to get the font I get this, instead of the color and family font, I get empty values

```
        psd.tree.descendant_layers.each do |l|
          next unless l.text
                      l.type.styles # {}
                     l.text # {
      :value => "www.websiteforge.com\n",
       :font => {
      :name => nil,
     :sizes => [],
    :colors => [
      [0] [
        [0] 0,
        [1] 0,
        [2] 0,
        [3] 255
      ]
    ],
       :css => "font-family: ;\nfont-size: pt;\ncolor: rgba(0, 0, 0, 255);"
  },
       :left => 0,
        :top => 0,
      :right => 0,
     :bottom => 0,
  :transform => {
    :xx => 1.0,
    :xy => 0.0,
    :yx => 0.0,
    :yy => 1.0,
    :tx => 84.0,
    :ty => 565.0
  }
}


        end
```

this is the sample psd https://www.dropbox.com/s/0bb8k8zgnqukpz2/textos.psd?dl=0

I have the following ruby script:

``` ruby
require 'psd'
psd = PSD.new('dusk.psd')
psd.parse!
psd.tree.filter_by_comp('Layer Comp 1').save_as_png('./Version A.png')
```

The script takes over 11 minutes to complete and the output image is vastly different than what the layer comp looks like in PS

I don't have a lot of Ruby experience and am unsure how to debug or even look into whats going on. I added `PSD.debug = true` and saw lots of output but nothing seemed to jump out.

"'Layr', 'Lr16' and 'Lr32' start at See Layer info. " writted in http://www.adobe.com/devnet-apps/photoshop/fileformatashtml/#50577409_pgfId-1031423. But you write 

``` ruby
if %w(Lr16 Lr32 Mt16).include?(key)
```

in `layer_mask.rb`.  
I think something may be wrong here.

Thanks :)
