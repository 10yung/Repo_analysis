I am confused with the viriable 'response_up' in 'disp_in_xcrop = disp_in_area * float(tot_stride) / response_up',in addition,what is the reason for calculating the distance like this.Can you explain it?


The tracking results give four values, while the groundtruth is eight. How to judge whether the result is good or badï¼Ÿ
Hi Luca. Thanks for your work!

I would like to fine tune your pre-trained Imagenet weights using my smallish video data. Approximately how many videos and frame pairs would I need to get good results? 

Also, is there any reason why you did not use negative pairs in your training?
```
Undefined function or variable 'vl_imreadjpeg'.

Error in vid_image_stats (line 35)
        imgs = vl_imreadjpeg(files, 'numThreads', 12);
```
There seems to be no such a function `vl_imreadjpeg` defined neither in matlab nor in source code. 
How do you fix it?
Hi! Thank you for your contribution.
When I trained the network, I have a problem that "Error using vl_nnbnorm
operator(): operator():

Error in dagnn.BatchNorm/backward (line 29)
        vl_nnbnorm(inputs{1}, params{1}, params{2}, derOutputs{1}, ...

    [net, stats] = cnn_train_dag(net, imdb, batch_fn, opts.train);

How to solve it? Thank you very much!
Hi, 

Thanks for providing this helpful codebase. I am trying to use imagenet video dataset also, and I might have to implement a python  version since I use python in my project. I do not understand the details of this codebase. Will the code generate image chips with the objects in their centers, and will the generated chips be fixed in their sizes?

With the siamese-fc v1 code, the file named "arch.dot" is missing. Where could I download it?
Thanks. 

I use matconvert-1.0-beta20 and matlab 2017a,cudn9.0.
When i run run_experiment(imdb_video),the error message that appears is as follows:

Hi, 

In your tracking code, a parameter called 'wInfluence' is set to 0.176. I know it aims at control the influence of consine window. I want to know why the numeric is 0.176? Is it a hyper-parameter need to adjust by experiments?

Thanks.
Hi, 
I start training the siamese-fc, but I have some questions about the training process.

1. I want to know the differents between eltwise_label and label.
2. Another question is that how long do you train the model on one Titan X?
3. The last question, in your paper you say each epoch is consist of 50000 sampled pairs, but in your code each epoch contain 5985 * 8 = 47880 train data and 665 * 8 = 5320 val data. The sum of 47880 and 5320 is not equal to 50000. I guess maybe you have some change on your code after the paper, or what?

Thank you very much.
