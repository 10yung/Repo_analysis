Hey, this is my absolute favorite todo list and I'd really like to encourage the development of some features that I (and probably many others) desperately need. Is there a way to create monetary incentives in form of bounties for issues?


@aziz I would also love to know if you are interested in giving other people maintenance or even ownership rights or if you would rather have people fork the project?
The Readme lists the "header_to_task" attribute, which "If true, a project title line will be converted to a task on the certain keystroke". There's no documentation on what this keystroke is or how to set it. Being able to convert a task to a project or a project to a task would be quite useful, which seems like this is the intended purpose of this attribute.
Thanks for the very nice work! I come here in search of a substitution of Taskpaper when I'm not on my mac, and intend to use both interchangeably.
I wonder is there some secret user setting to replace the tag @started in PlainTasks with @start, which is what Taskpaper use for counting days spent, etc. In the worst case I can find-replace upon opening and closing the file, but I'm hoping I can avoid that.
When you have a TODO file open and you browse the available color schemes in Sublime, you can see the plaintask colors changing on the fly and adapting to the currently selected scheme. You can see this behaviour here : https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/f84e8p2roxcs31e/GkX6TUKXso.mp4

However, when you actually switch to a color scheme it reverts to the default theme or the one specified in the configuration file.

Is it possible to use no color scheme at all and instead adapt to whatever scheme is being used in Sublime? I tried setting the `color_scheme` property in settings to nothing but then there was no highlighting at all. If you remove the key completely then it just uses the default theme

Filter by tag also folds (some of the) abovelying project titles.

Is this a bug? Or am I misunderstanding it?

It would be great to add support for opening http(s) links or basically opening any schema links (ftp://, file:///, etc.)?

You could use the same shortcut (ctrl+o). What do you think?
It will be nice to have this extension in VS Code.  Nothing in VS Code comes close to this one.  ToDo+ is similar but missing some features.  
This is minor, but the link to your introduction screencast ends with 'video unavailable'.
It appears that the statistics at the bottom (ie, overall document statistics) don't get updated when you remove task items, until you take focus off the document then return to it.

For example, if I have 3 out of 10 tasks marked as done the bottom statistics will say, "3/10 done (30%)".  But if I remove two of them, it doesn't update the statistics until I switch to another document or application the come back to it.  At that point it'll say, "3/8 done (37%)".

Given that those statistics get updated immediately when adding new tasks, I'd think they're intended to work the same way when removing tasks.
