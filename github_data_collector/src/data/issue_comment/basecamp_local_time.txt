When using `%Z` format specifier, some abbreviations are not the same as in abbreviation tables such as: https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/.

For instance, Alaska Daylight Time should be abbreviated as `AKDT` and instead is showing as `ADT` which is Atlantic Daylight time.

Gem version used: 2.0.1

Steps to reproduce:
1. Include `<%= local_time(Time.now, format: "%I:%M %p %Z") %>` in a test view.
2. Force a geolocation using the browser's dev tools. Use Location name: Anchorage, Lat: 61.2181, Long: -149.9003, Timezone ID: America/Anchorage (In Chrome this is done by opening Dev tools and selecting (settings)>>more tools >> sensors, and then click on `add location`)

my requirement of adding this from js , so how to use local_time_ago in js file and in controllers?
I have a non-english Rails app which use `local_time` gem:
```ruby
<%= local_time_ago(obj.created_at) %>
```
I am trying to localize it. On the client side, everything is working just fine. The text shows in my custom language. But on the first load of the page I get the english text (I guess this is the server side text?). How to set the locale of `local_time` gem on server side? I have already set `config.i18n.default_locale`
Not sure if this is a known issue (didn't find anything):

`= local_time(@batch.scheduled_for, "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M %Z")`

Works in Chrome:

but not in Firefox:

I don't think it makes a always makes sense to use a datetime format for the title attribute, since it might be confusing to users when it doesn't match the current format they are viewing.

In my case I happen to be displaying dates (days/months) and times (hours/minutes) separately so I find it more consistent to have the title only use the date or time format in these cases.

I'm open to making changes if you have any input.
