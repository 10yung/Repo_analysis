Hey! Thanks for your great repo on elk!
Had an issue when installing the logspout extension. We use udp to send data to logstash, but the port is opened only for tcp connections. This PR fixes that 

Hi,

I tried to enable the tls via default utility on free feature, but wasn't successful.  Could you create a simple tutorial for this?
Hey,

I was thinking it would be worth while to add a reference folder for logstash in docker-elk, which can display how one can connect to different data sources. This can act as different use cases for docker-elk and logstash.

For example, imagine if someone was using docker-elk and they wanted to connect to a database. It would be really nice if there was a folder to the effect of "logstash-references" in which they can open up and get direction on how to connect to a database using logstash, which would essentially make their workflow very efficient, imho.

I am still thinking this through, but thats the initial thought I had. 

Any other thoughts on this?
