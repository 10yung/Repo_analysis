Can you help to check if this is an invalid if statement and make the correction please?

Any idea what would be involved in getting this to work for a 3d space, so we could use this for controlling drones?
Hello,
I'd like to compile the zooidmanager on VS2017 Windows 10 but am having some errors.
Could you please offer some tips?
Thanks,
Michael
I don't know if it your duty. I think think there maybe a misspell in swarm@stanford websites.
But anyway I want to let you know:
_Tracking
Our system uses a projector-based tracking system for robot position tracking as shwon below. Using a high frame rate (3000Hz) projector (DLP LightCrafter) from Texas Instruments Inc., a # **swequence** of gray-coded patterns are projected onto a flat surface. Then, the photodiodes on the robot independently decodes into a location within the projected area. The instruction for setting up this projector-based tracking system is included in the repository._

swequence should be sequence?
How to make the touch sensor circuit. Or is it available at any online electronic stores?
Hello,What is the function of the projector? Do you need a special projector or an ordinary projector? Look forward to your reply, thanks.
anyone have found the seller?
I want to know how to charge the battery,looks like not so easy to do that,if we can use wireless charge technical,that will be more easy to use.

If I try to add that function to robot,how many you guys want to buy ? If the amount is nearly 500 pcs,it should be executable.

> a sequence of gray-coded patterns are projected onto a flat surface. Then, the photodiodes on the robot independently decodes into a location within the projected area.

If I am right, the projector just sends out a gray-coded pattern message (a map), it doesn't know the coordinates of the robots and it doesn't communicate with other parts . And the mini bots will use the photodiodes to get the pattern and decode the pattern to know where it is in the projected area (map). When it is received the command from the receiver, it will compare with the goal and its current coordinate decoded from the projector to adjust its tracks.

How the gray-coded pattern is generated and how mini bots can use photodiode to sense its location, is there any speciality about the photodiode on the bots?


Hi, 
When i try to run any of the project files, i get a load error referring to Software\libs\openFrameworksCompiled\, am I missing something fundamental here?

Hi, 
   I am a 7th grade Science teacher looking to make his classroom more exciting and interesting. I was wondering if someone would help me build these for my classroom. I can pay for the parts and the cost of using a 3d printer. I just am very limited in time and knowledge of robotics. Any help or information would be great
