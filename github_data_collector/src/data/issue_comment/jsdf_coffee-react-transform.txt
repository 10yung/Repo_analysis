So I actually want to make a code, which if I pressed a button it will auto-spawn a new box to type anything if there is no space or if the person wants to type another thing!

Like here : 
![untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36724017/36871556-ad3c7a68-1db3-11e8-8b72-796a68318d22.png)

We're using this compiler in our app and leaving coffee-script for the semicolon-braces hell looks like a very unappealing option. Does anyone know any good forks/alternatives? Or maybe there are people who are willing to maintain it?

When I'm writing a custom component, I simply cannot use curly braces/brackets to evaluate an expression.

The following code won't compile/transform:

``` cjsx
App = React.createClass
  render: ->
    {@props.children}
```

CoffeeLint and CJSX itself throw the following error:

```
[stdin]:6:12: error: unexpected . at line 6 col 5
```

Quick and dirty fix for #47. This removes whitespace and newlines around an escape character when an escape character is present, replacing it with a single space. I'm using this currently and it does the job, but I'm positive that there is a better way to do this.

I implemented this because I didn't have too much time to dig into how the parser works. I'd imagine it'd be better to just skip over this type of escape so that the transformed output correctly compiles.

As per CoffeeScript's default behavior of evaluating statements, I was surprised to find that the following statements within a spread operator result in the CJSX error: `SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input: unclosed CJSX_EL`

```
render: ->
  <SomeComponent {...{foo: "bar"}}/>
```

```
render: ->
  foo = "bar"
  <SomeComponent {...{foo}}/>
```

```
render: ->
  foo = "bar"
  <SomeComponent {...({foo})}/>
```

```
render: ->
  foo = "bar"
  <SomeComponent {...(do -> {foo})}/>
```

Expected output is for a structured assignment of `{ foo: foo }` and passing that result to the spread method.

I really want to use coffeescript again but I am using the modules beta dev of Meteor. 

This means I can import pacakges and such. 

But I am not sure if it will work with coffeescript. 

Any idea?

is there a meteor package that wraps this functionality to add to the meteor builds automatically?

This style of object creation appears to break with coffee-react-transform:

Noted this while using cjsx-loader, who's author delegated this issue here.

Without the comment, the following compiles and renders fine:

``` coffeescript
  x.IndexView = React.createClass
    displayName: "views.user.IndexView"

    render: () ->
      return (
        <div className="user-indexview">
          <h1>Say Hello to React.js</h1>
          <R.Collection collectionClass={App.models.user.Users} fetch={true}>
              {# this is a comment }
              <div className="test">
                <R.CollectionStats/>
              </div>
          </R.Collection>
        </div>
      )
```

With the comment, I get a "SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input: unclosed CJSX_ESC"

I've also seen this error show up on the outermost component if one of the inner components has an unmatched tag.
