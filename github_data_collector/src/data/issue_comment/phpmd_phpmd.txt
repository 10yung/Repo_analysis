- PHPMD version: 2.8.1
- PHP Version: 7.2.24
- Installation type: composer
- Operating System / Distribution & Version: Kubuntu 19.04

### Current Behavior
False-positive message "Avoid using undefined variables" on short list assignment
```php
[$abc, $def] = [1, 2];
```

### Expected Behavior
Recognize assignment via shot list syntax

### Steps To Reproduce:
sample code is above
- PHPMD version: 2.8.1
- PHP Version: 7.4.1
- Installation type: composer
- Operating System / Distribution & Version: Debian Buster

### Current Behavior

The violation `UndefinedVariable`  does not contain `externalInfoUrl` in its element like this:

```xml
<pmd version="@project.version@" timestamp="2020-01-08T10:31:06+00:00">
  <file name="/tmp/test.php">
    <violation beginline="3" endline="3" rule="UndefinedVariable" ruleset="Clean Code Rules" priority="3">
      Avoid using undefined variables such as '$x' which will lead to PHP notices.
    </violation>
  </file>
</pmd>
```

### Expected Behavior

I expect the output below:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<pmd version="@project.version@" timestamp="2020-01-08T10:31:15+00:00">
  <file name="/tmp/test.php">
    <violation beginline="3" endline="3" rule="UndefinedVariable" ruleset="Clean Code Rules" externalInfoUrl="https://phpmd.org/rules/cleancode.html#undefinedvariable" priority="3">
      Avoid using undefined variables such as '$x' which will lead to PHP notices.
    </violation>
  </file>
</pmd>
```

### Steps To Reproduce:

Prepare the file `test.php`:

```php
<?php
function printX() {
    echo $x;
}
```

And, then run the following command:

```shell-session
$ phpmd test.php xml cleancode
```

I think the following patch resolves the issue, but I'm not sure this exactly works.

The last signed version is 2.7.0, which makes it the default version installed by phive. Maybe you can add signatures to the 2.8.0 and 2.8.1 releases?
_-_ PHPMD version: 2.8.1

### Current Behavior
False-positive message "Avoid unused local variables" on passing var by reference

```
public function getFlowsFromBot(&$childs, &$flows = [])
    {
        foreach ($childs as $key => &$child) {
            $flows[$child['tag']] = $childs[$key]['text'];
            $this->getFlowsFromBot($child['child_nodes'], $flows);
        }
        return $flows;
    }
```
give me an error on $childs on line 3,4 and 5

### Expected Behavior
Recognize passing variables by reference

### Steps To Reproduce:
Just run phpmd

### Current Behavior
The undefined variable rule does not pick up parameters passed into a method of an anonymous class. This is very likely related to #714.

```php
final class FooChecker
{
    public function getChecker()
    {
        return new class() {
            public function checkFoo(User $user): bool
            {
                // Avoid using undefined variables such as $user
                return $user->addFailedLoginAttempt() > 1;
            }
        };
    }
}
```

### Expected Behavior
`$user` is defined in the above example, so it should not produce an undefined variable error.

### Steps To Reproduce:
Run the undefined variable rule over the above example

## Description

Ale from Code Climate here, we usually use the txt docs to pull down documentation for the rules. For example: http://phpmd.org/rules/cleancode.txt. I just noticed that these links are not longer accessible. Were they moved? or no longer available on txt format? 


- PHPMD version: 2.8.0
- PHP Version: 7.2.25
- Installation type: composer
- Operating System / Distribution & Version: Debian 9.6

### Current Behavior
The new feature "Undefined Variable Rule" introduced in https://github.com/phpmd/phpmd/pull/497 
 is not working with **static** class variables, such as 
```php
class CmsBlock
{
    protected static $cmsBlockBuffer = [];

    protected function getCmsBlockById(string $cmsBlockKey): array
    {
        if (isset(static::$cmsBlockBuffer[$cmsBlockKey])) {
            return static::$cmsBlockBuffer[$cmsBlockKey];
        }
     
        return static::$cmsBlockBuffer[$cmsBlockKey] = $this->findCmsBlockByKey($cmsBlockKey);
    }
}
```
PhpMd triggers error message `Avoid using undefined variables such as '$cmsBlockBuffer' which will lead to PHP notices.`

### Expected Behavior
No error messages.

### Steps To Reproduce:
Explain **all** the steps you did to create this bug so we can reproduce it.
