I've recently been using cartographer for localization testing and I have seen an issue on multiple maps that I tested. When going down a narrow hallway, usually not in the first pass through the area, everything will look fine until suddenly the whole hallway rotates (as seen in the image below, compared to the map generated from the mapping operation):

![Screenshot from 2020-01-07 08-28-20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10501245/71899378-8f8ca200-3129-11ea-9772-9aa95dadac7b.png)

I have been able to tune the localizer so that the map will eventually fix itself, but I am interested in preventing this issue from arising in the first place. From what I can tell it seems to be heavily influenced by the motion filter, but I have not been able to determine the root cause of the issue.

Here is a link where you will find the config and bag files that I have been working with
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gOdvxIwmYqBTH9R--FGvBOWrE4GRrR9v

I would appreciate any help you can give in figuring out the cause of this issue.

Hello,
I am trying to tune three parameters in trajectory_builder_2d.lua, they are  TRAJECTORY_BUILDER_2D.ceres_scan_matcher.translation_weight, TRAJECTORY_BUILDER_2D.ceres_scan_matcher.rotation_weight, TRAJECTORY_BUILDER_2D.submapsnum_range_data.

I learned that the size of the submap should be ten to thirty seconds of data. The more I trust the odometry data, the larger translation_weight should be.  And The more I trust the IMU data, the larger rotation_weight should be.  Is it right?

But I am in trouble. How to judge the accuracy of the odometry data and the imu data? Is there any parameter from cartographer to help me?

Thanks for your help!
Incompatible flag --incompatible_no_implicit_file_export will be enabled by default in a future Bazel release [1], thus breaking Cartographer.

The flag is documented here: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10225

Please check the following CI builds for build and test results:

* <a href="https://buildkite.com/bazel/bazelisk-plus-incompatible-flags/builds/361#0dcb3075-1ea6-4486-8dc4-3b47b87b2bc5" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildkite/emojis/master/img-buildkite-64/ubuntu.png" height="16"/>Ubuntu 16.04, OpenJDK 8</a>

Never heard of incompatible flags before? We have [documentation](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/backward-compatibility.html) that explains everything.

If you don't want to receive any future issues for Cartographer or if you have any questions,
please file an issue in https://github.com/bazelbuild/continuous-integration

**Important**: Please do NOT modify the issue title since that might break our tools.

[1] The target release hasn't been determined yet. Our tool will update the issue title once the flag flip has been scheduled.

I found that in earlier versions the imu data was processed by kalman filters, but now it's gone. Why? Kalman filters work badly? Thank you very much.
I am trying to test cartographer_ros on my simulation environment. Cartographer compiles correctly on my pc. However, when I tried to run the given demo launch file: demo_backpack_2d.launch; this is the log:

My current protobuf version is 3.4.0, I do not know if this is useful or not. Rviz just shows a frozen screen of laser scan, which is attached below. Is there any suggestions on this problem?

Thanks in advance.
