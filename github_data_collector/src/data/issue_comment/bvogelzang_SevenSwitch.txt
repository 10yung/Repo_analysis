Sources updated to Swift 4.2
Added xcodeproject (shared scheme) to allow installation via Carthage 
issue
Hi, I liked using your component so I thought it would be nice to give it a bit of fresh air so I did two improvements.

- renamed `on` property to `isOn` so it has the same interface as `UISwitch`
- restructured project so it is now available via **Carthage**
When the `thumbTintColor` option is changed during runtime, only the off state thumb tint color actually changes because the `userDidSpecifyOnThumbTintColor` is updated to `true` during initialization because it is set by the `willSet` closure of `thumbTintColor`. I think this is a bug because the `onThumbTintColor` is not listed in the properties in the README, and likewise nowhere does it document that both properties must be updated in order to make a color change to the `thumbView`'s color.

`thumbImageView` is a subview of `thumbView` but its `frame.x` coordinate calculated relative to switch control. Error positioning could be seen if you add following code to example projects file `ViewController.swift` at line 26.
```
mySwitch.thumbImage = UIImage( named: "cross" )
```


Please see my question here for details about the problem:

Hello,

I have noticed a bug: when adding switch in storyboard to scroll view, the switch initially moves in wrong direction for half a second. Below is a screenshot presenting the situation:

â€¦, on/off Text Size and on/off Text Style which makes it bold or not.

Adds delegate protocol and notification when switch animation is finished.
