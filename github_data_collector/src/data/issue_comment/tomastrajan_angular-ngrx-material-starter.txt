Hi, when I try to use a simple `mat-icon` element the icon does not show up. Would you tell me what I need to override so that I can use a normal `mat-icon` like this:

`<mat-icon>home</mat-icon>`

The reason why I need to use normal `mat-icons` is that when trying to use the Angular Material's stepper the edit icons that the stepper uses don't show up as they should.

Thank you.

## Minimal reproduction of the bug with instructions:
color selection is not honored by `big-input-action` element. 
```
<button mat-raised-button color="color" [disabled]="disabled" (click)="onClick()">
  <mat-icon *ngIf="fontSet && fontIcon && !faIcon" [fontSet]="fontSet" [fontIcon]="fontIcon"></mat-icon>
  <fa-icon *ngIf="faIcon" [icon]="faIcon"></fa-icon>
  <span *ngIf="label">{{label}}</span>
</button>
```
## Expected behavior:
I should be able to set different colors for different actions. I think it should be
```
<button mat-raised-button [color]="color" [disabled]="disabled" (click)="onClick()">
  <mat-icon *ngIf="fontSet && fontIcon && !faIcon" [fontSet]="fontSet" [fontIcon]="fontIcon"></mat-icon>
  <fa-icon *ngIf="faIcon" [icon]="faIcon"></fa-icon>
  <span *ngIf="label">{{label}}</span>
</button>
```

## Minimal reproduction of the bug with instructions:
As normal, when we call `window.scrollTop(0,0)`, browser will scroll to top. Or for simple, when scroll bottom of page, open console and call  `window.scrollTop(0,0)`, current page will scroll to top.

## Expected behavior:
Browser will scroll to expected location.

Hi,

On changing route page is showing from bottom it should be from start(Top).

I have tried for fix but still I it's not fixed. can you help please?

my code is here in app.routing.module.ts

```
RouterModule.forRoot(routes, {
      useHash: false,
      preloadingStrategy: PreloadAllModules,
      initialNavigation: 'enabled',
      scrollPositionRestoration: 'enabled'
    })
```
Fixed the animations for the router transitions which are broken in Safari and Edge because a inline style from the animation "position: fixed" was not properly removed.

Closes: #495
Closes: #493
Hello. I have spend my entire day trying to launch the protractor test in "debug".
ideally I would like to debug it from visual studio but I did not manage.
I tried both ways from the accepted answer on stackoverflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54016095/how-to-debug-protractor-in-vs-code
I also looked at this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aPfHrSl0Qk&t=1208s

I really lost my day today... Any help would be really appreciated.

## Minimal reproduction of the bug with instructions:
Just open the demo app in Edge: elements overlaps among them and layout is completely messed up. Cannot test on Safari, please verify yourself.

Line affected:
https://github.com/tomastrajan/angular-ngrx-material-starter/blob/425bdb831fabc70a03ef7f213b815a43994384dc/projects/angular-ngrx-material-starter/src/app/core/animations/route.animations.ts#L15

## Other information:
To fix in Edge, changing the style _position_ to `static` or `relative` will fix the layout and the scroll.
Because `position: fixed` helps a lot in Chrome and Firefox during the page transition: it skips pre-scrolling (or jumping), we should intercept if it is Edge at change the position value to something else:
``` typescript
query(':enter > *', style({ opacity: 0, position: isIEOrEdge ? 'relative' : 'fixed' }), {
```
Hi, why are the versions of the packages part of environment file https://github.com/tomastrajan/angular-ngrx-material-starter/blob/425bdb831fabc70a03ef7f213b815a43994384dc/projects/angular-ngrx-material-starter/src/environments/environment.test.ts#L9

They don't really change between the environments do they?
