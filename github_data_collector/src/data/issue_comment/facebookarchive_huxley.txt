Hi,

I am getting below error when trying to run the demo itself.

URLError: urlopen error [Errno 10061] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it

Please help.

I created a repos named [page-monitor](https://github.com/fouber/page-monitor) last year, it can catch the diff between two version of a page, based on dom tree diff, and markup the diff one the screenshots, it can also recognize style changed, content changed, element added or element removed, and you can configure the capture options to filter some elemes.
### Element Add

### Element Removed

![](https://github.com/fouber/page-monitor/blob/master/demo/1409037838093-1409037882033.png?raw=true)
### Content Changed

### Style Changed

I hope it could help with this project.

That one's still maintained by me.

my project includes a div containing flashplayer and I got the following error. Are you supporting flash or do I have different problem?

I am getting this error during the playback. I successfully recorded a case and taking 3 picture by `huxley --record` then quit and trying to check on firefox as following:

In record mode, I entered my login details, clicked the log in button, and performed some interactions with the application.

However, during the first "playback", where Huxley makes sure the screenshots taken second-time around are correct, each time the console output reaches the shift key (for characters in the password), it prints `Typing ►`, and in the WebDriver browser, a print dialog appears, stopping the playback.

The shift key is also not applied to the character being typed, so the password was wrong in the playback.

I've just downloaded Huxley on Windows 8.1, and added a Huxleyfile to my project. After some tussling with Firefox and Selenium versions, I finally got Huxley to launch a browser. However, when I go back to the command line and hit Enter to take a screenshot, Huxley crashes with the following error:

```
