Hi, 
Thank you for your very helpful work. 
I successfully used it to call a matlab script from a pyhton program. 
However, as soon as I include the MATLAB command "importdata", I got an error. 
I copy below the complete error message: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./solver.py", line 72, in <module>
    print solve_it(input_data)
  File "./solver.py", line 19, in solve_it
    print mlab.run('test.m', {'address': sys.argv})['result']
  File "/Users/tbegin/Desktop/Discrete-Optimization/knapsack/pymatbridge/**init**.py", line 87, in run
    result = self._open_page(self.eval_func, page_args)
  File "/Users/tbegin/Desktop/Discrete-Optimization/knapsack/pymatbridge/__init__.py", line 94, in _open_page
    return json.loads(page.read())
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/json/__init__.py", line 338, in loads
    return _default_decoder.decode(s)
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/json/decoder.py", line 365, in decode
    obj, end = self.raw_decode(s, idx=_w(s, 0).end())
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/json/decoder.py", line 383, in raw_decode
    raise ValueError("No JSON object could be decoded")
ValueError: No JSON object could be decoded

Hope you can help me with that.

Happy to put in some images with it too if you'd like them:

Hi, first of all many thanks for sharing this project, a really great idea, especially useful when trying to switch from matlab to python but still having many old routines in matlab.
I just had a go, everything went smoothly until I entered mlab.start()
Then I cannot see my input commands any more (nothing that I type appear at the screen, just the error messages). Even after I quit (i)python, the terminal remains unusable.
The test.py example runs smoothly though. Any idea where that could come from?

Hello,

This looks like a very useful library and I would very much like to take advantage of it. However, I am having a problem getting it working. I am logging into a unix server via ssh. The server has installed 64 bit python version 2.6.5 and 64 bit matlab version 8.0.0.783. I start python and run the following commands:

from pymatbridge import Matlab
MLAB = Matlab(matlab='path_to_matlab')
MLAB.start()

after which the console simply outputs ...still starting up... endlessly. path_to_matlab is the path to the matlab executable, obtained by running 'which matlab'. Any idea what could be going wrong?

Thank you very much.

It seems this package doesn't run on windows?
