I have, accidentally, reinstalled mono-complete because I got an error when using sudo mono nuget.exe restore and now I get this error:
`The folder '/home/stijn' does not contain an msbuild solution or packages.config file to restore.`
I have no idea what to do and I am sorry if I am a bit vague but I am completely new to mono and the like.
Thanks in advance,
Adutchman


**System information**
 - KDE Neon 5.17 based on Ubuntu 18.04

 - log files: not applicable, I do not know where to find the right log files for mono
I have a nbfc and I could control the cpu fan with the configuration HP Notebook 15-ba010ng, but the GPU fan doesn't control. I read the other issues about it and that moment don't the way for fix it.

Excuse me for my poor English, because I'm Colombia and my native language is Spanish. 
**Config requests*
Fan speed could not been controlled with the values I found here online:
Asus Zenbook UX330UA.
I think I need another version or another notebook, it`s far too loud.

I created a new config & pasted the above values of the UX330 with notepad++ 
saved them. I was able to find the config UX330 in the software pull down menu:
After choosing that config, nothing happens with the fan,
also all other Asus Zenbook configs do not work!

also I cannot see the Current fan speed

Any idea to help me, thanks for that.
Thanks in advance
Is any of the available configuration files compatible with this laptop platform?

Need support for Dell Latitude 7480

**Deescribe the solution you'd like**
Config support for Dell Latitude 7480

Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.

Hey, I have asus zenbook 15 533FTC with i5-10210 processor, can't control anything on it.  Is comet lake processor supporting possible? Fans on my zenbook are very loud.


**Describe the wonderfulness**
The "Acer Predator G3-572" configuration works pretty well on "Acer Nitro 5 AN515-52-75Q8". The GPU and CPU fans behave pretty well on all applications I could see for now (casual usage, gaming and benchmark). The output of command "nbfc status" are particulary close to the reality and the fans looks to behave pretty well. I suggest you modify the critical temp to 75ÂºC. The fans are never turned off, as expected. As far I could see, the all application consumed about 50Mb of RAM! Well... If it is not the solution, at least will lead to the correct solution. I hope this helps other people to know understand the EC from the Acer Nitro 5 series, cos I dont. Hahaha

**To Reproduce**
Follow the guide presented on "https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc/wiki/First-steps" and pay attention to the NEW stable version of Mono and not from your repositories that may be outdated as mine was.

**Expected behavior**
Happiness

**System information**
 - Debian 10.2 XFCE (Buster stable)
 - NBFC 1.6.3.0.

My special thanks to all contributors.
