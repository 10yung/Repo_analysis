Hi there,

I've created a new Hybrid application in Visual Studio 2013 and copied the demo project over so that I can see the demo just fine in the emulator.  I would like to add another cordova plugin so that I can launch the application from a browser link, the plugin I have used is this one,

http://plugreg.com/plugin/EddyVerbruggen/LaunchMyApp-PhoneGap-Plugin

And I've added the following code to the bottom of app.js,

```
function handleOpenURL(url) {
    setTimeout(function () {
        alert("received url: " + url);
    }, 0);
}
```

I've also added the following scripts to the head tag of index.html (just under styles.css),

```
<script src="cordova.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/platformOverrides.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/index.js"></script>
```

So the actual problem is this

1:  If the app is _not_ running and I launch it from an URL it doesn't initialise correctly and I get a blank screen.
2.  If the app is already running in the state as in step 1. and I launch it from an URL it works correctly and I get my alert, plus the page renders

I'm not sure what's causing this but it's the second template engine I've tried that's done this.  

If anyone here has VS 2013 and the latest Hybrid App CTP, I also have a sample project.  Any ideas how to diagnose / fix this?

Thanks for your work.  It's very nice to see a minimal but working example. 

I have cloned your app in a repo and mucked around a bit with but I was wondering about licensing on it.  There is no license in the repo, nor can I find any licensing terms on the related blog.  

I think it is better to have catalog displaying some faces... In that way it is easier to say whether the app is working or not.

BTW: keen to learn better way to initially populate the list.

Some Android devices using Phonegap are unable to pull files correctly without the HTML dataType

Hi,

Is possible load correct page when someone type:

www.domain.com/contact 

this load

www.domain.com/#contact

Thanks

**api/index.php**  
need 'group by e.id' at the end of the sql string, while it has 'count(r.id)' in select part.

In the jquerymobile implementation the app is bootstrapped in main.js using 
`$(document).ready(function () { .. }`

However the JQM docs state clearly to not use $(document).ready() but use $(document).bind('pageinit') instead.

Is there any (good) reason why you are using $(document).ready()?

i just noticed this in the "web" version...minor bug

Here is another node backend for the backbone-directory sample, which works with the existing MySQL data store.  This node backend also serves up the required static files, so no additional web server is needed.
