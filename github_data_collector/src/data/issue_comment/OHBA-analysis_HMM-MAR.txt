I appreciate contributors for these codes. Nevertheless, I feel weird to set T. Following your guide, it is still unclear to me how to endow the "T". For instance, for the test, I used two participants with 350 time points alongside resting-state fMRI scanning and obtained a matrix for each one by using AAL-116 atlas (350 X 116). Then, I built up one cell to integrate them. However, I have no idea how to build a cell for "T" since no designs or trials are designated here. Any responses would be appreciated.  
Is there is a straightforward way to compile hidden_state_inference(_mx).cpp mex file on Windows?

Building it in mac and linux is well documented, but not on windows systems.  Tried contacting Giles Colclough but he is not academia anymore. Sorry to bother you for this trivial thing, but maybe you were asked already and have the solution at hand. I tried with working armadillo libraries (and openblas, arpack and lapack) but could not manage.

Thank you for your work and for your attention.
