I just found the website here: http://xing.github.io/wysihtml5/
I selected the first word after the headline ("wysihtml5") and made it red by hovering over the toolbar and clicking the red color.
There seems to be no way to turn it black again. (Ok, I can press Ctrl-Z, I can edit the HTML sourcecode, but both options feel like cheating. There should be a way to select text and make it black.)

A simple **black color** option in the color menu would help, but there is no black color in the menu.
is there any limitation? I can not post long text by using this editor.
Trying to use `check_attributes` `alt` but it adds `id=""` everywhere.
I'm getting `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'contentDocument' of undefined` in Android native and Google Chrome browser using wysihtml5 v0.3.0

Test device details:
SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 4
Chrome version 58.0.3029.83

It works fine on firefox.
Editor works properly and I can change heading style for any line . my issue is that I can't change header in the same line . each line only can get one heading style.

is there any solution for this issue?
Hi. 
How can I set Default text-align to right?
Hi! I was wondering, how do you add multiple rich text editors on one page?  I have the problem where if I have multiple rich text editors, the same text appears in both of the same boxes when I refresh the page, even if I typed different things.
I'm trying to create a rich text editor for a text section and a caption section. Is there something I'm doing wrong in the code below?

`$('iframe.wysihtml5-sandbox').contents().find('body').html(data.text.text);
$('iframe.wysihtml5-sandbox').contents().find('body').html(data.media.caption);`
I use bootstarp-wysihtml, Firefox browser in the input box input continuous spaces after or enter the number of words to certain length, use the backspace key, the input box will lose focus and need to click re input box to get the focus continued input. But that's normal in chrome.

My Firefox version is: 41.0.2

Here is a live demo. Using wysihtml5 in "div" is ok. But with textarea. The scroll bar stays on top, does not automatically scroll to bottom. Can you please help how to fix this? Thanks!!
