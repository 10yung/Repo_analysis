Some improvements to the existing Ukrainian localization:
* fixed some typos;
* rephrased existing translations;
* aligned some terms (e.g., label).
I have provided some necessary adjustments to the Swedish translations.

Kind regards,
Carl
Heya,

I saw someone over on [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/ProtonMail/comments/ebr1p4/add_protonmail_to_the_list_of_mail_apps_in/) asking why Protonmail doesn't support `mailto:` style links. I'd been looking to mess around with the iOS codebase and had some free time, so experimented with adding it.

From what I read on another issue you've got a refactor going on internally, so no worries if this doesn't fit right now - just wanted to throw it out there and open discussion on it. The reason something like this would be nice is that if it's supported, then Firefox on iOS could open `mailto:` links in Protonmail if the user chooses it in settings.

[I made the requisite changes in Firefox iOS already](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/firefox-ios/commit/5eaf47a5d6a1351f8b9ead124eb3251813f1031d), could pull request them over there if/when this is deemed okay over here.

Not 100% happy about the `Dispatch` delay hack but I didn't want to muck too much with altering the internal structure. Open to comments/critiques/etc for sure.

A simple test project can be drummed up by making a blank iOS project in Xcode, whitelisting `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` to include `protonmail`, and then dumping something like the following in `applicationDidFinishLaunching`:

``` swift
let url = URL(string: "protonmail://compose?to=ryan@venodesigns.net,ryan_fb@venodesigns.net&cc=bert@ryanmcgrath@protonmail.com&bcc=ryan@rymc.io&subject=lol&body=Hello%20thar")!

UIApplication.shared.open(url)
```

Hope it's useful!
**Describe the bug:**

I use mostly the app for my email, and most emails are incoming. From time to time, my account is logged out. That's fine, but the only way to know is to not get an email for a while (or to enter the app to send an email). 

**Live App Version:**

    1.1.13 (3971)

**Device + OS version**

iPhone SE,   iOS 13.2.3

**Can you reproduce the problem each time?**

Yes, but I can't control when I'm logged out (unless I've reset the password with the browser)

**Steps to reproduce the behavior:**

1. don't get any emails
2. enter the app and realize that I'm no longer logged in

**Expected behavior**

A notification saying that I must re-authenticate.

**Screenshots(If applicable)**

**Describe the bug:**
While using Protonmail this screen can occur https://mobile.twitter.com/flowinho/status/1184832592337612803

Dispite the wording I've seen many that consider themselves "cybersecurity experts" click through such messages on places like airport wifi without a thought.

Protonmail app should *not* prompt the user to disable TLS Validation.

in addition it should use certificate pinning, pinned to the CA you use and another.

**Device + OS version**
iPhone ...  iOS 11.
Hello,
It'll be good if you can build [Mac Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/) version to have ProtonMail app on macOS using iOS version.
Thanks
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Not a problem but modern mail apps all support conversation views and since we have it in the web app, would be nice to be consistent

**Describe the solution you'd like**
An option to group messages in the same conversation

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The iPad app doesn't make great use of the larger screen. I'd like to see a persistent 'always-on' sidebar like Apple's default Mail app, Yahoo! Mail app and Gmail app has.
**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be very helpful if a senders Gravatar (https://en.gravatar.com/) image displayed (if set) for users. Some other email clients support Gravatars (such as MailSpring).
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
No.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Modification to the "Mark as Unread" swipe action so that it toggles the state of the email between read and unread.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Alternatively, add an option for "Mark as Read" in the swipe actions menu that would allow users to swipe and mark a message as read without having to open the message.

**Additional context**
The Android version of your app has a swipe action that allows a user to swipe and mark an email as read without having to open it. The standard Apple Mail app has a swipe action that toggles the state between read and unread.
