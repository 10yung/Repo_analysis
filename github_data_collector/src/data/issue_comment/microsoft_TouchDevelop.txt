HI
I could not search and find any answer to this in the FAQ and help files.
Can someone direct me?
Thanks 
My students receive an error when we try to upload picture files. The error message says "We are having network problems..." My class on Friday morning had no issues, but my class Friday afternoon could not upload .png's or .jpg's. We're still experiencing this problem today.
when creating a comment with the following markdown:

    {enum:myParam:A,B,C}
and a parameter of a type that is not String creates a "Token" "N" "**a**" "N" with a parse Error
This is a minor bug as the program seems to be able to handle errors.

Some other bugs which crash the system and prevent the project from being able to open up again(but luckly can be fixed by using the project's history and set to a previous diff) is the use of 

    {hex}        //Cause: cannot splice undef error
    {snippet}    //
    {pub}        //Cause: cannot splice undef error
    {api}        //Cause: cannot splice undef error
    {sig}        //dido
    {fullsig}    //dido
    {bbc}        //dido

Also, on a side note, If I were to have a question that the current TouchDevelop Docs don't have documented(such as macros, plug-ins, T types, ect.), were can I ask it?

When I start phonegap windows(Universal Apps)  in release or debug mode getting

> Canâ€™t load the ActiveX plug-in that has the class ID '{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11CF-96B8-444553540000}'. Apps can't load ActiveX controls.

This only happens when I assosiate App with the store.

Hi. I would like to setup TouchDevelop to my own environment. However I did not succeed in building because of depencencies. Also GitHub says dependencies are out-of-date. It seems that tsd is deprecated and should be replaced with typings which is maybe the solution. 
In the code, I had done about 90 minutes of work on TouchDevelop. I opened it today to find that my code hadn't been saved and had been deleted. The file is there, but the improvements are all gone. I made functions, commands, and I had tested many many times.

The current approach for the export button on the 'pxtroute' branch tries to pop up a window.

This appears to snag the popup blocker on Firefox and Chrome, and so means the first expereince the user has of a dialog that says "a window should have opened" but probably it hasn't.

I think this could easily be resolved like this:
Modify the dialogue to say something like
"Export will take your script and import it into the editor at Microsoft MakeCode. It will be automatically upgraded to be compatible. <something about data sharing and how MakeCode behaves"

Then have an 'Open' and 'Cancel' button exactly as they are today.
@pelikhan did you encounter the popup button?
