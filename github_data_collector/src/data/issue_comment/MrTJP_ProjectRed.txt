Using project red version 4.9.4.120 and ic2 classic version 1.5.4.4. using the interface pipes and chips works as well as using the filtered importer, just the item importer doesn't do out put items.
Observe the higher resolution and shading does not match the visual style of vanilla and other mods blocks. I am not an artist but I can throw together a quick 16x16 texture.

**Describe the bug**
Using PR's backpack to duplicate everything

**To Reproduce**
When there are two backpacks in the shortcut, one contains items and the other does not. While opening the backpack that contains the items, press the corresponding number key of the other backpack, and then take out the items in the GUI, there is a chance that they will leave a copy in the original backpack.
I'm a server administrator and I find that some players are using this method to copy items.
I've tested it. It works.

**Describe the bug**
> "Item Barrel", part of ProjectRed Exploration, is meant to hold 128 stacks of 64 of one type of item and display the item stored on its sides. After placing a stack of something in the barrel with right click, it does not display anything on its side and does not accept more than one stack. The item stack can still be removed with left click.

As reported in my modpack [here](https://github.com/xJon/The-1.12.2-Pack/issues/40), and also apparently reported in FTB Revelations [here](https://github.com/FTBTeam/FTB-Revelation-2/issues/163).

**Versions**
Include versions of the dependencies. And since you're looking at it, make sure ProjectRed is up to date. Don't submit bugs for old versions, as they could have been fixed.

Since making redstone signal strength based contraptions on its own is complex and bulky, Project:Red makes this harder to manage with the fact that the strength is _way more stronger_ then conventional redstone, I recommend adding 2 logic gates to Project:Red and maybe even in the IC chip workbench :

**"Strength Controller Gate"** : This gate would act like a OR gate with the ability to control incoming signal strengths (Example: a input with a strength of 15 going into the gate can be reduced to 5), but can only reduce the signals strength to 1 and amplify it to 15, with addition to changing its inputs with a screwdriver (like all other project red logic gates). This could be useful for analog based redstone items in other mods or with vanilla redstone machines. Example: this would work well with Analog controller signal box in railcraft, where it communicates with other railcraft items based on a redstone inputs strength.

**"Strength Detector"** : This gate would have the ability to take redstone inputs and give an output based on a set limit, Example: if it you were to put in a signal strength of 5 for the input but the minimum was 6 or the max is 4, it wont give any output but say if it gives a strength was 10 and the minimum was 5 and the max was 15, it would give a output, take note that it would have restrictions such as making conflicting signal strengths (like a limit of 6 and a max of 5) and obviously will only work with the maximum/minimum strength possible (so no minimums of -1 and maximums of 100). this would be _very_ crucial for redstone machines using storage or other item based things, things like auto shutdowns for mobfarms can be possible with this gate where the mobfarm can shut off if a strength detector is activated.
**Describe the bug**
Upon placing a ProjectRed gem (Ruby, Sapphire, Peridot) into Dank/Null they are replaced with 4 Circuit Plates from project Red

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Acquire Gems
2. Open Dank Null
3. Insert Gems
4. *Don't* profit.. the expensive gems are converted to Circuit Plates

**Expected behavior**
Gems do not transmute upon storage

**Crash Log**
N/A no crash

I setup a relatively big setup with item transports, interfaces and more, however after relogging on a public server part of my piping is now invisible and I cannot get it back. I can't place a block in the area that the invisible pipes are in, and I cannot move there either. Furthermore I cannot access the GUI of the pipes meaning I can't replace them or try to set them back up again.

I was told to try /ghost (Not sure what that does) but it sadly did nothing.
We are using FTB Revelations, running through Hamachi, with some mods added. We are using the latest version of ProjectRed (1.12.2-4.9.4.120).

It's an oddly specific bug, and seems to only work with only one of three players using the server. After a lot of testing with multiple mods and fixes, we determined that the cause was the rapid switching of lamps from on and off (I had a light cycling effect in my base, and he only DC'd upon coming close to it. Testing with single blocks and spamming a lever also caused him to DC.

Considering we share the base, it's kind of annoying that I can't use the coloured lamps in it. Only the block lamps cause the issues. Cage lamps, and other variants are fine after testing. So are lamps that remain placed, though placing them in larger amounts would disconnect him, just as switching their state.

The error he was getting is Internal Exception: java.io.IOException: An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine.
Subj. Sometimes your big ship is stuck and you dunno why.

Will greatly help with construction of any moving thing.
