# Operation
I created `~/.xvimrc` file. Here is a peak of my `.xvimrc` file, it only contains `set relativenumber`.

```
~> cat ~/.xvimrc
set relativenumber
```

However, I restarted the xcode, its still the normal line number. Its not switch to using the relative line number at all.

# Expected behaviour
Expect to see relative line number in Xcode editor

# Environments
  - Xcode Version [ 10.1   ]
  - XVim branch and revision [   master -> 5c7aaa56e2d39ed2dd9ad42b7f14e4c91ee59218 (XcodeHeader directory)  ]
  - Keyboard Language [  En   ]
  - Input source language [ En   ]


Description
`set paste` has no effect on putting (tabs and spaces are not preserved).

Expected behaviour
`set paste` should make putting preserve indentation, I believe.


Environments

Here is the complete log https://gist.github.com/simonsolnes/9cf7557bc275ad03ea343961c56d038b


Since Xcode 9 support is actually available in another repository, let's point people to that :)
Just like this repo does https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors
Really great to have multiple cursors.
If this has been requested before, please close me.
I was searching in the issues and googled "XVim2" afterwards only to end up in the neighboring project.

Thanks!
This is a link to XVim2 to let people know there is a working version, long term we might want to move the current `master` branch of XVim to `oldmaster` and migrate the code from XVim2 to XVim and make it the `master` branch on XVim. That repo has better SEO and if XVim2 is the future then it might make sense to just move it over.

Readme_jp.md is way outdated.
Because I don't know japanese, I couldn't fix it.

I think if it cannot be updated, this should be removed.
Out-of-date-readme.md _can_ open possibility of nightmare
