> ## 1.10.4 / 2019-08-11
> 
> ### Security
> 
> #### Address CVE-2019-5477 ([#1915](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1915))
> 
> A command injection vulnerability in Nokogiri v1.10.3 and earlier allows commands to be executed in a subprocess by Ruby's `Kernel.open` method. Processes are vulnerable only if the undocumented method `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file` is being passed untrusted user input.
> 
> This vulnerability appears in code generated by the Rexical gem versions v1.0.6 and earlier. Rexical is used by Nokogiri to generate lexical scanner code for parsing CSS queries. The underlying vulnerability was addressed in Rexical v1.0.7 and Nokogiri upgraded to this version of Rexical in Nokogiri v1.10.4.

I am setting up the ADOP C on my local windows. I have installed the pre-requisites as mentioned in the documentation. 
I have executed the below command.
**./quickstart.sh -t local -m adopc -u xxx -p xxx**
Currently I don't have any docker-machine. So the script will create a docker-machine named adopc. On creating am getting the below response. I see similar issues but not the solution.

ADOP-C works on Mac and Linux, I think it would be a good idea to have a more generic image for the front page in README.md
is it possible to configure the access of the users to DevOps Platform (UI). For example, when a user belongs to Developer group in LDAP access the DevOps platform, they cannot view other tools in the UI while if a user belongs to Admin group, he/she can view all of the DevOps tools.They want to configure the access of the users to DevOps Dashboard (UI).

Hi,

I have a virtual machine with the following capacity 8CPU with 32GBRAM and I would like to setup this ADOP Platform on VM this machine on-premise without an internet connection. Could you please let me know the steps?

Question:
0) How to download a copy of ADOP C if the VM has no internet connection? Is there any other alternatives?
1) What is the hardware requirement? 8CPU / 32GB RAM sufficient?
2) What is ADOP C software requirement?  Does it need to have this 4 component on the VM (Docker Machine, Docker Engine, Docker Toolbox & Docker compose)? 
3) Steps by step to download and install ADOP C on VM. 

Regards,
dwcw
Github Actions has been made available and it is worth trialling out as a CI tool for testing the provisioning of the platform as opposed to Travis, especially since it's more native to Github.

This may also alleviate the OOM issues with Travis when trying to build this PR - https://github.com/Accenture/adop-docker-compose/pull/298
