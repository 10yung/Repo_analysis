## Possible Solution
I have found that closing and reopening the file with the problem fixes the issues.

## Expected Behavior
ability to set dim amount for indent guides

## Current Behavior
indent guides are very bright, and there is no possibility to dim them down, this is very distracting

Hello!

Is it possible that when working inside the tag, the Rainbow indent guide lines are highlighted, and not the line on the left?
It would be much more convenient to work with the code.

Here is the highlight to the left of the code.

That's how I would like

## Your programming language(s)
Haskell

## Expected Behavior
Nested brackets have different colors

## Current Behavior
All brackets have yellow color:

## Code snippet for reproduce (for bugs)
Install [Intellij-Haskell](https://github.com/rikvdkleij/intellij-haskell) plugin, then create haskell project, then create any haskell file with content:

```x = (1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + 5))))```

## Expected Behavior
* the link within the pop up should direct the user to settings menu for editing colors

## Current Behavior
* upon clicking the link, the user is directed to the plugin's main configuration page, not the color scheme editing page

## Possible Solution
- `com.github.izhangzhihao.rainbow.brackets.activity. CustomRainbowActivity` uses an `href=#` which seems to direct to the plugin's primary config page - if possible it should be changed to the proper link.
- also, the copy should be corrected to: `Want to customize your own color scheme of Rainbow Brackets?`

I've a few points here that are all related:

First, I would like to be able to configure one series of colours, which is used for all bracket types. I would like to be able to choose how many different colours are used. Other similar extension do this by letting you configure 10 colours and then setting a numerical config value specifiying how many of those colours are used.

Second I would like to be able to configure it so that the coloured nesting level changes each time _any_ open or close is enountered. Currently if I type in the following:

`{<([])>}`

All the text will be the same colour. I would prefer it to be using the rainbow colours so that each level of bracket causes a colour change.
The PHP template language Twig is not getting its brackets colored correctly.

## Your programming language(s)
Twig

## Expected Behavior
The Twig brackets should either be rainbow or should be the default editor color.

## Current Behavior
The Twig brackets at all levels are the first rainbow color

## Possible Solution
Perhaps the twig brackets can be ignored.

## Code snippet for reproduce (for bugs)
Please provide code snippet for reproduce bugs.
```twig
{% if foo %}
    {% for bar in foo %}
        {{ bar }}
    {% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```

Currently if a user want to change the brakets color he needs to change it at 4 different places (round brackets, square brackets and so on)
Of course it is nice to have the ability to change each kind of bracketscolor individually.
But they are for sure some people (like me) who apply the same code to all kind of brackets.
It would in that case be very helpfull to have some kind of way to apply the 5 colors dirrectly to all kind of braces

Maybe with a global brackets line or a button that would fill all lines with the same colors as the currently selected bracket.

## Current Behavior
IntelliJ currently lacks of some advanced brackets manipulation abilities that i think they might be useful. I know this plugin is mainly about colouring but maybe you will find my suggestions fruitful:)

## Feature 1: A shortcut to remove current and matching bracket
Lack of this one is pretty annoying. How should it works? You put the caret before a bracket and by pressing the shortcut it will remove the bracket and it's matching one:
![](https://i.imgur.com/puTlbF4.jpg) + shorcut = ![](https://i.imgur.com/690FRex.jpg)

Or when the caret is within some brackets remove the closest ones but this could be kinda dangerous in languages that uses e.g. `{}` for codeblocks, so maybe it could be optional setting?

## Feature 2: A shortcut to duplicate current and matching bracket
Same as feature 1 but instead of removing it will add brackets:
![](https://i.imgur.com/690FRex.jpg) + shorcut = ![](https://i.imgur.com/puTlbF4.jpg)

## Feature 3: A shortcut to change/cycle brackets
Similar to feature 1 but instead of removing brackets it will rotate some preselected brackets.
In options can be a manualy editable textbar that contains e.g. `()[]{}//` and inside editor when you press the shortcut it will replace current brackets with following ones.
E.g.: `a = (1,2,3,4,5)` becomes `a = [1,2,3,4,5]` then `a = {1,2,3,4,5}`, etc.

## Bonus Feature: A shortcut to select all content within brackets
I know this one can be already achieved by `expand selection`  feature but when you are really deep within nested brackets you have to repeat the action many times.
