load fails with error "`BlenderDNA Structure encountered an error`"

Looking at older issues, think this is supposed to have been fixed?  Anyone else getting this?  Thank you

In my implementation, bundled test model
```
test/models/X/BCN_Epileptic.X
```
has an issue where the head gets detached if "pre-transform vertices" assimp load flag specified (suspect problem in `X` model loader?)

By comparison, "Pre-transform vertices" has no such effect on similar model
```
test/models/XGL/BCN_Epileptic.zgl
```
where the head stays attached to the body regardless of whether vertice are pre-transformed.

Does anyone else see this?  Trying to isolate whether it's a problem in my own code or not -- thank you

P.S. please ignore the mesh color changes due to pre-transform vertices flag, separate minor issue
