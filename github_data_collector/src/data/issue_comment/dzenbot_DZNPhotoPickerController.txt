When I select a photo from the internet search results(DZNPhotoDisplayViewController) it displays perfectly well in the next page(DZNPhotoEditorViewController)but on selecting cancel and coming back to the previous page and again selecting the same previously selected image then it simply displays a black screen in the next page.

Hi, my DZNPhotoPickerController works perfectly with Google API Search (with my keys), except on iPhone X where an error occurs : request failed bad request (400). 
I admit I don't understand the relationship between this API and the format of the device. Same error on all iPhone X models (X, XR, XS...). Google Search works with all other devices. 
Do you have an idea ? 
Hello,

I am trying to use Google Image Search. I am doing the following:

```
// These are replaced with the real details
NSString *API_KEY = @" ApikeyHere";
NSString *CX_ID = @"0123456789000:abcedfghij";

[DZNPhotoPickerController registerFreeService:DZNPhotoPickerControllerServiceGoogleImages
                                      consumerKey:API_KEY
                                   consumerSecret:CX_ID];

    DZNPhotoPickerController *picker = [[DZNPhotoPickerController alloc] init];
    picker.supportedServices = DZNPhotoPickerControllerServiceGoogleImages;

    picker.allowsEditing = YES;
    picker.delegate = self;
    
    [self presentViewController:picker animated:YES completion:nil];
```
I'm getting the Response "Request Failed : bad response (400)". Is Google Image Search working still...? Is there something-else I should do...?

Thanks...!
but when i use edit view controller. the result image size is screen width. how can i get more definition image?  my original image size is 2000x3000. i want a image size with 2000x2000.
As the title said, I'm facing with this problem. I've just want to use the cropMode extension of DZNPhotoPickerController, so that I drag these files to my project:
<img width="1330" alt="screen shot 2017-10-08 at 11 18 49 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7514128/31313870-804083ac-ac1a-11e7-9b8c-a60192e22ff7.png">
----> And I got this error:
<img width="1330" alt="screen shot 2017-10-08 at 11 16 25 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7514128/31313863-5027bab4-ac1a-11e7-9269-b58830e34ccc.png">

Here is my implementation:

Am I wrong in any lines? Please help me, thanks very much.
Hi,

I'm trying to use your library so that I can crop pictures that are in the photo library to a square.  My code:  

self?.picker = UIImagePickerController()
                //self?.picker = DZNPhotoPickerController()
                self?.picker?.delegate = self
                self?.picker?.sourceType = .photoLibrary
                //self?.picker.allowsEditing = true
                self?.picker?.cropMode = DZNPhotoEditorViewControllerCropMode.square
                //self?.picker.cropSize = CGSize(width: 200, height: 200)
                self?.present((self?.picker)!, animated: true, completion: nil)

I admit that I haven't tried setting self?.picker to DZNPhotoPickerController(), mainly because I'm not entirely sure which methods I need to override for the delegate.  Unless I have to use this class to get the square picture, however, I'm happy with using UIImagePickerController and just cropping the picture.  This line self?.picker?.cropMode = DZNPhotoEditorViewControllerCropMode.square does not work as expected and I still get rectangular pictures.  How do I change my code so I get square pictures?

Thanks,
Sean
On a brand new swift project in XCode 8.1 with the following Podfile and only adding one line to the main ViewController.swift file:
    import DZNPhotoPickerController

XCode reports the error: 'AFNetworking.h' file not found

Here's the Podfile

    platform :ios, "9.3"
    use_frameworks!

    target 'Testing' do
      pod 'DZNPhotoPickerController'  # Download photos from the internet
    end


I've attached the XCode project to this as well.  I'm stumped and appreciate any help in getting this resolved.

Hi,

First of all
Thank you so much for making this awesome library :)

I have question, how to implement editor picker in swift since i always getting warning error
In my case, photo will cropping after photo selected from photo library or by camera.

here is my code

```
func takePictureFromLiblary(){
        let imagePicker =  UIImagePickerController()
        imagePicker.allowsEditing = true
        imagePicker.cropMode = DZNPhotoEditorViewControllerCropMode.Circular
        imagePicker.delegate = self

        if UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable(UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.PhotoLibrary) {

            imagePicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.PhotoLibrary

        } else if UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable(UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.SavedPhotosAlbum) {

            imagePicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.SavedPhotosAlbum

        } else {

            JLToast.makeText("Galery not available, please check your camera and try again", duration:JLToastDelay.ShortDelay).show()

        }


        imagePicker.finalizationBlock = { (picker: UIImagePickerController, info: NSDictionary) in

        }

        imagePicker.cancellationBlock = { (picker: UIImagePickerController) in

        }


        self.presentViewController(imagePicker, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

and here is warning error message

```
Cannot assign value of type '(UIImagePickerController, NSDictionary) -> ()' to type 'UIImagePickerControllerFinalizationBlock!'
Cannot assign value of type '(UIImagePickerController) -> ()' to type 'UIImagePickerControllerCancellationBlock!'
```

Any help would be appreciated :)
Thank you for advance
