Is there any way to request support for particular features? my previous post [here ](https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/issues/1867 )shows the issue

Is there anyway to bump this to being fixed? Donations to the project etc?

### Bug reports:

When generating the canvas for my HTML page, the text was not correctly formatted.
I've tracked the issue to the loading/rendering of the font.
Take this font-family definition example applied in CSS:

font-family: "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", "Segoe UI", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;

All the above font families get correctly parsed by the Font Family descriptor and added to the list.
The createFontStyle function will generate the font to be assigned to the canvas rendering context.

The problem, It seems, is that the double quotes string format get lost so the canvas will get the following font string:

normal normal 700 14px Segoe UI, Segoe UI Web (West European), Segoe UI, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif

This will be invalid and no font will be loaded for the canvas.
If we correctly send the font-family with the double quotes this will work.

normal normal 700 14px "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", "Segoe UI", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif

**Summary**

<!-- Summary of the PR -->

Currently text position is calculated by using the absolute bounding height and placing it at the bottom. This causes fonts to be misaligned, as well as underlines being misplaced with some fonts too. Using the baseline is far more consistent across fonts.

See <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/Lxn6b7r3/">this fiddle</a>

this is my some code:

vue :
```
<div class="content" ref="shareImg">
          <img  :src="headImg" crossOrigin="anonymous" />
</div>
(headImg = path + '?time=' + new Date().valueOf()  )
(path  is not base64 )
```
js:

```
const canvas = await html2canvas(this.$refs.shareImg, {
        allowTaint: false,
        useCORS: true
      });
const img = canvas.toDataURL("image/jpeg");

```
this is error:
Origin {http://xx.xx} is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.


but same code in Android webview/chrome  can merge image success.
when I use line-height=height to center text vertically，I find it does not seem to be centered vertically in the picture generated by html2canvas.

### Bug reports:

Some users have set a large font in WeChat and used our gadget in the WeChat built-in browser. When the version of html2canvas is v1.0.0-alpha.12, it is just a typographical mess; when the version of html2canvas is In 1.0.0-rc.5, the information is severely lost. Don't know how to solve it, can you help me? Thank you!

有用户在微信中设置了大号的字体，并在微信内置浏览器中使用了我们的小工具，当html2canvas的版本是v1.0.0-alpha.12时仅仅是文字排版错乱；当html2canvas的版本是1.0.0-rc.5 版本时，信息丢失严重。不知道怎么解决，你能帮助我吗？谢谢！

I'm trying to use html2canvas to print a div that contains an SVG element. My code is as follows:

`html2canvas(document.getElementById('<divId>'), {
	logging: true,
	letterRendering: 1,
	allowTaint: true,
	useCORS: true
}).then(result => {
	var img = result.toDataURL("image/png");
	/* save image to server */
});`

Whenever the SVG element contains an <image> tag referencing another SVG file (from the same origin), the referenced SVG file is never included in the final image. Why is that?
