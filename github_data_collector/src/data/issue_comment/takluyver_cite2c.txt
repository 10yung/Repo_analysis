Whenever I use the city button and type in any keyword, the result just says no matches found, even for general terms like gravitation.
As a third party extension, cite2c is a great enhancement to jupyter notebook. So why not add it to jupyter_contrib_nbextensions?
Hi,
the plugin works a treat in the notebooks (thanks!), but I don't seem to be able to use it in jupyterlab - are there any tricks I could use/plans to make it available for jupyterlab, too?

Thanks

I have a jupyterhub installation serving single-user notebooks (wonderful tools!), and would like to have everyone be able to use cite2c for inline citations in their notebooks.

I guess my short question would be: Looking at the install.py script, it looks like it's only able to install for the local user? Is there any known way to install for all users under jupyterhub?

I realize they may need some local files installed in their accounts (like .cls files and such that are installed with zotero - which I have done for one user account for testing purposes). However, the handlers still don't seem to be working properly. Even if I use "python -m cite2c.install" as that user, the cite2c/zotero_oauth page doesn't load and results in a 404 response. I can get a little farther if I manually set up the cite2c.json file with my credentials, but the search gui isn't displaying correctly, and (even though I can get it to read my library, and insert the correct <cite> tag information) the citations don't get rendered inline nor in the bibliography. I don't understand the software enough to make any more headway at the moment, but if there are any suggestions on what might need to be altered, I might be able to make some more progress.

Sorry if this has already been addressed before, but I couldn't find any mention of cite2c being used with jupyterhub anywhere.
While my python 3.6 fully updated conda environment was active, I did:
* pip install cite2c
* python -m cite2c.install

After launching a new notebook server, and opening a notebook, I was expecting to see the new icons meantioned in the README, but they are not there.

FYI, I am using the nbextension configurator with a couple of other extensions that create new icons in the notebook toolbar, i'm just thinking if you used absolute icon positions, maybe they are overwritten by some of my other extensions?
Otherwise I don't see any errors.
At the moment, it doesn't seem to be possible to cite a particular page (paragraph, clause, chapter, etc) within a source. Might this feature be added? I'm not familiar with citeproc-js, but it's possible with e.g. pandoc-citeproc.

I'm hoping to use Jupyter with students, so cite2c will be a very important part of that decision - but they do need to be able to identify page numbers in their citations.
I am running Jupyter 4.3.0using Firefox and Opera as browsers. I have just installed cite2c. When I use the 'Insert citation' button in Opera, it always tells me there are no matches - regardless of what the search terms were. When I do it in Firefox, I get no response at all. Either way, no citation is inserted.

It occurs to me that there may have been a problem in connecting to Zotero (e.g. I suppose it's possible that I entered the ID incorrectly, though there was no error message at the time), but I can't see any way of changing or resetting this and reconnecting.
When I insert a citation into a Markdown cell, I get the raw text `<cite data-cite="undefined"></cite>` (which is then rendered as the author's name and year). This is how it's stored in the .ipynb file:

```
   "source": [
    "<cite data-cite=\"undefined\"></cite>"
   ]
```

The raw text should include the author and year of the paper, a DOI, or something else.

Hi, 

Sorry but I am new to github, python etc, hope I don't annoy anyone too much. I am trying to install cite2c using jupyer notebook on sagemathcloud. In my ignorance:
1) I copied all the cite2c files, folders into a seperate empty folder
2) .gitignore wouldn't copy over for some reason, so I carried on anyway
3) whilst in this new folder I typed python install.py into a box which said 'terminal command' and hit the 'play' button
4) the 'terminal command' box output the following:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "install.py", line 3, in <module>
    from IPython.html.nbextensions import install_nbextension
ImportError: No module named html.nbextensions

I am running Windows 7 in case that has anything to do with it (can't see how as it is in the cloud). From this description it'll be clear I don't know much.

I attach a screenshot in case it helps.

Is the problem that I am using sagemathcloud instead of installing Jupyter locally?

Any chance of some help or advice?
Kind regards, Paul

I wanted to uninstall cite2c in Jupyter. I did not find any documentation to do that.
