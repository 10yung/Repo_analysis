**Is your feature request related to a problem or area of OpenRefine? Please describe.**

It could be useful to have a a menu and a GREL function to remove diacritics in strings.

Ex : 

"Ã©cole" -> "ecole"
Opening a pull request to make it easier to draft this policy here.
Members of the steering committee are requested to take note of a conflict of interest policy when joining. We should write one, perhaps in this repository (alongside with GOVERNANCE.md)?
As part of the onboarding process to CS&S we have created advisory and steering committees.
The GOVERNANCE.md document in this repository should reflect that.
**Describe the bug**
Sometimes, when I hit "Export to QuickStatements" it just throws an empty window, without any text to copy to QuickStatements.  If I go back, look again at the schema (without editing it), change views a couple of times, then try to export again, this time it seems to work.  (Sorry, can't be more precise, but it's happened several times to me today.  Possibly related to #1700 - on at least some of the occasions it is possible I had re-started OpenRefine & gone to an existing project with an existing schema.

(3,3 rc 1 / Windows 10 1809 / Chrome 79.0.3945.117)  After running reconciliation, if I "choose new match" then "search for match", put in a specific Q-number to search for, then select it, the old match is discarded but the new match isn't added, and the row goes into the "reconciliation = none" facet
We will need to support both 4.x and 3.x versions of OpenRefine in the future and be able to handle Documentation, Security Patches, and perhaps using [GitHub's Security Policy doc](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) as I mentioned in PR #2048 (now closed) with granular semantic versions (major.minor.patch)

@wetneb had suggested previously in that PR that we should probably do the following:
> Given our current workflows we are basically not able to release fixes for any previous version. We would need to use branches for the major versions we want to support on the long term. That's definitely something we can consider. Each security patch would be merged in all supported major release branches to create the corresponding versions. That would probably mean using more granular release numbers (such as 3.2.0).

- [ ] Verify that our chosen documentation system has support for Semantic Versioning #2273 
- [ ] Decide on supported versions and branching 
- [ ] Verify that GitHub's Security Policy doc works on those supported branches.

I created an Age column based on 2 date columns using the grel:diff function with unit years.
 
I was able to create both Text and Numeric facets on this new Age column. I am not sure what its Type was. Where dates were missing in either of the 2 date columns, the age column cells showed up as blank which was good. 

Made some fixes in some cells. certain dates/ages were wrong and I blanked out age in those cells. In this step I have to treat the value as text. If I try to blank out the cell changing type to Numeric I get an error. 

When I restarted server the next day, I was not able to create a numeric facet anymore on the Age column. It says "no numeric value present". 

I am guessing it has to do with the blanked out cells now set as Text type, So now each time I restart server, to use the numeric facet, I transform all cells in Age using toNumber. Which then doesn't allow me to edit and blank out cells with mistakes. This seems to have been reported before as #841  

I am using the linux-3.2-beta build.  
Please add a new "common transform" called "Clean Html" to OpenRefine.
GREL Command:
htmlText(parseHtml(value))
Since Version **3.3 beta** the preview screen after submitting a SQL-Statement to load data from my local installed PSQL-database runs into an infinite loop.
Using Version 3.2 everything works fine. 

Unfortunately in the terminal windows there are no errors displayed during this error.
