@markjjo - For you to edit.
It looks like retention labels are misused as sensitivity labels in this example. This is very confusing and I assume it has to do with the current limitations of DLP policies for sensitivity labels. Retention labels shouldn't be used to classify content based on sensitivty as shown in this example.

I am a user of PowerShell Module Browser (PSMB).
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/

I really heavlly rely on this web service to find Microsoft PowerShell modules.
But, I noticed the MSCommerce module (https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MSCommerce/1.2) has not been searchable on PSMB.

Could you add the MSCommerce module to the module lists?
If it is not intentionally listed, could you tell me the reason?

Thanks
This documentation is worded such where it seems end users should be able to see messages classified as Phishing and only high confidence Phishing are held in administrative quarantine. 

Support has advised that currently both Phishing and High Confidence Phishing are held in administrative quarantine. 

End user access to Phishing isn't being rolled out until starting in Feb. 2020 per MC20032:

In the "Using a label as a condition in a DLP policy" section, the Retention Label example uses "Confidential" as a label name, since this word is more typically associated with Sensitivity labels, I would like to suggest that a different example be used to decrease the chance for confusion.  Retention and Sensitivity are 2 very different, but related, concepts and we need to keep them separated.

You note "The Advanced Spam filter settings of the Anti-spam policy are currently being deprecated. Our recommended settings for these are to turn them OFF. The functions that were available in the Advanced Spam filter is being incorporated into other parts of the filtering stack."

Can you let us know if some of these have been integrated elsewhere already and if so where we can find them?

If not - can you give us 
(I) any timeframe when they will be deprecated or 
(ii) any timeframe when the integration elsewhere might happen or 
(iii) an indication of where should we look to find out when certain settings from this page are integrated elsewhere?

Where in the OST is the BAA even mentioned? I have the current doc and it's not mentioned at all. How are customers supposed to find the OST -&gt; BAA terms?

Not sure if our tenant is newer, but I can't perform any of these steps.  Below I will point  out the issues I see.  If we can lets clear this up as a recent rash of new malware is aiming for this specific vector to gain persistent data access.  I have tried these instructions using the old and new admin center layout.  The problems are not related to that.

Specifically this section: Steps for finding signs of this attack
1: Security and Compliance does not exist in my tenant.  I have a Security option and a Compliance option under "Admin centers" in my left bar on the page "Microsoft 365 admin center".
2: If I click compliance or security I do not have a "Search and Investigation" option/choice.  I also don't understand you use of the word "node".  That word should be removed.  However, if I click the "Security option", then choose "More Options", then I will see a "Office 365 security and compliance center".  In that Center I have an option/choice for "Search", but still no "Search and Investigation".  Under "Search", when I expand it, I see an option for "Audit log search". Please bold "Audit log search" in your statement as that is the complete name.  You just have "Audit log" in bold and not the word search.
3: You do not "create" a search.  You are searching.  Please remove that word.  First you leave the default options, Activities to "Show results for all activities".  Next you leave the "Users" field blank so it will search for all users.  You may want to point out they should adjust the date as by default it goes back 8 days.  Click the "Search" button now we see results on right.  You state to filter it... OK.  Which fields am I filtering on.  First step is I have to click the "Filter" button to see the fields come up.  Then where do I put your filter parameters?  I would assume in "Activity", "Item" or "Detail".  Also put in quotes what you want me to type.  do you want "add" in there?  Are the parameters you put correct.  I approved a new app and did a search for those two settings but the results were blank.
4: How do you "Examine the extended properties"?  I assume you mean click and entry and the details window opens from the right.  Then expand the "More Information" section to look for that field.

Finally you state at the top this should be looked at weekly?  How about creating a "New alert policy".  Also if we are to check it weekly, probably need good instructions so that we can.

Looks like there is suppose to be a section for French driving license number where the Finland passport number section is.
