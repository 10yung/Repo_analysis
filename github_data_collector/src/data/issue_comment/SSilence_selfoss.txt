Instead of instantiating its dependencies in each class, we are going to switch to dependency injection. We will declare the dependencies using typehinted constructor arguments and pass already instantiated dependency objects to the constructor. This will loosen the coupling between classes and allow us to pass mock objects for testing.

Rather than creating and passing instances of dependencies manually, we will let Dice dependency injection container library instantiate them for us. We are setting `CONTAINER` value in fatfree’s Hive to a function wrapping around Dice->create method (Dice does not support PSR-11), which will make fatfree ask Dice to instantiate controllers. Dice will recursively instantiate all of the controller’s dependencies and then instantiate the controller itself.

At the moment, only a small fraction of selfoss was converted but more is coming soon.
Added the docker support

I updated it to work with the selfoss repo regardless of the local changes and also tweaked some things.

Dockerfile for Selfoss RSS aggregator is bundled with the repository.

Selfoss config is mounted in a separate volume, so your custom settings should survive reboot.

To run the latest stable tag (2.18) use:
```
docker-compose up
```
Then find the web interface at http://localhost:8390


To run the latest master version use:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-master.yml up
```
Then find the web interface at http://localhost:8391


To rebuild the master version with the latest code from git use:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.master.yml build --no-cache
```

I want to dockerize selfoss, but I'm unable to identify that how exactly I do it since it uses PHP and nodejs both.
If I require to use docker-compose, then can someone please help me with the exact proper script?

This is what my Selfoss looks like.  All it took was
```
.entry-toolbar {
    display: inherit;
    padding: 0px;
    padding-bottom: 10px;
    background: inherit;
    border: 0;
    margin-top: -2px;
}
```
in selfoss/user.css.

**_But it doesn't work!_**

Clicking _mark_ or _star_ does nothing.  I have spent hours messing with the the jquery with no success.  I cannot understand why it does not work.  What would it take to make it work?
Some video platform like Youtube or [Peertube](https://joinpeertube.org) use the [Media-RSS](http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss) extension to provide metadata about the videos. They generally do not use the whole tags available, but provide tags for the video description, the thumbnail, and the number of views.

It would be amazing if selfoss could at least display the thumbnail and the description for videos.

The moment you started observing reality, you hopelessly polluted any conclusions you might make about it. The anthropic principle guarantees that you are NOT seeing the universe in most typical state. But used correctly, this highly controversial idea can be extremely powerful. So, how do you correctly use the anthropic principle?

Replaces https://github.com/SSilence/selfoss/pull/1124
The old logo is great but its age is apparent on it:

![Selfoss logo](https://github.com/SSilence/selfoss/raw/d39d5503bab93b60106a49a5c3f037f7c8cf099c/assets/images/logo_big.png)

We also do not have a vector source, which makes handling it a pain.

It would be nice if we found a designer that could come up with something great like https://github.com/j0k3r/graby/pull/214
Now that we have made it work using AJAX in #1137, it should be trivial to move the page to the settings page, allowing us to translate the page.

The titles of above said pages are not getting inheritid from the configurations.
I've tried modifying somethings in 'selfoss-ui.js' but it didn't worked.
For example:
        if ($('body').is('#hashpasswordbody, #opmlbody')) {
            // we do not want to create UI for non-app pages but we want to inherit the title of those pages from the configurations.
            $(document).attr('title', selfoss.htmlTitle);
            return;
        }

But it is not working.
I've tried various more things but no luck as of now.

Can you please look into this?
