# A feature request

##  What do you want to add?

I want to insert a showcase view on tabbar for teaching something to user. but I get center `UIView` and other items in any way

## A link to showcase

[MaterialShowcase-iOS](https://github.com/aromajoin/material-showcase-ios)

i want my tab bar anytime in expand state. how to prevent collapse on selecting any item
Hey, this might be an easy fix, how do I edit the height of the Circle TabView that when clicked expands? On iPhone X this is colliding with the virtual slider.

Thanks
When i set tabBarController.tabBar  hide , black space occupy the bottom space.
When I switch go from first tabbar controller to second title appears at the bottom.

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        self.title = "Timers"
        
        self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem.init(image: UIImage.init(named: "close"), style: UIBarButtonItemStyle.plain, target: self, action: #selector(closeDidTap))
    }

I'm trying to make the background of the tab bar transparent so that my tableview is visible below the tab bar. Is that possible?
