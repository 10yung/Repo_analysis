I am trying to execute the sentiment example but it is showing this error at line 48 and 78 in sentimentanalysis file? i.e.
 trainingset = featureVector(trainingsetindex,:);
what to do?

I found that SanitizerComment worked much better using the following regex:

```
    myoutstring =regexprep(myoutstring, '\s+', ' '); %removes all whitespace
```

HTH.

can we get speed up by converting large matrices to sparse?

think about rewriting it with hashmaps

Right now we are using regex which is slow 

Here is a simple solution:
put elements of the input string in a hash map (container map)
compare the contents of that container map with the keys of the header
if exists output the values

Rewrite it with hashmaps
