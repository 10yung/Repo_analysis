Thanks you so match for this nice HoRNDIS project! Good idea, but unfortunately not worked for me yet. Please, really need your help, cause my laptop died after installation. 

I've try to install your software on my old MacBookPro late 2008, Core2duo, with Sierra running on it by DosDude1.com patch. 

After installing nothing changed(no my MI A1 phone was detected), but after restart I've found that my keyboard and touchpad not working, so I staked on login screen. 

I've delete this file:
System/Library/Extensions/HoRNDIS.kext

But this one I have not found :
Do the same for the ‚ÄúHoRNDIS.kext‚Äù that lives in ‚Äù/Library/Extensions‚Äù.

Still no keyboard and touchpad.

Please help. How can I revert system back?

Thanks in advance, 
I tried HoRNDIS with an Optus Netgear AC800S modem and it's not being recognised.
if you turn the device on and off, you can see a lot of duplicates in the network on Mac OS CATALINA  10.15.1 (19B88) MacBook air 2014
Hello,

I first apologize for my english (i am french)
I have a MacBook Pro which turns on Mojave (10.14.6) and i would like to use HoRNDIS on it to share my OnePlus 6's datas with it.
So I follow the tutorial, I download the installation package, I run it, all clear.
Nextly, I run the USB tethering on my phone, and then, i plug it into my USB dock which is connected to my Mac.
I open the Network preferences, and I can't see my phone.

So i have decided to uninstall HoRNDIS by doing "sudo rm -r HoRNDIS.kext" as mentioned in the "Uninstall part" of the tutorial. And also removing the "Extensions Folder" by doing "sudo rm -r Extensions".

Then, I have restarted my computer, and I have reinstalled HoRNDIS with these 2 lines: 
"brew cask install horndis
sudo kextload /Library/Extensions/HoRNDIS.kext"
All clear too.
But the problem is the same, i can't see my phone in network preferences.

Can someone help me please?

Thank you üòä 
On Mojave 10.14.5 (18F132) I didn't need to run `sudo kextload /Library/Extensions/HoRNDIS.kext` after `brew cask install ....` as suggested in `README.md`
It might be worth mentioning that you can install HoRNDIS with brew on [the webpage](https://joshuawise.com/horndis) (I see it's mentioned on the readme here on github).
I want create USB install Mac OSX, can using USB tethering share internet via mobile Android.
I try add kext HoRNDIS.kext in folder USB EFI/CLOVER/kexts and HDD EFI/CLOVER/kexts but not work.
Haven't I unknown wrong, but when I install kext HoRNDIS.kext to Library/Extensions working OK. I  want save kext in EFI/CLOVER/kexts hackintosh, can do?
Thank you!
HoRNDIS is incompatible with Catalina due to the new read-only system partition. installation via the .pkg or brew will fail.

see the What's New in APFS session from WWDC19: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/710/

there may be a workaround by disabling SIP using csrutil in Recovery Mode, but I haven't had a chance to try it yet.

the "right" way to fix HoRNDIS long term is likely to migrate it to using the new DriverKit framework, documented at https://developer.apple.com/documentation/driverkit
