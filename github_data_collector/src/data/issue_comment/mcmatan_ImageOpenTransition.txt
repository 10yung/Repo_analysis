Thanks for the awesome library the problem i have is that, when i use NavigationController in the Controller i shared image to, the transition still occurs in that controller, and i don't need it. The GIF below explains my issue.

Do you still have support for Swift 2.3? I tried installing via Cocoapods but it always installs the latest version.

Any help would be appreciated.
