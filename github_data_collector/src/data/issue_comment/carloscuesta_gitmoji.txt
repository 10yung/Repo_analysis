Hello @carloscuesta :sunglasses:!

First of all, thank you for your work on leverage this standard, it's a very nice project!

I have a suggestion regarding your website.
When clicking on an emoji card, could it be possible, like on https://emojipedia.org, to copy in the clipboard the emoji itself instead of the text shortcut?

For exemple:
- https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/ => `:art:`
- https://emojipedia.org/artist-palette/ => ðŸŽ¨

It would be very useful for pasting it when `git commit` and having it displayed properly when `git log`

Have a nice day!
## Description

Was looking for an emoji for deprecating code, came across #178.
Found the waste basket a good proposal. So here it is!

Hello @carloscuesta :sunglasses:!

As a fanboy of your website, I have a suggestion: the on-click attribute for copying the emoji code is now **only for the image portion** and **not the entire card**. Instead, the on-click attribute can be applied to the whole card, so that upon hovering the card, mouse pointer changes to a hand symbol and he can copy the emoji code by clicking anywhere inside the card. This enhances the user experience for any newbie.

Hello @carloscuesta :sunglasses:!

I've been working on https://gitmemoji.lalilo.com/. Would you be willing to add a link to this project? I can open a PR if you tell me where would be the best place to put it according to you!

Thanks

- Emoji: ðŸ’­
- Code: `:thought_balloon:`
- Description: "Adding or updating comments in code"

Although in ideal programming world code should be self descriptive, reality shows that sometimes it is really helpful to introduce some context info or short explanation of decisions made in code.

Taking above into consideration I propose to introduce emoji  ðŸ’­identifying commits where comments were added to code or modified.

Currently there is not such an emoji, the closest ones are:
 - :pencil: or :bulb: - but documentation is something different then comment
 - :recycle: - but it is not always about refactoring
 - :beers: - if we discuss all the how's and why's in pub or sth ;)

- Emoji: ?
- Code: ?
- Description: Changing implementation details

My problem: I changed the internal implementation of a method, affecting the types of class properties. IMO, this is neither a change in code structure nor a refactoring and I'm not sure which emoji to use.

Do you have any suggestions?
Hello @carloscuesta :sunglasses:!

There are a bunch of emojis that begin with "Adding or updating", but there other ones that miss the "or updating" part even though a specific emoji for that doesn't exist. Therefore, for consistency, I think we should change the following:

# :construction_worker: :&#8288;construction_worker:
```diff
- Adding CI build system.
+ Adding or updating CI build system.
```

# :chart_with_upwards_trend: :&#8288;chart_with_upwards_trend:
```diff
- Adding analytics or tracking code.
+ Adding or updating analytics or tracking code.
```

# :loud_sound: :&#8288;loud_sound:
```diff
- Adding logs.
+ Adding or updating logs.
```

# :busts_in_silhouette: :&#8288;busts_in_silhouette:
```diff
- Adding contributor(s).
+ Adding or updating contributor(s).
```

# :egg: :&#8288;egg:
```diff
- Adding an easter egg.
+ Adding or updating an easter egg.
```

<!-- Emoji suggestion: Use this template to propose an emoji -->

- Emoji: :scissors: <!-- Emoji icon you want to use -->
- Code: `:scissors:` <!-- Emoji code on GitHub -->
- Description: If you borrow or cut someone else's code, use it for annotation.<!-- Describe why this emoji should be used -->

We often come across situations that require the use of someone else's code, and I think we should encourage everyone to mark them out when submitting.
