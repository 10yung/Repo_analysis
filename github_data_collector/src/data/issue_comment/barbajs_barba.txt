Barba.Pjax.start();

var FadeTransition = Barba.BaseTransition.extend({
  start: function() {
      Promise
        .all([this.newContainerLoading, this.fadeOut()])
        .then(this.fadeIn.bind(this));
  },

  fadeOut: function() {

      const TransitionPromise = new Promise(function(resolve){
        const OutTransition =  new TimelineMax();
        OutTransition
       // .set(".cover", {display:"block", y:"100%"})
        .to(".cover", 0.5, {width: "100%", ease: Power2.easeOut})
        .to(".cover", 0.5, {width: "0", left:"100%", ease: Power2.easeOut})
        //.set(".cover", {display:"none"});
    });
    return TransitionPromise;      

  },

  fadeIn: function() {
      let _this = this;
      //TweenLite.set(this.oldContainer, {display:"none"});
      TweenLite.to(this.newContainer, 0.1, {opacity:1, onComplete:function(){ _this.done(); }  });
  }
});

Barba.Pjax.getTransition = function() {

Hi guys,

We've just a new site using Barba. It works superbly and really adds to the experience. 

However, I have just shared the site via facebook mobile app on android. 

When you click on the link, the site automatically opens in facebooks own browser causing none of the links to work. 

Is there a setting I need to put or something that can check whether barba should even run? 
I am in the process of transitioning from v1 to v2 and have run into an issue creating separate transitions for when someone is moving from the home page to an interior page and vice-versa.

Here is how my transitions are setup:

```
barba.init({
	transitions: [
		{
		    name: 'slidein-transition',
		    from: 'home',
		    to: 'interior',
			leave: function(data) {
				alert('slidein');
				var done = this.async();
				TweenMax.to(data.current.container, 1, {
					opacity: 0,
					onComplete: done
				});
			},
			enter: function(data) {
				var done = this.async();
				TweenMax.from(data.next.container, 1, {
					opacity: 1,
					onComplete: done
				});
			}
		}, {
	            name: 'slideout-transition',
		    from: 'interior',
		    to: 'home',
			leave: function(data) {
				alert('slideout');
				var done = this.async();
				TweenMax.to(data.current.container, 1, {
					opacity: 0,
					onComplete: done
				});
			},
			enter: function(data) {
				var done = this.async();
				TweenMax.from(data.next.container, 1, {
					opacity: 1,
					onComplete: done
				});
			}
		}
	]
});
```


However in this example when making a transition from the data-barba-namespace="home" container to the data-barba-namespace="interior" container and back they both use the 'slideout-transition'.

Is there something incorrect with how I have these transitions setup?

Thanks in advance!
## The problem

I had barba/core working as expected. Then I installed barba/css and ran into problems with fetched content being appended to my barba wrapper rather than replacing my barba container as I expected.

## Description

My markup looks like this:

```
@if(!isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_BARBA']))
  <body>
    <div id="app" data-barba="wrapper" role="document">
      <header>My header content</header>
@endif

      <main data-barba="container" data-barba-namespace="{{ basename( get_permalink() ) }}">
        @yield('content')
      </main>

@if(!isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_BARBA']))
      <footer>My footer content</footer>
      ### FETCHED CONTENT IS APPEARING HERE ###
    </div>
  </body>
@endif
```

When I navigate to a new page without barba/css it works as expected. When using barba/css, however, my new content appears where I've indicated in the markup. The previous page content is removed however, I do not see duplicate content.

The javascript calling Barba is very simple. I was originally running Barba with `barba.init();`. To use the CSS module I changed this to:

```
  barba.use(barbaCss);
  barba.init();
```

BarbaCSS is installed and I've verified this to be working by adding some simple opacity transitions between pages. I don't see any console messages.

## Environment

- Barba version that exhibits the issue: @barba/core@^2.9.6, @barba/css@2.1.15
- Build used: import from node_modules
- Browser OS/version used: Chrome 79.0.3945.88  on OS X Mojave

Gday!

Thanks so much for Barba. Big ups from down under.  

I know this issue has been addressed  in #19 and elsewhere - I've tried my best to follow along, with little success. I am new to all of this so, please forgive me :( 

I'm attempting to use the namespace strategy outlined by @luruke, but I think my logic for "waiting for NewContainerLoading to be resolved" is flawed, as **I'm not able to retrieve the Barba.HistoryManager.prevStatus(); inside my valid: function**. (I just get null when I console.log it). As a result the specific page transition only works on "the first click', after which it doesn't work.

My code is set up with just 2 transitions at the moment. I've left out the GSAP timelines as they are irrelevant. If anyone can help with setting up the valid: function() part, I'd be forever grateful. Hopefully, some more details about this type of set up could help some other noobs like me too 👍 

Much love~

```

var TopDownTransition = Barba.BaseTransition.extend({

  start: function() {
    Promise
      .all([this.newContainerLoading, this.fadeOut()])
      .then(this.fadeIn.bind(this));
  },

  fadeOut: function() {
    return $(this.oldContainer).animate({ opacity: 0 }).promise();
  },

  fadeIn: function() {
    var _this = this;
    var $el = $(this.newContainer);

    $(this.oldContainer).hide();
    $el.css({
      visibility : 'visible',
      opacity : 0
    });

    $el.animate({ opacity: 1 }, 400, function() {
        _this.done();
    });

  tl = gsap.timeline();
  },

  valid: function() {
    var prev = Barba.HistoryManager.prevStatus();
    return prev.namespace === 'home' && (window.innerWidth > 800);
  }
});


var DownTopTransition = Barba.BaseTransition.extend({
  
start: function() {
    Promise
      .all([this.newContainerLoading, this.fadeOut()])
      .then(this.fadeIn.bind(this));
  },

  fadeOut: function() {
    return $(this.oldContainer).animate({ opacity: 0 }).promise();
  },

  fadeIn: function() {
    var _this = this;
    var $el = $(this.newContainer);

    $(this.oldContainer).hide();
    $el.css({
      visibility : 'visible',
      opacity : 0
    });

    $el.animate({ opacity: 1 }, 400, function() {
        _this.done();
    });

  tl2 = gsap.timeline();
  },

  valid: function() {
    var prev = Barba.HistoryManager.prevStatus();
    return prev.namespace === 'program' && (window.innerWidth > 800);
  }

});


Barba.Pjax.getTransition = function() { 
 if (TopDownTransition.valid()) {
    return TopDownTransition;
  }
  if (DownTopTransition.valid()) {
    return DownTopTransition;
  }
};

Hello, firstly thanks for this beautiful app.

How do I show the load percentage when loading a page and page transitions?  For example;

**Logger** can be used in some situation to **improve code understanding in dev mode**.

For example, this code display the console message every time and doesn't throw any warning...

```js
barba.init({
  transitions: [{
    name: 'default',
    from: 'home',
    leave: () => {
      console.log('leaving the home page...');
    }
  }]
});
```

... but in fact, the `from` attribute is waiting for an `object`, not a `string`.

This could **mislead the user** when using Barba if he is not properly reading the documentation.
It would be really handy for the documentation to contain a complete lifecycle diagram, that includes both view and transition functions, for both normal and 'appear' cycles

Currently I have to fill my functions with console logs to understand when, say, the views `beforeEnter` is called in relation to the transitions `beforeEnter` etc, would be good to have a simple diagram to look at
Hi, I have a problem with the css and js files. I would like to use different style sheets and scripts on the various pages. when I open the page everything normally works, but when I change the page using the transition it is not loaded. How can I solve it?

for example
in the contact page i want to use contact.css. contact.css is used only in this page. when I access the page directly the css works correctly but when i came from (for example) index.html that doesn't have contatti.css the style doesn't load.
