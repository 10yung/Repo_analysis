1.SDNNi,SDANN functions seem not  to be suitable for their variables .
2. The second nBins seems not  to be commented.
Am I right ?
When I run an analysis no output is given but also no error. What could be the reason? Thank you for your help.
When I run large files of data such as synthethic_rr.txt that corresponds to 24h data, the GUI gets stuck sometimes at Non-linear or Time-Freq.
