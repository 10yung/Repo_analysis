#18: Avoiding inserting blank lines at the end of project files by using `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText` instead of `out-file`
#19: Removed `<SolutionDir Condition="$(SolutionDir) == '' Or $(SolutionDir) == '*Undefined*'">..\</SolutionDir>`
#20: Using the same file encoding when saving the file

I have Visual Studio 2013 and 2015 installed.

I have a directory that contains Visual Studio 2013 sln files.
When I double-click on the sln files, they open in Visual Studio 2013 without issues.

However, after running `migrateToAutomaticPackageRestore.ps1` on that directory, double-clicking on the sln files opens them in Visual Studio 2015.

Files with the extension sln are associated with the "Microsoft Visual Studio Version Selector".

The problem is that the sln files were originally saved using ANSI encoding, but `migrateToAutomaticPackageRestore.ps1` changed them to use UTF-8 encoding and this is what caused the issue.

Re-saving the sln files back to ANSI, and then double-clicking them opens in Visual Studio 2013 as expected.

I'm thinking the script should save the files in their original encoding.

Thank you.

Running `migrateToAutomaticPackageRestore.ps1` doesn't remove the following line in the project files:
`<SolutionDir Condition="$(SolutionDir) == '' Or $(SolutionDir) == '*Undefined*'">..\</SolutionDir>`

That line is added when Enabling NuGet Package Restore on the solution in Visual Studio 2013 Update 5 and NuGet Package Manager v2.8.60723.765.

Thank you.
