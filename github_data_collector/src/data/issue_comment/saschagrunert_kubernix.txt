[demo@nixos:~/kubernix]$ KUBERNIX_LOG_LEVEL=debug sudo -E ./target/release/kubernix --nodes=2 -l debug
[ERROR] Timed out waiting for process 'API Server' (kube-apiserver) to become ready
[ERROR] Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager) died unexpectedly
```

Could you possibly point me to how these nodes are running? How can I gain access to them for debugging/inspecting?
I don't see any docker process running quite strangely. Is there some way I can transfer docker images to the kubernetes "nodes" - so I can later on reference them in deployments etc?

Sorry, much more of question than an issue!

Hello, just thought I'd give this a try - but ran into some errors above.

Where are the logs meant to show up?
    % sudo ./target/release/kubernix --nodes=2
    [sudo] password for s:

This happens on NixOS 19.09.

Built from the latest v0.2.0 release.
Hey @saschagrunert, 

Awesome project :tada: :hugs: I was wondering if you wanted to provide kubernix as a package/derivation in [`NixOS/nixpkgs`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) or in a [*Nix User Repository*](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) ?

That would make it even easier to use and adopt :angel: 
We currently cannot release a new version because [clap 3](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) is not released yet.
This was working up until today but after building and running `sudo kubernix` I get this error:
`Error: Unable to load config file 'kubernix-run/kubernix.toml':  missing field 'impure' at line 1 column 1`

It looks like something simple and I will look into it. Running this on Manjaro.

This is what the kubernix-run/kubernix.toml file looks like:
```
root = "kubernix-run"
log-level = "INFO"
crio-cidr = "10.100.0.0/16"
cluster-cidr = "10.200.0.0/16"
service-cidr = "10.50.0.0/24"
```
If Nix is already installed, there shouldn't be a need to run as root.
