## Description

>**`Set-JiraUser` would be extremely powerful if you could revoke a users site access as well as remove them from groups. The latter we are able to do already, but the users still seem to have site access regardless. This is in regards to Jira cloud and not Jira server.**



We ran into an issue this week due to Get-JiraIssueComment being completely broken for us in versions prior to the following change: https://github.com/AtlassianPS/JiraPS/commit/76f2156627587c4fae371a5f6d3a350bd986ca9d#diff-3d2c0736f2b14e5401333a532d785924. With `Paging` set to `$true` the function seems to end up searching jira for comments endlessly. With `Paging` set to `$false` the function works as expected.

## Possible Solution

Probably because no resolvable function Resolve-JiraIssueObject @ line 86 of https://github.com/AtlassianPS/JiraPS/blob/master/JiraPS/Public/Add-JiraIssueAttachment.ps1 and need Get-JiraIssue instead.

        $issueObj = Resolve-JiraIssueObject -InputObject $Issue -Credential $Credential

## Description

Running `Get-JiraUser -Username ''` (or variants) returns users successfully, but their `EmailAddress` property is blank.

This seems to be down to a change in the API; but reporting here as the field is returned, so people would expect it to be populated.  I'm logging this more for the benefit of others encountering this issue than for a bugfix in this module, as I don't think it's fixable within this module, but is rather a restriction of the API.

The reason we see the EmailAddress property is because it's assigned here: https://github.com/AtlassianPS/JiraPS/blob/0c081ad647f1d2102699229990d54c914b3579df/JiraPS/Private/ConvertTo-JiraUser.ps1#L18
The reason this is blank is because the API no longer populated an EmailAddress field (e.g. going to https://mytenant.atlassian.net/rest/api/latest/user?maxResults=1&username=ExactExampleUsername does not include a mail address).

Atlassian have documented removing this field here: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/deprecation-notice-user-privacy-api-migration-guide/

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Run `Get-JiraUser -Username '' | Select -First 1 *`
2. Unless the first user found is your account, the email address property will be blank.

## Expected behavior

The user's email address should be populated.

## Possible Solution

Navigate to: https://myTenant.atlassian.net/secure/admin/ViewApplicationProperties.jspa
If you see: `User email visibility` set to `Show to logged in users only`, that is the cause.

In theory, to resolve, click `Edit Settings` (top right) then change `User Email Visibility` to `Public`.
Sadly initial tests have shown that info still doesn't come through the API / it seems this issue was discovered and reported ~2 years ago: https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Get-emailAddress-of-user-with-REST-API/qaq-p/718538

Note: I'm not sure whether JiraPS could show a warning explaining why this information is not shown when it's not retrieved?

Alternatively happy for this to be closed as it's not a JiraPS bug; just wanted to ensure the ticket's here to help others hitting this issue in future.

<!-- Provide a general summary of your changes in the Title above -->
A pull request that fixes an issue #45
### Description
This pull request allow to use few sessions to Jira server in same time.
For ex.:
```
Get-Issue -Key "AA-0000" -Session $sessionA
Get-Issue -Key "AA-0000" -Session $sessionB
Get-Issue -Key "AA-0000" -Session "SessionNameA"
Get-Issue -Key "AA-0000" -Session "SessionNameB"
```

### Motivation and Context
There is project exists that I work for.
The project requires to write a scripts that fetch information from one Jira server and create an issue on other Jira server.
Current version of JiraPS does not allow such behaviors without call to Set-JiraConfigServer.
Therefore, the pull request allow to skip a switching Jira server between cmdlets calls.

Hello team, i got a question where i can't found any reply.
We use could jira and we use a functionality called "Comment Internally" to avoid users seeing our comment on their requests.
I can't se in any issue or wiki how to add an internal comment via jiraps, have you some feature to do this ?

Thanks a lot for your reply,
Alex

## Context

> **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

Way back in #1, I mentioned that it was not possible to set users as active vs. inactive via the REST API. To my surprise, [the Atlassian issue I've been tracking for years](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-37294) has been updated, and they've finally added support for this in JIRA 8.3.0.

Since it is now possible to manage this via REST, we should add support for it in this project.

## Description

> **Describe the solution you'd like**

* Add a new parameter for Set-JiraUser: `-Enabled [bool]`
* If the parameter is provided, add `active: [true | false]` to the body of the REST endpoint
* If the parameter is not provided, do not change the user's active state

## Additional Information

Atlassian's doc on the [user endpoint](https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/8.3.0/#api/2/user-updateUser) contains the `active` property.

I have not tested this myself, as I don't have access to a new enough JIRA environment to play with.

I don't recommend doing a check of the JIRA server version before trying to set this property, as that would negatively impact performance. Instead, this would just be a "user beware" feature that is marked in the documentation as not usable on versions of JIRA older than 8.3.0.

This should also be a pretty simple change for anyone looking to get their feet wet contributing to the project.
