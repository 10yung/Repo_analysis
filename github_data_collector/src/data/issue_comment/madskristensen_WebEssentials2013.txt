With v5 of Font Awesome, the fa class prefix is replaced with far or fas. After updating my code, I get the following warning: 

When using "fa-xxx", you must also specify the class "fa".

When I Inspect element in the elements, I see that my SCSS code is already being output to CSS. If I click on it it will redirect me to .CSS file. Is there a way for me to get the line number of the .SCSS so that I can pinpoint directly where that code is and do my changes rather than finding the classes and elements in the scss or sass file? 

For example:

![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5573444/33274890-3e9d9246-d389-11e7-9dac-942986908c63.PNG)

In chrome debug, it points to the CSS file line number 28, but in my scss file that code is not in line number 28, but in a different line.

Is there another way to debug it or get the line number of the scss file?

Thank you.
- [ ] the 'ng' shortcuts create import statements like:
       ```
       import { Component } from 'angular/core';
       ```
       instead of:
       ```
       import { Component } from '@angular/core';
       ```

- [ ] auto 'Enable automatic nesting' and 'Auto-nest selected items' do not work (even though automatic nesting is enabled).  I have to manually right-click on my *.ts file to nest it under my *.html file.
## Web-Essential-2.6.26 : Bundle doesn't minify properly, vendor specific keyframes removed. (Critical bug)

When we minifiy css using bundle, it removes the vendor specific animation, which breaks the css. 

Examples are shown in the below screenshots. Please let me know if there is any confusion. Moreover, this is a critical bug, should be fixed.

Code Differences (Left Bundled-Style.css, Right we have Bundled-Style.min.css which is beautified to compare):

Sorry for creating an issue, but I wasn't sure where else to turn to.

I'm using Web Essentials 2013, but the current project setup has an entire IIS dev environment set up on my local machine. Most of the content is static content, but it gets served through mylocalmachine.companytld.com on our intranet.

Attempting to access the application over localhost doesn't work as it messes up the networking calls / authentication.

How can I use browser link with the above setup? I'm assuming I probably can't, as Web Essentials is setting up it's own server when run from Visual Studios?
I have file name xyz.dev.js and I want minify file name is xyz.js not xyz.dev.min.js.  Is there any way to solve this problem as soon as possible. 

I have tried to resolve this thing using hacks, but my bad luck. Please help me to resolve this issue 
Ever since I installed this update Browser Link is broken.  The script gets injected into the html page, but the browser cannot open the url stating that the connection was refused.

In Chrome:
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
http://localhost:52779/8608c9ddda774c02a3bf542f3da891b6/browserLink

This is the closest SO article that describes the issue, and I went through everything on the list. Still broken.

Disabled my firewall, tried different browsers, verified port conflicts, etc.
I am having a problem, I can't minify a css codes by [rightClick on page]>Web Essentials>Minify selection...

HTML is not minified when using the HTML bundler with minify set to true if you have your HTML within script tags. Not sure if anything inside the script tags would minify. This could be FAD, but it would be great if the minifier would either also minify content within script tags, especially if the type="text/ng-template". Bundling HTML seems like a perfect solution for placing Angular app view templates into the cache... if it could get beyond the script tag.
