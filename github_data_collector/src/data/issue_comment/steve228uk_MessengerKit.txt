Does this library support the pagination in chat ? I'm using pagination in my chat app.
how can send image or video ? there isn't any button in input view for this !
i need help adding a small UILabel to the text chat bubble  which will display the time the message was sent/created, after i edited the xib file , and added the UIlabel it breaks the existing constraint . any help will be appreciated

It lacks a trailing constraint for incomingText :

Hello, how can we add pull to refresh to load more messages.

Like I use following component: https://github.com/CRAnimation/CRRefresh
On  collectionView/tableview. But MesengerKit collectionview is put private so cannot add CRRefresh. Any suggestions?
When adding new multiline message in section it looks like below screen shot

Getting App crashed:
in this line MessengerKit.bundle

private func loadFromDefaultNib() {
        let view = UINib(nibName: "MSGMessengerView", bundle: MessengerKit.bundle)
            .instantiate(withOwner: self, options: nil).first as? MSGMessengerView
        
        view?.frame = CGRect.zero
        view?.backgroundView.backgroundColor = style.inputViewBackgroundColor
        view?.add(collectionView)
        view?.add(messageInputView)
        
        self.view = view
   }

This issue is probably not caused by your code, but when you add an Image via UIImagepicker, then the image turns out like this.

, but when you just load an image from your assets it turns out normal.

I think that the UIImagepicker is messing up the constraints somehow, but I don't know how to solve this problem.


Hi!
First, I wonder, is there a way to hide `messageInputView` param, because for certain cases I don't need it.
And second - how to add another subviews in hierarchy? or just button?
Are there any legal way to di this things?
Thanks!
