Hi, I think I've found a bug in "perfectElimOrder.m".

the following code 

"G = [ 0  1/3  0   0  ;
     1/2  0   0  1/2 ;
      0   0   0  1/2 ;
      0  1/2 1/2  0];

[order, chordal, cliques, numpa] = perfectElimOrder(G,1);
cliques{3}"

generate 3rd clique as 
">> cliques{3}
ans =
     4     4"

The problem is in line 47 => "C{i} = [pa i];" should be replaced by "C{i} = [pa u];". It gives in this case: 
"cliques{3}
ans =
     4     3"
which is correct and confirmed by another similar function : "maxCardinalitySearch.m".

There is also a problem when the starting initial node choice in "perfectElimOrder.m". Nothing works except the case where "initNode=1" which is default value.

Regards
Anton
