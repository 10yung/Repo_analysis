Help plz fix this.

Any suggestions, for writing a custom control, that will do a plot using the canvas ?

Unfortunately due to a severe lack of spare time, I'm no longer able to maintain GXUI.

While I'd hoped to find a few spare hours here and there to fix all the issues I've been itching to fix, I'm weeks away from becoming a father for the first time. While this is exciting and terrifying in equal measures, it's also clear that I'm simply not going to find those spare cycles.

I've updated the landing page to point to [other GUI Go libraries](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#gui), but I'd also like to highlight the awesome work going on the shiny experimental package ([proposal](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/11818), [project](https://github.com/golang/exp/tree/master/shiny)) which has some remarkably smart people working on it.

I'd like to thank those of you that have contributed to GXUI, and a special shout-out to @shurcooL who made GXUI [do things I still can't quite believe](https://github.com/google/gxui/issues/49#issue-63381443).

Cheers,

Text looks tiny.  I'm not sure if it's an OS limitation, but other apps such as Chrome look great.

Thanks.

how to read a pixel on a canvas?

Hello, i get the error, when run every samples (for example https://github.com/google/gxui/tree/master/samples/hello_world), 

Error on the screen
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5772019/10124476/a7b880b0-655e-11e5-820f-30fa79f01c67.png)

Help plz fix this =)

I'm currently trying to build the package on Windows 7, but I'm getting some strange errors. I go into the gxui folder, run

go get ./...

and get a popup window from cc1.exe saying

"the procedure entry point **printf** could not be located in the dynamic link library libintl-8.dll.".

I get the same error twice and the console displays:

go build github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.1/glfw: C:\Go\pkg\tool\windows_amd64\cgo.exe: exit status 2
go build github.com/go-gl/gl/v2.1/gl: C:\Go\pkg\tool\windows_amd64\cgo.exe: exit status 2

I tried searching for cc1.exe, but can't find one anywhere on my system. As for libintl-8.dll - I have about 10 copies of it in various folders it seems. Most recent one I installed along with gcc as a part of WinBuilds.

I'm running Windows 7, 64 bit. My Go version is go1.4.2 .

now the textbox control has a on line height default, I want the textbox to be a fixed height on show, and  also I need a SetEditable(bool) func.
