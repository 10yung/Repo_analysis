I'm unable to get a successfull installation of sas_kernel on windows 10 with anaconda 3.7.
The documentation appears to be outdated in a number of areas.

The defaults for the install of Anaconda on windows 10 do not place it in C:\ProgramData\Anaconda...

The installation options regarding PATH environment variable are no longer the same as those shown in the screen shot and different default values are checked and recommended.

Can someone validate, from start to finish, a complete install with the current version of Anaconda for windows 10 and document the steps?


While troubleshooting an install issue (rare), pip wouldn't install sas_kernel cleanly.  The last gasp looked like the following:

PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda3\\Lib\\site-packages\\ipykernel\\codeutil.py'

A note or other friendly reminder in the install section of the doc to use elevated privs (if python was installed with elevated privs) might be worthwhile.
Hi,
when we try to use completion function to ask SAS code sugestion, it doesn't work correctly.
=> With SAS PROC, you haven't suggestion on options.
PROC SORT DA => Jupyter NB doesn't suggest DATA option.
=> With Data step, the suggestion only is you writes a correct statement before.
DATA T ;
  SE => Jupyter NB doesn't suggest statement. It suggest only if you write SET completly.
I attach a doc with my tests and associated kernal error.

Same setup as #40 . This post was originally part of #41 but I think they are separate issues so I split.

This [notebok](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snorehorse/sas-demos/master/program-flow-and-error-checking/Easier%20SAS%20data%20quality%20checks%20and%20program%20flow.ipynb) is not rendering correctly in Jupyter (launched within SAS University Edition).

When working in the notebook, the code under "Check for dupes" as well as "Check for MSRP outliers" doesn't display in the browser. However, the output shows when it is run. The code, does however show when rendered with nbviewer. Will post a screenshot soon.

Might be a problem with the CodeMirror sas.js? I'll work on debugging.

There's weird red boxes around parts of the code & results after "Get the total number of bad rows":

There are `<span class="err">` tags being rendered.
Edit 20170710 - 10 PM Refreshed: [This is my GitHub hosted Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/snorehorse/sas-demos/blob/snorehorse-test-1/reproduce_bad_print.ipynb)

The MSRP column contains HTML that doesn't belong, it skips every other observation, and the table loses its color formatting.

I tried changing the line endings to CR/LF instead of just LF, but this made no difference.

### As displayed by the GitHub render (the table looks weird, this shows the issue):

### What it should look like, as displayed by Jupyter editor window via University Edition:

The problem exists for both Chrome & Microsoft Edge, on Windows 10 64bit.

In the image, it does show any code, but it DOES contains some code

attach the notebook, please rename back to ipynb

thanks
I downloaded the notebook as PDF and I do not see the SAS outputs in the file. It shows the following in the PDF output "<IPython.core.display.HTML object>" instead of the actual output and graphs. Is there a way to enable inline magics options as the same way we do in Python notebook, so that the plots can also be include when we download the notebook as PDF.

Foreg: %matplotlib inline
After I execute the above command using Python Shell, I can see graph when I download the notebook as PDF.
