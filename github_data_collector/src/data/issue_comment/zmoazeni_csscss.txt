The `saas` gem has now been deprecated and users have been advised to switch to the `saasc` gem. Unfortunately, the `saas` gem is a dependency to `csscss`. Any plans to use the `saasc` gem for this?
Running the following 
```
@charset "UTF-8";
/**{void}*/
.grid__row {
  display: block;
  width: 102.27273%;
  margin-left: -1.13636%;
  margin-right: -1.13636%;
}
```
with command  
csscss --show-parser-errors styles.css

gives following

Hi,

I encountered the problem that the CSS parser includes comments in selector names. Example CSS:

``` css
/* A comment before a selector*/
h1 {
   /* 
     some redundant selectors here
     ...
   */ 
}
```

Let's assume h1 contains redundancy and ends up in the JSON structure. This JSON structure now contains a selector in the list called `"/* A comment before a selector*/h1"`, while the correct selector is just "h1".

The same problem occurs when having a `@charset` declaration just before a selector.

Thanks in advance!

I was just cleaning up an extension that was initially developed two years ago:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/csscssbeauty

It spawns a server, reads the output from csscss and displays it on the website in a beautified format. The server will reload when the watched files change to always have the latest results.

Feel free to add csscssbeauty to the list of community extensions.

resolve #94 
resolve #93 
This could use some code review. 
First time with ruby, thanks to @icijavon.
Tried to match the style you had in the files.
I'm easy about changes so feel free to kill this in Code Review and I'll fix it up.

I could use some help finding out how to identify selectors that are nested(ex. @media) to have a accurate report.  Is any variable set to identify what nested area a selector is in?

Test instructions
1)gem install bundle
2)pull branch
3)Install dependencies: bundle install
4) Run tests: bundle exec rake test
5) to test your own css file run: bundle exec csscss my_css_file

@zmoazeni Thanks for the great tool
Is there anything that does this?  If not I would be interested contributing this.

Example css file:

```
.pizza{
    font-size: 16px;
    color: #ff0000;
    display: none;
}

.pizza {
    overflow: auto;
    padding: 1em;
}
```

If i run csscss on the above file i would like to get something like:

```
2 rule sets with same selector ".pizza"  at Lines: 1 , 7
```

Code Snippet:

div.main {
width : 100%;
}

div.main {
background : white;
}

Expected output:
These two rules should be merged to one.

Actual output:
Nothing.

Hi, 

I'm not completely sure if this is a bug, or if I'm not doing something correct.

OS: OSX Yosemite 10.10 (tried on OSX Mavericks 10.9.5)
Ruby Version: ruby 2.0.0p481
CSSCSS Version: 1.3.3

Installation steps:
1) Install brew
2) brew install gem
3) gem install csscss

test.css: 
body { 
background-color: red;
}
body { 
background-color: red;
}

Command: 
csscss -v test.css 

Expected: Some indication that body has a duplicate tag
Actuall: nothing

Also,

When I try this command: 
csscss https://webassetimvu-a.akamaihd.net/asset/e78ffdf5a603e786/build/web3d/web3d-app.css
It just hangs.

It also hangs when I pull down the file and run it directly on that file.

When I kill the file, I get this call stack:

    from /usr/bin/csscss:23:in `<main>'

Let me know if you have any other questions. Pretty slick tool and I'm excited to get it working!

Thanks,
Hayden

I've been using csscss for a little bit while refactoring a lot of plain css and I noticed it wasn't easy to see if changes made were reducing the total amount of redundancy. 

So I added a counter to the end of the output so that a dev can quickly see if what they changed actually made an impact.

I'm using a lot of CSS shortcodes and it doesn't seem right that something like:

`margin: 15px 0;` and `margin:30px 0;` would be seen as having duplicates for `margin-left` and `margin-right`.

Thoughts?
