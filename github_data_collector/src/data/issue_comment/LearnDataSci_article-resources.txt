the following line of code is throwing  "ValueError: Grouper for '1.0' not 1-dimensional"

sns.barplot(x, nmi_results, palette='Blues', ax=ax1)



here in 354 error is  displaying as "list attribute has no attribute items"
Hey guys, I did some changes such as

cm.colors since it was throwing an error not knowing it came from matplotlib
Changed len(y) since the variable y wasn't defined
Changed list.values to enumerate(list) since list doesn't have attribute values.

I used Python 3.7, not sure that breaks anything.
