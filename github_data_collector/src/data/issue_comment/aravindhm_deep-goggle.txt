Hi there, may I ask a question about something you mentioned in your original paper, which is irrelevant to this project I believe? 
In page 8 of your paper, you said and I quote here: "CNN-A contains in fact two subsets of feature
channels which are independent for the first several layers(up to norm2)". You also said that this idea was mentioned in Krizhevsky's paper, but I didn't find relevant contents. I have to say I didn't go through  Krizhevsky's paper, could you tell me where can I find it, and Is there any other paper that mentioned similar ideas? Looking forward to your reply.
