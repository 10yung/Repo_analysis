When I send a image with a high resolution (1980*1024 for example) to Gotify server, the image is very large in the display.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Apply a default size (585px for example) in the display or show the image as an attachment.

Having an option to show the `created datetime` instead of `timeago` for messages, see [here](https://github.com/gotify/server/blob/6dc783d99d27571c5488da52ae563997f6f225df/ui/src/message/Message.tsx#L102).

I want to create and maintain a platform independent docker-compose file to build my home automation system on any hardware, x86 VPS or Arm SBC.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be useful therefore if Gotify were to use the Docker Multi-Arch build process so that it only be referenced by gotify/server regardless of which platform it is running on. (https://www.docker.com/blog/multi-arch-images/)

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I could attempt to do the build process myself but it would then mean it would slowly drift out of sync with any updates and Watchtower would not work unless I went in and rebuilt the image myself when I knew there was an update.

**Additional context**
The Multi-Arch build process also builds more Arm versions than just v7 for example it also builds v6 and arm64 which would enable wider support of devices (older Pi's) or performance gains on more modern arm64 devices.

Hi all,

I'm trying to replace Pushbullet and am brand spanking new to Gotify. I just installed the server, and now am looking for a client that I can install on my windows machines to popup notifications as they come in, like PB does. Is there one available?

TIA

Hi! I would like to inquire if there's any plan for a desktop client?

Yes, the web app is functional with sufficient features, however, the web push-based notifications will not work after the tab is closed. Even if we employ a service worker in the background, it still will not work after the chrome process has exited. Such limitation makes those who want to view notifications on a, for example, a windows desktop, quite difficult.

However, I understand the weight of maintaining another desktop app, so this is not submitted as a feature request, rather as a question. 

So, are there any plans for a basic desktop client?

No

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A way of configuring the server to listen on a unix socket.
For example you could join the `listenaddr` and the `port` into a 
single option called `listen`. Then the `listen` option could either 
get passed `localhost:1234` or `unix:/tmp/gotify.sock`.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
n/a

Hi

It would be nice if the web app provide a way to search and list the messages. Also would be nice if the cli app can do that too.

thanks

**Describe your problem**
I was just curious if there are any plans to have the WebUI clean up old clients that are no longer in use, or perhaps reuse the same client? It's somewhat annoying to see a client created for each and every WebUI login, and from a security perspective I don't like that all these tokens are out there until I manually delete them all. Of course I can go in and delete them, though this is somewhat tedious and it would be really nice if there were a way to avoid this in the first place.

Cheers!

Anyone with a Server behind HAProxy?

I always got Timeouts after ~1 Minute... 
Already tried difference timeouts but nothing helps...

Thanks

This is a feature request to provide amd64 bit builds of `gotify` server available for download. Currently OpenBSD isn't a download option. 
See here: https://github.com/gotify/server/releases/tag/v2.0.5

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to be able to download a tar gz file of `gotify` server, then uncompress, which would run on OpenBSD amd64.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
None. I think development should switch to whatever current platform they're using now to OpenBSD. ;) See here: https://why-openbsd.rocks/

**Additional context**
I will give a thumbs up once an OpenBSD amd64 bit build is made available.
