I just started using Seedbank (v 0.5.0) and everytime I run rake db:seed, I am running into this issue - **NameError: wrong constant name #Class:0x447eef8** 

I am trying to add just one record to start with and I haven't been able to take off. I am on Rails 5.1.6 and Ruby 2.3.3.

Does anyone have any thoughts on how to resolve this issue? Is anyone using this gem with the latest versions of Ruby on Rails without any issues?

Hi,

I have a hook in my Rspec config to run my test seeds with Seedbank before my test suite runs. Worked great until I tried to upgrade Seedbank to 0.5.0, now I get this error:

```
An error occurred in a `before(:suite)` hook.
Failure/Error: Rake::Task["db:seed:test"].invoke

RuntimeError:
  Don't know how to build task 'environment' (see --tasks)
# ./spec/rails_helper.rb:66:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'
# -e:1:in `<main>'
```

Here are the relevant lines from my config:

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  # ...
  config.before(:suite) {
    Seedbank.load_tasks
    Rake::Task["db:seed:test"].invoke
  }
  # ...
```

What is the recommended way of accomplishing this? I don't believe I can do `Rails.application.load_seed` with Seedbank.

It works fine on 0.4.0.

Thanks!

After this PR merged we can use customized file names by overriding `Seedbank.original_seeds_file`
This PR allows to add a configuration file to seedbank in order to define 2 lambdas, before_each and after_each, executed before and after every seed file.
Those lambdas can help set and clean up any particular state that depends on file system, redis, etc.
The example `rake db:seed:development:users` seems to actually only run `db/seeds/development/users.seeds.rb`. Is there any way to force some common/shared code to load beforehand without having to do `after` or `require` in every single individual seed file?
It's possible to use active record reflections to create a seed running order, treating belongs_to as something like dependencies as we see in bundler. It would be great if seedbank used reflection to guess which seed files to run first. I can show you some code that might help -- or I can implement it with a pull request when I get some time, though it would be good to see if you think it's useful first.
Add a new rake task to set up db layers for non-rails setups and update README to provide at least one example of this.
I dont think seedbank is currently supported for these. Has it ever been considered? Would you have a few tips on what it might require?
