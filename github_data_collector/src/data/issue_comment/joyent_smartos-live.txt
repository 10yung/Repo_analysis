[root@boron ~]# vmadm create -f bsd.json
Missing required properties: disks.1.size
```
Disk 1 is a nocreate disk that will be the install media file, so it has no size.

```json
    {
      "model": "virtio",
      "media": "disk",
      "path": "/install66.fs",
      "nocreate": true
    }
```

If I add a size it works, but the property is not use!

```json
    {
      "model": "virtio",
      "media": "disk",
      "path": "/install66.fs",
      "size": "450",
      "nocreate": true
    }
```

```
[root@boron ~]# vmadm get ca8c724f-0642-675d-b806-c231fc1b1fc0 | json disk
```
```json
[
  {
    "path": "/dev/zvol/rdsk/zones/ca8c724f-0642-675d-b806-c231fc1b1fc0/disk0",
    "boot": false,
    "model": "virtio",
    "media": "disk",
    "pci_slot": "0:4:0",
    "uuid": "6be6d3db-a279-c205-92ea-f2aa9ed9fe8f",
    "zfs_filesystem": "zones/ca8c724f-0642-675d-b806-c231fc1b1fc0/disk0",
    "zpool": "zones",
    "size": 10240,
    "compression": "off",
    "refreservation": 10563,
    "block_size": 8192
  },
  {
    "path": "/install66.fs",
    "boot": false,
    "model": "virtio",
    "media": "disk",
    "pci_slot": "0:4:1",
    "uuid": "f068b082-2358-4222-ceb8-d4e569876fac",
    "missing": true
  }
]
```

So for non zvol (nocreate) the size restriction should probably relaxed.

Talking with @rmustacc  he stated that SmartOS disables deep c states which have unfortunate consequences with turbo boost. Is it possible to enable Turbo boost?

Sometimes it is useful to get a shell in a docker zone, zlogin -i /native/usr/sbin/dockerexec bash usually does the trick.

It looks like vmadm console is not hooked up for docker so it might be nice to have that do zlogin + dockerexec.

Maybe with an optional shell path that can be set in the vmadm payload.

[16:04:35] sjorge :: andyf what are the UEFI bhyve changes in the latest release?
[11:41:24] @andyf ::  sjorge - yes, and the OmniOS ones :D
[11:41:46] @andyf ::  The firmware should work fine on SmartOS too, but I haven't tested
[22:34:44] @andyf ::  jorge - now that I am not trying to type on my 'phone
[22:35:18] @andyf :: sjorge - the new firmware is based on https://github.com/freebsd/uefi-edk2/tree/bhyve/edk2-stable201903
```

I will ask for the binary and give it a test spin this week.
This PR replaces #863

Original work done by @jclulow, man page update + tests done by @sjorge

I couldn't get a full ./runtests to complete because under vmware fusion both kvm and bhyve fail.
I verified they also fail in an unmodified PI. There is a iso with the changes available here:
https://pkg.blackdot.be/extras/platform-20191224T122406Z.iso

Aditional testing: been using the original change for a few months now as I was carrying it around as a patch with a few other bits.
