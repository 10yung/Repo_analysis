So after configuring telegram with id and token i get this wierd error, not sure if it's a server side issue on my side or if it just doesn't want to connect to telegram.

"An error has occurred while sending the Telegram notification: Unknown " 

This message appears while im trying to test the connection.

API is a 45 letters, numbers and symbols combination and ChatID is a 9 number configuration right?

ChatID should be located under user config and API in config if im correct? this should be documented more in case i missed something out and i taught it was straight forward this way.

If there is a log for only the telegram notification i can't find it and log i empty.

Also, the server im running this trough is not on port 80 or 443 in case that's a issue to make this work.
#99 #495 #566 #610

I've added the ability to check UDP services, just needed to tweak `fsockopen` since it assumes TCP by default, so essentially I've added a MySQL enum field which defaults to TCP, edited the templates, added the English localization. I was nearly going to implement auto selection by port via javascript but it would be inconvenient to the user if they wanted to override it wrestling with event listeners, so I assume TCP by default unless the user overrides it by selecting UDP since most people are monitoring TCP services.

Let me know if you need more tweaking or suggestions.

Resolves #820, #384, #494.
Because this raises a warning, it won't send a notification.

Please review.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
- i can also use email, but i dont see it as often as xmpp
- i am using telegram, but i dont like to use non-opensource proprietary services


When updating any information of a server, the changes don't register in the database at all. With debug on, no errors are output, nothing comes into the log, it comes back to the server list screen but no changes have been made. The same happens when adding/removing servers, changes aren't pushed through to database. When editing user accounts, or config settings all changes push through fine, the cronjob also updates server detail without any issues.

I also managed to clear the log, but there no new log entries after that although I've done management/config changes, the cronjob has run, and I've done a manual update within the website.

PHP v2.7.17
MySQL v5.7.26
PSM v3.4.5

Issue has been happening since 3.4.0'ish (just ran a full upgrade from there)

PSM is a great tool but somewhat limited in what it can check and there are lots of requests for new check types (certificates, etc...).  Also everyone's needs are unique when it comes to how exactly checks and alerts should happen.

It is possible to add custom check for which PSM would run user-created shell script and update status depending on what it returns?

It would add a lot of flexibility. Certificate checks, domain expiration, local server state (e.g. low disk space or process not running). Then users could share best scripts, maybe create library of select ones here. It would be easy to adapt existing scripts for use with PSM.

1. User uploads/creates shell scripts in dedicated PSM folder.
2. When creating new custom check, user specifies external script name and expected results (OK/Warning/Down if ... - similar to current website check) and timeout.
3. PSM runs the script when check happens, updates the status according to set parameters (i.e. if script returns code set for "warning", status is set to Warning, if script returns code for "down", status is set to Down, even if it keeps happening continuously). If script times out, PSM considers check unsuccessful and kills the script. If it happens more times than "warning threshold" then status is set to down.

P.S. I saw #102 but in my opinion it is not quite the same. I think many users would lack expertise to write custom check methods themselves while various monitoring scripts already exist or can be created more easily.
When I add a new user it Throws the ' You can't remove the last administrator.' error and makes the user an administrator. This can be changed back to user afterwards.
Hi there

I would like to monitor Let's Encrypt certs to ensure that websites are loading and displaying correctly.

Would anyone know how to setup a monitoring service that would trigger an alert if a certificate was not valid (failed to auto renew) .

It seems that the standard monitoring still finds the website active with or without a valid certificate (as the error warning are browser based and not bot based - I presume)

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
