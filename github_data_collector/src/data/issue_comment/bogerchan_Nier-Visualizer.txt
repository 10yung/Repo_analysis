会添加鲸云音效那种炫酷的效果吗
我曾经尝试过，但是不行，只好放弃使用了。主要用作播放语音消息时，这个时候如果弹窗需要获取录音权限会给用户带来误解的。希望作者能够支持一下，谢谢！
Hi! This library is awesome. Thank you for that!

I'm working in a project which I need to use a CircleSolidRenderer customized and below that I need to put an ColumnType4Renderer. My problem is that I need both work together, I mean, both shoudl be started by a NierVisualizerManager. I coudn't start them by the same manager and neighter by two separeted managers (using the same media player, only one animation is started)

Could you help me? Is it possible?
