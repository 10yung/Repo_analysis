requires license key now
Hi antonioribeiro,

I was trying to figure out why there were frequent database calls to put the firewall list in memory, even though the config `cache_expire_time` was set to 60 (minutes), and it turns out as of Laravel 5.8, that value is now seconds, to fall in line with other libraries and PSRs.

Just giving you notice to update your config comments.
Thanks again for providing this package!
URL used for updating GeoIP database doesn't work:

Think that maybe subdomain is removed because nameservers don't point to valid records:

[EDIT] Found out that this is probably the reason:

Apparently I'm getting a lot of these errors because the code (Firewall.php:270) is relying on HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR which can contain multiple addresses separated by commas.
In v2.3.0 with Laravel  5.8.35 on 7.2.18, only the `firewall:list` and `firewall:updategeoip` exists, the rest is missing.
I have been using this firewall package for a while.  Thank you!!!  Today for the first time, I had a use case where I needed to assign a url to redirect_non_whitelisted_to in my firewall config.  After doing so, I noticed the redirect was not working for non-whitelisted users.  It returned the http response code defined in the responses.whitelist config value but was completely ignoring the redirect_non_whitelisted_to config value.

I investigated further and noticed a refactor at commit 075b69b, which appears to have removed the condition to check the value of redirect_non_whitelisted_to.  I refactored the Whitelist filter function a little bit to fix this.
Is it also possible to temporarily block an ip address? Wordfence does for example block access to ip address for too many login requests for x hrs or days. Can this be done with this Laravel Firewall Package?
Would be cool if I could add notes to the database entry why this ip was blocked/ whitelisted. or some indication who this IP belongs to
Seems that there is no way for clear the cached ip list.

For example:
Firewall::listCacheClear(); that clear the entire cache
and
Firewall::blacklist($ip, $clearlistcache = false); that refresh cache when save model

What do you'all think?
