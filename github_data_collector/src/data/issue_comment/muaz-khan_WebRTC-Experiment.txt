Hi community,
I am working on a project to stream and save videos, but when I stream for more than 1 hour, I cannot save. I searched online and there were no results. What do I do with this problem?

Hi community ,

Just wondering what is the best option for plans that powers up my web-rtc 
https://www.openode.io/pricing

can someone help me with this .

what is the minimum plan that i need to make the web-rtc working perfectly and why 
I was able to get my multi-stream issue resolved using MultiStreamRecorder - I'm able to capture participant audio in a WebRTC video chat session and combine that audio with an audio/video screen capture, using `captureStream` for the participant audio and `getDisplayMedia` for the screen and finally `getUserMedia` for the screen (mic) audio of the person recording.

However, I'm to the step in the process where I'm ready to destroy the recorder once I'm done, but there doesn't appear to be a method to do this. I'm establishing the recorder like so:

```js
let recorder = new MultiStreamRecorder([screenCaptureStream, participantStream],
  {
    mimeType: "video/webm",
    video: {
      width: 1920,
      height: 1080
    },
    audio: true
  });

 recorder.record();
```

I'm using React, so my `recorder` (and most of the related objects) are stored in `state` for passing between methods, so I can just set the `recorder state` to `null`, which I think would effectively "destroy" it, but `RecordRTC` has a method for destroy.

What am I missing?
How can I store recorded stream video in device.
Hello. I am streaming to a location where people are able to see a shared browser, but are unable to interact with it or click on the overlay that pops up on the right hand corner to close it. I can close mine, but they do not have the capability to close theirs. Is there any way to disable that overlay from popping up so it is not a distraction to the presentation?
