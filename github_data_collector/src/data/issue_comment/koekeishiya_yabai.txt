Is there a setting that controls this? I'd like the border to remain the thickness it original was.
This happens since verison **0.4.1** of Alacritty, rearranging takes like 3 seconds after closing window.

Hi, 

the `--space` option in the .yabai config file seems to ignore spaces on a second monitor and mess with space numbers.

With the following configuration, the 120 padding is applied to the screen named "Desktop 1" in mission control. I tried to change the value after the --space option but the screens on the external monitor seems to be out of reach.

 ```
yabai -m config layout                       bsp
yabai -m config top_padding                  50
yabai -m config bottom_padding               50
yabai -m config left_padding                 50
yabai -m config right_padding                50
yabai -m config window_gap                   20

yabai -m config --space 2 top_padding     120
yabai -m config --space 2 bottom_padding  120
yabai -m config --space 2 left_padding    200
yabai -m config --space 2 right_padding   200
yabai -m config --space 2 window_gap      50
```

```
External Monitor:
[Fullscreen App] - [Fullscreen App] - [Desktop 3]

Macbook screen:
[Fullscreen App] - [Desktop 1] - [Desktop 2]
```

OS: Catalina 10.15.1

⚠️ The System Integrity Protection is not disabled on my computer.

I have the following setting in my `yabairc`:

```
yabai -m rule --add app="Google Chrome" title="MetaMask Notification" manage=off
```

However these windows with that title still get tiled.

My app-specific rules work fine, however, like this one:

```
yabai -m rule --add app="System Preferences" manage=off
```
Hey! first off, I want to thank you for all your work on this! Now that I have to use a Mac, your project has enabled me to at least come a bit closer to my Linux i3 setup.

One thing I'm stuck on is, I want to have 10 spaces, spread evenly among displays. For example, if use <space>:<display> to show expected setup:

1 display:
1:1, 2:1, 3:1 ...

2 displays:
1:1, 2:2, 3:1, 4:2 ...

3 displays:
1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:1 ...

I tried the following in my yabairc:
```
num_displays=$(yabai -m query --displays | jq '. | length')
for i in {1..10}; do
    echo "Moving space $i to display $(( $num_displays - $i % $num_displays ))"
    yabai -m space $i --display $(( $num_displays - $i % $num_displays ))
done
```

The echos seem to suggest it did the right thing:
```
$ yabai
....
Moving space 1 to display 1
acting space is already located on the given display.
Moving space 2 to display 2
Moving space 3 to display 1
acting space is already located on the given display.
Moving space 4 to display 2
Moving space 5 to display 1
Moving space 6 to display 2
acting space is already located on the given display.
Moving space 7 to display 1
Moving space 8 to display 2
acting space is already located on the given display.
Moving space 9 to display 1
Moving space 10 to display 2
acting space is already located on the given display.
yabai configuration loaded..
```

but the spaces don't seem to be correctly organized:
```
$ yabai -m query --spaces | jq '.[] | {index, display}'
{
  "index": 1,
  "display": 1
}
{
  "index": 2,
  "display": 1
}
{
  "index": 3,
  "display": 1
}
{
  "index": 4,
  "display": 1
}
{
  "index": 5,
  "display": 1
}
{
  "index": 6,
  "display": 1
}
{
  "index": 7,
  "display": 2
}
{
  "index": 8,
  "display": 2
}
{
  "index": 9,
  "display": 2
}
{
  "index": 10,
  "display": 2
}
```
Minor bug really.

If i create new windows manually by using Command + N, it would be tiled immediately

However when i drag a tab to another monitor, there is a delay of (3-5 seconds) for the new windows to get tiled.

it's not a very good first user experience. i think we should provide a better default config. or maybe comment out the conflicted ones?

example: 

cmd shift 3 for screenshot
option shift left - right for selecting text
As per title, if you have a fullscreen video window in Safari and switch mission control on and off, when back to the window a border is drawn.

Steps:

1. Open a YouTube video in safari and make it fullscreen
2. Activate mission control
3. Deactivate mission control
4. Border is drawn on fullscreen window
When creating a new space, there is a noticeable delay of up to around 2 seconds before the space appears in the yabai status bar. The actual delay is quite variable.

This issue can be seen by just typing the command:

```
yabai -m space --create
```

If I use the example `skhd` config and focus the window as well, this issue does not persist.
