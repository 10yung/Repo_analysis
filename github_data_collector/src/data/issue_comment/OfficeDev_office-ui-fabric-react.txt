## Issue
Styles are broken in High contrast mode in the new chromium Edge browser, but works in old Edge browser. 

## Root cause
In old Edge, the `-ms-high-contrast` media query implies `-ms-high-contrast-adjust: none;`.
In new/chromium Edge, this is no longer the case and `-ms-high-contrast-adjust: none;` needs to be set explicitly.

## Fix
Setting `-ms-high-contrast-adjust: none` is to ask the browser to not override those styles when high contrast is enabled. We need to make sure we set `-ms-high-contrast-adjust: none;` everywhere we set `-ms-high-contrast` from now on.
#### Describe the feature that you would like added

Add pagination to DetailsList. It's common for list component.

#### What component or utility would this be added to

`DetailsList`

#### Have you discussed this feature with our team, and if so, who

no

#### Additional context/screenshots

<!-- fill this out -->

I am reading the docs, specifically this page: https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/wiki/Component-Styling .. My understanding from this, is that :hover refers to the current component (either parent or child), but the &:hover always references the parent element. Is this correct? If any explanation can be added and clarification it would be great as it's not clear what's the usage of this. 

Thank you.

#### Description of changes

`<EditorWrapper>` exposes a `supportedPackages` prop, but doesn't pass that along to the wrapped `<TsxEditor>`.

This PR forwards the missing prop to `<TsxEditor>` such that additional packages can be used in the editor.
