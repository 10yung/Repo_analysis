I would like to have a save button that would download the markdown file with an "md" extension onto my computer.

Thank you!
## Hi, I'm working on an Electron app, and I'm using Showdown as my renderer because I can customize on it as I like.
## I like SimpleMDE, but the only problem is the renderer, how can I change it? 
I related that there's a bug when applying bold on more than one line. The bug occurs when you break line by pressing enter, and not the text breaking automattically. When you press the toolbar button to bold and then press it again to cancel the effect, the entire line appears selected.
Look at the pics bellow. In the editor on the preview page you can simulate it too.

In the css file, no matter what value I put into

.CodeMirror {
	height: 300px;
}

it never changes. However, changes like

direction: rtl;

work, so it's not a problem with import or something... Anyone knows what might be the problem? Thanks.


Only one Chinese character can be entered at a time on mobile.
Allows installing the package using the PHP package manager "Composer".
As the underlying editor is codemirror, would you provide a means to set the keymap?

Example using sublime mapping https://codemirror.net/demo/sublime.html 

* See how ctrl+d selects multiple items
* see how ctrl+shift+down moves a line down
* and a ton of other useful key shortcuts.
It would be great if it was possible to allow content in the non preview editor to be replaced. 
I want to allow users to add a placeholder like:

`{{image1}}`

And, then I can use the **change** handler to analyse the content and if it finds a placeholder, it will swap it for an uploaded image. The images will be uploaded outside the **simplemde** editor. 

What I need is a method that will allow me to insert all of the content back into the editable [non preview] area of the **simplemde** editor.
