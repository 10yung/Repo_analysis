## Category
Productivity

## Description
I added my open source project `Air Pasteboard` to this repository. It allows quick pasteboard sharing to Github Gist and file sharing through iCloud and Dropbox. Users can easily use the system bar icon to share the pasteboard, or drag and drop to share a file.
 
## Why it should be included to `Awesome macOS open source applications ` (optional)
- Sharing codes and files fast are crucial for developers and I think this app can help developers to do so quickly.
- Also this app will help developers to understand how to create a system bar Mac OS app, how to use the drag and drop feature on system bar apps, how to use Github api, and how to use the Dropbox Swift framework.

and it's not only for emaling, it's also for many chat programms
Is it possible to filter by language ? 

I want to see projects made with Go but I can't do a icon search on the go icon. An idea would be to augment icons with the language extensions. Then I can do ctrl+f and search `.go`
