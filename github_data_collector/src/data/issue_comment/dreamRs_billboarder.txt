Hello DreamRs team,

Thank you for putting together this wonderful package, it is very nice, especially when used in a `Shiny` app. Whilst trying to learn how to use this package effectively, I came across the example provided by your team showing linked tooltips (located [here](https://gist.github.com/pvictor/49fdb05d362acca8d6b94d69345a5046)) 

Unfortunately, this does not appear to work, either inside of a shiny app or when just using the defined `make_line()` function. When using the code as it is now, all of the graphs produced do not have visible tooltips (either in Rstudio 1.2.5.001 viewer or Firefox 71.0, each with R 3.6.1, MS Windows 10).

When editing the code to put a scatterplot on top of the linechart, the vertical line appears when hovering over a point, but *not* the tooltip:

```R
# on CRAN now (version 0.2.3)
library(billboarder)

# data
data("economics", package = "ggplot2")

# helper fun
make_line <- function(var, title, percent = TRUE) {
  billboarder() %>%
    bb_linechart(data = economics[, c("date", var)]) %>%
    bb_scatterplot(data = economics[, c("date", var)]) %>%
    bb_x_axis(tick = list(format = "%Y-%m", fit = FALSE)) %>%
    bb_y_axis(tick = list(format = if (percent) suffix("%"))) %>%
    bb_legend(show = TRUE) %>%
    bb_x_grid(show = TRUE) %>%
    bb_y_grid(show = TRUE) %>%
    bb_labs(title = title) %>%
    bb_tooltip(linked = list(name = "my-tooltip")) # <--- Id for linking tooltip
}
make_line("psavert", "Personal savings rate", TRUE)
make_line("uempmed", "Number of unemployed", TRUE)
make_line("pce", "Personal consumption expenditures", FALSE)
make_line("pop", "Total population", FALSE)
```

I also noticed that when doing a simple un-linked `bb_linechart()` with some example data, the tooltip does not appear either, and I have to put a `bb_scatterplot()` subsequent to the `bb_linechart` to make it appear.

I hope this is not too much of a nightmare to resolve, as those tooltips are extremely useful within a `Shiny` app.

Thanks again for making this package, it is very nice and I eagerly look forward to future updates!

How can someone download a chart as a png/jpeg?
I tried using negative values in a billboarder::bauge in shiny and somehow it seems like negative values are not displayed - am I doing something wrong or is this a known issue? 

Further, when using positive values while having a negative "min" value, only the positive area is rendered, meaning when min = -100 and max = 100 a value of 25 shows only a colored area that equals 25% which is not correct. Again, I might be doing something wrong. If not, is there a fix for this issue?

Update: As far I understand it, this problem seems to be rooted in the billboard.js library itself. So maybe not an issue for this package.

See Code below:

```
library(shiny)
library(billboarder)

shinyApp(
    
    ui = fluidPage(

        baugeOutput(outputId = "gauge")
        
    ),
    
    server = function(input, output) {
        
        output$gauge <- renderBauge({
            
                            bauge(
                                value = -25, # alternatively use 25 instead of -25
                                min = -100,
                                max = 100,
                                colors = c("#FF0000"),
                                label_format = suffix("")
            )
            
        })
        
    }
    
)

```

billboarder() %>%
      bb_barchart(
        data = explanation_plot_df,
        mapping = bbaes(x = feature_desc, y = feature_weight, group = churn_predictor),
        rotated = TRUE,
        stacked = TRUE
      ) %>%
      bb_colors_manual('Less likely to churn' = 'rgba(63, 182, 24, 0.7)', 'More likely to churn' = 'rgba(255, 0, 57, 0.7)')
  })

Hi,

Is possible to add tick labels with the limits to the gauge charts? Something similar to the one discussed in this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24900903/how-to-draw-gauge-chart-in-r) thread?

Thanks,

I'd like to customize the tooltip shown when a user hovers over a scatterplot point.  To do this, I need to pull data out of the `data` object passed to `format.contents`. However, not all of the fields from my `data.frame` are getting into `data`.  How can I add fields to `data`, or otherwise get the other columns from the `data.frame` into the right place?

Here is an example that should illustrate what I mean:

```
data.frame(
  x = rnorm(200), 
  y = rnorm(200), 
  group = sample(letters[1:3], size=200, replace=T), 
  label = sample(letters[4:26], size=200, replace=T) 
) %>%
  billboarder(data=.) %>%
  bb_aes(x = x, y = y, group=group, label=label) %>%
  bb_scatterplot() %>%
  bb_tooltip(grouped=FALSE, 
             contents = htmlwidgets::JS(
               "function(data, titleFormat, valueFormat, color) {console.log(data);return `<table><tr><td>${data[0].label}</td></tr><tr><td>${data[0].x}</td></tr><tr><td>${data[0].value}</td></tr></table>`;}"
             ))
```

As of now, the labels are all `undefined`, because `data`  has `group` for both the `id` and `name` fields.  
How would you implement a second Y axis (for values in 3rd column having totally other scale than in 2nd).
Is it natively in R formulas or do we need to pass by API ?

Thx
