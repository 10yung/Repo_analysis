Hi, thanks for creating this awesome repository.

I am a newbie at writing shader string, so can you please suggest me a way to target the low-frequency areas in the image just like you are creating the high pass filter in the following way, to target the high frequencies areas of the image

highpass.rgb = image.rgb - gaussianBlurredImage.rgb + vec3(0.5,0.5,0.5)

Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanks
Hi, thanks for this great library!

I've noticed that there's a parameter called `inputControlPoints` in the README, but it's actually called `inputToneCurveControlPoints` in the [code](https://github.com/YuAo/YUCIHighPassSkinSmoothing/blob/4bb0aabf57fb34d2d24274213c70d3193d8aa1c5/Sources/YUCIHighPassSkinSmoothing.h), so trying to set `inputControlPoints` param leads to exception.

Also where I can read what exactly is "curve from the Curve Adjustment step" and what its values are responsible for? Thanks!
