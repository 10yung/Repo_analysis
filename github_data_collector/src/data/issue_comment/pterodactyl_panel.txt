^^ In this scenario, I edited the image.
But it shows something like that.

Panel version **0.8.0-alpha1**

**Expected behavior: It should say "Mass Actions"**
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
It's fairly hard to easily link servers together. For example with Garry's Mod you can mount other source games such as css, hl, Portal, etc. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Maybe an option in the panel that easily let's you get file paths of other servers, allowing people to easily link the games together

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I've thought about just installing C:SS (that's what I'm trying to mount) on my local machine and moving it in with a FTP but I would have to do that for every server, which would take up a lot of space
I am Reporting an issue about the panel.

i discovered that the maximum used filesize not is showing when the server is down.
it would be really helpfull not only for me for managing but also for my clients to plan their modpacks or other things if it would be shown even if the server went offline
# I am reporting an Issue with the Daemon!

A Client of Mine came to me because he could not updload files..
This happened because he had reached the storage limit of his instance.
He claims pretty sure to not have gotten any error message that would explain him storage limit reached..

If it is Possible i would recommend to add this 

The login error message displays as the width of the page, when it should be the width of the login box

When creating a location or anything else and you forgot to fill out a field it shows on the error message:

 0.8.0-alpha.1

Hello,

When I create servers with the api my users can't login to their sftp's (via filezila/winscp etc, not browser file manager). They use their data shown in the panel (host, port, username) and assume that the password is the same as panel password. I also tested this, those details don't seem to work. The only sftp details that work are for servers created directly from the panel (the admin user), those details work (I've created a test server to test it). Basicaly when you create servers with the api, the username shown in the sftp details is name-of-admin-user.server-id instead of name-of-the-user.server-id.
Example: 
admin user: admin
User: user
Server id: 78snshfjs

Normal (right) SFTP username: user.78snshfjs
Displayed (wrong) SFTP username (in the panel): admin.78snshfjs
Adding private reppos into the panel and not each nodes config
**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
Having a list that would let you add each private docker repository straight into the panel instead of needing to edit core.json
**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.
Adding the reppo to core.json (the option is either broken or i don't know how to set it up since having a private reppo makes getting public docker images error ` Error: (HTTP code 500) server error - Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/library/mariadb/manifests/10.3: unauthorized: incorrect username or password`
Since the protocol for IPv4 addresses has now reached its limits and the last IPv4 addresses have been distributed, I wanted to ask whether it would be possible to program a future-proof version of Pterodactyl. I am aware that this will be a lot of work, but support for IPv6 should be encouraged, especially in the areas of hosting.

I would be very happy if the support for IPv6 is also added in Pterodactyl!
