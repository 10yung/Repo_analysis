I have some problems to use Hamcrest in combination with PHPUnit. I loaded phpuNit 7.0 and hamcrest-php (dev-master) with composer. The environment is PHP 7.2.  
And then I build this first test:

```
<?php

namespace App\HamcrestTest;

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class MyTest extends TestCase
{
    public function setUp()
    {
        \Hamcrest\Util::registerGlobalFunctions();
    }

    public function testHamcrestWorks()
    {
        assertThat('a', is(equalTo('a')));
    }
}
```

Executing the test I will get this error message:

```
There was 1 risky test:
1) App\HamcrestTest\MyTest::testHamcrestWorks
This test did not perform any assertions
```

A simple fix, but could be confusing for people just coming to the package (like me!)
# Changed log
- Resolves issue #37.
- Add the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.
Please add a `.gitattrubutes` file to exclude the `/tests` directory as well as any other files that are unnecessary in production (e.g.: `TODO.txt`, `CHANGES.txt`)

Thanks :smiley:  
The CONTRIBUTING.md file needs to be added to answer common questions, that contributors might have, e.g.:
- which branch all PR's should be targeted to
- what coding standards project adheres
- etc.

This is the file I've created by looking at most popular repositories: https://github.com/qa-tools/qa-tools/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

When running the test with HHVM, a unexpected behaviour appears in https://github.com/hamcrest/hamcrest-php/blob/master/hamcrest/Hamcrest/Arrays/SeriesMatchingOnce.php#L34
in this line:

``` php
$nextMatcher = current($this->_elementMatchers);
```

Failing travis build:
https://travis-ci.org/hamcrest/hamcrest-php/jobs/65859156

The problem was encountered in this Pull-Request: #27 

Even though the array still contains 3 matchers, the function `current` return false because the internal array point is at the end of the file.

Todo:
- [ ] Reproduce with PHP 5.3-5.6 using a PHPUnit test.
- [ ] Locate where the array pointer is changed to wrong value.
- [ ] Fix the cause.
