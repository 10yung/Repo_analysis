I run the original code in your github but the MR is worse than the result on your paper,  RPN only(11.4%) ， BCN(8.6%).  How can I get the same result in your paper? @garrickbrazil 
Is the cropped proposals as the inputs of BCN right? In "SDS-RCNN/experiments/test_rcnn.m", I am confused the operation at 67th line and 68th line. The code is shown as below, I think “w(h)” should be added twice of "w(h)*rcnn_conf.padfactor". Can someone tell me which operation is true?


65    `x1 = x1 - w*rcnn_conf.padfactor + impadW;`
66    `y1 = y1 - h*rcnn_conf.padfactor + impadH;`
67    `w = w + w*rcnn_conf.padfactor;`
68    `h = h + h*rcnn_conf.padfactor;`
I finished the Setup by following your instruction. When I tried to train the model, I encountered the problem as below.
Preloaded imdb train.. done
Computing roidb train.. Reference to non-existent field 'sizes'.

Error in roidb_generate (line 49)
  height = imdb.sizes(1,1);

Error in train_rpn (line 54)
    roidb_train   = roidb_generate(imdb_train, false, rpn_conf.cache_dir, rpn_conf.dataset_train,
    rpn_conf.min_gt_height);

Error in train_all (line 15)
    out_jargin = train_rpn(rpn_config, gpu_id);
Could you give me some suggestions to solve the problem?
Hi,

We are trying to implement your code. We use the Caffe compiled from github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/windows branch. However Matlab freezes in training section (in train_all(rpn_config, rcnn_config, gpu_id); function).  

In readme file of the project, it is written that "modified version of Caffe v1.0" was used. In windows, we cannot build your modified Caffe that provided in project files.  Could you write the modified part (or files) of Caffe so that we can change the files in BVLC/caffe/tree/windows and compile them?

Best regards.
Hello,

I would like to change the RPN and BCN feature encore from vgg to resnet.
I would like to know how you train the pretrained/vgg16 caffe model

Would you give me any advice?
Thanks in advance,

Ukhu

Hello,

I was wondering if the modifications you added for caffe are impacting these tests.

Because I got these failed tests..

Thanks in advance




Hi, thank you for sharing your code. It is a great job.
I want to know which type of solver is used to achieve the good performance in your paper, SGD or ADAM? I use SGD but cannot produce as the same good results as you did.
The final MR rate is 0.0804 on Caltech dataset.
Hello @garrickbrazil I using a new dataset to train, and do not change any parameters.  Train rpn part is completed. The validation result shown in the following image, the MR of val is 0.0863. but the MR of final test is 0.51.
Do you know what is the problem？ 
Hope your prompt reply, thank you very much.
