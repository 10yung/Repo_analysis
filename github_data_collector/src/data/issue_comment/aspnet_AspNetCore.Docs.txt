In a situation where you have a PackageId configured in your RCL csproj file, the PackageId is the {LIBRARY NAME} and not the AssemblyName.

Add "what's new" pages that mirror those for .NET at https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/whats-new/. Note that these pages are generated by some code Bill and I wrote.

[Internal review page](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/whats-new/?view=aspnetcore-1.0&branch=pr-en-us-16595)
according to this: https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/issues/5447
DataProtection since version 3 is not compatible with Azure Functions anymore (v2 is fine), I think the documentation should mention it...

If it is how it should be deployed from Azure Release Pipelines? It seems that it is not. Once deployed using Azure App Service deploy task it just doesn't start. More info also in my question here - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59770756/workerservice-deployed-to-azure-app-service-is-not-starting

The doc asserts that the call to "app.UseCors()" is unesscary when trying to enable CORS for only specifi endpoints and not have it apply globally.
This issue was raised here [Link](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/17830).
Please update the docs to avoid confusion.

When #16335 merges, apply the following to any doc with lots  of useful code comments:


`[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/MTcomments.md)]`

Documentation is badly incomplete surrounding the saving of the value of the drop-down in that so it can remember.

When you create the _SelectLanguagePartial.cshtml and place it in your layout file it changes the language and the cookie is created.

However, once you navigate off the page it does not remember the cookie value in the dropdown and reverts back to default Language and not the chosen culture also most language selectors would display the countries flag and feel that the documentation should be set up to show how to do that as well.

_SelectLanguagePartial.cshtml

Please see video of the problem

Can we make an article about using EF with serverside Blazor in the same way we have one for Razor pages?

I wrote a comment and a sample on the pattern to follow here.

The main points are:
* Showcase how to do CRUD
* Use OwningComponentBase to isolate the usage of the context to the component it is being used in.
* Explain that if you use the context directly, the context is shared among components, which might cause multiple queries to start at the same time, and that is something that Entity Framework doesn't support.

https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/16745#issuecomment-549505605
I know this was discussed already, but I can't see clear picture with browser versions support, which makes using (or starting using) Blazor kinda risky.

How would we know that Blazor server would work for example if some people use like kinda outdated version of Firefix/Chrome due to them sitting in Windows 7 and not knowing how to update their browser? (happened several time (not with Blazor but overall in some projects), some people don't event understand that they should update their browser, and sometimes their corporate laptops are just the way they are)

I mean it would be very helpful info like "Blazor Server: Firefox 67+ (previous need polyfills, add them when needed)"

Maybe even basic info about blazor server, like "core blazor is transpiled/not transpiled so your browsers should have at least es6 support" or something like this.

Reference to pull request with discussion.

The includes were needed when we had 3 versions of each tutorial. VS, VSC, VSmac. Now that we have tabs, they’re not necessary.
