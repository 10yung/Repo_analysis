Hello, i have been using this lib for a while, and did not have any issue till now. I opened an app on iOS 12 and wherever i have one page in SMPageControl that page indicator (dot) is not visible, also it looks like even if i have more than one it is visible but less, like view is smaller. 

I did some research and found this "hidesForSinglePage" property, but it is always false.

Anyone with same issue?
Is there a way to "center" the current item? (within the self.view)

like let's say I have a PageController with 5 Views.
I want 

|         |       =      the window
i                 =      the current item
.                 =      items

is something like that possible? and how?
and please, if possible in swift code.
I've use pod to be able to use this framwork within my swift project.

I currently try to implement the SMPageControler into my Swift 2.3 Project.
Xcode 8 Final Version.

pageControl.tapBehavior = SMPageControlTapBehavior.Jump

When I touch the Controler, the image gets selected, but the Screen does not jump to the new ViewController.
Any ideas?

Upon including the following:

```
github "Spaceman-Labs/SMPageControl"
```

 in my Cartfile, I get the following:

```
*** Skipped building SMPageControl due to the error:
Dependency "SMPageControl" has no shared framework schemes for any of the platforms: iOS

If you believe this to be an error, please file an issue with the maintainers at https://github.com/Spaceman-Labs/SMPageControl/issues/new
```

Am I missing something?

Hi,

I been using your control for one of my project. Since I started using sdk 8 its been crashing my app.. The issue is in SMPageControl - - (void)_renderPages:(CGContextRef)context rect:(CGRect)rect

The error is thrown when we try to navigate the images. 

The code that is throwing the error

yOffset = [self _topOffsetForHeight:image.size.height rect:rect];
CGFloat centeredXOffset = xOffset + floorf((_measuredIndicatorWidth - image.size.width) / 2.0f);
[image drawAtPoint:CGPointMake(centeredXOffset, yOffset)];
indicatorRect = CGRectMake(centeredXOffset, yOffset, image.size.width, image.size.height); 

Not sure how to fix it. I ended up using the code in the else statement. Seems to be working for me for now

Thanks in advance

- The cast fix gets rid of compiler warnings in the example.
- -intrinsicContentSize fix replaces UIViewNoIntrinsicMetric constant with an actual width.

Is there a way to have the name of the page be the indicator? 

Added options to define stroke color (thanks @orsharir) as well as stroke width. Allows the creation of simple hollowed out dots:

``` obj-c
pageControl.indicatorDiameter = 5.0f;
pageControl.pageIndicatorTintColor = [UIColor clearColor];
pageControl.pageIndicatorTintStrokeColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
pageControl.pageIndicatorTintStrokeWidth = 0.5f;
pageControl.currentPageIndicatorTintColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
```

I use this code:

self.pageControl = [[SMPageControl alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(110, 496, 100, 10)];
self.pageControl.numberOfPages = 6;
self.pageControl.currentPage = 0;
// green point
[self.pageControl setPageIndicatorImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"page-dot.png"]];
//white large point
[self.pageControl setCurrentPageIndicatorImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"page-dot-current.png"]];

[self.pageControl setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"page-signup-dot.png"] forPage:5];
[self.pageControl setCurrentImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"page-signup-dot-current.png"] forPage:5];

After run and scrolling, the first dot became a whitish border.
