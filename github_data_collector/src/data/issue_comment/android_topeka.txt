- [ ] Replace `com.android.feature` with `com.android.dynamic-feature`
- [ ] Enable instant and onDemand delivery
Hello,
thanks for this great sample.  I'd like to ask if we can have Jetpack Navigation library integrated here, so that we can see how to transition between Fragments in a modern way that Google advocates in 2018?

Thank you,
Igor
**COMPONENT**

**Topeka** is a fun to play quiz that showcase material design on Android. the app is built to showcase branding and material design principle with beautiful graphics and at the same time allow users to have fun. it has 9 categories where questions can be answered to earn points. Before Topeka can be accessed, user needs to log in and choose an avatar, though it doesn't need internet connection. The **CATEGORIES** in Topeka is the main part of the app and my focus will be on it.

**PROPOSAL**

1. **Shuffle and re arrange questions**
2. **Automatic display of point on each category**


**Shuffle and re arrange questions** The questions in **topeka** is always repeated after the user sign out and log in again. The same set of questions is answered over and over again regardless of how frequently the application is logged out and signed in. Changing the mode of displaying the questions and shuffling them will be a better way of making the quiz more fun. Changing and mixing as theory, objectives and true or false options on same question will allow repetition to be more technical and it won’t look like same question to users. For example. Let’s see one of the questions in the FOOD and DRINK Category.

---
* Name the Italian, semi-soft, rich Cheese with blue vein through it
**(A)Ricotta                    (B)Blue Cheese
( C)Gorgonzola                  (D) Parmesan**

---
This question can be twisted in several ways     
* The Italian, semi-soft, rich Cheese with blue vein through it is ------------------------------
* Is blue Cheese an Italian, Semi-soft, rich cheese with blue Vein?
 **True           or         False**
* Tick any of the following Italian, semi-soft, rich cheese that has blue vein
**Gorgonzola
Blue cheese
Parmesan
Ricotta
Provolone
Asiago**

---
This tactics will be very good in tackling the repetition of questions always.

**Automatic display of point on each category**: Each Category in TOPEKA has 10 questions. The scores merited by user after each quiz is not available for view, just the general scores of all the  answered questions from all categories is displayed at the top right side of the app which makes it difficult to know the point scored on each category. The automatic display of points /score on each category will show the points merited after each quiz is attended and the number of questions rightly answered will also be displayed.

This mock up shows how the scores and marks will be displayed

**Benefits**

These suggested features will boost the app a lot 
The same set of questions will not be repeated. Anytime the quiz is completed and the user logs out and sign in again, the questions will be displayed in another way different from the just concluded one and users will be able to answer without going through same familiar ones over and over again.

It will make users want to visit the app again and again because vivid repitition will be tackled and they can always answer different set of questions anytime they feel like doing some quiz.

The point scored on each category will be displayed and user will be able to know his scores on the quiz he attended.

The exact point for each question on each category will be known by users 



Having all these suggestions implemented will be of added advantage and it will give users a more pleasing experience.

Thanks.
I see sunflower and plaid are using now ktlint, should this project as well?
The build doesn't go through when I try to build the app with newest gradle 3.3.0-alpha3.

Problems:

- Feature modules cannot use minifyEnabled in new gradle(3.2, 3.3).
- Default proguard file can only be used in base module.

I have opened #118 to let project keep the pace of new gradle, kotlin and some dependencies.
Pls check the Changes:
- Feature modules cannot use minifyEnabled in new gradle(3.2, 3.3).
- Default proguard file can only be used in base module.

On some conditions, all the visible category cards disappeared after coming back from `QuizActivity`. Like the screenshot below:

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3777021/18982472/0e894950-8719-11e6-86b7-87702c242b71.png" width="30%" />

But you can still scroll up those left cards which are outside the screen previously.

Though not guaranteed, you may reproduce this bug as following:  
1. Click one category card to go to `QuizActivity`;
2. Press back to go back to `CategorySelectionActivity`;
3. Repeat 1 & 2 until the bug occurs.

Or, you can do the following steps to make it easier to happen:
1. Go to **Developer options** in **Settings**;
2. Change Animator duration scale to 5x or 10x;
3. Back to Topeka;
4. Click one category card to go to `QuizActivity`;
5. Press back, and don't stop, press back a few more times duration the window transition;
6. Repeat 4 & 5 until the bug occurs.

What's strange is that it can be reproduced 100% consecutively sometimes even I kill the App from the overview screen.
