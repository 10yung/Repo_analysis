hello


is there a way to exploit JSON based logs with ?? 

thx
src/ncsa.cpp 161

never used variable 'code'
Is it possible to run this headless and just stream to youtube or file?

```$ logstalgia -1280x720 -o - /var/log/nginx/access.log
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'SDLInitException'
  what():  No available video device
[1]    19736 abort (core dumped)  logstalgia -1280x720 -o - /var/log/nginx/access.log
```
Now the logstalgia can support various log format, but still many users may have various formsts. 

Why not support the customization? 

Request to add log format customization like https://github.com/allinurl/goaccess does. 
Added a -n flag to gzip to make Logstalgia reproducible. 
Hi,

Could you please help with parsing the following format?

Hi i'm wondering how i create a custom log format for Java's Jersey "Web Server"
An example of log entry is:
<pre>
[2016-11-02 03:36:47,434]   INFO - erver.RequestLog.bundleProcess - 172.16.28.6 - - [02/Nov/2016:05:36:47 +0000] "GET /hub/api/rest/oauth2/target HTTP/1.1" 200 9 "-" "Jersey/2.22.2 (Apache HttpClient 4.5)" 0 
</pre>

How i adapt Logstalgia for that?
Make proper sorting of ip addresses on the left side of the screen. Not to mixed up the address, starting for example at 13.xx.xx.xx and 130.xx.xx.xx. The sequence of addresses should be from 1 to 255 at each category of the address.

For streaming video need hide window, example:

```
$ logstalgia --quiet --output-ppm-stream - access_log \
| ffmpeg -y -r 60 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm -i - -vcodec libvpx -b 10000K logstalgia.webm
```

To stream into webpage as web administration but no need the graphical window in the server. you may not use the OS user interface? example, in CentOS with ffserver stream, in this way the user does not have to be installed logstalgia to observe traffic.

Looks like timestamps are converted to longs. At high request rates (100+ QPS), this causes batches of balls to get sent every second instead of as a stream. This not only ruins the effect, but also causes lag as hundreds of balls are rendered in batches.
