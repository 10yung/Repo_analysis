Hi, I have a problem when i try to run this project in a iOS11 device.

For detail check the gif:

I happen only in iOS11, on both iphone and ipad.
_FormField_ refers to _FormSection_, which refers to _FormGroup_ (strong reference).
On the other hand, _FormGroup_ contains Sections, which contains Fields.
Such an arrangement can be a source of memory leaks.
Hi everybody,

While profiling my project in Instruments, I've noticed that my view controller using `Form` was generating a memory leak. I've tried to find the culprit but I didn't succeeded.

I've found that the demo project (`Basic-ObjC` in my case) is also concerned. As I'm not really good at debugging memory leaks and retain cycles, I asking for your help/ideas.

What I've found using Instruments and tools [MLeaksFinder](https://github.com/Tencent/MLeaksFinder) & [FBRetainCycleDetector](https://github.com/facebook/FBRetainCycleDetector) : 
- When dismissing a popover, a memory leak is detected (it seems to come from `FORMFieldValuesTableViewController` but I'm not really sure about this)
- When dismissing the view controller containing the form, a leak is detected on `UICollectionView`

If anyone has a clue, I would be really grateful ! ðŸ˜Š
Including these two lines in my pod file

```
use_frameworks!
pod 'Form'
```

I'm getting a Swift version error when I try to build. At that point, I `Edit > Convert` to current Swift Syntax. 

Unfortunately, I then get an error that says the file I import in the line
`#import "UIColor+Hex.h" `
does not exist. I go through and remove all code that references that file. Then at that point I try to build but am getting a `Apple Mach-O Linker Error`. 

Any suggestion on how I can resolve these issues? The project looks amazing so I'd like to be able to give it a try.
Hi,

# The Issue
I am trying to automate the process of filling form field data based on data present in other fields. Basically, implement a rules engine of sorts into forms. For example, if a checkbox gets checked, it'll hide a specific field further down the line, and vice versa if it's unchecked.

The logic behind this is already fleshed out, and functional, but only when the form isn't too big so that there are non-visible fields. I.e., if there's fields at the bottom of the form that one has yet to scroll through, and I attempt to update any field (visible or otherwise) through the use of FORMTargets, a NSInternalInconsistency exception is thrown. That the number of items before the update must be equal to after the update plus or minus the modifications.

# The Code

[data.json.txt](https://github.com/hyperoslo/Form/files/1239056/data.json.txt)

Attached you will find a very simple json to demo this on, as of this writing (August 21st, 2017), I am on the latest version of the engine, and am using the demo HYPSampleCollectionViewController from the Basic-ObjC scheme, I am just swapping out the filename.
 
`- (void)checkRules
{
	FORMField *field = [self.dataSource fieldWithID:@"check" includingHiddenFields:YES];
	NSMutableArray *targets = [NSMutableArray array];`
	
	if ([field.value boolValue])
	{
		[targets addObject:[FORMTarget hideFieldTargetWithID:@"adult_dates"]];
		[targets addObject:[FORMTarget showFieldTargetWithID:@"juvenile"]];
	}
	else
	{
		[targets addObject:[FORMTarget hideFieldTargetWithID:@"juvenile"]];
		[targets addObject:[FORMTarget showFieldTargetWithID:@"adult_dates"]];
	}
	
	field = [self.dataSource fieldWithID:@"choice" includingHiddenFields:YES];
	FORMFieldValue *value = field.value;
	
	if ([value.value isEqualToNumber:@0])
	{
		FORMTarget *target1 = [FORMTarget updateFieldTargetWithID:@"male"];
		target1.targetValue = @YES;
		
		FORMTarget *target2 = [FORMTarget updateFieldTargetWithID:@"female"];
		target2.targetValue = @NO;
		
		[targets addObject:target1];
		[targets addObject:target2];
	}
	else if ([value.value isEqualToNumber:@1])
	{
		FORMTarget *target1 = [FORMTarget updateFieldTargetWithID:@"female"];
		target1.targetValue = @YES;
		
		FORMTarget *target2 = [FORMTarget updateFieldTargetWithID:@"male"];
		target2.targetValue = @NO;
		
		[targets addObject:target1];
		[targets addObject:target2];
	}
	
	[self.dataSource processTargets:targets];
`}`

Above is the code I use to check the current field values and generate targets accordingly. This is called in every field's `fieldUpdatedBlock`.

So yeah, as mentioned, the code does work, it's just that when there's fields out of view that the number of items somehow gets corrupted after/while processing the targets. If I modify my json to only have one group, so that it can all fit on the screen without having to scroll, then there are no issues.

For example, here is the exception logged when attempting to toggle the "Is Juvenile?" switch:
`*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Invalid update: invalid number of items in section 0.  The number of items contained in an existing section after the update (4) must be equal to the number of items contained in that section before the update (4), plus or minus the number of items inserted or deleted from that section (0 inserted, 1 deleted) and plus or minus the number of items moved into or out of that section (0 moved in, 0 moved out).'

Thank you in advance for any insight you could provide.
I just encountered a problem for elements having same id won't work. So far I was using id name same as title which user decides. But giving same title in both elements, former element interaction is not possible in this library. This information will not be entered by users. We developers have to choose unique id for all elements. So can I use numbers starts from 1 as id for all elements like 1 for first element and 2 for second element and so on.
Please advise me on this as soon as possible. Thank you

This library is helpful for reading JSON and building form UI. I want to allow users to create form templates which creates JSON, then the JSON is used using this library. So is it possible using this library? Is there any library for this to create form templates?
I'm trying to trace the logic of how your group headers keep track of their collapsed state. The scenario would be like so:

1) Collapse a group
2) Scroll down so the group disappears from screen 
3) Scroll back up so it gets re-instantiated for view

I'm failing to figure out where you guys figure out if it should be collapsed or not. I only see the part where you assign if it is collapsible.

Thanks
Hello,

I am trying the FORM to render dynamic User interface. I like my button actions to be dynamic too. Like when user clicks a button open an URL from a Textfield in the same screen. Or copy some data from a field and paste in another textfield in same screen. So looking for dynamic button actions. Is this something can be doable ? Appreciate any suggestions here

Thanks
