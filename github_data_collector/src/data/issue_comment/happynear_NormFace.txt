你好happynear，如果有时间的话能否解释一下PCA在训练和测试中怎么用？
对梯度的求解不理解，还有在附录部分关于推导的中间过程感觉是不是写错了，貌似结果是对的，求大神解释，谢谢！
Hi Happynear, your caffe's cool ! my Q is: why you put 100 pics into input data layer in norm face? Something to do with 'mirror face trick'? Noticed that shape of data is (100, 1, 128, 128)... Sorry for the naive question.

Can I know why "From the geometric perspective, ...normal vector x"?

Also, I can't quite understand your figure 4 too. Why $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \bar{x}}$ points in the south east direction?

Do you mind explaining?
@happynear hi, how can i combine the normface with sphereface, could you give me some help?
