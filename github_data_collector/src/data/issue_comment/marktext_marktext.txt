### Describe your feature request

Provide an option to copy rich text, in a way that is similar to the existing Copy As HTML and Copy As Markdown options.

### What problem does this feature solve?

It would be useful when you want to paste part or all of the document into program that supports rich text, but doesn't automatically convert HTML or Markdown.

I tried to use this example from Vega-Lite docs:

https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/circle_wilkinson_dotplot.html

But it does not work. Is marktext supporting an older version of vega-lite? If yes, then which one?

I am running Windows 10 Home x64. Vega-lite support (and other graphs) is really a killer feature! Great Job!
[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) seems to have had a lot of new graphs since its support was implemented in marktext (eg, Gantt diagrams, Pie charts, etc). Would be great if marktext would be updated to support those kinds of graphs!
### Describe your feature request

Provide an option to fold/collapse text within the actual body of the document. This could be a button to the left of each heading. (Currently, folding is an option within the sidebar, but changes here does not affect the appearance of the body.) 

### What problem does this feature solve?

This would help the reader/writer to more easily see the document's outline. It could also be useful during the writing process to help the writer focus on the section that they are working on. 
### Question description

How can i open file or directory from command ?

just like :
```
textmark . // open whole directory

textmark a.md // open a file
```

### Description

Linefeeds are injected when turning off Source Code Mode.
This is not really important in most cases, but I'm trying to use the pandoc yalm metadata, and switching to the wysiwyg mode always breaks the formatting of the yalm. (I tried using backticks etc, it works great in the mark text, but the metadata is then just ignored in pandoc, it seems the yaml header needs to be in the content)

(any workaround would also be fine)

- [ x ] Can you reproduce the issue? 

### Steps to reproduce

enter this in source code mode:

    <---
   
    ---
    title:  'Hello World!'
    ...
    -->

make sure cursor is not on the line: ---
then turn Source Code Mode Off
then turn Source Code Mode On

**Expected behavior:**

Document remains unchanged

**Actual behavior:**

    <---
   
    ---
    
    title:  'Hello World!'
    ...
    -->
