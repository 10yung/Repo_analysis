Author jpillora haven't been maintaining this project for more than a year, and no reponses to issues and PRs, so I began to maintain a fork of cloud-torrent, rebranded as SimpleTorrent.

https://github.com/boypt/simple-torrent

Currently  added features:
* Run extrenal program on completed
* Stops task when seeding ratio reached
* Download/Upload speed limiter
* Detailed transfer stats in web UI
* Torrent Watcher

And compile with new anacrolix/torrent engine API, with Go 1.12.7

Welcome to try out my fork,  PRs, Ideas also welcomed.
Hi there,
The current documentation is a lacking in depth unless i'm missing something. Therefore i'm not able to figure out if this is currently implemented or not.
I need to download many different torrent files at the same time but would like to be able to set the directory of each torrent to their own folder (not just by the torrent name).
I have a few torrents that are all part of the same connected thing and for ease of organisation when downloading many torrents at once I need the ability to add a directory to each one not just universally. Is this in the plans already? Looks like a really nice piece of software and I would love to use it but I can't without this feature.
It's showing heroku is not supported anymore, i'm not a coder or anything like that, so could you pls help me out
