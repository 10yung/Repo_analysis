🌴 **Visual Studio Code Version :** [ 1.41.1 ] 
🌴 **Code Settings Sync Version :** [ 3.4.3 ] 
🌴 **Standard or Insiders :** [ Mac ] 
🐛 **Describe the bug**  
the issue happens usually when the editor is reloaded while the ext is sync uploading/downloading.

- the ext adds an extra `,` to the first array/object it encounter in the settings file ex.

```jsonc
    // @sync-ignore
    "workbench.settings.useSplitJSON": false,
    // @sync-ignore
    "material-icon-theme.folders.color": "#ffffff",
    // @sync-ignore
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {, // <<< this is added by sync
        "activityBar.border": "#00000000",
        // ...
    }
```

📰 **To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. add `@sync-ignore` to an object or array in settings file
2. do a sync upload/download and reload the editor or open a new workspace
3. settings file gets the extra comma and shows an error

💪 **Expected behavior**

the `,` shouldn't be added or if the ext is doing something in the background, maybe a notification b4 editor is reloaded would be helpful.

📺 **Console Error Log** 
If applicable, add screenshots or paste the console log from developer console of VSCode (Help Menu > Developer Tool - Console Tab). 

```
Sync: Result content is not a valid JSON. Unexpected token , in JSON at position 128 {
    "workbench.settings.useSplitJSON": false,

    "material-icon-theme.folders.color": "#ffffff",

    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {,

🐛 **Describe the bug**  
I have a problem with install Code Settings Sync, when i try upload setting,I get a error for JSON parse. 
When change in my gist  for object or empty ''. I can save Setting.

I think this could a solution: 
`files: {
      "settings.json": {
        content: "{}"
      },
      "launch.json": {
        content: "{}"
      },
      "keybindings.json": {
        content: "{}"
      },
      "extensions.json": {
        content: "{}"
      },
      "locale.json": {
        content: "{}"
      },
      "keybindingsMac.json": {
        content: "{}"
      },
      cloudSettings: {
        content: "{}"
      }
    }`

I would like to use the same C# formatting settings on all of my computers so that my code will stay consistent. It would be great if code-settings-sync would save my omnisharp.json located in %USERPROFILE%/.omnisharp/

🐛 **Describe the bug**  
Simple, there's no scroll bar on the settings page. Using a scroll wheel or click + drag doesn't make the page scroll down either. So depending on your screen size, Any options below "Hostname (Optional)" are unreachable.4
