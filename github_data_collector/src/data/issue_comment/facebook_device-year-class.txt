We are actively using this library(and thanks!) and would love to see profiles after 2016. Will there be an update in the near future?

`memInfo` is created two lines above, the code should check for memInfo.totalMem (defaults to 0)

The content of the license file matches with 3-BSD.

I recently spoke to someone at DroidconSF about whether this library was stale or not and they indicated it wasn't. They had mentioned that it had been updated internally for newer device year classes and that they should be released publicly and requested I open an issue as there might be a problem with the release process. It'd be great if this library could get a public update with profiles for 2016/2017. Thanks.
2.0.0 was published in Dec 2016: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.facebook.device.yearclass/yearclass

but that release was not tagged:
https://github.com/facebook/device-year-class/releases

Looks like the 2.0.0 version bump landed in Master last October (27f3fee5025b541572a102e5185c5a12c9ae5ea7), but I don't know which commit was actually deployed to maven
