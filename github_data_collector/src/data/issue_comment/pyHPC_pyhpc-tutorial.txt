Removed the symlink and changed all of the paths to relative paths.

Apendix 00 was left as is. It had a few lines using the files path, but there also seemed to be references to files that didn't exist in the repository. I'm leaving that one be.

The "File" Symlink in the notebook folder doesn't transfer correctly to windows machines. This causes all of the images to be broken in the notebooks. 

Using the ".." folder identifier will allow the images to be linked relative to the notebooks and should work everywhere. 

Is there some reason a symlink is used instead? 

The iPython notebook 02_Speeding_Python.pynb fails to load (the other notebooks seem to load without issue). 

The error message given is as follows:

Error loading notebook:
An error occurred while loading this notebook. Most likely this notebook is in a newer format than is supported by this version of IPython. This version can load notebook formats v3 or earlier.
