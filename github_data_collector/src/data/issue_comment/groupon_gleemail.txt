Hi, i am new to gleemail . I downloaded and started my gleemail project. I open the web interface but when i go to Render HTML> Any option nothing happens. 

I opened my console and i can see that it produces this request:  http://localhost:4433/templates/example.html?useAbsoluteUrls=true&renderer=data&dataIndex=0

that gives me a 500.

Is there anyway where i can see a log? i dont get anything in the console where i started the project. Thanks!


Please, let new users now about how to properly fill config.json with smtp and other stuff.
This make us cry for a while.

Some examples in README.md, or empty config in project directory will resolve this
