This is the ticket to track the issue about CRD informer won't stop.
ref: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/79610
The CLI prints the following message when a resource exists in the spec directory which may confuse the user. It should display duplicate resource exists in spec or cluster.
```
Use "fission function options" for a list of global command-line options (applies to all commands).
Error: error creating function spec: same name resource (h1) already exists in namespace (default)
```
The executor wrongly removes rolebindings if environment & package CRDs are not in the default namespace.
It would be great if we can support `kubectl tree` or directly integrate it into CLI. For example, list all resources related to a CRD.

It's unreasonable to set fetcher cpu limits to 1000m by default.

We should change it to a more reasonable value.
Currently, the Java version tested and officially supported in Fission is Java8. It might be good to test and publish images for the latest versions of Java - 11, 12, 13, etc.

Resolves #895 
Adding --dry option to view the generated spec. It can be used with --spec as well. 
We can view and save the spec at same time, if we will provide --dry and --spec in same command. --spec will work same as previously ( specs directory is required) but you can view your generated specs.

We should have better namespace isolation to prevent any confusion. For example, now if a function CRD created under `default` namespace the function pod will be created in `fission-function` which brings confusion. 

We should create related resources in the same namespace where the CRD located.

The requirement is to be able to check the logs of all the components at once, we can achieve that using [stern](https://github.com/wercker/stern) as of now, but if we set a common label (let's say `application=fission`) to all the fission core components we can easily check the log using 
```
kubectl logs -n fission -l application=fission 
```
