Hope to support Chinese lunar calendar
I have many events in my calendar and use the shortcut of itsycal to pop up the calendar along with my events. However, when there are many events, it's hard to find the current or upcoming event. It'd be great if when I open the calendar, it automatically scrolls to the current event. Perhaps a horizontal line is used to indicate the current time/event.

Thanks for the great work!

I am running Itsycal on Catalina 10.15.1, and when I try to open the preference, the app isn't responding and keep showing the calendar on top of the screen. I have to force exit the app using activity monitor.

I wonder if there is a solution to this problem...
When I open Itsycal, it apeare a warning windows:

Move Itsycal to the Applications folder

Itsycal must be run from the Applications folder in order to work properly.

Please quit Itsycal, move it to the Applications folder, and relaunch.

in fact, I was copy the app to the Applications folder and run on it.

By default system time clock has its own systray time format stored in 'defaults' can you read initial value from its content or also store it backwards?

    # defaults write 'com.apple.menuextra.clock' 'DateFormat' -string 'yyyy-MMM-dd EEE H:mm'
Not sure what it means, but when I try to send money I'm getting:

"Sorry, you don't have the permission to send a payment. Please request for access from the account owner."

And for sure it referening to your account, not mine :)

Anyway, money is evil, just "Thanks you!"
Hi!

First of all - I really love this app and I'm using it daily. Great job!

So my issue really is around URLs in calendar events. Before the last update, I was able to click a link in Itsycal and it would take me to the online meeting, but now the URLs are deformed and are no longer clickable.
Special characters no longer work as well, so maybe there's an issue with encoding.

Hi @sfsam !

Could I translate it into Korean?

Thanks!
Would it be possible to show a clock (or at least the exact time with seconds) in the popup when you open Itsycal?

Sometimes you need the time with seconds, and Itsycal would be the perfect place for it.
I know you can give a custom format including the seconds in the menubar, but perhaps there should be two separate formats:

1. for in the menubar (short: Wed 1 Feb 12:33)
2. to show as a first line in the popup (Long: Wednesday 1/2/2000 12:33:44)
