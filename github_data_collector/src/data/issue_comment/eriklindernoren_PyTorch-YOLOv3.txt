Hey can the save darknet weights function in models.py be used to save the weights in pytorch format ,i.e with the extension .pt ,or how is that function used?
how do we use function to convert the darknet weights to pytorch weights ? Is it just by passing the path with the model name extension as '.pt'
Will images with empty label files will be considered in training ?
Hi everyone, I would appreciate if you could help me with some questions related to YOLOv3 feature maps. Sorry if these questions are kind of dumb or naive, but I'm just getting started in this topic.

I understand that for a 416x416 image we will end up with a 13x13x255 tensor, i.e., 13x13x (85x3 boxes). The first 4 of these 85 attributes correspond to the bbox coordinates (offsets), the 5th is the objectness score and the remaining 80 are class probabilities.

Now, if I plot the 13x13 map related to the 6th attribute (that is the first class) I obtain the following image:

![Diez1FeatureMap(Persona)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30093539/72330523-46ce6f00-367c-11ea-8a13-ae9b4fffae22.png)

where the original image was:

![body1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30093539/72330555-53eb5e00-367c-11ea-91da-42f2d2385297.jpg)

So, my questions are:

1) Are these 13x13 images, the maps related to each category? (referring to the last 80 attributes). For example, I noticed that the 6th attribute corresponds to the category "person". So, is the 6th 13x13 map (shown in the image) associated with the category "person"?

2) What do the pixels with higher values (yellow ones) refer to? Are they pointing to locations where it is more likely to find a person (in this case)?

3) How are the probabilities for each class calculated? I've read that for YOLOv3 the do not rely on Softmax anymore, but they use a regression. How does this regression work?

I really hope you could help me with these issues. Thank you in advance. P.S. Sorry if my English is not that good, I'm trying to do my best. (Please, let me know if you don't understand something).

Increasingly more unstable as new versions of dependencies come out
i did as README ,but still have this problem。
ex：classes = 1
       filters = （classes+4+1）*3 =18

please help me ,THANK YOU ~~~
I met error as below when I try to train the custom data(512*512 jpg images).
What is the problem? Please review my error message.

when i have run the train.py,  python detect.py --weights_path  weights/yolov3.weights.and then i try to run the detect.py,it occurs this bug,
RuntimeError: Given groups=1, weight of size [32, 3, 3, 3], expected input[1, 1, 416, 416] to have 3 channels, but got 1 channels instead
how can i solve it to detect the sample pictures
