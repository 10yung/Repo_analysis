I'd like to get maximum in interval among the interpolated values.

Would it be possible?
you'll need to edit package.json & register the package with npm. one
it's published, you should be able to use `npm install smoothjs`

sorry for spamming you with these PRs! I'm using this in one of my projects and it will make it like a billion times easier to manage if they're registered with npm or bower.

Would be great if Smooth.js was registered with [Bower](http://bower.io). There's some information on [doing this here](http://devhike.blogspot.com/2013/06/how-to-register-your-library-or.html).

Would it be possible to add in support for typed arrays? In particular, Uint8 arrays would be best.

Edit: I believe that you can just replace your Array methods like `someArray.slice(...)` with `Array.prototype.slice.call(someArrayLikeObject, ...)`.

Edit 2: It could also be beneficial to use Float32Arrays since it performs a bit better.

I can delete control points by double-clicking them, but I can't create new ones. I get this error:

Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'moveTo' on 'CanvasRenderingContext2D': 2 arguments required, but only 1 present.

Did ctx.moveTo() used to accept one array instead of two separate x and y parameters?

I'm running Chrome 32.0.1700.68.
