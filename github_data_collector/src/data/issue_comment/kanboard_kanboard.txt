### Actual behaviour
When you try to close a sub task, you are reminded that you have another sub task in progress and asking for a choice before continuing, useful but the name of the project where it is located is not present and in this case it becomes less useful. :confused:

### Expected behaviour
I believe that adding the name of the project to which the sub-task in question refers is very useful and I would also insert a clickable link to access the main task in a new window. :wink:

What do you think?

### Configuration

- Kanboard version: 1.2.13

I know this is a duplicate of #831
Definitely worth implementing though.
It would be nice if the comment would appear in a column between "Title" and "Assignee" in the subtask section of the task view. 

I would LOVE for the subtask section to look like this:

Subtask 1
- [x] Make sure to
- [ ] And also
- [ ] Etc

Subtask 2
- [x] Make sure to
- [x] And also
- [ ] Etc


I don't think this would duplicate all features of tasks, and I think it would make subtasks much more useful.

### Actual behaviour

On a populated Board View (approx. 660 tasks), dragging and dropping a task between columns/swimlanes takes ~ 10 seconds to complete.
During the task move, the processing of **thousands of SQL queries** generates a CPU spike.

The severe delay when dragging & dropping tasks (which is considered to be a main visual advantage of the Board View) results in a severely detrimented GUI experience.

### Expected behaviour

The omission of superfluous SQL queries should result in a more fluent task handling.

### Logs
Attached : debug1.log, debug2.log, debug3.log

### Configuration

- Kanboard version: 1.2.13
- Database type and version: PostgreSQL 9.4.14
- PHP version: 7.3.13
- OS: CentOS 7.7
- Browser: Mozilla Firefox 71.0

### Setup

- KanBoard runs on a dedicated virtual instance with adequate CPU & memory and SSD storage.
- Approx. 7000 tasks, spread across a couple of boards.
- Performance comparison between : 
  - less populated boardA (debug2.log ) : 171 visible tasks, 2 swimlanes, 8 columns
  - more populated boardB (debug3.log ) : 661 visible tasks, 22 swimlanes, 8 columns

### Steps to reproduce & analysis

#### Observation
- Moving a task on boardA takes about 2-3 seconds (usability = acceptable) ;
- Moving a task on boardA takes about 9-10 seconds (usability = severely detrimented).

#### Assumption
Apparently contrary to https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/4197 (and the continued discussion in https://kanboard.discourse.group/t/some-of-the-biggest-performance-issues-are-in-the-board-view-not-the-sqlite-database-backend/762), which seems to focus on the HTTP client aspect, it appears extraneous database server operations (with CPU spikes of 40-55%) are a cause of the performance degradation.

#### Data
* debug1.log (~ 900 lines, 8 second timespan) is a reference debug log, with no manual/GUI Kanboard actions logged ;
* debug2.log (~ 7200 lines, 8 seconds) : drag/drop of a task on boardA
* debug3.log (~ 26000 lines, 17 seconds) : drag/drop of a task on boardB

#### Analysis
* debug1.log (900 lines) : **200** SELECT queries, of which **0** _"SELECT xxx"_ queries (0%)
* debug2.log (900 lines) : **2300** SELECT queries, of which **2050** _"SELECT xxx"_ queries (89%)
* debug3.log (26000 lines) : **8500** SELECT queries, of which **8000** _"SELECT xxx"_ queries (94%)

_"SELECT xxx"_ : 
```
[debug] SQL: SELECT "value" FROM "project_has_metadata"   WHERE "project_id" = ? AND "name" = ?    LIMIT 1
```

#### Remarks
* Database is subject to "VACUUM ANALYZE" ;
* Using the "Move task" link in the Task detail page is instantaneous ;
* Collapsing all swimlanes makes no discernible difference.

### Actual behaviour

There is a wrong define Name in Documentation to deactivate automatic LDAP user creation:

2.23.8  Disable Automatic Account CreationBy default, Kanboard will create a user account automatically if nothing is found.You can disable this behavior if you prefer to create user accounts manually to restrict Kanboard to only some people.Just change the value ofLDAP_ACCOUNT_CREATIONtofalse:// Automatically create user account
define('LDAP_ACCOUNT_CREATION', false);

### Expected behaviour

The implemented define is LDAP_USER_CREATION

### Configuration

- Kanboard version: 1.2.13


### Actual behaviour

1. User A (manager) affords Read access to his Project 1 to User B.

2. User B (manager) creates Project 2, Task X.

3. User B can duplicate Task X to Project 1!

### Expected behaviour

User B cannot create tasks in a project he only has Read access to.
In big organizations, it is sometimes not possible to change the existing LDAP structure (OU, groups, etc.). It is not possible to make it satisfying the existing LDAP_GROUP_MANAGER_DN setting in order to get any new LDAP user to be Manager at its creation.
Adding the LDAP_USER_DEFAULT_ROLE_MANAGER boolean setting makes it possible to get any new user to be a Manager when set to true.
Of course this setting is disabled by default.
Fix for #4359 

Added some top level domains to the match function of the AttachmentLinkProvider so that .com, .net, .edu, .org, .io, and .gov are marked as web links not attachments. This will prevent links like https://www.github.io from being marked as attachments instead of web links. See my comment in the issue this fixes for more details.
### Actual behaviour

Instead of showing the Captcha after failed logins or when you want to reset the password, it just shows the alt-text. If you want to see the captcha, and right click to "view image", it just says "The image "https://todo.0x90.space/?controller=CaptchaController&action=image" cannot be displayed because it contains errors."

When you replay the request with curl, it returns the following file, which seems to be a corrupted jpeg file, generated by gd:

https://oc2.links-tech.org/s/g20GTYwYpHC1Q5Q

No idea what kind of file that is. GIMP gives the most verbose error message when opening it: `Not a JPEG file: starts with 0x0a 0xff`

I looked at it with `hexdump -C`, and it seems to contain the string `CREATOR: : gd-jpeg v1.0 (using IJG JPEG v80), quality = 90` in the beginning; so it seems to be some bug with gd.

### Expected behaviour

A Captcha is displayed.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open https://todo.0x90.space/forgot-password
2. See that instead of a captcha image, only the alt-text "Captcha" appears
3. Look at the image in the browser: https://todo.0x90.space/?controller=CaptchaController&action=image
4. download it with curl for further debugging: `curl 'https://todo.0x90.space/?controller=CaptchaController&action=image' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:71.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/71.0' -H 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'DNT: 1' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Cookie: KB_SID=f5mv3qo3g62g22t4em77lbpg3n' -H 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1' -H 'Cache-Control: max-age=0' -H 'TE: Trailers' --output captcha.jpeg`

### Configuration

- Kanboard version: kanboard/kanboard:v1.2.13 docker container
- Database type and version: docker setup with sqlite
- PHP version: 7.3.11
- OS: alpine I guess.
- Browser: Firefox 71.0

### Actual behaviour

Collapsed swimlane stays hidden even if there is only one that lefts (and toggles are hidden). 

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->

### Expected behaviour

- Swimlane is not hidden if there is only one (even if has the collapsed state).
- Show swimlane toggle even if there is only one.

<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->

### Steps to reproduce

- Create a fresh project
- Add a task to the Default swimlane
- Create a Extra swimlane
- Collapse the Default swimlane
- Expand the Extra swimlane
- Delete the Extra swimlane
- Have a look to the Board
- Default swimlane disappeared

### Configuration

- Kanboard version: I'm not admin on my instance, I was unable to find this information. Let me know if it's fixed now and I'll ask for an update at my side.
- OS: Windows 10 
- Browser: Chromium


Let me know if you need more details.
Thank you !

This appears to have been addressed before : 
https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/1932
https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/pull/2147
https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/4077

but, despite it looking like it was fixed, I'm still seeing swimlanes with a min-height of 400px even when there is only one task in them meaning 4 swimlanes with one task that should fit on one screen takes a lot of vertical scrolling past empty space to see everything.  (see screnshopt below).  There are instrctions to edit css files and to uncheck the max height option in the actions menu but these must relate to previous versions as I can neither find entries in the css (or .js) that set the min-height nor the actions menu to uncheck the max height option.

### Actual behaviour
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->
Swim lanes have lots of empty space
Swim lanes have a minimum height no matter how few tasks they have in them wasting screen space.
### Expected behaviour
Swim lanes should contract in height to fit just the tasks in that swim lane to reduce vertical scaling.
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->

### Steps to reproduce
Add multiple swim lanes.  
Add one task per swimlane.
This happens with both the default theme and the blueboard theme

### Screenshots
These are the only tasks in this project there are no other tasks in other columns.
