I have downloaded the whole VPNOn package to build and run in Xcode，but noticed like this:
/*******
Module compiled with Swift 5.1 cannot be imported by the Swift 5.1.2 compiler: /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/VPNOn/Carthage/Build/iOS/KeychainAccess.framework/Modules/KeychainAccess.swiftmodule/x86_64.swiftmodule
*******/
How can I deal with this problem and run it well in my Xcode. 
My running environment:
macOS Catalina 10.15.1
Xcode:Version 11.2 (11B52)

Please give me a hand , if you know how to deal with , please answer me an email to  335940945@qq.com, or leave message here in github.
thank you very much.

 I am getting the below mentioned error, when I install the app

dyld`__abort_with_payload:

How I can Fix this issue, Please Suggest.

我下载下来，修改id ,同时给id 加 person vpn 和相应权限就是运行成功过
Hi,

This is a great project! I have successfully managed to compile and deploy it on my Phone. It can also successfully connect to the ikv2 server.

However, I can't find the today widget in the notifications in order to turn it on and off faster.

Could this be an issue with iOS 11?  I have checked notifications and can't find VPN ON listed there though.  Could be related.

Many thanks for your advice,
Houman
Thanks for your great work.
By the way, are you considering to support shadowsocks vpn? As most of traditional vpn protocol is blocked in China mainland.
Thanks.
