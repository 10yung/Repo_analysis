i tried this
``` swift
Just.get(url, params: params, headers: headers) { response in
       if response.status.code == 200 {
              let json = JSON(response.json!) 
              .......
      }
}
```
we managed, to log the content.
`response.json` returns `nil` because it is not in full response.
sample:
```json
{
    order: {
         'id':  1,
         'notes': ''
    }
```

Hi @dduan currently I found a problem when trying to do `Just.get()`.
from what I see, there is a possibility when doing `Just.get()` the `request` is `nil` when trying to `makeTask`
```swift
// Just.swift
...
public func synthesizeRequest(...) -> URLRequest?
...
func makeTask(_ request: URLRequest, configuration: TaskConfiguration)
    -> URLSessionDataTask?
...
guard let request = synthesizeRequest()
...
// variabel `request` below can be `nil`
if let task = makeTask(request, configuration: config) {
    task.resume()
}
```

isn't `synthesizeRequest()` supposed return `URLRequest` without `nil`?

This only happens in production build and I can't reproduce the crash.

I want to get the real link of a page from a link that redirects, such as this: https://apple.news/AQZXxg8mUQfKrEaM9MRBpxw .  However, when I do

        Just.get("https://apple.news/AQZXxg8mUQfKrEaM9MRBpxw")
        { r in
            
            print(r.statusCode)
            print(r.url)
        }
it still prints the same link.  Does Just not get real redirect links or am I doing it wrong?

Getting the following error when I try to run on my device:

```
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

Tried a bunch of things to change settings, etc. based on Google searching but nothing worked, and errors are only coming from this Pod out of all my pods.

Hello, Im a Korean android developer and new with swift4.

I need to post a url as restful api, and it takes parameter as a single string body that is encrypted like 'QlDlLNnhk6N81QfAXfTVT09Z5UOHO/uzXax26Z4bp5U='.

It will be decrypted as a JSON string like { "id": "abc", "pwd":"1234" }, so i cannot put just data:[ key : value ].

Is there any way to send single string? or should i find another http library?

Sometimes you’re not sure one endpoint will last forever so it’d be nice to be able to pass a list of them just in case 
Hi! I used your library in one project and it worked well, but after ios updated to 12 version it's sending optional values in responses. I need to update to 0.7.1 version but it not available via pods. 
In other languages this is basic functionality, but it seems its a bit more difficult to pull of in Swift/Objective C. It would be cool if Just could add this feature.
