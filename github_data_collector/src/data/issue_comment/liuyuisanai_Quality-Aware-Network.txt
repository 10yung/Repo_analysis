In the paper, you release the performance in MARS. How can I train on the MARS dataset?
Hi, How can I test single Image?
Hi, what is the possword of LPW Dataset(Baidu Cloud) ? thx

In your CVPR paper, Equation 8 provides the gradient for weights correspongding to line 118 in batch_pool_layer.cpp.
I have a question that what is x_(i,j) in Equation 8? How is it calculated in the code?
1.The output of pool_s  layer isn't  used in the next, why?
2. In this prototxt, you choose the "pool2/3x3_s2" as the input of quality generation unit, which is the different from the train_PQAN_image.prototxt. What's the difference between them?

Hello, I‘m interested in “Unsupervised Partial Quality Predictor for Large-Scale Person Re-identification“， but I can't find the article on the Internet, have you published it ?
