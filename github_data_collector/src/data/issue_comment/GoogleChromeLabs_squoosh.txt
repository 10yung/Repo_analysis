I searched within this repo and GitHub returned no results, so... here's an issue about the JPEG XL codec :)

More info about this codec: https://jpeg.org/jpegxl/

JS/Wasm demo: https://libwebpjs.appspot.com/jpegxl/

I noticed that loading state is only set to false after successful image processing, and in case of error the spinner never stops spinning.

Steps to reproduce (might not work for everybody):
* Load the "device screen" sample photo
* Click resize
* Click up arrow to increase width

Noticed on Chrome 79 and Firefox 72 on Linux
'Don't make me think'

**Describe the solution you'd like**
This is a great tool for non technical users who don't know the details of image compression (like me).

Each menu option should be explained
Alternatively there should be links to be the best guides (but these do not cover every option)
