Just tried to convert an mp4 file and the resulting gif made two loops. I don't see a setting for number of loops, but it loops twice.   1.28 (12) 
I tried Drop To Gif today to create .gifs out of a few .mov's that are about 140mb each.

I drop one .gif on top and nothing happens. The .mov starts playing in the window, but a .gif is never outputted. I tried looking in Console.app for any obvious errors and I see a lot of logging but nothing so useful.

On macOS Mojave 10.14.3, the app seems to disassociate objects of kind: Folder with their preview icon. Though they will have a preview icon, folders will have just a thumbnail of a blank page.
The slider for max dimensions is too limiting, it would be great to be able to have a larger range.
I made a screen recording (1600*112 resolution), but when Drop To Gif turns it into a 900*56px GIF, the bottom line is gray. Argh.
I have used this to simply convert my 1,3mb mp4 to gif but can't get an export, then dropped the video over and over into the app, and my disk space increased like crazy.
Then I removed the app with CleanMyMac.
Now I downloaded it again and when I tried to open it, it says:
“%@” can’t be found.

what should I do :(
Please add a license so that more people will be able to consume you're project. Preferably MIT.
I'm seeing an issue where processes are not not ended after each conversion. Anyone else experiencing this?
When I try to make a gif out of a video file (mov), Drop to GIF crashes. 

I'm using the most up-to-date version, 1.28 running macOS Sierra 10.12.3

Just installed the latest version.

1) I do not see the animations as seen in the demo GIFs. When I drag a video file into the application I get a system toast that says "Animating" then it continues to loop the video indefinitely.

2) After setting the watch folder and dragging videos into it--- nothing happens.

Am I missing something? Or some kind of permissions?
