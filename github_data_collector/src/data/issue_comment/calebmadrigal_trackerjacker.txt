In OSX Catalina, trackerjacker will fail to run because of a problem with scapy:

```
netif = rt[4 + mtu_present + prio_present + refs_present + locked]
```

Fix this by upgrading your scapy to the latest version:

```
pip3 install scapy --upgrade
```
Hello! I can successfully run trackerjacker on Kali Linux, but in Arch Linux (trackerjacker is installed from BlackArch repository) it fails.

If I run it like this:
`sudo trackerjacker -i wlp0s20f0u1 --track --trigger-plugin foxhunt --log-level DEBUG`
It outputs nothing and nothing happens.

If I run it this way:
`sudo trackerjacker -i wlp0s20f0u1 --track  --log-level DEBUG`

It outputs many errors:

On both systems I use the same Wi-Fi adapter Alfa AWUS052NH. Do you have some ideas about the origin of the problem?
Thanks in advanced.
Hi, is there any solutions to use with trackerjacker to de-rendomize mac address for Apple, Android devices,...
Your tool/software have been inventoried on [*Rawsec's CyberSecurity Inventory*](https://inventory.rawsec.ml/).

### What is Rawsec's CyberSecurity Inventory?

An inventory of tools and resources about CyberSecurity. This inventory aims to help people to find everything related to CyberSecurity.

+ **Open source**: Every information is available and up to date. If an information is missing or deprecated, you are invited to (help us).
+ **Practical**: Content is categorized and table formatted, allowing to search, browse, sort and filter.
+ **Fast**: Using static and client side technologies resulting in fast browsing.
+ Rich tables: search, sort, browse, filter, clear
+ Fancy informational popups
+ Badges / Shields
+ Static API
+ Twitter bot

More details about features [here](https://inventory.rawsec.ml/features.html).

Note: the inventory is a FLOSS (Free, Libre and Open-Source Software) project.

### Why?

+ **Specialized websites**: Some websites are referencing tools but additional information is not available or browsable. Make additional searches take time.
+ **Curated lists**: Curated lists are not very exhaustive, up to date or browsable and are very topic related.
+ **Search engines**: Search engines sometimes does find nothing, some tools or resources are too unknown or non-referenced. These is where crowdsourcing is better than robots.

### Why should you care about being inventoried?

Mainly because this is giving visibility to your tool, more and more people are using the *Rawsec's CyberSecurity Inventory*, this helps them find what they need.

### Why the badge?

The badge shows to your community that your are inventoried. This also shows you care about your project and want it growing, that your tool is not an abandonware.

Also we took time to inventory your tool and you are gaining visibility from that: **we added your tool to our inventory to make it known now it is your turn to add the badge to your project README to help our project being known**.

### Ok but...

You should think I asked nothing to you, I don't need visibility or/and I don't like your badge: your are free not to use it.

I'd love to be able to (optionally) include the Probe Requests in the map file. 
Hello Sir. I'm a Graphics Designer. I'm happy to see an open source project, So, I want provide a logo for you. Would you mind if I propose a new logo design to improve visualization of your project as my Open Source Contribution?

Trackerjacker will display the help page but no other commands.

This is the second try, the first I did an apt upgrade before installing trackerjacker, same result.

I am looking to see about importing into neo4j for graphing which typically only imports from CSV.  
I tried to install directly from pip3 `pip3 install trackerjacker` and there is an error when installing the dependency `ruamel.yaml==0.15.0`, this is the error:

```

I just saw that the previous version asked for `ruamel.yaml>=0.15.35`, so I just did the instalation of that version and it's all fine:

`'pip3 install 'trackerjacker==1.8.0'`

So the current versión is broken, at least for Mac OS High Sierra - Python 3.7.0 - pip 18.0
Otherwise fails with:

```
pip3 install .
