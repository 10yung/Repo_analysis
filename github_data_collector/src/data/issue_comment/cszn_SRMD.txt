Hello,I can not understand one sentence in your paper,'When the training error keeps unchanged in five sequential epochs, we merge the parameters of each batch normalization into the adjacent convolution filters'.I try to figure it out by reading your code but fail to deal with matlab...Thanks!
In your paper:  We set the rotation angle range to [0,π]. For the scaling of eigenvalues, it is set from 0.5 to 6, 8 and 10 for scale factors 2, 3 and 4, respectively. 

In your code:
ksize  = 15;
theta  = pi*rand(1);
l1     = 0.1+9.9*rand(1);
l2     = 0.1+(l1-0.1)*rand(1);
kernel = anisotropic_Gaussian(ksize,theta,l1,l2); % double
kernel = single(kernel);

I would like to ask how to set the parameter of the gaussian blur kernel.
thank you!
Hi, thank you so much for the source code. Besides, could you please provide the resulting image of the degradation model?
The training is normal. The following problems are encountered in the testing process. 
wrong with vl_nnbnorm
vl::impl::dispatch_cudnn<C, CU>::operator(): BatchNormForwardWithMomentCudnn<dataType>::operator(): cuDNN error [cudnn:
"d:\\matlab\\r2018b\\bin\\matconvnet-1.0-beta25\\matlab\\src\\bits\\nnbnorm_cudnn.cu":155 (CUDNN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM)]
I have some confusion about the generation of LR images with different spatially variant degradations, can you provide more details? Thank you very much!

How can I fix it?

When I was runing the generatepatches.m, a error was raised that "undefined function or variable 'data_augmentation'.
I would like asking about it,  is it a default function or user defined function that no provided?
thank you very much!
I saw the dimention-reduced blur kernels are precalculated as SRMD_non_blind.mat. I am very interested in the problem how can precalculate？ Because I try to SR the real image. If have some tips ？
