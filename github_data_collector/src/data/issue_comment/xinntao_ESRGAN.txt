Good evening everyone :)

This is my first time posting here and I’m a complete Python/Deep Learning/AI noobie for the time being, so apologies in advance if I end up wasting your time after all with this whole Thread.

Anyways, some days ago I was able to successfully install the ESRGAN Upsaler (https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN) along with all of its prerequisites.

I tested my first image with my new RTX 2070 Super and the result came out in an astounding 4 seconds (considering that last time I tried it with a CPU it took 7 hours).

Unfortunately though, when I tried to replicate this whole process, the following error popped up in the Anaconda Prompt and which I would appreciate it extremely if anyone could help me resolve it:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File “test.py”, line 34, in
output = model(img_LR).data.squeeze().float().cpu().clamp_(0, 1).numpy()
File “C:\Users\ctamv\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\torch\nn\modules\module.py”, line 541, in call

File “C:\Users\ctamv\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\torch\nn\functional.py”, line 2500, in interpolate
return torch._C._nn.upsample_nearest2d(input, _output_size(2))
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 5.21 GiB (GPU 0; 8.00 GiB total capacity; 3.01 GiB already allocated; 2.66 GiB free; 336.43 MiB cached)

I have been trying for hours until now to solve this problem after visiting multiple other threads, but with no success (mostly because I don’t even know where to input PyTorch commands in the fist place, as the Anaconda Prompt doesn’t let me run them…)

Finally, one last observation I did was the fact that, according to the last line of the above output, even though my GPU's full 8GBs of VRAM are correctly displayed, along with the current 3GBs approximately that are being used and the cache, the remaining 2.66GB of free VRAM are incorrectly displayed, as with basic calculations they should had been AT LEAST 4.6GBs of free VRAM if the above numbers are corect...

Apologies again for my general ignorance on the subjectand thanks in advance for your help :)

你好，我找了很久灭有看到你们GAN部分的训练代码，请问可以参考下吗？我想和我的工作做下对比。
hello, when i was reading the RRDBNet_arch.py, I found that you use interpolate('mode='nearest'') to up sampling.
Compared with some other models(like EDSR), which use pixel shuffle. Is there any advantage to using this interpolate？
Thank you
Hi, inspired from your model, I have written a similar ESRGAN model with spectral_normalization and a few other tweaks. Although mostly, the underlying model architecture is same. I am also using VGG19_54 for feature extraction.
I'm trying to train the model to super resolve images which VGG19 has never been trained on. 

My generator is not producing the highest quality images, there are a few distortions, although the perception of image is excellent. I believe the fault lies in the discriminator not being able to discriminate between fake and real images. Will you please suggest something I can do to mitigate it?

I was thinking if I have to remove VGG_19 part, I can extend the discriminator to be a proper robust CNN 
OR
I can train a VGG19 model without pretrained weights on my own dataset and then use it to extract features. Will that work? 
hello,thanks for you wanderful work,this project helps me a lot,
I want to train the model to fit my own scales size, actually my picture is low quality but the same size with the HR pictures,so I must modify your net and thus I can not use  your pre-train model --RRDN_PSNR_x4 ，so I  want to know the train details about your pre-train model like iterations and learning rate,etc.
Hi,
     In your paper,first, you train a PSNR-oriented model with the L1 loss, and then train the RAGAN, I want to knew, before you train the RAGAN,how much iterations do you train the PSNR-oriented model.

Hello Xintao,

Have you compared ESRGAN model with the xiaomi’s FALSR model? How about the results?

thank you!

Hi ran into an error saying RRDB_ESRGAN_x4.pth not founds in models might be a little stupid qn but where can I find the original pre-trained model?
Thanks for your work! I am wondering how to retrain the RRDB_PSNR_x4.pth model from scratch. Can I do that by changing some options in https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsr/blob/master/codes/options/test/test_ESRGAN.yml?
