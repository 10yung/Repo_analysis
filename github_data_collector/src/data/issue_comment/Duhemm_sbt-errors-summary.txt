If the following is added to build.sbt
```
maxErrors := 10
```
Only 10 errors are shown at most. This is not respected when this plugin is enabled.
@agilesteel I've added some details about sbt-errors-summary and how to contribute, but it's probably incomplete. Let me know what you think and don't hesitate to add more information!

And I'd be delighted to get some help from you if you're still interested in maintaining this plugin!

This will make warnings more visible which I think is a good thing. It's also an almost necessary feature in order to enable a warning non-fatal locally but fatal on ci server kind of workflow, since one does not want to have to do a clean compile before submitting a PR
It would be nice if the line and column numbers were appended to the filename like here

With the line number:column, Cmd+click in iTerm will open the file with the cursor at the right position. Without it, iTerm opens the file with cursor at line 0 column 0. 
As first mentioned in https://github.com/Duhemm/sbt-errors-summary/issues/8, on my branch I made the following changes:

* changed colours of filenames
* made most colours bold so they are more readable on black backgrounds (at least in my envs)
* in the by-filename report at the end
  * sort by filename
  * only print if more than one file
  * print total error/warning count per file
  * don't print line numbers
  * consolidate problem ids where possible (eg. `[1-4,9]` instead of `[1,2,3,4,9]`)
* print total errors and warnings

After a big refactoring I often like to loosely track my progress by watching the total number of errors decrease. Such info is missing from this plugin.
