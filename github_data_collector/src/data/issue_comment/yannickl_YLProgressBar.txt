First of all, thank yannickl for this awesome project.

We imported the version `3.10.2` into our project, and found that the `dealloc` method was never called.

I found the `_progressTargetTimer` may never be invalid if the progress didn't reach the end. 
https://github.com/yannickl/YLProgressBar/blob/c7b29a65f2834a398214970b963a23d3d859956e/YLProgressBar/YLProgressBar.m#L326-L342

So I wrote this in the host view's `dealloc` method to invalidate the `_progressTargetTimer`:
```objc
_progressBar.progress = 0;
```

The `dealloc` method was called finally.
when the progress view type is rounded with gradient colors, there is a tiny part of the background track view appears on top of the progress view

if incrementValue is 0 ，should not create a timer。
can't support the RTL with autolayout 
I tried to use setProgress(0.0, animated: true) at first but when I get progress by "self.progressBar.progress" it's return 0.3 not 0.0 and I tried to set 0.3035. It's still return 0.3 for me.
Why it's not update?
I would like to implement cancel button into this progress bar.
It looks like for some reason with a 0% label, it doesn't show up. But it would be nice to have it, as otherwise it looks like the bar is broken or something... 

Thank you
Hi, in my app, I'm implementing auto-layout. When i try to implement YLProgressBar in my xib file, i'm getting "Failed to load designables from path (null)".

Can the question is how can i use this library in xib that contains auto-layout?
