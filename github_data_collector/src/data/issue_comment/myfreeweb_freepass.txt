```
 cargo build --release
warning: An explicit [[bin]] section is specified in Cargo.toml which currently
disables Cargo from automatically inferring other binary targets.
This inference behavior will change in the Rust 2018 edition and the following
files will be included as a binary target:
*freepass/cli/src/main.rs

This is likely to break cargo build or cargo test as these files may not be
ready to be compiled as a binary target today. You can future-proof yourself
and disable this warning by adding `autobins = false` to your [package]
section. You may also move the files to a location where Cargo would not
automatically infer them to be a target, such as in subfolders.

For more information on this warning you can consult
https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5330
warning: path `/freepass/cli/src/main.rs` was erroneously implicitly accepted for binary `freepass`,
please set bin.path in Cargo.toml

Not a problem when compiling, but thought it would help to note this behavior.
i checked the released tab but you only have "serde-migration". i wanted to use it but i need to compile it? it would be much nicer to just have it built.
Right now I can print the public key from freepass, or add the private key to ssh-agent. Are there any plans to allow printing the private key as well? I want to be able to export the keys for use but right now I have to do it in a round about way. Is this an option you are considering adding?
