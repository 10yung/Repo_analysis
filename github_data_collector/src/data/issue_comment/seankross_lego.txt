I have realized that in many places LEGO has been spelled lowercase as in _lego_.  This is against the LEGO brand guidelines which can be found here: [https://bricks.stackexchange.com/a/8659](https://bricks.stackexchange.com/a/8659)

I have tried to update all the files, but if there are some that I have missed please let me know!!
Very cool repo!
It would be nice to know some background information regarding the repository.
Where did you get the data, how do you keep it up to date, â€¦
Maybe you can enhance the README?!
