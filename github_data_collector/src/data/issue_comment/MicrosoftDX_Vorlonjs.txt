I tested with the documentation of this repository but it doesn't work for me.

Please. How can I write a log file in hard disk?

Thanks.
I am trying to debug and troubleshoot an outlook add-in on android outlook app using vorlon. Shouldn't it show android on dashboard? or it only shows the device if it's using a browser?
I used ip address instead of localhost, and I configured vorlon to use HTTPS instead of HTTP. But when I try to test the add-in on android, it doesn't show on the dashboard, what am I missing? 
I read that it runs the same way in a browser as it does in an Android App, or in this case, inside an Office Add-in.
@meulta please can you help? thanks in advance.
When i try to debug http://hc-prod-attinad.surge.sh using hosted verlonjs i am getting the following error: 
```
websocketerror
probeerror:Error:websocketerror
```

Vorlon URL: http://vorlonjs-attinad.herokuapp.com

Please see the attached screenshot:

I had used the following js code to add the debugger to the site instead of including the script:
```javascript
var script = document.createElement('script');
script.type = 'text/javascript';
script.src = 'http://vorlonjs-attinad.herokuapp.com/vorlon.js'
document.head.appendChild(script);
```
This pull request attempts to make the console plugin behave like a regular browser console:

1. We call an alias of `eval` which does the same thing but evaluates in the global scope. ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#Description - see last example ). Otherwise I *think* if you try to define a variable, it's just defined in the local scope of `evalOrderFromDashboard`.
2. We call `console.log` on the command we're about to execute. This is just to leave a log of it in the console log. Again, to make it look like a normal console.
3. I removed the `isLoggable` logic and decided that all responses should be logged.
4. Removed "unable to execute order" - just show the error in the console!
5. Don't pass `boolean` or `undefined` types to inspect - just pass back as string. Think this should fix #419.
