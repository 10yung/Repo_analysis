It would be really nice if the parsed JSON string would be exposed as a global variable. This way people can just open devtools and manipulate the data quickly.

Something like this (with **data** as the variable name, and an array as the value)
```
var ids = data.map(value => value.id)
console.log(ids) // [1, 2, 3]
```
Related to #128 and #131, this is just to give an idea how it could be made not to interfere with content <kbd>Copy</kbd>+<kbd>Paste</kbd>.

This is not complete solution as styling needs to be tweaked further.

Hi @bhollis,

Nice add-on!

What do you think of adding a little label with the JSON array count ? Thanks in advance!

for example
change:
- {...},

to
- {6},
