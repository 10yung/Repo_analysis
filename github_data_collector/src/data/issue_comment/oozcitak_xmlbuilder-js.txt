Without this patch, spaces and newlines are added to elements that contain CDATA. This was a problem for our application. Without this patch, pretty printed elements which contain CDATA are output as:
```
<elemName>
  <![CDATA[some data here]]>
</elemName>
```
With this patch, the output is:
```
<elemName><![CDATA[some data here]]></elemName>
```
I'm not seeing any way to validate xml generated using a xsd. this would really come in handy.

Is there an output option that will sort the order of attributes by their alphabetical order for nodes? 
Regardless of order of insertion. This arbitrary and merely a curiosity.

Thanks :)

For what I can see there is no support for using namespaces? Maybe that could be a feature worth implementing?
