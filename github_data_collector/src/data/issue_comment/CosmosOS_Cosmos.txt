I've got Cosmos to draw a couple of shapes on the screen, (taskbar), and I got a mouse from issue #1186, but I don't know how to use a mouse click event. I'm guessing it's something like: `if(Cosmos.System.MouseManager =  Cosmos.System.MouseState.L && Cosmos.System.MouseManager.X >= 100){             MyAction();             }`
But I'm not sure. Could someone help me?
