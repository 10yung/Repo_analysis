No more swipe up after each game ends.  Choose "New Game" and continue.

Verified on Xcode 10.1, iOS 8.4
Made minimal code change to support Swift 4.2
-Now if you win the game you can continue playing or start a new game.
-If you lose you can start a new game.
-HighScore.
when compile this source, I cannot solve two problems

First, line 231 at GameModel.swift, error message: "Use of local variable 'merge' before its declaration"

Actually I can find 'merge' function later, but I cannot lead to call it.

Second, line 309 and 324 at GameModel.swift, error message: "Type 'GameModel' has no member 'quiescentTileStillQuiescent' "

Please tell me how to solve these trouble.
