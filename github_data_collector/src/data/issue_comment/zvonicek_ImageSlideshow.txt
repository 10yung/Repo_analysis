I have to load an array of images that are in webp format. Is there any way I can load it using this library? Currently the image is not loading.
I have used Alamofire library to load images before but after updating to Xcode 11 it did not work. So I moved on to Kingfisher library.

You can look into it if you get the chance

- [ ] Mark items in the image carousel as accessibilityElements and add the accessibilityTrait .image if possible. This allows blind users to ask the system to attempt to describe what is shown but at the very least lets people know that the picker (which is supported by VoiceOver) is in fact changing something (currently the images aren't selectable by Voiceover).

- [ ] Mark images in the carousel's accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors property to true so they don't invert when smart invert is enabled! People using this setting expect most things to invert but not images which then become pretty weird looking.
