Repro steps:
1. Using AddLinkToURL: to add two urls inside the text, such as ‘Affogato’ and ‘mylink’.Note that the text must contain ‘\n’ character to repro this bug.
label.text = @"Affogato: Espresso served over gelato. Traditionally vanilla is used, but some coffeehouses or customers use any flavor \n \n 123 mylink.";

2. If the label’s layout was not set correctly before adding the link, the last accessibility element will get the wrong boundingRect (all zero) from the return value of boundingREctForCharacterRange:
3. boundingREctForCharacterRange: using label’s bounding size to measure the position of the highlighted element but the textContainer seems to ignore the ‘\n’ character will have additional line.
4. Thus, if user setting the correct frame such as using sizeToFit, it works fine. But if the user calls it later after adding the link, the position of accessibilityElement will get wrong.

Solution:
NSTextContainer’s size does not need to be the same as the label’s bounding size.
Instead, we can use
CGSizeMake(self.bounds.size.width, CGFLOAT_MAX)
 CTFontCreateWithName replaced with CTFontCreateWithFontDescriptor, avoiding CoreText error

`CoreText performance note: Client called CTFontCreateWithName() using name`

The problem is the same as here: https://github.com/TextureGroup/Texture/issues/1659
Hi,
   I am using this library in iOS App.This is great but i want that if someone entered Day or month name then it should not convert that into clickable link.
Please suggest how to do this.
Thanks in advance.

I see the notice   
```
Any properties affecting text or paragraph styling, such as `firstLineIndent` will only apply when text is set with an `NSString`. If the text is set with an `NSAttributedString`, these properties will not apply.
```
and  the "setText" method
```
if ([text isKindOfClass:[NSString class]]) {
    [self setText:text afterInheritingLabelAttributesAndConfiguringWithBlock:nil];
    return;
}
```
the "setText:afterInheritingLabelAttributesAndConfiguringWithBlock" call "setText" with a mutableAttributedString.  

The document tell me to set text rather than NSAttributedString, then the "setText" call itself with NSAttributedString in any case  
Hi,
I have a problem if my text break lines too much like this
" M
   M
   M
   M
   M
   M ...See more"

So I can not detect right link
This my code
`
func gestureRecognizer(_ gestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer, shouldReceive touch: UITouch) -> Bool {
        if gestureRecognizer.view is TTTAttributedLabel {
            let label = gestureRecognizer.view as! TTTAttributedLabel
            let point = touch.location(in: label)
            let link = label.link(at: point)
            return false
        }
        
        return true
    }
`
link wrong or nil
use cocoapods, use_frameworks! , then ..
I try it, but didn't work.
And in awakeFromNib method,  self.titleLabel.lineSpacing = 10; didn't work.
What should I do next?
