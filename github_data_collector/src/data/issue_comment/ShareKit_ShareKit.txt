Hello,
I was trying to re-compile one of my project after a while, I did a "pod update" an this installed the latest version of ShareKit and all the rest libraries.
Now I'm not able to compile the project, the error that I get is:

`Pods/Facebook-iOS-SDK/src/Network/FBRequest.m:370:61: Expected method to read dictionary element not found on object of type 'id<FBOpenGraphObject>'`

The error is coming from Facebook-iOS-SDK (3.24.4) library that is obviously required by ShareKit/Facebook....

Anyone else with the same problem? Facebook-iOS-SDK (3.24.4) seems to be a quite old version of the FB sdk.

I'm using the following software:
Xcode 9.4.1
Pod 1.5.3

and this is how I include ShareKit in my project:
```
		pod 'ShareKit/Facebook', '~> 6.0'
		pod 'ShareKit/WhatsApp', '~> 6.0'
		pod 'ShareKit/Twitter', '~> 6.0'
```

Thanks for any help I will get

The problem is that we use their deprecated sdk, and it does not support Swift, see https://github.com/liveservices/LiveSDK-for-iOS/issues/74

We should refactor our sharer to use https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-sdk-ios


There are duplicates such as SHKSendDidFinish and SHKSendDidFailWithError. Could be merged the same way as AuthDidFinish, with result key inside.

Also, "success" key in SHKAuthDidFinish is a magic string. Should be declared somewhere.
Not a priority. Refactor plain C functions to something more modern. Probably NSString category. Will be of use in Swift demo app.

It is a bug in their SDK, they even fixed it, but did not update their podspec. We can not use bleeding edge of their repo in our podspec due to cocoapods limitation, so we must stay on their podspec version.

Solution: wait until they update podspec.
Evernote created new repository to store SDK: [link](https://github.com/evernote/evernote-cloud-sdk-ios)
I'm trying to share with:
        [SHKiOSFacebook shareItem:item];

Sharing itself works, but it seems either Sharekit or Facebook is stripping the .title property. It seems to be removing everything but hash tags in the string. 

Facebook-iOS-SDK has been deprecated in favor of FBSDKCoreKit.

Facebook-iOS-SDK and FBSDKCoreKit are conflicting in the same project. So, there is not impossible to use sharing (via ShareKit) and Facebook authorization (via FBSDKCoreKit, FBSDKLoginKit) in one project.

It would be good to update ShareKit.

Thanks

Please, correct typo, if possible. Screenshot attached.
