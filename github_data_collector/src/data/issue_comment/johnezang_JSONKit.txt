I face a problem, if response json string contains some double value , then while got the NSDictionary , the value is not normal ...

example :
{
"int": 12,
"double": 67860.04,

}

then got the Dictionary that will be :

double = "67860.03999999999";

the filed 'double' value is not original data.....

how to fix it ?
