Using BaselineManagement to convert GPOs to PS for import into DSC configurations seems to convert the policy correctly, and specified the PowerShellAccessControl module to import into DSC.

Azure State Configuration doesn't have this module, and trying to import the module gives the error "Orchestrator.Shared.AsyncModuleImport.ModuleImportException: An error occurred during module validation."

The module won't import into powershell either.

Grabbing the V4 preview module fails with the error "Orchestrator.Shared.AsyncModuleImport.ModuleImportException: Cannot import the module of name PowerShellAccessControl_v4.0_preview_20150417, as the module structure was invalid."

Is there a version which can be imported and used, or would BaselineManagement need fundamental changes to allow GPOs converted to be imported as DSC configurations?

Thanks in advance.
These conversion tools are great, good work!
But why not provide the DSC Configurations by default, with pester tests?
         UserRightsAssignment 'UserRightsAssignment(INF): Allow_log_on_through_Remote_Desktop_Services'
         {
              Policy = 'Allow_log_on_through_Remote_Desktop_Services'
              Force = $True
              Identity = @('*S-1-5-32-544')

         }

There are currently three Pull requests dating back to January 2019 that are all failing their AppVeyor checks with the following error:

```
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

```

Affected pull requests: #23, #25 and #26

The build configuration isn't using an `appveyor.yml` file so I can't debug the issue.

Can someone take a look at this?

We are enforcing legal banners on servers so we set the following keys _(I changed the actual values to protect the innocent)_.

These are the values contained in the GPO backup (_.\{7C78F02A-DBCF-460D-8C0F-A7B5E8082F5B}\DomainSysvol\GPO\Machine\microsoft\windows nt\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf_)

**_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\LegalNoticeText=1,"'Legal mumbo jumbo.'"_**

**_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\LegalNoticeCaption=1,"'DONT HACK THIS STUFF BRO!'"_**

When I run `ConvertFrom-GPO` it throws an exception when it gets to these settings, due to the way they are double quoted and single quoted (`"'message'"`).

This is the exception.
```powershell
 PS>ConvertFrom-GPO -Path '.\GPObackups\sec_2016\{7C78F02A-DBCF-460D-8C0F-A7B5E8082F5B}\' -OutputPath .\2016\

I get two of these exceptions, when running through the debugger I can confirm it's on these two items. 

If I modify the lines in the GptTmpl.inf and replace the quotes with just single quotes, everything works prefect.  In the short term i'll look into getting our legal banner to not have the extra quotes, I'm sure that'll be fine, I wanted to report the issue in case other ran into it.

In this example it is wrapping the Arrays, is this expected behaviour?

Also a switch to use space indentation would be nice :)

The following code is applied successfully but with not result in a compliant state if additional groups are included in the user right assignment. 

src/Parsers/ASC/UserRightsAssignment.ps1
    if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($Accounts))
    {
        $policyHash.Force = $true;
    }    
    $policyHash.Policy = $Privilege;
    $policyHash.Identity = $Accounts 

**This will set the user rights as declared** 

   $policyHash.Force = $true;
    $policyHash.Policy = $Privilege;
    $policyHash.Identity = $Accounts

When will these be supported ?  Is there a roadmap somewhere.
running the following command 

`ConvertFrom-ASC -Path .\download\BaselineConfiguration.json`
