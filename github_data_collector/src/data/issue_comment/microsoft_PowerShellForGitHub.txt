I'm unsure of if you will accept PRs that only implement one part of the functionality. For example, for the Repository.Contents there is: Get, Create/Update, Delete, Get archive link

But I'm really only looking to implement the `Get` part. Is that ok for a phase 1 approach?

Please let me know what else needs to be considered, i haven't looked at the tests yet so I'm unsure if everything is tested or not.


We use a number of the functions within this file throughout the other UT's, but not all of them.  There is a lack of comprehensive testing available for all the methods within this file as was recently demonstrated with #134 and #136 (around `Update-GitHubRepository`).

We should close the gaps on the testing of the functions within this file to increase code coverage and reduce regression possibilities.
The helper function Wait-JobWithAnimation incorrectly handles progress, and this makes it look quite ugly indeed in the ISE (a spew of non-wrapped yellow lines).

The root of the problem is that you are creating your own Write-Progress.  Please use Write-Progress instead, as this is more standard and will be honored across more PowerShell hosts.

The issue reproduces everywhere, but is worst in the PowerShell ISE.

To detail the fix:
Create an ID before the while loop (Line 57)

Change your Write-InteractiveHost to Write-Progress (line 94)
        Write-Progress "$($animationFrames[$($iteration % $($animationFrames.Length))])" "Elapsed: $([int]($iteration / $framesPerSecond)) second(s)" -PercentComplete $((($iteration % $($animationFrames.Length)) / $animationFrames.Length) * 100) -id $id

Complete the Progress message at the end (lines 101 & 108)

Get rid of your Write-InteractiveHost at the very end
I wrote some PowerShell to publish a GitHub release recently ([here](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/blob/a7401961967f50f0de0dc64a82718b1ceb9d8ec5/tools/GitHubTools.psm1#L232-L328)) and was wondering if you would like it? It needs changing to work with the conventions of this module, of course, but with some guidance I can do that.

Let me know if you're interested. I haven't exposed any other GitHub Release API support, but could relatively easily.
Right now, in order for telemetry to work, 3 NuGet packages need to be downloaded (or cached):
 * Microsoft.ApplicationInsights (for Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.dll)
 * Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist (for Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.dll)
 * Microsoft.Bcl.Async (for Microsoft.Threading.Tasks.dll)

In the end, the telemetry events are just being sent as web requests.  While the web request format isn't documented, it should be possible to reverse-engineer via a tool like Fiddler.

If we can figure out how to make those web requests directly, then we can improve the first-run experience for users to not need to have that initial binary download.
* Tests for a few common scenarios
* Only Get and Create references implemented as of now as it is required for #84 
* PSScriptAnalyser Run returns no issues
This issue is created to implement the Git Data -> refs APIs from #70 
I will be initially concentrating on creation of branches as I need it for #84
Does not contain tests yet
Issue to track the implementation of the APIs for "merging" under the "Repository" section in #70 
API reference: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/merging/

I will update this issue with my proposals for the cmdlet names and parameters
Using a single issue to track the remaining work, so as not to litter the Issues and give the wrong impression on the current state of the project, bug wise.

If a contributor is interested in making progress towards any of these items, they should just create a new Issue to track that specific work, mention this Issue, and then resolve their PR against the Issue that they created.  At that point, I'll go ahead and update this list and check off that item.
