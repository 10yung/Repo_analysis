The first time PKG_CHECK_MODULES is called also checks for pkg-config.
If that first call is in an optional block then later calls to
PKG_CHECK_MODULES will fail.

See https://autotools.io/pkgconfig/pkg_check_modules.html
Section 3.4. Optional Modules

Test with:
This fails:
./autogen.sh --with-bash-completion-dir=/usr/share/bash-completion/completions --enable-selinux

This succeeds:
./autogen.sh --with-bash-completion-dir=yes --enable-selinux

This is a pure cleanup patch and should not affect anything. I was gonna use it for some other work which required yet another fd argument, but that fell through.
Applications that legitimately need network access might exploit servers listening on the local network (link-local, loopback, or private IP ranges), which often do not have any authentication, or have insufficient authentication. One example is the EC2 metadata API, which exposes secrets without authentication.

It would be very useful to block connections to these IPs entirely. One way I think is to set up a network namespace, a NAT-ed tunnel device and a set of iptables rules, but it might be simpler to use seccomp and block all IP addresses in the private range in the `connect()` syscall.

If I use `--lock-file` or `--sync-fd` without `--unshare-pid`, I get exit status 1 instead of the exit status of the wrapped command.

```
$ bwrap --ro-bind / / --lock-file /tmp/.ref --unshare-pid echo hello; echo $?
hello
0
$ bwrap --ro-bind / / --lock-file /tmp/.ref echo hello; echo $?              
hello
1
$ bwrap --ro-bind / / --lock-file /tmp/.ref sh -c 'exit 23'; echo $?
1
$ bwrap --ro-bind / / --lock-file /tmp/.ref --unshare-pid sh -c 'exit 23'; echo $?
23
```

Similarly,

```
$ bwrap --ro-bind / / --sync-fd 3 echo hello 3</tmp/.ref; echo $?
hello
1
```

There is no one successor to PAPR; Github has a powerful pluggable API for CI, and you can use multiple.

Fixes #329 

/dev/shm without bubblewrap has `1777` permissions and /dev/shm with bubblewrap has `0755` permissions. This fixes that so the permissions are the same.
This is a workaround for https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/issues/198

It checks if /proc/mounts contains anything related to `hidepid`.

I'm very new to C so sorry if there's anything wrong. It worked fine when testing.
So, I've been using bubblewrap to isolate environments and I've been using the "--dev" option to populate /dev in the mount namespace.
Unfortunately I can't enter the created namespaces with nsenter (as a normal user); I think this is related to the --dev-option binding stdout of the process to /dev/stdout. What are the considerations of this when comparing it to setting up a tmpfs and linking the relevant dev (null/random/...)?

Considerations are: terminal won't work ;).

This seems really weird. Removing all the code in the case-statement for "SETUP_MOUNT_DEV" also does not work.
