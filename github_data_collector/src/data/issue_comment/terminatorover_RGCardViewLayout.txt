`UICollectionView received layout attributes for a cell with an index path that does not exist`
this problem only occur in iOS8
later of iOS9 is ok
Hi,

I have experienced a crash on Ipad Pro, does anyone have that?

Is it possible to show next cell as preview (little bit)?

I have downloaded your code and in ViewController.m  added below code to autoscroll collection view to some index  on startup ( like national geographic city guide app )
but it is giving layout issue..View is tilting slightly. can you please tell me how do I get this effect?

                                    repeats:YES];
```

 }

-(void)targetMethod
{
    NSIndexPath *index = [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:0 inSection:sectionCountForCard];

```
if(sectionCountForCard<4)
{
    [self.collectionV scrollToItemAtIndexPath:index atScrollPosition:UICollectionViewScrollPositionRight animated:YES];

    sectionCountForCard++;

}
```

}

Do u konw what's the reason?

Hi, i've verified that when you slide (slowly) the appearing view  (on the right for example) flickers/blinks a bit before it animates smoothly. Can you fix this ? 

PS:  I don't know if I made myself clear, to test, slide very slowly and observe the sections views appearing ; UPDATE: actually, in your demo, I found that the issue is only observable in landscape mode. 

Running the latest code on iPhone 4,5 gives the following warnings:

the behavior of the UICollectionViewFlowLayout is not defined because
the item width must be less than the width of the UICollectionView minus the section insets left and right values.
