I think it's worth mentioning on this page that if you install a pull DP on a workstation OS, the ConfigMgr client will enable BITS with default settings even if the client settings are set to disable BITS.  This means the pull DP's transfers will be throttled regardless of any other settings.  To override this so the pull DP will, for example, use the max available bandwidth when pulling from a DP configured with LEDBAT, you need to set "Limit the maximum network bandwidth for BITS background transfers" to Disabled in GPO.

This is mentioned in a couple of forum threads e.g. https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/lync/en-US/03494089-23ed-419f-936f-a05e37c73c62/configuring-bits-throttling-on-sccm-clients-is-disabled-but-registry-values-change-back-after?forum=ConfigMgrCBGeneral but I don't see this called out in any official documentation, confirmed today this is still the case on ConfigMgr 1902 and Windows 10 1809.

The Example #2 is the most accurate and up-to-date guidance for hierarchies. A few other areas of the article need to be revised as well:

In performance and scale chapter:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/configmgr/core/clients/manage/cmg/plan-cloud-management-gateway#performance-and-scale
> “If possible, configure the CMG, CMG connection point, and the Configuration Manager site server in same network region to reduce latency”.

And in hierarchy design chapter:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/configmgr/core/clients/manage/cmg/plan-cloud-management-gateway#hierarchy-design
> “To reduce network latency, assign the associated CMG to the same geographical region as the primary site.”

Confirm that we will not have latency between a CMG Connection Point and a CMG service across different regions.

distmgr.log also looks helpful info when installing roles such as DP, shows connetion attempts and installation results of components. I'm not sure what wording _should_ be, but would you agree the description for distmgr.log should also include (somehow) a brief summary of that?

I was looking to find out whether updating the content on a distribution point on a schedule would actually ignore it if the source content did not change, or whether it would redistribute the content regardless of content change. To my surprise I did not find anything related to this option in the "Deploy and Manage Content" section of the docs.

Tested a lot and when PowerShell execution policy is configured to Allsigned it will timeout and fail as well not only for restricted.
