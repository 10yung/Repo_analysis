Hi,

We are currently testing Pencil and when doing the "Your first shape" part of the tutorial, it doesn't work.

When typing f5 after having loaded the Definition.xml copied from the example, it displays "null" as Collection name.

It appears that the first line `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` is causing the issue, without it, it works fine.

Hi,

I did not find an email contact so I write here in order to get in touch with you - pencil team. I'm the project leader of tracim - https://github.com/tracim/tracim/ a collaborative platform for teams.

I'm very interested in integrating pencil with tracim in order to help teams work on UI mockup and maybe offer to pencil collaboration features (commenting, versionning, etc).

I'd like to start a discussion with you about this project - maybe you are interested, maybe not - let's talk altogether about it.

We can talk here or by email if you'd prefer - bonjour at tracim dot fr

- I use it as a tool to generate layout
And then parse it as a file for other program

- Could it has a way from .epgz to .json or .xml

I have exported my file and saved it also afterward and then when I tried to reopen it. I found that it was corrupted as it turned into 0kb storage. Please help otherwise I have to start from scratch. I have attached my file. Please look into this or give any guidelines to follow for fixing this.

And the below-mentioned file is the file in the cache.

I found this because pencil always got stuck when opening a file or creating a new one. It looks like someone forgot to change this line a long time ago (6110fdbdc961767e584e9e64a82925c153221590).

I'm not exactly sure why, but after I changed it everything worked fine again, so I hope this makes pencil a bit more stable.
I'm trying to use Pencil for digital circuits block diagram: **there is no good free-software for this** at the moment, but besides that I think this is a feature useful for a lot of people.


Operating system:
Ubuntu 18.04 64bit

Pencil version:
3.1.0 - RC1

It would be nice to insert an arbitrary number of connector points (or glue points in the libre office draw lingo), this would enable diagrams like this (created with draw.io):

Strong grid snapping toggle would be neat. Connecting multiple arrows (signals) from one block to another would be fast: and even better if the labels comes along as described in issue #228

Searching for a shape in a collection doesn't works. It was working in previous version.

If I type, for example, "Account" into the search box, it does not find nothing... (and there are some shapes with that word in their name) Also if I "clear" the search box it doesn't show all the shapes of the collection again (as expected). To show all the shapes of the collection I need to select another collection first, then select the collection again.

When I deploy a silent install /S  in SCCM the application never puts a shortcut on the desktop or the start menu.

If I manually run it using the installer with /S it works fine. Is there another switch I am missing that will ensure the shortcuts are added?

Currently I need to be root (sudo) for installing and running Pencil.

This is true for both the deb / rpm (I guess... haven't tried) and the `setup.sh` (tries to put things in (`/opt` and `/usr/share`).

On top of it, I seem to need to to run `chrome-sandbox` as root, otherwise I get the error:

"The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755."

There are a few problems with that:

- Personally, I will not run as root any software (install script included) that I download from the internet.
- No software I download should touch `/usr/` (except, for  `/usr/local/`)
- I don't trust `.deb` packages that are not _good enough_ to be integrated in the Debian (or Ubuntu) repositories.

I have a Pencil 3.0 that runs from `~/bin/pencil/pencil`, with no special rights, it would be nice to have the same "comfort" for Pencil 3.1.

There are a few action you can take:

- get Pencil to be included in the Debian (and Ubuntu) repositories.
- make sure that Pencil does run as a _normal_ user from the user's home directory.
- provide an Appimage.
