Our IT consists of terminal sessions from clients on our local server. 
To be able to edit files on the server in a comfortable way we send the file to the client with scp, edit it locally with CotEditor sshing following command:
ssh -q mb@imac-mb.local -t '/Applications/CotEditor.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/cot --wait file.txt'
and then scp the file back on the server.

Normally this works perfect but in some cases and on some Laptops we get this error message:

File "/Applications/CotEditor.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/cot", line 411, in <module>
    main(args, stdin)
  File "/Applications/CotEditor.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/cot", line 330, in main
    app.open(path)
  File "/Applications/CotEditor.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/cot", line 161, in open
    self.tell('open POSIX file "{}"'.format(path), is_async=True)
  File "/Applications/CotEditor.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/cot", line 141, in tell
    raise error
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command 'ignoring application responses
tell app "/Applications/CotEditor.app" to open POSIX file "/Users/mb/e_tpc.kal"
end ignoring' returned non-zero exit status 1

With a large file (3,000+ lines), selecting a line to the right with shift+cmd+→ quickly highlights the line, but selecting a line to the left with shift+cmd+← has a delay.  The larger the file, the longer the delay in highlighting the line.

If I select a word with opt+shift+←, there is no delay.

It's really not efficient to run script by clicking "Scripts -> ScriptYouWannaRun" or rightclicking "Scripts -> ScriptYouWannaRun". If I need running a script high-frequently, it really annoys me since keybinding is not allowed to scripts.

Is there a way to bing keystokes in the Preferences to self defined scripts?
I'm using MacOS Catalina 10.15.1, CotEditor v3.8.5 (MAS).

It should be admitted that the `write to console` command is a great feature in v3.8.5, but it's so limited as to ...

## found

- The "timestamp and running script name" line
- The prefixed spaces each line following the "timestamp and running script name" line

is unnecessary and annoying.

problems:

- the line height: the space between lines too close.
- font ligated, text in the timestamp part is ligated or not monospaced as declared.
- font family, maybe monospaced as declared, but not same as the editor font I set in the preferences.
- cannot the prompted small console window to the most front

## expected

it would be better if cot

1. supports tabs in console window, such as `create new console window`, `create new console tab` commands
2. supports `clear console` command
3. adds options to turn off the "timestamp and running script name" line and the prefixed spaces
4. supports _text settings_, like font family, font size, line height, letter spacing, .... (better IF there will be "Console" tab in the Preferences )
5. supports being _attached_ to the main window, to the right, to the bottom
6. supports 


Currently, I must press option+esc(macos) to get the association.I wonder if you can add this feature, thx!

_FIrstly thanks for a great little editor._

Could you add a [save as] function?

In a typical workflow, we often incrementally make changes to existing files but need to keep the original unchanged (for testing, version control etc).

Currently, we have to copy and paste into a new document to save as a new file. Then have to remember the exact file-path and file-name of the source file to keep our filing system neat.

It would be great to have SAVE AS and have that offer up the current file path as the save location and the current filename (with string 'copy' or '2' appended before file extension).

If this feature has been asked and rejected before... I am sorry, but it is worth considering again ;-)

PHPにおいて、sting型変数として「#」が含まれていると、
該当する行がコメントアウトとして色が変わってしまう。

when i use "#"  as a string value at PHP,
its line is recognized for comment-out.

// #ffdede 以降がコメントアウトの色になってしまい、わかりづらい！
// it is stress because this line is recognized comment-out's color from #ffdede to EOL.

There should be an option to check spelling only on comments and strings (the spelling feature is useless for code as most of the code is underlined as misspellings).

As previously mentioned in #392, it would be great to be able to press tab for auto-completion (as in accordance with other editors, including Sublime Text).
