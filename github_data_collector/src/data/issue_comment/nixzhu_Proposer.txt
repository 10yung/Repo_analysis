Hi 

Xcode says UIUserNotificationSettings is deprecated in IOS 10. so now how can i use your library for notification permission?
should check status before request
Last version cannot be compiled with Swift 4.1 (Xcode 9.4.1).
```
Proposer.swift:38:69: error: binary operator '==' cannot be applied to operands of type '() -> AVAudioSessionRecordPermission' and '_'
            return AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().recordPermission == .undetermined
```
Maybe it would warrant a major version change?
As UIUserNotificationSettings will be deprecated to iOS 11, do you have plans on also use UNNotificationSettings with @available in order to support from iOS 8 to 11?
