@chicm-ms @liuzhe-lz This PR is not ready, still need to update.
Currently, I'm using Enas to search the network for my own dataset. Because my dataset is very large, it almost takes one night to search for only two epochs. So I wonder is it possible to search the model in a distributed way? Thanks a lot!
I want to train a object detection model, like yolo ssd fast rcnn, than use nni to do NAS on this model. Can I do this base on NNI?
see issue #1950
