everytime i switched on 3ds and it will be crushed when wifi connected about 10 seconds.
how to fix it?thanks
Hey, I'm new here and really just created an account to ask something.
I was in the "finalizing setup" section III of the Homebrew Launcher guide, and I'm having trouble opening the Rosalina menu, because my L button on the 3DS doesn't work. I was wondering if there is anyway to use another button except L? 
Thank you for all your hard work!

i have a 2ds xl. i dropped it about a year ago and the volume rocker split in half, so i cant controll the volume, its always off. the developers should make a feature where you can control the volume if the rocker stays still.

Not much else to say, other then I included the crash dump here.

Local multiplayer / download play seems to remains region locked. It'd be nice to be able to mix consoles from different regions per game without having to [hard-change the region of the whole console](https://3ds.hacks.guide/region-changing.html), with all it entails.

#240 was about this issue, but was closed until someone learned “more information about what region-free local multiplayer entails”.

PS: Before anyone suggests [Luma Locale Switcher](https://github.com/ericjwg/LumaLocaleSwitcher/releases) note that it does not work at all around the region lock of Local multiplayer / download play.
O3ds
Luma 10.0.1
boot9strap 1.3
Please fix this issue, the screenshot its not working on rosalina menu

Please add the option to turn off the bottom screen with a button combination. This would make playing emulators in dark environments possible for me due too my eye condition and maybe more pleasant for some people plus it saves batterylife.
The BPS format allows distributing patches that are smaller and that do
not contain copyrighted content if data is relocated
(unlike non-trivial IPS patches).

This is essential for games such as Majora's Mask 3D that have three
barely different code revisions. Supporting all three versions would
demand an unreasonable amount of work; with BPS patches only one
version has to be supported.

The patcher is written in C++ in order to make it possible to share the
implementation with Citra and because a C version would be a lot more
ugly and tedious to write. The patcher is non-intrusive for the rest of
the codebase and self-contained so hopefully that isn't an issue.

This adds roughly ~0x500 bytes of code to the loader sysmodule.
Code looks reasonably optimised (in IDA). Tested and works on an o3DS.
