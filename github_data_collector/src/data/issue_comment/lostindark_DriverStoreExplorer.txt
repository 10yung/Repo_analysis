Hello, using RAPR since long time now and I always wished to be able to export drivers (to a selected  folder) from the application. Maybe I miss point exporting all drivers as a CSV list, but personally, I find this useless. Exporting drivers would be nicer imho.

I have to use powershell for that...Dism /online /export-driver /destination:"mypath"

Would be even better to be able to "export selected drivers" (and not export ALL like in export csv) 

Thank you

ps: for reference, I grabbed the dism command from there: 
https://www.thewindowsclub.com/backup-restore-drivers-windows-10

Command line support would be very useful, especially an option to delete/move all old drivers automatically.
RAPR finished its process in 2-3 seconds, 14 GB of data freed from the folder, but the free space on the disk has not changed. 
Windows now reports 403 GB of used space.
TreeSize says there is 417 GB of used space.
I have cleaned the Recycle Bin, but I canâ€™t figure out where those 14 GB go.
I have disabled the system recovery, no hibernation is enabled.
Thanks!
