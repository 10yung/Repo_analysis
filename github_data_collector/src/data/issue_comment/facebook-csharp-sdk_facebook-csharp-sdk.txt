To handle HttpMethod "DELETE" and avoid getting System.UriFormatException: Invalid URI: The Uri string is too long
I am trying to retrieve a post picture, and it comes null. How can I solve it

//Controller method code
private List<Post> GetPosts()
        {
            string acess_token = "EAAGzXjFVBr8BAKZAI6iQ9k1JdJkR8ZBAsggBq9NHZBDIvbltHJOinPo0a5RUgag5ZA2tw3ZAEY8LcJI6NMS4G6jgg9V4UDTRyPHSOxFeLZA2XqTWBZC8Pt1lIbPZBg262txhn6yV3odkLtVU8TCkeomq7nJukSfSjSqm6LAdtZBO2lAZDZD";
            const string urlPosts = "https://graph.facebook.com/v3.2/161800620558690/posts";

            FacebookClient client = new FacebookClient(acess_token);
            
            dynamic result = client.Get(String.Format(urlPosts) + "?fields=message,link,full_picture");

            List<Post> postsFB = new List<Post>();

            for(int i = 0; i < result.data.Count; i++)
            {
                Post post = new Post();

                post.PostId = result.data[i].id;

                if (object.ReferenceEquals(result.data[i].story, null))
                    post.PostStory = "";
                else
                    post.PostStory = result.data[i].story;
                if (object.ReferenceEquals(result.data[i].message, null))
                    post.PostMessage = "Datelka - Engenharia e Sistemas Lda";
                else
                    post.PostMessage = result.data[i].message;

                post.PostPicture = result.data[i].fullpicture;
                post.UserId = result.data[i].id;
                post.UserName = result.data[i].name;
                
                postsFB.Add(post);
            }

            return postsFB;
        }

I occasionally get this exception when using the FacebookClient's Delete method seemingly with a large payload, but i didn't think the payload would affect the URI string. Any tips on how to debug this?
I have tried to integrate the facebook in my application using "Facebook".dll. Created the facebook client instance and pass the accesstoken as the parameter. then i have called the method "Get" and pass the request as "facebookpageid"/posts?fields=id,message,picture,full_picture,created_time&limit=3". but got the exception like "**Unknown Facebook response**" and inner exception as "**Null**"

sample code:-

var client = new FacebookClient(accesstoken); //passed the accesstoken 
**dynamic result = client.Get(pageid+"/posts?fields=id,message,picture,full_picture,created_time&limit=3");** 

I got the issue in the second line. kindly guide me what i missed in the above code.
Hi,

As facebook sent a notice that it will deprecate "publish_actions" permissions from Aug1, 2018 can we still us this SDK?

Please give your inputs on this.

Thanks.
I've downloaded latest version but when checking in vs it shows assembly version to 6.0.10.

Hi,

We have received a notification from facebook on our app developer page that you are using Graph v2.5 API which needs to be upgraded to v2.6 or higher. 

We are using facebook nuget package 7.0.6 version in our app for fb login. Can you please let us know on what graph API version we are? 

Actually, our IOS, Android and windows all 3 are using same fb app to login, so not sure for what platform it is giving us that alert. 

Let us know more info is required from our side.
I'm getting this error while trying to upload video on the page:

(OAuthException - #1) An unknown error has occurred.

` var fb = new FacebookClient(pageAccessToken);
                                string attachementPath = filePath;
                                using (var file = new FacebookMediaStream
                                {
                                    ContentType = "video/*",
                                    FileName = Path.GetFileName(attachementPath)
                                }.SetValue(File.OpenRead(attachementPath)))
                                {
                                    var isim = file.FileName;
                                    dynamic result = fb.Post("/"+ pageid + "/videos",
                                    new { title = PaylasimIcerik,   description = PaylasimIcerik,source= file });
                                  
                                }`
The link to the documentation at the top of the repository points to http://facebooksdk.net which redirects me to http://hackerapp.com and asks me to download a file after completing a survey (doesn't seem very legitimate). 

The readme.txt in the installed package points to http://csharpsdk.org which is a homework help site for statistics student?

Could this be fixed to just point to the correct documentation link.
Some of the customers faced this issue and couldn't able to login. I have checked related articles and i couldn't able to finalize the fix.

First of all i can't able to reproduce it in local development environment. Getting this error in production that also from customer usage.

First i need to know the proper steps to reproduce this issue. Then only i can able to confirm my fix also from my end.

I am using facebook client class to get facebook redirection and redirection after login.

Please find the code samples below:

```
***Redirecting to facebook***

 redirecturl = new FacebookClient().GetLoginUrl(new
                {
                    client_id = "clientidhere",
                    client_secret = "clientsecretkeyhere",
                    redirect_uri = "redirectionurlhere",
                    response_type = "code",
                    scope = "email"
                }).AbsoluteUri;


  ***After redirection from facebook***

   dynamic result = fb.Post("oauth/access_token", new { client_id = "clientidhere", client_secret = "clientsecrethere", redirect_uri = "redirecturl", code = security Response Code which we got from facebook in callback url});

  fb.AccessToken = result.access_token;
  dynamic me = fb.Get("me?fields=email,first_name");
```


Please help me to resolve this problem. This call back url will be called once after successful login of facebook. So please let me know reproducing steps as well as solution.

Thanks in advance.
