After having forked this repository, the project does not compile.
Indeed errors about old Swift 3.0 version in use raise, making the build fail.
Versions of dependencies of Carthage file has been increased to make to project compilable and compatible to Swift 4.2

Note that compatibility to Swfit 5+ implies some refactoring.

This restores functionality that was previously provided by [cocoapods-acknowledgements](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-acknowledgements) (CocoaPods was removed in https://github.com/thoughtbot/Tropos/pull/224).

The two main parts of this are the `generate-acknowledgements` command line tool, written as a small Swift program, and a new `AcknowledgementsViewController`.


I think this was previously working with HockeyApp, but since #224 uploading symbols has to be done manually. We should fix this.
The Tropos app appears to indicate a slight chance of rain 365 days a year, even when other weather forecasts are calling for 99% chance of rain. I am located in Canada. 

Various strings are unused in the translations and we should remove them to prevent confusion / unnecessary work. Thanks to @tomkowz for bringing these up.

The problem with a `lazy var` is you can overwrite it:

https://github.com/thoughtbot/Tropos/blob/877990cc0c96c96fd88d8e655bafac7b70c18bb3/Tropos/Models/Temperature.swift#L19-L21

``` swift
let temp = Temperature(fahrenheitValue: 20)
temp.celsiusValue = 20
```

The math isn't particularly expensive, so using a computed variable is probably good enough. If we really want to lazily load the celsius value, we can do so with a `private lazy var`, which the computed variable calls/returns.

Hey guys! 

The app looks nice, it's very simple but looks gorgeous. I like such simple design ;) I found the repo via [Open Sourcing Tropos, Our iOS Weather App](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/open-sourcing-tropos). Gordon wrote about moving app to Swift. It means that new classes, etc. should be created in Swift or we can also play and rewrite existing classes in Swift?

Thanks!

Does the Forecast API work in countries? I've been reading that 75%+ of many app's sales are outside of the US.

What is Tropos' current metadata? Could we have multi-lingual speakers at thoughtbot translate them for us? /cc @conchan @tute @paulcsmith @devonharless @halogenandtoast @calleerlandsson @bernerdschaefer @kaishin @gylaz.

I think we have coverage for:
- Spanish
- Chinese
- Japanese
- Swedish
- German
- Russian
