Thank you for sharing your nice work!

I would like to use your implementation in my research but it is essential for my purposes to train the model myself. Is there training code with instructions available?

Thank you :)
In the TCDCN paper, the filter weights are not spatially shared. I want to implement the network in caffe, but caffe seems to not support the locally shared or unshared weights. Can you share your implement details of this part? And, which deep learning toolbox do you use?
