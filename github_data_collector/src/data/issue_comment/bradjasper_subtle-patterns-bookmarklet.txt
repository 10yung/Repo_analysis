AWESOME tool, just doesn't work with the PageLines DMS theme, which I use.

It's free at http://www.pagelines.com/ (or at https://github.com/pagelines/DMS )

Thanks.

I've been using the bookmarklet for a while, but today when I tried it out it wasn't working properly. It turns out that some of the CSS on the site (specifically a height and width set on anchor tags) was bleeding on to the bookmarklet styles. Perhaps the CSS for the bookmarklet should  set/reset some more properties?

The select box is way too long.

Use http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/ or http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/ or something.
