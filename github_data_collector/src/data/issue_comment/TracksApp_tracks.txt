One of the Rails upgrades changed the way we handle static files with the built in server. Instead of using the value in `config/site.yml`, Tracks now requires the following environment variable to be set `RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES`

At this point, I think I'd rather follow the Rails default, so we need to update the documentation and remove the setting from `config/site.yml.tmpl` so that it's no longer misleading for our users.


DB field "todos.description" was type string, which
defaults to length 255 in MySQL. Model allows field
to be up to 300 characters, which could cause a DB
error, if user saved a description of between 255
and 300 characters.

Fixes #2274

with <code>match_when_negated</code> blocks. (Jon Rowe, <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/issues/1130">#1130</a>)</li>
<li>Add a warning when an empty diff is produce due to identical inspect output.

I'm going through setting up the application on a Heroku dyno right now and want to capture some random notes and things that can be used to update the installation instructions for the app  now that the new release is out.

- A `.skip-docker` file absolutely must be present in the repo you push to Heroku
- `BUNDLE_WITHOUT` should be specified as a config variable in the app and should exclude the `sqlite` group, or Heroku will complain at you. `heroku config:set BUNDLE_WITHOUT="development:test:sqlite"` from the comand line should do the job nicely.

More to come as I work through setting this up.

Hi,

Discovered the following issue when analyzing the tracks app as part of a research project. The field `description` in the object `todos` is limited to max length 300 in the model, but 255 in DB. So if a user creates a description greater than 255 but less than 300, it seems they may encounter a problem.

Model validation:
```
class Todo < ApplicationRecord

  MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH = 300
  ...
  validates_presence_of :description
  validates_length_of :description, :maximum => MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH
  ...
```

DB field, which defaults to 255 for string fields in mysql:
```
MariaDB [tracks]> describe todos;
+-------------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field             | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+-------------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id                | bigint(20)   | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
...
| description       | varchar(255) | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
```

I think the best solution may be to limit the length in the model to 255 (and shouldn't create any  conflicts since the field cannot be greater than length 255 in MySQL). Assuming you agree this is an issue, I can create a pull request if that is helpful. Thanks.
