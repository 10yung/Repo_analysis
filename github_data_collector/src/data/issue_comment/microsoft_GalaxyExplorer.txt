It would be nice to have a few more folders especially in the Scripts folder to find things faster. At the moment utility scripts are in the same folder as visual-effect scripts for example.

Not a bug, but would be nice.
Really amazing project by the way! I learned a lot. Thank you for sharing it.
Plus minor fixes (proposal)
Does anyone know when (year) that the solar system begins in the animation?
- Route touch/gesture/input events from desktop/slate/phone to the application\
- Implement equivalent of the app-bar menu for Reset and About
- Ensure the back-button affordance is still available.

After zooming and/or tiling my view of our solar system, and then transitioning/clicking to a planet view or galaxy view, and then coming back to the solar system view, the zoom and tilt has been reset.

Customizing any view and browsing away and then returing causes the view to reset...
We should add [Spectator View](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/spectator_view) to Galaxy Explorer.
Instead of having each contributor narrate, it might be better to have a single default narrator, preferably Cortana

Since I don't have a HoloLens unit yet.  But thinking that UWP apps should work across Windows 10.  Would it be a lot of work to convert GalaxyExplorer to XB1?

Has anyone given this a shot?
