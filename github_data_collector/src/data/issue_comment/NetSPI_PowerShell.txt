Added Get-EnumSkype function to enumerate all users Lync/Skype can see
for the currently logged in domain, via ContactManager.BeginSearch.
Output writes to console and file.

Merged/forward-ported from code written by coworkers against a previous
NetSPI/PowerShell head.
Use two parameter sets so that the function accepts a domain OR an email.
