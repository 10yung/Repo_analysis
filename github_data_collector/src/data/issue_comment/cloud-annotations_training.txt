I want to be able to command click things

Viable production endpoints:
```
['https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com','https://eu-gb.ml.cloud.ibm.com','https://eu-de.ml.cloud.ibm.com','https://jp-tok.ml.cloud.ibm.com','https://ibm-watson-ml.mybluemix.net','https://ibm-watson-ml.eu-gb.bluemix.net']
```
Add an optional region param so the bucket doesn't need to be verified against a bucket list (can't get a region if the bucket isn't listed)


✅ Allow modifying boxes
✅ Allow drawing a new box
⏹ add a previous button
⏹ highlight all auto predicted boxes when hovering label all
⏹ add accept button to the box itself
⏹ Add keyboard shortcuts
`docs.annotations.ai` -> `cloud.annotations.ai/docs`
The `All labels` dropdown looks bad on some browsers and has issues with not re-rending when switching back and forth from dark mode.

We should use a custom style to stay consistent across browser/ os
Recreate steps:
- upload a file that is not a properly encoded JPG/PNG image to a COS bucket
- In cloud annotations select the bucket and annotation type "localization"

Result:
- A generic file icon is displayed in the carousel but no error is displayed.
- One can draw a bounding box in the editor

Expected result:
- The user is notified that one or more objects in the bucket are not of the support type.
- The user can somehow identifye which objects are problematic.
- The use cannot annotate the objects in the editor.
