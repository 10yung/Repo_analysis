Fix help message for argument **--proxies** 
There is how to save the metadata information separately from each file? Not all information in a single json file?
Is it possible to add the ability to limit to scraping between location and tag? Having the location be a checked before downloading the media would be one way, but this may make the process slower due to the asynchronous nature of the program. 
I just want to download meta-data to analyze the information posted by Instagram users. At the moment, it takes too much time, because you have to share images and videos. Next time, you only need to download meta-data.
Is it possible to add a "likes" argument so the program will only scrape content that has been liked by the logged-in user?
This is more a question than an issue. Although I've been doing some tests, I couldn't understand if the use of --latest-stamps implies that the destination directory is always emptied in every new query?
In the **OPTIONS** section in the readme, the --latest-stamps description specifies:

> This allows the destination directories to be emptied whilst
> still maintaining history.

I am willing to do one query per hashtag per day during a week. Every query should add only the new media in the destination directory and the new metadata should be added to the file `hashtag.json`. The query I am using is the following:

`instagram-scraper myhashtag --tag --include-location --media-metadata --profile-metadata --comments  --cookiejar cookies.txt --latest --latest-stamps timestamps.txt`

Thanks for any help!
I'm not sure what this error is or why I'm getting it. The login information I provided works as I used it to login into my IG account after trying to run this script. What isn't working here?
When trying to download a private profile, its giving error to verify account and cancels download immediately. I am following that account which I am trying to download.
