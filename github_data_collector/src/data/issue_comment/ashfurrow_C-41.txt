我好像没弄明白这个软件的功能，能不能介绍一下软件的业务逻辑？


Broken apparently. 

Hi, thanks for the project, I'm trying to wrap my head around using MVVM with iOS and I'm failing to properly understand transitioning between different Views in the MVVM sense. Aren't you breaking the MVVM pattern by allowing a `UIViewController` to initialize and present another `UIViewController`? For example in `didSelectRowAtIndexPath:` in `ASHMasterViewController`. Aren't different Views in the MVVM pattern completely separate with no knowledge of each other, as explained in [this article](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/278901/MVVM-Pattern-Made-Simple), specifically with this diagram:
