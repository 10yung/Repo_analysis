fix for my issue, [tfenv installation causes trouble. #6](https://github.com/anyenv/anyenv-install/issues/6)
## Overview
This PR is just working around for tfenv.

I got the messages below when I executed `anyenv init -`.
```console
> anyenv init -
== I ommited these parts ==
export TFENV_ROOT="/home/mopp/.anyenv/envs/tfenv"
export PATH="/home/mopp/.anyenv/envs/tfenv/bin:$PATH"
no such command 'init'
Usage: tfenv <command> [<options>]

Commands:
   install       Install a specific version of Terraform
   use           Switch a version to use
   uninstall     Uninstall a specific version of Terraform
   list          List all installed versions
   list-remote   List all installable versions
```

anyenv tried to call `*env init` during initialization. However tfenv does not have `init` subcommand.
