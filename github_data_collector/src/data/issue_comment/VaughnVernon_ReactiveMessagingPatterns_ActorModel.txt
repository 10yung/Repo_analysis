Hi, this line : `scalaSource in Compile <<= (baseDirectory in Compile)(_ / "src")`  in build.sbt doesn't work now because the '<<=' operator has been deprecated, I used the  `:=` to substitute, and this works: `scalaSource in Compile := (baseDirectory in Compile)(_ / "src").value` .Here is the reference: http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Migrating-from-sbt-012x.html
This shall help watching source code with IntelliJ IDEA.
This shall help in getting these design pattern samples work in Scala+Maven environment.
