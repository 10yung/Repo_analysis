Hi,

First of all, TY for your work, i love your tool !

Can we implement plowshare's capability to restart a plowdown when the command stop:

> I'm using plowshare from SSH, behind a screen session. But sometimes, i want to stop the plowdown tasks because of internet speed.
> I wanted to stop the plowdown cli (CTRL+C or somethings) but to have the ability to restart it after, and **not from the beginning of the file**

Regards,

Hi,
I encounter a problem downloading files from uptobox on geexbox(cubox-i) OS. I tried several files and I always have this error "remote filename has no length". I tried the same files with the same plowdown script files on Ubuntu and the download is ok.
I don't know if the missing recode command could be the pb (optional in the documentation).
This command is not available on geexbox.
I have enough space on the disk to download the files.

Here is a trace :

New hosters are increasingly using NoCaptcha, and existing hosters using ReCaptcha are advised to upgrade. Any work being done on support for these captchas? I'm prototyping using --captchaprogram with the extra variables been passed by Plowdown as environment variables. (For instance, this is how Anti-Captcha works with NoCaptcha: https://anticaptcha.atlassian.net/wiki/display/API/Documentation+in+English). 

It would be nice to have an option/flag that would take a command (e.g. a gpg command) to run and use the output as a password. This way the account password wouldn't show up in the process listing or in the shell history file. Since there are already two different options (-a and -b) for giving account information, it might be better to have a different syntax to specify that the password part is a command and not a string instead of adding 2+ extra options. Another possibility would be to only be able to specify a password command in the config file.
