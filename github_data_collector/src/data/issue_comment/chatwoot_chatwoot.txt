Reference #287 
**Is your enhancement request related to a problem? Please describe.**
As an agent, I might need some internal help to resolve an issue. I should be able to tag another agent in a private note. Once the tagging is done, a mail should be sent to the corresponding agent providing the details about the conversation.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Use `+` or `@` to tag a person. Show the list of available agents. Send an email to the agent tagged in the conversation.

Whenever a contact is updated, or the user has provided an email through email collect hooks, the dashboard is not updated momentarily.

Add an update event for contact, listen for the event in frontend and update the vuex store.

Add a feature to resolve the conversation after `n` days of inactivity. If I'm waiting for a response from the customer and he has not responded in `n` days, the conversation needs to resolved automatically.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Add a setting in account `auto_resolve_duration` which can be set by an admin, if there is no message or any activity happening in that duration, mark the conversation as resolved.

1. Go to 'Conversations'
2. Click on a conversation
3. Click on resolve
4. The count of conversations is not updated.

The count of conversation needs to be updated after every action.
