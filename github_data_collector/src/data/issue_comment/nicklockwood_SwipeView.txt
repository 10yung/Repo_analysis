Hi,

Swipe doesn't work on iOS 13.2 
Any idea how to fix?
Hey, I dont know is there any one pod like this one with swift support. Thank you.
Is there a way to not have the scroll view animate? I'd like it to transition to the next image at a specified duration, without the animation. Basically, I would like it to animate similar to this Android library:

I'd like to setup the SwipeCell with some insets, so I would be able to change where the content should begin. Is it possible with the current API? 
I get the follow project warning for Xcode 9.

Many people depend on this software. Please find a couple people that have made positive contributions to the project and give them commit access. Then define the scope of this project so they execute your vision correctly. Then good things will happen. 
Hi,

I am using your library and i have encountered i strange behaviour. When i push a view controller that contains a swipe swipeView as soon as try to populate my list of views inside the swipeView in get an exception in method setFrameForView (line 522). center.x has NaN value. It only works if i populate my list at the viewDidAppear. Not on viewDidLoad or any other method before viewDidAppear.

The error is not happening when i present modally the viewController.

Thank you
Jimmy
Whenever I try to swipe, tap event is fired. No matter I return true of false from `shouldSelectItemAtIndex `.
I added Carthage support by creating XCode framework project.
Also mentioned Carthage support in the readme.
