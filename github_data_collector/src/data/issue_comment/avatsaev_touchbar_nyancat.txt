There are few issues actually, but the main one, is that I can't quit the app:
1) Need to forcefully quit app through activity monitor
2) there is no mute button (only white screen)
3) and the app is missing icon.
Use the Github releases to distribute the file, rather than distributing it via Dropbox
Animation can be moved freely and doesn't stick to the touchbar borders. Please add some sticking to borders and/or complete bloking of the movement
When I try to run the app in Mojave Version 10.14.2, the app crashes immediately upon opening. The crash report contains the following information:

`Crashing on exception: The window has been marked as needing another Layout Window pass, but it has already had more Layout Window passes than there are views in the window.`

Here's a screenshot of the app running on MacBook Pro 2016, running macOS Sierra (10.12.2).
Please help.
After downloading, it is two folders and one md file. How can I use it?
After downloading and extracting the .zip i find myself with the nyan-app without icon and running it the app window has nothing but a blue background in it (see images).

Running macOS Sierra 10.12.6
The program starts, the music plays, but the Touch Bar doesn't display anything.

My Touch Bar fells useless now.
Gif Y position seems to be off so animation is partially cut off.

Error:
touchbar_nyancat[10569:539899] Warning: Expected min height of view: (<NSView: 0x7fcaa8c356d0>) to be less than or equal to 30 but got a height of 38.000000. This error will be logged once per view in violation.

It may be worth noting that I have SetResX to set my screen to the native resolution of 2880x1800.
I left the song playing while i contemplated my life and where it is going when the music stopped. After the initial little piano, it should be infinitely looped, so that i can continue to think about the meaning of life instead of working.

Thank you for your understanding.
