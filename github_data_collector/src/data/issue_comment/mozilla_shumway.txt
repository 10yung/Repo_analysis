Please run `git commit --allow-empty -m '[Project] Shumway'` and push the resulting commit.

Don't think about it, just do it.
The following code adds `handler` two times:

```ts
d.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, handler);
d.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, handler2);
d.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, handler);
```
Fixes #2451

Hi, I've made my portfolio site in Flash some time ago (using AS2).
Of course, now it's not working.
What should I do to make it work now? Do I have to convert it to HTML5?
How does your player works? Is it using some scripting to play normal regular SWF, or I have to convert SWF to something?

Please excuse my fairly illogical question, I don't know too much about programming.

Just in case if someone copies shape hitTest from the project - it leads to artifacts on my swf-s. Here is fixed version.

Left-to-right:

1. Shape
2. Shumway hitmap 
3. Corner cases (t=0, t=1, t1=t2) fix
3. `if (a!==0)` fix, helps with curves that have `cpY` as an average of `fromY` and `toY`
Dear specialists,

Why It is not possible to add this perfect addon to Firefox for Android? When I type directly The address to download .xpy addon, Firefox prompt Me to unblock installing this addon, when I allow that, installation is not successful. There is no error message, but addon simply do not install. How complex would be to make this addon compatible with Android release of Firefox? Old Flash player from Adobe is no longer supported by Firefox for Android. And there are still pages which relay on .swf files and many WEBINAR systems. Or do I ave to use some special Firefox tweak so Firefox will accept installing of this addon also for its Android variant of Firefox?
Thank you very much for yours answers.

When installing the extension into Firefox from 
http://mozilla.github.io/shumway/extension/firefox/shumway.xpi
Get error: Shumway could not be installed because it is not compatible with Firefox 59.0.3.

Is there any chance that some working on Shumway could compile a new extension so people can easily test and report bugs?
I think that there is an issue with `readFloat16`, it uses big endian representation for the underlying bytes instead of little endian.
This is only used for font alignment zone data parsing (which Shumway does not seem to support).

The endianness is not specified, but:
- Float32 and Float64 are little-endian
- When testing font alignment parsing zone data parsing on multiple files, little-endian seems to produce better values (between 0.1 and 3) while big-endian returns odd values or even NaN.

https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/blob/16451d8836fa85f4b16eeda8b4bda2fa9e2b22b0/src/swf/stream.ts#L132
(the `littleEndian` should be `true` instead of `false`)
Depends on #2434
