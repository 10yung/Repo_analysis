It's time to update the project description. People should be able to jump into Gitter room, once they would find out about the project.
A PostBuildEvent ran on Mono when it shouldn't, probably some merge mistake.
Also updated the list of libraries that are passed to the compiler.

With this fix I can build with Mono 6.0 on macOS using `msbuild /restore build.proj /p:Runtime=Mono`
