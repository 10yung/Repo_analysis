How do you encode RGB frames?
I am studying about FFmpeg + OpenH264 for Android Application. 
I found that there is Rate-Control feature in Encoder part of OpenH264 ("Rate control with adaptive quantization, or constant quantization") so I would like to understand how to use it.

If anyone has experiments of using this function in Android application please give me an example code with many thanks.

Thread decoding deblocking update by setting pNzc array for neighboring MBs.
The issues seem to be reproduced on Linux 32-bit build.

We're seeing crashes in the OpenH264 decoder when relying on the main profile support to play back H.264 videos from the internet. Although we're not sure which commit has fixed this, these crashes are no longer reproducible in master. Would it be possible to consider doing a new source and binary release soon so that users can start benefiting from these fixes?

Hi,

I'm developing a video editing android app which should be able to run on android devices and Chromebooks. As far as I know, some Chromebooks use Intel processor and others use ARM processor.

So to build my android .apk, I need to include openh264.so for x86_64 as well. Can anyone help to add android openh264.so for chip Intel on the [release](https://github.com/cisco/openh264/releases/tag/v2.0.0) page?

Thank you
