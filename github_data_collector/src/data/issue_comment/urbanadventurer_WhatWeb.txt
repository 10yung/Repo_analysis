Hi, I am using --log-json option and the file shows an empty object in array report.

**Usage**
**Version:** 0.5.1
```
#whatweb https://example.com --log-json=report.json
#cat report.json
[
{"target":"https://example.com","http_status":200,"request_config":{"headers":{"User-Agent":"WhatWeb/0.5.1"}},"plugins":{"HttpOnly":{"string":["__cfduid"]},"Country":{"string":["UNITED STATES"],"module":["US"]},"Cookies":{"string":["__cfduid"]},"Title":{"string":["Example website"]},"HTML5":{},"IP":{"string":["x.x.x.x."]},"HTTPServer":{"string":["cloudflare"]},"CloudFlare":{},"UncommonHeaders":{"string":["x-served-by,x-cache-hits,x-timer,cf-cache-status,expect-ct,cf-ray"]},"Strict-Transport-Security":{"string":["max-age=31556926"]},"Script":{"string":["acdcde2-text/javascript"]}}},
{}
]
```

**Issue:**
version: 0.4.9
os: parrot
description: `whatweb --log-json` write an open square brackets **" [ "**  in json output file if the input file ( -i ) does not contains targets.

**Use case:** 
Running a custom script you may need to pass an output file containing a list of websites to whatweb.

**Workaround**
For sure this issue should be handled by developers who uses whatweb.

**Example:**
<pre>
root@parrot:/tmp# cat websites.txt  # empty file
root@parrot:/tmp# <b>whatweb --log-json=testwhatweb.json -i websites.txt 
No targets selected
root@parrot:/tmp# cat testwhatweb.json </b>
<b>[</b>
root@parrot:/tmp# 
</pre>


Hi,

thanks for WhatWeb!

The plugin could need an update. Latest supported here is 8.4.0. That was in 2016:, see https://get.typo3.org/json or https://typo3.org/cms/release-news/ .

Any plans for this?

Cheers, Dirk




Hello, im using this for extracting some specific data e.g. Country, IP, PHP.. 

So the command I use is: `whatweb -p Country,PHP -i domains.txt` 

In file domains.txt are for example 10 domains (have just in format domain.com without protocol etc). But the result I get is 25-35 lines with all variations:
http://domain.com [301 Moved Permanently]
http://www.domain.com [301 Moved Permanently]
https://www.domain.com [200 OK] Country, IP.... - need just relevant lines, in best case just lines containing at leas one data from selected plugin.

2 - i was looking for some information about SSL certificate - but -p SSL-Certificate returns nothing
2a - nice will be also information about SSL like YES/NO/mixed

3 - nameserver - did not found in plugins, but this will be great to have - for better domains grouping per webhosting (yes, some of webhosting are really bad)

4 - connection timeout - ping time to domain/server

(sorry for more issues/ideas in one post)

Thanks
This is for accepting cookies from the website during redirections. The `--update-cookies` option is added to determine whether whatweb shoud use dynamic cookies.

I have recently encountered a case that a website uses SSO and there are serval redirections before getting to the final target. Which means that, in addition to specify the basic cookie using `--cookie` and `--follow-redirect`, the client need accept and update cookies from response, and follow serval redirection to complete the authorization.
The Discussion page [1] mentions SSL Certificate Support as one of discussed authentication methods. However it does not show up on the TODO [2] page which should list the not yet implemented features. I also cannot find a flag to configure it.

Is there any information about the state of this feature?

[2] https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb/wiki/To-Do
https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/v1/getting-started

Often, there is a ```.well-known/assetlinks.json``` file located within webroot. That file can be used to discover an additional information which is not available from the front page:
```
- Website A declares that links to its site should open in a designated app on mobile devices, if the app is  installed.
- Website A declares that it can share its Chrome user credentials with website B so that the user won't have to log in to website B if it is logged into website A.
- App A declares that it can share device settings, such as location, with website B.
```

I was wondering if you could add it for fingerprinting

Update: Here is the full list of files which may be in the ".well-known" directory:

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785


I use these two platforms, and I can not installed it on my PC/MAC. 
So how can I install it? Thank you.
Hello,

I see no module for the detection of Spring DATA Framework
https://projects.spring.io/spring-data/

or for the Spring DATA REST Framework
https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-rest/

I would be nice to have a detection module :)

Note: Sorry for adding this as an issue, but I saw no other way.
Hi @urbanadventurer and @bcoles would you be interested in signing up for some CI (for example Travis, no affiliation I just like to use CI), it's free for open source projects.

Maybe little badge with the result of running the unit and integration tests?
Eg:
[![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/andrericardo/WhatWeb.svg?branch=0.5.0-dev)](https://travis-ci.org/andrericardo/WhatWeb/)

Travis integrates with GitHub so that when an issue is mentioned it runs with the result.

I have also experimented with scrutinizer-ci.com, more oriented towards code metrics/potential issues, etc.. 
The code quality in WhatWeb was marked as good üëç
