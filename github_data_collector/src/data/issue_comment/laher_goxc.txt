Just ran

	gofmt -w .

on the project root. That's all.

Hey there-
@18F are big users of this tool. We distribute our binaries via GitHub releases, so the uploading part is a very useful for us. As you say in the README,

> Ever since Go1.5 supported simple cross-compilation, this tool lost much of its value. There are still many aspects of goxc which I'm very proud of, and some packaging features in particular, which are still useful.

I'm wondering if you would consider (a pull request for) taking out the low-level cross-compilation bits, possibly even delegating to a more specific tool like [gox](https://github.com/mitchellh/gox) for the higher-level ones, and making goxc focus on everything above that? Thanks!
Hi there!

We had to cut a custom build off a branch. (The reason it can't be master was because we had to cherry pick commits for this custom feature set that were incompatible w master).

Using goxc to build worked in every way ... except that the tag it created was pointed at master, not the custom branch. 

Is there a config option I need to set / is there a way for goxc to support this?

While it doesn't happen often, we'd really like the ability to be able to cut custom builds from any branch.

For now, I deleted the tag generated by goxc, and manually created a tag pointed at the right commit.
How to create deb package with configuration files? [allegro/marathon-consul #113](https://github.com/allegro/marathon-consul/issues/113)

> dh_installdeb(1) automatically flags any files under the /etc directory as conffiles, so if your program only has conffiles there you do not need to specify them in this file. For most package types, the only place conffiles should ever be is under /etc, and so this file doesn't need to exist.

Allows the use of pre/post{inst,rm}, etc scripts.  The `resources-dir`
task setting should be set to the parent directory of a `debian` dir
containing the resources.
