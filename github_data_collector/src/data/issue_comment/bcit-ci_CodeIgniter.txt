Fix description of parameter $template in method parse_string.
When two process run garbage collector in same time there is a lots of errors because of unlinking non existing files.
`
unlink(/path/writable/ci_sessioncd16549628ebaf9d9d70ed71814429254b76b723): No such file or directory /path/system/libraries/Session/drivers/Session_files_driver.php 386 | Called: /link1
unlink(/path/writable/ci_sessiona64823e065b23325b50871eaafb840fcfc39060e): No such file or directory /path/system/libraries/Session/drivers/Session_files_driver.php 386 | Called: /link2
`
And there is a lot of similar logs. Time of execution of GC are same.
Run on CI 3.1.4 but same code is in 3.1.11.

Need in day numeracy and day order like from ISO-8601: starting from Monday for some countries.
Also, it may need to start counting from 1 (instead of 0).
Some working example from one of my projects attached below.
[calendar_helper.php](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/files/3965282/calendar_helper.txt)

Added the option to set the samesite attribute for the session cookie. Default is "Strict"
The `join()` method in `/system/database/DB_query_builder.php` limits the usable join types with the following array:
```
if (! in_array($type, ['LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'OUTER', 'INNER', 'LEFT OUTER', 'RIGHT OUTER'], true)) {
```
This is true for Codeigniter 4 as well. `FULL OUTER` is missing from this list. Is there any reason why?

Hi,

I tried to create a ZIP with 277MB of files. The allocated memory on PHP was exhausted because the Zip library seems to allocate 277MB twice (my php.ini sets the memory_limit to 512M).

The cause is get_zip() function, line 409:
```php
	return $this->zipdata
			.$this->directory."\x50\x4b\x05\x06\x00\x00\x00\x00"
			.pack('v', $this->entries) // total # of entries "on this disk"
			.pack('v', $this->entries) // total # of entries overall
			.pack('V', self::strlen($this->directory)) // size of central dir
			.pack('V', self::strlen($this->zipdata)) // offset to start of central dir
			."\x00\x00"; // .zip file comment length
```
Memory is allocated two times: one time for $this->zipdata itself, and a second time for the concatenation.
To workaround quickly this issue, I wrote a MY_Zip class, and overload this function with:
```php
	$this->zipdata .=
			$this->directory."\x50\x4b\x05\x06\x00\x00\x00\x00"
			.pack('v', $this->entries) // total # of entries "on this disk"
			.pack('v', $this->entries) // total # of entries overall
			.pack('V', self::strlen($this->directory)) // size of central dir
			.pack('V', self::strlen($this->zipdata)) // offset to start of central dir
			."\x00\x00"; // .zip file comment length
	return $this->zipdata;
```
I hope this will help you to improve this library.
Regards
