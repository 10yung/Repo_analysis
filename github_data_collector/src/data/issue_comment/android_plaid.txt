When only "Product Hunt" filter was selected and no data was available from the response, the progress was showing infinitely, also function onLoadMore in InfiniteScrollListener was refreshing infinitely when data was not available.

After cloning the master branch, the project does not compile. I get the following two compile errors.

1. `e: /Volumes/Zume/external/plaid/core/src/main/java/io/plaidapp/core/dribbble/data/search/DribbbleSearchConverter.kt: (111, 34): Only safe (?.) or non-null asserted (!!.) calls are allowed on a nullable receiver of type String?`
2. `e: /Volumes/Zume/external/plaid/core/src/main/java/io/plaidapp/core/util/SpringUtils.kt: (98, 31): Overload resolution ambiguity: 
public open fun remove(@Nullable element: DynamicAnimation.OnAnimationEndListener): Boolean defined in java.util.ArrayList
public open fun remove(@Nullable element: DynamicAnimation.OnAnimationEndListener!): Boolean defined in java.util.ArrayList`

Thanks.

As reported in this spotless's [issue ](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/440):

```
1: Task failed with an exception.
-----------
* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':mockwebserver:spotlessKotlin'.
> You must declare outputs or use `TaskOutputs.upToDateWhen()` when using the incremental task API
```

This should be fixed in v3.24.2.

tested with v3.26.2 and it works correctly.

Leave here as a remainder for when we migrate to Gradle 6.
