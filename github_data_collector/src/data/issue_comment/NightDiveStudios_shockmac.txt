I think it'd be a good idea to list the hashes for the game assets that were included with the original "origin" of this source code, so that people can be sure they are getting the right data. I'm saying this because I suspect that the data may differ between different releases and versions (the different versions of the CD, GOG or Steam releases). I know the source code will probably be compatible with later versions of the assets, but it'd still be good to know what state the original assets this source came with were in.
DialogHelpers.h did not play well with github due to the ISO-8859-1 format.
fr_camera_create doesn't check arg2 before calling LG_memcpy with it as a source.  Some invocations of fr_camera_create call with arg2 as NULL, leading to a null-pointer deref.

Found while running the code under valgrind.
I haven't has a chance to look at the C++ standard, and there might be reasons or cases where this is okay.  If the compiler guarantees to inline a function, the storage for the "local" notionally becomes local to the caller, so it could potentially be okay in some cases.  However, g++ warns about these inline operators, and from looking at the unoptimised output they are not being inlined and the code emitted explicitly returns null.

This is worth bearing in mind for people who are porting the source to other toolchains.
I've tried compiling the source code (from the .sit file) on 3 different Macs (OS 8.6, 9, and 10.4 in Classic) using CW 10 Gold, and on every machine the final link fails with "Not enough room in heap zone". 

The problem appears to be 2dLib: either the code or data field for 2dLibPPC will be way too big, and the total fields at the bottom add up into the hundreds of MB. The code/data sizes in the 2dLib project look fine, and the file itself is 532 KB, all normal. Removing and re-adding the library to the Shock project doesn't seem to help, neither do different compile options.

Has anyone else come across this problem?

Something seems to be wrong with the newlines. One can possibly use [sed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed) to fix it.

The Mac-style line endings were making browsing the files on modern systems difficult. Using `mac2unix` I fixed up the line endings for all non-binary files when possible. 

I didn't touch any of the .u files
