Dear markostam,
Thanks for providing your source code!

I have a couple of questions regarding FuLMS2.m code.
1. please explain Szh = abs( ifft(1./abs(fft(Szh))), never understand for me!
2. when calculating xpvec, I think xpvec would be xpvec = Szh'*xvec instead of yours.
3. ypvec is not updating in your code. So, ypvec should be ypvec = Szh'*yvec;

please let me know what I missed!
unfortunately, if those of above are reflected, the code isn't workding well.

I don't know why! I need your help.
Thank you in advance!
