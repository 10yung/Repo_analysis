I downloaded this application (Jams Music Player) to create a tutorial today.
When examining the application, I noticed that the application closed when I moved to the Settings section.

I do not know if the shutdown problem is on other devices. I took a video. I will share the features of my device in the additional information section below.

Hello guys,
I just realized that this project has not received any update for the last **3** years.A lot has happened since then with the Android platform.I would like to see this project being kept up to date.Hence, I am proposing a spin-off fork that that can be kept up to date with all the changes in android.
I have a fork [here](https://github.com/bdhobare/JamsMusicPlayer) that compiles with the recent build tools and includes Android M Runtime permissions.

 Thank you and I would love to get your thoughts on this.
I'm running into this issue after importing the project.

`Error:(14, 0) Could not find method renderscriptSupportMode() for arguments [true] on ProductFlavor_Decorated{name=main, dimension=null, minSdkVersion=DefaultApiVersion{mApiLevel=14, mCodename='null'}, targetSdkVersion=DefaultApiVersion{mApiLevel=19, mCodename='null'}, renderscriptTargetApi=19, renderscriptSupportModeEnabled=null, renderscriptSupportModeBlasEnabled=null, renderscriptNdkModeEnabled=null, versionCode=null, versionName=null, applicationId=com.jams.music.player, testApplicationId=null, testInstrumentationRunner=null, testInstrumentationRunnerArguments={}, testHandleProfiling=null, testFunctionalTest=null, signingConfig=null, resConfig=null, mBuildConfigFields={}, mResValues={}, mProguardFiles=[], mConsumerProguardFiles=[], mManifestPlaceholders={}, mWearAppUnbundled=null} of type com.android.build.gradle.internal.dsl.ProductFlavor.`
Hi,
  I was going through the code  & it is extremely helpful for newbies, I must thank you for that. While going through the code i have observed that search functionality implementation is incomplete. Would 
you be able to fill in the wiring part.

R.id.action_search in MainActivity.java doesn't have any implementation.

Error on the style.
I open with eclipse, and find errors section <style name = "UAmpAppTheme" parent = "Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
"Error: Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name 'Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar'."
and I've added a library appcompat V7, but still error.

Hi, 
First of all thanks for your huge contribute to the open source community.

I managed to build changing manually the gradle files, but I'm not able to call the equalizer without a crash of the app.

Hoping for a tip,

I spent a day to handle compiled errors, but still exists.
First I import to AS, compiled error is “can not find runProguard...”, then I note buildTypes { release { runProguard...} }. But appearing a new error 

Error:Execution failed for task ':jamsMusicPlayer:dexDebug'.

> com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: org.gradle.process.internal.ExecException: Process 'command '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_75.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java'' finished with non-zero exit value 2

I don't know how to solve this problem.
