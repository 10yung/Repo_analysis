Hi,

Thanks for Developing such amazing Sample App.

I want to play some m3u8 link so i checked AdaptiveStreaming Sample code but its not working on some m3u8 link .
I am test AdaptiveStreaming Sample but some m3u8 link is not working on this Player.

We are also check this link on jwplayer on crome and Android Device also & all link are working fine but its not working on this video player. I am giving you sample m3u8 link . I hope you will check and replay me asap.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58869433/backgroundtask-uwp-c-trigger-only-one-time
https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/BackgroundTask/cpp

When i call `TaskDeferral->Complete();`, that background process will exit when `BackgroundTask::Run()` return. Otherwise, process not exit but can't receive any trigger again.

In C# background project, it work normally (running and receive trigger)
My project need loading something when started. Loading huge data per trigger is really bad.
Hi

When running the BluetoothLE sample, "Scenario3_ServerForeground" if a device connects and the service is then stopped by the UWP program the device remains connected. The device also remains connected after closing the UWP program. The connection has to be terminated by the remote device.

How can the device be disconnected by the UWP program?

I am using VS2019 16.3.9 and Windows 1903.

Thanks

The `XamlDataVirtualization` has a flaw in both scenarios tested so far in the pictures library hosting circa 1800 pictures.
While both scenarios create thumbnails nicely as we scroll, scrolling up and down several times throughout the entire grid, and then making a pause (no scroll whatsoever) will at some point drop the process memory to a low value (60MB in my case), after which the `GridView` displays empty items with seemingly no way to get them back through scrolling.
Unfortunately I have no clue on a possible solution to provide you.

In all Holographic C++  projects, there is some sort of error present with Visual Studio 2019 16.3.4 (the latest build) and a target platform of 18362. I will cite one example of a flaw which is present in all projects, and another example of a flaw present in one specific project (although there are many such errors).

In regards to the issue specific to one project, I encountered an error when looking through the ``HolographicFaceTracking`` sample. In this example, in the file ``HolographicFaceTracking/Content/ShaderStructures.h``, which outlines several structures like float matricies, VertexColors, and VertexTextures. In the ``static_assert`` call shown above, the code is written to try to assert whether the ``CubeModelConstantBuffer`` and ``QuadModelConstantBuffer`` structures, have a size that is a multiple of 16. This assertion should pass, as these buffers are float4x4s with no additional padding added my the compiler, and have a size of 64 bytes (as found by ``size(CubeModelConstantBuffer)`` and ``size(QuadModelConstantBuffer)``). Nevertheless, as shown in the image, Visual Studio shows that the assertion fails.

This might be due to static_assert failing itself. 

Concerning a flaw present in all projects, MS consistently seems to be capturing the values for use in their lambdas incorrectly (see the image below). This is present in every single Holographic sample project, and I am not sure why. I find this can often be alleviated by pushing out this and creating a managed reference (i.e., ``AppView^ current``, and pointing it to ``this``). Nevertheless, there is something quite off about all the Holographic sample projects. Has something changed? Am I using the wrong SDK? I'd appreciate any help. Fixing these sample projects would be great, as all the HL guides direct people here, and obviously, these samples aren't much help to developers if they are not working.

I've got a new variation of [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/issues/576) from back in 2017. The repro is the same but the result is slightly different for me.

Repro:
1. Build CameraStarterKit sample for x64 and run.
2. Start a video recording.
3. Minimize the app.

Result:
```
System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0xC00D3E82): A media source cannot go from the stopped state to the paused state. A media source cannot go from the stopped state to the paused state.
```

Yes, the exception error message appears twice!?!

I ran the sample and triggered the Time Trigger background task. I added a timer that will show a notification every 5 seconds. 

It's working fine but when i close the app, the background task get canceled. 
Is this not a sample for out-of-process background task or am i missing something?
I try  c# "SpeechAndTTS.sln" solution on my windows 10 build 18362 when I press the button "Dictate" in Continuous Dictation session to active the microfone the  ContinuousRecognitionSession_Completed resturn Status unknown and the system doesn't start

All privacy configuration in settings are on. are there other configuration to use this sample?

Thank
Mat
