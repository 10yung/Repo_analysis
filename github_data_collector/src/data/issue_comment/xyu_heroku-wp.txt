This PR updates the Vagrant development environment to install and use PHP 7.3 (7.3.11 at the time of the PR), which is the same PHP version `^7.3` will result in running on Heroku.

The `composer.json` is updated to reflect `^7.3` and `composer.lock` file is generated from the Vagrant install to match so Heroku won't throw any warnings like in #104.

If you test this using macOS, take a look at #161 if composer fails, that probably won't be related to this PR.
I am now getting this error anytime I attempt to run `composer update` in vagrant. This happens in all my projects, including a fresh clone of this project and `vagrant up`.

I sometimes get random `502 Bad Gateway` error. Any idea why? Thanks.
Hi.
I've setup S3 bucket and set up the AWS_S3_URL variable according docs. Then activate plugin s3 plugin in wordpress. Now, when i'm trying to upload image via 'add new media' I receive 36 copies of this file (some of them are with different resolution, but anyway some of them are duplicated) in S3 bucket. I can't access anything from wordpress (empty media files list).
Uploading taking much time, during which i see duplicating ajax requests, duplicating uploading of the file in the browser. Uploading finishes sometimes with error, sometimes with success, but anyway i don't see image in the wordpress media list. But images are in the S3.
Any idea? Should I add any information ?
I used Vagrant with Windows 10 and there doesn't seem to be any errors in the logs when running **vagrant up**, but herokuwp.local only shows "File not found.".  I cloned the project with Git on Windows and went straight to hosting it locally to try it out, but no luck, can I get some help please?

These are the last few lines that appear after running **vagrant up**:

```
    herokuwp: predis/predis suggests installing ext-phpiredis (Allows faster serialization and deserialization of the Redis protocol)
    herokuwp: predis/predis suggests installing ext-curl (Allows access to Webdis when paired with phpiredis)
    herokuwp: symfony/polyfill-mbstring suggests installing ext-mbstring (For best performance)
    herokuwp: symfony/console suggests installing symfony/lock ()
    herokuwp: symfony/dependency-injection suggests installing symfony/expression-language (For using expressions in service container configuration)
    herokuwp: symfony/dependency-injection suggests installing symfony/proxy-manager-bridge (Generate service proxies to lazy load them)
    herokuwp: symfony/event-dispatcher suggests installing symfony/http-kernel ()
    herokuwp: wp-cli/wp-cli suggests installing psy/psysh (Enhanced `wp shell` functionality)
    herokuwp: composer/composer suggests installing ext-zip (Enabling the zip extension allows you to unzip archives)
    herokuwp: Writing lock file

    herokuwp: .
    herokuwp: Restarting nginx (via systemctl): nginx.service
    herokuwp: .
```

If I write **vagrant provision** I get the following error:

```
    herokuwp: > ./support/app_slug_compile.sh
    herokuwp: sh: 1:
    herokuwp: ./support/app_slug_compile.sh: not found
    herokuwp: Script ./support/app_slug_compile.sh handling the post-install-cmd event returned with error code 127
```
currently the setup script is not working on windows. Can we add support for it? I had to run all the commands manually. If its ok i can help in contributing it.
Hi,

about 3 months ago I was able to run on localhost a wordpress site using heroku-wp.

All I had to do was run PHP built in server on mac

php -S localhost:8000 

and it worked... I just had to set the directory with -t flag to be public.

This no longer works. Now, I have a public.built directory? What is that? When I try to run on local host the autoloader is failing. How can I fix this? Thanks.
