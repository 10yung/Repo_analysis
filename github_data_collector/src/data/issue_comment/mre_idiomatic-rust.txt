Lately, I can't find the time to add more resources to this list.
It would be nice to brush up the project a bit and add some more recent resources.

For example, my process for adding new articles is:

1. Pick a promising article from [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/) or the top weekly articles from [/r/rustlang](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?t=week).
2. Read the article
3. Decide if it's a good fit for the list.
4. Add to the list.

If you're unsure, just create a pull request or add a comment here and we decide together.
