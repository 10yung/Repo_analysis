*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.3.0 - September 24th, 2019
> Fixes:
> 
> - Security: Disallow calling "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" directly - 2078c72
> - Disallow calling "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" directly - 2078c72
> 
> Features:
> 
> - Add new runtime option `allowCallsToHelperMissing` to allow calling `blockHelperMissing` and `helperMissing`.
> 
> Breaking changes:
> 
> Compatibility notes:
> - Compiler revision increased - 06b7224
>   - This means that template compiled with versions prior to 4.3.0 will not work with runtimes >= 4.3.0
>     The increase was done because the "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" are now moved from the helpers
>     to the internal "container.hooks" object, so old templates will not be able to call them anymore. We suggest
>     that you always recompile your templates with the latest compiler in your build pipelines.
> 
> - Disallow calling "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" directly - 2078c72
>   - Calling "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" directly from a template (like in `{{blockHelperMissing}}` was 
>     never intended and was part of the exploits that have been revealed early in 2019 
>     (see https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). *It is also part of a new exploit that 
>     is not captured by the earlier fix.* In order to harden Handlebars against such exploits, calling thos helpers 
>     is now not possible anymore. *Overriding* those helpers is still possible.
>   - If you really need this behavior, you can set the runtime option `allowCallsToHelperMissing` to `true` and the
>     calls will again be possible
> 
> Both bullet points imly that Handlebars is not 100% percent compatible to 4.2.0, despite the minor version bump.
> 
> We consider it more important to resolve a major security issue than to maintain 100% compatibility.

I used funkia/list on a larger project and was generally very happy with it. One big missing piece for me was the availability of a NonEmptyList. Having this available helps reduce a lot of code concerned with checking if a list is empty or not, because in many situations an empty list would be an application error and should be caught far out in the API layer, not in the app's core code.

The [fp-ts NonEmptyArray](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/blob/master/src/NonEmptyArray.ts) is a good starting point for how this should work.
```javascript
> var {list} = require ('list')
> var show = require ('sanctuary-show')
```

Current behaviour:

```javascript
> show (list ('foo', 'bar', 'baz'))
'{"bits": 3, "length": 3, "offset": 0, "prefix": [0], "root": undefined, "suffix": ["foo", "bar", "baz"]}'
```

Suggested behaviour:

```javascript
> show (list ('foo', 'bar', 'baz'))
'list ("foo", "bar", "baz")'
```

This would require defining a `@@show` method which applies [`show`][1] to each of the list's elements.

How can you use this list with `Ord` ?
