All `docker-compose_v3_*_pgsql_*.yaml` files also contain the MySQL and SQLite related services

Hi, How do I change database password? I'm using docker-compose. Can I change the .env file or .MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD file?
please install python3 as default in zabbix-agent (5.0)
Hi, we have a issue with zabbix/zabbix-server-mysql:centos-4.2-latest running on GCP k8s cluster. It doesn't matter how much we set memory requests and limits, zabbix-server always fill the maximum and pod is restarting. We have about one restart per day at random time. We have those requests and limits for now:
```
          resources:
           requests:
            cpu: "4"
            memory: 48Gi
           limits:
            cpu: "8"
            memory: 64Gi
```
We are monitoring use of memory (usageBytes) of every pod in k8s cluster and it seems like zabbix-server doesn't need so much memory, but sometimes it eats all of it. When I see the zabbix-server logs in time of restart I see it can't accept any TLS handshake from agents and can't run any script. Do you have any experience with it? Thank you.
I have ZBX_MEMORYLIMIT in my compose file but does nothing, I have to manually change in /etc/php7/php.ini.

 It is a very simple issue, so I think there isn't necessary more data, right?
I'm using the Zabbix-docker  &  docker-compose_v3_ubuntu_mysql_latest.yaml file to provision the whole stack and then the grafana6.0 using grafana_on_docker with grafana6+ version. I'm trying to integrate using alexanderzobnin-zabbix-app the issue comes even I follow the official documentation of Zabbix.

Running in Rancher.

Using zabbix-server latest image, tried both Ubuntu and Apline images. Receiving the following error on a simplecheck

fping failed: (null): can't create socket (must run as root?) : Permission denied

fping works when I shell into the container in ubuntu, as that is running as root.
fping fails in Alpine as that is run as user Zabbix 

Alpine:

>  ls -lah /usr/sbin/fping
> -rwsr-xr-x 3 root root 42.6K May 30 20:08 /usr/sbin/fping

Ubuntu:

> -rwxr-xr-x 4 root root 47K Jan  2  2018 /usr/bin/fping


I have tried changing the group to Zabbix.  I have tried adding setuid to the Ubuntu privileges.  Nothing seems to work here.
According to the document, it seems there is no volume entry for mysql database.?https://hub.docker.com/r/zabbix/zabbix-appliance/ 


Now that helm 3 doesn't require tiller anymore an official helm 3 chart would be great - thought imo it should be a seperate repo like zabbix-helm ?

It also maybe would help to fade away the appliance #506
- Fix zabbix-agent2 binary copy source PATH being wrong.
- Fix the PATH of the setting file copy source being wrong.
