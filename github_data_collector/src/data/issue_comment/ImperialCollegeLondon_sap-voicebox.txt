Hi, thanks for you're awesome work. I am wondering what is active speech level. Is it an index to  descript the speaker is speaking or not ?
Hello, when applying this function, we found that the recovery result has some improvement compared to the clean speech.(i.e. v_enframe ->fft ->ifft -> v_overlapadd ,hamming,256 point,64 inc).  And there is a line in the program ï¼š
(z(repmat(1:nf,nr,1)+repmat((0:nr-1)'*inc+rem((0:nr-1)',nb)*no,1,nf))=f.*repmat(w,nr,1);)   
why we should  f.*repmat(w,nr,1) ? 
I look forward to your reply. Thank you.
Hello, when I run v_spendred, I get the following prompt:

Covariance matrix not positive definite - To avoid this, try a higher energy floor (e.g. algo_params.ef=-50) or running the algorithm in slow mode using algo_params.mo = 0

I tried changing the value of algo_params.ef to -50, -40, -30, -20, but still, I tried algo_params.mo = 0 again and found it running for a long time but still running. Why is this so?
