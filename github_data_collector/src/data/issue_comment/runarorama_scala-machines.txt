That project appears to indicate (at the bottom of it's readme) that scalaz-streams is an older, "deprecated" version of this project. If that is correct, might be worth updating your readme to reflect this ...
sbt.version -> 0.13.0 and eclipse project files in .gitignore

I propose the following:
1. code coverage >90% (right now it's only ~50%), it's easy to get 100% here (Tee is actually 99% covered, remaining 1% seems to be due to a bug in emma)
2. good examples besides tests, examples showing different sources and sinks with the same machine should be especially impressive (i.e. listening for messages as an akka actor, reading them directly from a file or reading an in-memory list)
3. [future] Wye deserves some love (it could have same joins as Tee has now)

I think this could be an issue with the compiler. As far as I can tell the cases that it warns about are not possible because of the Nothing. A simple example shows the compiler change: https://gist.github.com/4705894

Is there a preference for working around the issue by putting in the missing cases even though they can't be reached, or ignoring the warning? I will do up another pull request if someone thinks it is worth working around.
