After several days both containers not running. Restarting in original sequence resolving the problem and all working great again three maybe five or more days. Command "docker container ls -a" shows "Exited (255) xx  minutes ago"
I am a new fish of docker, so I don't understand the way mentioned in the doc , I deployed the image in  the environment of docker in arukas,which is a docker service provider  ,but I have no right to access the vps host , what should I do ? Thanks!!!

Hi, I want to use the dockvpn behind a proxy.
I try to assign 
- 110 to 8080
- 112 to 443
- 111 to 1194

But this is not working, either I assign port through docker container or I modify the files 'run' and serverconfig'

How can I do it ?

update2latest repo

```
$ CID=$(docker run -d --privileged -p 1194:1194/udp -p 443:443/tcp jpetazzo/openvpn)
$ docker run -t -i -p 8080:8080 --volumes-from $CID jpetazzo/openvpn serveconfig
Please run the OpenVPN container at least once in normal mode,
to generate the client configuration file. Thank you.
```

Hello, I just followed your instructions to setup vpn on digital ocean box, but I am not able to connect to it:

I realise this may not be an issue of dockvpn, but perheps you know a workaround? Thanks anyway!

Hi there,
I've been working on some improvements to dockvpn.  There is a new master helper script call 'runDockVPN.sh'.  It currently creates a volume only container, as suggested in:
http://docs.docker.io/use/working_with_volumes/
that containes the /etc/openvpn configuration files, so that they survive between runs.

In that directory is created an EasyRSA CA from the environment variables that you pass to it.  (edit runDockVPN.sh)

The configuration files are compatible with:
TunnelBlick, NetworkManager, Android and iPhone OpenVPN connect, and anything else you can imagine, I'm sure.

It then starts up on the ports that you request and spits out the directory on the docker server where your config files are stored.  Those can either be rsync'd with the command in the README or using docker's exporting of volumes.

Currently broken is the auto-hosting of the VPN config file because I no longer create the server pem like previously.

It may need some cleaning up, but it works on my amd64 and armel boxes as long as you are willing to rsync the ovpn config files down.  This, after all is more of a security feature than a bug, but it may be harder to get the file on one's phone.

This is my first fully functioning Docker project, so thanks so much for a starting place!
