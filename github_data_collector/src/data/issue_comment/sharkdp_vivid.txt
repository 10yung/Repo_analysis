Is it possible to run vivid on MacOS?

I installed `vivid` with `cargo`, copied `filetypes.yml` to `.config/vivid` to avoid the `Error: Could not find filetypes database` but then adding `export LS_COLORS="$(vivid generate molokai)"` to `.zshrc` did nothing, which made me research a bit more and I found out that MacOS uses `LSCOLORS` and that it doesn't work the same as `LS_COLORS` so I guess this means that `vivid` won't run on MacOS, but I thought I should ask.

A fallback to 16 colors would be great for those of us who use a terminal with a set color scheme locally, and rely on true color for unconfigured terminals or over ssh. 

What if a theme-designer decides to colorize in a completely orthogonal way? For example: highlight everything which is Python-related in a specific color/style.

Well, it is possible to do this by highlighting `programming.source.python` and `programming.tooling.packaging.python` and `programming.tooling.code-style.python` with the same style, but maybe it would be nice to be able to just have a single entry in the spirit of CSS-tags (`#python { ... }`).

Another option would be to allow wild-cards (`programming.*.python`).

For example: Explicitly use different colors for C++ `*.hpp` header files than for `*.cpp` source files.
Ideal CLI usage (?):

```
vivid generate snazzy  # Use default DB, use "snazzy" theme
vivid generate snazzy --db my_filetypes.yml
vivid generate my_theme.yml --db my_filetypes.yml  # Explicitly specify the path to a theme
```

Themes should be searched in `~/.config/vivid/themes` and `/usr/share/vivid/themes`.
Would it help to use `.as_string()` and `.as_hash()` etc. methods in YAML parsing? 
.. since italic text ANSI escape codes can cause problems on some terminal emulators / tmux.
