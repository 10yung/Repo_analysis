The </> does not seems to work. It seems that I should click on it to work directly in html code. But it doesn't. For example, if I click on </> and then type Hello world! in standard paragraph tags, the output is not in code characters but uses html special characters instead, especially square brackets.
I think Pell urgently needs H3 and H4, because H4 is one of the the most useful headings. 
I'd also like to see a line-end after each closing block level tag to make the code more readable.

I wanted to use this package in a TypeScript project and couldn't find any type definitions. 

I was wondering if there will be any effort made to support TypeScript definitions in the future, either in this repo or in the [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) repo?


Hi,

Once a selected text has been converted into a link using the link icon, there is no way to know what the link URL was and modify it.

When I select text that is already a link and I click on the link icon, the prompt that asks what link to use has a blank content. I would expect it to be pre-filled with the current link content.

Would it be possible and not too difficult to implement this?

Thanks in advance
Add an eraser button to clear all format Ref #145
I believe this is currently not possible when creating custom actions. Will this be added for v2? Or is it possible to do now? Mainly I want to be able to do it for sub/super script.
i think we want just one pre tag
I have looked and tried to find the answer to my question, read all the issues, read me file and I don't seem to find anywhere that tells me how I can create a variable in php with the data? 

`$htmltxt = $_REQUEST['pout']; `

`<input type="hidden" name="pout" value="html-output">`

I understand php better than javascript, how do I send html-output to the form or how do I request it from php?

Answers would be helpful and adding this info to the readme file will be immensely useful. 

If anyone wants to supply the answers I will even write the how to...

Thanks and Regards
Guy
**I want to remove the image and link buttons. I can't seem to find a way to do this.** Can anyone advise, please. For my purposes, I need very limited functionality. I literally want people to be able to add bold/italics, headers, and lists. block quotes can also be of benefit, but linking out of my site is a no, as well as images that I can't control the sizing of.

I have figured out how to hide the buttons and stop them from working, but the code still contains the image and link sections just with blank icon and title, If I delete this it breaks the editor.

`link: {
    icon: '',
    title: '',
    },
  image: {
    icon: '',
    title: '',
    }`

like this:

```
if (initBody) {
	editor.content.innerHTML = initBody;
} else {
	editor.content.innerHTML = '<p><br></p>'
}
```

Most of the time images get inserted inside `<p></p>` tags. But if the user starts uploading images before he writes even a single letter, the image will be inserted at the top level since there's nothing else there.

Oh and will also need this in case user writes something and deletes it all again (in which case Pell sets it back to completely blank):

```
onChange: (html) => {
	if (html === '') {
		editor.content.innerHTML = '<p><br></p>'
	}
}
```
