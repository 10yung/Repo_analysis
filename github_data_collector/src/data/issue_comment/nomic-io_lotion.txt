Do you have more material how to use your code to build Android app for blockchain messenger
In addition to this 
https://youtu.be/rNvK9natbcM 
Especially for very beginners pls
Add any simple transaction handler function and put a simple log into it. 
You can find that every log is printed twice every time you try to send new tx.
I was able to mutate the state successfully. 
I could confirm that by checking the state using `lotion state <GCI>` cli. 

But I'm still getting initial state from `app.use((state, tx)=>{})`. 
Any idea?
I tried to build the example application from the readme & lotionjs.com but I keep hitting this same issue. The application appears to keep running despite the errors/warnings, but the GCI never shows up.

The code isn't anything special but, if it helps:

```

let lotion = require('lotion');

let app = lotion({
        initialState: {
                count: 0,
        }
})

function transactionHandler(state, transaction) {
        if (state.count === transaction.nonce) {
                state.count++;
        }
}

app.use(transactionHandler);

app.start().then(function(appInfo) { console.log(appInfo.GCI)});

```


Node 8.10.0
lotion 0.4.26

## Changes
Below via `npm audit fix`
- Bumped tendermint to version 4.0.8
- Bumped dev deps' deps in package-lock.json only (due to potentially-breaking version upgrades)

Ran tests afterward as well, which passed ðŸ‘Œ(edit: haha nvm, didn't see CI config)
Bumps [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) from 4.17.11 to 4.17.15.
