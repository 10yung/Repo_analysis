This project support tvOS 9.0ï¼Œbut use Carthage build the framework will set mini target to tvOS 13.2
CocoaPods support has been missing for a long time (#29, #124, and more), and last time I gave it a shot, CocoaPods didn't play nice. I don't use it, so I'm considering just removing support for it completely.

Any thoughts? cc @colemcampbell @Coledunsby
