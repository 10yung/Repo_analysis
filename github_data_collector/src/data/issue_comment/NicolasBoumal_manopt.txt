Creating the factory file for W = U*B*U' fixed rank geometry, where U is on the Stiefel and B is positive definite.
Nicolas,

First thanks for building ManOpt. It's just great. I have been looking into the source code, but could not figure out whether the strong Wolfe conditions are employed at any stage/version of the line search algorithms. As far as I know, this is essential for achieving descent in the L-BFGS algorithm. Or are there other line-search methods in ManOpt that can ensure this?

All the best,
Hi everyone!
I noticed manopt may take a long time to clone. Looking closer at the repo distribution, I see most of the content (22.5/24.8MB) is due to web/ and releases/. This is quite inconvenient for people (like me) packaging manopt as a local submodule in their projects (for solving dependencies).
Given the size of this project, I think it might be great to move those two heavy components (not directly related to the manopt functionality) to independent repositories (maybe NicolasBoumal/manopt-web and NicolasBoumal/manopt-releases). Worst case you can have those repositories as submodules in NicolasBoumal/manopt, although I would discourage that altogether.
Let me know what you think :)
