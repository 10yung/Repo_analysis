Hi - 

When running ansiweather, I am getting a whitespace as the first character on the first line of output.

```
$ansiweather
 Weather in London  58 °F
Wind  11.41 mph E
Humd  67 %
Pres  30.21 inHg
SunR  May 18 05:03
SunS  May 18 20:51
```
Also, is there a way to override the "Weather in" text and just have "Temp" for the output?

Edit:  Bash 4.4.19 on Mac High Sierra, if that makes any difference.

Small change to allow for specifying verbiage to prefix the temperature output. If provided, Temperature is prefixed with `$dashes` like other data output.

Allows for things like this by specifying a newline in dashes:

```
 Current weather in San Diego
 - Temp => 60 °F ☁
 - Wind => 3.8 mph SSE
 - Humidity => 58 %
 - Pressure => 30.09 inHg
 - Sunrise => Dec 30 06:50:43 AM
 - Sunset => Dec 30 04:52:54 PM
```
