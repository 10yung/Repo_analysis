Bug 

**What is the current behavior?**
I want to update the name of one task in the US page, on the tasks list. Usually, i'm doing that with the help of the pen icon, appearing when you fly over the task. 
In the last stable version of the taiga-front-dist, it threw an this.childScope is undefined error.

**What is the expected behavior?**
Changing the name of a task by using the pen icon on the userstory tasks list.

**Is it happening in taiga.io or in your own instance?**
Own Instnace, 

**What browser/version are you using?**
Firefox 72.0.1 and Chromium Version 79.0.3945.79

**Are there any console errors *(Ctrl + F12)* in red?**

I'd like to request feature of showing full names in autocompletion user mentions suggestions in addition to user names and allowing search by it.

Currently if I for example write a comment and want to mention a user, I could press `@`, start typing user name and get drop down list which allows to choose existing users whose usernames begin with text that I type. But it is not so simple and intuitive to find user name. Full names are much more common in user interface. I see that also you could start typing full name of user and autocompletion popup will appear also. But if I for example know that name of user is "John" and don't know his username, there could be many Johns in big project and in autocompletion popup I'll see something like:

- @johnallmighty1232131
- @johncoder321321
- ...

And how should I understand who is needed John here?

I think it will be really useful if I could start typing `John` and get autocompletion suggestions both with usernames and fullnames, like:
- @johnallmighty1232131 - John Smith
- @johncoder321321 - John Johnson
- ...

Such suggestion list is much more useful!

In same way user mentions autocompletion are implemented for example in GitHub, see screenshot:

I'd like to request feature of autocompletion user mentions using `@` in Markdown mode.

Currently if I for example write a comment and want to mention a user, I could press `@`, start typing user name and get drop down list which allows to choose existing users whose usernames begin with text that I type. But! This only works in HTML mode.

I prefer Markdown mode and I think that I'm not the only one. So autocompletion of user names without having to switch to HTML mode and back again will be useful.

In same way user mentions autocompletion are implemented for example in GitHub, user mentions autocompletion are available in Markdown mode (though there is no other mode here, yes).

When editing an existing attribute status or adding a new one (in admin panel), it's not possible to change the color of the status.

**What is the current behavior?**
This is in the Kanban view. Currently, a small coloured clock appears in the US card when a deadline is set, but it is restricted to the clock and not so eye-catching.

**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**

The colour of a "due date" can be set in the "attributes" settings page; setting a due date on a US or task activates a clock icon bearing that colour.

**What is the expected behavior?**

It would be good if User Stories themselves could take on the "due date" colour (on the Kanban card) when the deadline approaches. It would help to highlight them, especially for more time-bound projects. I'm using Taiga for a magazine project, where we set deadlines for article completion; if the US were coloured by deadline we could more easily decide what to focus on next.

Regarding styling: as of now, marking a user story as "blocked" currently gives it a red background; we could use a similar styling but giving the "due date" colour instead of red. This behaviour could be toggled on the project level, possibly from the "due date" settings itself (something like "show coloured clock" or "colour whole card").

Thanks for reporting!

This is a bug, taiga 4.2 on premise.

I wanted to move stories within Status, but all stories with filtered Status get promoted to the top.

Scenario:

Enter: backlog.

Four US:
1. status Ready
2. status New
3. status Ready
4. status New

Filter, e.g. filter backlog on "New" status.

Move US 4 upwards, i.e. above US 2.

Remove filtering.

Expectation of order after reordering:
1. US 1 (status Ready)
2. US 4 (status New)
3. US 2 (status New)
4. US 3 (status Ready).

Reality:
1. US 4 (status New)
2. US 2 (status New)
3. US 1 (status Ready)
4. US 3 (status Ready).

Browser is latest Google Chrome. Bug is known for several weeks, at least and present accross devices of different Team members.

I cannot attach console errors now - don't want to have entire backlog reordered again!

**What is the current behavior?**
To bulk add tasks, you must add cards to a sprint. For teams that have a more steady-flow, but need details subtasking for quality control - this is a real pain.

**What is the expected behavior?**
US would have a "Bulk Instert" item for subtasks, just as the kanban has a bulk insert for US

Thanks for reporting!
