This new version is posted here:

https://github.com/leachandrew/mcgill_csl

1) Added disambiguation of sources:
1. Chalifour, “Making Federalism Work for Climate Change”, supra note 4.
2. Chalifour, “Canadian Climate Federalism”, supra note 5.
3. Chalifour, “Jurisdictional Wrangling”, supra note 6.

2) Fixed paragraph pinpoints to match McGill Guide

4. Ontario Hydro v Ontario (Labour Relations Board), 3 SCR 327 (C) [Ontario Hydro] at
para 17.

3) Fixed book section so that it doesn't shorten the book title

5. Erin L Nelson, “Gestational Surrogacy in Canada” in E Scott Sills, ed, Handbook of
Gestational Surrogacy, 1st ed (Cambridge University Press, 2016) 123.
first last, test book (here: pub, 2019).

4) Added a default to case short forms inclusion at first mention:
6. Ontario Hydro v Ontario (Labour Relations Board), 3 SCR 327 (C) [Ontario Hydro]

There are a few remaining bugs to fix:

1) I'd like it to only include the short form where there is a subsequent mention or somehow as an option only.

2) Disambiguation only works with 3 or more mentions from the same author, but it should work with only 2.
I posted subsection 10.2.2 from "[Rules for content, form and structure of bibliographic references (China National Standard GB/T 7714－2005)](https://gradschool.ustc.edu.cn/ylb/material/xw/wdxz/19.pdf)" and translated it as follows:

`When citing multiple authors in the text, only the first author's last name should be marked for European and American authors, followed by "et al"; the first author's name should be marked for Chinese authors, followed by the "等" (Chinese word, same meaning as "et al"). Leave a proper gap with "et al" or "等".`



The following does not meet China National Standard GB/T 7714-2005 and needs modification.
1. All authors are shown in the main text.
2. European and American authors, followed by "et al" in the main text but the style is "等" for all authors.
3. Names shown for European and American authors are not just last names.
4. There is no gap between the author and "et al" or "等".

Thanks for your guys' work.
I was just contemplating whether it wouldn't be much clearer to get rid of https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles-distribution, and just have Travis CI automatically push any successful commit build in "master" to a "1.0.1" branch in this repo.

Benefits:

- Two fewer repositories (https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles-distribution and https://github.com/citation-style-language/distribution-updater can be retired).
- The "1.0.1" branch would be a stable location from where downstream projects can source v1.0.1 CSL styles, making it more straightforward for us to migrate "master" to a new CSL version whenever we want. Basically each CSL release would immediately get its own dedicated branch ("1.0", "1.0.1", etc.) from which downstream projects can source their styles. It would receive updates while the release is current and go dormant whenever we release a new CSL version.
- Probably would make it easier to address some packaging requests like https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/pull/2706 as well.

Main question I think is whether we can easily reproduce some of the logic currently embedded in https://github.com/citation-style-language/distribution-updater/blob/master/scripts/styles_distribution.py in a Travis CI-run script (modified README.md, updating `<updated/>` timestamps with UTC commit time, deleting non ".csl" files except for renamed-styles.json).

See e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/a/52960498 and https://stackoverflow.com/a/48339945 for implementation options.


I realize changing this will likely break many downstream projects, but there would be some advantage to putting all independent CSL styles into their own subdirectory ("independent/"), as we do with the dependent CSL styles. Maybe we can make the change along with a major CSL update.

In particular, the project README is currently easily overlooked (especially for infrequent GitHub users), as visitors either have to click the README.md link or scroll all the way down the page. Considering this is our GitHub repository with the most traffic by far, that's rather unfortunate.

Smaller side benefits:

- it would separate most non-style files (like README.md, .travis.yml, renamed-styles.json, etc.) from the independent styles, making the former easier to find.
- https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/ will likely load a little faster
I think it would behoove us to adopt a Code of Conduct and/or Diversity Statement, as part of open source best practices. Some options:

1. [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
2. [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/)
3. [Project Jupyter Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md)

If anybody knows of other templates that would be a good fit for us, or has an opinion about the options above, please chime in.
Atualização do estilo associacao-brasileira-de-normas-tecnicas-ufrgs-initials.csl de acordo com a nova norma ABNT 6023:2018

The style is dependent on http://www.zotero.org/styles/springer-basic-author-date

It does not properly support references to software/computer programs. 

How it should look:

> R Core Team (2019). R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing. Version 3.6.1. Vienna, Austria. URL
  https://www.R-project.org/.

How it currently is formatted:

> R Core Team (2019) R: A language and environment for statistical computing. 

Edit: This is in Mendeley when the document type is set to "Computer Program"
