I admit it's hard to tell what's going on by reading the title of this issue but I didn't know how to put it in a better way and I think it's severe.

To reproduce

- use only 2 view controllers in UIPageVIewController (that's the scenario I use).
- swipe to the second view controller and continue swiping **but keep your fingers down on the display** so that the highlight bar'x origin x position will continue to be larger than the center of the screen (in case of e.g. iPhone8 = 187.5).
- In order to reproduce it, it's important that you do not lift your finger after you started scrolling from the first to the second vc. If that's hard to do, keep pushing your first finger down on the display and use a second finger to scroll further.
- Once the highlight bar's x position is > 187.5 (in case of the iPhone 8) it will switch back to 0 and the highlight bar is in the position of the first view controller even thought the second vc is currently displayed.

@cwRichardKim any idea how to fix that?
I'm not able to hide navigation bar even using [self.navigationController setNavigationBarHidden:YES];

I also have commented code which is responsible to draw SegmentButtons.
How to change the button color when it is clicked in order know that this is is selected tab and the other buttons should have old unselected color.
How to add back button in this ?
So far, loving the implementation @cwRichardKim (plus checked out your other projects too and excited to try those out). Thanks for putting this together. How long did it take you? 

I'm noticing 

> Unbalanced calls to begin/end appearance transitions

 for in the console when I dismiss a viewcontroller that was presented via

```
    [self presentViewController:destinationVC
                       animated:YES
                     completion:nil];
```

Any help on this one? 
How to handle Page controller in RKSwipeBetweenControllers which is getting called Twice.

Is their a way to use it instead of **UISegmentedControl** in UISearchController. Or use it along a UISearchBar to make it similar? Please advise.



Hey man, first, awesome job! 
Second, I'm new to Xcode so please bear with me :-).

When I run you test it shows the app running in the middle of the screen with about a cm on the top and bottom (iphone6) of empty space  - if I remember correctly there is a way to autosize - (self.view.frame.size.width/height) how would I implement that ?
