Parse non-ASCII characters in StatsBomb (and other) data for use with `soccerPosition` and other future plotting functions. For example, `Kylian MbappÃ©` currently renders as `Kylian MbappÃƒÂ©`.
Collect more pitch dimensions (length, width in metres) to pass to soccermatics functions for accurate visualisation of x,y-coordinates.

Many performance datasets (e.g. [WhoScored](https://www.whoscored.com/)) provide relative x,y-coordinates (e.g. a scale of 0-100), but true dimensions (i.e. in metres) are required in order to determine true distances (e.g. pass length, shot distance) and accurately visualise data on the pitch.

The file [pitch_dimensions.csv](https://github.com/JoGall/soccermatics/blob/master/data/pitch_dimensions.csv) contains this information, although only recent EPL teams (2016-17, 2017-18) and a few others are currently listed. These data were just grabbed manually from Wikipedia pages, with units being converted to metres where only yards were given (1 m = 1.09361 yards). The `alt_name` column contains alternative teamname definitions (e.g. as they appear in http://football-data.co.uk) to aid team identification.

Expanding this list if pitch dimensions would be useful so I welcome any contributions made with a pull request!
A rough list of functions and utilities I'd like to add to the package. Recommendations welcomed!

ðŸš§ = under construction 
ðŸ’¡ = still just a pipedream

#### Visualisations
ðŸ’¡ [Post-match odds based on simulating shots](https://taketheshotdotco.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/game_sim_01.png)
ðŸš§ [Voronoi diagrams](http://www.optasportspro.com/about/optapro-blog/posts/2017/blog-analysing-footballers%E2%80%99-decisions-in-and-around-the-penalty-box/) / [Delaunay triangulation](https://sushanteapen.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/delaunay-7681.png?w=700) / [convex hull](https://sushanteapen.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/hull-7682.png?w=700)
ðŸš§ Wrapper functions to [animate](http://revolution-computing.typepad.com/.a/6a010534b1db25970b01b7c88eb982970b-800wi) metrics frame by frame
ðŸ’¡ [Defensive coverage plots](https://www.optasports.com/media/2229/def-coverage.png)

#### Advanced analytics
ðŸš§ Wrapper functions for common metrics (xG, xA, forward progressions, PossAdjT&A, etc...)
ðŸ’¡ [Event sequence plots](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Drve5KPWkAAGxJi.jpg:large) and [possession sequence metrics](http://www.optasportspro.com/en/about/optapro-blog/posts/2016/blog-introducing-a-possessions-framework/) (possession spell and final product, i.e. does it end in final third, end in shot, end in goal)
ðŸ’¡ [Directness](http://www.optasportspro.com/en/about/optapro-blog/posts/2016/blog-introducing-a-possessions-framework/), [synchronisation of movement direction](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24733938.2018.1431399), space utilisation)
ðŸš§ Space control / dominance (e.g. ratio of Voronoi areas / convex hull areas)
ðŸ’¡ Goalscoring threat (xG in each frame based on view to goal based on distance / angle of ball from opposition goal, number of defending players in front of goal, number of attacking players nearby, etc..); similar to [this](karun.in/blog/expected-threat.html)
ðŸš§ Pressing effectiveness (e.g. average distance of defending players from ball, area of bounding box formed by defending team, time for n nearest players to close gap after possession change, etc..)

#### Machine learning stuff
ðŸ’¡ Infer [individual ball possession](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179953)
ðŸ’¡ Infer [shot and pass events](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.180.6492)
ðŸ’¡ Modelling [optimal positioning with deep imitation learning](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/75181/1/1671-2.pdf)
ðŸ’¡ Automated [formation discovery](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7023391/)

#### Misc.
ðŸš§ Add option Juego de Posicion pitch markings
ðŸ’¡ Make a `geom_pitch` layer as a [less monolithic](http://blog.mjskay.com/2017/11/05/i-don-t-want-your-monolithic-ggplot-function/) plotting function
ðŸš§ New system for working across multiple data sources (i.e. transform StatsBomb / Opta / whatever data so they can be used in a single function for xG plots / passmaps / whatever)
ðŸš§ Add to list of true [pitch dimensions](https://github.com/JoGall/soccermatics/issues/9)
