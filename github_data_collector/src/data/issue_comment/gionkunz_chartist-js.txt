Does Chartist have any options for automatically rendering a linear regression line for a given series or all series provided?
Happy New Year to all!
Thanks for the Chartist lib, I've been fiddling with it for the last few days, it had its learning curve, but I mostly got it showing what I need :)
My question or issue is, for a chart like this:

Is it possible for the overlapping dots to 'sum up' their color as they combine? As it is, the yellow ones (series 3) are hiding everything under them so you can't really tell if there are points behind.
Maybe there's a function, or some CSS I missed or overlooked in the documentation, sorry if this is the case!
TIA
Hello,

How can i install chartist and plugins without bower?

Thanks in advance.
Hello,

I created a fork of the tooltips plugin a while ago and currently I'm maintaining it. 
A user of my fork pointed out to me ([chartist-plugin-tooltip#5](https://github.com/LukBukkit/chartist-plugin-tooltip/issues/5)), that the website still refers to the old version. It would be nice if we could update the references on the chartist webpage.

To edit the website I had to upgrade `grunt-sass` to version 3.1.0, otherwise this wouldn't be compatible with NodeJS 12. I included distribution files of my plugin directly into the repository, because bower is [deprecated](https://bower.io/blog/2017/how-to-migrate-away-from-bower/) and I didn't want to list my plugin there if you shouldn't use it anymore.

And by the way thanks for your work on Chartist, it's my first choice for charting.
Hi all,

Does it support floating bars? The documentation does not say anything specific. I tried to a min/max value as array, but it doesn't draw it.

thanks

I can't find any issues relating to Org Chart
I've written a very preliminary modified `Line` chart type called `SegmentedLine` which allows a user to divide a line into segments based on an arbitrary test which can be encoded in the `meta` value for a point.  It's not in veyr good shape ATM but it works for me. If there's broader interest I can rewrite it with an eye to merging into Chartist.js or making more publicly available through another mechanism, but I won't bother if there's no interest.  The preliminary code is available here: https://github.com/titaniumbones/chartist-segmented-line ; feel free to comment here or open issues in that repo if you're intrested.

This is the chart, without any additional CSS:
```javascript
new Chartist.Line('.ct-chart', {
  series: [
    [1, 3, 2.5, 4, 5, 4.5, 6, 5, 7, 7.5, 11, 9.5, 12, 10, 7.5, 8, 11, 9]
  ]
}, {
  showArea: true,
  axisX: {
    showLabel: false,
    offset: 0
  },
  axisY: {
    showGrid: false,
    showLabel: false,
    offset: 0
  },
  height: '500px'
});
```
Why dose it not fill the entire width?
I have a problem changing the colours of the bar chat:
my code below:
```
var chartData = {
            labels: ['Minor', 'Major', 'Critical', 'Catastrophic'],
            series: [{
                className: 'ct-series ct-series-a',
                data: {stroke:'yellow', value: 3},
                data: {stroke:'green', value: 6},
                data: {stroke:'orange', value: 5},
                data: {stroke:'red', value: 8},
            }
            ]
        };```

As you can see the labels are not in the middle/center of the slice, it's a few pixels too high. In Chrome & Firefox I don't experience this. I have no idea what's causing this..
