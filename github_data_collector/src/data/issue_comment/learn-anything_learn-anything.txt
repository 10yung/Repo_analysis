## Feature Summary ‚ú®
<!-- A clear and concise description of the feature proposal. -->

When a user presses the button to `Create a study guide`, study guide creation page should be shown to the user.

## Why do we need this?
<!-- Please explain the motivation, how it will be used, etc. -->

Essential feature as without it no study guides can be created.

## How do you propose to implement this?
<!-- Please think about how this could be added. Can you add this and submit a PR? -->

There is [Figma mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/N2ioUbr7aiapNijNH8DH3Xh3/1.0?node-id=465%3A128) made by @johnletey already. Preview:

We can start with that and implement the required logic we need to store the user input from the page on the backend and in our database.

Need to think how we will serialize the study guides and what data structures will be used.

## Summary
<!-- Summarize the feature in a few sentences: -->

Add API endpoints for knowledge graph, study guides & user profiles.

## Why do we need this?
<!-- Please explain the motivation, how it will be used, etc. -->

These are core features of the platform.

## How do you propose to implement this?
<!-- Can you add this and submit a PR? Please think about how this could be added. -->

Write it in Go and expose it to front end via GraphQL.

For study guides authoring we can look into [realworld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) and see what logic we need to write and save a study guide (essentially an article).

Postgres DB should be setup too to save everything.

Knowledge graph includes all the topics. No relationships between topics for now. Although we can think about it too.
