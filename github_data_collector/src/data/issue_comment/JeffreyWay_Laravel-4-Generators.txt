Hello, I could not run it in 5.6! Ask for the Illumiate ... Is it going to be updated?
********************************************************************************************
 Problem 1
    - Conclusion: remove laravel/framework v5.6.28
    - Conclusion: don't install laravel/framework v5.6.28 ... v5.6.0

    - way/generators **2.0** requires illuminate/support 4.1.* -> satisfiable by illuminate/support[4.1.x-dev - v4.1.9]....
    - way/generators **2.6.1** requires illuminate/support 4.1.* -> satisfiable by illuminate/support[4.1.x-dev - v4.1.9].
    - don't install illuminate/support 4.1.x-dev|don't install laravel/framework 5.6.x-dev ... 5.6.x-dev

    - Installation request for laravel/framework 5.6.* -> satisfiable by laravel/framework[5.6.x-dev - v5.6.9].
    - Installation request for way/generators ~2.0 -> satisfiable by way/generators[2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.6.1].

[Symfony\Component\Debug\Exception\FatalErrorException]              
  Call to undefined method Illuminate\Foundation\Application::share() 
I have the need to create a many-to-many on the same table (objects can be associated with a number of other objects).

The migration created tries to use the same foreign key:

```
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('munition_munition', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->integer('munition_id')->unsigned()->index();
        $table->foreign('munition_id')->references('id')->on('munitions')->onDelete('cascade');
        $table->integer('munition_id')->unsigned()->index();
        $table->foreign('munition_id')->references('id')->on('munitions')->onDelete('cascade');
        $table->primary(['munition_id', 'munition_id']);
    });
}
```

It should instead do something such as:

```
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('munition_munition', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->integer('munition_a_id')->unsigned()->index();
        $table->foreign('munition_a_id')->references('id')->on('munitions')->onDelete('cascade');
        $table->integer('munition_b_id')->unsigned()->index();
        $table->foreign('munition_b_id')->references('id')->on('munitions')->onDelete('cascade');
        $table->primary(['munition_a_id', 'munition_b_id']);
    });
}
```

can i use foreach loop in template file (*.txt)  ???
i want to echo something like this
$data =  ['field1' , field2', 'field3'];

its created seed class successfully but "class name" in the "file" is not created successfully.

I'm unable to use the command 'npm install command it is showing a lot of errors and i can't figure it out,I'm taking Laravel 5 tutorials by Jeffrey Way and he even told that sometime this command won't work and you can then use 'sudo npm install',but i on Windows and stuck on this issue...

- Added ability to add content to fillable field using migration data
  - Helps remember db structure as well as create model relations
  - Also important for auto filling models from input.
- Updated model and controller config path to default laravel 4 structure

be possible to add the option to this great plugin to add namespaces to the generated files? .... I really would facilitate working with Laravel and I need to organize the drivers and models according modules on systems as they are very large .... thanks greetings

The following section is duplicated in the readme :

```
Next, update Composer from the Terminal:

    composer update --dev
Once this operation completes, the final step is to add the service provider. Open app/config/app.php, and add a new item to the providers array.

    'Way\Generators\GeneratorsServiceProvider'
That's it! You're all set to go. Run the artisan command from the Terminal to see the new generate commands.

    php artisan
```

Well not much of a hassle, but the Readme section describing the installation in Laravel 4.2 and below actually describes the entire procedure twice. Had to look twice myself to figure it out :)
