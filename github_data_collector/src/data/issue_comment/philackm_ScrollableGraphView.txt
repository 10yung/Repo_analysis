Is it possible to make stacked bar chart?
The current release version errors when Carthage tries to compile. All that needs to be done is to tag the current commit as a new release as the fix is already in the latest commit on the master branch.
Currently the Y axis represents digit value like the intermediate stops. I want to have option where I can use [String] instead of those digits. Will it be possible?
Hi, thanks for this great library. I noticed a problem on the bar graph when reloading a new data set with default animation. This behavior does not happen when not using any animation or using the elastic one. 
This is the first state of the graph:

After reloading with the new data set:

Notice how the second and the fourth one is slightly thicker than others becuase their first state was higher. Second data set was all 0s. The same problem occurs the other way around too. It doesn't go all the way up to the last reference line. 

How can I achieve dot plots clickable? I want to fire the event on the selected plot.
Just ran the "Swift 5 updater" or whatever it's called, and your code is now compiling using the swift 5 compiler! Release the kraken! üêâ
Hi 
is there way to see how many points can be fit to viewable screen , not whole scrollable view only current view fit to screen ?

also i found max 40-50 points fit to current viewable screen , is there way to increase it ?? 

Earlier everything was working fine until today, when i scroll the graph it crashes on the func. - `setPlotPointPositions(forNewlyActivatedPoints activatedPoints: [Int], withData data: [Double]) ` on the line - `graphPoints[activatedPointIndex].x = newPosition.x`  with error - `Thread 1: Fatal error: Index out of range`. What could be the possible reason??
Thank you for this awesome library but I am facing some issue with adding dot on graph 
 
I want something like this

and I have used following code for adding dots on graph
achieving this 

    @IBOutlet var viewGraph: UIView!
    
    var arrPink = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 1]
    var arrBlue = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4]

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        let graphView = ScrollableGraphView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: viewGraph.frame.size.width, height: viewGraph.frame.size.height), dataSource: self)
    
        // Setup the second line plot.
        let orangeLinePlot = LinePlot(identifier: "orange")
        
        orangeLinePlot.lineWidth = 3
        orangeLinePlot.lineColor = #colorLiteral(red: 0.7492650747, green: 0.1955875754, blue: 0.3992423117, alpha: 1)
        orangeLinePlot.lineStyle = ScrollableGraphViewLineStyle.smooth
        
        orangeLinePlot.shouldFill = true
        orangeLinePlot.fillType = ScrollableGraphViewFillType.solid
        orangeLinePlot.fillColor = #colorLiteral(red: 0.7492650747, green: 0.1955875754, blue: 0.3992423117, alpha: 0.5)
        
        orangeLinePlot.adaptAnimationType = ScrollableGraphViewAnimationType.elastic

        // Setup the line plot.
        let blueLinePlot = LinePlot(identifier: "blue")
        
        blueLinePlot.lineWidth = 3
        blueLinePlot.lineColor = #colorLiteral(red: 0.07505937666, green: 0.6328803301, blue: 0.7182216644, alpha: 1)
        blueLinePlot.lineStyle = ScrollableGraphViewLineStyle.smooth
        
        blueLinePlot.shouldFill = true
        blueLinePlot.fillType = ScrollableGraphViewFillType.solid
        blueLinePlot.fillColor = #colorLiteral(red: 0.07450980392, green: 0.631372549, blue: 0.7176470588, alpha: 0.5)
        
        blueLinePlot.adaptAnimationType = ScrollableGraphViewAnimationType.elastic
        
        let blueDotPlot = DotPlot(identifier: "blueDot")
        blueDotPlot.dataPointType = ScrollableGraphViewDataPointType.circle
        blueDotPlot.dataPointSize = 4
        blueDotPlot.dataPointFillColor = #colorLiteral(red: 1.0, green: 1.0, blue: 1.0, alpha: 1.0)
        
        blueDotPlot.adaptAnimationType = ScrollableGraphViewAnimationType.elastic
       
        graphView.backgroundFillColor = #colorLiteral(red: 0.1172487214, green: 0.1462360024, blue: 0.2590934336, alpha: 1)
        self.view.backgroundColor = #colorLiteral(red: 0.1172487214, green: 0.1462360024, blue: 0.2590934336, alpha: 1)
        
        graphView.dataPointSpacing = 80
        graphView.shouldAnimateOnStartup = true
        graphView.shouldAdaptRange = true
        
        graphView.shouldRangeAlwaysStartAtZero = true
        
        let dotPlot = DotPlot(identifier: "darkLineDot") // Add dots as well.
        dotPlot.dataPointSize = 4
        dotPlot.dataPointFillColor = UIColor.white
        dotPlot.adaptAnimationType = ScrollableGraphViewAnimationType.elastic

        let referenceLines = ReferenceLines()
        
        referenceLines.referenceLineLabelFont = UIFont.boldSystemFont(ofSize: 8)
        referenceLines.referenceLineColor = UIColor.clear
        referenceLines.referenceLineLabelColor = UIColor.clear
        referenceLines.relativePositions = [0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1]
        
        referenceLines.dataPointLabelColor = UIColor.white.withAlphaComponent(1)
        // Add everything to the graph.
        graphView.addReferenceLines(referenceLines: referenceLines)
        graphView.addPlot(plot: blueLinePlot)

        graphView.addPlot(plot: blueDotPlot)
        graphView.addPlot(plot: orangeLinePlot)

        graphView.addPlot(plot: dotPlot)

        viewGraph.addSubview(graphView)
        
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
        
    }

but the issue is that dot is plotting on on one bar I am unable to add dot on both bar please check bellowed screen shot and please help me where I was wrong.
