## What problem does this feature solve?
Solve the problem of saving data when closing the drawer.

## What does the proposed API look like?
Same of `NzModal`, when nzContent is Component, put  component instance an argument.

https://ng.ant.design/components/modal/en

> Specify a function that will be called when a user clicks mask, 
> close button on top right or Cancel button (If nzContent is Component, the Component instance will be put in as an argument). 
> Note: When created with NzModalService.create, this parameter should be passed into the type of function (callback function). 
> This function returns a promise, which is automatically closed when the execution is complete or the promise ends (return false to prevent closing)<!-- generated by ng-zorro-issue-helper. DO NOT REMOVE -->
