Can Fmask be run on the ARD tiles available from USGS? The folder structure appears to be different.

For example, these are the top-of-atmosphere files I downloaded:

Hi Everyone,

I believe I set everything correctly but when I try to run Fmask I get the following error:
`Fmask_4_0: error while loading shared libraries: libmwlaunchermain.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`


I added the following lines to .profile (also tried .bashrc):
```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v95/runtime/glnxa64:/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v95/bin/glnxa64:/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v95/sys/os/glnxa64:/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v95/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64/native_threads:/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v95/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64/server:/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v95/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64
XAPPLRESDIR=/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v95/X11/app-defaults

PATH=$PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
PATH=$PATH:$XAPPLRESDIR
PATH=$PATH:/usr/GERS/Fmask_4_0/application
```
We use Fmask to process multiple adjacent Sentinel 2 tiles. When there are shadows that would go outside of the tile boundary, we get edges at the tile boundary, like you can see below (white=clouds, grey=shadows, low Sun angle from south-south-east).

An ideal solution would be that Fmask had an option to extend the bounds of the output mask, such that all shadows are included. So the southern tile in the scene below would extend north and overlap with the northern tile. Then, when merging the tiles, we could take care of the shadows nicely.

If I had access to the code, I'd be happy to help implementing this.
Hi,

I have installed the Fmask4.0 Standalone on Ubuntu 14.04.

However, when trying to run the Software I receive the following error:

error while loading shared libraries: libmwlaunchermain.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.

This appears to be a common error across other applications like in the below link:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24004240/matlab-2014a-8-3-compiler-runtime-errors-libmwlaunchermain-so

However, following these instructions, I haven't solved the issue. I'd be really grateful for some help in configuring everything correctly! 

Thanks! 

What are the bare minimum required files to run Fmask, version 4, on a Sentinel 2 tile? Is the entire SAFE structure necessary?
Dear developers.
I need to run fmask_4_0 with clipped images. Do you have anyway?

Thanks and regards,

Mateus





Dear Fmask developer,

I am now using Fmask 4.0  in the Command Prompt, I want to change the default parameters according to Fmask 3.3:

Fmask_4_0 4 6 1 50 

first parameter (4) is the number of pixels dilated for cloud (default is 3)
the second parameter (6) is the number  of pixels dilated for cloud shadow (default is 3)
the third parameter (1) is the number of pixels dilated for snow (default is 0),
 and the last parameter (50) is the cloud probability threshold with default value of 22.5

Then it appeared that Cloud/cloud shadow/snow dileted by 52/54/49 pixels, cloud probability threshold of 53.00%

I would like to ask what is the correct way to set up these parameters.

Thanks and with regards,
Zhongyang
