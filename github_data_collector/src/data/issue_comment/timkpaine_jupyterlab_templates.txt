Hi @timkpaine, thanks for your work on this super useful extension.

I am currently working on a Notebook which uses multiple data files (that I can't get using any API), and some Python modules I have written to keep the workflow more user-friendly (while not polluting the notebook with stuff that could confuse the users).

I'd love to be able to include all of these files in a template (It only has a single `ipynb` file).

I think a great way to do this would be to support the following extensions too: `{"tar", "tar.gz", "zip"}`. Essentially, we could put those files alongside the `ipynb` templates, and if they are selected, extract them instead of simply copying them.

I'd be happy to contribute this in a PR if that sounds like something you'd welcome.
