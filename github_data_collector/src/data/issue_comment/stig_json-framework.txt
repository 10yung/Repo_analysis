This should address @adonoho 's concern in #250.
Two fixes that suppress compiler warnings. The first about repeated use of weak parameters is straightforward to fix properly. Suppressing the warning in the code is not my preferred answer. As this problem existed in both v4 and in v5, I suspect it isn't considered an important issue. The second fix, in light of the effort to ensure correct behavior, is both easy to fix and preserves the intended comparison behavior of unsigned long to unsigned long.
I parsed following data : 
`{"rc":"0","rm":"OK","pi":{"tc":0,"rp":0},"rs":{"c":0}"}`

You can recognize that there is some syntax error at the end of the value. (key is rs)
It supposed to be handling by error handler but SBJason4 doesn't check the error and doesn't return complete or error status. 

```
       SBJson4ValueBlock block = ^(id v, BOOL *stop) {
                  // not here
         };

        SBJson4ErrorBlock eh = ^(NSError* err) {
                 // not here too
        };

        id parser = [SBJson4Parser multiRootParserWithBlock:block
                                               errorHandler:eh];

        // DATA encoded by base64Encode
        [parser parse:[NSData dataWithBase64EncodedString:@"eyJyYyI6IjAiLCJybSI6Ik9LIiwicGkiOnsidGMiOjAsInJwIjowfSwicnMiOnsiYyI6MH0ifQ=="]];
```

does anyone who faced with this issue?
asap please
