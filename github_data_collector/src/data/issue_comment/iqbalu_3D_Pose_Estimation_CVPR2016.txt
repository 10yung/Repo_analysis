Hi- I'm having some issues while running your codes and asking you for a help.
I did compilation and initialization etc, and ran RUN_Iterated.m, then I got error in the line 173:
   [err, optim, opts, motrecOpt] = recOnWeightedKernelH36Mbm(opts);
Err msg said that, in H_mat2cellMot.m, it tries to do substitution as below:
mot.jointTrajectories{i,1}(:,:) = pos(t:t+2,:);
where the 2nd dimension size does not match.

I looked into the codes and found that the 2nd dimension size of mot.jointTrajectories{i,1} and pos are the same as 'motGT.nframes' and 'motIn.nframes' from "motGT_S11_Activity_All_C2.mat" file, which is provided.
motGT.nframes was 928 and changed to 1, while motIn.nframes was 62.
Can you help me with this issue? 
Thanks!
