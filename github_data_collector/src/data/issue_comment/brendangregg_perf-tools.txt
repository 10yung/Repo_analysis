Using iosnoop output BYTES！Where does the bytes size of the output come from? Can this be adjusted?
It's not compatible with `ash` because of using some bash-specific syntax.
First, thank you for his tool.
I'm profiling an application that spends 20% of its time in system calls. With the option -c I have the list with the topmost frequent syscalls. It would be also helpful to have them sorted by time spent within them.
This makes admittedly clumsy use of substr() to avoid being dependent on the three-argument form of match() which is only supported by gawk.
Huge fan here! your tools are so useful and I learn a lot from the code itself so thanks for making them and putting them here for all of us to enjoy.

This is just a small adjustment to set tracing_on to 1 (and disable it when done) in `execsnoop`, perhaps there was a good reason not to have this in place, but this helped me get some results :smile: 

if this is not a good idea, maybe a note of this in the help section/README.

iolatency is broken case of not open tracing_{on,enabled} switches rightly

I seeing what slab used 14 GB memory, it's not normal. 
I have second node, but them slab's having size 1.6Gb. 
Maybe something now, why can slab have  big size ? 
 
Hi Brendan Gregg:
@brendangregg when i perf record or perf top -p pid 
Error:
The sys_perf_event_open() syscall returned with 3 (No such process) for event (cycles:ppp).
/bin/dmesg may provide additional information.
No CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS=y kernel support configured?

but Not for all of the process
@brendangregg hi，I admire you for a long time,but now i have a question that When I am with 'perf record' ,it is over before the sleep time was reached,and did not show any information. the flame graph shows: Unrecognized line: Was the 'perf record' command properly terminated?The at FlameGraph/stackcollapse - perf. Pl line 339, < > the line 2. 
Can you give me some advice?
