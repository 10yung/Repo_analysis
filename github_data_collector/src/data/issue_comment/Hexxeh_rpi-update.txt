Adding information for also downloading pi 4 firmware
Hello

i want to reinstall the same firmware i have in my raspberry and not a newer/beta one

how can i do it? 

and how can i install a specific firmware revision?

thanks
When there is a backup available (and no internet connection is available), `rpi-update` should have an option to easily restore this backup. For example the option `--restore-backup` could trigger this.

When a backup is being made, the local tree of files for `/boot/` and for `/lib/modules/` (before the backup is being made) should be stored somewhere. Probably in `/boot.bak/.files` and `/lib/modules.bak/.files` . Before a backup is being restored, the local paths stored in these files should exist under `/boot.bak/` and under `/lib/modules.bak/`.

This would ensure that restoring a backup will place back at least the files that were there. Restoring additional files should not be a problem, but restoring when files are missing should not be possible and an error should be reported on which files are missing.

After restoring a backup, the new backup should be the version from which the backup was triggered. When a backup has been restored, the `.files` files from that backup should be deleted.

Implementing this feature would allow not so technical savvy users to perform a restore of a backup easily and safely, especially when no internet connection is available. One of the reasons no internet connection is available, is upgrading to a firmware version that breaks internet functionality.

Additionally, `rpi-update --help` should explain all features:
- no arguments
- firmware revision argument in terms of a git hash
- `--restore-backup` argument
- `--help` argument
- `--version` argument
Hello I run PiServer and when I start raspberry it stuck  on boot after rpi-update can I rollback on previus kernel
This allows to skip the partition size check when installing PI4 files. I've also took the chance to update the README file.
ref https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update/commit/882f5c188dce31365885c8ff23724749294bf8c1

`check_partition` addition is causing issues on usecases where rpi-update is used to build distributions: in such case destination may be a simple directory rather than a partition per say.
Could this check be done in a "softer" manner, to play nice with such usecases?

Would be nice if `WANT_PI4` usage is explained in `README.md` expert options too.
Thanks for consideration.

"Would you like to proceed?" does not accept "y".
Like apt-get install X -y this tool need a flag for automatic updates like Ansible o similar software.

I try to update Raspberry firmware and my Ansible play fail because rpi-update promp for a major update in the kernel.
It would seem like a good idea to set /var/run/reboot-required if a reboot is required, no?  This would mirror the logic apt-get establishes.
