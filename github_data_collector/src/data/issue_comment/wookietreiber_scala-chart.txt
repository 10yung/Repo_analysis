Is it possible to plot 2 horizontal lines (y=cte1, y=cte2) and a series value in the same chart?
What would be the easiest way to create a density plot using scala-chart?

In jfree-chart I found this:
http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/api/javadoc/org/jfree/chart/renderer/xy/XYBlockRenderer.html
I'm more familiar with R; and have been struggling to figure out how to make a simple histogram/category chart.

Lets say I have a sequence of probabilities, trials, represented as a `Seq[Int]` in Scala, or numeric vector in R. 

I've tried  `val chart = CategoryChart(trials, "trials", legend = false)`, but can't seem to get any results. 

In R, I would use `hist(trials, xlab="x-axis", ylab="y-axis")`
Does scala-chart provide a wrapper for JFreeChart `TimeSeries`?

For X values, these types do not work:
- java.lang.Long
- java.math.BigInteger

``` scala
// fail to compile:
val d1 = for (i <- 1 to 5) yield (new java.lang.Long(i), i.toDouble)
val d2 = for (i <- 1 to 5) yield (new java.lang.Long(i), i)
val d3 = for (i <- 1 to 5) yield (new java.math.BigInteger(i.toString), i.toDouble)
```

These work:

``` scala
// compiles:
 val data1 = for (i <- 1 to 5) yield (new java.lang.Integer(i), i)
 val data2 = for (i <- 1 to 5) yield (new java.lang.Double(i), i)
 val data3 = for (i <- 1 to 5) yield (new java.lang.Float(i), i)
 val data4 = for (i <- 1 to 5) yield (i.toDouble,i.toDouble)
 val data5 = for (i <- 1 to 5) yield (new BigInt(new java.math.BigInteger(i.toString)), i.toDouble)
 val data6 = for (i <- 1 to 5) yield (i.toLong, i) ; XYLineChart(data).show()
 val data7 = for (i <- 1 to 5) yield (new java.util.Date(new java.lang.Long(i)), i)
```

Hi @wookietreiber,
It is possible to customize the x-axis values? I am generating a XYLineChart with values of a whole week hours (180 values). Instead of showing 10-10 intervals I would like to show hours and ideally also days, something like:

1,2,3,...23,24,1,2,3...,23,24,....
   Monday          Tuesday...

Hi @wookietreiber,
It is possible to get data from selected area?
I found some example in java http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16105277/jfreechart-select-an-area-without-zooming
Cheers,
