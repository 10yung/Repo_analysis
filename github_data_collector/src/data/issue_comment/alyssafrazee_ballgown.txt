I am using a ballgown R package to Run the differential expression analysis. Following is my pheno data example. I have two conditions and 3 replicates.

```
ids      Treatment cell
sample1  drug1   wt1C7
sample2  drug1   wt1C7
sample3  drug1   wt1C7
sample4  drug2   pv1ko
sample5  drug2   pv1ko
sample6  drug2   pv1ko
```
```
pheno_data = read.csv("phenodata.csv")
bg = ballgown(dataDir = "ballgown", samplePattern = "sample", pData=pheno_data)
bg_filt = subset(bg,"rowVars(texpr(bg)) > 1",genomesubset=TRUE)
results_transcripts = stattest(bg_filt, feature="transcript", covariate="cell", adjustvars = c("Treatment"), getFC=TRUE, meas="FPKM")
```
```
I am getting an error when I run the following command.
results_transcripts = stattest(bg_filt, feature="transcript", covariate="cell", adjustvars = c("Treatment"), getFC=TRUE, meas="FPKM")
```
```
```
Error message : 
Error in solve.default(t(mod) %*% mod) : 
  system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 7.38788e-28
In addition: Warning message:
Partial NA coefficients for 20083 probe(s) 
```
```
Could anyone please help me to solve the above error?

It is not clear how to subset the ballgown instance based on phenotypic data.  The examples in ``subset`` documentation do not provide a clear example.  Let's say the data consists of 18 samples as follows:

```
pheno

      sample lifestage cond
1  samp01     adult  con
2  samp02     adult  con
3  samp03     adult  con
4  samp04     adult  trt
5  samp05     adult  trt
6  samp06     adult  trt
7  samp07       old  con
8  samp08       old  con
9  samp09       old  con
10 samp10       old  trt
11 samp11       old  trt
12 samp12       old  trt
13 samp13       ped  con
14 samp14       ped  con
15 samp15       ped  con
16 samp16       ped  trt
17 samp17       ped  trt
18 samp18       ped  trt

```

I want to do a pairwise comparison between adult control and adult treatment.  But I can't figure out how to subset the data.

```
adult <- subset(bg, 'lifestage == "adult"', genomesubset=FALSE)

subset must be logical

```
Hi, 

I am using ballgown for differential expression to data from Stringtie, but by just loading the data by this command 
bg = ballgown(dataDir = "ballgown", samplePattern = "RNAseq", pData=pheno_data)
I got the following error and I couldn't solve this problem so far.
the error :
Error in scan(file = file, what = what, sep = sep, quote = quote, dec = dec,  : 
  line 554 did not have 12 elements

Please Help
Hi, I use stringtie to calculate the gene-level expression (stringtie -A ./panDRR163659/panDRR163659.gene_abund -e -B -p 8 -G ARS-UCD1.2.gtf -o ./ panDRR163659/DRR163659.gtf DRR163659.bam). But I found this was quite different from the gene expression calculated by ballgown.

cat ballgown.2.r
library(ballgown)
bg_chrX <- ballgown(dataDir ="/home/panxy/FWW/chicken/", samplePattern ="pan",meas="all")
a<-gexpr(bg_chrX)
write.table(a, file="/chicken/gene_FPKM_chicken.259.txt",sep="\t",quote=FALSE)
 
Can you tell me which calculation is correct and why it makes this difference?

Thank you for your time.

I want to plot expression of one transcript in  several samples at once I have run this command
`plotTranscripts('TraesCS1B02G048400', bg_chrX, samples=c('G1', 'G2', 'G3', 'G4'),meas='FPKM', colorby='transcript')`

The error got is

Error in seq.default(min(gtrans$start), max(gtrans$end), by = 1) :

'from' must be a finite number

In addition: Warning messages:

1: In min(gtrans$start) : no non-missing arguments to min; returning Inf

2: In max(gtrans$end) : no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf



kindly tell me how to resolve it .
Hello everyone, 
I'm facing a problem with ballgown that I'm not able to solve by my self .. 

here the command that I use 


pheno_data = read.csv(file ="phenotype.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")
samples <- c("sample1",sample2,.....sample8)
pf_rna<-ballgown(dataDir=file.path("ballgown/"), samplePattern = samples, pData=pheno_data)

and here is the output

Do you have any suggestion to why it doesn't like the pData?

Thank you 

Hi , 
I run this and its working properly .But i also want to add ENST ids .
What is understand is to change "geneNames"  to the name allocated by ballgown to transcripts id in this syntax---  t_name =ballgown::geneNames(bg_chrX).
I am able to get that name .Can you please help me for this . 

Code I am using -----

```
results_transcripts = stattest(bg_chrX, feature="transcript",covariate="Condition", getFC=TRUE, meas="FPKM")

results_transcripts = data.frame(geneNames=ballgown::geneNames(bg_chrX), geneIDs=ballgown::geneIDs(bg_chrX), results_transcripts)

```
I  have use the ballgown for differential gene expression. 
I have the six sample in my data set. The final list of differential gene expression obtain from the ballgown contain no sample name from which I can calculate the  number of DE gene in corresponding samples.
how I can  get the information number of differential expressed genes in one  sample and so in second , third and so on .
 


Hello,

Thank you working on this tool, it's quite useful. However, I've not been able to generate plots using plotTranscript using the master 2.53 version nor the devel branch for ATRX that has multiple transcripts in my ballgown input files from stringtie.

I'm using plotTranscripts(gene='MSTRG.50466', gown=bg2, meas='FPKM',samples = 'sample1', colorby='transcript') where 'MSTRG.50466 is the ATRX geneID from stringTie.
Error in smalldat[, colIndex] : incorrect number of dimensions

 Using the same command I'm able to generate the plots from the examples. Is there something I've missed or is there a work-around? 

Hi I am using the ballgown package . I have encountered error.The script is  
`> results_transcripts = stattest(bg_chrX_filt, feature="transcript",covariate="cultivars", getFC=TRUE, meas="FPKM", timecourse = TRUE)
`
The error was as 

> Error in (1 - h) * qs[i] : non-numeric argument to binary operator
