hi
is an option for change text direction?
for example, see this image
![noty-text-direction](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30490118/71246015-29cba800-232b-11ea-85eb-d7e8a6a6e9bc.png)
as you see the text is aligned to left but I want to align it to right. but I have no option for this and also I test custom CSS but it's not working.
```
.noty_layout{
  direction: rtl;
}
OR
.noty_body{
  direction: rtl;
}
```
Sorry, this is probably a pretty stupid question.. but i can't figure out how to setMaxVisible
in main.js? before or after Vue.use? in App.vue:created() ?
none of that works, so it has to be something i missed?

thanks for any answers :)

Instead of showing the newly created noty with a .show() method call immediately after executing the creation statement, I assign the new noty result to window.n:  **`window.n = new Noty( ... );`**
Then I call the show method in a button click: **`<button onclick="n.show();">Show It</button>`**
However, if I click the button another time, nothing happens.  Since the noty object persists, there should be a way to redisplay previously 'added' messages..  So to work-around this I added two property assignments to the afterClose callback, which when uncommented do allow the show method to re-display an existing message.  It would be nice if this could be either documented, an optional parameter added to show method, i.e., 'reshow', or a new method created, i.e., reshow() to make this easier.

The reason for this is on my web-page, I want to show an button to redisplay Noty messages that have been shown and then hidden after timing-out, but I'd rather not recreate the message, especially when a message is created by the server and then displayed when the page first loaded, because the page doesn't have easy access to the anonymous function that displayed the message.

By the way how can I change the `$(document).ready( function() { Noty({...}); } );` code that is placed in my html page by the php code on my server to `$(document).ready( function() { window.n = new Noty({...}); } );` so that I can make the `window.n.show();` method call I discussed, above?

I have noty installed via npm. 

This is my app.scss.

    // Noty alert
    @import "~noty/src/noty.scss";
    @import "~noty/src/themes/mint.scss";

This is my bootstrap.js

    window.Noty = require("noty");

This is where am using it. In a vuejs component;

     created() {
       new Noty({
        layout: "top",
        theme: "defaultTheme",
        text: "Order received !",
        type: "success"
      }).show();
      }

In case you want to add a [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) theme: https://gist.github.com/i5ar/92e64e7236996e712bfb8b3218a33293

Thank you.
It seems as though the callback for onClick is not valid in TypeScript, and it is throwing an error at compile time. I would really love to use the onClick if possible.
