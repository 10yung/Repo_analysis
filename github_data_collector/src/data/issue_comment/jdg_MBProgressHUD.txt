I set animation MBProgressHUDAnimationZoomIn but it works when disappearing,rather than appearing
The progress indicator is not centered when the HUD control is shown in iOS 13

The HUD usually, apart from showing progress, is also used to block user interaction while an operation is in progress. However, how the `graceTime` is handled currently, it's not possible to block the interaction during this grace period. The implementatio keeps the HUD's root view alpha at 0 until the view is actually being shown thus the implicit behaviour of iOS where views with alpha 0 pass through touches is in effect.

Since the content of the HUD is in subviews (backgroundView, bezelView etc.) and those views are seperatelly faded in, there really is no need for setting the root view alpha to 0. Removing the three lines that manipulate the root view's alpha seems to not break any existing behaviour but enables proper input blocking in all cases.
Hi!

With this PR I fixed several behavior bugs and added a test for these cases.

They are:

1. If you try to hide a hud without animation, the `alpha` value for the `backgroundView` will be equal to `1.0` while it must be equal to `0.0`
2. If you have a hud with an animation type set to `MBProgressHUDAnimationZoomIn` and you hide this hud animatedly, trying to show it non-animated will end up in having a transform applied to the hub as a result of animated hide which is undesirable behavior.
A popup should not fill the whole width of the screen. Thanks

I think that [_progressTintColor set] should be [_progressTintColor setStroke] at drawRect function 

Getting error on Ad Hoc export:

Failed to verify bitcode in MBProgressHUD.framework error: Platform iOS is not supported.

Any ideas? I've tried turning bitcode on and off.
