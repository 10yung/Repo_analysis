Hi,
i'd like to make a little multiplayer game over the net and player of a same team should exchange
with a kind of email but on local server.

I also need notification to say when a kingdom is being attacked (no broadcast here).

It's difficult for me to display on all clients in real time who is connected just now ( only the very last connected player has the full list, if the other players refresh, the connections are destroyed).

Can you make something about it ?
Thank you so much, your tuto is very clear !
When switching between pages in Flaskblog and the home page features more posts than can be seen in the current browser size, the navigation bar contents will "flick" to the left when the browser's vertical scroll bar appears.   One possible solution is using overflow-y in main.css:

html {
    overflow-y:scroll;
}
Updated the script so that it could scrap complete list of names from csv file.
One line is missing from Django_Blog/13-Deployment-Linode/django_project/django_project/urls.py:
urlpatterns += static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)

If i wanted to change the default width of username text field in the user registration form ,how can i acheive this ?
hey,

I created a file with all the explanation of random in python

Hi team, 

I tried to update main.css for navigation bar background to dark grey, but it is not working, it is still showing steel blue. 

original: 

.bg-steel {
  background-color: #5f788a;
}

updated to: 

.bg-steel {
  background-color: #666666;
}

Thank you, 
Ling
I am getting the image url as https://django-aws-file.s3.amazonaws.com/profile_pics/Screenshot_from_2019-08-30_13-12-46_qCECn43.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIA3CDNJCNZRJPPRTD2&Signature=lAhnNX%2Fe0jPVvDYnoI4HMp%2B5se0%3D&Expires=1572514292
instead of the one mentioned in AWS like this: https://django-aws-file.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/profile_pics/bb1.png
How can we resolve it?
