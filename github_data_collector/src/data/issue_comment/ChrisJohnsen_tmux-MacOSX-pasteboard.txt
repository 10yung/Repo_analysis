It seems like this issue is back again in Mojave https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard/issues/43

I can try to debug further, but with http://github.com/keith/contacts-cli I'm unable to access contacts from inside tmux.
Since https://github.com/tmux/tmux/commit/78352fdd328b611d935ba051288191b33278cc4a and [release 2.6](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/8aaf86a6ead9852631342d0d2d526a7eaede15cf/CHANGES#L66) `reattach-to-user-namespace` trick doesn't seem to be needed.

```shell
$ echo "test" | pbcopy
$ pbpaste
test
```
It works with any alpha characters. But fail to copy `hello 你好` from Neovim to system pasteboard. The pasteboard get a zero-character copy.

It only fail in Tmux. When I open the Neovim in a bare terminal, it works well with Chinese.

Versions
- Neovim 0.1.7
- Tmux 2.3
- iTerm2 Build 3.0.15
- OSX 10.11.6 (15G1217)
Observed whilst attempting to use Python Openstack client. 

It would appear that installing the `reattach-to-user-namespace` bottle with the `--with-wrap-pbcopy-and-pbpaste` causes the Openstack client to hang. 

An example of the stack trace is [here](https://gist.github.com/fatmcgav/5c84529f6fd7bd2604732880b4e10204#file-openstack-debug-output-L39), with the relevant line highlighted. 
Running `pbcopy -help` on the CLI also results in a hang.

Running the system `pbcopy` directly works. 
E.g.:
>/usr/bin/pbcopy -help
2017-02-24 14:58:32.265 pbcopy[12486:7664884] Usage: pbcopy [-help]

Thoughts?
I am attempting to run both emacs and tmux and am having a real hard time getting copy/paste (kill/yank) to work right:

the relevant sections of my tmux config:

```
set-option -g mouse on
set-option -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l bash"
setw -g mode-keys emacs
bind-key -n -t emacs-copy M-w copy-pipe "reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy"
bind-key -n C-y run "xclip -o | tmux load-buffer - ; tmux paste-buffer"
```

And of my emacs config:

```
(setq x-select-enable-clipboard t x-select-enable-primary t)
```

This has the following effects:

1) I can copy and paste in my tmux with emacs buttons (`M-w`, `C-y`)

2) Whenever I attempt to select a region in my emacs (with `C-Space` for example), it also selects my line number from `linum-mode`

3) I can copy things that I select with my mouse inside emacs into my system clipboard AND the kill ring( e.g. selecting text with my mouse and hitting `M-w` causes me to be able to past in my browser/other applications with `Command+V` (I'm on a Mac) AND in emacs/tmux with `C-y`) 

4) Selecting a region (with problem 2 baked in to boot) with `C-Space` and using either `C-w` or `M-w`, or just killing with `C-k` does not result in pastable result, either in the kill ring, or on the system clipboard.

Is there any way to fix problems 2/4 without getting rid of desirable properties 1/3?

Thanks so much!

I'm using [pure prompt](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) with [this](https://gist.github.com/srustamo/93b9b9fc16bde207d80b) `.zshrc`.

Adding `set-option -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l zsh` to my [.tmux.conf](https://gist.github.com/srustamo/04934232a6a33268722bbda9c429c178) makes the prompt char `❯` disappear in `tmux` zsh session.

There is no problem with the prompt outside of `tmux`. Why would this happen?

OSX 10.9.5, zsh 5.2 (x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0)

Despite this note's fucking important, too small to be noticed!

Actually I'd have trouble with the plugin that cannot copy buffer over 767 bytes until I stop using it.

I am using mac ox 10.10.2.

After installing tmux-pasteboard the normal cut-and-paste behavior has changed.  I can no longer use ctrl-c and ctrl-v to cut-and-paste among terminal and other mac GUI app (safari for example)

Uninstalling tmux-pasteboard also failed to restore original behavior.  Really really need help as I cannot really use the terminal effectively now.

I've been using tmux and reattach-to-user-namespace for a long time now (thanks a lot for your work!) and the combination worked flawlessly, until my upgrade to Yosemite. Now I get this error, when trying to `open` a URL (this is inside a tmux session):

```
% reattach-to-user-namespace -v
reattach-to-user-namespace version 2.3
    Supported OSes: OS X 10.5-10.10
% open http://www.google.com
LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -600 for the URL http://www.google.com.
% echo 'foobar' | pbcopy
% foobar
```

My [tmux configuration](https://github.com/mrnugget/dotfiles/blob/d83ff81635519b6469064f760a30af59200e8a11/tmux.conf) contains this line:

```
set-option -g default-command "which reattach-to-user-namespace >/dev/null && reattach-to-user-namespace -l $SHELL || $SHELL"
```

And that works with `pbcopy` and `pbpaste`, but fails with `open`.

The `open` commands also works outside of tmux.

Now, I'm not too sure if this project is the right place for this issue, but it seems like that [every](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3093) [other](https://github.com/kyanny/ghn/issues/30) [issue](https://github.com/github/hub/issues/687) recommends looking at reattach-to-usre-namespace.

I already had that installed and in use for a long time, I'm on the latest version too, so I thought I'd open this issue to see if we can get to the bottom of this.

If you need any more information, please tell me!

When I boot up tmux, I'm getting this message:

warning: reattach-to-user-namespace: unsupported new OS, trying as if it were 10.6-10.9
warning: _vprocmgr_move_subset_to_user failed
warning: reattach-to-user-namespace: unable to reattach

The issue arose when I upgraded to Yosemite.
