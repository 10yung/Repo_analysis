Hi, 
could you please explain what does this piece of code do? why should we use Boolean masking?
    x = max(df['Gold'] - df['Gold.1'])
    ans = df[(df['Gold'] - df['Gold.1']) == x].index.tolist()

and why doesn't something like this work?
    ans = df[max(df['Gold']-df['Gold.1'])].index.tolist()
  
and what does this do?
     .index.tolist()

Thanks in advance.

Did you get stuck on Assignment 4 convert_housing_data_to_quarters() as well?
