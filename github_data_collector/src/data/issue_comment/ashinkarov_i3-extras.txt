`scrot` >= 1.0 requires `-o` switch to be able to write into already existing temporary files
- note currenlty only works nicely when title_align=left (default);
  could be modified to support centered- and right alignment, but not
  going to for the sake of keeping the patch as simple as possible.

Since you already have `imagemagick` you should have both `convert` and `import`. You can easily use `import` in place of `scrot` with a line like `import -window root $file1 < /dev/null`. The `< /dev/null` bit is there because import can also be used to click and drag to collect only a portion of the screen, but with `-window root` we are getting the entire current desktop.

I've been using this myself since I didn't want to mess with scrot and it seems possibly slightly faster, but probably a false impression.
Just so the next person does not start looking for it:

The patch 'smart borders' for i3 is actually somewhat already in the main i3 package included.

you can use it via the option

`hide_edge_borders none|vertical|horizontal|both|smart`

As described here:
https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html

So need to compile it your self.

Rebasing and xbm-icon gcc-higher-opt patches to version 4.12.

Hello,

I don't expect anyone to work on this, just wanted to point out than the [latest i3 release](https://i3wm.org/downloads/RELEASE-NOTES-4.12.txt) breaks the specified patch.

It seems like this time it will require a fair amount of work to rebase it, my attempt to compile i3 with the patch fails with the following errors:

Bests

It is worth noting that the `cwd-exec.patch` relies on the path being set (and updated) in the `_NET_WM_NAME` property, which has to be configured manually (see for example [Bash#Customize title](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bash#Customize_title) on ArchWiki).

Second note is that `:` is used as a delimiter separating the path from other text (e.g. terminal name). As a result, the patch does not work with paths containing the delimiter character.

Final note is for everybody who would think of different approach: One could think that another approach is to find out the PID of the active window and resolve the `/proc/<pid>/cwd/` symlink to get the path where new process should be spawned. Unfortunately this does not work because the CWD of the terminal process (parent) remains constant and only the CWD of the shell process (child) changes.
