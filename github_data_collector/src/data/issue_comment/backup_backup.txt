I have tested this in a production system on ubuntu 18, ruby 2.5.7
Hi, this commit fix the problem with "*** WARNING : deprecated key derivation used" Using -iter or -pbkdf2 would be better."
The discussion is here:

## What went wrong?

I'm getting deprecation warnings with openSSL encryption.

[2019/09/05 08:38:52][info] Using Encryptor::OpenSSL to encrypt the archive.

## What steps did you follow?

1. backup perform --trigger config
2. Check the log output

## How is your copy of backup configured?

Use config encryption step:

  encrypt_with OpenSSL do |encryption|
    encryption.password = 'Some password'
    encryption.base64   = true
    encryption.salt     = true
  end

## Tell us about the computer that runs the backup gem

* Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS
* Backup 4.4.1
* openssl version OpenSSL 1.1.1  11 Sep 2018

## What went wrong?

I have this error message twice a day, every time the backup local storage is running.
The first time I encountered this, I checked the filesystem and there was no folder matching the one the script is trying to delete. 
I deleted all folders from the "15.07.2019" date manually. But everyday, it keeps trying to delete this folder. And so, rotation is not executed: all backup runs successfully and stored. 

It seems (I need to double-check it) that the rotation is working. I never have more than 60 backups stored, which respect my script config (58 actually). But I still received twice a day (backup is twice a day) the warning about this delete.

```
[2019/08/30 12:05:52][warn] Storage::Cycler::Error: There was a problem removing the following package:

```

## How is your copy of backup configured?

I do a simple mysql backup that works perfectly. Problem is with the rotation. 
```
 compress_with Gzip do |compression|
    compression.level = 8
    compression.rsyncable = true
 end
 
 store_with Local do |local|
  local.path = '/mnt/kauf6-backup-storage-1/database/'
  # Use a number or a Time object to specify how many backups to keep.
  local.keep = 60
end
```
## Tell us about the computer that runs the backup gem

Linux OS. I have a remote linux server that run the script, and connect to my "servers to backup" to back them up. The "production" servers are not running the backup scripts, it's a specific and dedicated server. 

* Operating system: Debian latest
* Tools or services used by backup: MySQL 5.7
* Backup v4.4.1
* Ruby: ruby 2.3.3p222 (2016-11-21 revision 56859) [x86_64-linux]


## question

Is there any place where Backup keep tracks of the backup folder names to delete/rotate them? 
Is the script using folder timestamps (meta) to select the one to deletes? 

Thanks a lot for this really cool package anyway. 

```ruby
  encrypt_with GPG do |encryption|
    encryption.keys = {}
    encryption.passphrase = 'secret passphrase'
    # encryption.mode = :both
    encryption.mode = :symmetric
  end
```
But running `backup perform --trigger my_backup` prompt passphrase windown, not using `secret passphrase`.

Why?

Because as of version 2 of GPG, the option `--batch` is needed to ensure no prompt. as can be read in the manual.

> If this command is used with --batch, --pinentry-mode has been set to  loopback,  and  one  of  the  passphrase  options  (--passphrase,
>               --passphrase-fd,  or  passphrase-file)  is  used, the supplied passphrase is used for the new key and the agent does not ask for it.  To
>               create a key without any protection --passphrase '' may be used.

How I fixed it:

just added the `--batch` flag:
In `lib/backup/encryptor/gpg.rb`, `symmetric_options` method:
changed
`"-c --passphrase-file '#{path}'"`
to
`"-c --batch --passphrase-file '#{path}'"`

My gpg version: `gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.12`
When I'm trying to restore a postgresql database with a dump file in a .tar format I get a `pg_restore: [tar archiver] could not find header for file "toc.dat" in tar archive`. Upon inspecting the tar file with `tar -tvf db_tarball.tar` the list of files does not include the file "toc.dat". I believe that this prevents me from performing a pg_restore.

## How to replicate?

1. gem install backup 
2. generate backup config and model
3. trigger a backup perfrom
4. pg_restore -c -U username -d database -v "/path/to/file" 
Run into the "toc.dat" not found error

This is how the database block looks like 
``` db.name               = ENV["POSTGRESQL_DATABASE"]
    db.username           = ENV["POSTGRESQL_USERNAME"]
    db.password           = ENV["POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD"]
    db.host               = ENV["api_host"]
    db.port               = 5432
    db.additional_options = ["-xc", "-E=utf8"]```

My config file is the out-of-the-box everything commented file. 

* Operating system: MacOS 10.14 Mojave
* Ruby version: 2.5.0
* Tools or services used by backup: PostgreSQL 10.5

Hi,

I was thinking of making my own solution when I found this project. Too bad it's not under development anymore but I'm glad to see it is working.

I have a question to which I can't find an answer: does this support getting files from an FTP? I feel like FTP is only used to store the final backup files, but what I would like to do is to backup WordPress websites with it, uploaded files in particular. It seems like only databases are supported, but hopefully, I am wrong? This is so close to perfect.

Thanks for your answers :)
This PR is a replacement for https://github.com/backup/backup/pull/922.

I investigated about the strange warns reported into the previous PR and with `ruby-2.5` the `Thread.report_on_exception` default value changed from `false` to `true` so this is the main reason about these strange warns.

Digging into it I discovered that the warns were generated by a stubbed exception into a [spec](https://github.com/dalpo/backup/blob/615ddaba98ed80978a56cb588cdacc5593265741/spec/support/shared_examples/syncer/cloud.rb#L360) which was trying to simulate a network error.
Note: Now I've muted the warns only for this single spec.

So there isn't any issue with ruby-2.5 and it seems working correctly. 
I have added compressor "Parallel BZIP2" (pbzip2) for making use of multiple cores when compressing backups.

Tested on Ubuntu Linux 18.04LTS and ruby 2.4.3p205 (2017-12-14 revision 61247) [x86_64-linux].
