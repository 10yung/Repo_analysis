Hi!

I am having the same issue as this one: https://github.com/Anthony25/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized/issues/63

Is it possible that it happens because I am using Ubuntu 18.04 and GNOME Terminal 3.28.2?

Thank you!

After install I got dark username in shell, but on PC it's blue and looks nice. But PS1 equal. 
So because the 9th color in the palette is Base03 which is the same as the background, so now in a lot of my log outputs or test results and so on, that color is used..

The issue is that I can change that color in the palette but then my vim background color is that same color because of the fact that when you do background=dark in VIM, it seems to use that 9th color in the palette..

Any ideas on how I can handle both cases?
