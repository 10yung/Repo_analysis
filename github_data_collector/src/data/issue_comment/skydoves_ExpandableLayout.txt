**Please complete the following information:**
- Library Version 1.0.3
- Affected Device(s) Generic device
 
I'm using this library inside a recyclerview. Each item in the recyclerview can be expanded, but the content of each item can vary, so the height is different for each item. The library seems to calculate the height for each item, however the height is not correct. For each item is always less the the real layout size.

**Expected Behavior:**

Since the content of each item is dynamic, the library should expose a method that can re mesure the height of the second layout.

Data-binding is not working, please suggest a working data-binding code for this UI
