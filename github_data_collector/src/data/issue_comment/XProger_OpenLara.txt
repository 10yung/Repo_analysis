1. ~In the original game, every time you run into a wall while pressing Action, Lara don’t crash into the wall (I mean, when Lara wit the wall with her arms and say: Uhhh!!!). When playing OpenLara, it doesn’t matter if you are pressing Action. Every time you run into a wall, Lara chashes into it.
For example, in the original game, if you run into a climbable wall while pressing action, Lara runs into the wall, stops in front of the wall (with no crashing) and automatically climbs it. With openlara, Lara crash into the wall before climb it.~

2. Changing direction problems. When you press A (switch version) Lara changes direction by rotating her body into the floor. So, the main issue here is when you change de direction when you are in a square platform. For example, in the original game, if you climb on a gym box or any block or square platform, and you are standing in the edge, when you press Circle (PSX version), Lara makes the “direction change” animation into the oposite edge of the block, and she keeps standing ON the block. That means that you can change the direction standing on a block without falling down. If you do this with OpenLara, Lara changes the direction into the oposite edge and FALLS down. You have to press Action to avoid Lara falling. So, the problem here may not be the “change direction” action itself…. maybe the problem is the Lara start position on the block. I mean that if you climb on the block, Lara is not standing on the very edge of this block…. I can notice that Lara is standing a little foward… maybe that’s the reason why Lara falls down when the “change direction” animation ends.

3. Enemies are not too aggressive. Playing OpenLara I can notice that enemies are in a….. ¿easy mode?

4. ~Two player mode error. When you play the LAST OpenLara version for switch, multiplayer mode is not working well. When you press the 2 player stick to start the multiplayer mode, the screen goes black for player 1, and in the player 2 screen, graphics are not shown well.
This problems are not present in last versions of OpenLara for Switch.~

5. Using the “change direcion” action to avoid hurting Lara. In the original game, if you fall from a high platform and you expect several damage to Lara, if you keep pressing Circle button (psx) while Lara is taking contact with the floor, you take less damage. This is useful because you can keep Lara alive in a lot of accidental falling situations. AND, the “changing direction” animation starts JUST when Lara touches the floor. With OpenLara this is not working like that. If you fall from a high platform and you keep pressing A (switch), Lara doesn’t makes the “change direction” animation when touches the floor, and of course, she doesn’t avoid hurting.

6. Bad button combination to enter First Person View mode. Some advanced players need to use the guns while using the Look button. So, with openlara is impossible to do that, because if you are pressing L with the guns in Lara’s hands, you cannot use the guns because if you try to do it, you enter into First Person View mode. I think a better button combination should be L+R.
When holding down X around this area in Tomb of Qualopec (the highest point in the corridor just before the second switch, in the room with the movable platforms), Lara behaves as if she's standing in front of a push/pullable block, even when she's not anywhere near a wall. Pushing up or down doesn't seem to do anything anywhere in the bugged area

I have a couple of test levels which were created in DXTre3D. This is the only editor capable to create levels for anything other than TR4. These levels just crashed OL. Seems like this is the same bug which was already fixed in OT years ago. Look here for explanation: https://github.com/opentomb/OpenTomb/issues/367
I've seen that occasionally when rats went inside movable blocks or puma went through walls in narrow places. Also, rats can climb on top of movable blocks.
Lara can shoot through walls. Looks like this can happen at steep angles. It can be seen if she faced the first opened door in _St. Francis' Folly_ but stands below it. When gorillas are above her on a ladder she sometimes shoots through walls and kills them. You need to keep pressing ACTION so she still targets them even when she can't see them.
In _St. Francis' Folly_ pushing (not pulling) block towards first door doesn't properly trigger camera switch.
It seems to me that enemies know far later that Lara's nearby, and when they're alerted they don't immediatley run right at her like in the original, half the time they even run away from her. Even the T-Rex isn't a real threat that way
In original Lara can't grab the opposite ledge from standing jump (she can in OL) and in OL she stumbles over the edge if she takes running jump instead.

P.S. That classic OT bug. Yes I know it's extremely hard to fix and won't expect it to happen any time soon, but there should be a place for this bug nevertheless.
