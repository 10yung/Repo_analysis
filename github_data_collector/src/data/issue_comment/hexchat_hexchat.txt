Currently Marker messages - "Marker line reset manually.", "Marker line never set.", and maybe some others - are displayed in the "Foreground" color (set in Settings > Preferences > Interface > Colors), which makes them blend with what people say in the channel.
To avoid that it would be useful to have a separate Text Event for those messages.

HexChat 2.14.3.
Select "Settings > Preferences > Interface > Colors" and click on any color, "Select color" dialogue appears. Click on the eyedropper button, the mouse pointer changes to an eyedropper, but it looks broken in half, making it difficult to select a color.

HexChat 2.14.3,
Windows 10 Home 1803.

Hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> opens the Find dialogue where the user can type some text and move forward to the next occurrence of the text with <kbd>Enter</kbd> in case the input field is in focus. It would be useful to also have a quick shortcut for moving backwards to the previous occurrence, perhaps <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> would do?

HexChat 2.14.3

I'm using the "Windows 7+ 32bit Installer" version of HexChat 2.14.3 from https://dl.hexchat.net/hexchat/HexChat%202.14.3%20x86.exe under Windows 10 Home 1803.

The problem is, pressing Esc only closes certain HexChat windows.

For example, some windows where Esc works:
1. "Select a Plugin or Script to load" (HexChat > Load Plugin or Script)
2. "Character Chart" (Window > Character Chart).
3. "About HexChat" (Help > About)

Some ones where it doesn't:
1. "Network List - HexChat" (HexChat > Network List)
2. "Preferences - HexChat" (Settings > Preferences)
3. "Edit Events" (Settings > Text Events).
Suppose the user is a channel op, "Show icons for user modes" (Preferences > Interface > User list) is unchecked and "Show user mode icon in nick box" (Preferences > Interface > Input box) is checked.

What happens now: the nickname is the nick box has no prefix at all.

What I think should happen: the nickname in the nick box should be prefixed with a "@" (just like it is in the user list). Also, "Show user mode icon in nick box" should probably be renamed to just "Show user mode in nick box".

Hi , can you update the windows 10 app as well ? and does it have x64 version as well ?

i am not sure if i should install the .exe over the windows 10 app
Untested, but the formatted yaml appears to match what is expected.
If you disable "Automatically reconnect to servers on disconnect" in advanced settings, then the "Auto reconnect delay" option in the same menu is greyed-out and cannot be changed.

The problem is, that the "Auto reconnect delay" (net_reconnect_delay) is still active and used by Hexchat (even after a restart). As a consequence, if the server disconnects the client, the client automatically tries to auto-reconnect after the amount of seconds set in this parameter ("Cycling to next server in ...").

Steps to reproduce:
1) Disable "Automatically reconnect to servers on disconnect" in Settings / Options / Chatting / Advanced.
2) Remember the value you see in the greyed-out field "Auto reconnect delay".
3) To be sure that no other setting in the network's settings affects the problem, edit a network entry and:
   * Enable "Connect to selected server only"
   * Disable "Connect to this network automatically"
   * Remove all servers, except one, from the list of servers.
4) Restart Hexchat (to be sure that all settings take effect)
5) Connect to the server
6) Make sure that the server disconnects you when you connect. For example, ask an admin to temporarily bann you for 1h.

Actual results:
Hexchat automatically reconnects after the amount of time set in "Auto reconnect delay" (net_reconnect_delay)

Expected results:
If "Automatically reconnect to servers on disconnect" is disabled, then Hexchat should not care about the value in "Auto reconnect delay" and never auto-reconnect.

Additional information:
The auto-reconnects don't happen if the user disconnects (/discon). It only happens if the server disconnects.

Workaround:
If you are affected by this problem, you can use, for example, the "/set net_reconnect_delay 7200" command set the delay to 2h. Note that settings the parameter to "0" does not disable the auto-reconnect. It only sets the delay to 0 seconds.
With server tab hidden hexchat seems to treat whatever channel is currently selected (say, at time of reconnect, otherwise the first ordered one) as the server tab and this results in the channels auto-join not firing.

Also just obviously if I have the server tab disabled I probably only want "* Disconnected" "* Reconnected" "* Connected". An option might be to change unconnected networks channel labels to say, orange, or add an asterisk indicator or something.

Thanks for all the hard work to date xoxo
