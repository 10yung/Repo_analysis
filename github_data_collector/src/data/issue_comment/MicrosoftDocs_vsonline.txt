We recently introduced the ability to change an environment’s instance type and suspension timeout, but we don’t allow changing it’s name. Since some users may prefer to retain an environment for an extended period of time (as opposed to deleting/recreating environments from a repo as needed), it seems valuable to support renaming, so that folks can ensure their environment names are always as recognizable/meaningful as possible. 
Using either VS Code desktop or web connected to a VSO environment, copying individual files into the environment with drag-and-drop works, but copying out of the environment with drag-and-drop does not seem to do anything.

Downloading files by selecting the file in the File Explorer viewlet and running the command `File: Download` works correctly.

VS Code is not running as admin, and I don't see any errors reported in the console 
Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

When trying to create the first environment with VS Code I get the error message “The operation is not permitted for namespace ‘Microsoft.VSOnline’.” I have an “Azure for students: Starter” subscription and I already “registered” all resource providers in Azure.

When trying to create the first environment, on web (Chrome) I get the error message “204-Access Failed” or “FailedToRegisterResourceProvider”. 

Thank you

I am able to log in with Azure successfully. However, when I click on "Create New Environment", a log in page appears but it does not send the log in credentials back to VS Code after I login on the webpage, leaving VS Code waiting for authentication.

In the web portal, when I'm creating a new environment and enter a name for the environment, I see a check mark in the name box, which seems to indicate that the name has been validated.

However, if an environment of the same name already exists, the "create environment" action will fail, saying that the environment name is not unique.

It would be useful to get the error message when the name was (seemingly) validated, before we attempted to create an environment.
Since today my VSO environment does not work anymore. 
I'm unable to browse for files. ( /home/vsonline does not exist, / does not exist either ) 
I get message : Failed to connect to the remote extension host server (Error: Connection error: Version mismatch, client refused.)

What can I do  ? Is the environment lost ( aka need to recreate it ) ?

Hi,

When trying to move the "Visual Studio Online Plan" resource to a new subscription, the operation fails with the error:

statusMessage": "{\"error\":{\"code\":\"ResourceMoveFailed\",\"message\":\"Resources '/subscriptions/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/vso-rg/providers/Microsoft.VSOnline/plans/vso-plan-westeurope' **move actions failed**. The correlation Id is '3cd9b016-8a7b-433b-800a-1e0db5233cf8'\",\"details\":**[{\"code\":\"BadRequest\",\"target\":\"Microsoft.VSOnline/plans\",\"message\":\"\"}]}}"**

Is this achievable somehow? 

Appreciate your help.

Though I understand that development is currently in progress for the mobile Chrome versions, I thought it would be noteworthy to mention that all the icons for the different file types are being interpreted incorrectly by the browser.

I'm exploring the feasibility of integrating Visual Studio Online into a platform we're developing. I'd like to be able to, on a customer's request:

1) Start an ssh container in our cluster.
2) Push ssh credentials to Visual Studio Online.
3) Provide the customer with a URL that, when accessed, opens the web IDE.
4) Have the IDE utilize the supplied credentials to run vscode-server inside the ssh container.

Ideally, the customer would not be required to have a Microsoft account.
