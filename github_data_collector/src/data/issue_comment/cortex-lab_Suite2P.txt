Hello, I had a question regarding how to interpret the results of the python suite2p deconvolution. It's not clear to me what the y-axis of the deconvolution result means. 
Is the height of the spike suggesting that's the number of spikes occurring at that time point? That's what Step 3 from Figure 1 in [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438818300977) suggests: 
> "Step 3. Spike deconvolution is performed on the neuropil-corrected traces that represent the average activity of pixels inside an ROI. The result is a trace the same size as the fluorescence trace, containing estimates of the number of spikes in every bin."

On the other hand, I see others are thresholding the output to figure out when true spikes occur. Here another researcher on the MouseLand Issues page suggests as much: https://github.com/cortex-lab/Suite2P/issues/157
And based on the original [OASIS paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005423), I notice on Figure 5, mentions of thresholding can be helpful. (To be honest, I'm not sure I understand if the output of the python suite2p is the same as L1 on this graph, so any clarification would be helpful.)

I'm overall confused because the amplitude of the spikes I'm getting are into the hundreds and thousands. Which makes me think I need to threshold. But if I threshold, I don't have an actual sense of how many spikes occurred nor can I be confident comparing spiking activity between cells/sessions.
Hello. I'm quite new to this field. I was wondering what data should be used as input to "OASISpreprocess.m". Raw fluorescence measurement (F) or Î”F/F?

Hello,

I have been running suite2p with ssh on a GPU cluster with Jupyter-Lab, with some success.

However, now I want to switch to using the GUI using X11 protocol...but it seems that the default setting in the GUI is to not use the GPUs...

How and where, exactly, do I change the necessary parameters to get maximum performance out of the GPUs? What are the necessary parameters? I guess num_workers, num_workers_roi, and ops.useGPU?

I tried loading the ops file from an earlier run with Jupyter-Lab...where num_workers was 0 and num_workers_roi was -1....I don't know what the ops.useGPU value was set at (default)...and it gave me a memory error.

I am running on a 3 (or sometimes a 2) NVIDIA GPU cluster.

Thanks,

Evan
Hello,

I get this error just after suite2p finishes detecting ROIs. I'm running the "run_pipeline_tiffs_or_batch.ipynb" jupyter notebook in jupyter lab.

Do you have an idea what the problem might be?

First, thanks very much for developing this very useful toolbox!

I downloaded the newest version of suit2p today. I set ops.deconvType= 'L0' and run "wrapperDECONV.m" to get the spike train results.  Then I get this error "Undefined function or variable 'Fbase'."  I check the code and it's true that there is no Fbase under L0 situation.

Moreover, I also notice that the neuropil coefficient was set to 0.8 by this command coefs   = min(.8, ops.maxNeurop) * ones(1, NN), since ops.maxNeurop is always 1.  Could you please explain why? Thanks very much!
when using a specific experiment to get target image (targetImage not empty)

This is resolving issue #166 

I tested the new code when targetImage is not empty. Please, have a look for when targetImage is empty. However, I based the new code primarily on the old code that existed for the case when targetImage is empty.
Hi guys!

In lines 65 and 109 you reshape the data from a 3-dimensional array  into a 4-dimensional array with dimensions: [Ly, Lx, nPlanes, nFrames]. Hence, the code crashes if the length of the 3rd dimension is not divisible by nplanes. For example, say you have a tiff file with 2000 frames and you want to sample from 7 planes.
  
I am getting "Error using save
Cannot create 'F_S35_H2O Room A_plane1_proc.mat' because 'F:\S35\H2O Room A\13' does not exist." 

This doesn't makes sense as I am not inputing the .mat file from the F:\ directory. Please help. 
Hello,

I am trying to load tiff files with many frames but for those that have more than 32016 frames I get a dat.Fcell that is only 32016 long, that is I am missing frames.
Is there something I can do?

Thank you.
Hello,
I started using registers2p for my chronic imaging. I usually have between 5 and 7 imaging sessions on the same cortical area, on which I'd like to track neurons. Is there an easy way to compare more than just two sessions using resisters2p?

thank you!
