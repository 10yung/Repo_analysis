Seeking for Help in Emergency
Trying to use a query that works in Chrome console but not in hpple

"//ul//li/span[normalize-space(text())='10']"

Any ideas on how to replicate this to work with hpple would be greatly appreciated.

I tried to parse Korean in HTML but it isn't working. I think it doesn't use NSString but cString on parsing. Any character must be in ASCII scope if it works
P.S. also cannot parse by unicode

Hi 
i use your class in my app to display image of a gallery in a blog under wordpress.com 

In iPhone works perfectly , but when i use hpple on Apple Watch it's works on  simulator but on fisical device it won't works !
When the parsing arrive on this line of code 

```
TFHpple *parser = [TFHpple hppleWithHTMLData:appleWatchHtmlData];
NSLog(@"parser %@", parser);
NSString *tutorialsXpathQueryString = @"//div[@class='gallery galleryid-1461 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail']/dl/dt/a/img";

NSArray *imageFilesArray = [tutorialsParser searchWithXPathQuery:tutorialsXpathQueryString];
NSMutableArray *imagesArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:0];
```

the nslog say 
2015-10-25 18:19:13.939 WatchApp Extension[398:328494] parser <TFHpple: 0x1655d7e0>
2015-10-25 18:19:13.947 WatchApp Extension[398:328494] Unable to parse.

Perhaps it may be due to the limited apple watch resources, but how can i solve this issue ?

Thank you so much

I have a problem, I parse html page and view freezing while its parsing. How to use this library for parsing asynchronously?

```
some html data declared in utf8,but it contains some unicode char.
hpple's XPathQuery.m:31,40,44 will lead to crash(set nil object to dictionary).

http://www.qiushibaike.com/text   the data from this url sometimes contains unicode char in utf-8 content.
```
