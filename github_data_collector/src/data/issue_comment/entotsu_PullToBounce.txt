I have tried to get this working in my project in Swift 4 but when i add the control, my scrollview content doesn't load and it just loads with a white view in the scrollview.

MY view hierarchy is as follows:
UIViewController -> View -> ScrollView -> 3x UIViews & 3x UICollectionViews

The scrollview is implemented via the storyboard with the layout constraints that is is aligned top, leading, trailing, bottom to the main view controller view.

I want to add the pull to refresh to my scrollview

I have done the following code, and tried variations but it doesn't work:

// Please wrap your scroll view
scrollView.frame = self.view.frame
let tableViewWrapper = PullToBounceWrapper(scrollView: scrollView)
// Please add wrapper view to your view instead of your scroll view.
self.view.addSubview(tableViewWrapper)

I've also tried creating a new UIview bodyview per your tutorial:
let bodyView = UIView()
bodyView.frame = scrollView.frame
let tableViewWrapper = PullToBounceWrapper(scrollView: scrollView)
bodyView.add(tableViewWrapper)
self.view.addSubview(bodyView)

I'm either missing something very simple, or something isn't working and would appreciate some guidance if you're able to!
App is not working in the xcode 9.2 with the minimum deployment 9.0


when i used snp layout llike
`
func createTableview() -> Void {
        let changeCityTableView = ChangeCityTableView()
        self.view.addSubview(changeCityTableView)
        changeCityTableView.snp.makeConstraints { (make) in
            make.edges.equalToSuperview()
        }

        let tableViewWrapper = PullToBounceWrapper(scrollView: changeCityTableView)
        self.view.addSubview(tableViewWrapper)

        tableViewWrapper.didPullToRefresh = {
            Timer.schedule(delay: 2) { timer in
                tableViewWrapper.stopLoadingAnimation()
            }
        }
    }
`
a crash open
assert(false, "Wow, scrollView.frame is CGRectZero. Please set frame size.")
Certain things not available when downloading straight from github and can not find replacement
I saw that you updated the repo to swift 3 however cocoa pods still has the swift 2 version. Could you please update the cocoa pod?
it'd be cool to have a swift 3 version, if you have any interest to create a branch i would like to help with that.

As the issue title says, I am trying to use it with a scrollView made via the storyboard. Do you guys know how to implement it, and use it ?

Hary.
