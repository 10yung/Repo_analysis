I want to predict longitudinal vehicle velocities through a static bayes net which are never below 0 in my use-case (and therefore the training samples). The net gets current and prior velocity and some infrastructure informations as inputs and predicts the next timesteps. It already gives quite good prediction results, but sometimes (especially when predicting from standstill) predicts negative velocities of small magnitude. It also produces very high sigmas when predicting longer horizons (~15s). Is there a way that i can tell my "prediction nodes" (gaussian_CPD) to only output positive means (or even means in a value range)? Maybe this would also decrease my sigmas...
I don't really understand the clamp_mean and clamp_cov functionalities from the documentation, so maybe someone could help me on this.

how to use BNT to get the probability of top event, if the probabilities of basic events were given.
I run installC_BNT.m, and then run test_BNT.m. It turns out that the matlab crash because of 'error was detected while a MEX-file was running'. How does it happen ? By the way, I don't find the file mentioned in installC_graph.m. Where to find them? 
The following tutorial has many inactive links. Please check.
http://bayesnet.github.io/bnt/docs/usage.html
I followed all the relevant steps and ran test_BNT command. It ran properly for a while but gave an error at a later stage for CPD_to_CPT function name. I even tried changing the name of the function for the files mentioned in the error but it made the situation worse.

Error was as follows:

_

> Error: File: CPD_to_CPT.m Line: 36 Column: 16
> Function with duplicate name "CPD_to_CPT" cannot be defined.
> 
> Error in discrete_CPD/convert_to_pot (line 14)
> CPT1 = CPD_to_CPT(CPD);
> 
> Error in jtree_inf_engine/enter_evidence (line 57)
>       pot{n} = convert_to_pot(bnet.CPD{e}, pot_type, fam(:), evidence);
> 
> Error in qmr1 (line 84)
> tic; [engine{2}, ll(2)] = enter_evidence(engine{2}, big_evidence); toc

How to use mlp_node? When I use learn_param_em to learn mlp_node, matlab shows "Undefined function 'CPD_to_CPT' for input arguments of type 'mlp_CPD". Are there any example of using mlp_CPD? 
At some size of the problem, the estimation of probability for variables with 2 states was 0 and 0.
We now use gibbs_sampling_inf_engine.
The code is available on Figshare (https://figshare.com/articles/New_draft_itemA_modeling_approach_to_evaluate_the_influence_of_the_spatial_and_temporal_size_of_an_epidemiological_surveillance_network_on_phytosanitary_treatments_for_crops/4675759).
For example, in SIMULATE.m with n=196, b=2, it was OK until t=5, afterward all the probabilities was estimated at 0.

Many thanks for sharing this very helpful toolbox!

A small bug is detected in "learn_struct_K2": 
Line 78, "while ~done & (length(ps) <= max_fan_in)" 
should be "while ~done & (length(ps) < max_fan_in)". 
Could you please fix it in the future version? Thanks!

By the way, it may be better to change "&" into "&&" in this line.

To save my Bayesian Network model in an XMLBIF format, i must use an open source Matlab code developed by Jan Nunnink, This Matlab code implements a method called “saveXMLBIF” that uses the XMLTree toolbox and the XMLBIF format definition to save the BN in an XML file. i try to loaded this file from http:// staff.science.uva.nl/~jnunnink/public/saveXMLBIF.m my problem:I did not find the site to download this code.  there is any one can help me pleassssss
Did there have some example about learning DBNs from data？ how to use the bat and water to genger the DBN data? thank you!
