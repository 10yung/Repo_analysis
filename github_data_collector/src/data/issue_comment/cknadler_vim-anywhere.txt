I can open files in current window using  context menu `open with`. However, pressing `Ctrl+Cmd+V` opens new windows. I want to know how  to open a new buffer in current MacVim window?

I added this feature by appending this line to `bin/run`:
```sh
xdotool key ctrl+v
```
It does add a dependency but xdotool supports both linux and OSX.

There is no hotkey to set in services on macOS. Looking under Services/general shows nothing.

`-c` will dump the contents of the clipboard into the tempfile before it opens for editing
The markdown file type is much more useful than a plain text file which is very useful for GitHub comments, issues, et cetera

I understand that this doesn't solve the problem completely because different people might want different default file types. This is a quick solution to improve upon the current state of using a plain text file, which is much less useful than any specific file type.

If any user wants to change file type quickly, I recommend setting up mappings in your vimrc (for example https://github.com/dylan-chong/dotfiles/commit/c2e3b5d5cb82d6d35101a10c29c2a0d78f683383#diff-4e12c6a37ff2cbb2c93d1b33324a6051R571)
On some macOS environments, the `$OSTYPE` environment variable is
'Darwin' (capitalized) and not 'darwin'. This caused the install script
to echo "OS Darwin is not supported!" and exit, even if everything was
in fact in order.

This patch uses a case-insensitive regex against a [standard bash
operator](1) to allow any `$OSTYPE` that starts with 'Darwin' or
'darwin'.

All other instances of conditional checks for darwin* are also patched
across the code base.

I found most of the time when I invoke vim-anywhere, I need to type something right away, so I think it makes sense to put vim in insert mode automatically to save one keystroke. the change should be real simple with +startinsert option on vim invocation.
Are there any plans to port this project to windows, for us that are stuck with Microsofts software suite in a work environment etc. but still long for the sweet Vim-brace?
