Based on @shurwit pull request:
These changes allow you to enable the ability to pass touch events through the target part of the spotlight while maintaining the close on touch outside functionality on the overlay.

How can I place a view in the same position as spotlight from my layout programmatically with Custom Target?
The spotlight position is different between two phone.  A Pixel 2 XL emulator looks like this:

but on a Pixel 3 XL phone (no emulator) it's here:

I'm thinking the notch might be effecting the positioning.

I'm also using 1.5.0 because 1.8.0 is throwing some manifest merge compiling error.
Hi

Thanks for your work but i have a problem: If i add this library to my project my other view's paddings are not working. Do you know how to resolve this problem?
can't work when Build.VERSION.SDK_INT less than LOLLIPOP
Hi there, Library does an impressive work but if I have views below the viewport library not able to autoscroll on its own what should we do in that case.
