It looks like this library is the source so I have to stop using it , many thanks anyway :) it worked quite well until this... 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49059668/appstore-rejection-performance-software-requirements-prefsroot-graphicsser

Your app uses or references the following non-public APIs:

GraphicsServices.framework

The use of non-public APIs is not permitted on the App Store because it can lead to a poor user experience should these APIs change. 

Continuing to use or conceal non-public APIs in future submissions of this app may result in the termination of your Apple Developer account, as well as removal of all associated apps from the App Store.
Is there a way to do so? Thanks.
Hello,

A license is missing from this repository. Without it, I cannot know whether or not I can use this library in my project. Please add some license.
Hi Dear, any plan to add IPV6 support?
tkx

This is not a readme:

Please refer to the Cookbook versions of these categories instead of this repository.

Please explain.

Update to use new build flag for detecting simulator. May need to include `TargetConditionals.h` if used in Swift code, which is not the case here.

Added iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s plus

They have a new iphone ;)
