See #46. Multi-word text formatting with underscores is currently broken.
Multiple word text formatting using underscores instead of asterisks doesn't work properly. This is important to me because I need to write my markdown in a way that is mostly compatible with TWiki syntax, and TWiki and Markdown happen to share `__` as a syntax for denoting important text (it's bold for Markdown, and bold with italics for TWiki).

I'm using Notepad++ v7.5.8 and markdown-plus-plus 81a86b4.
This is a feature request. It would be useful if the functionList.xml is created for markdown files. If headings is regarded as functions then it would be easy to navigate between them.
Not sure if this is a Notepad++ or a Markdown++ issue, but here it goes:

I can successfully import Markdown++ syntax highlighter, it is listed in the combo box of the UDL dialog. However, it is not persisted nor listed among the language menu; thus I cannot apply it and when I restart Notepad++ it has disappeared.

Workaround for me consists in pasting the XML in
%APPDATA%\Notepad++\userDefineLangs
(in my case %APPDATA% = C:\Users\samuelm\AppData\Roaming\ )

I use CSS quite a bit, to tweak elements I have given an ID and full support for this is baked into standard Markdown when it appears on a new line with a blank line separating it from the markdown. It would be nice if we could keep that highlighting when a line starts with `<`  or is contained between tags (such as between `<Style>` and `</Style>`)

*Testing **Bold** in Itlaic* doesn't work.
However
**Testing *Italic* inside Bold** does work.

If your code will have a tick in it, you can surround it with double tick as valid, basic Markdown, this breaks highlighting.

``An example of a non-escaped ` in a code block working just fine because this is in double ticks``
I am running W10 x64, and I would like to use this. However, the compile / make process is out of my time reach ... would you post the binaries in release dirs?

Thanks.
