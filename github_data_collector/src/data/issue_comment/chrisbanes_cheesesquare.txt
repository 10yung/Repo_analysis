wants to try this

Nothing fancy but just thought to address general warnings I noticed.

@chrisbanes on the `CheeseDetailsActivity` there's the 'Night mode' menu, but it doesn't show the correctly checked mode, and selecting the items does nothing. I've extracted the code to handle the checking and selecting into a helper class — seemed neater than putting it in a common base class.

I bumped the gradle/support lib versions at the same time, good to keep up-to-date.

It smells that you wouldn't write the MainActivity Javadoc. In addition... it doesn't need it :·)

BTW, thanks for sharing your work!
