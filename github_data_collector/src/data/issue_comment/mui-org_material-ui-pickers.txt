Thanks for this great package!
See title.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently, on the desktop, there isn't a good way to allow users to select a date range that has dates from two months (start in January and end in February)

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'd like to be able to display two months when selecting a date range, similar to Google Flights:

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
For now, displaying single month is an option, but from UX perspective two months view would be better

Also use [Snackbar](https://material-ui.com/ru/components/snackbars/) instead of spinner

| Tech                 | Version |

| @material-ui/pickers |  3.2.8   |
| formik          | 2.1.2      |
| yup|         | 0.28.0

## Steps to reproduce

Shouldn't it also consider the `validationError` to be set before calling it? this `useEffect` will trigger when the value changes

## The Problem

I have a page where there are three KeyboardDatePicker and if anyone of them is without any preseted date (blank, waiting for the user fill it) the mask doesn't work, accepts letter (it's suppose to be numbers only) and it gets very slow, you wait some seconds for the input show up. But if comes with any date preseted, I can erase and everything works fine. How can I let the field blank without this? Is a perfomance problem? The three date are the same component

## New

After some testing, I discovered that it's only the KeyboardDatePicker that causes this, and he only show up when a certain option is selected in a "Select". But I made it show up along with the page, not depending on the condition and it worked just fine. There's something with condition that may interfere with the perfomance of KeyboardDatePicker?

## Environment

| Tech                 | Version |
| -------------------- | ------- |
| @material-ui/pickers | 3.2.7        |
| material-ui          | 4.8.3        |
| TypeScript           |  3.4       |
| React                |  16.8.6       |

| Peer library         |         | <!-- date-fns, luxon or moment and version  --> |

## Steps to reproduce

1. Update material-ui/core to version 4.8.3 (yarn add @material-ui/core) from 4.5.1 in an app that uses @material-ui/pickers
2. Run the app (npm start)
3. Observe the error message: 
"Type '{ renderDay: (day: MaterialUiPickersDate, selected: MaterialUiPickersDate, dayInCurrentMonth: boolean) => Element; value: Moment; variant: "static"; onChange: (day: MaterialUiPickersDate) => void; ... 9 more ...; rowsMax: undefined; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Pick<PureDateInputProps, "ref" | "label" | "select" | "style" | "title" | "className" | "innerRef" | "defaultChecked" | "defaultValue" | "suppressContentEditableWarning" | "suppressHydrationWarning" | ... 265 more ... | "inputVariant">': color, size  TS2739"

## Expected behavior

I expected to be able to start the app and the DatePicker component to still work.

## Actual behavior
The app fails to compile with the error message: 
"Type '{ renderDay: (day: MaterialUiPickersDate, selected: MaterialUiPickersDate, dayInCurrentMonth: boolean) => Element; value: Moment; variant: "static"; onChange: (day: MaterialUiPickersDate) => void; ... 9 more ...; rowsMax: undefined; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Pick<PureDateInputProps, "ref" | "label" | "select" | "style" | "title" | "className" | "innerRef" | "defaultChecked" | "defaultValue" | "suppressContentEditableWarning" | "suppressHydrationWarning" | ... 265 more ... | "inputVariant">': color, size  TS2739"

## Live example
Not sure if I am doing something wrong of if this is a bug! Here is what my code looks like where I am using the <DatePicker> component. All of this worked fine prior to upgrading to 4.8.3. 

`import MomentUtils from "@date-io/moment";`
`import { DatePicker, Day, MuiPickersUtilsProvider } from "@material-ui/pickers";`
`import { MaterialUiPickersDate } from "@material-ui/pickers/typings/date";`

<MuiPickersUtilsProvider utils={MomentUtils}>
            <DatePicker
              // eslint-disable-next-line
              renderDay={renderDay}
              value={selectedDate}
              variant="static"
              onChange={handleDateChange}
              format="YYYY-MM-DD"
              disableToolbar={true}
              style={undefined}
              onFocus={undefined}
              onBlur={undefined}
              className={undefined}
              ref={undefined}
              innerRef={undefined}
              rows={undefined}
              rowsMax={undefined}
            />
</MuiPickersUtilsProvider>
The [`@date-io`](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/date-io) library release a new version v2 that's break this module.
