Hey guys, I'd like to contribute with this changes in `NSDictionary` and `NSArray` to use Swift literal dictionary and array.
@keith can you take a look at this, please?

Issue #80 
I am trying to map a dictonary where the keys have ".", for example 
"gcm.message_id": 2002

How can I use the Mapper to not see those "." as a path?
The `Mappable` protocol uses `NSDictionary` and `NSArray` in its convenience methods.

``` swift
public static func from(_ JSON: NSDictionary) -> Self?
public static func from(_ JSON: NSArray) -> [Self]?
```

Since Swift continues to move away from Objective C with 3.0, I would propose to change the types toÂ `[String: Any]` and `[Any]`/`[[String: Any]]` so it integrates more naturally in Swift development. Or is there any good reason to prefer `NSDictionary`/`NSArray` over these?
