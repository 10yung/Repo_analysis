I had an issue where I went to getting started and the link to the previewer app was missing. I was able to find the link elsewhere. This pull request updates the other outdated links to the previewer app as well. 
Adding 'flow' example to anypixel frontend. The example displays the google logo and slowly cycles through the color spectrum. Touching the buttons creates a rainbow.
I'm looking at quotes for producing the controller and display boards on a small scale (~50).

1. Is there a solder-type requirement for making these boards or do the components care what solder is used?

It's unclear to me how to "set the correct memory layout for each device in the linker script."  

2. Where is the referenced linker script and do I adjust it before uploading firmware for each board and MCU (controller and display)?
2.a Do I need to send this instruction to the PCB manufacturer, will they understand what that means?
2.b. Are there any instructions needed for properly uploading the provided firmware to the boards or do I just compile and upload everything as a single hex file as is?

3. What is the SMT oven profile for these boards?

4. Is conformal coating needed?
Hi!

I need to create my own version of the previewer to accurately represent the physical button wall we have in use here. However, I noticed that the index.js file is missing in the previewer/src folder. I'm assuming it's because all index.js files are ignored in .gitignore and the file in question isn't excluded.

Could you add the file to the repo as it's needed to build the previewer.js file?

Thank you!
Hi 
It is a wonderfun idea. :+1: 

We are lack of mechanical drawings. A Mechanical Engineer  tell  me thart there are some files missing in the path  /hardware/mechanical .  So that we can't manufacture mechanical structure .  

Please check these files by the  PATH :  /hardware/mechanical .  Plesae help me .  @avindra  @mannytan @streeter @hapticdata  ^_^

 Many thanks.

Loving this project and am dying to try it out. Great work!

There are two major areas which would greatly help in understanding how to set up this project:

1) What type of LEDs are supported? I'm assuming WS2812 as those are fairly common, though without this specified I'm not sure what LEDs anypixel.js can talk to. 

2) How is the LED grid defined, or can it even be defined? There's many ways to set up the LEDs -- i.e in linear or nonlinear strips, individual LEDs connected in columns or rows... knowing how to specify this is essential for setting up the pixel grid. 

- Added browserify and watchify in frontend examples as a devDependency, for users who have not installed these packages at the global scope.
