This package requires an old version of 'findup-sync' (3.0.0) that requires 'set-value' with old version (2.0.0) which has vulnerability issue.
Updating the package to require the latest version of 'findup-sync' will resolve the issue.

Thanks,
Michal.
After reading through the man page for `liftoffrc`, I have been able to successfully add new build configurations to the Xcode project, but I don't see the ability to exclude the default `Debug` and `Release` configurations.

Is this possible? And if not, Could you please add this as a feature request?
Hey,

I successfully installed Liftoff but I can't find that templates folder on my machine. I'm trying to create a new template where I can have an additional folder and files. Closed issues say its at ~/.liftoff/templates/ but that doesn't exist on my machine?

Where else could it be?

I'd appreciate the help,
Thanks
While liftoff of processing my file `project.pbxproj` it raises an error "Data missing closing '>'".

Here is the *a part* of my `project.pbxproj` file.

```
/* Begin PBXContainerItemProxy section */
  89D30FA71FD0D8CE001AF760 /* PBXContainerItemProxy */ = {
    isa = PBXContainerItemProxy;
    containerPortal = 89D30F8A1FD0D8CE001AF760 /* Project object */;
    proxyType = 1;
    remoteGlobalIDString = 89D30F911FD0D8CE001AF760;
    remoteInfo = <%= project_name %>; // Here is the error
  };
/* End PBXContainerItemProxy section */
```

[Here](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Nanaimo/blob/0.2.3/lib/nanaimo/reader.rb#L207) is the line the error is being trigerred: 
### Summary
Swift was growing a lot on community and with that, some good lint tools have been developed by the community, for example, the [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint). 

So, I think that implementing this integration is a great feature for Liftoff. 

### Feature
Creating integration with Swiftlint.

### TODO
I'm not implementing tests for this feature I know that is a "must have" thing, but I really don't have the knowledge to perform that (I'm a beginner in ruby, sorry guys).
Hi,

I would like copy my color palette template file (.clr) to ~/Library/Colors. Is there a liftoff option to do it ?

Thanks
It's possible to add App Capabilities, App-Groups in the specific, to the generated project?
Hello,

I've just added a swift 3/Xcode 8 compatibility for my personal use and i think it could help others peoples :)

I edited the file named `project.rb` but at this moment the bundle identifier is not auto generated. 

The Podfile contain the update for copying the acknowledgements.plist to the Settings.bundle directory.

My modifications are visible here https://github.com/Maximelc/liftoffConfig

Thanks 
We use Circle as a default now because it seems to work better than the others.
Since we don't use Travis anymore, this also makes it so we don't need to
maintain a configuration for it.

I have a few xcconfig files from https://github.com/jspahrsummers/xcconfigs. I want to add them into project but not have them added into app target or test target. How can I do that? 
looks like files under `app_target_templates` will be added into app target and files under `templates` won't be added into the project.
