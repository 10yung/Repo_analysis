Hello! It is [**Picabot**, an automatic GitHub image optimizer](https://github.com/somu/picabot).

Your repository cointains some images, and I compressed them for you.
Do not worry: the compression is lossless and uses [ImageOptim](http://imageoptim.com) toolkit.

This bot exists to make the Internet faster. There are people who've got a fast internet connection,
but there are countries where additional 50 KBs take a reasonable time to download (like additional 2-3 minutes).
Additionally, this PR is going to save some precious disk space and decrease your server load. Picabot saves
approximately 25% of space. Still, if you do not need your images optimized, feel free to close this pull request.

If I have enough money, I'll build a server which will send these precious pull requests much faster.
And if I had monthly donations, I would dedicate all my work time to open-source, so donations are very appreciated.

HI,
I am new to textmate but I am having some issues getting create partial from selection working : here is the error I am having 

/Users/jeremy/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Managed/Bundles/Bundle Support.tmbundle/Support/shared/lib/ui.rb:355:in `to_plist': An object in the argument tree could not be converted (ArgumentError)
    from /Users/jeremy/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Managed/Bundles/Bundle Support.tmbundle/Support/shared/lib/ui.rb:355:in`request_string_core'
    from /Users/jeremy/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Managed/Bundles/Bundle Support.tmbundle/Support/shared/lib/ui.rb:193:in `request_string'
    from /Users/jeremy/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Managed/Bundles/Ruby on Rails.tmbundle/Support/bin/create_partial_from_selection.rb:24:in`<main>'

I have been spending the last hour trying to fix it without any luck.

I am running TextMate 2.0 with Ruby 1.9.3 and OS X 10.8.3

Thanks in advance,

I get the following error dialog when trying to use Quick Migration:

```
/Users/zachmillman/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Managed/Bundles/Ruby on Rails.tmbundle/Support/lib/rails/text_mate.rb:54:in `method_missing': undefined method `filepath' for TextMate:Module (NoMethodError)

Hi,

I have followed "to install with Git" instructions, when i run:

osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'

i get this error: 

23:37: syntax error: A identifier canâ€™t go after this identifier. (-2740)

I am using:
- Ruby 1.9.3
- Rails 3.2.11
- MAC OS 10.8.2

Any idea?

According to my evaluation , "${7:class}" is unnecessary.
Please check it before merging,i dont have apple - textmate so, i didn't tried it.

Hi,
