Add a license file please, it's propietary as far as I know right know.
When I open the xcodeproject it says I need to migrate..
Mi webapp has links like https://facebook ..sharer.php?url=https.... 
I want the native app to intercept this links and make something like action_send on android. Any idea?
The webview doesn't seem to resize when rotating to landscape mode.
Even opening the app in landscape mode doesn't seem to do the trick.

Am I missing something ?

Any smart way to do a 301 redirect?

e.g.,

`<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=http://www.google.de/">`

I'm not sure if web-push would  work / makes sense here -- but it'd be awesome to incorporate native push (broadcast style) notifications into the boilerplate. 

I'm not super familiar with Apple/GCM/etc, but I'd be happy to help implement it with some guidance!

This is a problem as there are no browser controls.

Ideal solution would be to instruct the webview to open non-local links or whatever in Safari... don't know how to do this yet.
