In LaTeX one can construct a large open parenthesis with `\left(\frac{M}{L}\right.`. Using this with `TeX` is possible and gives: 
```r
TeX("$\\left(\\frac{M}{L}\\right.$")
#> expression(`$\left(\frac{M}{L}\right.$` = 
#>            paste("", "", bgroup("(", paste("", frac(paste("M"), paste("", "L")), ""))))
```
It is not possible to use this as the `bgroup` is missing the "closing" dot. The correct code would be: 
`expression(bgroup("(", frac("M", "L"), "."))` (I removed unneccessary `paste` and empty strings, for emphasis on the `"."`). 

```r
plot.new()
plot.window(c(0,3), c(0,1))
text(0, 0.5, latex2exp::TeX("$\\left(\\frac{M}{L}\\right)$")) # works
text(1, 0.5, latex2exp::TeX("$\\left(\\frac{M}{L}\\right.$")) 
```
> Error in bgroup("(", paste("", frac(paste("M"), paste("", "L")), "")) : 
  invalid group specification
```r
text(2, 0.5, expression(bgroup("(", frac("M", "L"), "."))) # works
```

This could be very nice to have. 
Add \phantom{} support.
Addresses issue #20,
not sure if i was doing it right, but I couldn't get whitespace with 

$\;$ nor $\,$

Would be great to support, e.g. \hspace{2cm} as well
The code `TeX("$\\hat{|\\rho|}$")` gives the following error:
```
Original string:  $\hat{|\rho|}$ 
Parsed expression:  paste('','',hat(paste('|',rho|,,,)),'') 
Error in parse(text = str) : <text>:1:31: unexpected ','
1: paste('','',hat(paste('|',rho|,
```
Add possibility to use literal underscore and caret symbols. Now I can't use them neither in text, nor in math modes.

 `TeX('H_0\\_1\\^2 $H_3\\_4\\^5$')`:

The current dev version is superior to the current CRAN version. 
Any plans for a CRAN release?
I installed the latest latex2exp manually from the binary available in CRAN, in a Windows computer without internet (I am working in a secure lab environment). I am using R 3.3.1, with RGui (crap, I know, but I am not an administrator and change requests are slow). When I load the package, I get a pop-up message saying:

>The procedure entry point DATAPTR could not be located in the dynamic link library R.dll.

After accepting the message, the R console says:

>Error in inDL(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now), ... ) :
 unable to load shared object '//path/to/my/local/library/stringi/libs/x64/stringi.dll :
 LoadLibrary failure: The specified procedure could not be found.

Not sure what is the problem, as the file stringi.dll **is** in the aforementioned folder. The file is the original from the package .zip file.

I manually installed other packages and dependencies (like ggplot2) and they load fine, so it seems to be an issue of latex2exp. Hence my post here. Any idea?



I would like to annotate math formulas on the plot using `geom_text()` and I specified the TeX expression to the `label` argument in following  code.

```
library(ggplot2)
library(latex2exp)

p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, cyl)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 30, y = 7, label = TeX("$\\theta$ = 270")))
print(p)
```
However, it produces following error

```
Don't know how to automatically pick scale for object of type expression. Defaulting to continuous.
Error in as.data.frame.default(x[[i]], optional = TRUE) : 
  cannot coerce class ‘"expression"’ to a data.frame
```
