Hi, 
I just installed it and this is what I got at the launch (```python3.6 -m nbmanager```)

```

Hi!

Great idea, I've been looking for a way to manage all the run servers.
However, the program just frezzes when run on windows 8.
(And also makes my system sluggish). However there is no excessive CPU usage.

I'm not sure how I should start debugging this.

I'm using python 3.4.5 with Ipython 5.

Full [packages ](https://gist.github.com/ajasja/f5c21cdf361bfd000d947065f489fb4f) available here.

On Windows, I get a `PermissionError` "Access is denied":

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\nbmanager-0.1-py3.5.egg\nbmanager\gui.py", line 148, in shutdown
  File "C:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\nbmanager-0.1-py3.5.egg\nbmanager\api.py", line 71, in shutdown
PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied
```

I tried running the shell as Administrator but get the same problem. 

The app crashes as a result of this.
