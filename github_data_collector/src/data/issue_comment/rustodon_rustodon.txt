Bumps [structopt](https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt) from 0.2.18 to 0.3.7.
<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">structopt's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>v0.3.7 (2019-12-28)</h1>
<p>Nothing's new. Just re-release of <code>v0.3.6</code> due to
<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues/315#issuecomment-568502792">the mess with versioning</a>.</p>
<p>You may notice that <code>structopt-derive</code> was bumped to <code>v0.4.0</code>, that's OK, it's not a breaking change.
<code>structopt</code> will pull the right version in on its on.</p>
<h1>v0.3.6 (2019-12-22) - YANKED</h1>
<p>This is unusually big patch release. It contains a number of bugfixes and
new features, some of them may theoretically be considered breaking. We did our best
to avoid any problems on user's side but, if it wasn't good enough, please
<a href="https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues">file an issue ASAP</a>.</p>
<h2>Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>structopt</code> used to treat <code>::path::to::type::Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> as <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>
special type. <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TeXitoi/structopt/pull/287">This was considered erroneous</a>.
(same for <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>bool</code>). Now only exact <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> match is a special type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>#[structopt(version = expr)]</code> where <code>expr</code> is not a string literal used to get
overridden by auto generated <code>.version()</code> call,
<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues/283">incorrectly</a>. Now it doesn't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed bug with top-level <code>App::*</code> calls on multiple <code>struct</code>s, see
<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues/265">#289</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positional <code>bool</code> args with no explicit <code>#[structopt(parse(...))]</code> annotation are
now prohibited. This couldn't work well anyway, see
<a href="https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt/blob/master/examples/true_or_false.rs">this example</a>
for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we've instituted strict priority between doc comments, about, help, and the like.
See <a href="https://docs.rs/structopt/0.3/structopt/#help-messages">the documentation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>HUGE THANKS to <a href="https://github.com/ssokolow"><code>@ssokolow</code></a></strong> for tidying up our documentation,
teaching me English and explaining why our doc used to suck. I promise I'll make the rest
of the doc up to your standards... sometime later!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>New features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implement <code>StructOpt</code> for <code>Box&lt;impl StructOpt&gt;</code> so from now on you can use <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>
with <code>flatten</code> and <code>subcommand</code> (<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues/304">#304</a>).</p>
<pre lang="rust"><code>enum Command {
    #[structopt(name = &quot;version&quot;)]
    PrintVersion,
<p></code></pre></p>
</li>
</ul>

Bumps [chrono](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono) from 0.4.9 to 0.4.10.
<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>

*Sourced from [chrono's changelog](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).*

> ## 0.4.10
> 
> ### Improvements
> 
> * `DateTime::parse_from_str` is more than 2x faster in some cases. ([@&#8203;michalsrb](https://github.com/michalsrb)
>   [#358](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/358))
> * Significant improvements to no-std and alloc support (This should also make
>   many format/serialization operations induce zero unnecessary allocations)
>   ([@&#8203;CryZe](https://github.com/CryZe) [#341](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/341))
> 
> ### Features
> 
> * Functions that were accepting `Iterator` of `Item`s (for example
>   `format_with_items`) now accept `Iterator` of `Borrow<Item>`, so one can
>   use values or references. ([@&#8203;michalsrb](https://github.com/michalsrb) [#358](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/358))
> * Add built-in support for structs with nested `Option<Datetime>` etc fields
>   ([@&#8203;manifest](https://github.com/manifest) [#302](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/302))
> 
> ### Internal/doc improvements
> 
> * Use markdown footnotes on the `strftime` docs page ([@&#8203;qudlibetor](https://github.com/qudlibetor) [#359](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/359))
> * Migrate from `try!` -> `?` (question mark) because it is now emitting
>   deprecation warnings and has been stable since rustc 1.13.0
> * Deny dead code
