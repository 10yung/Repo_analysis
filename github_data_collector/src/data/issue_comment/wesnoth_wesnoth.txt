This removes the need for the separate file and the giant if chain by using a `std::map` instead.
### Game and System Information
Upcoming 1.14 (I am translating)

### Describe the bug
```
#: src/formula/string_utils.cpp:291
msgid "timespan^$num year"
msgstr ""

#: src/formula/string_utils.cpp:291
msgid "timespan^$num years"
msgstr ""
```

This is wrong and needs to be ngettext format. Same for months etc.

### To Reproduce

Get the string on screen with a locale like `gd` and have it fetch a plural number. I don't know where it is used exactly.

### Expected behavior

#: src/formula/string_utils.cpp:291
```
msgid "timespan^$num year"
msgid_plural "timespan^$num years"
msgstr[0] ""
msgstr[1] ""
msgstr[2] ""
msgstr[3] ""

```
The Naga line of the Dunefolk didn't make much sense to me, but I realize it may have been done with an eye to MP balance, so I tried to be conservative in revisions.  The biggest issue was that the bow seemed to be a reason to use the hunter naga portrait, but was very forced.  Maybe it was for MP balance as well?

In any case, I plan to get basic animation (defense at the very least) for these, but that's not started yet.
If the "system default language" is used then this can activate a translation that is too incomplete to be displayed in the translations list. Should this happen, or should it fall back to English instead?

Context: investigating issue #4692, although my next task is to ask the author of that issue how the language was selected.

Replication:
* pt_PT is 67% translated, and can be recognised by having "Editor do Mapa" on the title screen
* pt_BR is 94% translated, and can be recognised by having "Editor de Mapa" on the title screen
* set the language in the GUI to "system default language"
* run Wesnoth with `LANG=pt.UTF-8` and `LANG=pt_BR.UTF-8`
* note that the `pt.UTF-8` instance is showing the 67% translated language

The replication steps will change slightly if #2558 is fixed.
### Game and System Information
 - 1.15.2, but observed from 1.12 times as well (for 1.14 used workaround, which no longer works due to #4697)

### Describe the bug
wesnoth -p fails when input contains QUICK_4MP_LEADERS orTURNS_OVER_ADVANTAGE
### To Reproduce
Have addonIn/_main.cfg containing `{QUICK_4MP_LEADERS}`
Run `./wesnoth -p addonIn addonOut`

### Expected behavior
QUICK_4MP_LEADERS is expanded

### Actual behavior
```

### Game and System Information
Wesnoth 1.14.5 from Ubuntu repo.
Ubuntu 18.04.3
CPU Intel i7-3770 (4 cores, 8 threads)
Installed add-ons: `Color Changer`, `Ladder Era`, `Mini Isar`, `Plan Unit Advance`.

### Describe the bug
High CPU usage when playing or observing multiplayer game.

### To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Wesnoth and connect to default Mplayer server.
2. According `htop` there is only 1 Wesnoth process and it's eating 1 CPU thread with ~67% usage.
3. Create map (MicroIsar for example) or join as observer to any running game.
4. According `htop` there are 8 Wesnoth process, and all 8 CPU threads now eating. There is still 1 main process with 50-70% and 7 other with ~50%.

### Expected behavior
Intel i7-3770 is a top desktop CPU for one of previous platforms. So, it's very strange behavior from 1 rather simple game to eat it so hard.

### Describe the bug
The statistics dialog has a variable width which depends on the widest row in the currently selected list. Selection of another list causes a change of the width of the dialog.

### To Reproduce
1. Open 'Statistics' and change list

### Expected behavior
Statistics dialog should have a fixed width or at least should not be shrinked 

### Screenshots
The width of the dialog changed when I changed Recruits -> Recalls

### Describe the bug
After playing for about 2 hours the screen suddenly scrambles when scrolling, reproducing tiles over and over again. Moving the cursor ober a unit restores the screen. Scrolling again reproduces the error. Restarting the game with the same savegame does not reproduce the error at once. The error reoccurs after a new playing time of about one to two hours.

### To Reproduce
Play wesnoth for about 2-3 hours.
