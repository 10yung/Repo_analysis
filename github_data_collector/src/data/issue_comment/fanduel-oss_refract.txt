So far every time I've used Refract I've built this exact functionality into every custom handler - think it makes sense for this to be included in the library!

Similar to `toProps` and `asProps`, it's a helper function which triggers a special case in the combined effect handler. It's called like `toCallback('propName')('data')`; if `props.propName` exists, it calls `props.propName('data')`! ðŸŽ‰ 

This is super useful when building reusable components - for example my go-to example of a debounced input component would look like this:

```js
import { withEffects, toCallback, toProps } from 'refract-rxjs'
import { BehaviorSubject, merge, of } from 'rxjs'
import { debounceTime, map, startWith } from 'rxjs/operators'

import Input from './Input'

const aperture = (component, { timeout = 300, value = '' }) => {
	const value$ = new BehaviorSubject(value)
	const onChange = e => value$.next(e.target.value)

	const onChange$ = value$.pipe(
		map(toCallback('onChange'))
	)
	const onCommit$ = value$.pipe(
		debounceTime(timeout),
		map(toCallback('onCommit')),
	)
	const render$ = value$.pipe(
		map(value => toProps({ value })),
	)

	return merge(
		of(toProps({ onChange })),
		render$,
		onChange$,
		onCommit$,
	)
}

export default withEffects(aperture)(Input)
```

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ 

I've already discussed this with @jtmcgrath but I'd like to get everyone involved.

One thing that I really like to do when trying out a new library is to do the introduction (example: <https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/>). I'd like to add one for Refract.

### The introduction
Since the power of Refract lies in the way it handles side effects it makes sense to include side effects in the tutorial which will be handled by Refract. I thought of having a simulated environment where you develop a dashboard that receives data and interact with iot devices (iot devices being JS modules). This dashboard acts as the smart hub of this environment.

### Goals
As of now I have a couple of requirements in the back of my mind;

- Takes at max 1h.
- For some parts of the intro, first write how you'd handle the event in the non-refract way and then refactor it to use refract. To give users a feel of how it improves the code.
- Users should both be inspired and educated about Refract.

Please let me know your thoughts, I've already started a bit on the dashboard environment and I have several questions related to the PR, but first I'd like to hear here what you guys think of it ðŸ˜„ .
