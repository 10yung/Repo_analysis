Raised the minimum deployment target to macOS Sierra. Goodbye Yosemite and El Capitan!
Updated app icons to match the macOS Catalina style. Also to get rid of the white background.

As title, I cannot open the context menu with right click on the icon in menu bar. Left click still works normally.

macOS: 10.15.1
KeepingYouAwake was installed using `brew cask`. I also tried getting the app directly from this github repo but there's no luck.

The weird thing is the right click menu still works on another machine of mine, which also has Catalina 10.15.1. The only difference between the 2 machines is the other one (the working one) was upgraded from Mojave, while this one (not working one) has Catalina installed by default.

If there's some debugging needed, please let me know.

Thanks!

As per https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/issues/115, https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/issues/12 and https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/issues/25
Would it be possible to integrate your commit https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/commit/4b0e1688344ba61a8e05802891a2599b9be4f614 into 1.5.2 and allow the display to sleep but the Macbook to stay awake?

As long as caffeinate -i (which prevents Macbook sleep in any situation but allows display sleep) is used and not caffeinate -s (which prevents Macbook sleep only on charger whilst allowing display sleep) there should be no buggines/unexpected behaviour (re: https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/issues/58 and https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/issues/67) :)
Hi,
I had this working well on High Sierra but rebuilt my mac on Mojave and now can't get it to work. Is anyone else having this problem?

Hello, I wanted to suggest to make this available either as a dmg download from a website or via the Mac App store. The reasoning behind this is that I as a more technical person have no problem going to GitHub and figuring out what to do. But to share this with people who are less technical is a bit more difficult. This is by far one of the essential tools for mac, especially in the workplace.

I think providing simple one page website with some info about what this does and a download would go a long way, even something that published with GitHub pages. Another option is to add it to the Mac App Store but I understand there are extra steps and costs to get there.
