Hello,

Is it possible to disable the session timeout? I want to be logged in permanently on multiple devices.  For some reason I keep getting logged out on Firefox on Android. I can login fine. I've set the remember option to enabled. And I've made the changes below.

$config['recheck_timer']              = 0;
$config['user_expire']                = 0;

		/*$recheck = $this->ion_auth_model->recheck_session();

		// auto-login the user if they are remembered
		if (!$recheck && get_cookie($this->config->item('remember_cookie_name', 'ion_auth')))
		{
			$recheck = $this->ion_auth_model->login_remembered_user();
		}*/

**Which branch are you using?**
3

**What CodeIgniter version are you using?**
v3

**Describe the ~~bug~~ idea**
Its not bug, just idea. 
How about also track another endpoint other than login, like forgot password, reset etc
You know, to prevent abuse

Thank you



Hi Ben
While trying to change 'password' or any other fields of 'users' table, the following error comes.  
"This form post did not pass our security checks"
Your guidance please.

**This Github Issue section is meant to track bugs with the library itself**
Please post generic support issues to the CodeIgniter forums or StackOverflow.

**Describe the bug**
Code:
```php
// In controller
$this->data['identity'] = [
	'name'  => 'identity',
	'id'    => 'identity',
	'type'  => 'text',
	'value' => set_value('identity'),
];

// In view
echo form_input($identity);
```

1. Enter \<h1>Hello\</h1> to field and submit.
2. In input you see "\&lt\;h1\&gt\;Hello\&lt\;/h1\&gt\;" instead your value
3. If you again submit, you see "\&amp\;lt\;h1\&amp\;gt\;Hello\&amp\;lt\;/h1\&amp\;gt;"
4. After you can see "&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;h1&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Hello&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/h1&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;" and etc

Such behavior because CI4 use esc() in set_value() and in form_input.

In controller must replace set_value('...'), to  set_value('...', '', false), because using escape again in form_input
I have a very weird error where it only occurs on my server running Ubuntu but working fine on my local dev running on WAMPserver on Windows 10. FYI, I am running CodeIgniter 3 with WireDesignz HMVC extension.

In all my other module's controllers, which reside in its own folders, eg. modules/cases/controllers/, modules/providers/controllers/, etc... Let me show you my folder and file structure

Example Structure
- modules/

  - auth/
    - controllers/
      - Auth.php
    - views/
      - auth/
        - footer.php
        - header.php
        - login.php

  - cases/
    - controllers/
      - My_cases.php
    - views/
      - private_cases/
        - private_cases_view.php
      - public_cases/
        - public_cases_view.php

In the controller My_cases.php, I am able to load a view file by simply calling:
  `$this->load->view('private_cases/private_cases_view')`

However, in the Auth controller, Auth.php, if I did the same, ie.
  `$this->load->view('auth/login')`
I will get the following error:

> An Error Was Encountered
Unable to load the requested file: auth/login.php

What is even weirder is that it works fine on my local dev environment but I get that error in the remote Ubuntu server. Currently, the only workaround is to add a slash as follows:
  `$this->load->view('/auth/login')`

This have fixed my issue but I wanted to know WHY is it happening? I have done everything exactly as what I did to the other modules, ie cases/ such as setting up routing in config/routes.php but for the life of me, I still don't know why Auth.php is not able to load without the starting slash/.

Hopefully you can help me understand. Thanks.

a CI app having ionAuth implemented is not working with session expire function

application\config\config.php
$config['sess_driver'] = 'database';
$config['sess_cookie_name'] = 'ci_session';
$config['sess_expiration'] = 300;
$config['sess_save_path'] = 'ci_sessions';
$config['sess_match_ip'] = FALSE;
$config['sess_time_to_update'] = 120;
$config['sess_regenerate_destroy'] = FALSE;

application\config\ion_auth.php
$config['user_expire']                = 300;               // How long to remember the user (seconds). Set to zero for no expiration

even the web page is left idle for hours,, still the session is not expired

whereas another CI app without ionAuth is working perfectly with session expire,,,

so please help  to fix this issue
thanks
How can i make use of the Google Authenticator library with IonAuth?

Few steps and methods can help..
My web Admin Pannel not login in Codeignite, How to solve this Problem ?

Mentioned by a user - it's not a big deal but don't find it in the code why this behavior is.

She tried to change from LucZomergem@gmail.com  to luczomergem@gmail.com. It does not work.
With an extra step one can change the email
LucZomergem@gmail.com -> LucZomergem@gmail.co ->luczomergem@gmail.com.

I know that email will work with the capitals - just a technical question.

All email's are not real :-)
