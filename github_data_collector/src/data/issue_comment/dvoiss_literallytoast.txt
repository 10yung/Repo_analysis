Can we burn the message into the toast?  like it was printed into the toast itself? (perhaps via a mask of some sort)
The roadmap mentions a Toast queue as a future feature. While I'm very excited by the prospect of multi-toast, I am concerned at the confusion of queue size with maximum number of simultaneous toasts. You should be able to toast two toasts at the same time, with a queue of "future toasts"(please forgive technical jargon) of almost limitless size. 

## Steps to reproduce:
1. Attempt to toast two slices of bread at once.

## Expected behaviour:
Can toast two slices of bread at once.

## Actual behaviour:
Have to queue with everyone else. Ugh. 

Actually this might be more of an issue with my kitchen than anything else. 
To add to #1, howsabout some...

* Jelly
* Peanut Butter
* Regular butter (probably better off NOT implementing [ButterKnife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife) for this)
* Marmite for those in the upside-down 🙃
Pretty much all in the title. 

Sometimes I like to cook my toast a little longer.
