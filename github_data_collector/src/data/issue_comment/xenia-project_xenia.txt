The non-Windows implementation of bit_scan_forward() is off by one, resulting in LZX decompression failing.

ffs() returns 1 for the least-significant bit and 0 for "no bits set".

Fix: Change both functions (uint32_t, uint64_t) to:
```
*out_first_set_index = i - 1;
```

Note that this will result in out_first_set_index being 0xFFFFFFFF if no 1 bits are found, but the function returns 0 in that case as well.

XEX1 files were used before final Xbox 360 hardware was released. Final X360 hardware uses XEX2

I tested several XEX1 executables (XEDK 1838 samples and Perfect Dark zero XEX1 build) and they usually hang on Unimplemented GPU opcode: 0x59. That opcode is most likely specific for Xenos used in prerelease hardware.

Xenia actually does not crash, but does not render anything on screen (still uses some CPU power).
 
I also tried Perfect Dark Zero XEX1 build, which has similar behavior, but hangs on something different. Suprisingly i once got it to hang on the GPU opcode error, but it doesn't do it always.

**LOGFILES**

Here is logfile of Dolphin XEX1 sample. 
[Dolphin_XEX1.log](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/files/4053513/Dolphin_XEX1.log)


Here is logfile from Perfect Dark Zero XEX1 build. It has very similar behavior, but it hangs on something different.
[PDZ.log](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/files/4053540/PDZ.log)

Another logfile from PDZ. This time it actually displays the GPU Opcode error.
[PDZ2.log](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/files/4053557/PDZ2.log)






While playing some Demos of games, 1 megabyte of log is written every 2 seconds. After playing for a while, the log is 700 megabytes large. When the game crashes, it feels inconvenient to upload it, because it is so large. Is there any way to narrow down the log to only the most relevant information? For example, if a game crashes after playing for an hour, is there any way to determine the last few minutes of gameplay? Does this happen in all games?

It happened for me while using the Dec 4 release of Xenia (latest) while playing Diablo 3, Pixar Up, and Sonic Unleashed. I can test more games if you'd like me to

The rapid speed of writing to log was happening during 3D scenes.
During 2D intro cutscenes, the logs were increasing at a slower rate

seems git tags is gone in the project. the latest build i have with tags working is 1.0.119.1151 builded in 22/05/2018

This error frequently occurs in any games, resulting in the game can not run normally. Remember that there was no this bug before (probably in the last two months) , please fix it as soon as possible, thanks!

Closes #1204.
The current guest-to-host and host-to-guest thunks do not save registers that are volatile on Linux. The current thunk layout also has the memory location for the xmm registers misaligned to 16 bytes, meaning the calls to vmovaps should throw a GP exception even on Windows (follow-up for anyone with Windows: is the struct not being properly packed? After this PR is merged, sizeof(Thunk) should be 0x100, or 256 in decimal, and before this PR gets merged, it should be 0x120, or 288 in decimal.)

This PR saves registers necessary to be saved on Linux as well as changes the layout of the Thunk struct to properly align the xmm register memory locations. The scratch and dummy elements removed from the Thunk struct have so-far been unused since the struct's introduction in 2016.

These changes have been tested on a few games on Windows to ensure emulation still works.
Xenia doesn't print help to command line, for example when running `xenia.exe --help`

~~This was probably an oversight when switching from gflags to our own config system~~ see comment below

output of latest master:
```
D:\mods-n-stuff\Xbox
λ  .\xenia.exe --help

Looped sounds have a short interruption.
Confirmed for rain in Red Dead Redemption and engine sounds in [Midnight Club: Los Angeles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uYtTg30AwM).

These should play seamlessly.
My vague guess is that the XMA codec implementation doesn't handle this correctly.

### Fixes these issues which mainly affect developers debugging:
- Because frame time is calculated based on `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()` a time delta of zero is possible (Value is 100ns resolution but apparently not updated at that rate by the system).

- A new imgui frame is created before it is verified the context isn't lost.
