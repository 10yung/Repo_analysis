After some time blur effect is disappearing on Blur Property animator screen. The best way to reproduce is to hide app (resign active) then activate in again - blur disappears and you see clear image. Further blur value change not working anymore.
Hello,

in the image recognition sample, an improvement could be to highlight the image on the screen when it is recognized. Is it possible with the current APIs?

I have a .pb file from Tensorflow and I would like to implement it into the metal image recognition. I am very new to Swift so any help would be great. thanks.
