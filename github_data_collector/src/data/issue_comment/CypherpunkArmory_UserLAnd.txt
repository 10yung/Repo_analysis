# Describe the issue you are having.

So I'm trying to host a Discord.py bot off my Kali Linux Installation however after some time of not going to ConnectBot, which is the SSH app I use, the infamous, Host has Disconnected error. And it's inconvenient to have to restart the entire python bot just because of time outs

Ive tried disabling Battery Optimization for UserLAnd and ConnectBot and I've turned battery saver OFF. No settings inApp to solve this

# Describe the bug

I don't know, 
is this a bug or not? 
I can only tell this.


# Steps to reproduce the behavior:


I know about the rules of your apk. 
but the day before I had played this and had time to use it for hacking. 
and when installing packages because of their shortcomings. 
I have been waiting for almost 1 day, 
with me using charging, 
but it's all impossible, 
and I uninstalled my charging.

# Describe the issue you are having.

Hello, does basic desktop installation provides some OpenGL (using Mesa) support?
I want to use Firefox browser or VSCode for example and these apps require at least basic OpenGL support. (I plan to use my phone as pocket dev-environment)

# Describe how your task behaves in a regular Linux environment

I've tried to get some information about OpenGL with `glxinfo` and got an error:

```
couldn't find RGB GLX visual or fbconfig
```

Looks like a single solution for now is to start a local X server and use X forwarding via SSH.

# Describe the bug

I installed a fresh instance of Ubuntu from the apps section.
Selected a SSH session and connected to it.
I wanted to access my local phone storage into the linux system, but when I tried to list the components of "host-rootfs" directory it gave me Permission denied though storage permission is granted in the app settings on Android. 

# Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Install a fresh copy of ubuntu.

2. SSH  into it and try to cd into host-rootfs directory.

3. Then list the components either by 'ls' or by "ll" command.

4. It gives permission denied error.

I fixed the problem by installing execstack and running queries.  The stack execute bit is set for these files:
/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libx264.so.152
/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/x264-10bit/libx264.so.152
I cleared the executable stack flag with commands e.g.:
sudo execstack -c /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libx264.so.*
This enabled ffmpeg to work correctly.
Do you need these flags set during installation of your application?  If not, it would be safer if you removed the flags from these libraries.
