Due to known [Virtual Box bug  in Mac OSX Catalina 10.15.2](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/19188), I intend to use VMWare.
Is it possible to use this script just to generate the ISO and use it with VMWare ?
**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Have Catalina 10.15.2 installed, the official installer downloaded from System Update.
2. Clone this script.
3. Run `make all`.
4. VM is created and installation boots, but VM has blank screen, just stays hanging in blank state.

**Expected behavior**

VM should install without errors.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Run script "make all" first time -> Got ERROR: ("Could create or run installer. Please look in the log file...")
2. Remove: 
--applicationpath "$INST_VER"
as it was suggested in log
3. Remove all files which were created in virtual box directory.
4. Run script second time
5. Press enter when it was suggested
6. Got this :

**Expected behavior**
I'd expect to see some processing but nothing happened as it was in demo.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Setup: on macOS 10.14.6 trying to create a Catalina virtual machine
1. run `make all`
2. VirtualBoxVM -> macOS-VM hangs with black screen at the first `Starting VM 'macOS-VM' (3 minutes in the VM)...`
3. when pressing enter it successfully ejects the installer medium and starts the vm ending on `Trying to find a bootable device... Failed.` as of course nothing has been installed in step 2

**Expected behavior**
That it boots the installer medium and Catalina gets installed. 
I used this script earlier to install other versions than Catalina and it always worked like a charm.

**Additional context**
The log file seems fine except for the following error. Not sure what it means though:
```
VBoxManage: error: VDI: cannot create image '/Users/fakob/VirtualBox VMs/macOS-VM.efi.vdi'

Had the Oracle Extension Pack installed when setting up a 10.14 Mojave and a 10.15 Catalina VMs, as required by this script.

But was able to have them run properly for many weeks without an Extension Pack. I think I only had to downgrade the USB controller to _USB 1.1 (OHCI) Controller_ for them.

Just a FYI… Maybe worth adding an entry to README? Not sure if the installation would also work without the Extension Pack, but that would be great.
**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Download upgrade and Reboot
2. Boot on Catalina (not booting on macOS install data)
3. macOS version is still 10.15.1

**Expected behavior**
The upgrade from 10.15 to 10.15.1 works,
but the upgrade from 10.15.1 to 10.15.2 is not booting on the macOS install data.

**Additional context**
 - The disk with startup script is in the VM (sata 1) and the main disk is sata 2
 - no boot by hand in the shell
 - Clover wont boot either

Great project, worked like a charm.  Would be worth noting in the help that the dmg files and sparseimage files created by the script can be deleted after the VM is up and running, to save disk space.

Or, delete them automatically from the script. 
Host macOS Catalina on a MacBook Pro
Guest macOS Catalina

`make all` creates the VM and boots the installation, but after selecting the language
the screen "Mac OS Utilities" is shown.
I can select "Install macOS" (or any other entry) but can't continue because the "Continue" button is disabled.

**Expected behavior**
Being able to continue installation

I've used [this tool](https://github.com/chilcote/vfuse) which is very similar to your's, but for VMWare Fusion. The major feature I used with it is to set the serial number which is required for my use case. Have you considered adding that feature to this package?
Hi again!

Had struggle a bit to access recovery in this setup, so I tried to improve the README with my finds.

Thanks!
