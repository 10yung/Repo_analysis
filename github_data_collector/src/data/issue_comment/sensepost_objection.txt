I tried to intercept HTTPS traffic of an iOS app, which didn't quite work. Neither with SSL Kill Switch 2 nor with objection.

Objection throws following error / message:
`Called nw_tls_create_peer_trust(), no working bypass implemented yet.`

Is it possible to implement a bypass for this method?
I have noticed that a strict dependency has been added in the following commit
https://github.com/sensepost/objection/commit/24c0e8effb91e44cb3f61ee206a09fd04097e984
```litecli==1.1.0```

This is not necessary probably. Please avoid a specific version requirement unless it is absolutely necessary 
**Describe the bug**
After successfully patching an apk file to include the frida gadget, once installed on the device, I get an error message through logcat 'D/ApkSoSource: not allowing consideration of lib/arm64-v8a/libfrida-gadget.so: deferring to libdir'.

I decompiled the patched apk and the frida gadget shared library is in the libs folder under the target architecture so its definitely there. I also just copied the .so file to all other subfolders just to be sure but I had the same error.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Run command 'objection patchapk --source app.apk'
2. Run command 'adb install app.objection.apk'
3. Run the app on the device.

**Expected behavior**
The frida gadget should successfully run and I should be able to connect to it using 'objection explore'

**Evidence / Logs / Screenshots**
Any output from objection, such as stack traces or errors that occurred. Be sure to run objection with the `--debug` flag so that errors from the agent are verbose enough to debug. For example:

```text
objection --debug explore
[debug] Agent path is: /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/objection/agent.js

Logcat

```

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - Device: Samsung Galaxy S8
 - OS: Android 9
 - Frida Version 12.8.1
- Objection Version 1.8.3
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
iOS app can use app groups for sharing data between the main app and extensions like the share extension. If an app uses an app group, all the data shared via that app group is stored in a separate folder (`/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/SomeOtherGUIDNotTheAppGuid`)

When I run `env` for an iOS app it does not list app group directories used by the app. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The solution would be to detect app group directories and list them when using  `env`. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
An alternative is using tools like [cda](https://github.com/ay-kay/cda) than list the app group directories.

Dear All, I'm a security anlyst of QuantumLeap-Deloitte and during an activity I had some problems extracting a IPA file containing Chinese characters, so  I thought to add a support for the unicode encoding.

crashes on:
 android hooking set return_value appuri.myMethod true

**Describe the bug**
PatchApk fails with UnicodeDecodeError when certain languages are present in the application name.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Have an APK which has application name in languages such as ukranian, bulgarian etc.
2. PatchApk fails with UnicodeDecodeError with this exception: 
[objectionexception.txt](https://github.com/sensepost/objection/files/3891968/objectionexception.txt)


Looking at the exception you can see that it fails while running `aapt dump badging app.apk`
Attached is the aapt output. 
[badgdump.txt](https://github.com/sensepost/objection/files/3891954/badgdump.txt)

It fails only one some languages, Arabic works well but Ukranian fails.

I had to manually remove all such resource values and then recompile the app for PatchApk to run successfully.


**Environment (please complete the following information):**
Latest objection version, python 3.6, Windows 10

Can the objection client be run directly on Android using termux? Installing it with pip seemed like it might work but then it failed partway through. It appears that some of the frida support is available on termux though. Any idea whether this is doable?
