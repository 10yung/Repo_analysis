*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

I have few proposals related to the great  [news](https://github.com/STRd6/glitch.com/issues/2) :smile:
Jadelet, because of its simplicity and aesthetics, is also my favorite choice whenever possible.
So, I would like to see it moving forward and am ready to help.
I already made some "improvements" (not published yet), i.e., upgrade to CoffeeScript 2, replaced deprecated packages (`wrench` => `through2`). And, last but not least, #21 and [#6](https://github.com/distri/observable/pull/6).
I also started playing with adding support for template compiling (similar to #18) to different bundlers. I began with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org), which is my preferred choice. 

Example:

- main.coffee
```coffeescript
import jadelet from "jadelet"
import Tmpl from "./templates/intro.jadelet"

main = 
  name: "Joe"

document.getElementById("app").appendChild Tmpl main
```

- template (`templates/intro.jadelet`)
```pug
h1 Hello #{@name}
```

Plugins for other bundlers (Webpack, Rollup) could be prepared as well.
I think this would make an easier start for new users.

Let me know.

Would it be wrong if the missing root element is automatically added:

So

```jade
.one               
.two
```

becomes

```jade
div
  .one               
  .two
```

I did a test with a small change in the `compiler.coffee`, and it works.

```coffeescript
compile = (parseTree, {compiler, runtime, exports}={}) ->
  if parseTree.length > 1
    parseTree = [{tag: "div", children: parseTree}]
```

The only caveat here is that the HTML output might not be what the user expects.
Correct me if I am wrong, but I couldn't find a guide to language features after taking some time googling. Having a document telling about how to write a template, whether we need an accompanying coffeescript file or not and such would be real nice.
