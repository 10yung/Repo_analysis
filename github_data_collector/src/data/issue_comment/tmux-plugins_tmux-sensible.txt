I tried this plugin but it seems to break my prefix key which is \ (backslash).  I have been using this prefix key for years.  I find it ideal on a UK keyboard and it doesn't conflict with anything.

I have now disabled this plugin because of this issue.  It must be because it does not escape \ by using another \\, ie. \\\

Repro:

```
$ tmux
$ echo $TERM
screen
$ tmux -V
tmux 2.8
$ tmux show-option -sv default-terminal
screen
$ grep default ~/.tmux.conf
$
$ tmux set-option -s default-terminal screen-256color
$ tmux show-option -sv default-terminal
screen-256color
$
```

Not sure how to fix this in an easy way.
Hey, I just found this:
```
# Start windows and panes at 1, not 0
set -g base-index 1
setw -g pane-base-index 1
```

Could this be made standard in this?
I'd like to just patch that in.
Error message reads:
     unknown-option: default-terminal
Update the numbering when a window is killed.
Call me an outcast, but I never got onboard with the C-a/C-b prefix. My prefix is `` ` `` (backtick), which I have been using without issues for over 6 years. I'm not alone, I've met other developers who do the same, although this binding is rare. In case you're wondering, it does not create issues with languages using backtick in code for the following reasons:

- use of backtick is typically an anti-pattern that can be replaced with cleaner syntax (i.e. perl)
- use of backtick is very rare and my binding of pressing backtick twice to insert a literal backtick handles these rare cases just fine (even in JS, which embraced this abomination in ES6)

This is rather low priority since I can easily modify/comment out that part of config, but I just wanted to point this alternative out since tmux-sensible is supposed to be settings *everyone* can agree on.
C-a is last-window, a is send-prefix.

This is consistent with screen bindings; C-a C-a toggles to last window,
and C-a a sends the command character.

last-window is usually also needed more often, so it makes sense to make
it more accessible.

Fixes #40.
See: https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard/issues/66

Try, e.g., `bind-key -T copy-mode C-\ send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "pbcopy"`

I have the following in my .tmux.conf to switch windows with alt-h and alt-l:

```
bind -n M-h previous-window                                                      
bind -n M-l next-window
```

and sometimes with `escape-time` set to 0 by tmux-sensible, then `^[h` or `^[l` will be echoed in the terminal rather than switching windows. Setting `escape-time` to 10 seems to fix the problem without adding any noticeable delays when pressing esc elsewhere (for example in Vim) â€“ could this be made the default in tmux-sensible?
