See the below error ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17594572/63595914-5e686680-c5ba-11e9-8a51-ca1177e8a8b2.png)
The problem is with the signature which needs to be used to sign the URL, [see docs here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/get-api-key#gen_sig). You can 'Allow unsigned usage' but I'm not a fan of doing that. I think fixing it requires changes to the code. I'll fork and make a pull request if I work it out.
Hi,

I am unable to make the function working. I have Matlab R2019a and below you will find my code and the error I get:


```
plot_google_map('apiKey', '<A********************8>')

Undefined operator '*' for input arguments of type
'matlab.graphics.axis.Axes'.
```

The string "A********************8" is my apikey. 

How can I solve the problem?

Thank you.

Best regards,
When I try to zoom in or out with the mouse wheel quickly the zoom it is not working as expected. Zooming out results in zooming in. Using the zoom in cursor, I currently use the shift key and mouse click to zoom out. Is there a way to fix the mouse wheel zoom?
