Hello,
using createNewMgmtGroup.json and New-AzMgmtGroupDeployment.ps1
Management Group Deployment fails with:

Hi,
I am trying to deploy the template. It does not work. It shows this error:

"Template deployment returned the following errors:
16:06:55 - 4:06:49 PM - Resource Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups 'lsh' failed with message '{
16:06:55 -   "message": "No HTTP resource was found that matches the request URI 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/fcebdb0c-44cf-4d89-8248-e9acdbafd358/resourcegroups/lsh4/providers/Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups/lsh?api-version=2018-05-01'."

Any idea what is wrong?
Hi Kristian,

Your template seems to be solution I'm looking for but I'm not able to set up workspace using resource "Microsoft.Security/workspaceSettings". To  be 100% sure that I'm passing correct values I've used the same Request Body as I provided in ARM template in REST API PUT method and it has worked for me here : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/securitycenter/workspacesettings/create. 

But when I'm trying to use VS for template deployment I'm constantly receiving this error:
"error": {
"code": "BadRequest",
"message": ""
}

by exploring API for microsft.security provider I have found also setting for Microsoft.Security/autoProvisioningSettings, I think that would be useful to enable this during deployment, but I got exact same error as above.
