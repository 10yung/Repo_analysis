if enemies appear just right next to the rocket, it probably will die.

I thought now they appear randomly, and the program should detect where the rocket is and avoid this case.
Hi @aochagavia , I have already follow the steps on the hellorust website in order to set up everything. But when I run following command:

`cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`

I get a error as following:

`PS D:\Test\Rust\rocket_wasm> rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
info: component 'rust-std' for target 'wasm32-unknown-unknown' is up to date
PS D:\Test\Rust\rocket_wasm> cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core`
  |
  = note: the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target may not be installed

error: aborting due to previous error`

Can you help me to resolve the issue? thanks very much...

Right now the only possible way to play is by using a keyboard. This makes it impossible to play the game on your phone. It would be worthwhile to add touch screen support.

Fortunately, supporting touch screens only requires modifications to [index.html](https://github.com/aochagavia/rocket_wasm/blob/master/html/index.html). Concretely, the input handling code from line 141 to 159 needs to be adapted.
