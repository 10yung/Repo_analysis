**What happened**:
I am testing API Priority and Fairness.  I launched it like this:
```
RUNTIME_CONFIG=flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1alpha1=true FEATURE_GATES=APIPriorityAndFairness=true LOG_LEVEL=7 hack/local-up-cluster.sh
```

After the logging said the cluster is running and told me how to set KUBECONFIG, I did so in another shell and went looking for FlowSchema objects.  But kubectl erroneously told me there is no such thing.

```
$ kubectl get Pod -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   kube-dns-74b889989-jh8zn   3/3     Running   0          49s

$ kubectl get flowschemas
error: the server doesn't have a resource type "flowschemas"

$ kubectl get flowschemas.flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io
error: the server doesn't have a resource type "flowschemas"

$ kubectl get flowschemas.v1alpha1.flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io
error: the server doesn't have a resource type "flowschemas"
```

However, looking in the kube-apiserver log shows flowschemas and prioritylevelconfigurations being read and written; for example:
```
I0118 06:00:08.222289   75066 httplog.go:90] verb="GET" URI="/apis/flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1alpha1/flowschemas/catch-all" latency=954.726Âµs resp=200 UserAgent="kube-apiserver/v1.18.0 (linux/amd64) kubernetes/916edd9" srcIP="[::1]:48830": 
```

Also, I am able to read them with `curl` against the insecure port.

Interestingly, the kube-apiserver log also includes this complaint:
```
I0118 05:58:05.655870   75066 aggregator.go:182] Skipping APIService creation for flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1alpha1
```

I will attach the kube-apiserver log.

**What you expected to happen**:
I expected `kubectl get flowschemas` to list them.

**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:
I think the report above is pretty minimal.

**Anything else we need to know?**:
