Hi,

Do you have any plans for migration from now deprecated untyped macros? I am not still sure if this is going to work, but maybe one could provide `implicit` views from `Monad[A]`/`Functor[A]` to `A` (e.g. with a `@compileTimeOnly` annotation), so that the code typechecks, and the macro would just disregard them, replacing with `map`s or `bind`s. What do you think?
