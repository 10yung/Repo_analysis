Fix code style
Previously, I had this code:

	- (void)setView:(UIView *)view hiddenAtEndOfAnimation:(BOOL)hidden atPage:(Page)page {

		IFTTTHideAnimation *hideAnimation = [[IFTTTHideAnimation alloc] initWithView:view];

		[hideAnimation addKeyFrame:[[IFTTTAnimationKeyFrame alloc] initWithTime:page.left andHidden:!hidden]];
		[hideAnimation addKeyFrame:[[IFTTTAnimationKeyFrame alloc] initWithTime:page.right - 1 andHidden:!hidden]];

		[hideAnimation addKeyFrame:[[IFTTTAnimationKeyFrame alloc] initWithTime:page.right andHidden:hidden]];

		[self.contentAnimator addAnimation:hideAnimation];
	}

but with the latest version, this is impossible, as there is no simple `init` that only sets the view. Highly dissapointed.
I apologize if this question seems basic to some, but I am a bit of a newbie. I have tried for hours to tweak the demo code to make the animation execute on a normal uiviewcontroller (not the scrollview that they provide). I would really appreciate any feedback. Is this possible? Thank you!


Hi, I used your JazzHands to build a app guide page.
and found a little issue about position of animation issue in iOS 7.0.3 while in other version of iOS is fine.
I made a demo about how that issue appears. 
here is the repo : https://github.com/lane128/WLJazzHandsDemo

here is the incorrect position after animation. (iOS 7.0.3)

Hope you can help me to solve it.
Thanks.

Any really simple way to get a callback when specific page is shown?

If not trivial do you think it make sense to add it on 

```
- (void)animateCurrentFrame {
    [super animateCurrentFrame];
    if(floorf(self.pageOffset) == self.pageOffset) {
      // did scroll to page self.pageOffset
    }
}
```

should it be implemented directly in the lib as a method to subclass or even a delegate?

what do you think?
