### Description

<!-- Description of the issue -->

I am not sure, if this can be classified as a bug or not but it was a bit annoying so I think I might put this out as an observation.

On my mac, when I double click on the Atom title bar, Atom window just vanishes. You might think that it crashed or was closed for some reason.

When I try opening Atom again, from the dock no window opens. No matter how many times you try opening Atom again, it opens but with no window.

I realise, there is a faint line at the bottom left corner of the screen and I drag it and pull it to increase window size only to realise it is the Atom window that it was minimized to the extent of making it seem invisible on the screen.

After the window is maximised and I quit Atom, next time Atom opens up maximised.

### Versions

Atom Version 1.43.0

I unchecked 'Automatically download updates', yet Atom still periodically updates itself, and in doing so completely breaks my environment. 

The reason why I cannot let Atom update itself is because apm does not work behind corporate proxies (has been this way for years now). When update happens, Hydrogen stops working because it was built for an earlier version of Atom.

It is actually very interesting how **Atom updater is able to work with the same corporate proxy, but apm can't.**

### Description
I have noticed unusually high CPU usage just by having the Atom Editor open, 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38223298/72379499-6b503880-36c8-11ea-990d-70b032745bb8.png)
I have also noticed that the Windows 10 Antimalware Service Executable begins using an unusually high amount of CPU power when the Atom Editor is open, which goes away by closing the editor.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open Atom Editor (Fresh install or extensions doesn't matter)
2. Check the task manager
3. Notice both the Atom Editor and the Windows Antimalware Service Executable using an average of 30% CPU each. (It varies slightly depending on the device though)

**Expected behavior:**

A more normal amount of CPU usage, and for it not to affect the Windows Antimalware Service Executable.

**Actual behavior:**

High CPU usage from both the Atom Editor and the Windows Antimalware Service Executable 

**Reproduces how often:**

Reproduces 100% of the time on multiple systems I have tested.

### Versions

OS: Windows 10
I am unsure when it started, I have tested and experienced this problem on 1.39.0, 1.39.1, 1.40.0, 1.41.0, and 1.43.0

### Additional Information

I have tested with both a Microsoft Surface Book 2 laptop that has an 8th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-8650U with 16GB of RAM, And an HP Pavilion desktop with an Intel® Core™ i3-8100 and 8GB of RAM, both have the same problem with the I7 seeing an average of 32% CPU usage, and the I3 seeing an average of 29% CPU usage.

I have tried both a fresh Atom & Windows Install so there is no third-party program that could affect the CPU. Because it's a fresh Atom install it also can't be any plugins installed in atom. 

The size and type of files open in editor does not appear matter.

### Description

After some minutes using Atom `kernel_task` takes a disproportioned amount of CPU and the computer becomes unusable, meaning clicking on any button in firefox or any other application reacts after seconds (sometimes 10 or more).

<img width="292" alt="Screenshot 2020-01-12 at 17 22 33" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1309648/72222826-e8f93480-3560-11ea-9355-558253cf4627.png">

The only way to stop this is closing Atom.

This is a typical pattern for the CPU Load opening and then closing Atom.

<img width="598" alt="Screenshot 2020-01-12 at 17 25 18" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1309648/72222827-e991cb00-3560-11ea-9b02-a9ce547f5ac9.png">

I tried:
- removing `.atom/storage`
- disabling most of the addons I use, one by one, nothing worked
- `atom --safe`

This seems to be happening since when I upgraded to Catalina but I'm not 100% sure.

### Steps to Reproduce

Open and use Atom normally.

**Expected behavior:**

Everything should run smoothly for the whole day.

**Actual behavior:**

The computer becomes unusable after a while, sometimes minutes, sometimes an hour or so.

**Reproduces how often:**

Every time I use Atom.

---

Keep in mind that Atom is highly customizable in a number of ways and we strongly prefer that you consider these options before filing this issue:

* https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/: tweak Atom's configuration, styles, and keybindings.
* https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/: install a community package.
* https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/: use the Atom API in your init script, to create a package, or to enhance an existing package.

If you're convinced that none of these options are appropriate for the feature you want, please explain why that's the case by completely filling out the issue template below.

Also note that the Atom team has finite resources so it's unlikely that we'll work on feature requests. If we're interested in a particular feature however, we'll follow up and ask you to submit an RFC to talk about it in more detail.

-->

## Summary

I installed atom using the apt repo and .deb file. Both methods did not automatically install the 'build-essential' dependency that was needed to install packages within atom.
## Motivation

Let others have an easy way to solve similar issue.

## Describe alternatives you've considered

Could also just updated installation documents.

## Additional context

I am using Lubuntu 18.04 as my OS.

### Description

`Atom .` is dropping the `\` in file path following drive id (eg Z:\file.example.txt is loading as Z:file.example.txt) when using a network share as a mapped drive. 

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Map a network drive on a Win10 Home machine ( for eg as Z:\ )
2. Install atom using the official installer v1.42.0
3. Open cmd.exe
4. Move to drive ( z: )
5. Execute Atom ( atom . )

**Expected behavior:**

The file path to include the trailing slash on file path. such as Z:\example.file 

**Actual behavior:**

The file path drops the slash such as z:example.file
The file and folder contents display correctly and load. 
Ctrl+S works to save existing files etc etc.
The problem becomes annoying when you need to amend the filepath such as rename file for example (right click rename) - the new file path is autoloaded incorrectly which prohibits saving  without amending the slash issue first.  

**Reproduces how often:**

Constant issue including safe mode.
