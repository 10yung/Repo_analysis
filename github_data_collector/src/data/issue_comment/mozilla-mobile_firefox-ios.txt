Steps to reproduce:

    Get on a phone, load up a screen reader
    Go on the bbc.com site (Not the site I work on, but a generally accepted good accessible site)
    Navigate to the skiplinks by swiping

Actual results:

Skiplinks don’t show on screen on mobile.

Browsers/screen readers? don't use/implement? the pseudo class :focus on mobile.

Personally, our site has skiplinks and hidden close buttons for modal dialogs that are broken on mobile but work fine on desktop. When the close button/skiplink is read out by a screen reader on mobile, it does not appear on screen. And that's because we rely on the :focus class being applied to make hidden items visible.  
(Quick caveat: Users that don't use a screen reader just have to click anywhere on the screen to escape/select an option in our modal dialogs, so we aren't concerned with not showing the close button to them. And while hiding the close button until it is focused is a purely stylistic choice on our end, we should still be allowed/have the resources available to do it on all platforms.)

Expected results:

Skiplinks show up visible on screen on mobile.

More specifically, that developers are given some notice that an element is being read out by a screen reader on mobile.

Build: master 1c5d218
Device: iPhone Xr
iOS: 13.3

There's a new feature for sharing an entire web page as a link, a PDF, or in Reader view from the Share Sheet, and through the "Options" interface, you can choose whether to send content as a PDF or a Web Archive. By default, though, ‌iOS 13‌ will pick "the most suitable format" for each app or action.

Build: master 1c5d218
Device: iPhone Xr
iOS: 13.3

Steps to reproduce:
When having a lot of tabs opened, opening a new tab going to a website will most likely result in having two tabs opened with the same page. 

Expected results:
When you start typing the address of a website that's already open in another tab, Safari will direct you to the open tab in ‌iOS 13‌ rather than opening up a new tab. This makes sure you don't open unnecessary tabs. It would be a great asset to also have this feature in Firefox.

Steps to reproduce:

When having a list of links, it is convenient to open some of them in new tabs to not loose the list of links.

Actual results:

To open a link in a new background tab, a long press is required and then "open in new tap" must be chosen from menu.

Expected results:

In Safari mobile, pressing on a link with two fingers, opens the link directly in a new background tab (this feature can be flipped on/off from the Safari settings). 
Would be a very convenient addition to Firefox. Also because this behaviour is expected from users coming from safari mobile.

Steps to reproduce:

Navigate to an IPv6 address like "http://[2a01:4f8:c0c:4925::10]".

Actual results:

Firefox submits the address to Google as a search term.

Expected results:

The browser should have navigated to the IPv6 address.

Notes:
- This is not reproducible on Chrome. 
- Reproducible in Safari.
It is currently ambiguous what "Enabled for this site" means on the menu that comes up whenyou click on the shield icon.
