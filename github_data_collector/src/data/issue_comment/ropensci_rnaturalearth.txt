This happens both with the CRAN and the devtools versions of this package.

```r
eu_sf <- ne_countries(scale = 50, returnclass = 'sf')
eu_sf %>% dplyr::filter(iso_a2 == 'FR') %>% nrow()
[1] 0
```
Is the same with `iso_a3` or other fields. France is missing. It is instead present when the `scale` is 110. 
So after clean install using the latest "rnaturalearth" on Windows 7 (R 3.5.3):

The URL seems strange to me:
http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_admin_0_countries.zip

Command that I ran:
`countries10 <- ne_download(scale = 10, type = 'countries', category = 'cultural', returnclass = "sf")`


```
Error in utils::download.file(file.path(address), zip_file <- tempfile()) : cannot open URL 'http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_admin_0_countries.zip'
2.
utils::download.file(file.path(address), zip_file <- tempfile())
1.
ne_download(scale = 10, type = "countries", category = "cultural", returnclass = "sf")
```

Recently I had several times problems when a student had to use the function `ne_countries (scale = 10)`.  The rnaturalearth package was installed correctly, but it required to install again without resolving the issue. It seems that the pacckage "rnaturalearthhires" fail to download or install. I don't know why. Any thoughts about this? 

Thanks!
This is not (only) a political issue, but rather a call for consistency in the `rnaturalearth` database.

Indeed, this is what happens at the `small` scale.

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
library(rnaturalearth)

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data=ne_countries(scale='small', returnclass = 'sf'), size = 0.2) + 
  geom_sf(data=ne_countries(scale = 'small', country = 'Russia', returnclass = 'sf'), fill = 'red') +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(25,45), ylim = c(40,50))

```

And this is what happens at the `medium` and `large` level.

The reason can't simply be that Crimea is a small area disregarded by the `small` scale, as Kaliningrad Oblast is correctly included at all levels, despite having a smaller surface than Crimea (15000 vs 27000 km²).

I am in no position to suggest the best action to take. I can only suggest to have a look at the solution proposed by [the OpenStreetMap Data Working Group](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Working_Group_Minutes/DWG_2014-06-05_Special_Crimea) or [to simply follow the relevant UN resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_68/262).
- [x] a function that returns up to date list/dataframe of vector data sources with filenames that can be used in `ne_download()`

- [ ] `check_data_exist()` could cross reference against this instead of the csv that is manually updated currently.

My suggestion is to use `httr` and the Github API to checking folders in the [Natural Earth Repo](https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector). 

Because as of right now the file is actually called

`ne_10m_admin_0_disputed_areas.zip`

without the `breakaway_`, inconsistent with other scales.

The workaround is to give the type as `admin_0_disputed_areas` and ignore the warnings.
Hi, 

Excited to play around with the package. Possibly an error on my end, but it seems that the current set up for first time installation has some issues with auto installing the dependencies, specifically httr and DBI. 
Errors:
- Installation failed: there is no package called ‘httr’
and 
- Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘rnaturalearth’:
 - object ‘dbExecute’ is not exported by 'namespace:DBI'

I manually installed both and am now up and running.

The `sf` package is becoming more and more popular. It is also a successor of the `sp` pacakge. 
Perhaps it is a good idea to change a returnclass default argument to 'sf'?
It could be useful to consider usage of [R package `countrycode`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/countrycode/index.html) for the implementation of "Potential additional data"/"dataframe with ISO3 and country synonyms"
