Hi. I've created a custom apollo-link, https://github.com/Quramy/apollo-link-fragment-argument . Would you append a link about this to community link docs ?
Not sure how to do this step without first opening a PR:
`- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with your change`


**Expected Behavior**
If a mutation/query sent over a WebSocket doesn't respond back in time, I don't want apollo-link-ws to try and post the same operation again. Is this possible somehow?

**Actual Behavior**
When the WebSocket client connection is closed (due to timeout or whatever), it is re-created and any pending mutations/queries that were sent over the WebSocket will be retried.

I'm attempting to use apollo-link-schema along with schema stitching, but this doesn't appear possible since the schema option doesn't support promises. Using graphql purely client-side is a [common use case](https://blog.hasura.io/client-side-graphql-schema-resolving-and-schema-stitching-f4d8bccc42d2/), but the inability to pass in a promise (the creation of a merged schema) prevents me from using this package. :/ Can we add the ability to pass in a promise? 

For now, I'm able to do the following:
```js
const clientLink = new ApolloLink(operation => {
  return new Observable(observer => {
    Promise.resolve(createSchema())
      .then(data => {
        return execute(
          data,
          operation.query,
          null,
          operation.getContext(),
          operation.variables,
          operation.operationName,
        )
      })
      .then(data => {
        if (!observer.closed) {
          observer.next(data)
          observer.complete()
        }
      })
      .catch(error => {
        if (!observer.closed) {
          observer.error(error)
        }
      })
  })
})
```

But, I would much prefer to use apollo-link-schema which has a much cleaner and explicit syntax.
**Expected Behavior**
Expected `context` arg in SchemaLink from `apollo-link-schema` to allow async (e.g. returning a promise)

Wanted to mirror this functionality: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/master/packages/apollo-server-core/src/ApolloServer.ts#L732-L743. Apollo Server allows `context` to be async because of these lines. 

**Actual Behavior**
`context` arg does not allow promises as a return. Workaround is to `await context` in respective resolvers (Workaround 1), or override `SchemaLink.request`  (Workaround 2) 

**A _simple_ reproduction**

Expect: `Hello User ${number}`!
Actual: `Hello `!

Is there any way to selectively batch operations so that:
- we do not batch certain operations
- specify a longer internal / max count for certain operations?
