The order of the close button and title was incorrect IMHO. I swapped them over.
To be able to display flash messages accross multiple page requests which add additional flash messages the flash_notification session key needs to be preserved.

This solves #128 for me. With the existing pull request I got duplicate messages.
Hi,
currently, only available for the Bootstrap framework, is it available for the TailwindCSS framework?

Thank you for the helpful package!
Changed it so that anything above 5.0.0 is acceptable. The likelihood of a Laravel version bringing a breaking change for this package is extremely low and this saves adding a new version constraint every 6 months to follow semver.
A small change in the modal view that allows for localization of the close button.
Was displaying 1 instead of "flash-modal" or user defined $modalClass in the view. 
```php
<?php

namespace Tests;

use Illuminate\Support\Collection;
use Laracasts\Flash\Message;

trait TestFlashMessages
{
    protected function flashMessages(): Collection
    {
        return $this->app['session']->get('flash_notification');
    }

    protected function flashMessagesForLevel(string $level)
    {
        return $this->flashMessages()->filter(function (Message $message) use ($level) {
            return $message->level === $level;
        });
    }
}
```

I use this for testing, sharing here incase anyone wants to flesh it out and add it to the package. Happy to submit this PR myself too, just comment and let me know.

Example use:

```php
// check for success
$this->assertCount(1, $this->flashMessagesForLevel('success'));

// check for error
$this->assertCount(1, $this->flashMessagesForLevel('warning'));
```

Alerts not working in bootstrap 4 theme
I have been using the flash overlays.

I have them working in one of my views absolutely fine.

However in another it is generating the HTML for the overlay but missing the show at the end of the class which means the overlay modal remains hidden.

Flash message being passed from controller:
`flash()->overlay(
            'Quote Added Successfully please see
             Summary of Quote below:', 'Quote Added Successfully', 'notify');`

I have amended some of the laracasts flash files to include a custom class 'notify' or any class i wish to create.:
FlashNotifier.php
`
    public function overlay($message = null, $title = 'Notice', $customClass = null)
    {
        if (! $message) {
            return $this->updateLastMessage(['title' => $title, 'overlay' => true]);
        }
        return $this->message(
            new OverlayMessage(compact('title', 'message', 'customClass'))
        );
    }`
and 
Modal.blade.php
`<div id="flash-overlay-modal" class="{{ $customClass }} modal fade {{ $modalClass or '' }}">`
    


This are the only changes i have made. 

Working a dream on one view but not on another.

Double checked JQuery hasnt been added twice too.
