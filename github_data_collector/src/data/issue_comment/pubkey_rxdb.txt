## Case
Feature Request

## Issue
Currently GraphQL based replication does not support syncing revisions. The documentation mentions that the server needs to resolve conflicts. However often for the server to even detect conflicts it needs to have some kind of versioning information. Further for many use cases some kind of user intervention is required for resolving a conflict (i.e the server cannot completely auto resolve conflicts). It would therefore be useful if there was a mechanism to sync the version data as well. 

I can think of the following approach to implementing this: add two new fields to the syncGraphQL options: syncRevisions (boolean) and revisionField (string). If these options are set then:

1) the pushQueryBuilder would get the pouchdb revision along with the rest of the doc
2) for every document pulled using the pullQueryBuilder we can create the revision using the value of the revisionField + endpointHash + plugin ident before storing into pouchdb.

If the approach sounds correct, I can try to make a pull request.

Based on the last [user survey](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/issues/1411), I have worked out some changes that I want to make in the next major release of RxDB.
Please start discussions and improvements in this issue.


## Move rxjs into a plugin instead of having it internal
RxDB relies heavily on rxjs. This made it easy in the past to handle the data flow inside of RxDB and also created feature-rich interfaces for users when they want to observe data.
As long as you have rxjs in your project anyways, like you would have in an angular project, there is no problem with that.
As soon as a user has another data-handling library like redux or mobx, rxjs increases the build size by 22kb (5kb gzipped) and also adds the burden to map rxjs observables into the own state management.

The change would ensure that rxjs is no longer used inside of RxDB. And also there will be a RxDB-plugin which offers the same observable-features as there are today, but optional.
This would also allow us to create plugins for mobx or react-hooks in the future.

## Move pouchdb into a plugin
When I started creating RxDB, I used the best solution for a noSQL storage engine that I could find.
This was pouchdb. Not only because it is a very mature project, but also because it has adapters for so many environments.
The problem with pouchdb is the build size of 30kb (gziped, with indexeddb adapter) and also the performance decrease by it's overhead which comes from how it handles it's revision tree.

The change would ensure that the storage-engine is abstracted in a way that I can be swapped out by any other noSQL database out there. Users could then use different storage engines, depending if they want smaller builds or better performance. For example there are these out there:
- NeDB
- Minimongo
- Dexie.js
- [Worker-Pouch](https://github.com/pouchdb-community/worker-pouch). 
- Or any database with a changestream like Postgre, mongo etc.

This would also make it possible to use RxDB together with [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) in the future. 
Pouchdb will still be the default in the main build.


## Make RxDcouments immutable
At the current version of RxDB, RxDocuments mutate themself when they recieve ChangeEvents from the database.
For example when you have a document where `name = 'foo'` and some update changes the state to `name = 'bar'` in the database, then the previous javascript-object will change it's own property to the have `doc.name === 'bar'`.
This feature is great when you use a RxDocument with some change-detection like in angular or vue templates. You can use document properties directly in the template and all updates will be reflected in the view, without having to use observables or subscriptions.

However this behavior is also confusing many times. When the state in the database is changed, it is not clear at which exact point of time the objects attribute changes. Also the self-mutating behavior created some problem with vue- and react-devtools because of how they clone objects.

Also, to not confuse with fast changes that happen directly after each other, the whole json-data-to-RxDocument-piple has to be synchronous. With the change, this can be async which will allow us to have async post-result-transformations, like an asynchronous encryption plugin (with the Web Crypto API) or also move things into a webworker.

The change would make all RxDocuments immutable. When you subscribe to a query and the same document is returned in the results, this will always be a new javascript object.

## Use immutable objects instead of deep-cloning stuff
RxDB often uses outgoing data also in the internals. For example the result of a query is not only send to the user, but also used inside of RxDB's query-change-detection. To ensure that mutation of the outgoing data is not changing internal stuff, which would cause strange bugs, outgoing data is always deep-cloned before. This is a common practice on many javascript libraries.
The problem is that deep-cloning big objects can be very CPU expensive.
So instead of doing a deep-clone, RxDB will assume that outgoing data is immutable.
If the users wants to modify that data, it has be be deep-cloned by the user.
To ensure immutability, RxDB will use [deep-freeze](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze) in the dev-mode (about same expensive as deep clone). Also typescript will throw a build-time error because we will use `ReadonlyArray` and `readonly` to define outgoing data immutable.
In production-mode, there will be nothing that ensures immutability.

#### Get in touch

As always, we welcome feedback from the community and would love to hear what you think of this release as well as PouchDB's future direction. Please don't hesitate to [file issues](https://togithub.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues) or [get in touch](https://togithub.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#get-in-touch). And of course, a big thanks to all of our [new and existing contributors](https://togithub.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/graphs/contributors)!

If you wondering where is 7.1.0, I had a slight publishing issue so the easiest was to bump it up to 7.1.1 to do a fresh deploy.
