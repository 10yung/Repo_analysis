Hello! I tried to flash Magisk 20.3 on my Galaxy Tab 3 using twrp. It doesn't show me any errors so i rebooted system. But Magisk Manager are saying magisk is not installed and showing me notification about magisk update but there is nothing to update.
My device GT-P5200
Android 4.4.2
x86
TWRP 2.8.6.0
Don't break existing environment.
I am running MIUI V11.0.3.0.PCPINXM_20191119.0000.00_9.0_in (Android 9) on 32/3gb Redmi 8a Indian version.
And the magisk install fails. Here are the logs.

[recovery.log](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/files/4080259/recovery.log)

Realme devices has not a "ro.build.version.sdk" in build.prop 
but it is in build_default.prop, so if the normal function fails
there will be another one that will try to get the sdk version.
I'm here to report another (strange) bug, seems that all Realme devices (or most) has not a ro.build.version.sdk prop wrote in build.prop, but it is written in a secondary build.prop placed always in /system/system (they are system as root) , it is usally called "build_default.prop". The build _ default.prop contains ro.build.version.sdk. So Magisk is flashed correctly, but then can only works in core mode because it is unable to read the sdk version. I saw that a chinese guys made a .zip to fix it: https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ADsB2yYimnI2vLg&cid=AD5E6D3C1CC65865&id=AD5E6D3C1CC65865%2110827&parId=AD5E6D3C1CC65865%2110564&o=OneUp

I think it can easily fixed with a check when the sdk value is read if it is empy or the props doesn't exist in build.prop just try to read it from build_default.prop .

If are needed more infos i can give you what you need.

EDIT: 17/01/2020
Added a pull request with a fix proposal:
https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/pull/2279
Some Motorola devices (Qualcomm platform with CONFIG_MMI_DEVICE_DTBS kernel configuration enabled) need 1k of padding to the DTBs to allow for environment variables to be runtime added by the bootloader. Those extra padding will be removed during the process of dtb patch, devices wonâ€™t be able to boot-up and return to fastboot mode immediately after flashed the flawed boot.img.

To fix the problem:
1. Additional paddings need to be restored.
2. Total size in FDT header need to be updated.

Hi
When using AP magisk patched tar it makes vbmeta error with dowload screen:
ODIN MODE (AVB Fail), vbmeta: error verifying vbmeta image: OK_NOT_SIGNED, VERIFICATION_DISABLED bit is set, custom vbmeta No sign info, vbmeta .
[magisk_install_log_KEEPON.log](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/files/4071184/magisk_install_log_KEEPON.log)
[magisk_install_log_KEEPOFF.log](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/files/4071185/magisk_install_log_KEEPOFF.log)

SM-A515F with A515FXXU1ASKJ firmware Android 10 has 2 vbmeta: vbmeta.img and vbmeta_samsung.img in AP.
[vbmeta_stock_imgs.zip](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/files/4071199/vbmeta_stock_imgs.zip)

Only flashing boot.img makes bootloop.
Magisk versions tested from 19.3, 20.3 to latest canary build.

TWRP is not available. The error appears after flashing and changing vbmeta.img. Bootloader is unlocked, KG is checking. With original vbmeta magisk recovery is not accepted.

What should be done to work?


This is definitely a badly written sed pipe but I'm not sure from where it comes. It happens scarcely so I can't really reproduce but I think the output that gets pushed to /dev/null turning it to a regular text file might aid in debugging:

    # cat /dev/null

    sed: /data/.magisk: No such file or directory
    sed: /cache/.magisk: No such file or directory
    Broadcast completed: result=0

If anyone has issues with overwritten /dev/null, this is how to restore it (run as root):
```sh
mknod /dev/null c 1 3
chmod 666 /dev/null
```
