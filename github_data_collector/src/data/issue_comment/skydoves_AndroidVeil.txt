Hi there,
Would it be possible to add a way to implement veil on a layout by referencing it's view? For example: 
``` 
View mLayout = layout.getView();
veilLayout.layout = mLayout;
```
Currently, the only way to set a layout programmatically is by using layout resources, and due to some reasons I can't use it. It'd be great if you could introduce me with some way to use it with view reference. :)
I used VeilRecyclerFrameView the default is veil() but the shimmering efect need scroll bottom before showing the skeleton

` binding.veilLayoutExplore.setVeilLayout(R.layout.shimmer_tour_explore,4)
        binding.veilLayoutExplore.getVeiledRecyclerView().addItemDecoration(VerticalItemDecoration(requireContext().resources.getDimensionPixelOffset(R.dimen.divider)))
        binding.veilLayoutExplore.veil()


        binding.veilLayoutExplore.setLayoutManager(LinearLayoutManager(requireContext()))
        binding.veilLayoutExplore.getRecyclerView().addItemDecoration(VerticalItemDecoration(requireContext().resources.getDimensionPixelOffset(R.dimen.divider)))
        binding.veilLayoutExplore.setAdapter(adapter)`
