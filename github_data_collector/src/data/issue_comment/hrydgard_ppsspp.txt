On game audio, like menus selection, and on race car sounds, ambient sounds are fine, but game is missing Team Radio Audio messages on race, Circuit Audio Intro, and music on general
This PR tries to ~~address #10654 -~~ implement a highly ~~experimental~~ buggy ~~vulkan~~ MoltenVK support on modern macOS.

To test it:

1. Build MoltenVK yourself. Please follow [the official document](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK#building). `make macos` is enough.
2. Copy `MoltenVK/Package/Release/MoltenVK/macOS/dynamic/libMoltenVK.dylib` to `/usr/local/lib` or somewhere else that PPSSPP can find it.
3. Build PPSSPP with SDL mode. Qt mode is NOT supported

Tested on macOS 10.15.2 (19C57)

What happens: When you jump in the hole to transition between the first "Chase the Lizard" mission in the game, no matter which option you pick to return to the city or continue the mission, the game crashes and takes down PPSSPP as well.


What should happen: The game should send you to the next mission or back to the city streets depending on which option you choose.


Running on a P50 Toshiba laptop with an Intel HD4400 graphics chip, Windows 10 Home, PPSSPP 1.9.3 from the main site.

I have tried messing with various settings from switching to OpenGL to DirectX9 to DirectX11 and the crash keeps on happening. I have also tried turning off all the 'graphical prettiness' things like hardware transform and vertex caching with no change in this behavior.


### What happens?
Recently, whenever I go to attach decorations to an armor piece or weapon, the game crashes.
Any solutions?


I'm running an HP Pavillion 630 with 6 gigs of RAM,

AltStore (https://altstore.io) is an alternative app store for non-jailbroken iOS devices, and can distribute and resign applications onto Apple devices. This would be a great way to recieve updates for those of us who aren't jailbroken.
I've tried to fix https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/issues/10484. Some menu points are not implemented (cause I don't know how), some may be bugged, so I push it for checking.

### What happens?
This issues can be easily reproduce , play god eater burst in 2 emulator instance, take the quest one as room starter (host) and one as room participant (client).

when the group start on fenrir lobby pause the screen on host for 1 or 2 sec and unpause, Client will desync and disconnected fail to recover even wih local 1ms latency and socket still intact.

### What *should* happen?
should not pause core stepping in adhoc mode, let the UI_STATE_INGAME on pause screen, Core must keep running in all peer as the timeout in adhoc mode is really fast aprox 50ms or below in many games. one peer pause for a sec or 2 sec can break the adhoc session.

### What hardware, operating system, and PPSSPP version?  On desktop, GPU matters for graphical issues.

happen on all hardware



### Intent

To make my Android Blueooth controller's left and right hardware analog sticks *both* map to the PSP's analog stick.

See the screenshot below, where I've *added* mappings for my controller's right analog stick while leaving the original mappings for the controller's left analog stick.

### What happens?

With the config shown in the above screenshot:
* Moving the left analog stick does nothing.
* Moving the right analog stick works.

If I change the order of the mappings:
* Moving the left analog stick works.
* Moving the right analog stick does nothing.

I can consistently reproduce the same issue in all my games.

### What *should* happen?

Moving either analog stick should yield the same results, as per my mappings.

### What hardware, operating system, and PPSSPP version?  On desktop, GPU matters for graphical issues.

PPSSPP v1.9.4
Android 10 (OnePlus 6T)
XBox One Controller / Flydigi Wee2 Controller

### Additional Notes

The secondary mappings seem to override the primary ones, as suggested by the fact that changing the order reverses which analog stick is functional.

I've tried cloning and debugging PPSSPP on my machine (Linux), but I can't reproduce it there with the same controller, so it seems to be isolated to Android.

Although, I did notice that on Linux the key maps have different names than in the above screenshot: `Pad1.Size+/-` and `Pad1.Pressure+/-`. So it could indicate that the problem is specific to how `Pad1.Z.Rotation` and `Pad1.Z.Axis` are handled, rather than specific to Android.

### What happens?
Game has broken textures

### What *should* happen?
Game should have normal textures
