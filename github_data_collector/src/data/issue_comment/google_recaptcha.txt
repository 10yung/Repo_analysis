Description:

Threshold previously only exceeded criteria, now it can meet or succeed as explained on line 247
This issue is not directly related to reCaptcha as a tool, but the site.

https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ has an unclosed script, resulting in `maia.js` not loading.

Also not sure why the script has `aria-hidden="false"`, maybe a result of some bug.
Hello,
I work on an online game. We had a huge bot problem and a few months ago we got recaptcha. It seems to be doing well. We caught a lot of cheaters and they admitted to cheating. 
We are starting to have some accounts pop up that have perfect 90 scores on their recaptcha activities, but their game logs look a lot like cheating. For instance, there are two activities that take at most 3-4 seconds to complete. You do one and then have to make a few inputs and then you can complete the other. There are a few accounts that are completing both within a second. It's not possible without scripts, but their recaptcha scores are 90s. 
They aren't using a blocker either because almost all of their actions are being scored. 
Is there something they could be doing to fool recaptcha or is it just weak vs some types of bots. 
Any help would be great.
Hello,

We implemented the invisible recaptcha v2 on our website but we have sometimes an issue : the banner is not loaded (images) and the captcha is not working. 

To explain the workflow that we have : 
- the user click on a button to validate his action
- we show a popup saying that we need to validation that he is not a bot
- the user click on the button on the popup (that is link to invisible captcha)
- the user is redirected if the catcha is successfull

The issue, that we have some times, is that the following image that is showing the captcha logo is not loaded :

Here is a screenshot of the inspector with the content of the Iframe :

We can clearly see that one div is missing after the script tag (just before < / body >) that shows normally the logo. 

Then in that case, when the user tries to click on the captcha button, he is not redirected and the captcha is not working. 
In the network log, we didn't find any call that failed :

There is no error on the JS console neither.

This issue is not happening every time but sporadically.... 

Can you help please ?

This pull is a remake of the ReCaptcha package. Notable changes are:

* Namespace change.
* Simpler verification (one liner)
* Methods better reflect the response from reCAPTCHA servers.
* Removed useless classes.
* PSR-18 client compatible, HTTP/2 with cURL as suggested.
* Reworked README.
* Added UPGRADING.
* Removed unsupported PHP versions (< 7.1)
* Tests with high code coverage

You can check out the [README](https://github.com/google/recaptcha/blob/ef1d1560ec3dfa3e5890bb373cd562b89ec3ee28/README.md).


The token appears to expire after a few minutes. I execute on page load and populate a hidden form field. By the time the user submits the form the token is expired.

Can we have an API to configure the timer? Something like this.

It's very bad if ReCaptcha fails and the user can't able to submit the form.

{message='ReCaptcha V3 Verification Failed', captchaJSON={"success":"false","error-codes":["\"timeout-or-duplicate\""]}
First timer - please be gentle.

Issue description
Chrome Developer tools show "uncaught syntax error" stemming from the script copied from Google for Recaptcha V3 that runs in the head of a website, [HERE](https://southsidebbqva.com).

> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}' 

The Recaptcha script that runs (and it does seem to work) in website head, as copied from google, is 

<script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js?render=_my_recaptcha_key_"></script>
<script>
grecaptcha.ready(function() {
    grecaptcha.execute('_my_recaptcha_key_', {action: 'homepage'}).then(function(token) {
       ...
    });
});
</script>

Chrome developer tools points to the 2nd RBRACE from the bottom as "unexpected token."

Environment

OS name and version: Apache
PHP version:7.1
Web server name and version:

**Summary**: When initiated from a mobile webview, we're seeing the recaptcha image challenge getting cut off, hiding the submit button. 

This appears to be happening for some phone models and not others (e.g. we've gotten reports with an iPhone XS Max and Android phones, but the same user reported that it renders fine on an iPhone 8). Unfortunately, we have not been able to suss out the exact model/OS/browser version(s) that induces this behavior.

Possibly related to https://github.com/google/recaptcha/issues/330.
