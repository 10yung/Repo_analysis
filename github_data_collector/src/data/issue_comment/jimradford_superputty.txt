**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When implementing auto login via spsl, if it is a user name / password authentication, there is no choose but have to put the password into the spsl script, which has a security issue.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
To avoid putting sensitive information like password into the script, implementing a special command to trigger a user input dialog that prompts user to enter the password shall resolve the problem.  In addition, it is useful in scenarios that require interaction with user dynamically. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Encrypted variable

**Additional context**
nil

In the GUI tab of Tools -> Options, the "Misc" section contains a "Show Document Icons" checkbox, which is not checked by default. When checked, each **tab** (the tab control) gets an icon to the left of the tab's name.

Please clarify this preference's role, either by:

1. Moving it to the Tabs and Docking section, next to Tab Text, and renaming it something like "Show session icon"
2. ...or adding a tooltip with an explanation
Fix so the green send button sends a return on Click
Hello,

is there a config file or setting I can change to have my SuperPuTTY select files from a folder I specify by default?  currently when I import sessions from file it always defaults to the "C:\Program Files (x86)\SuperPuTTY" folder which is not where I keep my .xml files to import.

Thank you.
it seems that superputty doesn't really take into account the 'appearance' settings in a putty session, and as a result the font is huge with every putty tab i have open , unless i right click -> change settings and change it manually

this might be related to https://github.com/jimradford/superputty/issues/625

but the relevant registry keys in the registry that putty stores appearance info:

main key: `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\SESSION_NAME\`

sub keys:

`Font`
`FontCharSet`
`FontHeight`
`FontIsBold`
`FontQuality`
`FontVTMode`
`TermWidth`
`TermHeight`
`LockSize` (when window is resized setting)

these should also probably be stored in the Sessions.XML file that superputty maintains

examples:

superputty after loading the sessions from putty:

putty loading the same session itself:

I just noticed that the main keyboard shortcuts NextTab and PrevTab (which I have respectively defined to Ctrl+Next and Ctrl+PageUp) do not switch to the proper tab sometimes. Normally, just like in web browsers, if there are _n_ tabs, NextTab while on tab _t_ should bring to tab _t_+1, unless _n_=_t_, in which case it should bring to tab 1. For its part, PrevTab while on tab _t_ should bring to tab _t_-1, unless _t_=1, in which case it should bring to tab _n_.

In my current session, this is half-working and half-broken. That is, in a minority of cases, switching will bring to the wrong tab. I have 8 tabs open. If focus is in a tab between 1 and 6, NextTab cycles as if n would equal 6. That is, cycling that way excludes tabs 7 and 8, unless it's already in tab 7, in which case in goes to 8. As for PrevTab, if the focus is in tabs 6 to 8, it always stays in that set. The problem is similar to the one with NextTab.

Restarting SuperPuTTY without closing the tabs open does not solve this.

 - OS: Windows 10
 - Version 1.4.0.9

**To Reproduce**
I do not know how to reproduce from a new SuperPuTTY session, but I assume this is the result of one of the following actions which I am positive I took since SuperPuTTY was last started:
1. Reordering tabs
2. Bringing a tab to a new window and bringing it back to the initial window
Works for my colleague, but not for me.

Trying to send commands across multiple sessions concurrently. In my case script editor only sends to session tab currently displayed.

If i 'spread' my tabs across the screen like 'tiles' then it works...

Very strange.
**Describe the bug**
I have superPutty on windows 10 (1809). When I send window to the background (only minimize it ) and then bring it back I always see how SuperPutty window hang up for a 5-10 seconds. After this I usually catch KeyboardEvent.altKey state change. This hung operation programmatically changing state of the Alt key! I tried all version since 1.4.0.4 until 1.4.0.9. May it depend from anything else ? 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open SuperPutty on Windows 10.
2. Activate some other window and send supper putty to background. You need to minimize window (initiate redraw). I tried just open something above superputty and didn't catch hung ups.
3. Maximize superputty window 

**Expected behavior**
No hung ups

**Describe the bug**
Commands bar issuing commands twice to one session in a layout.

**To Reproduce**
1. Load 4 PuTTY sessions using layouts
2. Use Commands bar to issue a command
3. One PuTTY session will receive the command twice. (always the same session)

**Expected behavior**
Expecting command bar to issue a single command once to all open PuTTY sessions.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Windows 10
 - Version 1.4.0.9

When the focus is in a session, some shortcuts involving the Windows logo key are not usable. At least:
Windows logo key  + Up arrow | Maximize the window
Windows logo key  + Left arrow | Maximize the app or desktop window to the left side of the screen
Windows logo key  + Right arrow | Maximize the app or desktop window to the right side of the screen
Windows logo key  + Shift + Up arrow | Stretch the desktop window to the top and bottom of the screen
Windows logo key  + Shift + Left arrow or Right arrow | Move an app or window in the desktop from one monitor to another

These shortcuts are documented on https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open a session
2. Ensure the window is smaller than the whole screen
3. While pressing the Windows logo key, press the Up arrow
4. Notice SuperPuTTY's window size is unchanged.

**Expected behavior**
The window should enlarge to fill the screen.
