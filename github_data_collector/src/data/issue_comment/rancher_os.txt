Proxmox VE KVM

After defining a KVM in Proxmox VE I boot this VM with _rancheros-proxmoxve-autoformat.iso_.

Then I want to run installation
`ros install -d /dev/sda -c cloud-config.yml`
but this fails with error.
Please check this screenshot for details.

A workaround to solve this issue is this:
- reboot the VM and boot from _rancheros-proxmoxve-autoformat.iso_
- execute `ros install -d /dev/sda -c cloud-config.yml`

This means that only the initial `ros install` fails with this iso.

Can you please provide a fix for this?

I have a USB stick that I want to set up udev rules for. I have created the following file:

```
# /var/lib/rancher/conf/cloud-config.d/udev_config.yml
write_files:
- path: /etc/udev/rules.d/99-z-wave-stick.rules
  container: udev
  permissions: "0644"
  owner: root
  content: |
    SUBSYSTEM=="tty", GROUP="dialout", ATTRS{interface}=="HubZ Z-Wave Com Port", SYMLINK+="zwave"
    SUBSYSTEM=="tty", GROUP="dialout", ATTRS{interface}=="HubZ ZigBee Com Port", SYMLINK+="zigbee"
```

The rules are in the udev system container, but they're not being applied. I have to manually run `system-docker exec -it udev udevadm trigger` after every reboot. 

What I have tried (no success):

```
runcmd:
- system-docker exec -it udev udevadm trigger
```

```
write_files:
- path: /etc/rc.local
  permissions: "0755"
  owner: root
  content: |
    #!/bin/bash
    wait-for-docker
    system-docker exec -it udev udevadm trigger
```
I have also tried `ros udev-settle` but I can't find any documentation on it, so I'm not sure how to use it or if it applies to this case.

Any ideas?

Baremetal

The [air-gap](https://rancher.com/docs/os/v1.x/en/installation/configuration/airgap-configuration/#configuring-private-docker-registry) installation page should document how to configure the private registry for cloud-config mode

As explained by [janeczku](https://gist.github.com/janeczku/02302dae3fbfa011f4f7a60df2b5f24e), I have set:

```yaml
rancher:
  # some stuff here...
  # Configure private registry
  bootstrap_docker:
    registry_mirror: "https://private-mirror.internal"
  docker:
    registry_mirror: "https://private-mirror.internal"
  system_docker:
     registry_mirror: "https://private-mirror.internal"
```
Hi

In my custom service, I can specify a network I created from Portainer using net: name123.
But how do I create this bridge network from the config files?

I tried adding:

```
  networks:
    name123:
      driver: bridge
```

To the config.yml, but it's ignored.
I also tried adding this to a custom service yml, but I getting a parse error:

```
grafana:
  container_name: grafana
  image: grafana/grafana
  net: name123
networks:
  name123:
    driver: bridge
```

User would like the ability to send RancherOS logs via syslog to a TLS protected endpoint, with the ability to specify their own CA for the endpoint also.

ALL

Install to disk:
```
ros install -d /dev/vda --append "cc.something=yes -- cc.hostname=nope rancher.password=rancher"
```

I can still get all kernel params after checking the `/proc/cmdline`.

Previously, we implemented this function by appending "`\0`" after "`--`", "`\0`" can terminate a string.
Please refer to 
1. https://github.com/rancher/os-kernel/pull/48
2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1296843/what-is-the-difference-between-null-0-and-0

I will roll back the kernel version before finding the root cause.


The documentation explains how to run custom services from a public repository. But how do I run services from a private BitBucket? Where do I add authentication? 



Before the last Rancher Upgrade I run: "docker system prune" to remove all old volumes etc on the RancherOS node. This corrupted the whole RancherOS installation. After next reboot the User Docker Container did not start anymore and gave ntp errors: 

vmserancher ntpd[1]: kernel reports TIME_ERROR: 0x2041: Clock Unsynchronized

This should be prevented from RancherOS to not allow "docker system prune" on that system!

VMware ESX(i)

Depending Documentation: https://rancher.com/docs/os/v1.x/en/installation/running-rancheros/cloud/vmware-esxi/#vmware-guest-info

1) Can anyone give me an example how "_cloud-init.config.data_" the correct way?
- I try to insert raw yaml file => not working
- I try to insert base64 encoded yaml and set "_cloud-init.data.encoding_" to "_base64_" => not working

2) Is the option "_cloud-init.data.encoding_" always required or only if i use "_cloud-init.config.url_" ?

3) If i want to use "cloud-init.config.url" with in internal dns name, it's not possbile, because the dns servers from "Guest Info" defintion "dns.server.<x>" are not assigned to the network interface (at this point)
