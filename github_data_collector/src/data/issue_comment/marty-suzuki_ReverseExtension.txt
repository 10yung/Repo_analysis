Minimal modifications to support Swift 4.2 in File ReverseExtension.swift



When can we expect an update for swift 4.2? Do you need any help with this?

Hello @marty-suzuki I made some changes to the ReverseExtension.swift so that it would be compatible with Swift 4.2. They're some minor changes if you wanted to add them to your repository. But no pressure. Great extension, I appreciate it ;)
