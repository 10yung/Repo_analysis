The `import` of `eng_notation` was removed from `flow_graph.py.mako` in 678a7c2ad, and so float parameter blocks were leading to flowgraph compilation error.

Since `eng_notation` is still ultimately imported in the generated python script, we can put the call to `num_to_str` in the generated script, instead of calling it during script generation.

The second commit of this PR simply removes a definition that seems to be unused and which also contains a call to `eng_notation.num_to_str`.
- Fixes up cmake for `gr-filters/examples` to install a few files that were missing

- Renames `channelizer_demo.grc` to be `polyphase_channelizer_demo.grc`

Minor tweaks to `polyphase_channelizer_demo.grc`:
- Sets QT layout for Freq sinks
- Adds `Noise Source` and `Throttle Block`
- Adds Labels to each of the Freq sinks
- Disables Autoscaling on the Ch2 Freq sink block

hdlc_deframer should copy the tags from its input stream into the tags portion of the PDU it sends as output.

The metadata in the tags on the input stream may contain important information that is needed for later processing,
Hi, 
This bug affect GRC 3.9 (not tested for GRC 3.8)
When a block was disabled in older GRC, this block and its connections were greyed. 
At present the block is completely removed (we need ctrl Z to revert deletion)
Is this a bug ? 

Regards, Christophe
Hi 
As explained in the mailing list , I propose aQTGUI eye_sink GRC block. this PR comprise a GRC example to see it in action. 
I hope this can be included in GNURadio (at present, I was not able to construct this eye_sink as an OOT module)

Regards, Christophe 
Ready for comments, as maybe it is a mistake somehow (the first commit)

Hi, 

Currently, the windows precompiled GNUradio installers found [here ](http://www.gcndevelopment.com/gnuradio/downloads.htm)feature GNURadio 3.8, but only with Python 2.7. My questions are:

1) Is there a currently precompiled Windows version of GNURadio 3.8 w/ Python 3?
2) If there is not, is there a relatively easy way that I could compile one myself?
3) If also not, how could I interface my current Python 3 codebase w/ the GNURadio Python 2 output?

Thanks!
