**Platform**: Android

**Build**: 102.3

**Issue**: I was trying out mods for the first time (starting about a week ago) using Modustry Modpack by ZoMadeStuff which is fun and generally worked great. Eventually I ran into an issue where when I would discover a new material/item that was not launchable in the core, it failed to register that I had discovered the material; this meant that it didn't show up in the item list, but more importantly, it meant that the item can't be sorted or emptied.

**Steps to reproduce**: This first occurred on the Evosaki Islands map, after I built a deep digger, which produced the the problem with raw ore, and other items. This non-recognition problem was repeated with gold powder and the various oil bottles (non-launchable raw reverie crystals were recognized, as was the launchable pure gold and plastic discovered later). This was repeated on different maps (the craters and goldsand valley), after un- and. re-installed the mod, and with the oil barrels using only What42Pizza's Production mod. It can be noted that in custom game mode the unrecognized items are part of the full complement of items and can be properly sorted, this issue only seems to occur in campaign mode.
**Platform**: Linux (with wayland)

**Build**: 102

**Issue**:
```

See https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/72306#pullrequestreview-340915299 for more info

**Steps to reproduce**:
* Have wayland
* Run Mindustry

not foolproof
will not show for existing blocks (idk how)
[See video of it!](https://streamable.com/hqn5xl)
just a note for mods without color in their displayNames, default is [accent] as to differentiate between item name and mod name
Conduits and conveyors identify the content and show up the color.
the orange "cells" on batteries now change from black to orange depending on their buffered power (power stored).
I was originally using `power/maxPower` but anuke told me to use `power.status` which is a float that contains the current amount of power given compared to the required.

now lights have two sprites, `battery.png`, which is the base, where the cells are the standard mindustry dark dark grey, and `battery-lights.png` which is a white outline of the cells, for the alpha shader.

this took so long because of git and conflicting files problems :/

edit: pics :)

in the preview the batteries seem pretty dark, i don't know whether or not it is github preview shading weirdly or the sprite packer compressing it, but here are the sprites when i inserted them

It is complete right now, please merge :)
The changelogs are being worked, but the big features are translated
I didn't update all these yet, but edited some. I have to sleep now.(yawn)
