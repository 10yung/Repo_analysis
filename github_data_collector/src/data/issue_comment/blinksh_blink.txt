Some Alt+[special character] combinations sends the wrong key. For example:

* `Alt+!` sends `ESC 1` instead of `ESC !`.
* `Alt+?` sends `ESC /` instead of `ESC ?`.
* `Alt+)` sends `ESC 0` instead of `ESC )`.
* etc.
When connected to a host, it would be nice to have a password button that can paste the password for the current host.

Paste must be authenticated by TouchID/FaceID/Pin to prevent accidental/malicious paste of password.
Enhancement Request

Provide a way to disable the displaying of the autocomplete text

For example, at the blink> prompt, start typing the letters ping and the display shows: ping - Send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts. (with the non-typed portion being in a different color and disregarded by the system, of course)

I am rather ‘old school’ and I find stuff like this to be very distracting; I know what I want to type and what I expect to see as I type - having other letters displayed definitely has an impact on my speed and accuracy.

I appreciate the feature, and can see its uses. However, for an ‘old-school’ VI programmer with so much eye/muscle memory, it ends up being a huge distraction and hinderance.
When editing an existing host the title (still/always) is "New Host". Rather confusing.

Maybe you can show the value for _Host_ or _HostName_ instead?
On my iPad `ssh` immediately returned to the prompt for any host I tried, without any info.

After running `ssh -vvvvv` instead I discovered from the logging that Blink could not read my private key. Apparently I had renamed it in the _Keys_ settings, but not in the _Hosts_ settings.

Please show an error in the GUI when a private key cannot be read when executing `ssh`.

Additionally you might want to change the appearance of Key names in the host section: display it in red if it cannot be found? (Now it showed a no longer existing name in the same font/color as a valid key; only when I tapped on it I saw that it was actually set to _None_)
If you enable the Shift key in the software keyboard, then an iOS low battery warning triggers, the "Shift key stuck" screen will show up, even if no hardware keyboard is connected.

To reproduce:

1. Press the shift key on the software keyboard so that it is enabled.
2. Wait for an iOS low battery warning (e.g. 20% or 10% battery remaining)
3. Close the warning. The "shift key stuck" screen will show up.
On the iPhone 11 I can change the font setting oder theme setting, but the app does not adapt, even after force quitting.
Anyone have a setup that works for this? I’ve been trying for a bit can’t I can’t get it to work, or for blink to give me any error messages.
Blink: v13.1.196. Dec 30 2019

Is my version

I’m running iOS 13.3

Sorry if this has been fixed I. Source already I can only use the AppStore release since I lack the hardware/software to build it myself. 
It seems to me that the last few TF versions have seen a regression in the way mosh works. In the past, closing the ipad for a while and then resuming had no issues with reestablishing a mosh session. Now, it's frequently the case that when the ipad is reopened after a delay (5-10 mins), the mosh client cannot reestablish its connection (bar on top saying "last contact X seconds ago"), requiring me to ssh into the server, do a `killall mosh-server`, and then reestablish a mosh connection (tmux is what's saving me here).

Currently on TF13.2(200).
