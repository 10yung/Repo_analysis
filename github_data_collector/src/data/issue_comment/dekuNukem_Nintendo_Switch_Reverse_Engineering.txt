Sorry for offtop. Is it exists datasheet for LRA thar used for rumble in switch?

Do you have the schematics of the right joycon pinout i need to make a bridge for the r button
You have the data (images) listed for the Joycons but not the pro controller.
Hello! I have a weird way of trying to add controllers to my arcade fighting stick but I seem to have run into a new situation with trying to convert the signal from the joy stick into a way signal output. I've done it before with Xbox 360 but the Switch's joy stick is new to me. Any ideas would be appreciated. 
Iam currently working on a small project DIY controller and I would like to add the switches iconic small factor joystick so I ordered some from china, sadly it would take a lot of time(month) till they come and iam already working on the model, so can some great soul take me those measurements?

I'm trying to use BTstack on ESP32 to read basic data (buttons, joystick, and IMU) from a Joy-Con controller. BTstack has limited support for HID host applications, but the HID documentation here is great, so I've been trying to implement what I think is correct protocol. I am able to connect a Joy-Con to the ESP32 as an HID device by using the existing ["hid_host_demo"](https://github.com/bluekitchen/btstack/blob/master/example/hid_host_demo.c) from BTstack. I can send any output report I want - LEDs change accordingly so I know output reports work. 

However, the only input reports I ever receive are the "3F" standard input reports that contain button and joystick hat data. If I change the reporting mode using a subcommand, or change the name of the ESP32 to "Nintendo Switch" so the Joy-Con uses full reporting mode by default, no data comes in on the ESP32, not even in response to output reports. As far as I can tell, the ESP32 isn't receiving data (aside from 3F reports) on the HCI or L2CAP layers when it definitely should be. Is it possible that there is some incompatibility in BTstack that prevents it from receiving specific reports from a Joy-Con? Perhaps more L2CAP channels need to be opened somehow (there's only one for control and one for interrupt currently)?

I can post code if needed but the only modifications I've made to ["hid_host_demo"](https://github.com/bluekitchen/btstack/blob/master/example/hid_host_demo.c) are for output reports which don't seem to have any issue.
I want to add a led to each joycon but I don't know where to connect them...
I know you can connect them to the HD rumble but I want the leds to stay on while the joycon is on and turn off when the joycons are off. 
I will appreciate it if someone could help me with that 
Thanks in advance

EDIT: I think I got it... I just need to find Jc3 on the other joycon... 
ive got a spare wired switch controller, what would i need in order to make the wired controller 
also how
