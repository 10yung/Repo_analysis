There is no mentioned format of DOB like DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY. People do not follow the same conventions everywhere and get **confused**. The date 10/10/1990 is confusing because there are 10 _days_ as well as _months_.

There is no possible way of logging out of the 3D Body Visualiser app. Even after pressing the Logout button(I even logged out of my gmail account from the chrome browser), you can still access your measurements and add or delete them.

The shadow produced on the right side of the 3D graphic is too dark for that side to be even seen. Removing the shadow or reducing its darkness would be much better.

Many measurements require some infographics which can help the user to visualise the measurement taking process.

The websiteâ€™s current interface is not so user friendly, and intuitive so that users can find it easier to get along the website. A Responsive User Interface which increases the interaction between user and the website is needed.

@Vishv19 Removed the navigation bar from the log in page . Please review it .


Edit option in the 'measurement list' page should redirect user to edit-view for changing options like name, measurement unit, etc.
