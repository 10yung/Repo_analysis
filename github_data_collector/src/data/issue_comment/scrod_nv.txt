since the last release has been in 2011, maybe it is time to put a notice on the homepage blessing an official successor app, e.g. nvALT?
Simplenote syn—Å inoperative
Perhaps owing to domain name change from https://simple-note.appspot.com to https://app.simplenote.com
Hi,

Notational Velocity is a wonderful editor and I have loved using it in my past jobs! At my current company, there's a requirement that open-source software used needs a clear EULA (End User License Agreement) and I was wondering if you can add one to the repo and/or the hosting site for clarification? See the motivation for such a license here: https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/2865/does-open-source-software-need-an-eula-to-protect-the-developer

thanks!
Sync works fine, but every time I close the app and reopen it, sync has been unchecked and settings wiped. Is there a setting to make it persistent? Could this be a Mojave issue?
A few months ago I downloaded the new nv application, and just now I wanted to back my files up to dropbox like I did with the last version of the app. So I set the folder I had been using for the old app as my new read/write location, and suddenly all my notes were gone, replaced by my notes from the older version of the app. Is there any way to restore/recover my notes? 

There are two files in the dropbox that have been recently modified: Interim Note Changes and Notes & Settings, but I'm not sure if they are from the old app or the new one. How can I load them up and check? Please help!
Today, with the account I've been using forever, notational velocity starts reporting

"Changes could not be uploaded.
not found"

Checking preferences, the account information appears correct, but there is a little red indicator to the right of the user name field and the words "not found" appear below it.

I've logged in successfully at the simplenote.com site with those credentials.

Any ideas?
Hello, 
So I went to do a clean install of OSX 10.9 mavericks on my computer and didn't realize my notation velocity notes were deleted in the process (3 years worth). 
I am now trawling through the disk with PhotoRec for plist files trying to find it.  Any tips or hints on how to identify the notes file?  I have had a few files that looked promising but would never open when I renamed them and pointed NV to them. 

Two files attached are what I have been looking at for reference, that are what was stored on an old backup.
[Notes & Settings ahmad.txt](https://github.com/scrod/nv/files/2254858/Notes.Settings.ahmad.txt)
[Notes & Settings.txt](https://github.com/scrod/nv/files/2254859/Notes.Settings.txt)

Two files appear to be the right format but give the error "data could not be serialized" when NV tries to use them.
[f77017936 copy dir20.txt](https://github.com/scrod/nv/files/2254843/f77017936.copy.dir20.txt)
[f122206208 copy hoping.txt](https://github.com/scrod/nv/files/2254844/f122206208.copy.hoping.txt)

Tips for what to look for or how to modify the files found to open them?

Much appreciated, 
Nicholas

PS:
(great to see that simple note syncing is up and running! I will use that in the future! (dropbox didn't really work for me when I tried to set that up in the past))

I want to make the NV window to po-up at **current** workspace, while now it always opens in Desktop screen or wherever i move it.
When i rightclick it in dock, the menu pops-up the content of **Options** submenu is as follows:
- Keep in Dock
- Open at Login
- Show in Finder
So, no option to define this kind of behavior (
I have my notes synchronized with Simplenote and checks for changes every 5 minutes, and lately, Notational Velocity has been deleting newly-created notes WHILE I AM WRITING THEM. This has happened repeatedly in recent weeks. I am using version 2.0 beta 5 (how did I get on a beta track?!)
It seems that this app is having major issues with High Sierra. I could live with the error dialog, but today I find that it has cleared the contents on around 200 notes (thankfully only a small portion of total). I had to manually recover the contents via simplenote's web client.

This is very discouraging from an app I used to trust with a lot of important data. Needless to say that now I store notes in git.
