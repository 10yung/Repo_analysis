Already updated cocoapods, carthage manager, and podfile and BEMCheckBox dependencies, has anyone faced this before?

Updates project and fixes iOS 12 animation issue
Hello @Boris-Em,

I'm the maintainer of the [XPlugins.iOS.BEMCheckBox](https://github.com/saturdaymp/XPlugins.iOS.BEMCheckBox) wrapper for the BEMCheckBox.  I would like to do another release that includes the fixes since your last release which is version [1.4.1](https://github.com/Boris-Em/BEMCheckBox/releases/tag/1.4.1) on May 16th, 2017.  Do you have any plans on creating another official release?  Is there anything I can help you with to create the next release?

Thank you and all the best.

Any chance OSX support will be added in the future?

I load these checkBox on collectionView. How Can I select the lastOne and the Others turn Off.
just the last checkBox still on.
thanks!
I am having a collectionView with images and a checkBox on the topLeft corner and I want to record tap event for the checkBox so that I can save the state of the cell to overCome scrolling problem for collectionView.. If the checkBox is in normal View I can conform to the protocol and implement didTap(_ checkBox: BEMCheckBox) to handle and listen to touchEvents but what if the checkBox is placed in a collectionViewCell. All I want to know is, can I create a action method or implement a function and add it as target to the reference of BEMCheckbox like below??
`stateCheckBox.addTarget(self, action: #selector(checkBoxTapped(_:)), for: .touchUpInside)`
Hello!
Not a critical misprint, but the analyzer gives an warning.
