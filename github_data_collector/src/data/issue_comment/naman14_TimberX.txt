There aren't any open-source music player apps that both look great and support *sonic.
Hello
I tested TimberX from your publish on Google Play and also by self produced git, on both I noticed a blank white screen when launching the app for the first time. In order to get passed that I had to close the app and reopen it.
This issue is very critic because when people download and app and it won't run on the first launch, they won't try again, they'll just delete it

Version: latest
Device: Galaxy S8, Android Studio Emulator (Pixel 3)
## Changes
---
Add tests for SearchViewModel and perform cleanup with things connected to it. 
As we all know adding tests is a good practice and helps us build better software.
hi
i cloned latest version of TimberX
build release APK without any changes.
trying to installed on any devices and get "Application not installed" error.

but if installed debug version.it's ok

so what happening here?
I noticed you guys have a reference to a Context inside the MainViewModel. I thought viewmodels were not supposed to reference a view, Lifecycle, or any class that may hold a reference to the activity context. Am I missing something here?
What is the licence for this project?
Fixing the gradle build error with the latest android studio (3.3.0).
I was getting error `API 'variant.getExternalNativeBuildTasks()' is obsolete` during building the project. Fix referenced from https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/issues/198
### Overview
Added GestureDetector in `NowPlayingFragment.kt`. 
Added action for Left/Right fling detection and when the velocity is greater than absolute value of 800, a next/previous action for song playing occurs.

- [x] Ran SpotlessApply task

I will make a Pull Request for this.
**Description what you'd like to happen:**

While a song is playing, swipe left on the playing screen will change to previous song and swiping right will play the next song.

Gesture detection can help in implementing this.


I use Omnirom, and this may be related to the theming it uses, but in the app the bottom nav bar just turns solid black, and the buttons aren't visible anymore.
