My dataset images are height:128 width:64. when I set config.preprocessing.squre_size is 256,and caffenet prototxt crop size:227. It will call "Check failed: datum height is >= crop size", what can I do to adjust my image crop size?
I am trying to compile the Caffe submodule version but it gives the above mentioned error when building with cmake.

I am using CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 5.1.5

Does this Caffe submodule version support cuDNN 5.1.5?

Thanks in advance !!
When using gen_images.m on my own dataset, there is an matlab error named :out of memory...Did anyone meet this problem? And what can I do to solve the problem?
