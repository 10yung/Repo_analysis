We would like to send messages that come into our page's messenger inbox to our slack. Would it be hard to support this? Zapier also supports this, but we'd have to pay â‚¬50/month for it, which is a bit much for the few messages we recieve trough facebook.
This is an initial attempt at getting notifications from our backend into the system, which we plan to expand with additional events and actions over time.
This could probably be more generally expanded, but Sheets integration was the requested functionality (as requested in #258).
As mentioned in #258, an IMAP hive for processing emails would be great to have.
Should we add Beehive to https://awesome-go.com? It's already quite popular but adding it there could make it even more visible?

@muesli: I assume that Beehive's creator would be the best person to open a PR there.

I wanted to fiddle with facebook bee and before I could even try it out I got an error.
It's related to the deprecated post API.

I am in no hurry to fix anything and this doesn't impact me, but it would be nice for it to work.

It doesn't appear to be possible to reverse-proxy Beehive to be served from a subdirectory.

Beehive seems to be absolutely adamant that it's going to request assets from `/assets/example.txt` instead of `/beehive/assets/example.txt` - despite me using `-canonicalurl`.

I've tried both `-canonicalurl http://example.com/beehive/` and `-canonicalurl http://[::1]:3070/beehive/` - and neither have had any effect.

I'm reverse-proxying with nginx:

```nginx
location /beehive {
    proxy_pass http://[::1]:3070;
}
```

Full command line for Beehive: `/srv/beehive/beehive -bind [::1]:3070 -config /srv/beehive/beehive.conf -canonicalurl http://subdomain.example.com/beehive/`

This appears to be related to #250.
Actions in beehive.conf are referenced by ID, which makes sense given that they don't really have a "pretty name" associated with them.  Bees, however, do have "pretty names", so they are referenced by said names.

I have a pretty extensive list of Bees (and this is going to sound so "first-world-problem"), and I'd like to refactor how I've named them.  Since they are referenced by name in the config, refactoring Bee naming involves changing every location where the old name is used (and given shell commands that's not entirely difficult, just error prone and tedious).

Example:
Bee:
```
    {
      "Name": "RSS_Hack-A-Day",
      "Class": "rssbee",
      "Description": "Hack-A-Day RSS",
      "Options": [
        {
          "Name": "url",
          "Value": "https://hackaday.com/blog/feed/"
        },
        {
          "Name": "skip_first",
          "Value": "1"
        }
      ]
    },
```

Associated Chain:
```
    {
      "Name": "RSS_Hack-a-day2Discord",
      "Description": "Hack-a-day 2 discord",
      "Event": {
        "Bee": "RSS_Hack-A-Day",  <~~~ referenced by name
        "Name": "new_item",
        "Options": null
      },
      "Filters": [],
      "Actions": [
        "5aecd53c-08ee-4b1c-4d99-0c90b95d1982"
      ]
    },
```

More just thinking out loud than a serious "bug report" (request for an enhancement?), but I thought I'd bring it up and see what you think.
It would be nice to have a throttling mechanism in order to be able to chain a high volume rss feed to Twitter, making sure that there is only one random tweet sent per hour. Otherwise one could get blocked quite fast.

Or does such a mechanism exist and i am just blind? :)
