I'm guessing older versions of OS X stored newlines the same way as DOS. (Shows up as ^M in text editors in Linux, and on Github. These should be converted to newlines (as in "\n").
Locked versions are kept for preservation sake.

This fixes a rather nasty crash on startup.

Unfortunately the github diff viewer doesn't work because of the Mac line endings. I suggest pulling https://github.com/softdorothy/glider_pro/pull/3 to fix this issue.

This doesn't really matter since one can still use Glider Edit to unlock them, but it seems a little against the spirit of open source that you can't initially open them in the game's own editor. :/

This makes development on modern computers much easier — though obviously might cause issues for those who want to compile for legacy OS.

The checked-in house files are missing the resource forks which contain PICT assets.  In my copy of Glider Pro, Slumberland has a 131KiB data fork and a 1016KiB resource fork.  Only the data fork appears to be checked in.

Also, the quicktime movies are missing the resource forks which contain the moov atom.  Quicktime supports storing the resource in a separate .qtr file, or flattening the files to a single stream.
