Hello everyone.

I corrected in Natron an exr (multichannel) file. 
When I render it, the image is different from the render view. I tried to change the output colorspace in linear, srgb, and several others, but still is not like it should be.

Also, sometimes, some pieces of the image are not rendered, with annoying stripes on it.

Does anyone have suggestions?

Here the render view:

And here the output image:

Can't be connected to on port 80.
I am beginner with natron. I have issue with error like this
Error while creating node fr.inria.built-in.Write: No plugin capable of encoding mp4 was found.

Natron 2.3.14
OS: manjaro 4.14

How I can fix this issue

https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron is the official repository for the community-maintained version of Natron and all of its plugins.
### Problem

**Expected behavior:** Overwriting an already written output file with any **smaller** project output (reformated) size will result in a smaller data footprint of that written file over the already written file.

**Actual behavior:** When writing over a pre-existing file to a smaller size the data footprint remains the same, which implies the overwritten file has trailing data from the previous write. A file of size 1024 (square) with filesize of 3.5mb when resized to 256(square) will retain the same file size of 3.5mb. When saving separately as a new file (new name) the data footprint changes to a smaller size.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. New Project, set size to 1024x1024
2. Place solid image
3. Place Radial
4. Render as EXR at size 1024x1024
5. Notice Filesize of output file
6. Open Project settings, resize to 256x256
7. Insert reformat before Write node
8. Reformat to size 256x256
9. Render again at size 256x256
10. Notice that filesize is the same
11. Click write node and save as separate file (new name)
12. Notice that new file has smaller data footprint
