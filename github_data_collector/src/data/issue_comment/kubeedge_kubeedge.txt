**What this PR does / why we need it**:
What Changed?

- Previously, during keadm init keadm checks whether Kubernetes and Docker is installed or not. If not installed, it installs them.
- Now, keadm only checks if Kubernetes is installed or not. If not, throws an error and request user to install Kubernetes.
- Commented code for
 - Check and installation of Docker.
 - Installation of Kubernetes, instead display a error message.

Why this change was made?

- Issue 1117
- Container-Runtime and K8S should not be in the management scope of keadm #1117

Fixes #1408 

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
i add a channel between handler and edgecontroller. if edgecontroller watch a node deleted, it will push the node name to the channel. when handler get the name, it will use the function cancelnode() the delete the node channel from channelPool. 
im considering about the scheme if a mutex is necessary. we can discuss about it.

**What happened**:
I delete a node from k8s and shutdown the edgecore. then i create the same node and restart edgecore in a short time. the cloudcore can possiblely meet an error and exit. this a serious problem.
i cannot upload the picture about the bug due to my work environment so i have to upload the log file.

**What you expected to happen**:
it is expected that the node connects successfully when the edgecore is restarted and nothing stopped.
**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:
kubectl delete node nodename
kill edgecore
kubectl create node nodename
start edgecore
that is all my operations
**Anything else we need to know?**:
here is the log :
