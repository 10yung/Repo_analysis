How do we specify which subnet to use in each region ?

(subnet names have been substituted)

bees up -s 4 -g bees \
    --key=$KEY \
    --i=ami-2a,ami-1a \
    --zone=ap-southeast-2a,ap-southeast-1a \
    --login=ec2-user \
    --subnet=subnet-2a,subnet-1a \
    --group=SG_Groups_Tag_Name_In_Both_Regions (I assume this works since it resolves the SG ID)

The subnet ID 'subnet-2a,subnet-1a' does not exist"
Hi,

I am running the following command:
./bees up -s 2 -g bees -k bees -z eu-west-1b -i ami-8b8f59f2

And get this error:

Any help would very much be appreciated.

I just wanted to reach out and say your project inspired me to write "Wasps with Bazookas" if you could not tell by the name. The reason I went this direction instead of contributing to this one is due to the bees not being fast enough to get true results. 

For example, testing a HelloWorld node server.

## Bees Test (4 bees)

* 2 node servers running on kurbintes EKS: **27,773.79 rps**
* 4 node servers running on kurbintes EKS: **30,180.97 rps**
* 8 node servers running on kurbintes EKS: **25,466.54 rps**

## Bees Test (16 bees)

* 2 node servers running on kurbintes EKS: **24,536 rps**
* 4 node servers running on kurbintes EKS: **33,851.46 rps**
* 8 node servers running on kurbintes EKS: **60,867.42 rps**

## Wasps Test (1 Wasp)

* 2 node servers running on kurbintes EKS: **69,361.46 rps**
* 4 node servers running on kurbintes EKS: **128,415.59 rps**
* 8 node servers running on kurbintes EKS: **276,365.73 rps**


It also seems this project is no longer being worked on. If you wanted to update the readme to put a link to Wasps With Bazookas for a replacement I think that would help a lot of people out.

Hi,

I am getting below error when I am trying to pip install beeswithmachinesguns. I am unable to figure out this runtime auto conf error related to pycrypto. Can someone please assist ?

It's really cool that you can specify a file to use with post requests from the command line! However, currently, one can only specify the `-p, --post_file` param using a bare filename (no path) which must exist in the same directory in which you are running `bees` (due to the `scp` command which assumes that the destination of the file on the bee file system is `~/%(post_file)s`). It would be more ergonomic to be able to specify a relative or absolute path to a file, and have that file read and sent to the bee swarm.

I think the line which needs to be changed is the one which tells `ab` where to find the file: https://github.com/newsapps/beeswithmachineguns/blob/4b8783dc36d327ad95b711db39054d64bd718344/beeswithmachineguns/bees.py#L447
Working a way to automate load testing on instances by creating an AMI with the bees installed.  I created a new user in my AWS account for a `bees` user to prevent too-permissive access to resources (I'd rather not use mine).  I have enabled `AmazonEC2FullAccess`, `AutoScalingFullAccess`, and some basic CloudWatch policies, but still am receiving a `You are not authorized to perform this operation.`

What are the minimal amount of permissions required to start a swarm?

https://github.com/newsapps/beeswithmachineguns/blob/4b8783dc36d327ad95b711db39054d64bd718344/beeswithmachineguns/main.py#L105

The nargs option is 0, so my assumption is the argument will never have a value and so will never pass "-k" option to Apache Bench.

I tried:
"bees attack -K True"
"bees attack --keepalive=True"
"bees attack -K KEEP_ALIVE"
"bees attack --keepalive=KEEP_ALIVE"
"bees attack -K"
"bees attack --keepalive"

None of them added -k to Apache Bench
I have built a Docker container using Ubuntu and am seeing the following error when I direct my bees to attack.

I have tried this on my Mac, Centos, and Ubuntu. I have used several versions of Python - from 2.7.10 to 3.6.5 an each has given the same error.
