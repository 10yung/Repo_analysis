This is more of a question with a potential follow-up suggestion: in the genre column, we do have `drama/thriller` and `thriller/drama`

Is there a valid reason behind this? If not, I would suggest making it more consistent (eg: pick one between the two and use it consistently across the list), so that sorting it properly groups them.

Also: since we do have categories already, why the column at all? It seems redundant to me, I would maybe instead replace that with a different rating source maybe (rotten tomatoes?)
