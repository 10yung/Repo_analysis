*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Hi! Your repo is referring to the undocumented `AZP_CACHING_TAR` env var.  We're rolling out TARing as default with agent 160.  If this is what you want, you can just remove this env var.  If you want to specifically not use TARing, then set `AZP_CACHING_CONTENT_FORMAT` to `Files`.  We'll be documenting this new environment variable.

Currently, the CORES payload contains the originating Node's public key, so that the exit Node can use it to encrypt the response.

This means that the exit Node knows the originating Node's public key, which is more information than it should have.

Modify the code so that payloads coming from Nodes that are not direct neighbors of the originating Node are encrypted with an alias public key, rather than the public key the originating Node uses as its identity on the network.
Network Settings does not save Gas Price changes unless you start the node for each blockchain network. Gas price cannot be changed for the non-active blockchain network while node is Serving or Consuming.

Linux builds on Jenkins frequently fail on main_spec tests due to timeout waiting for SubstratumNode to start. Either the verify needs to wait longer or the verification mechanism is faulty.
Nodes should advertise whether or not they are able to fulfill blockchain service requests via clandestine traffic or not in their Gossip NodeRecords.
A boolean value will suffice; we may not want to distribute a nodes actual blockchain service URL, and may not even be able to if that URL does not point to a public IP address on the Internet.
Establish a process for someone with no write access to the SubstratumNetwork organization to submit a pull request, watch it go through Azure Pipelines, and retrieve the results from GitHub Pages. Also establish a process for someone who does have write access in the SubstratumNetwork organization to review/reject/accept the pull request, and merge it into master once it's acceptable.

Make sure the process is documented.
