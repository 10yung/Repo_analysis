If `TickerView.setText()` is called with `animate=false` and an existing animation is still in progress, the previous animation should be cancelled before setting the new text.
Thanks for this amazing library.

This is potentially a feature request for adding two new scrolling direction modes:
`AUTO_ASC` and `AUTO_DESC` They are all based on if the newer text is greater or less than the current one.

For `AUTO_ASC` mode, ideally it would work like this:
if the original text is number of `1234` and the new one is `1243`, since the value of new text is greater than the old text, it would scrolling down

Similarly for `AUTO_DESC` mode, it would scroll up.

Would this feature be nice to have or we already have something similar?

I mainly use the `setTypeface()` method as was pointed out in a previous closed issue. With downloadable fonts getting great support, it would be great if we can add a font attribute to `TickerView`. 

Something like : `android:fontFamily="@font/lato`

It would probably mean that there would be a dependency on the support library but that could be fine since almost all developers use the support library anyway. 

Would be happy to take a stab at it!

Attached is a problematic screen with random squares on Samsung Galaxy S9. 
This problem only happens on Samsung devices. 
`TextView`s are often baseline-aligned to other views. `TickerView` should also support `layout_alignBaseline` and other similar layout attributes.
Hi! When I use shadow, the characters are clipped in width (pre lollipop), how I fix this?

Thanks for library!
can add a shape or image background for each character ?
Can you add RTL language support ?
