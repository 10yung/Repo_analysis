I just create new UIView inside UITableviewcell and make the class as "ISTimeline".
Did the necessary steps. but getting outing like empty gray bg view.

How can I resolve this? Did anyone face this same issue?
Hello.
Today I've updated to xCode 10.2 and Swift 5. Now I get the following build error:

```
Build Failed
  Task failed with exit code 65:
  /usr/bin/xcrun xcodebuild -project /Development/ios-v2/Carthage/Checkouts/ISTimeline/ISTimeline/ISTimeline.xcodeproj -scheme ISTimeline -configuration Release -derivedDataPath /Users/dan/Library/Caches/org.carthage.CarthageKit/DerivedData/10.2_10E125/ISTimeline/v1.0.0 -sdk iphoneos ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY= CARTHAGE=YES archive -archivePath /var/folders/7t/yps0c3352m56m6jyvg_135c80000gn/T/ISTimeline SKIP_INSTALL=YES GCC_INSTRUMENT_PROGRAM_FLOW_ARCS=NO CLANG_ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE=NO STRIP_INSTALLED_PRODUCT=NO (launched in /Development/ios-v2/Carthage/Checkouts/ISTimeline)
```

Is it possible that you create an update to fix this build error?

Thanks!
Hi, i added this feature to be able to change font sizes of titles and descriptions directly in the file where you add the timeline object.
Adds the ability to add an optional image to points on the timeline.
Is it possible to set a different color for the bubble that I want? 

`timeLine.bubbleColor = UIColor.orange 
`
this code change for all bubbles of timeline. 
halo master
forgive my poor english
i get wrong when using oc invoke timeline

h file
```
@interface UserDetailViewController : UIViewController
@property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet ISTimeline *timeline;
@end
```

m file
```
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    self.timeline //Property 'points' not found on object of type 'ISTimeline *'
}
```
But other property of timeline is found except 'points'
could u tell me whats problem with that?

i notice something u might want to know as follow 
ISTimeline.h
```
import UIKit

public class ISTimeline : UIScrollView {
    open var pointDiameter: CGFloat { get set }
    open var lineWidth: CGFloat { get set }
    open var bubbleRadius: CGFloat { get set }
    open var bubbleColor: UIColor
    open var titleColor: UIColor
    open var descriptionColor: UIColor
    open var points: [ITUserSample.ISPoint] { get set }
    open var bubbleArrows: Bool
    override public init(frame: CGRect)
    required public init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder)
    override open func draw(_ rect: CGRect)
    override open func touchesEnded(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?)
}

```
ISPoint.h
```
import UIKit

public class ISPoint {
    open var title: String
    open var description: String?
    open var pointColor: UIColor
    open var lineColor: UIColor
    open var touchUpInside: Optional<(_ point: ISPoint) -> Void>
    open var fill: Bool
    public init(title: String, description: String, pointColor: UIColor, lineColor: UIColor, touchUpInside: Optional<(_ point: ISPoint) -> Void>, fill: Bool)
    public convenience init(title: String, description: String, touchUpInside: Optional<(_ point: ISPoint) -> Void>)
    public convenience init(title: String, touchUpInside: Optional<(_ point: ISPoint) -> Void>)
    public convenience init(title: String)
}

```
Animating Circle and line to move to the next item, animation would look nice with a gradient color moving in a masked circle and line...
It would be really nice to be able to give spacing (gap) between each row, or specify a row height.
would be great to support reverse timeline from bottom to top 
It would be a nice feature to be able to specify the background color of each bubble individually, rather than have all bubbles the same color.
