please
I think it's better present with an image until we get proper highlighting for GitHub. I've used https://github.com/cocopon/iceberg.vim for the image.

Also, FYI I updated https://github.com/kutsan/vim-fetlang with a few minor changes, mostly docs and stuff. I think that's better now.
When building on Ubuntu 16.04 using the standard procedure from README, the build directory is not automatically created. This can be fixed by creating the directory manually.
I tried to write my Home Work for AI in Fetlang, but Operations like random Numbers and convenient access to Elements in Chains are missing.  It would also great to have Data Strucktures like sets and maps (dict).
in the readme, it should say that the language is written "in such a way that" instead of "written such that"
Added missing punctuations (it's a fetish of mine)
Is Fetlang a good choice for Telegram bots? Are you available for hire/demonstrating how to do a Telegram bot with Fetlang @Property404?
More of a meta-issue than anything to do with the language. But you can add languages to the github language detection (called linguist) here: https://github.com/github/linguist

I think you can even assign a colour value to it (otherwise it's just grey) but I'm not 100% sure about that.

Could be cool to have github recognise the `.fet` files correctly :smile: 
The following is offensive IMO on account of the choice of occidental first names.
```
lick Ada's feet forty three times
lick Sasha's left nipple forty five times
lick Leo's balls sixty times
lick Randy's cock sixty two times
lick Wendy's asshole ninety one times
lick Ender's belly ninety three times
lick Orange's nose forty six times
lick Inky's forehead forty four times
```

Suggestions:
`lick Ahmed's balls sixty times` or
`lick Meera's left nipple forty five times`

`core` fetish should be renamed appropriately. I have three suggestions:

1. `handholding`
2. `cuddling`
3. `missionary`
