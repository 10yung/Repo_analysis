Hello. I am new in this area, not just NILM field, in Machine Learning in general. I am trying to run an experiment using Matlab based on FHMM algorithm, but I get an error. It is line 51 of the **disag_fhmm.m** file:

_pyObj = py.nilmtk.disaggregate.chris.fhmm.Fhmm();_

I read about the integration of Python with Matlab, but apart from that, my doubt is where is that function '_py.nilmtk.disaggregate.chris.fhmm.Fhmm()_', because I searched in the folders, but it is not here. How can I use that function?
I'm going to conduct a research assignment with NILM and I need some input on how to use the NILM-EVAL. 

I will collect plug data in my house together with the smart meter data. My goal is to make an algorithm that can be used in other homes similar to mine without needing additional training. To do this I want to train three algorithms and evaluate them on the new household: 

- From public datasets
- From my own house
- From both public and my own

My questions are: 
1. How can I continue using a trained algorithm in NILM-EVAL? It looks like it resets every time it runs? 
2. Can NILM-EVAL be run without the plug data when I have trained an algorithm? If so, what kind of results/plots will it output?
3. To test an algorithm blindly on new smart data, it looks like the only thing I should configure is to give it 0 training days. Is this correct? 
Hey beckel
I  met a  erro"The index is beyond the matrix dimension."  when I run the scripts run_experiment.m . Is there anything wrong about the weiss_initial.yaml?

I am working with the ECO dataset and I'm trying run the fhmm.py on it.  I have been unsuccessful in fitting the appliance data because it throws me divide by zero warning. Is there some preprocess I don't know about before running the fhmm.py? 

In the meantime I was using some values in the notebook (http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nilmtk/nilmtk/blob/v0.1.0/notebooks/fhmm.ipynb) and itseems to be fitting the ECO meter data poorly because eventhough there aren't any NaNs and infinite values, I am getting 'array must not contain infs or NaNs' error. Any idea why else this maybe happening? 
Hi,

I run kolter's algorithm with default configuration and experiment, hover, I got an error:

Error using kmeans (line 159)
KMEANS does not accept complex data.

Error in SpectralClustering (line 66)
C = kmeans(U, k, 'start', 'sample', ...

Error in kolter (line 103)
        clusters = SpectralClustering(adjacencyMatrix, numOfClusters, 1);
...

I use matlab2016a and wonder if it is the version problem.
Did any one meet this problem? Any help would be appreciated.
Thank you.

Hi, 
Looking at the code in Parson algorithm, 
        
       % calculate diff model params
        init = ones(1, length(state_means)) / length(state_means);
        num_states = length(init);
        idx = repmat(1:num_states,num_states,1);
        emit_mean = state_means(idx) - state_means(idx');
        emit_cov = state_covs(idx) + state_covs(idx');

What is the meaning of emit_mean and emit_cov?
For example, for emit_cov we obtain:

                OFF    ON
       OFF   10      45
       ON    45      80

It means that the variance OFF to ON is 45 ?

I am using the available code to run some simulations and while computing the results I am not able to find result.yaml file in the code base. I know this question is asked before, but still there is no information of what this file should contain.
It would help if you could explain what the five columns in result.events explain.

Hi Beckel,

After running the experiment "Weiss_initial" some results are produced in this folder path...
\GitHub\nilm-eval\Matlab\results\ 

in the form of .mat files for only households 1,2 & 4 (am not sure why it didn't produce for all 6 houses). Now I would like to visualize this by plotting them. 

Your report says "user specify the plot's content in a YAML file named result.yaml in this location 'input/result.yaml' and execute the plotExperiment.m script" but I don't find this result.yaml file in my current working directory. Should this be written by me? or is there a sample file that I can input? 

Pls clarify and advice.

Thanks.

Hi Beckel,

After having done the troubleshooting two nights ago. I'd now prepared 1 set of OPL DataSet in format (2015-01-09.mat) very similar to that of yours "Appliance034920150110". Now I would like to use my dataset and run "nilm-eval/Matlab/algorithms/parson_alg" from NILM-EVAL repository. 
Could you guide as to where do I start the application demo? Alternatively, if you have a starting point (i.e.guide) to testing the same algo with ECO dataset atleast that could be fine as well.

Thanks & looking forward.

Balaji
