Hello, 
I am running into a crash on release builds.

Trying to build with Xcode 11.2.1, target iOS 13 and above.

I tested with my personal app and the Xcoordinator Example app and both are the same result.

I wasn't seeing this before in Release builds. It will build successfully in Debug builds, but once I change the scheme to Release, it crashes on EXC_BAD_ACCESS.

Let me know if you can't repro and need more information.
