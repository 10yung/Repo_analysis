**Environment:**

- Swift 5 
- Xcode 11.3.1

**Problem:**
I implement the logger using the various levels of severity however all the log statements in the console are still white. I have tried changing themes and yet I still cannot have TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, or ERROR to appear in the console with the proper colors.

**Example Logger Setup:**

```
    // MARK: Logging
    
    private lazy var log = Logger(formatter: .default, theme: .tomorrowNightEighties, minLevel: .trace)
```

**Example Console Output:**

Hi, unfortunately SwiftPM is currently unable to depend on this package @ 2.0 due to the naming of the version numbers.

The previous ones are all prefixed with 'v', v0.5, v1.0, ... And then it's just '2.0'. Obviously this should be improved in SwiftPM, but it would be a quick and easy fix here until that happens ðŸ˜Š 
Xcode complained about some missing symbols which were resolved by the Foundation imports. Besides that it seems to work fine now for use with Xcode 11's SwiftPM support ðŸ˜Š
As you know, Apple removed support for XCode plugins in 2016, and we need some way to color code the logs. So I have added a provision to setup emojis for log levels. Please go through the code, and let me know what you think.

I have not updated readme or version number, yet. I'll update it, if this change is merged.
This is definitely one of the better and more flexible logging frameworks for client side swift. Awesome work.

It would be great, however, to add an abstraction which will allow you to assign multiple output locations. E.G., Instead of just logging to standard output, it would be nice to be able to take the same `record` and just send it to another logging service via https.

Happy to open a PR for this when I get the time.
