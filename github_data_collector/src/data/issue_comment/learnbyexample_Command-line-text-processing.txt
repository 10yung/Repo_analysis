The awk inplace editing section had introduced an incorrect variable 'INPLACE_SUFFIX' for backup. As of gawk 5.0 (not sure about earlier versions), this does not produce the expected result of creating a backup file.

The correct variable to use is `inplace::suffix` as seen in the [official gawk manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Extension-Sample-Inplace.html)
The paste commands generated an error as is, but adding the '-' fixed it and continued to work in my Linux VM. Here is the error I got in Mac OS without the hyphen:

usage: paste [-s] [-d delimiters] file ...

Here is the output of `uname -a` on my Mojave 10.14.2 Mac OS system:

...and on my Linux system:

First, I'm sorry for submitting a PR (#11) without reading the README more closely. Just wanted to contribute what I hope will be some useful knowledge to the project.

IMHO, `less` is a largely underutilized tool that can greatly improve upon, if not replace, the functionality of several other commands--namely `cat` & `tail`--as you'll see in my PR. Also `less` is a tool of convenience because how many times have you opened a file with it, then exited `less` to open it in your editor? Yet you can jump straight into your editor from within `less`! Lastly, you can view multiple files with `less` in a manner--and keystrokes--akin to changing buffers in vim.
â€¦multiple files

XML: xmllint --format
JSON: cat $file | python -mjson.tool

That kind of thing might be useful for this collection.
updated the tail_less_cat_head.md to add Tee commands.
I think it would be a good idea to mention the `tee` command, probably somewhere in the "Cat, Less, Tail and Head" chapter
