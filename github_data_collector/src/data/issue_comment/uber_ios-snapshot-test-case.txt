Noticing this on Xcode 10.3, I can run recordMode and then when I do the UI tests sometimes the image comparison is off by one pixel in size:

Snapshot comparison failed: Error Domain=FBSnapshotTestControllerErrorDomain Code=3 "Images different sizes" UserInfo={NSLocalizedFailureReason=referenceImage:{240, 240}, image:{240, 239}, FBDiffedImageKey=<UIImage: 0x600002bf6d10>, {80, 80}, FBReferenceImageKey=<UIImage: 0x600002b865a0>, {80, 80}, FBCapturedImageKey=<UIImage: 0x600002b9a140>, {80, 79.666666666666671}, NSLocalizedDescription=Images different sizes}

Note above the 80x80 icon is reported as 80x79.66 which makes the 240x240 @3x size become 240x239. I'm not sure why this is happening, but a month ago I noticed that views that were purposely 0.5 pixel in height (and I assumed width) got reported incorrectly, too.

Any way to avoid this?
Hi,
My Dashboard view has been created by multiple view controller views. How I can perform snapshot testing for such view. If I use baseviewcontroller then only base view appears, but there are 3 others subviews added to baseview from 3 others controllers. How to capture full dashboard snapshot at reference folder.
I using these commands to set page indicator color

```
let appearance = UIPageControl.appearance()
appearance.pageIndicatorTintColor = .gray
appearance.currentPageIndicatorTintColor = .black
```

- Left is running in the simulator it works fine.
- Right after captured for test case it not show.
It would be great to be able to run all tests on X devices at the same time.
Is there a way to do it nicely?

Last time I tried to start multiple `fastlane scan` the snapshots were inconsistent.
Hello ðŸ‘‹, 

I work on a project that supports both Light and Dark mode and thought it would be nice to take snapshot references of views in different themes. This PR adds a few helper methods to accomplish that. Any feedback would be appreciated.

Cheers,

Hi @alanzeino - 
I'm filing this to track the exact same issue described in:  https://github.com/uber/ios-snapshot-test-case/issues/33

I'm seeing this issue on my development machine.  I've used iOSSnapshotTestCase for many years on many different machines.  Thank you for rescuing it and maintaining it.

I had it working correctly on this very macbook 3 weeks ago but couldn't commit to the main project (long story).  So I created a new branch and set it up again.  

For some reason the images are being stored in my derived data.  I've included the log entry from Xcode (the "xxxx" is just redacting part of this).

I'm continuing to work on this and will try the debugging suggested in issue #33.  If you are wiling to take another look into this please let me know what additional information you need.  

Thanks!
Adam

After updating MacOS up to Catalina 10.15 and Xcode up to 11.1 (11A1027)

I found that tests on other Mac device are failed with reference images saved an my Mac device.

Latest stable version 6.2.0 of library are used.

I spend 2 days trying to find the reason and fix it, implement "Highlight Different Pixels" feature and create request #108 which can help investigate such situations.

But now a time I have no ideas how to fix this issue.

When perPixelTolerance == 0 is used library sometimes produce not representable diffs([example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7813723/67786886-ad31f100-fa80-11e9-8703-83daa6e42e4a.png))

It happens because of used kCGBlendModeDifference for generating diff images and it's implementation are not very precise.

For such situations I implemented highlightDifferentPixels property of FBSnapshotTestCase which when is true acitivate producing of diff image with highlighted pixels [(example)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7813723/67787005-dfdbe980-fa80-11e9-8055-c439ceebcc84.png).

```
class AnyTestCase: FBSnapshotTestCase {
    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()

        recordMode = false
        highlightDifferentPixels = true
    }
}
```

Hi, I'd like to report wired behavior.
I tried to take snapshot of root view for a simple ViewController.
After recorded its reference image successfully, turned `recordMode` into false and found the test failed.
Without any code nor visual changes to the ViewController, diff is rendered as below.

|reference|failure|diff|

* iOSSnapshotTestCase 6.1.0
* iPhone 8 Plus 12.4 Simulator
* Swift 4.2
* XCode Version 10.3 (10G8)

With iPhone Xs simulator, failure image slightly changes from its reference image (of course with no change in code nor storyboard) and diff is incorrectly rendered too.

The ViewController

* loads its view from storyboard using https://github.com/tarunon/Instantiate (a wrapper for `storyboard.instantiateInitialViewController()`)
* completes initialization for its view within `viewDidLoad`

I couldn't make sense of it and hope this to be resolved.
