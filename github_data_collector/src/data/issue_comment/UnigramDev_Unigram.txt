It'd be good to upgrade to newer ones, like in the whole app
The bug seems to be present just in the same screen when the phone number has to be inserted.
In case it isn't clear the bug is about the color not being the same of the background in the upper part.

To reproduce:
1. Logout
2. Login
3. Enter your phone number
4. Once in the phone verification page go back

This will be the result

It would be nice to have the same intro that is present in the iOS app, that uses animation instead of static images

Hi!
I'd would be great to rotate a photo while viewing it inside the app. As currently I need either to rotate my head, screen or to save all the photos sent to me and open in another viewer.

With the preview it's shown the whole chat name, but if I press the picture, I will go to its extended view, instead of chat info. With the mouse hover they should be separated.
When a message is sent to a channel linked to a group, this message appears in the group, as well. iOS client shows a "channel" title for this kind of messages. I'd like that to happen with Unigram

Also, I can't Save the profile image with the `Ctrl+S` key, please fix it.
