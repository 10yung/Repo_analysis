**Describe the bug**
Autotype cuts off last character of the username and inserts it into the password field
Eg: 
Usernam {TAB} ePassword {ENTER}
This of course causes logins to fail. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an entry with username/password to autotype
2. Press the hotkey to trigger autotype (Command+T)

**Expected behavior**
Username and password should be typed correctly

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - macOS: Catalina 10.15.2
 - Version 0.7.10

**Edit**: I have to say that this bug isn't present in KeePassXC using the same kbdx file, entry and target windows. One difference I've noticed is that KeePassXC types a bit slower whereas MacPass seems to type instantly, maybe that's the cause of the issues? My target window is a remote windows desktop inside Citrix Workspace, so could be that the input is too fast for Citrix to process correctly.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

At work all of our passwords have a 180 day expiration.  This falls between the '90 days' and '1 year' presets that are presented in the drop-down.  I also find this frustrating with places with other fixed cycles.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

It would be neat if we could add custom presets to the presented options.  I cannot see a way to do this currently, so apologies if it's already there and I just missed it.  I did search the wiki and website for a solution too.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

Presently I use the 'date' command in a terminal to find what the date will be in (for example) 180 days and then manually select the option.  As we already have presets, I presume the logic is in MacPass to do the calculation internally so this will require a UI to add custom presets and then logic to display them in the drop down and perform the calculation.

**Describe the bug**
Autotype prints "a" the length of the password into Windows Remote Desktop connections. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to an RDP window, bring up notepad
2. Click back to macpass
3. Change autotype sequence to `{PASSWORD}`
4. Run autotype
5. RDP window comes back to the forefront, and shows aaaaaaa (the length of the password)

**Expected behavior**
Autotype should have filled notepad with the correct password

**Screenshots**
N/A

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - macOS: 10.15.2 (19C57)
 - Version: 0.7.10

**Additional context**
Similar behaviors reported in keepassx for RDP, NxMachine, and VMWare. 
* https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/3080

**Why this bug matters**
The standard way to change a password on a windows server is to press ctl+alt+delete to bring up the change password dialogue. The copy / paste buffer is disabled while that dialogue is up, which means you have to manually type long complex passwords correctly multiple times (old, new, new password). 

You can go into computer management and change the administrator password manually, but it comes with scary dialogue boxes telling you to use ctl+alt+delete, and warns of lost information, death, destruction, pestilence, and the salting of your most fertile fields (or maybe just the first one in that list).
**Describe the bug**
All entries copies to the clipboard needs to be removed after some seconds, as configured in the Preferences dialog. Unfortunately this does not happen, the copied usernames and password remain forever in the clipboard.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Start MacPass and open an database.
2. Open the Preferences dialog, set Clipboard cleanup time to 10 seconds.
3. Select some database entry, copy the password from the Inspector pane by using right click on the password textfield.
4. Open a texteditor and paste the copied password immediately. 
5. Repeat the paste action after 60 seconds, the password has not been removed from the clipboard!

**Expected behavior**
The password copied to the clipboard needs to be deleted after 10 seconds.

**Screenshots**
Not needed.

**Desktop:**
 - macOS: 10.15.2
 - Version 0.7.10

**Additional context**
It doesn't matter what kind of copy action I'm using (shortcut, right click, in inspector, in list), the problem is always the same.

**Describe the bug**
Import XML overwrites the contents of the active DB

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
File > Import > Import XML

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior for File > Import > Import XML is to append entries to the open database. Instead it wipes the entire contents of the active DB and overwrites them with the imported entries. 

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - macOS: 10.13.6
 - Version 0.7 (20171024171012-continuous)


Can a plugin interrupt or get feedback from Global Autotype? 

One scenario: a particular app bundle if you trigger global autotype the plugin could direct a different action or an additional action. So instead of looking for an entry it displays macPass or it outputs some text to the clipboard?

Second scenario: if no entry is found on trying to complete auto type plugin could receive the window title and in turn start to create a new entry in the current database?
**Describe the bug**
Many translations in French are missing such as:
TOUCHBAR_EDIT
TOUCHBAR_COPY_USERNAME
AUTOTYPE_NOTIFICATION_MACPASS_IS_MISSING_PERMISSIONS

**To Reproduce**
Lauch MacPass with the fr locale.

**Expected behavior**
Correct french messages.

**Desktop:**
 - macOS: 10.15.1
 - Version 0.7.10

**Additional context**
I can contribute to complete the French translations. What is the process?

Generic error: The application “MacPass” can’t be opened.

Hi there,
just a small idea/wish, that would bring more consistence into the Copy/Paste/AutoType shortcuts. Yes, they can be changed in the SysPrefs, but let me explain:

All "Copy" shortcuts come with and additional modifier key to the CMD key – like SHIFT or ALT. AutoType just has CMD+T, which is super awesome!!!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/458619/70041346-493da380-15bd-11ea-995f-a6f2f874bbb8.png)

But CMT+T is, at least with me, only step 2 after CMD+SHIFT+U to open the URL. This is super-handy and super fast – but there is this SHIFT key that somehow kicks the fun a little out of this thing. 

So, here I go with my plan:
What about switching the default shortcuts for "Copy Address" and "Open Address"?
CMD+U >> CMD+T would be so nice and finger-friendly!

Just an idea.
Thx and Cheers!
