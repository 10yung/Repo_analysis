Hi!

i am using webdevops/php-nginx-dev:7.3 and configured the user to uid 1000 via docker-compose.yml. I need that config because i dont want to run everything as root for convenience reasons (composer, etc).

No - my problem is, that i want to configure my logging to use /docker.stdout but i get permission errors.

How can i change the ownership/permissions of /proc/1/fd/{1,2} - so i am able to log to /docker.stdout from php-fpm process?

You reproduce the problem with:

```shell
docker run -it --user 1000 --entrypoint /bin/bash webdevops/php-nginx-dev:7.3

$:echo "hello world" > /docker.stdout

# response will be:
bash: /docker.stdout: Permission denied                                                                                                      
```
Is it possible to add yarn to the image? Without the need to do itself.
Hey there

I just spent a few hours trying to increase the `client_max_body_size`, but it always stayed at around 50M.

I tried to set the variable by mounting a .conf-file to `/opt/docker/etc/nginx/conf.d`.

Using `nginx -T` i created a dump of the generated config. There I saw that my file was being loaded, but further down the line the file `/opt/docker/etc/nginx/vhost.common.d/10-general.conf` was loaded and the only content of this file is `client_max_body_size 50M;`.

This means, it is in the current `latest` version not possible to increase the client_max_body_size unless one overwrites the mentioned file `10-general.conf` by mounting another one on top.

I don't think this is intended behaviour, because it is not mentioned anywhere in the docs.
Is there any reason why this file exists or sets a body size, thereby overwriting the server wide body size config?

I only used three relevant environment variables:
`WEB_DOCUMENT_ROOT=/app/public`
`PHP_POST_MAX_SIZE=500M`
`PHP_UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE=500M`

But I don't think that any of these settings should create this file.

The image is the current `latest` with hash `59c1c87c3474`. 

Thanks for an answer and thank you for the great work. If you need more information, just contact me.
Hello,

With docker-compose version 3.0 and higher, is no longer possible to add a healthcheck to a database service and set a conditional `depends_on`.
See: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#depends_on

As per https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/, we can use a script that waits for the database service to be healthy.
To avoid creating my own fork of the webdevops image, I thought it might be useful to include this script in the mysql and postgresql versions of the image.
It could be optional to use it (so not having it as the default entrypoint or cmd ...), but at least have it inside the image.


I have a PHP application in AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Docker. In my dockerfile i use `FROM webdevops / php-nginx: alpine-php7` however I need to add the Oracle extension to use `oci_connect.` How can I do this?
This morning I was tinkering a little and while installing a composer dependency I noticed the `don't run composer as root message` which led go down the rabbit hole a little

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm -u 1000 webdevops/php-apache:7.2 whoami
root
```

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm -u 1000 webdevops/php:7.2 whoami
root
```

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm -u 1000 webdevops/php-official:7.2 whoami
root
```

The expected behaviour here would be `whoami: application` I guess


Hello,

We need to install the ddtrace php extension but we can't manage to do it.
We are using the nginx-php:7.1 and 7.2 image and we are using the following method:

    wget https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-php/releases/download/0.15.0/datadog-php-tracer_0.15.0_amd64.deb
    dpkg -i datadog-php-tracer_0.15.0_amd64.deb

Which result in php-fpm restarting to a zend_mm_heap corrupted.

How to reproduce:

1/ Use nginx-php:7.1 image
2/ cd /opt
3/  wget https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-php/releases/download/0.15.0/datadog-php-tracer_0.15.0_amd64.deb
4/ dpkg -i datadog-php-tracer_0.15.0_amd64.deb
5/ php -i  => Error

Hi, we have been using webdevops/liquibase docker image in our project for some time and suddenly we started seeing errors during integration tests where liquibase mysql insertion with date value is failing. Sample error message is shown below. There is no change in the liquibase source xml files so wondering if there was any recent update in the docker image that is causing issues. (we always pull latest image).  
Mysql query below is correct except that date value has no quotes around it, that's why it is failing.
However, we are not sure what is causing the sudden removal of quotes in the date value. ?? 
Any response is highly appreciated.

Error message =============
