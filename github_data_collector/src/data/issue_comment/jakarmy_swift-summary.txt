Markup on Playgrounds makes code more readable as it makes it clear what sections are real code, and what sections are just comments. It gives a much more elegant styling to the whole document. Some chapters are still using traditional comment syntax.
Example:
`// This is a comment` or `/* This is a comment block */`

The current status of each chapter regarding markup is:
- [x] The Basics 
- [ ] Basic Operators
- [ ] Strings and Characters
- [ ] Collection Types
- [ ] Control Flow
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Closures
- [ ] Enumerations
- [ ] Classes & Structs
- [ ] Properties
- [ ] Methods
- [ ] Subscripts
- [ ] Inheritance
- [ ] Initialization
- [ ] Deinitialization
- [ ] ARC
- [ ] Optional Chaining
- [ ] Error Handling
- [ ] Type Casting
- [ ] Nested Types
- [ ] Extensions
- [ ] Protocols
- [ ] Generics
- [ ] Access Control

In order to write markup to chapters, please make sure to:
1. See other chapters with markup already in them as reference for writing markup in other chapters.
2. Include basic elements in each chapter such as:
   **Common Header**

   **Page Linkers**
   `[Previous](@previous) | [Next](@next)`
   **Paragraph Markers**
   `/*: This is a paragraph`
   **Other elements present in the [Apple Markup Formatting Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016497) to add markup to the different chapters.**
3. Link to other pages when possible, using the `[Page Name](@page)` syntax.
4. Follow the [Apple Markup Formatting Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016497) to add markup to the different chapters.
5. Please, all changes to a specific chapter should be included in a **separate branch, with its name specifying the Chapter's name and number**: Branch name: `markup_chapter_2_basic_operators`.

This issue will be updated as chapters begin using markup.
