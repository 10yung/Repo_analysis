Hi 

Thanks a lot for your work.

I have a graph dataset in which each graph has its own adjacent matrix, feature matrix, and label matrix. How can I train the model on this kind of dataset?
Hello,I have a question. In your code, "features[test_idx_reorder, :] = features[test_idx_range, :]" and "labels[test_idx_reorder, :] = labels[test_idx_range, :]" might mean shuffling,but why I remove these,the accuracy decrease to 27%.
Hello, thank you for your work.
I want to ask, in the code only set the number of iterations, not the batchsize and epoch, so where are these two set?
Thank you very much!
Dear tkipf, I have a question in our current project, and I need your help. 

For example, there is a human being consisted of six lines (a matchstick men), and I need to detect the head, hand and the joint. This matchstick men may have different pose, the length of arm and leg may be varied, or the arm/leg may be missed. I want to use the graph neural network to solve this problem. However, in my application, one matchstick men is a sample which is different from that in graph neural network. Is my understanding correct?

For this application, do you have any suggestion? Thank you for your time. 
Dear kipf,

Have you also tried with MNIST dataset for this method?
I see this is node classification, and I wonder if this model can work with MNIST or any other of image dataset.
with cora,
A =  N x N
X =  N x D
Y =  N x E

with MNIST or other images,
A = D x D
X = S x D
Y = S x E
Ex. [D: Features(28 x 28 = 784), S: Samples, E: class]
If I want to implement this model to try on image dataset such as MNIST, I wonder how this code can be changed to use. 

Thank you
In this paper, there is a description of complexity:
> In practice, we make use of TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015) for an efficient GPU-based implementation of Eq. 9 using sparse-dense matrix multiplications. The computational complexity of evaluating Eq. 9 is then O(|E|CHF), i.e. linear in the number of graph edges.

while I cannot get the result, i.e., O(|E|CHF). More specifically, I think it should be O(|E| H max(C, F)), which is much smaller than your result. Could you give some explanations about this? Thanks very much.
Hello,
First 140 nodes in cora that you are considering as Train-Samples, are those node indexes are 0-139 or something else in Adjacency Matrix?
To be exact, it is possible to edit the file utils.py. However, when I run train.py, it can not recognize the modified utils.py. Instead, it runs the original utils.py, which is located in the path that "C:\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\gcn-1.0-py3.6.egg!\gcn\utils.py"
Can you help me? Thanks a lot.
Hi, tkipf, i run GCN on NELL dataset. I have watched the closed issue #14 and edit the code, but i still have the same problem.
this is the errore output:

Can you tell me how to fix this?
Hi, I have very different question but related to graph auto encoder.

I was going through this paper recently https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.02441.pdf which is focusing on node classification and clustering methods.

I tried the model and running on cora, citeseer and pubmed dataset since all three datasets are available in X feature matrix and adjacency matrix A format.  

But I am really confused how they are doing clustering on Coil20 and mnist dataset ?
Actually my main question is how to convert mnist and coil20 dataset into (X,A ) format so I can feed it to GCN or other networks? 

Can you please take a look into it.

Thanks in advance !
