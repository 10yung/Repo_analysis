This is a draft for percentile computation.
Usually, the average query time is not very useful, while 99 percentile can give more insights about slow queries.
In this PR I use sampling for query times, this is not a very efficient algorithm like T-digest.
I think in future we will implement something more precise.

I'm looking into this project for production use, and one thing I'm not sure about is how we can get monitoring data out of this system. We currently use pgbouncer and the [pgbouncer_exporter](https://github.com/stanhu/pgbouncer_exporter) to monitor it in Prometheus.

Is there a similar level of functionality here? Would it be possible for Odyssey to expose Prometheus data directly?

Hello!

**Problem:**
There is no access to the public schema of another user's database. When connecting to a postgresql server without odyssey, there is access.

Users are postgres (superuser) and zabbix. The zabbix user is the owner of the zabbix database. When connecting via odyssey by postgres, you cannot read the public schema of the zabbix database.

Connect to postgresql server without odyssey:
```
[root@hl-pg-conpool01 ~]# psql -h 10.51.21.68 -p 5432 -U postgres -d zabbix -c "\d" | head -n 6
Password for user postgres:
                    List of relations
 Schema |            Name            |   Type   | Owner
--------+----------------------------+----------+--------
 public | acknowledges               | table    | zabbix
 public | actions                    | table    | zabbix
 public | alerts                     | table    | zabbix
```

Connect to postgresql server via odyssey
```
[root@hl-pg-conpool01 ~]# psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5000 -U postgres -d zabbix -c "\d" | head -n 6
Password for user postgres:
Did not find any relations.
[root@hl-pg-conpool01 ~]# psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5000 -U zabbix -d zabbix -c "\d" | head -n 6
Password for user zabbix: 
                    List of relations
 Schema |            Name            |   Type   | Owner  
--------+----------------------------+----------+--------
 public | acknowledges               | table    | zabbix
 public | actions                    | table    | zabbix
 public | alerts                     | table    | zabbix
```

At the same time, with any attempt to log in by any user in the logs, the following messages:
```
Dec 02 13:33:12 hl-pg-conpool01 odyssey[2487]: 2487 02 Dec 13:33:12.094 error [c8b88b95d7a0f none] [user - zabbix, db - zabbix] (auth) read error: Resource temporarily unavailable

Subj.
I've tried to make formatting as close to current as possible
Usage:
find . -regex '.*\.\(cpp\|hpp\|cu\|c\|h\)' -exec clang-format -style=file -i {} \;
Hello,

assume you have a powerful machine and about 1000 clients or more. 
What would be a good configuration and which parameters can harm? 
Right now I can see that clients are disconnected often. Not sure if the problem is on client side or on server side.

Soe here are some settings that I modified in the odyssey config from git:

- pool_size 300 (does it make sense to set this value to zero? Wouldn't it be the same like connecting directly to the database?)

- workers 10 (I think that value is way to high but can it harm?)

- resolvers 50 (Not sure what they do and what the optimal value should be)

Are there maybe some parameters that should be modified in the use case that a lot of clients are keeping the SQL connection and fetching or inserting data to the database? 

Also, what would be the best way to start odyssey? Right now started it from the console.

Thanks a lot for any hint!
