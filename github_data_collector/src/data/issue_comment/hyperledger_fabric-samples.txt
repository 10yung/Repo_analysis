Moving fabcar from byfn to the new test network.
- Using the CAs supported natively by the test network
- Using the scripts provided by the test network and remove the chaincode deployment in `startFabric.sh`
- Change connection profile path
- user1 > fabcarUser since user 1 is already registered with the CA
- Adding a `stopFabric.sh` script so users do not have to change directories.
