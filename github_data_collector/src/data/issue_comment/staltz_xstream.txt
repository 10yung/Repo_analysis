<summary>Changelog</summary>

*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Updated typings so that `empty()` and `never()` have `Stream<never>` type, instead of `Stream<any>` type.

This pull request addresses https://github.com/staltz/xstream/issues/281.
Since there are no other opinions over a half year, I've sent a PR as an advanced step of the proposal.

@staltz If you are against for the changes, please feel free to close this 🙏 
Hey Staltz, I was wondering if you'd be open to exporting two interface subtypes of `Stream<A>`, one that contains all of the methods that are contravariant in `A` maybe called `Sink<A>` and one that contains all of the methods that are covariant in `A` maybe called `Source<A>`. This would allow for proper subtyping of methods that are expecting source / sink streams as `Stream<A>` is currently invariant in `A`.

For example

```ts
export type ContravariantMethods = 'addListener' | 'removeListener' | 'subscribe'
export interface Sink<A> extends Pick<Stream<A>, ContravariantMethods> {}
```

Most of the covariant methods on `Stream<A>` are static, with the exception of `remember` and `debug`. So the Source type makes less sense.
Hey guys, `fp-ts@2.0.0` moved away from a method chaining API to a more static land style API which means it doesn't gel very well with xstream anymore. Would you be opposed to exporting all of operator methods as static functions curried in their stream argument? Right now I have a little helper file that re-exports methods as needed.

e.g.

```
export const map = <A, B>(f: (a: A) => B)) => ($: Stream<A>): Stream<B> => $.map(F)
```


What do you think of adding the support for handling common `addListener/removeListener` event emitter targets to `fromEvent`, not just dom nodes?
