Hi Team, while creating a docker image using this code snippet in m,y Dockerfile, the image creation fails at command: RUN ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key -N ''

/bin/sh: ssh-keygen: command not found
The command '/bin/sh -c ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key -N ''' returned a non-zero code: 127
I've run the docker pull command to get the centos with mariadb image, however when I run the command to create a container from that image the container dosen't seems to work. 

First the issue was related to the port 3306 being on use since I already had mysql installed and it was using that port however, after setting it to "inactive" the issue with the port being on use dismissed. 

But now , I do not now the reason, when I create a container following the page example:

docker run --name=mariadb -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<password> <yourname>/mariadb

The container that it creates gets "Exited" Immediately , even if afterwards I run a docker start It gets Exited within 2 seconds.

I am getting this error while running build 
docker build --rm -t kiran/httpd .

I am sorry to open this up like this, but, this hasn't been updated since 2016 and still doesn't support IPv6 ... May I ask for when an update?
Also, does this support dlz w/mariadb(mysql) support?

Thank you.
[The `centos/systemd` image on docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/centos/systemd/) only has [the tag `latest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/centos/systemd/tags) right now.

This will make things exciting when Centos 8 is released.

I suggest adopting `centos/systemd:7-latest` and `centos/systemd:7.6` tags now, so that when CentOS 8 is released there isn't any major pain for consumers of the image.
