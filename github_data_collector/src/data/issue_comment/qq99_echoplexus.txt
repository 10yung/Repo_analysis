Thank you for helping me get the "esprima-six" issue sorted out!  Now, after setting everything up according to the readme and install files, this is the error I'm receiving:

```
app.min.js:5 Uncaught ReferenceError: _ is not defined
```

When I unminify app.min.js, this is the error:

`app.js:1121 Uncaught ReferenceError: _ is not defined`

Which points to this line of code:

`return window.events = _.clone(Backbone.Events)`

So, why is it not picking up underscore?

Does anyone have any suggestions?  TIA.

When I clone the repo and attempt to do npm install with node 5.7.8, here are the errors I'm getting:

```
npm ERR! 404 Registry returned 404 for GET on https://registry.npmjs.org/esprima-six

Does anyone have any suggestions?  I don't see esprima-six as a dependency in packages0.json.  TIA.

- I have few suggestions.. and here they are:
- Commands:
- /kick [user] [reason]
- /ban [user] [reason] [time in seconds]("time in seconds" is optional by the owner/mod)
- /unban [user]
- Here are my questions
- Can you delete the room called / and make a main channel for you and the devs for reporting bugs etc?
- Can you give me a link and/or a list of permissions to use when using the command /chmod ? because I dont know what they are

Is there any way to change password for a chatroom once you have typed /chown [password] and/or /private [channel password] ? and if there are no command for that,I would like to request it to be made

Everything appears to work, I don't see any errors but I get in the browser logs: 

```
/socket.io/1/?t=1424239420428 502 (Bad Gateway)
```

When I follow the link a page appears and it does not 502 (even on refreshes). Any ideas why this would occur?

1. connect to an irc channel
2. start to encrypt content
3. type a text line, it shows the text in the sender chat, but only '-' in other clients

Hi,

The irc-proxy is working really well, and it helps a lot for people not willing to install their own irc client.

Would it be possible to have a persistence as in 'normal' echoplexus channels ?

What would it require ? a bot connected to the channel to fetch the log ? is the same storage logic in use to display the chat lines between echoplexus/irc channels ?

thanks !

Alex

Right now it's a huge hack, want to slap my past self

This doesn't function properly: https://github.com/qq99/echoplexus/blob/90878bfe9ba7f2c2f8a66fe5351b84bd89aea811/src/client/modules/code/client.js.coffee#L40-L46
1. Go to /
2. Go to code
3. Go to channel /foo
4. Code panel isn't alive due to the above's deficiencies

Anything that fires / listens to that event there is terrible code!!! :anger: 

PSYC is a pretty cool protocol, but the other clients currently available are a mess and not updated. Many PSYC servers have a lot of features (email, jabber, IRC, and other gateways), but aren't very well maintained. If Echoplexus became a solid PSYC platform (since it is both a server and client), it could attract others to create build off of Echoplexus and/or create other PSYC platforms to federate with Echoplexus. It also already has many of the desired features of Echoplexus defined in its protocol. It would also put Echoplexus in the position of being able to shape the future of the protocol.

The protocol is defined here:

This could help solve all of the following issues: 
Federation: Issue #133 
Conversation threading: Issue #152 
P2P file transfer: Issue #157 
Nick handling: Issue #223 & #225 
Hashtag support (maybe): Issue #156 
IRC gateway/hooks (maybe): Issue #217 

And this could be part of the refactoring effort #198
