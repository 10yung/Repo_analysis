Hi. I found out that the arrow in the header is not animating on both states; from up to down and from down to up. If the cells are growing, the arrow animates nicely 90 degrees clockwise from up to down, but the other way around it just 'jumps' without animation. You can make this easy visible by slowing the animation down to a second or 3. 
Is this intended behavior? Is there a way to make the animation back up also smooth?

how can i achieve this section formate? 
In your examples you never set the delegate - this won't work for table view
this is what's missing : 

`class SelectionTableVC: CollapsibleTableSectionViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        delegate = self
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }

    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
        super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
        // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
    }

}`
Hello

I searched the documents for a delegate that would reload the tableView, not sure if it's available, could you please add it if not.

Thanks.

I made my table sections auto collapse when you open any other section via for loops.  One of my testers sent me these screenshots showing that the various fields from each section seem to get overlapped by headers from other sections.

I used the exact code from this repository and changed only a few lines of code to make the sections auto close and customized the data in ExampleData.swift.

In the CollapsibleTableViewController.swift, I added this into viewDidLoad:
```
                for index in 0 ..< sections.count {
                        sections[index].collapsed = true
    
                }
```

I updated my toggleSelection code as follows:
```
    func toggleSection(_ header: CollapsibleTableViewHeader, section: Int) {
        let collapsed = !sections[section].collapsed
        print("section = \(section)")
        // Toggle collapse
        print("toggle collapse")
        sections[section].collapsed = collapsed
        print("sections.count = \(sections.count)")
        let count = sections.count - 1
        for index in 0 ... count {
            if index != section {
                sections[index].collapsed = true
            }

        }
        header.setCollapsed(collapsed)
        tableView.reloadSections(IndexSet(integersIn: 0...sections.count-1), with: .automatic)
    }
```

Here is the screenshot of the bug in action:

Any ideas what could be causing this? I can't replicate this in my testing but my tester keeps having this happen.

Thanks
