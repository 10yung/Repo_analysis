The supported version for Hadoop mentioned in ecosystem is 2.x [this doc](https://hadoop.apache.org/submarine/ecosystem/).
But I'm not able to find submarine jars for hadoop 2.7, the only available jar is for version 3.2

Hello @liuxunorg 
Thank you for your great work.

I read your code and can't understand how can submarine.sh work ? I think maybe your haven't commit yet. The detail is as follow.

1. The install script at  submarine-installer/install.sh try to load the installer
```bash
# import shell script
. ${ROOT}/scripts/submarine.sh
``` 
2. the installer did something like this. Just copy submarine.sh to init.d

```bash
function install_submarine()
{
  cp "${PACKAGE_DIR}/submarine/submarine.sh" /etc/rc.d/init.d/submarine.sh
  chmod +x /etc/rc.d/init.d/submarine.sh
  chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local

  if [ "$(grep -c "/etc/rc.d/init.d/submarine.sh" /etc/rc.d/rc.local)" -eq '0' ]; then
    echo "/etc/rc.d/init.d/submarine.sh">> /etc/rc.d/rc.local
  fi
}
```

3. So submarine component should be in [submarine/submarine.sh](https://github.com/hadoopsubmarine/submarine-installer/blob/master/package/submarine/submarine.sh) . But all i can see is this : 

```bash
chown :yarn -R /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct
chmod g+rwx -R /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct

# If GPUs are used，the access to cgroup devices folder is neede as well
chown :yarn -R /sys/fs/cgroup/devices
chmod g+rwx -R /sys/fs/cgroup/devices
```
I try to reach the official document at [apache submarine](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.2.0/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-applications/hadoop-yarn-submarine/QuickStart.html) , but i didn't help either. Could you take a look.

Thank you.
