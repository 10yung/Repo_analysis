Hi, is there any way to print the page or div using **window.print()** function?


Hello! I know there was a brief mention of an add-on system similar to Node being a good idea [in this issue](https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/issues/155) . What would be more reasonable to expect if this were implemented, exposing some plugin API that encompasses "all possible cases" to the JS side or having plugin devs write DLLs/libs that would expose functionality to the JS side on a per-plugin basis? Or even better, if it ends up that Chromium becomes the default webview on all versions of Neutralino would Chromium extension APIs be available to us as well or is that limited to full-on direct implementations of Chromium?

I know that while Neutralino using other webviews on Windows is still being worked out that Windows users like myself have to settle with IE11 webview + polyfills if we use binary releases like v1.2.0, which also means that the more mature implementations of some newer web APIs like Web Audio might not be fully available to use natively. Exposing more system I/O like audio and probably using (sandboxed, probably) plugins would be groovy.
I made a simple app with an image embedded in the html file. The img src=""  line points to the path of the image file "/assets/imgs/filename.jpg". For some reason the image file won't show up. I've tried changing to browser in the settings.json but with no success. I know everything works because I've tried my app on a live server without Neutralino. 

Is images not supported yet?

**Specifications**  
* NeutralinoJs Version: [1.2.0]
* Platform: [Linux Ubuntu 19.10] 


**Expected Behavior**  
App to open.
  
**Actual Behavior**  
Terminal window opens to run start script, then app shows.

**Steps to Reproduce the Problem**  
Double click `neutralino-mac`.

**Specifications**  
* NeutralinoJs Version: latest
* Platform: MacOS


**Expected Behavior**  
We need a way of debugging the app in window mode.
  
**Actual Behavior**  
Couldn't find a way to debug the app in window mode (I basically need to open the inspector/dev tools within window mode), which is desperately needed as many features that are available in browser mode are not working in window mode, but I'm basically blind in regards of what's going wrong as I can't see the console errors.

**Steps to Reproduce the Problem**  
 1. For example, try to use HTML5 geoLocation API or Notifications API in your app
 2. Test it in browser mode, it works
 3. Switch to window mode, it doesn't work

**Specifications**  
* NeutralinoJs Version: latest (with mac-os build capability)
* Platform: OS X


i have basic html5 app that doesnt need any OS APIs . Hence this repo is perfect for build as this gives low ram and disk use. 

Only requirement remaining is to have a app icon. without this it looks very unprofessional. 

I want run it on raspi bu it not works
