When 2.8.0 was released, the source file `https://github.com/moul/advanced-ssh-config/archive/v2.8.0.tar.gz` had SHA256 checksum `e04de57ab048f1abee75e9e739514c4f47e6cbb8acacb9d58a6e2892df30dc42` (as verified and recorded by Homebrew servers at the time of release).

Now, it is `17656a6ac562707d6e85df44c1ccd04276fb1c08f1ff6a002291f4cb88880069`. Was that an intentional re-release, or was there a malicious change in the code?

Is this possible with "assh"?

Commands from the answer do not work with "assh".
Hi,

How can I setup a config like this:
```
 Host docker-skype
   User      docker
   Port      55555
   HostName  127.0.0.1
   RemoteForward 64713 localhost:4713
   ForwardX11 yes
```

I can't find a way to use RemoteForward on .yml files.

best regards,
Vitor Jr.
Maybe I'm missing something, but I cannot find what...
I have simple config like this

```yaml
hosts:

  hosta:
    HostName: hosta.example.com
    User: hostauser

  hostb:
    HostName: hostb.example.com
    User: hostbuser
```
My local machine user, let's say, called `user`

When I connect to both hosts in separate (`ssh hosta` or `ssh hostb`), everything is working just fine.

But when I try to use some host as a gateway, for example `ssh hostb/hosta` — it uses _my local username_ `user` to connect to `hostb`, not `hostbuser` as specified in config!

If I manually specify user, like `ssh hostbuser@hostb/hosta` — this works.
When using the following configuration (`assh version 2.8.0 (HEAD)`):

```
hosts:
  server:
    Hostname: 10.10.1.2
    Port: 22
    User: jeroen
    IdentityFile: ~/.ssh/identity/jeroen.key
    DynamicForward: 1080
    GatewayConnectionTimeout: 5 
    Gateways:
      - direct
      - home

  home:
    Hostname: <public_ip_of_firewall>
    Port: 443
    User: jeroen
    DynamicForward: 1080
    IdentityFile: ~/.ssh/identity/jeroen.key
```

The timeout of 5 seconds is not applied to the `direct` gateway. In result, the connection to 10.10.1.2 needs to timeout normally (around 2 minutes) before the `home` gateway is used.
This appears to only happen when I am on networks that drop firewalled packets instead of actively denying connections.

Am I not understanding the use of 'direct' properly or am I doing something wrong?
What I would like to accomplish is to try to connect to `server` directly if possible (basically when I am at home) and otherwise use an SSH Tunnel over the public internet to my home router.

Edit: I tried current master and result is the same (after applying the tiny patch from #323)
Hello
How can I from the command line override username for a gateway defined in assh.yml?

My use case is with Ansible where the username defined in playbooks as 'remote_user' is not the same as the existing username in assh.yml for the gateway. Meaning I need to change so it becomes like "ssh -J remote_user@gateway.example.com remote_user@target.example.com"

If one has 2 github accounts (large companies enforce you to use their github username sometimes) i want to cd into my client's folder `workspace/clientA` and use the ssh key `workspace/clientA/id_rsa` to connect to github instead my default one.

Does assh help me here? Any ideas how to achive that with before_hooks? 
Let's use a simple yaml file to generate a configuration:

```yaml
hosts:
  host.example.com:
    Inherits: "tpl-example"
  host2.example.com: {Inherits: "tpl-example"}
 
templates:
  tpl-example:
    User: foo
```

The result is:

```
# This file was automatically generated by assh v2.8.0+dev
# on 2019-07-31 00:51:28 +0200 CEST, based on ~/.ssh/assh.yml
#
# more info: https://github.com/moul/assh

# host-based configuration
Host host.example.com
  Port 22
  User foo
  # Inherits: [tpl-example]

Host host2.example.com

# global configuration
Host *
  ProxyCommand assh connect --port=%p %h
```

As you can see `host2` inheritance does not seem to be honoured as is should be.

I use this syntax because sometime it is more handy to have one host per line.

I use:
```
Debug mode (client): false
CLI Path: /Users/renard/Src/assh/assh
Go version: go1.12.7
OS/Arch: darwin/amd64
Version: 2.8.0+dev (HEAD)

RC files:
- ~/.ssh/assh.yml

Statistics:
- 2 hosts
- 1 templates
- 1 included files
```
I have a 3 gateway setup, and the gateway in the middle can be reached by from 2 gateways. When i successfully connect to the final host and disconnect through "exit" then ASSH still tries the next host in the list going into an infinite loop. I am running latest on OSX terminal
