My goal here is to be able to have a separate solution for my custom code from the squidex solution. 

It will be needed to publish a new nuget package with every new version of Squidex: `Squidex.Extensions.Dependencies`

It will be needed to edit the docker-compose files to include a volume on the plugins folder
e.g. current volume is `/etc/squidex/assets:/app/Assets` and new volume would be `/etc/squidex/plugins:/plugins`

I'm not sure it's a good thing to place the `plugins` folder in the root directory, but I'm also not sure it's good to put it beside the `.ts` files in `/app/`
