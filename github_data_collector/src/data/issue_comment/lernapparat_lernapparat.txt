Apparently, the following line should be changed in the class "MyConv2d": `x = F.conv_transpose2d(x, w, stride=2, padding=(w.size(-1)-1)//2)` should be instead `x = F.conv_transpose2d(x, w, stride=2, padding=int(w.size(-1)-1)//2)`.
This is the best Python implementation of Style GAN for Pytorch I've found, so I wanted to make it easy to use in other projects. Pytorch Hub makes it super easy for others to re-use this model and weights!

```python
import torch
model = torch.hub.load('ndahlquist/lernapparat:0.0.1', 'style_gan', pretrained=True)
# done! so easy!
```

Note: There are a few references to `ndahlquist/lernapparat` vs `lernapparat/lernapparat`. If you're interested to merge this contribution, I'm happy to change those.
Hi,

This code base lets us generate new samples, but it can't be used to train new models. Is there any possibility of you releasing that part of the pipeline as well?

Thanks!
Is this work covered by the MIT license? I understand that the NVIDIA model's won't be, but I was hoping the PyTorch code would be. 
Hi,

Thanks for releasing this code, it is helpful for me. But when i use a same noise input to your implementation and the official one, i got two similar image but not exactly same. 
Hi, 
When I attempt to train is model on GPU, it reports the error below, while it can be trained on CPU.
 
`RuntimeError: Assertion `dWeight.isContiguous()' failed.  at /opt/conda/conda-bld/pytorch_1532581333611/work/aten/src/THCUNN/generic/SpatialDepthwiseConvolution.cu:140`

Do you have any ideas about it?
