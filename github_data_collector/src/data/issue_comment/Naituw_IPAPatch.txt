build sucess 
but black screen and load not invoke

need help 
After the installation is successful, open the app and the app screen is always black.
Hi, I am trying to modify an app and add the Personal VPN entitlement. However when i try this i get 

The entitlements specified in your application’s Code Signing Entitlements file are invalid, not permitted, or do not match those specified in your provisioning profile. (0xE8008016).
Display Name 名字改了根本没效果啊。。。。。。
iam really tired of searching everywhere i tried many times to find solution to add admob in patched file but not working can you guide?
According to the document, new app supposed to be able to rename with 💊 as prefix in the Display name, though it keeps using the original name of the app we loaded.
## Description

I downloaded the cycript.framework from your [YouTube-demo](https://github.com/Naituw/IPAPatch/releases/tag/1.0.1). 

### 1. Place cycript.framework on  `IPAPatch/Assets/Frameworks/cycript.framework`

It could be successfully installed. But cant connect to it via cycript

```
➜  cycript_0.9.594 ./cycript -r 192.168.1.12:4567
*** _syscall(connect(socket_, info->ai_addr, info->ai_addrlen)):../Console.cpp(306):CYSocketRemote [errno=61]
```

>NIN: Revealserver is working with this method.

### 2. Place cycript.framework on  `IPAPatch/IPAPatch/cycript.framework`

It could build successfully. However, it couldnt install  on my Jailed iPhone.
An error reads `App Installation Failed - Could not inspect the application package.`

## Reproduction Steps of #2

1. `git clone https://github.com/Naituw/IPAPatch.git`
2. `cd IPAPatch`
3. `cp /path/to/youtube-demo/IPAPatch/Cycript.framework ./IPAPatch/`
4. Connect my iPhone to Mac, fix signing problems
5. Click Run


## Question

May I know where should I place cycript.framework?

如果有了mac版的ipapatch, 像微信mac版插件之类的开发会舒服很多.
Will you support PlugIns and Watch when ipa have AppExtensions?
```shell
# 6. Remove Plugins/Watch (AppExtensions), To Simplify the Signing Process

echo "Removing AppExtensions"
rm -rf "$TARGET_APP_PATH/PlugIns" || true
rm -rf "$TARGET_APP_PATH/Watch" || true
```
patch.sh这个文件中链接Dylib的代码应修改：

filename="${file%.*}"".dylib"
这样才能正确运行
