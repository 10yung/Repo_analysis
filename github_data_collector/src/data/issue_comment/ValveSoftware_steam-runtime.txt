I'm unable to switch resolution in Portal 2. It seems to have defaulted to my native one, 1080p, when I switched from 4:3 to 16:9 however, which is good. 

The font also seems to render slightly differently, and I think I prefer the non-Pressure Vessel font. 

Portal 2 running "normally":

Portal 2 running in Pressure Vessel:

I've not had the chance to verify whether I can reproduce the issue mentioned by TTimo here: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime/issues/222#issuecomment-571366445
POSTAL 2 singleplayer crashes after the content warning (mature content, etc., not an error), whereas the unsupported multiplayer instantly crashes. To be clear, this is when running it in Pressure Vessel.

[System Information](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime/files/4029958/sysinfo.txt)
The steam-runtime SDK seems to have the wrong version of PulseAudio. It appears to be version 1.1.0, but on my real SteamOS installation, it seems to be much newer (libpulsecore-5.0.so).

I downloaded a December snapshot of com.valvesoftware.SteamRuntime.Sdk-amd64,i386-scout-sysroot.tar.gz from
http://repo.steampowered.com/steamrt-images-scout/snapshots/

Using Docker, I was trying to build Kodi inside the steam-runtime SDK, and its CMake scripts automatically detected the PulseAudio version was 1.1.0 which is lower than their 2.0 requirement.

I presume this is a bug in the SDK that should be fixed. Also, in the meantime, can you recommend the cleanest way to update the PulseAudio in the SDK so I can try to complete the build?

Thank you

Having access to the build definitions could be useful for distributing games outside of Steam with the same runtime.
When attempting to run the game inside of Pressure Vessel it crashes instantly on startup, no window visibly appears.
Tested with Everlasting Summer.
When trying to run [Danger Gazers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043150/Danger_Gazers/) with the runtime container, it dies with this:

> /media/storage/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Danger Gazers/Danger_Gazers: error while loading shared libraries: libcrypto.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Trying the container, since it's a Game Maker title which bugs-out normally with:

> /media/storage/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Danger Gazers/Danger_Gazers: /home/liam/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-runtime/pinned_libs_64/libcurl.so.4: version `CURL_OPENSSL_4' not found (required by /media/storage/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Danger Gazers/Danger_Gazers)

(I really wish Game Maker would sort that out already...)

If you need other details/want me to try something else do let me know. System info: https://gist.github.com/LiamDawe/ea58011b3231eb14c5c04657d19e6e3d
With `PRESSURE_VESSEL_SHARE_HOME=0` set steam downloads saves to incorrect location `.local/share/feral-interactive/Life Is Strange/VFS/Local/My Games/Life Is Strange/Saves/`,  the correct location is `.var/app/com.steampowered.App319630/.local/share/feral-interactive/Life Is Strange/VFS/Local/My Games/Life Is Strange/Saves/`
I know this may seem like a stupid idea to some but it would be nice for the devs to consider. Please merge Proton with the new Steam Linux Runtime together and have Steam Linux Runtime as a rolling release feature on Linux. Also in my view if Proton were to be merged then everything could be in one place and might be easier for the devs to maintain with all the code in one place and certain games that refuse to work might also now work in container.
