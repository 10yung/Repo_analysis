This is the last thread (there have been already a few others) of people that mistakes the section progress bar with completeness of the project

https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/uploading-problem-with-the-2nd-project-of-responsive-design/341893

Maybe it needs to be a bit more clear
Or maybe once enough of the people that were in the middle of things when the progress bar has been introduced have gone forward it will not be brought up anymore...

This cuts the main bundle size dramatically, which mostly improves non-challenge pages (which do not use `@babel/standalone`).  With the third commit all challenges except ones using React have basically the same total download size as before the PR, with React challenges increasing slightly (~200KB).  I think the React challenges' total download is larger because dynamically loaded modules cannot 'dry' out duplicated code.

Regarding treating scripts as pure js, not jsx, I *think* that's fine.  It only would be a problem if there's jsx inside a script inside HTML, i.e. it won't be.

TODO:

- [x] get dynamic imports working when running `npm run test:curriculum`.  Currently the Babel setup in curriculum cannot handle `import()`,

There is a difference in the font size and the margin between the text , on the home page (freecodecamp.org) and the learn page (freecodecamp.org/learn). Although you may not notice it on first glance but it disturbs the UI. The "sign in and get started" button on home page is also wider 
than the "sign in to save your progress button" on /learn page.
