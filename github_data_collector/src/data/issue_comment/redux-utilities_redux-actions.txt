*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

This was all working fine

```
import {createActions, handleActions} from 'redux-actions';

const defaultState = {
  articles: null,
  articlesList: null,
  activeArticle: null,
  redirect: null,
};

export const actions = createActions({
  SET_ARTICLES: (articles) => ({articles}),
  SET_ACTIVE_ARTICLE: (activeArticle) => ({activeArticle}),
  REDIRECT: (redirect) => ({redirect}),
});

const reducer = handleActions({
  [actions.setArticles](state, {payload: {articles}}) {
    return {...state, articles};
  },
  [actions.setActiveArticle](state, {payload: {activeArticle}}) {
    return {...state, activeArticle};
  },
}, defaultState);


export default reducer;
```

all I did was add

```
  [actions.setArticlesList](state, {payload: {articlesList}}) {
    return {...state, articlesList};
  },
```

to the end of the list, and it isn't getting added to redux:

At the bottommost part of this documentation, https://redux-actions.js.org/introduction/tutorial is a broken link that looks like this [vanilla tutorial](https://www.webpackbin.com/bins/-KntJIfbsxVzsD98UEWF).
I'm following the docs to implement `redux-actions` in a project.
https://redux-actions.js.org/api/createaction#createactiontype

When I get to the error handling example:
```
const noop = createAction('NOOP');

const error = new TypeError('not a number');
expect(noop(error)).to.deep.equal({
  type: 'NOOP',
  payload: error,
  error: true
});
```

I noticed that when I pass an error for testing, like this:
```
const {
  successAction,
  errorAction
} = createActions({
  SUCCEESS_ACTION: payload => ({
    data: payload
  }),
  ERROR_ACTION: payload => ({
    error: payload
  }),
});

  try {
    let data;
    // ... some stuff to fetch data :)

    throw Error('Bad times on the internetz');

    successAction(data);
  } catch (error) {
    errorAction(error):
  }
```

The action is now:
```
{
  type: 'ERROR_ACTION',
  payload: {}, // Expected it to be 'Error: Bad times on the internetz' instance
  error: true
}
```

Did I write a wrong implementation? What should be the right way to get the error?
I want to be able to reduce the action with an error payload and save the error to the store for further steps (like showing a toast with the error message to the user)
Hello,
[Here](https://codesandbox.io/s/reactredux-1wxsh) is code sample. The issue is that when I combine actions without prefixing everything works OK. But without prefixing reducer react to first passed action type to combineActions. I'm just curious if that's not a bug.
