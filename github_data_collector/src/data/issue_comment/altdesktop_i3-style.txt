I'll admit that this is a corner case and one that I doubt you'll frequently run into; however, I wanted to mention it regardless.

I switch back and forth between Plasma 5 and i3. I booted into Plasma today and while surfing crates.io, I noticed this package. Installed it and upon running it with a few different flags, I kept getting errors.I decided to run the command *almost* directly from the readme. Here's the output::

```
$ i3-style gruvbox --output ~/.config/i3/config --reload
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }', libcore/result.rs:1009:5

Hi,

The blog link ([[1]](http://dubstepdish.com/blog/2013/11/06/introducing-i3-style/)) in your README.md file is dead, I'd like to see the capabilities of this program so please do correct this issue. 

Thanks for your time,
Brenton

Adding 2 transparent themes for Solarized dark and light modes.

Will update PR with video and link to blog post once I finish them, to show the result if you hesitate before merging it.

I've made a script that may be useful to include with the application.

By default it uses .i3/config as the output file, this is hardcoded.

This is a small script that iterates through all the themes and takes a screenshot of each one.
I use `scrot` to take the screenshot, but we could settle on something else.
I am not a shell scripting expert, so comments are more than welcome.

It would be pretty cool if there was a page showing theme screenshots.

Hello,

I opened #25 to talk about this PR.

Cheers,

Hello,

Thank to the [base16-builder](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder), I converted all [base16](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16) schemes to i3.
Should I open a PR with them?

Thank you for i3-style!

Hi!
is possible to suport color alias?
something like this:
...
set $color #455A64
...
background $color
