* **Description of Issue**: Star Gladiator Union Skill is not removing the buffs upon dispell / expiration of skill via duration. The bonuses are only removed on the conditions that the actual status has expired and when the character has loaded into a new map (return to savepoint after dying) or relogging in or receiving the SL_STAR / SC_SPIRIT.
  * Result: When dispelled or status duration ends, the actual SC_FUSION is removed along with the flying effect **but the bonus remains**<!-- Describe the issue that you experienced in detail. -->
  * Expected Result: Upon expiration of status, the bonuses should also be removed correct?<!-- Describe what you would expect to happen in detail. -->
  * How to Reproduce:  Cast SL_STAR on a Star Gladiator -> Cast SG_FUSION on that character -> dispell that character = removes flying effect along with SC_FUSION **OR** wait for the SC_FUSION duration to expire (default is 5 minutes but I've tested it on 5 seconds)<!-- If you have not stated in the description of the result already, please give us a short guide how we can reproduce your issue. -->
  * Official Information: RMS did not provide any description in regards to how the skill / status expires or whether it expires on death. It only describes the bonuses for the skill. <!-- If possible, provide information from official servers (kRO or other sources) which prove that the result is wrong. Please take into account that iRO (especially iRO Wiki) is not always the same as kRO. -->
