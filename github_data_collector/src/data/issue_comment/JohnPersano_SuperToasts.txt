Hello!

I'm working with old project (about 2014 y) which is using SuperToasts. I want to override to its latest 2.0 version, but there's a problem that all of methods are changed. You're so lucky man, I have no so much time for totally rewrite my libraries which is working well. So, Wiki's is so old, so can I ask you about newest alternatives?

1) `setOnButtonClickListener ()` What we need to add to the third argument of it? And what is second one? Trying to add `OnButtonClickListener` method, but it's an abstract.
2) How is `setOnDismissWrapper ()` method called now? I need it because there's widget repaint needed on this action.
3) Now new `setButtonIconResource ()` accept only one method, so the second one is not needed which was needed in old `setButtonIcon ()` method?

Thanks in advance!
