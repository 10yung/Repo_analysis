After following the installation steps I got this error.

"No language server is associated with this buffer"

I am not sure on what end its on. Ifs its on the lsp-intellij side or the lsp-server itself?
I'm sorry, but the instructions in the readme are insufficient to me. I don't even know what `gradle` is, nor where should I run the command `./gradlew clean buildPlugin`.

I also cannot find the exact version of Intellij here. This project requires `IntelliJ IDEA 2018.1.1`, but I can only find 2018.1.7. Do you have any idea where I can find it?

Thanks.
Hello, I'm interested in adding a feature to show javadoc.

- Is this a good idea? Should I start with a simpler feature to get my feet wet, is this already being worked on (etc)?
- Any tips for getting started with development (Other than [Contirbuting](https://github.com/Ruin0x11/intellij-lsp-server/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)) ?
  - What are the critical intellij/lsp functions to consider?
Hi there! Thanks for this very promising project, I love anything that gets me out of an IDE and back into Emacs! Your critique of eclim is spot on; it is both slow and finicky about project setup. The biggest differentiator to me at least is the ability to fix issues automatically. In eclim it is clunky and takes a crazy amount of time to apply the change, but it's still faster than checking the flycheck error and manually applying a fix. I would be happy to take a shot at implementing the functionality but all of this lsp stuff is so new to me I'm not sure how to begin. Any pointers? Thanks again!
When I open a Java file in emacs, which causes the client to connect to the IDE, the IDE is closed immediately so I'm not able to use the debugger. The auto-completion in Emacs works well so the IDE is still alive but the Window is gone. I can see the process in details view but it doesn't appear on the Apps in Processes view.
I was trying to implement the rename command, with a decent amount of success, until I found that you had a branch (rename) for it with some advancements on it.

Is that branch going somewhere or should I just submit a PR with my implementation?
Hi,

I was about to give it a try and see if I could make it work on phpstorm.

However when just cloning te project and running `./gradlew buildPlugin` I receive the following error:

```
Caused by: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 450
at org.jetbrains.org.objectweb.asm.ClassReader.readUnsignedShort(ClassReader.java:2464)
```

I havent used gradle before.
I think the project frame should not be hidden away from the user as a default. Some users might think it's a bug (I did until I found the toggleProjectFrame function).

This seems like an easy fix, if it were to be done. I can definitely submit a PR about this if needed.
A killer feature of Intellij is the ability for you see the implementation (by bytecode decoding, following included sources or even downloading sources). 

Have you put any thought on implementing this?
