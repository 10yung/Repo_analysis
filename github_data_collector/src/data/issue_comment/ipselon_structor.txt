hi，are you still maintain this project? will you consider upgrade the babel version and webpack version?

```
Steps to reproduce:
1. `npx create-react-app test`
2. `cd test`
3. `npm install structor`
4. `npm install -D cross-env`
5. Edit package.json as described in structor readme for integrating with create-react-app
6. `structor -v`
At this point If anyone has a sure fire way to get structor to run and be usable on Fedora 29 w/ node.js 10.14.1 I'd greatly appeciate the assistance. Ultimately I want to be able to simply select Run->Debug from the IntelliJ run menu without it being installed globally or otherwise to use it but have it in debug mode so any errors are easily detected, logged and therefore fixable with a pull request. 

Ideas?

After a fresh clone of master (https://github.com/ipselon/structor):

Install libpng-devel
Everything builds fine using npm run build-server/client/etc.
 
Attempts to run after installing globally - fail (missing file in hidden .structor folder files .. see below).
Attempts to install locally fail, ENOSELF .. obviously.

Just to verify that I can run the app outside of the IDE but not installed globally. when I attempted to run after a "yarn build-server" using the method shown here https://github.com/ipselon/structor/issues/58 I get many cannot find files located in: 

$HOME/<user>/<project_folder>/.structor/<bunch of js files it expects to find in this hidden folder>

Note: tried using the structor-starter repo but it emits errors <edit> .. was able to get a fork of the starter to run (https://github.com/ProphetDaniel/structor-starter).

Hi! i've started to use Structor but i've seen that there are no commits since months and still lot of issues to fix.

has this project been discontinued?
Hi,sir.  Sorry to bother you  and  May I have a question for you:   in the #Structor ,   I  can't  find you  how to  preview  the  react  element,  can you help me?  It's  used  the graphlib to  simulate?
 Thank you very very much, I  am  glad to get your message.
It shows below error repeatedly
