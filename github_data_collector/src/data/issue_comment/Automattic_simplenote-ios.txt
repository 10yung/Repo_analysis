Ref. #507 
@bummytime Thank yoooouuuu!!

### Test
- [ ] Verify the Unit Tests are green!

### Release
These changes do not require release notes.

### Details:
In this PR we're implementing **ResultsController**: a NSFetchedResultsController wrapper.

We're reusing WooCommerce's [ResultsController](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-ios/blob/develop/Yosemite/Yosemite/Tools/ResultsController.swift) + [ResultsController+UIKit](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-ios/blob/develop/WooCommerce/Classes/Tools/ResultsController+UIKit.swift) along with its [Unit Testing suite](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-ios/blob/develop/Yosemite/YosemiteTests/Tools/ResultsControllerTests.swift), with several key modifications, to make it Simplenote friendly.

Ref. #507

@bummytime **apologies about the size of the PR**. It's (most of it) proven code / production quality components, and **lots** of Unit Tests!!

### Testing:
ResultsController **is not integrated anywhere**, just yet. Please:

- [ ] Verify the new **ResultsControllerTests** are all green!

### Release Notes:
No release notes required.
### Details:
In this PR we're implementing **NotesListController**, in charge of encapsulating the NotesListViewController's datasource FSM.

With an API similar to **ResultsController**, it'll be in charge of wrapping access to the following entities:

- **Tags**
- **Notes**
- **Search History**

Initial FSM implementation consists of two states:

- **.results**: We're expected to render _just_ Notes
- **.searching(keyword: String)**: Expected to render Notes + Tags matching such keyword

In a follow up PR we'll add the **.history** state, which will allow us to deal with History entries.

cc @bummytime (Thank you sir!!)
Ref. #507

### Test:
Nothing has been wired yet. **But** we're making a really strong case for Unit Testing.... soooo please:

- [ ] Verify the Unit Tests are green

Thank you!!


### Release
These changes do not require release notes.

### Details:
Since now we'll filter Tags by name, in this PR we're updating NSPredicate extension(s) API, so that it's crystal clear when a method returns a NSPredicate for Notes (or else).

Plus we're adding a new extension method to filter Tags by name.

cc @bummytime (Thank you sir!!)

### Details:
In this PR we're implementing Unit Tests for the **UITableView+ResultsController** extension.

Everywhere the French word "Trash" is supposed to appear, (poubelle) it appears as "Trash-Noun" or "Trash-Verb"

### Expected
"Trash" should translate from English to French

### Observed
"Trash" remains in English as either "Trash-Noun" or "Trash-Verb"

### Reproduced
***(Required)*** If you cannot reproduce this bug consistently, please elaborate.  List the steps to reproduce the behavior.  For example:
> 1. Change Language on Device to French
> 2. Open Simplenote App
> 3. Anywhere Trash should be translated, it remains in English - the Menu is a quick place to check.

#user-report 2585745-zen

Currently, when no tags exist, the tags section is hidden in the navigation drawer. Let's add some hint text in place of it to indicate that tags will appear there.

- If no tags exist then hide "Edit" button
- If no tags exist then show hint text
