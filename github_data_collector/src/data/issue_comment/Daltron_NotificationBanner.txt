Hello, I have problems when adding to my project with Swift Package manager, it gives me the following error.

I hope you can help me.

It would be great to adjust the image size, as it is pretty small by default. This is already implemented for GrowingNotificationBanner.
Thanks for this great library!
When using a `rightView` the layout is broken, the view is shown but no text will be visible. Using `leftView` works fine, using both together breaks the layout again.
This can be reproduced in the example project.

It works when using a `FloatingNotificationBanner`.
Thanks for this library. I am asking basically what https://github.com/Daltron/NotificationBanner/issues/136 was asking (closed due to inactivity). Currently, there's no way to set the height for a custom view. I am aware of the `bannerHeight` method, but it's broken: if it's set the library no longer applies adjustments such as those for iOS 13 and for notch phones. As a result, it's very difficult to replicate the logic in GrowingNotificationBanner in a custom set up. (Functions needed to manually set the height are set as `internal`)
Just a thought on the case where a custom view is in charge of dismissing a banner.

The pseudo-code will look like the following:

```
let customView = CustomView()
    
let banner = Banner(customView: customView)
    
customView.onClose = {
    banner.dismiss()
}
    
banner.show()
```

Do you think there is another way to rewrite that? I don't like too much..
Got this error when trying add cornerRadius:
<CATransformLayer: 0x600000d5dea0> - changing property cornerRadius in transform-only layer, will have no effect
I encountered several banner position issues.
Seems like it happens when a new banner is triggered while the visible one is disappearing.
I was able to reproduce it with the sample App:

And if I set bottom, they sometimes appear on top.

Version 2.5.1 is working fine.
iPad orientation issue resolved.
In the project I'm working on, we're getting crashes related to `connectedScenes` on iOS 13 in v3.0.0.

`Fatal Exception: NSInvalidArgumentException
-[UIApplication connectedScenes]: unrecognized selector sent to instance`

I can't reproduce this, but we have over 800 crashes from this in the past week.

I've researched this property quite a bit, and researched how other libs handle this and it seems the same. I have no idea though why UIApplication can't find this method signature sometimes but it happens on iOS 13 only so it must be connected to this somehow.

If someone can point me in the right direction I'll be glad to help this get fixed.

Any thoughts?
