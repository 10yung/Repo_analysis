This fixes #651.

The default time for this preference is still 9 o'clock, like it was before. But now a user is able to change this time.
For example, this heading:

* Heading
:PROPERTIES:
  :Custom_ID: test
 :END:

The link for orgzly would be:
[[#test]]
But if it is in a differrent buffer, it doesn't work.
For orgmode it should be:
[[file:fileName.org::#test][Heading]

Is there a way to have links based on CUSTOM_ID working for both orgzly and orgmode?

Adding a yes-or-no question after a "cut" operation will make Orgzly more safe. Thanks.

- **after syncing back** an imported org file **all plain timestamps** get **deleted**
- I use them on every entry, far more often then SCHEDULED, yet they are **all gone**
- also: DEADLINE and SCHEDULED timestamps get indented by 2 blanks after syncing back, but that's a minor issue
- would be nice though when everything stays as it is/was when saving/syncing back
- other than that it's a lovely app and will become my most used on Android if it leaves my timestamps alone

- _specification_ (**EDIT**):
  - you have to hit the save button on any single entry once before syncing back
  - and it only effects plain timestamps being in one line with the DEADLINE/SCHEDULED timestamps (but in all entries, which can be annoying); all other timestamps (not in the same line) keep untouched
  - one can live with that (just make two lines as a workaround), but one has to know

(**2nd EDIT**) Own plain timestamps have to go after PROPERTIES drawer in Emacs, so that PROPERTIES get evaluated and nicely listed by the app, otherwise they show up as foldable drawer like any other in the content field of the entry.
Fixes #633 

Hello,
i wanted to add a simple window that shows diff between local notebook and remote one if a merge confict occurs (see issue). This is an early draft of what could it look like. I could find a way to display diff inside a window, could somebody help me with this?
What really grinds my gears with org and orgzly, is there's no default 1-liner command to simply list all tags on my note. I would like that to be created, because I want to put my brain resource on more important things rather than remembering the entire tags.

I have created an item scheduled for Jan 10, with a yearly recursion, say a birthday reminder.
I didn't act on this item at the scheduled date. On Jan 13 I look at the Agenda widget and there it appears as if the item was scheduled for today, with no hint that it is actually 3 days late. That is a first problem, overdue items should probably appear at the top of the list, showing them as scheduled for today is showing erroneous info.

But the worst is that this seems not just to be a problem linked to the representation of search results: I realized that the scheduled time of the item was actually silently modified, so for upcoming years it is now scheduled on Jan 13 every year. Something I only caught because I manually went to check if the + 1 year thing had worked correctly, else my agenda would have stayed corrupted without me realizing it.
Most notification sounds are not sufficient to wake someone from sleep. Many devices have a stock alarm clock app which might be adequate, but having the scheduling abilities of Orgzly would be better. It would be great if we could utilize stock alarm tones for certain notes, as well as use notification sounds for other notes. As far as I can tell, there isn't an option to set different notification sounds on a per-note basis so maybe I need to create a separate issue for that?

First, thank you for an extremely useful app -- I love it!

Is there any way to sync a single notebook? If so, I cannot find it. If I trigger a sync, for example by pulling down when viewing a certain notebook, all my notebooks are synced, which can take quite a while, since I have a large number of notebooks -- some of which change very often, and some very rarely.

I find it counter-intuitive that the pull-down sync trigger syncs not just the current notebook, but all of them. I wish there was some way to sync a single notebook, because that would be so much faster for me in most situations.
It would be nice to have another kind of home widget available: one that shows the contents of a notebook. Ideally it would allow fold/unfold.

Maybe clicking on one item could open the app and take you there. This widget would be mainly for reading, not for editing. It would be nice to me and the way I use orgzly.
