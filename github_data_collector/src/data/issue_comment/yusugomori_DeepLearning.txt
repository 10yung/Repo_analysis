How to evaluate the DBN (Scala) model? -i.e. I don't see any way to compute performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1 measure etc. 
### Multi-hidden-layers MLP

The original MLP only has one-hidden-layer.  I just Modify it to support a multi-hidden-layer in an easy way. You just need to tell MLP the hidden size in a python list. It is very convenient to experiment in multi-layers.

In the end of the file, I made a MLP with three-hidden-layers, and the test passed.
```python
[[  5.17868684e-05   9.99948213e-01]
 [  9.99878554e-01   1.21445770e-04]
 [  9.99889287e-01   1.10712980e-04]
 [  1.34578242e-04   9.99865422e-01]]
```
Also, I don't know whether the owner still watch this project, but I am great interested in making the project better by implementing some other features, such as CNN,RNN, Momentum/Sgd_momentum/Adam/RmsProp etc. 

Plz Let Me know if you allow me to do this. I'm very glad to hear from you.Thank you. @yusugomori 
While changing from debug mode to release in Visual Studio makes the correct result. So where is the problem?
Hi,
I am trying to feed in a dataset with about 8000 instances (8391x8), but it gets an exception in LogisticRegression.train function computing  d_y = self.y - p_y_given_x; 
the error is 
ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (8391,2) (8,2)
I suppose using CDBN/CRBM classes we can do a prediction like regression but I don't know why the p_y_given_x size is not matching self.y which suppose to do. 
Also I am using python.

thanks in advance 

can I save the model of DBN?
can I save it using pickle?
