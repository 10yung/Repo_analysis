I have refactored a bit of the content of the project to disable the warnings. I have also made the necessary change to convert the project to now support Swift 5.
- Fixed Build issue on Xcode 11.2.1 and updated the deprecated APIs
- Next PR: Resizeable TextView Alert with Placeholder. 
Hi! Update pls to swift 5!
Updated to swift 5 and added pod by name AlertsAndPickers
I hope this lib can support Objective-C üëç 
Please is this project still being maintained?
Some of my values in the picker got too much text to fit in 1 line and i cant find a solution to fix it with this package. Any help would be nice.
