- I have added Urdu language translations for time ago
Xcode shows two errors in my code but the app is still running
how I can solve it or remove these errors

extractLocStrings: error: bad entry in file /Users/marahhamad/Desktop/linc_ios/Pods/DateToolsSwift/DateToolsSwift/DateTools/Date+TimeAgo.swift (line = 242): Argument is not a literal string.


I cannot figure this out at all. I'm needing this as my last push to use SwiftPM to house my data layer of my app. Please help
`.package(url: "https://github.com/MatthewYork/DateTools", from: "4.0.0")`
Does not work

Fix the issue with SwiftPM setup and add auto generated files to `.gitignore`
No major changes here, just reducing the number of warnings that the code generates when you build with Xcode. Except the two that are related to `var` to `let` conversion, the rest are removing `public` from all methods inside `public extensions`
The implementation of timeAgo() first checks years, then months, then days, etc. This results in a situation where times jump from a few minutes ago to a full day ago. For example, say it's currently 00:25, and you're looking at a time 24 minutes ago. You get, as you would expect, "24 minutes ago". But if you look at a time 26 minutes ago, you get "1 day ago," which is arguably not what you want.

Instead, you want seconds ago to grow to minutes ago to grow to hours ago to grow to days ago, etc.
It looks like Apple has a private `NSDate` category named `RTExtensions` that also has a `weekday` method, which returns values greater than 7.
I think this is a typo

This PR fixed the warnings that are generated with Xcode10.2
Redundant declaration of public when extension are public.

Resolves the warnings for SwiftExample sample project to migrate to Swift 4.2 and remove `SWIFT_SWIFT3_OBJC_INFERENCE`.

What this PR doesn't fix is the localization warnings for generated in Xcode10.2.
