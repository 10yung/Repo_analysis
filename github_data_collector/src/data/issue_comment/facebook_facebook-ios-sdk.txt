## Pull Request Details

Quick fix for callbacks on iOS 13. 

**Cause:**
Basically we were not accounting for the fact that source application is no longer shared on iOS 13 for applications that are from different application security groups.
See: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/119118

**Follow-up**
We need to add back the sanity checks that are being bypassed by this fix. It seemed more important to get the fix out quickly.

Also need to update the documentation to include instructions for adding code to invoke FBSDKApplicationDelegate from `SceneDelegate`'s openURL method.

This should fix: 
#1090 
#1144 

## Test Plan

Test Plan: With the native app installed, build and check that the delegates are invokes correctly for a simulator / device running 11 and 13. Both Should work. Make sure that the sample app includes the `SceneDelegate` code:
```
@available(iOS 13.0, *)
func scene(_ scene: UIScene, openURLContexts URLContexts: Set<UIOpenURLContext>) {
    guard let urlContext = URLContexts.first else { return }

    ApplicationDelegate.shared.application(
        UIApplication.shared,
        open: urlContext.url,
        sourceApplication: urlContext.options.sourceApplication,
        annotation: urlContext.options.annotation
    )
}
```

## Environment

Describe your dev environment here, giving as many details as possible. If you have them, make sure to include:

- Xcode Version: `11.3`
- Swift Version: `4` (if issue is Swift related)
- Installation Platform & Verison: `Cocoapods` version `1.8.4`

## Goals

What do you want to achieve?
Opt out like in earlier versions via `SDKSettings.limitedEventAndDataUsage = true`

## Expected Results

What do you expect to happen?
A method or field which allows me to set opt out

## Actual Results

What actually happened? Can you provide a stack trace?
The `SDKSettings` class is not available anymore

## Steps to Reproduce

What are the steps necessary to reproduce this issue?
I updated my `FacebookCore` pod from `0.3.1` to `0.9.0`. As this has a dependency to FBSDKCoreKit, this also got updated from `4.33` to `5.13.1` automatically.

## Code Samples & Details

Please provide a code sample, as well as any additional details, to help us track down the issue. If you can provide a link to a test project that allows us to reproduce the issue, this helps us immensely in both the speed and quality of the fix.
In my responsible class I import the SDK, but I have no method or field I can use to opt out like in the earlier version:

```swift
import FacebookCore

class MyClass {
    func optOut() {
        SDKSettings.limitedEventAndDataUsage = false
    }
}
```
Here, `SDKSettings` is not available anymore. I'm sure there is just another method available for this, but I was unable to find it in the docs.

Describe your dev environment here, giving as many details as possible. If you have them, make sure to include:

- Xcode Version: `11.3`
- Swift Version: `5.2` (if issue is Swift related)
- Installation Platform & Verison: `[Cocoapods|Carthage|Manual]` version `X.X.X`

## Goals

What do you want to achieve?

## Expected Results

What do you expect to happen?
it should open facebook application
## Actual Results

What actually happened? Can you provide a stack trace?

we have an application "RSVPify" install on iOS devices. when  we click on open facebook app it will drag me to  "RSVPify" that application and facebook not opened at all. can you please fix this in iOS sdk
## Steps to Reproduce

What are the steps necessary to reproduce this issue?
