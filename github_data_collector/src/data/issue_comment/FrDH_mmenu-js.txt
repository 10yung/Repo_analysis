I just inherited this site to maintain www.apo.co.nz and the menu works fine except on iOS iPhones where opening the menu causes the tab to crash.

This behavior is the same on safari and chrome on the iPhone.

I think it might be to do with the amount of CSS Transforms, but haven't been able to resolve it by modifying the style sheets.

Any help would be appreciated.

I'm currently using the mmenu WP plugin in a Bootstrap site where the navbar has the class 'sticky-top'  and I'm also adding a 'transition: all .2s ease-out;' for some animation fx when scrolling. But the navbar gets really jumpy on menu open/close with this CSS transition on it. Removing this fixes it, but I rather keep the smooth CSS transition. Any tips? Thanks.
PS. Let me know if you'd like to see an example, the site is currently in dev so no public URL. 
I had some challenges integrating mmenu (which I wanted at all costs) and angular translation using the pascal-precht module.

1. The iconbar is created dynamically, any angular (translation or variables) directives are not compiled by angular, for example: `"<a href=\'Sitemap.php?lng={{LANG}}\'><i class=\'fas fa-sitemap\'></i></a>"`
2. The submenu title bar shows the translation directive and not the translated content, for example MENU.ITEM, where the main menu will be translated as expected

I solved point 2 eventually with a workaround:

`$("a.mm-navbar__title>span").each(function() { var text = $( this ).text(); $( this ).html( "{{\'"+text+"\' | translate}}" ); });`

and both points are solved by inserting a compile statement after menu creation:

```
var elem = angular.element($("nav.mm-menu")); var injector = elem.injector(); scope = elem.scope();
scope.$apply(function() {injector.invoke(["$compile",function($compile) {$compile(elem)(scope);}]);});
```

Issue 1 the only way to work around is the compile after menu creation
Issue 2 is another point and has to do with the content of the DOM element (in this case {{ "MENU.ITEM" | translate }} ) being copied to the span at creation time which removes the angular notation with brackets (resulting in MENU.ITEM) . 

But maybe someone has a better solution to this.

I see and use bind to call a function on close.

   var api = $("#my-menu").data( "mmenu" );
       api.bind( "close:finish", function() {
          console.log( "Finished closing panel: ");
       });

yet i  can not seem to get it to unbind or be replaced. 
looked everywhere and could not find a solution. 
please advice.

thanks

Hi!
I am immensely grateful for your work! 
I'm from Russia, I'm sorry for the mistakes!

The requests of seo-specialists are senseless and merciless) The essence of the problem.

They want the parent section to have a link in the source code, but there is no transition on it as if there was a "span".

That is, by clicking go to the subsection. (e.g. # menu_ul_660) https://prnt.sc/qa8wyb
All in order to open a section in a new tab when right-clicking. And hover https://prnt.sc/qa9ijh. 

I found an example - https://jsfiddle.net/djlerman/3zs1mo3x/ 

I'm use jquery-2.1.3. My code https://prnt.sc/qa97c4
I tried to repeat the example, but the openPanel function throws an error
https://prnt.sc/qa98yv
How to fix it?
If this problem is would resolved, I'm going to simulate a click on the arrow when I click on the link

What do you think?
Thanks for the help!!

With mmenu open AND the list of menu items is long enough for the menu to scroll, if you touch on a menu item (for example dead center horizontally), hold and drag to the left, the main body content of the web page will slide over with your drag (the overlay stays in place).  Tested on iOS Safari and Chrome.  This does not happen if the list of menu items is not long enough to scroll.

This happens on the main mmenu home page as well as in our website (using v8.4.0).

Hello ...
Maybe there is already solution, I searched in issues (current/finished) but no luck.

Is there way on 2nd lvl or submenu opened on right to be added button which will bring menu on start point, without closing? see pic below.

Thanks in advance! Plugin ROCKs!

I have a page with mmenu on the left, a topbar and a css-grid beneath that.

The topbar is set to width 100%.

When minimizing mmenu, the topbar does not reflow properly. When the page loads, the right end of the bar is rendered off the viewport with exactly the width of mmenu. Chromium renders the bar correct on load, but after closing and opening mmenu, it isn't stretched 100% across anymore, but is short by exactly the width of mmenu.

This means that when mmenu is minimized, not all elements on the page reflow properly.

Here screenshots of the Chromium problem:

On load:

After minimizing mmenu

And the same for Firefox:

On load (I pasted the horizontal scrollbar in to show the overflow):

After minimizing mmenu (note also the missing icon on the right):

What can be the issue?
I have three level menu with first two level sliding but the thrid level is a vertical submenu and opens under the level 2, but In Mmenu when I try to expand the level 3 submenu it slides from right to left. Please provide a fix.
Adding dynamic content to angular project will not re-init panels.
Tried  initPanel and initPanels([]) both.
Will you please provide any link to do so.
