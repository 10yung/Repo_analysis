I don't see any activity for the last 6 months in the repo. Is v0.4 being worked on? Any idea when it will be out (and working with Linux/Swift 3) ?

This is a great project and very needed - I'd be interested if you need help

When I render a view and call some async API how do I update that view? I could not find any reload/refresh methods in the docs. For example:

``` swift
app.get("/home") { request in
    HomeController().fetchData { posts in  
       // Update view with response 
    }
    return HomeController.index("/home")
}
```

BrightFutures is interesting, but some of the notation seems a little clunky to me. Thanks!

On Ubuntu, libpthread-workqueue-dev is also needed.

This logo uses same font as express.js does. The gradient uses the same color scheme as the Swift logo does. Readme is tidied up a bit as well making this project more approachable. 


The express does not build on Linux nor Mac OS X using the latest Swift Development snapshots (2.2 or 3.0).
Also the SPM build does not work either with the provided Package.swift file.

I wonder if it's possible to deploy Swift-Express based app to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). I have seen some people trying to do so using [Vapor](https://github.com/qutheory/vapor), and they [succeeded](https://github.com/LoganWright/swift-server-io). It would be nice if someone provide a tutorial for Swift-Express.
