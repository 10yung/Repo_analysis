i have created toolbar with flip view but its not displaying  
While flipping page content flash and changed by wrong index. After flash page's right content will appear. Also page index is wrong in TravelAdapter while flip back. I'm using Async for fetaching data from url and then show into the pages. Have you any solution?  
I am trying to add refresh call for new data but can't able to find first page drag listener or pull refresh like.
I'm a facing a strange issue in FlipCards. Only for first two cards, as you scroll back , it shows the content of the card behind it for few seconds. I tried doing some hit and trail methods, but none of them worked. I'm really not getting, why this is happening only for first two cards. Please suggest

I'm trying to use an image in .png, but when I flip the background is white, what should I do?

How can I create a control back and forth the pages (in effect) using buttons?

How to use the library to Flip forward and backwards on Button Clicks instead of gestures?
