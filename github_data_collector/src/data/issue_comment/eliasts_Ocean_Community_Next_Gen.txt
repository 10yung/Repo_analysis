Hi

I'm trying out ocean_community on webgl, but encouter a few errors in the browser console. What is the status of getting it to work on WebGL? Should it be possible or is it a dead end for now? 


I noticed just recently that the ocean reflections flicker in the Ocean_with_ships_island. I'm not sure why but it only seems to happen in that scene.
-I only have one camera in the scene
-The reflections often lag behind when the camera moves quickly
-The reflections jump and skip when the camera is stationary.
-With reflections turned off (refraction turned on) there is still some flickering
I run that scene but it looks like the pic below

I use Unity2018.3.7f1 and MacOS 10.14.3
I am trying to create halo to my lights but they are not rendered when the background is the ocean.
Is there something that I can do?

Particularly noticeable when head is tilted sideways.

Any ideas?
Hi! I'm using Unity 2018.1.6 and working with two Cameras in one Scene. I noticed the Ocean's mesh kept flashing/flickering on the Camera with a lower Depth value (ex: -10) when compared to the other Camera on top which has a higher Depth value (ex: 10) that looks normal. Both Cameras uses Unity's Post Processing Stack v1 and removing them doesn't make a difference. I've also tried changing the GameObject I specified in the "Follow" field and even removed it but the problem persists. Has Ocean been tested using 2 Cameras at least and would you have any solution to this issue?
Hi there,

I'm using your ocean in one of my project. Everything works really well in the Editor of Unity 2018. However, when I built the project. It crashes every time a new scene is loaded after the scene with ocean. Will you have a future update or anyway to fix this? I tried to downgrade my project but everything else other than the ocean was a disaster. Would really appreciate, if there is anyway I can have this ocean run in 2018. Thank you
