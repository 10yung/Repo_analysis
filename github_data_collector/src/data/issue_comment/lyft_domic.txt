Please see this conversation: https://github.com/lyft/domic/pull/33#discussion_r212858051
Tested with `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`
It should do same stuff differently so we could profile it (systrace, etc) and compare implementations, right now I just modify sample app and profile that.

Right now I'm thinking about at least 4 options:

- Render changes directly on main thread
- Render changes that were computed off main thread and then posted to main thread
- Render changes that were computed on main thread with Domic 
- Render changes that were computed off main thread with Domic 
That'll reduce overhead of switchMap.
Since we pipe all changes through our model, we can expose API that can let user capture and apply captured state.

That can be helpful for state save/restore, reproducing UI from bug reports, etc.
