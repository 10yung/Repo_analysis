Hello,

Found strange component behavior when using Cleave.js date input and datePattern is bound to state.

I have a dynamic calendar with Cleave.js input. Depending on my tree selections, calendar show days or months and I'm changing datePattern value in state expecting that Cleave input will see changes (by react vision, components should be dynamic, dependent on state changes).

Here is JsFiddle expamle:
[https://jsfiddle.net/kwdmg9cn/](https://jsfiddle.net/kwdmg9cn/)

Eg. with whole options object bound to state: [https://jsfiddle.net/185ujqwo/](https://jsfiddle.net/185ujqwo/)

As you can see, placeholder is working dynamically, but datePattern not.

Valid to Cleave.js versions from 1.4.10 to 1.5.3
I'm trying to write a number which has to look like this $ 155.324.322,17
There is a numeralDecimarMark option, but I can't find a numeralThousandsMark option. 
Is there a way to do it?

Cutting text (Ctrl+X) from an ordinary readonly `input` element does not remove the text.

With Cleave however, selecting the entire content of a readonly `input` element and pressing Ctrl+X removes the text.

Please check the readonly property of the element before calling `this.onInput('');` in function `onCut`:
```
onCut: function (e) {
    if (!Cleave.Util.checkFullSelection(this.element.value)) return;
    this.copyClipboardData(e);
    if (!this.element.readonly) {
        this.onInput('');
    }
},
```
When **phone: true** it is possible to use only one delimiter to format like that **+7-123-456-78-99**
But it is not possible to define delimiters array to format phone number like that **+7 (123) 456-78-99**
So this code is not working
```
              phone: true,
              phoneRegionCode: 'RU',
              prefix: '+7',
              blocks: [2, 3, 3, 2, 2],
              delimiters: [' (', ') ', '-', '-']
```

Possible to adjust?
According to documentation - I have been trying to integrate cleave.js using TypeScript.

But I am ended up with following issue -

> Import assignment cannot be used when targeting ECMAScript modules. Consider using 'import * as ns from "mod"', 'import {a} from "mod"', 'import d from "mod"', or another module format instead.

I tried with all possible StackOverflow solutions for that but could not solve it.

So, I came back from `@types/cleave.js` and tried with accessing `Cleave` module default function. Even though I am passing native element to Cleave first parameter, but it is `undefined` -

```
import Cleave from 'cleave.js';
import 'cleave.js/dist/addons/cleave-phone.i18n.js';

ngAfterViewInit() {
  let domElement = this.phoneNumber.nativeElement as HTMLElement;
  console.log('domElement', domElement); ---> the element is there
  let cleave = Cleave(domElement, {
    phone: true,
    phoneRegionCode: 'BR'
  });
}
```

What can be the issue on above code? Or it would be highly appreciated if there is working solution for integrating cleave.js in Angular 7.
Any chance of getting a feature where the formatting would be applied also from the 'change' event? I would like this to work:
```js
element.value = 'ABCD';
element.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('change', { bubbles: true }));
```




The phone formatter for region GB is broken. These are the errors that appear in my console:
```
cleave-phone.gb.js:51 Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /[+锛媇+/: Unterminated character class
    at RegExp (<anonymous>)
    at cleave-phone.gb.js:51
    at cleave-phone.gb.js:51

    at init (cleave.min.js:8)
    at new i (cleave.min.js:8)
    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (summary:434)
```

If I include `phone-type-formatter.gb.js` I still receive:
```
cleave-phone.gb.js:51 Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /[+锛媇+/: Unterminated character class
    at RegExp (<anonymous>)
    at cleave-phone.gb.js:51
    at cleave-phone.gb.js:51
```

I tried switching to a couple of other regions and those work fine.

The error is reproducible even on [the demo site](https://nosir.github.io/cleave.js/), just select region code GB and the numbers won't get formatted.
Add an instance method `modify` on class `Cleave` to allow for changing of properties on the object after it is first created.
I am trying to mask a US SSN by using prefix. It strips the actual value.

The last version that works is 1.4.7, which indicates https://github.com/nosir/cleave.js/pull/440 caused the bug

Hi,

I wanted to know if it was possible to choose the type of content in each block (letters, numbers or both) ?

In the same principle as the "delimiters": `['0-9', 'A-Z', '0-9&&A-Z']`

Thanks!
