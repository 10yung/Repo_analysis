For some reason, In one specific scene, the light just goes like "yeah, i'm not gonna be volumetric" and just fails, leaving a shitstain of disappointment on my entire project, Thinking it my be a problem with my version of unity, i opened an example script and it worked fine. i did literally the exact same things as in the example, and it still doesn't want to work.

edit: oops i fixed it. the range of the light was too goddamn bigg.
It's quite confusing that the asset package has no problem, it runs well both in unity editor and 
built application.
But when I import the asset to my own project, everything seems ok in unity editor,
then I built a  PC package.
All volumetric light effects disappeared.
I think maybe there is something wrong with my settings in unity.
I'm using 2018.3.9
```
[Error] Invalid pass number (2) for Graphics.Blit (Material "Hidden/BilateralBlur" with 1 passes)
VolumetricLightRenderer.OnRenderImage()    Assets/Plugins/VolumetricLightsSlightltyMad/VolumetricLightRenderer.cs:345
344:   // horizontal bilateral blur at half res
-->345:   Graphics.Blit(_halfVolumeLightTexture, temp, _bilateralBlurMaterial, 2);
347:   // vertical bilateral blur at half res
```
Like the title says, if you're using orthographic projection to achieve an isometric look, even if you update the projection matrix in the code, nothing will be rendered to the render texture unless the near clipping plane is an extreme negative value.

This issue can be observed in the example scene.
I tested it on Mac OS Metal with Unity2018.1.4f1 and on Windows with Unity 2018.1.5f1
Hi. I have used your asset in the development of my game since Unity 5.4. Now, I am moving to HD Render Pipeline, and I can't get your asset working. 
What should I do?
Thanks. 
So lets say I have a point light or spot light somewhere with a volumetric light.
This light will have a shadow strength of something less than 1, let's say 0.7;
Now I add a second light with a volumetric light. This one will have a strength of 1.
The second light's volumetric shadow now behaves like it has the shadow strength of the first one.

Also changing the strength of the first light now affects both volumetric lights.
So basically the volumetric lights take the lowest shadow strength of all volumetric lights that are available and uses it for all volumetric shadows in the players view.
It happens with both spot lights and point lights.

Objects turn dark when they are at the opposite side of the light source.

Here's everything looking fine (the light source is pointing at the camera):

The building is lit perfectly, but the terrain in the background is darkened (the camera is turned 180 degrees):

If we get farther from the building, we see it turning black:

This is how everything should be lit. No dark areas or shadows.

As the title says no error no warning but doesn't work anymore
Also using Lightweight render pipeline. Might be the issue.

Using the lightweight render pipeline 1.1.2 installed from the package manager is confirmed the issue.
I don't know what's wrong there is no warning or error but the lights are for sure non volumetric now.
Hi again :)
Lights seem to not render in some of the newer macOS versions at all, is this a known issue?
