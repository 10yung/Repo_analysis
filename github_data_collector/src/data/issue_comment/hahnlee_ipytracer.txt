In versions less than 1.1.0, Tracer.py only support list data type. We want to support a data type that is not default in Python(such as tree). The goal of tracer.py is 'easy to use library for those who are learning programming for the first time'. Therefore, We will design carefully.
Now this is the way `data = _data[:]`, but it would be better to inherit traitlets and use it.
