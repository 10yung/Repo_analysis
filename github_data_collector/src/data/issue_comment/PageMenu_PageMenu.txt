in func scrollViewWillEndDragging(_ scrollView: UIScrollView, withVelocity velocity: CGPoint, targetContentOffset: UnsafeMutablePointer<CGPoint>) showing menu height on scroll down.  
And hidesBarsOnSwipe is also not working.
I have fixed the issue while integrating the page menu in swift 5. Please check and update it to swift 5.
There are three menu items in a page, when I click on a menu item the content for the menu item appears but the menu item doesn't move ( The indicator for the menu item i.e. the horizontal bar below the menu item). It happens most of time. Sometimes it works as expected.

I am attaching two images. First image is for initial when there is no movement. Second image is for when the second menu item is selected. The selector remains in the first menu item.

Please help. Thanks in advance.

There is a gap at the top of tableview of the  first view controller for the first time. But the there is no gap for the contenview of the view controller. 

When I press the other option and come back at the first option then there is no gap at the top.

I am attaching the screenshots, the orange colour is the tableview. You can see there is a gap for the first time but when I come back there is no gap.

I want to remove the gap for the first time.

Can you please help?

Thanks in advance.
