For the carousel indicators, the navbar toggler and the upcoming stand alone accordion components it would be handy to switch from svg background images to inline SVGs. This way we'll have more control over hover states and we could save some file size in our generated CSS.

Maybe we should switch to SVG for the close button to, this will make it easier to theme the focus state (see https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/27163)

In https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/29152, I tried combining too many things in one PR.

In this PR I just enabled the possibility to use RFS in the utility API. We 'll' see how we'll deal with the responsive font size and responsive spacing classes afterwards.
Closes #25410 (Codepen with bug present in issue)

Tested this in Codepen: https://codepen.io/jensluyten/pen/povxyPe. 
The `min-width: 0;` on the `.col` actually prevents the col from taking up the entire row space.

This was only an issue on the default cols, because specified cols have a fixed `flex-basis` property that prevents this issue from happening.
Closes #29989

Updated the docs pages by searching for the `.rounded` classes and replacing them by the new `.border-radius` classes.

Instead of setting a background color on the tr tag, we set the background-color on the th or td tags below the tr tag. This way we can set the correct background-color for the th and td tags that also have color variant class (table-primary, table-secondary, ..)

closes #28160
when installing bootstrap.sass into ASP.NET Core 3.1 project, the sass files are not added to the project.


The reason is described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59712339/475727): 
> package authors should use contentFiles element instead of old content element when creating packages.
> The author do include those files in the contentFiles folder when generating nuget packages. However, he also need to specify the contentFiles element in xx.nuspec file like this [issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34031650/nuspec-contentfiles-example). Only one folder whose name is contentFiles in xx.nupkg is not enough if we want to access those files in VS Solution Explorer

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create default asp.net core project with either CLI or Visual Studio
   `dotnet new webapp`
2. cd web-app
3. Install-Package bootstrap.sass

- .NET Core 3.1
- Operating system and version Win10
- Visual Studio 16.4 (optional)

Fixes #29361

- [x] Contrast colors are added to theme-colors.
- [x] Instances with old code are replaced to `text-{{ .contrast_color }}`

Closes #29987
This adds a standalone accordion component with its own settings and markup.

Preview: https://deploy-preview-30042--twbs-bootstrap.netlify.com/docs/4.3/components/accordion/

Also added a **[flush](https://deploy-preview-30042--twbs-bootstrap.netlify.com/docs/4.3/components/accordion/#accordion-flush-example)** and **[striped](https://deploy-preview-30042--twbs-bootstrap.netlify.com/docs/4.3/components/accordion/#accordion-striped-example)** variation.

Closes #30015 

Fixes #28134 by moving the border bottom from the header to a border top on the body we fix the overlapping issue where the border would be invisible if the body had a background color. This also allowed me to also remove the `overflow: hidden;` on the `.accordion-item` which fixes #28873

Also fixes #25811

Currently this is still a work in progress.
- [x] Add active state
- [x] Add focus state
- [x] Add icon based on collapsed state
- [ ] Double check design
- [ ] Double check code
- [ ] Check if all conditions described in https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#accordion are met
- [ ] If these conditions are met, check if https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/site/content/docs/4.3/components/collapse.md#L130 is still relevant
