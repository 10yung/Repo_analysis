On mobile, I find that editing comments is a better experience than creating a new comment. I will often create a comment, submit, then edit immediately afterwards to get some features that only edit has.

Some examples:
edit can insert a newline without submitting (useful for paragraphs and code snippets)
edit can scroll (useful for long comments and to reference previous comments)

However, editing retains the send button and text input from the create new comment, which is confusing and takes up screen real estate. And you can edit multiple comments at the same time.

My preference would be a single style of commenting that retains all the best from both "modes".

<p><strong>High severity vulnerability that affects handlebars</strong>
Versions of handlebars prior to 4.3.0 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution leading to Remote Code Execution. Templates may alter an Object's <strong>proto</strong> and <strong>defineGetter</strong> properties, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code through crafted payloads.</p>

- [ ] Question (these will be auto-closed, please ask them on Spectrum instead https://spectrum.chat/spectrum/open)

**Description (type any text below)**

While debugging a bit the [Spectrum site](https://spectrum.chat/) directly (without running it locally) I've encountered a bug in the *Javascript console*, related with **Amplitude**.

When everything gets rendered, it appears to be an issue while performing a *POST request* against *https://api.amplitude.com*:

`POST https://api.amplitude.com/ 400`

The Network response is basically:

`invalid_api_key`

Probably [this API Key](https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum/blob/181cf90f8d1c49aeb97f0dbb80359daa0a1343a3/analytics/utils/amplitude.js#L8) is wrong?

> 
> 
> ### BREAKING CHANGES
> 
> * Prior to version 10, tasks had to manually include `git add` as the final step. This behavior has been integrated into lint-staged itself in order to prevent race conditions with multiple tasks editing the same files. If lint-staged detects `git add` in task configurations, it will show a warning in the console. Please remove `git add` from your configuration after upgrading.

Bumps [serialize-javascript](https://github.com/yahoo/serialize-javascript) from 1.7.0 to 2.1.1. **This update includes a security fix.**
<details>
<summary>Vulnerabilities fixed</summary>

*Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.*

> **Moderate severity vulnerability that affects serialize-javascript**
> ## regular expressions Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
> 
> ### Impact
> 
> Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). It does not properly mitigate against unsafe characters in serialized regular expressions.
> 
> This vulnerability is not affected on Node.js environment since Node.js's implementation of `RegExp.prototype.toString()` backslash-escapes all forward slashes in regular expressions.
> 
> If serialized data of regular expression objects are used in an environment other than Node.js, it is affected by this vulnerability.
> 
> ### Patches
> 
> This was patched in v2.1.1.
> 
> Affected versions: < 2.1.1

> **Man-in-the-Middle**
> [https-proxy-agent] Socket returned without TLS upgrade on non-200 CONNECT response, allowing request data to be sent over unencrypted connection
> 
> Affected versions: <2.2.3

*Sourced from [The npm Advisory Database](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/300.html).*

> **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**
> Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM). When targeting a HTTP proxy, https-proxy-agent opens a socket to the proxy, and sends the proxy server a CONNECT request. If the proxy server responds with something other than a HTTP response 200, https-proxy-agent incorrectly returns the socket without any TLS upgrade. This request data may contain basic auth credentials or other secrets, is sent over an unencrypted connection. A suitably positioned attacker could steal these secrets and impersonate the client.

**Description (type any text below)** -->

Hi, I began to use Spectrum 1 week ago, I noticed that page is jumping while loading. I think it is the problem with rehydration: SSR => browser content is another => white screen => render from scratch.

I fixed similar issues, can help fix it, if it is a problem with rehydration.

Like this ‚Äì¬†https://spectrum.chat/zeit/now/app-root-on-serverless-environment~6932a8c0-cf85-42ed-abff-0108445c5db9

Every time I realised page it just shows it‚Äôs disconnected and reconnecting and this is not my first encounter with this issue I have noticed it multiple times at my workplace as well

I noticed that when I tried first time it got minor flickering after page was rendered, might be SSR rehydration issue of some kind, it‚Äôs not limited to iPad but to chrome as well.

p.s. I don‚Äôt have really fast connection and I‚Äôm at India Bangalore might be edge issue
