readme says:
>[Windows Vista / 7 only] requires .NET Framework 4.5.1 (Currently not installed automatically by this package)

but actually it requires  `.NET Framework 4.6` :

windows 7 64bit sp1

Current status - waiting for `windows-build-tools` to install. I've been waiting for over an hour. No information in the console as to what is actually going on. It's only by opening resource monitor that I can tell something is downloading. 

It'd be pretty useful to be able to see WTF is happening and roughly how long one will be waiting, I'm about to give up and boot into Linux.
So..... yeah. Don't install this unless you saved all your documents.
Nice.

Hello, 
we are currently trying to do a pure offline installation of the Windows build tools. 
Over npm install -g windows-build-Tools --offline-installers="C:\Users\John\installers .
Unfortunately, this does not work. 
See log file. 
What can we do?

The installation stays at this line for 2 hours already. Any advise? 
P.S. I am on window 10 and the PowerShell is run as administrator.
error: read ECONNREST at TLSWrap.onStreamRead(internal/stream_base_common.js:111.27)
When installing the program via PowerShell everything goes good until "Successfully installed Python 2.7" then it just pauses and does absolutely nothing. No error message, everything was good until that. My guess is that it couldn't find my vs components or something like that. Plz fix, I want to be able to install node-opus but now I can't cuz some stupid error.

Windows 10

Node 8

"Still waiting for installer log file...", even tho I already have VS with C++ so it should skip...
I run the "npm install --global --production windows-build-tool" and installation got stuck after "Successfully installed Python 2.7" (almost 2 hours)

And no log file for studio build tools in ".windows-build-tools" folder

It installed some programs related to Visual Studio (control panel screenshot below)

Any idea how to fix this? Thanks
