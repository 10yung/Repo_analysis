# Problem

I would like to update our projects at work to Scala 2.13 but `twitter-server` is one of the missing dependencies and this made me sad. In order to not be sad anymore I want to do the update myself. ðŸ™‚

# Solution

After adding the `2.13.1` version to the build I ran into a couple of compile-errors. I mostly replaced `mutable.MutableList` with `mutable.ArrayBuffer` and used `.toSeq` and `.toList` where needed to make the code compatible with 2.11, 2.12, and 2.13.

There were a few failing tests with 2 main causes:
- The usage of `.mapValues` on a Map produces a lazy collection prior to 2.13 and a `MapView` in 2.13. The latter is serialized incorrectly by Jackson which can be fixed by a call to `.toMap` after `.mapValues`. I only found one occurrence in the whole project, so I opted for the local fix instead of a more general solution.
- Several tests rely on the ordering of HashMaps in the test-code. This is already documented as a bad idea and because of the scala collection rework in 2.13 some tests started to fail only for 2.13. In these cases I wrote an assertion which first deserializes the json string using Jackson and compares what Jackson produces. This seems to work.

I tried to keep the changes minimal without really changing the semantic and style of the code (for example I would not use mutable collections so freely, but I kept it as is). I also only refactored the tests that failed instead of the whole test suite.

I hope this helps ðŸŽ‰
