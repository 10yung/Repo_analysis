hello, while trying to load a diff, I get this into the error message area: 
`Reading commit diff cli output failed: bufio.Scanner: token too long `  

ubuntu 19.10 
GRV version: 
RV - Git Repository Viewer v0.3.2-5-gcffa246 (compiled with go1.11.13 at 2019-10-30 13:21:03 UTC)
git version 2.20.1

The ability to drill down from one view to the other is what allowed me to migrate from VScode's Git integration to GRV.  One of the very few missing pieces would be a blame view.  Sure, one can `git blame` on the command line, but doing so within GRV could allow clicking on a commit to go directly to its diff view; something which requires copy&pasting commit numbers with vanilla Git.
Hi foiks,

I can't get to open a bare repository (with no working copy).
I always this error :  `FATAL: Unable to initialise grv: Unable to find a git repository in . or any of its parent directories`

In the same directory, all git commands are working correctly.
How can you use an url for the repoFilePath (or equivalent) 

Our projects are on a server : http://ip.ip.ip.ip:8080/

Where ip stands for an ip address component for exemple : 10.102.22.44

When gvr starts, the `Refs` is always the focused view, but most of time I use "Commits for branch` view directly. so I have to `Tab` a few times to switch to it.

So providing a setting that I can choose which view to focus when grv starts is better.

I don't know whether this is my own problem, but `<S-Tab>` key dones't work as expected, it doesn't call `<grv-prev-view>` which is the default binding according to https://github.com/rgburke/grv/blob/master/doc/documentation.md, even I put the following line into `grvrc`

~~~
map All <S-Tab> <grv-prev-view>
~~~
I tried 
~~~
map All <Esc> q
map All <Escape> q
map All Escape q
map All Esc q
map All <ESC> <grv-remove-view>
map All <Escape> <grv-remove-view>
map All Escape <grv-remove-view>
map All Esc <grv-remove-view>
~~~

All of them don't work.
There are two main issues I'm submitting here, both to do with how the display changes with interaction.

As a demonstration, please see[ the imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/4Qhf2LT) with two gifs.

### Highlighting
The first is random block highlighting that happens when you move around. See screenshot below for more specific details
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20801821/56820882-07749f80-681b-11e9-9123-0cf2a70e23ce.png)
In the "Status" window, the two green blocks circled shouldn't be there, as the "Changes no stages for commit" line is the one selected.
In the "Diff for unstages files" window, I'm not sure what the red and green blocks are attempting to highlight.

### Scrolling
Best demonstrated in the gifs, there is some really odd behavior where the program is not writing the screen correctly. 

In the [first gif](https://imgur.com/a3nGJgD), simply going up and down on the "Status" window causes the "Diff" window to creep upwards, then eventually just repeat the same 4 lines of the file over and over.

In the [second gif](https://imgur.com/s4uC767), scrolling down works fine, but if I try and scroll up, only the top ~10 lines of the window actually change.

### System Info:
```
$ grv --version
GRV - Git Repository Viewer v0.3.2-0-g13658da (compiled with go1.11.5 at 2019-03-15 22:05:45 GMT)
```
grv is running on top of zsh in a tmux window. This is being run through SSH on a server running RHEL.
