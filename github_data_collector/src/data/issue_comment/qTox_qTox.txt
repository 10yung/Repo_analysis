Correct me if i'm wrong (please) but is there no way to save the formatting when you save logs?

When you right-click and save a log, none of the formats i've been able to guess at has saved the various text formatting (italics, bold, etc). Is there a way to safe the formatting or is that more of a future feature?

In the same vein, is the only way to italic and bolt using ** and //?

I want configure my account by settings from other server(such as ToxId and friend list). Is it possible to set toxId by myself, not random?

As i think i only need find the way to set public key, noSpam key i could change in qtox and calculate checksum.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

E.g., include log located in `~/.cache/Tox/qTox/` / `%APPDATA%\tox\`.
To include it, rename it from `.log` to `.txt`, or zip it.

Tip: use `v4l-info` and `v4l2-ctl --all` to get webcam info on Linux.

##### Brief Description

OS: Arch Linux ARM (pretty shaky distro, running on an old chromebook - possibly the issue)  
qTox version: 1.16.3+
Commit hash:  9765cf5c7212a0207414c09ce159d2548cbcade9
toxcore:  v0.2.10
Qt:  5.14.0
Hardware: Acer cb5-311 

Reproducible: Always

##### Steps to reproduce

1. Open a password encrypted profile on another system on tip.
2. Copy the profile and history database to Arch Linux ARM
3. Attempt to open the profile

##### Observed Behavior
```

```

##### Expected Behavior
The database is decrypted successfully, as the history is saved with sqlcipher 4.x params from Ubuntu, which Arch Linux ARM's sqlcipher is as new or newer, and all the way back to sqlcipher 3.x should work with this database. My system is has
```
 $ sqlcipher --version
3.28.0 2019-04-16 19:49:53 884b4b7e502b4e991677b53971277adfaf0a04a284f8e483e2553d0f8315alt1
```
but my Ubuntu 18.04 system that can handle the history has:
```
$ sqlcipher --version
3.15.2 2016-11-28 19:13:37 bbd85d235f7037c6a033a9690534391ffeacecc8
```
@sphaerophoria am I right that you mentioned you couldn't open your encrypted history on Arch Linux either? If so that would rule out that it's my shaky distro and make this issue more serious.
##### Brief Description

OS: Windows
qTox version:   v 1.16.3
Commit hash:  8eed684c37bd711de2ca4bd863f5f0509edcdc2d
toxcore:  0.2.3
Qt:  5.9.6
Hardware:  Laptop

Reproducible: Always

before, whether I used vpn or not, tox could go online, and the status dot could go green. But right now, I just can not go online. Most time I used v2ray and tox at the same time, and it worked well. But now, even if I don't use v2ray or other vpn, tox just don't connect. The status dot remains grey. I reinstalled qtox several times, and I reset all the settings but nothing seemed to do well.

##### Steps to reproduce

1. start qtox
2. wait for qtox to go online
3. see if the status dot goes green

##### Observed Behavior

the status dot never goes green, it remains grey.

##### Expected Behavior

the stauts dot goes green in a short time

##### Additional Info

I reviewed my log after I exported it. I know there must be some errors but I just don't know how to fix them. I will show it here. Hope it would help. :)

I'd like qTox to make a notification sound even if the window is active.  A checkbox allowing this behavior would be most appreciated.  I only get a notification sound if the window does not have focus.

I see that others have already requested a separate setting in your configuration for where this sound goes to avoid having it go to the headphones, and the ability to change the default sound.  Both of those are also important.
This is a 'first try' at displaying the user name in the tray menu.

Updating the name only happens when restarting the client, and truncating too long ones is not there yet.

There's a lot of janky ChatLog behaviour since the functionality to remove messages from the ChatLog was added a few months ago. It's definitely a good idea to remove messages from the ChatLog when it becomes too big for memory and performance reasons, but there are some architectural problems:
1) GenericChatForm holds the multiple GUI elements, e.g. search, chat edit, and ChatLog. But GenericChatForm still handles a bunch of message layout logic. IMO this should all be handled only inside of ChatLog.
2) Both GenericChatForm and ChatLog hold a cache of rendered messages. There's no reason to duplicate this any more, since SessionChatLog stores unrendered messages that can be loaded if the ChatLog is scrolls.
3) ChatLog has different message removal behaviour for friends and groups (if history is available), which is no longer required because of SessionChatLog. Message removal from ChatLog should always be possible.
4) SessionChatLog should expose a list of all messages, and ChatLog should just know about the list of rendered messages, and the subset of those rendered messages that are visible. ChatLog currently renders any message added to the bottom below all other messages, which means if you're scrolled up, receiving a new message will incorrectly append it onto your partial view. If instead, ChatLog correctly didn't render the message that was outside of its view, GenericChatForm would still cache that message and think it was rendered, since it has split responsibility and duplicated state.

We have 3 options going forward for fixing ChatLog:

1) Minimal fix: to unblock v1.17.0 release, change a few lines in ChatLog to restore old scroll behaviour, and no longer remove lines form ChatLog, which would be another couple lines would work. This would unfortunately mean we'd lose chat line eviction behaviour for v1.17.0, but would fix the scroll to bottom issue, fix search with scroll issues, and fix adding messages while scrolled up causing a gap in chat. I have this implemented locally.

2) Fix scroll and message gap: As well as fixing scroll like above, add to ChatLog knowledge of what messages are in render range, change logic in ChatLog that removes messages from top or bottom of ChatLog to instead remove messages based on where the current visible messages are. i.e. don't remove messages from top of ChatLog just because a message was added to the bottom, because of the user is scrolled up, messages at top of ChatLog might be what is in view. ChatLog should remove messages that are furthest away from the visible messages. Change GenericChatForm to not cache messages that ChatLog doesn't want to render because they're out of range.

3) For a complete fix: GeneircChatForm and ChatLog need a refactor. All rendered message handling logic should be in ChatLog only, ChatLog shouldn't care if the chat has history, and ChatLog should be aware of its targetted render range. If a message is updated outside of that render range, it should not add it (e.g. new message received when we're scrolled up). GenericChatForm handling wouldn't need to be added for when ChatLog rejects messages, since GenericChatForm would no longer be caching messages.

I feel like option 3) would almost definitely introduce a new slew of bugs since ChatForm is so fragile. I don't want to do a large refactor in that area when it's holding back release. Doing that on master once release is out would be great.

option 2) allows us to keep the message eviction performance benefit. Adding to ChatLog knowledge of its intended render range is a little complicated, and updating GenericChatForm to not cache messages that ChatLog doesn't want to render is a bit complicated too since currently GenericChatForm caches the message before ChatLog is given it. This wouldn't be _too_ hard, but I'm still worried that new bugs would be introduced.

option 1) is simple, and losing the performance benefit of message eviction from ChatLog isn't a regression from last release. IMO we should only re-include the performance benefits when the multiple architectural problems causing bugs are worked out.

@sudden6 what do you think? I'm leaning towards option 1, but think option 2 would be reasonable.
