The `.pagination` class at Bootstrap adds margin at the top and at the bottom of the element it is on. Looking at the [current examples][0] they have on their documentation page, only one element has this class and it’s an inner one, not the parent `<nav>`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/385232/72429359-b1200600-3787-11ea-8a75-29eed7f82692.png)

While working on one of our projects, I noticed that Pagy had way more vertical margins than it should have, so I noticed its Bootstrap helper was adding the class twice on two different elements. Since I believe the markup it outputs should be as close as possible to Bootstrap’s documentation, the class added to the `<nav>` element feels out of place.

Since I replaced kaminari for Pagy, The server CPU went up from 7% average to 100% :O. I haven't found out exactly why it happens yet, but after 2 days of server shut down because of CPU went to the roof, I reverted back to Kaminari and the CPU went down to the regular average of 7%.

My specs:
- Ruby 2.6.5
- Rails 5.2.3
- Nginx
- Passenger
- Mysql

I'm gonna try to use Pagy over the weekend on a testing site, see if I can find the bug and I'll post it here. Thanks.

Made options optional if vars param is populated accordingly
More than a year after writing my blog post about integrating Hanami and Pagy I finally found some time to write a proper (?) Pagy extra for Hanami :wink: This obviously lacks documentation or tests. For I'm just creating a PR to discuss if my approach is ok and in line with Pagy's standards. I'll add docs and tests later.

[Here](https://github.com/hanami/bookshelf/compare/master...katafrakt:pagy-ext?expand=1)'s an example of how it looks when put into use.
