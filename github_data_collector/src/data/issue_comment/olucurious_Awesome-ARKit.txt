i just found this cool app called [Mushrooms XR](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mushrooms-xr/id1340830544) that uses AR to get the device's position accurately. usage can be found [here](http://homido.com/en/mushrooms-xr-setup/)

its just a demo but its still pretty cool nonetheless
Added a new AR app in the App Store section
