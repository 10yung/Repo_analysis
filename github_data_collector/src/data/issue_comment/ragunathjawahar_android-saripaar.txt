validator's mValidationContext resolves to null as fragment is instance of app.fragment in latest release. How to use androix.fragment.app.fragment
thanks for your work.

I want to modify the message layout,change color and size etc,but cant find where to do it.

When i'm using android-saripaar in project with one module it's ok but if i'm using this library with multiple module project the problem is R,java is not final in library modules so i think you need to support R2 or create custom R class to use it with android-saripaar

hi,
i just validate some field textview and edit text. 2 textview validate using "@notempty" annotation and one field edit ext which is filled with phone number and validate it with "@length" annotation. 

when i've done fetch phone number from contacts intent, i called validator.validate(). and it's success (called method OnValidationSucceeded()), which is 2 textview is empty, which is I use "@notempty" annotation, not as i expected

Can anyone help with this problem? thx.
