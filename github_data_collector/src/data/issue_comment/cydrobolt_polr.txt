## Expected Behavior
Executing "php artisan geoip:update" downloads an Update for GeoIP DB

## Current Behavior
It fails
```
php artisan geoip:update
Updating...

  [ErrorException]
  get_headers(): php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not known

```
## Possible Solution
https://blog.maxmind.com/2019/12/18/significant-changes-to-accessing-and-using-geolite2-databases/
The Vendor now demands an Account and a License to download the DB. This needs additional Implementation or a different Vendor

## Expected Behavior
A user should be able to delete their own shortened links

## Current Behavior
Only the administrator can delete links, users can only update them from the web UI but not from the API

## Possible Solution
Implement deletion of links for the owning user, through web UI and API.

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
1. Log in on a non-admin account
2. create a shortened link
3. try to delete it
4. - no delete button, only admins can delete links. Normal users can't even delete their own links.

## Context
Affects me: polr is unusable for my project.


## Expected Behavior
I'm trying to use polr on my own server to create a static URL that points to a dynamic one that changes all the time. For that purpose I have a script on the device star serves the dynamic url which uses wget to create an entry in my polr server that has a completely static url - by using the custom_ending and is_public=true.

My problem is, it only works once - after that I get "custom ending already in use" until I manually log in on the dashboard (as admin, even) to delete the entry.

## Current Behavior
it is impossible to update an existing url through the API

## Possible Solution
implement a new parameter, "update=<bool>", or implement a delete action in the API.


## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
1. create an URL via the API
2. create the same url with a different target
3. observe the second attempt to fail.

## Context
Basically, the way this affects me is: polr is useless for my project.

## Your Environment
latest release from github running on openSUSE 15.1 with PHP7
<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->

## Expected Behavior
<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->
<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->
I can't use this program in the secondary directory, Error 404. In addition, I found that many resources referenced in the program use absolute directory, which leads to resource loading 404 (I understand that these errors do not exist when the secondary directory is not used, but I need to use the secondary directory). But after I fix the problem of resource loading, there are still 404 errors on the website. Please fix them to be compatible with the secondary directory installation. Thank you.

## Current Behavior
<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->
<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->
Install using secondary directory, all pages are Error 404.
## Possible Solution
<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug, -->
<!--- or ideas how to implement the addition or change -->
Change absolute directory to relative directory when referencing (maybe).
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
<!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->
<!--- reproduce this bug. Include code to reproduce, if relevant -->
1.Use the secondary directory installation, and you'll see that there are 404 errors.
2.
3.
4.

## Context
<!--- How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish? -->
<!--- Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world -->
I think this is a serious problem, because laravel itself and other laravel projects can be used in the secondary directory, but the errors in pollr indicate that there are still problems in this project.
## Your Environment
<!--- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->
* Version or latest commit hash (`git rev-parse HEAD`):f9622d7
* Environment name and version (e.g. Chrome 39, PHP 7.0, etc):Apache 2.4 PHP 7.2
* Instance link (optional): 

I added the logic to prevent shortlinks which would conflict with already registered routes or existing directories. Plus a test to prove it works. :)
##  Expected Behavior

Shortening the URL `https://salim_b.gitlab.io/` should just work.

## Current Behavior

When trying to shorten the URL `https://salim_b.gitlab.io/`, e.g. on the [demo page](http://demo.polr.me/), an error message appears:

> **Error**
> The link URL format is invalid.

This PR adds bare bones OAuth 2.0 support by implementing an [OpenID Connect client](https://github.com/jumbojett/OpenID-Connect-PHP). 

To authenticate via OpenID, navigate to `/login/openid`. This PR also provides an option to always use OpenID (overridable by navigating to `/login/internal`), which enterprise users may find useful. 

The extension can be configured with the following environmental variables:

```
OPENID_CONNECT_URL="https://sso.cor.insanityradio.com"
OPENID_CONNECT_CONFIGURATION="default"
OPENID_CONNECT_CLIENT_ID="polr"
OPENID_CONNECT_CLIENT_SECRET="xxxxx"
OPENID_CONNECT_ADMIN_GROUP="comma,separated,list"

## Expected Behavior
Angle bracket ('>') entered in password should be sent to database as an angle bracket


## Current Behavior
Angle bracket entered in password is sent to database as html escape sequence ('&amp;gt;')

## Possible Solution
Use html_entity_decode() on password (and perhaps on other fields) before writing them to .env (or however that translates into the frameworks being used).

If there's no documentation on how to make this happen, warn the user of this issue.

## Expected Behavior
Installation instructions should be complete and accurate


## Current Behavior
https://docs.polrproject.org/en/latest/user-guide/installation/ states:

"Copy the .env.setup file to .env in your website's root directory."

However https://github.com/cydrobolt/polr/issues/412 states:

"You should copy .env.setup to .env in the root folder of the project, i.e not in public"


## Possible Solution

Change https://docs.polrproject.org/en/latest/user-guide/installation/ to read:

"Copy the .env.setup file to .env in the /var/www/polr/ directory."

It's safe to assume this directory name, since the previous instructions unambiguously specified this directory name.

## Context
I am trying to bring up polr, I am still having problems, but until I properly understood the above issue, I could not get the artisan steps to function.

## Your Environment
ubuntu 18.04 with:
apt install mysql-server mysql-client php php-mysql php7.2-mbstring php7.2-curl php-xml mmdb-bin zip unzip
