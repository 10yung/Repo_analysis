There's this editor "vis" which uses regex and it's quite convenient. Can you make the search commands use regex?

Also there is the ':x' command which searches for a pattern then selects it:  
`:x/te.t/` will select 'text', 'test', 'tert' etc. It is very convenient. Also it can automatically apply a command to them like: `x/te.t/ c/test/` which will "change" all the matches to 'test'. very niceu if you ask me.

Thanks

Hey there! Thanks for such a simple and nice editor!

I've been using it for a few days now, and I would love to have a simple case sensitivity switch - I find it confusing when trying to jump to a symbol and it's not appearing.

I've read the [warning in the docs](https://amp.rs/docs/usage/#replace), but if you think it's somewhat simple to implement this (maybe adding a `case_sensitive` key inside `amp/config.yml`?), I would be happy to try and open a PR (need to stretch my Rust knowledge though).
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new buffer with Shift-b
2. Press `d`
3. New line is added
4. Go to the last line
5. Press `d`
6. New line is added
Double width unicode grapheme do not seem to be handled correctly (not all grapheme have the same width in the [terminal](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/tr11-36.html) :man_shrugging:).

I am not sure if this is out of scope. Otherwise :+1: for the great project.

Hi, thanks for you lovely editor!
I'm not sure if there's an option to specify file type (highlighting) when writing new file (buffer, pressing `B` key)

Would like to use this editor when I show some code snippets I'm about to write, but without going to the IDE. Would be nice if : 

1. I press `B`
2. Somehow I specify that, for example, I'm about to write `java` file
3. Syntax highlighting takes place immediately

Thanks!
Hi!

I use amp several sublime text .sublime-syntax files (for formats not supported out of the box) that I collected.
One is for vuejs .vue files that always worked ... except for a file. With this particular file amp crashes! I cannot see the error message because it disappears too fast.
The same file and same syntax works with sublime (I tried before submitting this issue).

Don't know if the problem is caused by the syntax having some problems in the definition ... but maybe amp should not crash or at least should give a meaningful message.

I attach the syntax file and a file that when edited gives the problem (you have to scroll until reaching the styles) if you want to check it up. If not please close the issue :)

Thanks in advance and thanks again for you great work on amp

I optimistically add this pull-request to show why I created https://github.com/jmacdonald/scribe/pull/16. I have been sitting on and using this code for my own work daily since August 2018 and think it is stable.

The reason I created this PR now is that I noticed https://github.com/jmacdonald/amp/issues/141 and wanted to save @jmacdonald some work if possible.

I optimistically updated Cargo.toml with the new version of scribe, but will not be able to do the same with Cargo.lock until it is actually pushed to crates.io.

I fully understand if this feature is already being implemented in a different way and won't take offense if the PR is rejected. I am also happy to make adjustments/additions to make it comply.
