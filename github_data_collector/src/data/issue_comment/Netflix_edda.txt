I was running a report that simply grabs the data from edda and noticed several instances that I knew had been stopped were showing they were running. I verified this in the AWS console.

I then went back and modified a couple of other instances by putting them into the stopped state. They are stopped but Edda is still showing them as running.

From an instance lookup, be able to identify the ELBs it is in.

Currently all the iam crawlers only process the first page of all these results:

ListAccessKeysResult
ListGroupPoliciesResult
ListGroupsResult
ListMFADevicesResult
ListRolesResult
ListUserPoliciesResult
ListUsersResult

They need to be checked and paginated using result.getIsTrunctated() and result.getMarker()  then on the subsequent request call setMarker().

@e-gineer since you contributed the code, perhaps you could look into this?  (or @ralph-tice since you were interested in these collections?)  We don't use the iam collections at Netflix, so we have not noticed the problem, but Bob Brown on the edda-users ran into this issue.

In an increasingly complex edda.properties file, it is too easy to make typos in an account.name or forget a part of the proper suffix for config options. 

Look into the ability to sanity check configuration options, especially around account credentials (which will silently inherit higher level credentials or try to auto-discover via metadata. 

At the least, consider adding informational log messages regarding credential providers and what value the credentials were sourced from (or auto-discovered via metadata). 

This is related to issue #7.

There seems to be a problem with hostedRecords creating to many document revisions. I have found thousands of new documents with identical content as the previous revision (_diff also show no output).  My hunch is that multiple records are colliding, perhaps multiple CNAME records acting as a RR dns entry?  So at a minimum I think we cannot use the "name" attribute as the id, but looking at the resource I dont see any attribute that could be used as the resource id.  We probably need to keep the recordSets together as a single resource.
