Hi, ErlangRT isn't working with the latest rust nightly it was breaking because of ramp. So I issued a pr to fix ramp which has been merged and released.

There are still thing breaking in the code but at least it's a start.


Check compatible BEAM version (instruction count field or something like that).
- [x] 116: bs_start_match2/5
- [ ] 117: bs_get_integer2/7
- [ ] 118: bs_get_float2/7
- [ ] 119: bs_get_binary2/7
- [ ] 120: bs_skip_bits2/5
- [ ] 121: bs_test_tail2/3
- [ ] 122: bs_save2/2
- [ ] 123: bs_restore2/2

- [ ] #6 replicate `bin/` environment and support basic command line for erlexec and ctrun
- [x] Make ct_run work
- [ ] Make erlexec work
- [ ] Make erl and make it run the emulator

Or possibly simplify startup of the whole thing by adding a shared lib for all 3
