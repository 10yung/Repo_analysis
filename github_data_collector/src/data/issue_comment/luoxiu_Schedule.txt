It seems to be working, but we lost one day. Today is Friday the 18th, and the nearest next timer operation is set to Sunday the 20th (do not look at the time, it is adjusted according to the timezone). That is, we lost somewhere Saturday. 

Can you tell me how to correctly make a task for each day at a certain time?
I am using the task as shown below and used as a property to singleton class.
```
            schedulerTask = Plan.every(0.5).do(queue: .global()) {
doSomething()
            }
```
Which is resulting in this crash.

Here is my simple code:
```
task = Plan.every(5.second).do {
    self.checkIfUnauthorized()
}
task?.resume()
```
This is only working one time.
I am running this code on iOS 12.2 with Xcode 10.2.1.
