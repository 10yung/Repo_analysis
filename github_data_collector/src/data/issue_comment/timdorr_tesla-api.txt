Redo of #171 by @pdobb, since I mucked things up royally on his PR.

The docs part needs to be updated, as this isn't for software update checking, but for paid upgrades (like Acceleration Boost).
I found that all car's option_codes all same as:
```
"option_codes": "AD15,MDL3,PBSB,RENA,BT37,ID3W,RF3G,S3PB,DRLH,DV2W,W39B,APF0,COUS,BC3B,CH07,PC30,FC3P,FG31,GLFR,HL31,HM31,IL31,LTPB,MR31,FM3B,RS3H,SA3P,STCP,SC04,SU3C,T3CA,TW00,TM00,UT3P,WR00,AU3P,APH3,AF00,ZCST,MI00,CDM0",
```
In API: https://owner-api.teslamotors.com/api/1/vehicles with theirs token
I test 40+ different cars.
Currently the Tesla-App shows that my vehicle is In Service, but when I look at the response from the Tesla-API request "vehicle" or "vehicle_data", the field "in_service" shows False.
So there must be another way/command of detecting whether a Tesla is in service or not.
Any ideas?
While there is [support in the Ruby code](https://github.com/timdorr/tesla-api/blob/master/lib/tesla_api/stream.rb) for the Streaming API, [the docs are completely empty](https://github.com/timdorr/tesla-api/blob/master/docs/vehicle/streaming.md). We should fix that by filling them in. Anyone want to help?

You can now "Summon" via the app and there is also some HomeLink capability. I have a 2012 Model S, so I'm unable to live test this stuff, but hopefully I can use the HomeLink APIs nonetheless.
