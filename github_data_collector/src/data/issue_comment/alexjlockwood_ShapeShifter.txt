maaa chudao
Getting this when trying to Export AVD. 
I use different groups for _forward_ and _reverse_ animations. So I want to hide one of the groups -> Export and vice versa for the other one.

This worked a few days ago.
Same error in Chrome and Firefox

"Starting from API 23, it is possible to use PropertyValuesHolder and Keyframe in resource files to create more complex animations. Using PropertyValuesHolders allows animators to animate several properties in parallel, as shown in this sample:"
I'm trying to animate my friend's logo and the shapeshifter beta editor cant handle the shape so it's reshaping some of the curves and stuffing it up
Is there any update on how to integrate in swift/objc code? 
This:

Readme says it can be used with iOS but I can't find a single source telling how to do that. We could use a clarification in readme.
As we know , to convert an object to clip path we can do it by clicking "more options" (3 dots icon) on the right side of the layer. The issue is whenever I try to put animation to any layer the more options or the 3 dot icon button disappears and I'm unable to convert other objects to clip path.

Whenever I delete the animations on the timeline. The 3 Dot More Option Icon appears again.

Am I just missing something? or is this a bug?

Thanks in advance!

as i love this tool and it even saved me a few times
i wish i could duplicate a svg shape i imported or made
i just tested the beta and love it so far
but wish i could click a button to duplicate what i have selected

also a option to snap to a grid square would also be amazing to use
love the project and keep it up
Clicking on any of the Export options doesn't download anything when on Edge in Windows 10.
Switching to Google Chrome allows me to download.
(Internet Explorer 11 doesn't show the site at all.)
