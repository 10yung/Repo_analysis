Since being migrated to the DSC Community, this module must be updated to use the new CI process and repository structure.
#### Details of the scenario you tried and the problem that is occurring
Disabling netbios generates an error if the adapter is disabled.  Test-DSCConfiguration determines the status appropriately, but Start-DSCConfiguration errors out when the adapter is disabled. 
#### Verbose logs showing the problem
From output when running start-dscConfiguration
PowerShell DSC resource MSFT_NetBios  failed to execute Set-TargetResource functionality with error message: System.InvalidOperationException: An error result 
of '84' was returned when attemting to set NetBIOS configuration to 'Disable'. 
    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (:) [], CimException

#### Suggested solution to the issue
Add "policystore" as a DSC property for both Firewall and FirewallProfile resources
Set the default value of the "policystore" parameter to be "persistentstore" to make it a non-breaking change and accommodate all existing configurations.
Add "policystore" parameter to
+ Get/Set/Test-TargetResource functions in both Resources
+ Get-FirewallRule and Get-FirewalRulleProperty helper functions in Firewall resource
+ Get/Set/New-NetFirewallRule commands in Firewall resource
+ Get/Set-NetFirewallProfile commands in FirewallProfile resource

I have made and tested the required changes and can happily submit a pull request with the updates to the code and localization strings.

I have also added two Pester tests to the Firewall resources for the helper function "Get-FirewallRule" when the -policystore is specified and the firewall rule is present/absent.

#### Details of the scenario you tried and the problem that is occurring
I need to ensure that the DNS client does not try to register the interface connection while having no DNS specific suffixes.

#### Verbose logs showing the problem

When not providing the DnsConnectionSuffix parameter the error occurs when compiling the MOF:

```powershell
PSDesiredStateConfiguration\Node : At line:2 char:2
+  DnsConnectionSuffix LAN_2055578403 {
+  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Resource 'DnsConnectionSuffix' requires that a value of type 'String' be provided for property 'ConnectionSpecificSuffix'.
At C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\DscService\Scripts\New-DscConfiguration.ps1:102 char:5
+     Node $AllNodes.NodeName {
+     ~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (:) [PSDesiredStateConfiguration\node], ParentContainsErrorRecordException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : MissingValueForMandatoryProperty,PSDesiredStateConfiguration\node
```

When providing an empty DnsConnectionSuffix parameter an error occurs when the MOF is applied on computer:

```powershell
Could not find mandatory property ConnectionSpecificSuffix. Add this property and try again.
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (root/Microsoft/...gurationManager:String) [], CimException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : MI RESULT 6
```

#### Suggested solution to the issue
The resource should not be dependent on the connection suffix but on the interface alias.
With the command line the registration can be disabled, whether the interface has or has not a connection specific suffix.
```powershell
Get-NetIPInterface | Set-DnsClient -RegisterThisConnectionsAddress $false
```

#### The DSC configuration that is used to reproduce the issue (as detailed as possible)

```powershell
NetworkingDsc:
  DnsConnectionSuffix:
    - InterfaceAlias: LAN
      RegisterThisConnectionsAddress: False
      UseSuffixWhenRegistering: False

#### Details of the scenario you tried and the problem that is occurring

I am trying to configure an interface profile to LocalNetwork but the resource does not find the CIM object.

#### Verbose logs showing the problem

TimeCreated  : 23/10/2019 14:39:21
ProviderName : Microsoft-Windows-DSC
Id           : 4103
Message      : Job {033F100F-F592-11E9-AF98-005056A08475} : 
               This event indicates that a non-terminating error was thrown when DSCEngine was executing Set-TargetResource on MSFT_NetConnectionProfile DSC resource. FullyQualifiedErrorId is 
               CmdletizationQuery_NotFound,Set-NetConnectionProfile. Error Message is No matching MSFT_NetConnectionProfile objects found by CIM query for instances of the 
               root/StandardCimv2/MSFT_NetConnectionProfile class on the  CIM server: SELECT * FROM MSFT_NetConnectionProfile  WHERE ((InterfaceAlias LIKE 'LAN')) AND ((IPv4Connectivity = 3)) AND 
               ((IPv6Connectivity = 3)). Verify query parameters and retry..

#### Suggested solution to the issue

So far I understand the error message, the resource is searching for an interface named LAN which has IPv4 and IPv6 set as LocalNetwork.

However, the conectivity type (LocalNetwork) is not the value the resource should be searching for but instead it shoud set it.

Searching an interface named LAN and setting it to LocalNetwork is the goal...

#### Details of the scenario you tried and the problem that is occurring
I apply the same configuration on Windows 2016 GUI, Windows 2016 Core, Windows 2019 GUI and Windows 2019 Core.

DSC modules like cChoco are working fine as soon as the proxy configuration has been set set via the **ProxySettings** resource of the **NetworkingDsc** module, except for Core servers.

#### Suggested solution to the issue

Currently the **ProxySettings** resource is applying proxy settings on this registry key: `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Connections`

It does also apply successfully these settings on the same key on Core servers, though it has no effect.

However, when I manually apply the same values on the system account, it works fine on Core servers too after a computer restart or a new DSC pull session.
Here is the key where I apply the configuration:
`registry::HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-18\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Connections`

The proxy configuration should be added to this registry key too, in order to make it functioning on Core servers and not only GUI servers.

#### Version of the DSC module that was used ('dev' if using current dev branch)

7.4.0.0
#### Details of the scenario you tried and the problem that is occurring
If you try to enable a predefined rule that does not already exist than instead you end up with a wide open rule permitting all traffic inbound.

This could potentially cause security holes to someone that does not notice.

Firewall export of the rule as CSV
RemoteFwAdmin-In-TCP,,All,Yes,Allow,No,Any,Any,Any,Any,Any,Any,Any,Any,Any,Any,Any,Any,

#### Verbose logs showing the problem

#### Suggested solution to the issue
Perhaps send an error to the user indicating that the builtin rule they are trying to use does not exist and do not create a wide open rule.

#### The DSC configuration that is used to reproduce the issue (as detailed as possible)
```powershell
Configuration Firewall_EnableBuiltInFirewallRule_Config
{
    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName NetworkingDsc

    Node localhost
    {
        Firewall EnableBuiltInFirewallRule
        {
            Name                  = 'RemoteFwAdmin-In-TCP'
            Ensure                = 'Present'
            Enabled               = 'True'
        }
    }
}

# insert configuration here

## Details of the scenario you tried and the problem that is occurring
When defining multiple entries on a single line it will write them to the host file every time the LCM kicks off.

Line 233 -259 takes in account for multiple entries per line but then a compare happens later against that array and a string that was passed into the Get-HostEntry.

#### Suggested solution to the issue
Change line 368 
FROM: `if ($result.Host -eq $HostName)` 
TO: `if ([string]$result.Host -eq HostName)`

#### The DSC configuration that is used to reproduce the issue (as detailed as possible)
```powershell
HostsFile "Test1"
            {
                HostName  = 'test-ocsp-responder testVM.lab.local'
                IPAddress = '192.168.1.50'
