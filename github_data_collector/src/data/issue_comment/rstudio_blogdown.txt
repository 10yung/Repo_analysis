Hi,
I am trying to add a table to my post to the Hugo Academic themes using Rmarkdown with the kableExtra package in an R chunk code. However, it seems that I can not customize the styling options to my table such as to position the table to the center of the page or to use the "basic" format in the bootstrap options (by default, the table appears with strips of alternative colors in each row).

Here is the reproducible code:
```{r, echo=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
options(kableExtra.html.bsTable = TRUE)
dt = mtcars[1:10,1:3]
kable(dt,format = "html") %>% kable_styling(position = "right",bootstrap_options = "basic")
```
I notice some odd behavior on the list page of the post directory for the Hugo Academic theme and blogdown. Specifically, if a code chunk is the first piece of text in an Rmd post AND `include=FALSE` is not set, then the summary for that post is  the code chunk.

<img width="1157" alt="Screen Shot 2019-12-21 at 4 56 43 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16192182/71314265-fc5a2980-2412-11ea-9897-2e47a9d0b040.png">

Steps to reproduce:
Make a new website using blogdown and Hugo Academic theme.
1)  `File -> New Project`, `New Directory`, `Website using blogdown`, Hugo theme `gcushen/hugo-academic`, `Create Project`

2) build site `blogdown::build_site()`

3) serve site `blogdown::serve_site()`

4) Go to `/post/` page and notice last entry, "Hello R Markdown" followed by some summary text.

5) Edit the file `content/post/2015-07-23-r-rmarkdown.Rmd` by removing the first paragraph of text.

6) save and re-serve site if necessary. 

Now if you look back at the `post/` page the summary under "Hello R Markdown" is the code from the first code chunk. Unless you specify `include=FALSE` in the code chunk, whenever you have a `.Rmd` file and code is the first thing on the page, then the chunk and its data will be used in the summary.

It would be so much nicer if we could use `output` option in blogdown posts' YAML.

For example, I have been using `academic` theme, and sometimes I would like to utilize `distill::distill_article` output format for a specific post.

Do you think it could be achieved?
See https://updog.co. We need to update the blogdown book accordingly (at least remove the section on Updog).
When I write a new post for https://www.tidyverse.org, I generally use the "Serve Site" add-in, which calls `blogdown:::serve_site()`. It initially appears in RStudio's Viewer and I use "Show in New Window" to send it over to Safari. There, I navigate down to the post I'm working on. So far so good.

As I make edits and save, over in the `.Rmarkdown` file corresponding to the post, somehow the way I'm constantly rendering and previewing frequently (but not always?) results in a new tab being opened. It feels like it's because my existing Safari tab is not viewing the main page, but is viewing a specific post. That is just a theory. But it swiftly results in a crazy proliferation of browser tabs, conceivably one per "save".

这里报出来的错误。可以看出这个函数考虑到hexo了，因为dir针对不同的generator做了适配，但是后面的逻辑对于hexo来说，是不是也需要适配下，因为对于hexo来说配置文件是`_config.yml`，而不是`config.yaml`，还有必要处理这些yaml文件吗，还是说我理解错了？

还有一个问题，对于hexo用户来说，blogdown目前支持不太完善，后面会对hexo进行全方位的适配吗，像hugo那样？

Version 0.1 changed the default behavior to use post bundles:

> You can create a new post as the index file of a Hugo page bundle via blogdown::new_post() or the RStudio addin "New Post" if you set options(blogdown.new_bundle = TRUE). One benefit of using a page bundle instead of a normal page is that you can put resource files associated with the post (such as images) under the same directory of the post itself. This means you no longer have to put them under the static/ directory, which has been quite confusing to Hugo beginners (thanks, @DavisVaughan @romainfrancois @apreshill, #351).

Images added to the site as resource files in this way do not show up in RSS feeds. For example, refer to: https://github.com/rstudio/blog/pull/173

The first image is referenced from the root `static` directory, and is correctly qualified:

```
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.rstudio.com/images/rsc-174-schedules.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;View Scheduled Content&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;View Scheduled Content&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
```

Whereas the second image is referenced in a page bundle, and is incorrect:

```
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;assets-ci.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;CI/CD Toolchains&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Integrate Connect into CI/CD Toolchains&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
```

For certain sites, such as the rstudio blog, this issue also prevents the relative image from being correctly rendered as a thumbnail for a post.

This PR proposes an option to `build_site()` using multiple parallel-running R processes, utilizing only the base package `parallel`. This can result in significant speed improvements with hardware common in 2019.

To enable the parallelization, the user must specify 2 options:

```
options(
  blogdown.use_parallel = TRUE,
  blogdown.use_parallel.cores = number_of_cores
)
```

The functionality is only triggered if:

- the option `blogdown.use_parallel` is `TRUE`
- the option `blogdown.use_parallel.cores` is `> 1`
- the length of `files` is `> 1`
- the `parallel` package is available

If this direction of functionality is accepted, we can make the implementation less conservative and easier to use.
I have followed the guidance for inserting citations, but neither the citations or the references are printed. 

I'm currently using RMarkdown to write entries into my blog and the most recent version of hugo (0.53) and the academic theme. Has anyone else had this problem or resolved it?
Hi @yihui,

I hope it is OK for me to place there here- I would like to update this section after our workshop next week to reflect additional global options listed here: https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/edit/master/docs/01-introduction.Rmd. 

Also, I would like to reference the [`usethis::edit_r_profile()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/edit.html) function here- it alerts users to the empty line rule at the end of the file in a user-friendly way.

Again, I'm assigning this issue to myself (if that is OK with you!).

Alison
