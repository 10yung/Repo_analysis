@alexdrone  Swift 4 Support?



How can I update this project to support FontAwesome 4.6 icons ?
Tnx
Roberto

Could you make this awesome project support [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)? Thanks.

Hi,

I have just included the NSString+FontAwesome.h and .m on my project along with FontAwesome.ttf. 
I made the changes on info.plist and also verified that Build Phase is correct copying the resources. I also checked the output folder and expected files are there.

So now the problem is the icon is not shown when I first access. just a box with an ? appear then when try to access a second time app chrash on the following method:
- (NSString*)fontAwesomeIconStringForEnum:(FAIcon)value {
  return [NSString fontAwesomeUnicodeStrings][value];
  }

with error:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS

Thanks in advance,

-Martin

Some icons are missing in master branch (most of them are alias icons), e.g. fa-edit/fa-close, this PR is about to add those icons back. Demo is also updated to include the new added icons.

This is a PR to update to the latest FontAwesome 4.5, with a few aliases added in.
