Hi,
While using this library, When I am trying to work with the emulator, the FB login page does not open.
While working with the real android device it works fine. Network-related problem is not an issue because it is opening in the system browser.
Please help me out with this issue.
In Xcode, when I try to add **RCTFBLogin.a** in build phases then project build fails.
If I am not adding it then after running project I get "**undefined is not an object(FBLoginManager.Events)''** error.

I have tried many solutions but none is working. Please help me for how to solve this.

I  have tried login with android it working fine but ios get user cancelled event with successful login.Please help  me out. 
App crashes after upgraded to RN 0.60
Any inputs?
Is there anybody who upgraded to FBSDK 5.x using this module?
In previous upgrade it was enough to copy *.framework files but now there are no these files anymore.
Environment:
```
    "react": "16.8.3",
    "react-native": "0.59.5",
    "react-native-facebook-login": "^1.6.1"
```

Just follow the tutorial five steps on Android side.

`react-native run-android` shows the error message:

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

```
* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:transformClassesWithDexBuilderForDebug'.
> com.android.build.api.transform.TransformException: com.android.builder.dexing.DexArchiveBuilderException: com.android.builder.dexing.DexArchiveBuilderException: Failed to process /Users/motogod19/.gradle/caches/transforms-1/files-1.1/support-v4-23.4.0.aar/831352d5902404b4cb6c4604b3d1a256/jars/classes.jar
```

I have the Java 8 setting when create RN 0.59 project on app/build.gradle:
```
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    } 
```

I think it may sdk version problem, so I change on node_modules/react-native-facebook-login/android/build.gradle to:

```
android {
    compileSdkVersion 27
    buildToolsVersion "27.0.3"

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 16
        targetSdkVersion 27
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }
    lintOptions {
        abortOnError false
    }
}
```

It sill shows the error, any ideas ?
I am using version: 1.6.1.
I go this email:

`Your App, is currently accessing Graph API v2.8 which will reach the end of its 2-year lifetime on 18 April, 2019. We estimate 6 endpoints that app calls will be impacted by this change and may stop working after the automatic upgrade push. To ensure a smooth transition, please migrate all calls to Graph API v2.9 or higher. `

What are steps to upgrade this library?

Earlier everything was working fine on my app. But from the past few weeks I started getting this error. 
There is no trace as to what went wrong.
