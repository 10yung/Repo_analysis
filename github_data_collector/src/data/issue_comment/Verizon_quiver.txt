In Getting Started, the link to bintray for finding the current version is broken.

Also, the build.sbt example in Getting Started references obsolete `oncue.quiver`.
Main Github page has link to quiver Gitter at bottom.  I'd love to see a Gitter page for this, but currently the link yields 404 Not Found.
Several key DFS-related methods, including `Graph.reachable`, are completely missing from the current release 7.0.19 for 2.12.

Quiver looks like a very nice library and I would like to use it, but the first thing I wanted to use was the `Graph.reachable` method I saw in the 7.1-SNAPSHOT source on Github.  I eventually downloaded the source JAR and confirmed that `reachable` and several other DFS-based methods are commented out in released 7.0.19 source for 2.12.

Tried also to get sbt to use 7.1-SNAPSHOT, but `io.verizon.quiver#core_2.12;7.1-SNAPSHOT: not found`.
