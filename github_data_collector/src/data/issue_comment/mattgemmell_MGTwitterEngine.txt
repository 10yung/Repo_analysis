Changes for the Twitter 1.1 API (1.0 is disabled by Twitter!)
- remove (some) XML references. 1.1 does not support XML anymore!
- update twitter domain to 1.1
- removed LibXML files
- moderate documentation updates, fix compiler warning in MGTwitterXMLParser.h

Note: not all REST commands have been tested for 1.1 compliance.

I get an error about Twitter Rest API.

Request failed for connectionIdentifier = B3EE49A8-AEEA-4B03-AACC-968668FD8A57, error = The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (HTTP error 410.) ({
    body = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><errors>  <error code=\"68\">The Twitter REST API v1 is no longer active. Please migrate to API v1.1. https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/overview.</error></errors>"

How can I resolve this problem?

Has anyone notice any change on the last hours? Maybe an API update of twitter.

I'm receiving ALWAYS 404 on any status update on
- (void)requestFailed:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier withError:(NSError *)error

Dear Concerned,
It is working fine on all the devices except the iPhone 3GS devices.
iPhone 3GS iOS version 5.1
It always shows 'The request token for this page is invalid.' While on other devices iPhone 4 or above and iPad 1 or above it is working fine.
Please guide me with possible solution
Thanks & Regards,
Zahur

File NSData+Base64.m

in Method initWithBase64EncodedString:

I believe you have to change the unsigned char inbuf[3] to unsigned char inbuf[4]

Made MGTwitterEngine ARC compatible. Updated XAuth authentication code to reflect the OAuthConsumer side API changes.

I'm not sure if you are ok with me using this code. I noticed that it has copyright text at the top and didn't want to use it if I'm not allowed to.

Thanks!

Why using a c json parser like yajl? Something smart could be better, like the good JSONKit, https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit
Possible to port to this the underlining parser?

The code takes in a long value but formats it as %u. This will truncate it to an integer and obviously fail the delete operation.
The formatting should use %lu, if at all we need to use a long value.
In Reality, the direct message ids are not even long but are long long values. So, the format should actually use %llu instead of %lu.

OR for simplicity, why not make it a NSString and save the pain of conversions?

There's a bug in the size of buffers in the base64 files. This commit fixes it, and allows the NSData+Base64 files to be used independently of MGTwitterEngine
