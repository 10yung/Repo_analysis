In the default case (`npm config set prefix "${HOME}/.npm-packages"`), the user will not need to use sudo at all, and in a case where the user need the sudo permissions, he can just `sudo ./npm-g-nosudo.sh`.

Made this because I'm in a computer where I don't have sudo permissions.
Would you be open to including a flag that, if set, automatically adds the export variables to bashrc or zshrc automatically?
Ubuntu 16.10 doesn't like the spaces.
When running this with wget command on Raspbian I get the following errors:

```
sh: 74: [: UG}: unexpected operator
sh: 77: [: UG}: unexpected operator
sh: 88: syntax error: Missing '}'
```
ran it and everything seemed to work fine, but got the error in the title.
