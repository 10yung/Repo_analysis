I think there's some ambiguity in the current wording for 'continue Statements'.

Current wording is:

> When the program execution reaches a continue statement, the program execution immediately jumps back to the start of the loop.

To me the ambiguity is that it might be interpreted as saying that the loop starts entirely again as though it had not yet been started.

Less ambiguous might be:

> When the program execution reaches a continue statement, the program execution skips directly to the start of the next iteration of the loop (if there is one or more remaining), bypassing any other code remaining in the current iteration of the loop.
I've been reading through the guide and was a little confused by the `dedent` clarification (https://github.com/wilfredinni/python-cheatsheet#multiline-strings-with-triple-quotes). Just thought one or two more lines here may be helpful about dedent function and why the .strip() method was used on the print function.


Python 3.6+: dataclasses
Python 2.7+: attrs

they are not part of the std (from 3.7, dataclasses are), but really really make the code much more readable
They are less seen in the wild but really useful to maximize code compatibility


Add a new topic to the cheat sheet: **Classes**
