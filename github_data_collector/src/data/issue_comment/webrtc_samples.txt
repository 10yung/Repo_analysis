Hello,

First of all, thank you for posting this sample, it's very helpful.  

I was wondering if it would be possible to expand the sample a little showing how to make the captured video have a a larger width and height?

Thank you.


Probably this is not correct place to left my question but I wasn't able to find another one.
So my issue is related to Mi Browser of Xiaomi mobile device. I have an web app which uses ` navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` and it works as expected for the most of browsers. But for Mi Browser it doesn't work, promise never ends. I even have no ability to detect that browser does not support getUserMedia because the function is defined but nothing happens when I call it


**Description**
Add bare-minimum audio and device enumeration to the GUM sample.

**Purpose**
This make the GUM sample slightly more complete, and turns it into a useful test program for examining combined API behavior. Also add modern error names to error handling.

1. Launch https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/
2. Click "Reset to defaults" button
3. Input STUN URI: "stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302" and click "Add Server" button
4. Input STUN URI: "stun:stun2.l.google.com:19302" and click "Add Server" button
5. Input STUN URI: "stun:stun3.l.google.com:19302" and click "Add Server" button
6. Input STUN URI: "stun:stun4.l.google.com:19302" and click "Add Server" button
7. ICE options "IceTransports value:" set to "all" (default)
8. ICE options "ICE Candidate Pool:" set to "0" (default)
9. Click on "Gather Candidates" button


## Expected results
It should display all the candidates of Type 'Host' or 'srflx', and no errors show at the bottom.

## Actual results
Error code 701 shows at the bottom of "Gather Candidates" button.
The server stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302 returned an error with code=701:
STUN allocate request timed out.
The server stun:stun2.l.google.com:19302 returned an error with code=701:
STUN allocate request timed out.

Chrome Browser 81.0.4013.0.  

Description
Test page is not working on Linux devices.

Steps to reproduce
Goto https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/getusermedia/volume/
Speak something.

Expected results
Based on the input noise the graphs should reflect.

Actual results
Unfortunately the graphs are stuck.

In java script it shows,
The AudioContext was not allowed to start. It must be resumed (or created) after a user gesture on the page. https://goo.gl/7K7WLu

Does this happen in other platforms?
Not yet checked. The other devices testing is in progress.


Hello, I'm using Samsung Galaxy S10 ( G977, QP1A.190711.020 ) version Android 10 and chrome version 79.0.3945.93.

I'm new to webAR, and I'm trying to learn AR.js, but there are errors when I open the every AR websites, 'Webcam Error Name: NotReadableError, Message: Could not start video source'.
I found the way that changing camera can solve this problem some cases, but for me, just white site is showing.
( I used these links to try:
1. https://codepen.io/nicolocarpignoli/full/KKwzRdJ => just white sites, CHANGE CAMERA works nothing.
2. https://nicolo-carpignoli-herokuapp.com/select-camera => WebcamError shown first, and when I click 'Switch camera' button, chrome said on status bar: Accessing video input. Touch to return to https:// ~ .' But also white site no contents just 'Switch Camera' and VR button. )

I'm trying to solve this problem, but I can't.

How can I solve it?

Thanks.

this will make it easier to detect actual changes (if that ever happens)

libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException
STR:
- checkout the branch
- run the pc1 sample
- observe the console logs for "Time between connectionStatechange" (which should be close to the bottom

My expectation is that this is minor but it turns out to be in the order of ~150ms and the RTT should be close to 0. playoutDelayHint seems to have a small impact on that but even setting it to 0 only reduces the delay between the events to ~100ms.

Arguably we should be able to listen to track.onunmute but... ;-)

Actually I haven't got it work in any browser, either on Mac or PC.

## Description
I am trying to use this sample for echo cancellation, but it doesn't work. 
https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/getusermedia/record/

## Steps to reproduce
1. On any laptop, unplug any headphone to make sure audio can play from speakers. (I am using a MBP)
2. Open https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/getusermedia/record/ in Chrome, and check the "echo cancellation" box.
3. Start playing any YouTube in another Chrome tab. Make sure the audio is played from speaker.
4. Start to record video using this sample, accept any permissions for camera and microphone.

## Expected results
I expect the recorded video should cancel the audio from YouTube significantly when the "echo cancellation" is checked.

## Actual results
The audio from YouTube still got recorded and played back in original volume, regardless of whether "echo cancellation" is checked or not. I haven't made it work in any browser, either on Mac or PC.
