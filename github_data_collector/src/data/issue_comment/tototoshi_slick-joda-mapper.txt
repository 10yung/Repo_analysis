I just noticed when upgrading my libraries, that slick 3.3.2 is already out. No immediate need to do anything, but maybe you want to upgrade here as well. 
I create DateTime with TZ UTC before I persist and then read them back.
Both in the database and in the result the TZ is set to default for the system.

I use postgres and the column is of type 'timestamptz'.
The code inserts the DateTime with `${dateTime} :: timestamptz`

Am I missing something?
[Slick 3.2.0-RC1 / Scala 2.12](http://slick.lightbend.com/news/2017/02/10/slick-3.2.0-RC1-released.html) is available.

I'm currently using Slick Code Generator 
which by default generates a trait with a abstract member of type JdbcProfile. 

I think if we have a trait for GenericJodaSupport it would be better. 
Also, we can support cake pattern, too. 

This PR is a bit related with #36 #37 

For backward compatibility, I just added new traits without changing any existing interfaces. 

I'm using slick-joda-mapper with its `GenericJodaSupport` trait. I want to be able to write queries like

```
val query = MyTable.filter(entry => year(entry.date) === my_year)
```

MySQL has the `YEAR(...)` function for that, PostgreSQL has `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ...)`.
I've written some own code that enables this (see below), but it would be cool if this functionality would be imported by GenericJodaSupport already.

Here code that makes this work in MySQL:

```
val year = SimpleFunction.unary[DateTime,Int]("YEAR")
```

And here for PostgreSQL:

```
val year = SimpleExpression.unary[DateTime, Int] { (node, queryBuilder) =>
   queryBuilder.sqlBuilder += "extract(year from "
   queryBuilder.expr(node)
   queryBuilder.sqlBuilder += ")"
}
```

Same is possible for month, day, hour, ...

Hi!
Are you planning to add YearMonth support?

I read that TIMESTAMP in MySQL is having a lot of magic that you usually want to avoid when using Slick. Have you considered mapping it into SQL type DATETIME instead?


Hey guys. I have problem with compiled query in slick, similar to https://github.com/slick/slick/issues/998

Is there any way to give joda mapper to Slick query compiler ?

I would expect subtracting two instants yields an interval, but it gives a type error:

```
LiteralColumn(Instant.now()) - record.loggedAt
```

> Error:(12, 91) value - is not a member of `scala.slick.lifted.LiteralColumn[org.joda.time.Instant]`
