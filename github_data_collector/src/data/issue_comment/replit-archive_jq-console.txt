Hi,

Is there an sample implemented somewhere that shows this console being connected to a bash shell on any server (localhost)? If not, would it be helpful to have that.

Like a modern day shellinabox equivalent.
Hey all,

I would love a little help setting up GA tracking on a site built with JQ-console. Would there be a way to track what strings people are inputting and which functions are executing as a result?

Thank you!

`SetKeyPressHanlder -> SetControlKeyHandler`

Would be great to have ability to set key combinations with `Alt`, `Shift`, `Cmd` etc, and keys like `F1`-`F10` or something.
- [jqconsole.RegisterShortcut](https://github.com/replit/jq-console#jqconsoleregistershortcut) is good but it works only with `Ctrl`.
- [jqconsole.SetKeyPressHandler](https://github.com/replit/jq-console#jqconsolesetkeypresshandler) works only with `key press` events.

`jqconsole` really missing some flexibility in this questions.
This could be resolved in [this way](https://github.com/coderaiser/key).

It looks like the `-old` adjective is there just for `jqconsole-old-prompt` while it should be placed also on `jqconsole-output`, `jqconsole-return` and `jqconsole-error`

For coherence.

Although this is clearly a jQuery plugin, I was wondering if there are plans to have this plugin work without jQuery. Example of a project that have this feature [masonry](https://github.com/desandro/masonry)

Currently, the library always echoes key strokes on the prompt. 

I was able to prevent this using the following code, but it would be great if it was optional.

`console.$prompt_left = $('<div></div>');`

The README.md says that the Prompt function "Takes three arguments", but it actually takes four:

JQConsole.prototype.Prompt = function(history_enabled, result_callback, multiline_callback, async_multiline)
