Adding a license.
Hello -

Thanks for the cool tool. Could you specify an open source license for the code? I'll submit a pull request for the MIT license to make things as simple as possible for you, but feel free to select your own. More info on choosing a license (and why it is important) here: https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/

Thanks again!
