I modified the calculateActiveItem method and the calculateMostVisibleItem method.
I think the call to the `deactivate` method should destroy the previous call to the `deactivate` method on the next display, which is more logical.

`    private void calculateActiveItem(ItemsPositionGetter itemsPositionGetter, ListItemData listItemData) {
        /** 1. */
        int currentItemVisibilityPercents = listItemData.getVisibilityPercents(mListItems);
        if (SHOW_LOGS) Logger.v(TAG, "calculateActiveItem, mScrollDirection " + mScrollDirection);

        /** 2. */
        ListItemData neighbourItemData = new ListItemData();
        switch (mScrollDirection) {
            case UP:
                findPreviousItem(itemsPositionGetter, listItemData, neighbourItemData);
                break;
            case DOWN:
                findNextItem(itemsPositionGetter, listItemData, neighbourItemData);
                break;
        }
        if (SHOW_LOGS)
            Logger.v(TAG, "calculateActiveItem, currentItemVisibilityPercents " + currentItemVisibilityPercents);

        /** 3. */
        if (enoughPercentsForDeactivation(currentItemVisibilityPercents) && neighbourItemData.isAvailable()) {

            // neighbour item become active (current)
            if (mOldItem == null) {
                mOldItem = mCurrentItem;
            } else {
                mCallback.deactivateCurrentItem(mListItems.get(mOldItem.getIndex()), mOldItem.getView(), mOldItem.getIndex());
                mOldItem = mCurrentItem;
            }
            /** 4. */
            setCurrentItem(neighbourItemData);
        } else {
            calculateMostVisibleItem(itemsPositionGetter, itemsPositionGetter.getFirstVisiblePosition(),
                    itemsPositionGetter.getLastVisiblePosition());
        }
    }`

While scrolling the next neighbour item is loaded. But i can't able to pause the video playing in the current view. While playing video if i scrolled next video is also playing. deactivateCurrentItem is not triggering onStateFling.

While scrolling, neighbour video is played but i want to release the video from current view and make the Thumbnail imageview visible. 

Please help me to solve this....
I'm trying to use your library for handling the playing one video at once. But there's a difference which I need to start the video whenever user clicked on play button.
I created an instance of `VideoPlayerManager` in my fragment and pass it to the Adapter in constructor.

In fragment :
```
private VideoPlayerManager<MetaData> mVideoPlayerManager = new SingleVideoPlayerManager(new PlayerItemChangeListener() {
    @Override
    public void onPlayerItemChanged(MetaData metaData) {

    }
});

public View onCreateView(@NonNull LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
     ...
   adapter = new FeedsAdapter(getContext(), mVideoPlayerManager);
     ...
}
```
In adapter:
```
public FeedsAdapter(Context context, VideoPlayerManager videoPlayerManager) {
        super(context);
        mVideoPlayerManager = videoPlayerManager;
}
```

Now whenever user clicks on play button, I call this inside the adapter itself:

```
public void onBindItemViewHolder(FeedViewHolder holder, int position) {
        ...
        holder.imageviewPlayVideo.setOnClickListener(v -> {
                mVideoPlayerManager.playNewVideo(null, holder.videoview, url)
        }
        ...
}
```

The problem is that the VideoPlayerView is completely blank and only the sound of the video is playing. What am I missing?
I want to fix the height of recyclerview item in xml. lets say 
` <com.volokh.danylo.video_player_manager.ui.VideoPlayerView

                android:id="@+id/player"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="200dp" />`

But it takes more than 70 percent of the screen. Is there any way to fix this height by user mentioned in xml.
