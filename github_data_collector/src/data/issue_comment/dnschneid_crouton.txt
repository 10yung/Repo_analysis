#### Please describe your issue:
The mouse and touchpad settings panel is greyed out on xfce so I'm unable to adjust the performance of the trackpad. Is this normal behaviour? Keyboard and other panels seem fine.

So, there isn't anything to copy and paste, but every time I open up Steam or Minecraft, the screen just flickers continuously. This only seems to apply to Minecraft, Steam, and any games downloaded off of Steam. It used to work fine, but now... It's just really annoying, especially since the flickering can become so terrible that games become unplayable. 
Any ideas on how to solve this?
I am using a Hewlett-Packard Chromebook, Model Name: CHELL with and m7 core. It is also on the Stable channel.

Hello, I'm just having trouble opening the shell in chrome.
I'm using an Asus C301 on which I installed and uninstalled a countless number of times crouton, so I could access crosh (shell), but overnight I encounter this problem.
Version 80.0.3987.39 (Build officiel) beta (64 bits)

> [Conseil de pro] Utilisez "Ouvrir dans une fenêtre" ou "Plein écran" pour éviter que le raccourci Ctrl+W ferme votre terminal.
[Conseil de pro] Consultez [crosh] pour plus d'informations.
crosh n'est pas compatible avec cette version de Chrome
La commande "crosh" s'est terminée avec le code d'état 1.
Reconnecter (r), sélectionner (c) une autre connexion ou quitter (x) ?

Would you be able to help me?

#### Please describe your issue: After my Chromebook died a couple of days ago, crouton has become nearly unusable. Chrome now runs terribly on crouton and has visual artifacts on launch. Minecraft now runs at a consistent 7fps, no matter what settings I use. It is most likely a memory issue, since whenever I go into task manager, I am usually at about 80% memory usage, and 100% cpu usage just my using the minecraft menu, because everything now takes loads of memory. I am quite certain that this is caused by the update, since my friend is also experiencing this problem.


#### If known, describe the steps to reproduce the issue: 

Crouton helps me a lot, but I wanna help more Chinese know about how to use it. So I plan to translate **README and some of the Wiki** into Chinese.  Considering about the Copyright ("All rights reserved" says README) , is it possible for me to do that?

#### Please describe your issue:

I put my asus chrome flipbook in developer mode, downloaded crouton and the extension. Im trying to enter the first command, shell, but it keeps giving a unknown command response. 
Im really not sure what im doing wrong, Help!

A minor issue... but when my bionic chroot is running in a chrome window (xiwi) on my Pixel Slate there is no 'C' icon on the shelf. Where it should be there is a small underline to indicate there is something there and the area is clickable but there is no icon. On my old Samsung chromebook there is an icon.

As I say... a minor issue. All else works great, but it would be nice to have the icon back.

(I have removed and reinstalled the extension without success)
