If this component is not drawing in your UIScene based application, simply change this line here:

https://github.com/cezarywojcik/CWStatusBarNotification/blob/swift/CWStatusBarNotification/CWStatusBarNotification/CWStatusBarNotification.swift#L267

With:

```swift
if #available(iOS 13.0, *) {
    if let firstScene: UIWindowScene = UIApplication.shared
    .connectedScenes.filter({ $0.activationState == .foregroundActive })
    .first as? UIWindowScene {
        self.notificationWindow = CWWindowContainer(windowScene: firstScene)
    }
} else {
    self.notificationWindow = CWWindowContainer(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)
}
```
This component is not working anymore on iOS 13, I am trying to find a solution for this but can't see anything ideal to fix it.

Edit: The component will not work if your app uses `UIScene`.

Hi, do you have any thoughts on enabling swipe to dismiss?
Slightly controversial, but looks nice over a standard `UITabBar`. Solves #107. — Offers the `CWNotificationStyleHomeIndicatorNotification` option.

The text in the notification should be vertically centered in the navigation bar, but referring to the notch.
Actually it is centered referring to both the notch and the status bar and the result is a terrible vertical offset in the text in the iPhone X notification.
Hi, 
I will be great if you update your code to swift 4 also
**UPDATE:** I've submitted my Pull Request with `CWNotificationStyleHomeIndicatorNotification`: https://github.com/cezarywojcik/CWStatusBarNotification/pull/111

**Previous messages:**

Out of curiosity I thought I'd try this library on the iPhone X:

... It works as expected, but also as expected the text is covered by the "notch" area.

A better option might be for those phones with the notch to use the "home indicator" area just temporarily at the bottom of the screen. Any thoughts or interest on this?
Sorry about this warning. But this is very serious.

I noticed that my device was very warm, so I decided to check the CPU usage. I was surprised when I saw the values floating between 99 and 120% JUST when a animated notification is triggered.

I just removed this component of my application and voila, the CPU usage floats around 5-20% on all features (uploading data, 1080p playback, data syncing...).

And yes, I was using this component as recommended. The source is the Swift version.

Here is a screenshot proving this issue:
