Due to oauth review requirements, need to stop using the embedded client ID and instruct users to create their own GCP project.

I LOVE this. It increases my productivity significantly. However, it would be so much better if I could specify where the generates slides are saved on my drive. Or even if I generate one time and move it, if I can push changes to the new location.

Are there any technical hurdles that I'm unaware of? I'd be happy to contribute code but want to make sure I'm not trying to build something you've already considered and decided against.
see
https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/changelog/#v0221-25th-april-2019

fixes https://github.com/gsuitedevs/md2googleslides/issues/54
Let's say I have a local image file called `my-code-doesnt-work.jpg` alongside my markdown slide and I simply add it to the slide like this:

```markdown
---
# Title

![](my-code-doesnt-work.jpg)
---
```

When I executed the converter, error message popped out as follows:

```
Unable to generate slides: { [Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'c:\c:\git\others\not-so-personal-notes\Stretch\slides\my-code-doesnt-work.jpg']
```

After some hacking I was able to pinpoint the cause to this line of code:
https://github.com/gsuitedevs/md2googleslides/blob/master/src/images/probe.ts#L62

I used `console.log` to print the `parsedUrl.pathname` and the result was

```
/c:/git/others/not-so-personal-notes/Stretch/slides/my-code-doesnt-work.jpg
```

Then it was passed to `fs.createReadStream(path);` and that's where the error came from.

I can hack it to resolve my issue by using `fs.createReadStream(path.substring(1));` but obviously it's not an ideal solution and I have no idea whether it will affect macos / linux or not. 

Any ideas?
I got everything working but the styles from highlight.js. It isn't a path issue, as I've tested for that... but whatever theme I choose it still just uploads the same way (white background with black text), even if I change the default theme to something else. I don't see any errors anywhere, it just seems to check for the style file and then ignore it. Any ideas? 
I tried to install on MacOSX Mojave 10.14.5 (18F132), but got this error message:

Thank you
When I apply bullet formatting to text in the two column layout slide the layout reverts to songle column.

```
---
# Two column layout

This is the left column

+ This is another row <-- Making this a bullet makes slide single column layout

{.column}

This is the right column

This is another row
```

I was expecting to create two columns of bulleted lists, side by slide on one slide.
