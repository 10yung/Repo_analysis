Resubmitting this pull request after I configured my email address for git on my new laptop :).

Hi Evan (er.. George, I guess?)  -- I made atomic-emacs bindings able to be toggled with shift-ctrl-space so that people can easily access key bindings in other packages that might conflict with atomic-emacs. I did this by making sure .atomic-emacs is in every key binding (except shift-ctrl-space).

Also, I made atomic-emacs auto-start and install bindings by default and I added a setting to control whether to do that.

Finally, I added a couple lines to Readme.md about shift-ctrl-space and the startup setting.
macOS 10.15, Atom 1.40.1, it covered by system's Alt-w I guess.
I realize this is not urgent and the package works as is, but I think the recommended way to create atom packages now is to use JavaScript/ES6 instead of CoffeeScript. Having the code in JS instead of CS has the advantage that many more people are familiar with JS than with CS (my case), besides the other network effects of using a more popular language. Also ES6 incorporated many of the improvements brought by CS. 

As a way to familiarize myself with the code I'm willing to convert it to JS and send PRs, but only if the maintainers are interested in this conversion.
