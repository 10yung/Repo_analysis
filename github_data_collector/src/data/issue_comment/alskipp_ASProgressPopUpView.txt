My project still needs to support iOS 7.x, so how can I use it or implement it on the system version prior to iOS 7?

Thanks in advance!

GitHub changed the way Markdown headings are parsed, so this change fixes it.

Here's what happens to my progress views when I scroll down then back up, am I doing something wrong ?

Thanks for the great control .. what is the easiest way to adjust the progress bar height ? I tried to skim through the code but couldn't find a suitable place .. in IB, it is hard-coded to 2 pixels but the value is disabled for editing .. Thanks

Would set the tooltip to be displayed below the progress bar?
