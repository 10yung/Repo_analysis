Hello,

I'm unable to install some packages on my system. Unfortunately, I have no idea if it's related to TinyTex or to a problem on CTAN or my system. 

If I try to get some information for a package, I get:

````
$ sudo tlmgr info tcolorbox
query_ctan_mirror: Programs not set up, trying wget
cannot contact mirror.ctan.org, returning a backbone server!

/home/usr/bin/tlmgr: signature verification error of /tmp/n5n1NkqSx8/dMDXufg6nC from http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb: cryptographic signature verification of
  /tmp/n5n1NkqSx8/9owzNeAhRv
against
  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.sha512.asc
failed. Output was:
gpg: Signature made Sat Nov 23 00:54:51 2019 UTC using RSA key ID 19438C70
gpg: BAD signature from "TeX Live Distribution <tex-live@tug.org>"

Please try from a different mirror and/or wait a few minutes
and try again; usually this is because of transient updates.
If problems persist, feel free to report to texlive@tug.org.
````

Perhaps the problem is the following: I kept my TinyTex installation, but I changed my linux distribution. Because Tinytex was on a separated partition, I was able to keep it. If I have to reinstall everything, there is no problem. But I must be sure I can reinstall everything. This week `tlmgr` updated some packages but did not complete all updates, and my latex system was broken. 

Thank you for your help.

Dear,

Trying to install tinytex within my R session I am aware that I do not fullfil requirements mentioned below, but as a total noob with R and tinytex I do struggle with this quit simple installation. Environment is R-Studio (freeware - Version 1.2.1335) with R 3.6.1 trying to install tinytex 0.16 with a non-root user (but with sudo rights) on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I experience errors mentioned in attached logs but for some reason I got a working tinytex (installed last year -> v0.9, R-studio Pro (v1.1.456, R3.5.2, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) on another server. I am totally puzzled and I think I can need some help?
[log_docstore_install_tinytex.log](https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/files/3699340/log_docstore_install_tinytex.log)

Thanks alot in advance and kind regards,

[This is the link to my question on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57861322/render-r-markdown-to-a-pdf-document-in-shiny-app-error-in-compiling). 

In this [**question on SO**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57802225/how-to-pass-table-and-plot-in-shiny-app-as-parameters-to-r-markdown), I was trying to pass table and plots as parameters to Shiny app, I tried [the answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57843199/5420677) 

**Reproducbile example**: 

report.Rmd

``````
---
title: "Dynamic report"
output: pdf_document
params:
  plotData: NA
  tableData: NA
  plotCode: NA
---

```{r}
params$tableData
```
```{r}
eval(parse(text = params$plotCode))
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(params$plotData, aes (x = carat, y = price, col = color)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~cut)
```
``````

App.R

```
library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
library(rmarkdown)
library(tinytex)

df <-  diamonds[1:5000, ]
head(df)
write.csv(df, "df.csv")

#setwd("....") #be sure to be in same directory
shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    sliderInput(inputId = "slider", label = "Slider", min = 1, max = 100, value = 50),
    fileInput(inputId = "file", label = "Upload your file"),
    downloadButton(outputId = "report", label = "Generate report")
  ),
  server = function(input, output) {
    data <- reactive({
      file1 <- input$file
      if(is.null(file1)){return()}
      read.csv(file1$datapath, header = TRUE, sep = ',')
    })

    table_rmd <- reactive({
      data() %>% 
        dplyr::select(cut, color, price) %>% 
        dplyr::group_by(cut, color) %>% 
        dplyr::summarise_all(funs(min(.), mean(.), median(.),max(.),sd(.), n() )) 
    })


    output$report <- downloadHandler(
      filename = "report.pdf",
      content = function(file) {

        tempReport <- file.path(tempdir(), "report.Rmd")
        file.copy("report.Rmd", tempReport, overwrite = TRUE)

        params <- list(plotData = data(), tableData = table_rmd(), plotCode = "plot(1)")

        rmarkdown::render(tempReport, output_file = file,
                          params = params,
                          envir = new.env(parent = globalenv())
        )
      }
    )
  }
)
```



but it resulted in the following error. I wonder what caused it and how it can be fixed 

```

More specifically this line runs, even though in the middle of tex packages installation/download my connection was cut out. 

I mean... It's pretty obvious eventually that it didn't run correctly, still it would be a slight improvement if there wasn't a contradicting message.

仅仅是个建议。

年度更新需要重装宏包。

可以在把旧版本删除之前，先把装过的宏包列表列出来

```sh
tlmgr list --only-installed
```

然后，在安装完新版本后，再把这些宏包全部装上。

或者说，这相当于维护一份常用宏包列表。

也许这个建议（给非 R 用户）可以在用户手册中加一下？

当然如果是 R 用户，这些是自动搞定的……
Hi,

The documentation claims that TinyTeX is portable, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

On Linux, it can be reproduced like this.

## 1. Install TinyTeX"

    wget -qO- "https://yihui.name/gh/tinytex/tools/install-unx.sh" | sh

## 2. Find all occurrences of the user's home directory

    grep -R --exclude="*.log" ${HOME} .TinyTeX/

In a portable installation, you would expect that there are no hardcoded paths. Yet, there are:

Dear Yihui,

Just a short question.

I was not able to get the right synthax to install TinyTex missing Latex packages from local.zip. I do not have the choice, because of my company firewall. 
I tried in R using `tinytex::tlmgr_install`, but it is obvouisly not the right one:

```
tlmgr install C:\Users\ancollet\Documents\7 - Software\R\Installation_float\float.zip
tlmgr.pl install: package - not present in repository.
tlmgr.pl install: package C:\Users\ancollet\Documents\7 not present in repository.
tlmgr.pl install: package Software\R\Installation_float\float.zip not present in repository.
tlmgr.pl: action install returned an error; continuing.
No connection to the internet.
Unable to download the checksum of the remote TeX Live database,
but found a local copy so using that.

You may want to try specifying an explicit or different CTAN mirror;
see the information and examples for the -repository option at
https://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html
(or in the output of install-tl --help).

tlmgr.pl: package repository http://ctan.math.washington.edu/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet (not verified: unknown)
tlmgr.pl: An error has occurred. See above messages. Exiting.
```

What should be the correct one ? I tried to understand from the [tlmgr guide](https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#install-option...-pkg), but I am a bit lost with the syntax and these concepts of repository etc.

I also tried to install the package directly to TinyTex in my appdata folder, unfortunately, I am not able to idendity the right "TEXMFHOME" directory to place my .sty and .pdf.
In a windows CMD, it gives me:
```
>kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME
$HOM./TinyTex/.TinyTe./TinyTex/texmf-home
```

Thank you in advance :)
tlmgr_search fails on a debian Docker image from R-hub (using r-devel) with the following error message:

```
> tlmgr_search("siunitx")
tlmgr search --file --global 'siunitx'
(running on Debian, switching to user mode!)
Cannot determine type of tlpdb from /home/docker/texmf!
tlmgr: running in usermode, did you call `tlmgr init-usertree'?
```

This causes automatic package installation to break.

I don't have the same problem on OS X using R 3.5.2.

Indeed, manually running `tlmgr init-usertree` seems to fix the problem.
Hello,
Is it posible to use the copy_tinytex and use_tinytex without being a R user?
Great work with TinyTeX, its really helpful!
Thanks a lot!
I find that in */R/latex.R*, there is `engine_args`, but no `bib_engine_args`.

somethimes, `bib_engine_args` is needed for `bib_engine`, such as https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues/651 or https://github.com/sjtug/SJTUThesis/issues/378 .We may need such args. 

Could you support it? Thank you.
