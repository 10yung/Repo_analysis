Hello. This is my first PR to an Open Source project, so please let me know if any of the content or description is unclear, or if you'd prefer any further changes.

I found your project via a work colleague, after I'd been investigating command-line simctl operation of Simulators. These changes are to implement useful new features for my workflow, that I thought might be useful for others as well.

This PR Adds the following features:
- Allows deletion (from disk) of simulators, or factory reset of one/many simulators.
- Allows shutdown of one/more/all booted simulators via the menu.
- Extra commands and UIAlerts for those commands.
- Added "Focused Mode", which will only list simulators with applications installed.
- Simulator list is sorted correctly by platform and version number (error in string comparison).
It seems to be broken on XCode 11
如果 可能的话 , 能不能加个  最近列表,  就是 最近 在模拟器 打开的 app的列表,  每次都去找一遍 , 感觉不是 很智能
