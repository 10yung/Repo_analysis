Hi

My app got rejected with following reason:
Your app uses or references the following non-public APIs:
- ‘GraphicsServices.framework’

Kindly help.

I have this code on my initial view controller and then on my second view controller but it only works on the first view controller.
       let halo = PulsingHaloLayer()
        halo.position = view.center
        view.layer.addSublayer(halo)
        halo.backgroundColor = UIColor.blue.cgColor
        halo.animationDuration = 3
        halo.repeatCount = 3
        halo.start()
        

Is it possible to make rings go inwards with animation? Like there will be big rings and then it get smaller and smaller?

I tried to reverse the line numbers 133 and 134 in PulsingHaloLayer.m like below:

scaleAnimation.fromValue = @1.0;
scaleAnimation.toValue = @(self.fromValueForRadius);

But this gives me weird blink effect.


Hello,

I'm having a specific issue in implementing PulsingHalo in my project. I don't think the issue is specifically related to PulsingHalo, but I'm at a loss for a solution. I've opened a StackOverflow question on this, if you would be okay with taking a look.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35844295/ios-layer-animation-stops-abruptly

The basic problem is that the animation, for some reason, starts fine for a few seconds then suddenly completely stops for a second or two, then restarts normally, over and over.

How to add this in google map marker?

I wished to initiate Halo Layer class as described in documentation. But there is any such method: 

[[PulsingHaloLayer alloc] initWithLayerNumber:3];

I want to move pulse as stroke circle. Pule effect of empty circle. 


I'm wondering if it's possible to change the color of the pulse whenever a new pulse is initiated? 

Any direction is highly appreciated. 

Thx.
