Does it possible to keep device id when i transfer app to another developer account?
Will two different apps in two different devices generate the same id?
ps: Key-value storage disabled ，two different bundle IDs
I use FCUUID as `NSString *deviceUUID = [FCUUID uuidForDevice];`，but` same ID，one iphone ，two UDID，log is  NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore error: com.xxx.xxx has no valid com.apple.developer.ubiquity-kvstore-identifier entitlement，can you help me?
Why is the ID generated by the two devices the same?
Hi Team,

First, thanks for the work!

Would you consider an update if I do a PR with [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) support?

Cheers,
Vincent
