Often the repository itself might contain packaged functionality in which case it needs to be installed itself. Currently, in this [demo research compendium](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/annakrystalli/rrcompendiumDTB/master?urlpath=rstudio), ([repo](https://github.com/annakrystalli/rrcompendiumDTB)), all dependencies are installed correctly but the additional functionality contained in the package itself is not and rendering of `paper.Rmd` fails

It would be great if there was either an option or even auto-installation of the repo if a `DESCRIPTION` file is present. 
Hello, 

I'd like to create a project session with some bioconductor libraries. But I'm having issue, I see this as a point in the roadmap. What is the problem exactly? Maybe I can help. 

Thanks,
Carlos Vivar Rios
Currently `write_compendium_description` writes all dependencies together. It would be more useful to separate out remotes and imports.
It would be good to mention that people can already run their work locally before making it public or when they need more resources by using https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/ which is the tech used on a BinderHub.

The advantage is that you are adding reproducibility from day one, not as an after thought when "everything is done now, just need to make it reproducible".
`holepunch` is magical! I am using it for https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake, and it makes the workshop materials so much more accessible. 

The setup was mostly smooth, but I hit a snag because of the dependency on TensorFlow. [`rocker/binder`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/binder) omits TensorFlow (and rightly so) so [`learndrake`'s own Dockerfile](https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake/blob/master/inst/notebooks/.binder/Dockerfile) borrows heavily from [`rocker/tensorflow`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/tensorflow). It works now, but it took some micromanaging to go through `apt-get` and `pip3` and make sure to invoke the correct user for each.

I an wondering if we can or should do anything in `holepunch`'s API to abstract away this sort of thing. Maybe have arguments in `holepunch::write_dockerfile()` to supply `apt` and `python` dependencies? Or maybe a `.holepunch.yml` file that borrows from `.travis.yml`?
