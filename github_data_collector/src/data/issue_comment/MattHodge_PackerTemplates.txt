Hi, thanks for this project. I noticed there is an unverified windows update exe being used

`https://www.dropbox.com/s/bk1dodl4fb7znj3/WUInstallAMD64.exe?dl=1`

Is there any reason for this?
I am trying to generate the Hyper-V vhdx file, however getting the below error message, Would you please check and advise.

Environment:- Windows 2016 Datacentre Server, installed with Hyper-V
Packer Version:- tried with 1.3.2-dev, & 1.2.5
ISO: Windows 2012R2

I've modified your answer xml file to work with my Windows10 Pro iso, and have been able to complete the first builder phase "virtualbox-01-windows-base", but the second phase "virtualbox-02-win_updates-wmf5" fails because WUInstallAMD64.exe fails with various errors*, causing powershell to exit with 11 meaning "at least one error occurred, reboot required". 

I noticed you run scripts/install_windows_updates.ps1 several times in a loop, with windows restarts each time. Any reason why you shouldn't add exit code 11 to "valid_exit_codes" in the win_updates  builder, so this builder will make a best effort at applying updates? I have done this in my fork of your (wonderful!**) repo. What I have found is that any of the various windows update errors that occur are all eliminated by the 2nd or 3rd reboot/WUInstall cycle.

* WUInstall errors I've seen so far are:
  1. "0x80240017 - WU_E_NOT_APPLICABLE - Operation was not performed because there are no applicable updates.
  2. Download failed

** I applaud your use of chaining phases to facilitate resumption of failed packer builds. :-)
First of all, thanks for all this great work - your packer templates are the cleanest I've seen!

I get the below error when running build.ps1. I'm running Windows 10 Pro.

```
PS C:\Users\tblack\src\PackerTemplates> .\build.ps1

Error: The assembly 'Cake.Yaml, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'
is referencing an older version of Cake.Core (0.22.0).
This assembly need to reference at least Cake.Core version 0.26.0.
Another option is to downgrade Cake to an earlier version.
It's not recommended, but you can explicitly opt-out of assembly verification
by configuring the Skip Verification setting to true
(i.e. command line parameter "--settings_skipverification=true",
environment variable "CAKE_SETTINGS_SKIPVERIFICATION=true",
read more about configuration at https://cakebuild.net/docs/fundamentals/configuration)
```

I tried changing the version from 22 to 26 in tools/Addins/Cake.Yaml.2.0.0/cake.yaml.nuspec, but that didn't help. (This is my first time using cake. I'm clueless)

I am able to get past the error with the suggested `build.ps1 --settings_skipverification=true`, but just wanted to make a note of this on your repo. Thanks again for all this good work!
