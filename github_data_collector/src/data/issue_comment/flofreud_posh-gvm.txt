Updated to latest API endpoints, fixed intermittent SSL/TLS failures, fixed API version file incompatibility and fixed all tests broken by the updates. Unzip-Archive has been updated to prefer powershell native Extract-Archive command if available and the unzip file structure changed to avoid issues with java install.
See topic - Somehow this repo was updated within a couple months yet the main page's info has not a single link as to how someone can even get started with GVM.
Hi
I failed to install posh-gvm with Import-Module ，I got the imformation as follow：

PS C:\Program Files\PowerShell\6.0.2\Modules> Import-Module posh-gvm
Import-Module : This command is not available in offline mode.
At line:1 char:1
+ Import-Module posh-gvm
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ CategoryInfo          : OperationStopped: (This command is...n offline mode.:String) [Import-Module], RuntimeException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : This command is not available in offline mode.,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.ImportModuleCommand


I have followed all the steps to set up the posh-gvm. When I get to the Import-Module posh-gvm I get an offline error. I have not found a fix for this and I need to learn groovy so I can create and troubleshoot ScriptRunner scripts. Is there a fix for this or a workaround? My JAVA_HOME is set so that is not the issue. I am stuck.
When i installed posh-gvm, i got following info:
```

Then i execute 'Import-Module posh-gvm -Force',
`Test-Path : Illegal character in the path`
```

I did a lot search, but got nothing useful.

Hi,

Hi guys, thank you for an awesome tool. I usually work on Linux and SDKMAN install is super easy on Linux.
I'm forced to work on Win 7 now and I was able to install PsGet but I get the following error trying to install posh. Do I need a JDK initially to install posh? I will give it a try anyways and let you guys know what happens.

when i run import-module posh-gvm it attempts to connect to a url. if offline, break-line causes an exception (the value of the property 'break_line' is null or undefined, not a Function object) then wants me to debug with visual studio.

if i say yes, the offending line indicates a connection to http://api.sdkman.io/app/version is being attempted. this url is not available (proxy servers are annoying).

If i then say "stop debugging", i get a powershell error "This command is not available in offline mode"

so, presumably, posh-gvm isn't available offline (which is annoying), nor does it work properly behind a proxy server (or at least with MY proxy server).... makes the tool less than optimal, shall we say.

the code should more gracefully handle being offline (e.g. should not display "Webpage error; do you want to debug?" dialog box
