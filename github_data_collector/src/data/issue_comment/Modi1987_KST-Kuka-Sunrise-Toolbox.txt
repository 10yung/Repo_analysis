Hi, I follow the youtube video here, really great work.

Our lab recently borrowed an iiwa 14R and would like to use it for some project.
However, the original lab didn't buy the sunrise.servoing module, so we cannot control this robot from ROS, as mentioned here (https://github.com/IFL-CAMP/iiwa_stack/wiki).

For your package, does it also need the module?

Thanks.
Hi, Dr. Safeea,
I’m Tian. After dealing with the previous problems, we run the demos in the KST, which are really wonderful! However, not every demo can be run successfully, such as the ‘KSTclass_Tutorial_realTimeImpedencePlotTorqueFeedBack.m’. 
Our tool mass is 2.3 kg, the COM is [-8,0,65] mm. The parameters are found in our gripper manual. Firstly, we use these parameters, but some errors appear in the SmartPad and the matlab, which said 'java.lang.IllegalStateException:Load Mass Validation Failed axisTauExtMsr[1] of LBRExtTorque@LBR_iiwa_14_R820_1 is 12.171958888630373 should be less than 10'. The errors are shown below. I have also tried to modify and use different tool parameters in the matlab code, but it does not work.  Besides, I also search the solution in Google and Github, but I find no solution to this.
In addition, about the KST gamepad demos, we can run them successfully, and we can use the left handle of gamepad to select different axis of iiwa, but we cannot move the joints by using the right handle of gamepad. We really don’t know why.
We will appreciate your help very much if you can help us analyze these problems! Especially the impedence control demo!
I’m really sorry to disturb you so much and looking forward to your reply.
Best regards,
Tian Xu.

Dear Dr. Safeea,
I’m following your KST tutorials and I encounter some problems.
I’m now trying to import KST to SunriseWorkbench (Version 1.7). But there are some error icons near the copied java files. I have added the Direct Servo Motion Extension and Smart Servo Motion Extension in the StationSetup.cat, however, the errors still exist. The specific error messages are listed in the attachment below. 
I have tried to select different media flange when establishing a new project and to use different KST version from KST_1.6 to KST_1.7, but they are no use. Could you help me analyze the reasons of the problems that I have? I really don’t know how to deal with it.
Thanks a lot.
Tian Xu.

Hello there,

I was following your video tutorials because I am interested in the hand guiding system. However, I get an error. Specifically with the "_PTPmotionClass.java_" file. Sunrise tells me that it can't import "com.kuka.generated.ioAccess.MediaFlangeIOGroup". The exact message is:

> The import com.kuka.generated cannot be resolved

I search everywhere on the internet but I cannot find any information about this module.

Do you know why the code is having this problem on my computer?

Thanks in advanced.
Hi,
May I ask you some questions about the configuration of iiwa.
1.Which software packages should I install in iiwa if I want to do researches about force and torque？
2.Did you use FRI in your researches?
I would appreciate it if you could help me.
Hi,

I‘ve already synchronized the MatlabToolboxServer .But when I run it,the program doesn't work and the error is about lbrExampleApplications-BackgroundTask.java in line 79 196 and some Unknown Source.I just add the KST_1.6_iiwa7R800_Universal_noFlange in the old lbrExampleApplication in an old sunrise project,because my classmate says create a new project would cover other's program.And when I copy the KST_1.7_iiwa_universal_noFlange_LTS and choose the software Direct and Smart,the PTPmotionClass.java has some problems that can't synchronize.
And when I establish the connection in Matlab,it works and show the 'Connection established',but the next line show that 'Could not attach the tool to the  Robot'.
Someone says maybe the Java program has some problems,but I watch the tutorials that you could work.So I just wanna seek some advice if it is our iiwa's problems or I should change some softwares or so on.

Thanks a lot.
Hi, I really like your toolbox. Thanks so much for sharing this!

I was trying to run some of your examples and I found out that a function was missing for the SpaceMouse Tele-operation example script.

`mouseSpeed = speed(MOUSE, vector);` gave me an error. If this is expected, would you be able to share this `speed` function?

Thanks!

I am going to test your toolbox. The aim is to control the robots from a VR headset. However, right now I am struggling in synchronizing the MatlabToolboxServer onto the iiwa controller. 

The project shows no errors, but when the synchronization begins, it fails in the middle with the following warning. 

"The child nodes of catalog elements 'RootItem path="com.kuka/Project", usage=Topology, selection=1, Username: Project' and 'RootItem path="com.kuka/Project", usage=Topology, selection=1, Username: Project' are not compatible between the projects to be synchronized" 

Can you check what could be the reason. I will try to check this on my own as well and update if I find a solution.
