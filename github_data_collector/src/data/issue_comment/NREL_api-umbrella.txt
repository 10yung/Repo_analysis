Docker build fails while running
```
$ curl --location --retry 3 --fail --remote-name https://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLite2-City.tar.gz
```
I'm guessing this is due to https://blog.maxmind.com/2019/12/18/significant-changes-to-accessing-and-using-geolite2-databases/ 

Any hints on how to solve?
how to reset Api-Umbrella's superuser admin password.
When tried got 500 internal server error 
@GUI 
hello,

We are testing the Umbrella API, but we are having difficulty that our server is below a firewall, so Umbrella is not identifying the client IP that connects to the application, but rather the IP of the firewall itself.

I searched in several places and could not find a solution.

Is there any parameterization that could change to display the remote client IP correctly?

Thanks, and waiting
hello,
We are an IT company where we have multi systems we are using such us:
1- DNN (.Net on windows server)
2- Wordpress (PHP on Linux server)
3- Moodle (PHP on Linux server)
4- ERPNext (Python on Linux Server)
5- RocketChat (JS on linux server)
6- Etc...

We need to integrate these systems together; Integrations should be done on 2 levels:
- Basic Integration:
	- Register, so when user register in any system, the user is registered in all systems.
	- Login, so when user login in any system, the user is logged in all systems.
	- Logout, so when logout in any system, the user is logged out in all systems.
	- Edit profile, so when user edit his profile in a system the, the user profile is updated inn all systems.
	- Etc...
- Advanced Integration:
	- Notifications: when user get notification on a system, he gets the notification in all systems.
	- Calendars: when user add an entry to calendar in a system, the entry added in other calendars. 
	- Etc...

Questions:
1- Does your system allow doing that? if yes, do you have high end interface allow doing that without coding, or it needs development skills?
2- Do you have video tutorials and training? if yes, where and how to access them?
3- Do you have commercial support? if yes, what are the plans?
Thanks, and waiting
After pulling the code and running `docker-compose up`, I receive this error:
```
+ gem update --system 2.7.9 --no-document --env-shebang

I've tried to install `zlib` via brew, but still no luck.

I'm running this on Ubuntu 18

Any help would be awesome :)
Hi there, 

I am looking to stop the redirects to HTTPs and effectively not listening on HTTPs as we have an nginx server in front of API-Umbrella.

Is there config for this?

Many thanks,



I'm using docker version `0.15.1`

And using AWS ES version 7.1

With `api-umbrella.yml` file:

```
services:
  - general_db
#  - log_db
  - router
  - web
elasticsearch:
  hosts:
    - "https://vpc-..............es.amazonaws.com"
  index_name_prefix: api-umbrella
  index_partition: monthly
  index_mapping_type: log
  api_version: 7
  template_version: 2
```

However i seen it's only write logs to ES, but can't get logs for analytics in here!

What's i can do it?
I am interested in the possibilities of cloning my back end to handle more server load. I have seen multiple references to having those capabilities, but nothing concrete on what the options are, and how to set them up.

Would this be something you could write up a doc sub-page under Website Backends? (https://api-umbrella.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/website-backends.html)

An example of the configuration, description of how it will route requests between the multiple backends, round robin, any other strategies it supports....

Thanks
@GUI 
1. Is there any way to disable user API-key after a period of time( for eg: a user has taken a subscription for 1 month, I want the API key to be disabled after 1 month)? I can write a code for that but I just want to know whether there is any in-built functionality is available?
2. How can I control API requests for each APIs? 

e.g. -
User has a 1000 daily API key limit.
how can I manage API rate limiting using API-key as 

1. For 1st API only 100 API requests
2. For 2nd API only 500 API requests
3. For 3rd API only 400 API requests

@brylie have you faced any similar issue?
