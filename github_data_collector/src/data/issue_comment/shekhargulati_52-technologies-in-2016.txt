working on week 39: Docker in my Ubuntu machine. Encountered with an ssh related error. Here are two StackOverflow links to share the similarity.

Though I could not find the solution yet, found one workaround .

**precise command:**
`git clone https://github.com/shekhargulati/taskman.git`

please add this option to your readme file along with the original command

`git clone git@github.com:shekhargulati/taskman.git`
