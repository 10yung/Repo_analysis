As currently we can use spring/gravity for `bounceOut` or `elasticOut`, but can we do `bounceIn` or `bounceOut`, also `InOut` would be interesting as well.
Hello there, 

First of all i would like to express my gratitude for this amazing library, also I'm a big fan of your work.

I was playing around with dynamics.js for the first time and noticed that my code does not work on chrome, but does on firefox, the code that throws the error is the following:
```
dynamics.animate(el, {
      background: "red"
});
```

the error is the following: 
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'rgb' of undefined
    at e.interpolate (dynamics.min.js:1)
    at e.interpolate (dynamics.min.js:1)
    at t.interpolate (dynamics.min.js:1)
    at t.interpolate (dynamics.min.js:1)
    at q (dynamics.min.js:1)
    at m (dynamics.min.js:1)
    at P (dynamics.min.js:1)
```

I'm Not sure if it's something that I'm doing wrong, if yes then i can't figure it out.

This PR:

* Modernises all dependencies (couldn't get it to build on my machine with the existing ones)
* Fixes a bug where calling `dynamics.stop` in `complete` for example with another interleaved animation in place caused a crash. Also added a test. This happens frequently when combined with react animations since the react lifecycle `componentWillLeave(callback)` will call `componentWillUnmount` once `callback` is called (synchronously) which usually should call `dynamics.stop`. 
Hello,

I'm just playing around with your nice library...
very cool!

but is it somehow possible to rotate arround the x axis?

rotateX has no effect.

I'm trying to use dynamics.js and in my example i'm using it with hammer.js.

Everything works so far, but the complete-callback fires when animate starts, not when it ends.

I have the example on codepen
[Codpenexample](https://codepen.io/ingomc/pen/jmZvGE)

Do i do something wrong or is it a bug?
Hello, need simple example. Example: change background color. Thank you.
I try to use css percent value and the result is bad. The animate func try to animate to the value, if you put 50% on a width for example, it will translate to 50px and in the end of animation set 50%. Strange result

For example Android 4.4 doesn't supports document.visibilityState without the webkit prefix, creating an animation with a delay will never be triggered on these devices because `isDocumentVisible` will not return false.
Is it an idea to check for `'visibilityState' in document` and then return the document visibility or true for older browsers?

Open this example
http://dynamicsjs.com/examples/pin.html

And leave it for ~10 minutes.
In my case (Chrome, Windows, DevTools open) the `svg` slowly grows bigger than the `.pin`.
Maybe that's because the previous `transform3d` is not identity matrix when the new `transform3d` is applied.
