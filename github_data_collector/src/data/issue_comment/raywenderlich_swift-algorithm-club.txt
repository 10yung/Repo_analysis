### Description

<!-- In a short paragraph, describe the PR --> 
I updated the Linked List data structure. Because the time complexity of previous version is O(n) to get the tail node and count the total number of node. I updated this to get these in time complexity of O(1). Because this is the actually optimal solution for double linked list, which make O(n) solution a little bit misleading.

Tried to simplify some sentences without removing the casual tone of the documentation. Sometimes less is more. Hope this helped!
