I am able to set some syntax highlighting rules with `textEditor.SyntaxHighlighting.MainRuleSet.Rules.Add()` Unfortunately, changes to this list are not applied to the editor on the fly and I haven't found any method to trigger a refresh once the editor is loaded.

I intended to use AvalonEdit to highlight multiple user defined values in log files. Is this possible?

Best regards,
   Carsten
There would be no way to use the mono project to compile projects made on Sharpdevelop.
You could implement the Dot42 project so that you can generate Android and do the same things that Visual studio does and update that project.
Hi everyone,  
I'm using AvalonEdit since more than 2 years without problems and it work great  
I'm just facing one issue on changing text from background thread  
using SetOwnerThread() method trigger VerifyAccess() Exception every time even when called from main thread  
If I do everything in the main thread it work but this also freeze the UI
It's why I want to do it in another thread and show a loading indicator to the user
I can't seem to understand what i'm doing wrong here  
Any help or idea will be greatly apprecied  
Thanks in advance  

Sample code 
```c#
public async void EditTextSample()
{
	Thread lUiThread = Thread.CurrentThread;

	//SelectedTab is the current tab viewed by the user in my application
	SelectedTab.TextEditor.Document.SetOwnerThread(null);

	await Task.Run(() => 
	{
		Thread lBackgroundThread = Thread.CurrentThread;

		SelectedTab.TextEditor.Document.SetOwnerThread(lBackgroundThread);

		string lNewText = ""
		SelectedTab.TextEditor.Document.Text = lNewText;

		SelectedTab.TextEditor.Document.SetOwnerThread(lUiThread);
	});
}
```

Hi!
When using a RectangleSelection, using the Alt keyboard and mouse, while having collapsed sections, causes exception.  I've put both exceptions in this issue, since they seem to be related.

First exception is: an InvalidOperationException with the message "_Line 42 was skipped by a VisualLineElementGenerator, but it is not collapsed.",_ 

**Repro**:
- Launch Sample application, and have text:

> Welcome to AvalonEdit!
> if
> {
> }
> 	
> if 
> {
> }

- Using the Alt keyboard key, select from the first line and column, to the last line, and after the last bracket (selecting only 1 char wide).

- Collapse the first section
- Press delete. Boom.

Second related exception ArgumentOutOfRangeException with: "_0 <= offset <= 1550
Parameter name: offset
Actual value was 1987."_

**Repro:**
- Input same text as previous exception.
- Collapse both sections
- Using the Alt keyboard key, select past the first character and take a few on the right.  And go down all the way.

- Press Delete

I haven't found any quick fixes or workarounds for this.

Let me know if you have any clues or any tips to have that fixed.
Thanks

This removes the "extra" selection visible at the start of the next line, referenced in issue  #199. The existing paint logic is inconsistent with Visual Studio (and just about all other editors, AFAIK). I have been using this code in my fork for over a year, and it appears to work fine. But note that I haven't tried to address corner cases. For example, if word wrap is turned on, and the last character selected is a space, and the line breaks on that space, the fix won't apply (a fairly extreme corner case). There may be other corner cases that aren't addressed, such as an image on the last line, etc.
