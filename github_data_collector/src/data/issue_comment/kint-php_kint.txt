It would be very helpful if there would be a copy-to-clipboard button (icon), especially for the "Show access path" textbox.
Nowadays the document.execCommand('copy')  function is widely supported, so this shouldn't be much of a problem and would help avoid many repetitive steps!
Might even be as simple as using double click to copy, although in this case the user would need to know about that functionality first, of course.
I have file tst.php
```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
d([1, 2, 3]);
```
run this file in cli with php-kint v3

Why data displaying is not correct in php-kint v3?
Make xml access paths out of xpaths? I'm not sure if this is properly doable but if not I'll scratch this idea
SimpleXML currently doesn't, not sure about domdocument
`d()` without an argument just returns "No argument" so it is not really used.
So why not using `d()` for the debug backtrace because it feels more intuitive than `d(1)`
is it possible to have a configuration which uses `xdebug_get_function_stack` instead of `debug_backtrace` ?
