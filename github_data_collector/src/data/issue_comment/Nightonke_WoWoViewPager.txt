i am afraid will it work on low end devices with less ram and cpu and gpu power?. 
It worked on our development devices lenovo zuk z1.  But on higher end devices it is working fine.


Hi and many thanks for your library. I just want to know how to create a right svg file from png image and how to use a svg file? Many thanks
can this lib combine with text and pager indicator? Because in my requirement every page will have image on top (animated), text (desc), pager indicator with skip and next button. 

In WoWoActivity : 
```
        wowo.setAdapter(WoWoViewPagerAdapter.builder()
                .fragmentManager(getSupportFragmentManager())
                .count(fragmentNumber())                       // Fragment Count
                .colorsRes(fragmentColorsRes())                // Colors of fragments
                .build());
```
How we set custom adapter to achieve my requirement?
Thank you
:)
