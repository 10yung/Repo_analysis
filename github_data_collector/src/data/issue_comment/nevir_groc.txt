Upgraded jade to pug.
added vuejs extention.
Hey Guys,

when I use groc for doc generation, it does not add a new line at the end of file. This is a big hassle for us as we push those files to git. 

Is there an easy way to add that. 

No longer always points to master

This patch adds support for the subject file types.

if the current file is of type markdown (.md), don't show the wide source div, but use all space in the browser
for the documentation.

The implementation adds a `data-extension=<extension>` attribute to the html body, and has some minor additions in
`lib/styles/default/style.sass` to get rid of the two-column layout for .md files

hey fellas! :)

i added support for the [Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) css preprocessor language

Did I miss something or glob parameter do not support negative paths as exclude from array into `.groc.json`?

Some example to clear minds:

```
"glob": [
  "src/**/*.coffee", "!src/**/*.spec.coffee",
  "gulp/**/*.coffee", "!gulp/**/*.spec.coffee",
  "README.md"
],
...
```

This adds support for the Gherkin language used by Cucumber.

Is there a way to use HighlightJS styles out of the box or do I have to create an entire groc skin?

Thanks for a great library!
