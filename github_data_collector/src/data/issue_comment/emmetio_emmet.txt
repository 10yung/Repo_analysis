Hi,

For some reason the following emmet does not work.

```
table>(tr.prefix-intro>td*1)+(tr.prefix-pro-con>th*1+td*3)+(tr.prefix-key-specs>th[colspan=2]*1+td[colspan=2]*3)+(tr.prefix-key-find-online>th[colspan=2]*1+td*2)
```

Following sub-parts of above expression work.
```
table>(tr.prefix-intro>td*1)+(tr.prefix-pro-con>th*1+td*3)+(tr.prefix-key-specs>th[colspan=2]*1+td[colspan=2]*3)
```

The last part works on its own.
```
tr.prefix-key-find-online>th[colspan=2]*1+td*2
```

Is there a length limitation in emmet preventing the above from working together?

Also is there an emmet validator available?
When I open a `pug`-file and use `html:5` emmet,
it produces `<!DOCTYPE html>` in the first line instead of using the `pug`'s [doctype shortcut](https://pugjs.org/language/doctype.html#doctype-shortcuts)

How can i change default tag? such as: 
before: `.demo  =>  <div class='demo'></div>`
after: `.demo  =>  <view class='demo'></view>`
Make sure given abbreviation `a[#0]` produces `<a href="#0">`
I see there are actions like `split` and `join`. I'd be great to be able to strip away an elements attributes with a command, or even specific attributes, eg just `style` or `class`. Instead of manually selecting, deleting, etc. Even better if it can be done over multiple elements, a block of html.

`<div class="foo" yada yada>` -> strip - >  `<div>`

@sergeche 

Consider the abbreviation `minh`.
Below are the snippet keys that have the highest score of 0.41666667 when fuzzy matching
- `mir`
- `mih`
- `miw`

Shouldnt `mih` get a higher score than the other 2 given the fact it is the only one that has `h` from the abbreviation?
When or will i ever expect to see support for .gohtml files which are basically files used for html templating in golang(go) language?
I'm using ST3 on Windows, whenever I type CSS or SCSS in seperate file or in `<style>` tags, Emmet causes:

> error: plugin_host has exited unexpectedly, plugin functionality won't be available until Sublime Text has been restarted

and I can't use other plugin since I restart ST. This is really inconvenient thing slows down my work. How can I do?
Im using VSCODE, this example speak it self, I can't find how to activate emmet in this situation please ? :)
