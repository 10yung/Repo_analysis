Hi, Thank you for your script. I have a macbook pro (early 2015)(High Sierra) and a MSI Gaming X video card (Nvidia 1050 Ti). Following this instruction: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/277356/machine-learning-on-external-gpu-with-cuda-and-late-mbp-2016/300876#300876. 

After "Install GPU driver" Step 7, I still can not find 1050 Ti, the only video card shown in my System is still Intel Iris.

It's any possible reason to make this situation occurs?

Thank you
Hi, i've been able to install egpu in 17 inch MBP 2011 using expresscard, egpu is working kexts are loaded, and Adobe Premiere now support CUDA rendering, but I'm unable to enable display output.
So can you make your tool also available on expresscard? 
I tried this when I had a Nvidia eGPU. But I no longer have this eGPU and I have been unable to uninstall it even though I tried many times the uninstall instructions

I get this popup every time I boot now

Can anyone tell me how to completely remove automate-eGPU?



Using 10.12.6 Sierra, installed and verified that it recognizes GPU and CUDA. it ran with CUDA acceleration with TensorFlow. Thank you very much for the wonderful software!

The only thing not working is driving an external display on 1080Ti. I am wondering I missed something during installation. Would you please help?
10.13.1 not working
I have an Akitio Node Thunderbolt 3 with a GTX670 GPU inside. I have a MacBook Pro 15" MID 2014 with an integrated GT750m running MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra).

After running the automate-eGPU script I was unable to boot into MacOS. 
Therefore I manually installed the latest Nvidia Web drivers from https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/nvidia-releases-alternate-graphics-drivers-for-macos-high-sierra-10-13-0-378-10-10-10-15.225522/

After running the automate-egpu script again, I was able to get further with booting but stuck on a spinning wheel.
I can boot into MacOS without the thunderbolt port plugged in.
I am also able to boot up with the thunderbolt port plugged in and Akitio Node switched off, once booted I turn it on and I think it may be running... as the system will crash if I pull out the thunderbolt port.
I am also unable to view the Graphics/Displays in "About this Mac" system report, it just hangs.

When running the automate-eGPU script I am also getting an error with "Detecting eGPU" as it displays "<p class='itemname'>Deletion request", I feel like this may be causing the error???

Is there something I am doing wrong? Any help would be amazing, thank you.







Fixed string output of the word Nvidia to uppercase with NVIDIA.
Now I am staying somewhere with shitty internet I downloaded pkg file from somewhere else then my home but I could not use the file. I think the addition would be a handy one
