Hi,

the chooseDataServer module will by default drop the ID column of an imported dataset. The user needs to point and click to retain it. Would it be possible to add an option to programmatically direct whether the ID column should be retained or not by default?

Thank you
Id love to use esquisse more but linix systems seem to need some external dependencies that esquisse doesnt manage as part of the package installation. These are:

1. libfontconfig1-dev which needs to be installed with: sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1-dev
2. Cairo needs to be installed with: sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev a
3. Also do sudo apt-get install libxt-dev

These need to be run before esquisse is useable. Is it possible to incorporate these in to the package installation process?
Hi there,

when importing a data frame with some cells being empty, esquisse does not turn these into NAs. Later, filters won't show empty cells as one of the possible levels of factor for filtering. Dataframe rows where one of the cell is empty are automatically removed, because "empty" is not a selectable level of a factor, but it is not NA either.

Thanks 
esquisse won't work on my version of R

Are there any thoughts on providing calculated fields?

For example in the "Select a dataset" entry: 

1. Select variables to keep: `carat, color`
2. Calculate variable: `mean_carat = group_by(color) %>% mean(carat)`; 


 
I have tried downloading the package using 
install.packages("esquisse")
and 
remotes::install_github("dreamRs/esquisse")
and i am getting the following error:

When launching esquisser() from R markdown code chunk, it is impossible to load variables from the chosen dataframe. This is not an issue if esquisser() is launched from the Rstudio console.

It would be great to use several simultaneous scaling options for the same axis, for example reverse axis and log10 scaling.
Would it be possible to have the information of the point where the mouse cursor is (as for plotly)?
Hi, with release 0.2.2 of esquisse I get the following error while selecting any transformation apart from identity (log10, log2, etc.):
Error : could not find function "scale_x_continuous"
