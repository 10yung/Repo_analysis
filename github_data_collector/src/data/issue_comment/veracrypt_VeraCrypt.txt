Hello,
Since version 1.24, Veracrypt can encrypt the keys and passwords in the RAM on Windows. I think this nice feature is helpful on other platforms, too. Is it possible to implement this nice feature for Linux, MacOS etc? Thank you very much!
It seems that Windows 10 update from yesterday (2020.01.16) broke the boot loader.

Is above mentioned problem related to following?

Veracrypt shows perfectly useful with encrypted devices or partitions formated winbtrfs, however, to unleash btrfs software raid1 potential its necessary to show mounted devices or partition as PNP device which Veracrypt unfortunately doesn't. 

I thought this to be an [issue within winbtrfs rather than Veracrypt](https://github.com/maharmstone/btrfs/issues/221) - however,  I find [maharmstone's](https://github.com/maharmstone) explanation quite convincing. Do you share his view?
This has already been posted, but the sourceforge bugtracker doesn't seem to be getting much attention:
https://sourceforge.net/p/veracrypt/tickets/263/

As the description implies, handling of memory disks has changed on recent FreeBSD versions, which hasn't been corrected in Veracrypt yet.
I haven't tested if this actually works with FAT partitions, as described by the original reporter.

Still, i need this for work, and would be willing to look into it.
I would appreciate some guidance though, where to look for the thing that went wrong here.
If someone would have access to my pc unlocked, would a memory dump of just the veracrypt.exe process be enough to recover the master keys, or is a full memory dump needed?
Recently I switched my Bitlocker encryption to VeraCrypt (VeraCrypt version 1.24-Update2, Multiboot with ubuntu MATE), which worked after I got GRUB to list the VeraCrypt bootloader :).

Now I created a new WindowsRE recovery partition (see attached screenshot with information).

Afterwards **I try to enable the WinRE recovery partition via `reagentc /setreimage /path R:\Recovery\WindowsRE`, which fails with an error 3** and which is logged in C:\Windows\Logs\ReAgent\ReAgent.log:

So it seems the error is caused by `winreGetDiskSignature ` and/or `pEnumeratePartitions`. I found a helpful entry in another forum [https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/0e8f31a0-df98-4ffe-8de5-639b82bbff31/reagentcexe-failed-to-enumerate-disk-signature](url), where a person is observing a similar problem (well `reagentc /info` is working for me).

@idrassi **Could this be related to some IOCTL_XYZ stuff (e.g. IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY) that is missing in VeraCrypt?**
The VeraCrypt Expander (v1.24) supports only integer value as size.

In addition, an entered value [in KB, MB, GB, or TB] for the size is not automatically converted when the unit is changed.
I'm on Linux with the latest VeraCrypt. I've used a 1TB USB HDD and tried to create a hidden volume. First the outer volume got created and then VeraCrypt asks me for the size of the hidden volume. I tells me that I can use 931 GiB. When I enter 600 GiB "Next" is grayed out. "Next" is greyed out for every value bigger than 7 GiB.

What am I doing wrong, or is this a bug?

LXrunoffline does not work on Veracrypt due to lack of support for "IOCTL_MOUNTDEV_QUERY_STABLE_GUID"?
 #388 implemented very promising new quick format functionality, thank you. As discussed, the process will still take time for the operating system to reserve the filespace, which can still take multiple days for a large external drive (which can now be at least 10 TB) - [mine](https://www.storagereview.com/node/4712) is still ongoing after ~50 hours. However, one new negative to the new functionality is that there is no status displayed during this process. At present, during this process it appears the Volume Format screen shows "Done: 100%", but with the only button not disabled being an "Abort" button. Is it possible to get/display any additional information about the status?

> when VeraCrypt tells Windows to create a file with a given size (e.g 250 GB), VeraCrypt do this by calling a single function but Windows will need a lot of time depending on the filesystem users because Windows will have to reserve the physical space on the disk and deal with disk fragmentation. This explains why this simple operation can take a lot of time.
