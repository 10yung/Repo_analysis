Isn't "break" more appropriate than "$finished" variable?
In lib/Worker.php  line:215 in Function work():
I think it should check pcntl_wifexited first before pcntl_wexitstatus.
Because pcntl_wexitstatus is meaningless if pcntl_wifexited return false.
For example, kill the child process would result in this case.

Hi,all 
in command line ,I run ` QUEUE=message php   vendor/bin/resque`;then I push many task into queue .but only one queue was execute.others also in queue.not execute.
anyone can help me ?

I found out that chrisboulton/php-resque is finally marked as abandoned.

Can you please change the description to:
```
This package is abandoned and no longer maintained. The author suggests using the resque/php-resque package instead.

```

and then mark this project as archived.

It will help others.
`QUEUE=*` AND `BLOCKING` will crash workers sometimes, because there is no queue exists, when `Resque_Job::reserveBlocking($emptyQueues, $timeout)` was invoke, the following error will be shown:

> PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught CredisException: wrong number of arguments for 'blpop' command in /home/razon/Develop/Projects/php-resque/vendor/colinmollenhour/credis/Client.php:1167

## Reproduce

1. FLUSHALL redis database - In order to clear the set `prefix:queues`.
2. EXEC `BLOCKING=1 VERBOSE=1 COUNT=2 QUEUE=* bin/resque`
Full message
```
 PHP Warning:  fread(): Length parameter must be greater than 0 in vendor/chrisboulton/php-resque/lib/Redisent/Redisent.php on line 127
```
The work has been completed.  Resque_Job_Status Throughout STATUS_RUNNING.
... instead of testing an unused variable

this change allows us to pass a credis_cluster object as $server and thus use a preconfigured sentinel setup.
and it is already tested in production

best regards.
