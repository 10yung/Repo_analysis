This was a great video and sample project for understanding the new authorization classes available to dotnet core. Thanks for putting it together. I would love to see unit tests for the controllers, handlers etc... 

Amended info...
I found an example of unit testing custom authorization here: https://github.com/henningst/ASPNETCore-AuthorizationDemo

One of my last open ended questions is with unit testing the Controllers. I have a moq IAuthorizationService created and I pass that into the constructor. However, that really is not testing if the controllers have the write policies or authorizationService logic correct. Do you have suggestions for unit testing this?
