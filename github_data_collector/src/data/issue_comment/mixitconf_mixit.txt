A few improvement suggestions on the talks list, especially for https://mixitconf.org/en/2019:

- [ ] the click on the header on an opened block should collapse it
- [ ] the click on the favourite icon should not scroll to the top of the page, nor collapse all the other talks blocks

Tested on Firefox 65.0.1

When tweeting a talk detail page like https://mixitconf.org/2018/les-dessous-d-un-embargo-de-securite, the Twitter card is empty (see https://twitter.com/mixitconf/status/992376164458139649):

In fact, there is no `<meta name="description">` header.

It would be nice to have the "short description" of the talk as meta description.
Same for profile page, which could include the bio as meta description.

I really appreciate that you offer an API to easily access the conference info. That being said, if I remember correctly, thatâ€™s the third year in a row that the API is changed significantly (different URLs, different data structure).

Iâ€™m probably over-thinking this (feel free to tag this as super-low-priority), but at this point, I think it would be great to add some kind of API versioning support. So if you decide to change the API next year, apps could handle the migration gracefully.

Practical suggestions:
- Specify HTTP header value (`Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v2 + json`)
- Specify custom HTTP header (`X-MyAPIVersionRequest-Header: 2`)
- Insert version number in API URLs (`http://api.mixitconf.org/v2/...`)

Many thanks!
