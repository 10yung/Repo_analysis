Hello! Need help with several bricked vac.
Several STYJ02YM Bricked after trying get new 45 update (update just freeze and after bricking the vac). Button's flashing, but no sign of life when pushing them. Factory reset, wi-fi reset didn't work. Turn off, turn on didn't work. Around 3 people from our community already have this issue
Is there any way to do factory reset via usb or flash factory firmware ? Xiaomi Community tell's nothing, only contact with point of purchase.
I have the same vac but i was lucky with this update and create this topic to find solution for other people.

Thank you in advance!

I am currently trying to discover the S50 while it is in wifi mode after a fresh reset. I am using a parallels install of ubuntu linux. I cannot seem to discover the device or have a handshake with it. It simply times out.

mirobo discover --handshake true
INFO:miio.device:Sending discovery to <broadcast> with timeout of 5s..
INFO:miio.device:Discovery done

I am on the roborock generated wifi. 
Hello, I am trying to convert a Chinese version of Roborock S5 to the International version, but I can't overcome this error.

Any ideas?

`python flasher.py -a 192.168.0.105 -t 48634542505250567243726c78324e77 -f output/v11_001720.fullos.pkg`

```
Flasher for Xiaomi Vacuum
Connecting to device 192.168.0.105...
error while checking device: {'code': -10002, 'message': 'access denied'}
```

I followed [this steps](https://github.com/dgiese/dustcloud/wiki/VacuumRobots-manual-update-root-Howto), and I only get stuck at the last bit.

I also tried connecting to the robots wifi, but I get the exact same error.
I came home today and was unable to reach my Vac (S55 V2) on the network after almost 2 weeks of use without an issue. All the robot functions still worked if I used the buttons.

Resetting the wifi I am able to connect my laptop to it's internal wifi, but unable to bring up the web page or SSH into it.

My next attempt was a factory reset - which the voice prompt says will take 5 min... but nothing ever comes of it.

I'm not sure what to do next, the search also doesn't bring anything useful up.
Dear @dgiese! As you describe in https://github.com/dgiese/dustcloud/issues/213#issuecomment-552096485, you have some ideas on how to root the latest Xiaomi vacuum cleaners (Mijia 1S, Roborock T6 / S6, Mijia 1C).

Can you share your thoughts on this or just tell us about your progress? Maybe you need [help from the community](https://github.com/dgiese/dustcloud/issues/213#issuecomment-552096485) or something else.
1. Fix findIP() - On my (Windows 10)PC I got an issue where because of Docker I have a number of active interfaces. Old findIP() function used to retrieve the 1st address so it failed to send ota command with the correct server IP. This method works better by "pinging" the robot itself so we can get only the relevant local IP used to reach the robot's address, which makes it the correct address.

2. Add an option to manually override this local IP address. Useful when running inside docker, see #110 
Hi guys! Sorry for the little off topic but I never rooted mi S5. The problem is that mi S5 is stuck on a message "Boot failure. It will take about 5 minutes to restore your initial version. Please be patient".  This repeats every 15 minutes, no WIFI, no lights. So, I think that the recovery is trying to boot from the previous OK firmware after a failure to upgrade, but for some reason it cant. 

So, what do you think that are my chances to get in there and flash a good firmware to recover my S5? Am I totally stuck or there is chance to recover from that without having to buy a new motherboard?

Thanks!

Might fix factory resets
Hi all, 

Update: 

I found some info now. But is version T6/S6 same as Gen2? 
Will it then work fully in region EU, all app control etc? 

—————-


New here. 
I just bought i Roborock T6 in China. I’m back in Europe now where I live. 
I can add cleaner in my devices when connected to China Mainland. But get error message that it’s not certified for current region and cannot be used normally. So not possible to control. 
When connected to EU region, cleaner is not found. 
What can I do to get it work here? 
I have found thread how to add english language on older version. But first I have to learn and understand how to get into software. So if anyone could guide me to this information I would be very glad. 

Best Regards 
Schoen
