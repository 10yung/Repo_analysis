Reopen session for CameraView after aborting

- Reopen session for CameraView after aborting
This is an edge case but i was checking camera view navigation bar color in dark, light mode and encountered this issue.

v3.1
iPhone 11 iOS 13.3

When rear ALCameraViewController is open,  open control centre and switch mode to dark or light. The camera takes picture automatically with front camera and shows select, cancel buttons. 
On clicking cancel, camera goes dark. Comes alive after long time.

Dragging or tapping on the crop points just snaps the image and the cropper into the center of the screen. The image can be resized but the cropper doesn't work at all.
This little PR restarts the camera session if the user has canceled the photo confirmation. 

Before there was a black screen after the cancellation and the user could only restart the camera session by pulling down the CameraViewController a little bit. In that case `viewWillAppear` was called again restarting the camera session.
Current version: 3.0.3

When taking a photo from the camera, the flashlight is working.
But if I cancel the first photo and retake, the flashlight is not working.
1) Selecting the tick icon in Confirm Screen directs to "Cancel button" action.
2) The images in camera screen is not aligned.

Steps:
Select the Photo library icon-> the screen shows a 'X' icon on top of the screen with a collection view of images-> Tap the close button-> the camera view shows a black screen.

In the camera view, if I click the power key with iPhone X, there will still take photo.
