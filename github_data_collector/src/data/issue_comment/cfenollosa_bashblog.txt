A `background-color` was specified, the text-`color` was missing. I added it.
Please set your $EDITOR environment variable. For example, to use nano, add the line 'export EDITOR=nano' to your $HOME/.bashrc fil

fix #120 
Sorry if I took some joy from you but I just started to like the feeling created PRs give me :)
When needed to comply with git-support it will be one line:
line 635: ```[[ $git_repo == 'true' && -n $commit_message ]] git commit -m"$comit_message" && [[ $git_push_on_commit == 'true' ]] && git push```
#149  but right branch
I was wondering if there was a command or an easy way to add on the ability to have bashblog take another method for STDIN, I write markdown using a browser extension so I have my posts already in .txt/.md files. Can I feed them to bashblog and have bashblog compile and serve then as usual from inputing "filenames.md" instead of typing it in the console? 

I would love a way to do that, I prefer to write on an external program but love how small and hard working bashblog is.

Thanks :)
Added a global variable ``` markdown_options ``` to pass options to the markdown binary

Not an issue as such. I wondered if bashblog is still being actively developed?

Also wish to announce I have created a gui for bashblog, called "makeblog" (albeit providing some extra functionality on the fly). Temporarily, download and info here:

http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=973642

Tested on DebianDog (Puppy Linux murga forum) mainly, but should work on any Debian/Ubuntu or a Puppy Linux system, as long as gtkdialog installed (link to a deb for that provided in above info). I may add alternative gui's later (e.g. maybe a yad version).

Unfortunately, makeblog currently uses GNU sed (since uses sed -i), so maybe won't work on MAC systems by default, but I may also look into changing that GNU sed need later.

I am currently evaluating *bashblog* which seems to be the perfect solution for my current use case: basically, a hand-written PHP website (please don't judge me, it was the right choice this time ;-)) which has everything but a blog section because this was still much less work than retro-fitting one of the ~ 500 available static CMSs.

While playing with the `.config` file, I noticed two missing *features*. Let me suggest them:

1. **Configurable file extensions.** My website has a PHP header which can not be used by *bashblog* because I can't generate PHP files. As there is no real reason for that, I would like to have a way to replace `.html` by (e.g.) `.php`.
2. **Configurable output paths.** My HTML (or PHP :-)) files are publicly readable for obvious reasons. Right now, `bb.sh` seems to enforce to be in the same folder as well. It should be possible to replace `./` by `some/folder/` with a `.config` setting.

What do you think?
If the filename fullpath has dots in it appears to me that `${1%%.*}.html` will strip too early(?). For example:  building  a blog in local github directory named anything/yourname.github.io/ and trying to edit fileone.html in there.  If I am correct, the result would be anything/yourname.html (so will get a "Can't edit post" error message), since matched on first dot. If just trying to strip whatever the file extension is, then seems to me should be `${1%.*}.html`. Same throughout that edit() function (timestamps etc).

i.e. should be "shortest part of $Pattern that matches the back end of $var" if simply wanting to strip the filename extension.
