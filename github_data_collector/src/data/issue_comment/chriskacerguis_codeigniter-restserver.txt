Hi, 

I'm wondering if anyone can help me.

This is the first time I'm setting up a RESTful server in my Codeigniter project and I'm having difficulty trying to get the "Api.php" example to work.

I have placed the "rest.php" file in the config folder (as instructed in the documentation). I placed the "Restcontroller.php" and the "Format.php" files in different locations but I am still getting the same error.

I would like someone to tell me where I'm going wrong with this.

Thank you.
I'm trying to retrieve value send from delete request using $this->delete('') but it is null. 

Here is my backbone model code:-
     
    var contactModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
                defaults: {
                    contactName: '',
                    contactEmailAddress: '',
                    contactNumber: '',
                    usertags: []

                },
                idAttribute: "contactId",
                urlRoot: "<?php echo base_url(); ?>index.php/Contacts/userContacts",
                initialize: function() {
                    console.log("Inizializing Contact Model");
                }
            });

and when the user clicks the delete button its triggers the "deleteContact" function in backbone view. 

    var contactView = Backbone.View.extend({
                el: '#userContact',
                initialize: function() {

                },
                render: function() {
                    return this;

                },
                events: {
                    "click #deleteContact": 'deleteContact'
                },
                deleteContact: function() {
                    var contactId = $('#contact_id').val();
                    var contact = new contactModel({
                        contactId: contactId
                    });
                    contact.destroy();
                }
            });

and inside the Codeigniter controller method, I'm trying to get contact id using 

$contactId = $this->delete('contactId');

But it returns null. I only have this issue with delete request. I implemented the other request and they work fine.
Please review my changes.
There were some issues need to be fixed. 
Hi, i find an error In the RestController.

In the line 519
```
**$this->response([
                $this->config->item('rest_status_field_name')  => false,
                $this->config->item('rest_message_field_name') => sprintf($this->lang->line('text_rest_invalid_api_key'), $this->rest->key),
            ], HTTP_FORBIDDEN);**
```
The error can be fix change to this

```
**$this->response([
                $this->config->item('rest_status_field_name')  => false,
                $this->config->item('rest_message_field_name') => sprintf($this->lang->line('text_rest_invalid_api_key'), $this->rest->key),
            ], RESTController::HTTP_FORBIDDEN);**
```
That's correct or i have error in implementation?

Hi I have a config setting like below:

`$config['auth_override_class_method_http']['admin']['auth']['post'] = 'none';`

I am using this library for my HMVC: https://bitbucket.org/wiredesignz/codeigniter-modular-extensions-hmvc

But when I checked with error handling on REST_Controller.php

it seems like /admin/auth is not recognised with REST

Although all of my GET/POST requests are working fine as it should be on the endpoint.

Could anyone suggest what I should do in order to get it working i.e., 

I want to use authentication on several API request but not on admin/auth [POST]
according to the new update
`users_get()` as example function to get users data from api.

when its test with the postman with POST method. it gives an error. how to handle it
