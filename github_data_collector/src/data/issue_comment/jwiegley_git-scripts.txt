First, thanks for making all of these scripts available.  I'm finding several of them to be really useful!

I was looking at git-find today, and thought I'd give it a try.  So I ran it against the git repo (the real Git repo) and got this:

```
/Users/jszakmeister/bin/git-find:99:in `assign_name': stack level too deep (SystemStackError)
from /Users/jszakmeister/bin/git-find:89:in `each'
from /Users/jszakmeister/bin/git-find:89:in `assign_name'
from /Users/jszakmeister/bin/git-find:99:in `assign_name'
from /Users/jszakmeister/bin/git-find:89:in `each'
from /Users/jszakmeister/bin/git-find:89:in `assign_name'
from /Users/jszakmeister/bin/git-find:99:in `assign_name'
from /Users/jszakmeister/bin/git-find:89:in `each'
from /Users/jszakmeister/bin/git-find:89:in `assign_name'
 ... 4497 levels...
from /Users/jszakmeister/bin/git-find:174:in `process_names'
from /Users/jszakmeister/bin/git-find:183
from /Users/jszakmeister/bin/git-find:183:in `each'
from /Users/jszakmeister/bin/git-find:183
```

The exact command line I used was:
    git find bd40d252ec1ed2716ac9e6bbeab48b3b40bd0d58

Again, that was in the official git repo.

Thanks again!
