* Indent using 4 spaces. Never indent with tabs. Be sure to set this preference in Xcode.
* Method braces and other braces (`if`/`else`/`switch`/`while` etc.) always open on the same line as the statement but close on a new line.
Hey,
Is it a personal preference? Or there is a reason I miss somewhere.
Thanks. 
fix little question of indent
In the section of https://github.com/objc-zen/objc-zen-book#constants, we should not use static for NotificationName, or we can' t extern it for other code. For example:

```
//a.h
extern static NSString *const TestConstNotificationName;
```

```
//a.m
static NSString *const TestConstNotificationName = @"TestConstNotificationName";
```

This won't pass compile. 

On other hand, a constant will be init in the global memory area. So it doesn't need a `static` key word. 
clang version: `Apple LLVM version 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.42.1)`
Xcode version: `7.3.1`

```
NSURL *url = ({
    NSString *urlString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@/%@", baseURLString, endpoint];
    [NSURL URLWithString:urlString];
});
```
compiler error: `initializing 'NSURL *__strong' with an expression of incompatible type 'void'`

The value of the latest statement is not returned if enclosing in round bracket.

It's  poor reading experience on Github, If you want I can help

`Never prefix your private method with a single underscore _`

`- (void)_notifyDelegates {`

The two lines above are just copied here.

I know this project is about coding convention, but you tried to explain block and its usage, so I ask

In the "Block" section,

```
__weak __typeof(self)weakSelf = self;
__strong __typeof(weakSelf)strongSelf = weakSelf;
```

Why typeof(weakSelf) instead of typeof(self)? Aren't they the same thing ?

I think https://github.com/objc-zen/objc-zen-book#multiple-delegation part of article should mention `NSHashTable` as a way to store weak references without creating `ZOCWeakObject` class.
