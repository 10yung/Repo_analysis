I was using acme.sh on my server even before Froxlor started using it but now Froxlor is breaking it by always removing the cronjob

https://github.com/Froxlor/Froxlor/blob/master/lib/Froxlor/Cron/Http/LetsEncrypt/AcmeSh.php#L429

This is really bad. Maybe Froxlor should keep its own copy of acme.sh and not mess with the installed one?
This is a minor issue:
when DNS resolution is not available for the nameserver entries from the panel configurtion for bind, these entries will show up unresolved in the config file, thus bind won't start anymore, as only IP addresses ar permitted in AXFR entries.

For replication testing open the froxlor webpage, navigate to bind config and enter two comma separated hostnames that do not resolve. Have the config files created again via cron and bind will stop working.
This is a rare event - if your DNS is not responding while the config file is recreated bind will be dead as well. Entries in the hosts file will be ignored.
# Feature Request

# Summary

* It would be great, if we manually can add/remove columns in the Customers/Domains overview.

For example:
* Customers overview: add the applyed hosting plan, Email and other fields.
* Domains overview: add the document root, separate logfile enabled, Emaildomain enabled, Only email? enabled and other fields.




# System information
* Froxlor version: 10.10




# Steps to reproduce

1. Open Froxlor and navigate to "Ressources -> Customers" or "Ressources -> Domains"


# Expected behavior

1. Able to add/remove columns in the overview.




# Actual behavior

1. Not able to add/remove columns in the overview.



# Bug report vs. support request
If you're unsure of whether your problem is a bug or a configuration error
* contact us via IRC in #froxlor on freenode
* or post a thread in our forum at https://forum.froxlor.org

As a rule of thumb: before reporting an issue
* see if it hasn't been [reported](https://github.com/Froxlor/froxlor/issues) (and possibly already been [fixed](https://github.com/Froxlor/froxlor/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is:issue%20is:closed)) first
* try with the git master





# Summary

If changing period to collect traffic and disk usage more than once a day, stats should be merged for example a day, or after a month to avoid huge amounts of usage records.



# System information
* Froxlor version: 0.10.9
* Web server: apache2
* DNS server: none
* POP/IMAP server: Dovecot
* SMTP server: postfix
* FTP server: proftpd
* OS/Version: Debian Buster, MySql 8.x




# Steps to reproduce

1. Set Consettings of traffic and disk usage for example to 5 Minutes
2. After a while 12 Months there many records in the tables
3. Open Customers, this will take long time




# Expected behavior

1. If setting cronsettings traffic and diskusage  to smaller values, ui is also fast as collecting much less traffic and disk usage stats
2. Traffic and customer are available within less than 1 second

# Actual behavior

1. Too many records in panel_traffic, panel_traffic_admins, panel_diskspace and disk_space_admins, made UI tab customers and traffic very slow (1-5 minutes)


# Feature Request

# Summary

* Would be nice to have DNS configuration instructions for CentOS/RHEL systems. 
* Debian/Ubuntu instructions can (mostly) be followed, if the correct paths for CentOS/RHEL are substituted/symlinked

# System information
* Froxlor version: 0.10.8
* Web server: apache2
* DNS server: Bind9
* POP/IMAP server: Dovecot
* SMTP server: postfix
* FTP server: proftpd
* OS/Version: CentOS Linux release 7.7.1908 (Core)

# Steps to reproduce

1. Install froxlor
2. Go to configuration->Cent/RHEL 7


# Expected behavior

1. Service config instructions for DNS

# Actual behavior

1. No service for Nameserver listed under Cent/RHEL 7

# Comment
* Intentionally have not updated to 0.10.9 as the system running 0.10.8 is being made production ready and cannot take an update right now (ensuring update will not negatively impact production; no separate test system available - yet)
# Description

IP validation sorts out any "reserved" IP. That's a good thing because we do not want e.g. to DHCP bind to broadcasts IPs. But there are some special cases that are filtered out by FILTER_FLAG_NO_RES_RANGE:

* Using 0.0.0.0 in "Ports and IPs" to create a Port listening on any IP
* Using 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 e.g. for MySQL to allow access to any IP

(Personally, I have only use case 1 but since It's quite similar, I added the other too).

# How Has This Been Tested?

I have manually tested that creating a port with IP 0.0.0.0 works as expected. I have added Tests into ValidationTests for both use cases.

# Summary

There are a few dns records that help clients to do auto discovery,eg, for mail, caldav, and carddav. It would be great if Froxlor would make sure that they are in the DNS zones.

For domains with email support:
* adding [rfc6186](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6186) compatible records (This is related to #719 .)
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autoconfiguration defines autoconfig.domain
* https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3211279/outlook-2016-implementation-of-autodiscover defines _autodiscover._tcp.domain in step 10.
* The iOS feature would also be nice to have, see https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/blob/master/data/web/mobileconfig.php for an example.

Adding custom records to multiple domains managed by Froxlor would help too, eg, caldav, carddav see [rfc6764](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6764)

Thanks
# Summary
Allow customers in Froxlor to add/configure/remove domains. (Not just subdomains as today.)

Pre-populate the zone configuration with sensible defaults for zone hosting, email, web and any combiation of them. 

Optional: Allow an easy integration with a domain registrar.

Thanks
Hi all,

the SRV entry in the dns settings is a bit special.
Often a dns editor has special fields for this entry in the editor: port, weight, protocol, service
https://blog.contabo.de/tutorials/srv-records-wie-nutze-ich-sie-richtig/

Can you add this special fields in the editor. If it is not possible, can you add the description how to make a SRV entry not in the error message but as a message directly in the editor or when the entry type SRV is choosen?
An example for a right SRV entry would be great, too.
