CN ：确保弹窗 ToastView只添加一个，防止重复点击   重叠添加ToastView
I display toast with progress indicator to wait for background task. But view behind toast is still clickable. Is there a way to fix it?
Hi, I use `Toast` to create a loading view. So I pass `CGFLOAT_MAX` to `duration` parameter to ensure toast do not disappear automatically, since I would manually hide it.

But if I hide it before completion block in `-cs_showToast:duration:position:` called,  the timer will hold strong reference to view forever.

Beside my case, there is a release latency if we manually hide toast before completion block called. 
 Would it better to take a check on `finished` flag? This flag is `NO` when I manually hide toast.

Fix makeToastActivity condition called hideAllToasts cannot be hidden
This solves issue https://github.com/scalessec/Toast/issues/68 with title and message alignment:

* The solution it to use the same width for both UILabels. This will be the largest value of the 2 expected widths based on the text content.
* The available width for the UILabel was too large; the `style.horizontalPadding` wasn't respected.

Here is the before (left) and after (right) when using `style.titleAlignment = NSTextAlignmentCenter;`:

It also solves a problem that the UILabel is not resizing when using `horizontalPadding`:

add style, UIActivatyIndicator to makeToastActivity

- (void)makeToastActivity:(id)position style: (CSToastStyle *)style;
- (void)makeToastActivity:(id)position style:(CSToastStyle *)style indicatorStyle:(UIActivityIndicatorViewStyle)indicatorStyle;

and change demo

Thank you.
I wanted to have not only to appear and disappear the toasts with transparency animations. My goal was to have the toasts slide from the bottom up and out again. Therefore I added optional blocks defining the show and hide animation of the toast.
Let me know if I need to provide anything else.
As mention in #53, if the title or message is shorter than the width of the wrapper view, it does not appear to be centered.

Bug fixes that animation is complete when the parent view is released before the start application error occurs. Change the trigger of completion animation from NSTimer base timer source base.

note:
Great implementation of this Toast but, it seems there is a need to a little improvement. There seems to be screen transition and a case to application errors when using this Toast you use a UINavigationControl at iOS7 / 8.

Where it was examined, there is a case that to no parent view before completion animation that uses a NSTimer ToastView has been released, it was noticed that you are going to call a method of NSTimer has been released instance.

So I have changed how to implement the GCD-based timer souce. I hope that this implementation is us liked.
