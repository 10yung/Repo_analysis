Xcode 8 introduces a new extension system which enables developers to finally be able to build and distribute Xcode extensions. The drawback is that at the present time this breaks the system we've had in place until now, meaning XCActionBar (along with all other plug-ins) will stop working. Given how sparse the documentation is, it isn't clear whether most of XCActionBar's functionally can be ported over to the new system; I suspect it is _not_, at least not just yet. 

In the meantime, while not pretty, there is a workaround which will allow Xcode 8 to still load all your plugins.

Please see alcatraz/Alcatraz#475 for more information.

Trim Trailing Whitespace is removing all blank lines, rather than just trailing whitespace characters.

I'm using Xcode 6.3.

Like in appcode: you press the keys and xcode goes from `className` to `classNameSpec` or `classNameTests`

I will be glad to do it myself but do not know how to start this one.

Preconditions: 
https://github.com/kattrali/cocoapods-xcode-plugin is installed alongside with XCActionBar.

Steps to reproduce: 
- Activate XCActionBar
- Make search for "Podfile"
- Select "Create/Edit Podfile" item (which actually is submenu under Product > CocoaPods)

Expected: corresponding menu action is performed (Podfile is opened if exists)
Actual: Xcode crashes, see Problem Report attached

- From the documentation:
  
  Use the NSWindow makeFirstResponder: method, not this method, to make an object the first responder. Never invoke this method directly.
- I don't think this method call was ever needed, as in the `XCActionBarWindowController`'s `windowDidBecomeKey:` method correctly calls `[self.window makeFirstResponder:self.searchField];` anyway.

`NSCopying` class types that also have a mutable subclass variant (for example `NSString`, `NSArray`) should always be specified as `copy`.

This helps avoid situations where the value of a property could change without the setter being invoked (i.e. the object gets mutated).

Hi. I'm using https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim plugin, that add vim motion to xcode.
But with this plugin action view appear, but coursor not focused in the actionBar view. Nor automatically, nor by mouse. I'm not sure is it problem XCActionBar or Xvim, So, I will add similar issue to Xvim project also. https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim/issues/716

As per the discussion in #9, this is a quick refresh of the UI.

This PR is a WIP, so feedback is appreciated. It's also missing some spacing, separators, icons and font treatments. 

Using the "Add breakpoint" command when current line is activated does remove the breakpoint, so possibly the action can just be renamed?

- Example the builtin snippet `Objective-C -init Method`, would be really nice if I could just enter `init` and match that action.
