Can you please provide TextField samples here? There are no much references about how to control TextField and focus. Please add sample.
Great initiative over there,could we have a demo apk link in this repo as well?

The button in top Toolbar is very hardly clickable. It uses size of drawable for click area, which is 24x24 dp for ic_back.xml. 48dp is probably recommended minimum for buttons.

Ideally the button uses entire toolbar height, and has predefined width, starting from leftmost pixels. The drawable icon may be whatever size it wishes, but clickable area should be large enough. 

See visualization of current clickable area:
