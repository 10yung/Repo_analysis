I am trying to implement bqplot for larger dataset (more than 10k data points). However, one issue is over-plotting.  For alleviating the overwhelming perception load, I intended to scale down the size of the markers. No matter how I adjust default_size, the marker size stays the same. Also, how to set a larger the display estate. I would like replicate the same plot as matplot but using bqplot powers the interaction. ideally.

According to https://readthedocs.org/projects/bqplot/builds/, the last build of "latest" was one year ago (Dec. 21, 2018).

Normally this happens each time something is pushed to `master`, maybe there's something wrong with the repo setup?
This will fix #1015, it is an update of the MarketMap figure related to #993 and #982
The same way `Map` became a `Mark`, `MarketMap` should be a `Mark` and not a `Figure`.
We should apply the equivalent patch @maartenbreddels did in https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot/pull/993, but this time for `MarketMap`.

Deprecate Scatter's `default_opacities` in favor of `opacities` (`default_colors` was deprecated in favor of `colors` in bqplot `0.8.4`).

Other marks had `opacities` instead of `default_opacities`, so this will make bqplot's API more homogeneous.

This is the first of several PRs for making `Mark`'s implementation more general, by adding common marks logic inside of it. For this purpose we need to make marks APIs more homogeneous.
**Describe the bug**
Setting `unselected_style` after `selected_style` removes the "selected" marks styling

**To Reproduce**

This also fixes issues with selected-style and font-style not being properly applied
