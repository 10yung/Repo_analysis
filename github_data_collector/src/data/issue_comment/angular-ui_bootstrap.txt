### Bug description:
Hello,
I got some trouble with uib modal,
Sometimes, it's totally random, when I close modal using  $uibModalInstance.close(smth) method, it doesn't close properly. 
I saw lot's of the same issue but can't find the same setup as mine. 
And as a said it's totally random, i can't reproduce it to make it work 100%.

Here's a plunker reproducing my issue with older version, I don't want to use older version of angular or UIBS

http://plnkr.co/edit/lQMQm5NJuRHkTBfER7cq?p=preview

### Steps to reproduce the issue:
Here's my code: 
Call modal Method:
```js
var modalInstance = $uibModal.open({
                    animation: true,
                    controller: 'ModalInfoMouvementCtrl',
                    templateUrl: '/otawa/infomouvement',
                    size: 'lg',
                    backdrop: 'static',
                    keyboard: true,
                    resolve: {
                        param: function () {
                            return { mouvement: mvt };
                        }
                    }
                });
                modalInstance.result.then(function (mvt) {
                    if (mvt != null) {
                        var respa = mouvementSrv.getMouvementById(mvt.id);
                        respa.then(function (response) {
                            var mvt = convertMouvementData(response.data);
                            $scope.listMouvement[index] = mvt;
                            $scope.selectedmvt = null;
                        }, function (err, status) {
                            $toastr.error(err.data, 'Erreur');
                        });
                    }
                    reloadInstance();
                }, function () {
                });
```
Closing method on other Controller :
```js
  $scope.close = function (mvt) {
                $uibModalInstance.close(mvt);
            }
```
Calling modal on button click, then when i finish to fill my form inside the modal, it fade out but I can't click anywhere, and if I inspect HTML i can see the modal HTML.

Set animation false do not solve the bug.

Any suggestion of what could be wrong ?

Fix bug when click started on modal content and released out of modal.

Closes [5810 issue](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/issues/5810)
Also [5911 PR](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/pull/5911)
Closes 6636

change the datepicker activeDate so it uses a copy of the initDate instead of a reference to initDate.
This way when the user clicks Next or Previous, activeDate changes but initDate does not.

### Bug description:

I've added ui-bootstrap to an angular 1.x project and getting this error when I want to open a modal form 

[$compile:tpload] Failed to load template: uib/template/modal/window.html (HTTP status: 404 Not Found)

I've used ui-bootstrap before and always it worked well but in my new project I have problem with it.

the code is like : 
`$uibModal.open({
                backdrop: 'static',
                templateUrl: 'DesktopModules/' + window.GLOB.moduleFolderName + '/app/form/form.html',
                controller: 'requestCtrl',
                size: 'sm',
                scope: $scope
            });`

### Bug description: As the user navigates the datepicker control, the initDate is updated. This causes issues if you use the the current date of one datepicker as the initDate of another.
Also, note how the Start Date control itself doesn't change, but the model value does.

Expected: initDate is essentially readonly.

### Steps to reproduce the issue:
As noted in the Plunker, simply navigate forward or backward by month in the **End Date** datepicker and note how the **Start Date** value changes.

I am using the pop over for my directive. In my directive, I am binding the popover dynamically.

For the first time, if we bind, the popover is working fine. If we bind second time with the same settings for the same element, the popover is not triggered.

Here I have stimulated the above usage using the controller. Please refer the following url.

To Reproduce the issue

 1. After loading the link, click the append button
 2. Then click on the popover text. The popover will be opened.
 3. Then click on the same append button.
 4. Now click on the popover text, popover won't trigger.

In this pluker, this is not opening. But in my application, I am getting the two popover.
If I comment the following code, the popover works without the issue.

```
  if (isOpenParse) {
              scope.$watch(isOpenParse, function(val) {
                if (ttScope && !val === ttScope.isOpen) {
                  toggleTooltipBind();
                }
              });
            }
```
