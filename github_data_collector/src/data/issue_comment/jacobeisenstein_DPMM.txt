Hi all, in line 108, deriv_up is defined as 2 / (n - k + 3/2) while deriv_down is defined as k * n / (n - k + 1). Has anyone actually tried to derive these 2 equations since author mentioned it is guaranteed to produce positive and negative derivative?

I tried deriving myself thinking they are linked to the equation of hprime. However, if I tried to let hprime = 0, I will get stuck with the harmonic series. Unless my direction is wrong, such that those two equation are not related to hprime. 

Update (Here is what I tried):
If I have to let HPrime be more than 0, I would have to approximate the harmonic series as n*a and eventually derive the equation that a must be bigger than 1/(2*(n-k-3/2) which I can easily assume that deriv_up = 1 / (n - k + 3/2) or deriv_up = 2 / (n - k + 3/2) (as written in the code) which are both bigger than 1/(2*(n-k-3/2). 

Whereas for HPrime be less than 0 (a(k-3/2)+1+a^2(digamma(a)-a^2(digamma(a+n) <0). Firstly, a must be a postive value for MATLAB psi to work and digamma(a) must produce a positive number so no matter how big k is, as long as a is bigger than k then we would get a negative derivative. So letting deriv_down = k +1 would produce a negative derivative as well. However, I am not sure if my assumptions are correct though..
