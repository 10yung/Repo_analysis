This seems like a neat project. Though, the `README` does seem to lack build instructions. Building an OS is generally not simple, and I'm having some trouble doing so.

I ran `ARCH=amd64 ./BuildCrossCompiler`. It failed to compile on my (Arch Linux) system, annoyingly. But I was able to fix that by bumping the binutils and gcc versions in that script to the versions Arch currently uses.

It seemed I also needed to manually set `PATH` to include the built toolchain.

Then `make UPDATE`, and `make`. Which works.

But now, `make run` fails:

```
../../Usermode/.output/amd64/bin: No such file or directory
```
Can the uefi library be published as a separate crate?
