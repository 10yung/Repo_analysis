*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Hello guys
I want to send an event When user clicked on "Add to home Screen" button
any help?
I'm using angular 7.0.2 
**I'm submitting a ...**

* [x] feature request  

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

For URLs including *matrix* parameters it would be great to have a feature to clear these params as we do this with `pageTracking.clearQueryParams = true`.

Example:
`http://localhost:4200/heroes;id=15;foo=foo`

with `pageTracking.clearMatrixParams = true` becomes

`http://localhost:4200/heroes`

**For support questions, please consider using [Gitter - Chat](https://gitter.im/angulartics/angulartics2)**

**I'm submitting a ...**

* [x] bug report  
* [ ] feature request  
* [ ] question about the decisions made in the repository

* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem**

At the moment the "All Pages" section under the site content (Site Content -> All Pages) on google analytics is empty. It doesn't send any information. Here some pictures:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10131986/67926863-76aac200-fbb7-11e9-8369-a7507fcc1b15.png)

However I receive under the Events -> Pages the visited pages by the user:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10131986/67927173-3d268680-fbb8-11e9-86fe-e3b16d4b5038.png)

Here is a fraction of the code:
app.component.ts :
```
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(private router: Router,
    private fbTrackingAnalytics:Angulartics2Facebook,
    private googleTrackingAnalytics : Angulartics2GoogleTagManager,
    ) {
    this.googleTrackingAnalytics.startTracking();
    this.fbTrackingAnalytics.startTracking();
  }

```

in index.html I have this tag:

I have the following tags in google tag manager :

I think it is not the problem of the library but a misconfiguration on my side. 


* **What is the expected behavior?**
The library should send the correct information to the google analytics website

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

* **Environment:**

please run the following and copy the output
```sh
./node_modules/.bin/ng --version
```



- **What kind of change does this PR introduce?**
Adds additional properties to Page Track and also add ability within Adobe Omniture provider to override page name and not be forced to use the site URL.

- **What is the current behavior? Link to open issue?**
Not able to add additional parameters to page tracking https://github.com/angulartics/angulartics2/issues/351

- **What is the new behavior?**
page tracking allows passing of additional parameters and adobe can override page name from the url

Note, I am using Angular 5 and Angulartics2 v5.4.0 but those are only tags and not branches so it would be nice if the previous major release versions could have an updated branch so that they can have this feature to.

Importing Angulartics2Module into app-routing.module.ts allows page tracking to work, but not event tracking. Moving the import to app.module.ts allows both features to work. This should be explained in the documentation as it's confusing some features work and others don't by import location.

When running Angulatics2 locally you enable developerMode but there's no way to debug that the events are being sent? Expecting that to be highlighted more in the documentation, and if developerMode is set to true, why doesn't it console.log the events for debugging?

* **What is the expected behavior?**

Documentation to explain correct location app.module.ts to import Angulartics2Module, and that event tracking doesn't work if imported into app-routing.module.ts

Documentation to explain developerMode options and how to debug events locally.

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

Confusing to someone trying to use the library.

* [x] bug report  

I am trying to use clicky on my project. But I get this error. 
```
ERROR ReferenceError: clicky is not defined
    at Angulartics2Clicky.pageTrack (angulartics2-clicky.js:31)

Before I got to the error above, I had these errors, which prevented from run:

```eedefineInjectable not found
eeinject not found
```
in
node_modules\angulartics2\fesm2015\angulartics2.js
node_modules\angulartics2\clicky\fesm2015\angulartics2-clicky.js

after removing the "ee" from each "eedefinedInjectable" and "eeinject" I could run the  project and then in the browser console I got the "clicky is not defined" error.

**Summary**
When any non-default `pageTracking` is configured for Angulartics2 page views, the corresponding `clearUrl` page handling is not applied when processing `eventTrack` triggers. As a result, GA events report the simple hash substring URL if an explicit page property has not been set on the event binding, which overrides the originally configured page view report in Google Analytics Content dashboard. This results in cleared IDs and QueryParams still appearing in GA whenever events are fired.

**Reproduction info and code points**
1. _App module provider config:_
```typescript
  providers: [
    {
      provide: ANGULARTICS2_TOKEN, useValue: {
        settings: {
          pageTracking: {
            clearIds: true,
            clearQueryParams: true
          }
        } as Angulartics2Settings
      }
    },
  ],
```

2. Configure an `angulartics2On="click"` button in the app 

3. Observe the _GA PageView request_ args
```
t: pageview
dl: https://localhost/sampleApp/
dp: /example-route
```

4. Observe the _GA Event request_ args
```
t: event
dl: https://localhost/sampleApp/
dp: /example-route/12345?queryArg=example
```

- [angulartics2-core trackUrlChanges](https://github.com/angulartics/angulartics2/blob/386f3048231d20c0bdaeec9b94e25a688fe7cd2a/src/lib/core/angulartics2-core.ts#L50) - URL clearing logic executed for page view requests

* **What is the expected behavior?**
GA events page information (`dp` param) should be reported in the same fashion as the pageview page information, otherwise default format page views are erroneously reported in GA.

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
Proper GA content (page) view reporting, so that stripped ID and customized URLs are not reported when firing page events.
