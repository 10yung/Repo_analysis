Hello, I'm a student who uses Linux for research. Previously, I used Ubuntu for my study. and I bought MacBook and continue my research at Mac.
The problem is that it's a little different from Ubuntu's environment, and It's a bit different from the way I've installed it before.
I changed the login shell to bash after learning that it is a z shell in Ubuntu, not a bash shell used by Ubuntu

1. My main program are open-source research program(BERT, GMT...) run on Python 3.5 and 3.6. After the anaconda is installed, programs cannot respond or operate if there is a problem in the path.

Anaconda was installed using home-brew, and could this be caused by the Python version of an anaconda and the low version of a Pyenv installed using home-brew causing a path conflict?

2. I wonder if there are any errors due to installing an anaconda using home-brew, installing an earlier version of Pyenv, and installing a program using other installation commands(?), such as pip or apt, using different commands.
It seems to be a mess because I've installed it here and there.

3. When a program called GMT was installed, it was installed using a package file. The problem is that when I run the installation file inside the package file, the terminal opens and It want it to work inside. However, there is no command when the program is operated using the command in the terminal rather than running using the application.
Is this also caused by incorrect routes or installation?

4. It turns out that the reason it doesn't work is a complicated installing programs, and I'm going to try to install it step by step after resetting the OS. I try to install most of the time using home-brew, and I try not to use any other command as much as I can. if you see any of the above problems, how do you want to install the packages?

I still don't understand how these path problems and environment variables work because I don't have enough systematic study on linux. and my English is not enough, but please understand.



Hi, I just tried to install mac-cli, and I see it install git by brew.
I suggest to add a configuration step by asking git path, so it will be not installed again.
In trying to install/use mac-cli on a brand new install of Mojave (10.14.2), I was unable to install glances (resolved by installing via `brew install glances`) or successfully run the pip portion of `mac update` with the command as currently formatted. 

Specifically;
`pip list --outdated --format=freeze --local | grep -v '^\-e' | cut -d = -f 1  | xargs -n1 pip install -U`
results in a whole long list of
`Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: 
[('/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/....', '/private/var/folders/...', "[Errno 1] Operation not permitted:`
whereas substituting `pip install --user` worked like a charm.

I know I could try to find/make these changes, and submit a PR, but I'm still not exactly a paragon of confidence in coding/github/etc. So I'm just letting anyone know who might care. 

```
joegallo@xor ~ mac info
sw_vers
ProductName:	Mac OS X
ProductVersion:	10.13.5
BuildVersion:	17F77
```

```
joegallo@xor ~ mac bluetooth:enable
Bluetooth enabled{NC}
No matching processes were found
```

It says bluetooth is enabled but doesn't seem to actually have any effect.
Hi,

I found that after the first successful "mac update" operation, it always fails at "sudo gem update --system" and "sudo gem update". I found that it could be manually fixed by reinstalling those gems with "gem install XXX --user-install" and "mac update" would work for **once** and the same problem came back. ( Though gem update --system always fails.)

I later found out that this is due to that I replaced the system-ruby (version 2.3.x) with the one I installed with "rbenv". And  it turns out that if "rbenv" or "RVM" is used, it would broke the ruby installation if sudo is used during upgrades.

An upgrade to mac-cli is needed s.t. during the original installation, the script should check whether rbenv/RVM is used and prompt to ask the user whether to elevate the privilege with sudo command during updates. And for existing users, there need to be an option in /usr/local/bin/mac file s.t. they could specify whether sudo is used or not.

Thanks.
update should remember your settings, it is very annoying to type paths again.
I run the installer for the first time and it installed composer on my machine which I don't need.
The command mac hosts:edit is part of the commands for Lamp Utilities. When I run it it does nothing. I looked at the lamp file under the plugins folder and I don't see a command for it.
Running `mac help` I get following error:

> /usr/local/bin/mac: /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory

Confirmed with `cd /usr/local/bin/mac` â€“ Mac-CLI doesn't create the directory. And `/bin/sh^M` looks like an python script error. Just installed newest **node** and **npm** versions using Homebrew.

> python --version
> Python **2.7.13**
> pip --version
> pip **9.0.1** from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)

I have latest MacOS Sierra and tried both installation methods. Fast-CLI installation seems to fail since it is not reachable with `fast`. But Glances works.
