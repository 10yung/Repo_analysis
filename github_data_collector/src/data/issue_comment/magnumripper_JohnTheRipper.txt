Searching inside JtR, I found nothing. Anyway, this is something that @jfoug (maybe) can easily fix.

BTW: Google tells me _hash cat_ can crack it.

telegram2john (and all other similar tools) need to strip/replace any `:` from path before using it as "login" field or any other field. Easiest fix is to always use `basename(3)` on all paths always, although for GECOS fields we might actually want parts of directory names.
I am not entirely confident that the change is really necessary. Still, it's safe.
Most (or all?) formats that have a min-length has so because its implementations never allow anything shorter. But we've seen plenty of cases where WPA-PSK passwords are shorter than 8, even for ASCII. We should allow `--min-length` decreasing the default.
Is it possible to bruteforce Roboform .rfp files ?

I have a single wordlist "abb"
I checked all the rules
`-$ john --list=rules`

But I did not find the rule, which in general is very much in demand from the given characters:
Creating all kinds of combinations of characters

Example
`-$ john -w='/wordlist' --stdout --rules=Shuffle`

Expectation
a
b
ab
bb
ba
bab
bba
abb

I went looking for competitors: hashcat-Utils and crunch cannot do this either.
I suggest adding this rule to JtR.

ps / maybe a question / wish should have been asked on the mailing list, but I lost the e-mail address to which I need to write, but could not find, subscribing to the newsletter in a new way is troublesome.

There is a file.ovpn configuration file that requires a password to connect. 
There is a private key hash in the file.
If you can add support for this format.
AMD has removed the `OpenCL AMD APP SDK for Windows and Linux` files from their servers.

It seems that the necessary steps to make AMD OpenCL work has changed. Anyway, it is still possible to find and get drivers/SDK for AMD products (I guess):

We need some tests (hardware and volunteers).

This is a great improvement to our old hack of simply Base-64 encoding the (deprecated) hccap struct.

A corresponding pot line in JtR will only contain ESSID and calculated PMK, something like
```
WPA*00*PMK****ESSID***:password
```
That is: TYPE is set to 00, next field is PMK and all other fields but ESSID are empty.
