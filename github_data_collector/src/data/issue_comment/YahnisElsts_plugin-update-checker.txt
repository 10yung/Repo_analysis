Hey, Yahnis I have a problem.

We made a plugin for our company, we wanted the plugin to update automatically so we used your plugin checker. It works perfectly for all websites except for one multisite. for some reason the whole website stops working and I get the error call to undefined method setAuthentication

hello and thanks for the plugins you develop.
I'm trying to understand if this is useful for me.

what I would like to do is

1 put all the plugins I own in a google cloud bucket / amazon bucket

2 the user or my client or me on the sites I support, I install this "updater"

3 this updater checks ALL the plugins that are installed on the site and checks if they are present in the bucket.

4 If the plugins are present, download and update them.

5 BONUS: I should insert some security check (a license key or similar to prevent anyone from activating this updater)

what did you develop do and can do these things? or you could help me understand how to make it happen.

thank you.

Hi,

I'm writing about plugin update checker (https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker)

Its perfect solution for my purpose but I stuck on this problem:

I need to get variable (loaded on WP Update Server) from server to wordpress plugins page. With this variable I need to check licence (if exist/ if valid / if expired). On check I use script from this article https://w-shadow.com/blog/2013/03/19/plugin-updates-securing-download-links/

Can you please advice me how to create such variable and how to send it to plugins page?

Thank you very much,
Zdenek
This issue is similar to the one in this thread "Conflict with other plugin using this updater"
I have several plugins that use the update checker. The first two having issues are UpdraftPlus with v4p6 and Social Warfare with V4p4

End of error string is
Puc_v4p6_Plugin_Up in /home/writin00/public_html/notsoformulaic.com/wp-content/plugins/updraftplus/vendor/yahnis-elsts/plugin-update-checker/Puc/v4p6/Vcs/GitHubApi.php on line 97
Hi, i have a problem when i want to put the updater separately from the main index plugin. I put the updater on files `activation.php` in function `update_pinterin` and then on main index plugin i called do_action function for calling the `update_pinterin` but it seems not working and the updater was not showing when i activated the plugin. 

This is the main index code : 
```php
/*
Plugin Name: Pinterin
Plugin URI: https://semanthic.com/
Description: Plugin for automatic
Version: 1.4.5
Author: SEMANTHIC
Author URI: https://semanthic.com
License: SEMANTHIC LTD.
*/

function pinterin()
{
    include_once plugin_dir_path(__FILE__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';
    include_once plugin_dir_path(__FILE__) . '/vendor/updater-plugin/plugin-update-checker.php';
    include_once plugin_dir_path(__FILE__) . '/activation.php';

    do_action('update_pinterin');

}
add_action('plugins_loaded', 'pinterin');

// register_activation_hook(__FILE__, 'pinterin');
```

This is the files for `activation.php`
```php
function update_pinterin()
    {
        $myUpdateChecker = Puc_v4_Factory::buildUpdateChecker(
            'https://gitlab.com/masiting/plugins,
            __FILE__,
            'pinterin'
        );
        $myUpdateChecker->setAuthentication('Dasdas');
        $myUpdateChecker->setBranch('plugin');
    }
```

Please help, thanks.
How to make a Plugin for my own website? my website sale GPL license theme and plugin I make a plugin like [GPLkit](https://www.gplkit.com/) or [Gplzone ](https://gplzone.com/automatic-updates/) and like [GPL Vault](https://www.gplvault.com/how-to-use-install-the-gpl-vault-automatic-update-plugin/) for automatically update my customer.
Hello yahnis,

Is it necessary to provide access token key if i am creating private repo?

//Optional: If you're using a private repository, specify the access token like this:
$myUpdateChecker->setAuthentication('your-token-here');

1. If i create private repo and if i not provide this --> $myUpdateChecker->setAuthentication('your-token-here'); will i get update for my plugin.

2. If i create private repo and if i provide this --> $myUpdateChecker->setAuthentication('your-token-here'); will i get update for my plugin, also is there a risk that by using access token in plugin user can breach into my other private repository of same account. 
Hello Yahnis,

I've been using your package for a while now and I you have made my life so much easier.
I have one issue though. I am hosting my repository on GitLab and I'll be honest I'm not very familiar with GitLab's API but I've been having this issue with tags.

The scenario: I push the code to my development branch and create a tag for it, and I do that many times over, since we have a WordPress website for testing purposes there will be many tags to fix the minor issues. Back onto my production branch there will be naturally one tag only after the testing finished successfully. And on our clients' WordPress websites the update checker displays version from the development branch.

Maybe I missed your documentation and maybe you already have a solution or this, but I would like the tags between branches not to have any conflicts between themselves.

Regards.
Hi again :) 

Question:

Instead of putting "plugin-update-checker" folder into the theme files, can i make it as required plugin to be installed with the theme? For example: I have woocommmerce as a required plugin to be installed. Can i make this plugin required to be installed instead of using it included into the theme root. 

I am asking this, because Theme Check plugin reads some warnings, and i'm uploading custom theme on themeforest, i know they will reject it because of this reason.

Thanks!!
