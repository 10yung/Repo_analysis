to interesting files search
The script will flag itself as having private keys/AWS secret keys because the search strings match themselves. If one of the characters in the search string is wrapped in square brackets it will still find the same strings, but will no longer match itself.
Added a function k8s_checks to check if the linux server is running a kubernetes cluster.
It might be interesting to check the value of ptrace_scope (reference: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/security/Yama.txt). If it is set to 0, this might help elevate privileges: https://github.com/nongiach/sudo_inject


Example from linuxprivchecker.py.. ur script is more user friendly.. if added this feature it will be useful..  Available dev tools like python,perl,awk etc. And include shell escapes

print
print "[*] ENUMERATING INSTALLED LANGUAGES/TOOLS FOR SPLOIT BUILDING...\n"

devTools = {"TOOLS":{"cmd":"which awk perl python ruby gcc cc vi vim nmap find netcat nc wget tftp ftp 2>/dev/null", "msg":"Installed Tools", "results":results}}
devTools = execCmd(devTools)
printResults(devTools)

print "[+] Related Shell Escape Sequences...\n"
escapeCmd = {"vi":[":!bash", ":set shell=/bin/bash:shell"], "awk":["awk 'BEGIN {system(\"/bin/bash\")}'"], "perl":["perl -e 'exec \"/bin/bash\";'"], "find":["find / -exec /usr/bin/awk 'BEGIN {system(\"/bin/bash\")}' \\;"], "nmap":["--interactive"]}
for cmd in escapeCmd:
    for result in devTools["TOOLS"]["results"]:
        if cmd in result:
	    for item in escapeCmd[cmd]:
	        print "    " + cmd + "-->\t" + item
print
LinEnum finds lots of useful info but, it can some times be a bit hard to analyze when the reports big and there's lots their.

Perhaps, have an option to create an html report with hyperlinks and cullers as well as minimizing or expanding sections, this may make it easier to analyze.
Thanks
