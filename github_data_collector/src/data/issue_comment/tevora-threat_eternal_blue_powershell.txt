Hi, Can you tell me how I can make shellcode to use this? I use some generators  in exploit-db but not work. Thanks.
Hello,
after trying multiple payload codes (x64,x86) I could not make it to work.
The machine always gets a bluescreen with no result (shell).

Different python code was able to work and exploit.
Can you please confirm?

Thanks,
Dvir
Has anyone succeeded running it from a command line?
I renamed it to e.ps1 for my convenience.

C:\>powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass
Windows PowerShell

PS C:\> .\e.ps1
PS C:\>

And thats it...
