What are the 'dummy' vpns (adblock over vpn) that you tested with the app and worked?

I have tested many and none of them work!

Can you please give some hints?

Thanks

I try to use the USB tethering, but my USB interfere with bluetooth headset.

When the current connected device is equal to 8, it is impossible to join the new device.

I searched for the answer in stackoverflow. Some people said that 20 Android devices using WIFI P2P function to connect should be no problem.

ATM all clients working through vpn, but some of the client that I dont want it using vpn. Can you add a control switch for which client can use vpn?
Now I should turn on hotspot then open VPNHotspot and switch on connection. I want to automatic mode. I see monitor mode, it's good but I should open app every time after I close it. So like solution it would be great to remember monitored connection. Thank you!
This is one of the most popularly [requested](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-vpn-hotspot-vpn-tethering-wi-fi-t3741604/post77730537) features. I believe this is possible.

I'm having issues in that the connection test on the 3DS do not complete successfully. I am using Hotspot Shield VPN as the VPN connection and using VPNHotspot to repeat the signal. I am using 1.1.1.1 DNS (1.0.0.1 Secondary) for both of the devices, with the Android device being the RCT6303W87DK. The VPNHotspot network is left as default. All the settings are at default.
Real IPv6 is leaking to connected clients. "Disable IPv6 tethering" option does nothing for my phone.
