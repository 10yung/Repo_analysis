I can't add or remove users. I can invite users but the link sent via email does nothing.

This is really blocking , can we have this fixed server side?


I added many strings on the server but now once I open the translations page, the view is blank and won't load on both safari and chrome. Does this happens also to you?
Hello, would it be possible to upload translations even in the simplest Excel format? This would be of great help for bigger projects.
Thanks,
Iordan
Hi there,
I am using LocalizationKit for quiet a while now and everything worked well
but today a problem appeared. Some keys will return empty Strings.

For example Localization.get("Admin", alternate: "Admin") returns ""

On localizationkit.com there appears to be a bug with these keys. 
They appear to be empty (although not appearing in "Missing" Tab). 
When I type something in they keep the value for a short time and then 
go back to "". 

As the two keys affected by this are titles for UIBarButtonItems these buttons
aren't appearing at all which makes the complete admin & editor area
of my app unreachable! This app is already in use by my customer...
The current version 4.0.5 shows error like

- UIKeyboardWillShow' has been renamed to 'UIResponder.keyboardWillShowNotification
- UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey' has been renamed to 'UIResponder.keyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey'
- UIKeyboardAnimationDurationUserInfoKey' has been renamed to 'UIResponder.keyboardAnimationDurationUserInfoKey
- UIKeyboardAnimationCurveUserInfoKey' has been renamed to 'UIResponder.keyboardAnimationCurveUserInfoKey'
- UIViewAnimationOptions' has been renamed to 'UIView.AnimationOptions'
- UIViewAnimationOptions' has been renamed to 'UIView.AnimationOptions

Hello,

I have this problem where on first start I see the Labels instead of the values. I use this code in AppDelegate:

`func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // Override point for customization after application launch.
        #if DEBUG
            NetworkActivityLogger.shared.level = .debug
            NetworkActivityLogger.shared.startLogging()
        #endif
        UITabBar.appearance().tintColor = UIColor.gray
        Localization.start(appKey: "...")
        Localization.ifEmptyShowKey = true
        Localization.setLanguage("hun")
        Localization.buildLanguageCode = "hun"
        
        return true
    }`

This works, but only the second time. Also, loading into UILabels dont work at all, I had to populate them manually
After add new language, Now the value is empty , So app show nothing or just show key.

I think if value is empty,  App should show the defallt value (English) or not key or empty.

BTW:  LocalizationKit_iOS is SO COOL! Thank you.
Hi,

I would like to know if you will port this library to Android in the future,
Because It would be very useful to have a single service for localizing apps for iOS and Android.

Please let me know,
Thank you
Could we get the option to upload .strings og .xliff files? .strings would be fine for at start.
It's a bit hard to hand some api key to your translator and ask him to translate through that.
Would also be nice to have an option to download the translated file.

Also if you have the api key you can fuck up the whole translation. Would be nice to be able to secure it with some password.

It takes 10 seconds on charles to find the api key, when the framework does the /languages call.
After that it's possible to change the translation without any other security.
If my translated text include escape character(like \n),
can Swift shows 2 lines?
