Taking forever to show a code token and it's always the wrong code so I can't login to one of my account anymore.
Recently steam changed procedure of adding authenticator - now before adding phone number it's required to confirm email once more. This PR adds support for this step. 
For this to work, changes needed in SteamAuth lib first, so this PR will only be useful if/when https://github.com/geel9/SteamAuth/pull/81 will get merged.
