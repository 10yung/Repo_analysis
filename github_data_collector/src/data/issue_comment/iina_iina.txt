**System and IINA version:**

- macOS <!-- Your macOS version -->
10.13.6

1.0.6

**Expected behavior:**


**Actual behavior:**
MacBook Pro Mid 2010 has geforce 320m GPU
No problem playing File with included player (quicktime)
But, It was very choppy with iina 1.0.6
I think mpv included iina is not compiled with Nvidia option

- [ ] MPV does not have this problem.


**How often does this happen?**
Every time
Rewrote "toggleSavedFilterAction" IBAction in FilterWindowController.swift.
* It was calling playercore.addVideoFilter or removeVideoFilter for
audio filters as well as video filters.

- [ ] This change has been discussed with the author.
- [ x] It implements / fixes issue #2729 .

---

**Description:**

**System and IINA version:**

- macOS:  Mojave 10.14.6
- IINA:  1.0.6 Build 113 (develop HEAD)

**Behavior:**
Clicking the checkbox next to saved audio filters doesn't remove/add the checkmark, and the audio filter doesn't activate/deactivate.

Will provide mpv log on request.
<br>

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Start a video so that you can hear the audio track.
2. Bring up Audio Filter dialog (Cmd-Shft-G) and create a new audio filter, e.g., Custom(mpv):
 Filter Name ="volume", Filter Value="volume=0.1"
3.  Hit save button and give it any name
4. Click checkbox next to this new saved filter
5. Checkmark should have changed and audio should have become barely audible

- I don't know if MPV has this problem.

**Solution:**
The issue is the `toggleSavedFilterAction` IBAction near/on line 168  in `FilterWindowController.swift`.  It calls `playercore.addVideoFilter` or `removeVideoFilter` even for audio filters.  I have rewritten the function -- let me know if I should go ahead and create a pull request.

**How often does this happen?**
Always.

IINA-1.0.6

**Expected behavior:**

Pick the subtitle which matches the current locale (zh-cn) or used before.

**Actual behavior:**

It always pick the first one / English.

**Description:**
Find the missing "show screenshot folder in Finder" button.
after updating iina from version 1.0.4 to 1.0.6 [macOS ver: high sierra 10.13.6], when opening the app, i get this error message :

Error setting option --cache=131072 with return value -7. Please check your extra option settings in Preference > Advanced.

[and the setting don't take affect]
the setting i have there is:
cache
131072
and trying to change the number didn't help

sense all my stuff are always on external drives, when i don't have that setting on, it constantly lag, so i can't really watch without that setting....

for now i downgraded it b' to 1.0.4 and it works again, but i can't use the newer versions until its fixed pretty much....

[also, i moved the 1.0.6 from the apps folder and changed its file name, and put 1.0.4 w the original name, but despite doing the whole ''Set IINA as the deafult application'' when 1.0.4 is open, when i tried to open a file it try to open it w the 1.0.6 i archived and renamed.... i can only reset every filetype one by one in the getinfo, i think you need to fix that the ''Set IINA as the deafult application'' will set the specific iina currently in use as deafult app over other iina apps as well, and not just other apps in general, i guess thats another bug then....? at least make it set the iina w the deafult name in applications folder as a minimum fix.]

I not sure if this is related to MPV.
