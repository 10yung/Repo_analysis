What should I put where Rol says for Google Analytics? It does not appear in the screenshots of the documentation. :-(

How could I get Demographics Data and interests of the visitors for my users profiles from sub path pages like:
www.adSoldiers.com/${user-profile}

so I want to get age, gender and interest of each visitor for each specific user on my site, is this even possible with google analytics

I've done that using
public function performQuery(Period $period, string $metrics, array $others = [])

and using ('filter' => ga:pagePath=@/pagePath) it works with (ga:pageviews metric and ga:pagePath dimension ) as so:
	['dimensions' => 'ga:pagePath', "filters" => "ga:pagePath=@/test.php"]

but didn't work with (age, gender, interest) dimensions:
        ["dimensions" => "ga:userGender", "filters" => "ga:pagePath=@/test.php"]
