Steps to reproduce:

1. Create new project using ng new
2. ng serve 
3. connect on browser
4. click augury section in debug

Additional details:
I am getting this error on every Angular project I try Augury on.  Just downloaded and installed all the components in the last week so they are all pretty current.

I created a brand new project using ng new testAugury and then hit enter twice.  Launched this and augury told me it was not an angular project.  Restarted chrome and server same results.

Deleted project ran ng new testAugury again but this time said Y to "add Angular routing?" got same results.

I pulled the source for Augury from Git and found this code in src/backend/utils/app-check.ts
declare const getAllAngularTestabilities: Function;
declare const getAllAngularRootElements: Function;
declare const ng: any;

export const isAngular = () => {
  return typeof getAllAngularTestabilities === 'function'
    && typeof getAllAngularRootElements === 'function';
};

basically put that code into console.log on my project and it logs them as "undefined" (see attached screen shots).  

Tried both chrome and firefox dev edition.
Google Chrome is up to date
Version 78.0.3904.108 (Official Build) (64-bit)
Firefox Browser Developer 72.0b2(64 bit)

Seems like there is something weird going on with the latest stuff or I am just looking at the Augury code completely wrong.  I am completely new to this typescript/javascript/angular world so I very well may be looking at it wrong, or be missing some include or some other special thing I have no knowledge of.

Thanks and hope I wasn't too long winded, being doing dev for a lot of years and more information is most often better.  ;)

Description of issue:

Inside the router tree section, if the user's cursor overlaps with the popup showing the router's info, the popup starts to flicker.

Expected Behavior:
The popup should change its position or should not flicker, rather it should remain stable.


Steps to reproduce:

1. Open Augury dev tools for your angular app
2. Go to the router tree section
3. Hover on one of the trees, such that your cursor and the popup overlap.

Allow hiding the tab of the other DevTools tools as long as the inspected site does not use Angular, just like the Vue and React tools do

When component contains window then state doesnt show(we have message: "No state to show").
I think it is connection with this bugs: #1389, #1368.

I have solution:
my changes in augury/src/utils/serialize.ts
```
import { parse, stringify } from 'jsan';

/// The intent of serialize() is to create a function that is itself able to
/// reconstruct {@param object} into an exact clone that includes circular
/// references and objects that are not normally serializable by something like
/// {@link JSON.stringify}. It returns a string containing the code for the
/// reconstructor function. That value can be passed to a Function constructor
/// which will parse it into a function that can then be invoked to recreate
/// the original object. In this way we are able to serialize an object for
/// transmission across thread boundaries even if it is very complex and
/// contains `unserializable' constructs (like circular references). This is
/// used in our message passing operations to reliably send complex objects.

function windowReplacer(key, value) {
  if (value && value.window === value) {
    return '[WINDOW]';
  }
  return value;
}

/// Serialize a complex object into a function that can recreate the object.
export const serialize = value => {
  return stringify(value, windowReplacer, null, false);
};

/// Deserialize a function string and invoke the resulting object recreator.
export const deserialize = value => {
  return value === 'null' || value === null ? null : parse(value);
};
```

I found the same problem in other extension:
https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension/issues/598
and here is fix:
https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension/commit/adbda742676f3f17819440517c3b7260a6455373


Augury version (required): 1.23.0
Angular version (required): 7.2.15

I see Augury already supports expand/collapse element tree using Ctrl+Click, which is great! It would be nice to have this feature for the component state.
