Hi Eddy! 
Awesome work with this plugin. 
I came across a weird issue, can you guide me a little towards the right direction.

Problem : When sharing a sms on iOS, a popup opens, which nudges the body element with a style="height: calc(100% - XXXpx)", this again disappears after the popup is closed, however this disrupts my app's behaviour and keeps it enlarged. Attached the before after images.

Hi!!

I don't know why but <i> tag doesn't work in iOS sharing. Is there any workaround?
Thanks
iOS version: 13.3
Plugin version: 5.6.3
Platform: Ionic 2 / Cordova

Calling `share` or `shareWithOptions` does not seem to work when you define `message` or an array of files. This is on Ionic 2, but it seems to be a plugin issue as inspecting the plugin in Xcode shows that `activityItems` on [line 130](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin/blob/master/src/ios/SocialSharing.m#L130) has the correct values.

Example Component:

```typescript
import { Component, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';
import { SocialSharing } from '@ionic-native/social-sharing/ngx';

@Component({
  selector: 'example',
  templateUrl: 'example.html'
})
export class ExampleComponent {

    @ViewChild(Content) content: Content;

    constructor(
        private socialSharing: SocialSharing,
    ) { }

    async shareFile(fileURI: string) {
        await this.socialSharing.shareWithOptions({
            message: "Message",
            subject: "Subject",
            files: [fileURI],
        });
    }
}
```

In the plugin `activityItems` will be an `NSMutableArray` of the message string and an NSURL representing the resource, which is expected.

For our application, we need to share a text message caption along with a video. We need to present all the options, and when the Messages app is selected, we expect to see "Message" followed by the playable video (via the filepath of the video on the device). Instead we see the following occurrences:

1. Only the video is present.
2. Only the message caption is present.

If `fileURI` is an online resource served via HTTPS, only the video is correctly displayed the first time and playable (1). However if you click "Cancel" on the New Message Modal, and then click Messages again: the video disappears, and only the message caption is present (2). If `fileURI` is a resource on the device, only scenario 1 happens.

Switching the block from executing on the commandDelegate to execute on the main dispatch queue has no effect either.

Is our desired functionality possible via `shareWithOptions`?

Any help would be greatly appreciated
The documentation says "This plugin requires permissions to the users photos.". I was wondering - why, actually? It doesn't contain any functionality of users selecting photo from photo library or camera roll - the only option is to pass an URL. 

Is this permission needed, because the plugin still needs "read" permissions to access that photo library file? (file:/// and so on)
The subject is always displayed as 'undefined' when I shared it onto WhatsApp (and Facebook) on my Android phone.

Is anyone facing the same issue?
When opening the social sharing and clicking on Twitter, the dialog will present itself and close itself in a matter of 1 - 2 seconds, making it impossible for me to use.
Hello,

In android devices it's working fine,  but on ios device, we are facing an issue.  Only text message shared to whatsapp but image not shared. 

Please help to solve this issue as soon as possible.

window.plugins.socialsharing.share('Details: 7.00W769202 7.076 BR I+ SI2 EX EX EX GIA', null,Â ["https://starrays.com/diaImages/WaterMark/769202.jpg", "https://starrays.com/diaImages/WaterMark/769202A.jpg", "https://starrays.com/diaImages/WaterMark/769202AS.jpg", "https://starrays.com/diaImages/WaterMark/769202H.jpg", "https://starrays.com/diaImages/Movies/MV769202.mp4", "https://starrays.com/PDF/'6194970935.pdf"],'',success , err);

canShareVia is returning error call back for Instagram and WhatsApp in iOS 13+. I have both url schemes whitelisted... Anyone have any clues as to why?

When I use the `window.plugins.socialsharing.share` generic share, and then select WhatsApp, it will work.

Thanks!
Hi. I try to share a simple text via cordova-plugin-x-socialsharing but when I test my app, the share window appear, select an option (in this case Whatsapp), the window hide and nothing happend. Xcode in the debug window let me this errors:

How can I fix this issue? Is need a special setting  in addition the whitelist to it work?

Thank you very much
For one of our plugins I needed to upgrade all dependencies which also included cordova-android 8.1 and AndroidX.

Now we have trouble to get the sharing work on Android, if the share includes images. Without images, the share works fine.

```
this.socialSharing.shareWithOptions({
    subject: 'Subject',
    files: [base64Image],
    message: 'Message'
}))
``` 

```
