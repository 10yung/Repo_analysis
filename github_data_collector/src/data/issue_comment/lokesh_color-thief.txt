Currently we are using the `width` and `height` attributes of the `HTMLImageElement` to set the size of the created `HTMLCanvasElement`. However these two attributes are depending on the styles of the `HTMLImageElement`. This will make the result inconsistent and untestable.

For example, if we take these two`img`s, we may get different results. Because the pixel data is different.

```html
<img src="foo.png"  width="100" height="100" />
<img src="foo.png" width="200" height="200" />
```



Use the `naturalWidth` and `naturalHeight` will set the size of the canvas the same as the intrinsic size of the image file. This will assure the pixelcount is always the same for the same image file.

Can you update color-thief to canvas 2.6.0?
I'm not 100% sure that this is the issue, but it's most likely, because when I'm trying to install canvas@2.5.0 standalone, I get the same error, but I don't with @ 2.6.0.
I'm installing all dependencies for canvas
```
RUN apt-get install -y build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev 
```
Here is my error
```

I believe you meant to check `!Number.isInteger(quality)`, not the inverse. Also, I feel hard-coding the upper limit of 20 shouldn't be a thing, and that it should be a default option.

the first picture was from the website.( https://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/)

the second picture, i download the dist from github.

i compared two pictures, the result is different. why ?
I'm working with logos, and I need to know the color of the background's logo.
So, I was thinking to get the color of the top/botom left pixel.
How can do that? Thanks
Would be great to be able to specify a square on the picture (0-1 x 0-1 x 0-1 x 0-1) and compute the colour from that?

Use case: I'm using a gradient that overlaps the bottom of the image and I'd like to get the colours from the lower third of the picture instead of the whole thing!

Thanks!
Using color-thief for green-screen or blue-screen detection, sometimes the clothes or skin color of the person are more dominant than the background.

How about to give an input color e.g. #00FF00 for green to the function that it can look for the closest dominant color to the input value?
First, thanks for this great _Library_!

Working with this cool _Library_ (congrats and thanks!) in `node.js`, in particular making [responsimage](https://github.com/elrumordelaluz/responsimage/) I found that the `image` (input) value could be not only a path string to the image but also a `Buffer`, [since the `url` argument](https://github.com/scijs/get-pixels#install): 

> It can be a relative path, an http url, a data url, or an in-memory Buffer.

And this is cool, and sound coherent when working in `node`.
But in this scenario I found that the second argument `type` is needed:

> type is an optional mime type for the image (required when using a Buffer)

So made this PR to fix that part, adding the relative test. ~Keep in mind that I didn't include the `/dist` with bundled files.~ I added this folder to let use my repo as the `packages` source in the meanwhile (otherwise, some projects are broken)

Let me know in any case and thanks again for this great _Library_!
