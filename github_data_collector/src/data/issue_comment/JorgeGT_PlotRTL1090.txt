I'm getting this error while running the script.
`Error in plotRTL1090 (line 34)
        if aicraft{i}.validposition`
Hi @JorgeGT !
I have two ideas for new features:
- generate list of all unique ICAO code,
- generate list of all received plane registration codes,

I'd do it myself but my coding skills are weak:(

Meanwhile, take a look at the visualization of air traffic over the Poland - 24 hours on the Christmas Eve 2014. I use rtl_sdr dongle, your script and Comet DS-3000 antenna mounted 10 meters above the ground. On the animation you can see the two airports. Copernicus Airport Wrocław (EPWR, further south from bulls eye center) and Poznań–Ławica Henryk Wieniawski Airport (EPPO, further north form my location).

I found loadjson that works with octave that might work better than matlabjson:
http://iso2mesh.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?jsonlab/loadjson.m

Trying to see if the rest will work in octave -- i've got data in a file accumulating but it seems to be ascii and not binary.
