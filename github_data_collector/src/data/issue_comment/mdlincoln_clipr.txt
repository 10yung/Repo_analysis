clipr currently supports X11 on Linux. Wayland is a replacement for X11 that is gathering support.  The [`wl-clipboard`](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) tool provides a clipboard for Wayland via the commans `wl-copy` and `wl-paste`.  This commit adds support for those commands.
As the  question stated at

From my testing it seems that clipr only works with text data. Would it be possible for it to work on images too? 

I implemented something like that for my spindler package (code [here](https://github.com/eliocamp/spindler/blob/master/R/addIn.R) only tested the linux part) and realised that maybe it would be coold to have it on clipr.
