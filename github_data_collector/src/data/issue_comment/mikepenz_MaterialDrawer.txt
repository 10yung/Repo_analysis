Is there any design doc or issue(s) we should be looking at for the 8.0.0 update? For instance, why is xml now introduced?
Not tied to any version, but posted as of 7.x.x

Now that most of the libraries are kotlin first, will there be plans to introduce kotlin dsl?
Material Drawer has the benefit of other libraries such as https://github.com/zsmb13/MaterialDrawerKt, which makes writing code in kotlin much easier.

I think it would be worthwhile to have the two projects merged if both you and @zsmb13 approve; I don't think there will be much of a difference if you rewrote the DSL, since most of them retain the same names.
