Did anyone wrote a component to hide navbar on scroll and slide up the tabs while its hidden and show up as soon scroll starts opposite direction?
Similarly, same we can do with fab menu's.

Howdy, I just started using Ionic and I have no idea how to use components in my app. 
Specifically, I'm interested in the accordion component.
How was the left side menu (menuToggle) implemented?

Hey guys,

From one open-source contributor to another, I just want to start off by saying amazing job with this project.  The work, the guide to run locally, excellent job all around.

I know Issues is typically reserved for Bugs & Feature requests, but I wanted to use it to have a quick conversation so I have the best understanding of what I might be getting myself into by using the navigation-within-a-modal pattern that you've so kindly shared.  

Are there any known tradeoffs with the pattern?  Are there any changes to expectations for nav flow within the modal?
