Currently, eva-icons only works in browser-environments. It would be nice to have the ability to use it in static site generators (like [11ty](https://www.11ty.io/)) as the generated SVGs are static and don't need to be generated in the browser, if they could be generated during the build. 

Getting error Cannot resolve definitions for module 'eva-icons' on  import * as eva from 'eva-icons'; in app-component.ts after installing via npm i have also added the   <script src="https://unpkg.com/eva-icons"></script> in the index.html


Icons can be like [restaurant_menu](https://material.io/tools/icons/static/icons/outline-restaurant_menu-24px.svg) icon or [fastfood](https://material.io/tools/icons/static/icons/outline-fastfood-24px.svg) icon from [Material Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons)
Hello, I love your icons and I'm using them in my current project!

Do you think it would be a good idea to add `Like` and `Dislike` icons? (Something like thumbs up and thumbs down)

I'm currently using heart for `Like` and I'm finding it hard to find a dislike alternative.

Wishing a nice day!
Added how to use it in angular.
Hi, I often use the sketch file with the icons to use them in my designs.
The only problem I am facing is that it's very hard to see which icons have both a filled and outlined design.

If I see an icon filled, I have a hard time finding them outlined, and vice-versa.

I think it could be greatly improved if the icons that have 2 versions are in the same order, and only those who have just 1 version come last.
**Feature request**
Request you to add following icons:
- Language (for i18n)
- Accessibility 
- Scatter chart
- Gauge chart 
- Dashboard
- Heat map
- Credit cards (specific for popular brands like Amex, visa and master )
- **For Maps**:
   - Transportation types (cycle/bike, motor bike, walking, cab, car, rail, flight and bus) 
   - Traffic light, traffic cone, tow-away, speed limit (20, 40, 60, 80) and other traffic signs
   - First responder (medical, fire, police).
   - Buildings (government, residential, hotel, individual house, apartment etc.)
   - Parking, parks, camping, tourist attraction, museum etc.
   - Routing
- Unlink (complement icon for link icon which exists)
 
Tests should be added for build icons process.
