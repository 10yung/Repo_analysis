Hallo,

i've installed shinyData locally as described. After starting with shinyData::shinyData()
it seems to work but i can't use Open Sample Project with Sample1.sData.
Nothing opens.
In R commandline i get "Error in assign(name, func, environment()) : 
  variable names are limited to 10000 bytes"
Maybe you've an idea how to solve the problem?

Regards
Walter

Hi,
may I ask you for some assistance. Every time I try to load data(different data sets in. csv) I get and the process stops:

`Warning: file ‘0’ has magic number '"Stor'
  Use of save versions prior to 2 is deprecated
Warning: Unhandled error in observer: bad restore file magic number (file may be corrupted) -- no data loaded
observe({
    inFile <- input[["loadProject"]]
    isolate({
        if (!is.null(inFile)) {
            loadProject(file = inFile$datapath, replaceOrMerge = input[["loadProjectAction"]])
        }
    })
})`
