i'm pretty sure this is useful, right?
Using ZSH on Debian 10, after loading the BASH completions file in .zshrc, trying to autocomplete msm commands results in an error.

I have ZSH loading the completions file with the following lines at the end of my .zshrc:
```
autoload -U +X compinit
compinit
autoload -U +X bashcompinit
bashcompinit
source /etc/bash_completion.d/msm
```
When I try to complete a command by typing
```console
% sudo msm <tab>
```
I get
```console
% sudo msm /etc/init.d/msm:1199: parse error near `|'
_msm:8: command not found: manager_property
                                 sudo msm
all       config    help      jargroup  restart   server    start     stop      update    version 
```
Further tab presses allow me to select an option, but further garbage is output to the prompt.
I'm starting out setting up a Spigot 1.13.2 server and I'm trying to figure which version of Minecraft Server Manager I should use, anybody know? Thanks!
The server runs fine but logs aren't being created. Changing the permissions of the log directory doesn't seem to do anything.
I just saw a very simple PR from 2014 that is still open on this project.

The last commit was from last year.

Does this project need assistance?

Is it dead?

Are people using alternatives?

Thanks!
When trying to set a server config value, the sed replacement could fail causing the value to not be set.

For example, here I am trying to set a server specific config for the invocation of the java command with the -jar argument pointing to a test jar in my home directory.

```
$ msm mcnewb config msm-invocation "java -Xms{RAM}M -Xmx{RAM}M -XX:+AggressiveOpts -jar /home/ins/test-server.jar nogui"
sed: -e expression #1, char 91: unknown option to `s'
```

Here is the current sed line.
https://github.com/msmhq/msm/blob/1b93ba85cefa45a8e8c4e857c5bdaebac1e21521/init/msm#L3201

The expansion of the `$3` (value) variable is breaking the sed replacement pattern because it is using `/` as the pattern delimiter.  The `/` at the start of the -jar path appears as an additional (unknown) option to the search `s/` command.


Here is a simplified sed replacement that uses `#` instead of `/` as the pattern delimiter, which allows the "value" to contain slashes.

```sed -i "s#$2=.*#$2=$3#g" "${SERVER_CONF[$1]}"```

The default java invocation uses unrecognized (CMSIncrementalPacing) and deprecated (UseConcMarkSweepGC) VM options under Java 10

From the /etc/msm.conf file
```
DEFAULT_INVOCATION="java -Xms{RAM}M -Xmx{RAM}M -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSIncrementalPacing -XX:+AggressiveOpts -jar {JAR} nogui"
```

When trying to start the server, it would say `Starting server... Done.` but it doesn't actually start.  Because java doesn't even start up, nothing is sent to the log file which made it very confusing on why it was failing.

When manually running the command, I am shown the actual error message
```
$ java -Xms2048M -Xmx2048M -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSIncrementalPacing -XX:+AggressiveOpts -jar /opt/msm/servers/foo/server.jar nogui
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: Option UseConcMarkSweepGC was deprecated in version 9.0 and will likely be removed in a future release.
Unrecognized VM option 'CMSIncrementalPacing'
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.
```

This is on a fresh install of Ubuntu 18.04.1 Server with `apt install default-jdk` and `apt install default-jre` installing Java v10.0.2.

```
# java -version
openjdk version "10.0.2" 2018-07-17
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 10.0.2+13-Ubuntu-1ubuntu0.18.04.3)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 10.0.2+13-Ubuntu-1ubuntu0.18.04.3, mixed mode)
```

When I ran the command again but without the `-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSIncrementalPacing` arguments, the server started up without issue.

Since Java 10 is now the default version, it is likely more people are going to encounter this issue.
Suggestions:

1. Check the java version and if it is >9 then don't use these options.
2. The as_user function should log a message if the `su` command fails
3. The as_user function or the server_start function should capture stderr to the log when trying to start the server just in case there are problems like this. 


`msm jargroup getlatest minecraft
Downloading latest version... Checking minecraft version JSON... -su: jq: command not found
Done.
Failed. No files were downloaded.
`

Any ideas? 

I already tried creating a fresh new jargroup using "minecraft" in place of the URL. 

Much thanks. 
`sudo msm the-world jar minecraft

All from the auto installation. Permissions seem fine.
Installing wget via yum on RedHat to allow the script to bootstrap itself.  Also added #!/bin/sh to touched files.
