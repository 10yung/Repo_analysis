Hi,

thanks for this awesome switch.
My app supports SDK versions up to version 17 and I use SVG icons for the sticky switch. So I've tested my app in a virtual device with SDK version 17 and the app crahses by inflating the layout with following exception
[exception.txt](https://github.com/GwonHyeok/StickySwitch/files/1602840/exception.txt)

It seems that the sticky switch doesn't support SVGs in older versions. If I use PNG icons, the app doesn't crash.
Hi,
thanks for developing such a great library.
Is there possible to define a mode where switching left/right is only possible with swyping to the directions and not responding to the clicks?
Hi @GwonHyeok 
I just imported this project into my Android Studio and run the same in Nogut OS, switch button not working can you please check
Hi,

How to use it into a toolbar as a menu please ?
I would like to create a view like this one [https://www.uplabs.com/posts/map-to-list-view](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/map-to-list-view)

Thanks
Hello I am using your library to my project and it is displayed perfectly inside a RelativeLayout. But when I move RelativeLayout inside a NestedScrollView the view is gone.
I think you should use static variables instead of enum's

this will take around 1,112 bytes
```
public static enum Things {
    THING_1,
    THING_2;
};
```

Or you can have two static int which will take 128 bytes.

```
public static final int THING_1 = 1;
public static final int THING_2 = 2;
```
