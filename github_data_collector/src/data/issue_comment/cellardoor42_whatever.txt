I'am impressed of your software. Really, really nice. Thanks to the dev's!!!

I get this error message: (DagWallet:21349): Pango-ERROR **: 05:45:23.866: Harfbuzz version too old (1.2.1)
Although my harfbuzz verion is:

local/harfbuzz 2.6.2-1
    OpenType text shaping engine
local/harfbuzz-icu 2.6.2-1
    OpenType text shaping engine (ICU integration)
local/lib32-harfbuzz 2.6.2-1
    OpenType text shaping engine (32-bit)


This app has a statically linked harfbuzz library that is incompatible with the current Achlinux pango library  ï¼Ÿ
Whatever Refused to allow me to login says password to google chrome is not the right Password.
Whatever does not run. Running from terminal gives following error message:
/opt/Whatever/whatever: error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Is there a way to provide markdown support like [Marxico](http://marxi.co/) ? 
Since about 2 days ago, when I start Whatever, I get a message saying:
"Sorry, we don't support your browser at this moment...."

The only workaround for this issue is to either open Evernote Web in a regular Chrome tab, or download their app if your OS is supported (Linux isn't). Any ideas if/when this might be fixed? 

Thanks in advance,

Clicking on a link in the note will result in error:
Evernote error: access is denied

> Oops, we encountered an error.

> Access denied.
> You have accessed a location on this server that is not available.
> You may need to Sign in to your account to access this page.

Ideally, it should open the link in an external browser.  Thank you.

I've got a couple of old notes that have attachments instead of the text/images included right in the note. They show up as a gray bar with a paperclip icon. When I try to click it, it opens an Evernote "access denied" window and wants me to log in. I log in inside this second window, but the attachment doesn't open. I end up with a second full Evernote window within the main Whatever window.

I'm going to use the web client to rework these attachments, but I thought I'd report it anyway.

I can't find the way to search for text within an open note. Ctrl+F does not work. For the web version of Evernote this funcionality is provided by browser search.
