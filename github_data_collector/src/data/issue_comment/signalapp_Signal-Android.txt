### Bug description
Signal is prefering contact data from the sim card over the "real" contacts from the phone.

### Steps to reproduce
- "export" contacts to your sim (there are multiple sim management tools available that can help with it)
- wait a bit (until Signal refreshes its knowledge about contacts, whatever time interval that is)

Now, the interesting part here is: SIM contacts are very limited in length (16 characters), so longer names get truncated.

And Signal shows truncated names all of a sudden.

Also, when you exported contacts a while ago, it may happen you change the name of one of your contacts using the usual android ways. With a usual setup, thats a local phonebook or a google addressbook. Whatever. Name is changed. Default Android Contact app shows changed name.

Signal won't. Ever. It uses the (possibly truncated or by now just wrong) name from the SMS.

Android also allows you to select "Which contacts to display" (in contacts app settings, slightly different where exactly, depending on the app) and about all of Android then follows this. Say, you select Google and Phone Contacts only, disabling SMS. You wont see the SMS stored ones - except in Signal.

**Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)
Follow the same as the rest, honor the "addressbooks to display". Wherever that setting ends up, it appears to be central (using multiple different dialers, they all follow what any of them set).
Or add an own option that lets one disable some sources for contacts.

### Device info
**Signal version:** According to play store, 4.53.6 from 13. January 2020

### Bug Description

When I try to send attachments, specifically images/pictures, when I am connected to a Wi-Fi network, the message will not be sent/uploaded properly. The message will be shown as loading, but the process of sending seems to stall. I am only experiencing this when I am using a Wi-Fi network, sending attachments via mobile data network works fine without any issues. 

When I switch to a mobile data network during uploading, the message will be sent quickly. Interestingly, sending text messages (without any file attached) works completely fine when sent via Wi-Fi.

This error does not come up all the time, this rather seems to be an issue with some contacts only. Unfortunately, I could not find out why specifically...

### Steps to Reproduce

<!-- Using bullet points, list the steps that reproduce the bug. -->

1.  Select a conversation from the list and/or your contacts
2.  Connect to a Wi-Fi network (and turn off mobile data)
3.  Add an attachment to the message
4.  Send the message
5.  (Deactivate Wi-Fi network and connect to mobile data network)

Actual Result:

Sending the message/attachment will not start or stall before starting. The problem persists, waiting does not solve it.

Expected Result:

The message, including the attachments, should be sent immediately, no matter what network you are connected too (as long as your network is properly connected to the internet).

### Bug description

When tapping "Gallery" when attaching something, the Screenshots folder does not show.

### Steps to reproduce

2. Open a Signal conversation
3. Tap the "+" button to attach something (note that in the strip of recent photos at the top, recent screenshots _do_ actually show)
4. Tap "Gallery"
5. Look for the Screenshots folder

**Actual result:** the Screenshots folder does not appear.
**Expected result:** It appears.

### Device info

**Device:** Pixel 3a XL
**Android version:** 10

On my device screenshots are stored at `/sdcard/Pictures/Screenshots`. Interestingly, other folders in there are not shown either (for example, `/sdcard/Pictures/Raw` is not shown in Signal's gallery view) although raw images _do_ show up in the "All media" view.

### Bug Description

As in the title : when either searching for a term in a conversation, or a recipient to send a message to, accentuated uppercase charactres (e.g. "É") are considered different than the same accentuated but lowercase character (e.g. "é").

Language is french.

### Steps to Reproduce

<!-- Using bullet points, list the steps that reproduce the bug. -->

1.  Open Signal
2.  Tap the "Search field"
3.  Type (for instance) "éric"

Actual Result:

My contact "Éric" is not shown.

Expected Result:

My contact "Éric" is shown.
I need to explicitely type "Éric" (or "ÉRIC", or any other upper/lowercase combination except for "É")
Also, typing "eric" or "Eric" or "ERIC" (etc.) should also display "Éric".
