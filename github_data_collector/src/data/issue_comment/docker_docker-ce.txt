The CONTRIBUTINGmd didn't cover patches against older documentation.

Couldn't see how to create a PR against 17.09 in https://github.com/moby/moby

Also needs a fix in 17.10 (API 1.33).

The 17.11 (API 1.34) branch contains the same text so it should be ok.
This repository was missing a license, but since it's been created mostly from bits of `github.com/docker/docker`, I figured that license was probably appropriate for this top-level (since the individual vendored directories should have their `LICENSE` files intact anyhow).

A quick `diff` to show that it's 100% identical:

```console
$ diff -u \
  <(curl -fsSL 'https://github.com/docker/docker/raw/master/LICENSE') \
  <(curl -fsSL 'https://github.com/tianon/docker-ce/raw/license/LICENSE')
$ 
```
