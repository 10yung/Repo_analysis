Hi, when I install proxychains like this https://www.cnblogs.com/xuyaowen/p/proxychians4.html
I got different output when I input this 
 ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32031556/72495060-b00ed780-3860-11ea-977c-1150724c081e.png)

So I can not install proxychain-ng.
Could you please help me to install proxychain?
Thanks a lot.
Hello,
I would like to only enable proxychains for an ip ranges, is it possible?
My requirement is that a program is receiving data and then redirects it to somewhere elese, and I want to enable the proxy in the receieving process, its a live stream so it needs to be done in a single command:
ffmpeg -i rtmp://sourceLiveAddr -f flv rtmp://dstAddr
while the source address is static IP but the destnation address is domain names, so thats why I need the whitelist mode.

Thank you

I have 2 VMs  runs same OS: Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS, one of them has this issue.
ssh client can't work with proxychains, such as:
```
$ proxychains4 ssh git@github.com
[proxychains] config file found: /etc/proxychains.conf
[proxychains] preloading /usr/lib/libproxychains4.so
ssh: Could not resolve hostname github.com: Temporary failure in name resolution
```
Just like it's no proxy at all. But when I switch to root, It works.
The other VM does't has this problem. So weird. Almost same VM, same OS, same user.
Is there anyway to debug?
Hello everybody.

I tried to find some more issues about this online but failed. Sorry if it has been addressed already.

I found out about proxychains4 few days ago. So far I've been using the default proxychains deployment from Raspbian (Debian for Raspberry Pi) Buster, which is 3.1-8.1. I started working on some scripts in which I wanted to parse the responses from the proxified and direct connections in the same way so I realized that only proxychains4 actually has a -q switch to help me achieve that easily. I am currently running proxychains4 version 4.13-4.

Anyway, everything else works fine except one (important) thing.
Since this is running on Raspberry Pi constantly connected to the internet via VPN, I am using proxychains to renew my letsencrypt certificate via public IP assigned to me by my ISP (I am running SSH server on another device in my home network through which proxychains tunnels the request outside).
I use dehydrated (https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated) for letsencrypt renewal and it worked fine for more than a year via proxychains3 but when I try to use it via proxychains4 there is an error message.

When I rerun dehydrated with proxychains3 or without proxychains, it works fully without any issues.

proxychains4 doesn't works for sha-bang commands on my machine. such as `npm`.

```
proxychains4 npm install npm -g

proxychains4 will work, if call `npm` directly with `node`

```
proxychains4 node /Users/MeXXX/.nvs/default/bin/npm install npm -g

```

Please add rules for allowed outgoing ports. 
Please add allow, deny outgoing ports rules.

like adding 
```
out_port_rule 80,443 # it will allow only ports 80, 443 to connect via the proxy and dropping all other ports, 
# or you can add 1:443 to allow all ports from 1 to 443 while blocking all others.
[ProxyList]
http 210.215.131.178 46314
```

Like adding out_port_rule 443 to the conf file will drop all other connections except port 
like this config should behave like:
```
out_port_rule 443
[ProxyList]
http 210.215.131.178 46314
```

proxychains4 curl https://google.com // Should go through fine.

proxychains4 curl http://google.com // It should be dropped.

So I don't know how I should run flatpak apps under proxychains. I am currently trying to run it with FreeTube. But the command to run FreeTube from flatpak is the following: 

/usr/bin/flatpak run --branch=stable --arch=x86_64 --command=/app/bin/run.sh --file-forwarding io.freetubeapp.FreeTube @@u %u @@

And I tried putting __proxychains4__ in there but it never worked lol.
Hi,
I have proxy server from luminati.io and 2 issues:
1. Connections to port 80 denied, but 443 OK. Luminati.io allows both 80 and 443 (only these 2 ports are opened)

2. When I open HTTPS sites it shows that my IP is 162.243.139.129 (US), but I configured everything in admin panel to show so-called "assigned IP", in TOR system this is called an Exit Node (last node).
When I enter all setttings in Firefox parameters and not using Proxychains4 - everything works: I can connect to 80 port websites, and my IP is shown as I am not in US, in a different country.
proxy_dns not working at all, I think because of proxy server has port 53 closed.

Please, check luminati.io compatibility, what is wrong? Service is free. Or you can use my account to test it if you'd like.

Hi rofl0r. You are sorry for my level of English. I am from Ukraine, I am 14 years old and I am a girl. Please be softer with me.
This is problem. I downloaded proxychains-ng and it does not work. My operating system is Kali Linux.
I watched a lot of videos on YouTube and searched for a solution on the Internet. Nothing helps.
