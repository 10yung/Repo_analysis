Hi all,
I would like to ask if it is possible to add an image to a form. For example, I have created the new form and between a title and a description I want to put the picture there. Or any other ideas? Should I extend something inside a browsercms? As I can see, I think adding the picture somewhere in a form is not allowed, is it?

![zaznaczenie_016](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/34706/10067824/c29277a4-629f-11e5-90d2-92f2b82b20bf.jpg)

When the page name is long, visual_editor_toggle buttons are pushed off the view (not visible).
<div id="visual_editor_toggle">

It's bunch of fixes found in rails-4.0 branch
- rename current_user to current_cms_user
- update compass-rails
- upgrade to paperclip 4.3
- fix forms editor
- fix cms domain setting

End user reported when she added an image on the "People" section of the website, the formatting was off. The newly uploaded image is larger than the previously uploaded images. Checked the CMS backend but don't see anything to confirm images should be adjusted.

Is this a coding issue?

How could I create a theme using foundation 5?

Not really a bug, but for users that may wish to be able to publish html code within the WYSIWYG editor, a line needs to be added to the CKE config file.

CKEDITOR.config.allowedContent = true;

Note that the inline editor (if tables is not turned on via the toolbar) will not allow table code to be displayed properly and will overwrite whatever content is in the inline editable area. Once the toolbar is updated to have the table button, this seems to fix the content issue. The config.allowedcontent is still needed but this is something that does need to be sorted out.

The modal which opens after clicking "+" for "in-context editing" of a page is not active and appears to be part of the modal's slightly opaque background. As a result, clicking anywhere on the modal makes the modal close and the links to any content type inside the modal can't be accessed.

The links themselves, when accessed via the page source of the browser actually work and render the add new content dialog.
