###### Explanation About What Code Achieves:
<!-- Please explain why this code is necessary / what it does -->
  - The Travis CI build badge is duplicated in the README, this PR removes the duplicate.
Allow withMinimum behavior of `calcYAxisParameters() `to be set as option for the chart.

###### Explanation About What Code Achieves:
<!-- Please explain why this code is necessary / what it does -->
  - I have a line chart displayed, that has the values in the range ~200k-300k. The Y axis range is 100k-300k. I would like to force the Y axis to show the range 0-300k. I identified in code the method that calculates the range, `calcYAxisParameters()`, and saw that it has a parameter `withMinimum`, but it is set automatically to true if the chart is of type 'line'. My change allows this to be set as a parameter for the chart. If it's not set, it will maintain the current behavior, so there are no breaking changes.

###### Steps To Test:
<!-- What would someone do to be able to see the effects of your code? -->
  - Create a line chart with values in the range ~200k-300k
  - See that the chart lines go below the baseline of the chart, and the Y axis range is 100k-300k
  - Add to the options object the option: `withMinimum: false`
  - See that the chart lines go only to the baseline of the chart, and the Y axis range is 0-300k


###### TODOs:
<!-- Is there any tests or logic that isn't in the pr that you want the reviewer to know about? -->
  - None

I have the following chart in which I'd like to be able to click the last point and get the information (value and label data) but I'm not able to. I need to click on it directly and not clicking firstly on another and then on the last one.
Am I missing something?

Frappé Charts version: 1.3.0

Here is my code
import {Chart} from 'frappe-charts/dist/frappe-charts.min.cjs'
data = {
    labels: ["Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"],
    datasets: [
        { values: [18, 40, 30, 35, 8, 52, 17, -4] }
    ]
}

const DemoChart=new Chart( "#chart", {
    data: data,
    type: 'bar',
    height: 140,
    colors: ['red']
});

export default DemoChart

For example it may be used in year-to-year charts, when lattest year is not ended.
I am sorry if I am using the wrong portal for requesting an explanation but I coudn't find the community page for such things.

I work in ERPNext and want a way to be able to merge this into the existing chart functionality in it. For example. when I select a"Toggle Chart, the pop-up shows the list of all the chart types (like bar, stacked bar, mixed, etc) and based on the chart type the option should change and visualized post clicking and reviewing the preview.

Added Funnel Chart
