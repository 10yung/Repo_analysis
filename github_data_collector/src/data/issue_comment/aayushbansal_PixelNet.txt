Hi, thank you for your great work!
I find that the trained models listed in the README in this page: https://github.com/aayushbansal/PixelNet/tree/master/models/generalizability are not found (404).
Where can I download the trained models?

Thanks!
I have solved it.
@aayushbansal it seems that during seg_image_provider you permute dimension of the image [here](https://github.com/aayushbansal/PixelNet/blob/master/experiments/train/utils/seg_image_provider.m#L22) but i don't see the equivalent in seg_label_provider [here] (https://github.com/aayushbansal/PixelNet/blob/master/experiments/train/utils/seg_label_provider.m) which i beleive might lead to a missmatch of pixels and their annotation and also resizing with different flags(bilinear,antialiasing in seg_image_provider and nearest in seg_label_provider) doesn't have any effect on training?
Hello Aayush, 

Could you please share the training code for normals as an example? Thanks!
