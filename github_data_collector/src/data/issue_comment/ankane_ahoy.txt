Hello, 
I'm not very familiar with this codebase but I'm trying to setup Ahoy to work with polymorphic users.

The `Ahoy::Visit` works well, all I needed to do was to add the `user_type` column and the `belongs_to :user, polymorphic: true` option to it.

So I figured that it will be easy with `Ahoy::Event` as well but, it wasn't. It keeped saving only the `user_id` and never the `user_type`. So I found this line:
https://github.com/ankane/ahoy/blob/13f029f457fb79f910e41d7a64accebe4012814d/lib/ahoy/tracker.rb#L26

It seems that it sets only the `user_id` before saving the event. 

Anyway, I got it working with a simple workaround. 
I'm using this `before_validation` callback in the `Ahoy::Event`:

```ruby
before_validation :set_user_from_visit
[...]

def set_user_from_visit
  return true unless visit&.user&.present?
  self.user   = visit.user
end
```

But is not ideal. So, is it possible to have the `Event` working with a polymorphic user, as `Visit` does, without needing this callback?

Thank you,
Duccio

I have the following message when I try to install Ahoy :

```
Could not find a declaration file for module 'ahoy.js'. 
'...... /node_modules/ahoy.js/dist/ahoy.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
  Try `npm install @types/ahoy.js` if it exists or add a new declaration (.d.ts) file containing `declare module 'ahoy.js';`
```

How can I fix it ?

ruby = 2.6.5
rails = 6.0.2.1
