When I open ncmpcpp, it will display no music and display the error `ncmpcpp: Connection refused`. After a few reboots, it will sometimes instead show no music for a few seconds then the error: `ncmpcpp: Timeout while connecting`. 
Hello,

I've installed fzf and Ranger's config files but when I try to locate files with `ctrl+l`, fzf doesn't load anything while `ctrl+f` work as intended.
I've installed the same files on another computer and both shortcuts work.

I have no Idea on where to start to resolve the issue. Which folders should I check ?
Thank you !
casing is sensitive on the rmd/Rmd files, without the uppercase option opout was not functioning for me on default LARBS with thinkpad x220. 

tested on home system and verified that functionality as intended is achieved with the `*.Rmd` option is added to the case statement
Removed redundant keyboard shortcut that can be found in the sxhkdrc config

fix(aliasrc): make aliasrc more portable
I dunno what is causing this, but ranger constantly fails to copy some files when I copy from my backup HDD to my main HDD, or the other way around, the permissions on the folder are the same as every other folder which copies successfully which are : drwxr-xr-x

here is a screenshot of what ranger displays when it fails to copy: [https://0x0.st/znnu.png](https://0x0.st/znnu.png)

what am I doing wrong? :)

When using dmenumount to mount a usb stick it while my backup drive is already mounted it doesn't show me a list of available directories. Mounting itself works.

It appears to happen because the find command fails to find the directories. Which it does because $alreadymounted contains some weird string `-not \( -path */run/media/backup -prune \) \`  

This is the line:
`alreadymounted=$(lsblk -nrpo "name,type,mountpoint" | awk '$2=="part"&&$3!~/\/boot|\/home$|SWAP/&&length($3)>1{printf "-not \\( -path *%s -prune \\) \\ \n",$3}')`
I am not very advanced with awk but from what I can tell what the command is supposed to do is print out the *something* if there is a partition mounted that isn't boot home or swap.
I don't know what this part it's trying to print out is supposed to do or why it is printing it out literally instead of executing it.  

In case it's relevant, the backup partition is mounted at /run/media/backup and also in my fstab.
In a fresh new void-linux install, everything is ok, but i can't get super + r, super + n etc. work. How proceed?
