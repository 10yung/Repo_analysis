Quartz Composer can't be used anymore unless Origami plugin is removed.
Any project will freeze continuously about every 2 seconds, no matter what it contains.
Strangely, opening any menu in the OSX top bar makes it work normally as long as the menu is displayed.
Executing a swipe gesture of more than a few seconds on an iOS device from Origami Live in any project causes both the app and the Viewer to freeze, requiring a full restart of both to continue. I've made certain to only have project open a time, and have tried doing a full uninstall and reinstall of Origami and Origami Live. I've also tried other iPhone cables. In the system console, I see the following:

Any ideas?

Can we have an xCode project template with retina support to send builds of Origami prototypes to Clients? .

I've tried using the Skanky SDK method to load unofficial API plugins but the mouse events(interaction2) patch isn't working as expected. See example https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31564678/xCodeTemplate%202.zip

On placing the phone patch within a 3D transformation tearing of the Touch Point sprites will occur when rotating on the Y axis. This kind of rotation is needed for a parallax effect.

Solution set the Phones Touch Point's sprites (shading, fill) Depth Testing to None.
