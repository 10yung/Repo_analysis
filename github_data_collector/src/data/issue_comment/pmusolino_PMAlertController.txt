I want to open another `alertVC` when you click a button, like a conformation type system. I implemented it like this
```swift
alertVC.addAction(PMAlertAction(title: "Delete", style: .default, action: { () in
   let conformation = PMAlertController(title: "Really delete this post?", description: nil, image: nil, style: .alert)
   conformation.addAction(PMAlertAction(title: "Yes", style: .default, action: { () in
      print("Capture action OK")
   }))
   TapticEngine.impact.feedback(.light)
   self.getTopMostViewController()?.present(conformation, animated: false, completion: nil)
}))
```
This does not work and doesn't show the controller. Any ideas how can I achieve this?
- add auto dismiss option to action
- update sample project for usage of auto dismiss option
Hi,

i’m using PMAlertController (installed via pod) within a objc app. After some issues with with pods, i’ve removed my pods-folder and reinstalled every pod. 

After re-installing i’ve got some build-errors in connection with textFields inside the alert controller. 

My (relevant) code:

```objc
PMAlertController *quittungDatenAlert = [[PMAlertController alloc] initWithTitle:@"Blahfasel Title“ description:@"Blahfasel-Description:“ image:nil style:PMAlertControllerStyleWalkthrough];

[quittungDatenAlert addTextField:^(UITextField *textField) {
	[textField setPlaceholder: @"Betrag erhalten von"];
	[textField setKeyboardType:UIKeyboardTypeDefault];
}];

PMAlertAction* alertSend = [[PMAlertAction alloc] initWithTitle:@"OK" style:PMAlertActionStyleDefault action:^{
	NSString *quittungsVon;
	quittungsVon = [[[quittungDatenAlert textFields] firstObject] text]
	
	(...)
}];

[quittungDatenAlert addAction:alertSend];

[self presentViewController:quittungDatenAlert animated:YES completion:nil];
```

Instead of  accessing the textfield, Xcode now created the following build error:
No visible @interface for 'PMAlertController' declares the selector ‚textFields'

How else could you access the text fields or where is the error?
Add initialisers to PMAlertController and PMAlertAction classes to allow customise the alert even more.
I want to add a custom function when PMAlertController dismiss , but the function / print() simply wont be fired in the viewDidDisappear function . 

Anyone has idea what 's going on ? 
Hi, I'm looking for a function to prevent the alert from auto dismissing but I'm unable to find it. May I make a suggestion that you should add one more "autoDismiss" parameter to the "addAction" function, so the user can now choose to let the library do the rest, or they can turn it off themselves. 
If there is any function with the same feature but I'm unable to find it, please show me and sorry if this issue bother you. Thank you in advance!

Hi,

I love this project however the disappearing animation does not suit my app. I need to change it to something like a fade out (or something else really). I could'n find any way to achieve this. Please help (Some example code would be appreciated)
You can now add UIPickerViews in the AlertViewController
Is subj possible?
If the alert text cannot fit on the screen the text cannot be scrolled - UIAlertController in contrast supports scrolling by default. What's worse is that the PMAlertController places the "cancel" action off the screen so a user cannot then cancel the alert. The App is effectively blocked from user interaction.

Being able to handle an alert that wont fit completely on screen is important. With devices with different configurations (e.g. screen sizes, portrait, landscape) and dynamic type sizes (i.e. through the settings App a user can increase the text size) its easy to imagine some alerts not fitting a screen.

Otherwise a great library thanks!
