i want application to auto launch for all users on the machine but for that i have open the application for first time from that user.
the problem is auto-launch is adding .plist file in the user's Library/LaunchAgents it should add the file to systems root so that it should auto launch for all users without opening it for the first time

I use electron, at first, i use node x64 to build our app, and it installed in default directory `c:/program file` in all uses' system, and it can auto launch. However, when i change node to x32, it installed in default directory `c:/program file(x86)`, and it cannot auto launch anymore, even i use `disable()` then `enable`.

If the path contains spaces, e.g. `/opt/IPFS Desktop/ipfs-desktop`, it needs to be quoted in the `Exec` line of the .desktop file. Otherwise the part before the space is interpreted to be the filename and the part after the space is interpreted to be a commandline argument.
FreeBSD can be treated in the same way as Linux for auto launch
applications.

- Target platforms this affects (Linux, Mac, Mac app store, and or Windows): 
FreeBSD

- What problem does this solve?
Support auto launching apps on FreeBSD.

- Could it break any existing functionality for users?
It should not break anyone.

"npm test" passed (with updated gulp and updated gulpfile.coffee, but these are not related to this change).
I have code in main.js in Electron:

```
    let autoLaunch = new AutoLaunch({
        name: 'MyApp',  
        path: process.platform === 'win32' ? app.getPath('exe') : '/Applications/MyApp.app',
    });
    
    autoLaunch.isEnabled().then((isEnabled) => {
        settingUser().then((res) => { 
            if (res.auto_start == 1) {
                if (isEnabled) autoLaunch.enable();
            }else{
                if (isEnabled) autoLaunch.disable();
            }
        });
    });
```

I have problem , because when I start Mac node-auto-launch run two window. First window with my application and second window with documencation Electron. How I can remove/disbale documencation Electron window ?
In Windows 10 documencation Electron window not run.
Hey, I'm using this project and it's working so far, so thanks!

I would like to see an Ethereum name or address added to the ethereum field of the package.json file. This will allow consumers of the project to know a cannonical address to send funds to. For example, I'm building an application that will allow developers to automatically donate ETH to all of their npm dependencies that have Ethereum addresses in their package.json files: https://sustainus.io

Since the Mojave version of macOS, Apple introduced some advanced security features which prevent auto-launch to execute its AppleScript.
The Exception "Not authorized to send Apple events to System Events" is thrown when calling `autoLaunch.enable()`.
Here is an example: https://recatch.io/s/UnDGITjNmLYV

Is there any workaround? I prefer to use the AppelScript method so my app appears in the Login Items menu, which is not the case with LaunchAgent.

Clone project:
`//create a directory of your choice, and copy template using curl
mkdir new-electron-webpack-project && cd new-electron-webpack-project
curl -fsSL https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack-quick-start/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components 1
//install dependencies
yarn`

Install module:
`yarn add auto-launch`

Add the following code to `./src/main/index.js`:
`import { autoLaunch } from 'auto-launch'
// Global Auto Launch references
var appAutoLaunch = new autoLaunch({
  name: 'Hello World App',
  isHidden: true
})`
I have integrated auto-launch in my Electron app. I would like not to open the main window of the app when the app is auto-launched at startup. Is there a way to determine if the app was launched by the user, or if it has been auto-launched at system startup?

In your code in the AutoLaunch function,
you call  this.fixOpts();
After this function, the name we pass will become another value.

In the fixOpts, I find author changes the this.opts.appName.
But I don't know why to do this.
If I comment out these code, then the name written in Registry will be what I pass.
