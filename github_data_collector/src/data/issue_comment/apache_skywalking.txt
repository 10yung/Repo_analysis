### New feature or improvement
- The current e2e test cases for profile use different storage to distinguish different projects. Now merge the test projects into one. Use `env` to distinguish different storage.

Based on #4266, we should add this kind of documents in here, https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/docs/en/protocols/query-protocol.md, as a section before Metadata.

Anyone wants to contribute this, PR is welcome.

As required [by the community](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/4200) and the discussion between @wu-sheng and I, we're considering to provide a plugin/module in Nginx(maybe written in Lua), to make it possible to begin a trace in Nginx, or create spans in Nginx, the plugin/module should behave similar (in some degree) to that  in Java agent, more details and progress will be synchronized here, hopefully

This is a big story to instrument the lambda expressions in JDK8+, lambda can be essentially a `Runnable`, `Callable`, `Function`, `Consumer` and many many others `FunctionalInterface`-annotated interfaces, but for now we're planning to support only a few of them:

- [ ] Threading-related, such as `Runnable`, `Callable`;

Now we can `tag` the span using the parameters of a method as stated [here](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/docs/en/setup/service-agent/java-agent/Application-toolkit-trace.md), but the evaluation only supports parameters for now, it would be great to support tagging with the returned object like this:

```java
@Trace
@Tag(key = "username", value = "returnedObj.username")
@Tag(key = "age", value = "returnedObj.age")
public User methodYouWantToTrace(String param1, String param2) {
    // ...
}
```
