TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating '_$$_REQUIRE(_dependencyMap[34], "react-native-tts").Tts') 
### Description:
We are supposed to highlight words and phrases seperated by [enter] click. But it may contain commas in the phrases. So the criteria to seperate words and phrases should be [enter] key (or new line)

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->

### Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to user preferences
2. Add some phrases containing commas

### Expected behavior:
Eg. `Hey, how are you` should highlight the full phrase
<!-- What you expect to happen -->

### Actual behavior:
`Hey` and `how are you` are highlighted seperately
<!-- What actually happens with SCREENSHOT, if applicable -->

### Additional context
I am working on it

Closes #5436 
The requests were being sent to the server instantaneously as the checkbox was clicked, for making the reset button I stored all the requests in an array and made calls to the server only if the save button was clicked, and reloaded the page if the reset was clicked.
I know many improvements can be done to this, it would be good if anyone can guide me on how to reload a page using reactiveVar, and not location.reload(). I have read the documentation but wan't able to implement it.

Another improvement would be to only send the requests to the server if that particular checkbox is clicked an odd number of times as even number of clicks would make the checkbox the same as it was at the start.


I tried to implement it using the array, wherein after every click I was checking if the element was already present and increased the count. Then when save was clicked I only sent those requests to the server whose count was odd. But in implementing this I was unable to increase the count as whenever I checked for an element's presence in the array it reported false and thus count could not be updated. 

Please help me and suggest changes to the pr.

Dear all,

Could you please explain how to view PDF files inside the chat without downloading them to PC?

In other words, I need to open the pdf files inside the browser instead of downloading the PDF file and open it from download folder.

When clicking on the title of the document, it starts downloading instead of showing the preview in the new tab, it tested by using Chrome browser in Mac OS, Windows OS and Chrome OS. 

My rocketchat server version is 2.3.1 
Operating System: ubuntu 18.04

Closes #15993

Added the varible #{userdn} to the LDAP_Sync_User_Data_Groups_Filter setting. Now it is possible to define group filters with users in different LDAP-OUs.
E.g. (&(cn=#{groupName})(uniqueMember=#{userdn})) instead of (&(cn=#{groupName})(uniqueMember=uid=#{username},ou=myou,dc=example,dc=com))
