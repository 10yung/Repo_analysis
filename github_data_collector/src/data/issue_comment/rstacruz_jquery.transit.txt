Is this project using continuous integration services (e.g., Travis-CI or Jenkings)? Or has it used at any point of its lifetime?
Simultaneous transitions on a single element don't seem to work if using multiple calls to `$.transit()`.
For example:
````
$w.transit( {opacity: 0.3, queue: false, duration:1500} );
$w.transit( {scale:   0.5, queue: false, duration:1200} );
````
Only `scale` is animated; `opacity` jumps immediately from its current value to 0.3.

Thus it seems impossible with `jquery.transit` to animate two different css properties of an object at the same time, if the transitions have different durations or delays (or if you have other reasons to want to separate the animations into distinct calls to `$.transit()`.
This PR adds support for *skew* transform, in no more than 10 lines of code.

The transforms *skewX* and *skewY* were already supported in current version. However, *skew* cannot be replaced with them (perhaps there is a way to make such replacement but seems hard to do so).

We may try the following snippets, which lead to different styles:

- `transform skew(45deg, 45deg)`
- `transform skewX(45deg) skewY(45deg)`
- `transform skewY(45deg) skewX(45deg)`

Hello,

Ive installed jquery.transit over npm and when calling the transition method on any element I get the following error:

```
> temp1.transition({x: 100})

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'speeds' of undefined
    at r.fn.init.$.fn.transition.$.fn.transit (jquery.transit.js:603)
    at <anonymous>:1:7
```

When adding the duration `temp1.transition({x: 100}, 300)` it works fine.
I've been using AnimeJS however it doesn't have a way of returning a value or applying a value without a delay. 

These are two I need for the current project I have. Transform properties are a nightmare unless using something like this. I can't find anything that replaces this, however bugs such as not being able to get scale() it always returns 1 regardless is meaning I can't use it. 

Is this dead? Can I fork it and start from where you left off? 
Hi,

When adding jquery.transit to a page using SyncFusion javascript chart, it breaks the animation of the chart.

Kind regards

Hi,
I am using Transit.js to move pages left to right and right to left. Firefox renders perfectly this effect but not chrome latest version. It delays the page then show as a blink effect. Please see the link below so you can understand what I mean by than.

Thanks in advance.

It appears that Firefox requires the 'filter' property to have a lower-case 'f'.
Chrome however requires an upper-case 'F'.

This commit adds a fallback case for Firefox that attmepts to use detect the 'filter' property if the initial check fails.

Simple implementation of stopTransition().

Only reason I'm making a pull request is so others can pull this into their own fork, since it seems to be a highly requested feature and there's no reason to write it twice. The author doesn't seem to maintain the repo any longer.

Hi, 
The Webpage demos are not working on an ipad.
