Hi,
I am trying to add tweaks in swift, so cant use macros. I am able to add text and switch type tweaks but not able to add action. 
Although in swift, there are more option with `SwiftTweaks`, I dont want to add another pod.
This is how I am trying, can somebody please tell what I am doing wrong?
```                   
let tweak = FBTweak(identifier: key)
tweak.name = key
tweak.defaultValue = {
                        debugPrint("hello value")            
  UIApplication.topViewController()?.navigationController?.pushViewController(AnalyticsLogTableViewController(), animated: true)
                    }
```
There are more within the pod, but these are especially annoying because, by being in public headers, they propagate to my project.

After upgrading iOS to Beta 11 (15A5328g), the `- (void)motionBegan:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event` method on `FBTweakShakeWindow` is never called.
Allow the shake to be disabled in the simulator too.

This is useful especially if you want to show the React Native Developer menu in the simulator with a shake gesture while also using Tweaks.

_shakeEnabled is already defaulted to YES.
`+load` takes 200ms or more on an iPhone 6. Although we only use it internally, it creates a discrepancy between our internal app and our production app. Could we move all that code out and execute it in the background soon after app startup?
I used 'FBTweakAction' macro to add items in the FBTweakViewController but now it's empty after using 'use_frameworks!' in Podfile to load other Swift libraries. I looked into this and I found that 'dladdr 'returns NULL in FBTweakIniline.m by some reason that I don't clearly understand. I know that I can fix this by avoiding using 'FBTweakAction' macro but I wonder if there's better way to fix it. Thanks in advance.
Hi, when address sanitizing is turned on, we get a crash at line 118 of FBTweakInline.m where it says `FBTweakCategory *category = [store tweakCategoryWithName:*entry->category];`. We're also looking at a memory corruption issue in our app that's present in debug, when tweaks is enabled, but not in production, when tweaks is disabled. Do you think Tweaks is causing some sort of memory corruption?
Current version of Tweaks displays warnings in your project when the pod is added. So we have got ahead and fix the warnings in the header files.

Also, since we were here, we thought it would be nice to fix the rest of the warnings in `FBTweak` and `FBTweakExample` projects. But happy to roll back these changes (see commits) if not a good idea.

0.4 is too long for trigger tweak view controller, 
with a vibrate to notify trigger is cool.
