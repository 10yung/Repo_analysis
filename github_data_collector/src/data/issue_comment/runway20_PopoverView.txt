A popoverview may be added to a hud view when displaying. Cause it is appended to the top window. The problem is in some case a singleton hud view could always be interacted by a popoverview.

Update @neocorp work.

when I press button a little quick, e.g. double click……
then the popover may overlay and can not dismiss. 

after all, I use some flag to avoid this happen.
-(void)structTypeBtnClick:(UIButton*)sender{
    _typeBtn = sender;
    if (_typeBtn.selected) {
        return;
    }

```
[PopoverView showPopoverAtPoint:CGPointMake(530, 960) inView:self.view withContentView:_switchControl delegate:self];
_typeBtn.selected=YES;
```

}

but, There must be a better way to resolve this  issue.


Deprecated sizeWithFont: methods updated for iOS SDK 7.0 and above

Don't support scroll when there're many items.


The popover view's round corner is gone when using `- (PopoverView *)showPopoverAtPoint:inView:withContentView:delegate:` and the contentView has`backgroundColor` other than `[UIColor clearColor]`.

I tried to update CocoaPods myself, but they want the push to come from the original repo.

The PopoverView.podspec file in runway20/PopoverView looks like it has been updated, but it refers to a different repo (cocoa-factory/PopoverView) and a tag ("0.0.2") that only exists on that other repo.

Some instrux here: https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/wiki/Contributing-to-the-master-repo#sharing-podspecs

And discussion on my push attempt here: https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/pull/3672

Thank you!
