Hi,

Just like pointed out by other developers in these 2 issues, Google search isn't working for me either:
https://github.com/ElevenPaths/FOCA/issues/13
https://github.com/ElevenPaths/FOCA/issues/16

Please see the screenshot:

(shows errors, finds nothing although there ARE files on this domain)

As I assume it could be related to Google blocking automated requests somehow.

How do I make it work? There is no documentation anywhere.

Should I set a Google API key in Options -> General Info? Which key? Where do I get it? Should I go to https://console.developers.google.com, choose "Custom search API" and generate a key? I did that but nothing changed.

In https://github.com/ElevenPaths/FOCA/issues/16, @jsperk suggested looking at https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/cse/list. What exactly should I look at? There is no answer to the issue there.

Same goes for this link https://github.com/jsperk/GoogleApiSearch â€” what exactly should I look at? Should I use the ApiKey `AIzaSyDh9ps5jddxvrJLf_-_sU37bIPN0FWPB3w` from https://github.com/jsperk/GoogleApiSearch/blob/master/GoogleApiSearch/Program.cs? It doesn't work either.

Can you please clarify how to make Google Search work in FOCA? Thank you.
Currently the build is run under my profile in AppVeyor. Before merging, please change this to the official FOCA profile on AppVeyor.
