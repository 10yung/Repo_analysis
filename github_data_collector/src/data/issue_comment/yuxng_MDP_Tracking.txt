When I ran MOT_test.m, there was only one tracking trajectory was visualised. But the paper shows there should be multiple tracking trajectories. How to show them all in the image?

When I running on my own dataset(1000~2000 images, MOT format), the function read_dres_image will use all memory(8G + 2G swap memory), and then my system Linux will make MATLAB crush. Is there anything wrong on my environment? I use MATLAB 2018b + ubuntu 16.04
When I run test.m, there is no visual interface.
when running MOT_cross_validation.m, I had one problem.
This error is:
Index exceeds matrix dimensions.

Error in CLEAR_MOT_HUN (line 45)
[~, ~, ic] = unique(gtMat(:,2));

Error in evaluateTracking (line 147)
[mets, mInf]=CLEAR_MOT_HUN(gtInfoSingle(seqCnt).gtInfo,stI);

Error in MDP_test (line 179)
metrics = evaluateTracking({seq_name}, opt.results, benchmark_dir);

Error in MOT_cross_validation (line 57)
MDP_test(idx_test{j}, seq_set_test, tracker);

Please help me. Thank you very much!

Hi,

How can I train MDP on my own data and then visualize the test results?
Also, from where can I see the processing speed of Frames per second? As per my understanding, it uses detections for every frame. I want to provide it detections for one frame then let it track those detections for the next _X_ frames and so on.

Thanks 
simple to use the maximum score to 1 , the minimum to 0 or else?
I use matlab 2016b and compile is ok, but when I run MOT_cross_validation.m, warp.mexw64 invalid happend, how can I solve this problem?
convertTXTToStruct (line 53)
        missingFrames = size(stInfo.W,1)+1:range(end);
wrong usage : 
For a colon operator with a character operand, the first operand and the last operand must be characters.
Do anyone know how to solve? Please help me
