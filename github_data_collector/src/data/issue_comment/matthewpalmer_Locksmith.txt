Hi,

I have updated your version for swift 5.0. There are no changes in source code.
Maybe you want to take the changes.

Kind regards,
Ahmet

* Bumped minimum deployment target for OSX to 10.11 since `NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: data)` is only #available on iOS 10.11 or higher.
* Updated .travis.yml file for Xcode 10.2
* Fixes https://github.com/matthewpalmer/Locksmith/issues/207

All tests passed without issues
This is for the issue https://github.com/matthewpalmer/Locksmith/issues/205
Hi Team,

**_I am having a trouble loading the keychain data. App crash when loadDataForUserAccount is called. Mac OS 10.14.4 and Xcode 10.2 Swift 4_**

I updated my Mac os to 10.14.4 and updated my Xcode to 10.2 & project swift version 4 to convert 5. After that when first time Xcode Run project login successfully after second time Xcode project Run app crash I tried to error "expression produced error: error: /var/folders/s1/: error: no type named 'ReadRequest' in module 
Swift._DebuggerSupport.stringForPrintObject(Swift.UnsafePointer<project.ReadRequest>(bitPattern: 0x13e1e2890)!.pointee)".

Let me know if I'm doing anything wrong from my side. Is there any particular reason for that?

Error Function :- 

public static func loadDataForUserAccount(userAccount: String, inService service: String = LocksmithDefaultService) -> [String: Any]? {
        struct ReadRequest: GenericPasswordSecureStorable, ReadableSecureStorable {
            let service: String
            let account: String
        }
        
        let request = ReadRequest(service: service, account: userAccount)
        **return request.readFromSecureStore()?.data**
    }

Error Message :- 

expression produced error: error: /var/folders/s1/: error: no type named 'ReadRequest' in module ''
Swift._DebuggerSupport.stringForPrintObject(Swift.UnsafePointer<projectName.ReadRequest>(bitPattern: 0x13e1e2890)!.pointee)

…ode 10.2 and the Swift 5 compiler.
Are you planning to update codebase?
Happy to repost this over on S.O if not appropriate for this repo but thought someone here might just know the answer.

We use Locksmith to save users login credentials:

```
  try Locksmith.saveData(data: ["XXX": creds.password, "XXX": creds.email], forUserAccount: self.userAccountKey)
```

And every time we do an update to our app and redeploy users are re-prompted to give keychain permissions on High Sierra.  Never seems to be an issue on Mojave though.

Kind of at a loss for what to even google to try and resolve this :(  If anyone has some thoughts it would be much appreciated
Hi,
I upadated my Mac os to 10.13.6 and updated my Xcode to 10.1. After that when I tried to build Xcode gave error "Module Locksmith compiled with swift 4.0.3 can not be imported by swift 4.2 compiler".
So I tried to fetch and build latest Locksmith version using "Carthage update" but I got 
"The file “Locksmith.framework” couldn’t be opened because there is no such file." UserInfo={NSFilePath=/Users/xxxxxxxx/Library/Caches/org.carthage.CarthageKit/DerivedData/Locksmith/4.0.0/Build/Products/Release-appletvos/Locksmith.framework, NSUnderlyingError=0x7f8bcf2ce610 {Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=2 "No such file or directory"}}

Let me know if I'm doing anything wrong from my side.
