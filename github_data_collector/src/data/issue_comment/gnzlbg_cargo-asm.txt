Bumps [structopt](https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt) from 0.3.3 to 0.3.7.

<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">structopt's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>v0.3.7 (2019-12-28)</h1>
<p>Nothing's new. Just re-release of <code>v0.3.6</code> due to
<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues/315#issuecomment-568502792">the mess with versioning</a>.</p>
<p>You may notice that <code>structopt-derive</code> was bumped to <code>v0.4.0</code>, that's OK, it's not a breaking change.
<code>structopt</code> will pull the right version in on its on.</p>
<h1>v0.3.6 (2019-12-22) - YANKED</h1>
<p>This is unusually big patch release. It contains a number of bugfixes and
new features, some of them may theoretically be considered breaking. We did our best
to avoid any problems on user's side but, if it wasn't good enough, please
<a href="https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues">file an issue ASAP</a>.</p>
<h2>Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>structopt</code> used to treat <code>::path::to::type::Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> as <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>
special type. <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TeXitoi/structopt/pull/287">This was considered erroneous</a>.
(same for <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>bool</code>). Now only exact <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> match is a special type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>#[structopt(version = expr)]</code> where <code>expr</code> is not a string literal used to get
overridden by auto generated <code>.version()</code> call,
<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues/283">incorrectly</a>. Now it doesn't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed bug with top-level <code>App::*</code> calls on multiple <code>struct</code>s, see
<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues/265">#289</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positional <code>bool</code> args with no explicit <code>#[structopt(parse(...))]</code> annotation are
now prohibited. This couldn't work well anyway, see
<a href="https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt/blob/master/examples/true_or_false.rs">this example</a>
for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we've instituted strict priority between doc comments, about, help, and the like.
See <a href="https://docs.rs/structopt/0.3/structopt/#help-messages">the documentation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>HUGE THANKS to <a href="https://github.com/ssokolow"><code>@ssokolow</code></a></strong> for tidying up our documentation,
teaching me English and explaining why our doc used to suck. I promise I'll make the rest
of the doc up to your standards... sometime later!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>New features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implement <code>StructOpt</code> for <code>Box&lt;impl StructOpt&gt;</code> so from now on you can use <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>
with <code>flatten</code> and <code>subcommand</code> (<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues/304">#304</a>).</p>
<pre lang="rust"><code>enum Command {
    #[structopt(name = &quot;version&quot;)]
    PrintVersion,
<p></code></pre></p>

Does as it says on the can.

The awkward `if` statement is because on Apple the non-mangled functions are only `_`, even though mangled are `__`, so it would always fail otherwise.

Would be nice to automatically paginate  if the content spans more than N lines.

We might copy bat logic for this.
Being able to see and compare generated asm and LLVM IR is super useful. It would great to be able to have another command to show the generated .wat or .wast (i.e. WebAssembly in text format) output so that it could be directly compared against the assembly and LLVM IR.

Thanks for a great package!
