Closes #731 

I noticed with that problem that I can't install this repo for development on Mac OS 10.5 Catalina due to old `node-sass` which doesn't support this env.

Looks like to run it successfully there should be version `^4.9.3` or newer. I use `^4.12.0` in my project
When I started my work on some fixes I noticed that current repo has some trailing whitespaces. For example, here I just decided to remove unused `let result` but together with this changed I did changes in trailing spaces.

Also, it has some inconsistencies inside code like different space positions after `:` sign.
- space after `:` here https://github.com/searchkit/searchkit/blob/staging/packages/searchkit/src/__test__/core/react/SearchkitComponentSpec.tsx#L52
- no spaces here https://github.com/searchkit/searchkit/blob/staging/packages/searchkit/src/__test__/core/react/SearchkitComponentSpec.tsx#L113

You even have tabs inside the codebase

We can resolve such kind of problems by adding linter. There is one of the ways how to add it to TS project https://www.robertcooper.me/using-eslint-and-prettier-in-a-typescript-project

@joemcelroy are you interested in adding linter to the project. If yes, I'll try to prepare PR with it.

Hello,
I'm using SearchKit on an ES cluster 7.0, and I have encountered several problems: HitsStats, Pagination...
I'm having a problem with the SearchBox component. The search don't work. When I use the SearchBox, I get an error 400.

Has anyone ever used SearchBox with ES 7.0? If yes can you give me an example of configuration?

Here is my SearchBox config 
`          <SearchBox
            searchOnChange={false}
            queryOptions={{analyzer:"fuzziness"}}        
	    queryFields={["title","field_related_make_name"]}
	    prefixQueryFields={["title","field_related_make_name"]}
	    />`

Thanks for your help.
Basic searchkit seems to be a simple keyword search out of the box.

I like the kibana syntax eg "apples AND oranges AND NOT grapes", a more complex search capability.

I tried changing the analyzer, but that didn't seem to do much. Also tired queryBuilder={"QueryString"} and the entire thing became unresponsive.

Any idea how to duplicate the kibana (lucene) style syntax with searchkit?

Here is my searchbox, default:

```
<SearchBox autofocus={true}

searchOnChange={true}

prefixQueryFields={prefixqueryfelds}

queryOptions={{analyzer:"standard"}}

/>
```
ps. I tried the "chat" from your website and no one ever responds.  Also searched everything I could find with no luck on getting this to work.

Appreciate any tips or pointers.  

I can't figure out an easy way to use Material UI. I would prefer to create my own view components.

We could refactor the view internals to use react-hooks. That would decouple view logic from render logic. The developer could then choose to use create their own view components using whatever library they wish. 
I have a Google Maps object being passed in data from Hits.  Each time the results are 0 or not found, that component is destroyed, and once results are found, is rerendered using another API key.

An optional field to pass into hits to tell it to render 0 hits would be great!  I understand you have HitsSuggestion if Hits is empty, but I think my use case happens a lot.
From docs: "Range component containing only min/max input fields. Requires pressing "Go" to update the filter."

Why do all other inputs get searchOnChange?  Including most Range Components!
