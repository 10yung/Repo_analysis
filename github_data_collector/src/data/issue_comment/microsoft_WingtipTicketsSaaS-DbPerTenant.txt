Is it possible to have tenant databases in sequential numbers like tenantdb0000001 and incrementing and have the tenant names mapped to it so that we can provision databses in advance and assign them to new tenant as they signup/
while visiting the tenant i m getting the https://events-wingtip-dpt-cr4.eastus2.....
Why i m getting cr4 in the location since my location is only eastus2.
when i m removing that cr4 portion then the url is working.
And how can i remove "cr4"
Does not build. After i download and restore I get below error every time i try to build :(

Error	CS0017	Program has more than one entry point defined. Compile with /main to specify the type that contains the entry point.	Events-TenantUserApp	D:\VSRubbishProjects\WingtipTicketsSaaS-DbPerTenant-master\App\src\Events-TenantUserApp\Program.cs

I am using the most up to date vs 2017 as of this post





It is mentioned in this stackoverflow article that data dependancy routing is an overkill when it comes to single tenant sharding pattern. Can someone please explain on this?
