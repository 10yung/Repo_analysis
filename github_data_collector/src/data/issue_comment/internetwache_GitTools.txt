Some urls cause the finder to throw an exception which causes the script to fail, can we can an argument to silently throw the error, but keep running?

`Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "./gitfinder.py", line 84, in <module>
   main()
 File "./gitfinder.py", line 80, in main
   pool.map(fun, domains)
 File "/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/multiprocessing/pool.py", line 268, in map
   return self._map_async(func, iterable, mapstar, chunksize).get()

   raise self._value

As discussed in #8, the argument parsing should be rewritten, so that positional and non-positional arguments can be reliably parsed. See [0] for ideas.
