Cant see the console log color with fresh command
sometimes I switch database connection between different environment,but it won't rebuild.
I'm wanting to use delve and fresh on a docker container to build and debug my project even when i alter some file. Anyone know how to do it?
# Fresh does not support go mod vendor?

I start a project with go mod. When I build and run my project, I can use `go build -mod=vendor cmd/main.go` and `go run -mod=vendor cmd/main.go`.

But I can not use fresh, because the source of build step in fresh is `cmd := exec.Command("go", "build", "-o", buildPath(), root())`.

Am I right? How can I use fresh in my project.

My project folder is :
├── cmd
│   └── main.go
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── internal
├── runner.conf
└── vendor

when i try to run the code below, i could not parse flags given
```sh
    fresh go run main.go -env debug
```

thank you
Fixes #93.
I've been using fresh for several years and it's worked perfectly (thank you)!  However, I recently encouraged co-workers to use it and their fresh installs leave the runner-build process running when fresh exits (when they kill fresh using control-c). Any ideas what's going wrong? One co-worker is running on mac and another on ubuntu. The runner.conf contains just ignored: vendor
I think there are too much debug info from fresh, it couldn't be ignore and added prefix strings to my output. It makes debug more harder.
There should be an option to mute fresh.
When encoding values, an error occurs. The value "@" is not encoded and just comes back with (MISSING). This was tested apart from **fresh** and it works correctly with **go run**
```
func test() {
	v := url.Values{}
	v.Set("email", "test@test.com")
	log.Println(v.Encode())
}
```

Response using fresh:
`email=test%!t(MISSING)est.com`

Intended Response:
`email=test%40test.com`
added support flags for the application to be launched
