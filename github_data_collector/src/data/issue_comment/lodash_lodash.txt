intersperse is a function with two parameters, an array and a separator that would be inserted between the elements. [ramda version](https://ramdajs.com/docs/#intersperse)
I think that it's a very useful function, I needed this in my work and I thought I would found it in Lodash. I didn't, but I saw that I'm not the only one who thinks like that. I found a very popular issue about this function.

This PR add support to ArrayBuffer and SharedArrayBuffer instances and avoid unexpected behaviour to isEmpty and size methods.

Added new test cases

This PR was create based on issue #4570 
It flattens the paths and uses `hasPathIn` to support nested / deep paths. This fixes all tests

As a side note, i suggest to not support nested path in `pick` making it smaller. This feature still could be achieved with `pickBy`
Add tests for newly added `hasPath` and `hasPathIn`

Removes tests for deep path for `has` and `hasIn`
Removes sparseString variable since this line `delete sparseString[0];` fails in modern node

Two tests for has / hasIn still fails:

should return `true` for indexes of sparse values
should coerce `path` to a string

Seems that those features were removed purposedly
Should i remove those tests?
HTML entities may have [leading zeros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encodings_in_HTML), so in this case `#39` `#039` both refer to the same character `'`

We noticed this while fixing this issue https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/19187

I ran into trouble building and running tests locally, so I'm happy to follow up if there are more detailed instructions elsewhere for running this locally.

### Testing Instructions

- Verify that tests still pass
- No other regressions
Seems IsEqual function was removed accidentally

Those functions are not present in current code base and does not make sense at all in a modularized package
Adjust tests accordingly so it can run
Enable tests that check for the correct behavior
