Howdy. Trying to install on Mac. 

Got past wget issues by using 
`"curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/merqurio/jupyter_themes/master/theme_selector.js" instead.`

However, the last step in command line instructions gives an error...

```
Enabling notebook extension jupyter_themes/theme_selector...
      - Validating: problems found:
        - require?  X jupyter_themes/theme_selector
```

Any suggestions as to what to try next? Thanks
Hi, thanks for writing this script. I've downloaded the .js file and enabled it, but nothing has changed in Jupyter. (I'm using the [jupyter_nbextensions_configurator](https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator).)

![jupyter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32851535/32418642-ca77c958-c23b-11e7-86bd-cf3df7838c97.png)

There are two theme selectors (theme_selector.js and jupyter_themes/theme_selector.js) and both say that there is no YAML file that tells Jupyter how to configure it. I've closed and reopened Jupyter multiple times, and tried just theme_selector.js, just jupyter_themes/theme_selector.js, etc. and no change. Any advice would be really appreciated. I'm using Windows 10, if that matters.

Thanks!
