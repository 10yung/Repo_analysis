Quick POC for [SPEC-1296](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SPEC-1296). Will link this PR to a Ruby ticket once one exists.

This is a first attempt at adding auto encryption to insert_one and find. This is a result of me digging around the command pipeline and trying to figure out where best to put the encryption decryption.

I'd love some feedback/guidance. Mainly, I'm wondering -- is there a more central location where I can get the command for any operation in the correct format? Why doesn't insert have a builder like find does? Should it?
