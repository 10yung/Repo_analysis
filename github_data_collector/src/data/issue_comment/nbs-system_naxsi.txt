We have a Docker container with a webproxy with nginx and naxsi.

In order to compile naxsi we need to download the .sig file. It was okey till some months ago that stopped working.

We download the .sig file with:

```docker
    curl \
        -fSL \
        https://github.com/nbs-system/naxsi/releases/download/$NAXSI_TAG/naxsi-$NAXSI_VERSION.tar.gz.sig \
        -o naxsi.tar.gz.sig \
    ; \
```

Where 
```docker
ENV NAXSI_VERSION=0.56 \
    NAXSI_TAG=untagged-afabfc163946baa8036f \
    NGINX_VERSION=1.17.0
```

That download url stopped working for some reason.

Thanks for your help.
Added global whitelist in /etc/nginx/whitelist.txt (one IP per line), meaning these IPs will never be blocked and JSON output of logged events/blocks

Can you check my code edits (beginner to NGINX and NGINX modules).

If this or similar feature could be merged or added to NAXSI, it would be great.
Hi Team,

I am using in my project currently modsecurity to filter out bad IPs and allow good ones:

Something like this:

```
   modsecurity_rules '
      SecRuleEngine On
      SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@ipMatchFromFile /etc/modsecurity/whitelist.txt" id:1,phase:1,allow
      SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@ipMatchFromFile /etc/modsecurity/blacklist.txt" id:2,phase:1,deny,status:429,msg:\'blacklist\'
```

What would be the best approach to add this functionality to NAXSI?

Should I add a Rule or modify the code? Can you give some tips on either one, both or none, when this is not possible (are there any performance implications or implications in general)

Any other possibility to achieve this goal in NGINX setup?

Thanks,




#### BasicRule
```shell
BasicRule wl:0 "mz:$BODY_VAR:channelid";
```
> Set the post name equal to channelid, pass all the rules but it has no effect, it is still blocked

#### BasicRule
```shell
BasicRule wl:0 "mz:$URL_X:(^.*?article_edit.*$)|URL";
```
> Similarly, I match a certain URL and then pass all the rules. Does not take effect



> What is the correct rule?




nxapi codes are modified for python3 support.
This seems to solve issue #457  
my environment is centos 7 + openresty + naxsi,
it's a simple page that accept some post html and parse it to get some useful informations
but i found that some requests run success and some blocked




I need to write a rule that will whitelist anything under a json node. So for example I want to send the following in an HTTP request body and whitelist a rule for `metadata` that will apply to any child node:
```
{
  "metadata": {
    "foo": "I'm hungry",
    "foo2": "I'm hungry"
  }
}
```
where anything under `metadata` (so `foo` and `foo2`) are user defined.
Is it possible to do this? I can't find anything in the documentation.

My current rule is `BasicRule wl:1013 "mz:$URL_X:^/v1/payments/?$|$BODY_VAR_X:metadata"` which doesn't work.
Hi all,

I want to whitelist following ban. Then I have created following whitelist rule for core rule id 1000. But nginx reload failed. 

> BasicRule wl:1000 "mz:$URL_VAR:content";;

This is the error log.

`2019/04/18 22:35:08 [error] 44389#44389: *1006 NAXSI_EXLOG: ip=157.55.39.89&server=www.domain.com&uri=%2F2012%2F09%2Fofficial-update-roll.html&id=1000&zone=URL&var_name=&content=%2F2012%2F09%2Fofficial-update-roll.html, client: 157.55.39.89, server: domain.com, request: "GET /2012/09/official-update-roll.html HTTP/1.1", host: "www.domain.com"
`


When I test the nginx with about whitelist rule it gives following error.

`nginx: [emerg] Naxsi-Config : Incorrect line BasicRule wl:1000 (../naxsi-master/naxsi_src//naxsi_skeleton.c/474)... in /etc/nginx/naxsi/naxsi-whitelist.rules:3
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test failed
`
egï¼š"BasicRule wl:1013;" which is present at location level can work nomal. But "MainRule wl:1013;"  which is present at http level cannot work. Why?
