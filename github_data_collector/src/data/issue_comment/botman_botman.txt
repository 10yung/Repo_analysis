Hi guys, 

i have this problem with conversations... Variable $this->firstname (in method askFirstname() ) is 
 always empty and i dont know why...

is my code correct? I am trying basic conversation, where chatbot (Messenger bot) only ask for firstname... When I fill first name then conversation is stopping... chatbot returns nothing :-(

### index.php

```
require_once "vendor/autoload.php"; //load botman classes
require_once "class/onboardingConversation.php"; //load custom conversation class

use BotMan\BotMan\BotMan;
use BotMan\BotMan\BotManFactory;
use BotMan\BotMan\Drivers\DriverManager;
use BotMan\Drivers\Facebook\FacebookDriver;
use LiborMatejka\Conversations\OnboardingConversation;

$config = [
	// Your driver-specific configuration
	'facebook' => [
		'token' => 'my_custom_token',
		'app_secret' => 'my_app_secret',
		'verification' => 'abc_123',
	],
	'botman' => [
		'conversation_cache_time' => 0,
	],
];

// Load the driver(s) you want to use
DriverManager::loadDriver(\BotMan\Drivers\Facebook\FacebookDriver::class);

// Create an instance
$botman = BotManFactory::create($config);

$botman->hears('ahoj|hi|hello|cau|cus|zdar|zdarec|cago', function (BotMan $bot) {
	$bot->startConversation(new OnboardingConversation);
});

// Start listening
$botman->listen();
```

### Conversation class

```
namespace LiborMatejka\Conversations;

use BotMan\BotMan\Messages\Conversations\Conversation;
use BotMan\BotMan\Messages\Incoming\Answer;

class OnboardingConversation extends Conversation {

	protected $firstname;
	protected $email;

	  function askFirstname() {

		$this->ask('Hello! What is your firstname?', function (Answer $answer) {

			// Save result
			$this->firstname = $answer->getText();

			$this->say('Nice to meet you ' . $this->firstname);

			$this->askEmail();

		});

	}

	public function askEmail() 
		$this->ask('One more thing - what is your email?', function (Answer $answer) {
			// Save result
			$this->email = $answer->getText();

			$this->say('Great - that is all we need, ' . $this->firstname);
		});

		//$this->bot->typesAndWaits(2);
	}

	public function run() {

		// This will be called immediately

		$this->askFirstname();

	}

}
```


Hello,

It's not possible with the current version to use a callable instantiated service as a callback. This PR solves this.
- BotMan Version: 2.5
- PHP Version:7.2
- Messaging Service(s): 'driver' => 'web'
- Cache Driver:

### Description:
I use a BotMan web driver ('driver' => 'web'). Unfortunately I can't redirect to another web page with the (Button :: create) buttons. 
As I can see it is possible using Facebook drivers:
ButtonTemplate :: create ('Open Webview')
        -> addButton (ElementButton :: create ('Click here')
             -> url (https://myurl.com/webview ')
             -> enableExtensions ()
        );

Is possible to achieve same kind of redirection with web-drivers?
Looking forward for your kind help and reply.


### Steps To Reproduce:
- BotMan Version: 2.5.0
- PHP Version: 7.3
- Messaging Service(s): Web
- Cache Driver: Redis

### Description:

In namespace `BotMan\BotMan\Storages\Drivers`, `FileStorage` and `RedisStorage` both implements `StorageInterface`, but the method `save()` acting differently.

It's absolutely not intuitive, and a real "brain-teaser" to check what append when moving from one storage to another :/

FileStorage method save() fetch data and do a merge before saving :
```php
    public function save(array $data, $key)
    {
        $file = $this->getFilename($key);

        $saved = $this->get($key)->merge($data);

        if (! is_dir(dirname($file))) {
            mkdir(dirname($file), 0777, true);
        }
        file_put_contents($file, json_encode($saved->all()));
    }
```

But, RedisStorage erase existing data on saving :
```php
    public function save(array $data, $key)
    {
        $this->redis->set($this->decorateKey($key), $data);
    }
```


### Steps To Reproduce:

Instantiate Botman with FileStorage, save ['key1' => 'data1'] then ['key2' => 'data2'], check that storage contains both keys.
Then change storage with RedisStorage, do the same, and check that storage contains only last saved key.

Hello,

I have taken a server with ubuntu 18.04. I use Apache2
I installed Botman and configured laravel.
I have a domain name in HTTPS set up with certbot.
When I execute the command "php artisan serve", I can access the main Botman page. 
However, when I want to access /botman/tinker or access the webhooks for Facebook, I get a 404 error.

I have configured ngrok which allows it to access /botman/tinker....

How do I configure my project to access the tinker and webhooks?

Thank you in advance for your help

### Description:

I am using the Dompdf library to create a pdf with botman studio and save it in a folder on my PC.


### Steps To Reproduce:

The problem is that when I do this from telegram I don't save the pdf, apparently it doesn't recognize the "save" function of dompdf...

This is my code, I'm running it in a conversation class:


	public function upload() {
 
        $price= $this->price;
        $date = date('Y-m-d'); 

        $view =  \View::make('pdf.file', compact( 'date', 'price'))->render();
        $this->pdf = \App::make('dompdf.wrapper');
        $this->pdf->loadHTML($view); 
        return $this->pdf->save("C:/Telegram/ass/resources/views/file.pdf"); 

  
	}

To prevent error messages from PHPStan like:

```
Method                                                                  
         MyProject\Domain\Bot::getChatUsername()   
         never returns null so it can be removed from the return typehint.
```

when using code like this:
```php
class Bot{

    /** @var BotManApiClient */
    private $botMan;

    public function getChatUsername() : ?string
    {
        return $this->botMan->getUser()->getUserName();
    }
}
```

```
    $botman = $this->botman;
    
    $botman->hears('stop', function(BotMan $bot) {})->skipsConversation();
    
    $botman->receivesImages(function(BotMan $bot, $images) {
        foreach ($images as $image) {
            $url = $image->getUrl();
            $this->interpret($bot, $url, 'IMAGE');
        }
    });
    
   $botman->hears('{something}', function (BotMan $bot, $something) {
            $this->interpret($bot, $something, 'TEXT');
    });

    $botman->listen();
```

In the `interpret()` method I have a `$bot->reply("I have a " . $messageType)`;  where the `$messageType` is the third param of `interpret()`
My problem is, that when I send a text from Telegram it replies me back the "I have a TEXT", but when I send an image I got a HTTP Status 200 in ngrok and next to it nothing happens.
What am I missing?

### Description:
I want to send a question from controller not from the conversation that question belongs to. The flow is: after an action user is left waiting in the conversation. After API hits the bot's server - the bot needs to send to user a question. But I can't get the Conversation object to call the question in my controller class.

Hello,

In order to understand a date and time in a response, I created an intent and a recognition of the date and time.
It works perfectly, however, I have a problem with the schedules before 12 hours a day.
For example:
---
NLU entry: 23h
NLU output: 11pm
---
NLU entry: 9h
NLU output: 7pm
---
NLU input: 4h addition of AM
NLU output: 4am
(okay)
---

My timezone for Dialogflow is GMT+1 and language (French (European) - fr-FR).

How do I tell DialogFlow that I want 24-hour time recognition and not AM/PM?
