Xcode 10.2 was released today, which made Swift 5 the latest version, and dropped support for Swift 3. However, this project's Swift version is still set to Swift 3, so this project can't be compiled with Xcode 10.2 or be used with Swift 5 targets
Alamofire-SwiftyJSON depends on SwiftyJSON 4.0.0 so I am unable to move to SwiftyJSON 4.2.0 in my development pod.

Can you update the podspec of Alamofire-SwiftyJSON to refrence SwiftyJSON 4.2.0?

Thanks.

SwiftyJSON and Alamofire both support Swift Package Manager.
So it's useful if this repo support SPM. 
Adds ability to add Alamofire-SwiftyJSON to watchOS
