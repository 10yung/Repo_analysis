貌似主分支2个月没动静了。
I had imported, I believe (cant quite remember now since I removed it) the WebGL package which installed this as a dependancy.  Then I built my project for tvOS.  When I tried to compile the XCode project it failed. 

大佬们好=。=，我在我的项目工程里使用UIWidgets出现了这个现象，于是我使用Unity2019.3.0f1构建了一个最简单的UIWidgets项目，目标平台是windows x64。配置里面使用Mono发布没有问题，换成IL2CPP之后程序运行正常，但是会不停的产生如下的警告日志。我还试了调整VSync的设置也没起作用，我担心运行时间长了日志文件会很大，请问有办法去掉它吗。

可以跟随系统语言 并可在app内切换语言
1.能应用到游戏里的某个功能吗？
2.如果可以应用到游戏里的话，那涉及到热更的话，能用lua进行热更吗 

你好，我发现一个基于DOTS的UI解决方案 [https://github.com/supron54321/DotsUI](url)

UIWidgets是否可以基于DOTS实现来提高性能

尝试使用centerSlice将原图为310×90的图片显示为540×90时，使用如下代码时报错。
`public class BottomPanel : StatelessWidget
    {
        public override Widget build(BuildContext context)
        {
            return Unity.UIWidgets.widgets.Image.file(UnityEngine.Application.dataPath + "/AddressableAssets/UISprite/bottom-btn-bg.png",
                width: 540,
                height: 90,
                fit: BoxFit.fill,
                centerSlice: Rect.fromLTRB(150f, 40f, 150f, 40f));            
        }
    }`
运行结果为不显示任何图片。
