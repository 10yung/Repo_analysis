**Summary**

Run yarn on the current master will produce an untracked file `website/static/css/Draft.css`. It's a remainder from the migration to Docusaurus 2 and should be deleted.

This will fix https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/2304

**Test Plan**

I ran `cd website && yarn && yarn start` and the doc website works fine locally.

**What is the current behavior?**
I don't know if it's possible to render .docx files somehow in draft-js


**What is the expected behavior?**
Is there any way so that I can use docx files for rendering? Or anything that can be used to convert the docx files to draft-js state, which can then be used for rendering?

**Summary**

https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/pull/468 introduced a change that locked `immutable-js` to `~3.7.4`. Reading the PR, you can see that this change was supposed to be a band-aid PR while https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/pull/881 was getting merged (see https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/pull/468#issuecomment-227177595).
The PR eventually got merged and included on the latest `immutable-js` release, but the problem is that when installing the latest release of `immutable-js` (3.8.2), there are still multiple type errors across the codebase and, most importantly, it seems like [updating the immutable-js version on Facebook itself is hard to accomplish](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/950#issuecomment-464243211), so this update is being avoided as much as possible.
There has been a lot of discussion about this update: https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/950

Locking `immutable-js` to that version is an issue if your project uses draft-js and `immutable-js` `3.8.x`, or if you depend on another package that depends on `3.8.x`. In this case, you'll end up bundling both versions of `immutable-js` on your application, which is not ideal.

Note that the problems that `3.8.2` introduces are only related to `Flow` types and not actual issues and there are no breaking changes (GoDaddy has been using draft-js in production for more than a year now without issues related to the version difference). Other [ppl](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/950#issuecomment-409891752) are [confirming](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/950#issuecomment-428211838) this as well.

This PR tries to achieve a middle ground, where `immutable-js` stays at 3.7.x, while opening the semver range to allow `draft-js` to be used with other versions bigger than 3.7.x and smaller than 4.0.0.

**Test Plan**

Running `yarn` on with this change applied doesn't change the `yarn.lock` file
**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**
Probably *feature* (improvement)

**What is the current behavior?**
Run `yarn` on the current master will produce this untracked file `website/static/css/`.

**What is the expected behavior?**
`website/static/css/` should be either ignored or commited.

**Which versions of Draft.js, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of Draft.js?**

**What is the current behavior?**
The custom code style contains border and is set by customStyleMap. If add other inline styles such as bold or italic, the code span will be split into several new spans which causes duplicated borders between every two new spans.

code style:
```
      customStyleMap: {
        CODE: {
          fontFamily: "monospace",
          color: '#E91E63',
          backgroundColor: 'rgba(244,245,246,1)',
          border: '1px solid rgba(220,224,231,1)',
          borderRadius: 2,
        }
      }
```

I want to implement a feature that user can input unstyled block between ordered list items. In order to reset the counter, I need to add `counter-reset` style to ol. But with the given api, it seems that I can only add it to li block. Is there any other way to achieve that?

1. Enable IME
2. Input some characters.
3. onChange event triggered but editor content is not changed.
4. When I press the non-alphabetical key (ex. comma, period, enter, space), then the change is applied.
