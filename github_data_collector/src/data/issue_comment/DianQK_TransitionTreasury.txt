I am presenting view controller with Evelate transition method but I want to hide mask view after the presenting controller.

is there any way for that?

let updateTransition: TRPresentTransitionMethod = {
				switch self.presentTransition[indexPath.row].name {
				case "Elevate":
					return .elevate(maskView: cell.imageView!, to: UIScreen.main.tr_center)
				default:
					return self.presentTransition[indexPath.row].presentMethod
				}
			}()
			tr_presentViewController(nav, method: updateTransition, completion: {
				print("Present finished.")
			})
Cannot get library to work with current documentation. 
Example: 

`navigationController?.tr_pushViewController(vc, method: TRPushTransitionMethod.Fade, completion: {
    print("Push finish")
 })`

TRPushTransitionMethod is no longer typed on this method `TransitionAnimationable` is.
don't print Second deinit


Do you have an ETA of Swift 4 support? 
Hi,

How .IBanTang method works? I don't get what is the keyView? (UIView)
Any doc on this would be highly appreciated.

Thanks.
能查一下这个问题的原因吗？demo中必现
使用了 demo 的 app 實驗了一下
開啟熱點的時候
present -> dismiss 
畫面會不斷的向上移動
Thanks for creating such a great a great library!

I'm using the Twitter style transition and would like to make the background view a little darker or more opaque so that the View underneath does not show as much. Is this possible? I can't seem to figure out how.

Thanks in advance.
Hello,

Thank you for the library, it's amazing.

I found  a small bug when pushing view with tr_pushViewController . The second view keep using storyboard size (iphone 7) , I'm running on iphone 5s and the view didn't resize.

Anyone got this issue  ?
Thanks.
My code is here:

    let MainStoryBoard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil);
    let ForgotPasswordVC = MainStoryBoard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "ForgotPasswordVC");
    navigationController?.tr_pushViewController(ForgotPasswordVC, method: TRPushTransitionMethod.page);`

I'm getting this error:

    Generic parameter 'T' could not be inferred
