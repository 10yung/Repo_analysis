Hi,

I have a requirement like, I want to integrate TesStack.White Test cases with **Windows Task Scheduler.** 
I have done that. I am running my scripts using nunit-console.exe from batch mode.
Here the problem is, when i use "Run when the user is logged on", Test cases are executing properly.
But when i choose "Run whether user is logged on or not" then test cases are failing. Stating that controls are not finding.

Please give me a solution.

Telerik.Windows.Controls.RadCombobox.SelectedItemText returns null after screen reloads. I am able to read the Selected Item by using Visual UIA Verify. But, was unable to read it through automation code using TestStack.White framework.  Below is the RadComboBox details from xaml page

<telerik:RadComboBox x:Name="ComboBox1"
                                    Style="{StaticResource styleRadComboBoxTransparent}"
                                    ItemsSource="{Binding FitAlgorithms}"
                                    SelectedItem="{Binding  SelectedBeadPlex.CurveFitData.FitAlgorithm, Mode=TwoWay, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}"
                                    IsEnabled="{Binding EditEnabled}"
                                    Margin="0,5,0,0"
                                    >
                                    <telerik:RadComboBox.ItemTemplate>
                                        <DataTemplate>
                                            <TextBlock Text="{Binding Converter={StaticResource EnumDescriptionConverter}}" />
                                        </DataTemplate>
                                    </telerik:RadComboBox.ItemTemplate>

But,
ComboBox1.SelectedItemText returns null in the Automation code. Please share your suggestions.

Thanks.

Hi,  I've run into an issue by which I've gotten my tree and am able to traverse the branches and get to the node I need to operate  on.  I can click on the node and change it's selected value, but I am unable to read the value from the node.  In Inspect I can see a SelectionItem.IsSelected property and it correctly reflects the status of the node but my TestStack.White control doesn't have the capability to read this value.  Am I missing something?
Hello, I need the text from the type cell, witch encapsulates a comboBox. My problem is that the dataGrid cell.getElement() returns AutomationElement type and Cannot be casted to ComboBox, so I cannot access the selectedItem and the text of the selected Item. Do you have any ideas?

Can I test my class library project (automation code) using build pipeline. It's not Unit test case. Used TestStack.White Framework on top. 
Dear,

I'm beginner with C# and White, and I'm trying to automate a very stupid action => Click on the "New" button in Notepad++.
Challenge, I'm building a DLL => I use that DLL in Automation Anywhere (Metabot).

Here is my DLL code :


using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Windows;
using TestStack.White;
using TestStack.White.WindowsAPI;
using TestStack.White.UIItems;
using TestStack.White.UIItems.Finders;

namespace MyAADLL
{
    public class MyAAClass
    {
        public static void ClickButton2(string procName, string applicLaunch, string applicAttach, string getWin, string automationId)
        {
            Application application;
            Process[] processes = Process.GetProcessesByName(@procName);
            if (processes.Length == 0)
            {
                application = Application.Launch(@applicLaunch);
            }
            else
            {
                application = Application.Attach(@applicAttach);
            }
            TestStack.White.UIItems.WindowItems.Window window = application.GetWindow(getWin);
            TestStack.White.UIItems.Button button = window.Get<TestStack.White.UIItems.Button>(TestStack.White.UIItems.Finders.SearchCriteria.ByText(automationId));
            button.Click();
        }
    }
}

I'm trying to make the ClickButton2 function working.

Actually, I provide "notepad++" as value for procName, applicLaunch, applicAttach, "new 5 - Notepad++" as value for getWin and "New" for automationId.

The script is failing when it comes to "TestStack.White.UIItems.Button button = window.Get<TestStack.White.UIItems.Button>(TestStack.White.UIItems.Finders.SearchCriteria.ByText(automationId));".

Could one of you help me with that ? I'm sure for you it's gonna be easy to solve ;-)

Thanks!

Hi Team,

we are part of Automation Testing using Test Stack White, and our WPF application is recently upgraded to 19.1 DevExpress, after that we unable to retrieve getItem() from Datagrid, as getting Null Exception... can any one help us on this. is there any alternative to this, or any workaround... below is our code

ListView dataGrid = window.Get\<ListView>\(SearchCriteria.ByAutomationId("AutoId_LogicContainerGrid"));
GridPattern gridPattern = dataGrid.AutomationElement.GetCurrentPattern(GridPattern.Pattern) as GridPattern;
AutomationElement elemtn = gridPattern.GetItem(1,1);

From the above step we are getting Null Exception, after upgrading the DevExpress to 19.1, where are as the same code is working fine with the older version of DevExpress
