I'm getting errors when running pod update on my project. Looks like this is now trying to pull in another library when using pod 'DropdownMenu' which is a Swift implementation and seems altogether a different library.

How do I create the viewcontrollers dynamically in the container view ? Any help appreciated.

Question above :)

Is there any recommended way to have the content in the view get 'pushed down' by the menu as it opens rather than getting covered? I guess it would be akin to a drawer. Thoughts?

Hey! Amazing control. Very useful for many types of apps.
I was wondering about something that could help me a lot. If I select a child view controller(let's say A) for the container, and then I select another view controller(let's say B), I would like to know if it's possible to return to the same view controller A(using the menu) without creating a new view controller. Basically, every time I move from one view to another using the menu, a new controller appears and the old one is released. I found the DropdownMenuSegue class but because I'm quite new to objective C, I don't know how to preserve my view controllers. I need to keep them because my view controllers are in fact navigation controllers and I wouldn't like to lose the current view when I select a menu item and then come back.
Help would be much appreciated. Thanks!

So i have setup the menu without effort but now i wanna call another view from inside one of the menu views and i am calling either one and not been able to show anything:

```
[self showViewController:replay sender:self];
or
[self presentViewController:replay animated:YES completion:nil];
```

Any ideas on how to do that?

I'm having a problem where the container view seems to be blocking the buttons in the drop down menu from being clickable. If I reduce the top size of the container view way down the buttons then are able to receive touch events but this is different from the intended design. Does anybody have a fix for this? 

Just to let you know, it's better to disable UITapGestureRecognizer.setCancelsTouchesInView in the example app. I had been struggling to get a tableView.didSelectRowAtIndexPath event.

The menu shows up just fine and works great on an iPhone 5, but the buttons aren't clickable on the 6 or on an iPad. Has this happened to you? I can't figure out why this happens.
