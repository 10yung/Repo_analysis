... with template from https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Android.gitignore

This is a question, not an issue. I'm curious, why are there 2 classes that have exactly the same signature: MoviesRepository and MoviesDataStore here: https://github.com/mrsegev/MovieNight/tree/master/domain/src/main/kotlin/com/yossisegev/domain

Is this a standard approach by duplicating the class? I imagine if you had a very large project with lots of models and methods it would become a bit confusing..
