I keep getting this error when I try to upload the JSON data. My key is correct although in step 2 in the tutorial I couldn't complete steps 10,11,12 as there is no notepad in the quick settings tab.

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I am not managing to make the chatbot recognize my speech input as German. I managed to change the text-to-speech to German, but when I talk into the mic the bot thinks I talk English. I saw that I can possibly change it via
config.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = "de-de";
But honestly, I have no clue where to put it.
Am I right that I have to change something in the SpeechModule.js?

I solved it by changing
o = i.SpeechResultFormat.Simple, s = e.locale || "en-US"
to
o = i.SpeechResultFormat.Simple, s = "de-DE"
in wwwroot/lib/CognitiveServices.js
Text to speech does not work on the introduction message. It only activates when we press on the microphone and hence it starts working from promt messages .
I want to build a bot which talks from the very first introduction message. How to do this?
