Since I have two monitors, I like to keep Terminals maximized on one monitor while I work on another.  Many times after I close a client connection, the Terminals window will shrink down to a minimum size.  Meaning I have to maximize the screen again.

I know this isn't the end of the world, but it's very annoying.  Also, it doesn't appear to do it all the time.  I've only seen it do it when I close the last client.  Meaning, as long as I have an open connection, it's fine.  But closing the last one (often times), it will shrink the window.


There appears to be no way to issue Ctrl-Alt-Del when in VNC connection
Add master password commandline argument to provide master password from commandline. This is useful for launching terminals from scripts.
IT appears as though it is not possible to create read only access to a database for terminals.  can you confirm the correct database permissions needed to create read-only access for a large team.  thanks
Is SSH2 support planned? 
I minimized or removed the menu bar consisting of File, View, Favorites, etc. Now I am not able to get it back as there is no icon or option to bring it back. Please suggest.
My laptop crashed and when I opened Terminals all my connections were gone.  I had an export from a year ago and I am unable to see the menus so that I can import my old connections.  Also for some reason it set a password and when I uninstall and reinstall it will not let me reset password.  
Hey contributors?  This project still alive?
Hi,

First, thanks for the Terminals program.

I am using version 4.0.1 (Files store).

I have my username and password stored using credential management.  I have all servers setup to use this stored credential account which works perfectly.  If I right-click on any server and use a different account and press the Enter/Return key then it opens 2 remote sessions to the same server, one session under my stored account and the other session using the alternate account.  If I click the OK button using the mouse, then one 1 remote session is opened using the alternate account.

Any ideas?
