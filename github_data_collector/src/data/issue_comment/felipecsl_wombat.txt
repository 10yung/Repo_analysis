Unrelated, gemnasium badge is reporting errors.

Hope this little helps. I'd send a PR, but I'm not using the gem right now.
Thanks  for the work you do with this gem

Hello, I am need remove multiples nodes
with class css

```
.media
.ads
.cite-content

```

How do I remove a nodes css?:

```
class ListCrawler
      include Wombat::Crawler

      base_url "https://rpp.pe"
      path "/politica/actualidad/ministerio-publico-las-discrepancias-entre-pablo-sanchez-y-pedro-chavarry-noticia-1142342"

      explore css: '#article-body' do |e|
        e remove: '.media'
        e remove: '.ads'
        e remove: '.cite-content'
      end
end
pp ListCrawler.new.crawl

#ERRORR!!
```

With standalone gem Mechanize works

```
 mechanize = Mechanize.new { |agent|
  agent.user_agent_alias = 'Mac Safari'
}

page = mechanize.get('https://rpp.pe/politica/actualidad/ministerio-publico-las-discrepancias-entre-pablo-sanchez-y-pedro-chavarry-noticia-1142342')

text = page.at('#article-body')

text.at_css(".media").remove
text.at_css(".ads").remove
text.at_css(".cite-content").remove

puts text
```
Someone who is an expert can help me?

Thanks!
Is it possible to crawl through the images and get the image source?
Small API improvement idea: instead of
```
stuff({ css: 'div.some-class' }, :list)
```

I want to be able to write:
```
stuff :list, css: 'div.some-class'
```
To me, this reads more like idiomatic ruby.

For the edge case where a user specifies both positional and hash arguments, we could just accept the first one? Or merge the two?

If you think this is worth it, I'd be happy to make a PR ðŸ˜„
I found `page` function is existed.
And I guess it is used for url parameter named page. So I code `page: 2`. But page function is not work. It give me error `ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 0)`. Did I use `page` function not correctly?

I think we should have function to customize http header in this library.

http://docs.seattlerb.org/mechanize/HTTP/Agent.html#Headers
i have tried 
```
"css=p.someclass + p"
"css=p.someclass ~ p" 
```

None of these worked.
Open ended versions are dangerous
Hey is it possible to remove all previously stored cookies between a request? In mechanize there is agent.cookie_jar.clear!, is this possible in wombat?

I'm pretty new to all of this :)
Thanks
