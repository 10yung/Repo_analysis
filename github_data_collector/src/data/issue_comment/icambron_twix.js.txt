It seems really weird, because `simpleFormat` works fine, but `humanizeLength` invariably fails with the error `TypeError: Cannot read property 'humanize' of undefined`

```js
const getText = timeToAdd => {
  const now = moment();
  const reminderTime = moment().add(timeToAdd, 'minutes');
  const range = now.twix(reminderTime.format()); //  range is a time span from the current time to the reminderTime
   const humanized = range.humanizeLength();  //  Fails with "TypeError: Cannot read property 'humanize' of undefined"
  // const humanized = range.simpleFormat();  //  Works fine
  return humanized;
};
```

Any thoughts? Thanks for this great project!
There is a while Bug I am iterating with weeks between 2 dates and here is the code that I used
```
var itr = moment.twix(new Date('2018-10-06T00:00:00'),new Date('2018-11-12T00:00:00')).iterate("weeks");
var range=[];
while(itr.hasNext()){
    range.push(itr.next().format("YYYY-M-D"))
}
console.log(range);
```
**Which generates the below result:**

```
"2018-9-30"
"2018-10-7"
"2018-10-14"
"2018-10-21"
"2018-10-28"
"2018-11-4"
"2018-11-11"
```
When I was requesting for week sequence starting from '6th October' why I am getting results from a week prior.

**Expected Result:**
```
"2018-10-6"
"2018-10-12"
"2018-10-19"
"2018-10-26"
"2018-11-1"
"2018-11-8"
```
How can I resolve this issue??
I am facing a problem with twix's iterate method as the result is trimming of the time from the results.
Implementation:
`var itr = moment.twix(new Date('2012-01-15T16:30:00'),new Date('2012-03-20T16:30:00')).iterate("months");`

**Current Result:**
```
2012-01-15T00:00:00
2012-01-16T00:00:00
2012-01-17T00:00:00
2012-01-18T00:00:00
2012-01-19T00:00:00
2012-01-20T00:00:00
```

**But Expected:**

```
2012-01-15T16:30:00
2012-01-16T16:30:00
2012-01-17T16:30:00
2012-01-18T16:30:00
2012-01-19T16:30:00
2012-01-20T16:30:00
```

So what has to be done to iterate method so that above result can be fetched
[This package](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/twix) doesn't have a [default file](https://www.jsdelivr.com/features#publishing-packages) set. You can set it via `jsdelivr`, `browser`, or `main` field in `package.json`
Hey,

I now know about toArray() but I got caught out today when iterate() didn't return an iterable suitable for Array.from()

```
@home:~/src$ cat test.js
```
``` javascript
const moment = require("moment")
const twix = require("./lib/twix.min.js")

let start = new Date("2018-01-01");
let end = new Date("2018-06-01");

console.log(moment(start).twix(end).toArray("days").length);
console.log(Array.from(moment(start).twix(end).iterate("days")).length);
console.log(Array.from(moment(start).twix(end).iterate("days")));
```
```
@home:~/src$ node test.js
152
0
[]
```

Array.from() *should* expand the iterable:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from

so I guess the object returned from iterate is not truly 'iterable' in the way required by the spec.


Nice library though.. saved me a bunch of time elsewhere so I'm still net positive on time-savings thanks to twix. :-)
It wasn't immediately clear to me that `twix` should be imported only for its side effects on `moment` using `import "twix"` instead of `import * from "twix"`

Maybe worth adding to the detailed documentation?
:heavy_exclamation_mark: This is **not possible to use Twix.js with moment-timezone** when I importing like this via **Webpack**

```
import moment from 'moment-timezone'
import 'twix'
```
And **use** something like
```
moment.twix()
```

So I got **error**

```
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4_moment_timezone___default.a.twix is not a function
```

-----

:tada: **But this is possible** to do if I want to use **moment** as **moment-timezone**

```
import moment from 'moment-timezone'
import _moment from 'moment'
import 'twix'
```
And **use** something like

```
_moment.twix()
```

**Question is**, Does it possible to use `moment.twix()` when **moment** is **moment-timezone** ?

_PS: All are latest versions_
Thanks so much.
