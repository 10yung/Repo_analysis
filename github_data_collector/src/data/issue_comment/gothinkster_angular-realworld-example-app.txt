- to build and serve the app with ssr, use command `yarn build:ssr && yarn serve:ssr`
- add service worker
- add angular universal
- change the AuthModule to be loaded lazily
The original demo link does not work when a user hits the refresh button on a page different than home. 

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Go to angular.realworld.io
2. Click on sign in
3. Hit browser refresh

**Expected**
Same page is displayed

**Actual**
A 404 is displayed

I went ahead and deployed the application on [Stormkit](https://www.stormkit.io) and added a config to redirect all requests to index.html.

Here is the working version: https://ng-realworld.stormkit.dev

> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Hi,

I have yarn installed the dependencies, but it looked like it has failed for many errors.

Could someone indicate the version of node, yarn , and the angular, so to eliminate the errors?

Thanks
Hi, 

I guess I'd start with asking if there is any special reason why importing the ionicons css in the index.html itself ?

```
  <link href="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@4.2.2/dist/css/ionicons.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
  <link href="//code.ionicframework.com/ionicons/2.0.1/css/ionicons.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
```
Should the ionicons package is added to `package.json` and css path is added to `styles: []` in `angular.json` ? (which is supposed to be best practice ?)

Readme modified.
If you want to change the API URL to a local server, in the README you can see the instructions that suggests to edit `src/environments/environment.ts` and change api_url to the local server's URL (i.e. localhost:3000/api)

However, if you do that, you will get a CORS error:

`Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/api/articles?limit=10&offset=0' from origin 'http://localhost:4200' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.`

Maybe in the instructions will be useful to also indicate that a proxy must be configurated:

1. Create a file `src/proxy.conf.json` with the content:

```
{
  "/api": {
    "target": "URL",
    "secure": false
  }
}
```
(i.e. URL = http://localhost:8000)

2. Edit the file `angular.json` to include:
```
...
"serve": {
          ...
          "options": {
            ...
            "proxyConfig": "src/proxy.conf.json"
          },
          "configurations": {
           ...
          }
},
```

3. Point to the proxy url in `src/environments/environment.ts`

```
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  api_url: 'http://localhost:4200/api'
};
```
