Is logic/code behind Render generic enough to be cross-platform? Is Render tightly coupled with iOS components?

For example, if I want to render web components or run Render on Android, how can I use (or extend) Render to do that? How is Render compared to [SwiftWebUI](https://github.com/SwiftWebUI/SwiftWebUI)?
The all library changed dramatically and new documentation and examples are required.
