When the timetrap command is launched, the following message is displayed on stderr: 
> /path/to/home/.gem/ruby/2.7.0/gems/sequel-4.43.0/lib/sequel/adapters/sqlite.rb:109: warning: rb_check_safe_obj will be removed in Ruby 3.0

I run the following version of Ruby (on Archlinux): ruby 2.7.0p0 (2019-12-25 revision 647ee6f091) [x86_64-linux].
Timetrap gives this error if running with new sqlite3 v.1.4.0:

Parsing documentation for timetrap-1.15.1
Before reporting this, could you check that the file you're documenting
has proper syntax:

  /Users/foob/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.6.2/bin/ruby -c lib/Getopt/DelimScanner.rb

RDoc is not a full Ruby parser and will fail when fed invalid ruby programs.

The internal error was:

	(NoMethodError) undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass

ERROR:  While executing gem ... (NoMethodError)
    undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass

Hello,
I configured my .zshrc file as stated in the manual (with fpath before and after autoload and compinit)
```
# autocomplete for timetrap https://github.com/samg/timetrap
fpath=(/var/lib/gems/2.5.0/gems/timetrap-1.15.1/completions/zsh $fpath)
autoload -U compinit
compinit
```

But when I try auto complete with tab, the following error is written instantly in the shell
`t s ......No such file or directory - sqlite3`

Probably a sqlite3 problem but I couldn't find any hints how to solve the problem. The database as written in the config file exists. Any hints appreciated.

Config file on my xubuntu
```
database_file: "/home/xxx/.timetrap.db"
round_in_seconds: 900
append_notes_delimiter: " "
formatter_search_paths:
- "/home/xxx/.timetrap/formatters"
default_formatter: text

auto_sheet_search_paths:

Thanks in advance
Dear Community,
I've got a Problem during the Installation of timetrap. I want to install on debian "stretch" Linux.
First I installed with "apt-get" the package ruby. I think that was ok - here a Listing of dpkg:
```
roman@luna:~$ dpkg -l | fgrep ruby

```
Then I chanched to root and made the command as described:
```
root@luna:/home/roman# gem install timetrap
Fetching: sequel-4.43.0.gem (100%)
Successfully installed sequel-4.43.0

```
What did I made wrong? Do I have to download anything before using the command "gem
install timetrap"?

Can anyone help me?


Hello,

I am just curious if there is a way to require notes when checking out rather than in? In the documentation it seems like this is an `in` only feature?

Sorry if this is an obvious question and I am missing something.

Thanks!

Remove sequel dependency on 4.43.0 to make it more flexible for packaging. 
It does not seem possible to remove a note once it is added.
I tried to use `t edit ''` and variations of it, but the note remains.

Current workaround:
`t edit` with a zero-width space as argument at least removes any *visible* notes.
Hello
Love the app, it is super useful. their issue in which I am having on OSX

we I run `t d -f ical`
`undefined method `dtstart' for #<Timetrap::Formatters::Ical:0x007fdb7b9e5e18>`

when i check the file it creates, their is no data.

so I re-install the gem icalendar and tried icalendar2.

any ideas what could be the cause:?
My timetrap DB is getting quite large with many thousand entries and it has gotten much slower lately. Is there a way to move the archived entries to another DB or another way make it faster again?
