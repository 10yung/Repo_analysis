- Fixed redis connect bug for standalone server
- Fixed FiberError when controller trying to connect trigger dispatcher
I see websocket-rails using old redis version. Redis has no longer support connect method. 
Here is the changelog. Redis has changed this long back 1 Nov 2015

https://github.com/redis/redis-rb/commit/895cc3211e335a8fd9ba9322cd311c09eea9621f#diff-4ac32a78649ca5bdd8e0ba38b7006a1eR3.

Can you please support websocket-rails  with latest redis? Or should I create pull request?
In standalone mode,  the websocket_rails.log can only shows event from client, I dont't know how to send_message to user in model or controller, use WebsocketRails.users is blank.
Hi to all!
I'm using `rails 4.2.4`, `websocket-rails 0.7.0` and `redis-rails 4.0.0`.
In `development` mode all works well,
but in production when i try to read `Rails.cache` i getting
`eventmachine not initialized: evma_connect_to_server`

I spend many hours to deep dive into this issue, but I can't get it work. Anybody solve this error?

Hi, please help me. I need to know what version of redis-rb(gem) and redis(unix) are stable with websocket-rails version 0.7.0.

Thank you!

Last commit was almost a full year ago, last PR was touched in December. Have people moved to Rails 5 + ActionCable? Are people still successfully using this project despite the 170 open issues?
I'm not running the standalone version, and I dont have redis installed on my local environment setup, however I see this on any rake command, from the hiredis-rb gem.

"WARNING: could not load hiredis extension, using (slower) pure Ruby implementation."

Why is redis required if i'm not using the standalone version?
Why this is not possible:

```
new WebSocketRails('/websocket');
```

Have to put the host hardcoded is tedious. What I did at the end is:

```
var server_host = window.location.origin || location.protocol + '//' + location.host
var dispatcher = new WebSocketRails(server_host + '/websocket');
```

But I wonder why is necessary to specify the host?
It is unclear to me in the document is Multiple Servers and Background jobs (Sync Mode) was intended to work only with Standalone Server Mode.  Can you clarify if they should be run together or can they be used independent.
