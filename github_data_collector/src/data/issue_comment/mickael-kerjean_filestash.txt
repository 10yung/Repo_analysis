Description: title
Steps: navigate to demo.filestash.app on Firefox mobile and type in a password field
Observed: input shown as plain text, keyboard suggestions active
Expected: input obfuscated as dots
> user: I have some multi GB files that I'm sharing and the browser first tries to display them. For example, some large zipped data files split into smaller portion.

> ME: That's odd, can you share such a zip file? There's some logic in place to detect if the content is binary or not and if binary display the download button instead. It looks like a bug from that code

> user: You can create a multi-part zip file and see what happens when you click on part z01. I have a set of data files with 2GB parts and it doesn't work properly.

we will make it happen if we ever reach 100 thumbs up :+1:
Any plans to add yet another sorting flavor - namely separately sorting directories first and then separately files (i.e. combination of the current `sort by type` and `sort by name`)?

Currently if one chooses sorting based on name, directories and files will end up mixed. I think many people are not used to this (including myself), so I'm creating this tracking issue for that :wink:.

Btw. filestash looks like a really nifty software - it's easy to setup (except for slightly misleading error messages like "invalid password" when the SFTP directory was actually set to an invalid path or "connection refused" when actually the host wasn't reachable at all due to incorrect DNS translation) and seems to do nearly everything needed (though I'd wish to switch on/off hidden files visibility interactively/on_demand in each folder and not as a system-wide option).
When I am logged in I can browse images using the image navigation bar, and with the arrow keys;

If I open the image using the share URL, in a private session or incognito mode the navigation bar is not present. And I can not navigate using the arrow keys either.

Happens both with Firefox and Chrome. I would expect the behavior to be the same, a bit puzzled as to why it's not...
S3 have many auth signature version, can we add signature config in S3 advance option?
all the auth signature version definition in [auth type](https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/f602fe60b7373629e20b0bfb3d3ca5380e203daf/botocore/auth.py#L859)

In my case, I have many self hosted S3 server, a part of server host by [minio](https://min.io), and another part of server host by ceph, they have diff signature version. so, I want to add auth signature version in S3 config.

Thx...
Hi I thought I would be good if you were able to compress and uncompress files/folders this would allow for the easy download and upload of folders or multiple files

Hi @mickael-kerjean 

If I create a file or diretory via filestash the date isn't displayed. When I click through the directories, it is displayed again.

See:

Hi @mickael-kerjean 

Is it possible to download a directory or multiple files?
