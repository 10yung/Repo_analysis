Got this error when I import sticky-kit with webpack :

`Uncaught TypeError: $ is not a function
at Object.<anonymous> (sticky-kit.js:9)
at Object../node_modules/sticky-kit/dist/sticky-kit.js (sticky-kit.js:326)
at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:19)
...`

My import line `import 'sticky-kit/dist/sticky-kit';` is working.
jQuery is working too (debugged with a console log), I have the right lines in environment.js and config etc.

In the config, I added this rule as seen in another question but it didn't work : 
   `{
        test: /\.js$/,
        include: [
          path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules', 'sticky-kit')
        ],
        use: [{
          loader: 'imports-loader?jQuery=jquery,$=jquery,window=>global&window.jQuery=jquery,this=>window,define=>false'
        }]
      }`

What am I not doing right ?
Look this question in my cumputer https://monosnap.com/file/Um9wsbVrTjeCKAew0KxWMrqsq32yOP
I have the situation that the content fits at the time when the query is attached fits perfectly into the container. Therefore it is ignored ...

I have an accordion in my content. If I open it the height changes significantly and then the sticky element should kick in. Therefore I would suggest to add an `force` flag. This flag should grant that the content could be attached anyway. The check should be:

````
 if (!force || height === parent_height) {
        return;
      }
```` 
When trying to import sticky-kit there is an error that the module cannot be found.

This is because `package.json` has an entry point of `sticky-kit.js`, but that file exists in the `dist` folder.  
To remedy this I converted the coffeescript into the location that `package.json` is looking.

Additionally, I added an import of jQuery since it is just assumed to exist - this now forces it to exist.
Hi 

I have a layout width the search at the left and the result container at the right, The result is empty at the first term them I throw an ajax call and fill the result container with the result in infinite scroll. 

My question is how can I throw the stick function in every append of results?

I have the sticky on other page and it works perfectly. But it's a static page.
This can be temporarily bypassed by changing the site to http://, which is an SEO issue, but will allow you to click the "Scroll it" buttons.
Hi, 

Is there a main reason why this is happening on some pages (this one for example https://danyduchainethemes.com/shade-garden/2019/04/14/how-a-stranger-things-kid-inspired-littles-most-enviable-look/) and not other (this one : https://danyduchainethemes.com/shade-garden/contact/).

On the pages where it readjusts, it makes the sidebar jittery.

Thanks
Sticky column is jumping to the bottom at the middle of the page
When use ctrl+f to search a keyword on a webpage, normally the browser automatically jumps to the results one by one. 
Now I have two columns on the page with different heights and apply this kit on both columns. The script functions well. Then I search a keyword, and the results in the longer column are located correctly but those in the shorter column not. The browser still highlights the word but doesn't scroll to it. 
Is there anyway to fix this?
