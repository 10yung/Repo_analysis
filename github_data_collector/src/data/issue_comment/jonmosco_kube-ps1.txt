I'm loading the kube-ps1.sh in the .bashrc as described but I'm getting the following error
```
modglue::ext_process::determine_path_: executable helper not found
```

Regardless the error, the tools works but it does not update the context/ns if i change it with the CLI (kubectx for ex.) unless I reload the shell (source ~/.bashrc) 

I'm using windows 10 linux subsystem

I notice that start-up time was pretty long and looked at the caching code.

Although caching is used within a single session, the cache is not used cross-session. People opening lots of shells (like me) get a full kubectl config load every time a new shell is started.

This PR saves the 4 import vars (KUBE_PS1_CONTEXT, KUBE_PS1_KUBECONFIG_CACHE, KUBE_PS1_LAST_TIME and KUBE_PS1_NAMESPACE) to disk, read them from disk at startup, and will update the cache-file every time they change.
If you quickly changing contexts (with `kubectx -`) you will realize that: <br> `$KUBE_PS1_CONTEXT` and `kubectl config current-context` can give you different values.

AFAIK, this is happening when the rate of switching is less than 1 second.
On newer macos versions (Catalina, 10.15), the emoji rendered for \u2638 is now monochrome.

Before 10.15:

I find it helpful to have the cluster name displayed, so I added that option in addition to the context and namespace.
Thanks for this! It would be nice to have prefix and suffix colors too.
