Hi,
I read the troubleshooting page but couldn't find anything related to this issue.
I have the docker section showing all the time in my prompt, no matter where I am in the filesystem. What could cause this? Is it because my user is part of the docker group? If so, can it be fixed?
Thanks

Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

#### Description
This PR is focused to fix #773. The problem is caused because of this [line](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt/blob/92463cd0cc3fb5baee60c57e505e2626c3668b8a/scripts/uninstall.sh#L93), the regular expression is invalid, so when the `sed` command runs it throws an error and the value passed to the next pipe operator is empty, because of that all the content of `.zshrc` file is deleted.

So I fixed the invalid regex (It was only a missing escape on "(") and added some tests. To test the uninstall script easily I updated the version of `shunit` because in the newer version exists there are two new functions, assertContains, and assertNotContains, that helped me. I have also removed some blank characters in enabling statements on `install.sh` script, otherwise, the uninstall script doesn't remove the enabling statements, since it doesn't...

I also have identified some potentials problems and improvements to the uninstall script. I will leave here a list of them :).

- `tput` color logic is evaluated even when `tput` is not installed. So warning messages appears in stdout.
- `$USER_SOURCE` is defined even if unused in uninstall script.
- uninstall script doesn't work well for `oh-my-zsh` instructions installation on `README.md`.
- uninstall script doesn't handle whitespaces at the beginning of each line.

This is in reference to [this issue comment](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt/issues/682#issuecomment-573781107).

**Current behavior**

Modifying the value of `SPACESHIP_PROMPT_DEFAULT_PREFIX` does not have any affect on the rendered prompt.

**Expected behavior**

If set in a `.zshrc` file, a line such as
```zsh
export SPACESHIP_PROMPT_DEFAULT_PREFIX="&"
```
and/or
```zsh
export SPACESHIP_RPROMPT_DEFAULT_PREFIX="&"
```

should overwrite the default value of `via`, and any prompt sections which utilize this prefix should display the configured value.

#### Relevant Zsh configuration (`.zshrc`)

I have configured the value in a [`.spaceship-config.zsh`](https://github.com/PSalant726/dotfiles/blob/master/.spaceship-config.zsh#L44) file:
```zsh
export SPACESHIP_PROMPT_DEFAULT_PREFIX="&"
```
which is `source`d by my [`.zshrc`](https://github.com/PSalant726/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc#L182) file:
```zsh
for file in ~/.{p10k.zsh,spaceship-config.zsh,credentials,fzf.zsh}; do
  [ -r "$file" ] && [ -f "$file" ] && source "$file";
done;
```

#### Environment

**Spaceship version:** 3.11.2
**Zsh version:** 5.7.1
**Zsh framework:** `oh-my-zsh`
**Zsh plugin manager:** None
**Terminal emulator:** iTerm
**Operating system:** macOS

No
* Is it worth to be aware of it?
Yes, for Flutter and dart developers
* Will it slow down the prompt?
No

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Flutter version and branch currently active like shown in VSCode eg. `Flutter 1.12.13+hotfix.6 â€¢ channel beta` and Dart version eg. `Dart v2.7.0` is folder contains `pubspec.yml`. I am considering here that Dart is mostly used with Flutter.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

No alternative considered

**Documentation, adoption**

**Current behavior**

After installing Regolith with ZSH + Spaceship enabled the following error can be seen in the terminal after each command: `awk: line 1: syntax error at or near ,`

**Expected behavior**

No Error should appear

#### Relevant Zsh configuration (`.zshrc`)

```zsh
# Your configuration here
```

#### Environment

**Spaceship version:** 3.11.2 (use `echo $SPACESHIP_VERSION`)
**Zsh version:** zsh 5.7.1 (x86_64-ubuntu-linux-gnu)
**Zsh framework:** oh-my-zsh
**Zsh plugin manager:** None
**Operating system:** popOS! 19.10

**Possible solution**
This produces the bug:
``` 
+spaceship_battery:19> battery_status_and_percent=+spaceship_battery:19> awk '{ match($0, /^Battery [0-9]+: (.+), ([0-9]+)%/, arr); print arr[1] ":" arr[2] }'
awk: line 1: syntax error at or near ,
```

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Display a configurable icon in the prompt when a user is currently connected to a VPN.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

This is a well implemented, optional feature in the [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme.

**Documentation, adoption**

In either `SPACESHIP_PROMPT_ORDER` or `SPACESHIP_RPROMPT_ORDER` variable, include `vpn`. This will add an icon to the prompt (maybe `\UE138`?) at the selected location only when the user is currently connected to a VPN.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

Just a feature request. Can you provide a way to make spaceship "transistent", so only last prompt is fully buffed and old ones get minimal? 

[Here's a demo](https://www.reddit.com/r/zsh/comments/dsh1g3/new_powerlevel10k_feature_transient_prompt/)

**Is your feature request related to new section on prompt? Then consider the following questions:**

* Will it clutter the prompt?

On the contrary.

* Is it worth to be aware of it?

I think this may be one of selling points

* Will it slow down the prompt?

No.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

I would like to have an option in spaceship prompt to enable transistent mode as in p10k.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

p10k is the only I'm aware of.

**Maybe a screenshot?**
