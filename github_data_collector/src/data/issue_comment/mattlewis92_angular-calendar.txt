**Describe the bug**

Hi I do have some issues with the view day-view-scheduler below are the description:

### First issue :
In my case I have 8 different users to display in the day-view-scheduler and the day-view-column-header resize the column instead of keeping the same size for the container and add a overflow-x
![scheduler-view-issue1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46450511/72426017-3952db00-3789-11ea-9406-9a7d8547ece9.gif)


## Second issue : 
If you drag and event overlapping an other one this will hide one of the event. could we do something like in the other views ?

With these changes I can correctly compile my app with Ivy enabled. Followed indications on https://angular.io/api/common/NgTemplateOutlet, it seems the same directive is not supported on ng-templates anymore.

Fixes #1161
**Describe the bug**

Getting the following error when attempting to build a project depending on angular-calendar with ivy enabled:
`Can't bind to 'ngTemplateOutlet' since it isn't a known property of 'ng-template'.`

I think I identified the issue already, fix is on the way

**Describe the bug**
The bug is in a particular module of the angular calendar, the module is Day View Scheduler([link](https://mattlewis92.github.io/angular-calendar/#/day-view-scheduler)), in the demo if a user is having no events that user is getting removed and in the code given I'm not sure how to disable it. Moreover, if the day is changed the user is no more there.
Please look into it.

In our project we use this plagin. It's cool! And thank's you for your work!
But I have some problem...
I use example Day view scheduler in my app. And when users.lenght > 5, 
and i want to move event from first to last user (also change start and end time -> moving event to right and up or down). In finally only changing user, not time for event.
Because, when users a lot and distance(dragEvent.x) also big, function  roundToNearest, which calculate Math.round,  return 1 and this change normal behavior.

I could solve problem, when added custom function, which return 0.
I run test in project and unfortunately some of them was failed. Please,  help me in my problem.

Hey everyone 👋 

I'm now on [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/users/mattlewis92/sponsorship), so if you're using this calendar and would like to support me financially, please consider becoming a backer. Bronze sponsors even get higher priority when filing issues!

If you're a company using this project, then you can use GitHub sponsors as a means of purchasing a monthly support contract, by becoming a Silver Sponsor for only $250 a month! Platinum sponsors even get a free one to one consultation with me, where I'll help guide you on how to integrate this calendar within your application.

Alternatively, if you'd like to make a one time donation, you can [paypal me](https://www.paypal.me/mattlewis92) instead.

If you have any questions then please feel to comment below 👇 
Hey everyone! 👋 

I currently work on this project for free in my spare time, and I'm looking into some ways to make the project more sustainable, so that I can justify spending more time maintaining it. One of the methods I'm considering, is by creating some premium demos, they would work exactly the same as the [current demos](https://mattlewis92.github.io/angular-calendar/#/kitchen-sink), except to access the source code you (or better yet your employer!) would need to pay a fee (somewhere around the **$100** mark).

Some of the things I'm considering making premium demos of are:

- Show events on the month view that span multiple days (https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-calendar/issues/758)
- Mobile friendly components
- Usage with angular material
- Fetching holidays from an API and showing them as distinct milestone style events (https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-calendar/issues/809)
- Showing how to support non-gregorian calendars e.g. hebrew, hijri, jalali etc
- Infinite scrolling the month / week / day views, apple calendar style
- Adding some more advanced functionality on the [day view scheduler](https://mattlewis92.github.io/angular-calendar/#/day-view-scheduler)
- RTL
- Import and export of events to ICS: https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-calendar/issues/993
- Grouping events together and expanding to show more

If you would be willing to pay for this, please add a thumbs up on the issue, plus if you have any other ideas of demos you would pay to see, please comment here!

Thanks for taking the time to read this and for using my project! ❤️

Hey everyone! 👋 

I'm looking at creating an online video course, that shows you how to setup and customise this calendar within your application, so that by the end of the course you have a feature rich google calendar like component that goes way beyond the basic demos. Every video would be accompanied by the code we build in each step that you can checkout, play with and use freely in your application. The course would cover:

0. Overview - what the course covers
1. Getting started - installing the calendar into your project
2. Fetching events from an API (google calendar? or a custom node one?) and displaying them on the calendar
3. Grouping events into different calendars that you can show and hide
4. Showing holidays on the calendar
5. Adding an event when you click on the calendar and saving to an API
6. Adding an event by dragging and selecting a part of the calendar
7. Blocking the user from adding events to certain times
8. Editing event titles and colors and deleting and saving them to an API
9. Changing event times by dragging and resizing them
10. Opening a popout tile with more info when you click on an event
11. Making month and week view headers stick at the top and scrolling just the body
12. Adding a current time marker and scrolling to it on the day and week views
13. Having month view events span multiple days
14. Truncating the amount of events shown on the month, week and day view's and adding a show more panel
15. Changing between month, week and day views when clicking on headers within each component
16. Fading out events in the past
17. Adding options to toggle weekends and a 4-day week view
18. Adding a scroll to the month view to change the current month
19. Automatically setting the language of the calendar based on the users language
20. Adding the week number to the month view
21. _Bonus_: Integrating with material design
22. _Bonus_: Integrating with ngrx
23. _Bonus_: Integrating with firebase
24. _Bonus_: Styling the calendar to add an toggle-able dark theme
25. _Bonus_: Setting dates in different timezones
26. _Bonus_: Unit and e2e testing examples

The cost of this course would probably be around **$100** and goes towards the continued development of this project (I currently work on this in my free time for $0 an hour!). If this is something that would interest you, and you (or better yet your employer!) would pay for it, please give a **thumbs up on this issue**. Plus if you have any additional thoughts on what you'd like to see in the course, please comment here so I can produce the best content that benefits everyone.
