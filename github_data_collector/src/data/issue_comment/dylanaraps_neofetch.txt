## Description

This PR implements the ability to display memory in GiB instead of MiB. The default is to use MiB, to preserve current behaviour. The precision for both used and total RAM can be set. These precisions both default to 1.

I also noticed a single character whitespace misalignment and took the liberty of cleaning that up in this PR too.

## Features

Memory can be shown in GiB using `memory_use_gb="on"`
Precision for both used and total GiB can be set separately using `memory_used_gb_prec=<int>` and `memory_used_gb_prec=<int>`.

## Issues

Requested as a feature in https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/issues/1170

Hi, 
I am trying to arrange the info from neofetch in an aesthetic manner, but cannot find a way to disable the disk subtitle from being prefixed with something that throws the infobars from CPU useage and memory out of alignment. 
It would be amazing if an off or none flag could be tried?
Thanks
Just as the title states, trying to display and image in the neofetch output doesn't work when using gnome-terminal. pretty much using the same exact config that I use in Konsole, which works. 

Ubuntu 19.10
## Description

There are two issues on Chrome OS.

First, the ```/etc/lsb-release``` output has changed and has an extra line that's being matched when trying to detect the version. The regex needs to be more specific. I'll open a PR with that once I get the second issue figured out. A second version line was added for the Android support that was added a while back.

Second, the Chrome OS ascii logo only shows when using ```--distro_shorthand tiny```. If I add another * before "Chrom"* then it works but I figure there's some other problem here.

id like if there was a option to turn off disk useage percent as i cant find once to turn it off
## Description

Using Linux Mint 19.1 on an ASUS Maximum Hero VII motherboard the Host is reported as "All Series"

traced this to the fact that neofetch builds host by concatenating the contents of:

```
/sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name
/sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_version
```

The problem is that Mint 19.2 on this motherboard presents its id in that directory as:

```

It may be that the ASUS is simply the black sheep here in terms of the Linux kernel's support of dmi id.  But it looks a lot like a better host string for this scenario could be built from board_vendor and board_name than from product_name which is poorly filled.

get_model() already does clean up of dummy OEM data at the bottom and removes "System Version" and arguably should also remove "All Series" as a aknown ASUS OEM dummy. 

That would leave model blank.  We could add a little section after the cleanup that falls back to bard info if it's available. Something like:

```
            if [[ -f /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_name ||
                    -f /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_version ]]; then
                model="$(< /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_name)"
                model+=" $(< /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_version)"
```

to run at end if $model is empty. 

That would report `Host:  MAXIMUS VII HERO Rev 1.xx` on my box. 

Mind you for board info, the vendor is also useful but hey, that's a minimal analog to missing product info for the machine.

I could happily submit a PR if it helps, when I find time. 

I'm guessing this arises because I built the PC and is an issue only for people who build their own PCs from bits (as in I put this board into a case and here we are).
um aparently ubuntu cinnamon will be a thing https://ubuntucinnamon.org/ so hopefully we will get ascii thingy soon
## Description

Using default configuration terminal console output is unreadable. To restore it 'reset' command is needed (or restart)
If you're suggesting a new feature then just a description will suffice.

Problem can be resolved by changing color_blocks to 'off'
