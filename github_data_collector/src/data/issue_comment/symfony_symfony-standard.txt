adding parameter **logout_on_user_change** to ignore the warning 
Enabling\disabling debug mode depends on empty string existence in cli argument. Why empty string? Is that a typo or what?

https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard/blob/23416c9267d4581779f9b5bad6e780392c9845e9/bin/console#L19

Example:
```bash
bin/console some:command firstArgument ''
```
empty second argument suddenly turning debug mode off
I think that the change introduced in #1044 not such a clear cut case, just spent a lot of time finding why it is not shown any more. With the exception/error case I agree, that the log statement is superfluous, but that is not the case for error codes.

Imagine a command which signals success/failure by return codes (as is usual in CLI), then when you run it, you have no visible feedback on whether it was run successfully or not:

```
bin/console hello:world
```

with the logging for console not filtered out it would be much more user friendly:

```
bin/console hello:world
17:47:32 ERROR     [console] Command "hello:world" exited with code "123" ["command" => "hello:world","code" => 123] []
```
which is I think exactly the reason why the printing out logs in console feature was introduced.

To sum it up, I think not showing the logs in the error code case is more developer unfriendly than them being showed when not needed.
