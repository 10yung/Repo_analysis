Hey shouldn't this be the sigmoid fn ... logistic regression vs linear?
  [~,p]=max(sigmoid(X*all_theta'),[],2);
Because we want the price of a 1650 sq-ft, 3 br house, it's not the sum. I think it's theta0 + theta1 * x1 + theta2 * x2.
fix matrix bug
You want to know the probability of a given number being k, so you need to apply the sigmoid function
