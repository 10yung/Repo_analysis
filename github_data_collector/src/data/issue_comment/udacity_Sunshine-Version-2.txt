How to solve this error?
Unsupported method: BaseConfig.getApplicationIdSuffix().
The version of Gradle you connect to does not support that method.
To resolve the problem you can change/upgrade the target version of Gradle you connect to.
Alternatively, you can ignore this exception and read other information from the model.
there is no option to add fragments in android studio 3.0.1 while using Empty Activity. And the link provided of reading about it and implementing those things I get the blank app in after the final run completing lesson 1.
Is there is another technique of adding fragment into activity?

Hello,

About Phone: OnePlus 3T   Android 6.0.1

I run on the mobile phone will appear this problem, but run on some other mobile phone will not appear.
And I also saw your post also encountered such a problem.  Your website: [http://www.codeprocedures.com/question/udacity-android-sunshine-app-error-abstracttracker-can39t-create-handler-inside-thread-that-has-not-called-looperprepare/](url)

Did you solve?   
Or can you give me some ideas to solve?
Get my branch for Lesson 4 content provider.
On line 86 - this won't even compile:

>  return String.format(context.getString( formatId, today, getFormattedMonthDay(context, dateInMillis)));

remove the method String.format like this:

> return context.getString(formatId, today, getFormattedMonthDay(context, dateInMillis));
It is necessary change font-family in v16/list_item_forecast.xml also?
