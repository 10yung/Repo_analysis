lots of gists in my account that don't need to be there

blockbuilder.org is a very nice online gist editor primarily built for `d3.js` bl.ocks, but it could easily be used as an online gist editor for anything.  Would it be worthwhile to add a function to open a gist in blockbuilder?

On `gist_create()` with large files, at least 1.9 MB or larger (the one I found this on), github api returns a `405 - Method not allowed` and html error body

But the same file I can paste into browser to create a gist.

And same file uploaded to make a gist using an npm cli tool works fine too - but they use git, not the http api, so not a fair comparison

Weird, maybe it's something going on with `httr`
