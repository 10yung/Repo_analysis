I used stretchy Header FlowLayout
after import DisplaySwitcher my Header doesn't seem anymore?


import UIKit

class STCollectionViewFlowLayout: UICollectionViewFlowLayout {
    
    override func shouldInvalidateLayout(forBoundsChange newBounds: CGRect) -> Bool {
        return true
    }
    
    override func layoutAttributesForElements(in rect: CGRect) -> [UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes]? {
        
        let layoutAttributes = super.layoutAttributesForElements(in: rect)       
        
        layoutAttributes?.forEach({ (attributes) in
            if attributes.representedElementKind == UICollectionView.elementKindSectionHeader {
                guard let collectionView = collectionView else {
                    return
                }

                let contentOffsetY = collectionView.contentOffset.y
                
                if contentOffsetY > 0 {
                    return
                }
                let width = collectionView.frame.width
                let height: CGFloat = attributes.frame.height - contentOffsetY
                attributes.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: contentOffsetY, width: width, height: height)

            }
        })
        return layoutAttributes
    }
}

https://dribbble.com/shots/4839248-Card-View-Mode 

### Your Environment

- Version of the component: _insert here_
- Swift version: swift 4.1

It seems that your podspec file is setting version to be 1.0.1 while current version with Swift 4 support is 1.1 

Can you update it?
Could not cast value of type 'UICollectionViewTransitionLayout' (0x10b5dbb08) to 'DisplaySwitcher.TransitionLayout' (0x1087e88f8).

In this function

open func startInteractiveTransition() {
        UIApplication.shared.beginIgnoringInteractionEvents()
        **transitionLayout = collectionView.startInteractiveTransition(to: destinationLayout) { success, finish in
            if success && finish {
                self.collectionView.reloadData()
                UIApplication.shared.endIgnoringInteractionEvents()
            }
        } as! TransitionLayout**
        transitionLayout.layoutState = layoutState
        createUpdaterAndStart()
    }
Hello, 

I've tried to use Cocoapods to install this library however it doesn't seem to be updated to the latest version.

I've tried to get latest version from github but either I've used wrong syntax or it should've been updated on Cocoapods.

Main issue is that I can't get the swift 4 version.


# Report

The first layout transition is broken if the first layout configuration is `.grid`

## Report a bug

###  What did you do?

Update the example project with the following: 

```swift
    fileprivate var layoutState: LayoutState = .grid

    fileprivate func setupCollectionView() {
        collectionView.collectionViewLayout = gridLayout
        // ...
    }
````

### What did you expect to happen?

Proper animation for the layout transition

### What happened instead?

The first animation is not smooth and flickers

### Your Environment

- Version of the component: a02d5a1
- Swift version: 4.1
- iOS version: 11.2.6
- Device: Simulator iPhone X / iPhone 6Plus
- Xcode version: 9.3
- If you use Carthage: 0.29.0

### Project that demonstrates the bug

Simply updating your example project with the code previously provided:
1. Update initial layout in the `setupCollectionView` method for a gridLayout.
2. Update the initial `layoutState` to `.grid`


# Report

Settings a custom `contentInset` on the collection view breaks the layout after changing the layout several times

## Report a bug

###  What did you do?

Update the example code with the following:

```swift
    @IBOutlet fileprivate weak var collectionView: UICollectionView! {
        didSet {
            collectionView.contentInset = UIEdgeInsets(top: 4, left: 4, bottom: 4, right: 4)
        }
    }
```

### What did you expect to happen?

Set the custom `contentInset` on the collection view and  display cells normally 

### What happened instead?

The custom `contentInset` seems to be used but the layout is broken, there is a huge empty space before the first cell appear and the layout animation flickers.

### Your Environment

- Version of the component: a02d5a1
- Swift version: 4.1
- iOS version: 11.2.6
- Device: Simulator iPhone X / iPhone 6Plus
- Xcode version: 9.3
- If you use Carthage: 0.29.0

### Project that demonstrates the bug

Simply updating your example project with the code previously provided on the UICollectionView outlet.

multiple sections are not handled by the layout. Best.
