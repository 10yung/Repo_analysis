we face a issue when want to show dropdown in tableview in older os and xcode work perfactly




Is it possible to make it compatible with Swift Package Manager ?
Thanks!


I added the _@objc_ tag to this properties:

- bottomOffset
- topOffset
- anchorView
- dataSource
- selectionAction

to use them in an Objective-C project.
I've implement a drop down using this library & facing issue after clicking on it. After I select anything from drop down, I have sent user to next screen but the drop down still appears after some time of its disappearing.
