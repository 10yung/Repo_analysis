Not sure if your wanting PR's like this, but i had always wanted to play around with a PS emulator in C#, and since im on linux got it building there.
I've wrapped these fixes in a platform check as it disabling doublebuffering is a bit of a hack to stop crashes.


* Few minor fixes to get it running on Mono on linux.
* Removal of double buffering results in tearing but solves crashing every few minutes.
* Also added .iso to the file picker.

Below is the exception when using double buffering.
