Hey,

I've added 'Install app' button into your README file. Anyone could try your sample application right in browser. Look how it's working!

To learn more, please look at: http://macbuildserver.com/github/opensource/

I added pan gesture, tap gesture, swip gesture to the side bar, just some small changes.

Pretty simple change. Looks nicer than original. I picked this up a while ago somewhere from the internet, not sure exactly where :)

(viewForLeftSidebarAbove, viewForRightSidebarAbove) so you can choose the insertion method.

Now i can can use a drop shadow on the SideBarView

This time the revealedView is slided in synchronized with the main view.

It's implemented just for right side.

The ViewController may now cast a shadow on the left sidebar. Uses QuartzCore and the UIView layer to create the shadow.
