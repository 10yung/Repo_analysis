Any ideas on what's causing this?

This PR was made for adding Bash My AWS support, but decided it would be cool if it *_optionally_* installed and update it, so I abstracted the logic bash-it uses to update the core, and applied it to both cases. I think this would be a nice pattern to extend to other things that may want optional install support, like todo.txt. Let me know what you think.
After I've updated to latest version.

I noticed that themes files is not colored anymore and .bashrc file as well.

Hi,

The go.completion.bash in bash-it is based on: 
https://github.com/thomasf/go-bash-completion

But this tool don't updated for several years.  

The following one is more up to date:

https://github.com/posener/complete
Bash completion for Rails from:
https://github.com/mernen/completion-ruby/blob/master/completion-rails
I'm using Windows 10 `CMD` or PowerShell to connect to my `Centos7` server.

Today after I've installed [Bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it) on the server, I've noticed the Unicode characters is not displayed correctly.

Colorful theme for Python developers with no external

Hi there,

I experience frequently slowness of my prompt and I am keen to debug this.  I am now in a situation where even an empty RETURN on my keyboard takes 6-7 seconds to return the prompt.
Here my actual configuration:

- MacOS Mojave
- `Bash 5.0.11(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin18.6.0)` (according to `bash --version`)
- Bash-it version `e08014e` (last commit as of now)
- Bash-it theme `bobby`

As far as I can see now, commands:
- `rbenv` take 1.9 seconds
- `svn` takes 1.3 seconds

If I se SCM_CHECK=false, I can reduce the _prompt to prompt_ time to 3.6 seconds, which is still a lot.
Where/what else can I check?

Thanks
LM
