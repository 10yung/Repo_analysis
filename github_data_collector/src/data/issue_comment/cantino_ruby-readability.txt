When you don't put 'div' as a tag in the initializer like:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'readability'
    require 'open-uri'
        
    source = open('https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/tutorial/creatingcse').read
    puts Readability::Document.new(source, tags: []).content

it trows the error:
    NullPointerException: 
    from nokogiri.internals.SaveContextVisitor.isHtmlScript(SaveContextVisitor.java:741)

you can put any tags you want, if you don't add 'div' the error happens

using *jruby-9.1.6.0 [ x86_64 ]*

Hello,

I tried to apply readability on a specific layout of The Guardian, which heavily relies on JavaScript but still has most of the text available in the HTML source code:

> http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2014/sep/10/memory-lane-1980s-footballers-at-home-in-pictures

Readability returned this chunk of HTML:

``` html
<div><div> comments <p>Sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion. </p> <p>This discussion is closed for comments.</p> <p> Weâ€™re doing some maintenance right now. You can still read comments, but please come back later to add your own. </p> <p> Commenting has been disabled for this account (why?) </p> </div></div>
```

Do you know guys why the main content is not properly extracted, and if it fixable?

eg.,

```
...
<div id="page">

<div class="article-img">
<img src="/v9/images/1x1-white.jpg" width="660" height="317" alt="iPhone Plus" class="lazy" data-original="/iphoneplus-130205.jpg"><noscript><img src="/iphoneplus-130205.jpg"></noscript>
</div>
<div class="article-img">
<img src="/plus-130906.jpg">
</div>
...
```

will only return `/v9/images/1x1-white.jpg` when `images()` is called.

However, if `images_with_fqdn_uris!("http://bla.com")` is called then subsequent calls to `images()` will return an array with all image URLs (fully qualified with http;//bla.com). 

Now the question is, what the desired behaviour should be?

setting :get_largest_image => true will return only 1 largest image from .images()

check for image size from style attribute, if available, like: style="width:400px; height:300px"

First, thanks for your work on readability :-)

Just a quick feedback (I'm not a heavy user myself): while upgrading an old setup today, I noticed that a raw content is now wrapped into two levels of divs:

``` ruby
1.9.3-p484 :003 > Readability::Document.new("My content").content
 => "<div><div><p>My content</p></div></div>" 
```

while previously (2-year old version) was returned as:

``` ruby
 => "<div><p>My content</p></div>" 
```

Is it expected? I understand that this specific test-case is a bit unrelatistic (not tags at all), but wondered if there could be other similar issues with properly formatted html.

Is it possible to get the HTML of the main content area? I would like to preserve the tags present in the main content area (whitelisted tags, mainly the divs, p tags) 

Readability pulls its article title from the `title` tag right? Well more often than not, the `title` tag has a whole lot of other information besides just the title of the article. It usually includes the title of the site itself and sometimes a category.

I know the original readability script just grabbed the title, but I'm wondering if this version of the script can be modified to grab the actual title of the article from the markup. It seems as though the scoring system is set up to exclude the header tag that contains the article title.

Example:

``` html
<article>
  <div class="article-title">
    <h1>Article title</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="article-content">
    <p>
      Claritatem insitam; est usus legentis in iis qui facit eorum claritatem.
      Investigationes demonstraverunt lectores legere me lius quod ii legunt
      saepius. Claritas est etiam processus dynamicus, qui sequitur mutationem
      consuetudium lectorum. Mirum est notare quam littera gothica, quam nunc
      putamus parum claram, anteposuerit litterarum formas humanitatis per seacula
      quarta decima et quinta decima. Eodem modo typi, qui nunc nobis videntur
      parum clari, fiant sollemnes in futurum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nunc varius risus quis nulla. Vivamus vel magna. Ut rutrum. Aenean
      dignissim, leo quis faucibus semper, massa est faucibus massa, sit amet
      pharetra arcu nunc et sem. Aliquam tempor. Nam lobortis sem non urna.
      Pellentesque et urna sit amet leo accumsan volutpat. Nam molestie lobortis
      lorem. Quisque eu nulla. Donec id orci in ligula dapibus egestas. Donec sed
      velit ac lectus mattis sagittis.
    </p>
  </div>
</article>
```

In the above example, readability will always grab the content from `.article-content` and not the `<article>` tag itself. What can I do to modify the script to grab the whole article, title and all?

I wanted to display the content of the article as it is. That is, with image. Can this be implemented?

main content of the article is extracted using .content. But how can the main content of article be extracted in the same css format?
