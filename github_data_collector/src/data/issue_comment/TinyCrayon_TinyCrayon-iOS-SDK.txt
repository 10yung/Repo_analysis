Facing the following issue while running the ionic ios project in Xcode.
Xcode version 10.0
Mac OS Version 10.13.6

dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libswiftCore.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/tejaswinc/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/5F582F5B-E258-44B3-A77A-8DBB06740812/data/Containers/Bundle/Application/B47ABDA0-0A86-4969-845A-8B985CC52490/Jeerapowder.app/Frameworks/Razorpay.framework/Razorpay
  Reason: no suitable image found.  Did find:

Tried 
Embed Swift Standard Libraries = YES
Clean and rebuilding project.
Manually adding the path of libraries

Quick help is appreciated.

I do not want to use the default UI provided by this library. I want to design my own custom UI. 
Any idea how can I implement this?
Hi!
I selected png and expected result like following.

But the result is that transparent area is filled with black.
Would you please help me how i can solve this problem?

I updated my Xcode to version 11 (to support iOS 13), and I wasn't able to run the library. I receive the message in the title:

> Module compiled with Swift 5.0.1 cannot be imported by the Swift 5.1 compiler

I updated my pod to the latest version, and it seems the latest version in the pod supports 5.0 compiler. Could you please support 5.1 compiler?
any way to customize UI ?
I want to change bottom menu icon, change order of button.
Thank you for your great framework.
I am using TCMask for my app and working properly but suddenly it's showing me following error and goes on a crash. Tried solutions but could not be resolved please help. Thank you in advance.
My code for to redirect TCMask view is : 
    TCMaskView *maskView = [[TCMaskView alloc] initWithImage:self.imageView.image];
    maskView.delegate = self;
    [maskView presentFromRootViewController:self animated:true];

Error : [<TCMask.MaskViewController 0x14001ac00> setValue:forUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key mainView.
We need Swift 5 Support.

Hi! Any news on an updated (paid) version of TinyCrayon? We're looking for a solution for our app, but we can't implement the current ad-based version of TinyCrayon.
