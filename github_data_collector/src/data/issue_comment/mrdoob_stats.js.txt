Hi, 
is there anyway to just get FPS Value.

My Goal/idea is, if the fps drops below a certain value, to stop/disable animation on my website.
last line in r17: 

```js
export { Stats as default };
```
last line in r16: 

```js
if ( typeof module === 'object' ) {
  module.exports = Stats;
}
```
Resolves https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/issues/104.
window.devicePixelRatio could be less than 1 when zoomed out in chrome, in the following code, after rounding, the var PR = 0, and this value is used to calculate the width and height of the stats window. thus errors.

it's valid to have a float number as px, e.g. 12.321px, the rounding seems not necessary.

In order to solve #100 and #97
It seems that cdnjs version not cached properly from github.

Reproduction steps::
1) add <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/stats.js/r16/Stats.min.js"></script>
2) insert code
```
var stats = new Stats();
stats.showPanel( 1 );
document.body.appendChild( stats.dom );
```
3) get an error: `Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': parameter 1 is not of type 'Node'.`


Refactored the visual config into it's own variable.
The users of this code can now pass (partial or full) custom configuration to customise how the displays work.

Closes #87

performance.now() might not exists in some old browsers.
The current code assume that if performance exists, performance.now() exists too.
This might be false, for example on Android stock browser 4.1.2.
