I am using a hp laptop with rtl8723de. After upgrading the kernel to 5.4, the WiFi stopped working. It was working fine till the kernel 4.15x. When I clone the rtl_wifi directory, it fails to make (screenshot attached).

I'm not sure how to properly gather relevant information for the report or if this is the appropriate repository. Please let me know if I'm posting on the wrong place.

Once I've upgraded to kernel 5.4.1 (from 5.3.13), the wireless is unusable. NetworkManager still finds the wireless interface, find access points, and connects to them. But the connection goes down and up so quickly and all the time that I'm unable to use it at all. Not sure what information I should gather for a proper report.

The issue persists on 5.4.2, 5.4.6 and 5.4.10.
Hello, first thanks for the great work on those drivers.

My kernel version : `Linux 5.4.5-arch1-1`

I try to use this card : `Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8192EE PCIe Wireless` 

Whenever I try to interact  with it , I get those cryptic kernel messages and it 'break' my built in NIC  `Intel Corporation I211 Gigabit Network Connection (rev 03)` )
The only workaround I have is to reboot at this point.
```

I've build the driver from this repository as explained in the README and the behavior stays the same.
I'm sure it's not an hardware issue because under Windows everything works find with the realtek driver.
 
Do you have any idea where should I start looking ?
Tests below conducted in an area with uncongested Wi-Fi channels and no bluetooth devices anywhere.
```
Driver is built with extra CFLAGS -> "-Ofast -frename-registers -mtune=native"
But you will get the same results with the defaults.
Driver is running with ips=1.

Tested on Linux 5.2 with RT patchset.

DMESG OUTPUT DURING TESTS:

Not very informative, huh? Let's retry the tests this time with the driver being more verbose. I'll also have Hostapd spit out what it's doing.
Driver now with ips=1 debug_level=5.

Well, dmesg didn't show anything new. Hostapd doesn't care about data, it just handles Wi-Fi protocol stuff.
Anyway, something interesting was that, despite the AP considering the signal strength as -18dBm, the phone only registers -33dBm. (short distance).
That may be due to high gain antennas on the AP improving reception, or just the transmission being weak? I don't know. 

The phone also reports the maximum speed of the link as 65Mbps at close range. During transmission, 8192ee claims to run at 300M bitrate (max)
I even enforced it with "sudo iwconfig wlp4s0 bit 300Mbps" after the first test

But the actual bandwidth ends up being a measly 700Kbits/sec, and the iperf3 server reports a bitrate of 1.23Mbits/sec.

Driver was from latest commit in rtlwifi_new extended branch.
Now, despite disabling Link Power Save on the driver increasing performance by a little bit, this should not be necessary, as it shows the implementation of lps is faulty.

Is there a way to have the driver be more verbose? Perhaps collecting more runtime information would lead to the cause of the issue. I'm interested in debugging this device for rtlwifi_new.

Hello

I've been using this driver (RTL8723DE) on Fedora 29 with kernels 4.x and Fedora 30 with kernels 5.0-5.2 very successfully. Today I installed Fedora 31 that comes with kernel 5.3.7, downloaded latest version of "rtlwifi_new" using git and tried to install as usually but does not work. Then upgraded all packages and new kernel is 5.3.15 but it still does not work. The driver compiles, installs and (aparently) loads (at boot time or with modprobe) with no errors or problems, but when starting KDE Plasma it simply does not detect any network, as if there was any wireless device available.

NOTE: Latest kernel on repositories is 5.3.15 (kernel and kernel-devel) BUT kernel-headers is 5.3.11 and THERE IS NO OTHER PACKAGE AVAILABLE. I don't know if the problem is the the version of the kernel-headers (different from kernel version) or the KDE network manager or some actualzation to the rtlwifi_new driver, the previous version I have does not compile and the latest version compiles but does not work.

By now I restored my old Fedora 30 backup to work while I can get my RTL8723DE working on Fedora 31, I have backup of Fedora 30 and 31 so I can restore a ready-to-use installation to try setting up rtlwifi_new again...

Any recommendation to discover if the problem is the kernel & kernel-headers version or the wifi driver or the KDE? Maybe a set of console commands (which ones) to check the status of the driver and the wifi hardware?

Thanks!
Whenever I install the driver and reboot my machine, after logging the screen get glitched and shows nothing but a black screen. I tried several times with a fresh install of the kali machine.

I am facing intermittent Bluetooth disconnection issue when connected to a bluetooth speaker, my Bluetooth speaker disconnects with error `wlp2s0: CTRL-EVENT-BEACON-LOSS`

also audio shutters when music played via andriod phone and getting this error in syslog `[pulseaudio] module-loopback.c: Too many underruns, increasing latency to 205.00 ms`

Is this my laptop's wifi/Bluetooth module hardware issue? or driver/ firmware issue ?

I have an **rtl8723de**, laptop: **hp 14q-cy0004au** have compiled driver from extended branch.

PC can connect to my personal hotspots just fine. which are WPA2 PSK or similar.

My university AP uses following config:
SSID: STUDENT
Encryption: WPA2-PEAP
Inner Authentication: MSCHAPV2

No module parameters changed. Signal is OK although not as strong as Ralink MT7601U adapter.

But Ralink adapter connects instantaneously while in case of rtl8723de driver only one dot of network manager widget turns green and other doesn't. And it times out.

I am quite new to linux and don't know how to get debug output for networkmanager. If someone tell how, I can provide debug output also.

Thanks..
