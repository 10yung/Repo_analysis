Fixes [#3703](https://github.com/wixtoolset/issues/issues/3703)

## WiX v3.x pull requests

Active development has now moved to [WiX v4][wix4].

Since there is no stable release version of Wix 4.x, I changed the sources in the 3.x repository, because hopefully there will be another stable version of Wix 3.x

Pull requests for WiX v3.x must be approved before they can be reviewed or accepted.

There are only a few lines of code which needs to be changed to fix this issue / implement this feature. It is now possible to change the "DisplayInternalUi" flag of each (MSI) package of a bootstrapper burn setup during the execution-process. So the end-user can decide to show the internal UI of a package durring installation and the developer must not provide two different bootstrapper setups (one with and one without GUI).

Implements https://github.com/wixtoolset/issues/issues/6026

Any feedback welcome on this PR.

A feature often requested that could be quite useful, e.g:
 * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39745742/how-to-launch-the-application-after-a-quiet-call-to-wix-burn-bootstrap
* http://windows-installer-xml-wix-toolset.687559.n2.nabble.com/How-to-force-to-launch-application-in-silent-install-mode-td4021727.html
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12823722/start-application-after-installation-using-wix-burn
 * https://github.com/vslavik/winsparkle/issues/132

If accepted, perhaps WiX4 would be a better place for it?

## Usage
### Within bootstrapper .wxs Bundle:
```
<Variable Name="AutoLaunch" bal:Overridable="yes" Type="numeric" Value="0" />
```
### When running bootstrapper:
```
BootstrapperInstaller.exe AutoLaunch=1
```

Auto-launching will **not** be performed if a restart is to be performed.
I have been playing with changing light's `OutputFile` and the console output did not quite match. I created a custom Property similar to `PdbOutputFile` so that console output always matches the `OutputFile`.
This imports the [1150 error](https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/commit/e8504c54e4cd186f676931e1d39a6e8400e575b8) error message into the documentation. I tried to follow local style for where in the xml this lives.
