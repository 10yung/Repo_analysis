## Question
<!-- You can ask any question about this project -->

[Rich mode](https://pouchcontainer.io/#/pouch/docs/features/pouch_with_rich_container.md) containers: Are they safe to run?

In docs it says:

> Also --privileged is required in this situation.

In docker environment `--privileged` container isn't considered as safe to run as root. So is it same in pouch containers? Or is it safe somehow? Or [runv](https://pouchcontainer.io/#/pouch/docs/features/pouch_with_runV.md) is the way to go for untrusted workloads?

**Rich mode** container is exactly what I was looking for. Please consider adding more realistic scenario in documentation instead of `sleep 10000`? such as running webserver and database on it.

Thank you.
## Why you need it?
<!-- Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe in details  -->

When I reboot my host machine, pouchd service doesn't start automatically. (Ubuntu)

## How it could be?
<!--A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. For a computer fan,  you can explain more about input of the feature, and output of it.-->

Ubuntu 16.04+ uses systemd as system process manager and actually installs one in `/usr/lib/systemd/system/pouch.service`. However I cannot enable it?

```bash
$ sudo systemctl enable pouch
Synchronizing state of pouch.service with SysV service script with /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
Executing: /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable pouch
update-rc.d: error: pouch Default-Start contains no runlevels, aborting.

## Why you need it?
<!-- Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe in details  -->
For ps command, I find the currently supported filters are: id, label, name, status. There are some filters, such as exited, network we also need to support.

## How it could be?
<!--A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. For a computer fan,  you can explain more about input of the feature, and output of it.-->
The exited filter matches containers by exist status code. For example, to filter fo containers that have exited successfully:
` $ pouch ps -a --filter 'exited=0'`

The network filter shows only containers that are connected to a network with a given name or id.
The following filter matches all containers that are connected to a network with a name containing net1.
 `$ pouch ps --filter network=net1`
The following example use the network id as a filter:
` $ pouch ps --filter network=8c0b4110`

## Question
<!-- You can ask any question about this project -->
I use the below command to start a local hub, and edit /etc/docker/daemon with insecure-registries option to disable https, when I use pouch pull command to get docker image, it shows "server gave http response to https clien". Is there anyway to disable https for pouch client?

docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name=registry --restart=always --privileged=true --log-driver=none -v /home/data:/home/data registry:latest
