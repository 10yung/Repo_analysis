I'd like to package a newer release than 0.1.0 and I'm not a fan of packaging git repos.

We've added a simple statsd metric reporting mechanism to our fork. It provides data to a statsd server as well as provides a per-instance, in memory JSON report locally. 

Would this be of interest for others? I can submit a PR or a separate branch that incorporates the code. 

Dear FiloSottile,

I followed your simple instructions, "Enter a URL or a hostname to test the server for CVE-2014-0160"

after typing in the URL or Host Name and I press GO it starts because you can see the blue line at the top of the screen build, but when it gets to the end it seems like it just stops or slows to a dead stop, not quite finished but there is no activity. So I ran it a few times checking the Website (URL) that I wanted to check, but no returns, no answers, nothing? Why is this happening and Please is there another way for me to check. Please help or am I doing something wrong?

Respectfully,
Randy

Hi there,

the website "as.takara-standard.co.jp" is vulnerable to heartbleed. Several online heartbleed scans are showing it vulnerable where as your GO program shows "ERROR"

I've been trying to test https://seap.asee.org/award to see if it is susceptible. The website doesn't seem to be working however. Each time I hit go, the progress bar at the top of the screen slowly creeps to the right for a few minutes before simply stopping when it's almost done. I'll wait 5 or so minutes with no result before trying again. It's not showing any errors however, it just isn't completing the task. I tried doing it on google.com, same thing. Tried the test positive (ec2-54-81-196-192.compute-1.amazonaws.com:4433) same thing.
I'm using a school computer with Internet Explorer 9.0.8112.16421. Thanks!

Hi all,

Getting error while testing heartbleed bug ???
here is the error:
dial tcp https://xxx.xxx.xx.x i/o timeout
dial tcp https://xxx.xxx.xx.x:443 i/o timeout
dial tcp xxx.xxx.xx.x:443 i/o timeout

Tried different ways but no succeed.Please help us to resolve issue..

Thank you

I'm getting a yellow (warning?) with the message "multiple Read calls return no data or error" when testing on my servers. 

This error is not mentioned anywhere and I haven't seen addressed anywhere.

When testing domain brandyourself.com I get the following error:

tls: server selected unsupported protocol version 300

The site only works with TLS v1.0

```
$ repos/heartbleed/bin/Heartbleed (a Cisco ASA)
2014/04/12 23:48:39 (my ASA) - ERROR: tls: failed to parse certificate from server: x509: negative serial number
```

Any idea what that is about?  The browser deals with it.  Chrome reports the serial as 2257982035.  It is a self-signed cert generated by the device, so I can imagine it's wrong, but I'm surprised at that.

Hi Fillipo,

Your program gives following output for this website.

$$ > bin/Heartbleed myprint-online.com:443
2014/04/11 23:36:42 myprint-online.com:443 - ERROR: write tcp 70.91.223.11:443: broken pipe

Whereas when i send the heartbit thru openssl it says the server cannot accept heartbit connection.

$ openssl s_client -connect myprint-online.com:443
