for persistently adding attributes to zoomed tables before computing a summary.
As it turns out, the assumption of single key columns is rather deeply rooted in the code. So far the function `dm_examine_constraints()` works as it should, but tests fail, since helper functions have been adapted, which now produce the wrong type for key-column -info-tibbles.

closes #239
Using zoomed table as `start`.

Other functions where this pattern makes sense?
change some of the function names and update naming vignette

closes #238 
`dm_examine_constraints()` should return a list in the `column` column. Can we keep `dm_check_constraints()` as is?
because they throw an error.

If a function returns invisibly and throws an error, it should be named `check_*()`.

- [x] `check_cardinality_*_*()` (but keep `examine_cardinality()`)
- [x] `check_if_subset()` (inconsistent name, maybe `check_subset()`)?
- [x] `check_key()`
which can be examined or learned.
for zoomed dm.
from `cdm_()` API to `dm_()`.

Take a `cdm_()` based demo from an older version, document what needs to change to make it work with the new API.
For functions that return a data frame we need to check if the output column names make sense.
