Can I use this gem inside controller  ? If not can I pull configuration form database and initialize chatbot ? Can I create separate webhooks for each pages ? Any guide lines ??
This gem recommends using `require_dependency` in the [initializer to set up bot reloading in development](https://github.com/jgorset/facebook-messenger#-on-rails) but those should be removed [according to the rails 6 upgrade guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#autoloading) using the Zeitwerk autoloader. 

It seems to me that maybe only `config.autoload_paths` is needed nowadays, so maybe we should update the Readme?


Hi,

I am using this Ruby client code for FB messenger since months

One of my customer asked me to develop a bot on Workplace by Facebook.

Is it still possible to use this GEM ? Is is compatible with Workplace bots for Messenger ?

Here below the code error i got when i try to run my usual bot code ?

Thank you

Hi, I'm trying to get the event when the developer/tester/admin click on the messenger plugin to start chat chat
these are the selected event with my app:

Selected events:Â `messages, messaging_postbacks, messaging_optins `

from these 3 events, two are working perfectly.   but `messaging_optins ` isn't working. 

https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/reference/webhook-events/messaging_optins

from that link above it is mentioned:

> This callback will occur when the send to Messenger plugin has been tapped, a user has accepted a message request using customer matching, or a user has opted in to receive messages via the checkbox plugin. 


I'm tapping on the start chat button with different developer account. but everytime it fails to send me the webhook for this. 

Can you guys please help me on that? 
Does this gem support Broadcast API?
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/broadcast-messages
Since this gem creates a new message object different from the incoming payload, I was wondering whether anybody had thoughts on best way to integrate with bot analytics vendors? 

Below is the json data that needs to be passed to typical vendors like dashbot.io via REST.

Hi 

Are you going to build "Account Linking" (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/account-linking/v2.9) into this gem ?

Cheers

Hi

As per the Facebook Messenger documentation (https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2016/06/16/page-level-rate-limits/), the response header contains additional information:

> The values for call_count, total_cputime and total_time are whole numbers representing the percentage used values for each of the metrics.

Is there any way of accessing these header values using this gem?

Thanks,
Sridhar
