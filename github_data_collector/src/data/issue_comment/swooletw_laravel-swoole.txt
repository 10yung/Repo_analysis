Hi,
this is more question than the issue.
I'm using PHP 7.3.8, Laravel 6.5, and Swoole 4.4.12 on my local MacMini. Everything is fine and working as it should.

Anyway, big part of development is deployment.
I'm currently using AWS ElasticBeanstalk, so my question is:
How to enable swoole extension on AWS EB and how to run it, (I'm guessing you can't do `php artisan swoole:http start`. I tried to find some documentation on it, but with no luck.

Sorry for bothering you with a non-issue issue.
Thanks
error:
Swoole\Server::task(): task method can't be executed without task worker

”ps -ef | grep swoole“  no task process found




Hi,
I know that this is not an issue, but I am afraid this is the only place I can get information. Please clarify the following, may be a good idea to also detail this in the documentation.

I roughly understand the concept of workers and sandbox. However, it is unclear for me that how exactly Laravel exists in these workers, how do they share the traffic. I have read that these workers do not share data, however, the sandbox container is required to avoid unexpected behavior. This means that there are a given number of workers which do not know about each other, but each serves many clients and these clients' data would mix up without sandbox? Moreover, the pre resolved instances are resolved one time for each worker, not once totally? 

Let me explain my specific problem. I am working with websockets, some events (actions) which the client triggers may (not everytime) require a confirmation. In this case, I would like to store a callable at server side, which executes the complete action after confirmation is received. So among others, there would be no need to send the data again. Clearly, the question is data sharing. As I cannot store a callable in Swoole Table, I thought of using a pre resolved class, which may not be possible if the above is correct - but I'm not sure. 

Thanks and in advance.
Swoole Response can support methods  “Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\BinaryFileResponse::deleteFileAfterSend” ?  If yes, that's good
