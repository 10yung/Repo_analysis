Using the built-in macOS L2TP client with "Send all traffic over VPN connection" enabled, I'm seeing that all traffic still goes through the local network. I even tried using the "Set service order" menu to position the VPN above the hardware interfaces, but it makes no difference.

@nodesocket reported a similar issue in bug #652: macOS Catalina connects but no traffic routing through tunnel -- sha2-truncbug 

However, @hwdsl2 replied that the bug was fixed, and my installation includes the fix ("sha2-truncbug=no"). 

Is anyone else experiencing this, and is there a known workaround? Otherwise I will file a bug with Apple.

P.S. the VPN is working fine with iOS and older Mac clients. It is running on Ubuntu 18.04.3, if that makes any difference.

Thanks!

Since there is an increasing need to set up a VPN in the traditional Chinese language area. I want to translate this guide to traditional Chinese as well. 

What I have done:
- Added traditional Chinese translation of README
- Slightly edited other language README for adding a link to traditional Chinese page
- Modified the README files' name for better clarity

I will further work on other pages, such as the client setting.
Add how to solve **can not connect to...**, After input user name and password.

The problem related to error code 720.
[An aside: many,  _many_ thanks for launching this project and delivering this software and documentation; we find it tremendously helpful. We greatly appreciate the efforts by all the contributors.]

**Question: _is there some existing software, even if it's an individual's simple script utility or similar, which automates the vpn-client connection/disconnect (and the associated error handling) including after client-system reboot?_**

Our vpn-client-side OS = Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS.

Details:

The "needs to be run every time one makes a VPN-client-connection" section of the ["Configure Linux VPN clients using the command line" procedure](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients.md#configure-linux-vpn-clients-using-the-command-line) is too complex for a human to execute every time. My team will need to write a script (or some such) to automate it, but we would like to avoid this. We are fine with the one-time installation/configuration effort, even if we have to write a script for that--although we'd like to find some client automation which handles this, too.

Does not strongSwan or some similar package provide automation to perform the disconnection/reconnection?  (Initial searches have not found anything, but I'm far from perofmring a comprehensive search. I thought it best to ask here first to see if someone's already been down this path, before I spend much more time searching.)

Our vpn client environment in this case are headless VPS machines where it's difficult to setup or at least use a GUI interface. Further, we want to be able to auto-deploy these types of systems with command-line automation (with a configuration-management/auto-deployment tool like Ansible) on a mass scale (ie, a large number of these Ubuntu 18.04.2 machines), which makes it difficult if not impossible to run a gui.

I've also done some searches (again: _not_ comprehensive in any way) through the [issues archive for this project](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/issues) but have not yet found anything. 

Thanks for any help/tips/pointers.
