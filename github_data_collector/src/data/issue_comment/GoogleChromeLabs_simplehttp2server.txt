Trying to use simplehttp2server as a development server to conduct Lighthouse testing. It is not working because the server is setting content-type for javascript files to 'text/plain' rather than â€‹'application/javascript'. As a result, the service worker fails to load. How could this issue be resolved?
Hi,

I've redone [extglob.go](https://github.com/ncruces/appengine-hosting/blob/master/extglob.go) from scratch, lifted a bunch of tests from [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch).

Only major inaccuracy left (vs. bash), is handling of `dotglob` (mine/yours matches hidden files by default).

Are you guys interested? If so, I can either contribute, or spin this into its own package.
Haven't done so yet because this is really my first golang effort.

Also planning to implement [captures](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/full-config#redirects) next.
Seeing this for push streams is interesting.
