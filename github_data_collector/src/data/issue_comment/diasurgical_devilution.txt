Not bin exact, but should implement all the logic
UseItem still isn't bin exact, but it didn't make much sens not to add the part that makes oils usable.
- `infostr` size has been corrected to be 256 instead of 260, consistent with MAC/PSX
- `dArch` has been renamed to `dSpecial`, implied by its usage in similar named functions
- added bugfix note to CheckUnique not properly spawning uniques with multiple bases
- added bugfix note to PlaceGroup adding X scrambler to Y instead of the Y scrambler
- the unused variables for screen size have been corrected, mac showed they lined up with psx
- corrected variable name `dwRecCount`, implied `packets received counter`

*side note* `ViewDX/Y` probably means `View dungeon/view dimension` and `ViewBX/Y` means `View blocks`
`dwRecCount` is not used for anything, implying it was likely a debug feature added later to track number of packets being recieved, would be cool to implement this


The only meaning full change here is the do-while. The rest is probably nop and a bit odd.
I think this solves most of the bool types, but I haven't looked at the handling of return values from functions that return `bool`, fully checking types of values given as a parameter, or functions that are passed as parameters.

There are probably still a lot of `NULL` that are set as `0`, I just happened to spot one when going over things.

Probably there are still more enums that haven't been fully applied.

P.s. CLang isn't happy about this and I have some diff to sort out:

haven't figured out how to make them bin exact in vanilla and hellfire with same code : P
my bad, forgot how to do hellfire xD
Note, this has a considerable slowdown when compiling
using VC++. On my laptop a 3x slowdown. On @galaxyhaxz
perhaps even more. This is counterintuitive, but the
stats don't lie.

With split headers (i.e. only import what's used)

	$ time make -f MakefileVC -j 4
	real 30.50
	user 22.96
	sys 4.87

Without merged headers (i.e. import 'all.h')

	$ time make -f MakefileVC -j 4
	real 10.50
	user 6.94
	sys 2.09
