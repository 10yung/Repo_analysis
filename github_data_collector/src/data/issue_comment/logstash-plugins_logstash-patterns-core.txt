I finally got the parsing to work but im trying to put it in the conf file for logstash.

I get two cisco asa messages and therefore have to filters, how do  get it to filter the messages? Its supposed to filter Cisco ASA 106023 and 106100 messages

[Logstash conf.txt](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/files/3935090/Logstash.conf.txt)

I have attached the conf file. if anyone knows how to fix it please let me know.

With the default error log message for Apache/2.4.6 (CentOS) - when bumping up trace levels ... the LOGLEVEL pattern, which results in `_grokparsefailure`

Local part for email addresses can start with numbers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address

It can actually contain any combination but realistically, it be an alphanumeric character.

Hi,
Sometimes clientip is -.

Logstash 7.3
OS: All
Logstash direct input plugins such as tcp, udp, syslog, etc. create events with the field "host" populated incorrectly. To conform to ECS the host name should be placed into "host.name". It would be useful if the plugins could also populate other fields like "host.ip". 

Arguably it should populate "agent" fields as well since logstash is acting as the agent.

Thanks for contributing to Logstash! If you haven't already signed our CLA, here's a handy link: https://www.elastic.co/contributor-agreement/

Update patterns to more recent versions of log files.

I need a little help to do an end-to-end test with this using the [docker ELK stack](https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk). Specifically, I'm not sure how to build/install this plugin to that stack.

I'm not sure if we need to maintain backwards compatibility - pretty sure this PR will break for old versions.

There are a bunch of examples for ELB logs in the AWS docs. This PR only tests the "https" one, I have no idea if the other examples will work 🤷‍♂ 

I noticed that the SPACE grok pattern is currently set to:

> SPACE \s*

If it is meant to match whitespace, shouldn't it have a starting point where it matches at least one character?  Something like:

> SPACE \s+

I've ran into a situation where this pattern was skipped because it allows matching zero spaces.
Hi,

Log format was changed at Tomcat 9. Sample logs are under followings.

26-Apr-2019 14:05:48.484 INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.VersionLoggerListener.log Server version name:   Apache Tomcat/9.0.19
26-Apr-2019 14:05:48.485 INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.VersionLoggerListener.log Server built:          Apr 12 2019 14:22:48 UTC
26-Apr-2019 14:05:48.485 INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.VersionLoggerListener.log Server version number: 9.0.19.0
26-Apr-2019 14:05:48.485 INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.VersionLoggerListener.log OS Name:               Linux


Attached patch can support the new log format.

regards,
The `HTTPD_COMBINEDLOG` pattern creates a `agent` field which conflicts with [the `agent` field of ECS 1.0](https://github.com/elastic/ecs/blob/1.0/fields.yml#L8).
