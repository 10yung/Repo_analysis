#### Issue Summary

Email always return 400 when there's no customization object set. 

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Use latest release
2. Click on send button (in my script)
3. Viola! Error occurred.

Since i haven't add any customization object in the array, it shouldn't report 
`{"errors":[{"message":"The to email parameter is required.","field":"personalizations.0.to.0.email","help":"http://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Mail/errors.html#message.personalizations.to"}
`
I've tried to remove the personalizations, or hardcode the to address, but still received the error.

The function code is pasted below:
```
public function send($to_address, $subject_raw, $text, $files)
    {
        $from = new From($this->sender, $this->name);
        $subject = $subject_raw;
        $to = new To(null, $to_address);
        $content = new Content('text/html', $text);
        $mail = new Mail($from, $to, $subject, $content);	
		
		$mail->addTo($to);
		$mail->setSubject($subject);
		$mail->addContent($content);
		$content = new Content("text/html", $text);		   
        $mail->addContent($content);
		
        foreach ($files as $file) {
            $attachment = new Attachment();
            $attachment->setContent(base64_encode(file_get_contents($file)));
            $attachment->setType('application/octet-stream');
            $attachment->setFilename(basename($file));
            $attachment->setDisposition('attachment');
            $attachment->setContentId('backup');
            $mail->addAttachment($attachment);
        }
    	
		//$reply_to = new ReplyTo("test@example.com", "Optional Name");
        //$mail->setReplyTo($reply_to);		

		try {
        	$response = $this->sg->client->mail()->send()->post($mail);    
			print $response->statusCode() . "\n"; 
    		print_r($response->headers());
    		print $response->body() . "\n"; // Twilio SendGrid specific errors are found here
		} catch (Exception $e) {
    		echo 'Caught exception: ',  $e->getMessage(), "\n";
		}
    }
```

Hi,
I am new to sendgrid v3 API. I am able to send simple email using version 5.6.0, but I am not getting the same result sending a simple email using version 6.1.0. And, for the future, how can I add a CSV file as an attachment on the same e-mail?? Please help me out to resolve my issue.

Thanking you in advance.

#### Issue Summary

Sending email to an email address which has unicode characters in local part (example: `françois@domain.tld`) results in an error using the `sendgrid-php` library.

#### Steps to Reproduce
```
...
$email = new \SendGrid\Mail\Mail();
$email->setSubject('My Subject');
$email->addTo('françois@domain.tld');
...
```
results in
```
PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught SendGrid\Mail\TypeException: $emailAddress must be valid and of type string. in ...
#0 .../vendor/sendgrid/sendgrid/lib/mail/EmailAddress.php(51): SendGrid\Mail\EmailAddress->setEmailAddress('fran\xC3\xA7ois...')
...
```
This is triggered by
https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/blob/f64b6fda6d6253e1b2e1bd630764bead31009496/lib/mail/EmailAddress.php#L74
PHP allows an additional flag `FILTER_FLAG_EMAIL_UNICODE` to `filter_var()` when used with `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` to allow unicode in the local part of an email address (the part before the `@`).  Unless there is a particularly good reason to block this here, a simple change is needed on the above referenced line:
```filter_var($emailAddress, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL, FILTER_FLAG_EMAIL_UNICODE)```

Currently I try to improve PHPDoc on this library (branch master) - due to the missing `@throws TypeException` parts.

In SendGrid.php some parameters don't have the proper PHPDoc types, which make it hard to calculate methods (using PhpStorm) in tests. Is there a reason the next changes aren't allowed?

```php
use SendGrid\Client;
use SendGrid\Mail\Mail;
use SendGrid\Response;
```
and
```php
    /** @var string Namespace */
    protected $namespace = 'SendGrid';

    /** @var Client Client */
    public $client;
    /** @var string Version */
    public $version = self::VERSION;
```

(next question)

According to [this](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/issues/874) issue and absence of `DynamicTemplateData` class, I think type hints for `DynamicTemplateData` may be changed. Can these be replaced safely by `Substitution`?

That's it for now!
#### Issue Summary

I have just upgraded my integration code to use the latest 7.x branch of this library.  I am getting the error 401 Missing JSON Body when I try to send my messages, I have confirmed in the library Client::createCurlOptions() that the $encodedBody is non-empty JSON.  Can you help me know where to look for this issue.

#### Technical details:

* sendgrid-php Version: 7.3.0 from packagist.org
* PHP Version: 5.6 (as of May 17, 2018)

We're using the library to send a single template, with substitutions, to many recipients. They should not get each other's information thus we don't want a single email with everyone in the To/Cc field. We've used v5 of the library with success, however, since v7 of the library there's a bug in the usage of the `Personalization` object. We had to change our implementation due to this and made a mistake in this change which has caused a data leak of our customers.

We now found a safe way to do this in v7, but this is not a very common way and most other ways to do this leak data or don't send a correct email.

There's a few different methods we know of:

1. Using `Mail->addPersonalization()` (see https://gist.github.com/lode/1daed164c0d5897be4ff8a1feadb0ce0#file-1-md)
   > We were using this and it seems the most nice way. However since v7 this causes exceptions (maybe also v6, didn't test that), see https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/issues/882.
2. Using `Mail->addTo()` with `To->setSubstitutions()` (see https://gist.github.com/lode/1daed164c0d5897be4ff8a1feadb0ce0#file-2-md)
   > We used this as a replacement in v7. We thought using the substitutions would cause the library or the API to split it into multiple recipients. However this caused a single email to multiple recipients in the To-header and only the last recipient's substitution added to be used.
3. Using `Mail->addBcc()` with `Bcc->setSubstitutions()` (see https://gist.github.com/lode/1daed164c0d5897be4ff8a1feadb0ce0#file-3-md)
   > We tested this as well as a replacement for 2. This resulted in a single email with everyone in the bcc (that's good) but the substitutions were completely ignored (that's bad).
4. Using `Mail->addPersonalization()` but using `Mail->addTo()` with `To->setSubstitutions()` for the first recipient (see https://gist.github.com/lode/1daed164c0d5897be4ff8a1feadb0ce0#file-4-md)
   > This is the variant we're using right now and it seems to fix the bug of 1. However, it feels really weird to use it like this and makes for hard to read code.
5. Using a custom generated json blob to talk to the API (see https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/blob/master/examples/mail/mail.php#L39)
   > We never tried this, but it is adviced by @thinkingserious in https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/issues/849#issuecomment-501798232 as a work around for the bug of 1. It is very error prone though. And as it completely ignores the library, we could just as well do an own Guzzle call.
6. Sending separate emails.
   > While obvisouly theoretically a working solution, it costs both us and SendGrid performance and bandwidth.

A fix for the bug in 1 was made in https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/pull/705 half a year ago. However, no release has been issued since.

It would be great if we can get a release ASAP for this fix.

Next to that the usage patterns of 2 and 3 should be improved. Either the library should actually use different personalizations including correct substitutions. Or it should thrown an exception when trying to use substitutions for the `addTo()`/`addBcc()` methods.

I think on top the library could be improved in its architecture and coding standards. I've been diving into the code a little and find it very hard to find out what actually happens when using these different methods. Like how and when the Personalization objects are created. Right now the only way to discover the outcome is to adjust the API host and test the output of the API call. Cumbersome at least. Also it seems nowhere are there any checks on data integrety, causing the issues of 2 and 3. If this is all improved, I'd love to be able to call a method like `Mail->willUseSeparateEmailsForAllRecipients()` to verify that our usage is correct in automated processes and unit tests.

The data leak we had is our own fault. But it would help a lot if the library is less buggy and has more safe guards to do things right. This unclarity of how to do it properly is affecting multiple customers, see https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/issues/568, https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/issues/629, https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/issues/686, https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/issues/849, https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/issues/856#issuecomment-559561953, https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/issues/882.

I love to hear and help out where possible!

#### Issue Summary

What would be the best way to get Contact ID after insertion? In my case Contact is in my database and I need to update the Sendgrid Contact ID field for further use.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Insert Contact using API and PUT. (/contacts)
2. Search for Contact if contains email. (/contacts/search)

What method should be used instead of the previous step 1 and 2.
