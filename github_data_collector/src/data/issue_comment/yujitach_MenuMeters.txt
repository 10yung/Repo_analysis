on my i5-8400 6 cores, when cpu runs at 100%  via
`for i in {1..10} ; do yes > /dev/null & ; done`
- [ x ] `the average of all cores` is always showing 83%, **NOT Correct**
- [ x ] `the sum of all cores` is always showing 500%, **NOT Correct**
- [ âˆš ] the rest 3 options are ok, they show correct 6 "100%"s, **Correct**

so i think the calculation of core was not correct, version 2.0.4
I got the following email message:

> I have several active network adapters on my system and I would love to display the amount
of activity on them. It would be great to be able to display a selection of several adapters instead of just one.

It might be indeed useful to show the sum and/or the individual data for multiple adapters.
I often get requests for a Battery meter. One email request says:

> Since mac switch to USB-C charging the ways to charge mobile mac increase dramatically, but not all power supplies are equal, some give a lot less power than others.
Yet the gage from macOS only can say that Power Source is AC, but would not provide the Wattage. I can find current wattage from System Profile > Power > AC Power Information > Wattage, but it would be way better in for example CPU drop down of MM would have a line for that. 
I got the following request in an email:

> Recent changes in Mac file system break disks into numerous virtual disks, thus it would be awesome if there were an option to join them into one, similar to how CPU core can be combined. 
MenuMeters version: 2.0.4

CPU for this model is Core i7 4771 (Haswell)
Similar to what was requested and implemented for the network.
It would be amazing to have a unified (or at least the startup disk) read/write speed + option to have it for each disk at the dialog where each disk info is shown being shown and updated in real time.

I wish I knew some Objetive-C to play around and try to do it by myself but i'm a javascript boy ðŸ˜ž 
Currently it's possible to choose between:
* `Peek traffic` (which I assume refers to the highest value during time graph was active) - which isn't ideal as not always we transmit with the maximum speed so It's hard to get whether we utilize our network connection to the full potential at a single glance, or
* `Interface speed` - which isn't ideal as well -- if we consider that we may have internet connection of 20Mbps but connect to it over 300Mbps WiFI then we would hardly see any graph.

Ideally we should be able to set the maximum to fixed value (entered manually, which would related to our internet speed).
Hi,
I'm missing an option / a preference item to replace the automatic search for available updates by an manually triggered check for updates.
Thx a lot for that and best Regards
I was asked in an email that there are too many updates since v2.0.0 was out ...
I got an email request with the following nice picture:

> The same for Memory usage part..

That's quite reasonable, but in a certain very high-speed systems all the width is necessary, as in #123 . Maybe I need to make Meters to adjust itself dynamically, which might also be distractive. Hmm.
