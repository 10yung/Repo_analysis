Finally testing out `dataspice` and it is awesome! I noticed that the distribution section isn't displayed in the built site, however. It would be nice if it did! I know this package isn't under super active development but I thought I'd just add the issue in case anyone has time/interest to have a look
A colleague wanted to convert their dataspice to an EML 2.1.1 XML doc today but we couldn't figure it out without a few lines of code:

```r
json <- jsonlite::read_json("mydataspice.json")
eml <- emld::as_emld(json)
emld::as_xml(eml)
```

Do we have this already in dataspice and I just missed it? If not, would it be reasonable and useful to have a function to do this? We could include `emld` as a soft dependency and wrap the above code (or similar) in a single function.
All works smoothly until `build_site()` throwing this error:

```
build_site(path = "hour_data_all/metadata")
Error in parse_con(txt, bigint_as_char) : parse error: premature EOF
                                       
                     (right here) ------^
```
Any idea how to fix?
It would be really great if we could produce [Roxygen documentation for data](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/data.html) from `dataspice` metadata
Hi folks - I wanted to introduce a project I'm a part of, including sharing some work a few members have been doing with dataspice! We'd love to think about coordinating efforts with you.

[Psych-DS](psych-ds.github.io) is an in-progress technical specification for datasets in psychology, which uses Schema.org compliant metadata. We began this project as a conference hackathon this summer, and since then have been hashing out the specification and simultaneously coming to learn who all else is working on related projects (including Frictionless Data, and now thanks to your issue #71, DataCrate!).  Eventually we hope Psych-DS will support specific subfields to converge on more standard ways of representing particular kinds of data, but have realized that getting social scientists on a shared technical footing & ensuring discoverability is a big deal! The project is heavily inspired by [BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/) for neuroimaging data.

We are currently in the stage of wrapping up the draft of the written technical specification and beginning to 'road test' it on some real datasets. Beyond creating dataset-level metadata we are attempting to enforce some basic folder organization, file formatting/naming, and well-structured documentation of variables. ([Here's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u8o5jnWk0Iqp_J06PTu5NjBfVsdoPbBhstht6W0fFp0/edit#) a direct link to the long-form specification doc.)

At the same time, some intrepid coders started working on some standalone R-Shiny apps designed to produce this kind of output. In particular, Erin Buchanan (@doomlab) forked dataspice a while ago to try and tinker with it, and has been working with undergrads to write a tutorial that's appropriate for people who haven't used R before to approach a tool like dataspice. 

Here is Erin's update: "We took the structure of dataspice – a grouping of shiny apps that one interacted with using RStudio – and converted it into one Shiny app that is published to the web for anyone to use. The app auto builds the CSV structured files from an uploaded dataset and then allows the user to step through entering the information for the access, attributes, bibliography, and creators files.  Here, we fixed a couple typos and other issues that was prohibiting dataspice from being fully functioning and added more detailed instructions. The app still allows users to “write spice” and create a schema.org compliant JSON file and HTML report with some CSS tweaks."

Erin will have more details on the structure of [the version she's been working on](https://github.com/doomlab/data-dictionary/tree/master/dataschema), and we'd love to talk about ways to join forces or coordinate.  In particular, would it make sense to open some issues to merge back Erin's work, or is there a better way to start out than that? If it makes sense, we can put out a call to the Psych-DS mailing list to see if we have some extra hands to help. 

Also, if anyone has time to take a look, we'd love to know if you have any feedback on how Psych-DS could work more smoothly with apps like dataspice, or if you see anything we haven't considered that might cause conflicts.

Thanks all!

- Melissa & Erin

Hi,

I just became aware of this project, which looks very promising.

We have been working on a similar effort to package research data with schema.org json, also with an HTML file, the [DataCrate](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/datacrate/blob/master/spec/1.0/data_crate_specification_v1.0.md) spec. Looks like the JSON-LD we're producing with various tools (all of which are still in alpha) is quite similar to that here.

Anyway, I think we should look at aligning our efforts. Will anyone from this project be at the [Research Object meeting on October 29 in Amsterdam](http://www.researchobject.org/ro2018/)? - I will.


Hey dataspicers,

I wrote up a set of 4 functions (+ helpers) to convert EML to dataspice formats: https://github.com/isteves/emlspice.  I'd be happy to merge it into dataspice if you all think it's appropriate.  In any case, it would be great to get some feedback!  @amoeba @cboettig

This comes from a good question in my `dataspice` demo today: If user X authors a `dataspice` page for their dataset, and another scientist, Y, wants to use it, it'd be cool if they just ran:

```r
import_spice("https://amoeba.github.io/some-dataset")
```

And their computer downloaded something like `some-dataset.zip` which had the `dataspice.json` and the files described in `access.csv` attached to it somehow.
Had a great question in my dataspice demo at NCEAS today that dovetailed with something we had talked about at the unconf. What if we output to Rmd or md and the scientist could make use of that as they want. The Rmd/md could be converted to HTML still but the intermediate format would be of greater utility to the user.

Also had a suggestion for converting to Word or Google Docs in some form. The comment also pointed out that a lot of scientists (ours include) use Drive as a storage location over GitHub so being able to work with `dataspice` in a Google Drive workflow would be useful (making HTML output less useful).
