Starting with version 16.0.0, Joi no longer accepts undefined as a default value, i.e. 

```js
const schema = Joi.string().default(undefined);
```

#### What was the result you got?
A `Missing default value` exception.

#### What result did you expect?
The default being ignored as was before resulting on the value/field remaining undefined when not specified. 

This is unfortunate because one can no longer directly use default values that may or may not legitimately be `undefined` at runtime, e.g. an environment variable.

The explicit description of what behavior to expect of `default(undefined)` has been removed from the API docs in an [unrelated commit](https://github.com/hapijs/joi/commit/8febd3f8d1eb2802e90c8cd21770d80de6e0bb3f#diff-88333ba11114e014e87198d04680144dL701) related to #1867, however I can't find any mention of it in the breaking changes list for v16.0.0.
