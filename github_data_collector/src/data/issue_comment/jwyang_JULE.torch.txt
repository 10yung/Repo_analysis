  @jwyang hi, when i try to use this file deep_seminmf_nonlinear.m.    I found it fail to run  due to missing function deep_recon(). Could you help me with this problem? thx. 
I have spent one day on configuring the environment for your torch code, when i go to the last step, i.e., install lua-knn, it failed. What's the problem? I'm so tired.
Do you have the  dataset YTF? Could you privide it for me if you had?Thanks!
Hi,
Thank you for the code. I had a doubt regarding the Affinity function used in the reformulated loss(eq 11). From what I understand, after computing the triplets by [**organize_samples()** ](https://github.com/jwyang/JULE.torch/blob/master/train.lua#L424) function, they are fed to the [**criterion_triplet**](https://github.com/jwyang/JULE.torch/blob/master/train.lua#L427) to get the loss.
In **TripletEmbedding.lua** are the Affinities( **A(xi,xj)** and **A(xi,xk)** in eq(11)) represented by **delta_pos** and **delta_net** ?

I am a bit confused because I could not see the actual Affinity function(calculated in the **agg_clustering.c** and as mentioned Graph Degree Linkage paper[68]) to be used while calculating the loss.

Thanks.
Hi, 

I see that in the organize_samples function, you are using trainingData_labels. Should I pass arbitrary value if I don't have labels?

If we want to use this package but not using GPU drivers, what's the best solution?

The lua-knn package is specifically for GPU, and the only other package I found is https://github.com/rlowrance/kernel-smoothers which I have not been able to figure out how to "install" -- the makefile just looks like a test suite, and it's not included in luarocks despite being referred to by the [official docs](https://github.com/torch/torch7/wiki/Cheatsheet).

Best option I can think of right now is to code the knn myself.
https://github.com/jwyang/JULE.torch/blob/d43251d93aba8c00b716c62d6d5d6c34ee29bcb9/agg_clustering_c/agg_clustering.c#L78

In the lines 65-68 (agg_clustering.c file), you first get the length of  cluster i and cluster j, which are saved in Y_i_size, Y_j_size, respectively. But I am confused that you use THTensor_(get2d)(Y, j, n) - 1 to call the element Y[j,n], in which the maximum of n is Y_j_size, but the column size of Y is Y->size[1]. 
There is only class in my clustering result   when I run my data（4 classes).

 It is an urgent question. Please help me as soon as possible. 

Thank you! I look forward to your reply as soon as possible！

Thank you！
Hi, I find this paper to be very interesting, Im part of a research program at the University of Barcelona and we want to try this network for Egocentric vision, we have our dataset in a folder structure were each folder represents a category, in our case daily activities.
I have no experience working with hd5f files, can you please help me with the code to create the h5 file? 
Also do you think that JULE will work with egocentric vision?

Thank you for your time and good work
Ｈow can I use your trained model to extract image(my dataset) features　ａｎｄ　then save them for further clustering？ 
Thank you in advance for the answer
