dear maintainer(s), 
i tried to install the bot on a fresh and updated raspbian stretch but ran into an issue i couldn´t fix (https://twitter.com/luebbermann/status/998240554097012737). a nice fellow on twitter pointed me to the fact that besides ruby2.3 (which was already installed) also ruby-dev is needed. so i´m asking to give that information "requires ruby-dev" in the readme section to avoid that problem for other users. thanks! 
When running the bot via `ebooks start`, about half the screen real estate gets wasted by these `Building: sentence 0 of 986` lines. This fixes that.
Before, the keyword function would leave in http and https. They were in the stopwords file, but they were never on their own-- just as part of a URL. This is a little inelegant, but it fixes the problem. 
Not sure if it requires more changes on the Twitter API end but, maybe this will add to the character limit. 

Since twitter allows to write 140 characters even if the tweet includes a photo, tweet quote or mention to users, the api by default sends a shortened version of the tweet so that it only contains 140 characters, and that is not something desirable for us because it removes some words.
I am running ebooks in production server, using 

`ebooks start &`

But If I am killing the pid, ebooks starts new process automatically. I cant able to kill the process completely. 
Is it any way to forbid specific words?
The bot always worked, until I updated it today. Not sure what caused it but somewhere in the period of now and 6 months (last time of restart) something changed preventing it from logging in. Before the restart it went just fine so the keys did not expire

Any idea?

When running `ebooks archive` on Supervisor, it can't find my `.ebooksrc` and thinks it's the first time running. How can I provide it my `.ebooksrc`?
