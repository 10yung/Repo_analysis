Hello,

I encounter a problem when I want to activate mass alerts on financial and administrative information

To reproduce the problem:

Go to: Park -> Computer -> Select 1 or more computer -> Actions -> Select "Activate financial and administrative information"

And popup with error: Operation failed
(0 rights issues, 1 failures)
N / A: Unable to retrieve the item

On the other hand if I go directly in the form of the computer, I can activate the parameter.

I have about 200 activated and the mass operation would be simpler.
I tried to deactivate all the plugins but I have the same problem.

GLPI version: 9.4.5

If you need more information don't hesitate;)

Thank you
Hello
I try to display all Project Tasks using the request **[ServeurName]/apirest.php/search/ProjectTask**
This returns only Project Tasks for which the user (defined for the "user token" request) is a team member of the task team.

![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55400519/72600807-9d55da80-3914-11ea-88d0-96f9ec8940c0.JPG)

_In this example, I use the **MyUserName** "User Token" in my request. It returns only Project tasks where **MyUserName** is defined as member of the task team._

How can I retreive all Project Tasks from all projects (even if my user is not member of the task team) ?

What I tried :
- same request with root "user token" : NOK
- applying super-admin rights to **MyUserName** account : NOK
- connecting to GLPI web interface with **MyUserName** account : it works, I can list/access projects, project tasks, ...

Thanks for your help

**Your GLPI setup (you can find it in Setup > General menu, System tab)**

```

GLPI 9.4.5
--


```

**Additional context**

I found the solution.
Modify inc/search.class.php:7616.
Change "like" to "like binary".
And It works.

I am creating a script that has the function of opening a ticket automatically and a new request that came up was "add a document (.txt, .pdf ..) to the ticket created by the script"
Therefore, when using a script to add a document to glpi, part of the code:

```
$document = array('name' => 'newtest', 'path' => '/var/www/html/glpi/g/test/8_VOLUME I - 01-2601.00170-0000-2014.pdf', 'type' => 'pdf', 'name_ext' => '8_VOLUME I - 01-2601.00170-0000-2014.pdf');
$headers = array(
        'Content-Type: multipart/form-data',
        'App-Token: ' . $app_token,
        'Session-Token: ' . $sess_token
    );
$uploadManifest = json_encode(array(
 'input' => array(
  'name' => $document['name'],
  '_filename' => $document['name_ext'],
 ),
));
$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH, CURLAUTH_ANY);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLINFO_HEADER_OUT, 1);
curl_setopt_array($ch, array(
 CURLOPT_URL => "http://xxxxxxxxx/apirest.php/Ticket/2019059731/Document_Item/",
 CURLOPT_POST => 1,
 CURLOPT_HEADER => 1,
 CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => array(
  'uploadManifest' => $uploadManifest,
    'filename[0]' => new CURLFile($document['path'], $document['type'], $document['name_ext']),
 ),
));
```
The code itself, it works and adds the document to glpi (without being linked to any ticket or anything), so to make it 'pegged' to a ticket, I added the ticket url stating the id , in this part of the code:
```
curl_setopt_array($ch, array(
 CURLOPT_URL => "http://xxxxxxxxx/apirest.php/Ticket/2019059731/Document_Item/",
```

And the feedback I get from this is:

Does anyone have any solution for the case? ):
**Describe the bug**

When requesting GET `/Ticket/XXXXX/ITILSolution` or `/ITILSolution/YYY`, the field `solutiontype_name` is null.

**To reproduce**

Get the `ITILSolution` of ticket 123456 : 

```sh
curl -L -X GET 'https://glpi-server.com/apirest.php/Ticket/123456/ITILSolution' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Session-Token: l4nneearpofsbg2c5knfdrpim5' \
-H 'App-Token: mDL7YMyvkvyjltSi1M0acmjqL2gh8ueHmQC7jURq'
```
or 

```sh
curl -L -X GET 'https://glpi-server.com/apirest.php/ITILSolution/921390' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Session-Token: l4nneearpofsbg2c5knfdrpim5' \
-H 'App-Token: mDL7YMyvkvyjltSi1M0acmjqL2gh8ueHmQC7jURq'
```

Response in both cases : 

```json
[
    {
        "id": 921390,
        "itemtype": "Ticket",
        "items_id": 123456,
        "solutiontypes_id": 1,
        "solutiontype_name": null,
        "content": "lorem ipsum",
        "date_creation": "2019-10-21 11:30:12",
        "date_mod": null,
        "date_approval": null,
        "users_id": 0,
        "user_name": null,
        "users_id_editor": 0,
        "users_id_approval": 0,

                "href": "https://glpi-server.com/apirest.php/SolutionType/1"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

The actual `SolutionType` : 

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Ut enim ad minim veniam",
    "comment": "",
    "entities_id": 0,
    "is_recursive": 1,
    "date_mod": null,
    "date_creation": null,
    "links": [
        {
            "rel": "Entity",
            "href": "https://glpi-server.com/apirest.php/Entity/0"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Expected behavior**

Response expected : 

```json

        "itemtype": "Ticket",
        "items_id": 123456,

    }

```
Hello. Maybe this is a feature but this looks very strange...
Tasks are now displayed with carriage returns whcih is less practical than previous version.
For example in GLPI 9.4 :
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20357060/72427366-e29ad080-378b-11ea-928e-9316c068a8a3.png)
The same in GLPI 9.2:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20357060/72427489-2097f480-378c-11ea-820b-0d6730a02888.png)

The check box + the pen icon to edit the task in different lines / separated and it was far easier to have those icons on the same line.
**Describe the bug**
A ticket is deleted who was linked in a item of the knowbase and it appears in the item as "-1 " and is unable to delete.

**Page(s) URL**
myIP/glpi/front/knowbaseitem.form.php?id=myidoftheknowbaseitem

**To reproduce**
I think : the ticket was deleted OR the ticket was fusionned with another.
To delete it, I updated by SQL:

> UPDATE`` `glpi_knowbaseitems_items` SET `items_id` = 'AValidTicket' WHERE `glpi_knowbaseitems_items`.`id` = myidoftheknowbaseitem

** It should be possible to delete this inconsistency or have automatic deletion of this record when deleting/fusionning ticket.

Debug is :

**Your GLPI setup (you can find it in Setup > General menu, System tab)**

Sometimes it's necessary to just have the day without the time in the notification.
It's my own tag, but perhaps something like ##task.begin.notime## would be better ?

**Describe the bug**
When editing computers, peripherals and other items, I can only select users which have authorizations from the `User` dropdown, .

**Page(s) URL**
`/front/computer.form.php`

**To reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to `Computers`
2. Select the `User` dropdown
3. Search for a user that has no authorizations

**Expected behavior**
It should be possible to select users without authorizations.


**Your GLPI setup (you can find it in Setup > General menu, System tab)**

```
GLPI 9.3.1 (/glpi => /usr/share/glpi)
Installation mode: RPM
```

**Additional context**

Users are displayed properly when I set `users_id` manually in the database.

**Describe the bug**

When defining some devices types to be displayed in asset menu (in `Setup > General > Assets` tab), these devices appears in menu of any user using the standard interface, whatever his rights.

Note that it is also possible to access this list with direct URL, even for devices that are not displayed in assets menu.

**To reproduce**

1. Go in `Setup > General > Assets` and add a device type in `Devices displayed in menu` field.
2. Create a profile having no rights on assets nor components.
3. Create a user using this profile.
4. Login with created user.
5. See that user has an asset menu with an entry to device type selected in step 1.

**Expected behavior**

User should not have this menu entry.

**Your GLPI setup (you can find it in Setup > General menu, System tab)**

```
GLPI 9.5.0-dev-git-9.5/bugfixes-19254862d0 ( => /var/www/glpi)
Installation mode: GIT
```

**Additional informations**

Removing the `Item_Devices::canView()` override, which always return `tru`, fixes this problem, but I do not know if it has any side-effect.
