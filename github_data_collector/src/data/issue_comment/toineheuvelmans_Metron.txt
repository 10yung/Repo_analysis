It is nice to have this feature
If you should choose to pursue implementing a Bezier cubic curve, my repository CeranPaul/SketchCurves has class "Cubic" that could be helpful to you.

I haven't spent any time on a quadratic curve, but can see the usefulness of that for importing and exporting SVG's.

My repository needs to have its Ellipse class fleshed out.  I'll be in touch when I have something useful.

Metron is a lovely little library and has saved me a ton of time! Circle works for some cases, but not for ellipses. Seeing this officially supported would be great.
Added a function that returns the two intersection points of overlapping circles.
