Hi! I have made some slight updates to the RoCur Twitter documentation. 

spanish version is coming
From recent experience, you can now simply upload the [hex-logo-with-text.png](https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/blob/master/stickers/hex-logo-with-text.png) file, and they'll process it correctly (aka they don't need a bleed anymore). It would be great to revise the sticker instructions to reflect this!
add language to the "retiring a chapter" section of the starter kit to communicate how a chapter organizer can update contact information should they be passing along the chapter to someone new.
PDF Files are pretty but hard to edit. Convert these to Markdown for maximum collaborations!
I'm happy to do this, but I don't have edit access to the wiki. Also the other docs are all PDF, where are the originals that we can edit?

R Consortium has indicated per requirements of its sponsorship of R-Ladies, chapters need to show R Consortium as a sponsor. Basically we get the monies, they just want to show that they're doing stuff.

I've attached the logos.
