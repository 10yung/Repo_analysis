### What feature you'd like to see

I'd love to see Octobox manage which repositories I'm watching, not watching, ignoring, or have set to "releases only." I'd like Octobox to manage this setting for my GitHub repositories using the same filters/rules Octobox offers to manage my notifications today.

Specifically, I'd like to have a list of rules, perhaps regex or even just substring matches, for various fields on a repository. When new repos are created, or even on a regular schedule, I'd like to see Octobox apply those rules on all repositories in a specific GitHub organization, so that I _know_ I'm always watching the correct repos.

## Motivation

I enable "Automatic watching" in GitHub settings. It offers these two features:
> When you‚Äôre given push access to a repository, automatically receive notifications for it.
> When you‚Äôre added to or join a team, automatically receive notifications for that team‚Äôs discussions.

I spend a lot of time reviewing notifications from new repositories and deciding whether to continue watching them, or unwatch them. Especially repositories that are created and deleted as part of a CI/CD pipeline for GitHub applications/integrations/webhooks. I'd love to delegate that work to a tool like Octobox.

## Pitch

Let Octobox take the work out of managing your watched repositories. Do you...

- ever realize you're missing notifications from an important repository you didn't know existed? 
- sometimes follow a notification about being subscribed to a repository, only to discover it was already deleted?
- build a GitHub application or create/delete repositories as part of an automated build pipeline?
- constantly manage watching and unwatching on a large large GitHub organization?

Let Octobox help. Setup rules to enable Octobox to automatically watch and unwatch new repositories or existing repositories on a specific organization. Never worry about missing your notifications on repositories again.

(This is a small sample... I suspect quite a few other issues exist that could be addressed/improved by a feature like this.)

## üí• Proposal

### What feature you'd like to see

Link to issues on github on issue view / menu view.

## Motivation

Not everything renders correctly in octobox, and stuff is squashed, it would be useful to jump an issue out and see it in the original context.

## Pitch

A link from the issue number displayed in the view to its actual page would make it easy to jump out and use the full github setup rather than cramped in a sidebar)
## üí• Proposal

### What feature you'd like to see

A new filter to allow filtering by issue number, e.g. `issue: 2560`, or a "go to issue" shortcut

## Motivation

I maintain a Rubygem, RSpec, that has a large backlog of issues I'd like to tackle soon, and want to keep an on, they're often edgecases that require time for a small improvement but I don't believe in abandoning them and I have currently a large amount of book marks holding this information.

## Pitch

Being able to look up an issue by number is great for converting old todo lists into starred inbox items, currently I can't find some older issues (prehaps they have no notifications stored?) but would like to star them and use octobox as my go to management tool.

### Summary of Problem

- What are you trying to do?
   Starting octobox with docker compose[1] in a container.

- What happens?

  The container fails to start with an "Illegal instruction" instruction error that seems to originate from the ffi gem. See a fuller log here[2]

- What should have happened?

   Ocotobox starting normaly. It used to but a few months ago after pulling a new image it started failing.

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue

I'm not sure how to reproduce this, as this only happens on my personal server. The same image version runs properly on other machines.

### Versions, Operating System and Hardware

- Which version/commit of Octobox are you using?

   Running the latest tag of the docker image with the `b93be73b9118` digest.
I've pulled the newest version once in a while, the last couple of weeks trying if it would work again, but so far no success.

- How are you deploying Octobox (Docker, Heroku, Openshift, etc)

   Docker that is running Ocotobox is running on a CentOS 7 machine with latest packages and Docker version 19.03.4, build 9013bf583a. 


I didn't file this as a bug, because it probably is not directly an issue with Ocotobox.

`sassc` might also just be a manifestation of the issue, but with both assumptions 
I could be totally wrong.

The [Docker setup instructions](https://github.com/octobox/octobox/blob/master/docs/INSTALLATION.md#using-docker-and-docker-compose) do not show how to run the test suite with the docker-compose command.  I've successfully set up the app and started the Rails server with the following command (which is in the instructions):
```
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=yourclientid GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=yourclientsecret docker-compose up --build
```
What is the docker-compose command for running the test suite?   It should be added to the Docker setup instructions.

### Summary of Problem

- What are you trying to do?

Use octobox for my public repositories.

- What happens?

Notifications on from private repos are displayed, they are properly disabled and with the message to upgrade if you want to be able to see the actual notification.

- What should have happened?

"Should". I don't know if this is me missing something or should be a feature request. I expected to be able to disable repos/organizations so I don't have an in inbox that half of the entries are private because it includes my work organization, which I don't want.

Am I supposed to be able to disable specific orgs? Disable displaying private notifications?

Also, I have not installed/enabld the github octobox app for the work organization, so that isn't it.

Maybe it is because Github only lets you route organization notifications to different email addresses but not disable web notifications by organization?
<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->
A repo got renamed and the URL changed.
The name change was picked up, but the URLs for issues and PRs has not, so all the notifications point to the old URI part, which is no longer valid.

üêû **Problem**
Notifications which came in before the name change now link to a 404 on github.

üéØ **Goal**
The Notification URLs should be re-written when a change in repo name is detected.

üí° **Possible solutions**
When a repo name change is detected, check issue URLs and update accordingly.

üìã  **Steps to solve the problem**

 * Create a repo
 * Create an issue
 * Rename the repo or change its URI part
 * Try to access issue via octobox

**Supersedes #1940**

## Description

Creating a superset of our own logic (even just a single thing) to further distinguish GitHub's vague reasons in the Notifications API - aka #1940 - didn't prove to be a good solution for seeing open review requests. There were many times things didn't line up. There are too many different moving parts to the state machine that is 'reasons' for a notification and ultimately the information contained there isn't as important as the actual current state of the subject....which leads us to here.

These changes sync requested reviewers (as #1940 did, but with team review requests as well) and focus on the state of the subject and not at all about the notification reason. This aligns much better with 1) How Octobox currently works for basically everything else and 2) GitHub, because we aren't interpreting any differing state fighting with the semantics of the Notifications API. 

It's currently being tested at HashiCorp and we've had much, much better results this time around due to the simplicity of it.

## UX

* A new state filter is added to the sidebar for _individual_ review requests on your user; something that's applicable to anyone:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2430490/65379128-c9c05980-dc88-11e9-8d9d-30f6242006cc.png)
* _Team_ review requests do not have their own sidebar states. See considerations, below, for more. A URL filter _is_ available to use manually and for future considerations (`?team_review_requested=octobox%2Fsecurity`)
* Both individual and team review states are fully integrated in to the search syntax: `review_requested:chrisarcand` would be all notifications with a PR awaiting review from me; `team_review_requested:octobox/security` would be all notifications with a PR awaiting review from the Octobox security team. Both filters can have multiple comma-delimited values and both can be negated. Both of these filters match the existing syntax on GitHub's end (but are underscored! see considerations)
* Instead of their own sidebar states, with the search syntax above you can create your own pinned searches for the GitHub teams you'd like to monitor. This pairs very nicely with #1985, since pinned searches are just as good as the out-of-box set you're given.

## Considerations

* _On not having dedicated sidebar states per team review request:_ Simply put, this is to avoid having to add the logic of syncing a user's GitHub teams with Octobox. This _can_ be done, but I don't have the time at the moment and there's plenty of consideration to be had for how/why we'd want to do this. With pinned searches, the functionality I want is there without taking on this syncing. This work can be easily built on top of if team syncing is a thing anyone wants to do later.
* _On search syntax:_ Technically the search syntax isn't _exactly_ GitHub's. GitHub does something weird in that it mixes both underscores and hyphens. Example: `review:changes_requested reviewed-by:chrisarcand` (note keys are hyphenated and values underscored). The syntax for this feature in Octobox is the first where we have a multi-word key. The search syntax logic we have doesn't currently support hyphens (it thinks its a negation and mangles it) and it wasn't something I wanted to bother digging in to, especially since it's sort of nice that it's _just all underscores_ now. Hence: `review_requested:chrisarcand type:pull_request`.

### What feature you'd like to see

Some PR and issue threads have more comments than can be displayed on one screen. I can navigate to a PR or issue and open it with the keyboard, but I'd like to be able to navigate between comments in the thread.

## Motivation & Pitch

This will improve efficiency by not requiring users to switch between keyboard and mouse.

**Problem**

I love this project and it has become essential to my day to day work. Thank you very much for all your hard work on this!

I pay my subscription through opencollective, and yet regularly notifications from private repos are hidden with `Private notification on ..., upgrade to unlock`. After some time and many refreshes, this goes away and notifications are shown properly again. This happens on both my laptop and phone so not environment related.
