Hello `evilplot` Team,

Thank you for your library it made my life easier.

I was wondering if there are any plans on drawing an `SVG` or maybe somebody is already working on it?
The requirement for an extra resolver means that every downstream dependency has to add that resolver. 
There is a relatively easier solution, that is, sync the bintray repo to Maven central, this way the release will be available on maven central which default for sbt. 

There are mainly 2 steps: 

1. First setup sonatype [here is a guide](https://github.com/olafurpg/sbt-ci-release#sonatype)
2. Then setup the sync on bintry 
[Here is the guide](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/BT/Syncing+with+Third-Party+Platforms). 



Thanks very much in advance.
Scala 2.13 has been out for since June. Please, add support for it in the cross build.

As part of this update, you can also updated the following:

- Scala 2.12.4 -> 2.12.10
- circe 0.9.0 ->  0.12.2
- Breeze 0.13.2 -> 1.0
- ScalajS 0.6.22 -> 0.6.29

There's a plugin that adds a `dependencyUpdates` command to list new dependencies that are available. To use it,  add the following to `project/plugins.sbt`:

```
addSbtPlugin("com.timushev.sbt" % "sbt-updates" % "0.4.2")
```

I need to display circles with radio depending on the data. I tried to do with PointRendered.custom but the scale factor is not available with this function. 
Also, I need to paint a circle, that is only the border of the disk but traying with
Disc.centered(x.radio).filled(transparentColor).colored(visibleColor).weighted(2)
only paint the inside any way.
What can I do?
Thanks

I would like to set the image size in pixels. 
I tried this but it does not work. 

```
    val bufferedImage = plot
      .xAxis()
      .yAxis()
      .frame()
      .xLabel("x")
      .yLabel("y")
      .render(Extent(800, 600))
      .asBufferedImage
    ImageIO.write(bufferedImage, "png", file1)
```
Is this the correct way to do it? 
 

Hi, thanks for the great work.
Is it possible to show the data when I hovering over a point?
Hi guys, this project is amazing! Do you have any plans for graph rendering by any chance?..
Currently the legend order is determined by the order or series construction. If this process isn't easily ordered it would be nice to have some method to order the legend.
evilplot-repl displayPlot output is pixelated image (2x lower resolution) on HiDPI displays where UI scaling is 200%.

Implicits have a “very” complicated priority lookup scheme.  For the most part I try to use them at either a VeryLow priority (within it’s own object) or at a VeryHigh  precedence (local scope definition). 

Including the default implicit in the companion object is an idiomatic and ideal use case of a default configuration type like this.  If a user wants a specific theme they can add it; otherwise they don't even have to know about themes.  Furthermore, the tutorials and getting up to speed examples can be much more approachable by removing the friction from these unrelated details, but still make them configurable if someone desires this tangential feature.
