Hardware relevant to your issue (e.g. graphic card model, audio/MIDI device):
Windows 7 64bits sp1
I5 M430
ATI HD5650

### Summary

### Steps to reproduce : 
Install rack 1.1.6 and run

_I'm not sure that I'm getting this right, so please recheck it._

It seems like comparing `t` with `x_bc` is meaningless because all integers inside `x_bc` are the same and based on `x`. Is it a typo?
### Details

Operating system: MacOS 10.12.6
Rack version: v1.1.6
Hardware relevant to your issue (e.g. graphic card model, audio/MIDI device): shouldn't matter, it's piped through MIDIPipe

### Summary

I wanted to use two MIDI devices together, so I used MIDIPipe to put them both on the same virtual device, using different channels. (Using "Channel Filter" and "Channel Router".) Inside VCV Rack, I use the standard MIDI-CV module to connect V/Oct, Gate, and RTRG via polyphonic cables, with polyphony mode set to 8 and "Rotate" selected.

This almost works. However, if I hold down a note on one of the devices and play a chord containing that note in the other one, it cancels the held-down note, even though they are in different channels.

I verified by logging in MIDIPipe that the "Note On" and "Note Off" messages really are on different channels. Also, it doesn't happen in GarageBand. So, I suspect some kind of polyphony bug in VCV Rack where notes from different MIDI channels are being mapped to the same polyphony channel?

### Steps to reproduce

I don't know how you debug your MIDI, but basically send a "Note On" on one channel and a "Note Off" for the same note on a different channel and see if it stops the note.
I have installed various libraries in rack, around 765 modules.
When I try to open some of them, rack creates a lot of lag and when I try to search something, it gets some times to a condition of "non-responding".

Firstly, I am curious why it is so slow on searching modules?
Secondly is there a mechanism, so I select by default a subset of all the modules that I use to appear when I press right-click (to add a new module)?

Rack version 1.1.6, Operating System: Windows 10
Thanks a lot!

Issue:
Found a similar issue https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/issues/1316 , which was closed but the problem it described was not solved. I don't think having no audio device active should cause 100% cpu usage with any number of threads. I'd even expect an empty rack to use near 0% CPU when there's nothing to draw and nothing to calculate.
Especially when running other audio software at the same time, it's disastrous in a live setting when one program suddenly starts hogging all cpu time just by starting it.

Proposed solution:
Something along the lines of limiting the rate of whatever is being processed when no audio device is loaded.

### Details

Operating system: Pop!_OS 19.10 (very close to Ubuntu)
Rack version: v1.1.6
Hardware relevant to your issue (e.g. graphic card model, audio/MIDI device):
Audio device: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-LP HD Audio

### Summary
Hi everyone,

I am on a Linux laptop and I just downloaded the latest version of VCVRack.
However no sound is coming out of my computer when I press a MIDI key.

### Steps to reproduce

I first launch the jack server : `jack_control start`
Then I launch Rack : `./Rack`

This is the output in the console : 

```
Cannot lock down 82280346 byte memory area (Cannot allocate memory)
Cannot use real-time scheduling (RR/5)(1: Operation not permitted)
JackClient::AcquireSelfRealTime error
Cannot use real-time scheduling (RR/5)(1: Operation not permitted)
JackClient::AcquireSelfRealTime error
```

Then when I press a key it should play a sound (with the default startup setup) whether I choose ALSA or JACK in the AUDIO-8 module.

Where is the issue?

Thanks

### Summary

This is just a quality of life improvement.
Save time scrolling around, b y providing quick access to common views.
The motivation for me, is that I'm using an old laptop with a touchpad, and it's a bit tricky to move about.

### Proposed design
Provide 10 possible shortcuts using the number keys.
Save a shortcut:
Navigate to a module and interact with it.  press Shift-CTRL-n
The module and zoom level is assign to slot 1
If a slot is already used, it is overwrite, no checks are performed to preserve a previous shortcut information.

Use a shortcut:
Press CTRL-n
The store module is centred and the zoom level is set, according to the save information.
If a slot is not defined, no action is taken.
If a module is no longer valid, no action is taken.

The shortcuts are stored in the patch.

This might be a little bit tricky since 44.1 is considered a "base" in the code and everything else is oversampling, but I'd love it if we could choose lower engine sample rates (ex., 11.025 kHz and 22.05 kHz) so that I can get a lot more oomph out of my "live"/realtime patching and avoid nasty crackling, and then I can switch back to 44.1 for my renders.

If you accept as a concept - and it's not too crazy to implement - I'd be happy to submit a PR.

### Details

Operating system: Windows 7
Rack version: v1.1.6
Hardware relevant to your issue: Network MIDI connection via rtpMIDI, using the iOS app GeoShred Control on an iPad Pro (2018) as a MIDI controller

### Summary
Using GeoShred Control with VCV Rack [as described here](https://community.vcvrack.com/t/guide-using-geoshred-control-ios-app-as-a-mpe-controller-for-vcv-rack/7217/4), when two notes are being held, the third note and any additional notes will usually respond as if pitch bend is being released from a previously-held state. It feels something like a "ghost portamento" sliding the note from some mysterious, non-existent prior note. I have attached an audio file demonstrating the behavior as well as the patch file used to generate this example recording.

### Summary

The goal of this proposal is to brainstorm a way to add "DAW-like" global transport functionality to VCV rack. 

With the upcoming of "Rack for Daws", it's likely that lot of users will expect VCV's sequencers and other time-based module to play "in sync" with their DAW, regardless of the position from which the playback is started in a track. 

Furthermore, having such a module in VCV standalone would make it easier to develop modules for DAW like functions as automation recorders, WAV players, etc..

### Proposed design

One approach could be to have a "Transport module" outputs two CVs :

- One CV output would indicate the index of the beat which is currently playing. A function would allow to convert a 0-10v signal to an absolute beat index. The max beat index would be ridiculously high to face any situation.

- One Phase CV would output the position inside the current beat with a  0-10v signal, like ZZC Clock already does : https://zzc.github.io/en/clock-manipulation/clock
