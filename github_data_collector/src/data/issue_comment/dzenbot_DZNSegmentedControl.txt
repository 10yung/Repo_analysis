Hi
i tried to run my app in xcode beta 6 & ios 10 simulator (iphone 5)
DZNSegmentedControl doesn't show right

Hi, 

When a segment is selected, I'm looking for a way to set a different text color and indicator color.
I checked the code, the indicator is the same as text color.

So can you add an additional indicator color attribute, which will override the tint color?

Thanks!

In ScrollView-Example DEMO, I set `self.segmentedControl.autoAdjustSelectionIndicatorWidth = YES;` then I  draging scrollView, it appear like this...

For designs that have the segment edges alight to the borders of the control

Thanks for great work!
I have a question
Is it possible create DZNSegmentedControl in custom view instead UITableHeaderView?
