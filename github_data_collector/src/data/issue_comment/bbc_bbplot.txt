Hi! 

I've been using this package today to try it out and I am very happy with it.

I have a logo image that I want to add to my plot. I used the logo_image_path option in the finalise_plot function.
The logo is added to the plot, but it is not complete, it is cutted on the right side.

Is there a way to have it complete without having to change the dimensions of the image?

Thank you,
Carlotta.

Cool book.  Just a suggestion here:

ggplot(bar_df, 
       aes(x = reorder(country, lifeExp), y = lifeExp, fill = country == "Mauritius")) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#dddddd", "#1380A1"), guide = F) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, size = 1, colour="#333333") +
  bbc_style() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title="Reunion is highest",
       subtitle = "Highest African life expectancy, 2007") +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color="#cbcbcb"), 
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())

[Windows does not have it's own Helvetica font,](https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/windows-subs-helvetica-arial) which results in warnings when using bbc_style() on a typical windows computer.

Running `windowsFonts(Helvetica = "TT Arial")` at the start of the script will use the windows default of treating Helvetica as Arial and avoid the warnings.
This pull request is related to the issue #8. It modifies the `bbc_style` function in order to include two arguments:

- _Font_: it allows changing the font type. This is especially relevant in Windows machines since Helvetica isn't a Windows core font.
- _Offset_: Due to size differences while changing the font type, this argument add or subtract the offset amount to the current font size.
Windows machines do not support Helvetica font type, so I had to make modifications to the `bbc_style()` in a separate `ggplot2()` function.  It would be cool to have maybe a `font` argument that defaults to Helvetica, but would allow others to change the font name.  Once the font changes, there may be some sizing differences, so it would also be cool to create an `offset` size, to do a plus or minus the current font sizes used in your function:  `bbc_style <- function(font = "Helvetica", offset = 0)`, which would allow me to use it like this: `bbc_style("Arial", -2)`.
When finalizing a plot, it would be nice to be able to pull a logo from a URL. This would make it easier to share code examples without first requiring users to download the logos.
if I use the function `bbc_style()`, Chinese characters cannot show properly in the final graphic even when I add `theme(text = element_text(family = "Kai"))`.
Delete `bbc_style()` can work properly.

So I think there may be some problem with `bbc_style()` when using Chinese characters.
I was reading your https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/ and this is pretty great, but there's an easy step that you could take that would add simplicity and consistency to the plot making process: Take a look at [RColorBrewer](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/RColorBrewer/versions/1.1-2/topics/RColorBrewer)... it let's you very simply to call out colors as per a variety of themes... perhaps something like this could be done w/ BBC colours? This way one would never have to read a theme sheet, it would be built right in. Helpful?
