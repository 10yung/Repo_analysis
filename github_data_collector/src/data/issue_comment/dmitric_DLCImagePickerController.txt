No visible @interface for 'GPUImageOutput<GPUImageInput>' declares the selector 'imageFromCurrentlyProcessedOutputWithOrientation:'

croppedImage is gone. What's the replacement?

Cherry picked both previous pull requests and merged.
Fixed up the autolayout constraints.
Also changes the target to iOS 6.0 and above.

Hey,

Thanks for this code ! 
I just have an memory issue... when I take a picture with ou without filter and I close the controller, dealloc is called but memory doesn't decrease and still stay at approx 70Mb.

Do you have this pb too ?

Thanks
Ben


Hi,

```
Is there a way we can adjust the brightness of the captured image using UISlider. Once you move the slider you can preview the brightness that will change. I have tried it using live view only. But i can't figure it out on the captured image. Hope you can help me on this.
```

Thanks!

Hello,
I have been using this fantastic library for a little over two month, and by this point I have fully implemented what I will need for my app. However, I was wondering if anyone knew how to add some more customisation to the UIButton's in the Scroll View, so that I can show names of the custom filters, and also how to add a border for the selected filter. I have attempted to do this for a few hours to no avail. Could anyone help with this?

Regards,
Christopher

HI.

I use DLCImagePickerController take a photo and select blur effect, it is well. then i touch the view and select blur effect position,  I see a black round area on my screen:

touch before:

touch after:
http://img3.tuchuang.org/uploads/2013/12/IMG_1249.PNG

how would i be able to modify the current radial blur to make it work like the Instagram tilt shift effect. 
1. I would need to use the GPUImageTiltShiftFilter.
2. I would need to change the DLCBlurOverlayView to make the radius into a rotating rectangle.
   any help would be greatly appreciated.
