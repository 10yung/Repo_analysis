## Current behavior

<!-- Describe how the issue manifests. -->
after clicking "go live" it opens chrome browser and shows the page but when I make a change and save the file, the chrome browser is not reloading automatically. I've also tried it on firefox browser but the result is still the same. but when i use edge, auto reloading works perfectly fine.

## Expected behavior

<!-- Describe what the desired behavior would be. -->
auto reloading should be working on most of the web browsers.

## Environment

```html

Issue Type: <b>Performance Issue</b>

This happened yesterday once i updated vs code and the extensions. I uninstalled the extensions and reinstalled them. There is still teh same issue where i save my changes then live server takes 15 seconds or more to refresh the browser.
Im Not sure if it is a live server issue or a vs code issue as vs code seems to run slower in general as well once i 'Go Live'. Yesterday, I left the program running for a while then when I came back to it, the issue had gone and everything was running at usual speed.

Extension version: 5.6.1
VS Code version: Code 1.41.1 (26076a4de974ead31f97692a0d32f90d735645c0, 2019-12-18T14:58:56.166Z)

## Environment
- Live Server: 5.6.1 
- Platform: Windows
## Settings
"liveServer.settings.port": 8080,
"liveServer.settings.host": "localhost",
"liveServer.settings.https": {
   "enable": true, //set it true to enable the feature.
    "cert": "D:\\certificate.crt", //full path
    "key": "D\\privateKey.key", //full path
    "passphrase": "12345"
    },

ER: Server runs on port 8080
AR: Server always runs on port 8081

Even if i change to something like 3000 it still runs on 8081.
It was working fine, but i think i broke it when i accidentally ran live server while port 8080 was taken. Since then it runs on 8081 no matter what. Tried deleting cs code settings in Roaming/Code, tried restarting PC, reinstall extension. Nothing helped.

## Current behavior
Extra Div gets injected in HTML view, while having commented body closing tag somewhere in source code HTML.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25428033/71819473-09814480-30b2-11ea-94d9-855e95ec6a87.png)

## Expected behavior

Additional  '-->' element should not be injected,which is quite annoying while page is displayed in browser.

## Environment

```html
Browser:

- [ ] Chrome (desktop) version 79.0.3945.88 (Official Build) (64-bit)


For Tooling issues:

- Live Server: 5.6.1
- Platform:  Windows
- Visual Studio Code: 1.41.1
```

## Others

This is just an cosmetic issue , where '-->' text gets appended below the '<!-- <!-- Code injected by live-server -->' script code , while having a commented closing body tags in the source code.
