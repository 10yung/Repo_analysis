Hello, I've want to ask information about ALFA Network AWUS036NH, can I run Krack-Attack-Script with ALFA Network AWUS036NH???
In this wireless adapter, i have already installed driver rt2800usb, the chipset is ralink technology RT2870/RT3070.
Thanks for your help.
Hi:

This is a small guide to test your client wifi. I bought TL-WN722N v1 device but I will test it with anothers... I used Kali 2017.1.

1.- Install kali.

2.- Execute:

$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev pkg-config libssl-dev net-tools git sysfsutils python-scapy python-pycryptodome

3.- Clone krack-attack scripts

$ git clone https://github.com/vanhoefm/krackattacks-scripts.git

4.- Compile hostapd:

$ cd krackattacks-scripts/krackattack
--> We are in "krackattacks-scripts/krackattack" directory
$ pwd
/root/krackattacks-scripts/krackattack
$ cd ../hostapd
$ cp defconfig .config
$ make -j 2

5.- Disable hardware network

$  cd ../krackattack/
$ chmod 777 disable-hwcrypto.sh
$ ./disable-hwcrypto.sh
$ rfkill unblock wifi
$ ifconfig wlan0mon down
$ ifconfig wlan0 down
$ nmcli networking off
$ reboot

6.- Test client:

$ python2 krack-test-client.py

--> It will be waiting for connections to his own ESSID. It is "testnetwork" and psk is "abcdefgh".
When you connect (with other device, not with this machine Kali 2017.1) the client you will see if your client has or hasnt the vulnerability in both, normal or group.

Best regards
Perico

Which patch should be updated on android 6.0 for the first test --replay-broadcast? 
Configuration file: /root/krackattack/krackattack/hostapd.conf
nl80211: Could not configure driver mode
nl80211: deinit ifname=wlan0 disabled_11b_rates=0
nl80211 driver initialization failed.
wlan0: interface state UNINITIALIZED->DISABLED
wlan0: AP-DISABLED 
wlan0: CTRL-EVENT-TERMINATING 
hostapd_free_hapd_data: Interface wlan0 wasn't started
connect exception  hostapd_ctrl/wlan0 9877

Can you please suggest what might be this error?
When i am running ./krack-test-client.py file i am getting error as Invalid Syntax at "../wpaspy/wpaspy.py".
I have tried executing using python2, i am getting above error and as per github README file wpaspy.py file is written in python3. So i tried running through python3 i am getting error like scapy not available for python3.
Can you please suggest me on this issue. I am running on Ubuntu 16.04 machine

How can I fix it?  Thanks.


I'm running  "./krack-test-client.py --replay-broadcast" and I receive many messages with the text:

"Reset PN for GTK"

Can I conclude that the client passed the test successfully? 

Same thing with test 2 ./krack-test-client.py --group --gtkinit I get many:

"Renewed the group key"

Same with 3  ./krack-test-client.py --group, 4 ( /krack-test-client.py )  and 5 (./krack-test-client.py --tptk)

"Reset PN for GTK" 

Thank you ! 



I don't understand why it keeps telling me "No such device". Is there a problem with the code? I've gone through all the steps correctly.
