I changed the database designï¼Œthe location of some items has been changed. Now the data on the web page is invisible, and an error is reported:
NO MODEL ASSOCIATED
This will break things in weird and horrible ways. Edit this asset now to assign it a model.

Help, it's urgent

Is the install.sh script is available for RHEL 8.1

Hello,
This is my first post so sorry if i will some mistake.
Do you plan in future for manager Licence in Snipe-IT something about license value scales. This is what I need to determine how many times i have to splite one license.
I ask because i don't ever seen any software which can assign one license for example: 2,3,4,5,6,...,16,... assets. Every software which i saw  works on natural number not float value and i 
think this is needed to resolve me problem with license split.
This example occurs with redhat licensing specifically subscription. Subsryption RedHat says that you can have one subscription for one physical server but the same one subscription can have 2 two virtual servers. This is my problem for license management.

Exists some license for which i can ascribe for 30 assets.
Do you have an idea how to solve this problem? Or can you put it in the future for application development for better license management or maybe can you indicate if you have such a plan?

For solve this problem i need some field in creating License where i could write float value. In this case when i write float value 0,5 or split licence for 10 parts i get ten seats in licence and software have to know that is still one license.

**Describe the bug**
After you check out a license you return to the license screen, not to the license view screen

**To Reproduce**
1. Go to Licenses
2. Click on a License name
3. Now you are in the View License screen and you can Checkout licenses
4. After you checkout a license you are returned to the Licenses screen (2 steps back) - you should return to the View License screen (1 step back) 

**Expected behavior**
After a license checkout you should return to the View License screen so you can checkout another license to someone else.

Email notifications work fine for licenses that are within the alerts threshold window for the expiration date. However after the expiration date passes and the license is overdue, email notifications are no longer generated.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Generate emails notifications after license expiration and is overedue; include overdue license expiration in the "expiring-alerts" context.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Homegrown script to generate the report based on the date; Would really prefer to have this feature included with the current notifications.

#### Expected Behavior (or desired behavior if a feature request)

Desired behavior: We would like the activities/actions logged when changes are made during check-in. If a device status_id changes during check-in, that would be nice to have that logged as it is during an update.

-----

#### Actual Behavior

Changes to status (etc.) made during check-in are not logged.

- What OS and web server you're running Snipe-IT on: Debian/Apache

- This is not an error report, just a feature request. No error related answers available.

- Confirm whether the error is reproducible on the demo: https://snipeitapp.com/demo
 I was able to reproduce.

- Include what you've done so far in the installation, and if you got any error messages along the way.
No errors.

- Indicate whether or not you've manually edited any data directly in the database
No

Currently using the snipe api (https://snipe-it.readme.io/reference#hardware-list) in python to search for all assets assigned to a user, but the user has a non ascii character in their name.  The api call requires a string in python, however I cannot search for the non ascii "\xc3\xa6" as no results are returned.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
To search for user in the hardware list via employee number or search with non ascii characters.  The ability to search for user with employee number is preferable as duplicate names might exist in the future and could cause further issues down the line.  

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Searching for a different criteria, but no such search returns the desired results. 

**Additional context**
Or additionally if snipe could have a concept of a user that left from LDAP, and assets that need to be returned via a report that would be even better. 

Please ask if more information would be required. 

**Server:**
 - Snipe-IT Version 4+
 - OS: not relevant
 - Web Server: not relevant
 - PHP Version not relevant

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Short answer: yes. Currently there's no way to prevent users from editing the same objects simultaneously, which may lead to inconsistent database data. If user U1 begins editing asset A1, nothing prevents user U2 from also editing A1 at the same time. When that happens, whichever user saves first will at best lose all their changes once the other user saves theirs, and at worst the end result will be a mix of both U1's and U2's changes.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
This can be prevented if the objects are "locked" for editing for the user that first acquires it. Some mechanism has to be implemented in the ORM that locks the object, identifying the user that locked it, and has some timeout or other solution to prevent indefinite locks, should the user forget to "save" or "cancel". Other users attempting to edit the object will be checked against the current active lock and will see their requests denied.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Additionally, it may be important to consider checking the object data for changes since it was opened for editing, and at the very least warn the user that the data he is seeing is not up to date.

**Server:**
 - Version: 4.8.0
 - OS: Ubuntu (via snipe dockerHub image)
 - Web Server: Apache
 - PHP Version: Default in 4.8.0 image 

Firstly, thanks for a quality app!

I am running Snipe on a large Kubernetes cluster, and there are various security restrictions I have to adhere to. Executing a pod as the root user using kubernetes a 'securityContext: runAsUser: root' is strongly discouraged.

Our internal SecOps team have audited the app, and expressed concern that the startup.sh requires root access. There is a long-running issue with kubernetes that means a root user inside a container is the node root user, which is a possible escalation / escape risk.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
For the docker version of snipe to run as a dedicated user, rather than requiring root access. You may have already explored and dismissed this possibility as non-viable? Root access is fine during the dockerfile, but once inside the container, running as root is a risk.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I've tried to work around the problem by modifying startup.sh and adding our layering our own dockerfile, but this requires fairly extensive rework of the dockerfile & startup.sh script, and will make upgrades painful.
