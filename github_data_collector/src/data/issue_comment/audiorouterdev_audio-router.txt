Hard routing straight up breaks everything that isn't being routed and requires a restart to fix audio.
CPU usage shouldn't be 10% on a 4 core 4ghz CPU for a audio routing program.
Lastly, I've been starting to get errors when ever I try to route:
Error code 0x00000241: Windows cannot verify the digital signature for this file. A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source.
Router functionality not available.

I'm on windows10 64bit build 18362.476
I've tried to right click the dlls and tick the option of "this dll is from unkown computer and might've been blocked" or something like that, to no avail.

Added this information to the README (Issue #93)

Problem doesnt occur with spotify but does with certain games like wow, minecraft and cod:mw takes a few seconds after an action and then i get this error.

I wanted to record gameplays of a game app on Bluestacks. 
But I need to route the audio to Realtek Digital Output so that I can do something else while OBS Studio is recording the gameplay. 
I always do this whenever I'm live streaming eg; play an hour-long "no copyright" music on VLC (on loop) for the live stream and route the audio to Realtek Digital Output. 
This way, only my audience hears the music and not on my streaming PC. When I tried to route the audio to RDO on Bluestacks eg; open the game app on Bluestacks and click route the audio to RDO on Audio Router (AR), the game app on Bluestacks always reloads itself and the icon on AR disappears at the same time. 
Does anyone know how to make it work?
Or what it is that I'm doing wrong?
TQ

The process C:\blah\blah\blah\do.exe manifests ransomware behavior and was blocked. Your files have been protected from being altered.

that's all the information that I able to extract from Bitdefender.

the program worked like a charm before the error came up. duplicated over 3 sources.
tested with: Balabolka, TTSReader, DSpeech
