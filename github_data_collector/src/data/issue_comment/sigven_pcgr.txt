Hi Sigven,
possible incomplete installation for grch37?
Thanks,
Fco.

Hi,
I have detected that in grch37 this error occurs:

Any ideas about it?
Very thanks !!

Hi,
   I found the database of tcga from "grch37 data bundle - 20191116" is likely to be incomplete as only chromosome of 1-6 are included. The same situation also applies to grch38. So, would please check the completeness of the source data?
   Best Regards!
Hi，pcgr is really an awesome work, and I hope it could go further by incoporating the trial information of a drug from ClinicalTrials.gov database, such as add a link when targeted-drug information available.

thanks for your great tool, and now I'm in china, can't download data bundles. Is there other method to download data or other data warehouse to use? thanks for your reply!
Thanks for the great tool - very useful! Do you think there would be any chance of a summary HTML across a cohort of samples that have been through PCGR? 
Hello @sigven ! 

I would like to calculate TMB using data generated from panels. Am I able to do so with this tool? Do I have to use a specific panel?
Is it possible to specify the `name` of the tumor sample in the VCF, and then for pcgr to extract `AF`, `DP` from that column?

Do you a recommended approach, to extract AF from sample specific columns and add them to the INFO field of the VCF?

Thanks for the great tool!
Sigve,

As far as I'm aware in order to apply VEP plugins, you need to specify them in `vep` command line, i.e.:

```
vep --input_file .... --plugin miRNA --plugin LoF
```

[See:](https://github.com/konradjk/loftee#usage)

> Basic usage:
> `perl variant_effect_predictor.pl [--other options to VEP] --plugin LoF`

[and:](https://github.com/Ensembl/VEP_plugins)

> ...for most you will just need to put the module in your ~/.vep/Plugins directory (or elsewhere on your $PERL5LIB) and then run the VEP with the argument --plugin <module name>.

I can't find if you define them this way: https://github.com/sigven/pcgr/blob/master/pcgr.py#L493-L497. You don't use them or there is another way to apply plugins that I'm missing?
