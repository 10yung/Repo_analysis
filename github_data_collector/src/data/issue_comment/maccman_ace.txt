@maccman I was wondering if you could offer some comparison to express. I asked TJ on IRC his thoughts:

```
kuhrt tjholowaychuk: do you have an opinion on Ace? https://github.com/maccman/ace
7:54 PM tjholowaychuk i wouldn't recommend it because of the node-fiber stack sizes
7:54 PM you would use a lot of memory
7:55 PM if we had growable stacks then yeah sure
7:55 PM kuhrt you don't mean this line do you?
7:55 PM "Node >= v0.7.3 is required, as well as npm. Ace will run on older versions of Node, but will crash under heavy load due to a bug in V8 (now fixed)."
7:55 PM tjholowaychuk no
7:56 PM kuhrt ok
7:56 PM tjholowaychuk just that stack sizes are pretty large
7:56 PM i forget the exact number
7:56 PM but basically you'd run out of memory fast if you had a lot of concurrent users
7:56 PM dylang has joined the channel.
7:56 PM tjholowaychuk well requests
7:56 PM kuhrt I thought the project looked somewhat ineteresting, fun to try maybe at least (what's different than express, concepts, etc.)
7:56 PM but the last commit was 5 months agoo
7:56 PM so it seems kind of dead
7:57 PM tjholowaychuk stack per request is great but not unless the entire community embraces coroutines
7:57 PM which has been killed off many times
7:57 PM in the mailing list etc
7:57 PM kuhrt hm
7:57 PM TimeTurner has left IRC ()
7:57 PM tjholowaychuk so basically it's between using lots of memory + sync or less memory + async
7:58 PM kuhrt ok
7:59 PM tjholowaychuk and obviously other things like ace's static file server being really poor but they could use "send" now
7:59 PM to get all the features that connect.static() provides under the hood
7:59 PM but yeah that's the fundamental tradeoff with multiple stacks unless you can grow like erlang
8:01 PM kuhrt tjholowaychuk: by "grow" you mean paralellize?
8:02 PM multi-core stuff
8:02 PM tjholowaychuk just grow like a 500 byte stack can grow to 1k or 5k if it needs more room
8:02 PM otherwise you're just wasting ram
8:03 PM kuhrt does your critique extend to strata or was that design choice at the Ace-level, or do you even know haha (talking to you like you're the author)
8:03 PM tjholowaychuk the default stack size for them is 64kb
8:03 PM so yeah, tons of memory
8:03 PM strata is the rack thing
8:03 PM kuhrt yup
8:03 PM tjholowaychuk more like connect
8:03 PM and ace is more like express
8:03 PM kuhrt yup
8:04 PM tjholowaychuk so for 1000 concurrency requests
8:04 PM kuhrt did you like anything in strata missing in connect?
8:04 PM tjholowaychuk you would use
8:04 PM 64mb of ram
8:04 PM on the stacks alone
8:04 PM vs 0
8:04 PM well vs node's single stack
8:05 PM which may or may not be a problem depending on the app
```

There's already a widely-used ACE in the JS world: https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace . Now might be a good time to pick a different name.
