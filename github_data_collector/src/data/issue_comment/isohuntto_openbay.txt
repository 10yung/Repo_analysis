Who can provide a recent dump data?

Thanks!

I made a very nice Kickass api data dumps (Full data dump and 
Latest 24 hours data dump) to Openbay DB converter and updater written in shell and MySQL. Now it's possible to have an own Torrent site with nearly the same DB like the kickass site. And the best thing is that you get every hour an update. I wrote two working shell scripts that will do all work for you.

**How it works:**
1. Installing mysql on your Linux server (sudo apt-get install mysql-server)
2. Download the two shell scripts that you find at the bottom of this text
3. Edit the shell script and fill in your MySQL password in the second line
4. Open the KickassFullDump.sh once to get the full Kickass DB and open KickassUpdater.sh to update your DB with root permissions (or change cd /root path in the script on line 5). For automatically updates you can use something like crontab.

If you have any questions don't be afraid to ask.

Is there any operational public dbs at the moment? 

My "mirror" (http://flv4.ddns.net/) has been down for a while due to old Sphinx and db settings. 

The servers im trying to use are these  (
got them from this tread a while ago https://github.com/isohuntto/openbay/issues/170 
)

MYSQL IP: mysql.tpbt.org
MYSQL PORT: 3306
MYSQL DATABASE: openbay
MYSQL Username: openbay
MYSQL Password: AcSxMV4AEpKFEWK5

SPHINX IP: sphinx.tpbt.org
SPHINX PORT: 9306

As I saw in code, scrapes task created in scrapes_queue when someone browsing torrens. When I'm run ./yii scrape/queue It trying to get those scrapes task with following sql:
select s.id, t.hash, t.id as torrent_id, s.name from scrapes s
right join torrents t on s.torrent_id = t.id
where s.status = 0 and t.id in (9461,7690,1623,7059)
order by s.name;
But it's never will get any rows while scrapes(not scrapes_queue) records empty. I found just 1 logic with inserting those table and it's after this sql. So summing of saying, scrape logic will never runs. 

Are anyone running a public db that can be shared? 

I was using TPBT OFFICIALS db :

```
        'connectionString' => 'mysql:host=5.135.13.72;port=3306;dbname=tpbt'
        'username' => 'openbay',
        'password' => 'AcSxMV4AEpKFEWK5',
```

This stopped working a while ago on all boxes using this db. If you run a public db, please share contact info for that one

Yours hopefully  - )

Simple:

```
yii migrate --migrationPath=@frontend/modules/language_content/migrations
```

and go to any torrent:)

Migrations needed for installation

```
yii migrate
yii migrate --migrationPath=@frontend/modules/follower/migrations
```

```
/torrents/username - Show all user's torrents
/follow/username - Follow user's torrents
/unfollow/username - Stop follow user's torrents
/followers - Show all followers
/following - Show all following
```
