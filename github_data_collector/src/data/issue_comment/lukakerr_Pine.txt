Would be great if an autosave feature would be implemented. I just experienced a crash which meant I lost all my edits to a document.
Pine crashed while editing a document. Not doing anything special, not inserting special characters or anything out of the ordinary I can think of..

[crashlog.txt](https://github.com/lukakerr/Pine/files/3805137/crashlog.txt)

The text on the editor is wrapped at the launch of the app. But if the preview panel is closed and open again, the editor panel's text is no longer wrapped and it creates a "horizontal scrolling mode".

Could be possible to add an option to select if the text should be wrapped and fit to the window width?

when adding a local image to a markdown document, a space in the filename will break image loading in the preview window
would be great if files/folders added to the sidebar are remembered through quitting and restarting the app.

For work, I often work from the same folders and it would be cool if Pine could remember this
It is not clear to me how to add folders or files to the sidebar.

I've tried dragging and dropping folders, to no avail. Any pointers? Thanks!

### My Setup:
Pine: v0.1.0 (1)
macOS: 10.14.6
I joyfully noticed the Pine supports OSX versioning (File->Revert to). Unfortunately, it doesn't behave as per the expectation. 

I do see the file history UI but it open all or atleast last two revisions in app and dismiss the history view and leave the two different versions of the file open. I could not grab the screenshot of the dismissal, however attaching the post dismiss (two version of document open in Pine) screenshots.

Also attaching the default ui (or how it is expected to work using Textedit on same file).

Thanks once again, for open source I'm planning to explore the UI testing to implement in my hobby projects.

I installed the app through Homebrew and GitHub zip release, but unfortunately both gave me a broken toolbar:

Also tried to restart the app for multiple times, which doesn't help. Have I missed anything here?
