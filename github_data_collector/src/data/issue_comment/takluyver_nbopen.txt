I ran the `nbopen` installation and activation commands on Windows 10 .  I am using a new installation of Anaconda Python distribution (new as of last week 1/10/2020).

>>> python -m pip install nbopen
>>> python -m nbopen.install_win

Then I double-click on a Jupyter notebook file, the interpreter Command Prompt flashes, but the Jupyter NB file never opens up.   I saw this behavior about 11 months ago the first time I tried it. 
What is the fix for this? 
nbopen doesn't work with my setup, so I'd like to undo the changes I've made. 
`nbopen file.ipynb` returns to prompt if there is a running Jupyter process that it can use.

`nbopen file.ipynb` otherwise starts a new Jupyter process in the foreground, not returning to the prompt.

It would be nice if there was an option to always go into background, e.g. `emacsclient -n` never hangs.
e.g.
`nbopen foo.ipynb` opens the JupyterLab interface if `foo.ipynb` doesn't exist, instead of creating it.

Ideally, it would create an empty file of that name and then open it with jupyter. I bet the tricky bit is that you have to guess at the format of the file based on the name...
nbopen works from the terminal but I have a problem after I install the mac app using the ./osx-install. Once the installation is complete, I get the following error while opening the app.

Not been able to use it as it tries to connect to python forever 
I have installed the nbopen and executed `python3 -m nbopen.install_xdg` but the icons have not changed for .ipynb files.
I recently updated to conda 4.6.4 and nbopen no longer works.
Rolling back the installation fixed nbopen but broke everything else :(
I have this problem when trying to integrate while file management system on Mac (running macOS Mojave). Solution?
