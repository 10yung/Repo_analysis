the signature is in valid for chrome 79 and 32 bit. it can works for chrome78 

1   get the chrome_child.dll or chrome.dll scope of process memory .eg 5fa10000 643b6000

2 0:014> s -b  5fa10000 643b6000 8B 7D 08 31 E8 89 45 F0 8B 47 18 C7 80 98 00 00 00 01
 nothing is found ,




I have updated the signature here
unsigned char Write_Signature32[] = {
		0x55, 0x89, 0xE5, 0x53, 0x57, 0x56, 0x83, 0xEC, 0x08, 0xA1, '?' , '?' , '?' , '?' , 0x8B, 0x7D, 0x08, 0x31, 0xF6, 0x31, 0xE8, 0x89, 0x45, 0xF0, 0x8B, 0x47, 0x18, 0x89, 0xB0, 0x94, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 };

 

Because the h2 protocol is binary, it seems that it may require headers decompression and so on.
Chrome 77_x64: I think the signature has changed:
[ERROR] Cannot get Chrome SSL functions!
Hi there,

Thanks for developing NetRipper.

I am able to intercept  and capture plain-text network traffic and encrypted network traffic before encryption/after decryption successfully..

Was wondering if there are any plans to add traffic modification to NetRipper (Something like Echo Mirage)?

Thank you!
Do you have any plans for Linux and OSX ?
Maybe we can help for that.
But need to change it as a interface and abstractions.
we can use plthook
https://github.com/kubo/plthook
that works on osx and linux also.
But is linux and osx using standard crypto so files?
Can you add support for microsoft edge or tell the functions to hook to sniff before sending ssl requests and after reading ssl requests
Hooking the raw sockets won't give readable text but encrypted
## To do:
- Complet debug log - no MsgBox
- Allow more complex static signatures (use ????)
- Fix Google Chrome functions finding - use static signature
- Fix Putty and WinSCP functions finding - use static signature
- Add support for Windows hot-patching
- Create a thread safe hooking mechanism (thread freeze?)
- Add support for Java applications
- Add support for .NET applications
- Write a complete Metasploit module
- Add support for Internet Explorer, FileZilla, OpenSSL, RDP...
- Add support for x64
- Bypass EMET protections
- Remove unnecessary code
- Full comment code
- Match requests and responses if possible
- Get peers IP addresses and ports if possible
- Save data to PCAP if possible
- Write a documentation paper
- Add regular expression and other plugins (ungzip, spdy, base64, password)
- Support older versions of different software
- Make sure the correct functions are hooked (traffic)
- Hook LoadLibrary and CreateProcess
