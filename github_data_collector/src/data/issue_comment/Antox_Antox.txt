Hi there.
I faced something really strange.
My friend sent me an image, which was a hill root(a plant in RIMWORLD game),  then I just opened it.
Though being only an image, it deleted all my chats and contacts.
As a result, I closed the application and I didn't use it for a rather long(about a week).
Surprisingly my application was in a good condition again!!!!
Could anyone please tell what was that mysterious hill root image?
Thank you very much 
P.S:
You can see that image hereüëáüëá![IMG_20191229_193348_982](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59338805/71559353-285c5700-2a72-11ea-964a-e6654f8f6337.jpg)

Due to the rapid increment of mobile phone hardware performance. The data loading speed is get faster and faster.

So the time for startup logo screen to appear would be extremely short.

The resolution of current logo screen is a little bit low. It would be influence the user experience.

I would like to recommend, that it would be awesome to remove this logo screen.

Or if it is very important to show the logo. I would be also awesome to show a SVG simple logo which is same as the App entry icon with pure color background.
I got the below mentioned error while updating targetSdk to 29.

`error: target API level '28' is out of range ('11' - '24')`

Hi,
I am developing an Android chat application for my college project. So i I am implemented your library ,little bit confusion in  video(clarity) and voice(clarity) calling .cant load proper live video and voice clarity is very poor
Hello, I have noticed that Antox doesn't have a way to verify contacts. Would you be üêù able to add ‚ûï that in some form please? 

Signal Private Messenger calls it a "Safety Number" & Wire calls it a "Key Fingerprint" (because Wire can ü•´ be üêù used on more than one device at a time ‚åö with the same profile/account, although Wire has some problems too, or undesirable features) Verifying a conversation ensures that there's no "man in the middle" and that the messages üìÆ üì¨ üì´ üì§ are really End-to-End Encrypted. 

Thank you 
when importing the project the gradle unable to download the 'com.github.joshjdevl.libsodiumjni:libsodium-jni-aar:1.0.3-snapshot'
It would be nice to have a way that a bot can send a clickable command that is then send back to the bot. for example if the text contains /start that that then is clickable and sends '/start' back to the other party.
Trying to send a file from qTox to Antox, but when the file is being opened through Antox the app crashes and asks to either close the app or to send feedback.

The file looks as if it gets transferred properly, although I'm unsure where the received files are located so I can not verify if it does.

Comments?
My tox id is.. 2AB229053240391C4E02F6A70C9C5D59CBA7C88616681AD68E573414C5ACBD0973E877382822 .      
I lost my tox account , the app wasn't behaving well , I was trying to open it up but it was closing itself , I was trying really hard , I also sent a feed back to company or maybe more than Many but who cares , I really disappointed to this app.

Even before that I could not able to open my photos which I received from my other friends , I lost my really best friend , best friend I ever had or maybe first friend yeah leave that . I have no other option to contact my friend , so it's really bad .
After this all mess I uninstalled the app , and downloaded again but now I require new ID , I was really pissed off  .
I lost my first account , and then I made one more on another device , and also on my device too .
Unfortunately I have my old or lost account little info like tox id 2AB229053240391C4E02F6A70C9C5D59CBA7C88616681AD68E573414C5ACBD0973E877382822
Profile name was Davextoner and name was username . 
I couldn't get time to save my profile or import it , so I just lost that. 
Somehow I found my friend's tox id but he is not coming online , idk what's happening, well he only reply my messages on this app we only talk to each other nothing else .
So I have no idea why is this happening .
Still I have to find my best friend again I am still trying to get him back , well honestly , we are just friends only friends nothing else , he has his beautiful fiance , he is just my best friend which I never had before .
