We need to add the options to edit which columns show.
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently the file menu of the pivot view serves no real purpose. Putting the app settings in that category makes no sense, because they have nothing to do with files directly. 

Additionally, the "Open new window", would better fit into the layout page.

Furthermore, the options "Select all" and "Clear all" can be found in the layout page. They would better fit into the home page next to "copy" and "paste" etc. since these are file operations.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
* Remove file page

* Move the setting button into it's own pivot view page or to the footer of the nav. view as many Microsoft apps do it

* Move "Open new window" to the layout page

* Move "Select all" and "Clear all" into home menu

Yes.. Actually my OneDrive path is D:\OneDrive
and when launch OneDrive from FilesUWP i receive this error message:

_Did you delete  this folder?
The folder you've navigated to was removed_

(Because app search OneDrive on C:\users\...)

**Solution**
So, in settings>preferences it would be useful add option to replace common OneDrive location

**Describe the bug**
In the toolbar, the button to add a new item is called "Add item", however, in the right click context menu, it's simply called "New".



**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Check the toolbar
2. Right click in a folder

**Expected behavior**
Both options should be called "New", same as in the old explorer.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS Version: [e.g. Windows 10 1903 18362.175]
 - App version: [v0.5.0]
For example 
insert 
delete 
remove 
replace 
rearrange
Copying the path always gives a '\' as the path separator. Most programming languages require a double backslash or a slash for file paths. Vice versa copying the path to a file from the IDE to files-uwp doesn't work because it only supports single backslashes.

Could you add the possibility to use slashes in the file path in files-uwp and the possibility to copy the file path from files-uwp with slashes as path separator. This could be set in the options or with a shift click on the "copy path" button.
