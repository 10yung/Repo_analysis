Is possible that the library cannot load in iOS 12?

Thanks!


when iPad link url

Dears, I faced a silly bug when I load this url inside uiwebview , the url load the request successfully at the first then the uiwebview covered with white view except the title of page . Although I tried to load the same page from Safari and chrome and it loaded successfully without any problems. Url is https://www.filgoal.com/home/views?name=comments&type=article&id=287239

Thank you in advance

using iOS 10 simulator from Xcode 8 with Swift 3.0

I'm using the modal to load a site. This site has a few steps at a few different URLs. Once the user reaches a specific URL, I plan on closing the modal.

How can I achieve this?

Added a **SVWebViewControllerDelegate** that inherits from UIWebViewDelegate (so don`t need to change the already implemented code) and it wont affect any production pods installed. Implementing the method "**didPressDoneButton**" will allow to have perform an action once the view is dismissed after pressing done button. 

PS: Any **constructive** feedback is welcome :)
