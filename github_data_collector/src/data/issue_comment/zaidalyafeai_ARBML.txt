Given a word get its root. For example the root of `ÿßŸÑÿßŸÜÿ≥ÿ≠ÿßÿ®` is `ÿ≥ÿ≠ÿ®`.
Given a grammatically false statement output the corrected one.

PS: I don't even know if it was done in other languages
The idea here is to use a machine learning model to automatically add punctuation marks to Arabic text. Those marks are as follows: 
```
!
ÿå
.
?
ÿõ
:
- -
- 
/
```
I do not have a dataset for this. However, I think Tashkela dataset will be a good fit since it contains a large body of Arabic text that is mostly punctuated.
Any thoughts?
Given a paragraph classify it into sport, politics, etc ... 

Given an email classify it into spam or not spam. 
Check this on [Recognition of Historical Arabic Scientific Manuscripts.](https://blogs.bl.uk/digital-scholarship/2019/02/automatic-transcription-of-historical-arabic-scientific-manuscripts-round-2.html). There is some discussion on [fastai](https://forums.fast.ai/t/image-segmentation-and-ocr-for-medieval-arabic-manuscripts/41016/5). 
Given an audio source convert it to a written text. 
Given an image convert it to text. 
Given a statement in Arabic predict the next word. This issue is opened for newcomers. If any one wants two work on this let us know. 
This is a new **Feature** üëç 

I worked on an LSTM model for POS-tagger (you can read about it [Here](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-for-arabic-part-of-speech-tagging-810be7278353))
I'm willing to enhance the model with pre-trained word2vec then add it here.

I'll open a PR as soon as I start!
