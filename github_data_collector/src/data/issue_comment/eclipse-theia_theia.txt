### Description
The text of shell code blocks in Markdown files are rendered white (same as background) in light theme in the text editor (NOT the Markdown preview).

### Reproduction Steps

**Description**

Currently, **dialogs** which have a lot of content are not properly displayed (width-wise).

In order to fix their entire content, the dialog will take up as much width as possible which gives off a poor UX. Instead of placing the responsibility on developers to place carriage returns, the application should define proper `max-width` rules to enforce a consistent layout. 

Developers are still free to extend existing dialogs in order to style them as they so choose.

For example:

<div align='center'>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359487/72611827-1810fc80-38f9-11ea-94b3-94793fd09ee3.png)

</div>

To align Git state markers in the Navigator with VS Code we can:
- replace the letters on folders with the dot/circle sign indicating that files inside are modified. It looks more clear and less noisy in VS Code
- if it's possible, apply the different color styles to the file names depending on the Git status
