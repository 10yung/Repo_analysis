Hey,

Think I've done everything correctly, after starting the server and web just not seeing anything in browser. No errors on Chrome console. 

Thanks,
Rich

Hey, do you create 1 loader for each type of `entity` and that's enough? no need for separate loaders for subqueries? So if you query 
```GQL
{Article (where: {id: 1})
    {
        Comments  { id }  
    }
}
```
, if you have a `CommentLoader` that will load as only 2 SQL calls?

Or do we need a `CommentByArticleLoader` to only be used with this query?
