I am currently using this command to lock the screen

`betterlockscreen --lock -- --timepos=x+140:h-70 --timestr="%I:%M:%S %p"`

Once locked, it shows the time as "10:22:47", without the AM/PM. It is also pushed about two spaces to the right.

This issue does not occur when using a non-whitespace character as a separator, so, `%I:%M:%S-%p` works.
I want to add some more information to lock screen like date, nm-applet(or connection properties), but there is no way to do it in the current state.

I normally use Win+Space to change my keyboard layout.

Everytime I forgot to change it back to "En" and my screen is locked, I can't change my keyboard layout. So I can't enter my password and lock back in.

Maybe a setting to automatically change keyboard layout to "En" when screen is lock would be great.
As the title states, I've been trying to get the lock to exit the menu after I make a choice, so when I log back in I don't accidentally log out or something.

```
bindsym $mod+0 mode "$mode_system"
set $mode_system (l)ock, (e)xit, switch_(u)ser, (s)uspend, (h)ibernate, (r)eboot, (Shift+s)hutdown
mode "$mode_system" {
    bindsym l exec betterlockscreen -l dimblur
    bindsym s exec betterlockscreen -s dimblur
    bindsym u exec --no-startup-id i3exit switch_user, mode "default"
    bindsym e exec --no-startup-id i3exit logout, mode "default"
    bindsym h exec betterlockscreen -l && systemctl hibernate
    bindsym r exec --no-startup-id i3exit reboot, mode "default"
    bindsym Shift+s exec --no-startup-id i3exit shutdown, mode "default"

    # exit system mode: "Enter" or "Escape"
    bindsym Return mode "default"
    bindsym Escape mode "default"
}
```

Any idea how can I achieve this? It used to work when I used to run `bindsym l exec --no-startup-id i3exit lock, mode "default"`
Hello, I got betterlockscreen-git from the AUR on archlinux. I am having a 2560x1440 screen and I tried different wallpaper exactly the same size.

The box is kind of misaligned or too small, the circle is also outside the box.
Maybe you can look into it sometime.
update_color() generated images based on hex color provided as
argument
betterlockscreen -c "#8abeb7" : Generates images (l_color.png and
color.png) with background color as "#8abeb7"
betterlockscreen -l color : Locks screen with background image l_color.png

Resolves: #135
This flag displays the current keyboard layout next to the time.

Intends to close https://github.com/pavanjadhaw/betterlockscreen/issues/107

Very small changes in order to display the keyboard layout on the lockscreen as cleanly as possible. The perfect way to do it would be to change the size of the rectangle on update(), but that is way too complex and unnecessary for an option like this in my opinion.

Another solution would be to use `setxkbmap -query` in order to always get two-letters code (us, fr, cn, ru, ...) and not i3lock's *--keylayout* option that displays (us, french, chinese, ...). Let me know what you think.
I've been searching for screensavers and noticed that some of them offered to block tty access as well, obviously none of them was has good looking as this one, so i think this would be a nice feature to be added.
I'm using Gentoo with openRC so the "-s" option doesn't work.
Currently I'm using pm-utils with a hook like this:
 
```bash

#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This file is a pm-utils hook to start betterlockscreen when suspend/hibernate is started
# This file goes in /etc/pm/sleep.d/ and must have execution permission.

# "-s" here is needed for whatever reason, without it betterlockscreen will start and 
# lock the suspend process until I provide my password 

case $1 in
    hibernate|suspend)
        su USER -c "betterlockscreen -s --lock blur";;
esac
```

It works but I wonder if it would be possible to integrate it in the script itself.
