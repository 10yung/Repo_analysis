Currently running on MISP 2.4.108, and I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to add multiple tags to an event in a single API call. I haven't found anything documented for this yet.

I'm attempting to minimize the total number of API calls required, and using individual calls to /events/addTag for each tag is slowing things down with the total number of events+tags that I have.
Looking for some guidance for this use case. Thanks in advance!

We'd like to setup a cron job that performs queries using `search_logs()` to pull data from various instances remotely and aggregate the results for local use, e.g. usage or ingestion stats. The MISP user should be restricted to basically only being able to run `search_logs`. Ideally this user should be able to pull rows from the db `logs` table for all orgs. As I see it, the `LogsController` restricts access to only the user's org unless the user's role is `Site Admin`. However, we do not want the user to have those admin wide privileges.

Is there anyway to create a user + role (`Audit`, `Auth`) that will be restricted to running only `search_logs` but with access to all orgs to pull stats on Models like Events and Attributes.

If not, then is our only solution to create a user for each org of interest in that restricted role? This is a bit painful, as we add new orgs when adding feeds (for use with Sharing Groups), and managing new search-logs users would be _inconvenient_.


On https://misp.github.io/MISP/Changelog/ I see:
```
[API] Added rate limiting option to the API. [iglocska]
```
And I see `Enforce search rate limit` on `admin/roles/add` when clicked has `# of searches / 15 min.` This seems like a useful feature. Thanks.

I was not able to find more details on how this works, e.g. is this for WebUI search, PyMISP API searches, etc. Is there an issue or a doc that explains more?

I did try a test setting up a Role with the limit set to 1, but was able to perform unlimited `PyMISP.search_logs()` requests with a user of the Role.

Note for others: there is a fix if you play with this. See https://github.com/MISP/MISP/pull/5445
**Describe the solution you'd like**
It's already possible to have a default tag collection for newly created events but it would be great if this is also available for newly added attributes.

The default tag collection should be configurable per attribute type, for example 'filename: cat1,cat2' ; 'md5:cat3,cat4'.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Make the window to add push/pull rules resizeable. It's difficult to differentiate between tags starting with the same text/string.

Dears,

 I have a quick question, Is MISP Feeds System enough? Do we need to add any other external & custom feeds?

What is your advice?

Best Regards.
I'm installing MISP core on Ubuntu 18.04 using the commands:

wget -O /tmp/INSTALL.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MISP/MISP/2.4/INSTALL/INSTALL.sh
bash /tmp/INSTALL.sh -c

during installation I came across the following:

_pymisp.exceptions.NoKey: Please provide your authorization key_

Nevertheless, it was installed but there is no access URL. The message is:

_MISP Installed, access here: ""_

Some default feeds are no longer valid,  whether to consider deleting them?

thanks.
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
If you delete a known remote organization (2nd tab) the screen returns to local organizations (1st tab). 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
For better UI it would be an improvement if the screen returns to the 2nd tab (remote) after the delete.
If you delete local organization it can remain like it is, and return to the 1st tab. 

This makes deleting multiple organization sequentially much faster.

### Expected behavior
I expect the Event list filter to be able to search for any string. Unfortunately, strings containing "://X" (without quotes and X being any non-empty string) will break the URL parsing of the resulting search page.

### Actual behavior
When a filter is created for e.g. "http:// " (note the whitespace) the request is being made to a URL of a form: "https://MISPURL/events/index/searchall:http:// ". This triggers wrong routing resulting in a CakePHP error message: 

> **Not Found**
> **Error**: The requested address '**/http://?%2Fevents%2Findex%2Fsearchall%3Ahttp%3A%2F=**' was not found on this server.

Interestingly enough, when searching for a urlencoded version of that string by directly GETing "https://MISPURL/events/index/searchall:http%3a%2f%2f+" it still ends up with an error, but a 404 Apache-kind:

> **Object not found!**
> The requested URL was not found on this server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.
> 
> If you think this is a server error, please contact the webmaster.
> 
> Error 404
> MISPURL
> Apache

### Steps to reproduce the behavior
Go to "List Events" page and enter "http://foo" (without quotes) in the filter field.
