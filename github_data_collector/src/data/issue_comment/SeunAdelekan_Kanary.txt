Why do I need to have an 'on' for every controller?

How do I define routes like

`localhost:8080/hello` => print hello world

or

`localhost:8080/api/messages` => get all messages

`localhost:8080/api/users` => get all users

or 

`localhost:8080/books` get all books
I like this library - it is easy to use and reason about

Wanted to know how does it compare in performance to other frameworks such as ktor or vertx?
I have a basic application with a few classes, and I tried to benchmark with a simple 
```kotlin
    override fun handle(baseRequest: Request, request: HttpServletRequest, response: HttpServletResponse) {
        response.withStatus(200).sendJson(JsonCreator.from(value = TestReturn("Hello, world")))
        baseRequest.done()
    }
```

I did 10K requests at 100 requests, and it took a *long* time.

Using a localhost, is that the problem? Am I doing the whole scaling thing wrong?

Is it possible to integrate Swagger? http://swagger.io/
