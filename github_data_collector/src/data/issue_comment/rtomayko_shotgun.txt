old rack link is dead
This PR introduces the explanation from #69 into the README's Compatibility section.

This helps users on latest macOS.
This PR

- fixes an old hyperlink which pointed at rack on RubyForge (in the man page and in the README)
- amends the changelog section of the man page
- regenerates the man page

Hello,

This gem no longer works on macOS High Sierra.

I noticed it is only compatible with systems that support fork(2) and High Sierra does change how fork() works on syscall level.

Set the default host to localhost instead of 127.0.0.1 for  simultaneous listening on ipv4 and ipv6

ENV

```
  ruby 2.2.0p0 (2014-12-25 revision 49005) [x86_64-linux]
  shotgun-0.9.1
  rack-1.6.1
  thin-1.6.3
```

Simple config.ru

``` ruby
  map '/' do
    p "root"
    run Proc.new {|env| [200, {"Content-Type" => "text/html"}, ["root"]]}
  end

  map "/assets" do
    p "assets"
    run Proc.new {|env| [200, {"Content-Type" => "text/html"}, ["assets"]]}
  end

  map "/admin" do
    p "admin"
    run Proc.new {|env| [200, {"Content-Type" => "text/html"}, ["admin"]]}
  end
```

Run shotgun server

```
  $ shotgun
```

Hit the server:

```
  $ curl http://localhost:9393/
  root
```

Server log output

```
  == Shotgun/Thin on http://127.0.0.1:9393/
  Thin web server (v1.6.3 codename Protein Powder)
  Maximum connections set to 1024
  Listening on 127.0.0.1:9393, CTRL+C to stop
  "root"
  "assets"
  "admin"
  127.0.0.1 - - [15/Jun/2015:18:52:52 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 - 0.0008
```

This is really nasty when I use shotgun with sinatra and sprockets:
every asset request hits whole application and slow down page loading a lot

Is it by design?

All of Rack's option parsing and other rackup related stuff has been moved to a nice little `Rack::Server` class:

http://github.com/rack/rack/commit/5db5d4e7432d026a7bddf344f97e8facd09128d8

This should let us remove a huge swath of code from `bin/shotgun`.
