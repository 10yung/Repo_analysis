Looks like it doesn't use markdown files anymore and  content is stored in php files.

Looks simple and functional, though had some issues with markdown being rendered effectively as output.

For example code blocks didn't work in markdown whereas inline code formatting worked.

Looking for some feedback from others who have used this version.
I'm still running Dropplets v1, and love it, but I could not find the online docs today.

I was looking for the definition of what goes on the second and fourth lines of the YAML header of posts:

```
# Title
- Author
- ?
- 2019-06-28
- Foo, Bar
- published
```

What goes on line 2 again?

And is it correct to have several tags (or categories?) on line 4?
You've got this function here:

```php
function test_input($data) {
        $data = trim($data);
        $data = stripslashes($data);
        $data = htmlspecialchars($data);
        return $data;
    }
```

You should consider changing it to:

```php
function test_input($data) {
        $data = trim($data);
        $data = stripslashes($data);
        $data = htmlspecialchars($data, ENT_QUOTES);
        return $data;
    }
```

Or just htmlentities it entirely if possible.
