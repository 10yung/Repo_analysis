Hi,

First of all, congratulation on this fantastic work. I honestly believe the pros at NBA are going to check these charts out quite a bit. You can get _a lot_ of information out of them, and very intuitively so.

Have you considered allowing users to not filter by season, therefore getting stats for a player's entire career? I'm sure many would like to see that. I think you can take that a step further and do charts that compare a player's performance against his own, across his career, highlighting good and bad years. It should allow us to see when a player peaked and compare his performance across different teams.

Anyway, keep up the good work!
