This PR was created as a result of this issue: https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks/issues/1145

Adding this file with the same default settings that are in the "SW night configuration" page fixes an issue where even if
auto night mode is enabled it does not seem to work.  

This also fixes an error in `/var/log/lighttpd-cgi-stderr.log` when auto night mode is enabled, the error is `cat: can't open '/system/sdcard/config/autonight.conf': No such file or directory`

If anyone has suggestions on what these settings do I'd love to add them to the file.
I just received 2x Xiaofang 1S, turns out T20L. I tried to scan the QR codes on the box and at bottom of the camera. Both of them have MAC address and model number.

For example, in my hands,
- Xiaofang 1S T20L, MAC starts with 44:23:7C, model number D01C0017
- Original Xiaofang, MAC starts with 34:CE:00, model number C01C0003

And I tried the QR codes from the other T20L thread, https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks/issues/1128#issuecomment-554783629
- Xiaofang 1S T20L, MAC starts with 34:CE:00, model number Y01C0017
- Xiaofang 1S T20L, MAC starts with 78:11:DC, model number D01C0017

Should we build a model number database, so people can use the model number to choose which firmware to flash?

Hi @EliasKotlyar ,

First of all, nice work, thank you very much for sharing it with all of us :-)

Is there any way to rotate 90º or 270º the image? I know there is a flip option (180º), but it would be interesting also to being able to rotate 90º or 270º.

In case it is not possible, is it very hard to implement it? May you consider implement it, please?

Regards,

Hello,

Just finished installing the hack on a Wyze V2.

I can access the web gui. And video is working.

But video is lagging badly like 4-5 seconds.

I played with video size, video format, framerate and bitrate. Nothing seems to give enough to reduce lagging.

Any tips?

Regards,

Yves

Hi!
I've configured Zoneminder, I've added the Xiaomi.pm file and the controls show on screen, but when clicking on it the log registers the following error:

2019-12-18 20:40:35 | zmcontrol |   | 93883 | ERR | Error check failed:'500 Can't connect to 192.168.1.69:443 (certificate verify failed)' | zmcontrol.pl

Thank you in advance.



I'm trying the advanced install on the original Xiaomi Dafang (128MB)
I already installed U-boot bootloader (or so does it shows when I boot the firmware_mod, it shows U-Boot SPL 2013.07-gba03eeb (Dec 04 2018 - 21:41:16)), but when I format the SDcard on ext3 format with my ubuntu machine, I can't write anything on it.
I've chmodded the SD card to 777, in order to be able to write files, but then the camera doesn't boots.
In fact, I've noticed it makes the original boot because the camera starts moving and connects to the last Wifi AP I configured with the official firmware, and not to the Wifi AP I've configured in the wpa_supplicant file, but I don't know if this is even possible if I flashed the U-Boot successfully (how can I check it anyways?).

I don't know if there's some fixing needed with permissions/ownership.

Also I've noticed that uEnv files are different from the standard firmware mod, because the paths are different: advanced install (root=/dev/mmcblk0p1) firmware_mod(root=/dev/mtdblock2)
Anyway, the firmware_mod requires the uEnv.txt at root, but the advanced install shows uEnv_dafang128.txt at root. What is the path should I use?
I consider myself tech savvy and the instructions are pretty straightforward, but I can't figure it out to work.

At last, the uEnv files are showing some IP addresses which I find unacceptable in an open firmware like this.

I recently tried to connect to a other samba server for footage storage. <br>
So I edited the motion config file and then rebooted. Weird enough the camera took a unusal long time to reboot and then did not connect to the samba share. The samba share is accessible form my Fedora desktop and macBook without any problems. <br>
Next I started playing around with fstab and cifs which does not work at all. So after sometime I played around with `smbclient`. Evertime I did something with the `smbclient` I got this error:  <br>
```
params.c:OpenConfFile() - Unable to open configuration file "/usr/samba/config/smb.conf":No such file or directory
Can't load /usr/samba/config/smb.conf - run testparm to debug it
load_client_codepage: filename /usr/samba/lib/codepages/codepage.850 does not exist.

load_unicode_map: filename /usr/samba/lib/codepages/unicode_map.ISO8859-1 does not exist.
```

Is this normal or did the smb.conf go missing?
I've installed the hack in my dafang and all is working well.
I can't view the recorded file in the sd via http or ftp.
The only mode to view the file was by the removed sd in my pc.

Was present a semplification mode in the hack to view the file via remote?
I have Xiaomi DaFang and it has very good night vision via Xiaomi app. But when I see over RTSP with firmware is just a big black noise. I tried everything (IR-LED IR-CUT on/off etc) but I cant get good night quality. What am I doing wrong?
