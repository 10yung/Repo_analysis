I have noticed you have the exact same problem I do in my emulator, which is that during the Zelda title screen, the pulse waves cut out too quickly; there is a bit of a gap that should not be there. Just thought I'd point it out in case you can figure out the root cause before I do; I suspect we may have used the same docs to write our APUs, and maybe there is a problem in the documentation. I have determined that in my emu, the pulse length counter hits 0 too quickly, but not sure why.
