Hi

Trying to adjust some local gp settings, script works just fine when executed directly on a machine, but not with intune. The script is executed successfully, but nothing happends to the local GP. The scripts includes installing of nuget and the PolicyFileEditor module, this has been tested and works.

Also there seems to be an issue with a computer that is AzureAD joined, here the computer will have an empty GroupPolicy folder, until someone manually initializes the directory. Is there any way to initialize or will the powershell module do this ?
 
Script:
$UserPolicy = 'C:\windows\system32\GroupPolicy\User\Registry.pol'
$Ctx_Files_Key = 'Software\Policies\Citrix\Citrix Files'

 Set-PolicyFileEntry -Path $UserPolicy -Key $Ctx_Files_Key -ValueName 'Account' -Type String -Data 'server-name-1'
    
    Set-PolicyFileEntry -Path $UserPolicy -Key $Ctx_Files_Key -ValueName 'MountPoint3-DisplayName' -Type String -Data 'Citrix Files Area 3'
    Set-PolicyFileEntry -Path $UserPolicy -Key $Ctx_Files_Key -ValueName 'MountPoint3-ShareFile' -Type String -Data 'Shared Folders\\Folder3'
    Set-PolicyFileEntry -Path $UserPolicy -Key $Ctx_Files_Key -ValueName 'MountPoint3-Local' -Type String -Data 'k:'

    Set-PolicyFileEntry -Path $UserPolicy -Key $Ctx_Files_Key -ValueName 'MountPoint4-DisplayName' -Type String -Data 'Citrix Files Area 4'
    Set-PolicyFileEntry -Path $UserPolicy -Key $Ctx_Files_Key -ValueName 'MountPoint4-ShareFile' -Type String -Data 'Shared Folders\\Folder4'
    Set-PolicyFileEntry -Path $UserPolicy -Key $Ctx_Files_Key -ValueName 'MountPoint4-Local' -Type String -Data 'l:'

I have just started using the PolicyFileEditor module for my DSC work and it
does exactly what I need.

One feature that I would like to see is the ability to write into the 'Comment'
area of each Administrative Setting. That way, I can leave some notes in a
`gpresult /H` output file if anybody ever were to look at the Windows machine
that was configured via DSC + PolicyFileEditor.

Is this possible to implement at all?

If so, how complex would this be to implement?
Hello, 

Thanks for your wonderful module!!

I have noticed a problem when attempting to enable the USB RemoteFX USB Redirection feature when using your policy. What I have found is that the PolicyFileEditor module does correctly set configuration in the GUI if the GPEDIT.msc console, and it does appear to create the registry key, but yet whatever other back end "magic" that happens when you manually enable the feature in the GUI is not happening when using PolicyFileEditor module.

Here is an example. Run the following command:
` set-PolicyFileEntry -path $env:systemroot\system32\GroupPolicy\Machine\registry.pol -Key 'SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services\Client' -ValueName "fUsbRedirectionEnableMode" -Data '2' -Type DWord`

When you check the GPEDIT.msc configuration under` Computer Configuration\Windows Components\ Remote Desktop Services \ Remote Desktop Client Connection \ RemoteFX USB Device Redirection\Allow RDP Derection of other supported RemoteFX USB devices from this computer` you will see that it is correctly set to "Enabled" for "Administrators and Users". 

However, it doesn't actually work. You can know this by opening the Device Manager and selecting your USB Host Controller (Example: Intel USB Host Controller) and clicking the Driver Tab, and selecting "Driver Details". When the RemoteFX USB Redirection feature correctly enables, you will see C:|WINDOWS\system32\drivers\tsusbflt.sys listed as one of the driver files. 

To demonstrate how it should work, you can manually open GPEDIT.msc and go to the configuration listed above and "disable" or "not configure" it. Click Apply. Then, select "Enabled" for "Users and Administrators". Click Apply. Now check your driver files and you will see that the tsusbflt.sys driver file is immediately added - even without a reboot or GPUPDATE. 

I guess my question is - how can someone figure out what other "magic" is happening behind the scenes other than the registry key that gets set (which doesn't appear to paint the whole picture)?

Hi,
I have 100s of computers for which I need to read some setting from local group policy. Can this script be used on remote computers?
Hi, thanks for the module. It's very good. The help text from about_RegistryValuesForAdminTemplates.Help.txt was very helpful.

I found that when I set a local policy group option, the machine didn't update it's policy until after a reboot or until I ran the command `gpupdate /force`

So for instance, I ran the command
`Set-PolicyFileEntry $env:systemroot\system32\GroupPolicy\Machine\registry.pol -Key 'Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer' -ValueName 'NoNewAppAlert' -Data 1 -Type DWord`

The affect didn't take place until after I ran `gpupdate /force`

I think this is fine but I didn't see anyway in the help information or documentation on set-PolicyFileEntry that you need to then call gpupdate/reboot.

Is this expected behaviour of the module?
The process cannot access the file 'C:\\\\Program Files\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\Modules\\\\PolicyFileEditor\\\\PolicyFileEditor\\\\PolFileEditor.dll' because it is being used by another process.
I can see from the source code that comment-based help should exist for, at least, Set-PolicyFileEntry, but after installing the module (v3.0.1) from PSGallery on a Win10 1709 machine, doing a `Get-Help Set-PolicyFileEntry -showwindow' is only giving me the basic, auto-generated help.  That leads me to think there might be something wrong with the help block, but I haven't found it yet. 

I'm going to fork the project and see what I can see in VSCode, and if I find something I'll make a pull request.

I just wanted you to be aware that I'm looking at it.  If it's some sort of known issue, feel free to wave me off.
Is it possible to provide some documentation and examples?

I want to use the DSC Resource , but is not that easy to understand how to use it (even after checking `Get-DscResource -Syntax cAccountAdministrativeTemplateSetting`)

I would like to change some setting in `Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Session Host\Licensing`. How do I do this?
