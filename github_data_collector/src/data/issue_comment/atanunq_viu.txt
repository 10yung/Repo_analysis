Not sure if I am missing something,

Installed like this:
`cargo install viu`

then opened an image like this:
`viu ~/Desktop/tenor.gif`

The quality is like this:

with [sixel](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h2-Sixel-Graphics), you can get better resolutions of images.
Currently, I'm using `dcraw` and `cjpeg` commands to decode and convert raw image file, then pipe to viu:
`dcraw -c -w <raw_image_file> | cjpeg | viu `

It works, but with a bit patient, about 2-3s waiting time for displaying a raw iamge. It would run faster I believe, if viu could support raw images by default, like .cr2, .sr2, .dng...

Here is a site containing different raw files for testing https://rawsamples.ch/index.php/en/

It could be useful to be able to use viu as an image viewer for terminal apps. E.g.: https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs/issues/143
I'm trying to get it work with ranger cli file manager, only by replacing the img2txt with viu.
But it gives garbled render of the image. Can you maybe help with a possible solution to this?

Here is `viu` output:

Here is `viu` in ranger preview:

Something below can not build in windows, I am trying to reimplement it with crossterm.

1. libc::ioctl
2. libc::SIGPIPE
3. libc::SIG_DFL
