#### Software versions

 - OS:                        ([e.g. macOS 10.14] the operating system you're running ArchiveBox on)
 - ArchiveBox version:        (`git rev-parse HEAD | head -c7` [e.g. d798117] commit ID of the version you're running)
 - Python version:            (`python3 --version` [e.g. 3.7.0])

#### Describe the bug
I use the environmental variables to output the script into a specific dir. But the env variables cause the archivebox break ant throw the error below:


#### Steps to reproduce
My command script is as below:

Greetings,

and thanks in advance for any comment on what follows. I would really need a real solution to this problem that makes ArchiveBox less useful, I can't be the only one to have it, and don't know where else to ask...

An "archive" of a web page should be a version of that page that looks and feels as much as possible as the original, **even when that page is loaded**:

* today, in a browser **totally disconnected from the Internet**. Or...
* twenty years from now, in an emulator of today's browsers, when the original website and all its auxiliary resources may be long dead.

If the archived page does not passes those tests, it has little or no value, because it is still dependent on third party resources that may disappear any moment.

A month ago, I filed an issue here because I found out that wget, as used in ArchiveBox, was not passing those tests (for details, see filed an issue here (https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/issues/276). Immediately after that discussion...

1. I searched online again, and found no real solution to that problem. The web is full of pages (some 10 years old) claiming to know how to solve the problem above, but if you look at them, they just copy from each other the same options we discussed here one month ago. I've archived some thousands pages while filing that issue here, and can confirm those options fail way too often to do what they promise.
2. So, in parallel, I asked ["how to make wget always create REALLY complete, REALLY offline copies of web pages](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-wget/2019-10/msg00003.html) directly to the wget developers. The result? Zero answers, after one month.

Summarizing, what I have taken home so far is that wget cannot do real, useful archives, or at least nobody knows how to use it to that purpose,  and that this issue raised more interest here than on the wget list. So this seems the best place to ask: am I missing something? Or is it time to replace wget with something else, both in and outside of ArchiveBox? If so, with what?

For example: Firefox/chrome plugins like SingleFile save whole page as ONE HTML file, with javascript, images and even video if you want, embedded inside it. Technically, it should be possible to add to the archivebox container that plugin, and code (selenium?) that, instead of calling wget, tells the browser "save this page with singlefile". Besides being above my own skills, however, this approach has the big problem that would make impossible the deduplication of identical images, scripts etc... across different pages, thus creating much, much bigger archives. Thoughts?

#### Software versions

 - OS: NixOS 19.09
 - ArchiveBox version: v0.4.2 (downloaded from Pypi)
 - Python version: v3.7
 - Chrome version: v77.0.3865.120

#### Describe the bug
After installing in editable mode on branch `v0.4.3`, running `archivebox init` results in an exception
> django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: The SECRET_KEY setting must not be empty.

The directions I followed were basically these: https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Roadmap#-pip-install-archivebox

#### Steps to reproduce
1. `git clone https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox.git && cd ArchiveBox && git checkout v0.4.3`
2. `pyenv local 3.7.4`
3. `pipenv install && pipenv shell`
4. `pip install -e .`
5. `mkdir data && chmod 777 data && cd data`
6. `archivebox init`

After running the last step, I get the above error. At that point the `ArchiveBox.conf` file has already been created with something like:
```conf
[SERVER_CONFIG]
SECRET_KEY = abc123
```

Possibly I'm missing it but is CI enabled via one of the providers?

(I'm not seeing anything running for the PR I just opened in #281.)

If all it is is running the commands from https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-tests I'm happy to send a PR adding that too.
Hi,

(writing this as regular issue because I am not sure if it's a bug, or what else...)

I am running the docker image of archivebox, as explained in the archivebox wiki. Works fine... except every now and then it leaves big core files , named "core.NNN". Why does this happen, and what should I do, if anything?

Thanks!
Greetings, and thanks for ArchiveBox! It looks really interesting.

So far, my only issue with it is that it does not makes local copies of **all** the images** embedded in a page, only those hosted on the same server.

As an example, when I told the archivebox docker container to archive this article https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/29/legal-weed-cannabis-vaping-deaths :

![Selection_003](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6323914/65869219-4da9ce00-e37a-11e9-9edd-786e2291b6e4.png)

with this command:

echo 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/29/legal-weed-cannabis-vaping-deaths' | docker run -i -v ~/archivebox-testing:/data nikisweeting/archivebox

I got an output.html file that DOES include/points to a LOCAl copy on my own server of the big image on the left, but not of the round thumbnails in the right sidebar. If I right-click on any of them and select "copy image location", I do not get, as I would like, a link like "./some-local-jpg-file.jpg". I get the location of the original image on another server, i.e. "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61755ffc1366344f6b820fa918 ..." This means that if I used the archive on a computer disconnected from the internet, I would not see those thumbnails.

Can this behaviour be changed? I remember wget had some option for this, but IIRC it does not always work well in these cases.

Thanks in advance for any feedback.
