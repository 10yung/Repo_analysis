Please, upload a full source of java for this project. Many of us who code in java can't understand the kotlin code, there is not enough source to convert kotlin to java. The ByteCode are also so confusing. Please, update it for java also. 
Why it is showing this type of behaviour on Oppo Device even the device is having latest OS and also on some devices it works fine?

I have used this library and set its onShowLisener and its OnClickMenuListener it works for many times but for sometimes when one item selected it does not work and by second or third click it'll work.
thanks

// when click on item 3  , set current item = 1
bottomNavigation.show(1,true);

This function has a problem
