I use requireJS , JQ3.4.1 and JQ Mobile 1.5.0-alpha
my code like this.
```javascript
require.config({
  paths: {
    jquery: '/jquery',
    'jquery.mobile': '/jquery.mobile-1.5.0-alpha.min',
    'jquery.mobile-config': '/jquery.mobile-config',
  },
  shim: {
    'jquery.mobile-config': ['jquery'],
    'jquery.mobile': ['jquery', 'jquery.mobile-config']
  }
})

require(['jquery', 'jquery.mobile'...], function($, ...) {
...
$("body").bind("keyup", function(e) {
        if (e.which === 13) {
            $("#login").tap();
        }
});
$("#login").bind("tap", onLoginTap);
...
})
```
I didn't know why throw err '$(...).tap is not a function'
Example code:
```
$(document).on("swipeleft", function(e) {
    console.log("Swipe left detected");
});
$(document).on("swiperight", function(e) {
    console.log("Swipe right detected");
});
```
And the viewport metatag in the html:
```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

Steps to reproduce:
1. On a real mobile device, pinch-zoom (ignore issue 8658 if it happens at this stage)
2. Use one finger to drag and move the visual viewport around left and right

Make sure that the zoom is high enough (i.e. the layout viewport is much bigger than the visual viewport) and that you test all three scenarios:

2.a. Make one single dragging motion (e.g. to the left) such that during the whole motion from beginning to end, you are dragging the visual viewport
2.b. Make one single dragging motion such that, when you start, you are dragging the viewport; then, while you are moving, the visual viewport reaches the limit that it can't move past - e.g., if you are dragging left, the right border of the visual viewport comes to touch the right border of the layout viewport and any further movement of your finger can't move the viewport further, so it stops, but you keep dragging; so the second half of your dragging motion has no effect
2.c. After that, when the layout viewport is moved all the way to the left, or in other words the visual viewport is all the way to the right, do one other whole drag motion with the finger towards the left, as if to attempt to move the layout further, which you can't do, so the whole of your movement is actually a "swipe" that doesn't move anything.

Expected:
2.a should NEVER trigger a swipe event
2.b. should NEVER trigger a swipe event
2.c. should trigger a swipe event

Observed:
2.b systematically trigger a swipe event, at least when you get past the point where you can't keep dragging the viewport, but your dragging motion continues. That's understandable, meaning an understandable mistake, yet a mistake.
2.a **sometimes** triggers a swipe event. I'd say most of the time it doesn't. It seems utterly random. That's complete nonsense
2.c. triggers a swipe event, that's as expected.

Overall, the swipe events are pathetically unreliable and effectively unusable.
Example code:
```
$(document).on("swipeleft", function(e) {
    console.log("Swipe left detected");
});
$(document).on("swiperight", function(e) {
    console.log("Swipe right detected");
});
```
And the viewport metatag in the html:
```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

Steps to reproduce:
1. On a real mobile device, pinch-zoom

Expected:
shouldn't ever trigger a swipe left or right event, because you are using TWO fingers. That makes it obvious that it is not a swipe gesture

Observed:
sometimes randomly triggers a swipe event while you are pinch-zooming.

I'm under the impression that you're just testing for a touch event doing a drag motion of a length and/or speed above a certain threshold, regardless of whether there are other touch points at the same time.

Instead, you should add the condition that the finger touching and dragging is the only finger present.
Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to https://jquerymobile.com/download/

The first thing it says is "we **RECOMMEND** using our Download Builder (links to it)...", so:

2. Follow the link to https://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/

Expected:
Should be able to use the fucking download builder

Observed:

The spinning icon keeps spinning forever and there's nothing you can build *or* download.


I think this JS error in the console might be the culprit:
```

Perhaps not the correct place to report a demo error, but on this page:
https://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/selectmenu-custom-filter/
when trying to use the "Long list" example, the custom select opens, but cannot be closed.

Clicking the "x" does nothing, and selecting an option does nothing.

The dev console displays this error message:
`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'jqmData' of undefined`

I have also tried reproducing the example in my own code and get the same error.

When I try to using jqm 1.4.5 on IOS 13 webview by Cordova, the multiple selectmenu has some issue. My page is long than screen size, and the select button is at the bottom of the page. When I open or close the select wizard, the page will scroll to top.
Update require.js to 2.3.6
PhantomJs is no longer supported... Are there plans to exchange it?
