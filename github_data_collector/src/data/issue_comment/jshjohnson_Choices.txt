Hello

Thank you for your efforts writing this module and open sourcing it.

Unfortunately, when testing the 'latest' (`9.0.1` ?) version, I type `lend` and the following option is returned:

`-3- Industrial (170769) > Farming & Agriculture (11748) > Food Dehydrators (170763)`

... whilst this is filtered out:

`-3- Baby (2984) > Feeding (20400) > Food Grinders & Blenders (32866)`

---

Also, simply typing "blenders" or "Blenders" fails to return the above option.

Perhaps an issue with handling entitized (`&amp;`) ampersands in `<option>` text?
**Describe the bug**
my `dataset` bounded to the `option` are lost

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a native select, add dataset on one or more options
2. initialize Choices
3. look at the `<option>` source
4. Only value remains

**Expected behavior**
Getting all properties or at least bounded on `Choices` object

**Additional context**
[A fiddle to reproduce](https://jsfiddle.net/klesk/a8pcfwk6/)

Using Choices for a while and now I want to implement remote search. 
The list of users is over 100k, so external load and search is needed.

But it loses focus on every keystroke when typing.
Please see jsfiddle example: https://jsfiddle.net/8zn132go/9/

```
var config = {
  'searchResultLimit': 15,
  'searchChoices': false
};
var select = document.getElementById('users');
var choice = new window.Choices(select, config);
select.addEventListener('search', function(event) {
    if (event.detail.value) {
        choice.setChoices(function(callback) {
            return fetch(
                // below api is only used for this example. it doesn't support query filtering, but its returns some data. 
                'https://randomuser.me/api/?results=20&q=' + event.detail.value
            )
            .then(function(response) {
                return response.json();
            })
            .then(function(data) {
                return data.results.map(function(user) {
                    return { value: user.login.uuid, label: user.name.first };
                });
            });
        })
    }
});
```
Hi @jshjohnson 

Following issue https://github.com/jshjohnson/Choices/issues/591 , I recently faced a similar issue with event target when using choicesjs (via formio) inside a webcomponent with shadow dom.

`event.target` refers to the whole webcomponent, whereas `event.path[0]` contains the clicked element, causing some focus lost on our drop down lists, and the inability to select values..

Any hint about this ? Thanks
**Describe the bug**
Clearing the choices will remove all ! Placeholder too.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a Choice from an select with a placeholder (option with value="")
2. programmatically Choice.clearChoices()
3. All is removed

**Expected behavior**
Have a choice to keep or not the placeholder


Hi,

It is not supported by IE v.11.165.17134.0

There are errors on IE 11:
- it doesn't recognize Array.includes() and neither Array.from ( I added polyfills for them, therefore it is not that critical) 
- after the polyfills quick fix it gives a new error: _Object doesn't support property or method 'findIndex'_ for line **var firstEnabledChoiceIndex = choices.findIndex(function (choice) {**

**Describe the bug**
The hideDropdown event is fired twice when a choice is clicked in a single select mode. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/elated-cartwright-lck60
2. Open the console
3. Click on any choice
4. Observe two "hide" messages printed

**Expected behavior**
hideDropdown is only called once

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: macOS
 - Browser chrome
 - Version 79.0.3945.79

**Describe the bug**
If setting `shouldSort: false` selected key in array of choices data - not working.

Thanks for choices.js !

How do I change the options dynamicly. For instance:
Select 1 contains countries, select 2 contains regions.
I would liket to change the optionss of select 2 after selecting a country (in select 1)
