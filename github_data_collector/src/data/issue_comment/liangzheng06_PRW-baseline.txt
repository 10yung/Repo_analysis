For example, in `annotations/c1s2_024091.jpg.mat`, there are two bounding boxes with the same person ID `297` (but however the two bounding boxes are of different persons).

```bash
# The content of c1s2_024091.jpg.mat
-2, 378.513, 465.856, 46.652, 118.963
-2, 408.837, 461.191, 62.981, 144.622
-2, 1124.246, 432.408, 45.419, 135.914
297, 654.389, 624.883, 116.599, 359.318
297, 1327.887, 423.869, 55.983, 151.620
302, 948.536, 459.604, 115.252, 367.094
```

Is this a mistake or intended? Thanks.
