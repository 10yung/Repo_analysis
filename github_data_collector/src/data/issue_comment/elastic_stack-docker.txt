fixes https://github.com/elastic/stack-docker/issues/55
I have run `docker-compose -f setup.yml up` after this change, and it started working for me.

Solution based on:
https://github.com/docker-library/elasticsearch/issues/140
https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/93

When we try to launch this "installation" using docker-compose.setup.yml and docker-compose.yml, we get all containers in existed mode after a few seconds using $TAG=7.4.0.
It get stuck every time here, any ideas on how to fix or debug this?

This is mainly needed for newer docker images that seems to be
missing the unzip utility

Stack-Docker works just fine on my local machine for the beats that are included. Does anyone have a working implementation of Winlogbeat that works with stack-docker? I can't seem to get a grasp on creating keystores for winlogbeat or certifying stack docker to work with winlogbeat. Keep getting a error message:

Exiting: Couldn't connect to any of the configured Elasticsearch hosts. Errors: [Error connection to Elasticsearch https://localhost:9200: Get https://localhost:9200: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority]
Missing support for Elasticsearch 7.x which is the newest version. Simple update of versions in .ENV file to 7.0.1 renders following error:

`ERROR: for elasticsearch  Cannot create container for service elasticsearch: invalid mount config for type "bind": bind source path does not exist: /Users/<CurrentUser>/temp/es-docker-full/stack-docker/config/ssl/ca/ca.crt`
Hi , I see the docker compose file is only for one node ES setup. Is there a way I can setup a 3node ES cluster?.
