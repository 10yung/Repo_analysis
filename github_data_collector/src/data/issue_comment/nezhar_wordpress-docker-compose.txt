Every time I try to run `docker-compose up` I get the following error.

```
E:\agency-development>docker-compose up
agency-development_db_1 is up-to-date
Creating agency-development_wordpress_1 ... error

ERROR: for agency-development_wordpress_1  Cannot create container for service wordpress: invalid volume specification: '/e/agency-development/wp-content:/var/www/html/wp-content:rw'

ERROR: for wordpress  Cannot create container for service wordpress: invalid volume specification: '/e/agency-development/wp-content:/var/www/html/wp-content:rw'
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
```

I have also added `COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1` as the env variable 

I'm not sure how the data base dump import works the Readme doesn't have a clear example. What kind of 'dump file' is needed? how do I get this file from an existing site?

We need to fix the yaml configuration.
```

volumes:
  db_data:
```
should be replaced by 

```
volumes:
  db_data: {}
```
I'm trying to use the docker-compose.yml to start the wordpress as a service. 

docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml wp1

However, the mysql container is not starting and is failing with this error

If i do a docker-compose up everything works as expected.
Any idea why ?
Thank you

Based on https://github.com/nezhar/wordpress-docker-compose/pull/34
This does not work:

      - ./wp-app:/var/www/html # Full wordpress project
      - ./plugin-name/trunk/:/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name # Plugin development
      - ./theme-name/trunk/:/var/www/html/wp-content/themes/theme-name # Theme development


The folders that are created after running `docker-compose up -d` belong to the root user. How to deal with the user permissions? 

I want to create a complete development environment thus I need complete access to wp-content for themes and plugins.
This is needed as otherwise one would accidentally commit the contents of
wp-app after it's been installed.
Would it be within the goals of the project to have XDebug be part of the PHP configuration? Or is there intention for this container configuration to be used for production purposes too?

Or has someone done this on their own already and have a few bullet points to share on how to set it up?
