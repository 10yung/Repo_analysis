Hi, thanks for this project, very cool!

I wanted to install this by building from source instead of installing the pre-packaged binary.

Is this the right way to do it (on macOS, from the root directory of the repo)?

```sh
brew install rust
cargo build --release
cp target/release/yarn-autocompletions ./
./install.sh $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins
# Trust program from Unidentified developer (macOS Catalina Gatekeeper)
spctl --add $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/yarn-autocompletions/yarn-autocompletions
rm yarn-autocompletions
```
Pressing `yarn run <tab> <tab>` does not list commands that have a `:` in their name. For example a `package.json` with the following `scripts` does not display the `start:dev` and `test:watch` commands.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
	"start": "node .",
	"start:dev": "webpack-dev-server",
	"test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "yarn test --watch",
  }
}
```
Hey, this is a very cool plugin!
However when I type `yarn a` it doesn't autocomplete it to `yarn add`. This is a pitty, as autocompletion for custom yarn scripts works just fine. Would it be possible to add the built-in commands like `add` and `remove` to the list?

This should be the complete list of built-in commands:
```
access, add, audit, autoclean, bin, cache, check,
config, create, exec, generate-lock-entry, global,
help, import, info, init, install, licenses, link,
list, login, logout, node, outdated, owner, pack,
publish, remove, run, tag, team, unlink, unplug,
upgrade, upgrade-interactive, version, versions,
why, workspace, workspaces
```
