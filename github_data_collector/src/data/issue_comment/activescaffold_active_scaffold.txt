I have trying to followed the steps based on the documentation.  When I run

raise an error. like 

>  missing  app/assets/javascripts/application.js

> JS file app/assets/javascripts/application.js is required for ActiveScaffold


i've changed the my app to rails 4.2 to 5.2 so
**as_routes** is not worked instead of that i put 
    resources :model, concerns: :active_scaffold
now it is showing the error as 
 **No concern named active_scaffold was found!**
**active_scaffold and wicked_pdf gems can't coexist #603**

The issue still exists.
After ruby 2.5.0 and higher , the error is shown as ,

FrozenError (can't modify frozen fatal):

There is no other options other than to switch from wicked_pdf and use other solutions.
I have only two columns which occupies entire screen. Is there any way to reduce the width of list table through config or helper. I was trying to override the the list through _list.erb but here I have to rewrite the whole CSS and JavaScript again for this small issue. 
How to display multiple checkboxes on same row.
e.g.

> Group Title  column1 chkebox1 column2 checkbox2  column3  checkbox3

currently with 

> config.columns[:column1].form_ui = :checkbox 
config.columns[:column2].form_ui = :checkbox 
config.columns[:column13].form_ui = :checkbox 

> 

each checkbox is displaying on new line.
Hi, I am using active_scaffold 3.5.1 with rails 5.1.6. when I try to search for an entry in a table it displays the search results (status code 200) but also displays "Request Failed" error message. The response returned has Activescaffold.replace_html with "<p class=\"error-message message server-error\" style=\"display:none;\">\n        Request Failed\n        <a href=\"#\" class=\"close\" title=\"Close\">Close<\/a>\n      <\/p>"
Can you please tell me why request failed is being displayed even when search results are being displayed?
ActiveScaffold.replace_html is not working.
In a new Rails 5 project, followed instructions "Commands for Rails 5". 

My routes.rb file:
```
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  concern :active_scaffold_association, ActiveScaffold::Routing::Association.new
  concern :active_scaffold, ActiveScaffold::Routing::Basic.new(association: true)
  resources :blogs, concerns: :active_scaffold
  resources :users, concerns: :active_scaffold
  resources :blog
end
```

Browser output on page:
http://0.0.0.0:3000/blog
```
NameError
uninitialized constant ActiveScaffold
Extracted source (around line #2):            
1 Rails.application.routes.draw do
2   concern :active_scaffold_association, ActiveScaffold::Routing::Association.new
3   concern :active_scaffold, ActiveScaffold::Routing::Basic.new(association: true)
4  resources :blogs, concerns: :active_scaffold
5  resources :users, concerns: :active_scaffold
```

There may not be any issue. I do not know. I am not experienced enough to know essential Rails knowledge. It is possible there is more to do which an experienced Rails programmer would know. 

Thank you for the active_scaffold gem.

 resource :controller will generate routes for the default actions (index, show, new, create, edit, update, and destroy). What should I do if I want to generate routes for the remaining actions too?
Rails 4.2.7.1
Ruby 2.3.1
AS 3.4.41.1

Hoping that someone can help with this -- I've got an inline link for editing on my page, and it is not loading the form properly.  I don't know if this is a configuration error on my part, or a bug in the AS code.

   config.update.link.label = 'Edit Module'
   config.update.link.inline = true

What I can see happening is that the request is going in and being handled by the controller as JS

Started GET "/admin/program_management/program_modules/209/edit?program_module_base_id=210&program_module_type=english" for 127.0.0.1 at 2016-10-11 11:34:08 -0400
Processing by Admin::ProgramManagement::ProgramModulesController#edit as JS

-- but what is returned is JUST HTML, and the AJAX Responders are erroring out because they can't parse what's returned.   Any ideas?

Thanks in advance!

Hi,

I want to call a function `logged_in?` whenever an action is performed.
Is it possible by overriding the corresponding methods?

For ex: show_search is being called when I click on search.
So if I define show_search as below in application_controller.rb, will it serve my purpose?

```
    def show_search
      self.logged_in?
      respond_to_action(:search)
    end
```

I tried doing that, but ended up with the following error:

> AbstractController::ActionNotFound (The action 'show_search' could not be found for XxxController)

Can someone let me know how to proceed?

Thanks.
