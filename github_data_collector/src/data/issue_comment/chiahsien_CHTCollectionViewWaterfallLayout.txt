# Problem
I am trying to use this `Layout` with `IGListKit`, the problem with IGListKit is it treats each cell as a single Section. and this Layout does not support multiple sections in a single line each section starts on a new line.  

# Request for support.
Please add support to disable sections On New Line.

on code 194line，Assignment errors

After I start to scroll suddenly my collection view items layout is acting strange ...displaying it wrong like there are no constraints. This happend after I updated at xcode 10. Anyone else got this issue?
Why use `CHTCollectionElementKindSectionHeader` instead of `UICollectionElementKindSectionHeader`?
When i change `CHTCollectionElementKindSectionHeader` to `UICollectionElementKindSectionHeader` in library, It works well and More storyboards are available(register class in storyboard for header and footer).

self.sectionItemAttributes[path.section] count ->error!!!!
UICollectionView's delegate should conform to CHTCollectionViewDelegateWaterfallLayout protocol
