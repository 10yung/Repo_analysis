It's looking for a log4net reference that doesn't exist and for Code\bin\Release\Core.dll.  Since this project doesn't have a Readme.md, I don't really know what I need to do to build it other than clicking Build in VS and praying for the best.
The executable version 0.6 has become very obsolete & exploitable? It is vulnerable to multiple malcode injection. something new for us who are followers? 
Hello! Need some help with running the service.

I've build the solution  in VisualStudio 2015(Update3) under x64 windows 10. 
In debug mode all three projects(script/interface/code) will compile. But no luck with starting the service.
In release mode I checked only the service to build in (build -> configuration manager) because two other projects would cause errors like: 

`Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State
Error		The command "if Release == Release CALL signtool sign /t http://timestamp.comodoca.com/authenticode /n "OpenDNS" /d "OpenDNS DNSCrypt" "C:\Users\USER\Downloads\dnscrypt-win-client-master\Interface\obj\x64\Release\OpenDNSInterface.exe"
" exited with code 1.	OpenDNSInterface			
`

so I checked only the service project to compile and the output would say that it compiled successfully:

`1>------ Skipped Rebuild All: Project: Code, Configuration: Release x64 ------
1>Project not selected to build for this solution configuration 
2>------ Skipped Rebuild All: Project: OpenDNSInterface, Configuration: Release x64 ------
2>Project not selected to build for this solution configuration 
3>------ Rebuild All started: Project: OpenDNSCryptService, Configuration: Release x64 ------
3>  **OpenDNSCryptService** -> C:\Users\USER\Downloads\dnscrypt-win-client-master\Service\bin\x64\Release\OpenDNSCryptService.exe
========== Rebuild All: **1 succeeded**, 0 failed, 2 skipped ==========`

then in command prompt under Administrator I cd to:

`c:\Users\USER\Downloads\dnscrypt-win-client-master\Service\bin\x64\Release`

and run:

`installutil OpenDNSCryptService.exe
`

the installation log says that everything is okay as far as I understand:

`Installing assembly 'c:\Users\USER\Downloads\dnscrypt-win-client-master\Service\bin\x64\Release\OpenDNSCryptService.exe'.
Affected parameters are:
   logtoconsole = 
   assemblypath = c:\Users\USER\Downloads\dnscrypt-win-client-master\Service\bin\x64\Release\OpenDNSCryptService.exe
   logfile = c:\Users\USER\Downloads\dnscrypt-win-client-master\Service\bin\x64\Release\OpenDNSCryptService.InstallLog

   logfile = c:\Users\USER\Downloads\dnscrypt-win-client-master\Service\bin\x64\Release\OpenDNSCryptService.InstallLog
`

Now I go to windows services and see that the service is installed but status is "stopped"
If I start it - it says 

**"Windows could not start the OpenDNSCrypt service on Local Computer - Error 5: Access is denied"**

 
Then I go to properties of the service -> "Log On" tab  and check the "Local System Account" radiobutton. Apply. 
Start again the service and I see another error:
**"The OpenDnsCrypt service on Local Computer started and then stopped. Some services stop automatically if they are not in use by another services or programs."**

What am I doing wrong? 

P.S: also I needed to install "log4net" package via NuGet as it had errors referring to lack of this package.
P.S_2: dnscrypt-proxy.exe from the **dnscrypt-win-client-master\Interface\bin\Debug\** runs okay. But I still would prefer to run your program as service. 

Any ideas ? 
I want to use  unbound to coordinate with dnscrypt but failed .The system showed that 53 port is occupied.

It's not strictly required, but it's useful metadata, and part of the recommended license template text (see http://choosealicense.com/licenses/isc/ and https://opensource.org/licenses/isc-license)

Hello,

Thank you for DNSCrypt.

I have noticed over the years that there never seems to be any update, is this usual?

Also, DNSCrypt fails (red icon) several times per day on my computer which is running Windows 8.1 x64.

I have tried running DNSCrypt with and without TCP / 443 enabled and that does not seem to make any difference.

I also have used it with free and paid VPN services and DNSCrypt still fails with them as well.

Sometime the green icon turns red for a few seconds and sometimes for a minute and a half or more, when this happens is my internet traffic trackable, even though my VPN which uses openvpn is still working?  Is there any way to automatically suspend all internet traffic when DNSCrypt fails (red) and reconnect when it is green again?

Thanks again,

NS

 I have been using DNSCrypt v0.0.6  for many months without a problemï¼Œbut now it could not work,and pop up a window:OpenDNSCrypt has encountered an error and will now close.if I click the button,it will be closed.

please tell me how to repair it.

On the [main page](https://github.com/opendns/dnscrypt-win-client) for Windows DNSCryt page, there isn't a readme file describing what to do to.

omg wrong app, sorry i'm new to github

Hi there, 
I am hoping someone can help me with DNSCrypt Windows GUI.... I have been using DNSCrypt v0.0.6 over TCP/443 for many months without a problem, and strangely now it keeps connecting and then disconnecting (i.e. going from protected to unprotected). Things you should know:
- Running W7P 64
- No changes have been made to the router or software firewall 
- Tried disabling Norton IS 2014 FW 
- Rebooted the router 
- Disabled the firewall on the router 
- Rebooted PC
- Uninstalled DNSCrypt and removed all config then reinstalled 
- Strangely I have no problem if I connect via VPN

From the log file attached you will see the "SendTcpNetworkPacket EXCEPTION" which I believe is the culprit... That being said I have no idea why I am getting the error or how to fix it.  Please help!!!
