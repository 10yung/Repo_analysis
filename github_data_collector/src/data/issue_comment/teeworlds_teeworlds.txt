1. Loading is already pretty fast on my machine, but most time is spent before the loading screen is shown. To give some rough numbers of how it feels, maybe 0.3 seconds are only the console window, then about 1 seconds of just a white screen, then 0.5 seconds of the loading screen progress bar. The white screen should be as short as possible, which means the loading screen should be loaded as soon as the graphics are.

2. There is a 0.5 second freeze when activating the server filter for the first time, as this parses the ui_settings.json for the first time. The settings should be loaded as part of the loading screen process.

3. Gametype images are loaded when the browser is activated. I think this should be part of the loading screen, because you are almost guaranteed to need them anyway.

4. The loading scrollbar shows only about 2-3 different states before being finished at a random point (on my rather fast machine). After everything is integrated into the progress bar, we should try to have it move uniformly (somewhat at least).

5. Improve UI:
    - Show a percentage or make it more clear where the progress bar ends.
    - Show what is being loaded currently. Doesn't need to be down to the file for everything in my opinion.
    - Make it more visually appealing. Show the teeworlds banner, maybe something animated even.

Hey,

it would be awesome if we could see the ms in the timer.

- Make sure that the selected server is always in sync with the server address (handle Page change, Filter selection, Server selection, Filter change). Changing the address changes the selection, will now also deselect if no address matches. Closes #2003.
- Store selected filter for each browser page (internet, LAN) separately.
- Store selected server for each filter and browser page separately.
- Reenables the important message "No servers match your filter criteria" in case the filter excludes everything
- Adds additional important message "No filter category is selected" if no filter category is expanded, because this was really confusing the first time it happended.
- Adds additional important message "Fetching server info" when no servers are available because they are refreshing.
- Move CListBox class to menus_listbox.cpp
- Refactor CScrollRegion by moving the associated methods inside the class, move the class to menus_scrollregion.cpp
- Remove obsolete comments and some unused constants.
Right now it is very confusing a personal best record is displayed in the chat as a potential server record because “Fisico has set a new record: 00:10.481 (1.547 seconds faster)” This should be changed to “Fisico has set a new personal record: 00:10.481 (1.547 seconds faster)”.

If it is a server record it should be: “Fisico has set a new server record: 00:10.481 (1.547 seconds faster)”
This needs to be checked in the translations as well then.

Add sounds for events (start, finish, record, checkpoint?) in race.
- Warmup can be aborted with `restart -a` and `restart abort`. Infinite warmup cannot be aborted (closes #2153).
- Fix restart timer and pause not working when alone (closes #2154).
- Allow restarting when game is paused (closes #1809).
- Remove a hard coded 3 second timer that restarts the warmup early (related to #1690).



- doesn't respond with correct version
- make providing the standard map hash list work again, so we can update the standard maps between releases
We should add a popup when with a confirmation when pressing Reset in any settings menu
It's a bit messy right now (and sorted in no particular order).
Might want to sort by score as well, like the scoreboard
