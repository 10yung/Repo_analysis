this repo is awesome! Is this project still maintain? And will it support Swift3.2/4+ and Xcode 10+ ? and will the /Logger, /Debugger still work for xcode10+ ?
I tried with the Example project too and it shows the default app icon.
When I archive I get numerous errors stating that my production environment is missing values, 1 for each environment variable.  This has no effect on my build (all the environment variables work) and I don't see the error at all when building for debug.  The issue is, this crashes Xcode Build and by extension my continuous integration build automation process.  

```
/Users/altyus/Development/MakeSpace/iOS/MakeSpaceConsumerApp/MakeSpace/support/KZBEnvironments.plist:1: missing value of variable googleAnalyticsTrackingId for env @\"PRODUCTION\" available values {
    DEVELOPMENT = "xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
    LOCALHOST = "xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
    PRODUCTION = "xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
    STAGING = "xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
}
