The gem can load code from the internet which the user might not expect.

Since the get_gist function calls have not been working for a few years (since github.com started redirecting to githubusercontent.com for things like raw gist data), and no one has complained, I think it's safe to remove this code.

It seems like ruby-debug is not the most common debug tool for rails any more either, I am not sure what is.
This is an alternative to https://github.com/powder-rb/powder/pull/115. I think it's a cleaner solution.
I would like to be able to run `powder console` to launch a rails console with the same environment that my application is running with.

Would you be in favor of a pull request adding that sort of functionality?

I was wondering if it's possible to use `applog` command for any application not only the current application. I find it useful in order to avoid switching in terminal to the application folder and then launch the applog `command`.

I'm more than happy to add this feature myself but I would like to have your feedback first. Do you consider this to be a useful feature?

Takes #108's work to improve the signal trapping in the library and merges with #105 to reduce duplication.

Pow supports hosting static sites under a ~/.pow/sitename/public symlink if the static site itself doesn't run under a "public" folder. This lets "powder link" support that feature by creating a folder for the site and a "public" symlink into the actual folder.


Hello,

I developer rails apps along with PHP websites. When I have POW installed on OSX 10.10 the rails apps load fine, but I cannot get the PHP websites to load with my virtual host and /etc/hosts file configuration. When I uninstall POW my PHP apps start up again.

Is there a configuration issue with POW / Powder that is not fully disabling POW when I run powder down?

Thanks

Upgrading to rack 1.6.0 (from rack 1.5.2) breaks powder link.
