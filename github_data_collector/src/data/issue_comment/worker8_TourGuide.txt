 Fix overlay not full screen in some devices (Issue 114)
https://github.com/worker8/TourGuide/issues/114
I see that you changed the library language to kotlin, years back, but, I was using the java version of the same. Please point me to the java branch where I can still find the library and use in my project, a zip will do the job for me.  

Thanks

I am trying to use TourGuide on Wear OS. The tooltip does not appear the first time I use the "PlayOn" function but does the second time. Here is my code:

`final TourGuide tourGuide = TourGuide.init(activity).with(TourGuide.Technique.CLICK);
            ToolTip toolTip = new ToolTip();
            toolTip.setGravity(Gravity.TOP);
            toolTip.setDescription("Click description");
            Overlay overlay = new Overlay();
                    overlay.setMDisableClickThroughHole(true);
                    overlay.setMStyle(Overlay.Style.CIRCLE);

                    overlay.setOnClickListener(view -> {
                        tourGuide.cleanUp();
                        clicks++;
                        if(clicks == 1) {
                            tourGuide.playOn(episodeFragment.findViewById(R.id.play_button));
                        }
                    });

            Pointer downloadPointer = new Pointer(Gravity.CENTER);
            tourGuide.setPointer(downloadPointer)
                    .setToolTip(toolTip)
                    .setOverlay(overlay);
            tourGuide.playOn(episodeFragment.findViewById(R.id.play_button));`
How about adding a Guide Tour for Bottom Navigation item? 
When i am trying to  set custom view in setCustomView it shows a black shadow line instead of my custom view

below is my code:


   tourGuide = TourGuide.create(this) {

            toolTip {

                val layoutInflater =getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE) as LayoutInflater
                val view = layoutInflater.inflate(R.layout.row, null, true)

                setWidth(200)
                setCustomView(view  as ViewGroup)

            }
            overlay {
                disableClick { false }
                disableClickThroughHole { false }
                style { Overlay.Style.ROUNDED_RECTANGLE }
                onClickListener { View.OnClickListener { tourGuide.cleanUp() } }
                backgroundColor { Color.parseColor("#AAFF0000") }
            }

        }.playOn(button)

Hi there
tanks for TourGuide

im using this lib but does work good on some devices, tooltip and ponter stays on wrong location
i reed the tooltip code and problem was in layout observer and getX returns wrong value for tooltip location, it must be same for pointer too

heres the line i'm talking  about  in setupToolTip(): 

`layoutParams.setMargins((int) mToolTipViewGroup.getX(), fixedY, 0, 0);`
- Added ```hasNext()``` function to ChainTourGuide.
- Added info to Readme about ```disableClickThroughHole(...)```.

The logic for ```hasNext()``` already exists in the ```next()```, but by making it publicly accessable users of the ChainTourGuide can use ```hasNext()``` to determine if the end of the chain has been reached. This will allow performing some kind of action at the end of a chain of actions, like ```tour completed, don't run again``` settings.
Hi and thanks for this lib!

Is it possible to use it using something like :

Hi,

I want to implement an app tour which mainly includes BottomNavigation items. I casted MenuItem to View like the code snippet below, but it doesn't do the trick (which I didn't expect it to do anyway).

```
TourGuide tourHandler = TourGuide.init(this).with(TourGuide.Technique.CLICK)
                .setPointer(new Pointer())
                .setToolTip(new ToolTip().setTitle("Title").setDescription("Description"))
                .setOverlay(new Overlay())
                .playOn(((View)bottomNav.getMenu().getItem(2)));
```
`playOn(bottomNav.getMenu().getItem(2).getActionView())` returns NullPointerException as well.

Is there support for BottomNavigation and OptionsMenu?
