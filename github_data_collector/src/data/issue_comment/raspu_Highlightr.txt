Supporting Swift PM would ease the development a lot.
Is this project abandoned? Have not seen to be any updates last year and no pull requests are merged?
Some of the code is incompatible with swift 4.2
Happy to help with some direction, I've never worked in this codebase though. Is anyone working on this? 
Straight update to Swift 5. Most done automatically by Xcode. Checked and tested, currently using with [Moped](https://github.com/RobertoMachorro/Moped).

It would be nice if there would be a way to manually trigger a rehighlight from the auto-highlight feature (CodeAttributedString). Essentially, on top of the highlighting, I am using a yellow highlighter to display certain text (like a Find feature). However, the only way to remove this highlighting is when a user start typing, so that it re-highlights the text. 

If anyone knows a simple work around that would be great. 
Calling `processEditing` causes an error because no edits were actually made
I tried to reset the theme (setting it to itself), but to no luck
In order to allow us to use Highlightr in app extensions, the APPLICATION_EXTENSION_API_ONLY flag needs to be set to YES. There doesn't seem to be a technical reason to keep this flag set to NO.
- Code refactoring. The syntax is more Swift like.
- Converted to Swift 5.
- Added the ability to chose a bundle when setting a theme
Pulling in something
There's a crash on Highlightr init, specially at follow code line:

`let value = jsContext.evaluateScript(hgJs)`

XCode shows the follow message:
Warning: could not execute support code to read Objective-C class data in the process.

Can someone help me with this ?
