Hello, I learned a lot through your tutorial, but I want to continue to learn more, can you continue to update the tutorial (I hope there is a skeleton animation tutorial), thank you
I've been following your tutorials on loading models with assimp and project can't load textures on the provided model (also on my models with edited path in **.mtl** file)

Project gives me a following error -  

> "Texture failed to load at path:        "

  without no path displayed.
Same thing happened in your git project when I've compiled it.

Is that an issue or maybe I should write some additional code  for path on **Linux** (currently using Kubuntu 19.04)?
Thanks for your tutorials, but I found the link below

show "the page you requested does not exist in the database"

Do you have any plans to write the CSM tutorial?
Can't compile on Linux.
undefined reference to `gladLoadGLLoader`
In order for me to be able to run the demos, I had to add a link to `libIrrXML.dylib`  within the `lib` directory.

After installing `assimp` via Homebrew, I linked the library like so:

```
$ cd LearnOpenGL
$ ln -s /usr/local/lib/libIrrXML.dylib lib/ 
```

Otherwise, I would get the following error for all demos:

```
$ ./1.getting_started__1.1.hello_window
dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libIrrXML.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/opt/assimp/lib/libassimp.5.dylib
  Reason: image not found
[1]    93973 abort      ./1.getting_started__1.1.hello_window
```




Hello, I am using VS2019.  I generated the libs/headers for my specific platform, Then referenced them in CMake so the project would target them (that didnt work, and I had to replace the default libs/headers which came with the repo and generate a default config)


The problem is that when opening some of the projects (such as 1.getting_started_4.2.textures_combined) some of the source code cannot reference the correct directory.

a key example is the following:

`textures_combined.cpp
52     Shader ourShader("4.2.texture.vs", "4.2.texture.fs");
`
tries to build the shader program by passing two shader files relative to the source directory

`..\src\1.getting_started\4.2.textures_combined\textures_combined.cpp
..\src\1.getting_started\4.2.textures_combined\4.2.texture.vs`

however the header which executes ourShader(); is in a different directory

`\includes\learnopengl\shader.h`

it is trying to find the vs/fs files in this directory, but they are in the source directory. does this mean the project is misconfigured, or have I made a mistake?



Apparently because it is hosted on Digital Ocean which IPs are mass-blocked by law in Russia.
I'm going to run it on Android.
But I don't know how to modify the cakes.
Compiling the current file as it is will result in the following error:
 Error configuring CMake server (C:\Users\bit\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\cmake\3.10.2.4988404\bin).
 CMake Error at glfw/CMakeLists.txt:21 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindGLM.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "GLM", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "GLM" with any of
  the following names:

    GLMConfig.cmake
    glm-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "GLM" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "GLM_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "GLM" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.

In addition, if your Android NDK has a main CMakeFile, I wonder if you need to modify the CMakeFile in this file.
hello,
Thanks for your tutorials.but when I use the first example,gladLoadGLLoader  fails and return
I use vs2012, opengl 3.0
Hi all, 

I try to render the depth buffer following the "shadow mapping depth" tutorial and source code, and here is my [code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yxupXvBBwdi2JAoqhHfCfhE3UNyY_SGG/view?usp=sharing) (with some modifications based on the original code).

However, the result looks like this: the depth map seems work but it only shows up on half of the screen. Does anyone have an idea how to solve it ? I am running on macOS High Sierra and thanks in advance.
