        messages={this.state.messages} 
        onSend={messages => this.onSend(messages)}
        user={{
        _id: 1,
        }} />
    <KeyboardAvoidingView behavior={'padding'} keyboardVerticalOffset={80}/>
</SafeAreaView>
```

#### Expected Results

There is no gap below the text input bar. Just like the 1st screenshot

#### Issue Description

So for the chat, i push to a new screen, this screen renders with all the messages and gifted-chat itself... without keyboard showing at first, but when the keyboard shows up, slides from right to left and kind of making an entire screen slide animation, so if I wrap my giftedChat with an ImageBackground, the ImageBackground also slides... and looks like a double screen push whenever I tap on a chat room.

How can I fix this undesirable effect?

#### Issue Description

This feature would be beneficial since we often want message bubbles to respond to touch. For example, if you tap a message on Facebook Messenger, the sent/delivered/read status is displayed below and the sent date is shown above the message. Right now, I've been able to implement this with gifted chat except one minor detail. I would like to add a touchable to the background so when I tap off the message I can hide the date and message status. The closest I've gotten so far is by adding a TouchableWithoutFeedback to the chat footer and setting the z-index to position it behind the message bubbles, but I couldn't figure out the right z-indices to get the touchable above the background but below the message bubbles.

I think it would be a good feature and add some flexibility to gifted chat. I would be open to attempting to implement this myself, if I get some good feedback/guidance here.

#### Issue Description

When the keyboard is open on Android there's no space between the keyboard and the focused input. I haven't found any props that adds distance between the input and the keyboard.

#### Issue Description
WeÂ´re building a news distribution app, so the users gets alot of messages by the provider. When the Chat is opened the window scrolls to the bottom automatically. We would love to scroll to the first message that was not read yet by the customer. Is there a possibility to scroll to a specific message, by offset or maybe even id ? Important would be also that it scrolls to the beginning of the message since our news provider tends to send super long messages. Scrolling options could be by id of the messages or by a set offset or something.

#### Expected Results

The Chat scrolls to the beginning of a dedicated message.

#### Issue Description

When not supplying image, the avatar is not rendered as initials  

#### Steps to Reproduce / Code Snippets

user : { avatar:null }

#### Expected Results

Render as initials

#### Additional Information

the bug is in this line in message.tsx

  ```
renderAvatar() {
  [...]
        if (currentMessage && currentMessage.user && currentMessage.user.avatar === null) {
            return null;
        }
  [...]
    }
```
This should be removed to solve the issue.

ps: I've forked, fixed but cannot build... 

The following enhancement would be great. Some Chat UI designs don't have image icon next to the bubble i.e. WhatsApp. Would be great to have some flexibility to show or hide bubble icon.
