#### Expected or Desired Behavior

Reserve corresponding space for asynchronously rendering media or visual elements to avoid skipped frames and stuttering (also known as jank).

#### Observed Behavior
My Communication site Home page has 2 sections layout. 

Section 1 layout is full width style with 1 custom App to display Hero style news web part(custom SPFx web part to display 5 images and link to News from SharePoint list. The images are less than 300 KB.

Section 2 has 3 columns layout with 3 custom SPfx web parts. 2 SPFx Image web part and 1 event web part.

I do not have performance issue in overall page load (5 - 7 seconds). However section 2 web parts appears on page first and then take a second to load web part in section 1. 

From user experience , Section 2 web parts loads, then all of sudden section 1 web part is appearing by pushing down section 2. This gives bad user experience.

Lazy loading may not help me since both section visible in view port of the page. 

How to avoid the flickering effect on page? Is there any way to sequence the section loading or reserve space for section 1?

I referred the article to optimize web part , https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/modern-web-part-optimization#feedback.  It tells to reserve space to avoid jank effect , but i do not find any reference on how to do that.
Thanks in advance.

#### What's in this Pull Request?

There was a help page already on using SPO Site Scripts and Site Designs using SPO Management Shell and Office 365 CLI, but not yet using PnP PowerShell. Adding that with this page.
The provided REST endpoint is not working. The response is 404 Not found.
Also some more information is needed here:
1) Method of request
2) Authentication
3) Response
4) Is the CreateMigrationJob method supported also

Maybe I am wrong on this, but when I add the latest schema to my Site Script JSON files I get errors in Visual Studio Code.

{
    "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/sp/site-design-script-actions.schema.json",
    "actions": [
        {
            "verb": "createSiteColumnXml",
            "schemaXml": "&lt;Field Type=\"Text\" DisplayName=\"Document UID\" Group=\"CDMS\" Required=\"FALSE\" EnforceUniqueValues=\"FALSE\" Indexed=\"TRUE\" MaxLength=\"255\" ID=\"{a90f8dc0-74e6-40ec-85cb-9c5f63b225f9}\" StaticName=\"cdmsDocumentUID\" Name=\"cdmsDocumentUID\" /&gt;"
        }
    ]
}

This generates two error in VS Code stating: 
{
	"resource": "/c:/Users/Mark Stokes/source/repos/CDMS/Site Scripts/cdms-core.json",
	"owner": "_generated_diagnostic_collection_name_#0",
	"severity": 4,
	"message": "Property verb is not allowed.",
	"startLineNumber": 5,
	"startColumn": 13,
	"endLineNumber": 5,
	"endColumn": 19
}
and
{
	"resource": "/c:/Users/Mark Stokes/source/repos/CDMS/Site Scripts/cdms-core.json",
	"owner": "_generated_diagnostic_collection_name_#0",
	"severity": 4,
	"message": "Property schemaXml is not allowed.",
	"startLineNumber": 6,
	"startColumn": 13,
	"endLineNumber": 6,
	"endColumn": 24
}

Am I doing something wrong? or does the schema not match the code examples?

Thanks

Mark

#### Expected or Desired Behavior
According to the answer given by  @andrewconnell in #5152 the manually created manifest.json should be used when syncing the SPFX app to Teams. 

#### Observed Behavior
It seems the default manifest is still being used.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Upload a SPFX webpart with a custom manifest.json file located inside the teams-folder 
2. Sync it to teams via the ribbon button.

#### Additional thoughts
According to [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/guidance/creating-team-manifest-manually-for-webpart#feedback) I have to manually upload to zipped package to take advantage of the custom manifest.json.  
1. Is this the way we should provide an app to teams for now? 
2. Will there be an update to the sync process to use the custom manifest?

#### Expected or Desired Behavior

When calling REST endpoint for creating a folder in custom team site , it should be created.
response code should be 201.

#### Observed Behavior

When I called the REST endpoint I got 403 Forbidden with Access denied error message.

#### Steps to Reproduce

I have register a share-point app in following URL.
`https://***.sharepoint.com/sites/ModernTeamSite/_layouts/15/appregnew.aspx`

In there we have to provide permission and the scope for my app. 
following is the permission I have provided.
`<AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">`
`<AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/sitecollection/web" Right="FullControl"/>`
`</AppPermissionRequests>`

following is the endpoint I'm trying to access.
`https://***.sharepoint.com/sites/TeamSite_ForB/_api/web/folders`

following is the JSON body I'm setting in the Postman.
`{` 
`   "__metadata":{ `
`      "type":"SP.Folder"`
` },`
`    "ServerRelativeUrl":"/sites/TeamSite_ForB/Shared Documents/testFolder"`
`}`

following is the error response I'm getting.
`{
    "error": {
        "code": "-2147024891, System.UnauthorizedAccessException",
        "message": {
            "lang": "en-US",
            "value": "Access denied. You do not have permission to perform this action or access this resource."
        }
    }
}`

#### Queries I have

1. Above REST endpoint which I'm trying to access, is it correct ?
2. what is SCOPE for accessing custom team site in share-point online ?

I have raise the full detailed question in sharepoint stackexchange as well.
If above not clear please look into the following URL.
`https://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/274721/cannot-access-specific-team-site-using-sharepoint-rest-apis`

#### Expected or Desired Behavior

1. Building a SharePoint Framework package containing multiple web parts (no other types of components).
2. One or more web parts have a 'long' name.
3. Building, bundling, packaging and uploading to Tenant app catalog as we have done 1000 times before.
4. Clicking 'yes' to tenant wide deployment.
5. Hitting 'Sync to Teams' button in Ribbon menu.
6. Seeing a small notification that the package was synced successfully.
7. Web parts should now be available in the associated Team.

#### Observed Behavior
Following all the above steps from 1 to 4 works a charm, but when performing step 5, the following happens:

The network panel in Chrome's web developer tools show the request as returning a 400 (Bad request) with no explanation whatsoever.

I found out (after way too much investigation and testing) that the culprit is the Web part manifests which have a `preconfiguredEntries[].title.default` that is over 30 chars in length.

#### Steps to Reproduce
Example web part configuration that will lead to this bug:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6163736/72502300-4deeac00-3839-11ea-9d6c-edf617b3ecf1.png)

#### Improvement or bugfix
Could we get a more verbose message than 400 Bad request? I am hoping that others can save some time by me submitting this, as the documentation is not very specific from the SharePoint side that this is  a requirement. Either this or notice it in the Web part documentation or in the schema file: [https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/spfx/client-side-web-part-manifest.schema.json](https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/spfx/client-side-web-part-manifest.schema.json)

The following [documentation for creating Teams manifests for Web parts manually](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/guidance/creating-team-manifest-manually-for-webpart#create-a-microsoft-teams-app-manifest)  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6163736/72503040-1254e180-383b-11ea-801b-921ac3cb302c.png)
 led me to find the error, but nowhere does SharePoint Web part development mention that this is an issue.
I noticed that the create site does not work when I pass in STS#3 when I try to create a team site. Also the Topic value should be "96c933ac-3698-44c7-9f4a-5fd17d71af9e" not NULL
