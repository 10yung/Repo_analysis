If they can `curl https://pyenv.run | bash` then we know they can grab files via `curl`, and on almost all systems (minus Git Bash on Windows), even if they don't have the `zip` package or the `unzip` command they likely have `python` or `python3` which includes a `ZipFile.extract()` function in the standard library. For safety you could try `ZipFile.testzip()` to see if the zip was corrupted during the download.
