EDIT: I have reported it to Google.
Hi there, this issue is not 100% related to Pafish but I guess is something worth mentioning to see if more people have the same issue.

Scenario: Im running a W7 x64 VM in VBox, every update is disabled and reg keys have been changed, I have a 51/53 in Pafish (the rtsc ones are quite difficult for VBox, rest is fine).

So, when creating a snapshot of said machine, and coming back to check the snapshot in a week or so, and re running pafish again, I can see that the WMI has been activated again, plus the 3 reg keys regarding SystemBiosDate, VideoBiosVersion and ACPI\DSDT\VBOX___

If anyone has any idea Id be more than happy to hear, also, if this does not belong to here just feel free to close it:)

Thanks.
Diego.

EDIT** Update.
Found that this issue might be related to Win7 not being an original version, updated and by now it has not changed in a couple weeks.

Hey, I have problem with this check. How to change my VMware configuration to pass this check and make my virtual machine undetectable?
Just submitting a screenshot of running it [in a VM](https://i.imgur.com/Frflsss.png) vs [actual hardware](https://i.imgur.com/ukGnje3.png).

Also note that the OS version is not determined correctly on Win10. [Use RtlGetVersion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-rtlgetversion) to get that.
