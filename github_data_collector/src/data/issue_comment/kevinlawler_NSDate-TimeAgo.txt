Hi,

I am willing to add a new language. I have already cloned the repository. I have seen that language supports are in a `bundle` named `NSDateTimeAgo.bundle`. But i have a added a new folder inside the bundle `NSDateTimeAgo.bundle`.  Renamed the folder to `bn.lproj`, but after that i was unable to add any file inside that newly created directory. 

It would be great if you share that how a language support can be added in the `NSDateTimeAgo.bundle`. 

Here i have added a gif which demonstrating that, how i attempted this.

Thanks in Advance.

suport swift 4.0
The Slovak strings file (in DateTools.bundle - sk.lproj) should be named "DateTools.strings" like in any other lproj. Otherwise the Slovak translations aren't working.
Library is crashing only in iOS 10.2 version. Moreover, runs smooth during debugging. It only crashes in release mode.
This is persian localization `strings` file.

I made a [`swift3`](https://github.com/kgn/NSDate-TimeAgo/tree/swift3) fork & branch. If you make a `swift3` branch I can submit a pull request.


Hi,

Is there any way to do the same in future ? like [this](http://www.ocpsoft.org/prettytime/) library in java
Eg 3 hours from now, In 30 minutes, etc

Or may be it is there and i missed it ??

Now its not pretty good. Some 'timeAgo' strings are missed.( eg. - 'min. ago')
