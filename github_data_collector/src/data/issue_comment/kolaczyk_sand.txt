Running the chapter 2 code block

`g <- graph.formula(1-2, 1-3, 2-3, 2-4, 3-5, 4-5, 4-6,
                    4-7, 5-6, 6-7)`

`str(g)`

I get the following error

`Error in adjacent_vertices(x, i, mode = if (directed) "out" else "all") : 
  At iterators.c:759 : Cannot create iterator, invalid vertex id, Invalid vertex id`

Let me know if you need more information, not sure what is standard to submit with an issue.

Thanks!
The ``mixer`` package is unavailable at the repository. Does anybody have a work around to execute code chunks from Chapter 6? 
`> N
<<< 2.4
str(g)
 Error in adjacent_vertices(x, i, mode = if (directed) "out" else "all") : 
  At iterators.c:759 : Cannot create iterator, invalid vertex id, Invalid vertex id `

Searching for this error turns up this StackOverflow post - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46137227/r-str-gives-unusual-return-using-igraph  

It seems that as of igraph 1.1.1 that str() is defunct and you need to use print_all(g) instead of str(g), which gives the correct output for 2.4.

However, there doesn't seem to be a way to skip over a code section within a chapter using N, so the rest of the code needs to be manually entered.

I would recommend updating the code for 2.4 and also implementing a function for skipping a code section or jumping directly to a code section.

Thanks!
get.vertex.attribute expects a network object, so used `vertex_attr` for objects of class `igraph`

Hi Eric,

I've upgraded the 5 graph objects (aidsblog, blog, g.bip, laze, psi.CC)
using upgrade_graph and bumped the version to 1.04.
So far it work for the first 3 chapters of the book 
but I haven't tested it out for the entire book.

Best,
Masanao
