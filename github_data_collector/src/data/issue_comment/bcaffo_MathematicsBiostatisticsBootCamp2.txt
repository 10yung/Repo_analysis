I've tried looking but couldn't find it.

edit:

Oops, someone mentioned it's here on the Coursera forum:
https://github.com/bcaffo/Caffo-Coursera
in lecture 11, you reference the se as .039, with out explaining which method used to produce this value!
In lecture 12, concerning fish and mercury, you do a binomial test using 15 data differences above 0
P ( theta > 0), however one of the 15 described elements is actually 0, ie, 11 - 11 = .00
therefore, you should be doing a binomial binom.test(14,25), not binom.test(15,25)

Eponents for (1-p) were missing "- x" and "- y" respectively
