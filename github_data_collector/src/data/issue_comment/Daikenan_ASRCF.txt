您好，请问一下，我用您公布的代码（参数不变）在VOT2016上测试，可是结果有0.2864，文章中给出的结果是0.391，想问一下是什么原因？我是在Windows系统上复现，是因为系统不同还是参数需要调的原因？

你好，我想问下对特征是否使用pca对精度和成功率有什么影响？
Environment: ubuntu16.04 + GTX1660 + cuda8.0 + cudnn6.0 + opencv3.4.1 + matlab2017a.
The version of gcc and g++: 4.9

I have downloaded the code from github.
First step: run the install
the result is:

I do not how to slove the problem,the version of opencv is 3.4.1 on my computer,and I know the version of ASRCF is opencv2.4.1.maybe  is the version of opencv ,but I have configured many projects with opencv3.4.1,so I don't want to remove the opencv3.4.1 ,Can you help you.
Thank you very much.

Hi  @Daikenan 
Sorry for disturbing you. I am confused with the programming implementation in your thesis 'Visual Tracking via Adaptive Spatially-Regularized Correlation Filters', as shown below.

没搭过ubuntu下的环境，请问如何搭ubuntu16.04的环境或者如何在win10下实现代码？

急求
