Set the attachmentView property is the containerview(sample:superview, superview[.superview...].superview, UIScorllView, UITableView, UICollectionView, etc.). The pop menu should be show at front and fix MLPAutoCompleteTextField at UITableViewCell bug.


这个合并请求是添加一个attachmentView属性，只要设置attachmentView为MLPAutoCompleteTextField容器view（可以是textfield的superview或者UIScrollView，UITableView，UICollectionView等），就可以修复在UITableViewCell使用MLPAutoCompleteTextField的bug。
I've found that the didSelectAutoComplete method requires a several sec press in to trigger. Is there any Delegate methods to adjust the length of the press? Or is this adjusted somewhere else?
大家好，
我有多个textfield，类似tableView的cell,每个cell上面都有一个textfield，点击第一个，然后下拉列表被遮挡了，怎么办

As you can see the suggestions drop-down is showing behind message view (shown by the red arrow). Can you fix it so that the drop-down, always shows at the top?

The MLPAutoCompleteTextField and the message UITextView, both are inside a StackView.
Dear Eddy Borja

Asynchronous managing of a drop down table of autocomplete suggestions crashes in Swift3.x

NSAssert(0, @"An autocomplete datasource must implement either autoCompleteTextField:possibleCompletionsForString: or autoCompleteTextField:possibleCompletionsForString:completionHandler:");
But same works perfectly in Swift 2.x.
Probably Apple change logics again. Please check.

It has been more than 2 years after update of your github repository.

Could you please address this issue.

Waiting so much, thank you

Is there any possibility of having the uitableview of autocompletion results when the user is writing in the TextField of a UISearchBar?

Thanks!!!
If clearsOnEditingDidBegin is true and showAutoCompleteTableWhenEditingBegins is also true, the current implementation will fetch results for the text that was in the field before being cleared when it is tapped. 

This is a fix for that issue.
