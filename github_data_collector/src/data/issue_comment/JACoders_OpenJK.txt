Single Player,multiplayer

**Description of the bug (and if possible, steps to reproduce the bug):**
I get the error when I start the data and downloaded it from here 

https://www.blizzboygames.net/star-wars-jedi-knight-jedi-academy-pc-full-espanol/

to play Jedi Outcast I have an error, when I enter a door, the game closes

to be able to start the Jedi outcast and to pass on the error to download here the data I have

**What did you expect to happen instead?**

`codemp/botlib/l_precomp.cpp` is compiled with `DEFINEHASHING`.
The below functions are unimplemented in this case:
```c
int PC_AddGlobalDefine(char *string);
int PC_RemoveGlobalDefine(char *name);
```
This is an redesigned server rate limiter for incoming Out Of Bounds (Connectionless) packets.

The purpose of these patches is to mitigate spoofed IP OOB DOS attacks. This is achieved by two changes:

1. Fixing issue with original q3a rate limiter that was causing very high CPU usage when under such attack, up to the point of rendering server unusable.
2. Allowing "whitelisted" players to fully access OOB server protocol when server is under such attack.

There are 3 new cvars:
- `sv_autoWhitelist` – Enable automatically adding connected players to whitelist
- `sv_maxOOBRate` – Max. incoming OOB packet rate per second. 1000 is default, raising it even more would require code changes.
- `sv_maxOOBRateIP` – Max. incoming OOB packet rate per second for a single IP. 1 is default but there is a burst of 10 times the cvar value and it appears to be enough.

Known issues:
1. Lack of whitelist.dat file access synchronization. Rudimentary version of this was implemented in jk2mv.
2. Concerns have been raised about storing IP in the whitelist.dat file being against the GDPR or other privacy laws. If this is a problem, there is a cvar `sv_autoWhitelist`, or IP could be stored as its digest.

I can explain the attacks addressed by this PR and how they are mitigated in depth, on a private communication channel.

These patches have been tested on actual servers by @Yberion and they managed to mitigate few real attacks that would have crippled the server without them. Also a slightly different version has been part of JK2MV 1.4.1 for over a year.

Using Windows 10 OS and running latest build openjk-2019-01-21-cc4094c8-windows playing SP.
I've run into a bug on kor1 map transition to kor2. The kor2 doesn't load completely. The loading bar keeps moving to 100% then back to 95% and voice acting can be heard in background.
I'm using 3 mods: Spanki's Jedi Customization Plus, Mati Hooti's Assorted fixes for Jedi Academy, and Darth Vader - AngelModder (v2.0) links bellow

https://jkhub.org/files/file/1707-spankis-jedi-customization/

I've attached a save file right before the transition.
[jedi_44.zip](https://github.com/JACoders/OpenJK/files/2794700/jedi_44.zip)

Next map loads up fine on original Jedi Academy exe




Only works on Windows. If com_steamIntegration is 1 on startup (maybe it can default to 1?), the game will look for a steam_api.dll and steam_appid.txt and attempt to initialize the Steam API. With an extra download of these two files, one can have the Steam Overlay and hours tracking without launching OpenJK through Steam itself.

Hello, I would like to ask what is the status of case mentioned in the topic, someone already reported it and it seems it has been closed. Base on my experience problem has not been resolved as I am still experiencing lack of event triggers after loading game form checkpoint (after dying).
By that I mean:
- no cut-scenes upon engaging into certain action points
- no possibility to interact with environmental triggers like doors, cutting down tree on yavin
- inert AI
 If the problem is considered to be resolved or closed why this bug is still present in the newest builds?
Kindly please direct me to the proper thread if it is still ongoing case, as following presumable duplicate lead me to non related topic.
Windows 10 using Intel graphics game and openjk was working 5 months ago perfectly 


**Is this for single player or multiplayer?**
Both

**Description of the bug (and if possible, steps to reproduce the bug):**
Major lag when updating to latest build at main menu and in-game 

**What did you expect to happen instead?**
Expected new build to work as I need it for certain new mods and as build that I used 5 months ago now fails to work instead it lags please help me 
From jk2mv, bring console support to windows IF launched from the commandline.

**Description of the bug (and if possible, steps to reproduce the bug):**
I've noticed a hilarious bug that doesn't affect gameplay, but which is very unusual.  Every once in a while, there will be random objects from the scenery from two levels ago.  These objects don't have any collision detection, so I can go right through them.  But they sometimes block things from view.  I'm attaching some of the more awesome examples (mostly from the desert level, superimposing objects from the first level outside of the academy, which was quite a juxtaposition)
