I launch the pokemon command and get error following: 
```
80:96: execution error: Not authorized to send Apple events to iTerm. (-1743)
```
How to fix it ? ( I'm so confused Orz..)

Improved documentation for ConEmu settings. I also had trouble installing in Windows 10 #165, but I was able to use it when enabling Background Image
The default Mac Terminal has built-in ways to change the background image from the CLI. Is it possible with a series of aliases, or something like that, to fairly easily make this work in the standard MacOS terminal as well at some point in the near future?

I'm using pokemon term with tilix, I would like, that each of the different terminal windows could have a different pokemon, but, when I try (put as a command in .bashrc pokemon) when opening a new terminal, change to same pokemon in all, there is some way to do this in tilix
I'm not sure if it is a resolution problem, but the pokemon looks like it could be smoother.
