Hi,

When I try to follow the [the Face Recognition tutorial](http://openbiometrics.org/docs/tutorials/#face-recognition)
with the command:
`br -algorithm FaceRecognition -compare ../data/pic1.jpg ../data/pic2.jpg`

I get an error from the [stasm.cpp](https://github.com/biometrics/openbr/blob/master/openbr/plugins/metadata/stasm4.cpp) code:
```
Set algorithm to FaceRecognition
Comparing ../data/pic1.jpg and ../data/Recnition/pic2.jpg
Enrolling ../data/pic1.jpg to pic1cshRcs.mem
Fatal: Failed to load Stasm Cascade
  SDK Path: /usr/local
  File: 
  Function: 
  Line: 0
Abort trap: 6
```

It is probably something with this piece of code:
```cpp
private:
    StasmCascadeClassifier *make() const
    {
        StasmCascadeClassifier *stasmCascade = new StasmCascadeClassifier();
        if (!stasmCascade->load(Globals->sdkPath.toStdString() + "/share/openbr/models/"))
            qFatal("Failed to load Stasm Cascade");
        return stasmCascade;
    }
};
```

I can't find any related issues on this and hope someone could help me out a bit. I'm a beginner when it comes to openbr and opencv. 

I have interest in convert this project to opencv4.
Do you also have this interest? 
Add me as a contributor
Is there an example or tutorial explaining to load descriptors/templates computed outside OpenBR to the clustering algorithm? I read the source code for rank order clustering and you have done a neat job. The only issue is I am not able to figure out how your neighborhoods are constructed from the templates? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance
So, this is in v1.1.0 there are warning during the cmake configuration for QT5::Test and QT5::OpenGL and during linking it fails. I don't think I missed any Cmake Variable I only set the build type. 

Solution:

CMakeList.txt add Test and OpenGl line 80 in the QT_DEPENDENCIES.

Hi all, 
currently I'm working on  a project about face recognition using openBr, but i have a problem when writing a extra module to frontalize face image using dlib, when using this module openBR did not run properly ( it does not return result when compare 2 template)
does any one know about this issue.
Hi all.
I am new to this project.
Here's some questions when I installed the application.
My compile environment: 
MSVC2015 ->Cmake-> openCV3.4.5 -> Qt5.4.1(for VC2013)
it seems that the tutorial shows:
MSVC2013 ->Cmake-> openCV2.4.11 -> Qt5.4.1(for VC2013)

of course, I can't successfully finish the installation.
Please guide me to join this project.
I am NEW to compiling and my dream is to have some effort on coding area.
This project would be my first big step.
Have a discussion always, my pleasure. :)
Dear all, 

I've been following your great installation tutorial at

http://openbiometrics.org/docs/install/#linux

I'm using Debian 9.6 Linux, that I downloaded yesterday from the official repo. It uses g++ v6.3.0

For most of the time, things went smooth, except for a tiny little problem with contributed code in OpenCV 2.4.11, that was easy to fix. 

OpenBR compiled fine, except for some wanings.  Then I proceeded to the tests outlined in item 8. of the tutorial mentioned before. Then, two big surprises:

* 1st, there was clear misspelling in the file downloading script named downloadDatasets.sh -- it referred to a downloadMeds.sh script, that actually is named downloadMEDS.sh;

* 2nd, typo corrected, I proceeded to the test per se, running `make test` in the `build` directory.

   This time the problem was greater, as all tests failed, besides the initialization. 

Is that correct, or maybe there is a step that was not followed correctly ?

All the best,
Hilton

Replacing `__END__;` by `exit:;` seems to be a solution.
