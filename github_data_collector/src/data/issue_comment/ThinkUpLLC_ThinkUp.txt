Project still seems to be going..

Advisory Details:
I have discovered a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in ThinkUp, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in “headline” HTTP GET parameter passed to “ThinkUp-master/webapp/insight_creator.php” url. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.
The exploitation examples below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to see a  pop-up messagebox:
Poc:
http://localhost/teststh4/ThinkUp-master/ThinkUp-master/webapp/insight_creator.php?headline=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E%3C%22


I just downloaded the latest zip archive and tried to install TU on a server running PHP7.0. This is the error message I get:

`2016/05/13 11:32:24 [error] 11237#11237: *10248 FastCGI sent in stderr: "PHP message: PHP Warning:  preg_replace(): The /e modifier is no longer supported, use preg_replace_callback instead in /home/flowfx/public_html/thinkup.flowfx.org/_lib/extlib/Smarty-2.6.26/libs/Smarty_Compiler.class.php on line 269"`

The directions state: 
Click "Services" and switch Google Maps API v2 to "On."

There is no more such service, it seems they renamed it, which one do I need now?

I just pulled the latest down yesterday and now I'm getting Smarty errors in three different insights (that I've seen): 

```
Warning: Smarty error: unable to read resource: "[...]/webapp/plugins/insightsgenerator/view/stylestats.tpl" in [...]/webapp/_lib/extlib/Smarty-2.6.28/libs/Smarty.class.php on line 1094
```

```
Warning: Smarty error: unable to read resource: "[...]/webapp/plugins/insightsgenerator/view/topwords.tpl" in [...]/webapp/_lib/extlib/Smarty-2.6.28/libs/Smarty.class.php on line 1094
```

```
Warning: Smarty error: unable to read resource: "[...]/webapp/plugins/insightsgenerator/view/responsetime.tpl" in [...]/webapp/_lib/extlib/Smarty-2.6.28/libs/Smarty.class.php on line 1094
```

These are appearing right at the bottom of each insight "box" on the main ThinkUp feed.

When I check the source out on GitHub now, sure enough I don't see those tpl files there either, but the corresponding PHP files are there in `insights` both on GitHub and in my local repo.

Any idea what's going on?

Hi folks,

this is pretty odd. Out of the blue, my selfhosted thinkup instance stopped working. When going to

> https://sub.domain/thinkup/webapp

the only thing I get is an empty, white page (no html returned whatsoever) with a status code 200. No logs seem to contain any information about what may have gone wrong. I have checked this against the current master branch as well as against some older release (from I date when it definately still worked). I'd appreciate any clue you might be able to provide.
- no indication of any sort in apache error log
- no indication of any sort in thinkup logfiles, though they are configured (in fact they don't even get created)
- even ini_set('error_reporting', E_ALL) does not provide any clue.

Here's my configuration:

```
$THINKUP_CFG['app_title_prefix']                 = "";
$THINKUP_CFG['site_root_path']            = '/thinkup/webapp/';
$THINKUP_CFG['source_root_path']          = dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/';
$THINKUP_CFG['datadir_path']              = $THINKUP_CFG['source_root_path'] . 'data/';
$THINKUP_CFG['timezone']                  = 'Europe/Berlin';
$THINKUP_CFG['cache_pages']               = false;
$THINKUP_CFG['use_db_sessions']               = true;
$THINKUP_CFG['cache_lifetime']               = 600;
$THINKUP_CFG['rss_crawler_refresh_rate']  = 20;
$THINKUP_CFG['mandrill_api_key'] = '';
$THINKUP_CFG['db_host']                   = 'localhost'; //On a shared host? Try mysql.yourdomain.com, or see your web host's documentation.
$THINKUP_CFG['db_type']                   = 'mysql';
$THINKUP_CFG['db_user']                   = 'thinkup';
$THINKUP_CFG['db_password']               = '***';
$THINKUP_CFG['db_name']                   = 'thinkup';
$THINKUP_CFG['db_socket']                 = '';
$THINKUP_CFG['db_port']                   = '';
$THINKUP_CFG['table_prefix']              = 'tu_';
$THINKUP_CFG['log_location']              = $THINKUP_CFG['datadir_path'] . 'logs/crawler.log';
$THINKUP_CFG['log_verbosity']             = 0;
$THINKUP_CFG['stream_log_location']       = $THINKUP_CFG['datadir_path'] . 'logs/stream.log';
$THINKUP_CFG['sql_log_location']          = $THINKUP_CFG['datadir_path'] . 'logs/sql.log';
$THINKUP_CFG['slow_query_log_threshold']  = 2.0;
$THINKUP_CFG['debug']                     = true;
$THINKUP_CFG['enable_profiler']           = true;
$THINKUP_CFG['set_pdo_charset']           = false;
set_time_limit(500);
```
