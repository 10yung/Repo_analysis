 - Added Swift Package Manager configuration file
 - Deprecated compile warning in AnimationCurve+AnimationOptions.swift
I used this library in a project, and I realized that viewControllers that presented by Jelly, will NOT deinitialized!

I just added this, to Example project of the library:

```swift
// DismissMeController.swift
class DismissMeController: UIViewController {

    deinit {
        print("DismissMeController.Deinit?!")
    }
    ...
}
```

the message is NOT printing after dismissing viewController. 
hi there, I come with a question that, I found with option `UIModalPresentationCustom`, the presented view controller is always presented on `UIWindow.rooViewController`. I have no idea to present it on any other specific view contoller.
I have tested proprety `definesPresentationContext`, It seems only work with option `UIModalPresentationCurrentContext` or `UIModalPresentationOverCurrentContext` to provide the presenting view controller.
Hello. Can I use pushViewController method to show my view controller instead of present?
Thank you for your nice library!
It would be good to have another effect on transition

The following example create a presentation from bottom to up leaving a small portion of screen free on top.

```swift
var presentation = JellySlideInPresentation()
presentation.presentationCurve = .easeInEaseOut
presentation.heightForViewController = JellyConstants.Size.custom(value: UIScreen.main.bounds.size.height - 60.0)
presentation.directionShow = .bottom
presentation.verticalAlignemt = .bottom
presentation.directionDismiss = .bottom
presentation.jellyness = .jelly
presentation.isTapBackgroundToDismissEnabled = true
let animator = JellyAnimator(presentation: presentation)
animator.prepare(viewController: modal_navigation)

```
I would to see the background controller showed in perspective (a little smaller)
