Use update_xcode_plugins --unsign, open xcode, and then system function be freeze like Lock Screen etc. I use self-signed resolve it, this is page for xvim and self-sign operate: https://jasonzurita.com/try-vim-even-in-xcode/
OS X: mojava  10.14.1 Beta (18B57c)
Xcode: 10-bate6
Xcode: 10
Xcode: 9.4.1

all of them show a same problem.
   
Hello

After unsigning, Xcode fail to launch the app on the simulator. It's stuck (/frozen) on "Waiting for iPhone .. to start / Attaching to .. on iPhone .. ". _I then need to "force quit" to stop xcode._

I found that the tccd process is around 100%, sometimes even more, which is not the case when not unsigning.

It appears on both Xcode 10.0 and Xcode 10.1 beta.  (macos mojave)

I tried to check / uncheck the permission for xcode to access the contacts, it didn't help as it did with previous versions  :/


_Note : It works fine when launching app on device, even if the tccd process is high too._

I turned to my new Mac and installed it. There is no problem on installing it on Xcode v9.3, and it can load Alcatraz in the Xcode interface. But the plugins downloaded from Alcatraz can't work, there is no response even the load Bundle window has been showed. My previous Xcode works well whose version is v8.3.3. What's wrong with it? Thank you!


i use update_xcode_plugins in iterm2 with zsh, some times it ran too slow, 3min would be.
i use gem 2.6.13, ruby 2.3.0p0 (2015-12-25 revision 53290).
any one else meet the same question ?
macOS Sierra 10.12.3
Xcode 8.2.1

Xcode stucked when select file. following steps may help:
1.first open signed Xcode and Command + O to open file. Xcode running normally.
2.close signed Xcode.
3.open unsigned Xcode. Xcode stucked when select file.All that can be done is forced close Xcode.
4.I have disallowed Xcode access Contacts
macOS Sierra 10.12.1
Xcode 8.0 (also in Xcode 8.1)

Xcode stucked when save file. following steps may help:
1.first open signed Xcode and save file. Xcode running normally.
2.close signed Xcode.
3.open unsigned Xcode. Xcode stucked when save file.All that can be done is forced close Xcode.
4.This stuck also appears in the signed Xcode after step3 without restart computer.
5.after restart computer ,stuck will not appears in signed Xcode but appears in unsigned Xcode.
