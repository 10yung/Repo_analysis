This fixes [this issue](https://github.com/uber/react-vis/issues/1300).

I've changed the recursion so each level is aware if its father was in the path, because if no - obviously, they doesn't have to be market (because even if they are contained in the path keys array, they doesn't belong to this hierarchy.)


There is a bug in [Basic-Sunburst](https://github.com/uber/react-vis/blob/master/showcase/sunbursts/basic-sunburst.js) that cause duplicate values from same levels but other hierarchy to be all selected together whenever one of them has to be.

Example :

Given the tree : 
 * root
   * one
     * hello
   * two
     * hello
   * three
     * hello

with the given path : `root > one > hello`

All 3 `hello` items will be marked because the updateData recursion could not treat duplicates.
In fact, this could be solved with a minor change for this recursion that will seep the validity of each node down to its children
I have many bar charts with outliers that have really large values compared to other items in the bar chart.

I would like to crop the long bars, so that the chart takes less space. Something like this: (ignore the orientation)

Does react-vis support something like this?
first off, thanks for this awesome lib!

I was going through the Treemap docs and came across the broken link so I fixed it :) 
cheers! 🍻
…t search correctly #1294
On SearchableDiscreteColorLegend, the default implementation of the searchFn is lowercasing the items but not the search criteria.

The Legend example page is even showing the problem. If you type 'Ap' nothing is shown but if you type 'ap', the entry with Apples in the name is shown.
 
```
  searchFn: (items, s) =>
    items.filter(
      item =>
        String(item.title || item)
          .toLowerCase()
          .indexOf(s) !== -1
    )
```

Should be:

```
  searchFn: (items, s) =>
    items.filter(
      item =>
        String(item.title || item)
          .toLowerCase()
          .indexOf(s.toLowerCase()) !== -1
    )
```

I'm trying to format the time scale to 24 hours using the example given [here](https://uber.github.io/react-vis/documentation/general-principles/scales-and-data)

The 12 hours format is still used when I set the time format to "%H:%M:%S" or "%X" using timeFormatDefaultLocale, but I'm able to change the periods, days and months tags which at least tells me the config is read.

Here's an example showing my issue:

Am I doing something wrong here? Any clarification is appreciated

I have a Time Series plot with Y axis containing counts of alerts. 
With the given dataSet I am getting the tick values in the plot as
[0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0]
I want it to be 
[0, 1, 2]

Not in Decimals like [0, 1.0, 2.0].

I tries with tickValues and yType. Not able to achive what I m looking for.
