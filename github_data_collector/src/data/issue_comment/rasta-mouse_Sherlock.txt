I am running Sherlock.ps1 on a CTF-style vulnerable machine and it flags MS16-016 as "Appears Vulnerable". However, according to sysinfo, the machine has installed the KB3124280 hotfix that fixes MS16-016.


Hello @rasta-mouse. I've been trying to adapt Sherlock to work with PowerShell v2 and managed to make it work even with v1 without any problem. 
I have an ugly but full functional code [here](https://github.com/vipzen/Sherlock/blob/master/Sherlock.ps1), but I will comment on some suggestions to be adapted accordingly by you in a more beautiful way.

`Get-FileVersionInfo()`:

Instead using `Win32_Product `class (unstable on v2 and nonexistent on v1), we can use `CIM_DataFile`.

``` 
# Double slash for CIM_DataFile
$FilePath = $FilePath.Replace("\", "\\")
    
# PsH v1/v2 support via CIM_DataFile
$VersionInfo = (Get-WmiObject -Class CIM_DataFile -Filter "Name='$FilePath'" | Select-Object Version).Version
``` 

Also, on WinXP/Win2k3 with v2/v1, for some reason the architecture check fail in some functions and `$Path` will return null, triggering an error in `Get-FileVersionInfo()`

I "fixed" it by simply adding an extra Elseif conditional:

```
 } ElseIf ( $Architecture[1] -eq "x86" ) {

        $Path = $env:windir + "\system32\win32k.sys"

    }
