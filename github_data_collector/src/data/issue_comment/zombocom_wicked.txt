`Rails 5.2.3`
Wicked gem `wicked (1.3.4)`

Controller:

```
class WizardStudentController < ApplicationController

  include Wicked::Wizard

  steps :personal, :avatar, :socials, :current_work, :debts, :insurance, :motivation, :ambitions, :forecast, :education, :documents

  def show
    @user = current_user
    redirect_to dashboard_path unless @user.applicant?

    case step
    when :personal
    when :avatar
    when :socials
    when :current_work
    end
    render_wizard
  end


  def update
    @user = current_user
    redirect_to dashboard_path unless @user.applicant?

    case step
    when :personal
      @user.update params[:user].permit(:first_name, :last_name)
    when :avatar
    when :socials
    when :current_work
    end
    render_wizard
  end

end
```

View `personal.slim`:

```
.container
  .row
    .col-md-8
      = simple_form_for @user, url: wizard_path, method: :put do |f|
        = f.input :first_name
        = f.input :last_name
        = f.submit t('active_admin.next'), class: 'btn btn-primary'
    .col-md-4
      div Personal info
```

When I click form button, user info is saved to database, but I stay on the same step  - `personal`. 

According to README:

> We're passing render_wizard our @user object here. If you pass an object into render_wizard it will show the next step if the object saves or re-render the previous view if it does not save.

So it re-render the previous step even if it saves the model properly
While creating ERB template files in views for each specified step in `steps` method, there was no way to specify common template for them. This scenario appears when you've unknown step names that can come from database, an example of it could be a Survey that has different sections as steps. There you are required to specify a template that can be used for all of your steps. 

Just pass a template option to `render_wizard(nil, template: :your_erb_template_name)` method second parameter.
Hi,
I'm missing flash alert messages when the resource model becomes invalid in the middle of the wizard.

it could be done by a change similar to the one below (and triggered by `render_wizard @model, show_alerts: true`)

I'd like to start a discussion about the feature and its implementation. what do you think?

thanks!
A product has multiple categories and each category has multiple fields.

I'm wondering if there would be a way to define the steps dynamically based on each category name?

`steps :category1, :category2, :category3`

I read your section about dynamic steps, however I don't have predefined names for each step. The issue I have is wicked looks for corresponding views with the same name as each step.
