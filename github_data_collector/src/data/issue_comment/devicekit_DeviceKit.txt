Could you add bool vars such as `hasTapticEngine` and `hasHapticFeedback`? Thank you.
...i created Pull request for this
isSimulator for Apple TV

Fixes #220
When using SwiftPM and doing https://github.com/devicekit/DeviceKit/pull/217
I want to have swift file generated on any template change and I find it very useful so I share it

Just install fswatch using brew `brew install fswatch`
and launch `watch.sh`
The commit allow to compile with SwiftPM and if necessary I can make a PR just for this one

The second one add models dumped from apple web site

There is some double when using "identifier" so I put the PR as WIP
I do not know what to do. Merge into one. Find a way to make some alias with template generations

My very dirty dump script is available here  https://github.com/phimage/MacModelDump
Self-explanatory
An iOS / iPadOS / WatchOS could contain a cellular module. It would be great to have an option of identifying the device in question as either Wi-Fi only or the one having a Cellular capability.

E.g:

Device.wirelessCapabilities: Wi-Fi, Cellular
We use squish and rebase anyway to merge PRs into master so this doesn't matter.
Realizing this would be tricky to implement, but very useful: some software can only run on "more modern" hardware (I'm specifically thinking of CPU power, not a specific camera or hardware feature).  It would be great to be able to call a function:

```swift
if Device.current.isEqualToOrNewerThan(.iPhoneX) {
   // ... do something that needs CPU power ...
} else {
   // ... do something less CPU intensive
}
```

(I realize the function name is a mouthful...an alternate name would be fine)
Use Xcode 11 for building and running tests on Travis CI.
