The old Google client libraries (`google-api-python-client`) are now in maintenance only mode. They are superseded by [`google-cloud-python`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-python).

Most of the notebooks need to be updated to be kept up-to-date.
On https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-Python/blob/master/notebooks/Creating%20TCGA%20cohorts%20--%20part%201.ipynb, there is a call to

`%bigquery schema --table isb-cgc:tcga_201607_beta.Clinical_data
`

which displays no schema details underneath. This is an issue with the rendering code relying on JavaScript and github blocking JavaScript.

I just filed an issue there ("%bigquery schema --table" produces no visible output on github)[https://github.com/googledatalab/pydatalab/issues/184] which includes some python code to replace "bigquery schema" call. This can be used to work around the pydatalab library issue.
