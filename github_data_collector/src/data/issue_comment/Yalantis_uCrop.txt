Thanks for this great library, it has been really helpful to me!
However on the crop page, I have a requirement to not move the image on dragging it.
So, I thought it would be better to give an option to disable the gesture in the GestureCropImageView when required.

**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**
Submitting an improvement

**What is the current behavior?**
No gesture enable/disable control to the user, no way to disable gestures like scroll to translate and double-tap to zoom

**What is the expected behavior?**
To provide the options to enable/disable gesture controls

According to this fact that for picking an image from the gallery doesn't require any permission, I removed this gettiting storage permission.
My app crashes in some devices when try to open an Activity. The problem does not always occur, only on some devices.

```
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    this.pickerManager = GlobalHolder.getInstance().getPickerManager();
    this.pickerManager.setActivity(TempActivity.this); // <== line with error
    this.pickerManager.pickPhotoWithPermission();
}
```

Issue is also report [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58880051/nullpointerexception-while-setactivity/) but with no solution
Hi, uCrop is good library for crop the images, but flipping image is also very useful for users if we can implement that in this library. 

There are 2 type of flips which you implemented in Puzzle library (For collages) that is Horizontal flip and vertical flip, can you please add that in uCrop also.

Thanks.
I am passing the image uri that i have got by requesting the image picker. And then app crashes.

<code> else if (requestCode == PERMISSION_PICK_IMAGE_FOR_CROP) {
                if (data.getData() != null) {
                    String destinationFileName = new StringBuilder(UUID.randomUUID().toString()).append(".jpg").toString();
                    UCrop uCrop = UCrop.of(data.getData(), Uri.fromFile(new File(getCacheDir(), destinationFileName)));
                    uCrop.start(SelectionActivity.this);
                }
            } </code>

This is the stack trace:

Thanks the library , it is good , it helps me to slove my project 's problem.
My english is not very good , sorry about it.
My project need to crop many pictures , so i need to crop one by one.
So i have a question , how can i store the pic's state which i can restore when i need to crop it.
I try to getImageMatrix , i can get a matrix object , and when i set it back by 'setImageMatrix', also invalidate it . But it does not work.
So i want to know how can i store the image's state(may be scale , translate and so on), so i can restore the state when i crop them one by one.
Hope you can reply me . 
Thanks you sir
This PR sends back the angle of rotate through the callback and then the results extras. It allows the app to know what rotation angle the user chose.

I use this as I need to store the offsets and angles so the image can be cropped correctly on the server.
Do you have some plans to  adapt android Q？？
