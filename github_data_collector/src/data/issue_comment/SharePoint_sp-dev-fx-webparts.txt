## Expected or Desired Behavior
Running "npm install" should install all dependencies so that I can then progress onto testing the build, and then ideally deploying it.

## Observed Behavior

After running "npm install", I get a number of warnings followed by the following errors.
>npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
>npm ERR! errno 1
>npm ERR! phantomjs-prebuilt@2.1.16 install: `node install.js`
>npm ERR! Exit status 1
>npm ERR!
>npm ERR! Failed at the phantomjs-prebuilt@2.1.16 install script.

Upon looking deeper into what phantomjs is, I've discovered that the project has been suspended.

## Steps to Reproduce

git clone https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-fx-webparts.git
cd C:\dev\sp-dev-fx-webparts\samples\react-script-editor
npm install

While working on this project, I setup this with the environment. I've a SharePoint Site with the list named _Events_ and I try to fill up the form for adding events to the list. Everything is working as expected except on field.

## Expected or Desired Behavior

The expected behavior should be that it asks for both date and time as the type of the field in the list is 'Date and Time'.

## Observed Behavior

I have various fields in the list and one of the field named _Start Time_ has a Type as 'Date and Time' and when I use the default form provided by SharePoint it gives me option for choosing both date and time for that field [can be seen in [pic1](https://imgur.com/a/Lgd8apZ)]. But, when I use react-list-form webpart for the same that field doesn't give me option to select time (it only provides me with the option to select date) [can be seen in [pic2a ](https://imgur.com/a/xXDevrr)-> [pic2b](https://imgur.com/a/viRuhRk)].

## Expected or Desired Behavior
Webpart would work both in Chrome and Edge.

## Observed Behavior
Webpart works great in Edge (right side of screenshot)
I only see a whitespace in Chrome (left side of screenshot 1 )

Also, not sure if this is a problem but I also see a lot of purple 'request' lines while running gulp serve (screenshot 2 ).  Would this cause any problems later on?
 
## Steps to Reproduce
1. npm install
2. npm install on-el-resize
3. gulp serve

## Chrome is on left, Edge is on right

## I have about 50 rows of the purple 'request' lines running gulp serve.

@sebastienlevert ,

## What's in this Pull Request?
Two small updates:

### Add "order" to Youtube API search params.
Without an order in the YouTube api parameter, it seems to return them in order of published date.  So if you have any number of videos, the component shows  the oldest ones first... which is not recommended.  I hard-coded order by "date" which returns selection similar to when you go to that channel on YouTube.

### Decode Title and Description properties of video.
Attached is an example of a result I saw.
I just added a small loop to remove convert the &amp; to &.
I'm sure there is a better/faster/cleaner way to do it, but this does the job.  NOTE that I also apply it to the description (which may or may not be best practice)... I only noticed it on the Title as seen in the attached screenshot.

Otherwise, great component!

Regarding **react-list-form** webpart


## Expected or Desired Behavior

SharePoint validations  such as mandatory fields or custom column validation must be applied when saving a new list item.

## Observed Behavior

I have used this web part and set the "Form Type" to "New".
When I try to save a new list item, I do not see any of the validations/error messages. The Save button just refreshes the page (or if I have set up the redirect URL, redirects to that URL). 

## Steps to Reproduce

Add this web part to a page. Link it to a list where there are mandatory fields and custom column validations. Set the Form Type to New and Publish the page. Then try to create a new list item which misses some of the mandatory fields or violates the column validations. Notice that the error messages are not displayed on the page.

## Expected or Desired Behavior

I expect to see all past and new events registered on the calendar with the type of event displayed on the pop up card, in order to inform users what type of event each color represents.

## Observed Behavior

I understand that the web part was built with the intention of randomizing the colors of each event. However, all event cards display a name, days and time taken, but not the type of event registered. It will be useful to also include the type of event on the card for the sake of matching a color to an event type. For example, the scenario of leave types (Sick, PTO, Vacation, Bereavement, etc.).

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Download repo

2. Select react-calendar to build and package

3. Install app on SharePoint environment

4. Add app to site contents

5. Add web part to SharePoint modern page and select desired calendar in property panel

## Expected or Desired Behavior

I expect to see all past and new events created via Microsoft Flow represented properly on the calendar.

## Observed Behavior

1. Events represented on the calendar via Microsoft Flow displays 1 hour later that applied for. For example, if I request personal time off from 12pm - 4pm, the event registered on the calendar displays the time as 13:00H - 17:00H. If I were to add an event directly to the calendar via the property panel, the event registers correctly. However, we are not allowing this functionality, as our only method of adding events to the calendar is via Microsoft Flow.

2. Items created by Microsoft Flow that are represented on the calendar displays in the color of blue and does not randomize. If I were to add an event directly to the calendar via the property panel, and I refresh the page, the event color randomizes. In my previous calendar, I had specific colors to represent each type of event.

## Expected or Desired Behavior
(react-graph-calendar)
The calendar whether in WebPart format or in Teams should pull through group events and re-present them to the viewer showing the correct start and end dates.

## Observed Behavior

The calendar in both Teams and SharePoint shows all events as a day later than they are when they were created. If I add an event to the group that is scheduled for all day on the 10th January (10/01/2020 at 00:00 to 11/01/2020 at 00:00), it will display in the webpart or team app on the 11th January (11/01/2020 at 00:00 to 12/01/2020 at 00:00).

## Steps to Reproduce

I have added the Teams app and SharePoint WebPart to various teams, both recently created and 1 Year + old teams and it does the same on all of them. I have checked the timezones on the teams and my client and everything is UK/London as the same as my Outlook client. I have also tried cloning a fresh version and re-installing it to my app catalog however it still does the same thing.

If I add Microsoft's own Group Calendar web part, the events show the correct date and times. Also, if I use the Microsoft Graph explorer and pull the events for that group it shows them with the correct timings so it doesn't appear to be anything to do with the groups themselves.

>I am importing events from "site contents" site url using properties panel. when imported the timings in the modern pages comes different w.r.t classic web page. 
>
> Can someone help me regarding this issue?

After downloading (both by using the ZIP and Git), I am instructed to execute npm install. However, this results in an enormous amount of warmings due to missing files and the end result are errors. 
gulp serve als gives errors.

So I'm stuck on getting the files before starting.
How can I get all the files and all dependencies and/or make sure that the code I download is complete and working?
