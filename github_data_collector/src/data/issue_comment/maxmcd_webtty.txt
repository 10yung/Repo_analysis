WIP. Will be used to run GitHub actions against.
Just Quick&Dirty solution for https://github.com/maxmcd/webtty/issues/5
Now I can send the connection data using # in the url
This is really cool.
If I understand the sdp key exchange, it would be possible for a service to gen a key as a QR code and the developer to scan it and save it to a secure location on their laptop. 
Then the service can be deployed somewhere with the public key. 
Then when you want to connect to that server you just use the QR code, decrypt it to text and connect.

Please let me know if that's a reasonable thing based on how sdp and this software works 
I can then make a little demo and PR it if you want 
In both firefox and chrome, I get an error at [https://maxmcd.github.io/webtty/](https://maxmcd.github.io/webtty/), whenever I try to paste the offer message...

```
InvalidParameterError: Empty or null SDP provided to setLocalDescription
InvalidStateError: setRemoteDescription not called
```
When entering the response of the client, I get 'Quitting with an unexpected error: "unexpected end of JSON input"'.
