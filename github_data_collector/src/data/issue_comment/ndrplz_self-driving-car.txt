I have worked for hours and hours with your code. It is wonderful! Thanks for sharing it. However, one thing that makes it hard to implement in an actual bot is the fact that the road curvature and offset values are always positive. Could you please help me make them negative if the road curves, for example, left, and positive if it curves right? Same for the offset within the lane. My self-driving motercycle needs to know which way it is drifting. 
Thanks so much!

How to run the carnd-controls-pid program?Can you give me the software and complete instructions?
I'm now working on an autonomous tricycle project (based on ROS). Thanks for offering this great package for beginners. Since openCV on ROS is only compatible with python 2.7, I have updated a few codes in project 4 to let the lane-finding project work fine on both python 2 and 3.
