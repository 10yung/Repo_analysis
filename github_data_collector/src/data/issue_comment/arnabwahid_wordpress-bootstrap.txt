I am requesting all contributors, who will be interested in fixing existing issues, update dependencies, and optimizing the make it as awesome again as it once was.

Open up an issue explaining what you are planning - and what will improve for the legacy code as a result in your PR, then we'll figure out the rest.
I don't know if this project is actively maintained or not. But I'd like to update it to Latest bootstrap versions and update the documentation as well. Is there anyone I could talk to about it? 

Or should I just get a fork and continue there? Is this project abandoned? 
Plus minor proposals...
Simple fix for the tags to work once again!
I have an issue with redeclaring mobile menus there. They have been organized to be shown as ul block list but with some % of screen width. When I add my own styles, at first default styles are loaded and after a second my are applied. How can I get rid of that. I can't find those declarations anywhere. Best would if mobile menu would look just like default bootstrap version. 
Second level not working in theme main navigation. when i clicked on 2nd menu item menu completely disappearing. can you please look into this.

Hi everyone,

this theme has a limited number of Menus (or places for menus) of 28. Is there any way to change this limitation?

Thanks!

I am losing hair. On inserting images from the media library Wordpres-bootstrap seems to remove the [caption]...[/caption] tags surrounding the image, my client wants her captions.

It's not in functions.php and I can only guess it is in some jQuery that nips it in the editor. Clues?

In line number 42-43 of index.php, code output older entries and newer entries, and also printing next page and previous page. Because, code is using _e('&laquo; Older Entries', "wpbootstrap").

```
<li class="previous"><?php next_posts_link(_e('&laquo; Older Entries', "wpbootstrap")) ?></li>
<li class="next"><?php previous_posts_link(_e('Newer Entries &raquo;', "wpbootstrap")) ?></li>\
```

I am suggesting, first use __('&laquo; Older Entries', "wpbootstrap"). Then, output result with echo.

```
<li class="previous"><?php echo next_posts_link(__('&laquo; Older Entries', "wpbootstrap")) ?></li>
<li class="next"><?php echo previous_posts_link(__('Newer Entries &raquo;', "wpbootstrap")) ?></li>
```

Thank you,
