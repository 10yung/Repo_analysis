I am receiving email msgs in Mailhog that says "3 days ago" but they just came in. I compare the header and the msg date is moments ago but the received date is 3 days old. The time is not correct either. It showed a time of 1700 hrs and it's 0900 hrs that I received it.

FYI: I'm using a docker container image for mailhog.
The current url doesnt work, loads a blank docker hub page. Have corrected it.

This is a documentation update to pair with a new config option introduced by https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog-Server/pull/16
Would it be possible to have a new release? The last one was 2017. The project moved a bit since then. The last release is also missing the vendor directory. Would be great to have them back in for a new release.
Hi,
do you support AUTH LOGIN? My test app allows me only for this type of AUTH if server is not TLS protected (which I think you also don't support).

Thanks
it would be useful to be able to be able to delete all emails that are in the results list for a given search.

Right now all I can see is 
* a "delete all messages" button on the left side panel, which, as far as I understand, deletes all messages regardless of whether they are or not part of the currently displayed list (that is a search results list), 
* the individual delete button for a message, which doesn't help if the list of stuff to delete is too large (~100 messages in my case).
See log:

Send a mail without a `From:` header:

```
telnet localhost 1025

Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.

```

Then the mail list shows `{{ getSender(message) }}` as the sender.
