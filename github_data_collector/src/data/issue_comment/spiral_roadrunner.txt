Zend is now officially the Laminas project and we have to redo the dependency. This will be addressed in the next major release. Currently, we are thinking about removing Zend dependency entirely and replace it with https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7.

Note, you will experience BC break if you use Zend dependencies indirectly.
Hi,

This PR introduce logging capabilities for workers via RPC.

I know users can already logs by printing on `stderr`, but logs always appears with a `WARNING` level. It could be a great addition to be able to control log levels and fields.

This could make logs aggregations in containerised environment easier as apps could log directly on the container `stdout`.
Hello!

When I restart RoadRunner daemon it can not bind to the same port it was opened and returns errors like ERRO[0000] [metrics]: .... bind: address already in use

If i check thoses ports it says
tcp        TIME_WAIT   -

I googled the issues and looks like there's a issue with go lang when it does not reuse ports

https://github.com/nordicdyno/golang-tcp-port-reuse

Tested on linux \ ubuntu

Thank you.
Is thinkphp6 Supported?
How we can customize logs and change severity? I mean mechanism like [here](https://roadrunner.dev/docs/library-event-listeners)
First of all, thanks for your software. It's been a great experience working with it.

I moved my Symfony application to Roadrunner, which improved the performance, but New Relic integration does not seem to work.

I was wondering if anyone has successfully integrated it, or you have any tips on this.

Thanks in advance.
Need a new RPC method to register metric from the application, metrics must only be declared once so consecutive runs would have no effect.
Integrate https://github.com/tideways/php-xhprof-extension as the source of profiling data and pass this data into rr service via RPC. Store data in local db (BoltDB) or memory and share information about application performance via RPC or expose the port. Need UI.
there is support for run workers in background?
Add [Mercure](https://github.com/dunglas/mercure) or something similar.

But first, wait until https://github.com/dunglas/mercure/issues/105 solved.
