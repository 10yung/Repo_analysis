External commands were previously limited to Windows. There's no good
reason for this, so this adds support for Linux as well.

Fixes #122
Test: manually tried `whoami` and `git status`
Test: manually tried a not-found command, verified output looks good
cash Will not run a command outside of the included ones. If I try to run, for example, npm, it just shows the help menu. Yet, running echo works just fine, because it's built in.
When installing cash-touch
```
sudo npm install cash-touch -g -force
```
and running
```
> touch --help
```
I get this error:
```
Missing required argument. Showing Help:

sage: touch [options] <files...>

  Options:

    --help                  output usage information
    -a                      change only the access time
    -c, --no-create         do not create any files
    -d, --date [STRING]     parse STRING and use it instead of current time
    -m                      change only the modification time
    -r, --reference [FILE]  use this file's times instead of current time
    --time [WORD]           change the specified time: WORD is access, atime, or use: equivalent to -a WORD is modify or mtime: equivalent to -m
```
and it shows the help that is not the /dist/help/touch.js file.

This error only affects touch, from what I can tell
When running ```cat --help```, I get a Node.js error.

This error appears on all ```cash``` programs, and seems to be related to the parser.

Error:

I see that Cash doesn't have this support added yet.

This should be added!
I've not seen that much activity, since a while ago.
paste with shift insert or another keys, is possible?
This is an investigatory PR to study the introduction of a POSIX compliant shell code parser using [bash-parser](https://github.com/vorpaljs/bash-parser).

I studied the cash workflow, and I think the majority of changes in source code would concern [Vorpal](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal).

They could be implemented directly there (in vorpal core) or we could patch vorpal and implement it only for cash.
Hello!
I've found that something like `cash rm -rf ./dist/*` doesn't work while `cash rm -r -f ./dist/*` (separately) does work. But the first syntax is correct and widespread in Linux.
Everything works fine but it gives me this issue when I try to pull from my git repository.

> Permission denied, please try again.
Permission denied, please try again.

and the repository exists.

It doesn't give me this error when I exit out of cash, how would I go about to fix this?
