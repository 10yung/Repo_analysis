The box [win2012r2-x64-nocm](https://app.vagrantup.com/ferventcoder/boxes/win2012r2-x64-nocm) supports three providers: VirtualBox, VMware Fusion, and Hyper-V. I can find [the source for VirtualBox and VMware Fusion](https://github.com/ferventcoder/vagrant-windows-puppet), but not the one for Hyper-V. Would be cool if source for Hyper-V is also shared.
tl;dr the box should ship with an RSA host key instead of a DSA host key.

The 1.0.0 box version ships bitvise ssh server with the vagrant insecure ssh key (that is good) and a DSA host key (that is bad). From the OpenSSH docs:

> OpenSSH 7.0 and greater similarly disable the ssh-dss (DSA) public key algorithm. It too is weak and we recommend against its use.

To get `vagrant ssh` to work I have to use the bitvise gui to generate an RSA host key, then click `Employ` to enable it.
