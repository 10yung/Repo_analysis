Hello,
Is Ejecta still supported in 2019, and does it support tvOS 13?
Thank you in advance.
Is it possible to create a container html element so that I can integrate 2D html?
I believe I did setup everything correctly apart from Paid Apps - Agreements, Tax & Billing. According to stackoverflow this is the reason why testing IAP on sandbox user is not working.

I think it would be wise to give any information to the developer why the request is failing. I've debugged the native part of the binding and the "productsRequest" callback method (or rather delegate? I'm new to obj-c) is never called. Following stackoverflow further, I've added this piece of code to the implementation of "EJBindingIAPManager":
```
- (void)request:(SKRequest *)request didFailWithError:(NSError *)error {
    NSLog(@"IAP: request - didFailWithError: %@", [[error userInfo] objectForKey:@"NSLocalizedDescription"]);
}
```
But it still gives me nothing. I have single log in the xcode console apart from "IAP: Requesting product info: fvv.extraTime".
I think there should be a developer friendly message send to the js regardless of what kind of error happens, whether it's the developer not setting up thing correctly or apple server not responding in time. 
Right now you'd have to timeout the request by hand on js side and show generic error to the user.

What would be the way to catch all request errors in this situation? 
I just started learning obj-c yesterday so I feel a bit lost
Hello 😊

I know there's an issue https://github.com/phoboslab/Ejecta/issues/654 from 2016 about that. As I understand it was just after iOS 10 release with performance improvements that made Ejecta seem obsolete. 
But there is one issue, Safari/WKWebView/**Cordova games on LPM ('Low Power Mode') are limited to 33fps** on iOS, even if you have one rotating sprite on the screen.


It took me about a day to figure how to port my pixi.js Cordova-wrapped game to Ejecta and with some finishing touches I'm gonna be pushing it to AppStore review tomorrow. 
**I'm getting 50-55 fps on LPM with Ejecta on iPhone 6** rather than 33, and it's not very optimised game I believe (and therefore has weird framedrops).


I'm gonna let you know whether Ejecta is valid in 2019 from my perspective later (whether it will pass the review and I'll get steady 60 fps with Ejecta), 
but I'm interested to know, **is anyone else actually still using this technology?** Or does anyone know any better solution?
It seems like it has been abandoned around 2016/17, but right now, from my perspective it looks like its the only sane way to make iOS games that run 60fps on LPM.


@phoboslab what is your opinion on this? 
**Would you consider maintaining the project if it turns out to be the best solution the LPM problem?** 
With iPhones becoming more and more performant lack of JIT in Ejecta becomes less of an issue


BTW I know there is cocos2dx/creator, egret engine etc and ofc cordova. I've inspected those and Ejecta the most appealing solution IMO right now

BTW2 I'm using webpack+typescript+pixi@3 (and legacy coffeescript 🤷‍♂️) for this project if anyone's curious. 
It's a very smooth development experience so far, I really appreciate all the work put into Ejecta 👍
If I set the font on a 2D canvas using something like:

ctx.font = "100 10pt \"Helvetica Neue\""

Then the weight part of the string is mis-interpreted as 100pt, and the facename is ignored. See the code on line 179 of EJBindingCanvasContext2D.m

Adding support for this will also require that the weight is incorporated into the font's hash (calculated on line 19 of EJFont.mm) too.
I am using stream in my weex project, the apps crash everytime I try to run it on iOS simulator. It works fine on android though.

If I comment out the stream code (viz commenting the code where I am using stream and import is still uncommented) the application works fine on both the platform.

Considering that stream code is working fine on android concludes that there is nothing wrong with my Vue code (maybe I am not doing some iOS specific thingy).

Here is the code:

           stream.fetch({
                method: 'GET',
                type: 'json',
                url: 'https://example.com/someUrl.json'
            }, res => {
                if(res.ok){
                    this.isLoading = false;
                    this.isError = false;
                    
                    this.number = res.data.number;
                    this.name = res.data.name;
                }else{
                    this.isLoading = false;
                    this.isError = true;
                }      
            });

The error which I get is on the following line:

            callbackRsp setObject:@{ @"OPENED": @1 } forKey:@"readyState"];
            progressCallback(callbackRsp, TRUE);

The error is: 

            Thread 1: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x10)

Occuring on `progressCallback` line.

What I can think of is that it could be because of some package which I need to install or maybe version number of something is messed up because on playground it is working absolutely fine.

Any help would greatly appreciated.

Hi, I'm going to build an iOS app with nativescript and I want to use ejecta in my app but how can I import ejecta into nativescript?
iOS 11
latest Ejecta
Console errors I am getting in Xcode:
```
IAP: Restore transactions
JS ERROR: Error restoring purchases Cannot connect to iTunes Store
IAP: Requesting product info: fullgame
IAP: Purchase fullgame x 1
JS ERROR: Error buying product Cannot connect to iTunes Store
```
Has anyone tested IAPs with Ejecta and iOS 11 yet? I would love to help in any way I can I just want to know if I am doing something wrong or if an API changed.

For reference, I am using SplatJS game engine and the part of Splat that references Ejecta's IAP API is here:  https://github.com/SplatJS/SplatJS/blob/master/lib/iap.js

Adding support for [Path2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Path2D) would be extremely useful for reusing complex paths, instead of creating them on the fly each time we want them drawn.
Hello.

OpenAL can not set currentTime in milliseconds. Because AL_SEC_OFFSET is set in currentTime () and setCurrentTime () in EJAudioSourceOpenAL.m.

```
- (float)currentTime {
	float time;
	alGetSourcef( sourceId, AL_SEC_OFFSET, &time );
	return time/44100;
}

- (void)setCurrentTime:(float)time {
	alSourcef( sourceId, AL_SEC_OFFSET, time );
}
```

I want to set currentTime in milliseconds. So, I'd like to change the code as follows.

```
- (float)currentTime {
	float time;
	alGetSourcef( sourceId, AL_SAMPLE_OFFSET, &time );
	return time/44100;
}

- (void)setCurrentTime:(float)time {
	alSourcef( sourceId, AL_SAMPLE_OFFSET, time*44100 );
}
```

What do you think of the code above? Please comment it.

BTW, since I am not familiar with OpenAL, I do not know how to obtain sampling rate or monaural / stereo from the current context. sorry.


Thanks.
