I want to use OnLongClickListener.

I put an imageview inside the cardview and applied a blurview.

I applied longclick to Cardview. But when I clicked on the imageview, longclick didn't work.

I want to make longclick work when I hit the area of ​​Cardview. However, imageview has blurview, so it does not work in imageview area.

So I tried applying OnLongClickListener to the imageview to solve this.
 
But when I use OnLongClickListener for imageview, blurview doesn't work.

Please tell me the solution.
As "compile" is going to be deprecated end-2018, this PR replaces with "implementation" that is the new usage.

hi
if i don't add this line to my gradle , does it works ? 
and as i said in title why should i add `renderscriptSupportMode true` code ?
i used with listview but when i scrolling another view also hovered.
在对图片进行高斯模糊处理的Blur.java文件中，进行模糊之前先将要模糊的图片尺寸缩小，再对缩小的图片进行模糊处理，最后将图片放大，这样相比之前对图片处理的时间会缩小一半，而且模糊效果也会更加明显，理论上说ScriptIntrinsicBlur进行模糊的范围只能从0~25，而使用图片的尺寸缩放后进行模糊处理能突破这个范围的限制。

Please remove all ic_launcher in your com.daimajia.easing:library

When enableBlurBackground() is set to true, if you monitor the memory of the application, you can see that memory goes up each time you do hover.show(), but doesn't go down when you do hover.hide(). If you look at the code for onAnimationEnd() for mGlobalDisappearAnimators, you see that the image within mBlurImage is not freed. I believe this is what causes the memory leak.
