## Why?

The Merchant Warrior gateway does not support the `recurringFlag` field which is used to indicate if a transaction will be marked as recurring.

- CE-348

## What Changed?

- Added support for the `recurringFlag` field via a `recurring_flag` option on the `process` and `authorize` functions
- Added missing unit test for Merchant Warrior `authorize` function

## Test Suite Results

Unit:
```
17 tests, 92 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 pendings, 0 omissions,
0 notifications
100% passed
```

Remote:
```
15 tests, 81 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 pendings, 0 omissions,
0 notifications
100% passed
```
These were caught by a novel type inference system built on [RDL](https://github.com/tupl-tufts/rdl/).  I wanted to bring these to your attention, and also confirm whether they are true bugs so that we may better evaluate our inference system.

1) [Here](https://github.com/activemerchant/active_merchant/blob/master/lib/active_merchant/billing/credit_card_methods.rb#L196) there is no variable or method called `number`.

2) [Here](https://github.com/activemerchant/active_merchant/blob/master/lib/active_merchant/billing/base.rb#L52) `Billing::Integrations` appears to be undefined in this scope.
When using a payment token to make a `purchase` ActiveMerchant gets the subscription ID by [splitting the token at a semi colon](https://github.com/activemerchant/active_merchant/blob/661ecd74111b9c59605879e5cb0da8bf6dced500/lib/active_merchant/billing/gateways/cyber_source.rb#L734). 

However, the payment token I have which comes from [the flex method to tokenize a card](https://developer.cybersource.com/cybs-dev-api-ref/index.html#flex-flex-tokenize-card) doesn't contain a semi colon, which results in a blank string being sent as the subscription ID, failing the transaction.

Here is the code for reference:

```
gateway = ActiveMerchant::Billing::CyberSourceGateway.new(login: 'x', password: 'x')
gateway.purchase(100, 'THETOKEN')
```

ActiveMerchant Version: 1.98.0
CE-205

Unit:
36 tests, 179 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 pendings, 0 omissions, 0 notifications
100% passed

All remote tests pass between existing credentials and new credentials, but some things aren't yet turned on for new credentials (I've sent an email). 
CardConnect no longer requires ports to be included in their valid
domains, so this change removes that requirement, allowing customers to
use CardConnect domains without specifying a port.

[CE-209](https://spreedly.atlassian.net/browse/CE-209)

Unit:
22 tests, 92 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 pendings, 0 omissions,
0 notifications
100% passed

Remote:
25 tests, 58 assertions, 2 failures, 0 errors, 0 pendings, 0 omissions,
0 notifications
92% passed

Two failing remote tests:
 - `test_successful_refund`
 - `test_partial_refund`
Both of these tests are failing with the message "Txn not settled" and
are failing on master as well. The last commit to CardConnect (Oct 2019)
shows fully passing remote tests, so something appears to have changed
in the gateway integration since then. These new failures seem to be
unrelated to the changes made in this commit.

All unit tests:
4414 tests, 71334 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 pendings, 2
omissions, 0 notifications
100% passed

Is there any way to add pypay method of payment from payment express?
