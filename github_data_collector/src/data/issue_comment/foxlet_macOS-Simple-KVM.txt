After configuring the PCIe Passthrough, I went ahead and ran the basic script, however QEMU begins in a paused state, how do I get it to run?
If I try to install macOS in a VM, it takes absolutely forever - but it manages to complete the first installation step and then reboots. On rebooting, it then boots from the virtual disk it installed to. After a bunch of terminal text scrolls by, I get another loading bar - which then proceeds to get stuck several hours later. The first time to got stuck at ~2/3rds - when I force-rebooted it, it got stuck at 1/4 with "16 minutes remaining".

No keyboard or mouse. Just a stuck progress bar and a VM that doesn't appear to be using my host's resources at all - though the fan on said laptop does spin up when the macOS VM is booted.

Does anyone have any suggestions for diagnosing the issue? Without any logs it's extremely challenging to know what's gone wrong.
when I run ``sudo ./basic.sh`` to open QEMU, it will show the warning **_Press ESC in 2 Seconds to skip startup.nsh,any other key to continue_** , see below image:

![Press ESC in 2 Seconds to skip startup.nsh,any other key to continue](https://i.imgur.com/u6KWQak.png)

If I press continue, the CLOVER GUI will be showed and then I press **enter** to install macOS, the problem reoccurs, again and again if I press continue, see below images:

But I press **ESC**, the SHELL will be showed:

My environment:
- dual system: win10 and ubuntu
- PC: dell precision 5520

Thanks!

I'm wondering, this script does transparently download macOS and launch QEMU but the ESP.qcow2 can't be generated by the user AFAIK. (But this is my first try with Hackintosh). How did you created it @foxlet?
Hi.
Hope you are well.
Thank you for your MacOS, Ive been using it for the past few weeks.
I have a problem now.
I can not download the new checkra1n app, it says my storage is full.
Is there anyway of making the storage bigger?
I do not have anything else on the macOS..

Thank You.
Having support for Gnome Boxes would be nice especially for Fedora users as it comes preinstalled.
Anyone has added it? If so can you paste your gnome-boxes config file.
Thanks
