The installer boots up fine, but it cannot continue due to missing packages, in a local env the user would dump ISO contents to a folder and point the repo var to it, we don't have that option. 

Pinged their mailing lists about the possibility of hosting the ISO repo. 

Prob not gonna happen but keep this to track. 
ThinStation ( https://thinstation.github.io/thinstation/ ) has a live CD: 
https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/thinstation/LiveCD/TS-Multiclient-Desktop-LiveCD-Demo.iso

It boots to a simple desktop with all the major access tools (citrix rdesktop etc etc), very useful tool to have in the menu.

My initial testing is that their are options in the init for defining a squash URL and pxeboot (LM=3). They seem to be non functional . 
Boot snippet: 
```
kernel ${url}vmlinuz FASTBOOT_URL=http://192.168.10.13:8080/ LM=3
initrd ${url}initrd
```

Testing actions workflow
Add support for console customization where a user can change the background picture:

or leverage their own color scheme:

Investigate putting together hybrid bootloaders that compile legacy and UEFI iPXE bootloaders to cut down number of disks and make things easier.

Hi,
I am using a preseed file, inside the ubuntu installer, how do I configure the ubuntu installer static IP? how do I get around the DHCP?

I would like this to be fully automated.

Thanks.

Look into how we might be able to leverage iPXE Raspberry Pi support for netboot.xyz:

Appears to have been tested on 3B and 3B+ so far, UEFI firmware doesn't work with 4 yet.

It would be lovely to see support for multiple architectures, especially ARM
