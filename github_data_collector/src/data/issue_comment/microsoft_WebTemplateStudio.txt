PostGeneration modal is a big component containing functionality that depends on different generation scenarios. We should split this into subcomponents + add tests.

AppService Modal is a big component, we should split it into various subcomponents.
We should apply a unique wts.displayOrder to each page template and order pages in the wizard accordingly to ensure a consistent order. (In Mac pages are showing in a different order currently). 


We should review accessibility of generated apps and update related docs
Review telemetry reported from wizard and extension and identify metrics we want to add (f.ex Quick start usage, add pages button). 

Also update docs related to telemetry and update WTS Telemetry function to report monthly usage data from WebTS.
