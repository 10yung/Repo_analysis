We use `<Carousel layout={'default'} />` in our project. We use `onSnapToItem` to define, what user selects. 
Usually we have ~3 screens. Bug is very easy to reproduce for android. You need just to swipe to very start, or very end.
I think it is also related for center like described in:
https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/issues/635

We rely on `onSnapToItem`, and it must show correct index.
Maybe solution looks like workaround, but it solves this annoying problem.
We always get reports that a lot of users get the issue.

I suggest to go with this solution for now, and to change later to more proper way.

### Platforms affected
IOS and Android. 
Mostly android.

### Bug explanation
Right now it works like:
1) scrollEnd controller
         - call scrollTo
2) onScroll handler checks and emits `onSnapToItem` 

When scrollTo use same offset like ScrollView already has - there are no onScroll events. It prevent 2 step being called. This is how bug appears.
### Platforms affected

iOS, Android

### What does this PR do?

This PR is part of #632 
replaces `Animated`, `Easing`, `ScrollView`, and `FlatList` provided by react-native with `react-native-gesture-handler` and `react-native-reanimated`

### What testing has been done on this change?

Ran example App on iOS and Android Simulators

Yes.

### Is the bug specific to iOS or Android? Or can it be reproduced on both platforms?

Both platforms. Happens on all versions I've tested so far.

### Is the bug reproducible in a production environment (not a debug one)?

Yes

### Environment

  Environment:
    React: 16.9.0
    React native: 0.61.5
    react-native-snap-carousel: 3.8.4

  Target Platform:
    iOS (13.2.2)

### Expected Behavior

Dropping the control in the center of a new item should fire onSnapToItem, as it does when it dropped anywhere else.

### Actual Behavior

Dropping the control in the exact center of a new item doesn't fire onSnapToItem. But it does fire when moving away from the item. See the gif below.

### Reproducible Demo

https://snack.expo.io/S1rs_rpaB

### Steps to Reproduce

(Write your steps so that anyone can reproduce the issue in the Snack demo you provided.)

1. Select first item (if not already selected), the item with a `1`.
2. Drag the next item (`2`), and move it to the center of the screen, and release it when the black line in the item is perfectly aligned with the black line in the view behind it.
3. If perfectly aligned, onSnapToItem won't be called and carousel won't move.
4. If onSnapToItem is called, repeat the process until 3. is reproduced.

When I use `marginTop` in my parent View of Horizontal Carousel, I am getting some extra padding in the bottom. The padding increases as I increase the `marginTop`. 
<img width="245" alt="not_working" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11205673/70390617-860cfe80-19f2-11ea-8bc9-2966868e4d02.png">

I already tried the suggestions mentioned in https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/issues/489 and it didn't resolve the problem.


### Actual Behavior

There shouldn't be any padding at the bottom when I use marginTop in style of my parent View.


### Reproducible Demo

https://snack.expo.io/B1S-Ht96B


### Steps to Reproduce

1. Change marginTop value from 0 to 50%
2. You will observe the bottom padding keeps increasing with the same

## 🏆 Most required updates

Here are, ranged by order of importance, the most important updates the plugin currently requires.

### 1. Ditch `ScrollView` and `FlatList`, and implement a custom scroll logic based on [`react-native-gesture-handler`](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler) and [`react-native-reanimated`](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated)

**This is, by far, the most important step to be taken at this point.** It will open the road to a whole new level of features and user experience: total control over the scroll behavior, proper callback mechanism, better loop mode, better animations, better performance, proper RTL mode, no more "trailing slide whitespace", no visual differenciation between iOS and Android with the advanced animations, and, most importantly, [no more `FlatList` issues](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/doc/KNOWN_ISSUES.md#flatlist-and-scrollviews-limitations) to deal with 🙏

By itself, **this update will solve approximately 90 % of the currently opened issues!**

While it may seem like a daunted task, it happens that the folks at Software Mansion have created [their own version](https://github.com/CrowdLinker/react-native-pager) of the carousel that does just that, and they are totally open to sharing their work (in fact, `react-native-snap-carousel` [served as an inspiration for them](https://github.com/CrowdLinker/react-native-pager/tree/8f9ff3b36a7d6ababc8325441de4d03b3c027925#examples)). They've laid out a great base that just need to be improved and tailored to this plugin's needs.

Note that the idea **is not** to use their plugin because:

1. it lacks a few important features;
1. from their own admittance, it is still immature;
1. the hundreds of developers actively engaged with our plugin will help improving it faster.

<ins>Next steps</ins>

1. Take a look at [this discussion](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/issues/203#issuecomment-537049040) — a few key points to keep in mind are mentioned there.
1. Take a look at [this repo](https://github.com/CrowdLinker/react-native-pager) — this will serve as a great starting point.
1. Update the carousel's inner logic while making sure all the features are preserved. *(Again, **the `react-native-pager` plugin is not to be imported**, only to be used as a reference.)*
1. Progressively improve it thanks to user feedback and other developer's help.

### 2. Take care of miscellaneous bugs introduced in 3.8.x

- See #513, #552, #559, [#615](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/issues/615#issuecomment-557704438)...
- See [the release notes](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/releases/tag/v3.8.0); one (or maybe more) of those commits is to blame...

### 3. Handle dynamic data (addition/removal of items)

- See #157, #469, #554, #623...
- Will be made incredibly easier once #1 is implemented.

### 4. Prevent unneeded rerenders

- See #329, [#478](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/issues/478#issuecomment-554689775)...
- Will most probably be fixed once #1 is implemented.

### 5. Implement React hooks

- See [#238](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/issues/238?email_source=notifications&email_token=AB4IVRH3EMRVEB56ECUWZOLQUCE7LA5CNFSM4EJ2OMYKYY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFVREXG43VMVBW63LNMVXHJKTDN5WW2ZLOORPWSZGOEEH5Z4I#issuecomment-554687729), #559

### 6. Update examples

- See #257
### Is this a bug report, a feature request, or a question?
question

For the pagination component, is there a way for me to pass additional custom components inside to render and display on all instances of it? I want to create a button that a user can click on to navigate to a different screen and didn't know how to do this. I want to create something like this, where there is a button right underneath the pagination icons.

I have tried putting a button on each slide of the carousel to do this, and although it works, it looks a little messy having repeated text appearing/disappearing.

### Is this a bug report, a feature request, or a question?

This is a bug report/question since I'm not sure if it's just my use case for the library is wrong.

I'll try to provide a sample for the use case that I'm having problem with, and which I have also checked with the code inside of Carousel.js.

- First the carousel is fetched with a list of eg 4 items: [A, B, C, D], the initIndex will be 0.
- When the app get a push notification for updating the newest item, the dataset becomes [NewItem1, A, B, C, D] and trigger a render. I want to keep the current screen/card that the user is on, so in this case, I'll set the initIndex to 1 (to continue showing A). This works fine.
- User now swipes to NewItem1.
- App got push again, so the data is now [NewItem2, NewItem1, A, B, C, D]. As the app's behavior to keep the current card, the initIndex will still be 1 (to keep NewItem1 that the user swiped to). But inside `componentDidUpdate`, now the `interpolators.length !== itemsLength` is true and there is no new `hasNewSliderWidth` nor `hasNewItemWidth`, there was no snapping to fix the position to the `initIndex`. The carousel renders the first item NewItem2 rather than NewItem1.
- When I try keeping the same amount of data ([NewItem2, NewItem1, A, B]), the check for 
`nextFirstItem !== this._previousFirstItem && nextFirstItem !== this._activeItem` failed, as at this state the `nextFirstItem` and `this._previousFirstItem` are 1.

I could create a setTimeout to make the carousel snap to the new index again, but it would show flickering. So my question is could someone give me some hint on how I could achieve this behaviour without the setTimeout, or should I try to make a patch for this use case?

### Have you made sure that it wasn't a [React Native bug](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22react-native+bug%22+)?

Yes I'm sure it's not a React Native's bug

<!--
  Steps you should take:

    1. Take a look at plugin's issues that are [labelled `react-native bug`](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22react-native+bug%22+)

    2. Search [React Native issues](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues)

    3. Read the following sections of the doc again: ["Known issues"](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/doc/KNOWN_ISSUES.md), ["Important note regarding Android"](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel#important-note-regarding-android), and ["Custom interpolations caveats"](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/doc/CUSTOM_INTERPOLATIONS.md#caveats).
 -->

### Is the bug specific to iOS or Android? Or can it be reproduced on both platforms?

I have only tested on Android, but it should be able to be reproduced on IOS

### Is the bug reproductible in a production environment (not a debug one)?

Yes

<!--
  If you haven't been able to reproduce the bug in production mode, it probably has to do with React Native's limitations (see ["Known issues"](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/doc/KNOWN_ISSUES.md)). Chances are we won't be able to do anything about it.
-->
