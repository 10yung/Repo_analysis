Per recent contact with the Intune engineering team through their support channels, Windows 10 Home is not a supported platform for Intune enrollment or management on any hardware configuration. Not under S Mode, not on ARM; its lack of AD component support and appropriate CSPs renders it wholly incompatible with Intune MDM compliance & configuration profiles. Support engineering's direct indication is that Pro, Enterprise, and Education are the only supported OS editions for Intune management.

I think it would be good to include an example of the expected state of the autopilot device in Azure AD after having imported it via csv to autopilot. This way, admins can cross-check if their devices are being added correctly. For example - what is the expected join type for autopilot devices added by csv import - Azure AD Joined, Azure AD Registered, No Join Type?

It is not really clear to me if this page is supported for Android Device Administrator or for Android Work Profile.

Is it possible to make this distinction here?

It looks like it's available for deployment now via Configuration Manager, but if there's something about deployment via Intune/Endpoint Manager, I must be missing it. Currently, the only choices showing are Beta or Dev. 

Thank you!

"Neither DEP enrollment or Apple School Manager work with the device enrollment manager." 

What does this mean? One of my customer is assigned as a DEM in InTune Portal. He is unable to enroll his own iPhone and Azure AD logs do not provide any information. Please clarify the above statement from the documentation

Also, we would like a much clearer explanation in this documentation. Can DEM (user) enroll his iOS device at all if conditional access is enabled for "All Users" ?

Hi Team, 

As per https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/apps/lob-apps-ios the lob app (.ipa) file size can be 4Gb however that does not work and it is confirmed that it needs to be 2Gb as per https://icm.ad.msft.net/imp/v3/incidents/details/158071818/home this needs to be corrected asap in the document mentioned above.

Thanks
We have been testing feature update policies to stage the updating of a fleet of machines, and to ideally pin machines to builds of Windows 10 that are fully supported by the customers line of business applications. In testing these policies however, we found it simply doesn't work, all machines were pushed 1909 regardless of what build they were pinned to.

We have had a case open with Intune support, and they advised that this is both because this is a preview feature, but also that as older builds no longer exist on the catalog, it will simply get given whatever the latest build is. This seems to be counter to the documentation which implies you can set a build such as 1803 or 1809 (which is also what we had been testing on).

Can anyone confirm if this feature has even worked? or if there is some missing documentation to get it to work? As at this stage the response from support is it's a preview feature, and that it will only offer 1909 thus making it pointless.
