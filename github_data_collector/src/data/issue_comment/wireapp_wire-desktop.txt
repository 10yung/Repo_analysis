Using the newest wire-desktop release on linux, the audio devices are no longer recognized and therefore it is no longer possible to do audio calls.

Workaround: 
When starting wire with the --no-sandbox option and thereby disabling the chrome sandbox in electron6, everything works as expected. Maybe there is an option in the electron framework to allow devices within the sandbox that could provide a solution without disabling the sandbox

Is there a way to change the behavior of the electron sandbox that is active since the last release with electron6?
I would like to look into ways to tighten the electron sandbox used by wire. The Wire process does not need access to my private ssh keys...


· Wire version: 3.12.2916.
· Operating system: Debian Buster + Gnome 3.30.2 (X11).
· Installed from: Debian repository.


Tray icons look deformed. I usually solved this editing the icons (tray.badge.gnome.png and tray.gnome.png) cropping the unwanted space, but I cannot do it since asar packaging was added.

To login seamlessly. 

What is the actual result?

Red unexpected error below the login. 

Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if possible.

Note: stable release is [scheduled](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/electron-timelines) for 2020-02-04.

Wire version: 3.11.2912
Wire for web version: (not applicable)
Operating system: KDE neon 5.17.2 (Ubuntu 18.04.2) / 5.0.0-32-generic

What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Preferences > Options > Create previews for links you send
2. Enable timed messages (I used 1 week in my tests)
3. Send any URLs with proper Open Graph tags
4. Wait a couple seconds for URL previews to appear on your/sender's side

What is the expected result?

URL previews appear on recipient's side

What is the actual result?

URL previews still won't appear on recipient's side even by then, and it seems like they never will

Please provide any additional information below.

If it's an actual intended behavior, I guess at least disables URL previews on the sender's side when the messages are on timer. But still enable it when timer is disabled, if the preference is also enabled.
