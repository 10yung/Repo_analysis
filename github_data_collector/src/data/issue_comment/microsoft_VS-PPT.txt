Hello, I strongly wish that somebody can develop a plug-in that can continuously highlight the words. This is a great tool to help us understand the code,
just like highlight-words in vscode :https://github.com/rsbondi/highlight-words

With old color is hard to distinguish the text:

In VS 2019 the code-structure-marks on the vertical scrollbars for C++ code got lost from the VS 2015 version.
(There is also no option "Productivity Power Tools > Other extensions > Show code structure in the margin")
Is this by design?
Trying to install for VS 2019, the install fails, the log file includes:

Any ideas on what the problem is?
When placing the tab bar on the right side, arbitrarily fix one label and then unpin it, all labels will not be visible.

Productivity Power Tools 2013

I just tried to disable both **Clear Recent** commands using the Power Tools settings.  I have restarted Visual Studio several times, but those commands refuse to go away.  See [example screen cap](https://www.svalli.com/files/power-tool-bug.png) to see the way I have my settings and the way the menu looks when using those settings.
- The items listed in the **Clear Recent Projects List** dialog rarely match the items actually listed on the menu.  For example, see the image at [recent-bug.png](https://www.svalli.com/files/recent-bug.png)
- It doesn't help that the items in the list are so poorly formatted.
- There may once have been a reason for including {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000} _multiple times_ in **every** entry, but it really doesn't help us find things.
- The actual list shows each entry only once, while the dialog's list has some item multiple times.
- Selecting items for removal doesn't always remove the item with the same name, we suspect it may be more positional than referential.
- Even selecting ALL items for removal often results in a new list that may even contain some of the removed items or may be entirely new items.  So it appears impossible to simply _clear_ the recent projects list.

I would have noticed this sooner, but the name of this item on the menu kept me from ever choosing it until I wanted to completely remove all recent project history (due to a VS2019 bug that has some items stuck at the top of the list.)  That is what the name means to me and the other developers here.  Not sure what would be better, but adding the '...' to indicate that something more will be displayed before the list is cleared would be a start.  I know this is a duplicate, but since the original is **three years old** and changing the menu text should not be THAT difficult, it bears repeating.
If you go to the [marketplace ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioPlatformTeam.AlignAssignments&ssr=false#overview
) to read about the extension you get the following, which isn't very informative:
