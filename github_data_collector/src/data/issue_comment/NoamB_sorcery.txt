Hi all

Thank you for your work on this project.

I noticed that the wiki is still open. Some people from the https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery gem might find themselves on the wiki on this (now deprecated) site, which might lead to them following outdated tutorials.

I would recommend that the Wiki for this repo be closed or otherwise deleted. 

with kind regards

Is the fact that the session cookie doesn't get invalidated after signing out and that I can reuse it -- the normal behaviour, not a vulnerability?
An error occurred when trying to implement facebook login.
Implemented with reference to url.(https://github.com/NoamB/sorcery/wiki/External)

I am using version 0.11.0 with Rails 5.1.4. I was not using `remember_me` originally and just started trying to use it.

My sorcery.rb has this:

    Rails.application.config.sorcery.submodules = [:remember_me]
     ....

     config.user_class = "Person" #last line

My Person class this:

    class Person < ApplicationRecord
         authenticates_with_sorcery!

My people table has `remember_me_token` and `remember_me_token_expires_at`

I try to create the session like so:

    if @person && (@person = login(@person.email, params[:password], true)) <-- NoMethodError 
         redirect_back_or_to(admin_root_path, notice: "Login successful")

The error message is 

    undefined method `remember_me!' for #<Person:0x00000000049cff28>

Am I missing something?

I try facebook login referring [this external wiki](https://github.com/NoamB/sorcery/wiki/External) .
but I get this error

OAuth2::Error in OauthsController#callback
```
  if @user = login_from(provider)
```

{"access_token":"xxxxxxx", "token_type":"bearer","expires_in":5183999}


What should I do?

In my rails5 app, the email is ending up frozen, not sure why, but
it causes an exception trying to mutate frozen string. But of course
Sorcery ought not to be mutating the email input regardless.
Once user logged in using twitter aouth, in callback we get oauth token and oauth_token_provider.
if i need to post tweets in my account, twitter require access_token and access_token_secret so how can i get these params in response ?

To check if time between emails has not passed since last email. I just moved existing code into separate method and made this method public. Now It's handy to check if time is expired and show appropriate message in the ResetPasswordsController.
