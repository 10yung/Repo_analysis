How can I set an text next to the icon in the statusbar?

Thanks!

When clicking on the status bar icon, the window appears on the desktop screen rather than the screen with full screen application. What needs to be changing in order for this to work?

Fix issue when clicking icon on second monitor

Is there a way to enable dark mode for 10.10 so the icon is more visible when in dark mode?

Just a little adjustment : )

The popup window, if you click the star on an external monitor, doesn't open on the external monitor. Instead, the view flies over to the primary monitor and opens at the far-right of the display.

Since having menu bars on all monitors is new in Mavericks, I'm guessing that the app just hasn't been updated to work appropriately with this... To be honest, I'm not sure on how to fix it; anyone have any ideas?
