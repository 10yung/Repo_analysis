It seems that no matter what changes I make, upon a reload everything I did is undone. Obviously when you want to use this to play old 16 bit games this is a crippling disability as you can't properly install the game and saves are gone every restart.

Great job so far on the new version though!

An online version would be more useful. I know it's a bit of a joke (apparently) but I would probably find that useful. I know about v86 but this is better for some things.
when I try to load it it says "The code execution cannot proceed because ffmpeg.dll was not found. Reinstalling the program may fix this problem."

I don`t get it, how this application is available here when a bloatware McAfee (`antivirus`) automatically in the background installs itself. Not cool.
This project is awesome - thank you! 

I'm trying to run a Win95 app called Cs1xedit  that was designed to edit the parameters on a hardware synthesizer via MIDI. Any idea how I can access USB MIDI devices on macos through Win95?

TL;DR
IDGAF read through it so you don't brick your PC!!!!!

While reading through the threads I noticed that Windows 10 users are having alot of funny (as in, haha funny) problems with locating physical storage through the emulator.

I have the solution! Here it is:

YOU CANNOT READ ANY OF YOUR PHYSICAL DRIVE DATA! IT IS IMPOSSIBLE!

The reason you cannot read your drive is actually very similar to why you need this emulator in the first place -- incompatible old technology.

All Microsoft OSes before Windows XP ran on either a FAT16 or FAT32 file system. NTFS was never even introduced to Windows yet.

Which is why, in the past, if you upgraded to Windows XP, converted your file system to NTFS then tried to downgrade back to Windows 9x your computer would act as though your hard drive didn't even exist. You would have to reformat the drive and reconvert it to the original File Allocation Table.

The windows95.img file (which is the entirety of the emulator's virtual drive) is actually encoded in FAT32 format -- the virtual drive app I use - PowerISO - cannot read the .img file, but if you open it in WinRAR you'll notice it requires you to convert the files FROM FAT32 format before extracting.
Likewise if you ADD files to the .img (which is the ONLY way I've found thus far to add data to the emulator) the files are then exported in FAT32 format, because that is the only format that both Windows 10 and Windows 95 can read.

So, to add files to the virtual drive, try the following:
1) Create a small (let's say 10Gb) partition on one of your local drives, and have it formatted to a FAT32 file system. (Let's call it the "Ghost Drive") MAKE SURE YOUR PARTITION ONLY TAKES UP _**FREE SPACE**_ OR YOU WILL CORRUPT SOMETHING!!!
2) Extract the files from any images you are trying to install from, and copy them onto the Ghost Drive in their own unique folders (eg. Extract the files from the Quake install CD into a folder on the Ghost Drive named "Quake")
3) Open windows95.img in WinRAR.
4) Add your new install folders to the .img thru WinRAR and save your changes.
5) Start the emulator from scratch.

After this, your folders should be visible. Just remember, if you are using Windows XP and above you will NEED a FAT32 partition somewhere on your physical system to transfer files to the emulator without causing crashes.

Bump this for relevence and please label "Solution in Issue." It it NOT just the difference between 16-bit and 64-bit. It's also the difference between FAT16/32 and NTFS file systems.
The file windows95.exe was flagged by the following:
AVG reported it as FileRepMalware
Aegis reported it as Trojan.Win32.Generic.4!c
MacAfee reported it as Artemis 

In addition, it was stopped from silently accessing the url: diggingrationspace.com

Hi,

I am trying to download The Game of Life from my mac onto the windows95 emulator. I was trying to follow the instructions under "download additional apps and games" FAQ, but it wasn't clear on how to do this on a Mac. I'm not understanding by what you mean "show disk image." 

Can you clarify the steps a bit more?

Thank you for the help,

‚ö†Ô∏è Thank you for reporting an issue!

Before we go any further, understand that I probably won't be able to fullfil feature requests.
Feel free to report what feature you'd love to see, just don't get angry when I don't have
time to implement it üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I will however _gladly_ help you make a pull request if you're willing to play with Javascript!
