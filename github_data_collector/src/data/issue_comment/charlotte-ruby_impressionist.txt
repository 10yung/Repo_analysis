I see hundreds of these messages every day. How do I fix this? Here is the link to the code: [https://github.com/charlotte-ruby/impressionist/blob/master/lib/impressionist/counter_cache.rb#L69](https://github.com/charlotte-ruby/impressionist/blob/master/lib/impressionist/counter_cache.rb#L69)

ISSUE:
Update to rack prevents session id to coerce into a string
Please find changes here:
https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/cc1d162d28396b6a71f266e6a40ffc19a258792b#diff-681da9662953fa2d37d188d52d1acfaeR31

We are trying to store this into a string on impressions.session_hash which will try to convert it into string before storing.

Just added impressionist to my Rails 6.0 (ruby 2.6.3) project found two deprecation warnings:
```
DEPRECATION WARNING: Initialization autoloaded the constant ImpressionistController.

Being able to do this is deprecated. Autoloading during initialization is going
to be an error condition in future versions of Rails.

Reloading does not reboot the application, and therefore code executed during
initialization does not run again. So, if you reload ImpressionistController, for example,
the expected changes won't be reflected in that stale Module object.

`config.autoloader` is set to `classic`. This autoloaded constant would have been unloaded if `config.autoloader` had been set to `:zeitwerk`.

Please, check the "Autoloading and Reloading Constants" guide for solutions.
```
And another one here
```
DEPRECATION WARNING: ActionDispatch::Http::ParameterFilter is deprecated and will be removed from Rails 6.1. Use ActiveSupport::ParameterFilter instead. (called from associative_create_statement at /Users/Julien/.rbenv/versions/2.6.3/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/impressionist-1.6.1/app/controllers/impressionist_controller.rb:54)
```

Change the bot filtering system to use the device detector gem.

Very straightforward swap to use a much better maintained list, however introduces an external dependancy. Also updates the rake task.

Took the liberty to also fix some issues with the CI.
The crawlers list was out of date, and was especially ineffective for facebook bots. 
I moved to a more maintained one.

Hi, is it possible to track the views of all the website ?

Thank's !
Hello!

I am suddenly receiving a lot of `PG::CharacterNotInRepertoire` exceptions coming from chinese IPs. I don't know if this is an attempt at an attack or regular visitors. I can't seem to see in the environment variables at the time of the exception where these characters are coming from but I am guessing that this comes from either inserting the `request_hash` or the `referer` as impressions.

The full exception message:

> PG::CharacterNotInRepertoire: ERROR:  invalid byte sequence for encoding "UTF8": 0xe8 0x6c 0x65`: INSERT INTO "impressions" ("impressionable_type", "impressionable_id", "controller_name", "action_name", "request_hash", "ip_address", "session_hash", "referrer", "params", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11) RETURNING "id"

Using:
- `impressionist` v1.6.1
- `rails` v5.1.0
- `pg` v0.18.1

So that impressionist does not stop the website from being browsed I fixed this temporarily by adding to my `ApplicationController`:

```rb
def impressionist(_record)
  super
rescue PG::CharacterNotInRepertoire
end
```

Any hints on how to fix this properly?
First of all, thank you so much for this gem, it looks great and the documentation is crystal clear. 

My question -
We have a `Video` model which we want to track 2 types of impressions for - views and downloads
I'm using the `impressionist` method with the `message` param to differentiate between them:
impressionist(@video, 'view', unique: [: ip_address, :message])
impressionist(@video, 'download', unique: [: ip_address, :message])

Is there a way to manage two different cached fields for this model, where each one updates by the type of event?

Thanks again!
For example:

 I'm using the `impressionist` method directly, taking all of the `Jobs` on the page and logging an impression. The problem is because I'm only recording unique impressions, for records that already have an `impression`, these additional calls are redundant. I tried to use `@jobs.includes(:impressions).each` to preload the associated data hoping Rails was smart enough to figure out which records existed, but Rails still outputs numerous `Impression Exists` queries.

    @jobs.each{|job| impressionist(job,'', :unique => [:session_hash])}
