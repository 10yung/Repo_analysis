I need to change in week view, Like I need Monday on the very first of view and rest as continuos. I could not able to do it through the library and also can't able to find any Questions regarding this. Also, need to change in the text whether the default is coming with three characters and I need only a single character.

Apart from that I also need to change the color of the whole week's view. text color is fine but I need to change the view's color. 

I'm adding an image below exactly what I want.

Like this below photo:

I am using this library from the beginning and now I came across the issue that it doesn't scroll to today's date. It just stops to previous month's date. Anyone have this issue? Following code I have used.

`func setupJTCalendar() {
        self.dayCollectionView.cellSize = 60.0
        self.dayCollectionView.minimumLineSpacing = 0
        self.dayCollectionView.minimumInteritemSpacing = 0
        self.dayCollectionView.scrollToDate(Date())
        self.dayCollectionView.selectDates([Date()])

        self.dayCollectionView.visibleDates { (info) in
            if let data =  info.monthDates.first {
                self.dayCollectionView.scrollToItem(at: data.indexPath, at: .left, animated: true)
            }
        }
    }`

Hi, I want to ask if it is possible to select startDate and endDate from the calendar when it is displayed in the viewcontroller. In other works user can select two dates of choice.
I am programatically trying to set the date to a different date than today. 

Here is the code i used still its not working. It always selects todays date.

_calendarManager = [JTCalendarManager new];
    _calendarManager.delegate = self;
    NSDate* dt1= [_calendarManager.dateHelper addToDate:[NSDate date] days:2];
    [_calendarManager setMenuView:_calendarMenuView];
    [_calendarManager setContentView:_calendarContentView];
    [_calendarManager setDate:dt1];

Here dt1 is 19th. but its still only highlighting 17th. I am stumped.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Jonathan,

I installed JTCalendar into my project through Cocoapods and it was working till swift 4.0. After swift 4.2 migration it was not working. Delegates or datasources are not firing. 

I updated JTCalendar to version 2.2. but still it was not working. Could you please suggest a workaround.
I have used the JTCalendar to display the calendar data of my application. When the current day is selected, the view is positioned properly. When I scroll the view to see the next month the days are scrambled. How do I set the position of Sunday fixed to left corner.
Build failed to swift 4.2 migration
