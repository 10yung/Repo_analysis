In Wox, they had an option to called "make topmost in this query", i would like to see this feature but it's fine if it's not possible
Is it possible to have google search suggestions in websearch plugin?
If a folder listed in the "Application Folders" section "Folder Path" is invalid, it causes all other, valid "Folder Path" listing to fail.  When this happens, the index doesn't include any Application listings and nothing displays when you attempt to launch an application.  Note that UWP and other plug-ins will continue to work without issue.

There is currently no notification to the user of an invalid folder path or ability to ignore and Skip failed folders listed in the index.  It would be helpful to add better error handling here and a notification to the user if one of the indexed folders is invalid / no longer reachable.
This is a work-in-progress on the Czech translation, about 30% done. Please feel free to contribute any feedback, corrections or other comments.
I am a native Czech speaker and I try my best, however I am not a professional translator, so I apologize if the quality is not 100%.
I do have activated the "Application Search" and "Use native icons" option it is activated.

However the native icons of the apps are not displayed correctly, instead of them there is only a dummy icon and if I press the "Application folders" refresh button I get the following error message:

`{ "level": "error", "service": "user-service", "timestamp": "2020-01-04T10:44:14.230Z" }`
I am using the Cmd+Space to launch the LaunchBar launcher on my Mac. One of the nice features this launcher have is the possibility to quickly switch between the opened apps by continuing pressing the Cmd key and by pressing repeatedly the space-bar key to select one of the opened apps. By releasing the key combination it is switching to the desired opened application. It is possible to add such a feature in Ueli?

Will be nice to have a feature like pressing the Alt+Spacebar key to show the active app and pressing again the spacebar to show a list with the opened apps and select the next one in order from top to bottom? Actually right now, if I press Alt+Space twice, Ueli search window just appears and disappears which it is not so useful.
On my MacOS 10.14.6 installation of Ueli, seems that it is not possible to use the PageUP and PageDown keys to quickly switch between the page results if there are more results that are filling multiple pages. I can only use the Up and Down arrow keys which is much slower when dealing with a lot of results.
I just installed Ueli latest release version on my MacOS 10.14.6 and tested a little bit to check how behaves comparing with my LaunchBar6 and I do found some issues and possible feature requests.

When closing and starting again, Ueli seems to don't remember the position of the window. I set the window position to the very top of my screen, but if I do close the app and start again, the search window will be displayed at a lower position that the one I do setup. Seems that it is not remembering between sessions the position of the window.
I think that a useful thing to add is a small banner with something like "update available" that notify the use of a possible update to do.
maybe something positioned in a spot like this

Browser bookmarks seems to only detect Chrome on my machine. Using Brave (a Chromium browser) full-time, wasn't sure if Ueli could be extended to find Brave bookmarks also.
