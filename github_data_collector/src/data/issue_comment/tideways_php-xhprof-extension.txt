We have tried to use tideways xhprof on one of our servers, which for reasons outside our immediate control still runs on PHP 7.1.

The extension runs, but on every third request (as far as we could determine) we get a segfault. PHP is setup with FPM, and as far as I can see we had two children running. So every third request could well be the second request to a given FPM child. Apparently it doesn't matter which script we are calling, the same script can run fine and produce a profile and then segfault the next time.
We tried with version 4.1.7 (from ubuntu PPA of Ondrej Sury) and 5.0.1 downloaded from github release page. Both result in a segfault, although with different stack traces.

Stack trace from 4.1.7:

As the stack traces are quite different I am not entirely sure it is the same issue or not, but from the outside view it shows the exact same symptoms.

My knowledge of gdb is pretty much exhausted at this point, so if we can provide more useful details, please advice us. I will leave the relevant stack traces lying around for the time being.
I've upgraded my desktop from Windows 7 to 10, without any changes to my portable Apache/MySQL/PHP web stack.

After the update having tideways_xhprof binary enabled started to crash Apache on general browsing of PHP pages (not trying to profile) with following message:

```
AH00428: Parent: child process 1700 exited with status 3221225477 -- Restarting.
```

Binary version `php_tideways_xhprof-5.0.0-master-39806cc8-7.3-vc15-x86_64.dll`

Any pointers how can I try tweak or troubleshoot this?

Any idea what's wrong?
