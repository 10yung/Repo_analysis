As you can see in the attached picture some of the entries of SimSim seems wrong. I think they appeared recently with iOS 13? I'm post 1.4.3 release (commit 206df9c6723d1dae19949971b342808af91d69d7)
Can anyone advise?

Thanks for your valuable work!

LSSharedFileList was deprecated in OS X 10.11.
Proposed alternatives:
LaunchAgent, XPCService or the ServiceManagement APIs.

Currently it is used for the "start at login" feature.
Look at `Settings.swift`
If you try to click and drag on the app's icon, especially when installing it from the release DMG, it's difficult to draft because the transparent region in the middle is not draggable. I'm not sure if there is a way to specify the clickable region of an icon, so it might be easier to just fill in the icon with some opaque or semi-opaque pixels.
