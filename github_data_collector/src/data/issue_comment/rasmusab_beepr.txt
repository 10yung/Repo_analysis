Hi @rasmusab ,

I added the "easy" sound to your package. We love to push the "easy" Button in our office - and it would be cool to do this when finishing long running tasks using beepr.

Cheers, Christoph
It could be convenient to be able to call `beep(sound)` as a noop, i.e. such that it returns immediately if `sound = -1` or `sound = "none".
Based on the code from the package I'm working on ([catchr](https://github.com/burchill/catchr)), I think I've written `beep_on_warning` in such a way that it doesn't halt/restart the process it's wrapping when it plays the sound.

Additionally, I've written a function, `beep_on_condition`, which is a generalized version of both `beep_on_warning` and `beep_on_error`. You can wrap an expression and supply a named list as a parameter, which lets you decide which sound(s) each different condition triggers.

Tell me if this doesn't solve the issue that you mention in `beep_on_error`!  If it works, please attribute me :)

A recent tweet increased attention to the package: https://twitter.com/brandmaier/status/964425470358913024

In the discussion, someone suggested that we really need the sad trombone sound as part of the package. This change adds sad trombone using a public domain file.
Not sure if you’re accepting new sounds to the beepr package, but I thought it would be fun to try!  The sounds worked on my machine…but this is the first real pull request I’ve made, so there might be other compatibility issues.
This is based on the twitter thread from yesterday.
