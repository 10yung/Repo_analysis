<!-- Make sure that you are submitting a new bug that was not previously reported or already fixed -->

<!-- Please use a concise and distinct title for the issue -->

### Expected behaviour

<!-- What should have happened? -->

When I add an URL like `https://www.gnu.org` which is shorter than 23 characters, it must “cost” its real size (19 characters in my example).

### Actual behaviour

<!-- What happened? -->

When I add an URL like `https://www.gnu.org`, it cost 23 characters.


### Steps to reproduce the problem

<!-- What were you trying to do? -->

- On the web interface
- in the new toot box
- write the URL `https://www.gnu.org`

The caracter counter is now `477` instead of `481`

### Specifications

<!-- What version or commit hash of Mastodon did you find this bug in? -->

I'm using mastodon `v3.0.1`.

<!-- If a front-end issue, what browser and operating systems were you using? -->

I'm using firefox `72.0.1-1` from Debian Sid.

A user on my instance was trying to migrate accounts from an instance we have suspended. I assume this is not possible (fair enough!, we temp. unblocked to work round that). The problem is that instead of the user being told what the problem is, they get this:

> I'm trying to set an alias in order to migrate here, but I just get "Something isn't quite right yet! Please review the error below" with no error message below.

Both instances are on version 3.0.1
### Pitch

It should be possible to update the URLs of any attachments on a remote status in some way.

### Motivation

Domains change, and media hosting from a few months ago may no longer be accessible. The attachment is almost always still available from the public version of the message.
We can go back to rack 2.0.8 or we can update to the current git version to fix this: https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1428
- Fix unused role routes being generated
- Remove unused JavaScript code
- Refactor filters code to be DRYer
- Fix `.count == 0` comparisons to `.empty?` in views
To prevent new join in self-destruct sequence is running, Close registration first.
Instead of this fix, or in addition to that, I wonder if it would make sense to directly fill the items instead of pending items when there are no items yet
### Expected behaviour

1. Upload webm
2. Video shows below the text input for the toot

### Actual behaviour

1. Upload Webm
2. Upload finishes, then video disappears

### Steps to reproduce the problem

Upload a webm of around 25MB
