Nice Carousel ;) Thanks for Your amazing work!!
I have a little "bug" found:

If the picture-url contains any white-spaces it will not be displayed.
For instance: http://webserver/pictures/my picture.jpg   returns:
http://webserver/pictures/my%20picture.jpg to display.

But this "%20" html-insert for white-spaces let the images not shown in the swiper.
Whats the reason??

* [x] bug
* [ ] enhancement
* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)

* Swiper Version: v5.3.0
* Platform/Target and Browser Versions: All platforms/browsers (tested on Chrome 79 on Linux)
* Live Link or JSFiddle/Codepen or website with isssue: Tried putting a Codepen together but wasn't successful (it's not that I wasn't able to reproduce the problem, I just couldn't get the slider to work properly at all).

### What you did
Set-up a slider consisting of multiple variable-width images that utilize the lazy-loading functionality in Swiper along with setting `slidesPerView: 'auto'`.

### Expected Behavior
For the slides to be correctly positioned at all times, no matter if lazy loading of variable-width images is used or not.

### Actual Behavior
The slides get incorrect offsets. Both on initial load (since things go wrong as soon as one image has lazily loaded) and as you start swiping/navigating.

### Temporary Solution
Use the `lazyImageReady` event to update Swiper using the internal function `updateSlides` as well as the function `slideTo`:

```javascript
on: {
  lazyImageReady: function() {
    // Swiper doesn't update the positioning of the slides once a lazy image has actually loaded,
    // which causes them to get incorrect offsets. This is only a problem when the slides vary in size,
    // which is the case here since we load images of varying widths. Fix it by using the internal
    // function updateSlides() as well as running slideTo() to the current slide after every lazy
    // image has finished loading.
    this.updateSlides();
    this.slideTo(this.activeIndex, 0, false);
  }
}
```
(this snippet goes inside of your Swiper config, see the API docs for info on how to use events this way)

I might try again later to put a codepen together, but no matter what I'd be willing to help out fixing this as long as I can get some more insight into the codebase and whether my temp. solution is along the correct lines (I mean it works so I'd think it should be).

### Expected Behavior
When changing to another slide on the left ( = to a slide with a lower index), the inline-style width of the first displayed slide is set on the related DOM element - as it is done for all other slides in the DOM.

### Actual Behavior
When changing to another slide on the left ( = to a slide with a lower index), the inline-style width of the first displayed slide is _sometimes_ (often) not set on the related DOM element. It is only recalculated when forcing an update by doing some further action or when calling swiper.update()  in the swiper.transitionEnd() event.

This is a (multiple allowed):
* [ ] bug

* Swiper Version: 4.4.5 -> Latest
* Platform/Target and Browser Versions: **All major browsers**

Working scrollbar: https://codepen.io/joel-sweetman/pen/PowayWb
Video demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aM0iwwrghFpdO1L54avaWx0HAOnJ0Mel/view

Non-working scrollbar: https://codepen.io/joel-sweetman/pen/ExaRedR

### What you did
Downgrading Swiper from 4.4.5 to 4.4.2 will fix the issue with the scrollbar not being draggable. Issue persists in all versions post-4.4.2.
**Is caused by change in Line 7 to Support.js**. Commit ID is `df41dc9`.

### Expected Behavior
Swiper scrollbar is to be draggable.

### Actual Behavior
Scrollbar behaviour breaks despite `scrollbar: { draggable: true}` being set.

### What you did
Use Swiper within a shadow DOM.

### Expected Behavior
Seeing the icon font rendered in the prev / next buttons.

### Actual Behavior
No icons are shown, instead the texts "prev" and "next" are visible.

This seems to be more like a browser bug. Seems like `@font-face` isn't supported at all within shadow DOM. I'm reporting it here anyway just in case, since Swiper uses the icon font by default since v5.0.0. Chrome bug report: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=336876
Other issues related to fonts within shadow DOM: https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/1875 https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/2072

This was asked before here: https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper/issues/1482
and was closed as answered, but I don't see what the full answer was.
The suggestion that:

> Just add some HTML Markup inside the Slide Div, like:
> ...
```
> <div class="swiper-slide">
>    <img src="image">
>    <div class="caption">your Text</div>
> </div>
```
> ....

Doesn't work when I try it (I'm using 'demo-310'.

I then added the '.text' css from 'demo-360' to 'demo-310'
and still no caption/text displays,  & tried it with both class names 'text' & 'caption'

What I'm looking for is ability for text to display over the image.
ideally:
- with some timed transition (so that the full image can be seen for a moment before the text appears)
- perhaps with an opacity layer behind the text (so that it can be read more easily).

This is a :

* [?] feature-discussion (RFC)

* Swiper Version: 3.5.0.
* Platform/Target and Browser Versions: All (well as many as poss ;)
* Live Link or JSFiddle/Codepen or website with isssue: none yet

P.S.   I asked the question here - as it had already been asked.
If it's better asked/dealt-with in Stack Overflow, please let me know.

Tks for any help/guidance

This is a:

* Swiper Version: **5.3.0**
You can see this on Swiper's own demo.
https://swiperjs.com/demos/110-slides-per-view.html

### What you did
Use the mouse to drag slides, when you get to the end the slides get stuck and the next navigation arrow isn't in the disabled state.

### Expected Behavior
To spring back like it does when you try and go back from the first slide.

### Actual Behavior
The slides get stuck and the next navigation arrow isn't in the disabled state.
Hi! :slightly_smiling_face:

This PR simplifies code contributions by automating the dev setup with Gitpod(A free online VS Code like IDE), with a single click it will launch ready to code workspace with all the dependencies being pre-installed and the build & dev scripts in process, so that anyone interested in contributing can start straight away.

It seems to work well. You can give it a try on my fork of the repo via the link below:

This change is based on the following open issue: 

https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/issues/3232

I have come across the same issue in my project and have amended the script as per the PR, which has resolved the issues on MS Edge and Chrome on Windows based devices.
