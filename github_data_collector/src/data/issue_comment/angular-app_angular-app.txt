Dear Sir
       If there is any software to run/excute Angular JS application offline(without internet connection). 
I want to deploy this locally and followed the instructions. I got stuck where I have to create a DB on mLab and connect to it. I got the API key, but unable to find the URL similar to "dbUrl: 'https://api.mongolab.com/api/1" from mLab. They have two ways to connect apparently,  using mongo shell and  Mongo DB URI. nothing starts with HTTPS://.....  Secondly, what is a user collection and how can I create a one from mLab?

mongo: {
    dbUrl: 'https://api.mongolab.com/api/1',    // The base url of the MongoLab DB server
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',                // Our MongoLab API key
},
security: {
    dbName: 'YOUR_DB_NAME_HERE',                // The name of database that contains the security information
    usersCollection: 'users'                    // The name of the collection contains user information
},
when i execute grunt Console prompt me 
"Can not find the binary C:user\Administrator\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
Hi all,
When i call /auth/facebook by using 
```
$http.get('auth/facebook').then(response){
// response.data will be a html content(of url: https://www.facebook.com/login.php?
//skip_api_login=1&api_key=....). It's not auto redirect to /auth/facebook/callback
}
```
If i call it on browser, it work fine.
How can i fix it. Thanks for your help!
Here route definitions are placed inside each controller (https://github.com/angular-app/angular-app/blob/master/client/src/app/dashboard/dashboard.js)  instead of single file. 

Problem with this approach is if you have any dynamic route ( for ex /:catchAll ) in any controller and that controller is coming very first  (or before other controllers) then it will catch all the routes and there is no way to order routes now.

So any other approach ?

Can't click `save` when i filled new project fields. There's no error, just simply can' create project.

Hi,

How I can implement angular datatables server side pagination with search, limit, sort options?

Thanks in advance.

Following instructions carefully. Did not change default credentials in server/lib/initDB.js.

Attempting to login as admin@abc.com / changeme.  Getting "Login failed. Please check your credentials and try again."

Manually added user admin@abc.com / changeme to the mongolab database I created.  Still failing to log in to web app

Please add proxy support. Currently it throws exception if proxy is required (for all http connections).

Exception: 

```
events.js:72 
              throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event

Error: connect ECONNREFUSED
      at errnoException (net.js:904:11)
```

I added these two lines into initDB.js: 

```
var restDef = require('request');
var rest = restDef.defaults({proxy: "http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@PROXY_IP:PORT"});
```

So command 'node server/initDB.js' works. 
But  'node server.js' doesn't (it throws exception above).
