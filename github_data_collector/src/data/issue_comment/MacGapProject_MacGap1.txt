"Pleaase Sync"
只能设置宽度，希望能设置高度大小。

Hi

I'm unable to use the File Upload dialog to select multiple files in MacGap using the following HTML5 element.

`<input type="file" multiple="multiple">`

This works fine in my Safari (and is supposed to be fully supported since Safari 5.0)

User Agent in my MacGap:

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_4) AppleWebKit/600.7.12 (KHTML, like Gecko) MacGap

Please add an API method to determine if the MacGap window is active and visible (similar to https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-visibility).

First of all, MacGap is amazing. Have to get that out of the way.

I know that all new development is going into MacGap 2, but I wanted to post here in case anyone else runs into this issue. 

I've found that on Yosemite, macgap.window.isMaximized() sometimes returns 0 when the window is maximized and sometimes returns 1 when the window is not maximized. 

I don't know enough about Cocoa to say why this is, but am thinking a good workaround at this point is to use javascript/jQuery w/o the MacGap commands:

var myIsMaximized = screen.height == $(window).height() && screen.width == $(window).width();

Hello, 
I'm using the macgap.notice.notify to trigger notifications, but I can't see anywhere where I can add a click listener to do something on my webapp.

`macgap.notice.notify({
                        type   : 'sheet',
                        title  : header,
                        sound  : false,
                        content: message
                    })`

Does anybody know how to? 

The API will return BASE64 string format of Image. You can add "data:image/png;base64," prefix and set to <img> src attribute, it will be shown as html5 data uri image.

If you want to mock a html5 File Object to upload or do some other things. There is the code:

``` javascript
var imgData = window.macgap.clipboard.pasteImage();
if (!imgData) return;
var byteString = window.atob(imgData);
var ia = new Uint8Array(byteString.length);
for (var i = 0; i < byteString.length; i++) {
  ia[i] = byteString.charCodeAt(i);
}
var file = new Blob([ia], {type: 'image/png', encoding: 'utf-8'});
```

I just got bit _badly_ by this one, in colindean/irccloud.app#9. Looks like installing the `macgap` helper gem uses a version of MacGap released _two years ago_, and it doesn't have much of functionality available in MacGap 1, let alone MacGap 2.

The instructions to use that gem should probably be removed, or marked with a caveat that it uses a considerably older version.

It would, however, still be incredibly nice to have that gem available and working correctly. It's greatly simplified development of my little app.

We now have a twitter account, so you can keep up to date more easily.

Just a heads-up that MacGap 2 is very nearly in beta and should be considered ready to test.

Check it out!

The documentation site at http://docs.macgap.com is incomplete at present, but is a focus for us at this point.

MacGap 1 will only see minimal further development from this point on.
