Hi I've put a bit of testing into the thing implicitly calling pigz if it's there and using alternatively xz which is always executed in multithreaded mode in favor of speed. xz packs a whole lot of extra ratio. ;c)

set var `LANG=en_US.UTF-8` could fix it.

Hi,

pishrink works wonderful:
pishrink.sh v0.1.2
pishrink.sh: Copying idroid-201912-rasp+omv.img to idroid-201912-rasp+omv-shrunk.img......
pishrink.sh: Shrunk idroid-201912-rasp+omv-shrunk.img from 15G to 2,1G...

saves 13G! 
thanks for the script! 

Some observations:
- have to wait wait pretty long before it begins printing anything. So perhaps an idea is to begin with saying somethink like: reading in data, this can take a while

- it could not read in an image with brtfs and asked if it was perhaps ufs. No big deal.

Thanks for the disk-space saver! Also used it to migrate to a bigger sd-card, worked wonderfully! 

The debian package pigz contains a zip variant which uses all CPUs when shrinking. This speeds things up a lot on today's multi-core machines.
I suggest to test if pigz is present and then use it instead of gzip.

thanks a lot for this script!
/thorsten
It looks like everything is going fine, but at the end I get:

Line 287

Error: Can't have overlapping partitions.

Any hint?

Hi,

I am trying to shrink my Rapsbian Lite copy but errors occurred when I run the script:

Below is the error when I run the script for the first time:

Since the second time run, the error becomes as follows:

Please advise if I can do anything to make it work.

Thanks
As far as I can see, there's two options regarding expanding. Expand to max size of sd card or don't expand at all.
Is it possible to choose a size to which the image expands? E.g. Expand a 0.xGB image to 2GB although it's a 8GB sd card.
Hi,

I'm try'n to get PiShrink to work.
But when i enter the code for execute the script, the script is gatherin data for a whole day, and nothing happens. The only thing i see, is that there is a disk mounted.
Can anybody help me out?

balouken@balouken-VirtualBox:/media/sf_PiShrink-master/pi$ sudo chmod +x pishrink.sh
[sudo] password for balouken: 
balouken@balouken-VirtualBox:/media/sf_PiShrink-master/pi$ sudo ./pishrink.sh RegaladV4.img
pishrink.sh v0.1.2
pishrink.sh: Gatherin data...

This change allows proper expansion of ArmbianOS on eMMc module on RockPro.
