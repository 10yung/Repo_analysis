Clone and remider of: https://github.com/git-ftp/git-ftp/issues/198

This is the same issue. Dockerized latest Debian with version 1.5.1 git-ftp. Upload empty 0 byte files with submodule name instead of uploading the thing.

What ever you did in 1.6.0 UNRELEASED works because I swapped out the /usr/bin version and 1.6.0 uploads the whole thing like it's supposed to.


Pics or didn't happen

Hello,

When I add a password with **git config git-ftp.password "my_password"**, everyone can read the password. I want to use encrypted password, 

I have search in Google and I don't find a solution to do that.

Can you help me please ?

Thank you.
I am using bitbucket, where I have `master` and `dev` branches, currently `dev` is set as default branch.
I have only initial commit in `master` branch (readme.md).

Directory structure of my project is:
dev/backoffice (angular app)
dev/backend (laravel app)

I am using Jenkins to build my app (for now only angular app) and then deploy to ftp using these commands:

```
cd backoffice

git config git-ftp.url ftp.website.com
git config git-ftp.user username
git config git-ftp.password password

npm run ng -- build 

git ftp init
```
and when it builds the app and starts deploying, this is what happens:
```
+ git ftp init
fatal: your current branch 'master' does not have any commits yet
There are no files to sync.
Last deployment changed from  to .
Finished: SUCCESS
```

I dont do anything with `master` branch. The entire jenkins build is within `dev`.
Have maybe an issue ? or maybe a misunderstanding.

1. I'm running git-ftp from bitbucket pipelines.
2. I have the repo initialized on a server with our dev branch. 
3. As pipelines runs it's doing a git-ftp push of the latest commit from a feature branch.
4. When I go into the target repo, the files have changed but running a git branch shows that it is still in the dev branch.

Is there a way to make sure the target branch + files ends up the same after the push?

Due to some heavy hitting app linters, we are telling our pipeline to deploy it's working branch to a separate server to run the linter. Just want to make sure the branch in pipelines is totally synced up to the code on the separate server.

Hello, how force the encodage of files to UTF8?

Git-ftp commands change the encodage... Please ?
### Bug / Enhancement / Question ?

Enhancement

### Environment

Please copy the output of the following commands.

```sh
/bin/bash
Linux acer 4.19.78-1-MANJARO #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Oct 7 20:24:34 UTC 2019 x86_64 GNU/Linux
git-ftp version 1.5.2
```
I would like to request that the ftp credentials be stored on `git remote` (instead of `git config`).

Advantage is that it would allow to share your (local machine) code with multiple git users that have ftp servers (on their machines).
Hi i have setup bitbucket pipeline, below is the config of file, in this file all the code becomes zip and deploy to server using sftp, but i want to create zip of only changes and deploy only those changes to server instead on whole code.
thanks!

Hi,
i've a folder with a project, and directories like:
- ajax
- model
- template
etc...

In this folder i've a directory called "newproject" that is routed on 3rd level domain newproject.domain.com

When i'll sync my root local project with the FTP root, what will happen to my "newproject" folder inside it? Can i just ignore it in the root git project because i've another repository specifically for that folder?

Actual folder tree in FTP:
- ajax
- model
- template
- newproject (this is in another repository, so there isn't in local folder, and there isn't in root git project)

Thank you.
Does git-ftp upload multiple files simultaneously?
If yes how could I configure the number of simultaneous uploads?

thanks

When I run the command **`git ftp push`** in windows bash it does not delete the ftp files.

`qui, 18 de jul de 2019 09:10:41: [1 of 1] Buffered for delete '_status.php'.                                                           qui, 18 de jul de 2019 09:10:41: Deleting ...                                                                                          qui, 18 de jul de 2019 09:10:41: WARNING: Some files and/or directories could not be deleted.`

But if I add **-vv**  _`git ftp push -vv`_ the files are deleted

Any idea why this happens on windows?
