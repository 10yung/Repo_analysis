Hi, I had a query, don't know where to ask. Can we use formattable with crosstalk? Is it also possible to use datatables, crosstalk and formattable together?

@renkun-ken 
I've produced great results very quickly with this package, but now I am stuck. Is there a way to globally adjust the row heights in a table? I've tried adding a style rule across all columns, but it seems that I can only adjust the left and right padding. Changing the top and bottom padding has no effect. Is there some other way to control this parameter?
Thanks.
I'm trying to produce a table showing CAPEX on a per-site basis. However, there is an error that keeps appearing when I include a particular site. Code appears in between two numbers.

Here is the code chunk:
formattable(TopNSitesTable, align = "c",
            list(`Rank Diff` = formatter("span", ~ icontext(sapply(`Rank Diff`, function(x) if (x < 0) "arrow-down" else if (x > 0) "arrow-up" else "-"), `Rank Diff`)),
            Business_Type = formatter("span",TopNSitesTable$Business_Type),
            R13PGBV = formatter("span",currency(TopNSitesTable$R13PGBV, digits=0)),
            CPGBV = formatter("span",currency(TopNSitesTable$CPGBV, digits=0)),
            Difference = formatter("span",currency(TopNSitesTable$Difference, digits=0))))

Any thoughts on this?

The addition of `"unicode-bidi" = "plaintext"` in  https://github.com/renkun-ken/formattable/commit/4de31bb313e398059bc682ef0d927df895dff796 to fix placement of symbols has an undesirable side-affect where in some browsers it breaks the direction of text causing RTL alignment to change to LTR.

Above is a screenshot of output on different web browsers with versions with manual hack removing the unicode-bidi attribute from the table.

Source of output also available here at [JSfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/j7ftuape/2/show/)

Minimal reproduceable example is given with 
```r
library(formattable)
library(tibble)
test_tbl = tribble(~colA, ~colB, ~colC, ~colD, ~Test, ~Behaviour,
                   "a",    1000,  1001,  1002, 22.28,   "Good",
                   "b",    2000,  2001,  2002, 15.53,   "Good",
                   "c",    3000,  3001,  3002,  4.48,  "Browser dependent",
                   "d",    4000,  4001,  4002,  8.27,  "Browser dependent")
formattable(test_tbl, list(`Test` = color_bar("#FA614B")))
```
I built a table using 

`is <- formattable(x, align=c('l','l','r'))`
Trying to output it as HTML using format_table, the alignment parameter is lost because the format_table does not check my is object for align data, it is just a parameter of the function.

A workaround is to explicitly reuse the align format from the parameters.
`format_table(is, align=attributes(is)$formattable$format$align)`


Is it possible to format a whole table row based on the value in one of its columns?
Hi,

I asked [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54220716/possible-to-combine-formattable-with-kableextra-row-wise) question on stack, where I was looking to achieve the usage of `color_tile` rowwise, and the answer provided which works great.

```
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(formattable)

set.seed(1)
df <- data.frame(letters = letters[1:5],
                 foo = rnorm(5, 20),
                 bar = c(2, 7, 10, 15, 30),
                 baz = rnorm(5, 20),
                 bash = rnorm(5, 20),
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

for(i in 1:nrow(df)) df[i,] <- color_tile("pink", "lightblue")(df[i,])

df %>%
    kable(escape = F) %>%
    kable_styling("hover", full_width = F) %>%
    column_spec(5, width = "3cm") %>%
    add_header_above(c(" ", "Hello" = 2, "World" = 2))
```

However, what I would like to do now is to expand the use of color_tile towards 3 colours, in a traffic colour gradient (red-yellow-green). Here, the solution isn't very effective if I use "red" and "green" as parameters to `color_tile` as the central colour is brown.

I tried adapting [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49885176/is-it-possible-to-use-more-than-2-colors-in-the-color-tile-function) answer, however the manner I am using `color_tile` is different than the one in the question, as I'm implementing the function row-wise in a loop.. and I get numerous errors.

Was wondering if you guys would know of a work-around - it would be greatly appreciated.


Hello, I have a column of numbers c(5474, 6284, 6585, 3877, etc) and I want to use the color_tile function to color them proportionate between the range of c(3000, 7000) rather than the default which is used c(min(x) = 3877, max(x) = 6585. Is there any way to do this? Thanks
Hi there,

I am using `formatter` function into the `formattable` package and it works great. 
But I'd like to use `proportion_bar` into `formatter` for a same variable but it doesn't work.

Here is my code :

``` 
formattable(eval, list( 
  area(col = c(Trimestre1, Trimestre2, Trimestre3, Trimestre4)) ~ proportion_bar(c("lightblue"), 0.2),
  Moyenne = proportion_bar(c("lightblue"),0.2),
  Moyenne = formatter("span",
                  style = x ~ style(color = ifelse(rank(-x) <= 3, "green", "gray")),
                  x ~ sprintf("%.2f (rang: %3.f)", x, round(rank(-x),1))
                         )
                      )
                  )
```

The result : 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43300924/45589188-a2a1b000-b8ef-11e8-9a04-640c63dfe49a.png)

But I would like to apply the proportion_bar to my last variable `Moyenne` to see the proportion AND to have `sprintf("%.2f (rang: %3.f)"` as the value for my column.

Any ideas ?

Thanks a lot !


When the value for color_bar is small relative to the length the bar, the text seems misplaced. In the image see:
  
Nova Scotia, Increasing   
The "2" is placed to the left of the bar.  
  
Newfoundland and Labrador, Increasing  
The "70" is misaligned with all the other numbers in its column.  
  
Is this the desired behaviour?  
It may well be. I'm new at most of this.  
If this is correct, how can I stop it from happening?
