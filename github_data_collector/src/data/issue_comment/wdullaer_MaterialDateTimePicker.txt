<h3>A Gradle plugin for obfuscated apps</h3>
<p>It's fairly common for teams to have a QA build that is tested before making the release build. Usually that build will be obfuscated (via Proguard or R8), but also add LeakCanary to detect leaks during QA. This leads to obfuscated leak traces, which are hard to understand 🤯. Check out our new <a href="https://github.com/square/leakcanary/blob/master/docs/recipes.md#using-leakcanary-with-obfuscated-apps">Gradle deobfuscation plugin</a> and rejoice!</p>
<h3>UI <strike>twix</strike> tweaks</h3>
<p>In 2.0 we changed the LeakCanary UI and UX, and built a foundation on which 2.1 extends.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/square/leakcanary/blob/master/docs/images/screenshot-2.0.png" alt="ui" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Since 2.0, Leaks are grouped by their distinct signature. In 2.1 there's a <code>New</code> tag that will show until you open up a leak. There's also a <code>Library Leak</code> tag for leaks that are known to be caused by a bug in the Android Framework or Google libraries, and the library leak description now shows up in the UI.</li>
<li>The type of the Java objects (class, instance, array) is now displayed in the LeakTrace, e.g. see <code>FontsContract class</code> and <code>ExampleApplication instance</code> above.</li>
<li>The type of the GC root now shows up at the root of the leak trace. Makes sense!</li>
<li>The leak result notification has an importance now set to MAX so that it'll show up right in your face. If you turn it off, the canary will haunt you in your dreams 🐤👻. To save your sanity and your device battery, automatic heap dumps now won't happen more often than once per minute.</li>
<li>The resource id name for <code>View</code> instances is now displayed in the leak trace. You shouldn't look at the <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1663">implementation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>├─ android.widget.TextView instance
│    View.mID = R.id.helper_text
</code></pre>
<h3>Documentation goodies</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/square/leakcanary/blob/master/docs/fundamentals.md">Fundamentals</a> page was entirely rewritten, split into 3 pages and moved to its own tab. Please read it and provide feedback!</li>
<li>At Square, we have been uploading leaks to Bugsnag for 3 years now, so that no leak ever gets missed. Follow <a href="https://github.com/square/leakcanary/blob/master/docs/recipes.md#uploading-to-bugsnag">this recipe</a>!</li>
<li>Did you know you can <a href="https://github.com/square/leakcanary/blob/master/docs/recipes.md#detecting-leaks-in-jvm-applications">run LeakCanary in a JVM</a>?</li>
</ul>
<h3>API <strike>breaking</strike> bettering changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The APIs of the <code>Leak</code> and <code>LeakTrace</code> classes have significantly changed, e.g. all <code>LeakTrace</code> instances with an identical signature are grouped under the same Leak object. Despite these breaking changes, this release version is a minor update. Oh noes, what about semantic versioning 😱? Ask Don Quixote.</li>
<li>You can now customize the way LeakCanary finds the leaking objects in the heap dump. For example, here's the configuration SharkCli uses to find leaks in heap dumps of apps that don't even have the LeakCanary dependency:</li>
