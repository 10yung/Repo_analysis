Fixed Validation failed: Attachment translation missing: en.activerecord.errors.messages.inclusion and added separate error messages for size and content type.
ActiveRecord#update_all was deprecated in Rails 2.3.8 and has since been replaced by ActiveRecord::Relation#update_all.  With this change the method signature (accepted parameters) and usage have also changed requiring the refactoring.

Hello! It is [**Picabot**, an automatic GitHub image optimizer](https://github.com/somu/picabot).

Your repository cointains some images, and I compressed them for you.
Do not worry: the compression is lossless and uses [ImageOptim](http://imageoptim.com) toolkit.

This bot exists to make the Internet faster. There are people who've got a fast internet connection,
but there are countries where additional 50 KBs take a reasonable time to download (like additional 2-3 minutes).
Additionally, this PR is going to save some precious disk space and decrease your server load. Picabot saves
approximately 25% of space. Still, if you do not need your images optimized, feel free to close this pull request.

If I have enough money, I'll build a server which will send these precious pull requests much faster.
And if I had monthly donations, I would dedicate all my work time to open-source, so donations are very appreciated.

Hello all,

I am trying to install attachment_fu on a rails 3 app using bundler and I am getting the following error:

Could not find gem 'attachment_fu (>= 0) ruby' in git://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu.git (at master).
Source does not contain any versions of 'attachment_fu (>= 0) ruby'

My gem file has the following line in it:

gem 'attachment_fu', :git => "git://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu.git", :branch => 'master'

Can anyone tell me what I need to change to get attachment_fu to install properly?

Replaced returning with tap

Hi, Thanks for the great plugin  (and acts_as_attachment),

I would like to submit a fix I did for a clients rails 1.2.6 application. This restores compatibility whilst still leaving the behaviour the same for Rails 2.\* onwards (Ignore mass assignment restrictions when creating thumbnails).

The breakage occurred in commit 9d754014744b039d82e3e55b3cc7f7c35c16ab08

Would you be ok with adding a fake rails app so tests can run from anywhere ?

Am using attachement_fu, image-magick, r-magick for photo processing.

In my development machine all getting worked correctly.

But in my production machine the thumbnails were not created but the photo object was saved.

When i put the log in the attachemnt_fu plugin(attachment_fu.rb) in after_process_attachment method

the respond_to?(:process_attachment_with_processing) is coming as false

I don't know why. For Further debug i put the log in rmagick_processor.rb in process_attachment_with_processing but its not getting called too.

Please help me out from this problem.

I have changed the production machine last month from that only thumbnails not getting created. Before changing the production machine thumbnails were created correctly.

will i want to reinstall the image-magick and r-magick or give some fix please.

Hi Rick,

I updated the sanitize_filename method to replace Kernel#returning with Object#tap. I was getting way to many deprecation warnings after updating an app from Rails 2.3.8 to 2.3.12. 

Best regards,

Sven 

I followed a simple example to upload a file. When i add to the upload form the field <%= f.file_field :uploaded_data %>, and submit the form (with or without an image), i get an error message in the web page:
500 Internal Server Error

On the server log i get an error message:TypeError (can't convert nil into Integer):

I am on rails 3.0.5 and Ruby 1.9.2 on Windows 7

I used the sample code at:http://clarkware.com/blog/2007/02/24/file-upload-fu
