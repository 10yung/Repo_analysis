Hello, I have a need as follows: 
1. Draw a three-dimensional coordinate system, and can achieve the zoom function. 
2. Other modules constantly send me 3D coordinate points, which I need to draw on the coordinate system. 
3. How should I deal with these massive data. Are they all in VBO?
 Can you give me some ideas or examples? 
Thank you very much.

On page 40 there is some discussion regarding clearing the color in the Init function.

Looking back to page 32, the color is set to 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0.
The discussion on page 40 mentions it being set to 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0.


When the code for glUniform is presented the glUniform2f version uses the character 'O' instead of the numeral '0'.

a preliminary support for Linux/SDL2
The note say“Instructions for building for each platform are provided in Chapter 16, "OpenGL ES Platforms".” But where is the Chapter 16, Ican't find that. And I open the project at AndroidStudio, IDE warning a lot of error. 
So the problem is AndroidStuido can't drectly product apk.
How to do that.
I think reading sample codes is the best way to understand OpenGL ES, but there is some missing key code in the Ch12 sample code. Can you provide the full sample codes in Chapter 12, Section 10? Thx
Cast `void *` pointer to correct type.

Was getting compiler error.:

> error: cannot initialize a variable of type 'UserData *' with an lvalue of type 'void *'
    UserData *userData = esContext->userData;
Page 265 says, "Once a texture has been loaded as a compressed texture, it can be used for texturing in exactly the same way as an uncompressed texture."

In my opinion, this statement about "exactly the same way" is not entirely true. Calling glGenerateMipmap() on a compressed texture returns an error in most drivers. This is not noted on page 265 or on page 242 where "Automatic Mipmap Generation" is covered. It would be helpful if the restriction on compressed texture mipmap generation is noted somewhere.

The ES 3.0 man page says that glGenerateMipmap() is unsupported on compressed base level:

> GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if the levelbase array is stored in a compressed internal format.

Hey guys, I am very new to OpenGL development. I am learning to develop Open GL ES 3 apps following your book. Here is current environment spec:

**Emulator:** Mali_OpenGL_ES_Emulator-v3.0.2.g694a9-Windows-64bit
**IDE**: Visual Studio 2015 Win64
**Cmake version**:  3.11.2
**OS**: Windows 10

I am referring the Chapter 16 for building it on Windows and for Visual Studio
After a lot of beating my head around and digging, I managed to bring down the number of Linker issues that I was getting. Currently I am stuck on 2 linker issues that I unable to resolved or get any help.
