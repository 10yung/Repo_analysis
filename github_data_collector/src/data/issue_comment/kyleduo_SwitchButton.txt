color code blue : #0000FF but it turn into light blue when do setTintColor. how to get full color blue?



How can I add to this switch white outline around the control?
Is there option to set callback after switch animation is complete?

Hi,

Thanks a lot for sharing the library, it is working great.

What I would like to do is to have two different background colors, one for the part of the switch button before the thumb drawable and one for the part after the thumb drawable.

So far, I just managed to change the background color of the whole button depending on wether it is selected or not. But what I want is, for instance, if the thumb drawable is at the middle of the button, the left side of it to be red and the right side to be blue.

Thanks in advance.
