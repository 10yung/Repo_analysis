I want to use Twemproxy to optimize the connections to one single Redis server, I can't fix or optimize the application code.

Is what the correct configuration about the hash and distribution algorithms with a single remote server?

An example of my configuration:

server:
  listen: 0.0.0.0:22223
  redis: true
  preconnect: true
  timeout: 5000
  redis_db: 0
  server_retry_timeout: 3000
  auto_eject_hosts: false
  distribution: ??????
  hash: ??????
  servers:
    - myserver:6379:1

At Skyscanner, we reach the number of connections to ElastiCache memcached cluster and twemproxy solves that problem nicely! :)
Does **twemproxy** works on network **layer 4** ? For example **haproxy** which can work on layer 4 and layer 7 as well ?
Hey

This is not an issue but a question about the 'distribution' parameter.

I know that the 'hash' parameter is used to configure a hash function for sharding. But what the 'distribution' parameter for?

Can you please explain it to me? I have tried to find any documentation or something like that about the twemproxy but found nothing.
