We have ported Cilium master version on Arm server and deployed Nginx to verify and test k8s cluster that composed by three Arm nodes, the status of the pods and the connection between the nodes are normal.
I hope to contribute to cilium support for Arm64, and Related work includes the following aspects:
1.	Fix compiling and running issue on Arm64;
2.	Add arm64 support for building cilium-related images;
3.	Add multi-arch support for cilium-related images;
4.	Add arm64 support for cilium CI/CD.


Currently missing secrets cause empty TLS contexts to be sent to
Envoy, which will then NACK the policy. Error out earlier in the
Cilium endpoint regeneration logic so that Envoy is not bothered with
errorneous configuration.

Currently this will still lead to endpoint being not-ready, but at
least the endpoint log contains the failure message pinpointing the
problem (e.g., "Error regenerating endpoint: unable to regenerate
policy for '310': secrets \"swapi-server\" not found").

Cilium datapath does not support IP fragmentation, and fragmented packets are usually dropped.

To make users aware of such cases, we need to export a metric for dropped packets. This requires adding `return DROP_FRAG_NOSUPPORT;` to the datapath and adding an adequate reason to the `cilium_drop_{count,bytes}_total` metrics.
Deep copy the resource before storing it. This way we are
not dependent on caller not using the resource after this
call. This may help avoid panics seen in the unit tests.

Fixes: #9779 (hopefully)

Recently introduced tests using external sites cause intermittent CI failures. Enable Envoy HTTP retries for those tests.

Note that the current Envoy retries do not work properly on upstream connections which re-use the original source address and port, so this change alone would not fix these intermittent CI failures, but will not make them any worse either. Envoy side fix of retries on these cases is prepared separately.

Generic protobuf structpb config encoding is deprecated by
Envoy. Change to using TypedConfig to avoid flooding the logs with
deprecation warnings.

When cilium agent in eni mode restarts, ciliumnode custom resource
is cleared and refilled by several updates. Specifically,
Status.IPAM.Used map which holds all used IPs is first updated
to an empty map before endpoints finish restoration.

This becomes critical if `--aws-release-excess-ips` is enabled
since cilium operator treats empty IPAM.Used map as no address used
hence releases addresses arbitraryly, causing restored endpoints
disconnected.

This patch fixes this by combining per endpoint update requests
into one update request after all endpoint restoration finishes so
that Status.IPAM.Used keeps the desired state during agent restart.
