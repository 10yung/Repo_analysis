I want to stop animation after setProgress method call in some position.

Is it possible to make? And how I can achieve this.
Thanks.
Hi,
First of all thank you for the repository, we have used it in our application and its working good.
We are struggling to set maximum value to it dynamically(Default one is 1.0f). And also we have used labelled circular so there its just UI issue the label is some what bigger in size so its overlapping with circle.
Thanks. Appreciate feedback on this. 
let DACircularProgressView become the CABasicAnimation delegate,· must conform the protocol CAAnimationDelegate.· If not , there was a warning in project.
fixed Assigning to 'id<CAAnimationDelegate> _Nullable' from incompatible type 'DACircularProgressView *const __strong' by adding CAAnimationDelegate

Current animation implementation will stop if the view is removed from the super view. When the parent view is then re-added, the animation will not be playing.

How should this be implemented? I will be glad to send a pull request.

I'm sorry to tell you, but your library doesn't build in iOS 10 anymore.

Here is the Fix:

**DACircularProgressView.h** _line 11_

replace:

```
@interface DACircularProgressView : UIView
```

with:

```
#if __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED < __IPHONE_10_0
@interface DACircularProgressView : UIView
#else
@interface DACircularProgressView : UIView <CAAnimationDelegate>
#endif
```

Here is my code. Is it because of the decimal value?

```
   progressBlock: { (progress: Int32) -> Void in
                if progress <= 99 {

                    self.progressView.setProgress(CGFloat(progress)/100, animated: true)

                    print("CG value: \(CGFloat(progress)/100)")

                    print(self.progressView.progress)

                } else {

                    self.progressView.removeFromSuperview()
                }


        }
```
