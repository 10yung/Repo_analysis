I am a newbie in linux. I had this issue before with Rstudio and now is solved. Opencpu howver still gives the same error message.

I get this error when I try to call a function from a package I made with name 'xxxxxx' in the error code below 

`package` or namespace load failed for 'xxxxxx':
 .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rJava', details:
  call: dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...)
  error: unable to load shared object '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/rJava/libs/rJava.so'`

Is there any configuration option to prevent the use of AppArmor at all even if it is available?

Reason I'm asking:

I’m trying to run openCPU using the openCPU/debian-10 docker image and a Docker in Docker approach. Startup works fine but every request fails with status code 400:

`System failure for: aa_change_profile() (No such file or directory)
`

I think this might be related to https://github.com/jeroen/RAppArmor/issues/21 but I'm not able to run the Container in privileged mode in the Docker in Docker use case, which unluckily I require for running Test-Pipelines on GitLab.

 If I understand correctly from the Docu, AppArmor should not be used by openCPU on Debian by default? I guess since the parent container image is Ubuntu and they share the Linux Kernel it still tries to use AppArmor, which then can not mount securityfs. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25533666/cannot-reload-or-start-apparmor-in-docker)

PS.: The openCPU Server Container works fine if I run the container without Docker in Docker on a maschine without AppArmor available.

Hi, if it's not already possible to use GitLab webhooks, will you include that feature in future versions?

Although I have a GitHub account, I mostly use GitLab now.

Thank you.

I am trying to save plotly as svg locally using the code.

```
if (!require("processx")) install.packages("processx")

p <- plot_ly(z = ~volcano) %>% add_surface()

orca(p, "surface-plot.png")
```

This requires the installation of [orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca). I installed it on my Windows and the above code runs fine locally. However, the orca cannot be detected if I use `ocpu.call()` in javascript to the function containing the above script. It returns error of 

```
The orca command-line utility is required for this functionality.

Please follow the installation instructions here -- https://github.com/plotly/orca#installation
```
I am running a web-app with Angular front-end and Node.js backend. I cannot import ocpu object in the opencpu.js script like shown in the documentation and appdemo example because the script that makes the ocpu requests is completely separated from the client (thus it doesn't have a window object). Is there an alternative to `ocpu.call` in Javascript that still allows me to manage opencpu sessions? I tried using the request function in Javascript, but the sessionid is treated purely as a string when passed as an argument in JSON format.

I should also mention that I tried adding the sessionid as a parameter directly to the request URL, but opencpu doesn't seem to recognize it. For example, this request URL would give this error:

`localhost:5307/ocpu/library/DNFAPI/R/testSession?input=4`

```
argument "input" is missing, with no default

In call:
testSession()
```
I just successfully pushed my R Package on the cloud server and got the `CI Done. Build successful` message on Github's webhook setting page. I then try to make the following HTTP calls on Postman:

`https://cloud.opencpu.org/ocpu/apps/bhklab/DNF2/getBigNetwork/json`
`https://cloud.opencpu.org/ocpu/apps/bhklab/DNF2/getBigNetwork`

Both of them basically results in a similar response:

```
path[1]="/usr/local/lib/opencpu/apps/ocpu_github_bhklab_DNF2/DNF2/getBigNetwork/json": No such file or directory

In call:
normalizePath(path, mustWork = TRUE)
```

I can make this call successfully when I am testing the R package locally with the following HTTP call:

`localhost:5307/ocpu/library/DNF2/R/getBigNetwork/json`

I am trying to get remotely communicate with the server. What is it that I am doing wrong?
Im facing this error while running curl with REST API in the command line. Below curl command im running in the command line.

[curl https://user-name.ocpu.io/package-name/R/quad/json -H "Content-Type:application/json" –d '"access_token":"00D2E000001GkbnUAC!ARIAQDhDaVOr0Ev84_zRl9iX_MnL4hp2ZVyoJVBEFvR2hZZFKHlHuK20hiw.yrpi7MjHRcsRAJCRvFl8b1ToGEcR2eK4GGgy", "instance_url":'https://google.com', "object":"ABC", "field1":"field1_name", "field2":"field2_name", "newname":"new_field_name"'] . If someone helps it will greatly appreciated.

Im getting following error:
1. curl : Failed convert -d to ACE
2. URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL
It confused me because other my own functions which generate graphs by ggplot is exactly right through ocpu.rplot call, using opencpu-0.4.js. BUT only the following get wrong results:
https://bio.odb.ntu.edu.tw/ocpu/tmp/x09e2b5cd3c2876/graphics/last/png

No labels and other annotations. But if readRDS(/tmp/ocpu-store/x09e2b5cd3c2876/.REval), the result is right (with labels and annotations):
https://github.com/cywhale/ODB/blob/master/opencpu_test/readRDS_x09e2b5cd3c2876_REval.png

I have no idea why, need some hints or tips to debug with it. Thanks.

I put all session files in my github https://github.com/cywhale/ODB/tree/master/opencpu_test

So I've been attempting to actually allow OpenShift containers through your OpenCPU, and I've been running into some issues. I cannot seem to actually run a container without failure / crashing.

The issue is that I'm given an error stating that :

Starting periodic command scheduler cron
--
  | cron: can't open or create /var/run/crond.pid: Permission denied
  | ...fail!
  | AH00526: Syntax error on line 33 of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf:
  | SSLCertificateKeyFile: file '/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key' does not exist or is empty
  | Action '-DFOREGROUND' failed.
  | The Apache error log may have more information.
Even with something as simply as just a From OpenCpu/Base seems to net this error. While this is probably an issue on my end because I'm not particularly familiar with OpenShift, do you have any suggestions on how to circumvent this problem?
I am trying to install an R packages "pcorr" in my opencpu website. But it returns an error of 
`unable to install packages`. 
The warning message says `'lib = "/usr/lib/R/library"' is not writable`. 

So I tried to change my `lib` when using `install.packages()`. But none of them works. 

Here are the libs that I tried

`/usr/local/lib/R/site-library
/usr/local/lib/opencpu/site-library
/usr/lib/R/site-library
/usr/lib/R/library
/usr/lib/opencpu/library
`

Here is the  [console](http://metda.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/ocpu/tmp/x0f1cb3a854/console/text).

Please help. Thank you!
