If bmc and admin networks are on different subnets and different
physcial interfaces, do not enforce bmc VLAN validation.

network-json-validator: remove bmc VLAN validation
install-chef-suse: add bmc VLAN validation if bmc_vlan and admin use the
same interface


Basic extension
23794e55b started referring to DNS_JSON without ever defining it, so apparently this ability to override DNS settings during install via `/{etc,root}/crowbar/dns.json` has been broken for 3 years and 3 days ...

Another example of why #shellsucks - undefined variables are silently used without any error or even warning.

Heredocs makes it a bit nicer to read and write inline text.

This is a half-serious **untested** pull-request submitted mainly to test whether CodeClimate works on PRs within a single repo (in contrast we know for sure that there are existing issues with cross-fork PRs, but CodeClimate said they should have these fixed very soon).

Hi,

building sledgehammer fails with 
"Error creating Live CD : unable to download from repo : Cannot retrieve repository metadata (repomd.xml) for repo : a-epel. Please verify its path and try again.  
I think due to wrong baseurls in all crowbar/centos-xxx-extra/sledgehammer.ks
In the file http://mirrors.xmission.com/fedora/epel/6/$basearch
correct would be http://mirrors.xmission.com/fedora-epel/6/$basearch 

After changing it in crowbar/centos-6.2-extra i didn't run into this error again. And the sledghammer build was fine.
Additionally i am willing to write an update to the HowTo build an crowbar1.x iso.

**Description:**
Applying proposal using CLI failed with error "Failed to talk to service proposal commit: 405: Failed to apply proposal to: d90-b1-1c-58-27-dc.crowbar.org"

**Version/Build:** mesa-1.6_openstack-os-build.3508.dev

**Browsers Used:** IE11.0

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Using the CLI run the command to commit the Glance proposal with non-default node selected
2. The proposal fails with the error message stating, "Failed to talk to service proposal commit: 405: Failed to apply proposal to: d90-b1-1c-58-27-dc.crowbar.org", where d90-b1-1c-58-27-dc.crowbar.org is one of the non-default nodes for the proposal.

**Observed Results:**
Applying Glance proposal using CLI with non-default node fails most of the times. However the error message needs to be more specific. Also is there a log which could be referred to understand the details of the failure.

**Expected Results:**
Applying the Glance proposal using CLI with non-default node should be allowed and successful.
Also is there a log which could be referred to understand the details of the failure.

**Impact:**
User might get confused with why the proposal failed. Is there a log which could be referred to understand the details of the failure.

**Description:**
Applying Glance proposal using CLI with non-default node keeps running for ever in GUI as In Progress, but fails with timeout on the CLI prompt

**Version/Build:** mesa-1.6_openstack-os-build.3508.dev

**Browsers Used:** IE11.0

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Using the CLI run the command to commit the Glance proposal with non-default node selected
2. The proposal is shown as "In Progress" in the GUI
3. On the CLI prompt the proposal fails with a timeout error stating "Execution expired (Timeout::Error)"
4. The proposal in the GUI however still shows as "In Progress"

**Observed Results:**
Applying Glance proposal using CLI with non-default node keeps running for ever in GUI as In Progress, but fails with timeout on the CLI prompt

**Expected Results:**
Both the CLI and GUI should be showing the same status for a given proposal

**Impact:**
User might get confused with different states of the same proposal being shown in the CLI and GUI

**Description:**
Addition of a new group for nodes does not work

**Version/Build:** mesa-1.6_openstack-os-build.3508.dev

**Browsers Used:** IE11.0

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Install crowbar.
2. After crowbar installation, start adding nodes to the crowbar server network.
3. The nodes would PXE boot and show up into the node dashboard for deployment.
4. If we try to give a name and create a new Group, the Group shows up momentarily and vanishes.
5. The group does not show up after this anytime.
6. As a result the new group created is not of any use, since the group is never seen after the initial 1 second for which it is shown.

**Observed Results:**
Addition of a new group for nodes does not work

**Expected Results:**
Creation of the group should function properly and the new group created should be listed on the Node Dashboard

**Impact:**
UUser cannot group the nodes under specific groups, however have seen that the nodes can be grouped using the Bulk edit option
