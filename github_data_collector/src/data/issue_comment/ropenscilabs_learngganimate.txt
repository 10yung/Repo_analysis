* Fix spelling of "Season" in RuPaul example!
not a breaking change but would be good to include a reference/description to this.

Code using these functions will need to be updated and the Rmd  source files re knitted.

I think with growth the github page for this has grown out of control, I have to scroll way too much to find the useful links and it's all a little disorienting. I'd be happy to a small reorganization of files/readme to improve user experience, but I'd like to get @adam-gruer approval first
installing gganimate gave me a lot of trouble (windows user) in the beginning... might be good to write a guide
https://github.com/ropenscilabs/learngganimate/blob/20ac7b3039885321f35bb781e447f71d0944870e/coolcoolcool.Rmd#L41
The code now fails if the most recent commits of gganimate are installed from github.
The API has changed and `enter_grow` no longer has an argument `fade = TRUE` .
Many of our example will likely fail if users have a newwer installation of gganimate than we were using at ozunconf. Thrills and spills of using an in development package. I will update the line above.  And try to work though the other examples - doing a search for enter and exit should be easy enough. might be a good time to create a branch to update throughout the document.  May need a reference to the gganimate commit that the examples work with on the front page
As per twitter...
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">animate() now has a start_pause and end_pause argument to allow you to repeat the first and last frame a number of times, as well as a rewind argument to allow the animation to rewind</p>&mdash; Thomas Lin Pedersen (@thomasp85) <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasp85/status/1070244318802313217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2018</a></blockquote>


To my knowledge this is what people often don't get and I haven't had time to write something profound about it yet. There is an article on the wiki about it for inspiration...
Woah - I just cloned this project to work PC  .  Our internet is pretty crappy - but this took a long time to download because of all the files and gifs I guess.  I don't know if this is something that would harm the project (maybe a barrier for contributors) or if there are solutions.
 Maybe 

-  turning off caching but that will have it's own drawbacks, 
-  or a clean up of intermediate files (if they are being kept).  

Anyway maybe something to think about or get some helpful ideas from the community
Just so we don't forget . @sarahromanes idea to include an infographic describing some of the package functions I thought was a good one.  One for the artistically/graphical design talented peeps!
