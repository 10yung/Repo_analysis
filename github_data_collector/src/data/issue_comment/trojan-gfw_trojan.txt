i want to add thread pool feature, add code as follow in main.cpp file. is it ok?

const unsigned intDEFAULT_THREAD_POOL_SIZE = 2;

unsigned intthread_pool_size =      std::thread::hardware_concurrency() * 2;           
if (thread_pool_size == 0)       thread_pool_size=DEFAULT_THREAD_POOL_SIZE;

for ( int i = 0; i < thread_pool_size;++i)     
     boost::thread( run_service);   

void run_service() {   service.run(); }
各位大神，本人小白。用的是mac os catalina，VPS是GCP。一键安装了trojan安装了bbrplus。下载了macos 1.14的客户端，也修改了客户端的config文件（VPS端啥也没改），改了一个自己的域名，一个SSL的验证为false。

我有两个问题请教下
1. config.json文件里的password是啥？我要去哪里找呢？我用xftp看VPS上的config文件密码默认是password1和password2。我下载的windows客户端（一键安装后的链接），里面有一个密码，我把这个密码复制进macos的config还是不行。但是运行起来也没有报错，就是连不上外网（百度可以）。

2.这玩意儿是不是非得用chrome然后搭配插件呢？自带的Safari不行吗？

感谢指点小白

如果我想在我的mk7621 路由器编译客户端，具体可行吗？

My server is now installed with 1.13. How to upgrade to 1.14
Are there plans to develop macOS windows or other GUI clients?
I'm a Go developer(and android)，I can participate if possible.
It would be nice to be able to limit users speeds.
Example.: User Admin could download with 30Mb/s, while User client1 5Mb/s.

Project looks excelent, looking forward for this feature!

Thank you and keep up the good work!

交叉编译的，在R6300V2上运行不了。
from boost::asio documentation, seems async_read_some function may not read complete message, however seems we never handle this in case we only read partially? Thanks.

The read operation may not read all of the requested number of bytes. Consider using the async_read function if you need to ensure that the requested amount of data is read before the asynchronous operation completes.
