is This Project support android above target version 17?
How can I extarct subtitles using this project?
Dear contributors,

Thank you for your great work in sharing this. I want to know why you have set libavfilter flag off in ffmpeg config. Does it make a problem with Android?
I update submodule,

正克隆到 'library-jni/jni/libyuv'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/libyuv/': Failed to connect to chromium.googlesource.com port 443: 连接超时
fatal: 无法克隆 'https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/libyuv' 到子模组路径 'library-jni/jni/libyuv'

i use local libyuv source copy to dir'jni',but:

fatal: 目标路径 'library-jni/jni/libyuv' 已经存在，并且不是一个空目录。

T_T

help me pls!
the example app is crashing after playing 5-6 videos continuously. Has anyone faced this issue?? 
Hi, I am developing an Android app that streams between two devices. I need a MediaPlayer client that can play h264 over rtsp. I am trying vlc, but so far no luck due to some bugs. So is this a client that can be used in any other android project with support for rtsp?

Thanks.

Could someone tell me what's wrong here?

I focused on compile AndroidFFmeg almost one week, always something wrong.
Could somebody send me the compiled library(all the so libraries)?
My email address is vincentchow0213@gmail.com, thank you!!!
