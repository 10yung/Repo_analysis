Since Android support libraries were deprecated and androidx is out, Shuttle should also take the step.

_Needs thorough review (Optimizing imports should help in maintainability in future)_


**Shuttle version:** 2.0.12b6 (Upgraded)
 **Device, OS:** Pixel 3a, 10 (Q1PA.190711.020.C3
 
**Description of bug:**
Some artist names are padded with extra spaces, examples below.  Can't see any reason or pattern to it.  Tags look fine.

**Steps to reproduce:**
Example mp3 available [HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NIy2JSY70PStoPdGgWaY_L7JEcGZdnyW)

**Expected outcome:**
Artists names appear as per the tag consistently. 
 
**Observations/Actual Result:**
I think this is actually an Android Media Store/Scanner issue as the same happens in similar apps e.g. Vinyl.  Trimming the name sounds simple...

**Steps to reproduce:**
Not sure. Most files are fine, just a few odd ones.
Example mp3 available [HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11kPwG_A21icyKIUEKh8sAJAUBu_PyyK2)

**Expected outcome:**
Embedded artwork shown, especially when no art is downloaded.
 
**Observations/Actual Result:**
Screenshot attached above.  Shuttle issue as a similar music app, Vinyl, shows it fine.

**Shuttle version:**
 
 v2.0.11
 
**Device, OS:**
 
Pixel 3a, 10 / Q

**Description of bug:**
 
Playlists exist, and can be added to, or overridden, but aren't accessible by the main menu. Tapping on Playlists off of the hamburger menu does nothing.
 
**Steps to reproduce:**
 
 1. Open Shuttle
 2. Tap the hamburger menu in the upper left
 3. Tap Playlists
 
**Expected outcome:**
 
Playlists on phone open
 
**Observations/Actual Result:**
 
 Nothing happens. Hamburger menu stays open.
FYI the task switcher uses a small sqaure icon rather than full circle

I try to tap on a song and it tells me the playlist is empty

 
**Steps to reproduce:**
 
1. I open the app and this happens. I don't know how to reproduce it
 
**Expected outcome:**
 
Song should play.
 
**Observations/Actual Result:**
 
 The app works fine after closing it and restarting it.
**Shuttle version:**

v2.0.11
 
**Device, OS:**
 
Oneplus 6, Oxygen OS 9.0.8

**Description of bug:**
 
Tracks don't loop when set to 'repeat current song' while casting 
 
**Steps to reproduce:**
 
 1. Set song to loop
 2. Cast to Google Home
 
**Expected outcome:**
 
Song loops until stopped
 
**Observations/Actual Result:**
 
The order in which the steps above are done don't seem to matter, same outcome regardless. When the track ends, it will go back to the start and will not resume until you stop casting or you select another track.
**Shuttle version:**
 
 v2.0.11
 
**Device, OS:**
 
Oneplus 6, Oxygen OS 9.0.8

**Description of bug:**
 
Removing a duplicate track from a playlist will remove all instances of that track in that playlist
 
**Steps to reproduce:**
 
 1. Add a duplicate track to a playlist
 2. Navigate to the playlist and remove it
 
**Expected outcome:**
 
Only the selected track should be removed
 
**Observations/Actual Result:**
 
Any other duplicates, including the original, will be removed.
**Shuttle version:**
 
 v2.0.12
 
**Device, OS:**
 Sony Xperia XA2
Android 9, LineageOS

**Description of bug:**
 The sorting options within the playlist view seem to be broken as they don't do anything.  As they're the same sorting options from the artist view it may be a good time to look at which ones are needed for playlist purposes.
 
**Steps to reproduce:**
 
 1. Step 1
     Go to a playlist
 2. Step 2
     Try to sort that playlist via the button in the header
 
**Expected outcome:**
 
The playlist gets sorted by one of the various options
 
**Observations/Actual Result:**
 
 Nothing in the playlist moves
It is not clear from the documentation if playing music from OTG USB is supported. Can this be explicitly stated in the documentation?
