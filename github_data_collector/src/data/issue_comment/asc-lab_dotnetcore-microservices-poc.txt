I started work on new docker-compose settings for non-linux users.
Branch: https://github.com/asc-lab/dotnetcore-microservices-poc/tree/without-network-mode-host

Next steps:
- use env variables in RawRabbitInstaller, appsettings.json, ocelot.json
- use prepared env variables in docker-compose (all.yml)


Create a new microservice responsible for gathering agent sales stats. Stats will be updated based on events send from policy service. Each time a policy is sold / terminated we update agent sold policies data in elasticsearch. 
We use elasticsearch aggregation framework to build complex queries like: sales per product in time, or sales distribution, top agents list etc.
Consider using something like TestContainer to make running integration test possible in CI/CD pipeline
