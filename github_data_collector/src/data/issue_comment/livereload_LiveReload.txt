Getting the following error and I'm not trying to use compass:
```
Nothing to compile. If you're trying to start a new project, you have left off the directory argument.
Run "compass -h" to get help.

LiveReload knowledge base has an article about this error.
```
There is a hyperlink to [this](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86266-compass-nothing-to-compile-) site but it is broken.

Contacting you via http://feedback.livereload.com/ is recommended but this site is also 404.

I've been to [this](https://github.com/livereload/livereload-site/blob/master/livereload.com/_articles/troubleshooting/compass-nothing-to-compile.md) page but the only advice given is to contact you but I don't know how else to do that as all links are broken. 

Thanks,

Tom

I apologize in advance if this is documented. However, I've searched around quite a bit and was unable to find anything showing or stating how exactly to change the compiled files output directory. I have no problem changing underlying code if I must, but unfortunately, I have not had the time to dig deeply into the source. 
I download this LiveReload-develop.zip,open chrome://extensions/  on my brower.   I can't find the .crx file. how to solve this problem??
I've hunted around for a solution but haven't found one. I am working on a WordPress child theme. The parent theme is Storefront from woocommerce. Got everything set up and started developing and realized all of the file changes that require a page re-load were working fine, but CSS injection just wasn't working. It was making changes in the DOM though, so I found the file it was changing and it was the style.css from the parent theme. Because this file is loaded before the child theme's style.css, the changes weren't being displayed until I reloaded the browser manually.

The only distinguishing factor I could think of that could help livereload know which one to inject is the directory the stylesheet is in. Or maybe there is a way to tell livereload which file to inject and I just can't find that option?

Any help would be appreciated.

The new Go-based subsystem is a lot more convenient and reliable than the Node one. Want to port the http / web socket networking layer to Go and get rid of the Node-based part of LiveReload.

Been a long while since I've done it last, so gotta re-learn the process.

Update everything to look good on Retina screens.

Icons:
- [ ] status item states
- [ ] buy
- [ ] settings
- [ ] console

Controls and decorations:
- [ ] project pane
- [ ] artwork for the welcome state
- [ ] ‘drop here’ marker
- [ ] the artwork for the console window (should drop the background entirely, it's stupid)

We may want to update the old manifests, so that the old build system would still be available as a contingency. 

This can and should be automated using the Package Manager Kit and the new actions system. Preferably, we'd derive the old manifests at run time, rather than updating the actual files.
