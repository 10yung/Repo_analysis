I'm getting this error every time I skip a song. What's also weird is that while logging the playbackState every time it changes, I'm noticing that pressing skip will cause the playbackState to change from LOADING, WAITING, PLAYING, PAUSED, then the error occurs, then LOADING, WAITING, PLAYING again. The song plays correctly, but it's causing tons of these same errors and also making the play/pause button flicker from different playback states while skipping songs.

Please add function for Airplay, like Spotify has. You can select your devices that are connected with airplay. 
I want to make 1 version Apple Music for other platforms(Eg: Windows Phone, Android TV) but I dont help Apple Developer Account. Can I ask you use your key for my app. Thanks
Added a dockerfile to support building and running this app with Docker.

Instructions to use it were added to the readme file
Music that is not available throught apple music is displaying in the user list (Which is good), but it wont play. 

In the console, the error is "UNKNOWN ERROR".

The exact album I have tried is King Crimson's In The Court Of The Crimson King.
Add the native Apple Music feature to Love [heart] or Dislike [cross-heart] a track as it is playing.
I am using fedora gnome 29 with midori and firefox browsers, and anytime i press on a song, it won't play or load to the bottom bar.
Hi,

I can't play any music on the plug in.
I actually use Brave Browser on Linux Mint Cinammon
If anyone got an idea... :-)

Thanks

I see someone's already tried this on their own in #54 but if there's any way to get a desktop version packaged for Linux systems in something like a snap, appimage or whatever necessary to get it running in a desktop app that would be great.

iTunes and Apple Music are pretty difficult to get going on systems like Ubuntu these days so this would be an insanely great workaround for that.
