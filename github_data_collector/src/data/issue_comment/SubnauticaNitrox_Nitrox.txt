Likely more Dictionaries are Included in everything we are serializing. We should work towards switching all of them over to lists for serialization
I know u can "Fix" this bug by copying the mono file into the Subnautica_Data file, but then the no menu bug appears for me , and i know that u can fix that bug by downgrading the version of subnautica.. but when i do that the first fix of the System.Io.Directory wont work and it wont find the file
Assumption: chatlog isn't loaded yet for receiving player

**Error log (I'm running 2 instances of Subnautica at once so it looks a bit weird)**

Thereâ€™s a stub for this already in Nitrox but it has no implementation. Ideally it should show how many packets of X have been sent/received.

**Getting started**
- `PacketReceiver` class for detecting what kind of packets are received.
- `MultiplayerSessionManager` class for detecting what kind of packets are send.
- `NetworkDebugger` class should be where a new gui is rendered displaying the types of packets sent/received.

**Nice-to-have**
- Being able to view what a packet contained.
**Getting started**
Start in DisconnectPlayer method on the KickCommand class and log information about what happens when this packet is received by the player. Most important is that the player at least knows it was kicked.

You can log with the `Log` class. The resulting logs will be in the "Nitrox Logs" directory: `[...]\steamapps\common\Subnautica\Nitrox Logs`
Changes the Player Id from a ushort to a NitroxId, and removes the PlayerGameObjectId.
i have been playing subnautica with nitrox with my friend for a while now. However, today i changed locations and thus networks, and when trying to play today, when i try to join my server, it says launching game in the upper left hand corner, but nothing happens. If i try again, it says that my name is already in use. My friend is able to connect normally without issue. Is there a way to fix this? I host the server on my machine and we use hamachi.
I dont know if there is any other issue like this, but when I try to start the multiplayer version of the game of Epic Game the game opens, but there is no Menu, I can do nothing.

Can someone give this issue any attention?
I've tried every other fix from other issues here, i've asked in discord and searched everywhere on google. The log does not show any serious errors from i can see. [Here is the log output](https://pastr.io/raw/RzJYLy)
As described. Here is a snip of the output_log.txt from Subnautica_Data during an infinite load.
