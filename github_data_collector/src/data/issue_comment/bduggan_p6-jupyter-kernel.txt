Recently the community has undergone name change from Perl 6 --> Raku.

Here are the recommendations for file extensions https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/blob/master/solutions/language/Path-to-Raku.md#extensions

Since rakudo release 2019.11, `raku` interpreter is available to execute raku scripts.

Example: `raku script.raku`
So to reflect this I have edited the files with new extensions, updated readme. I installed and tested in local linux machine with `rakudo 2019.11` and it indeed works.
May be name change of the repo would make it uniform with the raku changes.

Thanks.
Thanks for your excellent work!

However, what if someone cannot install this kernel by zef?

Is there a way to manually install?
Hi there,

[This link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sumandoc/Perl-6-notebook/master?urlpath=lab) takes me to jupyterlab environment where I can find Python and Perl 6 notebooks.

While Python notebook works without any issues, Perl 6 notebook does not execute codes in the notebook and console both.

Though the cell execution time is instantaneous in Python cells, it is still slow(though improved significantly) in Perl 6 cells.

What am I missing?
