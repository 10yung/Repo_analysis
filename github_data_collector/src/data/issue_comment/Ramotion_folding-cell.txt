Hey I noticed some old guide and error messages left inside the code when I was trying some demo codes. So, I prepared this PR. Let me know if that's ok.
Whenever we push a vc and come back to the main tableview containing the folding cells, the animation process is very slow and clunky. 

Running on iOS13, the problem doesn't occur on iOS12. Not using Hero pod (some previous bug experienced it with that pod). 

Any thoughts? 
This adds support for SwiftPM manifest based dependency managers. Specifically this adds support for installing via [Accio](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio) but will probably also work with SwiftPM once it's integrated into Xcode.
I found that it's somehow impossible to use FoldingCells together with view controller transitions pods such as Hero or Motion which is very sad!
Somehow the Folding cell animation works only until the first segue.
Any idea why?

Is there any way of accomplishing a rounded `RotatingView` with a drop shadow? The traditional method of using two views, one with the shadow layer and one with the `cornerRadius` set will not work. There seems to be a white UIView that gets created and requires masking out with this method but doing so will cut off the shadow
Hey there! Love the work! Noticed some unusual memory behavior.

The memory usage increases by a lot every time I tap to open a cell (which will then load images with SDWebImage, as well as other data from the server), but it never comes down. Now, I understand dealing with images is expensive, but is there a way to work around this issue? Please let me know what you think.
