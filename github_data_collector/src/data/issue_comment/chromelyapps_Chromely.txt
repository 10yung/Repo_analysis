Is it possible to create dark theme using chromely? Similar to VS Code, when title bar/close/maximize button are black and it's possible to resize and drag main window.
Currently I'm trying to develop a new application on .net core.
I wish to create a local application without exposing the UI html at all. Usually I will hide them by adding the resources as the embedded resources. 
However, latest Chromely does not allow me to do that anymore.
I tried to do that via Controller, but Chromely encoded it anyway.
If you could implement an Assembly type in UrlScheme or give the ChromelyResponse an option not to encode the response body it would be nice, please.

Thank you.
Chromely is adding:
- .NET Core 3 Support
- MacOS Support

For more info please see [Migration to .NET Core 3 and MacOS Support](https://github.com/chromelyapps/Chromely/wiki/Migration-to-.NET-Core-3-and-MacOS-Support).

Comments, issues and feedbacks will be tracked here.

Would be nice, as a feedback and an an encouragement to new users to know about apps built with Chromely or tools or project using Chromely.
