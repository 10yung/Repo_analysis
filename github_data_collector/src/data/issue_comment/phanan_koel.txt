**Describe the bug**
Hi guys! I have full access to a cPanel/WHM environment and I was trying to set up a Koel installation on my domain. I was able to finish the install successfully, but the website simply does not open. I'm not using "php artisan serve", because I want to run it directly on the root folder of my domain.

**To reproduce**
Unfortunately, there's nothing to reproduce.
I just used Git and cloned Koel repository to my public_html folder. Then I shot a "composer install", blah blah blah, everything ran fine. The only thing that I was not able to do was to open the website.

**Expected behavior**
Simply open the Koel GUI when I enter tastreaming.ml

**Screenshots**
There are no screenshots, just a 500/404 error.

**Environment**
 - Koel version v4.2.2
 - OS: CENTOS v7.7 KVM
 - Browser: Firefox Developer 73
 - PHP v7.2
 - Node v10.18.1
 - cPanel/WHM v84.0.19

**Describe the bug**
When visualizer is enabled, changing, restarting or simply moving forward or backward in the song results in a significant volume increase, which cannot be traced to an actual change in volume anywhere in Koel (the volume slider and equalizer doesn't change) or the system.

This only happens when visualizer is enabled and only works once (i.e the volume doesn't keep increasing)

**To reproduce**
1. Start a song
2. Enable visualizer
3. Move forward or backward in the song using Koel's progress bar
4. Volume increases noticeably

**Expected behavior**
No change in volume.

**Environment**
 - Koel version 4.2.2
 - OS: Debian Sid
 - Browser: Chrome 79
 - PHP version 7.3.12
 - Node version 12.14.0
In a sub directory installation `https://mydomain/koel/` the asset-path ist absolute, so the resources cannot be loaded.

After removing the first slash in the webpack-config of the public-path and recompilation the assets are loading great now.

**Describe the bug**

cant stream lossless

**To reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. have lossless library
2. try to stream anything
3. nothing loads or plays

**Expected behavior**

music plays without loading for ridiculous amounts of time.

**Screenshots**

no

**Environment**

recent

**Additional context**

i can download the files through the browser and load them into quicktime player before the streaming service does anything (if it even does anything)... so that's pretty poor

EDIT: it pretty much always hangs indefinitely and nothing ever happens
**Describe the bug**
Cannot login without manually setting APP_KEY in .env file.

**To reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Follow the documentation:
* cd <PUBLIC_WEB_DIRECTORY_FOR_KOEL>
* git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/phanan/koel.git .
* git checkout v4.0.0 # Check out the latest version at https://github.com/phanan/koel/releases
* composer install
* php artisan koel:init # Populate credentials during the process
* php artisan serve

**Expected behavior**
Able to login using credentials provided during koel:init step.

**Environment**

 - OS: Ubuntu 16.04

Hi,
having this sync script with inotify, running as systemd service
```
#!/bin/bash

# this script does not work for network shares like CIFS mounts! Inotify only works for local filesystem!

PID_FILE="/opt/koel/koel-watch.pid"
MEDIA_PATH=/mnt/koel-music-share
PHP_BIN=/usr/bin/php

case "$1" in
start)
        #get the scripts own PID number
        echo $$>"$PID_FILE"
        inotifywait -rme move,close_write,delete --format "%e %w%f" $MEDIA_PATH | while read file; do
                $PHP_BIN artisan koel:sync "${file}" > /opt/koel/koel-watch.log 2>&1
        done
         ;;

stop)
   #kill `cat "$PID_FILE"`
   pkill -P `cat "$PID_FILE"`
   #kill -9 `cat "$PID_FILE"`
   rm "$PID_FILE"
   ;;

restart)
   $0 stop
   $0 start
   ;;

status)
   if [ -e "$PID_FILE" ]; then
      echo Service is still running, pid=`cat "$PID_FILE"`
   else
      echo Service  is NOT running
      exit 1
   fi
   ;;

*)
   echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|status|restart}"
esac

exit 0
```

i figured out it wont work on network shared drive. Because i put my music on synology NAS drive (and not using the synology audio station because its slow software).

Has anyone found out some way on how to monitor file changes on network drive?
The only working way to sync koel at the moment is by triggering cron script to sync the complete file system at interval X.

**Describe the bug**
Upon loading the web client, whether on mobile or desktop, it stays stuck in the loading screen. No 500 errors are found in the developer tools, and no errors are being logged in storage.I've tried clearing cookies and logins, to no avail.

**Environment**
 - Koel version 4.2.2
 - OS: Server: Ubuntu 18.04
 - Browser: Firefox 71
 - PHP version 7.3.13
 - Node version 10.16.3

**Additional context**
Server is mounted on Apache 2.4

Hi,
on mobile view the drop down menu is cut-off when touching too much on the right side. The sub-submenus dont show because they fall out of the viewport
![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5631071/71516214-fbf4df00-28a7-11ea-8280-624a8752ed2f.png)

maybe it could be added some pop-on-the-left-side to css

regards, Mario

Hello,

I recently discovered and installed Koel and I love it ! However, I have issues with playlists :

-  When you open a playlist, there is a "Shuffle all" button, but no "play all". I never use shuffle mode and would love to simply play all songs in my playlist in order
- When you double-click a song in a playlist then use "Play next song" or "Play previous song" button, it doesn't play the next or previous song in the playlist, but rather in the "Current queue" list. This is confusing and kinda defeats the purpose of playlists.

All of this doesn't apply to "Artists" or "Albums" since those have a dedicated "play all" button that works fine. For playlists, I have to manually select all songs, then add them to the queue.

Adding a "Play all" button in playlists would solve all those issues at once.

Thanks in advance !
