#2452 may relate, I think.

I kept creating pull request every day from December 1st until today. refs: #2452
However, the 24 Pull Request indicated that the pull request I made was 29 (Unfortunately I did not get this evidence ...).
To indicate the exact number, I clicked [Synchronize Pull Requests].
But the numbers do not match. refs: #2452
When I displayed the [Contributions] tab of my page, it became as follows.

From the above, it appears that there are the following problems.
* The [Synchronize Pull Requests] button says "We usually check for pull requests every hour, but you can check now.", but it does not seem to check every hour.
* Even when clicking the [Synchronize Pull Requests] button, it does not seem to get all pull request information from December 1st to 24th.

I reported the problem earlier, but I will look at the code of [Synchronize Pull Requests].

I kept creating pull request every day from December 1st until today.
It is correctly displayed in the activity of GitHub as follows.

However, as shown below, 24 Pull Request shows that I have created 114 pull requests.

The rmw project's contribulator score doesn't show [on this page](https://24pullrequests.com/languages/C), even though it has a score of 34, as shown here: https://contribulator.24pullrequests.com/theimpossibleastronaut/rmw

🎯 **Goal**
The contribulator score should be shown as it is on other projects.

I don't know.

I have just completed a couple of PR's, and after syncing with GitHub I see the following:

And in the Contributions tab, I see the following:

Last year, I remember that if you created more than one contribution in a day, the gifts calendar would fill up "ahead" of schedule.

After speaking with Andrew on Twitter, he suspects that this is a bug.

🎯 **Goal**
<!--- Why is this change important to you? How would you use it? -->

It is important that contributions be recognised consistently across the site, to avoid confusion.

Could this be related to the "auto-gift" functionality, based on Twitter conversation with Andrew.

I created a pull request at Tokyo timezone December 1.
It is correctly displayed in the activity of GitHub as follows.

However, as shown below, 24 Pull Request states that I have not created a pull request.
Of course I'm pushed the synchronization button in the upper right.

We should store the calendar should be based on the user's local timezone.

Closed issue #408 may relate, I think.

🐞 **Prob**
The field's pre-populated with a string that includes a timezone offset of 0, but once changed doesn't include an offset, so eg my first entry was "about 11 hours from now"

Hello!

I work at [Skylight](https://www.skylight.io/). We are launching a [program](https://www.skylight.io/oss) to offer free Skylight accounts to open source apps (similar to Github and Travis), so I am reaching out to see if this is something you would be interested in.

If you’re not already familiar with Skylight, it is a smart profiler for Rails apps. Skylight makes it easy to pinpoint performance issues in Rails applications.

We work on a lot of open source projects ourselves, and in our experience it can be pretty hard to get contributors to work on application performance issues. Few contributors consider working on performance problems, and the ones that might be interested may not even know where to start. By making performance information more accessible, we hope to inspire potential contributors to tackle slow parts of your app, and have a good way to see if their contributions helped.

For reference, this is the [Skylight dashboard](https://oss.skylight.io/app/applications/g0gJSNnzYAws/) we set up for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It should give you a pretty good idea of how Skylight works.

Integrating Skylight to a Rails application is very easy. All you have to do is add the gem to your Gemfile and set an environment variable with your authentication token (we are happy to send a pull request). If you’re interested in setting this up or if you have any questions, you can reach us here or at [support@skylight.io](mailto:support@skylight.io).

We'd also love to feature you on our [website](https://www.skylight.io/oss) as one of the first open source organizations using Skylight. We hope you’ll join us in helping to make performance an accessible way to contribute to an open source project!
It is now January 2018, nothing is going on for December 2018, and I cant see any info about December 2017.

Ideally the UI shows the previous years statistics all year round, at least until the next program is ready to start.

At 7:53PM EST I submitted a pull request. When I click `Synchronize Pull Requests` in my dashboard, the 24th pull request does not show up. Under my profile, it shows that it is December 25th, even though it is December 25th.

🎯 **Goal**
<!--- Why is this change important to you? How would you use it? -->
<!--- How can it benefit other users? -->
I put a lot of work into getting 24 pull requests out and I'd like my profile to convey it.

Please give us the ability to fix the time zone usage or at least count pull requests made after the 24th in a 24 hour period to allow for differences in time zones.

There is an emoji being showed as raw text (with a `]` next to it, for some reason). I haven't tested if `:rofl:` emoji is causing the problem or just because there is a blank line after it.

Above is as rendered by 24pullrequests while the one under it is the actual render (by GitHub).
