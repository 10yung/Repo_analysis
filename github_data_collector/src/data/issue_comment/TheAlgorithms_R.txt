Put similar algorithms under an umbrella directory and make the files more organised.
Everyone is welcome to add more algorithms to this project. This repo is new so we need contributions from all.

Many new algorithms were added. The readme file can be updated with those new algorithms.
something like https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/README.md
