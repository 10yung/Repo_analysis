Since the work for iOS 13 has already been done by @cysp, and the product of that work is still needed (see #85) @kenji21 has suggested we do one final release of this project so this issue is to track that final merge.

Of course, knowing open-source projects they rarely go as intended and so I'd bet this isn't even nearly going to be the last merge! ðŸ˜‚
