Hi,

I have a C program that runs 10x slower when I fix the memory size of the microVM to 2GB in comparison to 8GB. The program itself uses 1MB of memory. I tried to use perf events inside the microVM but it seems like not every event is supported in alpine. What would be a good tool/way to measure the performance counters in the microVM? 

Thanks,
Anjali
## Reason for This PR

Refactor net device and drive it with polly.

## Description of Changes

In this PR the net device is ported on polly IO event manager.
The changes contained by this PR are as follows:
- added edge triggered event type to polly
- aggregated the information from `NetEpollHandler`, `RxVirtio`, `TxVirtio`, Net into one single struct `Net`.
- implemented `handle_read` for `Net` device, which is now also a polly `EventHandler`, and can
handle events related to Net device (queue events, tap events, rate limiter events).
- provided a single execution path which registers the `Net` device and also handles the `PATCH` request from microvm runtime.
- separated the Net device into specific and self contained components, which resembles the `Block` refactoring, which will help us to draw a more generic view of devices.

There is still work to be done to complete the refactoring for the `Net` device:
- update unit tests
- provide documentation where necessary
- implement error handling to polly events handling.

Commits relevant for review:
- net: net dev is driven by polly
- net: separated the net dev on components

## Description of Changes

Made the necessary changes to the device manager tests to follow the post-decoupling mmio-virtio interface.

Other improvements:
- The MMIODeviceManager does not need to hold a reference to GuestMemory. Refactored the code a bit to cut that dependency.
- GuestMemory is owned by Vmm, the Vm object is also owned by Vmm. There is no point in both Vmm and Vm to hold references to GuestMemory. Remove it from the Vm object as it doesn't need it in any way.

## Reason for This PR

Fixed, completed and reorganized some things inside the api_server.
Please keep in mind while reviewing that this does not aim at making api_server perfect. These are just nice, good improvements.

I have the build using the 'musl' compiler working. But the build using the 'gnu' compiler will not work. I have verified on tag v0.20.0.

#In One Shell:
./tools/devtool build -l gnu
rm -f /tmp/firecracker.socket
./firecracker --api-sock /tmp/firecracker.socket
#Run the commands in the 2nd shell
#MicroVM Fails to Boot with this error:
2020-01-16T13:55:07.572561421 [anonymous-instance:ERROR:src/vmm/src/signal_handler.rs:37] Shutting down VM after intercepting a bad syscall (39)

#In Another Shell:
#Follow everything in the Getting Started Guide: https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md
#'musl' works following these steps, 'gnu' does not.

--

Am I missing something simple? Do the kernel and rootfs need to be tied together with 'gnu' to run on a 'gnu' build?

Looking forward to your response.

On snapshot creation, make sure to flush disks so that any in-flight data in the host OS buffers gets committed to the files backing the disks.
The `rescan_block_device` function (which can only be triggered after the guest has booted up) does not update `disk_nsectors` field. This field is used in the `process_queue` so it is vital to the good functioning of the block's transport requests.
The change fixing this bug should also make sure this duplicated warning ([here](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/refactoring/epoll_handler/src/devices/src/virtio/block.rs#L509) and [here](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/refactoring/epoll_handler/src/vmm/src/controller.rs#L88)) gets deduplicated and is used both when `Block::new` is created and also at `rescan_block_device`.
## Reason for This PR

The `--` (extra-args) feature for propagating
jailer parameters to firecracker gets appended
only when config-file is specified.
Fixed this by implementing a forward looking approach
that enables us to even exercise our new implementation
of the arg parser.
## Description of Changes

The approach implemented mirrors the codebase. Added the extra-args parameter to the jailer (just like in the [codebase](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/master/src/jailer/src/main.rs#L272)) that can be tweaked from inside the integration tests in any means possible for the sake of exercising valid as well as non-valid scenarios.
