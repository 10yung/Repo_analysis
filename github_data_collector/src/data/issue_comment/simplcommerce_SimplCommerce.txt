I am trying to add some changes for a Delivery Service and When I add the classes(Domain Models) and Inherit either EntityBase or EntityBaseWithTypedId<long> for the ones with F Keys Entity framework is throwing a multitude of errors. I make the changes, build then I run Add-Migrations in the Package Manager console. If the migration is successful(about 1 in 3 times) I get prompted to Update the database as I should, But the I get the error that the objects are already in the database.
If the Migration is unsuccessful, then I get the error that the migration failed because it was unable to ready the parameter of type(key), in verbose logging that error directs me to a country Id that is a string in the configuration, but EF thinks that it is not a string.
I am very stuck, I need to keep working on what I am doing, but this not being able to migrate is holding me up.
when you try to add products to a warehouse, a red window appears but no error message is shown. so you do not know the reason why product can not be added.
It has a less restrictive license and you can use it completely for free, unlike SQL Server.

It suits more to open-source projects and it has a great JSON support too (better than mariadb/mysql). The community is also much more active

I can open a PR if you agree
every time when i create a new module,  and have some entitys,  

according dotnet ef commond, (dotnet ef migrations add XXXX) for new modules,

at last , when the framework statrup, it will check new migrations ,and then update database!

Hi! 
According to Getting started docs https://docs.simplcommerce.com/en/latest/getting-started/

`PM> Update-Database`
`Build started...`
`Build succeeded.`
`The specified deps.json [C:\Users\...\SimplCommerce\src\SimplCommerce.WebHost\SimplCommerce.WebHost.deps.json] does not exist`

Where can I get this file?
Currently, in the `checkout/shipping` view, you have to fill the form in order to select the shipping method. It doesn't always work like that. Different shipping providers require different types of addresses or no addresses at all and just a specific code unique to that provider.

https://github.com/simplcommerce/SimplCommerce/blob/9c797f7011d93c9391250138310dae1b09d81ee9/src/Modules/SimplCommerce.Module.Orders/Areas/Orders/Controllers/CheckoutController.cs#L76

The shipping provider should be able to specify if the address is required or not and be able to save a custom address format somewhere (like location id specific to that provider).

So maybe adding a property like `IsShippingAddressRequired` to `ShippingProvider` would suffice and validating only if the shipping address is required for the chosen method.

Then custom fields could be specified with some kind of JSON schema stored in another column like `FormSchema`, see:

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20241059/how-to-create-a-form-from-a-json-schema

There's already `AdditionalSettings` in ShippingProvider which is good.

Example of such shipping provider is https://inpost-solutions.com/ where you just select a locker location instead of an address.

More providers with parcel lockers (e.g. UPS access points too) https://www.ipc.be/services/markets-and-regulations/e-commerce-market-insights/e-commerce-articles/parcel-lockers

Ideas?
UPS offers many ways to access the API (JSON, XML, SOAP) the easiest way would be to use included WSDL schemas and that should generate the client using Connected Service:

https://medium.com/grensesnittet/integrating-with-soap-web-services-in-net-core-adebfad173fb

I'm not sure if such generation tools exist for JSON, so using JSON could be more work but could be more performant due to more lightweight data format

It's a very popular shipping carrier. I'm currently looking at ways to implement this

Any guidance would be helpful ðŸ˜„
