My team uses this framework along with facebook SDK. We are adding the support for mac through mac catalyst. For this the underneath bolts also need to support mac. But the latest 1.9.0 doesn't work well with mac catalyst. There are compilation issues. We need the target "Bolts-iOS-Dynamic" of the project to be working with "mac" option turned ON. Hence please provide a build that works fine with mac catalyst. 
This pull request replaces use of now deprecated ``UIWebView`` with ``WKWebView`` allowing Bolts-ObjC to be used in in Catalyst apps. 

The changes are rather straightforward, but I do not use this code at all so I just made it compile under Catalyst and not tested it at all.
After uploading the App to appstoreconnect,we receive this message:
```
ITMS-90809: Deprecated API Usage - Apple will stop accepting submissions of apps that use UIWebView APIs . See https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiwebview for more information.
```
I am integrating `Bolts` by `CocoaPods`,I wonder how i can delete the files that using UIWebView related API.

Updating to match XCode 10.2 project settings recommandation and make it compliant with Swift5 Compiler
Hi guys,

I'm working on an old codebase and we have many warnings about:
```'exception' is deprecated: 'BFTask' exception handling is deprecated and will be removed in a future```
It happens in cases like this:
```
@try {
        [[ILRLogin sharedManager] activeWithServer:server];
        LRSession *session = [[ILRLogin sharedManager] getAuthSession];
        [session onSuccess:^(id result) {
           ............
        } onFailure:^(NSError *err) {
           ............
        }];        
    } @catch (NSException *exception) {
        [task setException:exception]; --> HERE
    }
```
or even in the caller, where I check `if(task.exception)`.
I googled a lot but I couldn't find advices about what to do instead. 
Is there a replacement method? Should I just ignore the exception in the catch block? 
Can you please point me in the right direction here?

Thanks,
Alessandro
```
    var tasks = [BFTask<AnyObject>]()
    let allTask = BFTask(forCompletionOfAllTasks: tasks)
```

does not work...

XCode 10.1 shows the following warnings in a project that uses a pod that requires Bolts:

First off, thank you guys for maintaining this amazing repo.

With the latest Xcode 10 fixes, I'm trying to update podspec in my project with the latest changes.

The pod is not releasable with a commit, only with a real published version.

The last release was Jan 1.
This pr fixes compiling `facebook-ios-sdk` and `facebook-swift-sdk` with latest xcode 10 using carthage by implementing the fixes described in https://github.com/facebook/facebook-sdk-swift/issues/246

ps: to be clear, when building Bolts directly using Carthage there was no issues at all, including compiling on latest beta 6, it is just when compiling either `facebook-ios-sdk` or `facebook-swift-sdk` that the problem arises
