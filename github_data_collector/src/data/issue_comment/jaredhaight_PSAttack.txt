Running PSAttack on Windows 8.1 as low privileged user.
After decrypting PSAttack Get-Attack it throws an unhandled exception.
Any idea?


Unhandled Exception: System.IO.IOException: The handle is invalid.

I am getting this error when trying to run .\PSAttack.exe from inside a powershell window.

can you make the option to build it as a dll so it can be used where (bad) app whitelisting is in place?
PSAttack should have automated testing.

Hi,

Do you think it could be modified such that we can call it from the command line like in the following and have the results channeled back?

ie, inside a cobalt strike beacon or empire shell:

shell PSPunch.exe Invoke-AllChecks

then it will run Invoke-AllChecks automatically from within PSPunch.exe then send back all the data?

-> Some cases where PowerShell Remote is disabled on a host, this binary drop should bypass the restriction.
