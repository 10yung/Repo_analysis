give example use with strip 
like how to validate card 
if it is has balance or not 
and other validation 
Let's say I save a saved card that I know is of Visa or Mastercard brand. I can fetch the numeral data and show it in the card form but the card color doesn't change at all. It remains black.

I have tried the following:

` creditCardForm.colors[Brands.MasterCard.rawValue] = [hexStr(hexStr: "#ED495A", alpha: 1), hexStr(hexStr: "#8B1A2B", alpha: 1)]`

Is there a way to set the brand color and show the brand image (visa, mastercard etc) manually?
        
The payment textfield only lets you write in the card number, expiration and cvc number. Is there a way to let the user write the card owner name as well?

Pod version is 0.1.8 but the repo are at 0.1.9
When ever I am trying to add zip code it will allow string with infinity number 
I want only 5 numbers not strings like characters.
First of all, thank you so much for this library. It is awesome.

The issue I have seen is that when entering Amex card, the card image flips to simulate entering CVC number from the back. However, AMEX cards have their CVC numbers on the front. See the example from Stripe's own demo:

So the question is since you went through the trouble to make Stripe's lousy UI actually worth something, do you mind taking a look at this enhancement so that when a user enters an AMEX card, we don't actually flip but rather show the entering of CVC on the front of the card instead? Let me know what you think.
Thanks.

I am trying to send values from the cards.pay library when scanning the credit cards but when using the 


      ` let params = STPCardParams()
        params.number = "4242424242424242"
        params.cvc = "123"
        params.expYear = 22
        params.expMonth = 06
        self.paymentTextField.cardParams = params`

This error marks me Thread 1: Fatal error: Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional, on line 432 of the CreditCardFormView file.

I am new to swift and I would appreciate it if you can help me
