Is there a way already in Pulseq to know the start and stop times of each block from the seq file. I really liked the testReport.m functionality to do a bunch of these things. I was hoping to code it myself but looks like there has been quite a bit of thought into this already. Q: For a given block, need to know tstart and tend in the whole sequence:using checkTiming(obj)/calcDuration?
A check on whether the prescribed delay in the delay block is a positive integer multiple of gradient  rastertime would help in catching errors where delay might be computed elsewhere or in other parts of the code. Alternately ceiling/rounding with the developer's knowledge may also be considered.
Hi,

I am trying to construct sequence with a 180 degree pulse followed by 30 degree pulses. When I try to execute the sequence on the scanner, an error message "start of measurement failed" popped up. I am wondering what the problem is and could you help with it? Thanks!
