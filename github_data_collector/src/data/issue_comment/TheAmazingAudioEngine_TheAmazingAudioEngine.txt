我想绘制音乐播放的实时音波图，请问该怎么做。
regionStartTime not work correctly when the sampleRate is different between _outputDescription and _fileDescription of AEAudioFilePlayer
Hello guys,

Is there any React Native version of this library as of now? 
I would love to see that...

Thanks,
Hi,
 I need to create a visualizer like ZLHistogramAudioPlot. I have tried this code below but didn't work as I expected.  

` AEBlockAudioReceiver* blockAudio = [AEBlockAudioReceiver audioReceiverWithBlock:^(void *source, const AudioTimeStamp *time, UInt32 frames, AudioBufferList *audio) {
            Float32 *buffer = (Float32 *)audio->mBuffers[1].mData;
            size_t bufferByteSize = (size_t)audio->mBuffers[1].mDataByteSize;
            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
                [self.audioPlot updateBuffer:buffer withBufferSize:(UInt32)bufferByteSize];
            });
`

I use the theAmazingAudioEngine to record kAudioFileMP3Type type,  but failed ,  get a error message "fmt?"  ，  can you tell me how to record other audio type like "mp3", "wav"  etc 

- (BOOL)beginRecordingToFileAtPath:(NSString*)path fileType:(AudioFileTypeID)fileType error:(NSError**)error;
@param fileType Set up kAudioFileAMRType No output。
It is a play when record app,but need add a delay time when playing.
Any way to do that?
Empty my control center. After that, I can't set the control center.
