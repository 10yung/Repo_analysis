Added `scrollDirection` parameter which defines the direction of scrolling behaviour. 
If not provided, the vertical scrolling behaviour will be used.
Added the parameters for showing scroll indicators of the ScrollView.
The default behavior is still set to false
When you scroll there is a layout issue at the top of the screen. The GIF below compares expected and actual behaviour.

[QGrid Bug](https://gist.github.com/jacobcxdev/29f41f1e5cb11ecfb78aa9980c625503)
If you embed the ZStack in a List as in the following:

    var body: some View {
        GeometryReader { geometry in
            List {
                ZStack {
                    self.backgroundGradient
                        .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
                    VStack {
                        if (QConstants.showDesigner) { self.designerView(geometry) }
                        self.gridView(geometry)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

Then you get this in the simulator:

I have tried various experiments and the best I can come up with is to add a frame modifier as in:

    var body: some View {
        GeometryReader { geometry in
            List {
                ZStack {
                    self.backgroundGradient
                        .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
                    VStack {
                        if (QConstants.showDesigner) { self.designerView(geometry) }
                        self.gridView(geometry)
                        .frame(width: geometry.size.width,
                               height: geometry.size.height)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

But this is still wrong because the grid is in the wrong place (see screenshot) and I can't work out how to fix it. Any ideas?

The wrong number of columns are displayed, when opening the app directly in landscape. The initial device orientation is not detected.
This creates a Tests folder that has the necessary files to create and add tests for things in the main `QGrid` package!

Why: This is a step in the right direction for the item on the Roadmap / TODOs

How to run the test suite? Easy!
Do
`swift test` 
in the root directory of the repository.
I noticed that the QGrid only works well when not contained in a NavigationView.

It seems to not correctly respect the safe area and cuts off part of the UI that seem to have the hight of the navigation bar.

Here are some examples of what I mean:

![Simulator Screen Shot - iPhone 11 Pro Max - 2019-10-22 at 11 22 03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49232993/67273155-32843700-f4be-11e9-9504-af0ed49e93cd.png)

As you can see part of the UI underneath the navigation bar is cut out.
Also the lower part of the grid is cut out due to the home indicator.

```
NavigationView {
    QGrid(profiles, columns: 2) { profile in
        ProfileCardView(profile: profile)
    }
}
```

If I add the `.edgesIgnoringSafeArea([.all])` to the grid, this is what happens:

```
NavigationView {
    QGrid(profiles, columns: 2) { profile in
        ProfileCardView(profile: profile)
    }
    .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
}
```
Can you please elaborate on the usage of NavigationLink with QGrid?

NavigationLink does not seem to be working here.
