Fix localization errors
Hi, I forked your repo and added the latest changes:
Added Hextech origin and champions
Added Pantheon to Dragon/Guardian
Updated items and class origins with the latest patch changes to the ItemStrings_en-US.xaml descriptions.
Code builds, adjusted some of the row sizes so that the text would all fit.
更新啊
This is maybe a bit of a corner-case, but I play on a 4k screen and since League's cursors don't get that big I use the giant Windows mouse cursors and [YoloMouse ](https://pandateemo.github.io/YoloMouse/)to get them huge in-game so I can't lose my cursor.

However, because of those, in the TFT overlay it can end up covering half of the tooltips, like this:

(Camera picture because my screenshots don't include the mouse)

So I would like to ask: would it be possible to have the tooltips show up in the top-right instead of the bottom-right of the mouse position? If it's not a high enough priority, I might try to take a look at the code later but I hardly know any C# so I don't expect to get too far.
