I think we're just using a warning task where we should be logging. This is annoying when viewing logs or pipeline status, but should not impact our build output.
Internal apps consuming vnext will consume Facebook React Native APIs
instead of our Microsoft.ReactNative APIs. These will currently break if
they do not manually add ReactPatches targets when updating.

This change leads to projects consuming React Native directories to
automatically enable patching. Impact of this is mitigated by changes
to make patching consume less disk space, along with the fact that
external template based projects will not be subject to patching since
they do not consume react native or import raw react native property
sheets.

Only copy and patch ReactCommon, since that's the directory we currently build. This reduces disk space overhead for projects from 14MB to
under 2. This should save ~200MB of outputs for a full build.

Additionally rename some properties, which were using names which are no
longer accurate or may be confusing.

# Proposal: [Platform override integration tool] 
Build a tool to help automate the process of integrating diffs in RN4W platform overrides when RN4W platform does an upgrade to latest version of react-native

## Summary
The process of upgrading RN4W to latest version of react-native involves manually diffing every one of our platform overrides (eg Dimensions.windows.js) with changes that happened in react-native/master.  This process is too manual and error-prone.  This proposal is tracking building a tool to help automate this process.  There is a spectrum of possibilities here - on the simpler end it could be something that helps us with the manual process (eg it could just tell us which files are interesting), on the complex end it could be something that automates the process of integrating diff's.

## Open Questions

###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/pull/3906)
The new ReactHost implementation depends on code that we currently have in Office internally known as Mso library. Recently we have published an initial set of Mso liblets as github.com/microsoft/Mso project, but this one is missing DispatchQueues and Mso::Future required by ReactHost.

In this change we add a new simplified version of DispatchQueue and existing Mso::Future directly to react-native-windows project. This is a temporary code until we put all required code into the Mso repo and implement deployment mechanisms. But it should unblock us with the ReactHost implementation.

The new DispatchQueue implementation is missing timers and waiters, but it has a much more simplified code that also can do more:
* The new IDispatchQueueService can 
  * schedule and invoke tasks
  * shutdown queue
  * do task batching
  * support Queue Local Values (like TLS for threads)
* All platforms specific work is done by IDispatchQueueScheduler implementations

The change also includes implementation of [noexcept2] attribute for IDL files that will be replaced in future with the standard [noexcept] attribute when we start using new Windows SDK.
