I don't really know if it qualifies as a "bug report". but I have had very mixed results running the `spotifyd-full-git` package on Arch Linux.

When I follow the instructions to install it as a service, It creates the service but everytime I try to check on it with a `systemctl status spotifyd` it claims the service does not exist. I have tried using `/etc/systemd/user/` and `~/.config/systemd/` and I cannot get it to run as a service.

*One time* I got it to run by issuing the `spotifyd` command and I could see it in spotify-tui. But I could not get it to replicate, because even after a reboot I get the following error every time I try to run the executable.

```
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os { code: 2, kin

I don't think it's a backend or authentication issue, I just can't get it to start... This is the only way spotify-tui is worth using because if I can't get spotifyd working then I would be forced to run the full GUI client anyways...
Currently, spotifyd listens on a random port when it starts.  This is a problem because layer 4 firewalls cannot cope with random ports, so one must either open all ports to clients (iPhones and other untrusted devices) or simply not use spotifyd.

The program needs another command line option (not at all present in the --help output of the latest Linux release as of today) to force a specific port on spotifyd.

Thanks.
I noticed that I didn't have the pulseaudio backend available from spotifyd-bin-full from the AUR.

Looking at this CI run: https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/runs/338348234 

It appears that the same build command is used for both slim and full: `/usr/share/rust/.cargo/bin/cargo +stable build --locked --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --no-default-features --features ,alsa_backend`

Building spotifyd-full from source does include the flags. 
Hi, please upload this to crates.io - we need this in order to package it for Debian
Removed some not necessary lines and made a fix for cargo searching in wrong file path for libasound.so.
please uncomment the deploy section.
