I use the latest version of uninstaller to clean up visual studio 2013 from windows 10.
then I installed visuals studio 2017 enterprise and mysql for visual studio 1.2.8
but mysql for vs 1.2.8 failed to be installed(always prompted by "visual studio 2012, 2013, 2015 must be installed)
I googled all the solutions on the internet. none of them can solve my problem

finally I found a solution:
open registry to search mysql for visual studio in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
deleted searched item for "mysql for visual studio 1.2.6"
then problem solved.

so uninstaller should deleted that registry item automatically.
I was meaning to uninstall visual studio 2015 but the uninstall process was taking too long and was not moving on so I quit the process midway. 

After quitting, my fan started rotating too fast and I found out that 'visual studio community 2015 update' procedure was eating up a lot of CPU (and not sure if it is related but windows search filter/protocol host and windows search indexer was also using a lot of CPU at the same time) i tried force quitting it but it kept turning back on. 

I rebooted my laptop but it was still using 100% of the CPU and it took some time before the 2015 update stopped running and the CPU consumption came back to normal. 

However, I know that windows search filter/protocol host and windows search indexer normally holds a portion of the CPU, but I'm disturbed by the fact that it is now higher than it used to be. 
Is it somehow related to quitting the uninstall process midway?  

edit: on turning on laptop everytime, I've found that Windows installer, windows VSIX installer and Microsoft compatibility telemetry are the ones that are popping up and using all the CPU. 
I have to manually quit the process in order to stabilize my computer. Is there a way to solve this? or do I just have to try uninstalling again?

edit: I've successfully uninstalled VS 2015 but the Microsoft compatibility telemetry and windows search ~ processes are still using a lot of CPU, I did some searching about these and I understand that it's running because a lot of files have been changed/deleted recently? If my understanding is correct, I guess I just have to wait for it to finish it's job
This is nice when viewing the README on the web.

I have Visual Studio 2012 Professional and used it for years without a problem.
Then some day I needed Visual Studio 2015, installed it, then uninstalled main app only using standard uninstaller via Control Panel -> Add/Remove Programs. My OS is Windows 7 SP1.
Some day I needed to compile Webkit and it's vswhere.exe found Visual Studio 2015 and build failed.
I thought I need clean uninstall Visual Studio 2015 but don't know how and have no installer and no idea why vswhere.exe detected it. So I tried this "Visual Studio Uninstaller". It found some leftovers from VIsual Studio 2015, and removed them successfully.
I rebooted a PC and tried to run Visual Studio 2012. It failed to run. I ran repair using Visual Studio 2012 installer, it ran but now I cannot compile 32-bit executables.
Every time I trying to build for Win32_x86 cl.exe fails with ">C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\V110\Microsoft.CppCommon.targets(347,5): error MSB6006: "CL.exe" はコード -1073741701 を伴って終了しました。".
I tried reinstall Visual Studio 2012, with or without update 5, clean reinstall multiple times, including reinstall of .NET Framework all versions, still the same problem. Win32 AMD64 compiler works without problem. Also I tried to replace C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\VC\bin\cl.exe by dummy 32-bit exe which does nothing, but still have 0xc000007b error when it runs.
When I run Visual Studio command line tools batch, both 32-bit and 64-bit cl.exe are work perfectly fine inside it: run, compile sources, compiled binary runs fine.
I have an error above only when cl.exe (32-bit x86) ran from Visual Studio 2012 IDE. Not sure what's wrong, but if anyone knows a workaround WITHOUT reinstall OS, please give it to me. Thanks!
Is it possible to remove the confirmation Y to run the application ?

Thanks

Right now, I'm trying to upgrade to VS 2017, and because of space restraints, I'm getting rid of VS 2015. I have started up your installer as an Admin and hit "Y", but so far the uninstaller hasn't gone any further than what you see in the screenshot.

Is it working? should I restart it? Or, perhaps, just sit on my hands?

This still runs the uninstaller, even though I did not want to do so. The `/help` does not say about the correct way to enter this parameter. If it should have been `Setup.ForcedUninstall.exe noprocess`, it should be emphasized in README.

On the other hand, either all parameters should start with`/`, or none. That was less easy to screw up.
