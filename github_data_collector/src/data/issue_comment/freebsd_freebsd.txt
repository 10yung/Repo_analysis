vm_map_submap is destined to to fail if vm_map_lookup_entry returns FALSE or entry->end < end.
I think we only need to do vm_map_clip_start and vm_map_clip_end when vm_map_lookup_entry successes and entry->end >= end.
In inline assembly at freebsd/contrib/ntp/lib/isc/backtrace.c:134, the
function `getrbp` directly set the rax by movq, this implementation works
in most cases but will fail with compiler optimization. When compiler
try to inline this small function, the behavior will be a little out of
expectation. I produce the bug case as below:
```
static unsigned long
getrbp() {
        __asm("movq %rbp, %rax\n");
}

int __attribute__((noinline)) set_val(int v) { return v; }

int main() {
  int a = set_val(0);
  int b = set_val(1);
  int c = set_val(2);
  a = a + b; b = b + c; c = c + a;
  unsigned long d = getrbp();
  printf("%d, %d, %d, %lx\n", a, b, c, d);
  return 0;
}
```
Assume rbp is 0x55555555 when invoke getrbp, the output of the above
code should be `1, 3, 3, 55555555`, but when the above code is compiled
with flag -O2 (gcc-8 on my PC), the output will be trash value. For
example, `1, 1108317873, 1108317873, 0`, the 2nd and 3rd number is
different when execute multiple times.
I was running this test on OpenBSD recently: https://github.com/NetBSD/src/blob/trunk/tests/lib/libc/sys/t_getgroups.c
getgroups/setgroups want an int and therefore casting it to u_int resulted in
`getgroups(-1, ...)` will not `return -1` and set `errno = EINVAL` but instead just work.
I haven't tested this on FreeBSD but the code already was in 4.4BSD to my knowledge.

This change is not tested. I suggest try this:

```
#include <sys/syslimits.h>

#include <stdio.h>
#include <strings.h>
#include <unistd.h>


int
main(void)
{
        gid_t gidset[NGROUPS_MAX];
        bzero(gidset, NGROUPS_MAX * sizeof(gid_t));
        printf("%d %d %d\n", gidset[0], gidset[1], gidset[2]);
        int a = getgroups(-1, gidset);
        printf("%d\n", a);
        printf("%d %d %d\n", gidset[0], gidset[1], gidset[2]);
        return 0;
}
```
Camcontrol only supported HGST branded drives, I updated the vendors list to support WDC and WD branded drives to improve compatibility for future drive releases

"no accent keys" consistently instead og "without accent keys"
An attempt was made to sort the lines and keep :en: strings first.

Reduce log level for message about unsuccesful port reset which ends up flooding syslog

The following sysctl configuration also helps to get rid of excessive logging but the downside that certain USB device (Create SoundBlaster) are not even getting recognized by USB hub controller.
