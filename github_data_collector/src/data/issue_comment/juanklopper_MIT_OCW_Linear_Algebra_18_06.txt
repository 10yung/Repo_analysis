Thanks for making these notebooks available. They are really high quality. This PR just includes a few typo fixes. I appreciate that the opaqueness of `.ipynb` files don't make it easy to see the changes. I understand if you aren't comfortable accepting this PR. This is the first time I've contributed a change to a Jupyter Notebook. Thanks again!
