Fixes #176.
`drop_exists()` is case-sensitive. This means that it will incorrectly return `FALSE` in the following scenario:

1. Alice creates (in her Dropbox) a file named `/Foo/bar/baz.txt`.
2. Alice shares `/Foo/` with Bob.
3. Bob renames (on his filesystem) the subfolder `bar/` to `Bar/`.
4. Bob invokes `drop_exists("/Foo/Bar/baz.txt")`, expecting the result to be `TRUE`.

Following up with a pull request.
I believe you are missing a dtoken = dtoken row 34 of drop_dir function. 

```
    if (is.null(limit)) {
        while (content$has_more) {
            content <- drop_list_folder_continue(content$cursor)
            results <- append(results, content$entries)
        }
    }
```

This is causing issue as asking new authentication when going in there. 


I am actually not sure why is this code needed why is not everything returned in drop_list_folder ? 




Hi, I am trying to load Rdata from dropbox to shiny. I follow the code posted on Issue #66 and it works when I run the shiny app locally. However, when I try to publish the app to shinyapps.io, it gives me error messages. Here is the error messages I found in the Logs:

Warning: Error in readChar: cannot open the connection
133: knitr::knit
152: readChar
132: <Anonymous>
151: load
127: <reactive>
cannot open compressed file '/tmp/Rtmp7B6lDm/data_f1_sub.Rdata', probable reason 'No such file or directory'

Here is the code:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(flexdashboard)
library(shiny)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(rdrop2)
token <- readRDS("token.rds")
drop_acc(dtoken = token)
drop_load_RData <- function(file, name, dest = gsub("\\", '/', tempdir(),fixed=T), dtoken = token, ...) {
  localfile = paste0(dest, "/", basename(file))
  drop_download(file, overwrite = TRUE, dtoken = dtoken)
  load(localfile)
  get(name)
}
```
```{r}
cell_labels=drop_load_RData("data_f1_sub.Rdata","cell_labels")
```
Please give me some guidance. Thank you so much!
Hi, I recently started using rdrop2 but to experiment on a shiny app i was developing. I tried to upload an image from my local system into my dropbox account. But I noticed that the images uploaded there were replicating the same name (0.png). 

I tried printing the address path of fileinput() and noticed the tempfile() copied the images a /path/0.png for every image in try to upload.

Can you help to figure what I should do.

```r
library(rdrop2)
library(shiny)

# you can use an image for your reprex
outputDir <- "www"

ui <- fluidPage(
  fileInput("new_image", "Upload your images", accept = c(".png", ".jpg"))
)

drop_auth()

server <- function(input, output, session){
  observeEvent(input$new_image, {
    infile <- input$new_image
    if(is.null(infile)){
      return(NULL)
    } else {
      drop_upload(infile$datapath, "www", mode = "add")
    }
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)

```

## Expected Behaviour
I expect each unique image to be uploaded with each unique name as name of image file eg(bird.png, cow.png etc)

## Actual Behaviour
I got images file with only 0.png and tempfile() output as:
"C:\\Users\\myusername\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpaQy0Xv/101d5f09fad253a9ae0d5840/0.png"

## Account Type
Dropbox Basic



## Session Info

Hello and thank you for this package,

I got this strange message while working locally on my shiny app. I already have a shiny app online and I also uploaded a dropbox token created locally to read files from my dropbox account. The application was working fine.

Today I continued to work on my application but locally, but **through the same Dropbox token**, to do some modification. Every time my application starts, one file is read by my dropbox account. While working locally I had to start the application several times, and at a certain point I received this strange error.

I checked the application online, and it was not working as expected too. Then I tried again after some minutes, and now it seems that the application online works again fine. 

I am wondering if there is a limited number of request in a certain amount of time that could be done through the Dropbox token. If yes, where can I find these informations?

Thank you and best regards,

Nico
I hope it makes it easier to understand and it insist on the problems with drop_create (see #68 )

Partially fixes #68 .

Hello everyone and thanks for your work!

Do you know what would be the best way to move multiple files from one Dropbox folder to another at once (for example after a specific input) through the drop_move() function?

Thanks in advance.


Hello, Thank you very much for the development of the package.

I'm encountering this error when trying to upload a 400Mg "CSV.gz" file.

```
Error in rdrop2::drop_upload(nome_arquivo_csv_gz, path = dir_arquivo_dropbox,  : 
  Request Entity Too Large (HTTP 413).
```

Is the development of this API complex? Could I help with something?

Thanks.
Hi,

Thanks for your great app. I have a shiny app on my own server. everything about rdrop2, like drop_download, drop_dir and etc works well but when I want to drop_delete() the app will be disconnect from server but it works well when I run it from my own laptop. Do you know where the problem comes from?
