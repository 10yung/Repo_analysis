CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:87 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindCeres.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Ceres", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Ceres" with any of
  the following names:

    CeresConfig.cmake
    ceres-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Ceres" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Ceres_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Ceres"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.

Hello, I think it misses some files on this project. After running matching_pipeline.m (it misses pdist2.m to compute eculidean distance of descriptors, I used my own), I obtained some files in 'descriptors', 'keypoints', 'matches' as you described in the instruction. However, I can not continue the evaluation by using the python script 'reconstruction_pipeline.py', as it requires to input the database file, which I haven't find after running the matching_pipeline. I do found there is 'DATABASE_PATH' defined in the 'matching_pipeline.m', but I didn't find where it is used. Can you help me to fix the problem?
