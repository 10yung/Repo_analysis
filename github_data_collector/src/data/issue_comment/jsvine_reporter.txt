Hi there,
First of all, thanks for creating this!
However, can't seem to build reporter... 
- I git cloned the reporter and created a _posts folder in the reporter folder
- Then I did jekyll build / jekyll serve

Configuration file: /Users/JeffreyTang/reporter/_config.yml
/Users/JeffreyTang/reporter/_plugins/mtime.rb:5: warning: already initialized constant Jekyll::Post::MATCHER
/Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/jekyll-2.3.0/lib/jekyll/post.rb:7: warning: previous definition of MATCHER was here
jekyll 2.3.0 | Error:  can't modify frozen Array

Thanks for your help!
J


In code, make the data source URLs into clickable links.

Alternately, ensure that any data sources mentioned in the code show up below the code in a "sources" section where they are clickable.
