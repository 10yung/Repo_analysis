**Describe the bug**
Stop download button is nearly the same color as of the background in the dark mode. Which makes it less visible, especially in low brightness. 

**Expected behavior**
Stop download button should be clearly visible.

**Steps to reproduce the behavior:**
1.  Switch to dark mode
2.  Download any book.

Rewrite of SearchActivity to kotlin and viewmodel

Fixes #1350 

**Specific implementations**
- Added the search button to the tab switcher. Local search is hidden and searches will open in a new tab.
- The position of visible icons in the top bar is fixed, instead of changing depending on if you're in an article or in the tab switcher.
- Add note icon is disabled in the tab switcher (no need of it).
- Description added to the icon `open new tab` (of the tab switcher) and the `return` (of the search activity), as recommended in [Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActionBar.html#setHomeAsUpIndicator(int)) when `setHomeAsUpIndicator()` is used (`through setHomeActionContentDescription()`).
- These descriptions are in the strings XML file, with id's `open_new_tab` and `return_from_search`.
- Added translation for both of them to Spanish.

**Tabs previews in Tab switcher when dark theme is active doesn't change.**
When we're in the Tab Switcher of the app, and the app is working with the dark theme, the preview for each opened tab continues being the normal one. The background is white and hyperlinks are in blue. The only change is shown if the article preview contains an image, in that case, the image will have inverted colors.

**Expected behavior.**
There should be a continuity with the theme. If the dark theme is active, previews also should be in that theme.

**Steps to reproduce the behavior:**
1. Activate Dark theme is your phone. This can be done in the developer settings or through the Kiwix's own settings.
2. Open the app
3. Open the TabSwitcher
4. See error 

**Environment**
- Version of Kiwix Android : 2020-01 Build: 6200070
- OS version : Android 9, API 28

Even on closing after reading book search icon appears and one can search on previously opened doc
and even click find on-page.
Steps to reproduce:
0)You're in the home page with **no search icon**
1)Open any book 
2)Close that from recent
3)Now You came on the home page again.
4)But still, it has a Search icon where you can search prev open doc.

Doing this manually is too complicated.
