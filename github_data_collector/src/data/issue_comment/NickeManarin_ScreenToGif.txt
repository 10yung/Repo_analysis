When I add a progress bar and save with the 2.0 encoder, it very often (but not always) causes severe artifacts when played (it never seems to happen without a progress bar):

But the 1.0 encoder doesn't have the same issue:

I like the smaller file size of 2.0, but it's really annoying having to always check for this issue. I've uploaded the project file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/161ZhAgwyqBRmDxW41SdmPiEazE3UI62b/view?usp=sharing) in case that helps you reproduce it.
Cross platformness is something that was asked number of times here.

Now, .Net Framework 4.6 is dead and .NET Core is where all the things will happen. Migrating to it would be great for both maintainabilaty and futre prospects on cross platformness. For example, v3 added WPF (for Windows only currently). 

This will make it much easier to achieve Linux/Mac port in the future - maybe WPF will become x-platform itself, or it can be switched to something else like Avalon or whatever... There is also option to use [wine](https://ccifra.github.io/PortingWPFAppsToLinux/Overview.html) with WPF on linux. 

So, switching to net core provides a lot of more options, and it must be done sooner or later anyway.
字幕可以给文字加描边，轮廓，但是不能位置调节不方便；”自由文本“文字位置自由度高，但是文字不能加描边。
To reproduce:

1. Record something.

2. Edit > Delete All Next.

3. Save the frame somewhere.

4. Repeat the process and attempt to overwrite the previous file, with the option to do so checked.

P.S. Thanks for the awesome app! I love the crisp UI and all the editing options I get :)
I currently make a bunch of GIFs for our documentation that visualizes workflows and often times I need to add a border, say a phone, tablet, or monitor (something like [this](https://www.pinclipart.com/picdir/middle/365-3656433_computer-monitor-with-shadow-computer-screen-border-clipart.png)). I would essentially like to throw my animated screen capture right into the screen of the image so it looks something like [this](https://commercialdev.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/099009e2341240dd95e943e5d690f46d/resources/1568054478649.gif?token=AIe0nI9nFAUibLhT-INk_6amRAORrR8lcqG-DBUWfiEIyJcVqPeUT4uNAN4x6f8DHIiTFkmuPPxIiOigZ8hk3VoKeebKX6KduJmY3YQ6QpN2-kZsEny6CqyhoiZ2GkG1yKgBd3np_n2QSwjQTlx7uxTBpRvIPNSwsFDNRFDp46YuMaozc7HDumL3Vcoo-uvEDhphrVtSegJfXdofXQvhqUgXtYNptHHJdi4eRvVAPto.).

I currently have a clunky work-around where I take my capture -> overlay it into the image -> record the capture again with the new border.   It would be nice if I could add a custom image border to my screen capture in the the project editor, through the **Border tool** under the image tab.

Is this something the is currently possible and I'm not in the right menu?
Don't know how to create a Question here. Is it possible to record only if Pixel changes on Screen ?
Is it possible to launch a record directly from command line?
Something like:

    screentogif -boxcorners=0,0,800,600 -duration=60s -savefile=test.gif

?
Thanks!
Not a major issue, it's just annoying that applying a caption moves the scroll bar back to the start because most often the next thing I want to do is add another caption starting on the next frame.
1. In ScreenToGif >option >extra, the gifski.dll should have been 1M in size, but the file I downloaded is only 502k.
2. The path of gifski.dll don't contain chinesen, it's in D:\gif.
3. Gifski encoding is failing when using, and The error report is as follows:
![Error Report](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58970365/71483395-9cb0b380-2842-11ea-9370-888f32235f6d.png)
4.I'm In China, I download gifski in option>extra through VPN, maybe there will be errors in this way, so I want to ask if there is any place where I can download gifski.dll directly, because ffmpeg.exe is directly downloaded, and then manually associated in screentogif.
Finally, Thanks for your great software.

I use the 
`-c:v h264_nvenc -pixel_format yuv420p -preset default` 
to start the NCENC output video，the output is successful ，but the speed increase is not obvious, and the CPU usage is still very high. 
My graphics card is P2000, after turning on the NVENC encoder which only takes 5%. I am not familiar with the ffmpeg command. Can anyone help me?
