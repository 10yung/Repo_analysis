There seems to be a mistake in the "Implementing HOG" notebook and the related one with HOG examples. Namely, I am referring to this code fragment:

```
# Add up all the histograms for each cell and count the number of histograms per cell
for i in range (num_cells_per_block[0]):
    for j in range(num_cells_per_block[1]):
        ave_grad[i:tot_by + i,
                 j:tot_bx + j] += hog_descriptor_reshaped[:, :, i, j, :]
        
        hist_counter[i:tot_by + i,
                     j:tot_bx + j] += 1
```

I want to draw your attention to the fact that average gradient array is initialized as
```
ave_grad = np.zeros((y_cells, x_cells, num_bins))
```
whereas `num_cells_per_block` is a number of cells in (x, y) direction.

Thus, the code computing the average gradients is mixing x and y dimension, because i is iterating over `num_cells_per_block[0]`, which refers to x dimension, but then `i : tot_by+i` expression is used as an index in the y dimension. 

The code doesn't produce any errors as long as `num_cells_per_block = (2,2)`, i.e. number of cells is the same in x and y dimension. But once we try to change that to something like (4,2) it results in broadcasting error due to dimensions mismatch. 

I suggest changing it to:
```
for i in range (num_cells_per_block[0]): #x
    for j in range(num_cells_per_block[1]): #y      
        ave_grad[j:tot_by + j, i:tot_bx + i] += hog_descriptor_reshaped[:, :, i, j, :]
        hist_counter[j:tot_by+j, i:tot_bx+i] += 1
``` 

**Issue:**

While Running Project1 Notebook2 on google colab I was getting following Future Warning,
```
/content/data_load.py:39: FutureWarning: Method .as_matrix will be removed in a future version. Use .values instead.
  key_pts = self.key_pts_frame.iloc[idx, 1:].as_matrix()
```

**Solution:**
replace .as_matrix() with .values in data_load.py at line no.39
there was a spelling error



There is a typo in the word "example" in line 11.
