Seeing as node 12.4.1 has been made the latest stable release, I am wondering if it is possible to add node v12 support for node-yue.
Is there a way to access native features from the OS by running Swift or Objective-C for mac apps through Yue?
While more apps are supporting dark mode for their UIs it seems like a good idea to bring this to Yue too. I specifically like the way Electron is handling this by providing a subscriber (see below). The upside of this is that we are also able to subscribe to different notifications, like when the user has locked/unlocked his screen etc.

What do you think?

```
const { systemPreferences } = require('electron')

systemPreferences.subscribeNotification(
  'AppleInterfaceThemeChangedNotification',
  function theThemeHasChanged () {
    updateMyAppTheme(systemPreferences.isDarkMode())
  }
)
```
I might be missing something here, but is there a way to set up "virtual lists" with yue? As in: I have a scrolling container with thousands, or tens of thousands of childViews in it, and I want the app to render the items "lazily". Right now, it takes ages just to display the first few items. Maybe someone can point me in the right direction? If there’s a way to do a custom implementation on top of yue, that’s cool too! Thanks!
Is it possible to use Webview 2 on Windows if it's available?
The main Yue repo has not had a commit for 5 months. I am wondering if work of Yue has been halted, and if so, for how long?
I have this simple code:
```javascript
const win = gui.Window.create({})
win.setContentSize({width: 400, height: 400})
win.setTitle('Yue Test')
win.onClose = () => gui.MessageLoop.quit()

const tabs = gui.Tab.create();
win.setContentView(tabs);

const testTab = gui.Container.create();
tabs.addPage('Test', testTab);

const testText = gui.Label.create('test');
testTab.addChildView(testText);

const testTab2 = gui.Container.create();
tabs.addPage('Test2', testTab2);

const testText2 = gui.Label.create('test2');
testTab.addChildView(testText2);
```

But when I start the app and try to change tabs, the application suddenly freezes and stops.
In the console it outputs an error 3221226525 (ELIFECYCLE)

No clue what I'm doing wrong...

OS: Windows 10 (64 bit)
Yue: 0.6.3
Node.js: v10.15.3
Yode: v0.4.2



When I do `require('yue.gui')` on lua, he doesn't work, he says he's not finding the gui
I didn't find any references in the documentation.
Is this planned to be implemented?
