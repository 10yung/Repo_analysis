This will require some fun interaction with understanding the wire protocol message version on connect. The MongoDB 3.0 Java driver seems to do some of this already.

Both Java Driver & Casbah/Mongo-Scala for versions 2.x and 3.x

This serves several purposes:

1) Ensure consistency with what other JVM level drivers (and presumably all 10gen official drivers given their undocumented ongoing "meta" move) encode/decode and expected behaviors especially for wire protocols at different versions of MongoDB.
2) Gives us an idea of where our performance compares to the official drivers.
3) Evaluate interoperability for future features.

"Docs" in Java Driver. Also handle old ones and convert them "up".

GridFS support for MongoDB.

The Collection library isn't _terrible_ in my book, but it isn't quite right. It doesn't provide enough `CanBuildFrom` support as best I can tell, and I'm still using legacy stuff like `MapProxy` presumably unnecessarily.

Should be cleaned up to conform to sanity.


I'd say anyway we say hammersmith supports MongoDB 3.0+ spec only?


They were removed in the Akka migration.

Support and test Replica Sets; outlined in docs on ["Connecting Drivers to Replica Sets"](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Connecting+Drivers+to+Replica+Sets)
