Whenever i run localhost:9999 on my host server, Jupyter stops in Ambari, any work around for this? 
Hi Randy,

I have an Ambari cluster build on Ubuntu 14 LTS OS. I see your Jupyter service is missing (TODO: add ubuntu) the Ubuntu configuration and I would like to help if I can. I added few changes just for you to review. Changes are not definitive as you can see but they are a start.

Would you mind adding the Ubuntu OS into this service? Or instructing myself so I can finish the code?

Awaiting your reply, thank you very much.

Kind regards,
c.

Hi,

I installed this service on a cluster of 5 host (Jupyther server on host-4 and client on the other ones). Each hosts have 8 cores.

When I see on the tab "Cluster" of Jupiter Web UI" it tells that only 8 cores are available: I expect that should be all host-clients in this tab!

Any suggestions?

I ran into this with a customer using RHEL 6.6.. the OS name comes back as 'red hat enterprise linux' and not 'rhel'

Will this service work with a kerberos secure cluster?
Is this jupyter ipython notebook multiuser now? Or do I have to use https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub instead of this service?

Thanks

It would be great to add NLTK to the default set of packages installed. 

I'm getting this error when trying to install the service:

seems there is a python 2.7.9 conflict with the installer in Centos/RHEL 6.6
