Using v20180402_linux64gcc6_release of openFramework
General correction and optimization
+ openFrameworks 0.9.8 after recompiling dependencies and libraries, and correctly setting my OF root, I had my compile fail with:

`../openFrameworks/libs/openFrameworksCompiled/project/makefileCommon/compile.project.mk:221: recipe for target 'obj/linux64/Release/src/noiseVisualization.o' failed
make[1]: *** [obj/linux64/Release/src/noiseVisualization.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory '/tmp/dex-ui'
../openFrameworks/libs/openFrameworksCompiled/project/makefileCommon/compile.project.mk:124: recipe for target 'Release' failed
make: *** [Release] Error 2
`

Has anyone else encountered this?

Ok so i've tried setting this up and running it on a VM on my computer by following the steps mentioned in one of the other threads but I can't get it to compile I always get a compile error such as: 
 <code>
make[1]: **\* [Debug] Error 2 
make: **\* [Debug] Error 2
 </code>
and it never works, So i'm wondering whether it is possible for someone to give an actual explanation on how to set this up and whether i need a certain version of linux to run this, and whether it is possible to run this via Xcode on my Mac because it's built on Open Frameworks? 

For the impatient 5-second-attention-span crow ... hu'h cats!

After struggling for an hour trying to compile this, I finally did. I managed to get the shaders working, but there are missing images.

```
[ error ] ofImage: loadImage(): couldn't load image from "images/ref-img.png"
[ error ] ofImage: loadImage(): couldn't load image from "images/noise-bg-color-darker.png"
[ error ] ofImage: loadImage(): couldn't load image from "images/noise-bg-color-darker.png"
[ error ] ofImage: loadImage(): couldn't load image from "images/ref-img.png"
[ error ] ofImage: loadImage(): couldn't load image from "images/noise-bg-color-darker.png"
[ error ] ofImage: loadImage(): couldn't load image from "images/noise-bg-color-darker.png"
```

I can't seem to find them anywhere in the repository. And if for some reason you don't want to add them to the repository, what are they supposed to look like and what sizes?
