Looks nice
It works fine, but from time to time, the top menu bar goes away without something I would be aware of doing. Any solutions? Anyone experiencing this?
Not sure if it's the standard behavior across all Jupyter notebooks, but I'm going to post this here since I use your supreme theme :+1: 
My goal was to prevent the automatic center alignment for multi-line latex formulas. The inline LaTeX rules ( surrounded by `$`  ) seems to be left-aligned but anything besides that did not work.
After an hour and a half battling with LaTeX alignments, I decided to check the page source. From there it was quite obvious that Jupyter-Notebook will automatically add an inline-css rule (center text alignment) for all `.MathJax` dom-elements. 
To force the left-alignment to work, I have added the following css rule into custom.css :
```
.MathJax_Display {
  text-align: left !important;
}
```

â€¦ visual dislikes.
See how it looks:

Hello,

First, thank you for this theme, I love it when I use it in full-screen with firefox. But..

Once installing this theme, the installed Calysto extension (https://github.com/Calysto/notebook-extensions) stopped working, in console it shows : 404 GET /nbextensions/calico-spell-check.js?v=20170212134450 (::1) 10.50ms referer=http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Untitled6.ipynb?kernel_name=python3. 

The jupyter notebook still works fine in the web browser, but none of the extension icons shows up.  Simply reinstall the extension doesn't work. 

Thank you

Yu
