# Failed with: 
```python
File ".\main.py", line 422, in process_queue
    start = time.clock()
AttributeError: module 'time' has no attribute 'clock'
```
# Fix: 
Replace all calls to time.clock() with time.perf_counter(). time.clock() has been removed from the time module in Python 3.8.

please help me i really love your game.!

While trying to run the game in Ubuntu Linux 18.04 (64-bit) with system-provided pyglet package (`python-pyglet`), game fails with the following error:
```
$ python main.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):

```
Pyglet and other package versions to be installed in ubuntu
```
libjs-underscore 1.8.3~dfsg-1
libjs-sphinxdoc 1.6.7-1ubuntu1
python-configparser 3.5.0-1
python-future 0.15.2-4ubuntu2
python-pyglet 1.3.0-1
```
After uninstalling system-provided pyglet package and installing pyglet through pip game works fine, also pip provides newer versions (`pyglet-1.4.1` and `future-0.17.1`) instead.



```
def add_block(self, position, block, world):
    world[position] = block
```
then reloading the world or calling `window.update(1)`
something like that??
