Auto Recover GPU script also gives an exception
I added a Q&A about error 14003 that I had trouble figuring out. It may help someone someday.
I've seen a comment about Windows 2019 Server that says "I do not actually recommend Server 2019, seems to break stuff...investigating.". 
What is it exactly? I may help with it.
