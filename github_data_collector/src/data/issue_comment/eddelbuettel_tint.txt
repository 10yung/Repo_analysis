The [`tufte-book`](https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/) class made the `tintBook` pdf variant possible.

There is nothing (yet) for html that is really comparable. The `gitbook` default for [`bookdown`](https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/) has a [tufte variant](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown-demo3/) but I find it lacking.  The navigation bar is pretty awful.

We would need some proper js / css / html help, and it may be a fair amount of work.  In the meantime, the pdf variant is functional.
When reporting to clients, they tend not to care (nor wish) to see the code. This means it's common to set knitr options such that echo=FALSE. With this option set, arbitrary marginfigure chunk content is not shown and this fact is not otherwise documented. However, it's easily fixed by add echo=TRUE to the marginfigure chunk option. I do not know if this effects the LaTeX version, as I don't use latex.

I submitted a PR to rstudio/tufte for this, not sure if your repo will pick it up automatically or not:
