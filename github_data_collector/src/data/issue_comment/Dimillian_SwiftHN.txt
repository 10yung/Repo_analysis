I have this bug 

> “Use Legacy Swift Language Version” (SWIFT_VERSION) is required to be configured correctly for targets which use Swift. Use the [Edit > Convert > To Current Swift Syntax…] menu to choose a Swift version or use the Build Settings editor to configure the build setting directly.
> warning: no umbrella header found for target 'HackerSwifter', module map will not be generated

How can I solve it?

It would be great if comments/threads were collapsible.


I get prompted that the app requires iOS8 on the App Store. I hope you can help. Thanks!

The comments and username buttons on each article tile in the main list view do the obvious things on tap (take you to the comments, show posts by the user). However, the same buttons when on the comments page for an article are non-functional. I would imagine that the username button on that page as well would take me to a list of posts by that user.
