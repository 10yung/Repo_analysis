I'm using the latest n2n version from github, dev branch
I compiled Ubuntu and windows versions in Ubuntu environment and deployed to my ubuntu server
The port can communicate successfully(test with nc)
But when I run supernode in server and edge on my windows pc, it didn't output the log after "edge started"
no error or no success?
Minutes later,it shut it down automatically
It did output something like "Supernode not responding..."

It's that a bug?
See #195 

This PR allows for the embedding of the supernode in another application (in my specific case, to write [Go bindings for n2n](https://github.com/pojntfx/gon2n)). In addition to that, it also adds more examples for embedding, which were created in order to show a more advanced custom configuration.

The API was changed to allow for the following "high-level start functions" to be created in the bindings:

[Supernode starter](https://github.com/pojntfx/gon2n/blob/master/pkg/supernode.c)

```c
#include "n2n/n2n.h"

int supernode_configure(n2n_sn_t *sss_node, int lport);

int supernode_open_lport_socket(n2n_sn_t *sss_node);

int supernode_open_mgmt_socket(n2n_sn_t *sss_node, int mgmt_port);

int supernode_start(n2n_sn_t *sss_node, int *keep_running);

int supernode_stop(n2n_sn_t *sss_node);
```

This was achieved by decomposing `sn.c` into `sn_utils.c`, `sn.c` and defining the new public functions in `n2n.h`.

The relevant new examples are [example_edge_embed.c](https://github.com/pojntfx/n2n/blob/dev/example_edge_embed.c) and [example_sn_embed.c](https://github.com/pojntfx/n2n/blob/dev/example_sn_embed.c); I have moved the edge embed example with the `quick_edge_init` function to [example_edge_embed_quick_edge_init.c](https://github.com/pojntfx/n2n/blob/dev/example_edge_embed_quick_edge_init.c).

Please take all of this with a grain of salt. I have never written any C before and followed only a simple C tutorial beforehand (I only know Go/JS/Ruby) ;)
It would be awesome if it would be possible to embed the supernode in an application. I am currently writing some (very basic, I have never written any C before and am just a novice when it comes to Go) [Go bindings for n2n](https://github.com/pojntfx/gon2n). The bindings will also have a command for edges and supernodes and I plan to write a Kubernetes CNI plugin with them. While the public API as defined in `n2n.h` allows for easy embedding of `edge`, it is currently not possible (at least not with my current knowledge of C) to embed the supernode. To do so, I have created a [temporary fork of n2n](https://github.com/pojntfx/n2n) in which I have decomposed the supernode in a similar way that the edge is currently (`edge.c`, `edge_utils.c` => `sn.c`, `sn_utils.c`), and if there is interest in changing the API to allow for embedding I'd be more than happy to start a pull request.
I compiled windows with vs2017, unable to connect, exit, no error

https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/12/21/Qjn9sJ.jpg
In windows, it is 1390
In linux, it is 1290
I don't know if it was set up on purpose.
Thank you!

So there are moments when the networking works, and when it doesn't.
I started edge like:

```
sudo /usr/sbin/edge -c XXX -d XXX -k MYPASS \
  -l HOST:PORT \
  -a MY_IP \
  -m MY_MAC \
  -f -v
```

And supernode like:
```
/usr/sbin/supernode -l PORT -v -f
```

And I see that the networking starts working right after re-registering
(Rx REGISTER_SUPER_ACK message printed).

I don't really know what to look for in the logs, any hints please?

n2n v2.4 it good enough in most network enviroment,but in some occasion(slow connection or long distance) it cause packet loss.
consider about FEC please, thanks!

I hope it will help
After playing around with N2N for quite a bit, I was at first a bit disappointed by the performance - 20 Mbit/s on a gigabit connection? Well, at first I didn't enable AES (after adding `-A`, I was able to go to 50 Mbit/s), then I checked the CPU, which was at 100% (a 1 CPU instance). Upgraded the node to 2 CPUs, 100 Mbit/s. We're getting there! Now, I used `-v` to get some more details; I did not think that adding logging would reduce speed drastically. After removing `-v`, the speed went up to 300 Mbit/s. Now, I though about some more options, so I ran another `edge`. Yet another speed improvement, this time I was able to achieve 430 Mbits, which is really quite impressive for a _userspace_ VPN.

It would be awesome if there would be a specific section on perfomance. Having such simple changes literally allowing N2N to have _22x_ the speed is a thing that some emphasis should be put on IMHO.

Anyways, thanks so much for developing this! N2N is awesome!
hey
supernode getting time out and nods unable to connect with edge
Currently, the documentation on how to use DHCP is lacking IMHO.

I've been trying to implement the following setup:

Node 1 (`supernode`, `edge` and `dnsmasq`):

Node 2 (`edge`):

```bash

Logs on node 1 (`supernode`):

```bash
17/Sep/2019 02:34:39 [sn.c:645] New community: hirschkopfnet

```

Logs on node 2 (`dnsmasq`):

```bash
# see above (no new logs)
```

I've tested `dnsmasq` on node 1, where it works just fine. If I assign a static IP to node 2 and then make a DHCP request, it works as well. The thing that is not working is the DHCP ip address assignment on node 2 with the `-r -a dhcp:0.0.0.0` option.

It would be awesome if there would be more docs on how to setup DHCP; if someone could help me with this specific setup here I'd be glad to write that of course.
