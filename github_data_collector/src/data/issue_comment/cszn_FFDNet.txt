I am having trouble while using your training code. The error is not decreasing after a certain threshold (2.8). Can you tell me how did you manage to train your model.
In your file model_train.m, you multiply the sigmas with an array of random numbers. Since randn produces negative numbers such as -3.14, the sigma will exceed 75 in the image. My question is that why do you multiply the sigmas with that array

K = randi(8);
labels = imdb.HRlabels(:,:,:,batch);
labels = data_augmentation(labels,K);
sigma_max = 75;
sigmas = (rand(1,size(labels,4))*sigma_max)/255;
 <-------------- This line! ------------------>
new_arr = bsxfun(@times,randn(size(labels)), reshape(sigmas,[1,1,1,size(labels,4)]));
inputs = labels + new_arr;
I can't run the demo, because 'vl_simplenn_tidy' donâ€˜t exist. And it seems that some functions don't exist too.

please! When I use the pytorch model, I meet an error. 
I want to denoise an image using a one of the pretrained models

python test_ffdnet_ipol.py \
	--input input.png \
	--noise_sigma 25 \
	--add_noise True

I have:
### Testing FFDNet model ###

	add_noise: True
	input: 111.png
	suffix: 
	noise_sigma: 0.09803921568627451

	no_gpu: False
	cuda: True

Process finished with exit code 0
I have no use to get anything, but I have configured the libraries that need to be configured.
Then I debugged it and when I debugged this statement, the project exited.
	if args['cuda']:
	 	**state_dict = torch.load(model_fn)**
		device_ids = [0]
		model = nn.DataParallel(net, device_ids=device_ids).cuda()

I want to know why I can't use the training model?@cszn
@cszn  hi guys,thanks for your great job,it performs better than CBDnet ,dncnn  in my data,i want transplants this algorithm to embedded platform. i have trouble in convert this training result .pth to .onnx,can you give me some advice,looking for you replay,thanks a lot.
Thanks for your work. But I have a question about  how can num_input_channels=15 in training step and 3 in test step?
can you share training dataset about color images,thanks
Hi, initially I would like to thank you for your very good work.
Then I have a question: I've images with more than one channel and the noise level is different in different channels.
How should be setted the noise level map? 
Thanks for your help.
Hi @ @cszn
I was very impressed from your works including good peformance of DND set.
I heared that your sigmas are manually selected,
could you share me the applied sigmas for each images at the DND?

Thanks a lot
