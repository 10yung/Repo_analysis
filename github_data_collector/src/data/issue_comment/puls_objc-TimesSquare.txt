I can't run this app. So, Please give me a proper link.

I was looking through your sample application and when translating the following code to Swift 3:

```
- (void)scroll;
{
    static BOOL atTop = YES;
    TSQCalendarView *calendarView = (TSQCalendarView *)self.view;
    UITableView *tableView = calendarView.tableView;
    
    [tableView setContentOffset:CGPointMake(0.f, atTop ? 10000.f : 0.f) animated:YES];
    atTop = !atTop;
}
```
I get an error:

Value of type TSQCalendarView has no member tableView

In order to give access to the tableView in Swift, I have moved the declaration of the tableView property from TSQCalendarView.m to TSQCalendarView.h

Is this a reasonable option?
Is there a way that I can calculate the frame size of a specific month? I want to be able to only display a month up to the bottom edge of the month and still allow to scroll the calendar to the next/previous month. This would require that the frame size be calculated after each scroll has stopped to take into account months that display 5 vs 6 weeks. Also, is there some sort of notification when the calendar has finished scrolling?
