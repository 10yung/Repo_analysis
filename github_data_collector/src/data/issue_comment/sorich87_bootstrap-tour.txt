Hi ! I'm using BootstrapTour V.0.12.0 and i'm having an issue with the title and text of the popover, 
it doesn't display.
Here is how i implement my tour :
var tourCollaborateur = new Tour({
    name: "tourCollaborateur",
    steps: [
        {
            element: ".intro-collaborateur[data-step='1']",
            title: "MY TITLE",
            content: 'MY CONTENT.'
        }
]
});

And I start it :
tourCollaborateur.start();

I just copied and pasted the "Setup your tour" code sample, and there are no "next" or "prev" buttons at all. Everything is included properly. Everything else seems to work fine, except this little error.
I don't know if this is a bug or a problem that only i face.
I'm surprised no one has mentioned this already, or if they have, I was unable to find it. Anyhow, has anyone stored tour state in a database before? If so, how is this possible? I know there will be requirements on the backend, but I am more interested in knowing how to set it up on the frontend. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated! Thank you :)
I'm posting this because the same question/issue keeps being raised, and people are creating well intentioned but not secure solutions to it.

Very simply: if you are using Bootstrap Tour with the current versions of BS3 or BS4 [see below], the "Prev"/"Next"/etc buttons and other elements will not appear in your tour popover.

The reason is the introduction of the Bootstrap Sanitizer. This sanitizer strips content from popovers to prevent security vulnerabilities like XSS attacks. 

The "obvious" solution many people have chosen is to turn off the sanitizer globally, or change the global Bootstrap sanitizer whitelist, or disable the sanitizer for the Tour popovers.

To be clear: **do not do this** unless you are 100% confident you understand the implications and the risks/ways in which an XSS attack could be introduced into your site/code. Making global changes to the BS sanitizer could introduce security vulnerabilities into other 3rd party plugins you're using.

If you want to fix this missing button problem yourself, you must add the correct DOM elements to the specific Tour's popover whitelist, not globally. Alternatively you can use my fork of Tour that solves this problem.

You can see my fork here: https://github.com/IGreatlyDislikeJavascript/bootstrap-tourist

You can read the detail of this sanitizer issue here: https://github.com/IGreatlyDislikeJavascript/bootstrap-tourist#options-to-manipulate-the-bootstrap-sanitizer-and-fix-the-sanitizer-related-breaking-change-in-bs-34x

[BS4 note: Bootstrap Tour is not BS4 compatible. My fork is fully BS4 compatible and fixes a number of other issues]
In [BS v3.4.1](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3.4.1/js/popover.js#L51) tooltips and popovers sanitize HTML by default, thus removing navigation buttons from the tour.
Using bootstrap4.1 the popover-nagivation div is always empty !
This is due to bootstrap 4.1: it removes all "button" tags from the popover content.

It is possible to enable the button by adding `sanitize: false,` after `html:true,`  when the popover is initialized (`$element.popover.`).

Thanks for this library !

Regards.
Thierry.


I'm having such a hard time with the redirection option.

Can you post more example on the docs please?

`steps: [
			{
				path: '/home/books',
				orphan: true
			},
			{
				path: '/home/books',
				redirect: function () {
					document.location.href = '/home/book-detail?book=761'
				}
			},
			{
				path: RegExp('\/home\/book-detail\/[^/]+','i'),
			}`

All sorts of things happens, like infinite redirects, of try to redirect to page like "http://home///book-detail//i/"

I trid a lot of things and nothing works.

Thanks
