Bug


* **What is the current behavior?**
After updating, the iron will go to a 5v only "mode" after 1 or 2 power cycles when using the DN.OX QC adapter supplied from Bangood in the "TS80 More" kit. 
Problem does not appear to be something being set in the iron as it does not affect my AILAVI-180312 QC3 boost module - which has normal 9-12v operation after updating.

* **What is the expected behavior?**
The iron will use 9v with this adapter as before the update.

* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem**

***Steps to reproduce:***

1. Update to v2.08
2. Bring iron to temp using DN.OX adapter 
3. Unplug & repeat step 2.
*4: I found that plugging the iron into a standard 5v2A supply and back into the DN.OX will also trigger this "5v only mode"

***Video of problem if hard to reproduce***

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

Maintain compatibility with the "supplied" adapter.

* **What are you running:**

On the idle screen, you can hold the settings button and it will show you the firmware version.

  - Firmware Version: 2.08
  - PCB Version: 2
  - Power Supply (Voltage and Current Rating) :
1) DN.OX:
3.6v-6.5v/3A
6.5v-9c - 2A
9v-12v - 1.5A

2) AILAVI-180312 boost module:
5v/3A 
9v/2A 
12v/2A
(24w max, QC2.0/3.0)

(Sorry I lost the template by accidentally clearing it.  And GitHub is being really nice and saving my blank draft for me so I can't restore it.  This is a sort of mix of a bug report in that it doesn't limit and feature request in that I think it should.)

I got a little too enthusiastic upon reading the description for this latest firmware and downloaded and flashed too quickly without paying attention.  In so doing I accidentally flashed a TS100 firmware onto my TS80.  Luckily this is not a fatal thing, but since the display comes on and shows stuff it almost seems like it worked ok which could potentially confuse the issue in diagnosing it.  Some sort of super simple checking mechanism either in the flash itself or on startup (maybe a configuration option that says "is TS80" or "is TS100" producing an error if the wrong one is set?) producing an error onscreen and not attempting to continue incorrectly?  It seems distinctly possible that using the wrong firmware might -- if not now then perhaps later -- potentially be able to damage the device.  Perhaps especially if going the other way around is also possible.

Obviously this is user error and not high priority, but perhaps something to consider at least.

* **What is the current behavior?**
Temperature in fahrenheit reading 30 above everything, displays 100F at 70F room temp and if programmed to 630F it displays 660F, temperature appears correctly when display is in Celsius

* **What is the expected behavior?**
Display the correct temperature

***Steps to reproduce:***

1. Turn on iron
2. Switch display to F

Hello,

I have issues to flash the firmware with the usb device method. I tried it with the original firmware and this. On Windows I get no storage device in DFU mode, just only in normal mode, where you can change the config. On my Mac I see the storage device and I can copy the firmware, but it just renames the file with a .ERR.

My DFU version is 3.45 and my current firmware is the the stock 2.18.

Are there any other ways to get this firmware in this device?
I got a STM32 Discovery and AFAIK it has a STM Link, can i flash it directly with this? If yes how?
A problem I stumbled upon:
I had trouble updating my TS100.
I always got a ERR file.

Reason was I am using "Copy Handler". Copying the file with normal windows copy worked, the iron updated and I got a RDY file.

Perhaps you want to edit that in Readme install notes.

* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem**

***Steps to reproduce:***

1. load firmware v2.07 (31-12-19) on TS80
2. set idle screen to "detailed"
3. view idle screen

When the voltage ends in anything other than a zero, eg `11.4` it shows the decimal digit but when the voltage is a whole number, it ends with the decimal point and no trailing zero.

* **What is the current behavior?**
My Charmast 20800 mAh QC 3.0 was working without problems but since the latest and the firmware before that it will not switch to 12V but stay at 9V and also it will be switched off after some seconds of idle.. Also the following zero will not be shown on the volt display but the dot ;) And if you don't have the tip inserted there is no error message but a temp of 430 shown.

* **What are you running:**

On the idle screen, you can hold the settings button and it will show you the firmware version.

* **What is the current behavior?**

    Currently, a value will roll over with no indication, e.g the Boost temperature will go `440 -> 450 -> 250`, requiring the user to memorize the max and scroll though all of the values again. 

    The "Press-and-hold" functionality will also just breeze past this max at full speed.

* **What is the expected behavior?**

    It would be helpful to mark the highest value before it rolls over. Again with the Boost, going `440 -> [450] -> 250`. That way the user will immediately know "This is the highest value, it can't go higher than this" and doesn't have to scroll through them again. Bolding, italicizing, inverting the colours, adding brackets, something that is possible to implement while clearly indicating a difference.

   Additionally, the "Press-and-hold" should stop at the maximum value. Another possibility is to pause for a second, then roll over, pause on the lowest value for a second, then continue.
