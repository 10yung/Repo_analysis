how could I use the radio type with to options as extraSignUpFields? I need to describe its options:

{
        field: "worksInTenant", // Medical Regional Council
        label: "Trabalha em uma cl√≠nica cadastrada?",
        type: "radio",
        placeholder: ""
      },

May someone help me?
is anyone having this error on the new meteor 1.3?


hi,

There is a bug when trying to connect with an account and clicking on the icon instead of clicking on the text.

The case is that you click on the <i> tag instead of on the button tag,
so the this refers to the font awesome and :
$(event.target).attr('id').replace 'entry-', '' - fails
since this isn't the button

the bug can be solved by changing the  accounts-entry/client/views/social/social.coffee (Line 28) to check for this case.

you can easily add an if statement to check if there is an id or not,
if not skip and then it will propagate.
 another option is to check for the parent node instead of propagation.

Now that Meteor supports Angular out of the box, how can we use this package with Angular?

It's no longer flow layout. It's blaze layout now. Please fix it! Thanks

just updated to Meteor 1.2 and hit the same issue reported by @RanaivosonHerimanitra here: https://github.com/Differential/accounts-entry/issues/243#issuecomment-142308142

per the 1.2 Breaking Changes (https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Breaking-changes-in-Meteor-1.2) I'm guessing LESS constraints need to be updated.

When submitting the Change Password form, the old password, new password, and password confirmation are displayed in the URL as plain text.

This may be fixed by submitting the form by POST rather than GET.

Hello guys!

I'm using custom function to check login on Router.onBeforeAction, with the following code

``` javascript
    ...
    Session.set('fromWhere', router.url);
    Router.go('/sign-in');
    Session.set('entryError', 'Error.');
    router.next();
    ...
```

But I keep getting redirected to '/dashboard' url after signing in, no matter what page I was trying to reach.
Any suggestions?
