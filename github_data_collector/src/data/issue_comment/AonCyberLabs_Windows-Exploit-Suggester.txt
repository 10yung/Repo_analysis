### What is Rawsec's CyberSecurity Inventory?

An inventory of tools and resources about CyberSecurity. This inventory aims to help people to find everything related to CyberSecurity.

+ **Open source**: Every information is available and up to date. If an information is missing or deprecated, you are invited to (help us).
+ **Practical**: Content is categorized and table formatted, allowing to search, browse, sort and filter.

More details about features [here](https://inventory.rawsec.ml/features.html).

### Why?

+ **Specialized websites**: Some websites are referencing tools but additional information is not available or browsable. Make additional searches take time.
+ **Curated lists**: Curated lists are not very exhaustive, up to date or browsable and are very topic related.
+ **Search engines**: Search engines sometimes does find nothing, some tools or resources are too unknown or non-referenced. These is where crowdsourcing is better than robots.

Hi, I don't get why you hit this line: `./windows-exploit-suggester.py --database <database> --ostext 'windows server 2008 r2' `

and in the output, vulnerabilities like 'MS16-032' don't show up, ms16_014 neither and it works too

Anyway the right exploit to do privilege escalation was the simple ms11-046 (adf.sys). Am I wrong something ? Why I am not able to detect this MS with the script? 

Thanks in advance

Recently came across a windows 2003 SP1 which was vulnerable to this attack.
Windows exploit suggester however didn't seem to notice it even tough it was represented in the Microsoft xls db so i tought i'd add it. I hope i added it right.
I love this tool but Microsoft will not update bulletin search spreadsheets anymore. It would be great if you can update windows-exploit-suggester. A little bit info about new security guidance:

A similar spreadsheet can be exported from [guidance](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance), however, it does not contain the update replacement information. I verified that the information about supercedence can be found in the [api ](https://github.com/Microsoft/MSRC-Microsoft-Security-Updates-API) response. 

Hi, i have windows 10 ,  and Python 2.7.13
When the script read the systeminfo file, this error show me.
