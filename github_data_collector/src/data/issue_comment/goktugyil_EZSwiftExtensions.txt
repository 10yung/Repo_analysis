Hey guys

Quite a few people have asked for an upgrade to swift 5. 

@Khalian and I have been out of the swift scene since swift 3 and mostly kept up with maintenance work on the project. 

However the swift 5 upgrade is much, much harder than the swift 4 one since its no longer backwards compatible.

Is there anyone who could take over, make this project Swift 5 compatible? We need a few reviewers as well.

How long to support swift5
UIWebView Deprecated in iOS13.
support for swift5? +1
Apple is blocking our app that uses EZSE. Will there be support to replace all references of UIWebView with WKWebView soon?

The only references are in the `BlockWebView.swift` file.
Update Swift5
