I'm unsure how to install on Cygwin as that uses pact and not npm...any suggestions?

Hi there,

The following could be misleading to a novice in GIT:
git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/master && git clean -f -d

Perhaps this one would suffice:
git fetch origin && git reset --hard HEAD && git clean -f -d
http://git.io/vfhol returns a redirect. That could be solved with `curl -L`. However, for something that goes into the bash profile, I think that it is a good thing to download it with a descriptive https url
Hi,
From what I can see, there is no tip talking about rewriting the commit history (authors, messages, dates), which is done with the `git-filter-branch` command.

This command is really not easy to use, and I don't see how it would be possible to add a one-line tip about that.

However, I have created a tool to help people doing that. You can check it out at [`git.io/editor`](https://git.io/editor), and the github repo is [here](https://github.com/bokub/git-history-editor)

Do you think it would be possible to add it in the **tools** section? Or maybe add it in a tip?
