Hi, I want to re-trained the network on my own data and I notice that each array entry in `prim_gt` folder is of shape `(num_of_parts, 20)`. Can you explain what do these 20 parameters mean?

Also, what's the use for `prim_rnn_batch_nz_all_tr.t7` and `prim_rnn_batch_nz_all_val.t7`?

Thanks in advance!
Thank you for releasing the code. There are few error that I am getting while using the script `script_parse_primitive.m`.
1. The `VoxelPlotter` function is not there. However, I found out the code on the internet. Similarly there is a missing source file in minFunc_2012. That too I found online.
2. Loading previously parsed primitives is not working (that is re-running the script `script_parse_primitive.m` with previously parsed primitive), because of the following reasons:
  a. In the script `script_parse_primitive`, there is error "Reference to non-existent field 'prim_all" for line 29.
  b. In the same script at line 71, "theta_prev = prim_param(vox_num_q,20);", there is an error about exceeding the dimension. I guess this is because it is trying to access 20th index, which is absent. 

It seems that the pipeline is broken in between different script, e.g. `script_parse_primitive.m`, `script_refine_parse_primitive.m` and `script_parse_primitive_symmetry.m`. If you can provide solution to the second point, that will be great.
