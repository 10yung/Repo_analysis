In order to ease up DANE/TLSA implementations it would be nice to be able to keep the private key.

We have a number of servers behind a load balancer, to pass the HTTP/File challenge, we would like to use a shared network location. This way whichever server is hit, the file will be present.

However, when using a network drive (either directly or mapped), get the following error -

`The website root path for <site-name> could not be determined. Request cannot continue.`

Ideally this setting would support network locations (maybe with credential support as well?).
Hello,

Please add the NameSilo.com API to Certify. I noticed that you already have namecheap, which is a service I used to use until I found a better one.

Thank you!
Error: Ip address in IIS binding reset after request certificate
Best I can tell, content-length header needs to be passed along with the request to have Microsoft Teams Incoming Webhooks work correctly. Trying to have a channel update anytime a certificate renewal succeeds or fails.
I am using your CLI CSV upload feature to add a big list of domains.

Is there any way to set the Website Root Directory?  What about the certificate store (I want to have them added to WebHosting instead of Personal)?
Today if you have a certificate for `a.com`, `b.com`, `*.a.com` and `*.api.a.com` and you need different authorization configurations for `a.com` and `b.com`, for example, you may create two configurations matching `*.a.com` and `*.b.com`, for example. However, that won't match `*.api.a.com`, and thus Certify the Web will try to use http-01 method. It would be nice if either `*.a.com` matched all levels or if there was syntax for matching all levels (maybe `**`)
It seems that, currently, Certify The Web does not support properly transcripts that are used in PowerShell scripts (post-request at least) as the resulting log files look like this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2383605/powershell-transcript-is-empty-when-running-script-from-sql-agent-job-in-2005-sq
Please implement a way to change the size of the generated private key. Minimum length should default to 2048, but allow up to 16384, which is the max size allowed at this time by schannel.
Greetings,

SQL Server requires KeySpec=1 to be enabled in the CSR in order for the cert to be properly recognized. A recently generated cert did no have this set. The cert is not recognizable in the SQL Configuration Manager. 

Environment: 
Server 2008 R2
SQL Server 2012
Certify  4.1.6.0

Cert Settings:
Single domain
No IIS Website
Challenge type DNS-01
Cloudflare DNS API
Deployment Certificate Store Only
CSR Signing Algorithm ECDSA using P-384 and SHA-384

Thanks!
