Hi

Thanks for your fantastic client !
I wrote a provider for my service named [Dokeop](https://www.dokeop.com)
**Add third-party IBM App ID provider oauth2-appid**
[Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/jampire/oauth2-appid)
**Code coverage** : 100%
**Parallel-Lint**: 0 errors & warnings

Do you have plans to use Github Actions as CI?
Add link to Deezer Provider 3rd party Provider.

FYI : Deezer is an online music streaming service (https://www.deezer.com/)
I am looking for a way to handle Uncaught League\OAuth2\Client\Provider\Exception\IdentityProviderException: invalid_grant exception. 

sample code 
```
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\OAuth;
use League\OAuth2\Client\Provider\Google;
use League\OAuth2\Client\Provider\Exception\IdentityProviderException;
require(__DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php');

class MailClass
{
  public function sendMail()
  {
     try
            {
                $provider = new Google(
                    [
                        'clientId' => $senderEmailClntId,
                        'clientSecret' => $senderEmailClntSecret,
                    ]
                );
                $mail->setOAuth(
                    new OAuth(
                        [
                            'provider' => $provider,
                            'clientId' => $senderEmailClntId,
                            'clientSecret' => $senderEmailClntSecret,
                            'refreshToken' => "sdfsdf".$senderEmailClntRfrsh,
                            'userName' => $senderEmail,
                        ]
                    )
                );
            }
            catch (IdentityProviderException $e)
            {
                echo "Exception catch";
            }
  }
}

```

But each time I get this fetal error 

> Fatal error: Uncaught League\OAuth2\Client\Provider\Exception\IdentityProviderException: invalid_grant 

See https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/.
Added a Netlify Provider that works with the [Netlify API](https://docs.netlify.com/api/get-started/) to the list of third-party providers.

I have developed a server using league/oauth2-server which successfully returns access tokens and resources when issuing the appropriate cURL commands.

I cannot, however, develop a functional client using the client credentials grant and I know that a lot of users of this package experience the same problem. I have asked the question on github, but I think the issue is the result of missing code due to a lack of insight (there is no explanation of how to create the resource owner endpoint within the oauth2-server docs), rather than a mistake or typo in the code which I have already written.

When making a `$provider->getAccessToken()` request, I recieve a response detailing that the Authorization Server's response did not contain a body.

Whilst this may not be an issue in itself, there is no documentation concerning it and the closest thing to a working client credentials provider class example is an answer to another stack overflow question.

Please see [my stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58102870/thephpleague-oauth2-client-getaccesstoken-throws-an-oauth-server-error-was) for an example of the provider class I wrote.
Hi there,

Thank you for this library!

I am trying to make a post request where I need to send a couple of parameters as well. But the parameters are not being included with the request.

Working CURL request:
```
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d 'aid=...&api_token=...&user_token=...' 'https://mywebsite.com/api/subscription/list'
```

Not Working Request:
```
$request = $provider->getAuthenticatedRequest(
    'POST',
    'https://mywebsite.com/api/subscription/list',
    $existingAccessToken->getToken(),
    [
        'form_params' => [
            'aid'        => '...',
            'api_token'  => '...',
            'user_token' => $existingAccessToken->getToken()
        ]
    ]
);
```

Error Message:
```
array(4) {
  ["code"]=>
  int(400)
  ["ts"]=>
  int(1569391222)
  ["validation_errors"]=>
  array(1) {
    ["message"]=>
    string(19) "aid cannot be empty"
  }
  ["message"]=>
  string(30) "Validation errors, see details"
}
```

What did I miss?
