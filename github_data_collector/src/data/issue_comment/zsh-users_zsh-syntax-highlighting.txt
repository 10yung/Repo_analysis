Fixes #674. Improves the behaviour for #670: there's no longer a `BUG:` message on stderr, but the tests don't pass (the error is recorded in the log message).  Conflicts with #667.

The code is based on the aliases code.  Some edge cases are probably missing.

In particular, I think what's happening is that in aliases `alias_style` is initialized to `alias` but in parameters, `param_style` isn't analogously initialized, so that's why the `assign` style never gets set.  The `return` in `_zsh_highlight_main_add_region_highlight` makes `assign` not be recorded anywhere.

Hints welcome.
- [x] Add array parameter versions of the alias-precommand-option-argument*.zsh tests
- [ ] Make them pass (cf. #670) - pass array parameters through the alias machinery

Fixes #646.

**Question**: Are there any concerns about highlighting redirections by default?
Shall we add a 256-color theme?  We could enable it automatically after checking the terminal's capabilities in `${terminfo}`.
First case:

```zsh
% foobar='x=$(ls)'
% $foobar
```

highlights the `ba` in green from `ls`, as foreseen in https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/issues/572#issuecomment-485036695.

Second case:

Exactly the same with a shorter parameter name:

```zsh
% y='x=$(ls)'
% $y
zsh-syntax-highlighting: BUG: _zsh_highlight_highlighter_main_paint: start(2) >= end(2)
```
Fix a CDPATH bug and #202.  Also handles the case of non-executable directories.
Idea from https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/issues/202#issuecomment-225201558.
Two cases:

1. `BUFFER='print -r -- release.md\'` highlights the backslash, but shouldn't.

2. `PREBUFFER='print -r -- release.md\' BUFFER='foo'` highlights `release.md\`, even though none of that should be highlighted.
Travis build fails on zsh-5.0.7 and older since commit 8b2768ab4007d3d883c3565e7998c431ba576b51, which added a test for 07f259f653df042e599975261cac7be1bda17.  (I didn't notice that yesterday because the build just before that one failed too for unrelated reasons.)

On 5.0.7 the failure is as follows:

```tap
# backslash
1..2
not ok 1 - [1,1] «\» - expected (1 1 "unknown-token"), observed (1 1 "arg0_").
ok 2 - cardinality check
```

We should fix this, for LTS distros' users and to make the CI bots useful.
(Context: we've received multiple support questions which were resolved by having the user switch to the feature/redrawhook branch, e.g., #654.)

After merging feature/redrawhook, arrange for users of that branch to see a message "You may switch back to master".
