**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I'm always frustrated when trying to listen to my most recently added songs, without having to go to the "Recently Added" tab, because this can't play every song one after the other without having to manually play them.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Something like the iOS and Android apps have - see screenshot below.

**Additional context**

When I press the button to skip songs, it consistently logs this error. It seems like it's a MusicKit issue because it seems to be plaguing all other Apple Music web players. It's not super consequential, other than it occasionally plays a half-second of the beginning of the previous song or some other short hiccup before skipping properly. I just wondered if there's any way of avoiding this error, as I'm trying to use the MusitKit functionality on my own website.

Using Chrome v79 on MacOS
Hi,

What is currently missing and really disappointing in Musish is that there's no album release date in album information window.
For example: https://beta.music.apple.com/ru/album/man-on-the-run-track-by-track-commentary/947975010 has it - 2014
But https://musi.sh/album/911604957 - no.

Also it looks to me that albums are not sorted anyhow or the logic is unclear. Normally albums should be sorted by the release date which luckily beta.music.apple.com/ does.
It would be really good if you could improve this.

Thank you!

Needs a service-worker.js and a manfist.json in the root. You can load the service-worker.js from your js, just check MDN PWA docs.

This will allow you to install it was a standalone PWA on linux. You'll get an application icon in the application bar.
