I see that you split the dataset into validation (500), testing (1,000) and training sets，but i just find traing and testing image list in the AADBinfo.mat.
so,how can i get the validation sets?
thank you!
Hi!
Thank you for your good share! 
I have a question that how to download the AVA dataset? I have checked a lot of information online, but there is still no clear way. I will be very grateful if you can help me solve this problem. Thank you!
i use the mobilenetv2 fine tune aadb and get regression six class attritute scores and total scores .
the result : 
`SROCC_v: 0.484	
SROCC_v: 0.404	
SROCC_v: 0.616	
SROCC_v: 0.455	
SROCC_v: 0.162	
SROCC_v: 0.607 total scores	`
 
we can see the total scores maybe normal , but the attritute scores is bad . how can improve the attribute scores??? maybe the data is not good ,because the attribute label only [-1,0,1] . i use all the data(include the scores is 0.00) , can you give me some advise to improve the attribute scores ?thanks !

- "The supplemental material provides additional details about
dataset collection and statistics of the resulting data" where is the  supplemental material ? i want to read more.
can you add readme how to use the caffeCustom,  the env require and step ? thanks

- in this picture , the (b)and(c)net are one of branch for(a); it is (b)and(c) net also input ranks pair of image?
- another question is  how the feature fusion ? and only concated? 
- and the attribute net how we get the attribute score? from the picture only get attr_feat ,and last get total scores , calcuate the total scores loss?

@aimerykong  thanks!

　　How to get ｔｈｅ  large AADB dataset  (datasetImages.zip, 2.0GB)?　Can you give me a link？　Ｔｈｘ
Hi, thank you so much for sharing your data and code! I wonder how you get the Cont_fea1 to Cont_feaN. Do you pretrain the Cont_fea layers on category-specific subset? It will be great if you can help me, thank you a lot.
Hi, sir, what's the meaning of negative value in imgList*.txt?   such as imgListTrainRegression_ColorHarmony.txt, farm1_429_20164497916_612b5cce64_b.jpg -0.400. Thank you.
Hi,
Thank you very much for sharing your code. One thing that puzzles me is that the code dose not provide the image list used in "mergedNetRank.prototxt". I wonder how you select pairs of images. I also read your paper, I noticed that you investigated two strategies for selecting pairs of images used in computing the ranking loss. One way is to select pairs of images with a relatively large difference in their average aesthetic scores. The other way is sample image pairs that have been scored by the same individual. I want to know how this relatively large difference is defined, whether there is a need to set a specific threshold for the difference in aesthetic scores, and how many pairs of images you used for train.
I am very looking forward to your help.
Best wishes!

Hi,thank you very much for your code, I have learned a lot from it.  I have a small problem which is not very clear, I hope you can take the time to help me out.  I visualize the trained caffemodel, and  I found that the num_input of the conv2 is 48, while the num_output of cov1 is 96. What makes it happen? It will be great if you can help me ,thank you!
