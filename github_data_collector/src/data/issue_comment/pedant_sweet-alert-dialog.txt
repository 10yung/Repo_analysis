I am can't to use "\n" or "\r" or "\n\r" in `setContentText(tariffDescription)`.
`description = String.format("%s%n%s", "Name: " +  name + "\r\n", "Cost: " + amount);`

I have tried a lot of variations, but all of them are not working.
I cannot find such interface, the use case scenario is as below:
- I want to ask user to input their email
- They can input and then confirm
- The input will be processed in a handler
Every time it's just crash my App.
I'm using **"implementation 'com.github.f0ris.sweetalert:library:1.5.6**"
A success message：

new SweetAlertDialog(this, SweetAlertDialog.SUCCESS_TYPE)
    .setTitleText("Good job!")
    .setContentText("You clicked the button!")
    .show();

how to change the colour of blue “ok”  button in this case？
This fixes the padding issues faced by some on the edges where there is not enough padding
new SweetAlertDialog(this, SweetAlertDialog.WARNING_TYPE)
                .setTitleText("Are you sure?")
                .setContentText("Won't be able to recover this file!")
                .setConfirmText("Yes,delete it!")
                .show();
初始化时候报错
Please rename attribute pivotX and pivotY, it's make conflict with androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.0.0xx

Text of the content is not showing as the string is. It will cut some text from the end. I have tested on moto g6 play and one plus five.

The original string is : "Thank you for posting your load.\nPlease be on the standby for transports associate bid." I have declared string in string.xml file.
