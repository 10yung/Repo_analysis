This PR contains the following updates:

| Package | Type | Update | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| [ora](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/ora) | dependencies | major | [`^3.0.0` -> `^4.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/ora/3.4.0/4.0.1) |

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>sindresorhus/ora</summary>

### [`v4.0.1`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/ora/releases/v4.0.1)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/ora/compare/v4.0.0...v4.0.1)

-   Set the correct interval when changing spinner by name ([#&#8203;128](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/ora/issues/128))  [`4a8cd09`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/ora/commit/4a8cd09)

### [`v4.0.0`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/ora/releases/v4.0.0)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/ora/compare/v3.4.0...v4.0.0)

##### Breaking

-   Require Node.js 8  [`6459090`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/ora/commit/6459090)
-   Discard stdin by default ([#&#8203;112](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/ora/issues/112))  [`b1f140b`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/ora/commit/b1f140b)
    		This prevents the spinner from twitching on input, outputting broken lines on <kbd>Enter</kbd> key presses, and prevents buffering of input while the spinner is running.

##### Breaking for TypeScript users

-   Only use a CommonJS export for the TypeScript definition
    		You need to change `import ora from 'ora';` to `import ora = require('ora');`

##### Fixes

-   Set the correct interval when changing spinner ([#&#8203;125](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/ora/issues/125))  [`ad324dc`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/ora/commit/ad324dc)
-   Hide `prefixText` when it's an empty string ([#&#8203;124](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/ora/issues/124))  [`8bcde17`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/ora/commit/8bcde17)
-   Fix Typescript definition for the `frame` method ([#&#8203;126](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/ora/issues/126))  [`b653b5a`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/ora/commit/b653b5a)

<!-- Please, enter a clear and meaningful title for your feature request. Thanks! -->

## Description
<!-- Give at least some information about the need and value of this request -->
With the new release of Apollo Federation (https://blog.apollographql.com/apollo-federation-f260cf525d21), new keywords and directives can be used in the graphql schema declaration.

More information on all that Apollo Federation allows can be read in their official documentation (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/introduction/)

Out team has managed to figure out a workaround for generating resolvers with the @key directive added to the schema, but at the moment, graphqlgen cannot generate resolvers for types that use the extend keyword.

A typical error that is generated when trying to run graphqlgen with a type that uses the extend keyword would look like the following.

"Error occurred while reading schema: Error: Field company: Couldn't find type <MyType> in any of the schemas."

This feature request aims to include Apollo Federation support with regards to generating resolvers.

Please check the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@&#8203;ehmicky/execa-v2-20ffafeedfdf) about this release!

#### Breaking changes

-   Drop support for Node.js 6 ([dce22670](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/commit/dce226705cab370c828e99cbd6de5439c4c5c60f), [#&#8203;221](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/221))
-   Remove `execa.shell()` and `execa.shellSync()`. The [`shell` option](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#shell) should be used instead. ([#&#8203;219](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/219))
-   Remove `execa.stdout()` and `execa.stderr()`. [`childProcessResult.stdout`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#stdout) and [`childProcessResult.stderr`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#stderr) should be used instead ([#&#8203;234](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/234))
-   Remove `error.code` (`number` or `string`) in favor of [`error.exitCode`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#exitcode) (`number`) and [`error.exitCodeName`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#exitcodename) (`string`) ([#&#8203;187](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/187), [#&#8203;250](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/250))
-   Rename `stripeEof` option to [`stripFinalNewline`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#stripfinalnewline) ([f8397ba9](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/commit/f8397ba9504b5fbba6cb6275b617fc5da6ced199), [4d0dc88a](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/commit/4d0dc88ae9d4870976050c60a53f8fefcfca922c), [#&#8203;238](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/238))
-   Rename `cmd` (in `childProcessResult` and `error`) to [`command`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#command) ([#&#8203;194](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/194))
-   Default [`preferLocal` option](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#preferlocal) to `false`. If you are executing locally installed binaries, you'll need to manually specify `preferLocal: true` ([#&#8203;314](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/314))
-   Ensure [`windowsHide` option](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) is always `true`, so that no window pops up on Windows. ([8c886452](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/commit/8c886452d4d69c4d020db1561b97335f37e999d7))
-   [`error.signal`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#signal) is now `undefined` instead of `null` when no signal was used ([#&#8203;193](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/193))
-   Set [`error.killed`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#killed) to `false` when child process timed out ([#&#8203;227](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/227))
-   Make [`error.killed`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#killed) always boolean (not `undefined`) ([#&#8203;229](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/229), [#&#8203;248](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/248))
-   Ensure errors always have the same shape. ([#&#8203;276](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/276), [#&#8203;277](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/277), [#&#8203;283](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/283))
-   [`error.stdout`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#stdout) and [`error.stderr`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#stderr) are now an empty string (instead of `null`) when the command failed. ([#&#8203;246](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/246))

#### Features

-   Add TypeScript definition ([#&#8203;188](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/188), [f2cb86ff](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/commit/f2cb86ff79657e5493f52f4a4b460d20a57fe1c5), [7702b8ef](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/commit/7702b8ef3f2f30dd3fbd281ae19a6f69c6ac4f95), [4692dcd4](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/commit/4692dcd4cec9097ded284ed6f9a71666bd560564), [#&#8203;251](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/251))
-   Add [`execa.command()`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#execacommandcommand-options) and [`execa.commandSync()`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#execacommandsynccommand-options). Those are the same as [`execa()`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#execafile-arguments-options) except both file and arguments are specified in a single string. For example, `execa('echo', ['unicorns'])` is the same as `execa.command('echo unicorns')` ([#&#8203;182](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/182), [#&#8203;261](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/261), [#&#8203;262](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/262), [#&#8203;278](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/278), [#&#8203;279](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/279), [#&#8203;282](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/282))

-   Add [`execa.node()`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#execanodescriptpath-arguments-options) which (like [`child_process.fork()`](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options)) allows you to execute a Node.js script as a child process ([#&#8203;200](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/200), [#&#8203;297](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/297), [#&#8203;299](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/299), [#&#8203;302](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/302), [#&#8203;303](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/303), [#&#8203;305](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/305), [#&#8203;306](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/306)). 
-   If [`childProcess.kill()`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#killsignal-options) does not terminate a child process after 5 seconds, force it by sending `SIGKILL`. This can be configured using the [`forceKillAfterTimeout` option](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#optionsforcekillaftertimeout). ([#&#8203;208](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/208), [#&#8203;272](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/272), [#&#8203;273](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/273), [#&#8203;280](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/280), [#&#8203;284](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/284), [#&#8203;285](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/285))
-   Add [`childProcess.cancel()`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#cancel) and [`error.isCanceled`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#iscanceled) ([#&#8203;189](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/189), [f24e7c72](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/commit/f24e7c7237de2c06f19903eecf3f04f0785c29d1), [#&#8203;226](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/226), [#&#8203;309](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/309))
-   [`error.stdout`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#stdout), [`error.stderr`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#stderr) and [`error.all`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#all) now contain the data that was sent before the child process exit. ([#&#8203;271](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/271)) 
-   Improve [`error.message`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#childprocessresult) on child process failure ([#&#8203;180](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/180), [#&#8203;223](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/223), [#&#8203;230](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/230), [#&#8203;245](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/245), [#&#8203;269](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/269))
-   Add `.finally()` to the [child process promise](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#childprocessresult) ([#&#8203;174](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/174), [65139849](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/commit/651398491b888bf5a51022aa3859152aacb4f796))
-   Increase [`maxBuffer`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#maxbuffer) option default value from `10 MB` to `100 MB` ([#&#8203;286](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/286))

#### Bug fixes

-   Fix [`maxBuffer`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#maxbuffer) errors not using the same shape as the other errors ([#&#8203;266](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/266))
-   Fix [`extendEnd` option](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#extendenv) not working with [`shell` option](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#shell) ([#&#8203;184](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/184))
-   Fix [`stripFinalNewline` option](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa#stripfinalnewline) not applied on error properties ([#&#8203;240](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/240))
