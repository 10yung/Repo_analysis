Hello, thank you for the convenient tool. 
Is it possible to do preprocessing like change brightness and contrast for video stream before doing detections? Will it help to improve the quality of detections? Can you give advice about how can I do this, and debug it?

Thank you for your help.


@WebDevSimplified pls help me with video based face recognition while using in nodejs.
UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: TypeError: Only absolute URLs are supported
 const img = await faceapi.fetchImage(`./labeled_images/${label}/${i}.jpg`)
The `README.md` states that 
  > JavaScript face recognition API for the browser and nodejs implemented on top of tensorflow.js core (tensorflow/tfjs-core)

which then links to the recently depricated https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-core. Is it still based on this version or the [new tfjs](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs)? I've seen some issues where @justadudewhohacks references tfjs-core version 1.4 but I'm not sure. 
Hello,

Your projects are really awesome! I read Readme file and it says you used a custom dataset of ~14K images labeled with bounding boxes to train tiny yolo model. Would you mind sharing the dataset? So I can train my own model on it. 

Thanks!

Hello,

My project has a special requirement which needs to know the total size of head(face + hair). Does face-api.js have the plan to provide head position? 

Thanks!
It's possible to make a login form using face detection?
===========================
ERROR in node_modules/face-api.js/build/commonjs/NeuralNetwork.d.ts:8:9 - error TS1086: An accessor cannot be declared in an ambient context.

==========================
I have installed face-api as **npm i face-api.js**
Version of Typescript- "typescript": "~3.5.3" for Angular/cli latest version  is **"@angular/cli": "~8.3.22",**

I have added one line in the component.ts

import * as faceapi from 'face-api.js';

Thanks a lot and best wishes..
