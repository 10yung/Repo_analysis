Hi, did any body get a chance to find a tutorial on how to use this gem on Mac ? I have been playing around with it, but do not seem to get anywhere. I am at stage zero after installing the gem. I found a few articles where people seem to have figured out how to use it, but I am not that advanced on rails yet. Would appreciate some help . Where to put the class myRecommander <recommendify::base? Where to add the recommender = Myrecommender.ner? where to add the set creation please?
Thank you
I don't understand how cosine works. It looks like it does not implement the correct functions.



```
  input_matrix :thing_other,
#    :native => true,
    :similarity_func => :cosine
```

```
recommender.thing_other.process!
Traceback (most recent call last):
        1: from (irb):13
RuntimeError (implemented in subclass)
```

Looking at the code, it looks like there are unimplemented methods on the class. Is this expected? 
Creating an input matrix (jaccard) with a redis db other than 0 results in the correct items and ccmatrix being created as data is added, but empty similarities values when process! is called. This appears to be because the db is not taken into account by the native recommendify command. AFAICT it never gets passed to it.

There's too many people running their own forks

In the method #serialize_item in similarity_matrix.rb, I found there could be a bug when converting similarity metrics into a string. the original code is like this

def serialize_item(item_id, max_precision=5)
    items = @write_queue[item_id].to_a
    items.sort!{ |a,b| b[1] <=> a[1] }
    items = items[0..max_neighbors-1]
    items = items.map{ |i,s| s>0 ? "#{i}:#{s.to_s[0..max_precision]}" : nil } 
    items.compact \* "|"
  end

the issue is at statement "s.to_s[0..max_precision]". For some cases, the value of s could be a fairly small floating point number. when converting it to string, Ruby will use scientific notation as the result of s.to_s. For example,

"8.442380751371887e-05"

After executing "s.to_s[0..max_precision]", given max_precision=5, the return string will become "8.4423", which causes the similarity result being enlarged incorrectly. 

I would suggest to change "s.to_s[0..max_precision]" to

"sprint('%.#{max_precision}f", s)"

with sprintf, the above example will output "0.00008".

it is an edge case, there could be other better solution to it. but just want to share my findings on this issue. 

Thank you very much for the great gem!

Just wondering if there could be any more instructions on how to get started? Would be very helpful for ruby newbies like me.

Once you build the Recommendify gem, where do you go from there? Do you have to write a new model, like in the example? 

Trying to copy that code into a model file gives the error "uninitialized constant Recommendify" - does not recognize it as a gem/module. Tips? Thanks! (p.s. running recommendify 0.2.3 on windows)

[Fixes #8]

Right now if you're trying to work from a Redis database other than 0, you must use the Ruby similarity implementation, because the database info does not get passed to the C extension.

When using multiple recommenders in a script, eg for cross validation,
the redis_prefix was the same for input matrices of all recommenders.
What's more, all recommenders had access to all input matrices of all
other recommenders.
This patch fixes these problems and enables testing 2 different
recommenders in a script to see if their difference of performance is
statistically significant.

Tests really pass now
