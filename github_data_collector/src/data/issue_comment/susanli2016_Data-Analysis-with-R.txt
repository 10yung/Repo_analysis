Hi! I'm working through your text analytics code with my own data set (One focused on social reviews from multiple sites for a specific brand). But I keep getting an error when trying to create the slopes that you use to map out the trend in word usage. 

This is the code:

` slopes <- word_month_counts %>%
  nest(-word) %>%
  mutate(model = map(data, mod)) %>%
  unnest(map (model, tidy)) %>%
  filter(term == "year") %>%
  arrange(desc(estimate))`

And this is the error I'm getting:

Error in map(model, tidy) : object 'model' not found
In addition: Warning message:
All elements of `...` must be named.
Did you want `data = c(month, n, month_total, percent, year)`? 

Any idea on what may be going on? I could share more information if this isn't enough. Everything prior to this point has worked, although I've had to replace some minor terms such as column names
