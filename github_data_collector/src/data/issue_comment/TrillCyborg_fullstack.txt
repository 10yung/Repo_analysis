> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

update code
Which big cow told me how to install and run? Thank you!
Web newbie here.
I was trying to `yarn lint` in /client but ran into errors and got it fixed.
Perhaps there could be some intro for this by referring to [this setup](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/)?
Also there are plenty errors after running it, should they get fixed?
I'd like to help on above, but please kindly suggest a way that I could do it and contribute. :)
Hey this is a really cool app that I guess a lot of people (incl me) would learn from.

Would be nice if there is some slightly more detailed documentation on how to forge this app.

Cheers
Hey ðŸ‘‹ 
this PR adds support for Gitpod, a free online dev environment that we'e built to simplify contributions and generally working on GitHub projects. It allows anyone to get a ready-to-code dev environment for any branch, issue and pull request with a single click (resp. by prefixing the GitHub URL with `gitpod.io/#`).

<img width="1765" alt="Screenshot 2019-06-20 at 15 55 17" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/372735/59854868-02902000-9374-11e9-9971-c28f7df2369f.png">

You can try it out on my branch

https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/svenefftinge/fullstack

The workspace is configured so that four processes are started automatically in distinct terminals
 - mongodb
 - server
 - client (`yarn gen:types:watch`)
 - client (`yarn start`)

I also made it open the website in the preview automatically once it gets served. You can reach the graphql interface (port 4000) as well. See the `Open Ports` tab on the bottom.

Also, I made it open the `development.env.json` on startup and update the server URL so that people see they have to insert more tokens.

It seems to work well, but of course you might have better ideas how a perfect dev environment for fullstack should look like. Let me know whether you like it and how I should improve further. Also, I'm happy to support this in future, too.

P.S.: Gitpod unleashed its full potential when you install the [GitHub app](https://github.com/marketplace/gitpod-io). It will prebuild all branches (incl. PRs) so when you open a workspace you don't have to wait for the build. The app is also capable of adding buttons to issues. For instance, you can configure it to add a button to all `first timer welcome` issues. I made my fork use a prebuild, which is why the yarn install has already happened when you open it. Without prebuilds the `init` part in tasks will be executed everytime.
how can make the run client Err? 
Module not found: Can't resolve '../config/development.env.json' in 
Make `result` is an array and skip duplicate code
What will you recommend?

Replace all exist mongo codes with dynamodb client sdk or write a seperate dynamodb lib and freely switch with configuration between mongodb and dynamodb?
