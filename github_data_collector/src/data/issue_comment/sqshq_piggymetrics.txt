enhance the mongodb persist oauth2 token store
Actually, client details and tokens are stored in memory. Naturally this is not the best as it creates a strong coupling between the service and the data it manages.

Hence, I made this pull request to manage the authentication data on a separate container. I also shared the image on a docker repo (feel free to use your own repo if you prefer).

At your disposition for further information and/or discussion :)
