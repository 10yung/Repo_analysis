MVP for Windows host support. Works with Docker Toolbox (via VirtualBox) on Windows 10 Home. Untested with modern Docker for Windows (requires Windows 10 Pro and/or Insider Preview).
All tests are passing, both in Windows host (`cargo test`) and inside Linux guest (`cargo run -- test`), but otherwise this PR is a draft, not suitable for production.
It works for my workflow, but didn't touch anything related to mounting (but tests are passing, so idk) and remote caching.

**Status:** Sanity check required

**Fixes:** #262 

**Description**

It would be great to be able to invalidate the local cache starting from a specific task, and all tasks that depend on it. i.e. I have several build toast files and would like to be able to invalidate from cloning the repository on, but don't really want to invalidate things like installing deps, setup, etc. cloning tasks naturally don't invalidate themselves because the command is the exact same, even if commits have been happening on the remote repo.

**Alternatives considered**

A YAML key like,

```yaml
local_cache_valid_if: |
   cmds_that_return 0
   for_cache_is_valid
   or_return_1 if_invalid_cache
```

Also, the current using `--read-local-cache false` which invalidates everything but is less than desirable. 

**Additional context**

None
**Description**
A clear description of what you want to happen.
One of the benefits of containerization of dev envs is being able to run them in a platform agnostic way, so it'd be cool if toast could run on Windows
