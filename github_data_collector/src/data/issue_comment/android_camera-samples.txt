I was trying to use cameraxbasic app on Camera HARDWARE_LEVEL_LEGACY phones so the preview size for imageAnalysis was low resolution so i manually calculated size myself by scalerstreamconfiguration map and preview size closest to screen resolution .
Suppose i chose the preview size on Xolo Era phone and it was 960 : 540.

I gave this size to preview and imageAnalyzer method through setTargetResolution function .
And it was selecting something like 864 : 480.

I want to choose a high preview size for imageAnalyzer like 1280: 720 .

When CameraXBasic is uninstalled, any photos taken with it are deleted. I realise this is due to MainActivity.getOutputDirectory() choosing an application-specific directory. I assume this was also done as a workaround for Android 10's scoped storage, but for a camera app example I feel this isn't really appropriate - anyone following this to write a CameraX application may not realise they're creating a camera application that deletes a user's photos when uninstalled, which could be disastrous!

More generally, given Google's push to move us to non-File APIs, it seems inconsistent and mixed messaging not to be showcasing Google's best practices for saving files on Android 10 with scoped storage.

The camera sample should show the correct best practice for saving a photo (which Google documents as using MediaStore API, although as far as I can tell documentation for how to do that seems lacking, so having this shown in the camera sample would be all the more valuable please).

Looking at other samples' source code, it seems this issue may apply to them too (e.g., Camera2BasicJava), but I've only tested CameraXBasic on my device (Galaxy S10e, Android 10).

Thanks!

CameraXBasic app updated to work with version `1.0.0-alpha08`.
Use cases are working and it doesn't crash. Also filed one issue:

Closes #131. 
The preview becomes very slow after using Image Analysis, the preview returns to normal after being removed

I installed the Camera2SlowMotion sample in Redmi Note 7 Pro and opened to see a white screen with list of available camera configs and chose one, and then the screen turned complete black and nothing happens then after.

Apart from this I also combined this code with some code from Camera2VideoKotlin and it worked just well for many of the devices. I could very well record slow motion videos with 120 and above fps. But again, when I install the app in Redmi note 7 pro. The app closes at preview. Neither I see any crash log in the logcat nor I am able to catch the crash in a try...catch. It seems to be something non-fatal. But at the end, I am clueless on what is happening here, my observation so far is that it crashes somewhere after I do `setRepeatingBurst`. Please help.

Hi friends, 
I have 2 Android PDA (android 6.0). The one has a camera 5MP and the other one have a camera 8MP.
My application use Camera API v2 to take a picture. So I'm facing an issue that Camera Preview of 5MP phone is
brighter than the 8MP phone. I expected that 8MP one is brighter than the 5MP one. I have 2 questions:
1/ is Camera Api v2 incompatible with the camera 8MP module? Quality of camera 8MP is bad
2/ if the root cause is that Camera API v2 is incompatible, so is there any workaround? 
any advice and suggestions will be greatly appreciated

I'm getting this crash in CameraXBasic. Scenario when this crash occurred:
First take the picture --> route to gallery --> delete it --> now route to gallery again --> **CRASH**
Confirm delete prompt shown in CameraXBasic even when no photo available. #117 Done
