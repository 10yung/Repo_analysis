I was trying to utilize a different kernel  to the linear kernel and as a result was trying to create the MEX file for the libsvmpredict.c function. When I ran the code for creating the mex file from the libsvm_compile.m file, I encountered the following error:

I'm using a 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04 system. Can some one tell me why this error has come up?
After compiling, I am unable to successfully run the demo. Here is what I have:

```
>> esvm_compile

```
I have also seen [this step by step tutorial][1]. The same error is received after running this line `esvm_apply_and_show_exemplars(I1, models, M, params);` from that tutorial.

How to resolve this problem?

Hi quantombone,

I'm courrently working with your framework. I have longer training times than in your examples, because I changed the features (to CN-HOG features). To make the training faster I would like to limit the maximum number of trained exemplars - which is possible by setting "stream_params.stream_max_ex" (for example to 100). But if I do this, the framework takes only the first 100 images and initializes 100 exemplars on this basis - now my question: Is it possible to tell the framework to select the 100 images per random out of the trainings images? In my case this is important, because my example images have filenames with a specific structure, so that images with similar names are more likely to each other...

Thank's a lot and kind regards,
Florian 
Hello, I would like to use the part based deformable  HOG features for my project. As my project is in c++, I want the corresponding C/C++ codes, you have in the folder named as "feature".

I would highly appreciate, if you can give me these corresponding C++ codes. 
The codes available in this particular folder are .mex files and they can't be used from my xcode project in Mac.

Hi

I have been trying to replace HOG with HMAX features in the ESVM framework.
When I do the training with HMAX features I get the following error
"ERROR: number of negative support vectors is 0!
Something went wrong"

Can you explain what might be the cause for this error?

Thanks

1. Fixed BUG, that caused looping over all dataset every time we applied SVM to an image during mining of negatives. 
   Running time improved from quadratic to linear.
2. Optimized  method for ipdating mining queue _update_mq_onepass_. 
   No need to loop through all the queue two times to find elements to delete, because in 'onepass' mode we loop images iteratively one-by-one. 

Hi quantombone,

Is parameter "default_params.calibration_propagate_onto_raw = 0;"  the switch of co-occurrence?

Hi quantombone,
in the E-SVM paper you said that you annotated all the bus class of Pascal VOC 2007 with segmentation masks and geometry structures. Are those annotations available somewhere? I could really use them for some experiments in my Master's Thesis.
Thank you very much.

Hi, 
I was trying to replace HoG features with dense SIFT features.
However, I found esvm_detect.m will change feature dimension especially for HoG. 
Simply replacing model.x with SIFT feature will not work. 
Is there any suggestion helping me develop the codes (replace HoG with other features)?
Thanks.

in line 291 of esvm_detect pyrN = cellfun...  is calculated for the number of HOGS that fit inside each level of the pyramid.
however, the prod of a negative size will be positive, which leads to zeros at the end of the matrix X.  Later, offsets(2,bb) is referenced, which may be out of range since size(offsets,2) < size(X,2).

instead of : 
pyr_N = cellfun(@(x)prod([size(x,1) size(x,2)] -S+1),t.hog);
it should be:
pyr_N = cellfun(@(x)prod(max(0,[size(x,1) size(x,2)] -S+1)),t.hog);
