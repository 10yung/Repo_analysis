I am currently using `Faker().internet.safeEmail()`, and it's producing invalid results. Right now, I have an email address of `@example.com` returned from that method, so something is going awry. 

I've seen similar when using the plain `Faker().internet.email()` method, except in that case it was missing everything after the `@`. 

I'm using Xcode 11.2b1 (although this happens under 11.0 and 11.1 GM as well).
When I try to install Fakery using Xcode 11 SPM it throws an error when trying to clone Nimble

Is there something we could do or we just have to wait for Nimble to get fixed?
I am working with Server Side Swift and want to use Fakery for testing. But no matter what locale I use, I keep getting a `JSON file for 'de' locale was not found.` error.
I installed Fakery via the Swift Package Manager using the Package.swift file.

>The swift_version DSL that was first introduced in CocoaPods 1.4.0 has now been expanded to support multiple Swift versions. This helps pod authors and gives consumers more flexibility when it comes to choosing which version of Swift to use when consuming a pod.
The current structure (a single `en.json` file) makes it difficult to contribute to this repository.

Hi,

first of all thanks for this library! 

I'd like to report an issue: postcode generation is not returning proper values. I'm using the `faker.address.postcode()` method in order to generate random postcode, but this is what i get as a result `/[A-PR-UWYZ][A-HK-Y]I[0-9][ABEHMNPRVWXY0-9]X [0-9][ABD-HJLN-UW-Z]{2}/` 

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Best,
Tib
It would be really nice to have a feature to setup Fakery with a seed to guarantee the generation of same data on every reseed with same value.

In case of data generation for Unit-Tests or UI-Tests this would be a really helpful feature to avoid the usage of static string literals inside the tests.

Are there any plans to add new features?
When I try to generate a first name using the 'ru' localization I receive first names for the 'en' localization.
When I  use tr-TR localization for generating first name I get error 
> JSON file for 'tr-TR' locale was not found.

I use version 3.4.0
Hi

The default random image provider, LoremPixel, is currently unavailable (500 response). 
Could you consider to switch to another random image provider? 

Thanks
