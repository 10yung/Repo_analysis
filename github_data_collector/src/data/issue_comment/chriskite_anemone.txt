With this new release we would have the ability to use Proxy with authentication
Support Phantomjs
The parameter is called `ignore_www_subdomain`

I'm using Anemone. It's excelletnt!!
But Garbled characters occur, if the page's  charset is not UTF-8 or US-ASCII.
So I want to support other charsets.

For site-specific crawlers, it's fair enough to use `focus_crawl` like this:

```
anemone.focus_crawl do |page|
  if page.doc
    page.doc.search('.//a[@href]').map { |a| URI.parse(a[:href]) }
  else
    page.links
  end
end
```

However when using the `discard_page_bodies` option, `page.doc` is `nil` by the time we enter this block. In this pull request I've moved until after `focus_crawl` has been called.


Also, add this model anemone_page.rb in your app

``` ruby
class AnemonePage
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :url
    field :headers, type: Moped::BSON::Binary
    field :data, type: Moped::BSON::Binary
    field :body, type: Moped::BSON::Binary
    field :links, type: Array
    field :code, type: Integer
    field :visited, type: Boolean
    field :depth, type: Integer
    field :referer
    field :redirect_to
    field :response_time, type: Integer
    field :fetched, type: Boolean

    index({:url => 1}, {:unique => true})
end
```

1. improve Redis storage engine performance
2. added expiration to Redis page storage
3. added stop crawl functionality
4. improved RAM usage (page queue got filled up too quickly)
