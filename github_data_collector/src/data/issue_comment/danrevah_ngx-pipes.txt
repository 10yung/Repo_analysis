Please add a filterByNot pipe or add possibility to reverse value e.g. '!null' means "not null"
Added new pipe `timeRemaining`. This pipe transforms numeric seconds between `0` and `86399` to a string in format `HH:mm:ss`. This can be useful for displaying countdown timers in a friendly way. While this limited to 24h at most currently, will hopefully look to enhance in the near future to support additional formats and extended time ranges.
**Description of the pipe**

I needed a pipe that capitalizes the first word in a title and lowercase the rest of the title words for paragraphs of articles in my website.

There is ucwords that supports titles, it capitalizes every word in a title. But certain small paragraphs you want to only capitalize the first letter of a paragraph, and lower case the rest of its words.

As I tried to run the tests the first time, it failed because I have no chrome installed. With puppeteer the developer doesn't need chrome installed on his/her machine.
I am using ngx-pipes v2.5.6 for my angular8 project.

compare timeAgo pipe and date pipe in angular:
When i suscribe the date from server to UI.  I pass the date (in Json) to timeAgo pipe, it will output a invalid time.  So, i should transform all date in Json to date type first.
However, the date pipe in angular , it still works if i pass the date in Json.

So , Is it possible to judge the value type which pass in pipe first?
If it is a string and can be tranform into date type by new Date(), transform first and output it. 
If it is in Date, output it directly.

Add support for pipe date medium as angular
I have an object like this:

```

    "data": {
        "cart": {
            "id": "d754932d-45e2-448f-baeb-b457aafd5ee3-47751",

                        {
                            "id": "48",
                            "title": "Flingor & Musli"
                        },
                        {

                },
                {
                    "id": 956106,
                    "categoryPaths": [
                        {
                            "id": "6",
                            "title": "Skafferi"
                        },
                        {
                            "id": "47",
                            "title": "Bönor, Linser & Fröer"
                        },
                        {
                            "id": "269",
                            "title": "Bönor"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "id": 956107,
                    "categoryPaths": [
                        {
                            "id": "6",
                            "title": "Skafferi"
                        },
                        {
                            "id": "47",
                            "title": "Bönor, Linser & Fröer"
                        },
                        {
                            "id": "269",
                            "title": "Bönor"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Then mapping orderItems to cart.items.. all works fine.. then I do

```
<div *ngFor="let item of (cart.items | groupBy: 'categoryPaths.id' | pairs); trackBy: trackCartItem">{{item | json}}<div>
```

Now I was kind of hoping for some grouping magic but my object now looks more or less like this:

```
[
 "undefined",
 [
  {
    "externalId": "5053827193818",
    "title": "Special K Classic",
    "categoryPaths": [
      {
        "id": "6",
        "title": "Skafferi"
      },
      {
        "id": "48",
        "title": "Flingor &amp; Musli"
      },
      {
        "id": "331",
        "title": "Flingor"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "externalId": "7350002402979",
    "title": "Svarta Bönor Ekologiska",
    "categoryPaths": [
      {
        "id": "6",
        "title": "Skafferi"
      },
      {
        "id": "47",
        "title": "Bönor, Linser &amp; Fröer"
      },
      {
        "id": "269",
        "title": "Bönor"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "externalId": "7350002402948",
    "title": "Kidneybönor Ekologiska",
    "categoryPaths": [
      {
        "id": "6",
        "title": "Skafferi"
      },
      {
        "id": "47",
        "title": "Bönor, Linser &amp; Fröer"
      },
      {
        "id": "269",
        "title": "Bönor"
      }
    ]
  }
 ]
]
```

What am I missing?


Note: This does what I expect (prints the tilte)...
but if I add `| groupBy: 'categoryPaths.id' | keyvalue` it behaves strange :)

```
      <div *ngFor="let item of cart.items; trackBy: trackCartItem">
        <div class="category" fxLayour="row" fxLayoutAlign="start center">
          <div class="title">{{ item.title }}</div>
        </div>
      </div>
```
