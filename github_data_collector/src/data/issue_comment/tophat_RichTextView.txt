If I have a `RichTextView` filling the width of the screen and a multiline LaTeX string with multiple math equations, and I want to center-align all the text in the `RichTextView`, how would I do that? I can't find a `textAlignment` property on the text view, and none of the LaTeX commands that I've tried using to center the text have worked so far. Short of creating a new text view for each line and centering each one, is there some way to center the text that I'm missing?

```swift
private enum Text {
        static let tableHTML = """
        <p><img style="max-width: 100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tophat/RichTextView/master/.github/assets/RichTextView.png"></p><p><img style="max-width: 50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tophat/RichTextView/master/.github/assets/RichTextView.png"></p>
        """
    }
```

## Description
Down has recently updated to use AST parsing to generate an `NSAttributedString` from HTML instead of the usual `NSAttributedString` way of doing it. However, this has broken some tests and functionality in this library. The purpose of this ticket is to update to the latest `Down` library and fix anything that's broken.
