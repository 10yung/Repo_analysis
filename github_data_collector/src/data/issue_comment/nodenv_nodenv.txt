Many of the nodenv plugins and repos require similar test setup and helpers. This issue will document the needs of each plugin so that we can unify somehow.

- nodenv
- node-build
- nodenv-installer
- nodenv-env
- nodenv-aliases
- nodenv-default-packages
    - bats-assert/bats-mock
    - resets nodenv_* vars
    - PATH= test/bin, plugin/bin, node_modules/bin, batsmock/bin
    - test-specific mktemp with NODENV_ROOT
    - NODENV_HOOK_PATH = source etc/
    - teardown removes tmpdir
    - custom nodenv-install fake to install nodes and trigger hooks
    - helper to create default-packages file in nodenv_root
- nodenv-package-json-engine
- nodenv-package-rehash
- nodenv-npm-migrate
- nodenv-vars
- nodenv-man
- nodenv-each
- nodenv-update
- node-build-update-defs
- node-build-prerelease
- node-build-jxcore
- jetbrains-npm
- homebrew-nodenv
In combination with https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv-aliases/pull/25, this PR should allow for the ability to make and view aliases in the form of `lts/*`. This should increase the compatibility of auto-switching to `nvm`-style versions (e.g. `lts/carbon`).
A few plugins that _may_ have some utility being ported to nodenv.
- [x] https://github.com/ianheggie/rbenv-env
  print env vars relevant to node/nodenv/npm
- [ ] https://github.com/tpope/rbenv-communal-gems
  share global modules across nodes
- [x] https://github.com/mlafeldt/rbenv-man
  man pages for active node, npm, etc version
- [ ] https://github.com/fgrehm/rbenv-install-remote
  install node using custom definition url (like a gist)
- [ ] https://github.com/toy/rbenv-update-rubies
  automatically install latest patch (maybe even minor?) versions of each currently installed node
- [ ] https://github.com/ianheggie/rbenv-binstubs
  make nodenv aware of local node_modules bins (would resolve #45 )
- [x] https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer
  includes an idempotent installer script, though -doctor is the more relevant one

Any votes on which, if any of these would be most useful for node? Or others?
