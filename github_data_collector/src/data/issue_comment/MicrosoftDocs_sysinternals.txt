Hi,

The client doesn't support some types of formatted queries.
Have tried the downloaded version 1.21:

```
$ .\whois.exe 62.46.172.92

Same with the 64 Bit edition, also with admin privileges.
No issues with the same query on my other used OS'es (Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD).

**Edit:**
Also when using the following command structure:
```
$ .\whois.exe "62.46.172.92"
```

(Tested on Windows 10 Pro Version 1909 - Build 18363.535)
link is down, archive version
1. New Server 2016 Install (No updates required)

2. Install Latest Sysmon with config:
`<Sysmon schemaversion="4.22">
	<HashAlgorithms>md5,sha256</HashAlgorithms>
	<CheckRevocation/>
	<EventFiltering>
	<RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
		<FileCreateStreamHash onmatch="include">
		</FileCreateStreamHash>
	</RuleGroup>
	</EventFiltering>
</Sysmon>`

3. Download Service Fabric Installation Package to 2016 (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=730690)

4. Execute ".\CreateServiceFabricCluster.ps1 -ClusterConfigFilePath .\ClusterConfig.Unsecure.DevCluster.json -AcceptEULA" from Downloaded Microsoft.Azure.ServiceFabric.WindowsServer.* directory

5. Wait approximately 5 minutes for c:\ProgramData\SF\ReplicatorLog\replicatorshared.log to be created and CPU will become exhausted.

Please let me know if it would be better to open a case with Microsoft Support, but I was unable to find an appropriate category to open it under.

The -q switch does not exist, and when used, strings returns the Usage/Help information rather than its normal operational output.
Removed reference to Windows IT Pro article as the link is dead.  Updated link to sysinternals forum to the new technet forum.
This flag was not documented on the page, even though the interactive prompt (which appears only for the first time using the tool) encourages the user to use it.

I am running 2x Xeon 8276L in my workstation and I have found that Task Manager is practically useless for understanding CPU usage on a per-process level when that process is only running a single-threaded load, because the usage percentage ends up being rounded to either 0 or 1 in the CPU column.

Process Explorer is marginally better in this regard because it provides precision up to two decimal places, but on a system with 112 logical cores it only shows around 0.89% usage for a single-core load, making it quite difficult to mentally quantify the values unless you can quickly multiply by 112 in your head (I, personally, cannot).

I would like the option to be able to switch the CPU Usage column to display 100% for a fully-utilised core, and numbers beyond 100% for multi-threaded loads, much like Linux has done traditionally with tools like `top`. Precision beyond an integer would not be required in this mode.

I have also toyed with the idea of requesting a "number of utilised cores" column, which would display the total number of logical processors upon which the process has been scheduled since the last refresh, but I am unsure if the requisite data is available from process information APIs and perfromance counters.

Thank you.
Running v2.02 and when cleaning with,

sdelete -c \<drive no\>

I get pass 0 at >100MB/s then pass 1 at less than half the speed. Help screen says default number of passes is 1.

Based on speed, seems like pass 0 is zeroing while pass 1 might be writing random data.

Specifying drive letter instead of drive number seems to do only one pass.

thx.
