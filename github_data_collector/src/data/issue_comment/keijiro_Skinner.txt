...or they will not work as expected.

Not sure if this is to be considered bug (and I can close issue if not), but if renderers are not at global 0, they will start count from their point of origin and rendering far off from skinned mesh. Spent 10 hours trying to figure what's going on, because I'm not very good at programming.

(moving guy's on the left trail is so far away I thought it's not drawing)

Ofc, it's all kinda OK but some warning or instruction could save a lot of nerve cells for some idiot like me.  =^_^=
We need them xD 

Also, thank you very much for this VFX marvel. Domo arigato =)
Hi, thanks for your great assets. 

I am having issues with shader drawing: sometimes, randomly, it disapears for no apparent reason and after appears again. It keeps drawing in scene window and shadows are also rendering in game window.

Do you know why it happens?

If I create in a new scene or in demo scene it works... Maybe it is some config that I haven't seen.

Thank you in advance
