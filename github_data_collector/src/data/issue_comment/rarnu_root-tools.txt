大佬一直更新为什么不发布啊？
什么时候发布新版啊？
Hi there, 

I'm hoping you'll consider adding a dark/black theme to help users who are accessing your app at night as well as battery life improvement for Amoled devices. 

Thanks again for your hard work.
Hi there, 

Would you consider supporting landscape mode for tablets? I tried to use Defim's OwnOrientation app on your tool, however it just closes when I do that. Even basic support, I don't care if it isn't pretty and have to scroll more, that's totally fine, thanks.

Appreciate your work so far, thanks very much, keep up the good work.
