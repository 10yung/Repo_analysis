Hi! As one of Andrew Ng's ML lecture learners, your repo is AWESOME 👍 
If there is a Korean translation, I think it could help a lot of students studying in Korea.
If you allow, may I translate this in Korean?
Changed 'If # of features is > 10,000 use Normal Equation' to 'If # of features is < 10,000 use Normal Equation'
Removed . from .- to remove error in matlab when running script as per pull request #10
Removed the . from the .- to get rid of error, checked against current Matlab operators here https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/matlab-operators-and-special-characters.html .- is not a listed operator. Might have been in the past.
Script runs now with no errors Matlab R2015b
Solution of the programming assignment on bias vs. variance
I think that, the mu and sigma values are feature specific, so for each feature we need to apply it's mu and sigma.


In linear regression 1 variable I have the following error

Error: File: computeCost.m Line: 21 Column: 22
Unexpected MATLAB operator.

Error in run (line 33)
computeCost(X, y, theta)

When I debug the following code 
for i = 1:numberOfTrainingExamples
    gradient = gradient + ( hypothesis(i) - y(i) ) \* X(i, :)';
end
it returns error in gradient wrong dimension. 
I figured an alternative by replace loop statement by
grad(1,1) = (1/m)_sum((h-y)._X(:,1)); 
grad(2:end,1)=((1/m)_((h-y)'_X(:,2:end)))'+ theta(2:end);

gradient has same dimensions as of theta
