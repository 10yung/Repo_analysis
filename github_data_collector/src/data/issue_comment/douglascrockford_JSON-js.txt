User-defined properties taking such names as toString, valueOf, etc. would be ignored by the for-in loop under IE6-8. This pull request is aimed to solve this issue.
The assumption is that people who wrote the toJSON() know what
they are doing, possibly adding/removing important information.
In any case, an object with a toJSON() function will not run
into the "converting circular structure" problem.

There is an error in line https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/json/json2.js#L174. It checks if Date.prototype.toJSON is function. If it doesn't it sets toJSON function not only for Date prototype but also for String, Number and Boolean prototypes. However if Date.prototype.toJSON is function what is true in Chrome browser it doesn't set toJSON functions for other objects. And those objects (String, Number, Boolean) doesn't have toJSON functions in Chrome. So they are never set.
