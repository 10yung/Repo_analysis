The fold transition doesn't take into account the iOS 11 safe area insets. Therefore, transitions fill the safe area during the animation followed by the view abruptly filling it's intended area at the transition's end.

@mpospese 膜拜大神！

I am trying to do a fold push but when the transition happends the inner part of the fold is white. The pushed view controller appears only when the transition ends.

Hi guys, 
Do you know how can I flip from top to bottom with this library ? Because the MPFlipStyle enum (inside the MPFlipEnumerations header) does not contains the value to do that:

```
enum {
    // current view folds away into center, next view slides in flat from top & bottom
    MPFlipStyleDefault              = 0,
    MPFlipStyleDirectionBackward    = 1 << 0,
    MPFlipStyleOrientationVertical  = 1 << 1,
    MPFlipStylePerspectiveReverse   = 1 << 2
};
typedef NSUInteger MPFlipStyle;
```

*Default and DirectionBackward is regarding the horizontal direction and the third one, MPFlipStyleOrientationVertical is for the vertical direction but it's from bottom to top. The last one is the perspective reverse which is not useful to me.

Thanks in advance,
Diego

Thanks for a great library.

I've just updated to iOS8 and I have a problem, though. On transitioning to a new view controller using `- (void)presentViewController:flipStyle:completion:`, I get a brief flash of the original view controller just following the transition. On transitioning back, the transition appears to complete in about 2 frames, so is barely noticeable.

I haven't yet tried investigating where this behaviour is coming from, but it was working beautifully on iOS7 ...

Hello,

first of all, thanks everybody involved in this projects. It is an awesome library.
I am trying to use it with different sized views (actually double height OR double width, for example 100x100 transition to 100x200). It should work like if you unfold a paper which is folded in the middle... ¿Does anybody know how can I do that? 
Of course I know a solution could be put the first view in a double sized container but I would prefer to not use that kind of tricky things.

Many thanks in advance, and sorry for my English.

How would I going about changing the skew of the transition.  For example lets say I placed two transitioning views side by side (like one of those old scoreboards flip scores), and wanted to have one flipping as if a little towards the left, and the other a little towards the right.

Also, sort of related ... if I wanted to create the effect of the view "swinging" and "bouncing" back into place, any way to customize the transition for this?  Imagine the new view would transition a bit past vertical, almost appearing to go backwards for a sec, and then transitioning back to being straight. Makes sense? 

Thanks for the great library!

I am using the flip to navigate through an array. when i reach the beginning / end of the array, is it possible to add a fake flip animation to indicate that there is no more page?

i.e. lift up the layer a bit and put it down

Thanks!

Simplified bitwise operations for added clarity and maintainability.

NSArray and NSNumber literals and boxed expressions make the code more readable and maintainable. Thank you for this great project!
