PointDirectionRight

**Situation**
The app is build as a Tabbed App, so it has an UITabBarController as root view controller.
Each Tab has it's own view controller.
On the 4th tab we have an UITableViewController with an UINavigationBar with left and right UIBarButtonItems.
We've created an IBOutlet `infoButton` and present the pop tip by calling `presentPointingAtBarButtonItem:animated:`:
```ObjC
[_poptipForManual presentPointingAtBarButtonItem:_infoButton
                                        animated:YES];
```

The pop tip is correctly shown:

However, when selecting another tab via the Tab Bar, the pop tip is still visible:

**Analysis**
Method `presentPointingAtBarButtonItem:animated:` determines the container view of the UIBarButtonItem and calls `presentPointingAtView:inView:animated:` with it.
The problem is it uses:
```ObjC
UIView *containerView = targetView.window;
```
Where the app **window** is returned. This is the reason why the pop tip is visible on **all** tabs in a Tabbed App.

**Solution**
The proper container view is the superview of the parent view of the UIBarButtonItem.
The (public) parent view of an UIBarButtonItem is one of:

- UINavigationBar
- UIToolbar
- UITabBar

So the first step is to search upwards in the view hierarchy to determine whether the Bar Button is located in a Navigation Bar, Tool Bar or Tab Bar.
When a Navigation Bar, Tool Bar or Tab Bar is found, return it's superview and abort the search.

When no Navigation Bar, Tool Bar or Tab Bar is found, the default strategy  is to use the app window (existing situation).

Here is my updated code for this method:
```ObjC
- (void)presentPointingAtBarButtonItem:(UIBarButtonItem *)barButtonItem animated:(BOOL)animated {
    UIView *targetView = (UIView *)[barButtonItem performSelector:@selector(view)];
    UIView *containerView = targetView;
    
    // Search upwards in the view hierarchy to determine whether the Bar Button is located in a Navigation Bar, Tool Bar or Tab Bar:
    while (containerView != nil) {
        // Get super view:
        containerView = containerView.superview;
        
        // Check Class:
        if ([containerView isKindOfClass:[UINavigationBar class]] ||
            [containerView isKindOfClass:[UIToolbar class]] ||
            [containerView isKindOfClass:[UITabBar class]]) {
            // When a Navigation Bar, Tool Bar or Tab Bar is found, return it's superview and abort while-loop:
            containerView = containerView.superview;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // When no Navigation Bar, Tool Bar or Tab Bar is found:
    if (nil == containerView) {
        // Get the Bar Button's window:
        containerView = targetView.window;
        
        if (nil == containerView) {
            NSLog(@"Cannot determine container view from UIBarButtonItem: %@", barButtonItem);
            self.targetObject = nil;
            return;
        }
    }

    self.targetObject = barButtonItem;

    [self presentPointingAtView:targetView
                         inView:containerView
                       animated:animated];
}
```

**Validation**
This has been tested and now the pop tip is only shown on the view controller of the specific tab, which is the intended behaviour.

An added benefit is that this also works when presenting the pop tip from a Tab Bar button (this can be added to the ReadMe). 
In this case the intended behaviour is that the pop tip is always visible, no matter which tab is selected.
Because the new code uses the superview of the UITabBar, this is the case.
In this example the pop tip is always presented from the 4th tab, even if it's not the selected tab:
```ObjC
[_poptipForConnectedTv presentPointingAtBarButtonItem:(UIBarButtonItem *)[self.tabBarController.tabBar.items objectAtIndex:3]
                                             animated:YES]; 
```

I want change the distance between targetView and pointView when PointDirection is PointDirectionDown 
Couldn't find any support for this, nor could I find an issue addressing it.

Any plans for adding support for setting line height?
If the trigger popView control, including the keyboard of the rising landing event, how should I set up?

Hi,

Can we bring the popup to center of screen but arrow still pointing to sender direction. I have attached the image to show what I am facing.

Currently the popuptip is shifting right and arrow is correct. But I want to keep the tip in center to screen as client demands.

Can help.

Can I init a tip view with a custom view using auto layout?
