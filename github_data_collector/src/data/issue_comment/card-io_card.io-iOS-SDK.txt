### Issue description

Tried to add CardIO with Cocoapod in XCode 10, Swift 4.2. Seems like it overwrites the Pod project settings so that the build fails because it forces other Pods to build with Swift 4.2. 

Any thoughts?

Thanks!

is it impossible to get scanned image without compression?

### Issue description

We're seeing this warning along side the GoogleMaps SDKs:

```
ld: warning: Some object files have incompatible Objective-C category definitions. Some category metadata may be lost. All files containing Objective-C categories should be built using the same compiler.
```

Unfortunately the version of their that reproduces the issue is not public. We're trying to narrow this down, and we're assuming it's possibly caused by the version of Xcode the newest version of CardIO was compiled with (we've been told by Google they're building the SDK that reproduces this with Xcode 9.3.1).

Is there any way you could provide binaries built with a newer version of Xcode to help us test that theory?

### Issue description

If a user enters their card number manually (no scanning), I would like to get the card type using card IO. Is there a way to do this?

### Issue description

We have the requirement to scan both Embossed and non-Embossed credit cards but unfortunately the card.io does not scan the non-Embossed credit cards. Is it a known issue? If yes, any fix in future release? please help us with your valuable reply. I am using Swift language.
