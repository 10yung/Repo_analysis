As the example shown below, the length of line is actually filled according to the given number which is a quite useful feature. Can this library achieve something similar like this?

**Describe the bug**
A white space appear between the TimelineViews on the list.

**To Reproduce**
I've costumize the item view content and added a TextView that can have multiple lines. If I limit the number of lines to 1, everything works ok, if I have more than one line, the white space appears.

**Expected behavior**
The line should reach the next TimelineView.

**Screenshots**
Limited to 1 line:

Without the line limitation:

**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**
 - Device: android studio emulator - Nexus 5X
 - OS: Android 9.0
 - Version 29

**HINT**
I saw your solution with FrameLayout, but it's not working. The exact same situation appears.
I've notice that if ALL the rows have the same number of text lines, all works great. The problem appears when there are rows with different heights. Is that a problem?


line broke when set each marker size not the same size, any idea?
