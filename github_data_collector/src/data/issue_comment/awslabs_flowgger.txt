Hello,
We are trying flowgger for forwarding logs from remote site to our central Graylog server.
Everything on our infrastructure is with timezone CEST.
Flowgger seems to force the timestamp of the GELF to UTC
Is there a way to configure and change this behavior ?
Thanks in advance
Flowgger seems to be a nice tool !!
Would you be open to accepting a PR to support a Lua parsing?
This way some more custom log formats can be added without having to recompile, or add into source.
Found this while writing tests

As for https://github.com/jedisct1/flowgger/wiki/LTSV-Encoder the encoders should support the ability to add or replace, without duplicating tags and fields.

LTSV is not only not overriding it, but get duplicated as the encoding is done by appending data to a String:

https://github.com/awslabs/flowgger/blob/master/src/flowgger/encoder/ltsv_encoder.rs#L41

  left: `"some_info:foo\tsome_info:bar\thost:example.org\ttime:1385053862.3072\tmessage:A short message\tfull_message:Backtrace   here with more\tlevel:1\tappname:appname\tprocid:44\tmsgid:msg_id"`,
 right: `"some_info:bar\thost:example.org\ttime:1385053862.3072\tmessage:A short message\tfull_message:Backtrace   here with more\tlevel:1\tappname:appname\tprocid:44\tmsgid:msg_id"`', src/flowgger/encoder/ltsv_encoder.rs:175:9

Some work already done in https://github.com/amazon-archives/flowgger-hold/issues/13
For better log processing performance log pass through would be an interesting thing to explore
Hello,

I think, it could be very useful to enhance "Kafka output" with a kind of timer option and associate it with the actual _kafka_coalesce_ parameter.

```
kafka_coalesce=100
kafka_flush_interval=5s
```

If one of theses conditions is met, commit the batch to Kafka.

Thanks
Especially with file input (https://github.com/jedisct1/flowgger/issues/20), it may be desirable to merge the logs from multiple sources (each with their own decoder).
Hi, would netflow/ipfix be an input of interest? 

Awesome code, thanks a lot.

May you please consider to expose some metrics?
Such as: uptime, number of active sessions, message received, sent, droped (charset or bad format).
