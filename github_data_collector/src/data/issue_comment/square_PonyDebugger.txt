Guys do you have any solution for that?

ponyd serve --listen-interface=127.0.0.1
-bash: ponyd: command not found

Current location: https://cloud.github.com/downloads/square/PonyDebugger/bootstrap-ponyd.py  does not exist, is there plan to have this available somewhere else.

How could I resolve this issue?

Apologies for this question which is unrelated to PonyDebugger itself. I am now stuck at downloading `curl -s https://cloud.github.com/downloads/square/PonyDebugger/bootstrap-ponyd.py`.  Is there any other source I could obtain this script from?

I reside in China (behind the nation wide firewall) but I am accessing this via a VPN. I can visit google, facebook without problems but not `cloud.github.com` which have absolutely no clue. 

I am no network guru but I tried nslookup and obtained:

➜  ~ git:(master) ✗ nslookup 
> google.com
Server:		8.8.8.8
Address:	8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:

Non-authoritative answer:
cloud.github.com	canonical name = d24z2fz21y4fag.cloudfront.net.

This is as far as I could get. `cloud.github.com` seems available in from dns but I still do get it why I could access cloud.github.com.
It would be useful to be able to add a sqlite file rather than just a core data file.
I have 404 error on devtools/devtools.html 
Hi there. I tried to install ponyd on my mac but the script seems to fail while installing `setuptools`. I tried to install setuptools manually via pip or easy_install, both worked but didn't fix the issue. 
I'm using homebrew's python 2.7.13 on macOS 10.12.2

Thanks in advance.

Hello. Can you add tvOS support? 
I tried forked repo (https://github.com/shoshins/PonyDebugger) with build/podspec changes for tvos support and now project builds and starts, but still doesn't work. Client shown in ponydebugger client viewer at http://localhost:9000/, but inside devtools only elements shown, network, sources, console, etc are empty. 
Thanks.

/:404 error, devtools:403 error and Cross-origin-not-allowed error.

Hi,

When I launch this command `ponyd serve --listen-interface=127.0.0.1 -v` I get the following result when I try to access the web interface `http://127.0.0.1:9000/devtools/`

```
[W 160613 18:31:29 web:1521] 403 GET /devtools/ (127.0.0.1):  is not a file
[W 160613 18:31:29 web:1946] 403 GET /devtools/ (127.0.0.1) 2.29ms
```

I'm running it on Python 2.7.11. Do you have any idea why I get these
