Let's say i have a destination (bottom sheet, fragment) that adds a new item in the repository. How should i get a callback or a results from it?
Hi have u tried upgrade to `koin 2.0`. Seem like compile ok but does not work, always error `no definition` for `viewmodel` when install
I could not find any mechanism to cancel the requests in the `ViewModels`.
Example `DetailViewModel` line 48:
```withContext(dispatchers.io) { userSource = getUserDetailUseCase(forceRefresh = forceRefresh, login = argsLogin) }```

Is it the case to use `androidx.lifecycle` with `viewModelScope`(although still in alpha)?
