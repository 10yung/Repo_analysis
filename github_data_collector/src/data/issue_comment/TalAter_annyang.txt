Although Firefox should support the Webspeech API now, annyang gives errors!
Firefox does not supports - "recognition.continuous"
If I have debug disabled, there are no errors, but also it shows nothing!

Any fixes?
As per the definition of the trigger method accepts a single string or an array of string and the first string that gets matched to the defined commands gets invoked. 

1) What happens if none of the given strings are matched? will annyang trigger a resultnomatch on each of the strings or only once at the the end?
2) is there a way to stop resultnomatch to be triggered when the annyang trigger method is being called
3) is there a way to have a call back to trigger when all the strings in the array has been attempted to be triggered?

Browser we are using: Chrome

My team and I have been working on adding annyang with Web Speech API to recognize multiple commands, some of which trigger navigation. We are using the browser console to test. We speak a number of commands and get responses, but after a few commands, the console stops recognizing the speech event for the command. We have logged within the methods and the "heard" command and we are getting the correct logs, we just aren't hearing anything. We are also logging commands twice. The more commands we give, we start to eventually log the commands more than twice. Is this a garbage collection issue? We believe this is a bug with how we are integrating our annyang commands and the logic of how we trigger our command methods. Perhaps the same annyang event is persisting. Would love some help if possible!

The problem here seems to be that Firefox does not support "recognition.continuous" (found out by using the non-minified script). If I comment out the two occurences of it in the script, the error goes away. 
Anyang now seems to start, but it doesn't recognize anything... if I enable debug, I get another, weird, error:

If I have debug disabled, there are no errors, but also nothing happens ... 
In case you are wondering, here is my script:

```javascript
    if (annyang) {
        console.log("Annyang found ... listening");
        var commands = {
            'finde *tag': startSearch
        };
        annyang.debug(true);
        annyang.addCommands(commands);
        annyang.setLanguage('de-DE');
        annyang.start({ autoRestart: true, continuous: false });
        console.log("annyang started");
    }
```

## Expected Behavior

Firefox should work, too :)

## Current Behavior
Javascript errors, see above... If I "fix" them, still nothing happens ...

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)

1. Open Firefox
2. in "about:config", search for "speech" and enable all relevant settings
3. Go to https://www.talater.com/annyang/
3. Try examples 
4. Check javascript console


## Your Environment

Current Annyang version, latest Firefox 63.0.3., on MAC OS and Windows
<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->

## Expected Behavior
The  annyang.trigger event should pass a command and be able to accept tags, etc even (especially) when  annyang is not listening. When speech isn't available an input field is normally shown, and it would be nice to have a trigger event that would parse it the exact same as a speech command. This would provide a great deal of continuity to the end user.

## Current Behavior
<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->
<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->

## Possible Solution
 annyang.trigger('go to *tag') function(tag) {
			var str = tag;
			str = str.replace(/\s+/g, "");
			window.open("https://" + str);
		},

Hi there, 

we can analyse microphone's input by web audio api while using browser default recognition.. Ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnalyserNode/getByteFrequencyData

well i tried to do the same with annyang but i failed.. any help or suggestions will be appreciated 
Hi all,

I have make a new project with last version cordova (actually 8.0.0.0), I have add
plugins :
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-media

I have add the platform android 5.1.1
I have verified permission in AndroidManifest.xml : 
`
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
`

I have enable debug mode in annyang, when I launch my application with usb debugging, I see crosswalk is loaded (in console navigator.userAgent) : 
"Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 8.0; MI 5 Build/OPR1.170623.032) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.106 **Crosswalk/21.51.546.7** Mobile Safari/537.36"
But the speechrecognizion don't work..nothing append when I talk.
If I try on my desktop all are ok..
I have tried to add a plugins speech reconizion for force authorization.. the in board application recognizion work, but not the annyang.

There is a way to get more debug log? 

Thanks a lot,


I want to say pause and let annyang stop until I say resume and start listening again

is it possible? 
Is there a way for commands trigger upon hearing just a sole word? Like if I want a function to trigger whenever the word 'up' is heard, whether it be 'move up', 'turn up', 'up up up', etc? Other than simply grabbing the potential possibilities and running a for-loop to check the entire array for an instance in the string?
