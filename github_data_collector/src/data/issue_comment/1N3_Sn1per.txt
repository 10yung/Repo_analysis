Hi,

Last few scans I have a problem, that sniper didn't create files for scan, after that all scan can't run right.

For example:

```
root@kali:~# sniper -t https://somesite.com/ -o -re -fp -b -w somesite
[*] Loaded configuration file from ~/.sniper.conf [OK]
[*] Saving loot to /usr/share/sniper/loot/ [OK]
modes/normal.sh: line 28: /usr/share/sniper/loot//scans/somesite.com/-normal.txt: No such file or directory
modes/normal.sh: line 29: /usr/share/sniper/loot//scans/running-somesite.com/-normal.txt: No such file or directory
tee: /usr/share/sniper/loot//output/sniper-somesite.com/-202001090450.txt: No such file or directory
[*] Loaded configuration file from ~/.sniper.conf [OK]
[*] Saving loot to /usr/share/sniper/loot/workspace/https:--somesite.com- [OK]
```

Pls, can you help with this issue?

Thanks.
So I installed Sn1per and found out that the Kali repositories are mixed without apt pinning. This led to:
- a slower system (REALLY slow)
- a bunch of packages having errors
- not being able to connect to anything because the wifi adapter isn't recognized anymore (without doing some trickery)
- a bunch of programs not starting anymore
... and a few more issues I am not going to mention.

This is just a heads up. Please fix it or many people will have issues like me.

Technical details:
Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS Bionic Beaver
I have stuck when sn1per run wafwoof in 'Gathering Server Info' phase. I ran sn1per with command :
`sniper -t <target>`

Update configuration for OpenVAS to allow remote OpenVAS instances for Sn1per.


Add command switch (-u) for specific URL web scans
is it possible to add amass in sniper to perform asn lookup?
i know sn1per uses amass.
passive and active crawling gives tons of js files.
so idea is collect the js files and pass them to js link finder
