So I found a game I had started making a while ago and never finished. I have the export file, but I can't figure out how to load it in RPGBoss... Every time I try it says No Project Selected. Any suggestions?
Could someone tell me how to make custom sprites? I can't find a way to do it and the guide from here has a link to a website which is down.
I have two collision-related issues. 
   First, for things like lamp posts and caves, I want to allow the player to walk behind the lamps and under a roof. I don't know how to make it so something will stay visible in front of the player while the player can walk behind it.
   Second, I uploaded a custom tileset but the player can walk on top of it. Is there any way to make it so you don't walk on it?

Thank you!
Add is it maintain flags.
After changing some sound (cursor) effects, every time I open the project now the terminal only opens and doesn't continue on after _EventDispatchThread.run (unknown source)_ 

Sound effects were mp3 and removing them did not work.   
Netbeans is a Java IDE and it can open the game and edit maps. I can do everything but actually play test the game. Is there something I can do besides that?
It just left two empty folders on my Desktop, 'Little' and 'Duel'
I just started using rpg boss the other day. I started my first map and set a start point, and then i went to playtest what i have so far. the playtest wndow comes up and i'm able to use the up and down arrows to go through the "new game, load game, quit" options. The problem is that when i land on an option and hit enter nothing happens. I can't select any options. Any idea what might be wrong and how i can fix it?
I would love people to still update this, even if it's just the community, as it has so much potential. This and Open RPG Maker (discontinued in 2014) had an amazing amount of potential. Where did it all go?
