```
local:
  vhost: https://www.trevicoliseum.local
  wordpress_path: /Users/marek/Projects/Larin/trevicoliseum-it/trevicoliseum-it # use an absolute path here

staging:
  vhost: https://staging.trevicoliseum.it
  wordpress_path: /staging.trevicoliseum.it # use an absolute path here
```

This is my setup. The first database replacement works, then the second one wrecks havoc and put the wordpress_path inside all urls. Why the path gets replaced? Is it possible to skip?
Failed to push Database to the production environment.
Anyone able to help me figure out how to handle this issue, thank you.

command: **wordmove push --all -e production --debug --verbose** 
Error: **This does not seem to be a WordPress installation.**

The latest version 5 solves issues I had with other hosts and the database üëç, however the database will still not sync with any sites I administrate on WP Engine. Can anyone share with me how their config looks likes or what steps you take to get it working?

- Wordmove doctor all good
- I'm using MAMP, ZSH
- I've had my IP whitelisted at WP Engine

which mysqldump
/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysqldump

whence -p mysql
/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I deleted a page on my local machine, and then pushed to the production machine and the page was deleted on production too. (Which is to be expected, but also anxiety inducing since I might make a more serious mistake in the future)

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Ability to limit the push to only additions, so that nothing would be deleted from the production site.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I had tried excluding the DB in the 'forbid' section of the movefile.yml, but in that case none of the changes (pages etc.) would get pushed.


Since in the those options we could have important ones about the connection (e.g.: `--socket`), we should use those options while testing the connections.
Since we do not escape spaces, in the path and we don't want to - at the moments - we should be able to warn users with `doctor` command

I've added an optional field for MySQL socket. I did not do a lot of testing but works in all scenarios I tried.
Fixes issue #564 
I'm using Local by Flywheel for my local development and in order to connect with the database, I need to use a socket file (e.g. /Users/myuser/Library/Application Support/Local/run/VCuvaNDJh/mysqld.sock).

It seems that v5 of wordmove doesn't support sockets. Any chance to add it in?
I recently found Wordmove and immediately fell in lust.  I'm not in love yet, but I'm close.  :)

I'm getting the following 500 error at the end of a pull or push of the database:

`/Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.6.0/lib/ruby/2.6.0/open-uri.rb:378:in `open_http': 500 Internal Server Error (OpenURI::HTTPError)`

The updates don't happen on the target. Anyone have any experience with this?  

TIA
