Hello @pyalot ,
I want to confirm the license about this library.
What's the detail BSD license?
References this [website](https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/blob/master/tools/license-list.json).
By the way, is this library published on npm?
Thanks very much!

Hello @pyalot ,
I am the member of the [cdnjs](https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs) project.
We want to host this library.
But there is a question want to ask.
Could you add git tag for repository?
It's helpful for user to know the version and status.
And is this library published on npm package?
Thanks for your help!

Hi @pyalot,

Thanks for the great library, i use it for a personal project.

I would like to plot a heatmap from an area which i would like to split into a grid (e.g. 100x100 meters). is that possible and how? can you overlay the heatmap on google maps somehow?

Thanks,

This isn't really an issue but thought it might be a good context to mention that I forked this project and converted it to ES5 and CommonJS, then published it to npm. see: https://github.com/vicapow/webgl-heatmap.

I did this mainly to require it in the [heatmap-overlay](https://github.com/vicapow/react-map-gl-heatmap-overlay) I created for use with [react-map-gl](https://github.com/uber/react-map-gl).

Hello there !

I have an accuracy issue with this awesome library.
Here is an example : 
I have heatmap with blue, yellow and red colors gradient.
I want to add three points (like this example):
     Point1 : addPoint(130, 100, 90, 0.6) ([130,100] color must be yellow)
     Point2 : addPoint(100, 130, 90, 0.2) ([100,130] color must be blue)
     Point3 : addPoint(130, 130, 90, 0.7) ([130,130] color must be orange)
And there is that I get : 
     Point1 is orange/red
     Point2 is blue/yellow
     Point3 is red
But I expect to have :
     Point1 yellow, Point2 blue, Point3 orange
     Between Points 1 and 2 yellow to blue gradient
     Between Points 2 and 3, blue to orange gradient
     Between points 1 and 3, yellow to orange gradient
This is very important because there is a legend to show which color match with values but because of this sum, this is not accurate at all..
So, I wanted to know if there is a way to have this kind of interpolation.

Thank you for your work.

First of all thank you for the work you have done with WebGL-HeatMap library. I am using your library for a personal project. I encounter a major barrier because the library does not have any method to obtain the intensity of a given point. 

Is there any way to get it?

When trying to convert the canvas to a png, I kept getting empty canvases.

This can be fixed by using `getContext("experimental-webgl", {preserveDrawingBuffer: true});` when using `getContext`.

Just wondering whether the code should be changed accordingly.

I wanted to clear the heatmap without reinstantiating it and was pleased to discover in the source code that this `clear()` method exists. Just want to make it clear for anyone else who is interested in using this plugin :)
