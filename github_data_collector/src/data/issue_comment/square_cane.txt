I realize that there are also many other ways to alert on newline at end of file, but I feel like it would fit into cane's purpose pretty well, since there are also other whitespace/tab validations. 

Assuming I've understood the point at which cane hooks into the testing lifecycle, it would be nice if we could drop a `require 'cane'` statement (or similar) into the Rspec `spec_helper.rb`, and have cane automatically execute as part of the Rspec suite without having to invoke a separate command.

E.g., I want to enforce a doc requirement for my top level directory, but would like to drop in `.cane` files with `--no-doc` in some of the subdirectories.

wrong number of arguments (2 for 1)
/Users/jsmith/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@myapp/gems/cane-2.6.0/lib/cane/json_formatter.rb:8:in `initialize'

It looks like when output colorization was added in https://github.com/square/cane/commit/652c2f887f551a7ddf280399491312526291089a
an options hash parameter was added to the call to initialize the formatter, but it wasn't added to the initializer for JsonFormatter. 

Pull Request forthcoming
