 getParent().requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(true); This line prevents the parent view from scrolling when drawing pattern.
i new to app development . I need to add validation to creating a pattern with minimum 3 or 4 dots make to poper pattern. so let me know where i want to modify the code 

When changing the pattern dot count using `setDotCount()` PatternLockView.java throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because `sDots` is not updated when `setDotCount()` is called.

Changelog:
- `sDots` is changed to a private static Dot[][] of PatternLockView class.
- `sDots` is updated to a new Dot[][] of the appropriate dotCount size.

fixes https://github.com/aritraroy/PatternLockView/issues/31
There is a bug in the PatternLockUtils lib where `stringToPattern()` cannot convert every pattern combination.

Number values should not be saved in a string for pattern views with 4x4 dots and higher, because the tenth, eleventh and twelfth dot will be interpreted as `"1", "0"`, `"1", "1"`, and `"1", "2"`, etc.

`patternToString()`, `patternToMd5()`, `patternToSha1()` should include a separator between each dot (a comma for example), so that we can differentiate between `"1", "0"`, and `"10"`.

1. upgrade the version of gradle so that the project can work at Android Studio 3.3.1 and the later versions;

2. add the .gitignore file to prevent us uploading useless files to the github.

3. add the android support annotations dependency
