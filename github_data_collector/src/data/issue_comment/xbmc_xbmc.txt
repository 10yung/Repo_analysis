## Bug report
### Describe the bug
Kodi Leia 18.4 running on Pi4 (buster) updated && upgraded.
Some times on playing video files just after fresh boot, a black square appears on top the movie (upperleft corner)(see capture, marked with pink arrows) not covering all screen. It is not file-deppendant, once occurs, will happen with all video files. Even happened after long-time paused movie, on going back to play it, black square again.
Only solution is reboot.

As an example if a stream has this URL: `rtp://87.141.215.251@232.0.20.35:10000`

The `87.141.215.251` will be interpreted as the username instead of being passed at part of the URL.

## Description
While working on an InputStream Addon I noted an unexpected exception if the addon did not successfully initialize.  In AddonBase.h, the "addonInstance" argument is not initialized to NULL, and if the addon fails to also do so a segfault may occur attempting to access the m_type member variable.

## Motivation and Context
Failure to provide an initialization for "addonInstance" followed by a failed call to ADDONBASE_CreateInstanceEx() can lead to an exception or unexpected results.  This variable is tested for NULL explicitly as part of the logic, therefore it should be initialized to that value to avoid the segfault/AV.

## How Has This Been Tested?
Tested on Windows Desktop x64 as part of preliminary unit testing for an InputStream addon that may be proposed for Kodi mainline.

## Description
This adds an overload of `IPlayer::AddSubtitle()` which in addition to taken the path to the subtitle also takes the name of the subtitle and its language. Only `CVideoPlayer` implements this interface method (same as the existing `AddSubtitle()` method).

Furthermore the `Player` class in the python add-on API has also been extended with an `addSubtitle()` method which makes use of the new `IPlayer::AddSubtitle()` method.

## Motivation and Context
While working on my media import stuff people requested support for external subtitles. Media backends like Emby and Plex already look for external subtitles and determine metdata like name, language, codec etc. Right now `VideoPlayer` only supports getting a file and then determining all of this metadata itself. @angelblue05 has come up with a workaround for this misfit in "Emby for Kodi" by manually downloading external subtitles from Emby to the local disk and then manually naming them based on the metadata from Emby and finally providing them to Kodi.

I'm mainly interested in whether this would be accepted at all. It doesn't have to merged now and I can keep it as part of my media import work but I don't want to further persue this if it has no chance to hit Kodi mainline.

## Description
<!--- Provide a general summary of your change in the Pull Request title above -->
<!--- Describe your change in detail here -->
Preferably use `year` infolabel in `CVideoInfoTag` if set and extract the year from `premiered` or `aired` infolabel as a fallback.

## Motivation and Context
<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->
<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here -->
When a plugin sets the `year` infolabel on a ListItem using `ListItem.SetInfo()`, it is not being used in `ListItem.Year` infolabel and this causes `DialogVideoInfo.xml` (Information pane) to show no or wrong information. Instead it is always using the year extracted from the `aired` or `premiered` infolabel.

Since some plugins are listing content of tv catchup services, the aired infoLabel actually contains the most recent (re)broadcast date on a TV channel and not the production year.

This fixes https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues/16486

Tested on Linux x64 with Kodi 19 with a "minimal" video plugin containing a ListItem with all "date" related infoLabels set. Also compared the wrong behaviour in Kodi 18 and this fix in Kodi 19 with VRT NU add-on (see screenshots)

Backport of https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/17000
## Description
<!--- Provide a general summary of your change in the Pull Request title above -->
<!--- Describe your change in detail here -->
This PR tries to adapt https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/17187 PR on tvOS.

Call CPoweManager OnWake / OnSleep (through IPowerSyscall) when tvOS activity lifecycle calls applicationWillEnterForeground / applicationDidEnterBackground.

Maybe in the future we will be able to move this code in `ios-common` to use it in both iOS and tvOS?

**Important note:**

I don't know if this problem comes from this commit, but sometimes after move to foreground my last TV channel opens well but I have no sound. I have to switch to another channel to fix the issue and re open last channel...

Also, I am not sure about the `OnAppFocusChange` line. Should we call this line before or after the power manager line? I don't really understand this line :-/
@fuzzard and @kambala-decapitator, if you can have a look please ;-)
Thank you!

## Motivation and Context
<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->
<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here -->
There are services inside kodi (e.g. PVR EPG poll) which should be deactivated when kodi is suspended.

Also, this PR is just another step to improve the user experience on tvOS with Kodi (see https://github.com/SylvainCecchetto/xbmc/issues/79).

## How Has This Been Tested?
<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your change -->
<!--- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->
<!--- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc -->

Tested on tvOS with the following actions:

* Open/close control center while a media is playing
* Move to background then move to foreground while a media is playing
