When I select the text field, enter a text, deselect and select it again two bugs appeared:
- The cursor starts at end of parked text (not at ending of typed text)
- The font style is the same of parked text

Haven't been able to consistently reproduce but I've seen it a few times.

Not sure how easy this is to fix given the current design, but I've noticed it's possible to bring up the Cut/Copy/Paste menu on the parked text area.

There's still some bugs with the caret when there is no text which is kinda interesting
