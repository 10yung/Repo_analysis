I:
- cloned your repository
- opened it in xcode
- got following error (red exclamation mark at Briefs project->Briefs.xcodeproj->Workspace Integrity):
  Couldn't load Briefs.xcodeproj because it is already opened from another project or workspace

Any thoughts would be helpful

... the Project refers to the file as "Icon-Small.png" whilst the filesystem file is named 'Icon-small.png', and breaks on case-sensitive filesystems.
