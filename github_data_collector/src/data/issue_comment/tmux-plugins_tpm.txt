Currently, tpm will show this message every time I execute ctrl-b-U, then type 'all':

```
Updating all plugins!                                                                                                                                                                                           [0/0]  "tmux-sensible" update success
  "tmux-open" update success
  "tmux-urlview" update success
  "tmux-continuum" update success
  "tpm" update success
  "tmux-copycat" update success
  "tmux-resurrect" update success

Done, press ENTER to continue.
```
All packages always show 'update success', whether they really updated or not.

I would like to see more useful information:
* Only list packages that have really been updated
* show the from -> to  commits/tags  to understand how the package has been updated
* bonus: show the changelog url, so that I can jump to it and read what was added/removed/deprecated in that plugin (I don't mind manually adding urls in a config file once).
comment out the first "reload_tmux_environment" , to avoid tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf twice and almost the same time, which will append contents twice , if I set status-left -ag (using -ag)

This will happen when:

`prefix` + <kbd>I</kbd>

`prefix` + <kbd>U</kbd>

`prefix` + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>u</kbd>
Hello :)

I'm on Windows 10 using WSL - Ubuntu.

Installed tmux and tpm, the plugins are installed, i can see them in the /plugins directory. Prefix + I is working.

But i don't know why, my plugins are not working... i try to use tmux-resurrect keys to save/restore, but nothing happens.

Installed continuum too, but it's not working. I added info about it in the status bar but that is not working either. I see only 'Continuum Status:'.

Here is my .tmux.conf: https://pastebin.com/V70rVw2T

What i'm doing wrong?
The current method for setting @plugin options lacks a clean method to provide a user defined config file location. These few lines provide that.

Current [work around](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm/blob/master/docs/tpm_not_working.md): 

Seen recently in #85 
The README states:

> `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/tmux.conf` works too

As of tmux v1.9a, this is not true. It appears from the [tmux GitHub](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/142) issue tracker that the tmux devs have taken a stance against supporting the XDG spec, so it does not look there for the config on its own.
For some reason awk wasn't installed on a machine, and I spent a while trying to figure out why tpm wasn't doing anything.
According to [the specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html), `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` should have a default value of `$HOME/.config`.

This might cause breakage for users who created a `$HOME/.config/tmux/tmux.conf` file but forgot and ended up still using `$HOME/.tmux.conf`, I don't expect it's that many as it doesn't really make sense.
Allows to specify branch for plugins by using `set -g @plugin 'repo#branch'`. If branch is not specified master will be used. 
one of my plugins report failure when trying to update it
also, trying to load one plugin says  that tpm returned 1
how can I look into it thoroughly ?
The previous release ([v3.0.0](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm/releases/tag/v3.0.0)) was published on August 3, 2015. We're coming up on almost 4 years since then, and there's been quite a large number of improvements (over 40 commits) that many users aren't benefiting from. It would be great to get a more recent release tagged.
