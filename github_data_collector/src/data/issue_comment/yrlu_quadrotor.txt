Hi. I tried to run your repo but there's this error qn not found/undefine..Help me solve this one. Thanks.
We are students from Institute of Space and Technology. We are taking help from your project and we need help with plotting the Angles and Angular Rates when a trajectory is generated. Kindly guide us with how can we get our desired plots.
Hi,

I'm conducting a personal research using multiple Crazyflies, using UWB Positioning.

I'd like my multiple of drones to travel to a target location while being able to avoid static obstacles & other drones

What's needed to be changed for this code to work for multiple UAVs concurrently?

Has this been explored before?

Thanks!
This modification allows changing the level of continuity during optimization. A.k.a, if a 7th order polynomial spline is used, it can be only C3, or C2 continuous. Code is taken and modified upon the repo: [here](https://github.com/symao/minimum_snap_trajectory_generation).
Hello, Is the ROS framework environment used to interface with the crazyflie available somewhere? Thanks!
Hi, 
I git clone the codes of quadrotor, and tried to run it.  There are some errors following the instructions in readme.md. I think the tj_from_line function is missing? Would you commit the missing files?Thank you.
