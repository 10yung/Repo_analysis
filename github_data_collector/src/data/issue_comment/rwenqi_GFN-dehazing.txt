Hi,I want to run this project on my computer.I install caffe and matlab 2016b.My caffe is based on GPU.And erery time when I ran the 'demo.m',my matlab collapse and show me the following mistakes:

This error was detected while a MEX-file was running. If the MEX-file
is not an official MathWorks function, please examine its source code
for errors. Please consult the External Interfaces Guide for information
on debugging MEX-files.

Error using caffe_
Usage: caffe_('delete_solver', hSolver)

Error in caffe.Solver/delete (line 40)
      caffe_('delete_solver', self.hSolver_self);

Error in caffe.Solver (line 17)
    function self = Solver(varargin)

Error in caffe_init (line 6)
X.Solver_ = caffe.Solver(solver_file); % to cpp

Error in modelconfig_test (line 23)
Solver = caffe_init(Solver, solver_file);

Error in demo_test (line 17)
Solver = modelconfig_test( solver_file, save_file); 
> In caffe.Solver (line 17)
  In caffe_init (line 6)
  In modelconfig_test (line 23)
  In demo_test (line 17) 
And I found that it looks like run on the CPU and I do not know how to fix this problem.Can you help me?

    您好，我对您的去雾网络很感兴趣，在跑您的代码的时候遇到了一些问题，使用您的模型，在cpu模式跑demo_test，内存占用在17G左右，可以跑起来；切换到gpu模式时，因为我只有一块12gb的卡，所以直接out of memory了，batchsize设置为1仍然不能解决问题，因此想请教下您的实验环境是怎样的，使用的显卡显存有多大，谢谢您啦！
