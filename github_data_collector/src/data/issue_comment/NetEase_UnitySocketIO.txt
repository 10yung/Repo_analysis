In client.cs, "using System.Collections.Concurrent;"  is available in c# 4.0, not compatible with unity. 
When I tried create a new socket by doing same as how API done,It cames:
Here is my code ,just same as api:https://github.com/NetEase/UnitySocketIO

```
void Start () {
    string url = "http://192.168.199.128:5500";
    client = new Client(url);
    client.Opened += SocketOpened;
    client.Message += SocketMessage;
    client.SocketConnectionClosed += SocketConnectionClosed;
    client.Error += SocketError;
    client.Connect();
}

private void SocketError(object sender, ErrorEventArgs e)
{
    Debug.Log(e.Message);
}

private void SocketConnectionClosed(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Debug.Log(e);
}

private void SocketMessage(object sender, MessageEventArgs e)
{
    Debug.Log(e.Message);
}

private void SocketOpened(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Debug.Log("Socket Connected!");
}
```

现在socket.io出到1.4.5了

Hi Everyone,
I am working on video stream of a camera of a device in unity, here everything is give for how to start client can any give me hint how to start the server where this client send and receive data. 
I am beginner in the this fields . So looking for your help.
Thanks in advance.

i have problem to use this.

when i try to emit to server, sometimes it's not call callback func.
( only application. test in editor, server send message ordinarily(pc))

why is that ?

Unless i'm interpreting the example wrong, I have: 

"void Start () {
        MyClient = new Client("http://95.232.201.42:35352"); //Custom Port
        MyClient.Message += SocketMessage;
        MyClient.Opened += SocketOpened;
        MyClient.SocketConnectionClosed += SocketConnectionClosed;
        MyClient.Error += SocketError;

```
    MyClient.Connect();
}
```

"

The socket server doesn't detect the connection, and I know it works because I've had it work with other utilities.
Either i'm not giving the correct URi/URL or this is too outdated.

i see you mention net 4.0 in your introduction.Since Unity3d use net2.0 build android, so i wonder it works for mobile platform?
forgive me, my english is not very good.

This library does work with Socket.io greater than v0.9. The current version is now up to v1.1. Please consider releasing an update.


想知道为什么？？
