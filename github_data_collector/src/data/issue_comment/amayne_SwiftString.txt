`rindexOf` is used to get the last occurrence of the given substring. It is a reverse version of `indexOf`.

Sample usage as below:
**rindexOf(substring)**

``` swift
"hello".rindexOf("hell"), // 0
"helloll".rindexOf("ll"), // 5
"hello".rindexOf("world") // nil
```

Test case for the new method is provided.

update Podfile, @amayne 

Hello there, 

I would like to know if someone's already working on updating this library, and if not if you intend to, I would also like to help in this.

Thank you,
tiferrei

`"abcdefgh"[4..<8]` now yields `"efgh"`, as expected.

does SwiftString's subscript work this way intentionally?


when i'm import SwiftString
i'm todo:

var name = "arden"
name.length
name.isEmpty()

then ambiguous errors

@amayne I used your code to learn how to create Carthage packages using [Thoughtbot's tutorial on creating frameworks](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/creating-your-first-ios-framework).

I have also turned your phenomenal list of examples into XCTests that verify the code does what it's intended to do. The two functions that return NSDate are not as well-covered as the rest. I have to dig into my notes on how the class works.

Finally, I have tweaked the setup for Travis according to [Carthage's instructions](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#archive-prebuilt-frameworks-into-one-zip-file).

I have not properly tested support of Cocoapods, but I have edited the paths in the `.podspec` file, so that should probably do it.

This would close #5, making the package more robust.
