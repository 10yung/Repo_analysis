Tested in new browser versions. The plugin works fine.
Patch for invalidargument URL.createObjectURL in FF 62.0.2
Hi,

This is intended to address #30.

The application code can specify a 'get_media_options' function during construction, which is passed the `default_media_options` and returns an arbitrary options object.

In our case we could request the maximum possible resolution from Firefox using the following code, after which it is no longer capped at 640x.


                get_media_options: (default_media_options) => lodash.merge(
                    {},
                    default_media_options,
                    {
                        // --- request maximum possible resolution:
                        // necessary for Firefox, at least.
                        video: {
                            width: 9999,
                            height: 9999,
                        }
                    }
                )

Hi, this is intended to address #7.

The stream object is exposed to the application code.

The application code can then stop the stream with code like:

            const { stream, } = <your webcam instance>
            if (!stream) return console.error("No stream object, can't stop!")
            stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop())


Lock onto the highest resolution available starting from 720p
