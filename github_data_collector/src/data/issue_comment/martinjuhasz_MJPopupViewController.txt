Hey man, first and foremost awesome popup control, I am trying to use voiceover, but, it doesn't seem to trigger on the popup, any idea why?
I want to dismiss the popup view by a button click placed in to the view and callback should happen when i do it.
Please help me
I have TableView in UIViewController with custom cell. And in custom cell I have 1 A view with UITapGestureRecognizer when tap it I call viewController as popup as below:
in AView.m

`UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"Main" bundle:nil];
    PreviewImageController *vc = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:STORYBOARD_ID_PREVIEW_IMAGE];
    vc.sUrlImage = self.sUrl;
    vc.view.frame = CGRectMake(200, 200, 250, 250);
    vc.tapToBack = ^{
        [[self parentVController] dismissPopupViewControllerWithanimationType:MJPopupViewAnimationFade];
    };
    [[self parentVController] presentPopupViewController:vc animationType:MJPopupViewAnimationFade];`

with **[self parentVController]** is category from UIView:
`-(UIViewController *)parentVController{
id object = [self nextResponder];
 while (![object isKindOfClass:[UIViewController class]] && object != nil) {
 object = [object nextResponder];
  } 
 return object;
}`

When I check parentController, it still get exactly UIViewcontroller include tableview. But popup no show. Have any idea for solution? 

i want to assign different colors to popup view while it open.
please help me.

the - (void)dismissPopupViewControllerWithanimation:(id)sender is for the UIViewController, so what if i am displaying only UIView and want to remove it from the parent view

just set as you say, and call out the pop view from my tableviewcell(in my cell, an btn call out your pop view), it success appear but the cancel btn do not work,
how to solve this?
please do me a favor for this problem,thanks!


I think there is no need to call view lifecycle methods manually, right?


I have added a property which is defined like below

```
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL mj_ignoreTouchOutside;
```

At the same time, the demo project has been modified to enable this new feature
