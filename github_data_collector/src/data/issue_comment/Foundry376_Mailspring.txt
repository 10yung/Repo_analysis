Hello there.
I really dont understand how to turn on Send And Archive By default.
I've seen an issue here, and as soon as I follow the instructions (editing the config.json) it breaks the app.
Help please

Select *Unread* box, open any unread mail, and when you comeback to the *Unread* box, it still shows the mail there, where as it should have been removed from *Unread* box.
The mails disappear from *Unread* after I reload Mailspring.

Send a longer mail with several paragraphs divided by empty lines to someone.
Receive their response where they answer something for each of your original paragraphs.
Try replying to them by opening empty lines below their responses.
Only the first response will have correct quoting level (i.e. 2 indents for your original paragraph, 1 indent for their response, 0 indent for the text you are currently typing). Every other response you enter will have 0 indent for previous text in discussion.

Darn, quoting levels just don't work! This is basic thing and messes up my discussions with colleagues. Goodbye Mailspring.

##### Description

Today, I was wondering if the "Mark as Spam" button in Mailspring actually offers me any advantage over the "Move to Trash" button. What does "Mark as Spam" do in the background? It would be cool to not have to care about incoming junk/spam emails and make it learn the pattern of emails that the user deletes right away, so that they can get moved into spam/trash folders automatically.

##### Does this feature exist in another mail client or tool you use?

Yes, in Mozilla Thunderbird and I loved it for its accuracy. A link to an explanation can be found here: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Help_Documentation:Dealing_with_Junk_E-mail#Adaptive_Filtering
