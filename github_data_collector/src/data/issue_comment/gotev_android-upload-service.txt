Hi! Good library, thanks!

I think it will be good if we can pass `LifecycleOwner` as a parameter to the `RequestObserver`.

In this case, for example, we can use fragment's `viewLifecycleOwner` instead of context's `LifecycleOwner`, because context represents LifecycleOwner that observe `Activity` callbacks.
Tests are needed and may help library users better understand and try features without real servers: https://github.com/gotev/android-upload-service/issues/463#issuecomment-546435992
Placeholders contains non localizable text at the moment, as pointed out by https://github.com/gotev/android-upload-service/issues/463#issuecomment-544989334

Make them localizable and customizable
