Please let me know if that is possible to achieve this using PDTSimpleCaelndar.
Hi, 

We noticed an issue recently where even though we give as first/last date it displays a different date. I got to the conclusion that you take into consideration the timezone when using the dates. Do you know if we can prevent this. See attached screenshots.

When I tried to use UIAppearance properties with PDTSimpleCalendar, I saw odd behavior and dug in further. In an unsurprising case, Apple's documentation on how to create a UIAppearanceContainer is skimpy and sometimes wrong. After digging into the code and discussing it with engineers in the WWDC17 labs, I have made these changes. The engineers involved have requested that I file a documentation bug with Apple. Which I am doing.

Primarily, I have moved the default properties into `+initialize` and then used them in the `-didMoveToWindow`. Almost all custom accessors have been removed. This allows a cleaner execution model and is the WWDC17 labs consensus preferred implementation.

The code is now shorter, aligns with the UIAppearanceContainer pattern, and works.
Is it possible to set two month per page ? means when calendar initialise  there are two months par page then when user scroll  then display next two month par page. is it possible ?

Hello,
I know this is good demo and good example code. But in my issue,
In My ios App that developed By Other Developer and set the SimpleCalender.
But Now i want to set the RangeCalendar instead of the SimpleCalender.
But, I don't know how to do this...
Other Developer Code is Like,

 **DatePickerViewController.h** file,

@interface DatePickerViewController : PDTSimpleCalendarViewController{
}
**DatePickerViewController** is simple view controller.

And in **DatePickerViewController.m** File,

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];

     [self setDelegate:self];
    self.weekdayHeaderEnabled = YES;
    self.weekdayTextType = PDTSimpleCalendarViewWeekdayTextTypeShort;
    [[PDTSimpleCalendarViewCell appearance] setCircleSelectedColor:[UIColor defaultColor]];
    [[PDTSimpleCalendarViewHeader appearance] setTextColor:[UIColor defaultColor]];
}
So, Please Guide me and Help me where i set and where i change in code For set RangeCalendar ?

Thank s in advance.

Dear author, can increase the hours, minutes?
I hope you can reply to meã€‚Thank you for your

Hi, I came across this amazing lib. I saved me a lot of time and designing.
But one question about it?
How can it be set in a page of a specified date initially, but not in the first date page??
