Hello,

I just realized, that the ISPConfig DNS update script (/dnsapi/dns_ispconfig.sh) is not working anymore.
ISPConfig version: 3.1.15p2
acme.sh version v2.8.5

The error is: Couldn't add ACME Challenge TXT record to zone.

The problem is, that one database value is not correct:

Result of _ISPC_addTxt: '{"code":"remote_fault","message":"Incorrect integer value: '' for column `dbispconfig`.`dns_rr`.`sys_userid` at row 1 INSERT INTO `dns_rr` ... ... ... ...

The value is empty.

Could you please check this and update your script?

Thank you very much!
Hello,

I know about error with supported dns-01 - specified dns-01, but I get vice-versa error now.

[Fri Jan 17 09:00:39 CET 2020] Error, can not get domain token entry **********.org
[Fri Jan 17 09:00:39 CET 2020] The supported validation types are: http-01 , but you specified: dns-01

It is wildcard certificate for 2 domains. This is scripted enviroment, others requests are ok. But why I got http-01 for wildcard?

Thank you Pavel

# Feature request: Ubuntu package

After fresh AWS install I just want to do:

```
apt install acme.sh
```

Not having acme.sh in Ubuntu package repository complicates my Ansible playbooks. Separate PPA would be OK too. Additional argument: acme.sh package could depend on `socat` which would smoothen installation even more.

How much work would it be to add a script to release new versions of acme.sh to the PPA repository?

Hi,

When using `--toPkcs ` without a password you are still prompted for a password.
This prompt is coming from OpenSSL and the only way I managed to get rid of it was to add `-passout pass:` at the end of line 1317 to look like this:

`${ACME_OPENSSL_BIN:-openssl} pkcs12 -export -out "$_cpfx" -inkey "$_ckey" -in "$_ccert" -certfile "$_cca" -passout pass:`

instead of this:

`${ACME_OPENSSL_BIN:-openssl} pkcs12 -export -out "$_cpfx" -inkey "$_ckey" -in "$_ccert" -certfile "$_cca"`

Not really sure if this is the way to go or if there is a better way?
However, a fix for this would be great since I changed this a while back and when I upgraded acme.sh couple of weeks ago all my other scripts stopped working since the .pfx-files never got created.
I need to apply ssl on my domain which was used in reverse proxy environment, but I can not find a way to do...
please help me
