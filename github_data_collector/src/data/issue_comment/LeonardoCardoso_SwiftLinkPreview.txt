Hi there, for Spotify links (that previously worked with last version of SWP), we now get only one image returned, blank: `https://pixel.spotify.com/v1/sync `

I am try to preview google photo album's shared url using SwiftLinkPreview. But in the result, I am not getting expected results whereas if I shared same URL to WhatsApp or Skype, I can show link preview for same URL. 

Request URL: https://photos.app.goo.gl/D2pM5KCoFEhStCYu9

Thanks 
Hi, library will not recognize this link to image as image https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRCOTfliprVwAs_8dyUmDYUOiUtq9Rq_285lFvvXHYQTeJ5Bb6Z3Q

It returns  Response(url: Optional(https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRCOTfliprVwAs_8dyUmDYUOiUtq9Rq_285lFvvXHYQTeJ5Bb6Z3Q), finalUrl: Optional(https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRCOTfliprVwAs_8dyUmDYUOiUtq9Rq_285lFvvXHYQTeJ5Bb6Z3Q), canonicalUrl: Optional("encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com"), title: nil, description: nil, images: nil, image: nil, icon: nil, video: nil)

Expected result is that image should contain url https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRCOTfliprVwAs_8dyUmDYUOiUtq9Rq_285lFvvXHYQTeJ5Bb6Z3Q
I compare version 2.3.0 with version 2.2.0
Most URL work fine, but like "tw.yahoo.com", 
version 2.3.0 callback about 7 sec.  
version 2.2.0 callback about 4 sec.

```

func substring(_ start: Int, end: Int) -> String {
return String(self[Range(self.index(self.startIndex, offsetBy: start) ..< self.index(self.startIndex, offsetBy: end))])

    }
```
the above function contains a method resulting in the following error:

Cannot invoke initializer for type 'Range<_>' with an argument list of type '(Range<String.Index>)' in Xcode 10 beta 1.

I appreciate this is a very early report, but does seem to be a swift version issue.
Hi, is there a way to prevent:

`<meta property=\"robots\" content=\"noindex,nofollow\">`

page?
I don't want to show a preview for any site that is pornographic or gambling related (or anything else that would be inappropriate). Is there a way to check for those categories using this repository?
```html
<base href="https://host/resource/index/" target="_self">
<img src="assets/test.png">
```

In this case SwiftLinkPreview get image link is **assets/test.png** 

but the image real url is **https://host/resource/index/assets/test.png**

How can I get it real url?


Ideas:
- Set a minimum dimension for images.
- Find a way to detect dimensions before downloading the image.
