Are there plans to make this work with recent dependencies?


You can test locally with:

    jekyll serve --baseurl='/iocamljs'
Setting both options leads to undefined results (seems that `-static` is ignored)

It seems stand-alone `kernel.foo.js` doesn't work with split lines in the code. I got the following error message:

```
[Error] TypeError: undefined is not a function (evaluating 'string.split(/\r\n?|\n/)')
    (anonymous function) (codemirror.js, line 5481)
    setValue (codemirror.js, line 4689)

Hi,

sorry for the naive question. I am trying to put online a small tutorial using static webpages, using a custom iocamljs kernel. I've read the documentation to successfully build my custom `kernel.js` but I don't know what to do next. What static files should I copy on my website?
