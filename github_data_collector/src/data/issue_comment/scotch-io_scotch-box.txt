```
Essentially 'vagrant up --provision' fails because APT repos no longer exist. 

Scotchbox should have been upgraded to 18.04 a long time ago. In fact, it kinda boggles the mind that a dev tool is *not* running on the LTS version of Ubuntu.

Vagrant was unable to mount VirtualBox shared folders. This is usually
because the filesystem "vboxsf" is not available. This filesystem is
made available via the VirtualBox Guest Additions and kernel module.
Please verify that these guest additions are properly installed in the
guest. This is not a bug in Vagrant and is usually caused by a faulty
Vagrant box. For context, the command attempted was:

mount -t vboxsf -o dmode=777,fmode=666,uid=1000,gid=1000 var_www /var/www

The error output from the command was:

: No such device

Is it just me, or does the Pro version still enable PHP 7.0 as default?  Can we get that changed to 7.2?
Hi, thank you for Scotch-box-pro, it's awsome :)

Unfortunately, no matter what I try **I can't install the soap module for PHP 7.2**. 

I can install `php-7.1-soap` only (with apt).

I've added `ppa:ondrej` repo but it doesn't contain the package either.
What can I do? I don't want to upgrade the whole OS to bionic.
It's been a while since PHP 7.0 has reached its end of life! Will we see an update of Scotch Box Free version 3.5 to 3.6 any time soon?
I think it might be time to get Ubuntu 18.04, PHP 7.2 and MySQL 5.7.25 out of the box.
Very often, there is a need to change the patch version of PHP installed. For example, my team's policy is that we support at least PHP 7.0.33 (latest patch), and therefore the development environment must be at that version.

## A. Update OS Package
One way of doing this is described [here](https://serverfault.com/a/883059/191156). Basically, after logging into your environment (`vagrant ssh`), you find out what PHP versions are available to you:

```bash
sudo apt show -a php7.0 | grep Version
```

This will produce output, e.g.

```
Version: 7.0.33-0ubuntu0.16.04.2
Version: 7.0.18-0ubuntu0.16.04.1
Version: 7.0.4-7ubuntu2
```

Once you know this, you can install a specific version:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php7.0=7.0.33-0ubuntu0.16.04.2
```

## B. Build for Specific Requirements
If you have very specific requirements, especially if you need PHP compiled in a certain way, one good solution is using [`phpbrew`](https://github.com/phpbrew/phpbrew). This will allow you to build any PHP version. Be aware, however, that since you are building PHP in your dev environment, that environment will need to contain *build* requirements, which are very often `devel`-level packages. There is no definitive list of packages you need, because build requirements for each specific PHP version is different. You can find an example of doing this [here](https://github.com/RebelCode/eddbk/blob/develop/Vagrantfile#L76).

1. [Install build requirements](https://github.com/RebelCode/eddbk/blob/develop/Vagrantfile#L34). These are the different OS packages that are needed to build my specific version, which in that example is PHP 5.5.10.
2. [Install `phpbrew`](https://github.com/RebelCode/eddbk/blob/develop/Vagrantfile#L76). Pretty straight-forward sequence according to the manual, which will result in it having an up-to-date version of recipes.
3. [Compile PHP](https://github.com/RebelCode/eddbk/blob/develop/Vagrantfile#L85). Creates a new version available to PHPBrew with specific extensions, and also adds code to the startup script. This helps with running `phpbrew` in the future.
4. [Switch to new PHP version](https://github.com/RebelCode/eddbk/blob/develop/Vagrantfile#L95). This means that the version will now become available.

Another similar approach is by using [`phpenv`](https://github.com/phpenv/phpenv), which is gaining popularity.
