hello
Apple want 64 bit support for application
when i set Compiling options for Valid Architectures set to arm64 armv7 armv7s

i have this result :

The tiles are called again and a gray square appears before load the tile.

could you plz make it pod

map tiles- sometimes when a user zooms out all the map tiles don't appear- can Any one look into this.

I want to know how to integrate offline and online ,I use RMDBMapSource class can load the tile and it can display to the Map.Contents,but now my mapView can only display offline map,other place are gray, I want mapView can load data when out of range.Can someone help?

By uploading the app to the app store have given me this error. 

I am using a sqlite map to load in offline mode, so this map is being seen as a backup stored in iCloud, so I'm skipping storage restrictions. 

The code is as follows: 

[[RMDBMapSource alloc] initWithPath: @ "map.sqlite"]; 

The map.sqlite size is 23MB.

My code is this

```
//Creating the point
CLLocationCoordinate2D centerPoint;
 centerPoint.latitude = 36.966029;
 centerPoint.longitude = -121.977739;

//print out its contents
NSLog(@"Coords should be: lat %f,long %f ", centerPoint.latitude,centerPoint.longitude);

// create the map view
_map = [[RMMapView alloc]
            initWithFrame: self.view.bounds
            andTilesource:cartoSource
            centerCoordinate:centerPoint
            zoomLevel:6
            maxZoomLevel:18
            minZoomLevel:1
            backgroundImage:nil];

//print out its centerCoordinates
NSLog(@"NEW coords: lat %f,long %f ", _map.centerCoordinate.latitude,_map.centerCoordinate.longitude);

//set the center coordinates AGAIN
[_map setCenterCoordinate:centerPoint animated:0];

//print out centerCoordinates
NSLog(@"NEW coords: lat %f,long %f ", _map.centerCoordinate.latitude,_map.centerCoordinate.longitude);
```

The NSLogs print out the following:

```
Coords should be: lat 36.966029,long -121.977739 
NEW coords: lat 0.000000,long 0.000000 
NEW coords: lat 0.000000,long 0.000000 
NEW coords: lat 0.000000,long 0.00 000
```

No matter what coordinates I set my centerCoordinate to, it is always 0. 
The same does not happen when I use another constructor like 
    say 
    `[initWithrame:];`

What am I doing wrong? Is this a bug?

When I have line with a lot of points and when I zoom or move map then line stay in old position, and not drawn again

Sometimes lines are drawn incorrect. I mean, if I create path and markers with same coordinates, then sometimes line is incorrect. 

MapView.xcodeproj does not contain RMCloudMadeMapSource.h and RMCloudMadeMapSource.m
