Hi
I'm getting, a weird behaviour using the lib, when I run the app I get the app with the table view set to 0,0 position of the screen. This problem is not happening on ios 13.2.1, it happens on earlier version. 
If I scroll down I can see the header view and it works as expected, the issue is that when it starts for the first time it is hidden.

This is the setup of my stretchy view:
```
    private let stretchyHeader: StretchyHeaderView = {
        let stretchyHeader = StretchyHeaderView(headerHeight: 350)
        stretchyHeader.expansionMode = .topOnly
        return stretchyHeader
    }()
```
I set it as subview of my table view in the **viewDidLoad()** method. The **StretchyHeaderView** is a custom subview where I setup a main image with auto layout, I use **snapkit**. The image is constrained to all the edges of the content view.
If I inspect the view using the UI debugger I can see that the **StretchyHeaderView** has a weird value of height of **-0**. 

Do you have any suggestions?
Thanks.
Hi ,  i am using the stretchyheaderview for a tableView which have sections.
the problem is that the sections are over the header , how can i resolve this issue please ??
I ve tried to give bottom drop shadow to headerView but none of them worked, is there anything should I know ? I ve tried these code blocks:
---------------------------------------
```
headerView.layer.shadowOpacity = 1
headerView.layer.shadowOffset = CGSize(width: 0, height: 1)
headerView.layer.shadowRadius = 1
```
----------------------------------------
```
let layer : CAGradientLayer
layer.colors = [fromColor.cgColor, toColor.cgColor]
layer.shadowRadius = 1
layer.startPoint = CGPoint(x: 0.5, y: 1.0)
layer.endPoint = CGPoint(x: 0.5, y: 0.0)
layer.frame = CGRect(x: 0.0, y: headerView.frame.height - shadowRadius, width: headerView.frame.width, height: shadowRadius)
headerView.layer.addSublayer(layer)
```
           
I need to implement the refresh control above the header, right now we show it below the header, between the header and the collection view data
thank you :)
It seems that when used in an inactive tab, the headerView doesn't seem to correctly redraw when the tableView is reloaded.

Here's a precise example.

In this first case (correct behaviour), I scroll down the down the table, and the headerView (the faces and dates) begin to scroll and I let the headerView hidden at half its height. If I click on another face while staying in the same tab, the table is reloaded, and the headerView correctly position itself at its original position, full size.

In the second case (wrong behaviour), I scroll down the table at the same position, then I CHANGE TAB, click on another face (which trigger the same refresh function on every tab via the NotificationCenter), then if I go back to the previous tab, the headerView is at the correct position, but is strangely clipped!.

The only/ugly workaround I found is to force redraw by doing this:
```
subjectsAndPeriodView.maximumContentHeight += 1
subjectsAndPeriodView.maximumContentHeight -= 1
```

Any advice on how to trigger the redraw correctly?
Thanks!
When deleting or inserting rows in a tableView with a GSKStretchyHeaderView, the header gets animated from the bottom to the top of the the tableView. Enable slow animations on a simulator to catch it. Tested on iOS 11.0
When I set self.tableView.contentInset = UIEdgeInsetsMake(70, 0, 0, 0);
The header always min height mode
Please fix this.

Downloaded Example App and executed it, In iPhone X the back button in the Nav Bar is not Aligned properly and when click on the Back button is not working as it is displaying on the Top, When click on the Bottom it worked. How can it be fixed. 

Attaching the Image

Hi, maybe I'm missing something and you can help me.
I'm installing using Cocoa Pods. My podfile looks like this:

```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
use_frameworks!
target 'Project' do
    pod 'GoogleMaps'
    pod 'GooglePlaces'
    pod 'GSKStretchyHeaderView'
    pod 'FacebookCore'
    pod 'FacebookLogin'
end
```

After I do a 'pod install' successfully, i cant't reference GSKStretchyHeaderViewSubclass. 
If I write 
`var stretchyHeader: GSKStretchyHeaderViewSubclass!`
I get the error "Use of undeclared type". I'm probably missing something, but I can't find the solution...

Thanks!
