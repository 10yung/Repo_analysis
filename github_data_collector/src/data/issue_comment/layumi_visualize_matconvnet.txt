Hi there

somehow I get the warning
_Warning: Escaped character '\P' is not valid. See 'doc sprintf' for supported special characters. 

> In draw_net (line 31)_

and no file is outputted for my net. I had to change line 31 to incorporate the full path to dot.exe and I did this in the follwowing way:

_cmd = sprintf('C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz 2.28\bin\dot -Tpng -Gsize="48,48" "%s" -o"%s"', dotFile, imageFile);  % for better view, you can use number bigger than 32_

Is that the cause for the warning and the reason that I don't get a visualization of my net? If so, what am I doing wrong?

Thanks for your help
