Hi 
I am getting an error while installing the package.

Installing package into ‘C:/Users/svishwakarma/Documents/R/win-library/3.5’
(as ‘lib’ is unspecified)
Warning in install.packages :
  cannot open compressed file 'muxViz-master/DESCRIPTION', probable reason 'No such file or directory'
Error in install.packages : cannot open the connection

Please let me know what to do in this issue.
The website link fails to provide the full paper, ideally, this should be included in the repository as a pdf.,

Hi,
is this project unmaintained?
The last commit is dated January 2018, and there are some open issues as well.
Best
I'm running muxViz through the Docker image. I can import my config file but the paths it lists aren't found by muxViz. I've tried placing all files within the same folder and prefacing filenames with "./" to no avail. Presumably this has something to do with the VM sandbox. How do I get the muxViz Docker to discover my local paths?

I tried switching to R directly but there's an rjava issue with OpenStreetMaps that I can't seem to overcome.
Hi, 
I'm new in muxviz, and I want to show my node labels in my multilayer network, the problem when I check  the case **"Show nodes labels:"** in the platform, it shows me only node ids.

My data in my Layout file is like that:
[LAYOUT.txt](https://github.com/manlius/muxViz/files/2219148/LAYOUT.txt)

if can anyone help me in that I would be very thankful.
Hi everyone! I've been working on this issue for two days but don't know how to fix it.
Here is my "external edge color and size" file (in txt format separated by space), sure for test, this file contains only 1 row besides the header :

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26270078/42690644-a1d7997c-86d7-11e8-9c67-f9b408c91059.PNG)
The error says:
![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26270078/42690638-980ff2a4-86d7-11e8-9a58-8709aac776bf.PNG)
In English, it reads, **"Error in $<-.data.frame: replacement has 0 row, data has 1"**.

I googled the error message almost everywhere on stackoverflow and many other websites but still don't know how to fix it. 

I've also tried my best to retrieve the record but I don't know where the numbers before the information is, i.e., "91: stop","90:$<-.data.frame", etc, because they are not in muxVizGUI.R, not in server.R, not in ui.R, etc, thus, I cannot fix the problem according to the warning message.

At one time I thought it may be the wrong sequence to import the data before rendering the graph, I've tried:
1. Apply layout-> import my external edges files ->Render network;
2.  import my external edges files ->Apply layout->Render network;

But neither of them works since the upload procedure is OK, but always fail in "import" procedure, as prompted by the lower right pop-up info messages.

Does anyone know how to fix the problem? I appreciate any of your help and thanks a lot!


This works well if I import the txt file before I load any other data. However, if I load the graphics after I've loaded the edges. layers and nodes, I get the following error message:

```
Warning: Error in $<-.data.frame: replacement has 0 rows, data has 1255
  91: stop
  90: $<-.data.frame
  76: observeEventHandler [C:\Users\username\Documents\muxviz\muxViz-master/server.R#8434]
   5: runApp
```
Hello, I'm running muxViz on a Windows 10 64 bit OS, R version 3.4.3, RStudio version 1.1.423

I've managed to install and run analysis on a dataset and muxViz successfully displayed my rendered multilayer network on the RGL window. However, when I try to export the image (as a png file), I get the following error: 

Warning in rgl.snapshot(FILE_RGL_SNAPSHOT) :
  RGL: Pixmap save: unable to open file 'C:\Users\SANDRA\Documents\R\muxViz-master\"C:\Users\SANDRA\Documents\R\muxViz-master\export\muxViz_05-03-2018_162649_05-03-2018_163223.png"' for writing
Warning in rgl.snapshot(FILE_RGL_SNAPSHOT) : 'rgl.snapshot' failed

When the program is actually trying to export the image, I see that the directory address displayed has both back- and forward slashes, however they do not appear in the resulting Warning message. I also get  similar error when I'm trying to generate annular visualizations.

Any suggestions will be appreciated. 

When I trying to install your muxViz, there is a error:`colourInput() has been moved to the 'colourpicker' package.`
I asked others he tell me the  `colourinput()` funcition now is in the `colourpicker` instead of `shinyjs`.
I want to konw if I want to modify profile, where should I modify.
The function `colourInput()` used to be in the shinyjs package. It's been deprecated and moved into `colourpicker` package for well over a year, and recently it was completely removed from shinyjs. Please update the code to use the `colourpicker` package instead.

I got a bug report on `colourpicker` because an error came up because of this https://github.com/daattali/colourpicker/issues/26
