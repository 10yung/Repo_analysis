Hello, This is not an issue, I have been looking around for a Comment Section to no avail... 

I just tested this (Lite Version) and I like the idea of being focused on Privacy, it has a nice UI and I can see the quality work that was put in place to have this done. 

I note you said that this is not PECR compliant (Which would cause user privacy concerns), as this uses an unknown cookie. Are you able to say when this will be addressed as I would really like to start using this in production? I am running an E-Commerce Store and I want to make sure that privacy is key and I stopped using G Analytics when I saw this system, that is how serious I am about "Protecting User Data."

As I said I am not sure if this is the right place to post this, I am a bit new to GitHub and its usage.
Thanks!
I'm running a self-hosted instance of Fathom using the `usefathom/fathom:latest` image together with  a PostgreSQL DB using the `postgres:9.6-alpine` image.

Since 3 days ago the Fathom UI shows no metrics, and my logs are FULL of errors like this:
```
ERROR:  syntax error at or near ""<=/-*>x73hxddo', ... <LOADS_OF_OMITTED_IDS>
```
With a query so long it doesn't fit in a single line of logs, which appears to be caused by a huge list of IDs. The statements connected to this error appears to be this:
```sql
DELETE FROM pageviews WHERE id IN(<LOADS_OF_OMITTED_IDS>);
```
One thing I noticed that one of the IDs repeats itself over and over again.
The log file from just today is roughly 1.9 GB already.
Would be great to link a goal to a page so a conversion rate could be calculated i.e. goals/pageviews.

Would also be good to have funnels. I like the way Fullstory does funnels, you just select a list of pages (or goals I suppose).
According to all documentation I can find, `no-store` is the strongest "do not cache" `Cache-Control` header there is, and `no-cache` and `must-revalidate` are strictly weaker and will have no effect when `no-store` is present. Additionally, I cannot find any evidence that these other values are useful for backwards compatibility or older browsers, and `no-store` support appears to be universal. Lastly, webhint.io is specifically telling me that I should not use `must-revalidate`.
This fixes #287

I'm hosting fathom myself on a docker container and I see in the dashboard that it's captured some requests from localhost. (Probably my own activity during development)

Is there a way to blacklist localhost or any other specific host? I did go over some of the other issues and commits that seem to address this, but they don't seem to have applied in my case, or no longer work.
Would it be possible for the WordPress plugin to detect logged in admin accounts and not track those hits from displaying in Fathom?
Maybe even have options to pick which user levels are/aren't tracked?
Thanks
I am using docker-compose and traefik to run fathom.

my docker-compose.yml

```yml
version: '3'

networks:
  web:
    external: true

services:
  fathom:
    restart: always
    image: usefathom/fathom:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - "FATHOM_SERVER_ADDR=:8080"
      - "FATHOM_GZIP=true"
      - "FATHOM_DEBUG=false" 
      - "FATHOM_DATABASE_DRIVER=postgres"
      - "FATHOM_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postrgress-user:postgress-passwd@db.ondigitalocean.com:25060/fathom?sslmode=require"
      - "FATHOM_SECRET=a-secret-key"
    networks:
      - web
    container_name: fathom
    labels:
      - "traefik.docker.network=web"
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:fathom.my_domain.com,www.fathom.my_domain.com"
      - "traefik.port=8080"
      - "traefik.backend=fathom-analytics"
```

when I run `docker-compose up` I get this...
```sh
Starting fathom ... done
Attaching to fathom
fathom    | time="2019-08-17T23:58:12Z" level=info msg="Fathom version 1.2.1+43-gb278944, commit b27894431395fed2053b2c9b92340a4a73b05319, built at "

fathom    | time="2019-08-17T23:58:12Z" level=info msg="Connected to postgres database: fathom.db"
```

which is weird be cause I do have a `.env` file

```yaml
FATHOM_SERVER_ADDR=8080
FATHOM_GZIP=true
FATHOM_DEBUG=false
FATHOM_DATABASE_DRIVER=postgres
FATHOM_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postrgress-user:postgress-passwd@db.ondigitalocean.com:25060/fathom?sslmode=require
FATHOM_SECRET=a-secret-key
```

So I ran `docker-compose up -d` and after it finished I ran `docker exec fathom ./fathom --config=/home/doc/fathom/.env server`

and I got this...
```sh
time="2019-08-18T00:02:42Z" level=info msg="Fathom version 1.2.1+43-gb278944, commit b27894431395fed2053b2c9b92340a4a73b05319, built at "

time="2019-08-18T00:02:42Z" level=fatal msg="listen tcp :8080: bind: address already in use"
```

Am I doing something wrong here?
Greetings fellows,


thank you for a nice OSS project. I am setting it up and noticed a small issue in Heroku setup docs.
This PR is fixing it.


Best,
