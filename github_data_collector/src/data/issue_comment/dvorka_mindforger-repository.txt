If you use a link with space (e. g. path to file / folder on the filesystem or the file- or foldername) then you must mask the spaces with %20.

Example in Windows:
Path: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" 

In Markdown Syntax
``  [Start Internet Explorer](C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Internet%20Explorer/iexplore.exe) ``
When i try opening mindforger with the current directory using the command `mindforger.exe .`, I get an error saying `Unknown option: disable-web-security.`

OS: Windows 10

However, opening mindforger without any args works correctly.
Thanks for Mindforger, have it installed here for some time but did not really start using it much, today looked a bit again and discovered how useful it could be if knowledge graph navigator could be navigated using single keys, a..z, if you know Vimperator, a firefox plugin, hitting f there, gives you a list of choices, hitting those keys will just navigate there. Something like this here could be great, if not too difficult. Just wanted to share this idea quickly here. Thanks for the great work, will check it from time to time always. 

As a side note: I am not much .md user, instead org-mode user with .org files, but it is possible to export them as .md, then I can continue with MindForger. An internal .org to .md converter inside MindForger could be interesting maybe as well, from my point, then I can forget the inbetween converting step, because editing those in MindForger would have side effects, thus I would never edit in MindForger, if you do not want to add one more problem to your chain. :)
Anyway to increase the global fontsize for the application in windows? 
The only option available is to edit the html fontsize
When I create a repository using Linux or Mac (I use google drive to sync between devices) I can't read it when I use my windows laptop. My guess is that is something related to filenames or paths. I can use without problems in both Linux and Mac machines.
Since Notes are already represented by hash-sections, it would be nice if one would be able to split a too-large-note into subnotes by adding additional lines prepended by "#" and then saving the changes.
Currently, this only space-indents these lines to avoid parsing errors.
It's difficult to change the note name field with the keyboard, also, a changed name is only updated when clicking "Remember", not when using <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd>.

In most Markdown renderers, the first-level section maps to a h1 html element, which by html-spec should only be present once and usually also is a document title.

Since the h1-Section is easier to edit together with the other text, I'd suggest using the first h1 of each saved document as its title.

(For document renaming, a link replace mechanism to avoid broken links in other documents might be necessary either way, otherwise the names will start to differ from the contents as the users will avoid renaming notes even when changing their contents.)
The documentation mentions a "Markdown Preview", but I can only find the view and edit modes. A preview of the note currently being edited as a side-by-side-view (like hackmd.io, for example) would be nice. For long notes, a scroll synchronization mechanism might be necessary.
Lists and code excerpts in markdown rely on indentation; which can profit from two features:

a) Keep Indent:
When starting a new line, the new line should begin with the same indent as the first line above that contains text. This avoid's the need to reindent each line manually.

b) Indent Refactoring:
To refactor lists, a user usually needs to (de-)indent the code in the list levels below; usually via <kbd>Tab</kbd>/<kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> on marked text in most IDEs. Currently, this just replaces the marked text with a tab.
A dark theme for the markdown renderer would be nice.
