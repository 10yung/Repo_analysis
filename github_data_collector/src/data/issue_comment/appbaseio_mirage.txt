During 'npm install' I have the following error:

> node scripts/install.js
Downloading binary from https://github.com/sass/node-sass/releases/download/v3.13.1/win32-x64-72_binding.node
Cannot download "https://github.com/sass/node-sass/releases/download/v3.13.1/win32-x64-72_binding.node"

I checked - in v3.13.1 indeed there is no win32-x64-72_binding.node release. Last one is win32-x64-51_binding.node

How can I fix the error?
When I run a query, a modal opens with the results. For some reason, when this modal is open, the scrollbar functionality of the browser is partially disabled. I can still scroll through the results using the mouse wheel, or page up/down, but I am unable to move the browser's scrollbar by clicking on it. This is mildly annoying with a small result set since it breaks expected behavior, and incredibly annoying on a large result set since if I say, want to scroll back up to the top from being near the bottom it takes ages. Also there's no graphical way to close the modal without scrolling all the way to the top to click that x -- ESC works but that wasn't obvious to me and may not be obvious to others.

So in conclusion, it would be cool if the scrollbar could work consistently with the standard behavior of scrollbars everywhere. Thanks :)
Because Elasticsearch API has been changed mainly because of the [removal of types](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/removal-of-types.html) since version 7, mirage is currently completely unable to be applied in elastic practice with Elasticsearch 7.
This is the cause of #16

Reproduction steps:
- Install mirage as an extension or run it locally.
- Provide an AWS-hosted ElasticSearch cluster URL and index.
- Note in the web inspector of your choice that the request to `${host}/${index}/_mapping` includes an `Authorization` header, which causes the request to fail.
- This Authorization header should not be sent.
Regarding https://github.com/appbaseio/mirage/issues/32.  Could you be more specific about how I might "trivially replace the host name of the shared URL"? Do you mean under the share icon on the far left? I can edit, but it doesn't save my changes.

I've gone with the chrome extension for both dejavu and mirage, so how do I get them to point to each other instead of appbase.io?
Using the current version 0.8.0 of the Mirage Chrome Extension, whenever the checkbox "Add joining quere" is selected and "nested" is selected from the "select-joining-query" dropdown, the generated query changes to `{}` instead of generating the nested query wrapper.

Tested on Chrome Canary 70.0.3524.0.
Hello,

First of all, thank for you great application. It helps me everyday working with ES:) I'm working with Mirage in chrome(as an extension). I can modify query manually, bet every change in gui, resets my changes to output fields (e.g."_source": ["user", "message", ...] according to this post https://stackoverflow.com/a/9605566/1615070 )

Is there possibility to add in Mirage button with "output" where I can define which fields should be returned by ES?
When selecting a numeric field, the option for `term` and `terms` query should show as they are applicable. However, we currently don't show them.
URL params doesn't support `distance` field in case of geodistance queries.

Is there a recommended approach for updating the dejuvu "Data View" url to a local docker instance of dejavu?
