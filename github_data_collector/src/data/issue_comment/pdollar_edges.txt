Fixed the problem in #21. This error is common in new version of MATLAB. 
Tested in following settings:
- windows 10, MATLAB 2019a, using Visual Studio Community 2019
- Ubuntu 18.04, MATLAB 2019a using gcc version 7.4.0
Dear @pdollar or anyone :)

First of all @pdollar thanks for your contribution. Secondly, in more detailed info, I would like to know-how is the AP computed?  

Cheers

Hi!
Thanks pdollar for this excellent work. I'm trying to run edgesDemo.m, before that, I install it as Installation in readme.txt. 
But when the program running to the 25 line in edgesDemo.m, it call the edgesDetect.m, and then edgesDetect call the edgesChns.m, in 58 lines in edgesChns.m, it call **gradientMag.cpp**, and Matlab was down. I have tried several times and it is same.
Help!

The environment I use:
Mac OS Mojave 10.14 5
Matlab 2017
Xcode Clang++ to configure mex


Could anyone please tell me the meaning of maxDist parameter? 
I am confused about the function of correspondPixels().And there is a compiled lib so I can't see code. Can you give some  explanation about it?
Thank you 
Hi,pdollar.
I try train tree myself,but it alaways have the error:
Unable to read file 'BSR/BSDS500/data//groundTruth/train/Thumb.mat'. No such file or directory.
PS:when I reduce the number of the patch,it run ok.I guess if it is related to the number of data?
can you help me?thanks a lot
How to get this code run for grayscale images? @pdollar

I am able to train the Structured Forest using the BSDS500 image dataset. But I am confused with the ground truth label in this directory `BSR/BSDS500/data/groundTruth/train`.

For each image, the groundTruth label in `.mat` format consists of **6** struct with 2 fields: (Segmentation and Boundaries).  

**Question 1:**
I don't understand why we have 6 labels for each image. Isn't it more natural to have one label (one struct) per image?

**Question 2:**
And also, If I want to train my own dataset, how can I setup my own ground truth label (both Segmentation and Boundaries)?

Thanks.
Hi, thanks a lot for your works.
i want to use the model to predict the boundary(edges) from depth image, your github page says it is aviable on internet,but i cant find it .So where can i find that model?
