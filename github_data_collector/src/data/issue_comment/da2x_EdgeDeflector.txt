Hello!
I am using Windows 10 x64 Build 1903 with Google Chrome Version 79.0.3945.130 (Official Build) (64-bit). EdgeDeflector version 1.1.3.0

Additional settings do not get saved by the extension.
For example I enable "open website" and select Apply to all Bing searches. 
It shows the message "preferences saved"

But after a reload they are again empty and take no effect on the app.

Also the radiobutton on "Apply to searches" doesn't work correctly, I can select both options:

Would appreciate any assistance, thx.

Dear **Daniel**, I'm not a Windows/C# programmer and I don't use Visual Studio _and that's why I couldn't build the project correctly_.

Could you add an instruction on building a project as an installed file? Or tell me how to do it.

**_I want to change the image of the application_** (`Icon.ico`) to a more appropriate one for me.

I use Visual Studio 2019 on Windows 10.
Type = System.URIFormatException
{"Invalid URI: The hostname could not be parsed"}
Locals for the method (this, uri, dontEscape, uriKind, err, e)
Error is in UriExt.cs - CreateThis

 ```

        //
        private void CreateThis( string uri , bool dontEscape , UriKind uriKind ) {
            // if (!Enum.IsDefined(typeof(UriKind), uriKind)) -- We currently believe that Enum.IsDefined() is too slow 
            // to be used here.
            if( (int)uriKind < (int)UriKind.RelativeOrAbsolute || (int)uriKind > (int)UriKind.Relative ) {
                throw new ArgumentException( SR.GetString( SR.net_uri_InvalidUriKind , uriKind ) );
            }

            m_String = uri == null ? string.Empty : uri;

            if( dontEscape )
                m_Flags |= Flags.UserEscaped;

            ParsingError err = ParseScheme(m_String, ref m_Flags, ref m_Syntax);
            UriFormatException e;

            InitializeUri( err , uriKind , out e );
            if( e != null )
                throw e;
        }

Stack Trace:


When typing in a "random word" in the search bar this leads to http://random word/ rather than e.g. an automatic redirect to a Google search for "random word". How do I fix this?
Would be nice to be able to temporarily disable EdgeDeflector without having to uninstall then reinstall (or hack the registry).
Get us a link to send you a beer. Or pizza.  or some other donation.  You've earned it.
i have done everthing from installing and reinstalling to rebooting my computer changing preferences and stuff.
teh problem is that everything shows up how it should, but when i search in cortana nothing happens it just loads and thats it
*Don't look at the commits before Spe 06 (I reverted them because you can only fork a repository once and I followed a optional install option for a search machine changer plugin) .*

I improved the (NSIS) installer:
* New UI (MUI 2)
* Icons for Installer and Uninstaller
* Create on install start menu shortcut to later unistall EdgeDeflector
* Images on install and uninstall
* Remove all directories where something was written on uninstall
* Open website after installation dialog was closed
* Made the install process multilingual

I compiled the `.nsi` script with NSIS 2.3.3.
