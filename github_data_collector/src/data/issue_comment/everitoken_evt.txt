Currently we've used cache in the layer of RocksDB of token database. The cache in RocksDB is called block cache which stores some pieces of SST table data into memory. But it's needed to have an objects cache which stores the instances at token database level. Because when reading object from token database, it needs to deserialize binary data into object data. And it takes some time especially for the complex type like `passive_bonus`.
1. Support partition in postgres (uses `pg_pathman`).
    - Build `pg_pathman` into `postgres` docker image. Currently we use image from bitnami, maybe we need to build our one.
    - Update sql to create partition.
2. Improve query performance
    - Analysis current query sql to find the complex queries and add necessary indexes.
    - Analysis partition performance impact.
3. Support all the actions: Currently `postgres_plugin` don't support all the actions(e.g. lock, bonus, suspend) processing.
`breakpad` is used to produce minicore file when encountering crash and debug symbols will be uploaded to S3 when building Docker image. It's needed to have one script to support the whole process when a crash is produced:

1. Use `breakpad` client to get the `hash` of crashed `evtd` program.
2. Download the debug symbols from S3 according to the `hash`.
3. Use `breakpad` to produce the detail crash stack.
Bonus is one of main features will added to the v3.0. And there're two parts: passive bonus and active bonus. Passive bonus will be first implemented.
