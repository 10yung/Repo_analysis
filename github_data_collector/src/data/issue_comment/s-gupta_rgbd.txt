I'm confused for a long time, and I can't find the code for this operation.Could anybody help me?THANKS!!!
Couldn't find the splits that you use for train vs. val -- could you please post them? Thanks!
if(a ~= 0)
    fprintf('.');
		% For some reason the bilateral filtering library crashes on some inputs, remove outlier points!
		maxRefI = prctile(linIt(refI(:,:,4)), 98);
		refI(:,:,4) = min(refI(:,:,4), maxRefI);
		minRefI = prctile(linIt(refI(:,:,4)), 2);
		refI(:,:,4) = max(refI(:,:,4), minRefI);
		out = jointBilateral(refI, I, sigma1, sigma2);
	else
% 		% Read back the results
		out = isRead(f{3});

Can you tell me how to remove outlier points? matlab crashed when i run this part. Thanks. @s-gupta 
Respected Sir,
I have read your research paper "Perceptual Organization and Recognition of Indoor Scenes from RGB-D Images". 

I want to implement this code on my own data. I have kinect sensor.

I want to ask that how to get RGB-D image from kinect with color image and point clouds.?

I mean which tool is used to get it from kinect sensor.?

I am waiting for your response.

Regards
Error using feat_txt2mat (line 14)
wrong feature file!

Error in runAll (line 58)

The Liblinear dense version is just for windows and does not compile under linux, if I want to run the rgbd in linux operating system centOS, what should I do? 

Thanks
Ayesha
