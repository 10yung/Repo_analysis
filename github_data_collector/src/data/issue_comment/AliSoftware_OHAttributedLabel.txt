here is my code:
OHParagraphStyle\* paragraphStyle = [OHParagraphStyle defaultParagraphStyle];
    paragraphStyle.lineSpacing = 0;
    paragraphStyle.textAlignment=kCTJustifiedTextAlignment;
    [attributedString setParagraphStyle:paragraphStyle range:NSMakeRange(0, attributedString.length)];
    cell.bodyOHAttributedLabel.attributedText = attributedString;

When trying to add custom font this method

``` ruby
-(void)setFontName:(NSString*)fontName size:(CGFloat)size range:(NSRange)range
```

Throws error.

Note, that simple UILabel gets this custom font well

When I pass a string with special characters such as 'Ã¡nime', and then call [OHASBasicMarkupParser processMarkupInAttributedString:myNSMutableAttributedString]; the highlighted link does not get created.

Thanks and great library.


attributedText is not presenting Hindi in iOS6

Xcode 5 analyzer warns about a potential leak of `currentFont` in `NSAttributedString+Attributes.m` [here](https://github.com/AliSoftware/OHAttributedLabel/blob/master/OHAttributedLabel/Source/NSAttributedString%2BAttributes.m#L242).

> OHAttributedLabel/Source/NSAttributedString+Attributes.m:276:7: Potential leak of an object stored into 'currentFont'

It seems that a simple `CFRelease(currentFont)` would fix it.

If you create an OHAttributedLabel without a frame and position it using autolayout, it has 0 height. This is because when intrinsicContentSize is invoked, attributedText is not set in the UILabel superclass, so the label appears to be empty. Setting the attributedText on the UILabel superclass allows it to calculate the intrinsicContentSize, without any apparent side effects.

I have used your great framework (latest update) in my app. I used its markup parser to detect special words and show its synonym.

but after touching some words it crashes suddenly with this strange error in device console: 
<Error>: libMobileGestalt copySystemVersionDictionaryValue: Could not lookup ReleaseType from system version dictionary

in Xcode 5 it doesnt crash soon. (maybe because of enough ram on my macBook).

but in both it crashes.

here is an screenshot of xcode:

it doesnt show any error related to my code. it is memmory related error. how can I solve it?

Setting the text color on links in 3.4.3 works as expected, so this must be a new bug.

Here's the code I am using.

```
NSMutableAttributedString* addressStr = /*...*/;
NSRange someRange = /* range */;
[addressStr setLink:[NSURL URLWithString:@"location://store"] range:someRange];
[addressStr setTextColor:[UIColor clearColor] range:someRange];
addressStr.userInteractionEnabled = NO;
```

I do have custom cell having UILabels one for  text and second for translation. I want to assign attributed text to that translation label without allocating in cellForRowAtindexPath. Is there any option to do some thing like this
# import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

 #import <OHAttributedLabel/OHAttributedLabel.h>

@interface SelectedSurahCell : UITableViewCell
@property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet OHAttributedLabel *aayat;
@property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet UILabel *translation;

@end

and table view controller I want to do 

 cell.aayat = (OHAttributedLabel*)[cell.aayat viewWithTag:kAttributedLabelTag];
 cell.aayat.frame =  CGRectMake(0, 0, 275, height);
[cell.aayat setAttributedText: [ self AttributedString: ayatText ] ];

its doesn't set text to custom cell 

Please give me any suggestion. Thanks in advance
