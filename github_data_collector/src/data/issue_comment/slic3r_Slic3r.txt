### slic3r version 1.3.0
### Windows 10 
### Behavior
on top and bottom layer, when using adaptative quality , the layer height evolves as it should (I presume) but I also get a layer thickness evolution that is weird:
only the very top and bottom layers has 100% width, but the 3 others (out of 4 in my configuration if I remember, or maybe 2 out of 3 top/bottom layers...) has a very small width (see in the sliced file).

What is it happening?

#### STL/Config (.ZIP) where problem occurs
_Upload a zipped copy of an STL and your config (`File -> Export Config`)_

Add a new printer profile for M3D Micro which needs minor differences to all the existing printer profiles to print the generated G-code. Builds with all existing tests passing on my Debian Buster. Have tested a few printouts which works on the M3D Micro.
A feature for gradient infill would be great:

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I am struggling to create a 2 material 3D print using Slic3r. When I attempt to export the gcode I get an error saying 'Some objects are too close; your extruder will collide with them'. As far as I understand this is due to a hull being generated around both objects but is there a way to disable this check or to generate a hull around the two objects?

**Describe the solution you'd like**
If anyone can suggest a way around this it would be greatly appreciated! Please also do try to give as much detail as possible as I am a beginner with the software and with 3D printing.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I have been able to print this structure using two materials with the Ultimaker 5 so practically I don't think the structures are too close together. However I need to be able to print this using the custom printer we have available which has been setup with the Slic3r software.

**Additional context**


**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Leaky extruders combined with a stringy filament make using a skirt for priming the extruder difficult. When it first starts extruding, there is a string of filament that doesn't adhere to the bed, possibly laying in the print zone, disturbing the actual print.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A simple purge line is the best way to get around this issue. It is easily implemented too--all that is needed would be a third option next to brim and skirt with a few parameters such as position and speed settings.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
My printer is calibrated, so the problem can't be fixed by tuning. I used to snip off the string while printing, which is not an optimal solution.

Right now, I'm using a purge line per custom g-code:
```M82 ; Extruder in absolute mode
G28; Home extruder
G1 X0 Y0 Z5 F{Z_TRAVEL_SPEED}
M107 ; Turn off fan
G90 ; Absolute positioning
M104 S150  ; start extruder heating
M190 S[first_layer_bed_temperature] ; set bed temp
M140 S[first_layer_bed_temperature]  ;wait for bed temp
M109 S[first_layer_temperature_0]  ; Wait for all used extruders to reach temperature
G92 E0 ; Reset extruder position
G1 X5 Y5 Z0.25 F1000.0 ; go intro start pos
G1 X60.0 E9.0 F600.0 ; intro line to prime extruder
G1 X100.0 E16 F800.0 ; intro line
G92 E0.0 ; reset extruder distance position
```
On macOS, when you have multiple Settings tabs open, if you make a change on one tab and save your settings, switching to another tab requires multiple "Save" operations to actually save the changes because Slic3r hasn't recognized that the additional change(s) took place.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open multiple settings tabs for one print job. For example, open the Print Settings and Filament Settings tabs.
2. Make a change on the Print Settings tab and Save
3. Switch to the Filament Settings tab and make a change
4. Note that the word "(modified)" does NOT appear in the setting title
5. Save your change
6. Make another change on the Filament Settings tab
7. Note that the word "(modified)" appears in the setting title
8. Save your change

If you quit Slic3r between steps 5 and 6, then reopen it, you will see that your setting was NOT saved. Likewise, if you process a model to generate gcode without performing steps 6, 7 and 8, you will find that the new setting has not applied. Under this particular scenario, it appears as though Slic3r has not recognized that a change has taken place, and a "Save" that doesn't actually save anything is required to provide that recognition.

**3D Model and Slic3r Configuration Export**
This is not model-specific, nor does it have anything to do with my configuration.

**Expected behavior**
When I make a settings change and hit the Save button, I expect for my settings to be saved every time!

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: macOS Mojave 10.14.6
 - Version: 1.3.0

**Additional context**
Not a lot of context should be needed. This is quite clearly a bug, and it's 100% reproducible.

This is a very obvious bug, and I assumed that someone had already reported it, but I could not find it in the Issues list.

Related to https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/issues/4909
**Describe the bug**
The complexity of your implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm is O(n^2). It can be implemented with a complexity of O(n log n) using a priority queue/min heap instead of an array.

**To Reproduce**
Have a look here: https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/blob/354b6230bdea90b50b1c422a8da94c1f59313954/lib/Slic3r/GCode/MotionPlanner.pm#L253

**Expected behavior**
The implementation should have O(n log n) complexity

Btw why do you use Perl? C++ has a lot of well-implemented data structures and is way more efficient

during my installation i`ll get the following message:

--> Working on Wx::build::MakeMaker

Don't worry, this module is optional.
The following prerequisites failed to install: Wx

i tried to install on my win10 and ubuntu-orangepie and i get the same failure on both..

the logfile says that 'WX' is not a known MakeMaker parameter name.

can anyone help

**Describe the bug**
I downloaded Slic3r-1.3.0.64bit.zip. I unzipped the file. When I double click on Slic3r.exe, I receive the error in the title.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to folder the zip file was unzipped to.
2. Double Click on Slic3r.exe
3. See error dialog box.

**3D Model and Slic3r Configuration Export**
Please upload a ZIP archive containing a copy of the 3D model you are seeing this bug with and a CTRL-E export of the configuration used.
I cannot do this since I cannot even start the application.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
I expect the application to open so I can load an stl file and slice it.
