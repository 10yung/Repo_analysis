When I set the gravity of image, and scroll the page quickly, it not appear properly.


this is before scrolling quickly:

Is it possible to use this `Behavior`, while having the `Toolbar` pinned to the top? I'd like to be able to use the "quick return" toolbar, but with my `ImageView` shrinking into it. I've been playing with layouts all week, but the only time it works is if my layout is *exactly* like the one in the example.

I'm also not really following the `Behavior` code enough to adapt it, but it seems to me like the custom attributes aren't even really being used correctly, if at all.

How does this work?
For this example if you directly add `onOptionsItemSelected` it will not work. To solve this you need to add one line of code:
```
...
mToolbar.inflateMenu(R.menu.menu_main);
// add this line
setSupportActionBar(mToolbar);
...
```
And now it works! But the default title is annoying, so add another line to remove default title.
```
...
mToolbar.inflateMenu(R.menu.menu_main);
// add this line
setSupportActionBar(mToolbar);
setTitle("");
...
```
Cheers!
Hi
I am developing app in which I am having a view similar to Instagram
(https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35765225/35329279-4444b0ee-00f7-11e8-8408-95c6d0bfb04d.jpeg)
I want a scrolling effect similar to instagram.
When it is scrolled up its working perfectly fine,the above view is auto-collapsing.
But when i am clicking on any item in recyclerview I want the above auto collapsed view should expand that i achieved from
appbar.setExpanded(true)
But when it is expanding it is scrolling the recyclerview also.I don't want the recyclerview to scroll with it.The clicked item should be on top like instagram.
Please Help.

In using API 25, the AvatarImageBehavior doesnt really work well. I always get this when i quickly scroll up.

I run with this config:
compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.3.1'
compile 'com.android.support:design:25.3.1'
compile 'com.android.support:cardview-v7:25.3.1'

But changing to this project's config (using 23.2.1), the behavior works perfectly.

Sorry for my question. I'm a total beginner in using CoordinatorLayout. Thank you!
