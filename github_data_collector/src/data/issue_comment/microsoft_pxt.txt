The instructions for setting up a workspace (as given on url: https://makecode.com/cli) fail at the following step:

Failure is a lengthy cascade of warnings and error messages. Console output is provided in the attached file:

None. However, the entire error log is provided in this attached file:

Enable the code toolbox in Python.

This issue is for tracking the experimental feature.
Repro:
1. open two tabs of arcade.makecode.com
2. in each one, open the debug tools
3. open a new project in each one
4. notice the "trying to access outdated session" assert (or warning) fires

It looks like the local storage code was written with the assumption that only one tab would be accessing it. This is definitely not true for many of our users. We should ensure the property consistency is implemented.
On arcade.makecode.com (live) I saw:

https://makecode.com/_5RLcLs65j6Af

and the page never reloaded. Console output attached.

Still testing perf. Use JSON.parse('...') instead of pure javascript.
