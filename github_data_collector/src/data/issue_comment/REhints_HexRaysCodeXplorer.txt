Building latest master with Visual Studio 2017 (SDK 10.0.17134.0) with IDA Pro and Hex-Rays x64 7.2. Builds fine (after adding defines as per issue #74 ) with IDA SDK 7.3, but doesn't load:

```
LoadLibrary(C:\Program Files\IDA 7.2\plugins\HexRaysCodeXplorer.dll) error: The specified procedure could not be found.
C:\Program Files\IDA 7.2\plugins\HexRaysCodeXplorer.dll: can't load file
```

Any ideas?
Hey can you please:
1. add Ida 7 support
2. add automatically analyze of struct? like solve this Ida line: `*(&v15 + some_var - 77) = *(&v15 + some_var - 76) - *(&v15 + some_var - 77);`  to a normal strucr?  
Right now when vtable is created with function pointers if you press "Y" you see that the type is empty.
Please consider setting type of each pointer in vtable struct to it's  corresponding function type. This will allow decompiler to use correct number of parameters in each virtuall function call, since not always correct number of args i guessed correctly.
