Dear Dr. Hiroyuki Kasai

I hope you are well. Recently I have been using your program nmf_sparse of NMFLibrary for doing some research, and it's very well for running, many thanks to your comtributions. But I failed to find anything about the citation to this program of nmf_sparse from the GitHub website. Could you tell me about the citation about it if you don't mind?
I look forward to your reply!
Many thanks!

Yours sincerely, 
Xelawk
