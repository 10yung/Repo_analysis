It would be really awesome if we could add a feature to log **if the computer is locked or not**. -Or- we could choose to not logging the windws/application while the computer is locked out. 

Hi, thanks for the awesome app!
Just wondering if it is possible for the app to track unused apps as opposed to apps that are being used currently. 

Thanks!
I'm trying to run thyme in Ubuntu terminal:

```
$ ./thyme-linux-386 track -o thyme.out
xdpyinfo failed with error: exit status 1. Try running `xdpyinfo | grep dimensions` to diagnose.
2018/09/20 14:36:45 xdpyinfo failed with error: exit status 1. Try running `xdpyinfo | grep dimensions` to diagnose.

```
```

$ xdpyinfo | grep dimensions
xdpyinfo:  unable to open display "".

```
Since there are distributions that don't package wmctrl (e. g. Solus), a solution could be to run Thyme within a docker container.

I've created a PoC at https://github.com/r3r57/thyme-docker and if there's interest at all, I'll create a proper PR. 
It would be nice to see when the workstation has locked itself instead of the last used app being active
It looks like `thyme show -w stats` uses Google Charts to visualize the data. If I'm not mistaken, this means the data is sent to Google, right? I'd rather not have my window titles land there...
I haven't debugged this further, but a quick trial run indicates that thyme considers all windows on desktop -1 to be "visible".

The i3 window manager has a special buffer it calls "scratchpad" which contains windows which are not on any desktop. But `wmctrl -l` reports them as being on desktop -1, so they are always "visible".

(As a secondary point, when using multiple windows in a tabbed container, it seems like arguably only the active one should be considered "visible", but this seems much harder to implement.)
Hi! I've been trying to install Thyme on Ubuntu 17.10 but the command `go get -u github.com/sourcegraph/thyme/cmd/thyme` doesn't seem to work, it doesn't output anything. 

I installed Go version 1.8.3 via `sudo apt-get install golang-go golang-go.tools` and `go env` output is:
```

Any ideas on what might be wrong and how to fix it? Many thanks!
This is likely an iTerm issue and not a Thyme issue, but I'm putting it here in case other people have the same problem. 

I've just upgraded iTerm to Build 3.1.beta.5, and I am getting the "you didn't do the thing in thyme dep" error. Before this upgrade it worked fine, and thyme continues to work in Terminal just fine.

Not sure if there's anything to be done on your folks end, but there it is. 
Thanks! 
Is there support for wayland in this?
