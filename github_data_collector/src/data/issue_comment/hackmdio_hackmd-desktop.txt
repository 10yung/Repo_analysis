Hi, first of all, thanks for your awesome program.

I'm currently using `hackmd-desktop` to take notes of a book in pdf. 

So my workflow is to switch to the pdf viewer to change page and come back to hackmd. The issue here is that when the program regains focus it doesn't enter in edit mode or command mode (I'm using the vi layout). I have to click the window with the mouse so I can start using again the vi bindings.

If you use a tiling window manager (such as i3wm) it's a real bummer to have to reach the mouse just for that.

Is there any easy way to fix this?

Thank you!
It would be great to have an embedded HackMD server included so that we can edit offline/in our own sandbox, without needing to manually manage a HackMD server.
Hello,
Could you create a portable version for Windows based on @PortableApps format?
[PortableApps](https://www.portableApps.com) is one of the best application suites for Windows out there.
It will be great for Windows users.

@2wayne, Any chance for assistance with that?

Thank You.
So far hackmd-desktop needs opening new windows to load another document.
Will hackmd team consider using the tab to open multiple files (remaining single window) in the future?
Thanks!
[PDFObject](https://github.com/pipwerks/PDFObject) is not working on electron.

There's a electron pdf.js example: https://github.com/seanchas116/electron-pdfjs

We can try to integrate pdf.js using electron webview api.

Or more aggressively, replace pdfobject package in hackmd.
