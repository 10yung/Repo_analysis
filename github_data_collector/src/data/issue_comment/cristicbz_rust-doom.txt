Not sure whether this is along the lines of where you want to take this project, but I've been wanting a proper tool for taking the kinds of level shots on this page:

http://ian-albert.com/games/doom_maps

(but for a program that's open source, actively maintained, more flexible, eventually works with vanilla PWADs etc)

Here's what it seems like such a command would entail:
- use an ortho view projection instead of perspective
- disable distance-diminished lighting (but still draw sector lighting)
- zoom and position view to frame level extents + a margin
- write screenshot to image at a resolution proportional to world scale (something like the maps linked above, ie larger maps result in larger images, up to a reasonable maximum) - not sure if this is easy to get to from a non-offline renderer like this one, though

Again, no idea if this is something you find interesting and/or want to do with this project, but I think lots of people in the Doom community would find this useful. Users could probably even rig it up into an auto-generated map generator for doomwiki + the idgames archive.

This project is really cool, keep up the good work!
