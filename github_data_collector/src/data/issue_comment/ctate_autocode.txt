Homepage on GitHub still says https://autocode.run/ but looks like it's now https://autocode.readme.io/

Grunt is popular, and I give it much respect.  However, Gulp has always “felt” easier to grok for me, because it functions like shell pipelines.  

(Supposedly, a nice side effect is that it runs significantly faster, too, because Grunt prefers to physical files for each task’s I/O, whereas Gulp is fine with piping stuff around without creating files for the intermediate steps.  This makes sense to me, but I can’t say that I _know_ it’s true because don’t have tons of experience with either of them.  I just know that when I have to work with a build system, Gulp is easier for me to understand and work with.)

So, how bout some Gulp support? :D

Gentlefolk,

The Autocode website asks me to log in with Github and then it wants permission to manipulate my private repos. WoW. I declined the opportunity. Why does Autocode need such privileged access? If they are not necessary, please don't request the permissions.

Anon,

I just ran the following:

```
$ brew info autocode
autocode: stable 0.20.3 (bottled)
Code automation for every language, library and framework
https://crystal.sh/autocode
Not installed
From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/autocode.rb
==> Dependencies
Required: node ✔

$ npm -g info autocode@latest version
1.0.3
```

Could you configure autocode so that when there’s a new release, the Homebrew repo gets a Pull Request with the updated formula?

I am trying autocode for the first time.  

I ran `autocode init`, then added some stuff so that `config.yml` looks like this:

``` yaml
name: autocode-docpad-redux-test
version: 8.0.0-pre-alpha
description: ...
copyright: 2015 Zearin
license: mit
imports:
    crystal/crystal-readme: ~0.2.5
    crystal/editorconfig: ~0.1.0
    crystal/coffeescript: ~0.4.0
```

However, when I ran `autocode config`, I get this error:

```
$ autocode config
Configuration failed validation:
[ { message: 'Failed "type" criteria: expecting object, found null',
    context: '#/imports',
    value: null,
    criteria: { type: 'object', additionalProperties: [Object] },
    toString: [Function: errorToString] } ]
Invalid Configuration for path: /Users/amrogers/Developer/Projects/autocode-test
```

I have a vague notion that the issue is somewhere in my `imports` statement, but I have no idea what the issue is.  

Here’s an example error message that I would prefer to see instead:

```
Invalid Configuration for path: /Users/amrogers/Developer/Projects/autocode-test
Configuration failed validation:
    On line 6, `imports` is missing the following properties: 
        - «key1» 
        - «key2»
        - «key3»
```

I want to create a module for building a part of my own projects. So I want putting this module in other places rather than publishing it to the Crystal Hub. And I can install it from a custom url.

``` bash
> autocode search crystal/readme                                                                                                                            
Searching for generators matching name (crystal/readme)...
undefined is not a function
```

Version:
node v0.12.2
npm 2.13.3
autocode-cli@0.21.1

"Module does not exist in the Crystal Hub." often happens. Is it my network problem?

Version:
node v0.12.2
npm 2.13.3
autocode-cli@0.21.1

``` bash
  231   cd /crystal
  232  ls
  233  tee > helloworld.js   # paste
  234  cat helloworld.js # yup
  235  node helloworld.js # test without crystal
  236  npm install crystal # install crystal
  237  ls # nothing
  238  node helloworld.js 
  239  ls # nothing
  240  ls # searchy searchy
  241  ls -al # lalalaa
  242  find | grep output #... ...
  243  find | .bin
  244  find | grep bin
  245  find | grep .bin
  246  hub clone crystal/crystal
```
