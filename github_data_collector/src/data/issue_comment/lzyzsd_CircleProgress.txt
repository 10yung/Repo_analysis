-> Sir I want to slow down animation of **ArcProgress** and I am using this code:

 **_ObjectAnimator animation = ObjectAnimator.ofInt(arc_progress, "progress", 0, 60);
        animation.setDuration(55 * 25);//25 for a fast but not to fast animation
        animation.setInterpolator(new DecelerateInterpolator());
        animation.start();_**

and I changed (55 * 10), but it is not slowing down.

-> And one more issue, when i restart my app it is not showing any animation (**I want to restart my animation on On Create**).
Please let me know how to show full text inside circle.
Like i have Hello world!!!
I have used your library its working good.But i want to apply gradient in filled part . How can i do this ?
Can you please create a Android X version
It's been a long day so I'm probably overlooking something obvious, but why is default_text_size defined twice in the constructor?

There is a small issue in displaying the textual percentage progress. The value returned by `getProgress()` is calculated based on modulus operator `%` which returns the remainder not the percent value. While assigning value to textual field, it should apply this formula `getProgress() * 100 / getMax()`.
This component does not support Android databinding. Any upcoming fix?
For changing central text, you should call setText("String") method. If this method isn't called, progress value would be set as default text. For resetting custom text and setting progress value you can call setDefaultText() method. Setting custom text does not affect progress value, it's only visual change for UI.
