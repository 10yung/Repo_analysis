...but seems dead?
Hi @harvesthq, @jkintscher, need any maintainers?

I was getting an error running Harvey in a browser environment without using a module loader.

So I added this at the top of the outmost anonymous closure:

```
var State, _mediaQueryList, TYPE_UNDEFINED = 'undefined';
```

That fixed the error. I am happy to open a PR, if you prefer.

Thanks!

Respond.js is required for bootstrap to work with IE8. From: http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support

> "Internet Explorer 8 and 9 are also supported, however, please be aware that some CSS3 properties and HTML5 elements are not fully supported by these browsers. In addition, Internet Explorer 8 requires the use of Respond.js to enable media query support."

However, if we add Respond.js we get a Javascript error from Harvey:

Hi!

I added some files to the demo folder to help web developers understand to which kind of device they're designing depending on the screen size.
It's a simple guide, but I think it would really help beginners.

It'd be nice to have a `package.json` and `bower.json` in here so we can painlessly use Harvey in our projects. Additionally, it'd be great to support require.js and commonJS via a [umdjs](https://github.com/umdjs/umd/blob/master/amdWebGlobal.js) wrapper.

If you guys are open to this, let me know and I can work on this myself.
