ControlPlane 1.6.7
MacOs Catalina 10.15.1

Content is detected properly, but Network Location is not switched/activated, in other words it is remaining in last selected network location.
When I visit https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/controlplane-support, I get the following message:

`This group either doesn't exist, or you don't have permission to access it. If you're sure this group exists, contact the Owner of the group and ask them to give you access.`

I see no mechanism to request access.  This URL is what the app provides when you click ControlPlane Support in Status Bar Icon menu.
Control Plane 1.6.7

Catalina 10.15.1 (19B88)

I have 2 separate possible ethernet connects - Thunderbolt Ethernet Slot 1 (part of a OWC Thunderbolt C Dock) and a Belkin USB-C LAN dongle.

The dock is new, previously if the dongle was active it would disable WiFi, and enable it again if the dongle was inactive.

What I am trying to achieve is that if EITHER ethernet connection is active, that WiFi be disabled, or if they are both inactive, Wifi is enabled.

I tried creating 2 rules - on/off - for each network connection source, but it seems to have given CP a headache because it just stops switching, and will only switch to the desired network state if I restart CP.
CP: 1.6.7
MacOS: Catalina 10.15 Beta (19A558d)

After upgrading to Catalina, the Nearby Wifi Network evidence source is greyed out in the Rules tab.

I also see these logs:
```
...
08:57:08.958 -[EvidenceSourceSetController startEvidenceSource:]
	Starting Power evidence source
08:57:08.959 -[EvidenceSourceSetController startEvidenceSource:]
	Starting ShellScript evidence source
08:57:08.962 -[WiFiEvidenceSourceCoreWLAN doUpdate]
	WiFi interface is active, but is not participating in a network yet (or network SSID is bad)
```
I recently created a rule using the light sensor on my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) running 10.14.4.

However, when I check the value with the lid closed (docked to an external monitor), I am getting a crazy value that indicates it is very very very bright when I would assume it should be dark.

As we know, there isn't any current development happening on ControlPlane. But it's still very useful for me. Unfortunately, the app tends to crash a couple of times a day, and I only notice when something that was supposed to automatically happen doesn't happen. So I found [this](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/953/14685) Stack Exchange post, and put together a LaunchCtl service which automatically relaunches ControlPlane when it crashes. I hope this is useful to someone. Name it `ControlPlane.restart.plist`, save it to `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, and launch it with `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ControlPlane.restart.plist`.

One very useful use-case would be to pause Spotify playing while you are in a meeting. 

I would measure "being in a meeting" as having an application running, in my case BlueJeans. When this application is running I want to tell Spotify to pause. 

Optionally I would like to resume it when the meeting application is quit.
The author has written a post in 2017 stating he needs help to keep this project going.

https://www.controlplaneapp.com/2017/11/the-state-of-controlplane/

I don't know Objective-C well enough to help, but wanted to put the link here (no one asked me to) since this project is great but is breaking more and more with every macOS release.
The ControlPlane icon does not appear in dark mode. It looks like support for dark mode with a light icon needs to be added.

I see a "high sierra fixes" branch, which contains various fixes. I hope it is possible to create a b√®ta release out of this branch? At least one issue is causing me trouble on a daily basis, and it seems to be fixed on that branch: "fix crash when displaying default browser dialog". I would really appreciate a version of Control Plane with that fix applied, even if it is not perfect.
