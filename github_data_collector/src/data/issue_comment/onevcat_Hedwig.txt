You have an awesome mail tool. I used it successfully with Vapor 1 with no difficulties.

I am upgrading to Vapor 2 and Hedwig has Vapor 1 dependencies and my vapor update get stuck.

I suspect some dependency loop but there may be a catch to fixing it as it might cause similar problems to Vapor 1 users.

I can fork and continue I suppose but you suggested opening an issue first.
when you have one invalidate email address in you cc list, you fail all.
```
[Hedwig] SMTP Error: bad response. bad response on command: RCPT TO: ****, response: Mailbox not found or access denied
```
So my SMTP server is listening on localhost and I chose .plain for the secure option.
Nonetheless, Hedwig tries to establish a TLS secured connection when the server supports it.
And that's where my crash occurs. One of the parameters you pass to TLS.Socket in your starttls method is nil and gets force unwrapped later. I hope that helps fixing the issue, but you should also consider changing the approach here. Why do you want to force a TLS connection just because the server supports it? Some people just want to connect to an SMTP server that is listening on the loopback adapter and I don't get the point of creating an encrypted connection to localhost.
