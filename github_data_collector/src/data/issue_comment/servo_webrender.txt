The last release was almost a year ago, and it seems like there's been some breaking changes since then, and a ton of work since then as well including important bugfixes.

I'm currently using a git revision because of how old the current release is, but if I ever want to publish my crate to crates.io it seems like I'd have to downgrade to an older version of webrender.
Wrench still depends on an older smallvec, this can be fixed if we update winit and glutin, but it's a bunch of work.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_trigonometry

I wonder if the finitist framework of rational trigonometry could allow some new optimizations.
More information at the wiki section "Computation – complexity and efficiency"

I don't have much knowledge about the subject but I (naively) wonder if it could be useful to webrender.
Otherwise, feel free to close the issue! 
Servo now contains a workaround for this that splits display items, but it's fragile (contains hardcoded limits), and I think it's probably best for WR to split up the runs itself.

More details:

https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/17230#issuecomment-564307277

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/25289#issuecomment-565666854
This removes the use of ipc-channel. I would love to remove the Serialize/Deserialize lies as well, but last time I tried to do that proved harder than I anticipated.
Now that derive_more 0.99 is out, derivative (through glutin, but latest glutin doesn't use derivative anymore) and serde_derive 1.0.88 are the only two remaining things that still depend on syn 0.15.
Method `peek_from_uninit` creates a `&mut T` where the `T` is uninitialised, this is UB AFAIK.

https://github.com/servo/webrender/blob/efec27697590b622a4cc67af31c3d695f920f80f/peek-poke/src/lib.rs#L33-L39
Under certain scenarios in Servo (see https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/23964, https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/21480) the `RenderBackend` thread might panick at [`HitTester::get_pipeline_root`](https://github.com/servo/webrender/blob/49ef7304c380ca0bd2a7590e7d7808487bbf5ef3/webrender/src/hit_test.rs#L509) with a `no entry found for key` message, due to the fact that at the time the function gets called `pipeline_id` is not in the `pipeline_root_nodes` hash map.

Having a check for containment would remove the panick. [`HitTester::get_pipeline_root`](https://github.com/servo/webrender/blob/49ef7304c380ca0bd2a7590e7d7808487bbf5ef3/webrender/src/hit_test.rs#L509) is only used in one single [place](https://github.com/servo/webrender/blob/49ef7304c380ca0bd2a7590e7d7808487bbf5ef3/webrender/src/hit_test.rs#L569), which makes it easy to change it return an `Option`. However, I'm not very familiar with webrender and whether this is an unrecoverable error or not.
