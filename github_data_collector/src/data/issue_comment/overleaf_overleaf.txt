<!-- BUG REPORT TEMPLATE -->

## Steps to Reproduce
<!-- Describe the steps leading up to when / where you found the bug. -->
<!-- Screenshots may be helpful here. -->

1. After a fresh install 
2. Open Sharelatex CE
3. Open a project (black or import)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6941618/71912775-7231f500-3176-11ea-94a6-989cb5b6fe76.png)

## Expected Behaviour
<!-- What should have happened when you completed the steps above? -->
Open the doc without errors ! :)

## Observed Behaviour
<!-- What actually happened when you completed the steps above? -->
<!-- Screenshots may be helpful here. -->
When I open a project, I have this error. When I change the file in the editor I get the same error.
But when I came back on the first file, Sharelatex open it without issue.
It seems that I have to open 2 times a file to open it without error.
It seems also that Sharelatex can compile without error.

## Technical Info

I'm using Docker on Synology NAS. I'm not using docker-compose file but I managed to get up and running 3 docker (Redis 5.0.7 / mongodb 4.2.2 / and Sharelatex 2.0.2 )

Please find the 3 docker config:

* Browser Name and version: Tested with Firefox 71, Chrome (?) and Edge (?)

* Project and/or file: New/Imported

## Analysis
<!--- Optionally, document investigation of / suggest a fix for the bug, e.g. 'comes from this line / commit' -->

I found this error in the real-time.log file:

```

This seems to point out the Redis installation but in the Sharelatex init it pass the check:

```
Checking can connect to mongo and redis
Running "check:redis" task
Checking can connect to redis
node_redis: Warning: Redis server does not require a password, but a password was supplied.
OK.
Done, without errors.
Running "check:mongo" task
Checking can connect to mongoOK.
Done, without errors.
All checks passed
```

I tried to clean all data from the 3 dockers with no luck.
Did you already encounter this ? It's been multiple days that I'm on this ... I'm a little bit out of idea ...
Regards
I deployed sharelatex community edition using docker. The review panel is hidden. I see the «add comment» button which is ineffective. 
 Is this a bug due to bad configuration or a limitation ? 

Thanks in advance

I upgraded from 1.2.0 sharelatex to 2.0.1 through the official docker container.
I foolishly forgot to duplicate my mongodb before i updated therefore my current mongo database has been migrated.
When I run 2.0.1 all flat text files work beutifully but any binary files don't like pdf, jpeg, jpg, png etc.
Its as if it cant find the file. When you click on a binary it says sorry no preview abailbe and if you click download, it can't find the page.
Now i rolled back to 1.2.0 but since i accidentally migrated it without a backup, i have a weird issue.
The share button has disappeared for all of my users.
I would like to figure out how to roll back the mongo db migration so that the sharebutton returns or else figure out why 2.0.1 can't find my binary files. 
Any and all suggestions are welcome, Thank you.
Hello,
I tried to setup Overleaf and all went well on my test machine ! But before installing on my main computer, I kept playing on the test machine.

Here we are : I just wanted to test my abilities concerning backup and restore the mongodb. So here comes the problem : I successfully made a backup using this command : 

`docker-compose exec -T mongo sh -c 'mongodump --archive' > db.dump`

Just after, I created a new project. And finally, I wanted to restore the old backup using : 

`docker-compose exec -T mongo sh -c 'mongorestore --archive' < db.dump`

This did not work since I always got the error : 
`E11000 duplicate key error collection`

I achieved to bypass It with the --drop argument : 
`docker-compose exec -T mongo sh -c 'mongorestore --archive --drop' < db.dump`

However, from now, the compiler does not work anymore. So what is wrong with what I did? I don't understand why this happened 😅...
Thanks for providing open-source overleaf. But I got 502 issue when setuping overleaf in my computer. 
## Problem

I use docker-compose with the [docker-compose.yml file](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) to setup overleaf in my computer. But I got 502 Bad Gateway. 

## Install type

Yes, I follow the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) and use the [docker-compose.yml file](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) in master branch to get up and running. I only change the 80:80 to 5000:80 in the docker-compose.yml file

## Version

Docker version 18.06.1-ce, build e68fc7a

## Logs and errors

I got the following logs:
