Context:

In order to make fp-core.rs API more accessible, we'd like to refactor fp-exmaples folder and split fp-core examples and fp-jargon examples.
Tried to implement traverse as described in cats and haskell.
Currently, we are encoding HKT2s such as Result as HKT3 but it should be HKT2 instead

Update azure-pipeline to fail if there any lint warning.

As a result of PR by @hemangandhi , we now have a new functor in the project for Iterator. However, the implementation is not fully working due to the following errors

- Conflicting implementation with Option
- `U` is not in scope

The ticket aims to correct the implementation that can exist along with the Option functor.
