Good day. I'm Sean, a uni student trying to follow through this very impressive work. But i have faced a problem which i was looking at for a week but still couldn't solve it.
So, I was following through this ipython-soccer-predictions project.

I did

```
gcloud compute instances create ipy-predict \
  --image https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/google-# containers/global/images/container-        vm-v20140522 \
  --zone=us-central1-a --machine-type n1-standard-1 --scopes storage-ro bigquery
```

which was successful and it created a VM instance named ipy-predict.
Then since gcutil doesn't work any more, i typed in

```
gcloud compute ssh osy044_googlemail_com@ipy-predict --zone=us-central1-a 
```

This connected to the VM instance that i have just created.

Then on VM instance, i typed in 

```
docker run fhoffa/ipython-predictions:v1
```

Then it gives the the following error and it stops running. 

```

```

I have checked the supervisord config file and the log files too. 
The log file says

```
fatal: destination path '/home/ipy/ipynotebooks/soccer' already exists and is not an empty directory.
fatal: destination path '/home/ipy/ipynotebooks/soccer' already exists and is not an empty directory.
fatal: destination path '/home/ipy/ipynotebooks/soccer' already exists and is not an empty directory.
```

It seems like the error is caused by restarting the gitpull-prediction over and over again without successfully running it. But im not sure exactly how to solve it. Is there any way to go through this problem?

good good
