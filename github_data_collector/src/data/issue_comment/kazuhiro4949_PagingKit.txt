It seems you have fixed the lift cycle issue with #107 . Could you please update cocoapods with 1.11.2?
Hi, thank you for sharing this great project with everyone! I really like it! But I have a little issue here hoping someone could help me. Thanks a lot!!

### About The Issue
I want to add my pages dynamically, reload both menu & content, and then scroll the menu & content to the last page. It turns out menuViewController works successfully, but contentViewController just can't scroll to the last page. Not sure why.


### My Tries & Results

1. reload first, scroll later
```
func addNewPage() {
        let vc = self.storyboard!.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "myViewController")
        pageList.append(vc)

        let lastPageIndex = pageList.endIndex
        
        menuViewController.reloadData()
        contentViewController.reloadData()

        menuViewController.scroll(index: lastPageIndex)
        contentViewController.scroll(to: lastPageIndex, animated: true)
    }
```
**Result: menuViewController will scroll to the last index, but contentViewController always stays at first index.**



2. use reload-with-preferredFocusIndex function
```
func addNewPage() {
        let vc = self.storyboard!.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "myViewController")
        pageList.append(vc)

        let lastPageIndex = pageList.endIndex
        
        menuViewController.reloadData(with: lastPageIndex, completionHandler: nil)
        contentViewController.reloadData(with: lastPageIndex, completion: nil)
        
    }
```
**Result: menuViewController will scroll to the last index, so does contentViewController. BUT, contentViewController is totally blank!! (It didn't load its input views. But when I do a little scroll, like try to scroll to previous page a little but not really scroll to there, then contentViewController will load its input view successfully.)**

Hello, Is there any way to insert an image in the menu items? Please let me know if there are any ways to do this.
I want to do localization,On PagingContentViewController its working fine but on PagingMenuViewController its not working . Please provide me the solution.
When the cell size is increased the size of title label does not automatically increase to satisfy constraint.
It will merged after releasing Xcode 11.

According to the documentation, I can't achieve this effect.

How to implement this? Can this library do this? @kazuhiro4949
Overall Library is awesome ..... But there is an issue between 0 and 1 index 

-> When view load and  "PagContentViewController"  delegate class is called then your 1 index data is overwritten by 0 index and your 1st index data display in the second index and your second index data is displayed in the third Index.

fileprivate func initialLoad(with page: Int)
    {
      numberOfPages = dataSource?.numberOfItemsForContentViewController(viewController: self) ?? 0
        cachedViewControllers = Array(repeating: nil, count: numberOfPages)
        loadScrollView(with: page - 1)
        loadScrollView(with: page)
        loadScrollView(with: page + 1)
      }

And 

fileprivate func loadPagesIfNeeded(page: Int? = nil)
    {
        let loadingPage = page ?? leftSidePageIndex
            loadScrollView(with: loadingPage - 1)
            loadScrollView(with: loadingPage)
            loadScrollView(with: loadingPage + 1)
   }

There is any suggestion for this issue? I solved this but this is not a permanent solution.



Want to support to jump to the left end tab to right end tab.
(not infinity scrolling. No need to scroll menu tabs.)

It's hard to explain, I have prepared a short diagram. Please take a look.

Perhaps It can be possible by using UIScrollView's contentOffset (and bounds?), but I couldn't.
