This patch provides the same output
This is a multi-week effort to fix all `cargo clippy` lint complaints.

I've made significant effort to segregate the changes by `clippy` category per commit.

The last commits (containing "allow ...") are added allow attributes for code that `clippy` doesn't like but has no easy refactor (or would increase MinSRV).

I tried to be very mechanical and straight-forward about all refactors. But, I'm happy to work on any of this if you disagree with any of the refactoring choices or the "allow" commits.

* note: this PR is on top of the ["fix+modernize" PR](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/pull/1442) in order to be able to easily build and test on multiple machines
This PR is on top of the [windows_legacy fix/addition PR](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/pull/1440).

* adds `cargo make` support for platform dependent build and testing (using `cargo make` and `cargo make test`, respectively)
* modernizes deprecated: 1) range operator, 2) `try!`, and 3) `trim_{left,right}`
* corrects all test failures for all tested CI types (both Travis CI and AppVeyor)
  + tests "%w" and "%W" for stat more loosely given variable support on target machines via built-in `stat`
  + avoids testing stat outputs ("%a", "%d", and "%f") which are race conditions and may vary per machine and/or run
* fixes testing on windows linux (via WSL)

I'm happy to make changes.

This is really a preliminary PR to fix all broken/deprecation issues and serving as a base for a separate (massive) ["clippy-cleanup" PR](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/pull/1443).
So we coud use coreutils construct minimal linux system.
Allows older windows versions to build, using feature="windows_legacy".

- use `CreateFileW` instead of `CreateFile2`
- disable `hostname` build (current implementation isn't compatible with older Windows version)
- substituted deprecated range form  "..." with "..="
- removed try!
- removed unused argument in println!
There appears to be a lot of variation in how complete the "partially done" commands are. For example `od` seems fairly complete, but `date` doesn't even support simple usages like `date +%Y%m%d`, and `sort` seems to have a good selection of options, but is missing some relatively important ones like sort keys.

It would be really useful if there were some documentation clarifying how complete the partially done commands are, to help people understand what's available (I am looking for Windows equivalents of Unix commands, and would, for example, use this project for many of them, but would probably not install `date` as it stands, or only make it available via the `uutils` command).
