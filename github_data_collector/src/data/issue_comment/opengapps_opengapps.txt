When using adb sideload, log files are not saved.
(/sideload is RO)

If you use a gapps-config file, the logs will be saved in the same directory as the config file.
If you do not use a config file, then the log files are copied to /sideload and disappear.

For now, copying the logs to /sdcard when /sideload is detected seems to work.

**Issue description:**

Installation on my Xiaomi Mi A2 fails with error code 25
OpenGapps: open_gapps-arm64-10.0-micro-20200115-BETA.zip 

**Reproduction Steps:**

1. Install custom ROM as per instructions
2. Reboot into recovery
3. Install OpenGapps

**Expected behavior:**

OpenGapps installed

**Observed behavior:**

Error 25

**Upload the installation debug log (=tar.gz file) and logcat of Force Closure:**

N/A


After digging around in `install.sh`, I found (just below get_file_prop() near line 956):
```
if [ ! "$(getprop 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
...
elif [ ! "$(getprop ro.build.type 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
...
fi
```

On my device, both if-branches fail so lateron there's no get_prop() function defined.
When I add the following, everything works as expected:

```
else
  get_prop() {
    getprop "$1"
  }
```

**Issue description:**
Open GApps installation fails with error 70 (Insufficient space on system partition)

Relevant snippet of open_gapps_log.txt (please note the strange text-values for sizes!)
```
         Total System Size (KB) | Filesystem
         Used System Space (KB) | 1K-blocks
        Current Free Space (KB) | Used
```

**Reproduction Steps:**
Latest TWRP already installed on both partitions A and B (currently: version 3.3.1-0.)

1. Activate partition A
2. Install custom ROM (e.g.: Resurrection Remix. This typically gets installed on the other partition, i.e.: B)
3. Activate partition B
4. Reboot into TWRP
5. Install OpenGapps (i.e.: on partition B)

**Expected behavior:**
OpenGapps installs without error.


**Observed behavior:**
Install fails with error 70

**In-depth explanation**

Relevant section of open_gapps_log.txt:
```
                    Device Name | jasmine_sprout
                   Device Model | Mi A2
                    Device Type | phone
                     Device CPU | arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a,armeabi
          Device A/B-partitions | true
             Installer Platform | arm
                   ROM Platform | arm64
```

My Device is a A/B partioned device. This gets detected correctly and installer.sh sets SYSTEM_MOUNT to /system.
But: on my device, /system_root is relevant instead of /system.
(FYI: /system exists but is empty and not mentioned in /etc/fstab)
This somehow leads to `df=$(df -k $SYSTEM | tail -n 1);` to /only/ return this line:
`Filesystem     1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on`

Interestingly, after starting the custom ROM and then rebooting into TWRP, df -k /system works as expected!

**Issue description:**

YouTube app is not getting update in my Samsung galaxy S5 (SM-G900F). Using nano package of android 9.0 for arm architecture. Used every custom rom of android 9.0. My device is getting all the latest builds of YouTube app when running official firmware but when i flash custom rom with open gapps the playstore is giving me July's build of YouTube app.

**Reproduction Steps:**

1. Download YouTube app.
2. See the last updated information.
Other android 9 phones got updates in November but i am not getting updates and the app is saying to update it.

**Expected behavior:**

YouTube app is getting updates. It should also be shown in Play Store and there should be an option to update it.

**Observed behavior:**

YouTube app is no longer supported for updates. When we open the app it says to update it but there is no option to update it in Play Store but the app is getting normal updates in other android 9 phones.

**Upload the installation debug log (=tar.gz file) and logcat of Force Closure:**

Hi, I have an issue when i compile the AOSP project with opengapps:

```
[vendor/opengapps/sources/x86/app/com.google.android.videos/23/nodpi/41600186.apk]
  End-of-central-directory signature not found.  Either this file is not
  a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.  In the
  latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be found on
  the last disk(s) of this archive.
note:  vendor/opengapps/sources/x86/app/com.google.android.videos/23/nodpi/41600186.apk may be a plain executable, not an archive
zipinfo:  cannot find zipfile directory in one of vendor/opengapps/sources/x86/app/com.google.android.videos/23/nodpi/41600186.apk or
          vendor/opengapps/sources/x86/app/com.google.android.videos/23/nodpi/41600186.apk.zip, and cannot find vendor/opengapps/sources/x86/app/com.google.android.videos/23/nodpi/41600186.apk.ZIP, period.
```
I tried anything and downloaded it 3 times, 3 times same problem. I don't know what to do. It is for all OpenGapps apks.
