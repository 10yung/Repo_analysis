Screen is working perfectly after installation at raspbian but the touch is not working.
I'm using 7.0 inches TFT LCD (7inch HDMI Display-C-1024X600(MPI7002)).
Is the screen able to handle touch? 
I'm using Pi4 w/ 4GB Ram.

I want to boot to cli as desktop isn't as useful as i wanted.
I'm using:
MHS-3.5‚Äù RPi Display(MHS3528)

Just wanted to use command line instead of gui
- RPi 4 4 GB RAM
- Kali Linux 2019.4 fresh installed only newest updates were installed.

This Display were buyed: https://www.amazon.de/Kuman-Resistive-Protective-Touchscreen-Bildschirm/dp/B01F3JI58G/

Error after Reboot:
end Kernel panic - not syncing: No working init found. Try passing init= option to kernel
Hello,
I am trying to find the implementation details and datasheets regarding these LCD displays, more particularly the [3.2" RPi Display](https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show#32-rpi-display-mpi3201) ([LCD-wiki link](http://www.lcdwiki.com/3.2inch_RPi_Display)) in order to write a library or program for directly reading and writing to the screen without the Xorg overhead.
From what I can see in the ["LCD32-show" script](https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show/blob/master/LCD32-show), and the decompiled dtb file as mentioned in the script, the device controller seems to be an Ilitek [9340](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/ILI9340.pdf) or [9341](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/ILI9341.pdf). Is this correct?

Secondly, the pin 15 of the display is labeled as "LCD instruction control, Instruction/Data Register selection" in the LCD wiki page. In the [2.4inch RPi Display For RPi 3A+](http://www.lcdwiki.com/2.4inch_RPi_Display_For_RPi_3A+) page, it is labeled additionally with "low level is instruction, high level is data." Is it the same case for the 3.2" LCD? (If they use the same controller then that should be the case, I think). What Instructions does it accept? Is it the same as those listed in the section 8 of the ILI9341 datasheet?

I am new to embedded systems programming and driver programming so I apologise for my lack of knowledge.
If ./rotate.sh is set to 180, the screen only displays a blank white image. If set to 0, the screen displays normally. I have not tested 90 or 270.
Update the README to use GitHub markdown.

Add a top level section for LCD Show.

Move Change Log to bottom of the list.
Hi,
is it possible, somehow, to turn the screen off while it is not used?
Not sure why I cant get this to run when I load the ARM version of kali linux on my raspberry pi. I can use the script fine if I run raspbian on my PI but not with Kali linux. The official documentation says it should be supported, but I cant figure out why this is happening. I tried the prebuilt ISO files to no avail. Please advise!! I have the 3.5inch RPI Display
Hey,there.  
There are some problem on buster.  
My display is 3.5 inch.  
When I installed drivers,my display is not white but it can't touch.  
What happened?
My raspbian is released on 2019-9-26,Buster.
