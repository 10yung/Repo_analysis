Hello Sir,
Your Library is very good to use. But I'm not able to start the slider from bottom. If you can please help I will be thankful. And another thing make something like Semi Circular slider and give it like another property of circular slider. The function `DrawLine` is not there in tour code to edit.
GitHub changed the way Markdown headings are parsed, so this change fixes it.

See [bryant1410/readmesfix](https://github.com/bryant1410/readmesfix) for more information.

This PR adds a new property to this component: `slideOnTouch`.

Now, if you set `slideOnTouch` to YES, then you can set `currentValue` of the slider when you touch some position, i.e. you don't need to necessarily drag the handle to the value.

Hi, when I try to compile the code using EFCircularSlider imported with bridging header in swift I get 18 errors "Explected a type" in EFCircularTrig.h, what could it be the problem?
Thanks.

Setting the currentValue of the slider directly works perfectly. When I try to set it in an animation though the drawn elements are not properly rendered.

This is how I tried to animate:

``` objective-c
[UIView animateWithDuration:1.f animations:^{
    self.hourSlider.currentValue = 50;
}];
```

It would be cool to have a `setCurrentValue:animated:` similar to `UIProgressView`'s `setProgress:Animated:`.
