I would like to use and implement your code but i'm using macbook. However, I got an error while running this: toolboxSfmCompile().

The error was: 
   Undefined function or variable 'opts'.
  Error in toolboxSfmCompile (line 160)
  mex(opts{:},[rd '/' ds{i} '/' fs{i} '.' mexext], ...

I suspect, it could be due to mex file not compatible with mac. Is it right? I'm not sure because i'm new to mex file. 

Thank you in advance for respond.
I am trying to understand the function affineUpgrade.m by reading the related paper: Globally Optimal Algorithms for Stratified Autocalibration. I am having trouble with the lines 350-372. The paper does not create cases for the variable y in the appendix. However, you have created such cases and called functions (lines 294-346) that use formulations that do not appear in the paper. Would you please help me understand why this is done?
