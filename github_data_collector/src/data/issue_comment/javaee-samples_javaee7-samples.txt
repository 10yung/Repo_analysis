myJob.xml says: < next on="foobar" to="step3"/ >
but the text says: 
Decider is always returning the value foobar which forwards the execution to step2

shouldn't the xml also say to="step2" ?
Adds profile payara-micro-remote that runs single Payara Micro instance for a test suite.

Profile payara-micro-remote-control serves for starting and stopping such instance.

Currently few tests fail: Security, because there's no security management in payara-micro-deployer, and EJB timers, that might hint at bug in deployment process
Hi all,

I'm reading Arun's book and I find it very good done! Direct to the point without too much bloating discussions.
I was trying to launch the servlets examples in Docker but WildFly had problems to start because some not compatible dependencies (from java 9 with a module_info.java) were being copied in WEB-INF's lib. I add the scope 'test'...should be perhaps 'provided' better?

At the time the book was written java 9 wasn't around  yet :-)

Thanks so much in advance for your feedback!
Bye
Fabio
Add a new sample to demonstrate EJB-style interceptors, using @interceptor.

This is the Simple chat Demo. But how to make the group chat in this case.
This testcase reproduces Payara bug

https://github.com/payara/Payara/issues/2318


This contains two sets of fixes:
- The SAMs no longer return SUCCESS with emtpy principals for mandatory
authentication
- The ServerAuthContext sets up two SAM module instances to satisfy the
spec requirement that the mandatory flag can be accessed from the
requestPolicy

The first fix is important, as currently the tests fail to return proper
http status codes for unathenticated protected resources on multiple app
servers.

The second fix is just for complying with the letter of the spec, as the
requestPolicy is not actually used in any of the current tests.
