PR code comments show up in my notifications but the actual code comment doesn't show up.

We use labels heavily and are currently resorting to manually prefixing the titles with `[WIP]` etc. Would be great if we could see the labels!

I would love a keyboard shortcut equivalent to the "Mark all as read" checkmark button. Are you open to this idea? I could try a PR if so.

"a" seems logical but I wonder if this action should require a little extra work, as you don't want to hit it by accident. Following the `g p`, `g e`, etc. precedent, how about `m a`?

First, let me say: I <3 this tool!

I hate using email to stay up-to-date with Github, I find the notifications app much better UX.

Right now though, the tool isn't usable to me, as it is flooded with notifications from a repository which I had been removed as a collaborator.

The requests to the Github API endpoints fail:

Any ideas how to clear this? I have already tried in `incognito` to see if it was a cache or cookie causing issue...

The permissions requested are pretty extensive:

From the [GH docs](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-with-third-party-applications/#repositories):

> **This is one of the most expansive configurations you can permit, so accept it with caution!**

Contrast permissions for Travis CI, which are much more scoped:

I immediately notice how it's much easier to understand what Travis can read or modify, and I'm nervous about authorizing github-notifications with write access to everything.

I'd be a lot more comfortable if the github-notification permissions were scoped, or at least if there were a explanation presented for requesting so much :)

Thanks!

When someone replies to an issue with a new comment the issue is re-marked as unread/bold, but when you click on the issue it does not load the new comment. You either need to open the issue on GitHub or reload the page.

I think this started recently/last week or two.

If you switch the list of issues to all and then go back to the unread view, the issues will no longer unbold as you read them.

Currently the left nav bar is too narrow and truncates repo names.

I would like to be able to resize it.

I would like to see a fourth issue category added called important or favourite.

It would list all issues from a set of repositories I have selected as important or favourite.

This would make it easier to manage the 300 repositories I have access to and allow me to follow some of them very closely.

Currently I have to scroll through a long list of truncated repo names to hunt down the ones I want.
