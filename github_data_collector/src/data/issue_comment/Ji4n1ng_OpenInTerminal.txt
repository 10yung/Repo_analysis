GitHub上的效果是这样的

可以选择使用什么文本编辑器打开，但是本地只能设置默认编辑器

建议您这边可以的话在设置里开个选项，就是“是否启用默认编辑器和终端”这种。因为有的文件我是用sublime text打开，有的我是用vs code打开，因为用lite版本的话我访达菜单栏的插件已经太多了，摆不下了……

## Debug information (Logs, OS, Hardware, Version, etc.)
macOS 10.15.2
OpenInTerminal 2.0.5

**v1.0.2** (macOS 10.15.2)

Does OpenInEditor-Lite support multiple selected files? I tried it (editor set to SublimeText) and it only opens 1 file. This would be a nice thing to support... not sure if it's possible?

## Summarize this feature

Provide ways to customise "Open in" experience. 

## Why should this feature be included?

macOS provides functionality in command line as `open -a MyApp /path/to/file/or/folder` to customise the *open* experience.
For example, user can use `open -a CotEditor /path/to/folder` to open folder in CodEditor; or `open -a MacVim ~/myPath` to open folder in MacVim.

Hope your app can provide ways for users to customise this to facilitate the individual needs instead of adding the support one by one through Issues.

## Additional information

## Summarize this feature
Click button to open iTerm, then create a new split pane.

## Why should this feature be included?
Because a single window with many split panes are better than multiple tabs/windows.

## Additional information
Additionally, if your app could be configurable. iTerm is scriptable. So you can query iTerm and see that the window is 400px wide, and has two split panes. Then when you open a new split pane with your app, you can split a new pane and increase the window size to 600px.
