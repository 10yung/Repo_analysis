重复打开关闭会crash.
你在关闭的时候 移除了backDimmingView , 但是再次打开的时候没有重新创建就使用了backDimmingView的alpha导致crash.

According to images and gifs you've uploaded it seems there is just one button in tab bar that opens  a menu. And it seems It does not support multiple buttons in tabbar.
If so please add this feature to your library.
By the way your work is fantastic. 👍  
it would be nice to have CocoaPods support
