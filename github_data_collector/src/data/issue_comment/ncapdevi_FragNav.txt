I'm setting the animations here 
`    fragNavController?.pushFragment(
      fragment, FragNavTransactionOptions.newBuilder()
        .customAnimations(enterAnimation, 0, 0, exitAnimation).build()`

but when calling 
`fragNavController?.popFragment()?` 
the pop animation is not working.

Any ideas about it?
Currently I use swipe layout on current fragment. I want to see previous fragment behide the current fragment. Can you support for this function?

It would be convenient if there was navigation in a certain fragment.
For example, we have a chain a -> b -> c -> d -> e->, and I would like to return,for example, from e to b.
I have FragNavController in my activity.
When I call showDialogFragment like
`fun BaseFragment.showDialogFragment(
bottomFragment: BottomSheetDialogFragment,
requestCode: Int = 0
) {
    bottomFragment.setTargetFragment(this, requestCode)
    this.baseActivity().fragNav?.showDialogFragment(bottomFragment)
}`
app crashed with 

> fragment that does not belong to this FragmentManager!


Thanks for the marvelous library, such a great help for managing loads of fragments.
It'd be great if there was be an option for passing a fragment manager as the dialog parent fm to attach to. A simple and easy use-case example is when you're having multiple fragments inside a parent fragment (referring as `currentFrag`) (like a view pager kind of situation) and you need to set the interaction listener for the dialog through `getParentFragment()` method. Currently it's assigned to the so called `currentFrag` which has to pass listener method calls to its child fragment which is not a neat solution.
Thanks in advance.
Hello,

I bumped into an issue with the FragNavController especially after restoring the from savedInstanceState and having a dynamically changing number of tabs, that the rootFragments count is greater than the fragmentStacksTags so it throws IndexOutOfBoundsException with message "Can't switch to a tab that hasn't been initialized" .. is that expected behaviour?

Thanks,
Hi, there is strange bug.

if you have a bottom navigation and sometimes when you click on two item at the same time, two fragment stacks shown above each other. but only one of them working, and you must reselect bottom navigation item to get them to work again.
This is a strange issue I'm facing.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Clearstack for current tab and replace the root fragment using replaceFragment method.
2. Though the above step works but when you switch tabs, the already attached fragment disappears and fails to attach itself.

Please look into this issue and let me know if this sounds valid. 
hi. I have a problem with it. I'm new in android and I have 3 tabs in a BottomBar in my App. one of them has a view pager that scroll between 5 or 6 fragment in it. in the first lunch everything is ok but when I switched between tabs and back to the tab has view pager it shows nothing. view pager is loaded but fragments in it didn't load. what can I do ?
