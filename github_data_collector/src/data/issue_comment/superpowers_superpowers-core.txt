I saw the recent update and all I got to say is please keep this beautiful engine alive and actively developed.
needthis please
Hi,
First of all : thanks for developing superpowers <3
We tried following this intallation tutorial http://docs.superpowers-html5.com/en/development/building-superpowers.
Everything seems to work fine, we get the interface allowing us to start creating our game.
While clicking build however we get the following bug : 
```runtime.js:61181 Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token
SupEngine.js:19691 THREE.WebGLRenderer 81
runtime.js:31 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'Scene' of undefined
    at Object.createOuterAsset (runtime.js:31)

    at Player._lateStartPlugins (SupRuntime.js:1903)
    at async.series (SupRuntime.js:1780)

```
What are we doing wrong there ?
Salut !
Bravo pour ce bijou (je dÃ©couvre aujourd'hui aprÃ¨s moultes recherches d'un editeur RPG en html+JS). Ca tourne super bien. Dommage que Ã§a n'ai pas plus de visibilitÃ©.
La suite en anglais pour toucher tout le monde.

OK, I tested running a game AND also the editor using glitch.com (free NodeJS hosting with limitations), and it works fine!
Only need to change:
- add acron as npm package and remove it from node-modules/.bin using the console.
- change ports in config.json to 3000 and 3001 and you have your own hosted server for your great game!
It solves multiple access issue (I [replied to someone](https://www.reddit.com/r/superpowers_fr/comments/9szwvr/besoin_daide_urgent_serveur/) on reddit before using glitch).
Online editor works but for any reason you can't access it using the standalone editor (superpowers.exe).
Best would be to rewrite password(s) to .env file and change server.js accordingly.

It's just a little tight on the server, since the engine+editor is 89% of the allowed disk (173/194MB).
I didn't go into optimization. May be node-modules could be removed completely since glitch used local packages for all projects (using pnpm) based on package.json.

Hope it gives you new momentum (un nouvel Ã©lan). ðŸ˜¸ 
I've tried loading in 3d models and sprites, but when clicking the upload button, nothing happens. Dragging the resource into the window brings it up in text form and then backing out closes the project file. I also loaded up the included 2d platformer to find the same issues, loading the pre-existing assets just causes it to hang on loading.

I tried launching it from the terminal, but there isn't any useful output.

Launching the 32 bit version seems to cause no errors, and everything runs smoothly.
Hi, 

I'm unable to create a new project after downloading the Super Powers program. I have the previous version, not the latest one that was released days ago.
I installed all of the systems and plugins but I am stuck at the new project step.
My error message says:
`This server doesn't have any systems installed yet. Please install one from the Server Settings tab first. `

Anyone else getting this too? 
The data path may point to the read only directory like
/app/Superpowers/core inside the flatpak sandbox. So we added the path
to the writable data directory which can be set with the
--rw-data-path option when running the server. This is where sessions,
superpowers, systems, config, plugins JSON files can be written.

I'm not sure if the patch is complete, but before continuing it, would this effort be welcome? By the way, the flatpak for superpowers I was working on is here - https://github.com/endlessm/superpowers-flatpak. You can read about flatpak here - http://flatpak.org. We use it at endless to provide applications.

I also have PRs for the game and app, will xref them there, when filing.
Hi,

These file is Korean script file for Superpowers-core.
I hope it will be help to korean developers.

However, there are minor problem.
A button has narrow size in server setting.
Please check an attachment files.

Thanks.

This PR is code for a proposed HotKeyManager  to enable dynamic editing of hotkey definitions as I described  in https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/129
This is part 1 of a 2 part request.  The 2nd PR will appear shortly on superpowers-game repo.

Probably a simple fix but I get the error "Only a single primitive is supported."

I made sure to only export the body of this helicopter from Blender and then convert to the gltf format. I checked by re-importing my .dae file to blender and there is in fact only a single prim.

Not sure what I am doing wrong here.

To be clear I found this asset on TurboSquid just to test with using Superpowers and from what I can see in blender it looks fine to me.
