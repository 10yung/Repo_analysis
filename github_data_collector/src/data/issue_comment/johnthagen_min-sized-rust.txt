When https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2480 is stabilized and implemented, it should be possible to create binaries that don't depend on `std` but do depend on `alloc`. This would be a step between `no_std` and `no_main`, because at least you could use the heap. The actual sample hello world code would probably not change much. It would probably be best to show off using a `Vec` in this instance.

This could probably be added now as a `nightly` subproject.
1. Use (or add) less trivial example, with some external dependencies. For example, opening a file, calculating md5summ, outputting it in hex.
2. Include not just target size for MacOS, but a table of sizes across major platforms.
> On macOS, the final binary size is reduced to 51KB.

> On macOS, the final binary size is reduced to 30KB.

I think each section (including "baseline, before optimisation") should have a demo project with target file size available. The size may even be in section title.
