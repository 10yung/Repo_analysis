Hi,

Everything on the script works great. but I want to try to give more access to VPN clients to LAN resources.

I works with a dedicate server to deploy IKEV2 with two network interfaces.
eth0 -> Public IP 100.100.100.100
eth1 -> Connect server to my LAN network (IP: 192.168.1.100) LAN network: 192.168.1.0/24
IKE VPN clients -> IP 10.10.0.0/16

My goal is provide access from VPN Client (eg: 10.10.0.1) to some resources into my LAN (eg. 192.168.1.150). from the server I can make ping to IP LANs, VPN clients and surfing internet. everything work fine.

I was try to create some Iptables roules to make a NAT from VPN Clients to LAN network but I have not had good results. I'm stuck in this point because I don't know if I have to make some changes in ipsec.conf file or I make a mistake with Iptables routes that I created. 

I will appreciate any help that you could provide me to achieve my goal

Many thanks for any help

My favorite VPS hoster gives a numeric hostname (5 digits of the order) with the public DNS name as "12345.ip-ns.net" (*12345* is here as a changed example). And your setup script fails as it is shown below:

Is it possible to remark the postfix actions at all if I know what your script will try to send me?

(An idea is just to add such example outputs nearby to your repo as documentation - please no unwanted emails for one's privacy.)

Hi, thank you for your script.

I am having troubles to setup second VPN user with fixed IP inside VPN network.
Your script configures one VPN user that receives free IP from pool `10.10.10.0/24`
I want to change IPs for that user to be in range `10.10.10.11-10.10.10.254`. 
I figured out that to do this I need to modify `rightsourceip=` of `conn roadwarrior` section in `/etc/ipsec.conf`
I know how to add new users in `\etc\ipsec.secrets`, but they receive IPs from the same pool.

As I understand, I need to setup additional `conn` sections for each VPN user that requires fixed IP in `/etc/ipsec.conf`

The problem is, if I modify `leftid=` or `eap_identity=` fields of `conn roadwarrior` section to something other than `%any` - then I can't connect to VPN server using Windows 10 and Ubuntu anymore, only Android StrongSwan application is able to connect.

What is the correct way to configure `/etc/ipsec.conf` to make some VPN users receive IP from pool and make other VPN users to have fixed IP?

Hi,
Everything looks good in my environment. The clients can get an IP address from the DHCP Server and can go to LAN and WAN without any problem, but.....all the clients get the same IP address from the DHCP Server. I have tested with another DHCP Server (1st was a Firewall DHCP and 2nd was a Windows Server DHCP) and it's the same.

Questions 1: How to fix that the DHCP gives a different IP address to each VPN Client ?

Like...I made a test using rightsourceip=10.10.1.247/32 and the client works with no problem, but for the firewall, looks like the connection comes from the server. The server have free access to the internet, but the Clients should auth first.

How to change the way that the VPN Client go to the LAN, to because a normal client ?
Or how to fix the DHCP Issue that gives the same IP address to all the VPN Client?
Is there a way to add IPv6 support? I am on U.S. T-Mobile and, even though I can connect to my VPN server, the traffic completely stops after connecting. That seems to be because T-Mobile only supports IPv6.
Hello,

This seems like a wonderful project. I installed it on a Google Compute instance (Ubuntu 17.04).

During the installation, I get the following error:

```
Processing triggers for ufw (0.35-4) ...

Network interface: ens4
External IP: 10.142.0.2
Warning: vpn.myDomain.com resolves to 104.196.47.118, not 10.142.0.2
Either you are behind NAT, or something is wrong (e.g. hostname points to wrong IP, CloudFlare proxying shenanigans, ...)
Press [Return] to continue, or Ctrl-C to abort
```

Well, my external IP of the instance is 104.196.47.118 and the internal IP is 10.142.0.2. Why should my domain point to the internal IP address? That makes no sense.

May you please advise on this?

Many Thanks,
Houman

Ran the setup.sh script on a fresh install of Ubuntu Server 17.04 with no modifications to anything. I'm able to successfully connect to the VPN server but there's no traffic passing through the tunnel.

The VPN server is a virtual machine running on Vmware Workstation Pro 12.5.7. The virtual network adapter is set to bridge mode and it's pulling it's own IP address from the router.
