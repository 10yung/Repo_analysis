I really don't understand why you didn't spend additional 30 min to create a good documentation for such a great project :slightly_smiling_face:, some how-to with examples would be really appreciated? Thanks
This github project says there are 15 contributors yet the sum total of "documentation" is 2 pages.

1 page is the GitHub Readme.md 
which is almost nothing

1 page is the Meshbird webpage: https://meshbird.com/
which is almost nothing as well.

Meshbird may work great but if people can't figure out how to setup even a minimal 3-10 server (local and cloud) mesh vpn with it ... what good is it?

I've got years of linux experience, have implemented and used many different VPNs.   I'm proficient on AWS and other Cloud environments, I was an early adopter of SDN, I am a CCIE and worked at Cisco for many years but just gotta ask...

Can't someone knowledgeable about Meshbird's design spend 3-5 days putting some reasonable documentation with examples together?   

I don't want this to sound wrong but I'd like to understand more about Meshbird and currently have nothing to go on.

Hello,

Can you please tell me if Meshbird is stable enough for production use?

I know that there are other VPN solutions out there like OpenVPN, Tinc, and SoftEther, but I really like the idea of a distributed system thatr Meshbird offers.

Cheers :)
I checked https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/trunk/PKGBUILD?h=packages/meshbird which shows the archlinux package should be built from https://github.com/meshbird/meshbird/archive/v0.2.tar.gz, but it does not seem to exist in this repo....
The ifconfig command is not included by default on installations of Ubuntu 18.04 and other recent Linux distributions (Debian, Centos, etc). The interface should probably be brought up using the ip command or a platform-native call.

The code in question is at https://github.com/meshbird/meshbird/blob/master/src/meshbird/iface/iface.go#L42

I couldn't see any tests - are there any?
`go get github.com/meshbird/meshbird` fails with the following:

```
package github.com/meshbird/meshbird: no Go files in /home/mgarton/gopath/src/github.com/meshbird/meshbird
```

I tried, to find compare table with over products, but without result.
Is there a place where people interested in contributing/getting more technical information might go to?

I looked here and on the linked site and could not find a good overview of components, etc.

thank you!
