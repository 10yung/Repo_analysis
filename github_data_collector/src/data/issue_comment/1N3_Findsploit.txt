I used the Pentest Framework to install/manage my utilities. So my searchploit script is installed in /pentest/exploitation/exploit-db/searchsploit, therefore Findsploit's update fails because it is looking for it in /usr/bin/searchsploit. I tried symlinking but it complained about that as well. Is there a way around this without changing the source code? 

Right now install.sh uses apt-get to install dependencies which is not supported by OSX.
