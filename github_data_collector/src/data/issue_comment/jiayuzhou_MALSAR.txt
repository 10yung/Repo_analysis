Hi Jiayu:

I was testing the proximal operator for the L1inf norm which lead me to test the prf_lbm.cpp.
First, it worked well, and the procedure to make sparsity is quite similar to the procedure in Sparse PCA.
But I found some source codes doesn't match the performance, here is my testing:
D=[1 2 2; 4 4 3];
tau=1;
[mu, theta , mc]=prf_lbm(D,2,3,tau);
Then

mu =

         0    0.5000    0.5000
    0.5000    0.5000         0

theta =

    1.5000
    3.5000

The results seems quite right. But in the source code(line 94 ):
x[i*m+j] = (c[i*m+j] > theta)?(c[i*m+j]-theta):((c[i*m+j]< -theta)?(c[i*m+j]+theta):0);
when theta=1.5
mu(1,:) should be -0.5 0.5 0.5 in stead of   0    0.5000    0.5000

Please let me know, why is this?

Hank

We need to change the parameter to key/value, and users can leave some parameters blank to use default values. 


Currently we use FISTA, and however in practice, SPARSA works better. We may want to change to other solvers. Or, provide a list of solvers and ask users to choose one of them. 

We need to unify the input/output format.
