Hi,

I wrote an article about a blockchain rogue game that has only a text user interface.  Would you be interested in some integration?

I noted you have a bitcoin address there, maybe some kind of bounty could work?

Anyway, here is the article:  https://komodoplatform.com/tt2019-7-rogue-blockchain-gaming-tournaments-tokenization-collectibles-trading/

Cheers

2) kill the old wand maker (with fire)
3) go get the corpse dust
=> the ghosts will follow you on this level and all the next levels until they kill you.

expected behavior = the ghosts will only follow you on this level but not the next ones.
