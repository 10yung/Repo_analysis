Brief description of the problem
Using the code given by website "devtools::install_github("benmarwick/wordcountaddin", type = "source", dependencies = TRUE)". Everything run smoothly until installing package 'fastmap'.  The error is returned as: "Error: Failed to install 'wordcountaddin' from GitHub:
  (converted from warning) installation of package ‘fastmap’ had non-zero exit status"

```r
# insert reprex here
```

For the simple Rmd shown below, I'd expect `text_stats()`to count seven words, but instead it finds twenty. This seems to come from an issue in the regex used to identify and strip the YAML; after initial processing of text, the second `---` does not start a line.

```r

This document contains a very simple sentence.

Thanks for the nice add-in, I was looking for something to compute readability scores and it's nice to have the word count as a bonus!

The readability function works fine if I call it *after* the word count function (`text_stats()`). But if I call the readability function without calling `text_stats()` earlier in the session, then I get the following error:

``` r
wordcountaddin:::readability()
#> Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable) : unable to find an inherited method for function 'readability' for signature '"NULL"'
```

Great package! Would it be possible to add an option to return a data frame instead of a knitr_kable object?

If text_stats() returned a df, it would be easier to use in the document itself to grab the word count. This way it could be used to automatically insert word counts to documents.

Cheers.
