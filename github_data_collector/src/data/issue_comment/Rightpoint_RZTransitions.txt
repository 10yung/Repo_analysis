Found a problem when using custom transitions with navigation controller, solved by following steps [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20312765/navigation-controller-top-layout-guide-not-honored-with-custom-transition)
Hi! First, great work with this library!
I'm using it in a Swift project, but I'm having problems with the layout of the destination view controller that is not respected. 
I've added this line in my AppDelegate : 
`RZTransitionsManager.shared().defaultPushPopAnimationController = RZZoomPushAnimationController()`
And this in my ToViewController :
`self.navigationController?.delegate = RZTransitionsManager.shared()`

The transition is working very good, but in my DestinationViewController the layout isn't respected because some labels are put behind the navigation bar (which has the translucent property set to false). How can I solve this? 
On application launch I set the default animation controllers for RZTransitionsManager:

```
let manager = RZTransitionsManager.shared()
manager.defaultPresentDismissAnimationController = RZZoomPushAnimationController()
manager.defaultPushPopAnimationController = RZZoomPushAnimationController()
```

Custom transition is working well when I push or pop the view controller inside of navigation stack. But transition is not interactive. Pan gesture from screen edge closes view controller immediately and it’s not possible to stop the transition.

The question is: should I implement RZTransitionInteractionController inside each view controller to make transition interactive? Or, maybe, there’s an easier way?

If presentingViewController is kind of class UITabBarController, RZTransitions will ignore setting transtions.

Hi,
If you will do left or right  swapping fast then it transition does not happens smoothly .

Fixes for https://github.com/Raizlabs/RZTransitions/issues/52
- Added  `toViewController.view.frame = [transitionContext finalFrameForViewController:toViewController];` to the end of the `- (void)animateTransition:(id<UIViewControllerContextTransitioning>)transitionContext` methods (in each of the transitions) as per [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/32256538/3151873) SO.
- Updated the project settings in the Demo to build with multiple orientations (as well as iPad) enabled for testing.

I have created a [project that demonstrates the issue](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6Qb_QLXSu3VbUJXYmNIM0c4X1U/view?usp=sharing).

When using RZTransitions, if the orientation is changed in a presented view controller (when the view controller is presented with an RZTransition) the parent view controller is not resized appropriately.

When the same view controller is presented without RZTransitions, the orientation is preserved.

Thanks!


The header doc for `[RZTransitionsManager  setInteractionController: fromViewController:toViewController:forAction:]` claims it'll return a unique key to reference the pairing, but...
1) due to a shadowed variable bug, it always returns `nil`
2) the way it's currently written, there is no 'unique key' to return.  It adds as many objects to the map as there are bits set in the action.
