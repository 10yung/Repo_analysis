This is not exactly an issue, more of a documentation request as I couldn't seem to figure out how to do it just fiddling around.

I have a sealed class I am using as an action:
```
class SelectClient(var id:String? = "") {
    companion object
}
```
My reducer looks like this:
```
val rwaReducer = Reducer { state: RWAState, action: Any ->
    when (action) {
        SelectClient -> {
            val action = action as SelectClient
            println(action.id) // Doesn't print anything here
            state
        }
        else ->
            state
    }
}
```
When I dispatch an initialized class variable, it doesn't do anything in the reducer, looks like it doesn't recognize the class as the action passed
```
var action = SelectClient()
action.id = "SomeClient"
rwaStore.dispatch(action)
```

Perhaps I am dispatching wrongly? Any help would be appreciated! :)
With this versions, when I try to import your library it only allows me to import (Reducer or Store classes, for example) from "jvm-redux-api". 

I don't know why it happens and if this happens only to me. 

Version 1.0.3 allows me to import the correct classes and use the library.
I'm having trouble properly creating the store. Whenever I call `getState` on the store, I get the error shown below. It prints out that the `mainStore` is of type `redux.MiddlewareKt$applyMiddleware$1$1$1`.

```
// TODO: initialize AppState from file if available
val previousState = AppState()
val mainStore = createStore(AppReducer(), previousState, applyMiddleware(MyMiddleware<AppState>()))
Log.e(getClass().toString(), "Store's class type is: " + mainStore.getClass().toString());
AppState state = mainStore.getState();
```

I've also tried without the middleware. Without the middleware, it says the type is `redux.StoreKt$createStore$creator$1$1`.
