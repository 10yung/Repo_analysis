Essentially a copy-paste from [Toxin](https://github.com/p3lim/sublime-toxin), thanks @p3lim! One divination is that I chose to decolor the VCS badges, instead of outright hiding them, since they help distinguish created/modified from staged. Another is the italic for ignored files, which I wouldn't mind dropping, but it's somewhat useful.

Didn't know what colors to choose, so just looked at [VS Code's Base16 Themes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AndrsDC.base16-themes).

This is opt-in, `vcs_color` setting enables the whole thing, `vcs_color_expanded` also applies the coloring to expanded folders. The latter one is the same setting name as in Toxin, for potential interop.

Added `variables` introduced in 3179, because why not. Opted not to indent the rules as to not ruin the diff for the main feature and to not pollute the blame trail. `base` prefix because [reasons](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/syndata.html#value-def-identifier).

Also piggybacked in a fix for #188, since the original PR has died a slow and painful death.

Sublime Text now has a simple Git integration. Problem is, the dots it displays in the sidebar are distracting for those who are used to depending on the gutter indicators (e.g. from GitGutter or SublimeLinter). This is being discussed in [this forum post](https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/git-file-status-badges/40694).

Currently there's no alternative display mode, so the only fix, besides outright disabling the integration, is theming. Thankfully, as mentioned in that post, the necessary adjustments have already been made in another theme - [Toxin](https://github.com/p3lim/sublime-toxin) - so this would be relatively easy to replicate in Spacegray.

However, would such a change be welcome? @marcofugaro @kkga 
I've come across friends using Operator Mono in Atom and would love to get it in Sublime alongise Spacegray. Does anybody have any instructions on how to do this?

Possibly a dupe of #183.
Even with `"show_tab_close_buttons": false`, the close button is still active when hovering over the modified state indicator:

Is it possible to fully disable it along with `"show_tab_close_buttons": false`?
I don't want $ (dollar sign) to have different color, is it configurable ?

Hey, 

Trying to turn the new icons off - Sorry, no offence!

But adding this to user settings has no effect:
"spacegray_fileicons": false,

Am I missing something else?

Many thanks
Chris

Hello - seems like the tree scroll bar is only resizing the sidebar panel. Scrolling in the tree is only available by mouse wheel which is slower on larger trees.

After setting 'spacegray_fileicons:true', the open files close icon is not totally shown, only part of it.  Resizing window doesn't work.
