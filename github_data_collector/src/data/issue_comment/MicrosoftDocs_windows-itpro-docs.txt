As mentioned in the document https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/surface-pro-arm-app-management PXE boot is supported in Surface Pro X

Problem: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/issues/5856
Verified and made a correction in the Reg Key.

Problem: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/issues/5550
As the link is not pointing to a proper source and there is no other information is available on Microsoft docs so I have removed this link. The link provided was pointing to the LinkedIn course intro video and doesn't fit with the context of the article. 

Problem: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/issues/5854
I think this reference should be removed as the content is pointing to a non-official document. It's a personal blog and we can not refer any information from any personal blog in MS documentation.  All of the links pointing to a personal blog should be removed. Link to **Configuring a proxy for your Surface Hub** , **Configuring a proxy for your Surface Hub** and **Surface Hub and the Skype for Business Trusted Domain List** .

Updated to clarify the 1903 FOD also supports 1909

"PXE boot is not supported on Surface Pro X. For more information, refer to Deploying, managing, and servicing Surface Pro X."

The linked page says that PXE boot is supported.

All of these resources are great. Just wondering if you have any instruction on running a remote scan on Mac devices.
