When I run deploys I get the start of the deployment in the logs windows but none of the logs I have create come out. The last thing I see is below and deployinator is unable to detect that the deployment has completed. I am using log_and_stream and the 1501422651-nobody-workbench_bot_uat_deploy.html is filled as expected.  My environment is always building from the lastest Gem and is running in Docker with ports 7777/7778 open I can see the WS connection open in the browser(not sure how to inspect the traffic).

The deployment its self is some json posts to various services and takes approx 5-10 secs

Thanks
Mark

Any ideas?

If you want to use deployinator to deploy itself currently you have to call it something different like deployin8or to avoid namespacing issues. This can be fixed by changing the way view classes are called to be "DeployinatorView" instead of "Deployinator", the exact stack name.

i had the same problem, ruby-2.1.2

We currently ignore the status of the git_clone command (in https://github.com/etsy/deployinator/blob/master/lib/deployinator/helpers/git.rb#L128)

this can lead to annoying troubleshooting, if the permissions are wrong on the checkout folder for example.

We should stop shelling out and use a proper git library for our git operations.
