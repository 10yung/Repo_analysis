Codebase is updated for Swift-4.2
it'd be cool to have a swift 3 version, if you have any interest to create a branch i would like to help with that.

Is it fine to add codebeat badge to README? 

codebeat is automated code review tool for Swift,Ruby,Go & Python that helps get instant feedback on code quality. 

"Quick wins" suggested by codebeat could be a nice candidate for a pull request and help other developers become contributors.

FYI. To be fully open and honest. I'm co-founder of codebeat.

There is still a glitch when you scroll up while calling insertItemAtIndexPath, because the header seems to be reloaded and the initial layout attributes for the cell are wrong causing the header to flicker.
