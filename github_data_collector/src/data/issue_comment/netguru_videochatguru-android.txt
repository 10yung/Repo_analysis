Hello, has anybody used this over the production?
The demo app was stable but it seems to be unstable when the number of users increases.

Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

Hello Netguru, I see that the app is working fine with Firebase Database but this is very expensive if the number of users is big in number. If you are available I would like to migrate this app from Firebase database to Firestore Database.

Both phones have been able to send their offers and answers and I can see their ice candidates on firebase. I can see the local video at the top right corner but remote video is not showing.
