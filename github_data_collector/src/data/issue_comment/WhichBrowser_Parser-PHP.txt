Hi,

Have you considered a type like handheld? `$result->isType('handheld')`

Handheld is an alternate serving media type for old phones. It's part of SEO mobile as indicated here:

Greetings!
Add support to detect Firefox release channels (stable, beta, nightly), like for Chrome.

You would need to have a list of Firefox versions and their stability. You can get them from [The Product-Details JSON API](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Product_details).

When parsing user-agent, you would need to check that list. If the version is stable, it should use "Stable" channel. If the version is beta, it should use "Beta" channel. If the version is not on the list, it should use "Nightly" channel.

And, if possible, also detect Firefox ESR version.
I found a favicon google bot in my logs from google ip range

Hi there dear Niels
i think if something simple like this be added in the library can be good :
`$header='$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']';
$arch_regex = '/\b(x86_64|x86-64|Win64|WOW64|x64|ia64|amd64|ppc64|sparc64|IRIX64)\b/ix';
$this->bit=preg_match($arch_regex, $header) ? '64' : '32';`
or maybe more developed.
The target is when when detected windows on os, give the cpu architect too
Best Regards!

Added zgrab bot.
User-Agent string is e.g. "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 zgrab/0.x"
For more infomation see: https://github.com/zmap/zgrab
Usage of this bot is unknown, request come from random dialup IPs.
We like this library but it feels too complicated to get started. Is there simple instructions where I can download the source code without figuring out how to use composer? 

It is a limited point of view to only offer installation instructions via composer and not a fall back set of instructions to download it and just use it.
