Tried to install both using pacmac and dkms for Manjaro, however it fails and does not start.
Kernel 5.3 do install but nothing happens and neither the log is generated.

The output from dmesg is that no audio device is found.  I have since reverted to the previous NVidia driver (430.40) and its working again.  Fedora 30 - HP Omen with 1060.
Laptop GTX 1050 here, kernel 5.2.8-arch1-1-ARCH. 
After `sudo tee /proc/acpi/nvhda <<<ON`, dmesg shows the following:
```
[  359.109481] nvhda: enabling audio
[  359.109483] nvhda: Not multifunction, no audio
```
How can I fix this? Thanks!
Hello,

I have a laptop with 2 GPU and use an `optimus-manager` to switch between inte/nvidia GPU.

For some reason after switching to NVIDIA and turning on nvhda, I can't switch the audio output to HDMI.
HDMI output appears in a list of audio devices, however after switching to HDMI nothing happens, and I can't see any errors and nothing suspicions in dmesg...

What could I do to debug this issue and find out what goes wrong?

Arch linux, kernel - 5.1.15
Kubuntu 18.04.02
nvidia 1050 TI (390.116)
Turn audio on by `sudo tee /proc/acpi/nvhda <<<ON`, set GP107GL as default output.
Suspend laptop, wakeup and OS has audio off.
If I execute again `sudo tee /proc/acpi/nvhda <<<ON`, back GP107GL as default output.
Can I fix it?
Hi, great job, really appreciated. I am wondering how to modprobe the script automatically at every boot while setting the variable to ON by default. It would be much better than manually do it every time.

Many thanks again!
Hello,

Together with the Kernel Update 4.20.11 I had to do a complete Reinstallation of the Nvidia Drivers to Version 418.43-2. (Nvidia seems to have decided out of the Blue to move my Graphics Card out of Legacy 390xx to the new Version, after moving it to Legacy just a few months ago...)

I have a Thinkpad W530 using a Nvidia Quadro K2000M. And Nvhda was working perfectly with Nvidia-390xx since October 2018.

- I removed the Kernel Module from DKMS
- Removed Nvhda with yay -Rs nvhda-dkms-git
- Rebooted
- Reinstalled Nvhda from AUR

'sudo modprobe nvhda' seems also to run through fine. No errors there.
Then to switch on Nvhda also seems to run with 'sudo tee /proc/acpi/nvhda <<<ON'

But even though anything looks fine, I cannot get Audio through Displayport anymore. Config of Bumblebee hasn't changed at all.

dmesg upon enabling nvhda gives me:
`[ 2659.797670] nvhda: Found nv audio device 0000:01:00.1

`

Are there any logs by Nvhda to Look up or anything else I can provide?


Edit: Noticed something else weird. If I use Alsamixer the Nvidia Card is detected after turning on Nvhda. But switching is impossible. Graphics card is not shown anywhere else. Gnome Settings just show Internal Speakers.
I needed to add the `modprobe` line lest the `echo` complain of missing `/proc/acpi/nvhda`.
After runnin `sudo make -f Makefil.dkms` and obtaining the following output:

Running `sudo modprobe nvhda` returns:
`modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'nvhda': Required key not available`
Hi, man, how are you?
I discovered this week that my hdmi has no sound. I found your repo and installed this module in my ubuntu 16.04, kernel 4.15. After installing the problem is that even connected with hdmi now it does not display anything. What should I do?
