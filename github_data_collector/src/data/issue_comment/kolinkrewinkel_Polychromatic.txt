It stopped working with Xcode 9. Even with the trick to unsign the binary and update the plugins the extension doesn't work anymore. The settings of Polychromatic are showing up inside the settings menu but the code doesn't get highlighted as it should. This is most likely due to the fact that Xcode 9 reworked entirely the code editor component. It didn't seem that their extension framework was improved in Xcode 9 vs what they announced and showed in Xcode 8 so for now there is no way to get back the functionality in a more official way.

Any chance to fix that? Happened on two computers

Xcode 7.3

This is my first time try to use the plugin. 
The steps I have proceed,
1. download the latest plugin Polychromatic.xcplugin.zip from "release"
2. create a new directory 
3. close Xcode and reopen it. 

```
$ls
Polychromatic.xcplugin/

$pwd
/Users/heefan/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins
```

I cannot find anything about `Polychromatic` on my `Fonts & Color`
I am using Xcode 7.2.1

May I know what's the reason and how to fix? Thanks

Is this still happening? Or even part of the roadmap ? I remember an older issue open and came back to install again and try but it's still poorly behaving / not working.

I'd love to know if there are any plans for this :)

Thank you

If code is masked with #ifdefs, all classes in the nonactive parts will be colored. See the attached screenshot taken by creating an empty project, copying one method and disabling the code block.

UIApplication, NSDictionary, UIScreen, and UIColor are colored.

I have no idea, if it is possible, but it would be great, if the unused code is greyed out.

It would be nice if YES and NO could be seen in a Red/Green colour.
