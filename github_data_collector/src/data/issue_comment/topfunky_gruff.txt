## What is CodeTriage?

CodeTriage is an Open Source app that is designed to make contributing to Open Source projects easier. It works by sending subscribers a few open issues in their inbox. If subscribers get busy, there is an algorithm that backs off issue load so they do not get overwhelmed

Hi, I'm one of RMagick maintainers.

Recently we has fixed some errors related to installation and bugs in RMagick.

* Fixed some bugs for installation
  * Homebrew
    * https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick/pull/426
  * Windows
    * https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick/pull/315
    * https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick/pull/425
  * ArchLinux
    * https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick/pull/727

* Fixed some SEGVs
  * https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick/pulls?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+SEGV

* Improved memory usage
  * https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick/pull/697

* Add support for ImageMagick 7
  * https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick/pull/690

Now we are actively working to fix RMagick's bugs and working to add support for ImageMagick 7.
I hope Gruff's users receive these fixes with newer RMagick.

So, this PR will remove version restriction in RMagick.


And recently RMagick has supported Ruby 2.3 or later only.
So, Gruff will be also affected by this limitation. Sorry.
sometimes Line chart is not generated. If we re execute the same code it generates.
There is no logs generated for the errors.

It wasn't obvious to me what Debian packages I needed to install to get the gem working. This change is intended to make it more easy for others to get started with this great gem.

(Thanks for some nice software! :+1:)
Can Gruff support fallback fonts?
I know about setting font like:
graph.font = Rails.root.join("app", "assets", "fonts", "SourceHanSans-Regular.ttf").to_s
and this will cover CJK for me but in this case i lose Latin Cyrillic chars so i need fallback fonts. Is this possible to cover? 
I added an attribute for side bar charts which allows specifying how much space you want in between bar groups belonging to the same label.

**Problem:** the title is cut off at the begging and at the end. The original text is "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."

I would like to have a title that automatically adjusts to the graph image size. I don't have a preferential solution. However, I don't want to set a title size in my code depending on its amount of words.

*Note: I'm setting up a "Loren Ipsume" title to illustrate my point.*
