is there an attribute/tag to be called for altering constriants for optimization for device size? I have the below code but doesn't work using "iCarouselConstraint.constant" as this doesn't see to exist? The origina lcode was for changing the size of a static image.

The end goal is to have iCarousel resizing if it's an iphone 4/6 or ipad, so the app isn't bunched up (in my case play buttons)  and the view fills out good. Thanks


```
   
    func optimizeForDeviceSize() {
        
        // Adjust album size to fit iPhone 4s, 6s & 6s+
        let deviceHeight = self.view.bounds.height
        
        if deviceHeight == 480 {
            iCarouselConstraint.constant = 106
            
            view.updateConstraints()
        } else if deviceHeight == 667 {
            iCarouselConstraint.constant = 230
        
            view.updateConstraints()
        } else if deviceHeight > 667 {
            iCarouselConstraint.constant = 260
            view.updateConstraints()
        }
    }
```
    
It seems like when you add UI elements to the carousel the objects are initially loaded to the top right corner of the carousel space. And then the elements are translated to the correct location. But when you view elements with the accessibility inspector the elements keeps it's initial loaded location.
