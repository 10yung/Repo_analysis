Is this library Swift 5.0 compatible yet? Thanks! 
Is this possible to do? 

I want to add a image to the end of the progress line, which follows the line animation around the circle when its making progress.

I have try to animate using timer to repeat to call the function the animation only work two times after it's not working.
I only need a progress bar that doesn't require a background circle
I use 
```
progress!.animate(fromAngle: 0, toAngle: 360, duration: 10) { completed in
            if completed {
                print("completed")
            } else {
                print("animation stopped, was interrupted")
            }
        }
```
Then I want to stop animate I try call
```
progress?.stopAnimation()
```

It's work. But a few moment in console print completed also.

How I fix it ? 

Thank you.
> We always apply a 20% padding, stopping glows from being clipped

If there is no glow set, a 20% padding only makes the progress radius appear smaller than intended.
How to achieve this?
1. track background with inner shadow

Hi. The library is the best for circular thanks, but I Have a problem (see screen) how can I fix?

Hi,

Say I want to start the progress at the top. The progress color should begin with a light grey color and end with an (e.g.) red color when it has reached up to 360 degrees.
My question is how would I set this up?
startAngle would be -90.
clockWise would be true

But what would be the values for gradientRotateSpeed and the colors?
My best effort is:
gradientRotateSpeed = 0.25
colors: [.lightGray, .red]

I want to get as close as possible to the effect on the examples page with the orange progress bar.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
If we have three colours for the gradient: [Red, Green, Blue]
When circular progress is fully drawn, it is something like [Red, Green, Blue, Blue, Green, Red].

It would be nice to be able specify if I want this union of colours or I always want to have the three colours visible independently of the progress.

Examples:
For 10% I will fully see [Red, Green, Blue]
For 50% I will fully see [Red, Gree, Blue]
For 80% I will fully see [Red, Gree, Blue]
...

Is it possible to achieve this with current implementation?
