For large directories, getting checksum for each file is slow. The change is to get checksum from file list directly.
Im trying to backup my crontabs folder using this command:
` /home/pi/dropbox_uploader.sh upload /var/spool/cron/crontabs  /crontabs`
The first time that I run this, everything is fine and I get a new folder called crontabs under my dropbox apps folder.  ( _Dropbox > Apps > Backup >crontabs_ ) 
The second time that I run this line again without any changes ( as a weekly backup ), the API opens a new folder under the already existing folder, so i get this folder structure now:
_Dropbox > Apps > Backup > crontabs > **crontabs** _ 
The third time I run the same command I get:

> Creating Directory "/crontabs/crontabs"... FAILED
> Skipping file "/var/spool/cron/crontabs/pi", file exists with the same hash
> Skipping file "/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root", file exists with the same hash
Some error occurred. Please check the log.

**Why is it duplicated the folders and how can I prevent this?**

Thanks. 

If a filename contains a quote mark or backslash, dropbox_uploader fails:

```
$ ./dropbox_uploader.sh upload "testData/J. R. \"Bob\" Dobbs.txt" du_tests/
 > Uploading "/home/jlennox/Git/Dropbox-Uploader/testData/J. R. "Bob" Dobbs.txt" to "/du_tests/J. R. "Bob" Dobbs.txt"... FAILED
An error occurred requesting /upload
Some error occured. Please check the log.

 ./dropbox_uploader.sh upload 'testData/test\atest.txt' du_tests/
 > Uploading "/home/jlennox/Git/Dropbox-Uploader/testData/testtest.txt" to "/du_tests/testtest.txt"... FAILED
An error occurred requesting /upload
Some error occured. Please check the log.
```

Note that in the latter case, dropbox_uploader's console output is also mangled (it produces beep sounds when the literal `\a` is interpreted).

Fixes issue #486.
If I try to upload a file with a percent sign in its name, dropbox_uploader cannot upload it successfully.

```
$ ./dropbox_uploader.sh upload testData/test%20test.txt du_tests
 > No such file or directory: /home/jlennox/Git/Dropbox-Uploader/testData/test        0.000000e+00st.txt
Some error occured. Please check the log.
```
Any error coming out of read, really, but ^D is the most likely
candidate and what I'm aiming for.
Hi everyone, 
is there a way to tell the script to **not handle** dot files?

I just don't need them, and I would be happy to not look at them at all.

Thank you very much.
Fixes #378.
Fix: bug: not download empty file when local does not exist
And add new option -c : skip doing checksum
