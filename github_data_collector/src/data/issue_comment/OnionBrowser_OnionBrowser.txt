I made a new Google Doc, so everything is clear and fresh. The copy in this doc is the most recent that I have written for the Secrity Levels views.

Please look through and make any edits needed so we can get the onboarding completed and pushed! Thank you!

The current tab browser is too small and makes it difficult to manage tabs on small displays.
the PLUTO team thinks it's a good starting point toward helping the Tor Project build binaries that are compatible with iOS if we provide them a build script for their Travis build environment.  Here are instructions on doing so from teammate Hans:


- you already have the Tor/*.sh scripts for building the pieces in Tor.framework, so it should be pretty straightforward to put that into a standalone script to be ported to .travis.yml
- just do a script that starts fresh each time
- then use git submodule to init the git smobules
- then use git submodule to set the tor submodule to which ever commit you want to test
- then run the build
- git clone https://github.com/iCepa/Tor.framework.git

...with that xcode command line tool.  This can be viewed as the first in a series of steps we might take going forward.

Will this effect Onionbrowser, because itâ€™s based of the endless browser?
@mtigas 
@tladesignz 
Should we use per-server circuits?

https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en

Check out `EnforceDistinctSubnets` and `IsolateDestAddr` config options.

Could use a lot of resources according to this discussion:

https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/12268/isolatedestaddr-and-isolatedestport-usage

Idea came from this.

https://tb-manual.torproject.org/managing-identities/

> Even if you connect to two different sites that use the same third-party tracking service, Tor Browser will force the content to be served over two different Tor circuits, so the tracker will not know that both connections originate from your browser.
Testing onionbrowser with SSL Labs "SSL Client Test": 

https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/viewMyClient.html

There will be shown the browser accept weak ciphers.

plus there is no session tickets.
Tor researchers have some new ideas how to map friendly names into Onion Services V3. We should see what we can do with that!
Looks like we've got to get some new assets into https://github.com/OnionBrowser/OnionBrowser/tree/2.X/AppStore/Screenshots

Will try to do some of these over the weekend so I can submit 2.2.1 for review. I've got Search Ads already configured based on David's notes from last time we ran them (just paused the campaign after I configured it), so I think everything else is ready to go.

*edit: adding a checklist here*

The required sizes are 12.9 inch iPad Pro (2nd Gen), 12.9 inch iPad Pro (3rd Gen), 6.5 inch iPhone, 5.5 inch iPhone. After looking at the App Store metrics, it looks like App Store impressions in Russia actually outpace those in the U.S. Additionally, I think the Middle East is another focus area for our work. We didn't have an Arabic or a Russian localization when we last went through these, so I've added those to this checklist too.

**New sizes:** (If not complete, App Store will fall back to English screenshots.)

6.5 phone (Xs Max, Xs, etc. replaces 5.8 inch size for X/Xs):  
- [x] English
- [ ] Arabic
- [ ] Dutch
- [ ] French
- [ ] German
- [ ] Japanese
- [ ] Norwegian
- [ ] Portuguese (Brazil)
- [x] Russian
- [ ] Spanish (Spain)

12.9 iPad Pro 3, etc:  
- [x] English
- [x] Arabic
- [x] Dutch
- [x] French
- [x] German
- [x] Japanese
- [x] Norwegian
- [x] Portuguese (Brazil)
- [x] Russian
- [x] Spanish (Spain)

**Updates to sizes we had before:** (asterisk `*` indicates that we don't have an old version of this size, so App Store will default to English if we haven't uploaded screenshots for this language)

5.5 phone (8 Plus, 8, etc):  
- [x] English
- [x] Arabic*
- [ ] Dutch*
- [ ] French
- [ ] German
- [x] Japanese*
- [ ] Norwegian
- [x] Portuguese (Brazil)*
- [x] Russian*
- [ ] Spanish (Spain)

12.9 iPad Pro 2, etc:  
- [x] English
- [ ] Arabic*
- [ ] Dutch*
- [ ] French
- [ ] German
- [ ] Japanese*
- [ ] Norwegian
- [ ] Portuguese (Brazil)*
- [x] Russian*
- [ ] Spanish (Spain)
user comment:  the ability to lock/unlock the browser screen with the Home button like the DuckDuckGo browser does. Blurring the backgrounded snapshot is very good, but anyone can tap it and immediately see the web page you were reading. (Yes, there are plenty of users who still have and use the home button.)
