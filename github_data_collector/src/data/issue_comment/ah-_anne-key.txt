Also express the message-ACK relationship better. 

todo: propagate further up the stack with better error handling. 

implement #92, and may help with #20, #63. 
Looking at code I found that you are performing UB conversion from primitive to enum

https://github.com/ah-/anne-key/blob/ac02810007f55ee510d4c62d7d3ce9d6c54e7612/src/protocol.rs#L10-L35

```rust
#[repr(u8)]
#[non_exhaustive]
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]
pub enum MsgType {
    Reserved = 0,
    Error = 1,
    System = 2,
    Ack = 3,
    Reboot = 4,
    Macro = 5,
    Ble = 6,
    Keyboard = 7,
    Keyup = 8,
    Led = 9,
    FwInfo = 10,
    FwUp = 11,
    CustomLed = 12,
    CustomKey = 13,
}

impl From<u8> for MsgType {
    #[inline]
    fn from(b: u8) -> Self {
        unsafe { transmute(b) }
    }
}
```

You may argue "Hey, but there is an attribute", but in fact it doesn't work the way you expect and may produce panics in safe Rust:

https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=dd880f555dff38824b094dd8dec2f6f2

I'd better to be replaced with `num_derive`:
``````rust
#[repr(u8)]
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, FromPrimitive)]
pub enum MsgType {

Can I use anne-key to fix my problem? 
I know it was just announced, but wondering if we could have a tracking issue for what chipset it is, etc.
I would like this a lot, but I don't know if this is technically possible with this piece of hardware. Controlling individual leds would make a fun programmable toy, or it could bring a whole new set of off-screen indicators. Want this so bad that I'm willing to get into Rust and driver development for that to happen.
Would be pretty cool to be able to use the kb completely wired without having to switch to Bluetooth to change layout or lighting.
As a PoC it only parses one byte. Next up would be `buffer.pread::<Message>(0)`, but I haven't cooked up a multiplexing `try_from_ctx` for the different MsgType + XOp yet.

Further, we could have `buffer.pwrite::<LedTheme>` for sending the 0xca set-LED messages too.

It would be nice to have some of the [Tap Dance](https://docs.qmk.fm/features/tap-dance) functionality.

When i used it first (formerly known as e.g. double tap action) i felt in love with this feature it basically allows you to give a key more than one 'action' like: When you press and release 'A' just type an 'a', but when you press and hold 'A' you'll get 'Shift' this is called ACTION_TAP_DANCE_DOUBLE in Tap Dance.

You can find more details in the [docs](https://docs.qmk.fm/features/tap-dance).
I would like to request that the ability to use the keyboard in a Grub menu/BIOS is added, for example being able to use the F10 (Via FN+0) to access the BIOS on boot up, initially as a feature operated via USB cable connection and then also via Bluetooth Connection at a future point in time (If Bluetooth functionality of this type is possible with this keyboard), currently I cannot use my Anne Pro as my main keyboard because I need to have use of the F1-F12 (And other) keys at boot up, thanks for the work that you are doing to expand the Anne Pro's features & making it more stable
# Support for cursor control

Would be good to have cursor control as one of the available options in function layers. This would be great when using the keyboard without a dedicated mouse.
