Normally when building a base VM, getting the latest updates is desirable
The default encoding of en_US is ASCII, which causes certain packages (namely postgresql) to fail.  Explicitly declaring that we want to use UTF-8 fixes this.
Upgraded from sha1 to sha256
Use case: so one can easily SSH into a server and build a box without requiring X11 forwarding nor configuration changes
Had to use mirror URL b/c ubuntu removed the amd64 iso from the main site
The scripts currently create VMs which have a default username and password, as well as Vagrant's insecure key.  The key will be replaced when the box is deployed with Vagrant, however the password is never changed and SSH is forwarded to the VM by default.

This patch improves security by making sure a VM built with packer and deployed with Vagrant is fully patched, doesn't have a known SSH key pair, and does not allow SSH password login.  All of this can be changed by the user to get the previous behavior by changing the update variable and the newly added ssh_disable_password_auth to true.

A side effect of doing the security updates before building the box file is an efficiency gain over doing updates at deploy time for every VM.  The version was also incremented because this changes the default behavior of how the VM is built.

is there a way to have the boot_command/prefix support efi booting?

This same issue happens with ubuntu as well.
I have just tested `ubuntu1604` build with Hyper-V provider and I would like your feedback. Would you be interested in adding this provider to boxcutter? 

Few notes:
 - There is a trivial bug in `hyperv-iso` builder that prevents `boot_command` to be processed properly (https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/5184). With this fixed packer works as expected. 
 - Preseed is different because `linux-tools-$(uname -r)` and `linux-cloud-tools-$(uname -r)` are needed for obtaining guest IP and can't be installed during provisioning. 
 - Released box for testing - https://app.vagrantup.com/tsmolka/boxes/ubuntu1604 

```
    v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--audio", "none"]
    v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--draganddrop", "hosttoguest"]
```
Turn audio off and add drag-n-drop host to guest since bidirectional isn't working at this time.
