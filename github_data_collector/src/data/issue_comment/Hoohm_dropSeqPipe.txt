Hi,

This used to work for me with the older version of dropseqpipe but I updated it and am having so issues 30% half way through. Not sure if I am even setting this up correctly. I am trying to run a mix sample of human and mouse from Nadia. Any help would be great!

Thanks for this great package.

Just updated the documentation with major restructuring based on some  user feedback who found it was a bit confusing to follow.

It's now more logically structured in, 1) installing, 2) setting up an exeriment, 3) running
The files are renamed/merged to reflect that, i hope you agree with it!?
Most notably, the new `Setting-up-an-experiment.md` combines the now deleted clusters.md, Create-config-files.md and Reference-Files.md.

I thought to use a PR rather than push it directly to be able discuss the changes here.
Hi,

with colleague we run into some troubles when running your pipeline while being in active conda environment. Deactivating it solved our problems. I don't think it's relevant to dig this issue, but perhaps you could add a warning for this in your documentation. Or highlight it more if it is already there.

Cheers MM
Hello everyone,

I have encountered a violin plot failure which I am unable to resolve. I was able to generate the plot with previous data but suddenly the pipeline gives an error at this process and shuts down. 

This is the error message:

```
Error in rule violine_plots:
    jobid: 13
    output: /mnt/DATA/DropSeq_Philipp/dropSeqPipe_v04/results/plot/violinplots_comparison_UMI.pdf,

RuleException:

  File "/home/kirstin/Tools/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/concurrent/futures/thread.py", line 56, in run
```
I already tried to manually execute the R-script:

```
source activate /mnt/DATA/DropSeq_Philipp/dropSeqPipe_v04/.snakemake/conda/188c153d
Rscript --vanilla /mnt/DATA/DropSeq_Philipp/dropSeqPipe_v04/.snakemake/scripts/tmp7u_of87x.plot_violine.R
```
Which gives me that error:

`/mnt/DATA/DropSeq_Philipp/dropSeqPipe_v04/.snakemake/scripts/tmp7u_of87x.plot_violine.R': No such file or directory`

The summary folder contains the needed files, that's why I don't get the error message.
I am running DropSeqPipe_v0.4.

I would appreciate your help.

The pipeline does not seem to create the tmp files of the scripts within the batch/.snakemake/scripts directory. Which results in the crash of the following command: 

`source /home/mye/miniconda2/bin/activate '/data/sag/2019/MYE_18020068_2019_SingleCellTomBras/dropSeqPipe/batch1/.snakemake/conda/f854f536'; set -euo pipefail;  Rscript --vanilla /data/sag/2019/MYE_18020068_2019_SingleCellTomBras/dropSeqPipe/batch1/.snakemake/scripts/tmp5wipn0w_.plot_violine.R'`

With error:

`Fatal error: cannot open file '/data/sag/2019/MYE_18020068_2019_SingleCellTomBras/dropSeqPipe/batch1/.snakemake/scripts/tmp5wipn0w_.plot_violine.R': No such file or directory`

Is something going wrong with rights or directories? Any clues would be greatly appreciated.

I am noticing that I am losing over 50% of my reads because they are tagged with cell-barcodes that aren't "core" or aren't 1 edit distance away from a "core" cell-barcode. Some of the non-core cell-barcodes that are getting tossed out have more reads than the core ones. I am wondering why these aren't instead becoming core barcodes. I currently have my expected number of cell barcodes set to 4000 which is perhaps too low and is part of the problem. But I'm also wondering if some of the issue might be related to the order of the pipeline as it currently stands. Currently the order is:

Aligned.out.bam --> Aligned.merged.bam --> Aligned.repaired.bam --> gene_exon_tagged.bam --> gene_exon_tagged_bead_sub.bam --> final.bam

The set of core barcodes is set by running umi_tools whitelist on trimmmed_repaired_R1.fastq.gz. But wouldn't it be better to run it on the corrected barcodes (I.e. following DetectBeadSubstitutionErrors and DetectBeadSynthesisErrors)?

The repair_barcodes step doesn't seem to be in the most recent version of the Drop-seq_Alignment_Cookbook.pdf so I am just wondering what your logic is for doing it the way you are currently doing it. Thanks!


Hej,

I just got some data, generated with SureCell libraries on a ddSeq machine (i.e. the protocol by Illumina and Bio-Rad). I would like to test your pipeline for the analysis but I'm not sure if it can be used and if so how to fill the `config.yaml`.
Barcodes are in Read 1, however, they are not at a fixed position, and the cell barcode is split into three parts by spacer sequences:

![single-cell-rna-algorithm-tech-note-1070-2016-015](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4834905/43897355-00359906-9bdc-11e8-9dff-499322db761b.png)

Below is a small example from the first read fastq file of one of my samples.

Is it possible to process this data with dropSeqPipe?

Cheers

Hi There, thanks for putting all of this together!

I am just putting a few comments together as I seek to run this pipeline on a Rhesus Macaque sample. I'm downloading the GTF from ENSEMBL: 
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-92/gtf/macaca_mulatta

Initially this file didn't include a gene_name in the attribute column. This was leading to a NullPointerException in org.broadinstitute.dropseqrna.annotation.ReduceGTF

I manually added a gene_name attribute but now I'm getting an exception "Missing transcript_name"

Problems:
Missing transcript_name
	at org.broadinstitute.dropseqrna.annotation.GTFParser.next(GTFParser.java:97)
	at org.broadinstitute.dropseqrna.annotation.GTFParser.next(GTFParser.java:39)

	at picard.cmdline.PicardCommandLine.instanceMain(PicardCommandLine.java:94)
	at org.broadinstitute.dropseqrna.cmdline.DropSeqMain.main(DropSeqMain.java:42)

It would be helpful if there was a similar error message for gene_name missing and if there was documentation in the "reference files" section indicating that the transcript_name and gene_name attributes are required and may not be included directly in the ensembl download.
There are over 100 ensembl genes with the same name. Would be helpful to have unique identifiers used alongside gene names.
