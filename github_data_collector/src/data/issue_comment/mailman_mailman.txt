In the main `Mailman::Application#polling_loop` method, if an
error is raised in either `connection.connect` or
`connection.get_messages`, the critical section is retried `tries`
times. However, if configured to be polling, the `tries` variable
is not reset, so subsequent errors will cause endless retries.
This resets the `tries` variable at the start of the loop, thus
ensuring that there are only `tries` retries per poll.
`Mailman.config.rails_root = nil` is the same as default value '.'. If you want to disable rails loading you have to set `false`.

I have a problem getting body from the message. No matter if I call message.body.decoded or message.text_part.body.decoded the message body in Gmail looks like this:

--94eb2c0dea2087156d055350fc6b
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Hello, world!

--94eb2c0dea2087156d055350fc6b
Content-Type: text/html; charset="UTF-8"
```text
<div dir="ltr"><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Hello, world!</div></div>
```
--94eb2c0dea2087156d055350fc6b--

This is my code:
```ruby
Mailman::Application.run do
  default do
    begin
      Ticket.receive_mail(message)
    rescue Exception => e
      Mailman.logger.error "Exception occurred while receiving message:\n#{message}"
      Mailman.logger.error [e, *e.backtrace].join("\n")
    end
  end
end

class Ticket < ApplicationRecord
  def self.receive_mail(message)
    
    puts message.body.decoded
    
  end
end
```
I know that Gmail delivers mails both in text and html but I want just text. I have tried:
```ruby
puts message.text_part.body.decoded
```
But it doesn't work

Can you help me?

Is there any way to determine the os level filename for the email message being processed?  I'm not asking about the filename of any attachments, I need the filename of the actual email file.
I use the command line to start mailman as a daemon with something like

`RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec mailman -c mailmain/config.rb -p pids/mailman.pid`

But there seems to be no equivalent tos top mailman. I currently kill the process identified by the .pid file but was wondering if there is a command line for this.
hello, i'd like to apologize in advance 'cause a) this is not an issue and b) wrong place to put it but i'm out of ideas! looking for a reliable piece of documentation to setup and configure mailman using ubuntu or centos? 

thanks and sorry again
Now one email processed by an instance of a mailman. How can one mailman instance handle many email accounts?
