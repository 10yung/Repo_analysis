Adding Cypress as peer-dependencies to `@nrwl/cypress` package.

Updating Cypress package version.
## Current Behavior (This is the behavior we have today, before the PR is merged)

Changes to `nx.json` and `workspace.json` are not intelligently analyzed for which projects they touch.

## Expected Behavior (This is the new behavior we can expect after the PR is merged)

Changes to `nx.json` and `workspace.json` are intelligtently analyzed for which projects they touch.

* Modifying a project in one of these files (under `projects`) will cause only that project to be touched (thus affecting whichever projects depend on that project).
* Adding a new project will cause only the new project to be touched. Other projects which are updated in the same changeset to depend on them will be affected.
* Deleting a project will cause all projects to be touched. This is subject to change in the future, but currently, the information necessary to only affect projects that used to depend on those projects is not available in the project graph.

## Issue

work in progress
Adjusts the schematic to only touch the package.json if really required.

ISSUES CLOSED: #2317

@FrozenPandaz could you give this a look. 

Two open questions related to this:

- the verification of whether the package.json should be touched could be moved directly to the `ast-utils.ts` class and integrated in the `addDepsToPackageJson`. Let me know what you think about that.
- how do we test this? Just verifying the schematic result tree for the `package.json` in the unit test doesn't really work. Alternatively we could add an e2e and verify the log output. that would work for sure

Using the codebase as a really valuable learning opportunity (and writing a node based plugin/package) I moved some things around in the node and express schematic folders.
In case this is useful for you please let me know if I should change something.
Meanwhile I will keep reading... ;)

Is there any way to convert existing non-publishable nrwl library into a publishable library using any CLI command?
