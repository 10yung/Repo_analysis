> ## v4.3.0 - September 24th, 2019
> Fixes:
> 
> - Security: Disallow calling "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" directly - 2078c72
> - Disallow calling "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" directly - 2078c72
> 
> Features:
> 
> - Add new runtime option `allowCallsToHelperMissing` to allow calling `blockHelperMissing` and `helperMissing`.
> 
> Breaking changes:
> 
> Compatibility notes:
> - Compiler revision increased - 06b7224
>   - This means that template compiled with versions prior to 4.3.0 will not work with runtimes >= 4.3.0
>     The increase was done because the "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" are now moved from the helpers
>     to the internal "container.hooks" object, so old templates will not be able to call them anymore. We suggest
>     that you always recompile your templates with the latest compiler in your build pipelines.
> 
> - Disallow calling "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" directly - 2078c72
>   - Calling "helperMissing" and "blockHelperMissing" directly from a template (like in `{{blockHelperMissing}}` was 
>     never intended and was part of the exploits that have been revealed early in 2019 
>     (see https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). *It is also part of a new exploit that 
>     is not captured by the earlier fix.* In order to harden Handlebars against such exploits, calling thos helpers 
>     is now not possible anymore. *Overriding* those helpers is still possible.
>   - If you really need this behavior, you can set the runtime option `allowCallsToHelperMissing` to `true` and the
>     calls will again be possible
> 
> Both bullet points imly that Handlebars is not 100% percent compatible to 4.2.0, despite the minor version bump.
> 
> We consider it more important to resolve a major security issue than to maintain 100% compatibility.

Several methods in `neon-runtime` have a large amount of casting. We should update the `neon-runtime` methods to use the same types as `N-API` to reduce the large volume of casting and potential for bugs.

### Description:

Trying to do a conditional compilation using `neon build --features=mock`

### Expected behaviour

Build with `mock` feature

### Actual behaviour

```
UNKNOWN_OPTION: Unknown option: --features
...
```

Updated: Sorry I didn't realize I missed the `--feature's'`. But after changing to `--features` the problem still exists. Thanks.
