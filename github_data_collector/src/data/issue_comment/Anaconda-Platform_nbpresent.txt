I just freshly installed nbpresent with conda. When I try to run it I receive the following error:

```shell
$ nbpresent -i notebook_name.ipynb -o presentation_namehtml -f html
Traceback (most recent call last):

FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/user_name/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/nbpresent/static/nbpresent/css/nbpresent.min.css'
```

I checked the folder and there is not even a `css` folder. With pdf output I try the same error message (save the traceback path).

I am on ubuntu 18.04.

Any ideas?
After download the slide using the web 'download as presentation' function, the reveal.jr html file cannot properly function. By properly, I mean the presentation cannot flip over to the second page, while on the web service it works perfectly. 
macosx 10.12.5
python 3.6
anaconda3  5.2
jupyter 5.6.0
it is not working? >>

Any plans to support jupyterlab ?

I am requesting the option to save slides with custom regions as templates that are reuseable between notebooks.  In other words:

1. New slide
2. Edit regions
3. Save template 
4. Open new notebook
5. Use custom template

Thank you.
Hey all,

Loving this functionality in the Notebook!

I'm having some problems reordering slides properly, especially in larger presentations. Dragging the slide to a new position doesn't reorder it in the edit view; it just pops back to its original position.

Cheers!

As requested in https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/issues/489#issuecomment-274207331, this is a reminder to add yaml files for [jupyter_nbextensions_configurator](https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator).
I'm using nbpresnt 3.0.2 on firefox ESR 45.4.

When I open the slide mode, I see a list of slides on the bottom of my screen. I can grab one of those slides with the mouse and move them. When I then start the presentation, the slides are shown in the new order. However, the display in the bottom tool bar which the slide previews does not update, it still keeps the old order. So, the presentation does not show slides from left to right any longer, but jumps around. 
That becomes a problem if I want to do more reordering and take a second slide and drag it around. Now I don't really know which one is which any longer making it hard to pick the right one.
In the new nbpresent library is the mouse onclick event missing, which is needed for external mouse presenters where a slide show is presented by right or left click on a mouse button. I'm missing this implementation !
