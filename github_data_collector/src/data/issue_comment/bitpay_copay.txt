I transferred money from Blockchain to copay and never was able to get my funds from copay. I feel abused. My money was stolen and I am unable to gain access.

Hi.
 I am writing this text message because I got some problems.
So I made withdrawal yesterday from Binance platform to bitcoin wallet ( the guy I sent money has an account in your platform). 

I sent tetherUS (around 90$) to bitcoin wallet — that’s the problem. 

Now those money I don’t have on my account and the guy I was sending money didn’t get it. 

I already texted to Binance and tether.to support but they could not help me just both of them recommended to text you as a receiving party platform. 

Could you please help me with it? 

In attachment sending you confirmation of transaction.

I am one of 6 signers on a copay 3 of 6 multisig wallet.  two of us still have our copay for windows wallets operational.  Three of the others have lost their copay wallets but not their phrases.  These phrases have  BTC and BHC.  When I enter any of the three phrases into my current version of the bitpay multisig wallet, with either BTC or BHC selected as derivation path, I get a message that says this in the title:
"WE COULDN'T FIND YOUR WALLET
There are no records of your wallet on our servers. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.  Go back or  Continue Anyway" These are bip44 phrases.  If I continue anyway i wind up with either an empty generic BTC or a BHC wallet being added to my Bitpay wallet.  
This happens on all three of the phrases we are trying to import.  We have the phrases correctly preserved and the spelling is correct when imported to the bitpay wallet.  Can some one help?
Hi!

I tried to deposit money from my copay to neteller as usual but kept getting error message when I pasted BTC address that I have insufficient funds.. I kinda know that this means the funds in my wallet are lower then the recommended bitcoin miner fee lever for getting a transaction added to the Bitcoin blockchain ("confirmed") . But I dont know what to do in practice to be able to deposit my funds onto neteller now.. Im also a noob when it comes to stuff like this.. Could anyone help me step by ste what to do?
How does the Copay website comes to know that an incoming transaction has been confirmed? Does it continuously polls BWS service or any blockchain explorer to know if a transaction has been confirmed?
- Enter incorrect passcode several times
- Wait until “try again in...” timer appears
- Force-close the app or wait until it’s unloaded from ram
- Open the app X hours later
- Timer still shows the same time
