Some eventlogs and data pulled the PID and PPID are shown either in binary or hex, both version should be included in objects for flexibility. 
This script pulls the list of domains queried from the Windows Event Log - DNS Client. By default the list is then compared to the top 5000 domains. 

This is my first time submitting a PowerShell script, I apologize for the terrible code. The top 5000 domains are included  as a compressed string. I chose this because it's easy to transport in the code, but I can provide as a separate file if that would be better. Also, currently the code doesn't take into account country codes (e.g. google.co.uk would be a false positive).
Gets a file's encoding type.
