I am having a problem, when uploading the CSS it won't take any changes on the theme, I have to refresh the page many times for the change to work, it is not a cache problem as this is happening on many pc and different browsers, any help would be appreciated.

Hi for some reason there's a conflict with the theme when using The Events Calendar Plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/) in wordpress. The Previous and Next navigation function don't work. But when I use other wordpress themes the navigation function works.  
Do anyone know how to fix this? 
Thanks

What do you think of using `figure` and `figcaption` tags instead `wp-caption` and `wp-caption-text` classes?

I'm new to all this, so forgive me if this is obvious.

I don't get why there's an _ directory, first.
and then _\js\ which has an ancient (or super-new?) version of jquery in it
and then _\inc\js which has more js stuff in it.

And why in functions.js does it use the old version of $(document).ready(function ()  instead of 
$(function () {....

I've been trying to find just your basic theme with no gimmicks and this looks mighty gimmicky. Any help?

I've seen that some clases that uses wordpress in the post like "alignright", "wp-caption"... isn't in the CSS, maybe aligns classes should be added,

Also, is inc folder inside of it a customized version of the options framework plugin? If so, what was changed about it?

There was a pretty generic error posted about someone having issues loading jQuery with a specific plugin, which could have been due to a standard request being blocked from a SSL enabled site.

By checking if WP is running in SSL mode, we can be 100% sure the user gets the right protocol queued.

Change #submt to #submit in style.css, basic typo.

the editor content.css is getting bypassed because of the reset,
I wish there would be custom-editor-style.css already set up to make both editor content in admin screen identical to what really looks like in the actual page content.

Just to eliminate confusion, move the calls to the stylesheets and scripts all to the functions.php file. This has the benefit of having all your loading taking place in one location for reference. Even better, with the all the loading taking place in functions.php, you can take advantage of WordPress' conditional functions for a rudimentary script loader.
