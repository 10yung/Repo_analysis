Currently if I set up `Player` like:
```swift
let player = Player()
player.playbackLoops = true
```
And then set the  local `URL` +  `play()` on it I'm getting it played only once. I checked what `PlayerPlaybackDelegate` reports  and it reports a couple of `playerCurrentTimeDidChange`s and then `playerPlaybackDidEnd`.

Do we have a regression? It was (and still) works fine in 0.13.1 
I would like to be able to play an array of videos. Currently, Player only supports playing 1 AVPlayerItem at a time. I'd like loop through the array of videos and play them in order. The videos are in .m3ua. Is anyone already working on this? If not I'll make a PR
@piemonte 

I have a stories like feed going on and for memory purposes, once a "story" is advanced, I clean up the player in the previous VC by setting `player.playerView.playerLayer.player = nil` which works,. 

But most important to free up memory I found is to `playerLayer.removeFromSuperlayer()`

 This works fine if I use my own `AVPlayer | AVPlayerLayer` instance but removing it from `(player.playerView.layer as? AVPlayerLayer)?.removeFromSuperlayer()` produces a crash. 

Why is that?
startupTime - Stream startup time measured in seconds.
totalDurationWatched - Total time spent playing, obtained from the AccessLog.
timeWeightIBR - Time weighted value of the variant indicated bitrate.
stallRate - Stall rate measured in stalls per hour.
stallWaitRatio - Stall time measured as duration-stalled / duration-watched.
Hi

Any idea?
Thank you

We are using Player to play video inside a collectionview with cells that are full screen.

Is there an example on how to properly use Player inside a reusable cell?

It is better if with H.264 hardware accelerator (VideoToolBox) function.
Hi,

I just started using this component in my tvOS app and cannot find how to display the controls like AVPlayer one and use the AppleTV remote!

Thanks,
