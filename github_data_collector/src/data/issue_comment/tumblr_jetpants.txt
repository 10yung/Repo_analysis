Hi :)

Any idea on how i can solve this ?
(or telling me what i do wrong...)


```shell
$ ~/jetpants/bin# ./jetpants
Notice: no plugin has overridden Topology#load_pools, so no pools are imported automatically
Heads-up: You're not using screen or tmux.
/var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/jetpants-0.8.2/lib/jetpants.rb:104:in `method_missing': undefined method `debug_exceptions' for Jetpants:Module (NoMethodError)
	from ./jetpants:1031:in `<main>'
```
Hi guys. Thx for u'r great soft.
Tell me pls, is there a solution in jetpants for adding (not clone) slave for single master (without any other slaves). (maybe, by using Percona XtraBackup or some other "hot" backup utilities)?
I didn't find any stuff like this in jetpants.

The example results in errors  when doing a shard cutover, digging reveals it should probably be:

```
sharded_tables:
    shardname:
        tablename:
            sharding_key: user_id
            chunks: 200
```
