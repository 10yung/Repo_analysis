Hallo gtrendsR team,

I want to thank you again for your great job. 

I was wandering if it is possible to extend the list of categories. For example the online version includes the topic/category 'biodiversity' but it is not available in gtrendsR.

Or is there maybe a work-around?

Thanks a lot
Sergei 
Hello! 
I had some trouble with the function **gtrends**
 
This is my code:

```r
#define the keywords
keywords=c("Trump","Clinton")
#set the geographic area: DE = Germany
country=c('DE')
#set the time window
time=("2016-01-01 2016-11-27")
#set channels 
channel='web'
trends = gtrends(keywords, gprop =channel,geo=country, time = time )
```

This is the error I get:

```
"Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = .pkgenv[["cookie_handler"]]) : 
  schannel: failed to receive handshake, SSL/TLS connection failed"
```

Is somebody able to help me out?
Thank you for the support! :) 
Some geographical codes do not exist in the "countries" data set. 
For example, Madrid region in Spain is ES-MD and does not exist in the data("countries").
Thanks!
This is the easy fix. A more far reaching solution would be to abandon the anytime::anydate() and anytime() function and use fixed formats... or somehow make sure that the tz parameter supplied by the user is taken into account appropriately with the anytime::anytime function... my feeling is this may create problems...

Nevertheless, please test this version, as I am not affected by the bug. I have tried to check with the explanations given in #322 by @eddelbuettel . 
I'm not sure if this is a bug or not. 

But changing `2004-01-01` to `2004-01-02` works fine and the starting date for the data is `2004-02-01`

```r
gtrends(c("NHL", "NFL"), time = "2004-01-01 2019-11-30")
```
yields an error 

```
Error: Cannot parse the supplied time format.
```

I fail to retrieve "related topics" in any language other than English.
It must be a problem of my setup, and not the package, but I have no idea how to solve it.
Would appreciate any clues.
Hello again,

I think a very useful improvement would be to automatically "stitch" together weekly time series for queries that span more than 5 years. That way, the user can have very long weekly time series instead of having only monthly time series. T

here are studies on the net that show that it is simply a matter of renormalizing the series which is straighforward as long as there is some overlap between the two 5 year weekly pull.

What do you think?
Hi,
There is an option when I search for more than one keyword to obtain a compared breakdown by city, that gives me the percentage of searches that went to each keyword for the given keywords searched. Is this possible to download with gtrendsR?
I attach an example here:

https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=GB&q=apple%20pie,chocolate%20cake,lemon%20pie,carrot%20cake


Thank you!

Google Trends gives you the option to see results for just the company not the search term. For example, I want to see results for "Apple" the company not "Apple" the search term. Is this functionality possible in gtrendsR? 
I'm having trouble understanding results from an or-query. When I do the following or-query for searches for dog or cat by DMA, I get results for about 73 DMAs, with 140 or so "NA" results:

res <-gtrends('dog+cat', geo= c("US"), time ="2017-01-01 2018-01-01")
res$interest_by_dma

Seemingly, most DMAs don't search cat or dog very much. 
However, if I run the following commands for just dog, I get results for every single DMA:

res <-gtrends('dog', geo= c("US"), time ="2017-01-01 2018-01-01")
res$interest_by_dma

How is it possible that search volume for Cat or Dog is less than that for just Dog?
What's wrong here?
Thanks so much.
