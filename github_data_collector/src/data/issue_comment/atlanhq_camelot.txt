Hello Mr. Mehta,
I am new to python and migrating from MATLAB. I wanted to convert a bunch of pdf files which has plots and tables in it into .csv. But issue when i want it to read the file reads plots as tables and later by using flavor = 'stream' got it to read tables but only reads one table. My file has two tables and two plots. To begin with my code is not even recognizing both the tables. Tablelist says n = 1. Pasting my code below. Can't find a place to attach my file for more info. Let me know if i could do that. In the Below code when used camelot.plot(tables[0], kind='text') shows the file in the console but only reads one table.  Any help is appreciated.
Thanks
``import camelot
# import pandas as pd
tables = camelot.read_pdf("2019_11_20_9_31_40-S550-012-00000000XC253927_Torsional RPM Ramp RMS.pdf",flavor = 'stream')
tables 
tables[0].df
camelot.plot(tables[0], kind='text')
camelot.plot(tables[0], kind='grid')
camelot.plot(tables[0], kind='contour')

Hi Team,
@vinayak-mehta 
I am getting this issue Camlot in Lambda. 
Ghostscript is installed in Lambda Layer. But camelot library is unable to read ghostscript binaries. 
And giving the error Please make sure that Ghostscript is installed. 
I set path of gs. And It is showing gs 9.27 is installed in /opt/bin/gs/ path.
Function Logs:

b'9.27\n'
import camelot
camelot.read_pdf('file_name.pdf',pages='all', flavor='lattice')
when i tried to run the command in LINUX machine i am facing a issues like 'Segmentation fault ' SIGSEGV error...
could some one help me out ?
As per the documentation [here](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/advanced.html#tweak-layout-generation) - camelot.read_pdf accepts a dictionary layout_kwargs that can include the options to pdfminer [LAParams](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer/blob/master/pdfminer/layout.py#L33). However, when including 'boxes_flow' keyword to layout_kwargs - I get error:
`TypeError: get_page_layout() got an unexpected keyword argument 'boxes_flow' `

I checked that I can run LAParams with this option in pdfminer directly
I have read the other issues reported like this one and I have tried _all_ the suggested solutions but _none of them work_.

I use Python 3.x via Jupyter Notebook on Windows 7 Enterprise.  I also have ghostscript and tk installed. 

Thank you in advance for your help.

My code is:
```
import camelot
tables = camelot.read_pdf('test.pdf')
```

and I get the error:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-41-dd79b35b59da> in <module>
      1 import camelot
----> 2 tables = camelot.read_pdf('test.pdf')

AttributeError: module 'camelot' has no attribute 'read_pdf'
```

the tool is excellent in extracting tables from pdf! i love it.
but i can extract many tables from one pdf and i just only need one table i want located at page n.
How could i locate?

does this  tool provide a function for search key information and locate designated page i want?
Hi, I would like to know that will this work on data if the data is tabular in nature, but does not have the separator lines in between.
For instance, if there is a marks sheet of a person, but the things are just written as follows:

<img width="286" alt="Screenshot 2019-11-18 at 10 17 49 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7932417/69072218-4eddaa00-0a51-11ea-95a9-236af249c628.png">

Would it give able to give me this data in a tabulated format?
[There seems to be an issue with closing the file when using multiple functions.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58634284/resourcewarning-unclosed-file-with-camelot-py) The issue is not raised if the parameters that are passed into the read_pdf come from the same function but if they are passed in from another function than the issue seems to appear.

I think camelot have compatability encoding issue with pdfminer.
I cannot read my pdf file because of the Error above.
I can read the text using another library named 'pdfminer', but pdfminer cannot read table automobily. So I want to use camelot.

How can I process this Error?
