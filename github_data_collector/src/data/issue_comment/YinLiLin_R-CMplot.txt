Dear LiLin-Yin,
      Thanks so much for your R package "CMplot". But when I use this package to draw an SNP density map, I found that the color of this map can not be changed, the color is always "darkgreen , yellow and red". (this code: `col=c("darkgreen", "yellow", "red")`) The map change nothing when i change these colors. I thought that maybe the code"col" have some problem. So I tell you this problem at here and hope you can  modify this problem. Thanks again! 


                                                                                                                                        Yours, 
                                                                                                                                        Jiazi Zhang
Hello Lilin,
I performed a density plot using genetic distances, but window size is expressed in Mb, it is possible to change windows units?
Thanks in advance

Hello Lilin,
I recently started to use CMplot. It's a great package
I'm trying to make a circular manhattan plot. I can't add legend name (traits) for each circle.
If I write `cir.legend=TRUE` nothing happens
My entire code is:
```
`colnames(cmplot3)` <- c("SNP name", "Chr", "Position", "Z49_17A", "Z49_17B", "Z49_17C")
CMplot(cmplot3, plot.type = "c",col=c("grey30","grey60"), dpi = 300, 
       threshold=c(1e-3), cir.legend = T,chr.den.col=c("darkgreen","yellow","red"), 
       signal.col=c("red"), cir.legend= ,chr.labels=paste("Chr",c(1:7)))
```


best,

Maximiliano


Hello YinLiLin,

Thank you very much for this function.
I have two questions concerning the highlighting of SNPs.

1) Is it possible to add names to certain SNPs without changing their colour? Of course, I could manually write the chromosome colour to the highlight.col vector but is their a way to do this automatically without having to look up the chromosome colour of each SNP first?

2) I'd like to plot 3 traits with multracks in separate axes and label/highlight the lead SNPs of each trait, i.e. I need separate highlight vectors for each trait. Is that possible?   


Thank you :)
Hi,

Thank you for providing this excellent tool!
I got an error in repeating adding gene name, can you please give me a favor?

Thank you very much!

Hi,

It would be great if you could add in a function to make stratified QQ plots. For instance stratified by bins of info-score (_e.g._ https://github.com/swvanderlaan/MetaGWASToolKit/blob/master/SCRIPTS/plotter.qq_by_info.R) and minor allele frequency (_e.g._ https://github.com/swvanderlaan/MetaGWASToolKit/blob/master/SCRIPTS/plotter.qq_by_caf.R). These are great diagnostic tools to review which the best filtering settings are for the data.

Best,

Sander


Hello! I want to change current default unit (Mb) to Kb, but I don't know which parameter I should changeï¼ŸHope your reply~Thanks!
Hi @YinLiLin ,
I would like to draw a Manhattan Plot to illustrate the distribution of Fst for each chromosome, so the range of y-axis should be set from 0 to 1. when I set the ylim as (0,1), I got this :
![2019-09-05_141514](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44871713/64316555-c1f58980-cfe7-11e9-91dd-8386c96227d3.png)

However, I wanted to add some scales in this axis, so I added some codes behind the plotting code as below :

+ axis(2,at=seq(0,1,0.2))

And I got this

How can I fix this issue, thanks in advance.

Hi Lilin,
Hope you are doing good.
I made nice plots, thanks for the package. But I am confused about how to provide the space to label each circle. I have attached an example file where each circle is labeled as a b c d..
![Example Picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46428510/63327431-d11fda80-c34b-11e9-8619-64a419d970dc.png)

Could you please help me out.
Kind regards,
Manjusst
