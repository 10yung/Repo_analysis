I'd like to see a basic implementation of a macro for Python-style list and map comprehensions, and decide whether it would be a better teaching example for function-like proc macros than the current `seq!` project.

Something like:

```rust
let squares_map = c![n => n*n for n in 0..100 if n % 5 != 0];
```

Suggested by @jonhoo.
Is there a presentation or book or blog posts that can be followed to learn the necessary knowledge required to accomplish the workshop ?
