MacOS: 10.15.2
BitWarden: 1.16.6

OS-level settings are set via `NSTextInsertionPointBlinkPeriodOn` and `NSTextInsertionPointBlinkPeriodOff` and the caret in most (if not all) other apps honors this setting. However, Bitwarden does not.

Since I received the following Windows updates, the "hide to tray" functionality doesn't work anymore.

The good thing is that the app still works after the exception -- at least I didn't notice any misbehaviour so far.

In regard to #111 : it's the non-store version I've got here.
The app window opens, but it won't make it past the loading screen:

Not sure if this is a GTK issue of some sort but I am getting this issue in the file browser and the about screen... see the attached screenshot

This also applies for the browser extensions.

It should be possible to change the master password locally as the REST API allows to do this and there is no reason to redirect users from the local client to the Web UI of the vault installation to change the password.

As for the reasoning (putting on my tin foil hat): I can easily verify the version of locally installed clients (and potentially prevent updating them). However, I have no easy way to see if the source code of the Vault Web UI has been updated / potentially compromised (this applies for the official Bitwarden site as well as for self hosting).

Brave extension does not appear in the 'Get Web Browser extension" of the Desktop application.

I import the data from keepass, and I created lots of folder before. When I deleted a folder, all the subfolders appear, what? I have to delete them one by one?
I am a new user trying to run Bitwarden on Debian Buster. I downloaded the AppImage but when I click on it, nothing happens. I do see this error logged:

FATAL:setuid_sandbox_host.cc(157)] The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that tmp/.mount_Bitwar6JkWbK/chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.

Not sure how to proceed with this. I can't set those permissions because it is an AppImage and it temporarily creates those folders then exits with the error.

I have several other AppImages that run as expected.

I am using the latest version downloaded from the website.
