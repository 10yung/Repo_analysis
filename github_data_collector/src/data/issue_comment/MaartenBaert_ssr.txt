I would like to express my thanks to Maarten Baert for creating such great software!
Thanks!
If an OpenGL game is launched in full screen, right after stopping recording it loses focus the moment encoding pop-up shows up. Some games might not even be able to take back control afted the dialog closes and the input to that game might be rendered as broken.

The prime example is minetest running in full screen, and while ingame, after stopping the recording it loses focus w/o a way to get back in, where the cursor is shown instead of the game being in focus and be controlled by mouse and keyboard.

**OS:** Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Xfce 4.12
**Affected game:** Minetest 5.1.0
**SSR Version:**
```
SimpleScreenRecorder 0.3.11
Compiled with GCC 7.4.0
Qt: header 5.9.5, lib 5.9.5
libavformat: header 57.83.100, lib 57.83.100
libavcodec: header 57.107.100, lib 57.107.100
libavutil: header 55.78.100, lib 55.78.100
libswscale: header 4.8.100, lib 4.8.100
```

Can we stop recording after "n" minutes, where n is a user defined parameter?
Hello I get in Linux Buster Intel 64 bit. When recording a constantly black video as if he does not find the monitor. Even the preview shows only a black picture.
the title probably isnt very clear, but is there a way to somehow get the ffmpeg command SSR calls, with all the options attached?

something like: `ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 200x100 -framerate 10 -show_region 1 -i :0.0+10,10 -f pulse -ac 2 -i 7 video.mp4`

im sure it doesnt look like this at all, but is there a way to get it?
Can it do Motion Detection?
thx
Hey there! This is a great project, exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately for me, I hadn't installed it earlier because I didn't realize that it had a GUI for doing the recording. There wasn't a whole lot of description in the README so I didn't know if it was just a commandline tool or a user-friendly GUI.

It would be great to have screenshots of it in the README along with maybe a little bit more explanation of what it provides.
It would be nice if the file extension was automatically appended, or was autofilled in the filename entry box. Took me a little but to figure out why a file upload was being rejected, and it was because `myfile` wasn't a recognised mp4 file, but changing to `myfile.mp4` fixed this. 
Hi Maarten.

My use case is: I'm making a screencast with SSR (0.3.8) to demonstrate how to use different audio jack-enabled apps. One of those apps is Claudia, an audio/MIDI session manager based on LADISH.

During the screencast, I have to stop the claudia-studio to for the user demonstration purpose, then to relaunch it. A part of Claudia stopping the studio is that Claudia kills jack. My issue here is that when cutting jack off, SSR stops recording complaining that jack isn't there anymore (which is obviously true).

What I would like is SSR to keep recording maybe by auto-switching itself to a "none" audio recording when jack disappears, then automatically switch back to jack when it does reappears.

That said, I know that we're not in a magic world and I have no clue if that is already doable, or if that would need a lot of code, or whatever. Just wanting to share the thought with you @MaartenBaert in case of it does ring a bell.

Anyway, thanks for SSR, still a wonderful piece of software!
Hey there,
  I can't tell you enough how much I love SSR. I was using Peek before and it is garbage compared to this. I was wondering though if it were at all possible to request a feature? I pretty much always use the same settings, the only thing I end up changing is the "Select Rectangle" and then I start recording, stop and save. I do a lot of development in the Unity game engine so I often want to quickly be able to select and area and record what something is doing so I can send it to a friend or similar. So my request is, would it be at all possible to have something of a "quick record" feature? I see that when SSR is opened there is a tray icon, so perhaps if there was a "close to tray" and it could stay opened, then add a hotkey for directly initiating the "Select Rectangle", then once selected I could just hit the record hotkey without ever having to open the main window and flip through the settings pages to get to the selection and the record button.  

 Another option would be instead of having it sitting on the tray, if I could call from script something like ./simplescreenrecorder --selectrectangle --startrecord --timer 3   this might allow me to start the application minimized, begin selecting the rectangle area and then after a 3 second timer (or just by hotkey again) it would automatically start recording. That was I could set a keyboard shortcut to that command and be able to set different settings flags. 

  Along with those, if either of them are able to be done, once the recording is stopped/finished, if it could bring up the main menu right to the save screen (is there a way to preview of what was recorded before saving it?) so it could either be saved or canceled and started over. 

  Lastly, this one is not dependent at all on the others and would just be a nice overall addition. If there could be an option to automatically open to the folder in which the video was just saved after it is completed, that would be awesome.

None of these are show-stoppers for me or anything, but I record often enough that they would be super beneficial!
Again, love the application, keep up the great work!
Thanks,
-MH
