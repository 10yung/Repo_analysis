Is there a way to get the output as bitmap, rather than setting it directly to the ImageView.
HIï¼ŒWhy doesn't it work, the code is 
Blurry.with(this)
                .radius(10)
                .sampling(8)
                .async()
                .capture(findViewById(R.id.iv_logo))
                .into(findViewById(R.id.iv_logo));

I have not `ImageView` instead of this, I have `LinearLayout` . and this has the `background`. how can set blurry on the image of this?

```
<RelativeLayout
    android:id="@+id/include_sliding_panel_childtwo"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto">


//this is my linearLayout
        <LinearLayout
            android:id="@+id/play_list_bg"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            android:layout_above="@+id/bottom_palyLayout2"
            android:layout_alignParentStart="true"
            android:layout_alignParentTop="true"
            android:background="@drawable/bg_player"
            android:clickable="true"
            android:focusable="true"
            android:orientation="vertical">

//this is my linearLayout


            <RelativeLayout
                android:id="@+id/rl_small"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="?attr/actionBarSize">

                <include
                    android:id="@+id/slidepanelchildtwo_topviewone"
                    layout="@layout/include_slidepanelchildtwo_topviewone"
                    android:layout_width="match_parent"
                    android:layout_height="?attr/actionBarSize"
                    android:visibility="invisible"/>
```

I have blurred the imageView with
`Blurry.with(context).capture(view).into(imageView)`
but there is no function for reverting the imageView to initial state. delete() function gets only ViewParent as input.
it seems 
`delete(ImageView target)`
function is missed.
thanks
Small elements in image do not properly blur. Specially texts.

The whole screen is a image.
```
Blurry.with(context)
                        .radius(8)
                        .sampling(8)
                        .animate(500)
                        .onto(parentView);

Blurry.with(context)
                        .radius(8)
                        .sampling(8)
                        .from(image)
                        .onto(imageView);
```

Using:
Version 3.0.0

I have problem with this library while running on Android 4.4.4, Device modal
Lenovo A936.

My BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION is 28.0.3. 

 renderscriptTargetApi 18
 renderscriptSupportModeEnabled true

How can I resolve this issue?

Getting a bellow type of error.

**android.renderscript.RSRuntimeException: Fatal error 33619969, details:

Hi,
 Thanks for providing this library. It is working good in most cases.

But I have encountered a scenario, where I need to blur the view whenever an **Alert dialog** is displayed.

In this case, blur does occur, **but** it looks very weird. 
It seems as if the blur is shifting downwards respective to original view instead of overlapping the view(which should ideally happen).

What I did was exactly similar to other scenarios,
ie. when displaying the alert dialog, I fetched the view which is to be blurred and set the blur on it as soon as dialog is displayed.

Can you guys recreate the same scenario and observe the behaviour.

Also, if anyone who tried the same, can you help out with the issue. Its been bothering me since long time and I need to fix this.

Thanks !!
Hello,
We are currently using your library in one of our application. Actually we need a favour from your side. According to the Google Play Policy, all apps have to provide support for at least API level 26 which is not satisfied in your case. We are targeting API level 28. So can you please provide us support for API level 28 in your current repository?
I have a parent layout with header and viewpager and from the viewpager I have three tabs with listview.

When clicking on lisview tab I should make whole view blurable. How to achieve? Please let me know your thoughts on this
