When building my project with RN 0.60.4 and react-native-spinkit 1.4.0 I get the following warning:

`warn Package react-native-spinkit has been ignored because it contains invalid configuration. Reason: "commands" must be an array`

I've config for ios and run on simulator, rn-spinkit@1.2.0 using pod file. But it show only a square with animation, instead spinner ? how can fix it ? 
im trying to use spinkit react native library and its working on ios but when i export it on android i get this log

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring project ':app'.
> Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':app:_debugApk'.
   > A problem occurred configuring project ':react-native-spinkit'.
      > Could not find support-compat.aar (com.android.support:support-compat:26.1.0).
        Searched in the following locations:
            https://jcenter.bintray.com/com/android/support/support-compat/26.1.0/support-compat-26.1.0.aar
any ideas?
It should fix https://github.com/maxs15/react-native-spinkit/issues/46  https://github.com/maxs15/react-native-spinkit/issues/93

Not sure why `react-native-spinkit` will lead to an install of React 0.11 in Pod,  that's the root cause of those errors mentioned in two issues.

But anyway, `__has_include` is enough to fix it
 ```npm -v 5.6.0```


I added `"react-native-spinkit": "^1.1.1"` in my package.json file then run `npm install`. I see that `package-lock.json` was also updated with the package I added. But when I run webpack, I am getting the error message below.

```
ERROR in ./~/react-native-spinkit/index.js
Module parse failed: /opt/app-root/src/themes/bootstrap_patterns/node_modules/react-native-spinkit/index.js Unexpected token (16:18)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.
| class Spinkit extends React.Component {
| 
| 	static propTypes = {
| 		type: PropTypes.string,
| 		/**
 @ ./js/index.js 19:26-57
 @ multi ./js/index.js ./webpack.config.js
```

I just added the `Spinner` component in my `index.js` file header and run webpack. 
```
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import Chart from './Chart';
import Spinner from 'react-native-spinkit';
...
```

**webpack.config.js**
```
module.exports = {
  entry: ['./js/index.js'],
  output: {
    path: __dirname + "/js/",
    filename: 'favorite.bundle.js'
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {test: /\.js$/, exclude: /node_modules/, loader: 'babel-loader'},
      { test: /\.css$/, loader: "style-loader!css-loader" }
    ]
  }
};

```


*Fix error during the build the projects.*

`<application>` in description makes harder to customize it for application. I.e. we are using [react-native-config](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config) to store all values in one `.env` file and we customize application name with ENV-variable called `DISPLAY_NAME`. For this we use next code in AndroidManifest.yml:

```
<application
      android:name=".MainApplication"
      android:label="@string/DISPLAY_NAME"
      ...
```

In this case there is a conflict with AndroidManifest.yml from react-native-spinkit package, because `android:label` is different in main manifest and local package manifest.

Would be better to remove this tag from AndroidManifest.yml in your package and add wiki instruction to add `android:supportsRtl="true"` in main AndroidManifest.yml.
I am trying to run my app with `react-native run-android` but getting the following error

```
error: Error: No resource found that matches the given name: attr 'android:keyboardNavigationCluster'
:react-native-spinkit:processReleaseResources FAILED
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':react-native-spinkit:processReleaseResources'.
> com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: Failed to execute aapt
```

I deleted node_modules, run `npm install` but still same. I tried clearing cache but error still exists

Any solution? I can't even run my project
