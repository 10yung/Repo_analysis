I have used select2 and need the scroll bar as below pic.

But found the scroll bar will auto-scrolling to bottom when I click it or open options. Debugging the source found the root cause is when container close/open/focus, the "search" will be focused.

My question is why the "search" should be focused automatic?

Select2 : 4.0.3
Jquery : 2.2.3
browser: Chrome Version 79.0.3945.130

Cheers.

There is a strange issue I'm facing that I can't find the way to solve and to identify from where the issue could come

The steps to reproduce:

1) I have a form with a select element
2) Turns this select into a select2
3) The forms includes the ability to duplicate the entire form
4) When the forms get cloned I have a function to reinitialize the select2 element to make them work again (thourh using the` .select2('destroy').select();`
5) The cloned select2 work correctly and as expected
6) But, the strange things happens that the previous select2 (the original from the first form) gets destroyed

I was checking it in several ways and I can't find the issue, some of my checks and security workflows I tried to follow are:

1) I ensure to append the cloned element first, and before query it again through the jQuey selector
2) I tried to separate the destroy function from the reinitialization as this:
```
$cloned.select2('destroy');
$cloned.select2();
```
Instead of process everything in the same line:
```
$cloned.select2('destroy').select2();
```
3) Both functions (destroy and reinitialization) destroys the original element, I tried to run only one of the functions and both continues destroying the original one

So, Is possible there is some internal link between those elements that causes the destruction of the original one?

Thanks in advance for any help on this
I'm using select2 with maximized height and paginated ajax data. When the first page is loaded, when the select2 is resized, the «load more results» appear. And if the the scrollbar is removed because all the first page results are showed, its impossible to fix the state. 
Hi,

My usecase is dynamically create a select element and then I need to remove it from the page after it has been changed(user selected something or cleared selection) or user just click on another element.

For such case select2:close event suits pretty well.
But I'm getting the following error with latest chrome and latest select2 version: 4.0.12:

> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'query' of null
>     at d.<anonymous> (select2.full.min.js:2)
>     at d.e.invoke (select2.full.min.js:2)
>     at d.e.trigger (select2.full.min.js:2)
>     at d.trigger (select2.full.min.js:2)
>     at d.open (select2.full.min.js:2)
>     at d.toggleDropdown (select2.full.min.js:2)
>     at o.<anonymous> (select2.full.min.js:2)
>     at o.e.invoke (select2.full.min.js:2)
>     at o.e.trigger (select2.full.min.js:2)
>     at o.e._handleClear (select2.full.min.js:2)

It appears only when I'm trying to clear selection by clicking on the clear all icon.
I've created codepen snippet for this issue: https://codepen.io/romanburunkov/pen/gObjJRP

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a select2 with the following options:
```
{
  minimumResultsForSearch: Infinity,
  placeholder: 'Select option...',
  allowClear: true
}
```

2. Select any option.
3. Click clear icon and an error will be showed in browser console. 

The workaround for this issue is to use 

`setTimeout(() => { destroySelect(); }, 0);`

But I think that it;s still the issue with a select2 component.

Hi, the Contribute link returned for me Page Not Found. This is a fix for it.

Thank you all for this awesome library!

PS:  Another thing, this link is returning not found too: `https://opencollective.com/select2/contributors.svg?width=890&button=false`. It appears at the side of the Contribute link. I'm not sure how to solve this, so I'm just saying.

there was a discussion in https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/5688 Options with empty value will not be shown.

i want to have an option to insert an empty/blank line as separator of my options. Like Labels but not a label. At the Moment we use this as a simple way of grouping opitons. with a normal select option list i can insert an empty <option/> this will be displayed as a empty line and so it is a visual separator. with the use of select2 this emtpy option is removed.

how can i get a separator without using labels?
Hi,

How can we fix it?

Thanks

The following changes were made

- Rather than triggering DOM updates for every mutation within the select, only do it once if at least one mutation is detected.

I've had an issue when using select2 with datatables editor. I have a dropdown that has 4000+ elements, loaded via datatables editor and ajax. Everytime I filter/sort/change page on the table a new request fires to get the data the correct page, but also (annoyingly and seemingly unnecessarily) the list of options for the dropdown gets returned again... This then causes the page to become unresponsive as select2 goes through and refreshes the DOM (I think, it's certainly doing something along those lines) 4000+ times for each option being removed, and 4000+ times for each option being added.

This issue didn't exist before 4.0.3, and the below changes fix it. All tests are still passing, but I could very easily have overlooked something important though.

Hello, 
this is not an ISSUE but maybe future feature.

html5 data* attr placeholder for element for multiple selector not rendering their own placeholder.

example:
`<select class="example_1" data-placeholder="example_1">
<select class="example_2" data-placeholder="example_2">
 `
active select2
`$(function() {
$('.example_1, example_2').select2();
});`

now both select box shows the first select box placeholder...
