It was working just fine yesterday and I saw no message that Spotify was updated.

EZBlocker Version: 1.7.3.0
Spotify Version: 1.1.18.611
The EZBlocker mute songs instead ads, this happen usually when i change from a song to another, or new artist, not when iâ€™m just listening a playlist or full album
Spotify is still broken after deleting

C:\Users<user>\AppData\Roaming\Spotify
C:\Users<user>\AppData\Local\Spotify

and re-downloading after
Hey, i've got the newest version of EZBlocker from [https://www.ericzhang.me](https://www.ericzhang.me). Sometimes it did not unmute spotify after Ad. It's really annoying!
Please fix, thank you so mutch!

Ciao, Ceytec!
After deleting EZBlocker from my PC (I also deleted lines from host file) Spotify won't play anything because all playlists are empty. I tried reinstalling Spotify several times, but that didn't helped. Any solutions?

Have you stopped devolving this thing? I wish you could make oen that blocks the ads
EZBlocker mutes Spotify when it's paused (Spotify's title changes to "Spotify Free") and then, because of the delay, it stays paused for a second or so after unpausing, sometimes even forever.

Possible solution: Don't mute if the title is "Spotify Free"
In Australia, Spotify free users can skip ads. It would be a really good feature if Spotify-Ad-Blocker could also attempt to skip the ads.
