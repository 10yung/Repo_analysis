Add install and build instructions to README for people not familiar
with gitbook-cli


.. I just noticed that a lot of pr's ans issues are open and that the last commit is very old?
Hi, I'm Yevgeny Pats Founder of [Fuzzit](https://fuzzit.dev) - Continuous fuzzing as a service platform.

We have a free plan for OSS and I would be happy to contribute a PR if that's interesting.
The PR will include the following
- [go-fuzz](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz) fuzzers (This is generic step not-connected to fuzzit)
- Continuous Fuzzing of master branch which will generate new corpus and look for new crashes
- Regression on every PR that will run the fuzzers through all the generated corpus and fixed crashes from previous step. This will prevent new or old bugs from crippling into master.

You can see our basic example [here](https://github.com/fuzzitdev/example-go) and you can see an example of "in the wild" integration [here](https://github.com/google/syzkaller).

Let me know if this is something worth working on.

Cheers,
Yevgeny

Clicking on a pattern which is unfinished (i.e status = ✘) provides no feedback on the website, nothing happens.

Clicking on the link multiple times appends the category to the URL multiple times. For example clicking on `Abstract Factory` three times yields the following url:

`http://tmrts.com/go-patterns/creational/creational/creational/abstract_factory.md`

Lastly, clicking on such an object twice makes all the other links (with status ✔) not work.
