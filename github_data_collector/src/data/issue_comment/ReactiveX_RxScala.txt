This project doesn't have support for RxJava2. Now that RxJava3 is near release, is there plan to support it?
Hi,
Is there any plan for that?
I saw David had created a fork and started porting to RxJava 2.0.
Do you need any help? Is there any list of tasks to do?
I would like to help a little bit as far as I can ;).
