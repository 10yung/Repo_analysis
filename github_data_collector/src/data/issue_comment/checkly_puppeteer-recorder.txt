*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Nice usefull extension, thank you for all the effort.

What is about drag&drop support?

I know this is not easy, but have you planed to implement it?

I stay tuned, happy to see this project grows from day to day üëç 
My page has a selector named `.scTrack:Aheader_home` which is changed to the below querySelector by the extension.

```js
await page.type('.css-htcxmu > .css-9tec82 > .css-daw4m5 > .css-1o4f6ww > .scTrack\3Aheader_home', 'undefined')
```

As you can see `:` is changed to `\3A`, which doesn't work while the query selector runs.

Reproducible steps:

1. Input data-ved or ved in settings of extension

2. Go to "google.com"
3. Press "Google Search" button
4. Received code
```
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch()
  const page = await browser.newPage()
  
  await page.goto('https://www.google.com/')
  
  await page.setViewport({ width: 983, height: 685 })
  
  await page.waitForSelector('div > .A8SBwf > .FPdoLc > center > .gNO89b')
  await page.click('div > .A8SBwf > .FPdoLc > center > .gNO89b')
  
  await browser.close()
})()
```
5. Expected
```
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch()
  const page = await browser.newPage()
  
  await page.goto('https://www.google.com/')
  
  await page.setViewport({ width: 983, height: 685 })
  
  await page.waitForSelector('[data-ved="0ahUKEwjG8ZGz-MvkAhXRqZ4KHb3SClEQ4dUDCAc"]')
  await page.click('[data-ved="0ahUKEwjG8ZGz-MvkAhXRqZ4KHb3SClEQ4dUDCAc"]')
  
  await browser.close()
})()
```
