<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>

*Sourced from [base64's changelog](https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md).*

> - 0.11.0
> - Minimum rust version 1.34.0
> - `no_std` is now supported via the two new features `alloc` and `std`.
> 
> # 0.10.1
> 
> - Minimum rust version 1.27.2
> - Fix bug in streaming encoding ([#90](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/pull/90)): if the underlying writer didn't write all the bytes given to it, the remaining bytes would not be retried later. See the docs on `EncoderWriter::write`.
> - Make it configurable whether or not to return an error when decoding detects excess trailing bits.
> 
> # 0.10.0
> 
> - Remove line wrapping. Line wrapping was never a great conceptual fit in this library, and other features (streaming encoding, etc) either couldn't support it or could support only special cases of it with a great increase in complexity. Line wrapping has been pulled out into a [line-wrap](https://crates.io/crates/line-wrap) crate, so it's still available if you need it.
>   - `Base64Display` creation no longer uses a `Result` because it can't fail, which means its helper methods for common
>   configs that `unwrap()` for you are no longer needed
> - Add a streaming encoder `Write` impl to transparently base64 as you write.
> - Remove the remaining `unsafe` code.
> - Remove whitespace stripping to simplify `no_std` support. No out of the box configs use it, and it's trivial to do yourself if needed: `filter(|b| !b" \n\t\r\x0b\x0c".contains(b)`.
> - Detect invalid trailing symbols when decoding and return an error rather than silently ignoring them.
> 
> # 0.9.3
> 
> - Update safemem
> 
> # 0.9.2
> 
> - Derive `Clone` for `DecodeError`.
> 
> # 0.9.1
> 
> - Add support for `crypt(3)`'s base64 variant.
> 
> # 0.9.0
> 
> - `decode_config_slice` function for no-allocation decoding, analogous to `encode_config_slice`
> - Decode performance optimization
> 
> # 0.8.0
> 
> - `encode_config_slice` function for no-allocation encoding
> 
> # 0.7.0
> 
> - `STANDARD_NO_PAD` config
> - `Base64Display` heap-free wrapper for use in format strings, etc
> 
> # 0.6.0
> 
> - Decode performance improvements
> - Use `unsafe` in fewer places

Hello,

I have been following this project for a long time. I have a question though: will there be an English translation?

If so, I'd like to help with translating documentation, etc. If it's also possible, I'd like to help as soon as possible.
