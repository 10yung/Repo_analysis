Now the colors of SIM cards are gray. Make it possible to color the SIM card color in the settings. If the cards are different colors it is easier and easier to navigate. in the message when an SMS arrives on different SIM card can also be used in color.

### DESCRIPTION
I have two SIM cards in my phone. when a message arrives, the program does not correctly show where the message came from. it confuses SIM card 1 and SIM card 2.

in the example in the picture, the incoming message should come to sim1. your program is not showing correctly. another program is true.

QKSMS could have an option to show a notification at the moment the scheduled message has been sent.

That way it would remind you that a scheduled message has been sent and you don't have to think about it or think about why is the recipient texting you in a context, when you don't immediatelly remember you sent something.
Hello,

I think there might be two separate, very linked bugs here. QKSMS discards a message being typed when sharing from an application to QKSMS.

## Steps to reproduce:
0. Open an application that allows sharing something. e.g. NewPipe or Firefox Mobile
1. In QKSMS, open a conversation C.
2. Start typing a message ("hello")
3. Switch to Firefox. Share the current page to QKSMS. Pick conversation C
4. Notice that "hello" disappeared and was replaced by the shared link
5. Type something in the message (removing the link and typing "hello", or just appending "hello")
6. Switch to Firefox, and switch back to QKSMS
7. Notice that the message has been replaced by the previously shared link once more, though you didn't share it twice.
  
### EXPECTED

1. Messages should not be replaced by sharing (step 4). The shared content might be appended to the draft message for instance, or a dialog box could be displayed to ask the user what to do (append, prepend, replace, cancel sharing?)
2. Sharing should not happen a second time when switching apps  (step 7).

I'm using QKSMS from F-Droid on LineageOS 15.

ps: happy new year!
Other apps can send texts (Silence, default texting app), but QKSMS fails every time. I can send messages to group chats (MMS) with this person in them, and they receive it.

Add a flip animation like gmail for selection state. (issue #1232)
### DESCRIPTION
When you have a certain custom theme color selected, you can't just undo that by clicking "reset", or "default".

No option/button to select/go back to default theme, after the custom color is selected.
They should just be stored in the messages table, with the date set to the future date

This will fix the issue we're having with attachments, as well as simplify things overall
### DESCRIPTION
Unlike the instant group message, the delayed message sent to multiple contacts does not arrive to everyone. To specify, it just sends the delayed message to 1 of the chosen contacts.

### STEPS
1. Open app and press + for new messages
2. Chose >2 contacts into the "to:" section you want to send a delayed message and uncheck "group conversation".
3. Press + from the left lower corner and delay the message anytime >2min in the future.
4. Check delayed message folder and you will see the message with every contacts you chose. 


### EXPECTED
Every chosen contact should receive the delayed message.

### OBSERVATIONS
Just one out of every other chosen contacts gets a delayed message.
