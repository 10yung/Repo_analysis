# Report

## What did you do?

I have created two private pod, written in Swift and another one written in Objective-C

## What did you expect to happen?

I don't want using `@import` to import Swift Class in Objective-c file

## What happened instead?

I want to import Swift class in Objective-C file, I know that I can use `@import xxx` and  I don't wanna use `@import`, in my Objective-C pod I don't have `xx-Swift.h`, what should I do?

I have bad English to express my question..

I saw a lot of output related to deprecations in Ruby 2..7.

Ruby 2.7 has introduced a few deprecations which result in quite a lot of warnings being logged when running CocoaPods. These fall into two broad categories:

- Usage of `URI.escape`, which is deprecated and should be replaced with `CGI.escape`
- Implicit conversion of a hash to keyword arguments, which should be replaced with an explicit conversion using the double splat operator (`**`)

There's really quite a lot of these warnings, so it would be nice if we could fix this for Ruby 2.7 users.

# Report
I'm running into an issue in trying to take over the name of an existing pod, `Coordinator`. I reached out to the original owner to delete the pod so I could use it instead, but now neither of us are able to modify ownership.

## What did you do?

1) The original owner [deleted all versions of the existing pod](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/commit/556d49f6abc8cc151d087357e4788a1c6a860930).
2) I ran `pod trunk push Coordinator.podspec` to push the new podspec, but got the following error:
    > [!] You {my email} are not allowed to push new versions for this pod. The owners of this pod are {original owner email}.
3) In response, the original owner ran `pod trunk add-owner Coordinator {my email}`, but received the following error:
    > [!] No pod found with the specified name.
4) As a last resort, I tried to [claim the pod](https://trunk.cocoapods.org/claims) but then got this error:  
    > Unknown Pod Coordinator

Now neither of us can modify ownership for `Coordinator`.

## What did you expect to happen?

1) I expected that if all versions of `Coordinator` were deleted from the public specs repo, I would be able to create a new pod with the same name.
2) I expected that an additional owner could be added to a pod, as long as CocoaPods has the original owner information stored.

## What happened instead?

The original owner now can't add me as an owner, since the pod can't be found, and I can't create a new pod because ownership is still attributed to the original owner.

Yes, 1.8.4.

* [X] I've read and understood the [*CONTRIBUTING* guidelines and have done my best effort to follow](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Report

## What did you do?

Created 2 identical pods: one for main app, other for app extension (notification service) and added them to respective targets. The only difference is that the main app pod contains a macro definition. 

## What did you expect to happen?

Project builds without errors.

## What happened instead?

Extension pod doesn't build because of error with `#import` of a header from parent directory.

This PR addresses an issue happening when a pod is set to preserve local paths, e.g. a local pod.

The issue is that some file references weren't actually being preserved. Interface Builder files are a good example, these were getting put into a `Resources` group and this was very inconvenient as it placed them away from the corresponding source file. 

This PR fixes this issue by preserving ALL paths when a pod is set to preserve local paths.

# Report

## What did you do?

I created an app spec in a library that also vends a macOS app. The app spec specifies its platform as macOS. It’s [SBTUITestTunnelHost](https://github.com/Subito-it/SBTUITestTunnelHost), a tool to communicate between iOS UI tests and macOS. Here’s what I added to their Podspec to create an app spec:

<details>
<summary>SBTUITestTunnelHost.podspec</summary>

```ruby
Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  s.name             = 'SBTUITestTunnelHost'
  s.version          = '0.2.7'
  s.summary          = 'Execute commands on your testing mac host while using SBTUITestTunnel'
  
  s.description      = <<-DESC
Extend SBTUITestTunnel adding a tunnel between your test target and host mac running tests. This allows to launch terminal commands on your testing mac during test execution
  DESC
  
  s.homepage         = 'https://github.com/Subito-it/SBTUITestTunnelHost'
  s.license          = 'Apache License, Version 2.0'
  s.author           = { "Tomas Camin" => "tomas.camin@scmitaly.it" }
  s.source           = { :git => "https://github.com/Subito-it/SBTUITestTunnelHost.git", :tag => s.version.to_s }
  
  s.platform     = :ios, '9.0'
  s.requires_arc = true
  
  s.frameworks = 'XCTest'
  s.source_files = 'SBTUITestTunnelHost/*.{h,m}'
  s.pod_target_xcconfig = { :prebuild_configuration => 'debug' }
  
  s.app_spec 'MacHost' do |mac_host|
    mac_host.platform  = :osx, "10.13"
    mac_host.source_files = "Mac Host/SBTUITunnelHostServer/**/*.swift"

    mac_host.info_plist = {
      'LSApplicationCategoryType' => 'public.app-category.developer-tools',
      'LSUIElement' => true,
      'NSAppTransportSecurity' => {
        'NSAllowsArbitraryLoads' => true
      },
      'NSAppleEventsUsageDescription' => 'Grant permission to allow host to drag mouse around',
      'NSHumanReadableCopyright' => 'Copyright © 2016 Subito.it. All rights reserved.',
      'NSMainNibFile' => 'MainMenu',
      'NSPrincipalClass' => 'NSApplication'
    }
  end
end
```

</details>

On an iOS project, I pointed my Podfile to the local version of this and attempted to add it as an app spec for my UI tests:

```ruby
target 'InstantReplay-iOS' do
  platform :ios, "10.0"
  use_frameworks!

  target 'InstantReplay-iOSUITests' do
    pod 'SBTUITestTunnelHost', :path => '/Users/jeff/Projects/Open-Source/SBTUITestTunnelHost', :appspecs => ['MacHost']
  end

end
```

## What did you expect to happen?

My goal here is to create a target in my iOS application workspace for the Mac app that SBTUITestTunnelHost provides, so that I can run it before running my UI tests without leaving Xcode.

## What happened instead?

Here is the output of `pod install`:

```shell
InstantReplay jeff$ bundle exec pod install

# Report

## What did you do?
 Run `pod install`, and the host target definition doesn't specify `use_frameworks!`

## What did you expect to happen?
To generate a private static library which has public header files by using the cocoapods, we create the .podSpec file in which we also have specify properties of source_files and public_header_files;
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7614682/71969536-d077da00-3241-11ea-87a0-d1e2abfa1d5e.png)

## What happened instead?

After I runned the 'pod install', these header files in the target are added in the "Build Phase->Header->Project", not in the "Build Phase->Header->Public". And the product of this target has no public header files.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7614682/71969410-91498900-3241-11ea-8e9b-cd4c642c6a9c.png)

 I have analyzed the code in "https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/blob/1-9-stable/lib/cocoapods/installer/xcode/pods_project_generator/pod_target_installer.rb" and find out that when we build a static library, the environment var, 'acl', always set as "Project", just like the picture below:

I'm confused with this code and hope you can help me.

Suppose there is a private specs repo contains `Foo`, `AFNetworking`. 
**I want to install `Foo` from this private repo and install `AFNetworking` from the Master repo.**

```ruby
target 'PodfileTest' do
    pod 'AFNetworking'
    pod 'Foo', :source => 'http://private/repo.git'
end
```

After `pod update`, **both `AFNetworking` and `Foo` are installed from the private repo**.

Adding a global source won't help:

```ruby
source 'https://cdn.cocoapods.org/'

target 'PodfileTest' do
    pod 'AFNetworking'
    pod 'Foo', :source => 'http://private/repo.git'
end
```

I must specify `source` for `AFNetworking`:

```ruby
target 'PodfileTest' do
    pod 'AFNetworking', :source => 'https://cdn.cocoapods.org/'
    pod 'Foo', :source => 'http://private/repo.git'
end
```

I don't know if the design is so.
