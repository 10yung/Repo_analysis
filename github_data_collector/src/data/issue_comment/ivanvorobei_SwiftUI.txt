i created a pull request to fix this problem
I've looked into GitHub user search project and found out that views contain unnecessary property wrappers (@State). According to WWDC sessions those shouldn't appear in such context. I removed them and search continued working correctly. I assume it'd be helpful removing them from repo to prevent newbies in Combine study on project with mistakes. Also I found out that project contains parts that are not used at all. I guess I can provide PR if needed) 

Thank you for this amazing repo btw! I also speak Russian if that helps.
Where's the source code for the side menu?
