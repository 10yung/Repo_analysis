so i got homebrew and wanted to download FBI on it. But any time in the process it will turn from a command prompt to a red screen. i tried every trick but it didnt work. is there one way that i could fix it. i would tap the fbi installer in homebrew, then a command prompt. THEN A RED SCREEN. Please send me something.
Request in title.
Often times it takes a while to copy larger files and folders with many files to a new location and then delete them from the original location.
A transfer/move option for files and folders would be nice for this.
When the server sends the HTTP header `Accept-Ranges`, and the download is subsequently interrupted by a network error, it's possible to resume the download by sending a `Ranges` header in the request. This is documented [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests) on MDN.

Implementing this functionality in FBI would greatly help when installing over flaky networks.
