### Description
Arbitrator reported that the `BTC seller gets trade amount payout` is giving the seller more than the option `BTC seller gets all`.

Have not tried to reproduce but sounds like a simple issue with calculation and should be reproducible.
### Description
Many mediation cases lately are a result of seller not being able to confirm the payment has been received. On most cases the buyer confirms they have pressed ‘payment made’ but for some reason is not showing on the other end.

### How to fix
It's hard to reproduce and might be a result of a missed mailbox message. A simple option ask for a resend from the seller side might be enough. Thinking a bit further it would be nice to be able to confirm transmission failures of these messages. Not sure how that could be done though.

I can't think of any other reason that the seller wouldn't see the confirm payment button than a failed message.
### Background
Starting from Bitcoin 0.19.x, a non-default configuration is required for usage with Bisq nodes: `peerbloomfilters=1`

### Summary
This PR removes 2 btcnodes. These nodes have had availability issues in the past, and are operated by people who are not members of the Bisq #btcnodes team on Keybase, so we cannot coordinate with the node operators.

Since these nodes could be upgraded to 0.19.x at any time, and we cannot ensure the `peerbloomfilters=1` setting is enabled, I feel we should remove the nodes from Bisq before they can cause a disruption to our users.

### Description
