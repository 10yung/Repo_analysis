When i'm trying to apply mesh transformation on image, some part get modified but image's frame is also changed with it.
Can you suggest me way that doesn't change frame of image while applying mesh transform.

Hi, I want to apply mesh to big image (ex: 2000x2000), but I got crash: 
`Failed to bind EAGLDrawable: <CAEAGLLayer: 0x281e7c080> to GL_RENDERBUFFER 1`
`Failed to make complete framebuffer object 8cd6`
What can I do?, tnx
I have a problem with BCMeshTransformView, especially with GLKView inside, which renders this view. In my case MeshTransform vertices can be outside view bounds, but GLKView clips view to it's bounds. I've tried setting clipsToBounds to false in GLKView, BCMeshTransformView and contentView, but it's still clipping the content. Is there any way to fix this? The only thing I can imagine right now is to set frame to the parent frame, but it'll break tons of stuff in my code, because I'm extending BCMeshTransformView, make calculations based on it's frame, using gestures etc.
I noticed that contentView doesn't get deallocated, so I tried to invalidate displayLink on dealloc and it helped. 
The title says it all, I need a way to apply transformation on a UImage, or better render the whole view as one.

Is there an easy way? Cause, `transformView.layer.render(in: rect)` won't work.
GitHub changed the way Markdown headings are parsed, so this change fixes it.

To be able to include use the library without cocoapods.

thanks for developing this great framework. 

I want to add more depth to curtain folds and change position of top and bottom of curtain to keep on with pan more.

I want to mimic like this video:

how can I achieve?

thanks

... for BCMeshShader::loadProgram in order to be able find resource when embeded in framework
