**Describe the bug**
Pixel is 1080X1440 image. When cutting, zoom the picture, drag the clipping box and move the picture. Finally, determine that the clipped image is not the desired position, but after rotating 90 degrees, repeat the above operation to achieve its purpose.

The final cut was not the cat, but the white cylinder next to it.

Hi,

Great library btw! 

I added this to my css for facial guidelines, it might be useful to add that as an option for users

```css
.cropper-dashed.dashed-v, 
.cropper-dashed.dashed-h {
      border: 3px dashed white;
      height: 77%;
      left: 10%;
      top: 10%;
      width: 80%;
      border-radius: 50% 50% 50% 50% / 40% 40% 60% 60%;
}
```
