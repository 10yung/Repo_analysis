This adds `Emoji::Character#skin_tones?` which returns true if the emoji supports Fitzpatrick skin tone modifiers (1F3FB-1F3FF).
Hi we recently upgraded to Rails 5.1.1 and sprockets-rails 3.2.0 and saw an issue with the *emojify* helper you guys suggest.  sprockets-rails 3.2.0 requires you to to explicitly tell the `image_path` helper if you'd like it to skip the asset pipeline and use the `public/` folder.

Not sure what the best way to update the instructions would be but happy to open a PR.
