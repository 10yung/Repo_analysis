I am trying to install chromefy since 1 month but I always have a black screen with keyboard lights flashing when I boot on my USB stick.

I am using:
Pc: Dell Latitude 2120
USB stick: 32Go Kingston DT 50
OS: Ubuntu

recovery image: Eve 78
TMP1.2: Caroline 78
Chromium OS distribution: ArnoldTheBats 78 special
Installation script: croissant.sh
Application: Etcher
So I just installed Chrome OS on my computer (MacbookPro9,2) using Method 1, and the installation doesn’t seem to be detected (I get the blinking folder with the question mark). I tried using the fix-grub script, to no avail. Please help.
Edit: I think that maybe it’s not that it isn’t detected, but that it isn’t bootable.
You cant add certificates chrome://certificate-manager/, meaning that you cant use openvpn. I think this issue is swtpm related since certs are stored with TPM

chromefy doesn't make any image files like .img or .iso just some wierd volumes
Thinkpad S1 Yoga
i5 4210U, 8GB RAM, Kingston UV400 120GB SSD
UEFI only mode, no CSM/Legacy boot

I installed ArnoldtheBat ChromiumOS76 Special build, used Nocturne (ChromeOS 77) image and swtpm.

After installing ChromiumOS using /usr/sbin/chromeos-install -dst /dev/sda I have to use the fix_grub.sh in order to boot into ChromiumOS

After Chromefying, I can only boot to black screen, fix_grub script does not fix this issue (the UEFI values stay the same). If I plug the install USB in nothing happens (before chromefying and running the fix script it would boot into the USB when plugged in after it started booting)

Any ideas?
I installed Chrome OS (based on eve) on an old Lenovo Ideapad. Everthing worked fine, but the Google Play Setup always fails as you see in the screenshot. Can someone help?
