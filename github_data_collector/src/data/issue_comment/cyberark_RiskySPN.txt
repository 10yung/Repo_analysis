The script (on Windows 10) generated an UTF16 file, I had to convert it in UTF8 to use with hashcat and John.
Hi!

Just flipped through the code, very cool : )  Have you considered publishing this to the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/)?  Makes it a bit more discoverable, improves re-usability (other folks can use it as a dependency without much effort), simple to install, etc.

[It's pretty straightforward](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/upload), and if you don't want to manually do it, you could have AppVeyor do it for you each time you commit (perhaps with a gate on commit message).  If you're up for it and would like any help, hit me up!

Cheers!
