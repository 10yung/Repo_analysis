I am using macOS Mojave with MATLAB_R2018b. Is there a way I can use a different gcc version than the Xcode one? 
I have trained an myself cascade model using author's pca.mat. But i think it is unreasonable, how can i generate myself pca.mat.
Hello, sorry if it's lame issue, but when I try to compile or make, I got an error using mex. 
Error in cascade_compile (line 55)
eval(mexcmd)
Error in compile (line 64)
   cascade_compile(opt,verb);

I really don't know what to do to get the demo working i would love id you can help me.
After getting compile the files, the demo run provides this output shown below:
>> demo

Hi everyone,

I successfully trained a model on my own dataset, but when try to uses cascade detection I got an error about pca score files. How can i generate socres for my dataset to use in cascade detection?


The following link is not available anymore, did you move the project somewhere else?
http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/~rbg/latent/


I encountered the error .Can you please help me out .The line was in
"Error in featpyramid (line 30)
    scaled = resize(im, 1/sc^(i-1));
"
I encountered an error when learning from my own data. I think it relates to the parallel computing part.

Error using parallel_function (line 604)
All workers aborted during execution of the parfor loop.

Error in train>poslatent (line 503)
  parfor k = 1:thisbatchsize

Error in train (line 113)
          = poslatent(t, iter, model, pos, fg_overlap, num_fp);

Error in pascal_train (line 76)
    models{i} = train(models{i}, spos{i}, neg_small, false, false, 4, 3, ...

Error in pascal (line 49)
model = pascal_train(cls, n, note);

The client lost connection to worker 1. This might be due to network problems, or the interactive communicating job might have errored.

I am using ubuntu14.04 with matlab2015b.

I did check the log file but didn't figure it out what's the cause. Any ideas? Thanks.

Im getting the error "matlab/voc-dpm/gdetect/fconv_sse_meta.cc:22:10: fatal error:
'boost/preprocessor/repeat.hpp' file not found
# include <external/boost/preprocessor/repeat.hpp>"

I see the file is there so I am curious if there is something in the setup on the Mac that I am missing.
