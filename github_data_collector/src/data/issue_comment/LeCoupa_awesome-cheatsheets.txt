I have created a file in which I have mentioned some quick methods and features that are available in Python programming language
l think may be have a  canvas cheatsheet will be good, or just put it under javascript or html.

I can pull request when I'm home.
I've used [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) to lint the bash files in this repository, except for the `nanobox_cli.sh` file.


I guess it is good to add assembly cheatsheets maybe?
1. to publish class helpers i create directory called  cheat class

2. added PDO db cheat class
