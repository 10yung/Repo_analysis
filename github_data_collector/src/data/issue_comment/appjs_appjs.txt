This patch modifies the example application so that if you pass it an argument with a path to a .appjs file then it should run the application from inside the package. The majority of the logic is provided by appjs-package module.

npm install appjs-package in the root directory to get the latest implementation.

I have tested extensively on windows and have example apps you can test it with here:  http://appjs.delightfulsoftware.com/example-apps/
