How can you make a mistake of making "Couldn't open file on client side, trying server side %s" as a Log TAG? There's a bunch of high level APIs used when the project is set to not be able to use them.  Steps 1 and 2 doesn't work because LibsChecker and InitActivity are unresolved. How can I even trust this project to do what it says it can do when the there are code that seems to not even checked thoroughly? Even the "Getting Started" tutorial is incomplete. Why did you think "use Vitamio as Android library project" was a good decision. Why didn't you just show the whole process of how to "use Vitamio as Android library project"?

I spent about 6 hours just to make my app build.


裤子都脱了，你居然要收费？！
Google Play now asking for 64 bit CPU support and i realized that Vitamio doesn`t have x86_64 support. Is there a version supporting it?
For some reason, I should rotate the video frame by 180°, and cut the frame leaving only the left half remained on screen.
Can vitamio do it? If true, how?
