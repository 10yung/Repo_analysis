Hi,

I am able to successfully connect to both my Postgres and RabbitMQ servers on my production environment but for some reason `pg-amqp-brdige` doesn't receive any notifications from Postgres.  

On my staging and dev environments, it works fine and I can see from the `pg-amqp-bridge` logs that it's receiving and forwarding messages correctly. All instances are running on docker tag 0.0.6.

I created a simple Node.js script that listens to a specific channel on the production Postgres server and it is able to output all notifications sent to it, so I definitely know Postgres working. If I manually create and publish a message on RabbitMQ, my services that listen to RabbitMQ fetch those messages and react to them, so I know RabbitMQ also works. 

It just seems like `pg-amqp-bridge` is not getting or listening to Postgres in production. I don't see any logs that indicate it is receiving anything from Posgres, like I do on my staging and dev environments. 

I've set `RUST_LOG=debug` but can't see any errors being thrown. 

My `INFO` log output looks like this:

```
Attempting to connect to AMQP server..
INFO:amqp::session: Session initialized
Connection to AMQP server successful
Attempting to connect to PostgreSQL..
Connection to PostgreSQL successful
Listening on n13s...
Listening on user_events...
```

Can someone point me in the right direction? I've been trying to troubleshoot for the past day and am getting nowhere.
