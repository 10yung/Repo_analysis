'adjustsLetterSpacingToFitWidth' is deprecated: first deprecated in iOS 7.0

in BlockAlertView.m

hi, i'm writing an ipad app that work only in landscape mode.. The BlockActionSheet work correctly only in portait mode.. how can solve this?

Fixes #68: Added code to be able to handle multiple textfields in an alertview
simply by passing in placeholders for the desired textfields.
Placeholders should be blank (@"") if no placeholder is required.

An outlet has also been provided to be able to access the value in the
textfields from the block for the Done button.

There were a number of left over methods after these changes which I
could not see a use for, so I have removed them to avoid clutter /
unneccesary complexity

The current master branch only allows for 1 textField to be held within an AlertView

Hello,

I've been trying to resolve this issue with the BlockAlertView component, which doesn't display any text or render a background when invoked. All that is seen are two sets of three dots in the middle of the screen. 

My investigations have revealed that in the "show" method, the background image is being set by using the format "alert-<color>-button.png" for the image file name, but the resultant image object has a nil value. I can confirm that the image resides in the file system and in the Resources sub folder. The Pods-resources.sh file also has this file with the correct path in the "install_resource" method call.

Any pointers in the right direction will surely be helpful.

Thanks
Ashley

Im really struggling with something that should be easy. How to change the color of the cell/tableView??

Tried the following with no luck

alert.tableView.backgroundView = nil;
alert.tableView.backgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];

cell.backgroundView.backgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];
cell.backgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];
cell.textLabel.backgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];

### The problem

When running my unit tests, the `+ (void)initialize` method gets called and signals a **HALT**. The offending selector is `[UIFont boldSystemFontOfSize:]`, which tells us that it can't deduce the device type when running from Terminal:

```
Unknown Device Type. Using UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad based on screen size
```
### The offending code

``` objc
+ (void)initialize
{
    if (self == [BlockAlertView class])
    {
        background = [UIImage imageNamed:kAlertViewBackground];
        background = [[background stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:0 topCapHeight:kAlertViewBackgroundCapHeight] retain];

        backgroundlandscape = [UIImage imageNamed:kAlertViewBackgroundLandscape];
        backgroundlandscape = [[backgroundlandscape stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:0 topCapHeight:kAlertViewBackgroundCapHeight] retain];

        titleFont = [[UIFont boldSystemFontOfSize:20] retain];
        messageFont = [[UIFont systemFontOfSize:18] retain];
        buttonFont = [[UIFont boldSystemFontOfSize:18] retain];
    }
}
```
### The solution

``` objc
+ (void)initialize
{
    if (self == [BlockAlertView class])
    {
        background = [UIImage imageNamed:kAlertViewBackground];
        background = [[background stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:0 topCapHeight:kAlertViewBackgroundCapHeight] retain];

        backgroundlandscape = [UIImage imageNamed:kAlertViewBackgroundLandscape];
        backgroundlandscape = [[backgroundlandscape stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:0 topCapHeight:kAlertViewBackgroundCapHeight] retain];        
    }
}
```

How would I go about adding fixed width buttons for the BlockAlertView? I want them to extend nearly the width of the alert view, but currently their width is dependent on the length of the button's text. 

I tried simply adding a fixed width of 250 in the button's frame, but if the button's text label is relatively short, then the second button will appear off-frame. I can't figure out how to get that working correctly.

(BTW, I tried just adding spaces around the label text - this works fine in iOS6, but the text appears off-center in iOS7.)

Thanks!
