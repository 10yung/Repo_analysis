Hi,

I have put the schema into a postgres database and updated the config to reflect it is a postgres DB. It fails to connect. Is there any reason why making this a postgres database should cause it to break?

'```
DB_TYPE' => 'pgsql',
'DB_HOST' => 'manny.db.elephantsql.com',
'DB_NAME' => 'sklgimir',
'DB_USER' => 'sklgimir',
'DB_PASS' => 'PASSWORD',
'DB_PORT' => '5432',
'DB_CHARSET' => 'utf8',
```
I gived a chance to your framework and used it as a basic base to make something what i always wanted. I was trying best to customize it to my own, step by step by many days. 

..what can i say..?

I really, really learnt a lot...  I'm so grateful! And i just want to big thank you! ❤ 

Your project is amazing! 
I'm getting an error code: 0 when attempting to view any pages besides index, I have correctly configured the config with the database login details, I have made sure the mysql user correct access to the database.
Allows to change the default name (PHPSESSID) of the cookie.

This allows personalization of the cookie, improves security, since it makes it difficult for the attacker to infer what language we use on the server
Hey,

can you help me! I want to try an installation on my webspace!
I have one of the professional plans from 1blu.

I only see a white page.

thanks for your help
I add login page for separate admin login page from user login page. I edit Auth class line 60:

`header('location: ' . Config::get('URL') . 'login');`
to
`header('location: ' . Config::get('URL') . 'admin/login/');`

But in output i see this error:
```
 The page isn’t redirecting properly

 Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request for this address in a way that will never complete.

  This problem can sometimes be caused by disabling or refusing to accept cookies.
```

How do fix this problem?!
Hey,

i love ur mini framework. I used it to learn, how a framework works.
But i don't understand why the Autologin script works fine.

If i don't have a Session (if o don't login) - but have a cookie, i redirect to "login/loginwithcookie".
But before the action "loginWithCookie" should work, the redirect should trigger again and should get unlimited redirects, but i didn't..

I don't find any solution why it works fine.. but it does..

Maybe i'am just an idiot ;)

Thanks
Would you consider adding a list of suggested alternatives to the readme, in light of Huge's soft EOL?

Obviously I'm going to recommend my own project, [UserFrosting](https://www.userfrosting.com), but there are other good projects out there as well:

- Laravel Voyager
- Cartalyst Sentinel
- jwt-auth for Laravel

All of these projects are built with, or integrate with, the major modern PHP frameworks.  I'd be happy to submit a pull request if this is something you'd be interested in.
Hi, I would like to know how pagination can be implemented to this framework. Any suggestions/ideas will be very helpful. 

A simple pagination class will be a very appreciated feature.

Thank you

  
I tried to use this framework and cloned into my XAMPP folder. Then I created the database and the tables. When I tried to start I got the following error. It is the first time that I use a framework like this... Maybe this question is totally stupid but I can't figure out where this autoload.php file is.


Warning: require(../vendor/autoload.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/huge-master/public/index.php on line 14
