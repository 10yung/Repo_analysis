Hi, How how to set infinite sliding? I mean when the the indicator reached to the last page then the first page should be appear after that. Is it possible?
Might be a duplicate of / related to #22.

When you use anything else then wrap_content for the layout_height, then the dot and the strokes are in different positions vertically. E.g. when you, like me, try to use it in a vertical ConstraintLayout chain with height = 0dp, then the strokes are at the top, while the dots are in the center.

From the code it seems, this happens because the strokes are in a LinearLayout without vertical alignment, while the dot is in a RelativeLayout and vertically centered.

My current workaround is to wrap it in a LinearLayout. You could also use a GuideLine as in the sample app, but this doesn't work for me for my situation.

Ultimately the view should be able to be placed in any layout, this needs a bit of a refactoring.

For some reason, if I remove the first item from my ViewPager2, the dots count is updated, but the indicator' selected item is not updated (no dots are selected, I'm using `DotsIndicator` with different selected color). I'm calling `adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()` after removing the item. I'm expecting the first item to be selected.

What could be the issue? I'm using version 4.1.2

I also modified the sample to reproduce this bug, take a look at this branch (first DotsIndicator) - https://github.com/vkotovv/dotsindicator/tree/viewpager2-mutablelist-bug
viewPager2.setCurrentItem(2, false)
dotIndicator.setViewPager2(viewPager2)

the viewPager2 currentItem is 2
but the dotIndicator point always on first

my current version is 4.1.2
1)How can i make them take square form?
2)How to centerize them in view? without padding
Hi, I use navigation graph in my app and when I leave fragment which contains viewpager and come back (click on "skip" button in attached gif), viewpager's position is retained, but dots indicator is reset. I know that view is recreated when leaving and coming back, but I noticed ViewPager2.OnPageChangeCallback's onPageSelected is called  with last position, but dots indicator somehow doesn't react. But when I scroll , indicator jumps to correct position. Please have a look at attached video.  Thanks

this is how it's initialised in onActivityCreated() method:

```
        val pagerAdapter = MyViewPagerAdapter(activity!!)
        viewPager.adapter = pagerAdapter
        pagerIndicator.setViewPager2(viewPager)
```

im sorry for my broken english :D
I am using the `WormDotsIndicator` and am noticing that clicking on a dot takes the user to the previous page for which it is intended. For example, if I have four pages in a `ViewPager`, here is what each tap does:

- **1st dot:** Goes to page 1
- **2nd dot:** Goes to page 1
- **3rd dot:** Goes to page 2
- **4th dot:** Goes to page 3

There is no way to go to the last page unless I swipe on the `ViewPager`.

For proof:

Layout setup:

```xml
<com.tbuonomo.viewpagerdotsindicator.WormDotsIndicator
    android:id="@+id/healthbeat_view_pager_dots_indicator"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_marginBottom="16dp"
    app:dotsColor="@color/grey4"
    app:dotsCornerRadius="8dp"
    app:dotsSize="8dp"
    app:dotsSpacing="4dp"
    app:dotsStrokeColor="@color/grey6"
    app:dotsStrokeWidth="4dp"
    app:dotsWidthFactor="2.5"
    app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"
    app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
    app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
    app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@+id/healthbeat_view_pager" />
```

Implementation:

```kotlin
class HealthBeatCardViewMvcImpl() {

    @VisibleForTesting
    val dotsIndicator: WormDotsIndicator

    @VisibleForTesting
    val viewPager: ViewPager

    override fun setPagerAdapter(adapter: HealthBeatCardAdapter) {
        dotsIndicator = findViewById(R.id.healthbeat_view_pager_dots_indicator)
        viewPager = findViewById(R.id.healthbeat_view_pager)

        viewPager.adapter = adapter
        dotsIndicator.setViewPager(viewPager)
    }
}
```
