See the photo below. When I scroll the web view down, the iOS status bar overlaps with the WebView's top bar. It looks bad!

Hi,

I am loading a website url in DZNWebView, the project is in swift.

I am facing a weird issue where, the url load nicely initially and the delegate methods are also called appropriately like didFinishNavigation and other delegate methods, but for a particular url, none of the delegate methods fire, even the url on the navigation doesn't update, although the page is loaded on the web view. I am clueless, can anyone help?

Thanks,
Vishal

Error:
*** Skipped building DZNWebViewController due to the error:
Dependency "DZNWebViewController" has no shared framework schemes
 - Cleanup Pod files by adding the Pods directory to .gitignore (a 'pod install' will be needed after cloning, but this reduces clutter in the repo generated by the Sample app)
- Retain reference to navigation bar to fix temperamental KVO crash on dealloc.
- Clear progress view in viewDidDisappear:, dealloc as well as viewWillDisappear: - just in case there is a situation in which we receive delegate progress callbacks.
- Add parens to statement causing warning in Xcode 8.3
Hello there, I am getting several warnings since i updated my Xcode Version:

```
.../Pods/DZNWebViewController/Source/Classes/DZNWebViewController.m:69:1: Method possibly missing a [super awakeFromNib] call

.../Pods/DZNWebViewController/Source/Classes/DZNWebViewController.m:224:13: Logical not is only applied to the left hand side of this comparison

Hi, i used pods to import framework but now I can't build my project.

First I got 2 errors:
```
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "_OBJC_CLASS_$_DZNWebViewController", referenced from:
      objc-class-ref in AppDelegate.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

Then I've added this to Other Linker Flags(I see this flag in example project): `-l"Pods-DZNWebViewController"`
And now I get this error:
```
ld: library not found for -lPods-DZNWebViewController
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

I can't build after first try to allocate DZNWebViewController in my AppDelegate

`DZNWebViewController *controller = [[DZNWebViewController alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://dribbble.com/"]];`

What's wrong with my project?
I can't find how to put a button to dismiss the web view after it's loaded. Any ideas?
I'm getting an EXC_BAD_ACCESS at the DZNWebViewController.m viewDidLoad.

I copied your sample code into my MainView ViewDidLoad which has a Nav Controller as the root to a ViewController. Also, the DZNWebNavigationPromptAll doesn't exist, I had to comment it out. Any suggestions?

    NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.google.com/"];
    
    DZNWebViewController *WVC = [[DZNWebViewController alloc] initWithURL:URL];
    UINavigationController *NC = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:WVC];
    
    WVC.supportedWebNavigationTools = DZNWebNavigationToolAll;
    WVC.supportedWebActions = DZNWebActionAll;
    //WVC.webNavigationPrompt = DZNWebNavigationPromptAll;
    WVC.showLoadingProgress = YES;
    WVC.allowHistory = YES;
    WVC.hideBarsWithGestures = YES;
