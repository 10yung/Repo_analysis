**Expected behavior**
The suggestion extends the already existed component `InputSwitch` by the way that it would allow three states: Enable / In-between / Disable (On / In-between / Off). The implementation would still be the input tag with the `checkbox` type, with using of its `Indeterminate` property (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox) as the `In-between` state.

The visual appearance can be something like the following:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5693835/72629222-2f2f0900-3950-11ea-8615-93381b121412.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5693835/72629385-8208c080-3950-11ea-890c-c9a3e22a46d7.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5693835/72629596-ed529280-3950-11ea-8c9b-d48140bad92e.png)

The primary use case is the situation where a user has a group of checkboxes/switches, which should be all checked/switched on/off by one click/operation, but which should also allow individual selection/deselection, that leads to the `intermediate` state.

The `intermediate` state represents the state in the middle. It should also be possible to set it only programmatically and not allow a user to do it manually, because a user creates it by himself by selecting/deselecting of individual checkboxes/switches. But then a user can choose to switch the tri-state switch to on/off state, which selects/deselects all checkboxes/switches in the group on one click again.

**Plunkr Case**
https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-6wsadz

**Current behavior**
After surrounding a `p-dropdown` or `p-multiSelect` with a `label` tag, clicking on the dropdown icon or any portion of the multiSelect no longer expands their options.

**Expected behavior**
The components should behave the same regardless of whether they are wrapped in a `label` tag or not.

**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
1. Insert a `p-dropdown` or `p-multiSelect` in HTML and provide it an array of options.
2. Surround the component with a HTML `label` tag and add some arbitrary label.
3. Observe as the component no longer expands to show its options when clicked.

See example here: https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-6wsadz 

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
My organization would like to implement a wrapped-label form framework so labels and inputs are automatically associated with one another and we no longer have to provide "for" and "id" tags on our labels/inputs. It will save us a lot of headache and boilerplate code in the long run.
