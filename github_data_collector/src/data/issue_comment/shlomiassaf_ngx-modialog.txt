Hi everyone,
I have a question about a feature of ngx-modialog (not sure if it exists or not, so this is just a question)
Is it possible in ngx-modialog to move the modal once it's opened ? In particular, when cursor is near the top of the modal header, an icon appears that shows that it's movable, and we can click on that to move the modal around the page.

Environment:
- Angular version: 6.1.0
- ngx-modialog version: 5.0.1
- Browser: chrome, Firefox, IE

Thanks in advance.

Both. so i'm wondering if ngx-modialog still works with angular 8. i attempted to get it working, everything seems to be working find except one issue that i'm facing.  


* **What is the current behavior?**
NullInjectorError: No provider for Modal$$1!
a NullInjectorError due to the dependency injection not working properly in the constructor declaration of modal (public modal: Modal)


* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via
https://plnkr.co or similar (you can use one of the templates above as a starting point).

1. set up ngx-modialog
2. declare public modal: Modal in the constructor of the desired component 
3. ng serve

* **What is the expected behavior?**
the code will compile with no errors



* **Please tell us about your environment:**

- Angular version: angular 8
- Browser: [Chrome 78.0.3904.108]

IMPORTANT: I could not reproduce the issue using plnkr, so I attached a small zip file [ngx-modialog-demo.zip](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngx-modialog/files/2825883/ngx-modialog-demo.zip)

Report a bug.

* **What is the current behavior?**
If I open a modal in two more more tabs from a `BroadcastChannel`  `onMessage` event, only one of the modals is opened and the rest of the tabs have a thin line (ie the modal template is not rendered). The modal html looks like the following
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/677513/52181307-4576a000-27a5-11e9-8145-0a3ef4ac5fb4.png)

``` html
<modal-overlay style="position: fixed; top: 0px; left: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; z-index: 1500;">
   <div>
      <!---->
      <css-backdrop class="modal-backdrop fade show"></css-backdrop>
      <bs-modal-container class="modal fade show" role="dialog" style="position: absolute; display: block" tabindex="-1">
         <div class="modal-dialog modal-lg" ng-reflect-ng-class="modal-dialog">
            <div class="modal-content" overlaydialogboundary="" role="document" style="display:block">
               <!----> <!---->
            </div>
         </div>
      </bs-modal-container>
   </div>
   <!---->
</modal-overlay>
```

* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via

1. Open [ngx-modialog-demo.zip](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngx-modialog/files/2825883/ngx-modialog-demo.zip).  Or choose any component in an existing app and use the following code
``` typescript
export class AppComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  title = 'ngx-modialog-demo';
  broadCastChannel: BroadcastChannel;

  constructor(public modal: Modal) { }

  ngOnDestroy(): void {
    this.broadCastChannel.close();
  }
  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.broadCastChannel = new BroadcastChannel('ngx-modialog-demo');
    this.broadCastChannel.onmessage = ((_ev: MessageEvent) => {
      const dialogRef = this.modal.alert()
        .size('lg')
        .showClose(true)
        .title('A simple Alert style modal window')
        .body(`
            <h4>Alert is a classic (title/body/footer) 1 button modal window that 
            does not block.</h4>
            <b>Configuration:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Non blocking (click anywhere outside to dismiss)</li>
                <li>Size large</li>
                <li>Dismissed with default keyboard key (ESC)</li>
                <li>Close wth button click</li>
                <li>HTML content</li>
            </ul>`)
        .open();
      dialogRef.result.then(result => { });
    });

    setTimeout(() => {
      this.broadCastChannel.postMessage({});
    }, 2000);

  }
}

```
2. `npm install` (ie  Restore modules)
2. Run the app (`ng serve --port 1234`) and open it in two or more tabs.

* **What is the expected behavior?**
You should see the modal in all opened tabs 2 seconds after the tab is opened.

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
I expect the modal to be shown in all tabs instead of a thin line.

* **Please tell us about your environment:**
    * `ng --version`

* **Other information** (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc)
I could workaround this issue if I click anywhere on the overlay. So I put the following hack inside my components temporarily
``` javascript
   setTimeout(() => {
      // Fixes the modal not rendering issue.
       document.body.click()
    })
```

While it appears to be working correctly, the version compatibility should be updated.
