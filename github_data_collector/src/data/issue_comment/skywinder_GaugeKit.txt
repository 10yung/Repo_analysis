Hi,
I would love to use your beautiful control, but I can't get it to work. I used CocoaPods for importing it, then add @objc in the method requested for  swift 4 support. But then I get this error:

../Main.storyboard: error: IB Designables: Failed to render and update auto layout status for ProvaViewController (Rn0-yv-HO4): dlopen(GaugeKit.framework, 1): no suitable image found.  Did find: GaugeKit.framework: required code signature missing for 'GaugeKit.framework'

Can you help me please?

```

I have a cocoa pod that uses gauge kit as a dependency (https://github.com/jfosterdavis/ZMAppFoundation/tree/release-0.1.5).  When I am doing local development I change line Gauge+Animations.swift:32:10 from:
`func updateProgress(_ timer: Timer) -> Void {`
to
`@objc func updateProgress(_ timer: Timer) -> Void {`

I know that is too early to ask, but we are with a little problem on GaugeKit in iOS 12 using Xcode 10 beta. The GaugeKit was working fine in my app until the last version, but when I updated to iOS 12 and Xcode 10, the app doesn't compile anymore.

This is what I receive from xcode.

Hi

Great project guys!!!

I am trying to add labels of values on the gauge, but when I add the label I got next error:

`View has lost track of its superview, most likely through unsupported use of CALayer API on the view's layer. If this isn't a crash yet, it will be in the near future. `

Any suggestions?
Hello, thanks for this very useful project.
For making it compatible with Swift 4 you just needs to do the following modification :

In file Gauge+Animations.swift
the function:
func updateProgress(_ timer: Timer) -> Void 
needs to have @objc to respond to the selector:
@objc func updateProgress(_ timer: Timer) -> Void
I am just trying to get a "Hello World" with GaugeKit.  Creating a CocoaPod by following guide at (https://developerslogblog.wordpress.com/2017/05/14/swiff-3-reusable-components-using-xib-files-and-the-interface-builder/)

When I add a UIView to my storyboard (or .xib) that is IBDesignable I get "build failed."

When adding to the storyboard and attempting to build I see a #selector issue: "Argument of '#selector' refers to instance method 'updateProgress' that is not exposed to Objective-C"
