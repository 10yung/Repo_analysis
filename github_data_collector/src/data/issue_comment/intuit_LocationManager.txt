if ([launchOptions objectForKey:UIApplicationLaunchOptionsLocationKey])  
this condition always false as launchOptions = nil . all time. 
Can u plese suggest what kind of changes need to do for this. ?
Trying to compile the library for UIKitForMac on the new Xcode 11 is throwing a couple of errors.

Just thought I'd open the ticket. I'll try to make a PR when I get a chance, unless someone else makes it first

Thanks!
I was checking out the documentation for `subscribeToLocationUpdates`, and I noticed there's a difference between the Readme.md and the comment above the function
The Readme.md says:

> If an error occurs, the block will execute with a status other than `INTULocationStatusSuccess`, and the subscription will be kept **alive**.

Meanwhile the comment above `subscribeToSignificantLocationChangesWithBlock` reads:
> If an error occurs, the block will execute with a status other than `INTULocationStatusSuccess`, and the subscription will be **canceled automatically**.

Which one is it now?
@lwdupont can I work on this?
