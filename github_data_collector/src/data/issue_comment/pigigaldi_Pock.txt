**Describe the bug**
0.7.2 was working correctly, but (for unrelated reasons) I removed the music.app.  Pock no longer opens and there is no error notifying why.  Also tried with previous versions (specifically, 0.7 and 0.7.1)

**How to reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Remove music.app
2. Try to open Pock.

**Expected behavior**
Expected to open

**Versions:**
 - macOS version: 10.15.2
 - Pock version:  0.7.2

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

Here's a start for adding Continuous Integration via GitHub Actions. In the future it'd be great to build other targets, and add some tests!
**Describe the feature you'd like to have in Pock**
I find it‚Äôs nice to have the haptic feedback while clicking on the Touch Bar. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
This feature has been implemented in this app. https://github.com/niw/HapticKey But, it will be nice if you can integrate HapticKey's feature in your app. So, there is no need for a separate app.

**Additional context**
I love Pock, which is very handy. I hope Pock can be the only app that every Touch Bar owner will ever need.

**Describe the feature you'd like to improve in Pock**
Make swipe gestures optional.

For a long time I wondered why sometimes Spotify would skip a track when I tried to pause it.  Turns out there's a swipe feature I wasn't aware of, but after experimenting with it, I can't reliably skip tracks in the direction I want to (and often it skips when I want it to pause).

Unless it can be made more reliable, I'd suggest adding an option to disable it.

Hi there, I love using Pock but I miss the opportunity to add an space to shift everything to the side.

Would be nice if you could add an widget for that. Thanks üôè.

Better information in the now playing widget, implemented consistently across the most popular 3 browsers (Chrome, Safari and Firefox).

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I have 2 issues when playing media from a browser:
- Chrome, Safari and Firefox all have different behaviours when media is played from the browser - FF does not trigger the widget. Safari nicely puts the title of the in the widget, but has the sentence 'to play music' as a grey subtext. Chrome always says 'Unknown artist' in the grey subtext. It would be nice if all browsers have consistent behavior. Which brings me to the next issue.
- What if the 3 elements of the widget (the icon, the title and the subtext) have exactly the right information? So, what if the **icon** reveals what application is used (or maybe even the favicon of the site), the **title** has the domain name (the name + optional the tld?) and the **grey subtext** has the title of the site.

**Additional context**
Something like this:

and it's on the far right, leads to the length of whole date item changes each second.

Date Item seems to vibrate once a second.

**The trigger range of the ESC button needs to be expanded.**
In system native touchbar, I don't need to press the ESC button accurately. Even if I don't touch the ESC button, the ESC button can still be triggered. But now half of my thumb touches the ESC button, and it's not triggered.

Would love to see a google calendar widget that shows the name of your next event E.g. work meeting as well as how many minutes until that event starts.
