Add ability to find out about new finger enrollment
If we tap outside Biometric Dialog it is dismissing. It should remain as it is.
Would be nice be able to use Authenticationresult
When I try to authenticate via fingerprint, onComplete is being invoked. After that, if I try to authenticate again successfully, onComplete is not being invoked.
