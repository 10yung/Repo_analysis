I'm currently trying to update the code to just use the foldUp and accordion methods and rotate specifically between those two.  I want the accordion to fold out at a specific angle instead of a randomly generated angle as well as have the method function switch between foldUp and accordion and not be randomly generated.

(function() {
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    var demos, methods;

    demos = [
      new OriDomi('.paper-map', {
        vPanels: 8,
        ripple: true
      })
    ];
    setTimeout(function() {
      demos[0].accordion(15);
    }, 1000);
    methods = ['accordion', 'foldUp'];
    return document.getElementById('content').addEventListener('click', function(e) {
      var angle, el, method, n;
      if ((el = e.target).className !== 'button') {
        return;
      }
      n = el.getAttribute('data-n');
      method = methods[Math.abs(Math.floor(Math.random() * methods.length - Math.random()))];
      angle = ['15'];
      demos[n][method](method !== 'foldUp' ? angle : void 0);
      if (method === 'foldUp') {
        angle = '';
      }
      return el.parentNode.getElementsByClassName('label')[0].innerHTML = method + "(" + angle + ")";
    }, false);
  });

}).call(this);


There's the updated code.  Every time I try to specifically define the angle, it throws this error "Cannot set property 'innerHTML' of undefined" - relating to the demos[n] function.  Could you point me in the right direction for switching between the two specific methods with pre-set angles?
I have downloaded and used this library and had a lot of fun. But, I have an issue that we can only manipulate one side. I have a requirement in which I want to manipulate and apply oridomi functions to all the sides of the div. I want to ask if it is possible, if yes then how and if not then why.

Thank you.

I pulled this out of my other issue, because it is unrelated.
- Tested on firefox that this works okay. too glitchy on chrome to test well. the mouse dragging animation just snaps into place, and if folding is triggered by JS, then it goes too fast to catch.
- in chrome, `folded.accordion(100)` works smoothly, `folded.accordion(0)` happens instantly. `folded.unfold()` halfway works. The first unfold motion glitches, then the remainder are okay. my intuition is that it is diving behind other DOM elements, even though the container has a z-index of 1000.
- yeah, this is the case. I can test with `folded.ramp(6)` versus `folded.ramp(-6)`. In firefox everything is a-okay, in Chrome only `folded.ramp(-6)` is okay because it goes towards the viewer instead of `folded.ramp(6)` which dives behind other elements.

Hello, thank you for this library.
I have encountered an issue with my implementation, i would like to use Oridomi to show/hide additional information in a list. Is there a way to remove the space taken (on the flight) by the element being closed?

Here a sample of my problem : http://jsfiddle.net/n8jLd9dc/

First off, this is a superb plugin - thank you!

One question - if I have three custom panels, is there a way to keep the last panel from changing perspective so that it appears 'flat' during animation? I'm trying to do this so that the flow of the page appears to be pushing the page down. 

edit: just to elaborate, after reading the docs the Custom Behaviour looks like it will do what I'm after: 

"...For example, if you wanted to create a fold-in effect that keeps the first and last panels flat against the page surface" 

So I'm after an accordion effect with 3 panels, the last panel to appear "flat". Not sure how to implement - any suggestions? 

Hi there! I've been having quite a bit of fun with OriDomi â€“ thanks for making it available to us. I have, however, encountered an issue with one implementation in particular that I was hoping to execute: I would like to have an OriDomi overlaying another aligned element, such that folding it up would more or less seamlessly reveal what's beneath. Unfortunately, after OriDomi has done it's magic on my overlay DOM element, it no longer aligns with what's beneath. You can see more specifically what I'm talking about in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/crowjonah/8vn7r/

You'll notice that if you comment out the OriDomi JS, the vertical columns line up perfectly.

Let me know if you have any suggestions for me!

It would be great if there was a way for the element as it is unfolding to have other element appear connected to it for things like folding menus. the way the main application looks attached to the menu in this video.

After binding oriDomi to an element a strange amount of whitespace appears at the bottom of the container.

well it's kinda hard to explain what i mean so i just post screenshots

and chrome (for comparison how it should be)

in firefox the last fold somehow goes to the top 
only tested with firefox nightly (28.0a1) don't know if it happens in other versions too
