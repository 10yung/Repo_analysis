I know that the way to define mirrors for apt-fast is to use the apt-fast configuration file but the script should also parse mirror:// URIs and work with the selected mirror.

I thought it would be a good idea to implement an automatic mirror selection command (apt-fast best-mirrors-select for example) to add best mirrors according to the location of user like what we have for best server selection in ubuntu.

aptitude & apt-get uses different policies to decide the dependencies, apt-fast uses apt-get's to decide, if we let apt-fast to use aptitude, it may miss some files or download useless files.
