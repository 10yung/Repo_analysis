Server currently throws 500 if a job is posted to it w/ an unknown action type.

After restarting PostgreSQL, writing/reading to the database fails needing a restart to cloud crowd server and node.

settable in the config.yml

current log messages in the server log look like:

```
2015-02-05-22:29:16: Job 2170513 WorkUnit 7748950 large_document_import succeeded in 0.13942971
2015-02-05-22:29:16: Job #2170513 (large_document_import) succeeded.
```

It would be nice if it were clear what kind of WorkUnit each unit is (whether it's a split, process or merge for example), or even go so far as to set up a system where completed/failed work units, when posted back to the central server include a customizable message in the JSON data blob it each worker sends.

Currently we're logging using good 'ole `puts`. 

It'd be nice to be able to set levels in the config file and only spew the verbose logging messages when the level is set to :debug.

Since Ruby has a nice Logger class that's built into the standard lib, we should use that.

I have hit a problem with a big set of `inputs` (500+). I am building a file compression box. An action to zip a set of inputs

When I try and merge the `input` it appears that upstream, in the process, the `inputs` have "blown up. " Process is just saving each file to S3, and should return the new path to the inputs Array. 

Specifically, in the merge `inputs` should be an `Array`, but instead it is coming though as a `String`.

Error Message looks like this 

```
Worker #18890: {:pid=>18890, :id=>370, :time=>0.007631538, :status=>"failed", :output=>"{\"output\":\"undefined method `each' for #<String:0x00000002995078>\"}"}
```

Anyone else ever hit this?

I thought this Could this be due to a text field on the database filling up with many characters. I switched this to a `longtext` field but that didn't do the trick.

Is there some other memory issue with filling an array? 

Here's my action. It is erroring on the block with `inputs.each`

```
require 'zip/zip'
require 'zip/zipfilesystem'
require 'fileutils'
require 'rest-client' 
require 'json'
class ScanZipper < CloudCrowd::Action

  #Download files
  def process
    save_path = save("#{file_name}")
    save_path
  end

  #Archive them.
  def merge
    puts input.class
    puts input
    name = options['last_name']
    date = Time.now
    date = date.strftime("%Y%m%d")
    url = options["point"]
    scan_id = options["scan_id"]
    files_to_remove = []

    zip_file_name = "#{name}#{date}.zip"
    zipfile = Zip::ZipFile.open(zip_file_name, Zip::ZipFile::CREATE) do |zip|
      input.each do |batch_url|
        batch_path = File.basename(batch_url)
        file = download(batch_url, batch_path)
        puts batch_path
        tmp_file = batch_path
        zip.add batch_path, file
        files_to_remove << file
      end
    end

    zip_path = save("#{name}#{date}.zip")

    files_to_remove.each {|f| File.delete f}  

    zip_path
  end


end
```

Hi,

We are evaluating cloud-crowd. We are able to set both server and node up via the crowd command (currently on the same server machine running Ubuntu 10.04) and run some actions. However, when stopping a node via Ctrl-C, I got the following errors on both node and server, and they both crashed. Current cloud-crowd version: 0.6.2.

Not sure if this is a bug or something I did not do right, and I'd appreciate it if you could shed some light on me.

Thanks,
Alex
