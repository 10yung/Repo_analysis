concfg uses the following code to resolve roaming application data folder:
`$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\<etc>`

However in some (Enterprise) environments, the folder is redirected to a location outside the users profile folder (e.g. on a network share or on a different drive).

I would suggest to resolve the path like this:
`[environment]::GetFolderPath("applicationdata")`

Or if it's the Start Menu folder you can query the path directly:

`[environment]::GetFolderPath("StartMenu")`

Output in my environment:
```
PS C:\> [environment]::GetFolderPath("StartMenu")
D:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu
PS C:\> "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu"
C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu

```
[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) is in beta, and there's no support for concfg. When I set a theme, it works fine when I launch powershell directly, but not when I try to launch it through the new terminal (there's no effect and the old white on blue theme is still there). 
I would like to be able to `choco install concfg`.

I'm using Ansible to configure our development boxes, and it has built-in support for Chocolatey: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/win_chocolatey_module.html

It could be similar to the `poshgit` package: https://chocolatey.org/packages/poshgit
I used concfg import solarized-dark

After that I can't use dir option, e.g., dir/ad/w

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but doing a 'git diff' always seems to end up with grayscale text colors. I'd really like to see lines removed as red, lines added as green, and file information as yellow. Is there a way to get concfg to do that?
When I use `wget` to download a file, I get this style popup

As you can see, that yellow on teal is very difficult to read and quite straining on the eyes. I am using the [Back to the Code theme](https://github.com/lukesampson/concfg/blob/8ec3cabaac0d9b01e674492f82d935b257c719e4/presets/back-to-the-code.json), which has `"popup_colors":  "dark_magenta,white"`. My console properties confirm the configured popup style:

So what's causing that teal and yellow popup styling? Can this be configured?
Win32 puts the intensity on the upper colors so that intense/bold/light are to the right here:

But concfg (at least for solarized) reverses that, so that apps that ask for intense or bold get the opposite. Is that an issue just with your solarized sample, or is it reversed in all of concfg?

The [PowerShell Gallery](https://powershellgallery.com) is the official, public Microsoft repository for PowerShell modules. It would be really cool if we could add this functionality to the gallery. Let me know if you want help converting this to a module.
