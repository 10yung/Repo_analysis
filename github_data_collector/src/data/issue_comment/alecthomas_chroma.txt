**Describe the bug**

A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Screenshots are often helpful here.

In this code block, the HTML should be highlighted as HTML, not plaintext:

Do *NOT* just paste a link to other issues on GitHub.

**To Reproduce**

1. Provide copyable *text* (not an image) that reproduces the issue.
```
I love science (Lee 2018).

```
2. Provide a `chroma` command-line invocation to reproduce the issue with the above input text. eg. for Hugo the (rough) equivalent would be `chroma -s monokailight --html --html-lines --html-lines-table --html-inline-styles <source>`

I think that the CLI invocation above should work.

Do *NOT* provide configuration for another tool (eg. Hugo). My time is limited and if you want me to fix your issue, help me help you.

Some languages support these that have not been added. For example:

- Go
- JavaScript
- Python

https://developer.mozilla.org/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Numeric_separators

Here is an example implementation:

https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma/blob/a41c89767d07cc9bd9dce4c5ba2541bbe715f050/lexers/e/elixir.go#L39-L43
In the following bash script, the **#** in third line did not parsed as comment. 

```
#####
# bash 
#
something ....
```


I have noticed that this:

~~~php
$s1 = 'sunday';
echo "${s1}\n";
~~~

produces different highlighting from this:

~~~php
$s1 = 'sunday';
# github.com parser recognizes the variable, chroma only sees a string literal
echo "$s1\n";
~~~

I use chroma from Hugo.

When I write #define or #include in C/C++, I get an extra blank line after the directives.
I use it with css style. 
 
How can I fix it?

I see a few related issues and merged PR that add support for table-based HTMl line numbers.

I don't see similar support for the ANSI / terminal formatters.

Is anyone else interested in this?
**What problem does this feature solve?**

When writing Go test suites, sometimes I want to dump regexp. And color highlighting would be helpful.

**What feature do you propose?**

Add support for Go regexp syntax. https://golang.org/s/re2syntax

Github is ok， but a rendering error occurs in  https://hacpai.com/article/1570754498261#toc_h3_2. 

`/React.Fragment>` has class `highlight-err`

code:
```jsx
//Add the component to the render function
function App() {
  const [isModal, setModal] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <button onClick={() => setModal(true)}>Click Here</button>
      <Modal
        isVisible={isModal}
        title="Modal Title"
        content={<p>Add your content here</p>}
        footer={<button>Cancel</button>}
        onClose={() => setModal(false)}
      />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
