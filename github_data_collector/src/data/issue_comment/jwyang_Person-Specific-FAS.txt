Showing error in the file "TargetDA_PCA_withSubNum" on the domain adaptation part.

Reference to non-existent field 'PNLabels_train'.

Error in TargetDA_PCA_withSubNum (line 20)
PNLabels_train = Labels_train_SL.PNLabels_train;

Here's the screenshot:

Please any suggestion on how to solve this problem.
 I think your instruction about how to run the code may be lack one important step，which may be plugged after "train models",  because after trained models, when I go into Test_Models and run "runall_ps.m" or "runall_gen.m", it comes up one prompt  as follows:

   ```
 "Unable to read file '../Develop_Models/GenericPerf_devel_withSubNum_HOG_PCA_Enroll.mat'. No such file or directory.
     Error in test_GenericModel_withSubNum_specific_quality (line 232)
load(strcat('../Develop_Models/GenericPerf_devel_withSubNum_', name{Feat_Type}, '_', method, '_', suffix, '.mat'));"

```
 Then I think, I may shoud run the Develop_Models/runall_ps.m or runall_gen.m first, but there is another wrong prompt
 ```
" Error using  + Matrix dimensions must agree. 
  Error in devel_FASModels_specific_quality (line 249)   scores = scores_specific + scores_generic;"
```
It was caused at line 247 in devel_FASModels_specific_quality.m,  of which the parameter "GenericModel" is a 15*1 cell, not a model struct.
 
At last，may I offer you a proposal in  good faith that may you purge the code before release, so many commented code may perplex others who want follow your code. Thank you a lot.
