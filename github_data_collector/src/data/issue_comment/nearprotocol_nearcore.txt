```
As a continuation of `rpctypegen` introduced in https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore/pull/1854 we should have a tool that allows us to map any Rust struct/enum/union to its closest equivalent in a different language.
The tool should be implemented as a cargo plugin and will use `syn` and `quote` to process the source code of the given project.

For example, the following command will iterate over the file structure of the given Rust project and for each file generate Python file that for each Rust struct/enum/union struct contains Python class together with methods that allow us to serialize/deserialize Rust struct/enum/union <-> Python class between each other using JSON or Borsh:
```
cargo rusttofu --lang=py --output=/tmp/my_python_project
```

Note, that currently for some languages we are using an intermediate JSON schema (e.g. for TypeScript and Python) to perform serialization/deserialization. With this tool, it might not be needed, since we can generate the TypeScript or Python code.

We would need to support the following languages for which we are already doing the mapping manually: C/TypeScript/AssemblyScript/Python/Solidity . 

Note, I propose the name Rust Tofu as a play on the phrase "Rust to foo" where "foo" denotes something. Other name suggestions are welcome.
Right now if the partial encoded chunk arrives before a block, the next block producer will reject the partial encoded chunk, and won't include it in the block.

Add a cache for future chunks, up to `MAX_HEIGHTS_AHEAD` heights ahead, and store there partial encoded chunks for which we don't know the previous block.
We need to add some rpc/http endpoint for transaction signing.
