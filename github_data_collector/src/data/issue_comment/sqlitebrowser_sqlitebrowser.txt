Recipe:
* Click "Execute SQL"
* Run a SELECT query of some sort that returns multiple columns, preferably with longish values that are ellipse-truncated in the default view
* Make columns wider so you can read the values
* Re-run the query

**Actual behavior:** Table columns go back to default size. ðŸ˜¢

**Desired behavior:**  Table should not reset column widths when the query contains columns with the same names as the previous query

Details for the issue
--------------------

#### What did you do?

1. Open sqlitebrowser, any database
2. Run `select json_extract('{"type":"Explicit","duration":2.133}', '$.duration')`

#### What did you expect to see?

2.133

#### What did you see instead?

2.0

When doing the same in the sqlite3 shell, the returned value is as expected.

Details for the issue
--------------------

#### What did you do?
1\. Create a new database.

2\. Run below SQL:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE main (
       id INTEGER,
       value TEXT,
       PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

INSERT INTO main
VALUES (1, 'test'), (2, 'test2'), (3, 'test3');

CREATE VIEW v_main AS
SELECT rowid AS rid, *
  FROM main
 WHERE id < 3;

 CREATE TRIGGER v_main
INSTEAD OF UPDATE OF id, value ON v_main
  BEGIN
        UPDATE main
           SET id = NEW.id,
               value = NEW.value
         WHERE id = OLD.id;
   END;
```

3\. Switch to "v_main" in the `Browser Data` tab.

4\. Try to modify the "id" or "value" field.

#### What did you expect to see?
I should be able to modify the "id" or "value" filed via clicking on a field and input a value in the "Browse Data" tab, and be able to modify the value using the "Edit Database Cell" after clicking on a field. (According to #1756)

#### What did you see instead?
I can modify the "id" or "value" filed in the "Browse Data" tab, but it doesn't apply after I input a new value and press Enter.

The content field and the "Apply" button are always in disabled status when I click on the "id" or "value" field in the "v_main" view in the "Browse Data" tab.

Details for the issue
--------------------
DB4S v3.11.99 (Jan  7 2020) [built for x86_64-little_endian-llp64] on Windows 10 (10.0) (winnt/10.0.18362) [x86_64]
using SQLite Version 3.30.1
using Spatialite 5.0.0-beta

I am trying to work with Spatialite in DB4S. I have had a series of issues that I think I have finally narrowed down to a legitimate bug. 

In DB4S I create a clean in-memory database, and then I run the following SQL; I've provided in-line commentary with expected behavior

```
SELECT sqlite_version(); --Return 3.30.1
SELECT load_extension('mod_spatialite.dll'); --Return Null; load extension
SELECT spatialite_version(); --Return 5.0.0-beta0
SELECT InitSpatialMetaData(1); --Return 1; create Spatialite MetaData tables and triggers
SELECT CheckSpatialMetaData(); --Return 3; indicating the DB MetaData is Spatialite compliant
CREATE TABLE "test" (
	"Field1"	INTEGER);
SELECT AddGeometryColumn('test' ,'geom' , -1 , 'POINT') --Return 1
```
This however, doesn't work. ```SELECT spatialite_version();``` works as expected, the extension appears to be loaded. However ```SELECT InitSpatialMetaData(1);``` returns 0, indicating that the Spatialite function didn't run.  ```AddGeometryColumn('test' ,'geom' , -1 , 'POINT')``` likewise returns 0. 

After a lot of trial and error, what I discovered is that this code does work(ish) if I do the following: 
```
SELECT sqlite_version();
SELECT load_extension('mod_spatialite.dll');
SELECT spatialite_version();
SELECT InitSpatialMetaData(1);
SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM "main".sqlite_master;
SELECT CheckSpatialMetaData();
CREATE TABLE "test" (
	"Field1"	INTEGER);
SELECT AddGeometryColumn('test' ,'geom' , -1 , 'POINT')
PRAGMA "main".TABLE_INFO("test")
```

```SELECT InitSpatialMetaData(1);``` still returns 0. But when I run ```SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM "main".sqlite_master``` I see that in fact all of the tables and triggers have been created- this is reflected in the GUI only after I run ```SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM "main".sqlite_master``` 

When I run ```SELECT AddGeometryColumn('test' ,'geom' , -1 , 'POINT')``` it appears to fail as well. But after running ```PRAGMA "main".TABLE_INFO("test")``` the new column is reflected in the GUI. 

Checking the SQL Error log in DB4S- the following errors show up:

On loading/creating database: 
```
(21) API call with invalid database connection pointer
(21) misuse at line 157333 of [18db032d05]
```

On ```SELECT InitSpatialMetaData(1);``` : 
```
(1) statement aborts at 1: [BEGIN] cannot start a transaction within a transaction
(1) table spatial_ref_sys already exists in "CREATE TABLE spatial_ref_sys (
srid INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
auth_name TEXT NOT NULL,
auth_srid INTEGER NOT NULL,
ref_sys_name TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Unknown',
pro
(1) table spatial_ref_sys already exists in "CREATE TABLE spatial_ref_sys (
srid INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
auth_name TEXT NOT NULL,
auth_srid INTEGER NOT NULL,
ref_sys_name TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Unknown',
pro
(1) statement aborts at 1: [ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT "RESTOREPOINT";] no such savepoint: RESTOREPOINT
(1) statement aborts at 1: [RELEASE "RESTOREPOINT";] no such savepoint: RESTOREPOINT
```

On ```SELECT AddGeometryColumn('test' ,'geom' , -1 , 'POINT')```:
```
(1) duplicate column name: geom in "ALTER TABLE "test" ADD COLUMN "geom" POINT "
(1) duplicate column name: geom in "ALTER TABLE "test" ADD COLUMN "geom" POINT "
(1) duplicate column name: geom in "ALTER TABLE "test" ADD COLUMN "geom" POINT "
```

Looking at the Spatialite logs, spatialite appears to be perfectly happy. Despite ```InitSpatialMetaData()``` and ```AddGeometryColumn()``` returning 0 - the log shows the underlying operations as successful with no error.

My theories from troubleshooting are as follows:

1. DB4S for some reason doesn't like the bulk operations being performed by the Spatialite functions. It only reflects the changes to the DB in GUI after being forced to by touching ```PRAGMA```. I figured this out by noticing that the changes showed up in the GUI after the application submitted SQL code involving ```PRAGMA```
2. The SQL Error Log combined with the Spatialite Log is leading me to believe that what is happening with the functions returning 0 is not actually that they're failing. There is something about the SpatiaLite-SQLite-DB4S interaction which is causing the underlying SQL to loop, and the errors to be handled but logged. The zero that is being returned by ```InitSpatialMetaData()``` isn't telling me the operation failed- but that it ran successfully, and then immediately ran again- the 0 that I get as a response is the response from whatever the last iteration of the loop was, and Spatialite saying the _last_ iteration didn't run because the tables had all been created the first time.

It appears to be something about the way DB4S batches SQL statements - but I haven't the fuzziest what to do / try from here.

As housekeeping: I did confirm that all the .dlls I'm using function (using the SQLite CLI).

I've replicated this behavior
-across two computers
-with both the stable release and 'next-gen' variants of SpatiaLite
-Using all three possible methods in DB4S of loading extensions

### Details for the issue
My scenario is I'm trying to open a .db file from a shared network location (windows server) on the Mac version of DB4S, and each time I try to open any db file, I get the following error:
"Could not open database file.
Reason: unable to open database file"

If I move the file to my local machine, the db opens with no issue.

I have looked at my log files for the DB Process and I don't see anything that really jumps out that would indicate a problem. 
Im thinking that it might be a problem with writing to the network location, but my permissions for the network location allow me to RWX. I have tried searching the forums, but haven't found anything that fits this specific scenario. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
