Like written in title. I've used PageControls in the past and really like it, but currently my project requires a higher version of Swift, so I've updated the code :)
~/Pods/LLCycleScrollView/Lib/LLCycleScrollView/LLFilledPageControl.swift:119:34: Type 'CAShapeLayerFillRule' (aka 'NSString') has no member 'evenOdd'

somebody help 
With Xcode Version 10.1 (10B61)
With Swift 4.2
SomeWay?
I can`t.
It would be really nice if you made this a public var, instead of private
var inactiveLayers = [CALayer]()

so then people could subclass the PageControl class and change colors of individual dots, etc. Or at least some way to access individual dots. 

Thanks for creating this good control.

I'm going to use this control in UIPageViewController, but I can't set progress as float since UIPageViewController have no percentage of animation.
Please let me know if there is any other approach that I can use your control in my UIPageViewController.

Thank you.
