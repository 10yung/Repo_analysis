Greetings, The code looks really great and is very nice . But It would be great if someone took up the task of Documenting and commenting the code .

Reason : There might be users who aren't accustomed to matlab and would want to implement it in python or some other framework , In that case a proper documentation of all the functions and commenting would really add a lot of meaning and value to the code . 

Its Just a suggestion :)
