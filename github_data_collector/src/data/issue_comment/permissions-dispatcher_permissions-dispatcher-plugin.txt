Missing  add ```apply plugin: 'kotlin-kapt'``` code  into Gradle for kotlin version 
Now it won't add ```apply plugin: 'kotlin-kapt'``` code ,And then I paste much time to find that was missing the code.
It would be greate for generating code like this:
```gradle
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android-extensions'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-kapt'

```

Once it is stable release, this plugin will drop v3 support.

Currently, we have a lot of duplicated methods and logics in View classes. 

After createing generating missing functions, I think it's time to refactoring code.

Create inspection that add missing onRequestPermissionsResult
I'm not quite sure if it is possible but if the user pick one permission, then add corresponding uses-permission to AndroidManifest. 
Tend to forget to update latest version of PD, I really need to have it.
i think better

select line on existed function on generete Runtime Permissions,
NeedPermission into functionName in TextBox

and Generate push 
existing function above additonal Annotation.

This is too much hope

Existed function using replace
> XXXDispacher.functionWith (this)

It is awesome if you can
I haven't used this one, yet, but it is nice to have binding library to handle UI, like checkbox. https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwing seems the library for swing binding.
