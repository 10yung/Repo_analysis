This package is not being actively maintained. If you're interested in contributing or taking over, please express your interest here.
I first stumbled upon this fun package after reading [this RPubs post](http://rpubs.com/dsollberger/Rmemes) and I really enjoy being able to create memes within the friendly confines of R :smile: 

I see that a few of the APIs have been updated (especially [meme captain](https://memecaptain.com)) and there's certainly been a lot of growth in the R tooling for interacting with web content and APIs (particular [`httr`](http://httr.r-lib.org) and [`crul`](https://github.com/ropensci/crul)).  Do you have interest in maintaining this package and eventually releasing to CRAN?  I've been starting to contribute to other R packages that wrap various APIs and it would be a good learning experience to try and get `meme` ready for a CRAN release and incorporate the aforementioned new tooling.  But I wanted to check with you first before I go much further.  Thanks again for this and your other excellent R packages!

First of all, kudos for writing and maintaining this awesome and fun package!

Unfortunately I've just faced some issues with most recent dev version of the package:

``` r
> library(meme)
> templates <- get_templates("memecaptain")
Error in file(con, "r") : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In get_templates("memecaptain") : HTTP Status404: Not Found
```

Any ideas?
