Hey thanks for this, looks really great. Was wondering how I tell which view is being displayed though as viewDidLoad is called when the drawerViewController is first made. ViewDidAppear is also run on first instance, so is there another method like drawerDidClose or CentreViewIsShowing or something that I can use to tell which view is currently being displayed?


I am showing the selected/highlighted table view cell of left drawer using setSelected/setHighlighted methods and overriding cell views. The first item in left drawer is Home and last item is Settings.

I tap Login button and segue to Login screen. On Login screen, instead of login I choose to go back to Settings. When I tap on the menu to activate drawer, I see first cell (Home) of left drawer table view selected instead of the last one (Settings). However the application is still showing Settings view controller. Please help.

Hello, I'm sorry, my English is not very good.When I left click on the button in the animation view, middle view current effect is highly indentation, is there any way to set the height of the intermediate view is not change

I'm having an issue calling this in a presentviewcontroller. I want the main view to resume after a user logs in but nothing happens:

SideViewController *about = [AppDelegate globalDelegate].drawerViewController;
                [self presentViewController:about animated:YES completion:nil];

SideViewController being a subclass of JVFloatingDrawerViewController!

iOS 9 compiler gives a warning for this, incorrect return type given for this method.
Also removed the extra semicolon.

Dear Julian:
in centerViewController,

Thank you very much. ^^

If the device receives a call (or other action which causes the status bar to extend) and the user opens the hidden menu and then changes to another controller, the result is that the extended status bar overlaps the navigation bar of the displayed view controller.

This behaviour was reported by https://github.com/yumsmools on KyleGoddard/KGFloatingDrawer and the issue affects both libraries.
