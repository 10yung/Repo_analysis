Hi,
Is there anyway to handle invalid xmlChar. I know which character is broking my xml and i want to remove/replace it. 


1.I want to create a null node Like </nullnode>，But when I call the  method [body setValue:nil forKey:@"nullnode"]，The dictionary no have this key and value，So I can't create this node by call the [body XMLString]，How can I create the null node?

2.I wan‘t create CDATA node By "setvalue for key" method，But now I should call method like [header setValue:<![CDATA[yezhichao]]>" forKey:@"user_id"]; ，But when I call the XMLString method ,the result string will like this : "&lt;![CDATA[yezhichao]]&gt; "，So Can we create  a method to create the  CDATA node?

Currently `XMLDictionary` does not handle or even catch `NSError`'s that come from `NSEXMLParser. It would be great if it did.

 NSMutableArray *nodes = [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity:[node count]];

Apparently Apple also has a method named:
- (NSString *)XMLString

this can cause many many issues….

XMLDictionary's [NSDictionary XMLString] method returns a plist XML on OS X 10.10.5 but returns a correct XML on OS X 10.7.5.

Hi,

I am facing an issue while parsing an array with single element in XML. Please refer below example for more details.

```
<Xml>
    <Item>
        <created_at>Sat Apr 14 00:20:07 +0000 2012</created_at>
        <text>Sample text</text>
        <id_str>190957570511478784</id_str>
    </Item>
    <Item>
        <created_at>Sat Apr 14 00:20:07 +0000 2012</created_at>
        <text>Sample text</text>
       <id_str>190957570511478784</id_str>
    </Item>
</Xml>
```

If I am going to parse above xml in to dictionary I will get "Item" as an Array. But if there is only single element of "Item" it will be consider as a dictionary. It happen many times when there is a case of  getting a single element in array and other time it has multiple elements, e.g location kind of APIs. 

How can I manage this case with my objective-c property type? In above case if I take "Item" as NSArray type and in response if I get only single element of "Item" it will be converted to NSDictionary type, and I will get a crash in this case.

Please help me in above scenario and guide me if my understating is not proper.

Hi,

Is there attribute parsing support for XML response? I looked at all the methods and properties, but did not get any such methods. Also, I gone through the sample example, but it does not contain such scenarios as below:

```
       <SrcGeos>
            <Geo>
                <Level1 DisplayText="Sao Paulo" Code="saopaulo"/>
                <Level2 DisplayText="Sao Paulo" Code="saopaulo"/>
                <City DisplayText="Sao Paulo" Code="saopaulo"/>
                <Country DisplayText="Brazil" Code="brazil"/>
                <Latitude>-23.5475</Latitude>
                <Longitude>-46.63611</Longitude>
                <Region DisplayText="Latin America" Code="latinamerica"/>
            </Geo>
        </SrcGeos>
```

Do you think to update your pod to support this new platform soon? Or a branch to avoid breaking the master until CocoaPods release a version working with tvos? 

I don't think you will have any issue to handle it with the current version.
