- Added out-of-the-box Dark Mode support for iOS 13.
- Fixed overlay opacity when presenting multiple alerts on top of each other.
Is there a way to resize SCLAlertView height and width in real time?

Sorry for bad English.

Thanks.

Added missing icons, 
now using LaunchScreen storyboard, 
example supports Dark mode,
min target is 9.0
`SCLAlertView` still has a while background in dark mode. This looks especially bad if there is a text field:

My project can normally work until I update the Xcode to Version 11.0 (11A420a).
Now,When it runs in a little while,it crashes.The error message is as follows:

dyld: Symbol not found: _OBJC_CLASS_$__TtCs12_SwiftObject

What can I do to address the problem?
Thanks in advance.
Portrait dialog with title and subtitle :

Now broken layout in landscape:

It would be cool if layout looks ok in any orientation. Maybe even scrollable or hiding of title or subtitle would be ok but as I see it in this case there is still plenty of space to display everything.

Any idea how I can fix it without having to move it to other solution or my custom UI ? Thanks.


Is there a way to set a switch in the dialog with a custom view that would allow you to change a text field (numeric) to red if selected?  Trying to come up with a way to allow the user to enter a score value and if negative turn the text red as an indication as we don't have a negative number pad object.
Is there no compatibility with VoiceOver? Can this library not be used on projects with accessibility for the visually impaired?
When I load up the SCAlertView I want to set some text to load into the TextView.
 So something that has previously been written, will stay in the box when they reopen the alert view.
