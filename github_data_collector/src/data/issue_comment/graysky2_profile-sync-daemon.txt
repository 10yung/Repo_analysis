Note that if you're using overlayfs mode, your user needs to have sudo right to /usr/bin/psd-overlay-helper or else psd will refuse to run in overlayfs mode.

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ psd p
Profile-sync-daemon v6.35 on Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)

 Systemd service is currently active.
 Systemd resync-timer is currently active.
 Overlayfs v23 is currently active.

I forgot sudo setting , but psd p shows overlayfs is active. 
both floccus and passman get resets and/or locked by passwords and their de novo setting gets lost on browser exit :-(   same with adblock and perhaps more  WTF? 
I have a configuration that resembles https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Mounting_at_login .` /home/` is mounted when I log in, and unmounted when I log out.

Problem is, every time I log in, `psd p` sees an ungraceful state, and makes a new crash recovery backup. I can log in, `systemctl --user stop psd`, log out, log back in, and it'll do it again.

I think it's probably a systemd problem or a pam problem and there's an issue with exactly when /home gets mounted and unmounted, but I have no idea how to debug that. (I'm fully willing to debug, to be clear.)
After any power loss i need manual restore chromium folder:
```
systemctl --user stop psd
cd ~/.config
rm -rf chromium
cp -pR chromium-backup-crashrecovery-20190723_115402 chromium
systemctl --user start psd
```

This a very terrible. 

In syslog i have:
```
Jul 23 11:54:01 localhost systemd[1354]: Started Timer for profile-sync-daemon - 1Hour.
Jul 23 11:54:02 localhost profile-sync-daemon[1391]: Ungraceful state detected for /home/user/.config/chromium so fixing
Jul 23 11:57:24 localhost profile-sync-daemon[1391]: mv: cannot move '/home/user/.config/chromium-back-ovfs' в '/home/user/.config/chromium': Directory not empty
Jul 23 11:57:25 localhost profile-sync-daemon[1391]: #033[01mchromium sync successful#033[00m
```

After few minutes of debug i found some problems. 
What's happening by step:

1. Run chromium and press hard reset button on PC. 
2. Poweron PC
3. `profile-sync-daemon` detects `Ungraceful state` by existance broken symlink ~/.config/chromium
4. `profile-sync-daemon` deletes symlink `~/.config/chromium`
5. `profile-sync-daemon` begin copying `~/.config/chromium-back` into `~/.config/chromium-crashrecovery-$NOW` for backup purposes. That takes a long time!!!
6. But user fast like
lightning and he launches Chromium after ~1 minutes from boot!!! On this moment №5 not finished!!!!! Chromium creates own `~/.config/chromium` with default config. 
7. After long time ago `profile-sync-daemon` has finished backup process. And tries move `~/.config/chromium-back-ovfs` to `~/.config/chromium`. But chrome already launched and `~/.config/chromium` already exists. We got error `Directory not empty`. :( 

Need some kind of locking mechanism for browser launch before crashrecovery copying not finished. May be link ~/.config/chromium to /dev/null, not sure.

And `USE_BACKUPS=no` wont fix this. A description of the alleged problem was written here earlier, but I was wrong.
Need more time for debug it later (why USE_BACKUPS=no wont fix this issue).

```

If I try to clean the recovery dirs, then it cleans both of them on the first try which leaves none for the other one:

Given that there's an opera, opera-beta, opera-developer, and opera-legacy; and google-chrome, google-chrome-beta, nd google-chrome-unstable, I'm just slightly surprised that there's only one for Firefox (not counting the Ubuntu firefox-trunk).
Hi, I tried installing using the src from github, running make install from a wheel-group enabled account with no home directory.  I found myself stuck with the user unable to view the profiles, which /usr/bin/psd reported as belonging to root.  I uninstalled and then reinstalled having added my normal user to the wheel group, to enable sudo, so that I could then run sudo make install.
    systemctl --user start psd
then reported that systemctl could not find a psd.service file.  I located the file in /usr/lib/systemd/user/psd and reran the command with the fully qualified file path for the unit service file.
    systemctl --user start /usr/lib/systemd/user/psd
and the following was reported:
Failed to start usr-lib-systemd-user-psd.mount: Unit usr-lib-systemd-user-psd.mount not found.

Several times I lost last part of my work on browser (open tabs, bookmarks, history, ...).
This happens when my laptop fails to resume (a known hardware fault).

Talking about `psd`, is there a way to workaround it? Forcing the `psd` service to sync profile when pc calls for a suspend? Or actually is this already done?
I have been using psd for the last few weeks because [Google Chrome calls fsync() about every second](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=52663). In my test, psd does save some battery, and I'd like to have it working reliably for when I buy a SSD.

The problem is that because of psd, when I close Chrome and logout/reboot - my settings are restored from a state of days or weeks ago (probably the state of when I last started Chrome - I leave it open for a long time). I generally lose all my open tabs, recent bookmarks and even extensions. This happens most of the time.

psd was installed and configured as the following:

    $ sudo apt install profile-sync-daemon
    $ sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/99personal
    teresaejunior ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/psd-overlay-helper
    $ egrep -v '^#|^$' .config/psd/psd.conf 
    USE_OVERLAYFS="yes"
    BROWSERS="google-chrome"
    $ systemctl --user enable psd.service
    $ systemctl --user start psd.service

In an attempt to stop psd from restoring old configurations, I have tried setting `BACKUP_LIMIT=1` and now `USE_BACKUPS=no`, but neither made any difference. The current status is:

    $ systemctl --user status psd

This fixes https://github.com/graysky2/profile-sync-daemon/issues/226. I successfully tested it (all other places seem to properly quote directory strings).

I'm still not fully satisfied with `common/browsers/firefox`. Maybe someone with more *bash* experience has an idea.

I didn't test any upgrade scripts though (and didn't use a version before).
The code assumes that profile paths do not contain whitespaces. There are 2 points where this fails:
* `common/browsers/firefox` will detect the segments as individual path due to use of `$(..)` while constructing `DIRArr`.
* The other place where this fails is `sed 's/ /\n/g'` at: https://github.com/graysky2/profile-sync-daemon/blob/d4ed380f9f3ed959879bbeaeb57bc4b6aab219e1/common/profile-sync-daemon.in#L381
