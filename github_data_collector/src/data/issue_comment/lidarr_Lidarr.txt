**Describe the bug**
I'm able to add video only releases to lidarr through manually searching. This causes problems with the edit dialog, which receives no release info from the API.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Manually search for a video only release. For example: https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/d762b65a-6a0c-372b-bc88-f0293cbe5894
2. Add it to lidarr.
3. Open the edit dialog,

**Expected behavior**
Lidarr should not be able to add video only releases.

**Screenshots**
See above.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I'm always frustrated when I try to add a new Torznab from Jackett and there is no audio releases having to add another category (usually films 2000) in the configuration.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Have another field for Torznab indexers where there is a test category.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Allow to save the Torznab indexer without checking the data, I know Jackett will pass the test anyway.

**Additional context**

Hello. I added some releases to musicbrainz website. When will they show up in lidarr?

I used a tampermonkey script I found that will let you add to musicbrainz from discogs...
https://github.com/murdos/musicbrainz-userscripts/blob/master/discogs_importer.user.js

I was wondering if this is something lidarr could potentially do for us? I see people asking for discogs support. What if lidarr checked for releases in discogs that are missing in musicbrainz, then did what that tampermonkey script does automatically? The script includes an option to check if the release already exists and an option to add. The way I would imagine it working from a client perspective is for us to enable the feature and add our musicbrainz credentials in lidarr. When artists are updated it checks for missing releases (discogs vs musicbrainz) and then adds any missing.

I have 2 librays, one for download and one for music, i have some unmapped track in libray 'music'

**Describe the solution you'd like**
in umapped view :
- add en checkbox for select all track
- add an option for delete track
- add an option for move track into another library

#### Database Migration
NO

#### Description
- Add Housekeeper to cleanup tracks that are now orphaned.
- Properly clean history on album and track deletion (If artist was deleted they would get cleaned, however if album was deleted separate or if track or album was deleted due to MB merge history events persisted for that ID).
- Convert Track events on Track Merge instead of orphaning them.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Sort of, but not really. The issue is keeping 2 or more instances of lidarr with the same artist lists

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Add a import list that would import artists from another available lidarr instance

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Manually keeping in sync (hand jam)

**Additional context**
This adds the ability to have multiple instances of lidarr that are in sync with the artists. The reason for this would allow  multiple instances of lidarr running for different purposes, ie:

Root Instance, only wants lossless media
2nd Instance, only wants lossy media


**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Yes, currently artist/album related links (urls) are not updated during the normal metadata syncs

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Update lidarr database with update related links during normal artist refreshes

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Wait 30 days for it to happen.

**Describe the bug**
A set of tracks by artists Queens of the Stone Age and Ben Folds Five are reported as deleted every time the "Refresh Artist" task is run.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Wait a day since the last run
2. View Activity | History
3. Scroll through "Track file deleted" entries
4. Select Artist or Album to confirm tracks exist in library
5. Open Windows Explorer and confirm tracks exist in folder

**Expected behavior**
For this not to report, and not to delete.

**Screenshots**

**Logs**
See screenshot.

**System info (please complete the following information):**
 - Lidarr Version: 0.7.1.1381
 - Operating System Windows Server 2016 Essentials
 - .net Framework 4.7.2

**Additional context**
Nothing comes to mind

**Describe the bug**
Using the settings tab in the GUI, I have set up lidarr to make audio files writeable (File chmod mode 0666). This works for audio files but sometimes a `cover.jpg` is created in the album folder with `660` permissions. This is frustrating because my regular user cannot read this file until I change its permissions with `sudo`.

**Expected behavior**
Lidarr should `chmod 666` every file it creates, including `cover.jpg`.

**System info (please complete the following information):**
 - Lidarr Version: 0.7.1.1381
 - Operating System: Debian Buster
 - mono Version: 6.6.0.161
Allow filter of file size on disk in the Mass Editor screen

I would like to remove empty artists and their folders, but there is not quick and easy way to do this. On the home screen, you CAN filter for the file size on disk and this is cool, but it's not for mass operations.
