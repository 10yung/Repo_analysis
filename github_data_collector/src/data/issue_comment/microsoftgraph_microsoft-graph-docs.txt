When I query the Outlook Tasks REST API v2 (from Microsoft To Do) as described in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/office-365-api/api/version-2.0/complex-types-for-mail-contacts-calendar#task, I always have AssignedTo empty, even though as per https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/office-365-api/api/version-2.0/complex-types-for-mail-contacts-calendar#task it should contain the name of the assigned person.

Sorry for posting the bug report here, but the Outlook Tasks API is not yet available under Microsoft Graph.

Please advise if this is a documentation or application issue, thanks!

Hello, I was reviewing your example and it indicated instantiating a new "Extension" class. Per the latest build of Microsoft.Graph.Beta, the extension class is protected internal and not able to be instantiated.

According to [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/graph/known-issues) page the `GetById `Endpoint currently works with $select because it does not return complete user objects:

> **Incomplete objects when using getByIds request**
> Requesting objects using Get directory objects from a list of IDs should return full objects. However, currently user objects on the v1.0 endpoint are returned with a limited set of properties. As a temporary workaround, when you use the operation in combination with the $select query option, more complete user objects will be returned. This behavior is not in accordance with the OData specifications. Because this behavior might be updated in the future, use this workaround only when you provide $select= with all the properties you are interested in, and only if future breaking changes to this workaround are acceptable.

Nearly all of the properties are returned but `mySite` is missing for some reason (even when using Graph Beta).

Are still not all properties supported yet or is this is bug?

If not supported please add it. Otherwise we currently have to go back making one call for each user we want to process. This would slow down performance from perfect to horrible again for this specific topic.

It seems that something wrong with migration from AAD graph to MS graph.
