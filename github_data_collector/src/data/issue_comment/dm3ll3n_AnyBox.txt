Is there a way to set a default sorting column for DataGrids? Currently even if I reference a presorted array it appears to unorder it.
Is there a way to change the order of prompt groups? It seems like by default they're sorted alphabetically, is there a way to specify how you'd like them ordered?

For example,
``` PowerShell
$Box.Prompts =
@(
    New-AnyBoxPrompt -Group "Z" -InputType Text -Message "test"
    New-AnyBoxPrompt -Group "A" -InputType Text -Message "test"
)
```

Group "A" will show above group "Z" even though it's written afterwards.
After updating to the latest version, I seem to have lost the scroll bar, making very long prompts un-usable. Attempted to use the `-ResizeMode` property but this just gave me a lot white space on the right. Any way to get the scroll bar back, or alternatively any way to format the window into two columns of prompts? 
When using the GridData is there a way to have expose a double click instead of having to select a item/row then click ok or another button? 


As for the copy I am using the "New-AnyBoxButton -Template 'CopyMessage'" command with gridData and I select an entry/row and select copy and a prompt display that "There is no message to copy."  Am I trying to use the template in a manner that it was not intended for?
--  I am wanting to copy the selection to clipboard.  If more then one property is selected include the property title in the copy.  I understand this may be difficult to perform.

Thanks for the updates
