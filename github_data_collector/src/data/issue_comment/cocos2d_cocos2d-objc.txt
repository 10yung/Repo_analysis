That example still works except of this code:

```
// Draw the triangle fan
    CC_NODE_DRAW_SETUP();
    ccGLBlendFunc(self.blendFunc.src, self.blendFunc.dst);
    ccGLBindTexture2D(self.texture.name);
    ccGLEnableVertexAttribs( kCCVertexAttribFlag_PosColorTex );
    glVertexAttribPointer(kCCVertexAttrib_Position, 2, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, vertices);
    glVertexAttribPointer(kCCVertexAttrib_TexCoords, 2, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, texCoords);
    glVertexAttribPointer(kCCVertexAttrib_Color, 4, GL_FLOAT, GL_TRUE, 0, colors);
    glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLE_FAN, 0, (GLsizei)nVertices);
```

How to replace it in current cocos2d version?
Is the site and forum no longer supported?
Hi , guys.
  I have just meet a  problem about 'EXC_BAD_ACCESS'.  The 'CCDirector.shared().startAnimation()' method is used  to  start a animation of scene.
  First, I push to next ViewController, I add a scene on a subview, It's normal.
  then, I pop to last ViewController.
  Next, I push to next ViewController again, I get a crash error.

Here is my judge method.

 It is my demo link. [https://github.com/sandart/SpineDemo.git](url)
 I don't know how to solve this problem, I need your help. 
Thanks a lot.


in Xcode 9.3

-(id)objectForKey:(id<NSCopying>)options
{
id src = options[CCBlendFuncSrcColor] ?: @(GL_ONE); 

CCBlendFuncSrcAlpha: (options[CCBlendFuncSrcAlpha] ?: src),

Expected method to read dictionary element not found on object of type 'id<NSCopying>'
Is there any complete documentations?

Here 'blendMode' is nil!
Is there any way to get ripple effect on image in Objective C ios Application. I am using cocos2d-objc framework for ios application.

UIImage *spriteNumber = [UIImage imageNamed:@"congrats.png"];
    CCSpriteGrid *grid = [[CCSpriteGrid alloc] initWithTexture:[[CCTexture alloc] initWithCGImage:spriteNumber.CGImage contentScale:spriteNumber.scale]];
    grid.position = (CGPoint){0.5, 0.25};
    grid.positionType = CCPositionTypeNormalized;
    [grid setGridWidth:100 andHeight:50];
    [self addChild:grid];
Recently upgraded my project from 3.1 to 3.5. CCDirectorIOS has a call to 'drawScene' in 'mainLoop'

, but this seems to crash the application.

I am migrating my code to v3. CCGLProgram is renamed to CCShader, but I can't see the counterpart to this:

```
[[CCGLProgram alloc] initWithVertexShaderFilename:@"default.vsh" fragmentShaderFilename:@"vBlur.fsh"];
```

There is only one constructor `[CCShader shaderNamed: ""]` but it cannot specify the different names for vertex shader / fragment shader. There is `[CCShader alloc] initWithVertex..Shader..` but it only accepts shader codes, which are not cached.

... as well as Cocos2D-Objc.  Also added an Objective-C++ test to cocos2d-tests; one involving a basic node hierarchy, the next involving a slightly more dicey manual visiting of a node with proper transforms, without necessarily adding it as a child of another node, using CCRenderer_Private.h.

This patch does _not necessarily_ allow you to compile cocos2d in Objective-C++ mode.  It only ensures that you can use Objective-C++ in your project along with Cocos2D-Objc.

The Objective-C++ fix within CCRenderer_Private.h was suggested by @slembcke here: http://forum.spritebuilder.com/t/cocos3d-c-mm-files-compiler-issue/15570/4
