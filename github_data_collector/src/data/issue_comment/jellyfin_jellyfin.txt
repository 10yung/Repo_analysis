Allow for native building of Docker images. Use buildx if cross-compilation is needed.

For some reason paths not mapped on that endpoint, but it will be nice to have for enabling native paths in [jellyfin-mpv-shim](https://github.com/iwalton3/jellyfin-mpv-shim).

Do-over of #1431 (click for old discussion)

**Changes**
For now it adds a project with an [Entity Framework Visual Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=michaelsawczyn.EFDesigner) based entity model. Note this only contains some of the media types and some of the fields, those are easy to add later.

My main philosophy for this is to keep the database structure as restrictive as possible, as this forces good "data-hygiene" as it were. So no JSON blobs, no generic tables that are key-value stores (if we want that we should use Redis or something) etc.

TODO LIST:
- [ ]  Add user related permissions and preference from existing database schema (so far, only xml based ones have been added)
- [ ]  Add user linked tracking of watch status and resume points for media in a media agnostic way (aka, allow for resuming audiobooks and comics as well as movies and tv shows)
- [ ] Implement storage of system wide settings. Avoid "node" specific settings like bound IP, ports, hw accel, etc while migrating settings like default UI culture, metadata language, etc
- [ ] Implement storage of multiple languages for metadata (including images). This would allow admins to define server wide fetch languages allowing for better internationalization support. The admin could say they want 3 languages and then users can decide which order they want these languages to be when displaying metadata.
- [ ] Implement user definable fallback that can have multiple steps for UI and metadata language. Currently, US English is the only fallback if you chose a language other than it. Ideally, users should be able to fall back through a list of languages of their choosing (with US English being the final fallback as it is now)
- [ ] Implement a generic grouping and collections system that will allow users and admins to group media in arbitrary ways. As an example, you could group Futurama into 3 parts, pre-movies, movies, and post movies then group these together such that if you watch the last episode of pre-movies "up next" appears shows the first movie. But... Ordering must not be required. Maybe a user just wants to group the 300 Scooby-Doo movies into one "folder." This should effectively take over the role of playlists since it serves the same purpose but is more flexible
**Describe the bug**
Jellyfin newest version, play back at chrome v79.0.3945.117 , windows 10 1909, nvidia 1080 graphics card. using hardware transcode @ VAAPI. x264 source works fine, but x265 10bit source will have a greenbar like this.
firefox / andorid client works fine. this must be a chrome issue.

**To Reproduce**
try play back on chrome as described above.

**Expected behavior**
no green bar.
