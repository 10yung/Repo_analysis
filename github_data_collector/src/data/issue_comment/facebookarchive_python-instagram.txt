It is recommended not to store sensitive data in the code itself, but keep it separate.

I corrected some grammar mistakes in the code,clean up some whitespace,editing documents,create a specification file and edit some comments.Thank you and I trying my best to do these.
Fixes #259 
â€¦ent_id

Problem: It was not receiving access_token while exchanging code.
Error: You must provide a client_id

Solution:
File: oauth2.py
Function: exchange_for_access_token
        +headers = {'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}
        +response, content = http_object.request(url,headers=headers,method="POST", body=data)
-response, content = http_object.request(url,method="POST", body=data)


There is an error while accessing data 'key' which is not present in entry['comments']
There is an error getting no comment on the request, as it does an iteration of a null value.
An empty list is added if the request is null, so it can iterate over something empty and not over a null value
