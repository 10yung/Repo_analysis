Add an option to confirm reblogs.
Initially I wanted to put it much further the pipeline but to get animations work right I had to work around `SparkButton` a little bit. The advantage is that it's implemented in just one place now.

It tries to mimick Masto UI but not very closely.

I tried to fix it but not like proposed in #1618 because it would require additional layouts so I tried to just fit the Image.
The only problem is notifications screen where we have this damn bar. We need to offset top correctly and we need to fix the bar height for that but idk how it would work with text scaling.

Sometimes I use this app with my bluetooth keyboard. When I toot by Ctrl+Enter,
tusky sends the same two activities and these have different IDs.
On the toot linked in that pull request, it also posted twice apparently.
When I post via web browser, the number of the toots is one.

- [x] I searched or browsed the repo’s other issues to ensure this is not a duplicate.

Steps to reproduce: Enable "Don't keep activities" in the developer settings and bring the main activity in the background and foreground again (or recreate it in an other way). Jumping to the top by clicking the selected tab will no longer work.


When the device is offline and the user clicks on a profile, the "Mute" option in the options menu is a bit broken ("Mute %s" and "Are you sure you want to block all of null?").

Easy to reproduce: start composing a toot, upload an image, delete it and then compose it again. After that, "hide media" button will overlap the CW button as show below:

Not critical, since you can just press that "mixed" button and it will fix itself, but still a bug.

Because on the profile screen there is the tabs bar, in landscape the button is flattened and almost unreadable, at least with my screen size:

To reproduce, just put your telephone in landscape, disable network/enable airplane mode, and try to open your profile or somebody else’s, and scroll to the bottom.

I think the error message should make a better use of the available horizontal space (mockup):

This is a teaser for my proposal: to not use XMLs for settings but use Kotlin's expressiveness to add a tiny DSL.
My main motivation is that we use damn strings around the project to get/update preference. I think later we should add a higher-level well-typed prefs abstraction but this is kinda different story and it would still have duplication with XML if we left it.
Another benefit is that we don't need to do clumsy "find the pref and update it" dance.

If you are wondering if there is a project which does that already than yes, there is one but it replaces androidx.preference completely. It's a much bigger library with kinda different purpose and the DSL is like 30 lines or so.

Let me know what you think about it!
