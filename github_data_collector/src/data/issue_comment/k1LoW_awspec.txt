Hey,

I'm using this like so:

```
    describe route_table(myroutetable) do
      it { should exist }
      it { should have_route('0.0.0.0/0').target(nat: mynat) }
    end
```

This works on the first run, however if I run my tests again it fails because there are two matching NAT gateways - one deleted and one available. If I wait ~30mins until AWS purges the deleted NAT from the results, my tests pass again.

How can I work around this so that it only matches a NAT if it hasn't been deleted? I could lookup the nat ID and use it but I'd rather avoid that extra step if possible.

Thanks,
Darryl
This tries to reduce the gem dependencies to only what is being used.
Replaced ssm parameters describe API call with get_parameter call to fix pagination issue.

Fixed specs and changed a bit behavior of the spec for ssm. It has a few values less now because of the differences in APIs. However, it also has value now. So we can test against it if it is not encrypted.
Similar to below case,
describe lambda('my-lambda-function-name') do
  it { should exist }
end
I would like to know if it supports a test case say describe layer(;my-lambda-layer-name') do...
Make the eip entry in the type reference table functional by changing the anchor to eip
When using the ecs_service resource described here https://github.com/k1LoW/awspec/blob/master/doc/_resource_types/ecs_service.md, when the cluster is not default it will fail.

e.g. 

```
describe ecs_service('my-ecs-service') do
  it { should exist }
end
```
fails with

```
Aws::ECS::Errors::ClusterNotFoundException:
       Cluster not found.
```

Where the cluster is not default you need to pass the cluster name e.g. for cluster named 'non-default':

describe ecs_service('my-ecs-service'), cluster: 'not-default' do
  it { should exist }
end

Could the docs in the link be updated accordingly.
At the moment there is no spec support for AWS Transit Gateway so those cannot be verified. It would be nice if support was added for it.

AWS Reference doc: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/EC2/Types/TransitGateway.html
Based on the output of `aws s3api get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration`, it looks to me like this documentation needs to be updated to match that output object:

```

    "Rules": [
        {
            "Status": "Enabled",
            "NoncurrentVersionExpiration": {
                "NoncurrentDays": 7
            },
            "Filter": {
                "Prefix": "data/"
            },
            "Expiration": {
                "Days": 7
            },
            "AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload": {

            },
            "ID": "ExpireData7Days"
        }
    ]

At the moment there is no spec support for Route 53 Resolver so those cannot be verified. It would be nice if support was added for it.

I am trying to write a spec for DynamoDB table with multiple global secondary indexes. I'm unable to get the value of any index except the first and last one using the 'first' and 'last' methods.

describe dynamodb_table('Group_Resource') do
  it { should exist }
  its ('global_secondary_indexes.first.index_name') { should eq 'Resource_ID-index' }
end

How can I fetch the second and third values of the array global_secondary_indexes? I've tried using global_secondary_indexes.fetch(2), global_secondary_indexes[2] but both give errors.
