I am interested in this project but seems is not maintained anymore. Did you find a better way to transform from ipython to .rmd  (and ultimately to bookdown in my specific scenario)?

This is just what I need but can't seem to get it to run.   Are there additional steps when installing ipyrmd for windows users?

ipyrmd  successfully installed via pip but is not recognized as a command after that.  Other programs on my pip list (e.g. runipy) do run from command line.  Any ideas?  thanks.

I'm on Windows 10 running python 3.6 (via Anaconda).
