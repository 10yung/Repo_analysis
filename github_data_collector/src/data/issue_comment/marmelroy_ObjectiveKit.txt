I was wondering if you would get rejected by the App Store for using this in an app.
Hi,
Interesting component for NSObject class ðŸ™‚
With [TProperties](https://github.com/TofPlay/TProperties) I did something similar but for pure classes Swift ðŸ˜‰
The code was created for the sole purpose of showing my students, that they should think on their own instead of following thought leaders and popular bloggers, as they, while being popular, still are human and sometimes don't write that great or just plain bad and dirty code. The code prior to the pull request is a perfect example of such code because of the excess amount of duplication.

The secondary aim of refactoring was to show my students, how to use some unobvious ways of handling functions in swift, when using unsafe force-cast related code.

I've created this pull request just to check, how hacktoberfest (I really want that t-shirt, yay) reacts to rejected or ignored pull requests, as original maintainer, from what it looks, ignores pull requests from other users.

P.S. I doubt the maintainer would merge the pull request, so I didn't update to Swift 4. If accept happens for some weird reason, I would refactor it to swift 4 with pleasure.

Refactor to avoid nesting by using guard + by removing some unnecessary `{}`
