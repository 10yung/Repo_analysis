The current interface is GitHub's directory listing which is alphabetically sorted by file name.  Probably we should add a `tutorials/README.md` that has a brief description of each notebook and suggested dependency order.
I have some questions after Gen's usage after reading the tutorials.

Where can I ask for help? Is there a forum or mailing list?

I don't see any links to community support at Gen's [website](https://probcomp.github.io/Gen/tutorials.html).
