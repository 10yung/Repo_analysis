Adding new China Tencent QQ provider
Wiki(Chinese): https://wiki.open.qq.com

Dear Sir/Madam,

$adapter = $hybridauth->getAdapter($provider);
$userProfile = $adapter->getUserProfile();
$accessToken = $adapter->getAccessToken();

I can only get the identifier and photoURL from the $userProfile but all others are empty. What is the issue why I can't get other information? I tried with two google account but the same result. 

Best regards,

Kelvin

| Minor: New Feature?      | Adds a provider for logging in with Slack

Adds a new provider for logging in with https://slack.com/.

In order to use it, a [Slack app](https://api.slack.com/docs/sign-in-with-slack) with the permission scopes `identity.basic`, `identity.email` and `identity.avatar` needs to be created. It is not necessary to add the app to a workspace (in fact it is not even possible if the app has only the `identity.*` scopes).

### Reproduction

Use this link to reproduce this error:
https://www.blognow.org/auth/auth2


Here is the code I am using

```

<?php
//Include Hybridauth's basic autoloader
include APPPATH.'libraries/hybridauth/src/autoload.php';

//Import Hybridauth's namespace
use Hybridauth\Hybridauth; 
use Hybridauth\Exception\Exception;

use Hybridauth\Storage\Session;
//And so on

class Auth extends CI_Controller{
	 
	public function __construct(){
		parent:: __construct();
		$this->load->helper('form');
		$this->load->library('form_validation'); 
	}
	  
	public function auth2(){
		
		//First step is to build a configuration array to pass to `Hybridauth\Hybridauth`

## Bug, feature or question?

Request for docs update

### Version and provider

3.x

### Reproduction

Previously I used \Hybrid_Endpoint::process() in the method that is calling when user authenticates. Now I haven't such method in v3 and any info about this in upgrade manuals.

While testing on localhost it is working but on development server it is not.
I am using atticmedia/anvard package in Laravel 4.2 for social login.  It shows ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS error.

Hibridauth version 2.x and LinkedIn, Google


This is a question.

Background: I have hundreds of domains all running the same product, too many to whitelist them all through facebook or google. What I'd like to do is set the callback for all of them to a common login relay server. In order to do that, I need a generic way to pass state through the authentication flow, so I can tell the login relay server what site they're trying to log in to.

Is this possible?

Alternatively, I could call the relay server first and create a mapping from something (like the state variable) to a login target. Then when the relay callback gets called, I could look up the real site and forward the browser there.

Any input most welcome!
## Bug, feature or question?

when I swap out curl for guzzle and the user signs into Facebook the user profile will not return the email even though the email permission is granted by the user. This does not happen with the curl set up nor for google on the guzzle set up.

### Version and provider

v 3.0


## Bug, feature or question?

BUG
Registering multiple adapters in the settings, including "debug_mode" and "debug_file" and then calling `->authenticate($adaptar)` won't create the logger.

This is due to calling [getProviderConfig(<adaptar>)](https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth/blob/4cb541daf091ee51fba7b7402d0302f09978cc85/src/Hybridauth.php#L119) which will only add adapter config and callback url. (that means any other setting like debug_mode, curl_options, etc. is ignored)

(this behavior is especially confusing because it worked just fine in v2)

### Version and provider

v3
mutliple providers in a settings file

### Reproduction

Create hybridauth without any logger `$hauth = new Hybridauth\Hybridauth($config);`
Use `$hauth->authenticate($provider);` and notice that no log file is created, etc.

### Possible solution

- getProviderConfig needs to be improved to include other "global" settings like "debug_mode" as well.
- or document the issue that the user needs to create the logger instance himself.
- technically documentation could also state that with multiple providers each provider has it's own debug and curl options

My workaround atm is to simply create the logger based on the config myself.
