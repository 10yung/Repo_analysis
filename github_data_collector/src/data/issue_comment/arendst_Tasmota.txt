## Description:

Most drivers do not expect address blocking after calling i2cSetDevice.
I2cSetActive removed from I2cSetDevice. All drivers waiting for this call are fixed.

**Related issue (if applicable):** #7556

## Checklist:
  - [x] The pull request is done against the latest dev branch
  - [x] Only relevant files were touched
  - [x] Only one feature/fix was added per PR.
  - [ ] The code change is tested and works on core 2.6.1
  - [x] The code change pass travis tests. **Your PR cannot be merged unless tests pass**
  - [x] I accept the [CLA](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-license-agreement-cla).

### PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Behavior in different i2s drivers implies different.

Some device implies:
* Check that the device responds in the bus (by I2cSetDevice), and then make checks to uniquely identify the device. Then do I2CSetActive (if success). One does not imply that I2cSetActive is done automatically.

Drivers: xdrv_28_pcf8574, xdsp_02_ssd1306, xdsp_03_matrix.ino, xdsp_07_sh1106, xnrg_07_ade7953, xsns_16_tsl2561, xsns_32_mpu6050, xsns_57_tsl2591, xsns_59_ds1624,
xsns_44_sps30, xsns_45_vl53l0x, xsns_46_MLX90614

* If device responds in the bus by I2cSetDevice, drivers imply that I2cSetActive is done automatically.

Drivers: xdrv_10_scripter, xdsp_01_lcd, xdsp_08_ILI9488, xdsp_10_RA8876, 

I think need remove I2cSetActive from function I2cSetDevice in the support.ino and fix all drivers,
which have mean automatic I2cSetActive.

I can fix it myself, but I think it's better for the author to do it. But I can do PR if you want.

### PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
It seems that the rule trigger System#Boot is no longer executed since I upgraded my Shelly to Tasmota 8.1. On another device that is still on Tasmota 6.6. the same rule is working as expected.

On Tasmota 6.6 this returns `{"Var1":"0"}` as expected. But on Tasmota 8.1. it returns `{"Var1":""}`. Also 6.6. prints the message `RUL: SYSTEM#BOOT performs "Backlog Var1 0; Var2 0"` on the web console but on 8.1 there is no such message.

### PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
On certain peripherals (in my case SDS011), the metric name contains a period. With the home-assistant auto discovery, this ends up with invalid json as the template: `,"val_tpl":"{{value_json['SDS0X1'].PM2.5}}"` (can't have a dot in the value name, because that is the separator)

The problem is, I think here: https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/blob/bacc9e4899c9eb2527d6e146b7d6496b22091418/tasmota/xdrv_12_home_assistant.ino#L142

### Proposed fix
Having this set to `",\"val_tpl\":\"{{value_json['%s']['%s']}}\"";`  instead seems to fix the problem.

### PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

I have been trying to get a tcrt5000 to work as a reader for the rotating disk on the household power meter.  This has returns a high signal while most of the disk is rotating, and every time the red marked spot passes under the sensor it goes low.
Problem: for every pulse that the sensor sends, I get the counter incrementing by two.
Setup:
D4 / GPIO2 is configured as a `Counter1`
Counter relevant commands set:
```
Backlog CounterDebounce 100; CounterType 0; Counter1 0
```
I was wondering if this might be an issue with the TCRT5000 module, so I set up a simple push-button on a breadboard, and I can get the same effect with this as well.
BUT
With the manual button I can click significantly faster than the dial on the power meter passes (but less than the 100ms debounce time) - if I click very fast, I get the correct single increment of the counter, but if I click slowly, holding the button for (I guess) more than half a second I get two counts.
It feels to me as if counter works, as long as the pulses are very short, but not if they are a bit slower...
