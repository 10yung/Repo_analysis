Just tested with Octave 4.2.2 and the scripts to create `.tsv` in the matlab code folder do not work because the table function is something different in Octave.

Might be good to improve that, no?

related to #112 
The /matlabCode/ snippet directory is becoming a little bit unorganized, is it ok to reorganize according to modality? Folders per modality would include:
/ieeg
/eeg
/func
/anat
/general
/other
Am playing catch up with the BIDS derivatives RC1 trying to wrap my head around it to structure some of my data.

Realizing that I am about to write a pretty much write a matlab scripts / functions for that, would it make sense if I put it in this repo too?
Addition of images describing the relation to source data / raw data / derivatives: see issue #105 

I had made this figure to add it to the BIDS specs. But before I make a pull request there I was thinking that we could work on it / add it to the starter kit and then make a PR to the specs.

What do you think?

BTW: Is there a good way to version control figure making? git-annex?

Hi @Park-Patrick @dorahermes @emdupre - and anyone else who is following the development!

I think the sidebar in the wiki contains too many links - it's scrolling off the bottom of the screen and isn't really as useful as you'd hope it to be.

Here's a list of what's on it right now:

Note that I've done a little re-formatting (taken out header formatting and just made links bold) to make it take up a little less space, but I'd like to propose that we shorten this list to:

I've also updated the [wiki home page](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/wiki) to point to the pages dropdown menu that shows **all** the pages so maybe they're easier to find that way?

What do you all think?
BIDS Tutorial Series > Part 1a: Introductory Walkthrough prompts to download DICOMs from the  [Nathan Kline Institute (NKI) Rockland Sample â€“ Multiband Imaging Test-Retest Pilot Dataset.](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/pro/eNKI_RS_TRT/FrontPage.html)
For me is not possible to do the download and I get this error: 
<img width="1005" alt="nitrc_error" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22478219/45544974-28066100-b819-11e8-86ff-b2342c8917e5.png">

I was wondering if this is a general issue, then would be great if it is fixed.
Thanks!

I was just wondering what the type of data should go in Dataset Examples: should Raw (Non-BIDS) data be in there? The term raw is a bit confusing since BIDS is meant for raw data.

@Park-Patrick @KirstieJane  


I don't know what type of file the [Graphical Representation of BIDS](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xlfeAFpp8iOH12bXONfD9OsRGLFFSLD-) (Brainhack NYC 2018, NY USA - N Markowitz (2018)) should be. (It's part of the [community resources](https://github.com/INCF/BIDS-Starter-Kit/wiki/community-resources) in the wiki). When I download the file it doesn't have a suffix and I don't know what programme to open it in!
The main landing page for anyone searching for information about BIDS is http://bids.neuroimaging.io.

@Park-Patrick has done great work updating the BIDS Starter Kit README with lots of useful information about the background and motivations for BIDS, and this information could also be brought over to the main website (http://bids.neuroimaging.io) (as suggested by @chrisfilo in our discussions in #70).

The pull request would have to go to https://github.com/INCF/BIDS rather than to this repository, but I thought having the discussion of what to transfer over might make sense.

Any thoughts on what should be included on the main website?
