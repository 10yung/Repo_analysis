There are multiple objects that has Jail defined but can't be loaded in
a sane way. This patch adds load_* macros for all such objects. It also
extracts loaders from base macros to separate file. Load macros are
defined dynamically to avoid repetition of definition and to unify
capabilities of all such macros.

See Redmine issue for error seen in installer. This is how I was able to reproduce this issue reliably.

 1. Spin up katello nightly: `vagrant up centos7-katello-nightly`
 2. Open two separate terminals via SSH into nightly box: `vagrant ssh centos7-katello-nightly`
 3. In Terminal 1, delete all roles:

```
[root@dynflow vagrant]# foreman-rake console
Tasks Manager
Tasks Reader
Register hosts
Loading production environment (Rails 5.2.1)
irb(main):001:0> Role.all.each { |role| role.destroy }
=> [#<Role id: 1, name: "Default role", builtin: 2, description: "Role that is automatically assigned to every user ...", origin: nil, cloned_from_id: nil>, #<Role id: 39, name: "Tasks Manager", builtin: 0, description: "", origin: "foreman-tasks", cloned_from_id: nil>, #<Role id: 40, name: "Tasks Reader", builtin: 0, description: "", origin: "foreman-tasks", cloned_from_id: nil>, #<Role id: 41, name: "Register hosts", builtin: 0, description: "", origin: "katello", cloned_from_id: nil>]
irb(main):002:0> exit
```

4. A command will need to be run in each terminal nearly simultaneously. In Terminal 1, queue up `foreman-rake apipie:cache:index`. In Terminal 2, queue up `foreman-rake db:seed`.

5. Now, press enter on Terminal 1 then immediately press Enter in Terminal 2. You should see the failure without this patch applied in Terminal 2.

Rinse and repeat to reproduce the issue (deleting the Roles each time) or to test the patch.

StatisticsChartsList has a simple reducer that can be replaced by the main API reducer
blocked by: https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/pull/7359
In report templates if you try to maximize the editor it only shows you its title and not its textarea, now it shows you the full modal that includes both
The code editor and preview were the same "TextBox" that only had different value in it, now they are 2 different text boxes that will "save" the scroll info per box.
The scroll info is not saved for the maximized version (The editor/preview modal) 
The selected value for the editors diff view was sent translated which didn't have any effect.
