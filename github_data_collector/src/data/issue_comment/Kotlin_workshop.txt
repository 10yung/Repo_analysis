Currently, the implementation of the `max` and `max2` functions return the smallest Int. This of course should be the largest.
The compiler would warn

> 'typealias BasicCustomer = BaseCustomer' uses 'BaseCustomer', which is deprecated. BasicCustomer is now called BaseCustomer

But `BaseCustomer` is not deprecated. After the change, the warning is:

> 'typealias BasicCustomer = BaseCustomer' is deprecated. BasicCustomer is now called BaseCustomer
Please forgive the provocative and overly broad title. ;)

Opening the very first examples in IDEA, we immediately get suggestions. For instance:

![2018-01-04_01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4246780/34563931-f1db09a4-f154-11e7-96b8-7cf9c3b9fffb.png)

And you see the grey wrigglies indicating that IDEA thinks we should use `isNotEmpty()`.

If this is not a conscious decision, maybe the examples should exhibit best practice as far as possible?
We've decided to translate the workshop material to Hungarian language. I have some questions regarding this:

- Do you have any recommendations how a translation should be done?
- If yes can you tell us how should we structure the files in the repository so we can contribute our translation to the original repository?
