Hi, I'm using decoupled Entity and security user like it's described here https://stovepipe.systems/post/decoupling-your-security-user

The reason for that is that I want to keep domain separated following DDD principles.

Now my entity looks like:
```
class Batch {
// ....
    /**
     * @var Employee
     *
     * @Gedmo\Blameable(on="create")
     * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="Employee")
     */
    private $createdBy;
//...
```

while class 'App\\Security\\User\\SecurityUser' implements actual UserInterface.

When I try to save the entity, it produces an error:
```
The class 'App\\Security\\User\\SecurityUser' was not found in the chain configured namespaces App\\Entity
```

Which is because of this line of code:
```
        if (null !== $token && $this->authorizationChecker->isGranted('IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED')) {
            $this->blameableListener->setUserValue($token->getUser());
        }
```

`$token->getUser()` returns an object of class `App\\Security\\User\\SecurityUser` not the Entity. Is it possible to override this behavior introducing a configuration option?
Today I enabled the tree extension into Symfony 4 app which is using Oracle as backend and i had some trouble when i'm saving/fetching the tree node's. The generated queries with the nested tree repository contains the root column equality comparison like Integer or string values **[root = null]**, which is not working. Here we need to change this equality comparison with **IS [NOT] NULL** expression.
Can you tell me how long it will take to be compatable with symfony 5?
This extension not work with Symfony 5 version.

My problem is the following:

I have a entity called Products with a unique name and slug field but i need the slug in the prePersist event for a API request wath determine if the product is flushed or not.

I know the urlizer or transliterate but this not works to me because i need the complete slug, checking if a slug, for example "product" exist and give me "product-1" for the API request.

Thank you

When i add 

    admin.page:
        class: App\Admin\PageAdmin
        arguments: [~, App\Entity\Page, ~]
        tags:
            - { name: sonata.admin, manager_type: orm, label: Page }

in services.yaml,

i have a problem after type command bin/console cache:clear :
The service "sonata_translation.admin.extension.gedmo_translatable" has a dependency on a non-existent service "stof_doctrine_extensions.listener.translatable".

Why ??
