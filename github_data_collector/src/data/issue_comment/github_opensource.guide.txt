Hi! I want to add russian translation. Of course I haven't translated all articles, but I tried to add full request with some parts of work. And faced problems. 
I wanted just make pull request for people know that somebody almost begun to do that work. Is it right? Can I open  pull request just for mark a start of work? 

I followed this [instruction for translators](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/blob/master/docs/translations.md). 
I tried `test` in different ways: `npm run test`, `npm run script/test`, `npm test` and with sudo. 
But in any cases I faced errors. Like this one, and some others:

I also tried to build the site in different ways, and I also faced errors. 

Please, complete the [instruction for translators](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/blob/master/docs/translations.md) with additional info, about what to do before tests, how to create bundle, how to build a site etc.

How about we collect some advice in [docs/translations.md](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/blob/7b5aebc02a71b1f9f62873757a0643c0668612bd/docs/translations.md) under `Keeping translations up to date` or similar?

Working on #1118 I naively scrolled through the [commit list](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/commits/master) and looked at merge commits that seemed to add content. Would `git diff $translation_branch master _articles/*.md` or similar be better?
https://opensource.guide/legal/

It is not clear to me **how** i should practically note the copyright of a code part (for example 5 lines from a MIT project). Is it legally OK to just note the source, author and license in the commit message description or should it be in the header of the file or in the LICENSE file of the project?

When i copy whole files, the license header should not be removed. This is logical. But how to note that i made changes? Is it OK to just have them in git? How do i add myself to the copyright header as author?

This PR is an on-going effort to improve and fix the Korean translation.
The articles in Korean have many typos and mistranslations.
This is my first PR, I hope this helps the project and future readers.

- `you`는 기본적으로 `여러분`으로 번역하고 어색한 경우 `당신`으로 했습니다.
- `open source`는 기존 번역문에 따라 `오픈소스`로 붙여 썼습니다.
- `GitHub`, `Stack Overflow`, `Middleman` 등은 영어 그대로 썼습니다.
- `pull request`는 `풀 리퀘스트`로 옮겼습니다.
- 원문을 따라 기본적으로 h2는 '~하기', h3는 '~하세요' 형식으로 옮겼습니다.
- 인용구는 아직 전부 번역되지 않았습니다.
