## Bug Report

#### Steps to reproduce

set 'gfm' attribute to true and make a header link that has a hyphen('-') in it.  

#### What is current behaviour

I have to write in this way

```md
# link to  'part1 - my title'   
[my header link](part1-my-title)
```

#### What is the expected behaviour

but when I make header link in github, I have to write in this way.

```md
# link to  'part1 - my title'   
[my header link](part1---my-title)
```

I think link text should be same as github because I set gfm mode to true.

[I reported a issue to markedjs first.](https://github.com/markedjs/marked/issues/1579)

they said new release of docsify could fix this issue.

markedjs was updated in version 4.10.2 but nothing changed. 

so I think it is docsify's issue.

## Feature request

Let's remove globals. Does `_paq` need to be a global?

#### What problem does this feature solve?

Cleaner more robust code.

#### What does the proposed API look like?

no globals

#### How should this be implemented in your opinion?

move things off global and share the variables only the scopes where needed.

#### Are you willing to work on this yourself?

As with everything, when/if I get the time.


## Feature request

It'd be great for all markdown features of pages to also work in the sidebar too. For example, suppose we want to use https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/docsify-tabs to put tabs in the sidebar, or something.

#### What problem does this feature solve?

Makes the site more customizable.

#### What does the proposed API look like?

From an end user perspective, they just write markdown, and it would work like it does in a page.

#### How should this be implemented in your opinion?

Not sure yet.

#### Are you willing to work on this yourself?

Yes, when I can find the time.
