I have a localhost website running, I have all the settings set up, all the UI elements finished.
Now I'm asking myself why not style the titlebar elements, right?

But no.

As I've read the documentation at https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_window#type-FrameOptions

These frameOptions can only be used on packed applications/extensions If I'm not mistaken.

I want something achievable like on https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/tree/master/samples/frameless-window#screenshot like this:

But using web manifest.

Use a simple property like:

```
{
   "frame": "none"
}

```

This would bring even more desktop feel to the progressive web app.
My extension is receiving INVALID_RESPONSE_ERROR within authorized regions (ex: US and Canada), and I'm not sure what else this error could mean. Can anyone explain what else might be causing this error?
Create nodes.yml is the description.
For using this extension every time i need to go to web store to launch it. Is there any shortcut to launch this extension.  
I need an extension or plugin that recognizes text for example -10.35 and sends an alert in the form of popup or something that makes noise


Hi,

I'm getting a "Backend Error" when calling requestStart at one-time-payment sample (user license API => https://www.googleapis.com/chromewebstore/v1.1/userlicenses/...):

error:
  code: 500
  errors: Array(1)
    0: {domain: "global", reason: "backendError", message: "Backend Error"}
    length: 1
    __proto__: Array(0)
  message: "Backend Error"
...

Any clue?

Thank you
