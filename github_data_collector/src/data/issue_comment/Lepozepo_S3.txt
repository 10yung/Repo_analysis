And now i need to upload image on aws. To upload image on aws i am using lepozepo:s3 package but it returns error http://prntscr.com/olfi5j . This is my code i write in app\server\server.js file

 Router.route('/api/uploadimg/', { where: 'server' })
.post(function () {

    let response;
 	var files = this.request.filenames;
	console.log(this.request.filenames);
	
	import {S3} from "meteor/lepozepo:s3";
   
    S3.upload({ 
        files:files,
        path:"avatars"
      },function(e,r){
        if (!e) {
          var $set={};
          $set[templ.data.picType]=r.secure_url;
          Meteor.users.update({
            _id: userId
          }, {
            $set: $set
          }, function(err) {
            if (!err) {
              console.log( "Image uploaded");
            } else {
              console.log("Error updating image");
            }
          });
        } else {
          console.log( "Error updating image");
        }
    });
	
	response = {
            "errorCode": false,
            "statusMessage": "Picture uploaded successfully",
			data: files
          }
    this.response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'multipart/form-data');
    this.response.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', '*');
    this.response.end(JSON.stringify(response));

I run the following command after uploading a image successfully and it returns true however it does not delete the image from Amazon s3 I have seen this issue a couple times but none of them had a answer, wondering if this has been fixed.

This is the function I run

```
S3.delete(delete_url, function(e,r) {
      console.log(e);
      console.log(r);
      console.log(delete_url);
    });
```

UPDATE: I just read it only accepts certain regions I have chosen "ca-central-1" as my region could this be why delete isn't working but upload is?
Hello,
   I am doing bulk upload of images approximately 250. But some files are failed. Giving following error at console:
POST https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/auto-pilot 400 (Bad Request)

My html template:
```
<template name="s3_tester">

	<input type="file" class="file_bag imgBrowse" multiple>
	{{#each files}}
		<p>{{percent_uploaded}}</p>
	 {{/each}}

</template>
```


This is my event on which I am uploading 250 images:

```
Template.s3_tester.events({

"change .imgBrowse": function(){
    event.preventDefault();
    var filesupload = event.target.files;
      S3.upload({
          files:filesupload,
          path:"products",
        },function(e,r){
          if(e){
            console.log(e);
          }else{
            console.log(r);
          }    
      });
  },

});
```

Any Suggestion. Thanks in Advance!

Hi There,

I'm not sure how to fix the issue we encountered using this package. We got 403 response but all credentials are correct. On console log, upon checking the S3 used the URL format as 

`post_url = "https://s3-" + ops.region + ".amazonaws.com/" + ops.bucket;  `

but the format on my S3 url is

`post_url = "https://"+ ops.bucket +".s3-" + ops.region + ".amazonaws.com/";`

do you think it's the issue why I've got 403 response all the time?

Here's the full error:

`XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ourbucket Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'https://oursite.c9users.io' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 403.`

Any help are appreciated.

Thanks!
Hi there,

I tried this on the system we developed but when I tried to upload the file I got the message below on browser console.

XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/jti-1. Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://oururl.io' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 403.

Can anyone tell me why and what is that?

Thanks!
Hey there folks.

I know you're busy with life and a million other things.  Maybe somebody would be willing to put together a PR for the docs with an example on how to do this in React with a progress bar and all the goodies.

Just a thought for those coming here after us.
Is it possible to pass the file to the server from the client and then upload to S3 from there?
Hey, I am checking with my iPad. its working fine in browser. But when I upload a saved video file from app, It showing a blank 0 byte MOV file on s3 server. Although if I capture directly from camera, It works just fine. Pretty annoying. :/
