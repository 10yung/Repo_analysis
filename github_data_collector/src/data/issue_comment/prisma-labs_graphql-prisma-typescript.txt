Error: Cannot use GraphQLSchema "[object GraphQLSchema]" from another module or realm.

Ensure that there is only one instance of "graphql" in the node_modules
directory. If different versions of "graphql" are the dependencies of other
relied on modules, use "resolutions" to ensure only one version is installed.

https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions

Duplicate "graphql" modules cannot be used at the same time since different
versions may have different capabilities and behavior. The data from one
version used in the function from another could produce confusing and
spurious results.

```

I suspect this is because `renovate-bot` automatically upgrades dependencies and there are no tests setup in this repo.
Hi,

There are dependency issues while doing `yarn install`. It is mainly because of the graphql-yoga dependency.

I set up a subscription like this:

`import { Context } from '../utils'
export const Subscription = {
  deviceData: {
    subscribe: async (parent, args, ctx: Context, info) => {
      return ctx.db.subscription.deviceData({ where: args.where })
    }
  }
}`

Node is always null in CREATED mutation. I can not get my data in that result.

`{
  "data": {
    "deviceData": {
      "mutation": "CREATED",
      "node": null,
      "updatedFields": null,
      "previousValues": null
    }
  }
}`
Hi, I want to refactor my app with ts and i am quite confused with the subscription described in this example. I am used to using `subscribe` and `resolve` in subscription, like below:

```js
const Subscription = {
    fooSub: {
        subscribe: 
        resolve:
    },
}
```

And in this example it is like

```js
const Subscription: SubscriptionResolvers.Type<TypeMap> = {
    fooSub: parent => null
};
```

Can someone explain the flow here? Thanks in advance.
