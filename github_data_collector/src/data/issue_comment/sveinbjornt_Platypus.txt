I couldn't see a way to encrypt the python byte code when creating a package. 
Does anyone know if this is possible or can we propose this as a feature request please?
**Snippet (Shell/bash/etc interpreter):**
```
printf "\033[0;31m"
echo red text
printf "\033[0m"
```

**Expected:**
red text _(in red color)_

**Actual:**
```
[0;31mred?
[0m
```

Also tested with: zsh,perl,python.
tput in sh also doesn't work.
I have an app on my Mac that may update two files.  If I add them as bundled files, they are copied into the resource folder, and updates don't affect the original files.  What I do now is add the files, then go into the Resources folder on the command line, delete the files, and replace them with symlinks to the actual files.  I have to do this any time I maintain the app.  It would be a lot more convenient if Platypus had a facility to bundle soft links.

Sending applicationDidFinishLaunching and applicationShouldTerminate to the underlying script allows writing more robust applications. It directly communicates the stat of the StatusMenu application.
I'm having some trouble trying to create an app that reliably passes along the URLs sent to it to the script. I'm a new Platypus user (love it so far!), so it's possible I'm doing something wrong, but if so, I can't figure out what. Here's my test setup:

Create a Platypus app called TestURLs (or whatever) with a Text Window interface, with Accept dropped items checked, and within those settings, I checked Register as URI scheme handler and added http and https as schemes. Use this as the script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

for arg in "$@" ; do
    echo "arg: '$arg'"
done
```

In the terminal, issue the following command:

```
open -a TestURLs 'http://example.com' 'http://foobar.com'
```

Expected output:

```
​arg: 'http://example.com'
​arg: 'http://foobar.com'
```

Actual output varies. Most often, I get the following:

```
​arg: 'http://example.com'
```

and it loses the second URL. Sometimes I get no output at all, as if no arguments have been passed. Very rarely, I'll get the expected output of both URLs.

I've verified that if I send the same open command to an ordinary browser, both URLs get opened. For example, this command will open both URLs in Chrome:

```
open -a 'Google Chrome' 'http://example.com' 'http://foobar.com'
```

Any ideas what's going on here?

Thanks!
I'm seeing a strange issue with .webloc files. When I create an app that accepts dropped files, whatever I drag is passed as an argument, except, for some strange reason, .webloc files.

Steps to reproduce:
Create a Platypus app that accepts all dropped files
Write a script that outputs argv
Drag a .webloc file

I'm attaching an example app. All the script does is this:

`<? print_r($argv); ?>`

So, whatever I drag to it is output in the window. Except .webloc files.

All apps I create with Platypus all show up in System Prefs -> Notifications Center.
Is there a way to not have every app I create show up in the notification Center?
Since about a week ago, everything associated with the current version of Platypus is being flagged by my antivirus software as "win.trojan.pistacchietto" and blocked from running. This includes php apps that I build with platypus, as well as new copies of platypus that I download. 

Is this an actual infection, or a false positive?

The antivirus software that I'm using is CISCO Amp for Endpoints, it's based on ClamAV(osx.cvd 295)
Hi! Created gedit launcher app with Platypus 5.3, selected png icon from folder, and created the app in the Applications folder, so far so good, but after app creation, and running the launcher, the dock icon remains blank.

How can I change that?

Thanks!
