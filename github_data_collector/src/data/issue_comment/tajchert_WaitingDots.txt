Using you library in our project (thanks a lot for it) in which we use `CanaryLeak` I've found two leaks in your code:
1. There are some anonymous  `AnimatorUpdateListener` defined that holds a reference to the context.
2. There are some anonymous `TypeEvaluator` implementations that because they holds references to their parent class and this one to the context leak memory too.

I found a few leaks in the library and I fixed them in this PR. The other functionalities stay put, I didn't actually change anything else.

Best regards
