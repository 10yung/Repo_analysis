Look the current example of VSC Material Theme

I think operators should not be same color as keywords "true/false" and "$this->" will be better with a different color. Look at the example below

And the older Material from Sublime

**Describe the bug**
Since the update to v31 coloring issues with Fortran code (I know dated) are occurring that didn't exist in prior versions. In particular, the coloring of parentheses of 'class' and 'type' keywords aren't respected, every word seems to be identified as something such that they are colored red, and arguments to functions and the commas aren't colored correctly.

**To Reproduce**
Use the latest version and open any piece of Fortran code.

**Expected behavior**
I don't expect every word to be highlighted some color and would like for parentheses to be respected.

**Screenshots**
Before version 31, and using the Community version of Palenight High Contrast, code would look as follows:

Now, code looks as follows:

Hey, did the syntax color change for nodejs because I have liked the original colors before the update made 19 hours ago. Now everything looks so blue.

--- Update ---
By the way I am talking about the Default Material Theme
It seems like vsc-material-theme tries to write a user.material-theme.config.json to the extension installation folder.

Can there be a toggle to skip this behavior? Depending on how vscode & extensions are installed, this path may be read-only (such as on NixOS) which produces the following error at vscode launch:

**Screenshots**

**Describe the bug**


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Start with a theme that sets an accent color (e.g. ```CarloCardella.hogwarts-colors-dark```): tab.ActiveBorder is set to #BD2A1B
2. Set the accent color to any color of your choice. e.g. ```Set Accent Color -> Lime```
3. Now reset the accent color: ```Set Accent Color -> Remove Accents```
4. tab.ActiveBolder (and a number of other settings) are now changed to the Material Theme default accent color (Blue) rather than back to the original #BD2A1B

**Expected behavior**
When resetting the Accent Color, return to the original accent rather than defaulting to Blue

**Screenshots**

**Additional context**
When setting the accent color (.2 above) a number of settings get added to User Settings under ```workbench.colorCustomizations```, then when the Access is reset these same settings are set to Blue rather than being removed from the user configuration.
