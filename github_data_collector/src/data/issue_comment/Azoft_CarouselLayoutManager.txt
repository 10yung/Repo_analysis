I tried to edit **transformChild**  function, but seems like nothing is working ...
Anyone have solution ?
Is there an option to snap one item at a item no matter how fast the user flings?
Spacing between left, center and right item is too much, can't be adjusted
I implement onScroll event of RecyclerView, How i`m able to find the visible(centered item) position when recyclerview state gone to idle State.
When I am trying to scroll list the view in center position it looks like jumping to  center position
in `ItemTransformation transformChild` method
`final float scale = (float) (2 * (2 * -StrictMath.atan(Math.abs(itemPositionToCenterDiff) + 1.0) / Math.PI + 1));

        // because scaling will make view smaller in its center, then we should move this item to the top or bottom to make it visible
        final float translateY;
        final float translateX;
        if (CarouselLayoutManager.VERTICAL == orientation) {
            final float translateYGeneral = child.getMeasuredHeight() * (1 - scale) / 2f;
            translateY = Math.signum(itemPositionToCenterDiff) * translateYGeneral;
            translateX = 0;
        } else {
//            final float translateXGeneral = child.getMeasuredWidth() * (1 - scale) / 2f;
            final float translateXGeneral = child.getMeasuredWidth() * (0.9f - scale) / 1.7f;

            translateX = Math.signum(itemPositionToCenterDiff) * translateXGeneral;
            translateY = 0;
        }


        return new ItemTransformation(scale, scale, translateX, translateY);`
