so right now, we update after all functions complete, maybe we can update RPROMPT after each function completes?
basically, if we find the gitstatus env var, use that

I noticed that this issue (#165) has been open for a while and decided to try implementing it after reading the gitter.

There are a few issues right now, but I'm mostly looking for feedback before putting more effort into it.

Namely:
- Customization options for colors
- Customization for state text
- State doesn't re-display after executing command (maybe `precmd` hook?)
- Should the plugin automatically activate `bindkey -v`?

Zshell has the ability to go into vi-mode with `bindkey -v` settings. If you are using `oh-my-zsh`, this feature can be enabled by including the [vi-mode](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/plugins/vi-mode/vi-mode.plugin.zsh) plugin.

However, the interest with `geometry` is to port the visual indicator over.  [vi-mode](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/plugins/vi-mode/vi-mode.plugin.zsh#L43) implements its own visual indicator function `vi_mode_prompt_info()` where it toggles between `vimcmd` and `main` mode indicating `NORMAL` and `INSERT` mode respectively.

The request here is to include the visual indicator as a plugin in `geometry`. Thank you in advance.
