-The arrows have a black background atleast the starting one.
-The arrows are smaller than the backgroundfill and kinda offset, what are the recommended font settings here?
-Is there a way to disable the statussymbols? or were they supposed to be displayed in a black prefix arrow but the fill is just not visible?

I know this is vscode and fontspecific somehow but i just wanted to throw this in here and let you know.

With the DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline font atleast the scaling looks correct:

Look at this crazy shit that new versions of iTerm2 have:

Now iTerm2 users don't have to dink around with installing Powerline-patched fonts, which is the hardest part of getting Agnoster working. How about updating the README to tell Mac users to do that?
question: is there a way to add on the right side of prompt information about time, last command exit code and last command history number?

as you can see some character don't appear when I do the  echo "\ue0b0 \u00b1 \ue0a0 \u27a6 \u2718 \u26a1 \u2699" command the colours are off in short it a bit of a mess ^^' and I tried finding multiple solution I found this one https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/1906#issuecomment-252443982 which helped a lot because it made the arrow appear at the end of ~. But I am a bit out of option I spent days trying to understand how everything work with no luck and sadly not a lot of time cause well work. So help of any kind is very welcome and if you need more information cause I m not very sure of what to post just ask.

thank you very much in advance 
ps I am far from being a expert so please do explain in detail if possible thanks 
I like to have different colors in the context part, so that I can customize it differently on each computer I am logged in. This way I can see at a glance which machine I am logged in.

Just define HOST_BG and HOST_FG environnement variables.
Hello
first sorry for my english

I've created a repository with git and then I delete git in that repository
When I'm in this repository, the theme shows me that I'm in master branch.
But this repo is not a git repository anymore
The problem comes from the test:
`git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`

If you do this in an old git repo you will get false instead of an error

I've changed agnoster.zsh-theme to fix that with :
```
   if $(git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree >/dev/null 2>&1); then
+    res=$(git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree)
+    if [[ "$res" = "false" ]]; then
+       return
+    fi
     repo_path=$(git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null)
```

I don't know if you want to add it? or optimize it ;)
Regards

This small patch is for replacing virtualenv with conda environment.
Hello!
I just got agnoster working on a chromebook believe it or not, powerline and all, 
and I've noticed that when I type a file or directory command like cd or ls,
the command itself prints connected to the output. For example:
` chronos@localhost> $ ls
 
ls000065.log               'Custom Dictionary.txt.backup'  'History Provider Cache'      'Media Cache'                         'Session Storage'`

Why does it do this?
Hello,
