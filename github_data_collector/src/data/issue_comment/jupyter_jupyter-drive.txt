Is this a new issue or this is something wrong with my setup?
I'm running jupyter notebook as a server on a raspberry pi. I also run jupyter notebook in a virtualenv. I was able to run jupyterdrive by using the `--user` option. Because this is running as a server on my network I initiate jupyter using `jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8889`. But when I go to the notebook interface using my browser I do not get the authorization message. Any suggestions? Thanks.
After installing jupyterdrive, everything well fine.
But now everytime I lunch a notebook, the kernel working directory is set to the directory in which I started the jupyter notebook server.
I would like to se the working directory automatically to where the notebook.ipynb is. 
As our team installed jupyterdrive to work collaboratively so we have relatives paths to where .ipynb is.

Any ideas?
Thx
Charly

Hi,

Jupyter notebook 5.0.0 was released a few days ago. I can't seem to get jupyterdrive to work with this update.

The gdrive folder shows and and shows the files from my drive, however when i choose a folder i get a 500 internal server error.

The terminal that launched the notebook shows the following:


```

If I sleep my laptop at work and go home, my open notebooks error Invalid Credentials. There is nothing at the shell that indicates what is wrong. I'm assuming it's an expired session??? If I go to the Notebook Home tab and press the home icon it will eventually reload my drive folder but running notebooks won't ever come back by just pressing save after restoring the browsability in the Home tab. If I refresh the page it will reconnect but I fear I think I lose any unsaved changes. I need to test that as I notice before I make changes and don't do any changes until the connection is reestablished. I'm not sure there is a fix for this but thought I would bring it up as no one has reported it from what I can see. I cannot recreate the issue by simply disabling my connection and re-enabling but perhaps it is because I do not wait long enough for the session to be invalid.
Jupyter 4.2.1
Ubuntu 16.04
Metadata-Version: 1.1
Name: jupyterdrive
Version: 1.1.0
Summary: Integration of IPython/Jupyter with Google drive
Home-page: https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-drive
[This code](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-drive/blob/master/jupyterdrive/__init__.py#L40) will by default install to `/usr/local/` instead of checking first the user-specific config directories.

On `npm install` of a fresh clone, I get

```
npm WARN deprecated tsd@0.6.5: TSD is deprecated in favor of Typings (https://github.com/typings/typings) - see https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/tsd/issues/269 for more information
```

I installed nbgrader before installing jupyter-drive and I received this error message:

```
WARNING:root:Unrecognized JSON config file version, assuming version 1

    raise ValueError('You already got some configuration that will conflict with google drive. Bailin out')
ValueError: You already got some configuration that will conflict with google drive. Bailin out
```

My config looked like this:

``` json
{
  "format": 1,
  "NotebookApp": {
    "server_extensions": [
      "nbgrader.nbextensions.assignment_list"
    ],
    "contents_manager_class": "jupyterdrive.clientsidenbmanager.ClientSideContentsManager",
    "tornado_settings": {
      "contents_js_source": "nbextensions/gdrive/drive-contents"
    }
  }
}
```

Maybe it's actually the existing jupyter-drive config, from an earlier failed attempt, that is causing the conflict.  If so, maybe we should try to recognize the existing content.

The **workaround** was to erase the troublesome content from my config so that my config looked like this:

``` json
{

}
```

Which lead to:

```
WARNING:root:Unrecognized JSON config file version, assuming version 1
INFO:jupyterdrive:Activating Google Drive integration
```

And a successful config file.

Tring to unstall on a mac, with latest jupyter (at the time writing).
The command `python3 -m jupyterdrive` ends without error (still have to test it) while :  

```
 python3 -m jupyterdrive --mixed
```

gives error :  

```
python3 -m jupyterdrive --mixed
