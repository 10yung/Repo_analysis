Can polar code be used with MIMO now? I've searched a lot, it seems that in 5g nr polar code can not be used with MIMO, there's only 1 antenna port for polar code right?
When I directly call the PUCCH_encoder.m and PUCCH_decoder.m, only 15 (32,16) polar blocks can be encoded or decoded per second. After reading the code, I have found an interesting point that the path 'component' will be added every time the encoding and decoding function is called. After moving the corresponding codes to top file to make them be called only once, the speed can be improved by up to 100 times (about 2000 blocks per second). So, I think this may be taken into consideration in your future revision.
