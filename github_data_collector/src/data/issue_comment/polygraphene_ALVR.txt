All R9 series AMD graphics cards require the resolution to be scaled down to 50 or 75%
It was working fine prior to the January 16 update for Steam VR. It may also be from a GeForce Driver update on the 6th but I think it was working even after that. It now shows that the headset is not available.


I downloaded ALVR and when I run ALVR.exe, a popup appears saying "Unhandled exception has occurred in your application....." When I click continue it opens up but nothing happens when I click install driver.

Hi, Iâ€™ve set up alvr for my quest and everything (controllers, display) works except for the audio, which only works through my computers wired headphones. Is there a way to send the audio to play directly through the quest?
So it seems my laptop's not compatible with this, and I'm trying to uninstall ALVR, but the uninstall is not doing anything - progress bar is not moving.

How do I manually uninstall?
Hello ! I want to start with I love your work I think it is a great idea to use wi-fi for connecting the quest and go to the pc (that keep the wireless feature of those devices).
I hope you'll be able to connect it right through the oculus home in the future.

For now the issue I have to report is that the controllers change to valves controllers once in steamVR and the mapping isn't good I can't even change it or do anything.
Hey,

I just bought a Oculus Quest and tried with using ALVR. Unfortunately I have very high latency.
On Riftcat it was working fine. No matter what, it keeps up the latency high. I am using a 2.4G wifi connection on the pc, and a 5G on the Quest.

Not sure what could fix this problem.
