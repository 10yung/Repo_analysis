The copy() function for NetworkStore was missing the serviceList and serviceListDefaultPort members, making them not work.

The bug is due to Scribe calling AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE in both the top of configure.ac and inside FB_INITIALIZE defined in acinclude.m4. The solution is to comment the AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.
