Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Disconnect internet.
2. Start vscode into a workspace/project/folder that uses git
3. Github Pull Requests doesn't sign in (expected)
4. Connect to internet, after a while.
5. Github Pull Requests doesn't detect internet connection (expected, but can 
    be a feature request).
6. Click on "Sign in to github.com" in status bar.
7. New browser window opens, asking for a new token (not expected)
    Old token is ignored and this repeats, creating tokens all the time.
Alternatively, if internet is available at the time of vscode's startup, Sign in is successful, no problems there.

- VSCode Version: 1.41.1 (26076a4de974ead31f97692a0d32f90d735645c0, 2019-12-18T14:57:51.166Z)
- OS: macOS Catalina 10.15.2 (Darwin x64 19.2.0)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Click sign in to github
2. Accept the browser authorization request
3. Whether the browser activates vscode, or I copy the authorization token into the `manually provide response` prompt myself, it fails with these details:

* VScode shows a notification `Error signing in to github.com`
* The status bar has changed to `Signed in to github.com` but when I close the notification it returns to `Sign in to github.com`
* The output panel for `GitHub Pull Request` shows a stack trace:
```
[Info] Error signing in to github.com: Error: certificate has expired
[Info] Error: certificate has expired
	at TLSSocket.onConnectSecure (_tls_wrap.js:1317:34)
	at TLSSocket.emit (events.js:200:13)
	at TLSSocket._finishInit (_tls_wrap.js:792:8)
	at TLSWrap.ssl.onhandshakedone (_tls_wrap.js:606:12)
```

Nobody else I know is having this issue, so it's probably an issue with my config, what server is the extension trying to connect to? Both the GitHub website and the https://hub.github.com/ command line tool work perfectly ðŸ¤”
Background: Our auditors are looking for specific approval wording on the approval comment.
Request: It would be nice to use a keybinding (or other macro type feature) to enter a predefined comment.  We are doing this today via the "Saved Replies" option on the web.
I am just using the GH PR extension, and the changes in src/lib are rendered less indented than the changes in the root

I was expanding this PR -- https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-typescript/pull/51

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check out a PR

I'm on the correct PR branch.

2. Now I am unable to open the actual file to edit it.
The only option I have is to open it in GitHub.

I've seen screenshots where there are options in this contextual menu to open it.

The PR for that has been merged https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/pull/1267

Not sure exact steps to get into this situation, but I had an old PR branch locally, the author added commits, rebased the whole thing onto master, then force pushed. I checked it out, and saw that the files were still in the old state. 

I got a notification saying "This branch can be updated" or similar, but when I clicked "pull", I got a bunch of merge conflicts (the old changes conflicting with the new changes, when the new should have directly replaced the old, but didn't probably due to the force-push/rebase). 

I ran `git pull --abort` to get back to the old state, than ran vscode's `git sync` (which for me does rebase, not sure if thats relevant), and ended up in the correct state. Perhaps the "Pull" button should trigger a git sync? Though that might push bad commits so I'm not sure.
Related to #1288

It feels like the message box that shows "Your local repository is not up to date so only partial content is being displayed" could be improved to add a button which does a fetch on the base branch and reloads the document.

I would be willing to try and contribute a fix for this if the team is open to this.
Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. In the GitHub Pull Requests tree, expand a PR that has images or gifs in it and open one of these files

Error is shown and image is not opened. Also happens when the PR is checked out

Thanks for this wonderful plugin! 
However, I'm hesistant on authorizing this plugin to do EVERYTHING on my Github account.

The plugin requests Github authorization for write (and read) on EVERYTHING - including repo, team discussions, wiki, etc. 

![Firefox_Screenshot_2019-12-07T23-44-17 244Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16217941/70381965-d875ee80-1910-11ea-91e1-397999e699f3.png)

Could we switch to using least privilege permissions, where the default set of permissions is scoped down to what's required and the plugin gracefully degrades features based on permissions it is granted?
