Explored, but on-hold

- [ ] More ways to install (Chocolatey or Scoop for Windows, Homebrew for Mac, packager.io for Linux)
- [ ] Add option to require all dependencies without `library` calls - `jetpack.require()` (could be slow, requires Jetpack as runtime dependency)
- [ ] Automatic dependency resolution (this could be a huge undertaking - maybe use something like https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdepends or https://github.com/CocoaPods/Molinillo)
- [ ] Remove `desc` to reduce dependencies down to 4
- [ ] No dependencies (vendor all code)
- [ ] Add ability to vendor packages in project - `vendor_src` branch
- [ ] Shortcut for specifying GitHub remotes
