Hey,
  I have been using this all for quite some time and it is a great relief since I have been using this app, especially at night.
 However, recently this app isn't turning on at the sunrise time inspite of the location being set. But it auto turns off on its own.
Please suggest what can be done about it.
Red Moon version - 3.4.0
Android version - Android Marshmallow, and device model - Redmi Note 3

Hello

Thank you for this great app.
i had an feature request that somehow in related to #192 

Please introduce the Red Moon as an Accessibility app to the system.

Why this is important?
Because with this option, when user turns on the accessibility service of red moon in the android setting, Red Moon won't get killed when memory is low.

when using some memory intensive apps most of phones will have memory issue specially middle-range and low-end ones.

for my own this happened very much and it really made my eyes pain.

Please add it if may.

in the past clipstack app used same way.
although duo to Google Play policy, you may cannot put this in your main app (however i don't know the whole policy) but please at least put this option as a external plugin or such may be through F-droid or other means, it will be really helpful)

(if i remember correctly KeePass2Android used some method like this (plugin) after Google Play forced them to remove their accessibility service.)

Thanks.

Red Moon version: 3.4.0
Android version: 9
Device model: Samsung S10

The filter works perfectly fine when I have my phone in portrait mode. However, when I switch to landscape mode the navigation bar becomes unfiltered again.
![Portrait mode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51971775/59717438-9d0a2b00-91dd-11e9-88f0-58c9f500e392.jpg)
![Landscape mode:](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51971775/59717390-806df300-91dd-11e9-8184-8e331c10100d.jpg)

This issue happens when I start up Red Moon in landscape mode as well.

Thank you for making and working on this app!
**Expected behavior**
- I expected the 'Sunset to Sunrise' option to search and find my location when my location and data connection were on

---

**Actual behavior**
- The app keeps delaying by writing 'Searching for location' (even if I let it search for an hour). 

---

**How to reproduce**
- [Download](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.jmstudios.redmoon) and install the latest version of Opus 
- Launch the app
- accept any required permission 
- turn on your data connection and location 
- click on the 'Schedule' feature
- click on 'Sunset to Sunrise'
- wait for as long as you can
- see error

---

- App Version: v3.4.0
- Device: Gionee f100s 
- Operating System: 6.0

> Communities keep software projects alive. Without them, projects usually fade into obscurity when the primary developer loses interest or becomes busy in other parts of their life. That's where you come in! 

After reading this statement on your readme document, I saw the need for you to have a contributors guide document. First of all, the presence of that document sends out a message to prospective collaborators that you'd like their assistance on your project. Then secondly, it'll help them through the process of contributing to your project. 
Hi, I noticed the project doesn't have a privacy policy statement. I could help out if you'd need it.
Just a simple feature request--persistent notification and/or widget to quickly manually control brightness settings like f.lux. What I like about it (the way f.lux does it) is:

* Quick and predictable way of controlling brightness. Most situations is screen brightness is too low to see anything when I'm in broad daylight and I need to blindly change the brightness as I can't see anything. A persistent simple control for brightness via notification drop-down is useful in this regard. With f.lux, I can wake my screen, type my pin, dropdown the menu, and adjust the brightness as if my eyes are closed.

* Using incremental changes to brightness, as opposed to using a slider. Setting brightness should be quick and accurate (e.g. I know when I'm in a room vs. going outside I need to tap the brightness 5 times to increment/decrement by 50%)--the user shouldn't have to fidget to adjust the brightness to an accurate level when the environments he is in is nearly always the same (for me, it's: dark room, car, broad daylight, and the office).

You are doing a great job, this app is a life saver considering danger of blue light. I want request that you make it possible for users to activate or deactivated with voice command.

Also, if you accept, I would love to translate the language to Yoruba and Pidgin English.
What are the use of a blazing triangle, circle, and square when I'm trying to read comfortably in the dark?  The option exists to also dim the android soft buttons in the control bar.  Could that not also be an option in the app's settings?  When my pupils are fully dilated to see in the dark, it's a bit of a nuisance to have these control icons glowing so intensely in relation to everything else in my field of view.  Can the option to dim them also be added to the app?
From email:

> I would like to disable Red Moon on just the soft touch buttons at the bottom(back, home, multitasking). Is this possible?

This is definitely possible â€” we just need to change the size of the overlay. TODO:

- Investigate:
    - [ ] What is the bar officially called? (so we can name the setting correctly). Temp: "system navbar"
    - [ ] Can we detect the presence of the system navbar?
    - [ ] How is the height of the system navbar determined?

   I *believe* we already have questions 2 and 3 answered, just need to confirm that [navigationBarHeightPx](https://github.com/LibreShift/red-moon/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/jmstudios/redmoon/filter/overlay/ScreenManager.kt#L93) is the bar in question.
- [ ] Add a "Filter system navbar" setting to the main screen, at the bottom in the "no effect on some devices" category. If possible, hide this on devices without a soft navbar.
- [ ] Modify [screenHeight](https://github.com/LibreShift/red-moon/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/jmstudios/redmoon/filter/overlay/ScreenManager.kt#L64) to reflect the new setting. We shouldn't need to modify the layout params since the overlay is already top aligned.
