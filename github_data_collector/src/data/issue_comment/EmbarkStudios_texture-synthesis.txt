This adds support for building the lib for both `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `wasm32-wasi` with single-threaded execution, and for running the CLI with `wasm32-wasi`.

Example:
```sh
rustup target add wasm32-wasi

cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasi

wasmer run ./target/wasm32-wasi/release/texture-synthesis.wasm --mapdir=out:out --mapdir=imgs:imgs -- --out out/01.jpg generate imgs/1.jpg
```

It is not too practical yet without multithreading support (which WASM doesn't support yet), but is very portable and is a good benchmark to test WASM performance with.

I was pretty happy with the [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) [refactor](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/99) I did. I think we could improve the docs for this repo as well. Thoughts @anopara?
Hi,

I watched the talk linked in the Readme. At the end Anastasia mentions that you are currently working on bringing the 2d concept to 3d.

I am currently working on a (hobby) Voxel enigne in rust+vulkan and thought it might be easy to transfer the algorithm to 3d given a good Voxel loading/editing crate similar to the `image` crate.

Are there already working prototypes internally which take some 3d information and apply the algorithm to generate a new 3d model? Do you have some more crates in this direction planed or would it make sense for me to either extent this project to also worke in 3d or create a new one from scratch?

Greetings

Though #85 is a bug in structopt, we should still have at least one example of using sample masks, so that if users copy it and replace eg, the input image paths, they won't get this confusing error message.
When running:
```bash
texture-synthesis --inpaint mask.png -o output.png --sample-masks IGNORE mask.png -- generate white_square.png texture.png
```

I get:
```
error: The subcommand 'generate' wasn't recognized
	Did you mean 'generate'?

If you believe you received this message in error, try re-running with 'texture-synthesis -- generate'

USAGE:
    texture-synthesis --inpaint <inpaint> --out-size <out-size> --out <output-path> --sample-masks <sample-masks>...
```

Is this the expected behavior? How should I use `sample-masks` option? (there is no example in the README).

The help says:
```
--sample-masks <sample-masks>...
            Path(s) to sample masks used to determine which pixels in an example can be used as inputs during
            generation, any example that doesn't have a mask, or uses `ALL`, will consider all pixels in the example. If
            `IGNORE` is specified, then the example image won't be used at all, which is useful with `--inpaint`.
```
I'm precisely trying to use `sample-masks` in combination with `inpaint` but can not manage to do it.

### Checklist

* [x] I have read the [Contributor Guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [x] I have read and agree to the [Code of Conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* [x] I have added a description of my changes and why I'd like them included in the section below

### Description of Changes
Remove calls to `CandidateStruct::clear` (and the function itself).

These are not necessary as:
* Only `find_candidates` directly uses the `Vec` whose elements are being cleared - everything else uses the truncated slice returned by `find_candidates`.
* All `CandidateStructs` in that slice have been updated in the `if check_coord_validity` block within `find_candidates`, and this resizes the `CandidateStruct`'s `k_neighs` to have length matching the input `k_neighs` and then overwrites all of its values.

Clearing these vectors meant that `find_candidates` was wasting time writing values into the underlying allocations, only to immediately (potentially truncate the vecs and then) overwrite the values without using them. The `cargo bench` logs below show an improvement on every benchmark, ranging from 2.7% to 9.3%.

This might make the code slightly more brittle in the face of future changes, but 1. the regression tests should catch this, and 2. I don't think this is any more subtle than the existing implicit invariants between functions.

(This has trivial merge conflicts with https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/pull/82, but I'll fix those after you've decided which PRs you want to merge.)

### Description of Changes

All very minor stuff. Split into a series of commits to make it easier to cherry-pick changes you agree with.

(I tend to tinker with code as I'm reading through it, and thought I might as well upstream these; no offence taken if you decide this is just unnecessary churn.)

### Description of Changes

A micro-optimisation to reduce the number of calls to `f64::exp` and avoid an allocation in a fairly hot function. This gives a small speedup (see `cargo bench` output below), at the possible cost of making the code structure marginally worse (as the decision about how to decay scores with distances is no longer solely made within `find_best_match`). 

I have a few more "tidying" changes on a fork, and hope to also come up with a few more micro-optimisations. Shout if you'd rather not have such changes (e.g. because the minor improvements aren't worth the code churn, potential merge conflicts, or effort to review).

The first run below is on this branch; the second on master. Of the 35 results, 18 show an improvement after this change, 2 have regressed, and 15 are within noise threshold.

As this project distributes binary executables in the GitHub releases and as now have our [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/embarkstudios/cargo-about) tool we should use it to include license attribution for all dependencies used in the texture synthesis cli application, for every release.

Would be great to have a sub-command that prints out the licenses, something like `texture-synthesis-cli about-licenses` that shows a simple list of crates + license, and then maybe a `texture-synthesis-cli about-licenses-full` that shows the full license text for every unique license as well?

Should have a standard naming, output, and CI  set up for this that we (and others)  can use in all of our binary tools
