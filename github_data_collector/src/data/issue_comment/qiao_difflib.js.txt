I do realise that this library was created long ago when js didn't had classes but now it is different.
The require of assert is really another specific issue for using the library in electron. 
It is recommended to have nodeIntegration turned off, this means that any require will not work, but if it is import, that'ss another story and might just work.
And last time I used assert was for tests or otherthings done only in dev build, not in production.

This allows `yarn licenses` to properly generate attribution
Adds a `formatter` option to the `.getCloseMatches` function that is passed each element of the possibilities array before matching takes place.
It would be cool to have a way defining ignore the letter case changes. Like:

```
difflib.ndiff(before, after, { caseSensitive: false })
```

I am not sure if I can work this around with `charjunk` and `linejunk` stuff.

Is it possible to distribute this through bower?
