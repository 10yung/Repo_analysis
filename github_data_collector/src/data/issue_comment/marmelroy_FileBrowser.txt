Hi,
First of all I would like to thank you for the fantastic code.
Really it's a very nice tool.
I use it in my apps.
Now, I get the warning: "/Users/geogerar/Documents/geoWarApp_IOS10_Improved/geoWarApp/Helper_Classes/FileExplorer/Item.swift:99:9: 'Hashable.hashValue' is deprecated as a protocol requirement; conform type 'Item' to 'Hashable' by implementing 'hash(into:)' instead"

is it possible for you to correct this issue...?

Thank you in advance

George
Filter out a file if its name contains any of the excluded items
I thought I needed someone, so I tried to modify it.

When I import this project, I can use it and everything works (mostly) as expected. My only issue is that I can't delete anything if its in a subdirectory to the initial directory. Is this a bug, or is there some sort of easy fix?

I've been scratching my head for about an hour, and I tried adding `fileListViewController.allowEditing = allowEditing` to the function `tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath)`, but it doesn't appear to work the way I was hoping.
Hi,

Thanks for a great piece of coding, works almost exactly how I want.
Is it possible to re-sort the table to display the files by the creation date or date modified? Either as a direct change to code or as an add-in option?

I have a ```RootViewController``` which is a ```UITabBarController```;  
then I have a ```NavigationController``` in this ```RootViewController```;   
after that I use ```    self.navigationController?.pushViewController(vc, animated: true)``` to add a ```vc: CustomViewController``` in the ```NavigationController```

Now I have below standard code to call this package in the ```vc: CustomViewController```   
```
let fileBrowser = FileBrowser(initialPath: documentsURL)
present(fileBrowser, animated: true, completion: nil)
fileBrowser.didSelectFile = { (file: FBFile) -> Void in
    // things I do here...
}
```

However, after I select file and did those things there.
The ```vc: CustomViewController``` is removed!
It directly shows the ```NavigationController``` level.

Anyone knows how to fix this? I still need to stay in the ```vc: CustomViewController```.
