Much time has passed since this plugin was created, but the problems it solves are just as relevant today.

It would be great to take the logic/learnings from this plugin and expose it via a react hooks or components to be used in other projects without jquery.
Hi,

Great Job! Are you aware of any wordpress plugin using your jquery-menu-aim?

Thanks
This fixes the issue #14.
It automatically enables the first row to be activated when entering the menu. 
How to add an event for tab navigation.?
How can I open the submenu on press of "Enter" or "Space" and how to close on "esc" click?
Updated documentation and license info
I added an API:

    $menu.menuAim('activate', rowElem);
    $menu.menuAim('deactivateMenu');

Is this possible to prevent event bubbling ? 
Does any managed to work this out for horizontal menus? I've tried direction: "below" and other stuff but it just canâ€™t make it work :( 
It seems that the submenuSelector is not working. 

If if you define a submenu selector as following in the example.html it will stop working:

```
<!-- example.html: line 204 -->

$menu.menuAim({
   activate: activateSubmenu,
   deactivate: deactivateSubmenu,
   submenuSelector: ".popover"
});
```
Or do I use the option `submenuSelector` in a wrong way?
I wanted to be able to npm install this repo. Since it doesn't have a package.json I was not able to. Adding the file allows users to npm install this repo.
