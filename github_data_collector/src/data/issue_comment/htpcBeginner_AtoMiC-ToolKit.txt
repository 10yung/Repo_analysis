Sonarr web UI crashes after a while. I tried to restart it by this:
**sudo start nzbdrone**
But it shows:
_start: Unable to connect to Upstart: Failed to connect to socket /com/ubuntu/upstart: Connection refused_
I also tried this:
**mono /opt/NzbDrone/NzbDrone.exe**
And I got this:
_[Warn] SingleInstancePolicy: Another instance of Sonarr is already running._ 

So how do I stop it and restart?


Hi everyone,
I'm getting the following error when attempting to install the new version of plexmediaserver:

Setting up plexmediaserver (1.13.9.5456-ecd600442) ...
Failed to enable unit: File plexmediaserver.service: Invalid argument
dpkg: error processing package plexmediaserver (--configure):
 installed plexmediaserver package post-installation script subprocess returned error exit status 1
Errors were encountered while processing:
 plexmediaserver
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

I'm not seeing anything in the /var/log/apt. 
The only item that may provide a little direction is this in the dpkg.log file:

I've attempted to remove and reinstall the application, run the suggested reconfigure and force installation options from:

I'm running Ubuntu 18 - Linux PlexServer 4.15.0-38-generic #41-Ubuntu SMP Wed Oct 10 10:58:23 UTC 2018 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

hello this is my first time using the toolkit and it was awesome. however, i like to change the ports of the programs and i changed sonarr from port 8989 to another port. i have no issues running sonarr on another port, but the toolkit does not like that i changed the port and now the sonarr tasks dont run right. what do i do if i change the ports in the programs after they are installed?
Trying to update unrar, it gets built, checkinstall starts then gives me this:

```
Installing with make install...
========================= Installation results ===========================
/usr/bin/installwatch: line 338: /var/tmp/tmp.VCFXIVpVuX/installscript.sh: Permission denied
****  Installation failed. Aborting package creation.
```

The script already removed my unrar install, so now I'm stuck with no unrar and cannot install it due to some permission error. Can anyone help me? A dl server without unrar sucks :(
