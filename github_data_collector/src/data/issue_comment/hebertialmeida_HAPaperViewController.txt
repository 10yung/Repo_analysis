1、add one finger gesture
2、horizontal drag
3、change to large ,show appropriate cell rather than midle cell  

Hello, Hebert! :)
First, I really admired you created this amazing project for me and others. I created custom cell, each cell has vertical scrollView as whole view. When I'm at main page, I could click any single cell then it shows out the full-screen cell. Problem comes when I pinch the cell to go back to the main page, which I couldn't tap it to let it shown anymore. Hope to get your help soon. Thank you very much.
Some of my applied code is shown below.

// ConanCell.m - my custom cell 
- (void)awakeFromNib{
  self.smallView.layer.cornerRadius = 4;
  self.scrollView.userInteractionEnabled = NO;
  self.scrollView.scrollEnabled = NO;
  [self.contentView addGestureRecognizer:self.scrollView.panGestureRecognizer];
  }

//  HASmallCollectionViewController.m
- (void)collectionView:(UICollectionView _)collectionView didSelectItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
  {
  ConanCell *cell = (ConanCell_)[collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPath:indexPath];
  cell.scrollView.userInteractionEnabled = YES;
  cell.scrollView.scrollEnabled = YES;
  NSLog(@"Selected at %d",(int)indexPath.row);
  
  UIViewController *vc = [self nextViewControllerAtPoint:CGPointZero];
  [self.navigationController pushViewController:vc animated:YES];
  }

//  HATransitionController.m
- (void)endInteractionWithSuccess:(BOOL)success
  { ...
  else if ((self.transitionLayout.transitionProgress > 0.25) && success)
  {
      [self.collectionView finishInteractiveTransition];
      [self.context finishInteractiveTransition];
      ConanCell *conan = [ConanCell new];
      conan.scrollView.userInteractionEnabled = NO;
      NSLog(@"Back");
   } ...
  }

I have a view controller that is my initial view controller, it is embedded in a Navigation Controller. I have a push segue from that view to the PaperViewController, but it doesn't load correctly. Here is what it looks like:

How can I use it when it's not the root view controller?

Thanks


I'm playing around with the transition of the CollectionViewLayout of the example and couldn't figure out how to autoresize the content of the cell between the small and large layout.

E.g. I have an UILabel within the CollectionViewCell which should be half the width of the cell. When the transition to the large layout is finished, the label should be also half of the cell, but with a larger font size (or resized).

Use autolayout here or scale the contentView with CGAffineTransformMakeScale?

Any advice would be helpful .. ;)
