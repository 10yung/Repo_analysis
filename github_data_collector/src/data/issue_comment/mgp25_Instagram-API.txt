# Question

I had a working script, which worked perfectly. Suddenly, since a few days ago, I cannot use my script at all. Everything, it gives an error of "Challenge required". I verify that it was me on my Instagram, but when running the script I get the same error.

I deleted the session folder, but not luck.

I read here that the problem is because of different IPs. But I all of my devices use the same internet, and I have no proxy at all.

---

### Code (Optional)
$ig = new \InstagramAPI\Instagram();
$ig->login($username, $password);

### Debug Log (Optional)
`Fatal error: Uncaught InstagramAPI\Exception\ChallengeRequiredException: InstagramAPI\Response\LoginResponse: Challenge required.`
Hi,

I have a question regarding Instagram more than your API I think but as you did develope so much stuff around it, you might have the answer (throughout your API maybe)!

I would like to know the pagination size of Instagram? Related to both Threads and Messages. In fact, I would like to know:

- How many threads (and how many messages per thread) are returned at the first request (when you request the API for the first batch)
- How many threads (and how many messages per thread) are returned for each new page?
- How many Messages are returned per page when you paginate a given Thread?

Also, I am pretty sure that these amounts are server-side definitions but would I be able to change it from client-side ? (using your API)

# Feature Request
I am making an android app which would require me to request account data for the account I am logged in (for example the date account was created and the former emails used and so on). I think there is no end point for such a thing in the API and I would like to request to please implement it. It's not for anything spammy it's just for an Android app which will go live on play store. Thank you.

How can I unsend message (delete for both sides)?
Hello friends
Unfortunately, the unseen voice_media in "thread"->[items] is not displayed by instagram api.
This occurs only when the received voice_media is unseen mode.
Looking for a solution to this problem?
How can I get a url to story? Searched for a method, but did not find =( Thanks in advance for the help.
I know this does not fit the format but as far as I follow the issues, the recent issue (probobly about the same problem) is not getting any updates. I would love to know if anyone else is still having the same problem..

During the time since the api stopped working, I've realized a few things:

1. some old versions of the api is still working. For instance, for one of the acounts I have (that's using this api) I'm still using the old v4.1.0 and it seems to post just fine.

2. other private api's (python, nodejs, etc) seem to be working.

Are we a minority with this api failing to work since yesterday? Or is everyone having the same issues?

Can this be account related rather than api related?

Thank you.
