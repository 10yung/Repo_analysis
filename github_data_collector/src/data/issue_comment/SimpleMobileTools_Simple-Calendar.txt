I'm thrilled that this app has the 'Loop reminders until dismissed' setting but if it is enabled then all reminders turn my device into a constant alarm clock. What would be great is if users could enable this setting for only certain events, event types, or reminders. More generally, it might be useful to be able to change any of the 'event reminder' settings (Vibrate, loop, reminder sound...) on a per event basis.

Hello !
After activating the widget i noticed the date format there was not what i wanted (month/day-number instead of day-number/month). I searched in the issues here and found a guy saying it was located in Settings ([here](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calendar/issues/63)), but i didn't see anything in the app settings that could do it, nor in the settings of my phone.
Can you help me ? or if it's not a feature, can we make it into one ?

Hello,

When using the calendar event list widget, I can't seem to find a way to hide distant future events, which may or may not be recurring.

If it's not too hard of a feature to add, would it be possible to support a setting for specifying a duration window after which future events don't show up in the event list widget?

In such a case where there are no upcoming events, a message such as, "No upcoming events." (optionally with the duration window) might be appropriate as a placeholder.

Thank you for continuing to support this app. :bowing_man:

I am running 6.7.2 from f-droid.

Today, I started seeing pretty much consistently an error message from android about the app with uid 10249 generating too many alarms. See screenshot:
![Screenshot_20191213-160942_Calendar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/195073/70849671-154a6400-1e82-11ea-8d2e-50b171b6bbc0.jpg)

It's really annoying to have a toast warning on the screen almost all the time. Even a reboot did not fix the issue. And I don't even use alarms / reminders that much... 
hello. I use simple-calender multiple times daily to add calender events. Every event ist different in terms of notifications: Sometimes I want none, sometimes 3 different ones, sometimes I just want to  be notified when the event starts.

Currently I have to click each notification pre-set to then put them to "no notification"- with 3 preset notifications from last time's event: thats 6 clicks.

Requested by me is a simple button (without a popup) in the "edit" screen of an event to either
1. delete all notifications (1click)
2. delete notifications seperately. (3clicks)

best regards!
Is this feature already there and did I miss it somehow ?
I don't see it neither while editing any event nor when scanning the main app's configuration...
(Btw, great job on this happ, most thankfull !)
Hi all,

I use DAVx5 to synchronize my hosted CalDAV calendars to my phone. I use repeating events, where I modify single occurrences (mostly adding descriptions). This will lead to SimpleCalendar not showing the modified occurrence anymore at all. Regular repeating events that are not modified work as expected.

I made sure it's not a DAVx5 - the events appear correctly if I use the Android (Google) Calendar app (which for now, I have to use because of this bug). They also appear correctly in the Web UI of my provider and Thunderbird (where I create them).

Possibly related to #950, #735,  #981 by glancing over them.

Android 10
SimpleCalendar 6.6.5
DAVx5 2.6-ose
