Hi,

Hello,

I have two arrays (with header) in the same sheet.
How to get the datas that second array ?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7510673/70313412-dc711600-1815-11ea-8ec1-954bf5b179af.png)

` _history = new ExcelQueryFactory(filepath).Worksheet<TicketHistory>("Report");`

All TicketHistory properties are null...
If i delete a first array in xlsx file, all working
string pathToExcelFile = ""
        + @"C:\MyFolder\ProjectFolder\sample.xlsx";
string sheetName = "Sheet1";
 var excelFile = new ExcelQueryFactory(pathToExcelFile);

this code is okey but if i changed the path impersonator like this "\\file01server\uploads\" doesnt work.
Are there any suggestion?
I have a Excel sheet which serves as data source. The sheet contains a number of calculated values.
The cells containing these calculated values have been formatted.
These calculated values which have to be imported by another application, but these values should be imported without the format applied. The raw calculated value so to speak.
Currently, however the data is read in the formatted way and it is caused by the fact that the connection string is forced to use IMEX=1.
Not specifying the IMEX or using IMEX=2 returns the unformatted values from the file.

What is the reason the the IMEX value is hardcoded to 1? Couldn't it just be replaced by using value 2 instead?
I can't think of a reason why you don't want the actual value from a cell.

The most flexible solution would be to allow the user to specify the IMEX option when setting up the ExcelQueryFactory. I could send a pull request which allows this option to be set.
I would only allow the options 1 and 2 as using value 0 would currently skip the first row when retrieving the data which I consider unexpected behavior. 
Well at least I was surprised by this ðŸ˜‰
 

If the file has say 1000 records it works fine, if I increase the size of the file by adding more rows, lets say it hits 500kb it starts failing with the error, External Table is not in the expected format. 

Vesion, 2.0.0-PreRelease - 2, installed via NPM Manager 
We have column name 'Date' and it's value as '31/12/2019', this value is automatically converted DateTime to '31/12/2019 12:00:00 AM' which we don't want to. We want to treat it as plain string. not as DateTime.
Please help to get us any solution. 

Between thanks for the great library!
I have installed the 64 version of "AccessDatabaseEngine_X64.exe" however for file .xlxs I m getting the error The 'Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0' provider is not registered on the local machine.

But file .xls is working file for processing. 

What could be the possible cause for this ?
Apparently, you cannot just download the redistributable  <Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable> anymore. Any suggestions, or do I have that wrong?
You don't need to install ace database engine already installed Office 2010/2013/2016.
32-bit and 64-bit same versions of ace database engine cannot be installed on the same computer, but 32-bit and 64-bit different versions of ace database engine can be installed on the same computer. Example: 32-bit Ace2010 and 64-bit Ace2016.
This way, you can use LinqToExcel in 32-bit and 64-bit programs on the same computer.
Hi,
Is anyone know, how i can get the real value of a cell and not the formattedValue?

Thanks for your help

PS: With interop is good, but i can't use interrop in the server.

I am getting this error System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException: 'External component has thrown an exception.' When accessing xlsx files. No changes to the code, it just stopped working. 
```cs
var excel = new ExcelQueryFactory(FullFileName);
List<string> wsNames = excel.GetWorksheetNames().ToList();
```
This works for xls files but not xlsx files.

Thank You,
Scott
