## Change Description

- Remove new block id notify feature as it doesn't actually improve performance and actually causes issues with large # of connections.
- Since this was the only new net protocol feature added in 2.0, the net protocol version has been reverted to 1.8 .. 1.0 version.

Minor changes to update EOS VM OC to work with LLVM 10. Tested against rc1, passed all tests.

ORCv1, the LLVM API EOS VM OC is using, was expected to be removed in 10 but it has survived. Sounds like almost certain it will be removed for 11 though, so updating to the ORCv2 API will be a requirement soon.

I upgraded a dapp infrastructure that consisted of several 1.8 nodes on EOS mainnet. All servers are in the same datacenter. I deleted the old data, downloaded a recent snapshot from EOS Nation and EOS Sweden, then enabled  `wasm-runtime = eos-vm-jit`, `eos-vm-oc-enable = true` and started nodeos from snapshot. Some nodes have state history plugin enabled, others do not.

So, first upgrades went alright and synched against public p2p quite quickly, although not occupying the CPU at 100% all the time.

The last servers synched very slowly while I tried to use direct peers in the same datacenter. It looks like a 2.0 node synching from 2.0  is affected, and when the remote peer is 1.8 it synchronizes much faster.

So, even with a remote peer in the same datacenter over a gigabit link, and only one peer configured, the node goes to 100% CPU for few seconds and then waits for something, keeping the CPU at 2% for about 10 seconds. During this idling time, the head is not advancing,. Then it resumes for few seconds and then idles again. This results in a very slow resync.

I tried various values for `sync-fetch-span`  between 50 and 500, and it didn't change the picture.




I push my transaction success and also find the trx_id in mongo, but it lost.

**Problem:** The Blockchain team will make changes to a submodule in the eosio-security repo and then push with a new SHA/COMMIT.  The security mirror repo for EOS uses the public repos/submodules remotes (since it's synced with the public repo). Because of this, buildkite will prepare a working directory with the public repo urls. If the commit id of the submodule is not in the public repo, this preparation step will fail to find the commit.

**Goal:** Replicate, in a script, the preparation of the working directory. Additionally, support adding the `-security` remote so that commits are available for `submodule update`

Here is how we accomplish this:

The Pipeline Upload step becomes:

```
env:
  SKIP_CONTRACT_BUILDER: "true"

steps:
  - label: ":pipeline: Pipeline Upload"
    command:
      - "curl -s -o prep.sh https://buildkite-prep-working-directory-script.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/master/$BUILDKITE_PIPELINE_SLUG.sh && chmod +x prep.sh && ./prep.sh"
      - "./.cicd/generate-pipeline.sh > pipeline.yml && buildkite-agent artifact upload pipeline.yml && buildkite-agent pipeline upload pipeline.yml"
    agents:
      - "queue=automation-basic-builder-fleet"
    plugins:
      - thedyrt/skip-checkout#v0.1.1:
          cd: ~
```

This pulls the script we use to prep the working directory from S3 and executes it. The repo for these scripts can be found at https://github.com/EOSIO/buildkite-prepare-working-directory-scripts

- The script, when running in buildkite (using $CI == true), will rm itself.
- The folders in the S3 bucket are for the branches in the EOSIO/buildkite-prepare-working-directory-scripts repo.
- It is run for both mac and linux platforms.
- We will have a pipeline that automatically uploads changes in the EOSIO/buildkite-prepare-working-directory-scripts repo to S3. As of right now, it's a manual upload process.

Once it's pulled, other commands are then executed as normal.

You can see a run with EOS-VM pointing to a branch in the eos-vm-security repo here: https://buildkite.com/EOSIO/eosio-security-v2/builds/56

You can also see it running without changing the EOS-VM submodule: https://buildkite.com/EOSIO/eosio-security-v2/builds/51

Note: Compared to buildkite's prep working dir step, there is only a ~10 second increase in time.

When you have exceeded max_client_count and clients keep trying to connect, there is too much noise in the logs. It would be better to say X number of connections were rejected in the last 1 minute or something.

This is with default logging.

Could presumably cause a DOS by simply connecting to the P2P port over and over and then filling up the logs.

1. setup p2p node on public internet
1. set max connections to a low number
1. connect valid p2p clients to fill up all those connections, then watch what happens when you connect more clients over the limit

To reproduce
- compile 2.0.0
- start nodeos with `database-map-mode = locked`.
- stop nodeos normally and let it shutdown
- observe the logs

Files are stored on ext4 SSD. Please advise if any additional environmental information is needed.

Note: using systemd here to manage nodeos
