Added ruby 1.9.3 and specific versions of gems (rake, rdoc, mime-types and rack-cache) so that bundle install can work after generating a new instance


Bundler complains that the Gemfile lists the gem compass-rails (~> 1.0.3) more than once. This simply removes the second time it is included

I'm currently trying to run radiantcms on rails 6 beta.

Since i have no clue how ExtensionLoader is supposed to work, I fiddled with:
[main] application.rb: glob vendor/extensions and add paths to config.autoload_paths
```
    config.autoload_paths << Rails.root.join('lib/radiant-copy')
    extensions_sub_dirs = Dir.glob('vendor/extensions/**/*/').reject{|f| f=~ %r~/(db|recipes|public|spec|test|views)/~ }
    extensions = Dir.glob('vendor/extensions/*')
    extensions.each do |ext|
      ext_paths = extensions_sub_dirs.select{|d| d.include?(ext)}
      config.autoload_paths.concat(ext_paths)
    end
```
[radiant] engine.rb:
```
      el = Radiant::ExtensionLoader.instance
      el.extensions = Radiant::Engine.all_available_extensions
      el.extensions.each do |ext_name|
        ext = el.load_extension(ext_name)
        ext.activate
      end
```

I'm sure this is not the way EngineLoader is supposed to work.

To be more specfic:
What is Radiant::ExtensionLoader#initializer?
Where is Radiant::ExtensionLoader#gems?

Feedback highly appreciated, @jomz
Hello Radiant Development Team,

My name is Ismail Tasdelen. I am a security researcher. I found the xss security vulnerability stored on blog posting stored. And I want to report to you.

After I fix the weakness, I want the video to be published. You could provide a security clear CVE number.

Besides, is it possible to pay for a security investigation?

Software : Radiant

XSS Payload : "><img src=x onerror=alert('ismailtasdelen')>

I'm using to config.action_controller.asset_host in my config/environments/production.rb to serve images from another subdomain. But <r:asset:flash /> is still using relative URLs, not the domain specified in the config.
Hi All,

I make edits to the website www.rochesterrehab.org which uses Radiant CMS. However, when I received some edits today and tried to go to the website there was a message:

The www.rochesterrehab.org page isn’t working

www.rochesterrehab.org didn’t send any data.
ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE

The same message appeared when attempting to go to the admin login screen for the website. I have no idea how to get the site back up and running so I thought this would be a good place to start. Could anyone point me in the right direction?

Any help is appreciated!
