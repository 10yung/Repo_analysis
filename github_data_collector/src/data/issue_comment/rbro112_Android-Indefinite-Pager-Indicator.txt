There is space showing between horizontal recycler view indicator in high density pixel devices.
see #36
updated 
- androidx, 
- kotlin 1.3.50 
- gradle 5.6.1
- added viewpager2 support
getting a KotlinNullPointerException: 
` kotlin.KotlinNullPointerException 
at com.rbrooks.indefinitepagerindicator.IndefinitePagerIndicator.attachToViewPager(IndefinitePagerIndicator.kt:220)`

When using in  java code 
`indefinitePagerIndicator.attachToViewPager(null);`

Could it be an issue with java in combination with kotlin?

Current work around is using:
`indefinitePagerIndicator.attachToRecyclerView(null);`
Seems like not working when having only few items, dots are multiplying, also you have some count!! which causes crashes, should prob be changed to count?:0 which will provide a null safe case.
When the `reverseLayout` flag is enabled the indicator doesn't behave properly

## Task
Migrate to Android X

## Description
- Updates the library to AndroidX 

## How can this PR be tested?
The sample should be up and running as usual. ðŸ˜ƒ
(We should probably add tests for the lib itself)

## Additional comments
This addresses @kibotu's PR since it was not updated. But the credit goes to him! 
Thanks @kibotu!

How can I customize this view when it's creating programmatically? How to change dots colors, size, count,  for example?
We would like to add tests to ensure the library keeps working when someone proposes/wants to:

- Develop a new feature
- Fix a bug
Any chance it could support custom layout manager, I'm using a custom layout manager, and it throws an error telling me my LayoutManager can not be cast to LinearLayoutManager.
