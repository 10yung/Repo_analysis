> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Tracked this down as far as https://github.com/uProxy/uProxy-p2p/commit/bf84a1da1#diff-577a38088cbf76d9fd7b3bdbb6ca3d26R157
The flow stops with the progress bar running forever if there's an error in the DO calls.
On mobile, when you click the "create server" button, the UI freezes. I believe the key generation is CPU intensive and happens in the UI thread. We may need to run it on a Web Worker.
In the last step of the cloud launcher, we should present a link that the user can click and add the server, in case they ran the launcher on their mobile browser. It's hard to add the server otherwise.
In the last step of the cloud launcher, we should present a QR code so the user can add the server from their phone if the launcher is run on desktop.

<!-- Reviewable:end -->

When I open `uproxy.org/invite` urls on my Nexus 5 I don't get the menu to pick uProxy as the app.
Same is happening now with my dev phone. In fact, this stopped working before, and then it started working again, and now it's not working anymore. I'm not sure why.

This may helpmaking the url interception more robust: https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/index.html
** Discussed with Ben, Vinicius and Cassidy **

If the user DOES NOT have the uProxy app installed (the majority of cases), the link that we will ask them to click through will take them to the Play Store, and the server will be automagically added to the app by virtue of the referrer data passed along to the Play Store.

If the user DOES have the app installed, we need a way for the user to add the server to it. The link mentioned above will not work because they already have the app. Right now the app doesn't have a way to add servers to itself. It's on those instances that we would like to have a link that actually does the magic of adding the server to the app.

**Phase 1**: Support users who are on mobile devices
We want the access code to be coded on a "uproxy://" prefix, so that hopefully it will not be opened by the browser and will instead be managed by the uProxy app. This covers users receiving the invite code through instant messaging applications, SMS or email (provided they open the email on their mobile device). We will message users that they can only open this link when on their mobile devices.

**Phase 2**: Support users who are on desktop
For them, the uproxy:// link will clearly not work. Instead, for those users, we we want to display a QR code. QR codes will entice the user to grab the phone and point it towards the computer. The QR code will translate into the uproxy:// url mentioned above -- but since at that point it will be opened on the mobile device with the app, that will work.

Sidenote on Phase 2: Right now, given the length of the invite link, generating a QR code for it means having a rather large and detailed image. Prior to launching a QR code approach, we will probably want to have worked on shortening the invite links.
