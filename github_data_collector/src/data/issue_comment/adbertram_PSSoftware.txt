The module contains [`Import-Certificate`](https://github.com/adbertram/PSSoftware/blob/master/PSSoftware.psm1#L576) which is a built-in command for Windows PowerShell in Windows 8 and above. So trying to install this module fails with the below error due to this.

It would better to either remove the command from the module or rename it where it will not overwrite the local command.

```
06-08 21:26:13 C:\WINDOWS\system32> install-module pssoftware
PackageManagement\Install-Package : The following commands are already available on this system:'Import-Certificate'.
This module 'PSSoftware' may override the existing commands. If you still want to install this module 'PSSoftware',
use -AllowClobber parameter.

Probably not of much concern as PS6 is cross platform, and the module is decidedly not. Would still be good to be able to load it in PS6 if so desired.

Things that are known to not work in PS6:
Compare-FilePath
Compare-File
Get-MyFileHash
Anything that uses wmiobject calls.
Tell VS Code to use Allman style braces, and tabs instead of spaces.

This will prevent VS Code from breaking the code due to an issue with end of line comments: https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/issues/826

Also ensures that formatting stays consistent.
