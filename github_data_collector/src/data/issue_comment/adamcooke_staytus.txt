Hi Adam,
I was using this status page project to create a customer facing page where the user can see updates status of services, and had a few questions about how to make enhancements to the code so that I can modify this according to my requirements.
Where do I make changes in the code 
1)to pull service status periodically 
2)to update the status of a service  
3) how to access Staytus page via a URL

Please respond to my questions at the earliest. Appreciate your help with this!
Thanks,
Apoorva
Hi, does have any plan to use third-party mail delivery services in the future Instead of the default SMTP? SMTP looks like it's not multi threaded
