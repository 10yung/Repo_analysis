This plugin stoped working after tmux commit
    https://github.com/tmux/tmux/commit/f8ad72b2eeafc1146c116f73194a3950aa0c2143

It worked at tmux commit ec151b79ec672fac04db3305a161bcd67e22bbb7
   https://github.com/tmux/tmux/commit/ec151b79ec672fac04db3305a161bcd67e22bbb7

The commits in between involve changes related to how per-pane options are handled, which is used by this plugin.
Hi, this seems to be basically the same issue as #48 except while that issue has been fixed, the same issue is still present with the git status file matching.

Without telling grep that we've finished providing arguments, the search query will be interpreted as an argument to grep.
Since b4e30b47165489102f3e2cb824968e964f78ab28 tmux does not start anymore, if the locale `en_US@UFT-8` is not locally available:
```shell
tmux: need UTF-8 locale (LC_CTYPE) but have ANSI_X3.4-1968
```

It is common for non-English setups to lack the above locale. Thus it would be nice to either present a better error message in such a case or (much better) use a more suitable locale (e.g. `C.UTF-8`).

Thank you for your time!
I tried to use it on byobu, if I press ctrl-a I get the copycat search but then i enter anything and nothing works

In fact, when I press ctrl-a (I suppose it's that wtf key called "prefix"), it opens a small thing in the upper right corner to scroll up.


Anyone made it work with byobu?
The feature requested is similar to the behavior of _n_ j / _n_ k for vi/vim where _n_ is the number of steps upwards or downwards. Finally, a plus would be the possibility of typing nn to jump to the first match and NN to jump to the last match.



Minor cleanup addition, see https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-copycat/pull/122#issuecomment-356942523.
- Fix support for matching quotes in URLs
- Don't match whitespace before file paths
- grep -P is needed

This solves one of the issues I've commented at:

- https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-copycat/pull/134#issuecomment-447623916

I'm finally getting this all fixed! Locally at least :)

- Associated tmux-open pull-request: https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-open/pull/38
My prompt matches both path and numeric seaches:
```

```
I use this for auditing purposes, along with logging. 

While it would be possible to introspect the $PROMPT/$PS1 and figure out what to ignore, I'd be happy with being able to specify a regex to ignore as well. 
In fact, that may provide better flexibility for unforeseen use cases.
