### Bug description
On the messages view the header (containing the other user's name, number, etc.) overlaps the top of the messages.
You can see the content when you touch and drag the content down, but as soon as you let go it snaps back up behind the header.

### Steps to reproduce
- Start a new message with anyone 
- Observe the top header

**Actual result:** The Header overlaps the underlying content (in this case the `Add to contacts` button. Touch-and-drag to scroll up and you see that the content is correctly loaded, but you cannot maintain visibility after ending the touch

**Expected result:** The full content should be visible without touch.

### Bug description
Hello, 
I don't know if it is a bug or intentional but when recording a voice message it stops recording when rotating the screen.

### Steps to reproduce
-Start recording a Voice Message without locking the recording.
-Turn your phone in order to rotate the screen.

**Actual result:** The current recording will stop.

**Expected result:** It would be great if the Signal app would turn of the screen rotation feature while recording in order to prevent the cancelling mentioned above.

### Bug description
Signal is constantly crashing and making my iPhone unusable. The dialog "Signal crashed. Do you want to submit a bug report?" opens up every second and I can't dismiss it. Signal (and my phone in general) is unusable like that.

### Steps to reproduce
I have no idea.
Edit: After using Signal Desktop (writing, sending stickers, ...), Signal iOS crashes constantly. I can neither dismiss the dialog nor file a bug report, my phone is unusable like that. Only restarting helps.
Edit2: Signal is working fine again after restarting. I have no idea where the problem is, but there was a problem for sure and it happened a few times until now.

### Bug description

When I try to delete a long/large conversation, Signal is stuck. The only feedback I get is my phone warming up considerably. The conversation is never deleted, at least not during my several attempts where I kept the phone in this state (on, (stuck) Signal active) for 15-30 minutes. When I then closed Signal and reopened it, it crashed the first time. When I opened it the second time, it worked again, but the conversation was not deleted. iPhone storage settings also reports no change for Signal.

### Steps to reproduce

- Delete a long/large conversation
- Wait (keeping Signal open)

**Actual result:** Conversation not deleted / deletion does not complete within 30 minutes.

**Expected result:** Conversation should be deleted within seconds or a few minutes. Process should show progress. Process should be at least incremental, i.e. delete as long as Signal open (which seems not the case given that Signal storage usage is not affected).

### Device info

**Signal version:** latest App Store version by today

### Bug description

Getting the dreaded “No available session for contact” error with a single contact. This only happens with a single contact and that contact has iPad and iOS devices linked. 

I just changed SIMs in a foreign country and was briefly using a VPN for part of the conversation, but I’m able to message other users who do not have a conversation across multiple synced devices without issue. Mentioning these two just in case. 

Deleting message history didn’t resolve the issue for this specific contact. 

Filed a new report per request on #1939.

### Steps to reproduce

Send a message. 

**Actual result:** Get an error on every message. 

**Expected result:** No errors. 

### Screenshots
