Is it possible to access LinkLiar with a script (such as AppleScript)? I tried looking at it with the accessibility inspector program but I can't seem to get it to work. Basically my use case is that I would like my MAC address to always be random unless I'm at my university, because for the Wi-Fi to work there they require registration with a MAC address and I'd rather not be re-registering my computer every time I connect.

What I would like to do is location based MAC address changing, such as turning it to my manually defined address whenever I'm on their network. I can detect location based changes (or SSID changes) with Little Snitch Profiles, and I'd just like to make those changes using LinkLiar rather than having to manually click it and paste a MAC address in.
Does this app start spoofing my MAC address as soon as I restart my laptop? Or do I have to start the app first? (sorry didnt know where else to post questions)
Example, randomize MAC but make it always under Dell vendor
