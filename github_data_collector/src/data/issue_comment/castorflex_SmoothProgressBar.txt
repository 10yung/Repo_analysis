i am getting Error inflating class fr.castorflex.android.circularprogressbar.CircularProgressBar error.
i am using AS 3.2.1, gradle plugin 3.1.0 and buildtoolsversion 27.0.3. Can someone help with this issue.
tried setting android.enableAapt2=false. AS says aapt2=false is deprecated
Bug line: fr.castorflex.android.smoothprogressbar.SmoothProgressBar.<init> (SmoothProgressBar.java:88)
Android version: 4.4.2
I am planning to use this lovely library in my Android App.

But the issue I am facing is that Stroke size is not increasing even after setting it to increase. The size of the Stroke is same even If I set to 50dp or 150dp.

Is there any way to increase it ?
Migrate to GradleMavenPush https://github.com/Vorlonsoft/GradleMavenPush

Reasons: 
- Old plugin don't have updates for 4 years
- Better javadocs generation
- Better pom file generation
- Smaller gradle.properties
- You can easy migrate from Maven Central to JCenter by adding to your code `IS_JCENTER = true` only and register at https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter
Can we use this in determinate mode? and set custom progress programmatically. if yes, how to do this ??
What can be done?
Always shows error inflating on line 37.
As "compile" is going to be deprecated end-2018, this PR replaces with "implementation" that is the new usage.
Hi , There doesn't seem to be a way to properly set the colour of the CircularProgressDrawable.
I have set the defaullt colour is blue in my xmlï¼š

                   <fr.castorflex.android.circularprogressbar.CircularProgressBar
                            android:id="@+id/loading_status"
                            android:layout_width="117dp"
                            android:layout_height="117dp"
                            android:indeterminate="true"
                            app:cpb_color="@color/blue"
                            android:layout_centerInParent="true"/>

      loadingView.setIndeterminateDrawable(new   CircularProgressDrawable.Builder(mContext).color(getResources().getColor(R.color.green)).build());

but it seems not work,please help me ,thank you
