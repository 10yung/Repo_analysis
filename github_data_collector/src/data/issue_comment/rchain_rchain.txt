## Overview
As the title says, this PR replaces the `raiseError` channel of `F[_]` with an explicit error channel implemented as a `Ref[F, Option[Throwable]]`. The `raiseError` behavior in the reducer would previously cross concurrent boundaries, thus resulting in non-deterministic thread cancellation, thus resulting in pesky concurrency bugs. Basically, if the process is `P | Q`, and `P` throws an error, `raiseError` is used to short-circuit `P`. What's different now is that instead of letting `raiseError` try to cancel `Q`, we use a `Ref` to signal to `Q` that an error has been thrown. This is obviously not replayable; it assumes a deployment policy wherein any program that throws an error elects to forfeit all of the REV that the deployment is allocated.

## Overview
Exploratory deploy allows clients to get data from the blockchain. Exploratory deploy is executed on top of the last finalized block. Future versions will support custom block hash and other nice features.
**Method can be executed only on read-only RNode**.

TODO: exploratory deploy is for now only exposed on Web API.

The sample JS code to make exploratory deploy through Web API:
**Return channel is the first created unforgeable name**.
```js
const url = 'http://localhost:40403/api/explore-deploy'
const req = {
  method: 'POST',
  body: `new return in { return!(42) }`
}
fetch(url, req).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
// Returns `42` as Rholang AST (Seq[Par])
```
