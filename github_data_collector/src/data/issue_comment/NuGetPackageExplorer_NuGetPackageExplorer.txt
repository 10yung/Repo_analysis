**Type**: Bug
**NPE version**: 5.5.28+9a3863db20
**OS version**: Windows 10 1903
**Installed from**: Chocolatey.org

A .nupkg whose path has spaces does not open when double clicked. NPE launches but does not open the package. It seems caused by an un-quoted path in the default value of this registry key: `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Classes\Nuget.Package\Shell\Open\Command\`.

This should be fixed by dd695ea1d89cc7dad2effd24790781cee6667f96, and I see that change in the installed "C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\NugetPackageExplorer\ChocolateyInstall.ps1", but my registry key value doesn't have the quotes. I even tried deleting the key and doing a clean install.

**Workaround:** Edit that registry key's "(default)" value, putting double quotes around the `$1`.

This may be a regression of #835.
When a faulty package contains a duplicated file, NPE doesn't show it (FodyCommon.dll in this example):

 - Why do we need it?

I was trying to upload a package to nuget.org and got the following warning: 

> We found the following issue(s):
    The licenseUrl element is deprecated. Consider using the license element instead. We recommend that you fix these issues and upload a new package. 

However there currently does not seem to be a GUI-Control for inputting the license directly.
Microsoft describes the new tag [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/finding-and-choosing-packages#license-url-deprecation).

 - Please provide an use case.

Creating a package and uploading it to nuget.org without warning.

Thank you for your time.
Currently the cache key for the package icons in `IconUrlToImageCacheConverter` is the url. Now that NuGet.org maps and stores a private copy of the images, we can't assume that the image url from the metadata matches the image url from the package.

We should update the cache key mechanism to key off of the package id and version so that we get the same cache result regardless of whether we open from the metadata url or from the package url for a particular package id/version combo.


In the package chooser dialog, the icons look blurry.

Maybe there's something we can do with the decoding/scaling? These are all from `IconUrlToImageCacheConverter`

-> usage of MultiSelectTreeView extension of basic TreeView element
-> overriden TreeView style for better selection of items (PackageViewer.xaml)
-> adjusted delete functionality for multi selection

Multi selection in Package Content List was implemented. I was thinking also to disable other options (allow just delete) in ContextMenu's, but I was unable to bind it well into model (if it will be requested, I can work it out). I focused on availability of multiselection for delete purposes, as was described in Issue (https://github.com/NuGetPackageExplorer/NuGetPackageExplorer/issues/805).
