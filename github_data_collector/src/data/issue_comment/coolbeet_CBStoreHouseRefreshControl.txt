CBStoreHouseRefreshControl support add to Footer?
Please any idea.
In the initializator method - attachToScrollView the color is being passed as a param but later it is not used.

Instead a white color is harcoded:

BarItem *barItem = [[BarItem alloc] initWithFrame:refreshControl.frame startPoint:startPoint endPoint:endPoint color:[UIColor whiteColor] lineWidth:lineWidth];

while this should be:

BarItem *barItem = [[BarItem alloc] initWithFrame:refreshControl.frame startPoint:startPoint endPoint:endPoint color:color lineWidth:lineWidth];




Sometimes it is necessary to manually display the loading (say if we have remote data already being downloaded).

Fix the bug of tableViewHeader position caused by contentInset.#10

Hello,

After triying this, it seems that it does not support when the navigation controller it set to hidden. Would love to try this but only will work form me if you could add this feature.

```
(void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated
{
    [super viewWillAppear:YES];    
    [self.navigationController setNavigationBarHidden:YES animated:YES];
}
```

thank u
