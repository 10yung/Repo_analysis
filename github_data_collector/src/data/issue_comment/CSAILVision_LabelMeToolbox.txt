Hi, I've been trying to understand what the output parameters of the function CWM.m mean (https://github.com/CSAILVision/LabelMeToolbox/blob/master/features/CWM.m) but I can't find any documentation. I also ran the code to see if the result helped me understand but it didn't. Could you help me understand what [fv,p,mx,Cx,Cy,b] are? Thanks a lot!

Is it possible to query from the dataset without having a specific object in mind? Alternatively, is there a known way to randomly sample from the dataset?

Thanks!

I have been using this tool to annotate images.
Unfortunately the web-based tool differs significantly from the Matlab code in terms of how it converts polygons to pixel maps. The LMobjectmask function makes use of Matlab's poly2mask. This function does not allow self-intersection of objects and removes pixels that are covered twice by the same object. This is not the case for the web tool.

It would be very helpful if you could provide Matlab code that matches what the annotators see in the web tool.

I am trying to create a local index for using the images offline. However, I run into an error when I follow the steps supplied here 

```
 http://labelme.csail.mit.edu/Release3.0/br...ols/php/dataset.php
```

below "Option 2: Access the online database directly with the LabelMe Matlab toolbox". When I run the line that creates a local index,

```
 D = LMdatabase(HOMEANNOTATIONS); 
```

it gives me the following error: 

```
Error using str2num (line 32)
Requires string or character array input.

Error in LMdatabase (line 239)
                    v.annotation.object(m).id =
                    str2num(v.annotation.object(m).id);
```

Could someone help me fix this? 

Thank you!

I want to label my pictures  my own without web,but I don't know if this tool can help me with it.
