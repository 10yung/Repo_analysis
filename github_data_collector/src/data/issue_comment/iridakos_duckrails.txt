Hello,

I'm trying to retrieve a value from a request header for using at **body content** section for my response. The request header the client sends looks like it:
`Authorization: 123#abc`

Then, at **body content** section at DuckRails, I tried to read that value this way:
`var header = headers['Authorization'].split('#')[1];`

But when I test the response I get a 200 Ok, but with this error:

`Duckrails-Error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'split' of undefined`

Am I reading the headers in a wrong way?



```
docker run --name=example_iridakos.duckrails.release-v2.1.5 -v=/Users/krystian.panek/Projects/gradle-aem-multi/duckrails:/opt/duckrails/db -p=8080:80 --rm iridakos/duckrails:release-v2.1.5

```

but when I use just `duckrails` on the left side of volume it works.

```
docker run --name=example_iridakos.duckrails.release-v2.1.5 -v=duckrails:/opt/duckrails/db -p=8080:80 --rm iridakos/duckrails:release-v2.1.5
```

still when using absolute path or relative path, in both cases seems that volume is working / file `duckrails/production.sqlite3` is created... so that seems that is is something wrong later on DuckRails runtime side.

this is blocking me in case of using Duckrails on Windows on which I need to support Docker Toolbox in which absolute volume paths usage is essential.

it would be nice to have it fixed :)

Where do I find this log that the message says.

Hello,

I often dupplicate manually many endpoints containing long headers. Which takes very long to copy past to a new one.

It would be great to have a button in a "mock", allowing to "dupplicate a mock".
A modal would show asking which name we want to save the mock as.

Thanks !
DuckRails 2.1.9
Running on Docker

I was just playing around, and wanted to dynamically change responses headers. When I tried returning a JSON object with a `headers` key I get a 500: "We're sorry, but something went wrong".

To validate that I was writing the JS correctly, I just grabbed your example code for the response body, added the headers key and returned it.

Here is the code 

```
var date = new Date();
date.setDate(date.getDate() -  Math.floor(Math.random() * 30 + 1) );

var obj = {
 "headers":{
       "current_page": Math.floor((Math.random() * 456) + 1),
        "started_reading": date.toDateString()
   }
}

return JSON.stringify(obj);
```

Expected: Headers would now have a `current_page` and `started_reading` key in my curl.

Actual: Return code 500, HTML with 
```
<div class="dialog">
    <div>
      <h1>We're sorry, but something went wrong.</h1>
    </div>
    <p>If you are the application owner check the logs for more information.</p>
  </div>
```
Is possible run request http with javascript into responseBody the of mock? I need to import other lib for decrypt content responseBody.
[dummy-json](https://github.com/webroo/dummy-json) is a useful template engine that lets you create dummy json data very easily
Hi guys, 

I'm wondering, if there is any way to log body of incomming requests? 

Thank you in advance.
