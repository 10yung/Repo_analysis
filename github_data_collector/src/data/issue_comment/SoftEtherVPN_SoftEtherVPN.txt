### Prerequisites

* [X] Can you reproduce?
* [X] Are you running the latest version of SoftEtherVPN?

**SoftEther version:** Ver 4.32, Build 9731, beta
**Component:** Client
**Operating system:** Linux (ubuntu 18.04) on server, Windows 10 on client
**Architecture:** 64 bit
**Processor:** Surface Pro 7, Intel i7-1065G7 CPU

### Description

When establishing a VPN connection with the SoftEther VPN Client Manager, there is no connection to the Internet - i.e. after activating the connection, when hovering over the connection details it is displayed that the VPN user ("userWindows") cannot connect to the Wifi network ("TP-Link_XYZ"):

> TP-Link_XYZ
> Internet access
> 
> userWindows
> No Internet access
> 

**Expected behavior:**
Establishing VPN connection maintains the Internet connection and websites can be accessed.  

**Actual behavior:**
VPN connection fails to connect to the Internet and websites cannot be accessed.
 
### Steps to reproduce

1. Setup Ubuntu 18.04 server (Standard B1ms with 1 vcpus, 2 GiB memory)

2. Enable SSH and set password

4. Follow the steps described in a [YouTube Video by Aman Juman starting from minute 5:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9157KFBPdc) to setup the SoftEther Server and Client

5. Connect to VPN with SoftEther client on Surface 7 laptop with Windows 10
Guys I was thinking into a build a webapp to admin the server by the new API, but the docker images that I found it's for the RTM versions but not for the beta.

It's possible to get docker image for the beta so I can try to make the web ui for it?
### Prerequisites

* [X] Can you reproduce?
* [X] Are you running the latest version of SoftEtherVPN?

**SoftEther version:** 5.0.1 Build 9672
**Component:** Server
**Operating system:** Linux
**Architecture:** ARM

**Processor:** Broadcom BCM2837
(The server is running on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.)

### Description

When the VPN server has no security log files and the file switch cycle is disabled, they are not automatically created.

**Expected behavior:**
From my observation, a log file with no timestamp in its name (i.e. "sec.log") should be created initially after an event.

**Actual behavior:**
No security log files are created.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Delete any [log] files in your security log folder.
2. Enable Security Logs (if not done so already), and have the "Log File Switch Cycle" setting set to "No Switching."
3. Execute an action that would trigger a security event (e.g. toggle the virtual hub status etc.)
4. Observe the log file list (don't forget to refresh), and repeat a few times to be sure.

SoftEther version:4.29
Component:Client 4.3.2-9731
Operating system: macOS

-------------------
bug: macos softether-vpnclient can connect server , but but virtual network adapter not getting IP address from server. I can see a session in my server . I cannot access my Internal server. but windows softether-vpnclient can access my Internal server.

1、pull tuntap driver and install
2、reboot
3、install client uncompress file 
4、cd dir
5、make
6、./vpnclient start
7、./vpncmd /cmd niccreate vpnnic
8、accountcreate

There is any bug in softether-vpnclient macos? Or What have I forgotten

Hi, 

as far as I understand, upload/download bandwidth limit is restricted to 2^32 -1 bps. This is about 4Gbps. In 100M/1G era, 4Gbps limit was high enough because physical bandwidth limit was 100Mbps/1Gbps. Now 10G era is coming. The 4Gbps limit is a little bit low.

Of course SoftEther's throughput might not be fast enough to configure bandwidth limit more than 4Gbps. However, software limit should not be lower than hardware limit.

What about starting thinking about expanding these 32bit uint limit?

I know SoftEther both supports 32bit & 64bit architecture, the expansion would be available only on 64bit environment.

**SoftEther version:** all
**Component:** [both Client & Server]
**Operating system:** all
**Architecture:** [64 bit]

Hello,

   Though the WebUI feature on the latest version of SoftEther is marvelous, such feature prevents me from setting up a web server as SoftEther allocates port 443 for management. Could anyone please tell me how I can disable the WebUI? I cannot find a way to disable it on the latest version of the SoftEther VPN Server Manager.


Hope to get your reply soon.

Thanks! Much appreciated!

Regards,


Andy
### Prerequisites

* [ yes ] Can you reproduce?
* [ yes ] Are you running the latest version of SoftEtherVPN?

**SoftEther version:** 5.01 Build 9672
**Component:** Server
**Operating system:** Linux
**Architecture:** 64 bit

### Description

It's found that support of TLS 1.0 is disabled in Developer Edition of SoftEther VPN. This causes some Windows clients to fail when connecting via SSTP protocol. Same clients work fine with stable version.

I found

`c->SslAcceptSettings.Tls_Disable1_0 = CfgGetBool(f, "Tls_Disable1_0");`

in src/Cedar/Server.c and expected to enable support of TLS 1.0 by adding

`bool Tls_Disable1_0 false`

but server silently ignores this option and even doesn't write it back to config.

**Expected behavior:**
`bool Tls_Disable1_0 false` should work as expected

**Actual behavior:**
Server silently ignores this option.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Try to connect from Windows client to SSTP using TLS 1.0 only (with disabled TLS 1.2 in registry) - failed
2. Try to connect from Windows client to SSTP using TLS 1.2 - worked.
3. Try to add config option mentioned above to vpn_server.confg - server silently ignores it.

Hello,

I have installed SoftEther on DigitalOcean droplet by following [this guide](https://miff2000.github.io/blog/2017/05/18/softether-multi-protocol-vpn-server.html)

Droplet: Ubuntu 18.04.3. 2GB RAM. 
SoftEther: 4.31-9727-beta-2019.11.18.x64
Clients: Windows 10 x64 and Android 9

If not connected to VPN, my throughput is around 14 Mbps. When connected to VPN it is around 1 Mbps.

I have tried both SSTP and SoftEther client.

DigitalOcean graphs shows that the CPU utilization has never reached above %7.5 and Bandwidth utilization is 500 kbps max. RAM usage by vpnserver is less than %3.

My PC and phone are connected to ADSL mode. I am not behind any firewall or NAT.

I have a paid VPN account too and the provider is using SoftEther as server. When I connect to that, there is no significant impact on throughput.

Please help.
User sometimes needn't to save the log - especially in client, the log in client sometimes have an issue of leak such as WHEN connected to a VPN, WHAT the IP is, and usually waste lots of storage space. Could also encrypt the log (AES-256) , only several person such as administration know the password could visit it, and make a configuration to clear them easily. 
Hello,
Especially for certificate-based VPN connections, I think it would be useful to add as functionality the possibility to choose when creating these connections whether it is exportable or not.
Or an option (checkbox) at the "Setting locker" that would prevent the export of all connections would be also welcome. 
Or another way to protect the unauthorized export of connections from SoftEther Client.
Kind regards,
Bogdan
