Hi, please help me with my problem. In my project, I have a tablet that uses soft deletion and etrepat/baum. If the element is deleted and I unload the element with withTrashed and use a function for example getRoot(), then it returns null. How to solve this problem.
laravel: **6.0**
buam: **2.0.0-alpha1**

i realized that the usaual default column names no longer work
```php
protected $parentColumn = 'parent_id';
protected $leftColumn = 'lft';
protected $rightColumn = 'rgt';
protected $depthColumn = 'depth';
protected $orderColumn = 'name';
```
seems they have been changed to

```php
protected $parentColumnName = 'parent_id';
protected $leftColumnName = 'lft';
protected $rightColumnName = 'rgt';
protected $depthColumnName = 'depth';
protected $orderColumnName = 'name';
```
Laravel: **6.0**
Baum:  **2.0.0-alpha1**

i had to check the codebase and i realized that some portion of codes were commented out. actually this bit here https://github.com/etrepat/baum/blob/v2/src/NestedSet/Concerns/Relatable.php#L27-L45

```
    // /**
    //  * Inmmediate descendants relation. Alias for "children".
    //  *
    //  * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany
    //  */
    // public function immediateDescendants()
    // {
    //     return $this->children();
    // }
    // /**
    //  * Attribute alias so as to eager-load the proper relationship.
    //  *
    //  * @return mixed
    //  */
    // public function getImmediateDescendantsAttribute()
    // {
    //     return $this->getRelationValue('children');
    // }

```

the way i was able to get around this challenges were to override that function or rather duplicate it into my own class that inherited the **Buam/Node** by doing this below.
```php
      /**
      * Inmmediate descendants relation. Alias for "children".
      *
      * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany
      */
     public function immediateDescendants()
     {
         return $this->children();
     }
```

Add Laravel 6.* Support
The composer dependencies require laravel "5.*"
Please update composer.json to the following:
```js
  "require": {
    "php": ">=5.4.0",
    "illuminate/console": "5.*||6.*",
    "illuminate/database": "5.*||6.*",
    "illuminate/events": "5.*||6.*",
    "illuminate/filesystem": "5.*||6.*",
    "illuminate/support": "5.*||6.*"
  }
```
correction on child 2.1 and child 2.2
see https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/upgrade
Please update for Laravel 5.8
In my seeder file I was trying to create multiple tree in same table, but it seems the previous tree will be deleted and only one last tree was created in the table.
