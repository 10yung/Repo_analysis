I too am seeing this issue, though reading though the other replies to uninstall Homebridge from the foillowing:

> Remove this one /homebridge/node_modules/homebridge.
> 
> Do so by running this in the container:
> 
> npm uninstall homebridge

`[1/16/2020, 3:43:30 AM] [Config] Multiple Instances Of Homebridge Found Installed
[1/16/2020, 3:43:30 AM] [Config] /homebridge/node_modules/homebridge
[1/16/2020, 3:43:30 AM] [Config] /usr/local/lib/node_modules/homebridge `

My issue is that if I modify the configuration, it modifies the files in  /homebridge/node_modules/homebridge, so Im hesitant to delete/uninstall that one?

Thanks!

When trying to install a plugin directly from a tar.gz file per instructions [posted here](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge/issues/254#issuecomment-562915302), installation fails with numerous errors: 

```

```

Installation of the plugin after uncompressing the tar.gz file succeeds, but gets overwritten when Homebridge restarts.
