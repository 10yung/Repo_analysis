# Read the configuration from the file for CLI.
**Example:**
`swimat -c .swimat.json`
`swimat --config ./.config.swimat.json`

by default, the tool will use `.swimat.json` if exist

**config example** 
```json
{
    "areParametersAligned": true,
    "areSemicolonsRemoved": true
}
```

**Motivation**
- CLI tool can't read UserDefault settings that were set up via App
- Sometimes need settings per project with ignoring local settings for automation through the build phase 


Can you indent switch cases like the xcode when you select it in Text editing preferences.
On alternative can be a option in Swimat settings.

I tried editing your code with some success and a little bug with the break keyword after the break it will add another indent to the next case.

    var checkInCase = false
        if indent.inSwitch {
            if isNext(word: "case") {
                checkInCase = true
                indent.count += 1
                indent.inCase = true
            } else if isNext(word: "default") || isNext(word: "@unknown") || isNext(word: "break") {
                indent.extra -= 1
            }
        }

Another suggestion it's the break be at the same level as the case but this is just a opinion
Same issue here, on macOS 10.14.6 Xcode 10.3
Everything above tried, doesn't help.

To be honest I was hoping to have my code remain consistent and correct my braces if I've forgotten and put them on the next line, which I have a habit of doing in other languages.

I'm disappointed that Swimat doesn't correctly move braces on the previous line.

Is this something that could be considered?

Using Swimat Version 1.6.2 (20) with XCode 10.1. 

The following is a Swimat output when not using a trailing closure.

```swift
        Observable.combineLatest(self.stepName,
            self.stepDuration,
            resultSelector: { name, duration -> Bool in
                return name?.count ?? 0 > 0 && duration > 0
            })
            .bind(to: self.isAddStepAllowed)
            .disposed(by: self.disposeBag)
```

Swimat correctly indents it, and keeps indentation consistent, which is great. However, if you were to replace `resultSelector` with a trailing closure, I'd expect an output to look similar to this:

```swift
        Observable.combineLatest(self.stepName,
            self.stepDuration) { name, duration -> Bool in
                return name?.count ?? 0 > 0 && duration > 0
            }
            .bind(to: self.isAddStepAllowed)
            .disposed(by: self.disposeBag)
```

But what actually happens is Swimat formatting it to this:

```swift
        Observable.combineLatest(self.stepName,
            self.stepDuration) { name, duration -> Bool in
            return name?.count ?? 0 > 0 && duration > 0
        } // notice how this block is less indented
            .bind(to: self.isAddStepAllowed)
            .disposed(by: self.disposeBag)
```
Can we save the position of text cursor when we formatting code?
**Feature request**
Make it possible to define a maximum line length, and automatically wrap lines which are too long, or combine short enough lines, similar to what clang-format does for objective-c and c++ code.
Swift has a new library for parsing source code called [libSyntax](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/master/lib/Syntax). I think we should use it for source code parsing since it should be much more durable to style variations.
How can make Swimat to remove blank lines from my code ?
Hey, it there any way to make format on save?

If yes, it would be good to put this info to readme as there are more people like me who searching for this feature.

Anyway, good pice of soft! :)
