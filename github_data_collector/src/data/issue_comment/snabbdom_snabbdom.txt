Fixes #471.
BREAKING CHANGE: UMD bundles are no longer provided.

Closes #498. Closes #514. Closes #481.
The two sets of build artifacts that this project provides — CommonJS and ES modules — are not being tested currently. Instead, karma-typescript builds its own bundle (likely in-memory) and that what is being tested.

https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom/blob/d4a8640132ceb135c21eeda84e2c0b58828eff5a/karma.conf.js#L17-L64
Fixes #543.
Closes #535.
Fixes #461.
And not just in CI.

Of course, there must be an easy way to disable this for debugging.
