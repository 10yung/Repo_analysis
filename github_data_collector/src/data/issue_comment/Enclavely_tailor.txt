I would like to enter text mode instead of visual-editor.
I tried the following method, but I could not enable text mode.

```
add_filter('tailor_editor_settings', function($editor_settings) {
  $editor_settings['teeny'] = true;
  $editor_settings['tinymce'] = false;
  return $editor_settings;
});
```

```
add_filter('wp_default_editor', function() {
  return 'html';
});
```

The wordpress version is 4.9.6,
And the theme used is Twenty Seventeen.

How do I enable text mode?
Thanks.

php version `PHP 7.1.16`
Tailor version `1.8.2`

Using the [Sample Extension](https://github.com/Enclavely/tailor-sample-extension) format, when I create or update controls, it seems I need to change the name of the `shortcode` and `class` in order for the changes to register with php.

Otherwise, `$atts` are updated in javascript, but in php, the old ones persist. Not sure what I'm doing wrong.

Add new element with setting and control:

```
class Tailor_New_Cool_Element extends Tailor_Element {

    /**
     * Registers element settings, sections and controls.
     *
     * @since 1.0.0
     * @access protected
     */
    protected function register_controls()
    {

        $priority = 20;

        $this->add_section('main', array(
            'title' => __('Main', 'tailor'),
            'priority' => $priority = 10,
        ));

        // Add as many custom settings as you like..
        $this->add_setting('title', array(
            'sanitize_callback' => 'tailor_sanitize_text',
            'default' => 'Main title',
        ));
        $this->add_control('title', array(
            'label' => __('Title'),
            'type' => 'text',
            'section' => 'main',
            'priority' => $priority += 10,
        ));

        $card_front_control_types = array(
            'text'
        );
        $card_front_control_arguments = array();
        tailor_control_presets($this, $card_front_control_types, $card_front_control_arguments, $priority);

    }
}
```
And the shortcode:

```
if ( ! function_exists( 'tailor_shortcode_new_cool_element' ) ) {

    function tailor_shortcode_new_cool_element( $atts, $content = null, $tag ) {

        /**
         * some other code...
         */

        ob_start();

        print_r( $atts );
        $outer_html = "<div {$html_atts}>%s</div>";

        $content = ob_get_clean();
        $inner_html = '<div class="tailor-new-cool__content">%s</div>';

        $html = sprintf( $outer_html, sprintf( $inner_html, $content ) );

        return $html;
    }

    add_shortcode( 'tailor_new_cool', 'tailor_shortcode_new_cool_element' );
}
``` 

And register:

```
// Within Tailor_Extension class
 function register_elements( $element_manager ) {
            $element_manager->add_element( 'tailor_new_cool', array(
                'label'             =>  __( 'New Cool' ),
                'description'       =>  __( 'Add a cool thing' ),
                'badge'             =>  __( 'Intensity' ),
                'type'              =>  'wrapper',
                'child_container'   =>  '.tailor-new-cool__content',
            ) );
}
```

If I update the `title` control to say, `heading`, `$atts` still hold `title`. I imagine it's something obvious.
### Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to any existing page's edit screen.
1. Change the title and update the page.
1. Tailor the page - make any change and save it.
1. Go back to edit screen, see title is reverted to previous title.

This is due to this function: https://github.com/Enclavely/tailor/blob/fd69c688257500d6b633795c41e0a34097fa7c1d/includes/class-panels.php#L384-L394

I'm unclear at the moment on what the _best_ way to address this. Current working theory is that it probably makes sense to hook into post title changes and update the `_post_title` meta key so they stay synced in both directions.

Hey, I really love your plugin!

I'm using sandstorm.io to build wordpress sites.  For some reason, the editor doesn't consistently startup for me.  What can I do to start debugging this issue?
Hello Tailor Team,

I have extended Tailor_Element class with other elements but the problem is these element's model window have more than 3 tabs which result as the following:
![tailoring_ home - google chrome 2017-12-21 18 35 26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7535526/34265372-51d41ee0-e67e-11e7-869e-a54f4ac0fee8.png)

## Solution using pure CSS:
1 - Changing .modal__content position to relative instead of absolute.
2 - Setting the top value to 0 for  .modal__content
3 - Setting overflow to hidden for .modal__content 
4 - Setting overflow to scroll for .modal__inner   
5 - Adding .modal__footer before the closing tag for .modal__content div

## Solution using Javascipt:
Using javascript to detect the top value for .modal__content depending on the number of section tabs.

## Solution using Javascript and CSS:
Adding extra class to model window if the tabs width is larger than the inner width then apply extra top value for .model__content using this class
I'm having rendering issues. Tailor appears to create the right separation between columns, at least when viewed in the page editor of the dashboard:
![screenshot from 2017-11-11 14-46-21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8691924/32692945-8d2c704a-c6ef-11e7-86ab-f973e4473ead.png)

But it doesn't actually visually place any of the content blocks into columns when I drag them alongside each other:

![peek 2017-11-11 14-48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8691924/32692971-0dc98c7e-c6f0-11e7-85a4-62cdc6c00fc8.gif)

The issue persists when saved and viewed outside of the tailor interface.

I'm on WP 4.8.3, with the latest release of Tailor (1.8.1). This issue crops up consistently across a few themes I tested: Twenty Fifteen, Twenty Sixteen, Twenty Seventeen, Hestia, Shoreditch, and Themelia. 
Tailor relies on the WordPress Heartbeat API for edit locking, but WP Engine and possibly other web hosts disable Heartbeat except on certain whitelisted WordPress core pages out of performance concerns. Tailor doesn't handle that scenario well and throws a cryptic error. It would be better to detect when the Heartbeat API is blocked (or detect WP Engine specifically) and either provide guidance to the user or use a possible workaround.

Other plugins also warn users of this quirk in documentation, for example: https://eventespresso.com/wiki/setup-wpengine-hosting-event-espresso/

When run on WP Engine, Tailor 1.8.1 throws an `Uncaught ReferenceError: sidebarApp is not defined` JavaScript console error in `canvas.js` when attempting to edit a page/post (`http://example.com/sample-page/?tailor=1`). The errors were different under Tailor 1.7.9 and earlier:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property ‘findWhere’ of undefined
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property ‘channel’ of undefined
```

When these errors crop up, Tailor just shows an all-gray screen with a perpetually spinning circle instead of its editor.

### Possible starting point for workaround implementation

Beyond warning the user, the plugin code below might offer a starting point for coding an automatic workaround for this issue. It provides an interface for whitelisting additional WP-Admin URLs that should be allowed to use the Heartbeat API:

https://github.com/PrysPlugins/WPE-Allow-Heartbeat

However, I haven't tested the plugin because WP Engine has already applied a blanket fix to my account.

### Background on WP Engine's Heartbeat blocking

Here's what WP Engine's support told me:

> The root cause of the issue is that by default, our must-use plugin disables heartbeat, so we have to manually enable it when issues like this happen. Just so that you're aware as well though, enabling heartbeat can potentially cause higher server load and thus lead to a higher load time for the site on the install. In this case though, since it's just related to the page builder plugin that shouldn't be much of a concern, it's generally only problematic if you have other plugins using heartbeat as well.

### Immediate fix for WP Engine users

Contact WP Engine's support (live chat is usually quick) and ask them to enable the Heartbeat API so you can use Tailor. They will have references to it in their internal support system.

### Possible DIY fix for WP Engine users

It might also be possible to install the whitelist plugin above (https://github.com/PrysPlugins/WPE-Allow-Heartbeat) and add Tailor-specific admin URLs to the whitelist to get this working without the help of WP Engine support in a pinch.
As far as I check, there is no way to extend the responsive breakpoint so at least you can add one more to core plugin like Bootstrap breakpoints.

For advanced layouts, we need more breakpoints. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/overview/
I have a carousel where I am displaying customer testimonials. There are 3 carousel items per row like this:
<img width="1031" alt="screen shot 2017-09-28 at 1 32 05 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5855545/30989171-a03011b2-a451-11e7-92bd-26121025dd0a.png">
When my screen goes below the mobile screen width set in customizer > tailor > layout I think the carousel items should go full width and only be 1 item per row similarly to how other elements do when they are within a `tailor-column` div.  

This looks very awkward on mobile, but I still want this content to show on mobile and not be hidden. And since the `tailor-carousel__item` has dynamically generated inline styling, I'm not having much success overriding the style with CSS.
<img width="534" alt="screen shot 2017-09-28 at 1 34 46 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5855545/30989303-16b21f1a-a452-11e7-948a-bd246b324c40.png">

I'm not sure if it also happens to you guys, but if you disable `tailor_save_content_as_html` the content of "Content" elements always revert back to default/placeholder after refreshing the canvas (not in the frontend, it's ok in the frontend).

Can someone confirm it?
