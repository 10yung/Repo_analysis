There is a behaviour on the current iOS version (11.4, not sure when this behaviour started) where if a collection view's layout is set after initialization - instead of it being passed inside `init(frame:collectionViewLayout:)` - the `collectionView` property will be set **twice**.

That is, if you do this
```swift
let collectionView = UICollectionView(
    frame: .zero,
    collectionViewLayout: UICollectionViewFlowLayout()
)
collectionView.collectionViewLayout = LXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayout()
```
instead of this
```swift
let collectionView = UICollectionView(
    frame: .zero,
    collectionViewLayout: LXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayout()
)
```
KVO will [cause `setupCollectionView` to be called twice](https://github.com/lxcid/LXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayout/blob/6a51b296b53cf1060452c35b971bfb3753ec6553/LXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayout/LXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayout.m#L518). Consequently the stored `panGestureRecognizer` is replaced with a new one, but the old one is still listening to gestures on the collection view.

This breaks scrolling, because scrolling over the collection view when `self.selectedItemIndexPath` is `nil` should **not** trigger [`handlePanGesture`](https://github.com/lxcid/LXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayout/blob/6a51b296b53cf1060452c35b971bfb3753ec6553/LXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayout/LXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayout.m#L414), but it does because this
```objc
- (BOOL)gestureRecognizerShouldBegin:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer {
    if ([self.panGestureRecognizer isEqual:gestureRecognizer]) {
        return (self.selectedItemIndexPath != nil);
    }
    return YES;
}
```
returns `true` for the replaced (but still listening) pan gesture recognizer.
Apple add some new Collection View delegate to support drag and drop function in iOS11.Could you update this lib to adapt it? https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/user-interaction/drag-and-drop/

Hello, Expert,
It is a great one for cocoapods!
Could you mind update podspec to make sure pod update can get this new release?

When I move the cell up and down a few times, duplicate cell appears and order is not correct! 
Can you figure it out and fix it?

Is it possible to Swap Cells while using this framework. Right it is working fine but not able to Drag and Drop by Locking the cells.

Hi sir,
Thanks for your great library, works very good.
i would like to know if you able to add paging. so it would be just like iphone/ipad home screen.
It would be great. Please let me know.
Thanks

Is there any way to save order of displaying cells when user quit an application?
