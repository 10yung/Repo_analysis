@wangzheallen Thanks for sharing your interesting work!
I have a little question about the feature dimension of the final SVM classifier.
According to your paper and code, the dimension of vsad code ( i.e. the features for SVM classifier) is `2*len(f)*len(p)` , where `f` denotes descriptors from your scene-PatchNet's feature layer(with dimension 
 of 100 reduced from1024 ) and `p` denotes codewords from object-PatchNet's softmax layer(i.e. probabilities with dimension of 256 reduced from 1000 ).
Even if dimension reduction is employed, the feature dimensions for SVM are still very high(say, 2×100×256=51200 according to your paper). Will this cause some problems to the final classification? What do you think? (Let me know if i was wrong somewhere! ) 
Thanks in advance!
Thank you very much for providing the model and code.But I have a question,will the caffe installed under the 32-bit operating system can run the program?
