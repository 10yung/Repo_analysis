It might help someone out to make a note about spring.

If you are developing a gem for Rails 4 with Spring its very easy to get caught out by changes not making their way into your application. Spring does not watch changes to gems and therefore does not reload the Rails stack. A bundle update 'your-gem' will not work, you will need to `$ spring stop` to force it to reload the full Rails app next time you run rails.

Hope this helps someone!

Is the `ember.md` guide moved elsewhere?

Aruba now has support for multi-line file matching. As of this [PR](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba/pull/103/files).

Using " is now deprecated in aruba.
This is the warning I get when runnning cucumber

The /^I run "(.*)"$/ step definition is deprecated. Please use the `backticks` version

Aruba version is 0.5.3


The link to the Gemfile.lock section of the bundle install page was a little off, so I fixed it :)

Hi Radar, 

This is Oak (#RubyOnRails).

Changed the line "The box directly underneath the "name this file..." box is a description for your Gist." because it's no longer correct after the changes in GUI.

> There's currently only one guide: "Developing a RubyGem using Bundler". 

This is totally a lie. ;)

I can't get the last RSpec task to successfully run, see [using-other-gems](https://github.com/radar/guides/blob/master/gem-development.md#using-other-gems):

```
macbuech:foodie josh$ bundle install
Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/........
Using activesupport (3.0.17) 
Using diff-lcs (1.1.3) 
Using foodie (0.0.1) from source at /Users/josh/Documents/Work/Sientia/foodie 
Using rspec-core (2.11.1) 
Using rspec-expectations (2.11.3) 
Using rspec-mocks (2.11.2) 
Using rspec (2.11.0) 
Using bundler (1.2.0) 
Your bundle is complete! Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
macbuech:foodie josh$ bundle exec rspec spec
You don't have i18n installed in your application. Please add it to your Gemfile and run bundle install
/Users/josh/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p0/gems/activesupport-3.0.17/lib/active_support/i18n.rb:2:in `require': cannot load such file -- i18n (LoadError)
```

I'm tempted to add 'i18n' to my gemspec file like this:

`gem.add_dependency "i18n"`

But I'm not 100% confident whether this is the right way to go? Thanks anyway for this nice tutorial.

In regards to gem-development tutorial, under Testing a command line interface (https://github.com/radar/guides/blob/master/gem-development.md#testing-a-command-line-interface):

I suppose it's my error, not the tutorial's, but perhaps you can help me in either case:

When I call `bundle exec cucumber features/`, I don't get an error reading 'pending', nor any yellow output. Rather, the task appears to run to completion, terminating with:

```
2 scenarios (2 failed)
4 steps (2 failed, 2 skipped)
```

I went ahead and created bin/foodie anyway, but it doesn't get run. (No `print "nothing"` executed.)

I'm using Windows7. I've tried this in the default shell as well as using msys. Is that my problem?
