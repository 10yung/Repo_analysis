This PR adds the following features to the `dgeni`-CLI tool:

- Add support for TypeScript 8b05f8b0
- Add support for `export default` modules adec66ad

**Open points**:
- In regards to these changes, is the `typescript` package still a `devDependency`?

- Not quite sure about the `register()` option behavior. For my project, ` { project: '...' }` or `{ transpileOnly: true `} would be suifficent, but you may have a better idea?





when running 'dgeni ./dgeni-run.js' to generate docs, I have this error: '

```
node_modules/dgeni/lib/Dgeni.js:45
            throw new Error('package must be an instance of Package');
            ^

Error: package must be an instance of Package

    at tryModuleLoad (module.js:508:12)
    at Function.Module._load (module.js:500:3)
```

I 'm testing with a basic configuration, this is my dgeni-run.js file:

```
var Dgeni = require('dgeni');

var Package = require('dgeni').Package;

var myPackage = new Package('myDoc', [
  // require('dgeni-packages/ngdoc'),
  // require('dgeni-packages/nunjucks'),
]);
console.log(myPackage)
var dgeni = new Dgeni([myPackage]);

dgeni.generate();
```
 
I'm generating JSON using dgeni but when I have a description with {@link ...} it generates a correct anchor tag but the double quotes around the href attribute value are not escaped, causing the whole JSON file to be invalid and not parsable.

Example:
`@property {string} merp The merp. Supported merps are defined in the {@link MerpTypes} constant.`

Generates:
```
{
    "name": "merp",
    "description": "<p>The merp. Supported merps are defined in the <a href="api/my-module/object/MerpTypes"><code>MerpTypes</code></a> constant.</p>\n",
    "type": [
        "string"
    ]
}
```
I'm dying to have setting up dgeni be a better experience.  Every time I go in to change anything, it seems to break things.  I only had it *partially* working in the past and now that I've ported my code to TypeScript, it's all not working now.  

I really wish this was more of a "drop in" solution and included things like:

- a default configuration that supports all angularjs constructs (directives, components, services, providers, etc)
- a default set of navigable templates to render the docs.
- a simple configuration object with things like "title", etc.
- consistent parsing across JavaScript and TypeScript
- a simpler customization experience

In general, nothing else I use in my whole dev ecosystem works like dgeni.  I find myself constantly digging through source code to try to figure out why things don't work (links to things are dead/have bad paths, etc.)

I hope this doesn't come across too whiny, but I really like having auto-generated docs, but I always spend an inordinate amount of time just trying to get dgeni configured
Hi,

Is there a simple example of Dgeni (similar to https://github.com/petebacondarwin/dgeni-example) that shows how you'd use it with an Angular 2 application using TypeScript? 

Currently I have this:

```
var Package = require('dgeni').Package;
var jsdocPackage = require('dgeni-packages/jsdoc');
var nunjucksPackage = require('dgeni-packages/nunjucks');
var typescriptPackage = require('dgeni-packages/typescript');
var path = require('canonical-path');

// Define the dgeni package for generating the docs
module.exports = new Package('hex-angular-docs', [
  jsdocPackage,
  nunjucksPackage,
  typescriptPackage
])

// Configure the log service
.config(function(log) {
  log.level = 'silly';
})

.config(function (readTypeScriptModules, readFilesProcessor, templateFinder) {
  readTypeScriptModules.basePath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../src/client');
  readTypeScriptModules.sourceFiles = [
    'button/index.ts'
  ];

  // Specify the base path used when resolving relative paths to source and output files
  readFilesProcessor.basePath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../src/client');

  // Specify collections of source files that should contain the documentation to extract
  readFilesProcessor.sourceFiles = [
    {
      include: 'app/**/*.md',
      basePath: 'app'
    }
  ];

  templateFinder.templatePatterns.unshift('common.template.html');
})

// Configure file writing
.config(function(writeFilesProcessor) {
  writeFilesProcessor.outputFolder  = 'docs';
})
```

Which I've pieced together from various examples. While I've gotten over the hurdle of it throwing errors, it isn't actually generating any documentation.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

My grunt ngdocs task below.

```
ngdocs: {
            options: {
                dest: 'site/docs',
                html5Mode: false,
                startPage: '/api',
                scripts: [
                    'bower_components/angular/angular.js'
                    'bower_components/angular-animate/angular-animate.js',
                    'bower_components/angular-material/angular-material.js'
                ]
            },
            api: {
                src: ['app/**/*.js','!app/**/*-spec.js','app/index.ngdoc'],
                title: 'Docs'
            }
        }
```

My ngdoc example block copied from angular documentation. I just added 'ngMaterial' as a dependency.

```

    User 1: <pre>{{user1 | json}}</pre>
    User 2: <pre>{{user2 | json}}</pre>
    Equal: <pre>{{result}}</pre>
  </form>
</div>
</file>
<file name="script.js">
     angular.module('sample', ['ngMaterial']).controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
         $scope.user1 = {};
         $scope.user2 = {};
         $scope.result;
         $scope.compare = function() {
          $scope.result = angular.equals($scope.user1, $scope.user2);
     };
}]);


</file>
</example>

```

Below is the error that I get.

```
angular.js:12330 Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module sample due to:
Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module ngMaterial due to:
Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module material.components.fabSpeedDial due to:
TypeError: Cannot read property 'apply' of undefined
```

If i remove 'ngMaterial' as depenedency, this example block works absolutely fine. I am using Angular 1.4.3 and Angular-material 1.0.5. Please help.
