The color choosing circle and the sliders are fixed and do not move with upon click and drag. Hence its does not allow us to choose a color in the latest version 2.18.0.

Everything works fine on rolling back to 2.17.3.


We need to tinycolor rgb instead of hex to let use transparent.
When we change transparent nothing happens. Because we use hex (which doesn't include alpha field).

It does trigger for other colors
Fixes https://github.com/casesandberg/react-color/issues/648.
Closes #657 

The "*" satisfies `@icons/material` peer dependency requirement. If react-color requires a stricter version range, then that should ideally be used.

Looking through the issue history I see that this peer dependency was removed in 2016 due to issues with npm v3. These issues are probably not relevant anymore.
Using Yarn 2.0 release candidate I get the following error:

`➤ YN0002: │ react-color@npm:2.17.3 doesn't provide react@* requested by @icons/material@npm:0.2.4`

Seeing as react-color has a dependency on `@icons/material`, it is also responsible for in some way providing it's peer dependencies, in this case `react`. This is strictly enforced in Yarn Plug'n'Play which will be default in Yarn 2.0.
when I change the color property, or change it by clicking the palette, the rgb values change, but not alpha.
Set input label width to match input width.
@casesandberg This is just an option for solving this problem. I'm submitting this to have something to discuss.

Also, the storybook doesn't seem to have an option to change the colors, so I had to edit the story.js file to actually see a white circle color swatch. Maybe there is a better way to do this?

Addresses Issue #530 
I thought the intent of the 'source' key in the onChange event was to show which 'editable field' is in use by the Chrome Picker but it always returns 'rgb'. Am I misunderstanding the usage, or is there a bug?
