This fixes the following test:

```ts
declare const fn: <T>(a: T) => { value: T };
const fn2 = memoizeOne(fn); // $ExpectType <T>(this: unknown, a: T) => { value: T };
```

Previously, the return type was:

```ts
(a: any) => { value: any; }
```

â€¦ meaning all type safety was lost!

>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

We use memoize-one for almost two years with promises just fine, but looking at the code now I realized that it maybe is not intended or tested to work with them. But maybe all that's missing is an description of `fn` in the readme (?) 

The mentioned error handling likely never was triggered, since promises fall into an error state instead of throwing an error.

In one of the projects I work on, with quite similar utility to `memoizeOne` which have some differences. But, the only key difference the doesn't allow us to use `memoizeOne`, is the fact we can remove the cache.
I know it might be out of the scope of this project. So I understand it would be the reason to reject the PR. But, personally I find it a useful utility.
This:
* Names decorated functions simply "memoized" in the case the input function is anonymous
* Names decorated functions "memoized(foo)" in the case the input function has a `name` of "foo"
* Names decorated functions "memoized(foo)" in the case the input function has a `displayName` of "foo", despite having a `name` of "bar".

It also gives a name to the default export of `memoize-one` of "memoizeOne", as it was previously "index" in every case but the minified version, where it was the empty string and will continue to be.

Upside: Makes for debugging these decorated functions much easier in debugging tools and stack traces.

Downside: more checks and more names add to the size of the compiled output.

Test Plan: `yarn test`. Import the `main` entry from a repl and confirm the export is named `memoizeOne`.
It would be good to know some information about cache breaking for debugging purposes. The big idea is that it could expose a lot of debug information on the `console`

I am not sure what the api would be, but here is some initial thoughts:

```js
import memoizeOne, { trace } from 'memoizeOne';

const times = (arg1: number, arg2: number): number => arg1 * arg2;
const memoized = memoizeOne(times);

trace(times(1, 2));
// first time call
// new arguments: [1, 2]
// returning new result: 2

trace(times(1, 2));
// new arguments [1, 2] match previous arguments
// returning previous result: 2

trace(times(1, 3));
// cache bust!
// new arguments [1, 3] do not match previous arguments [1, 2]
// argument change: [1, *2*]
// calculating new result and returning: 3
```
Memoizing a function sets its length property to zero:

```js
import memoizeOne from 'memoize-one'
f = (a, b, c) => a*b*c
memoF = memoizeOne(f)
console.log(f.length) // 3
console.log(memoF.length) // 0
```

This is not really a big deal: length is a configurable property, so if you care about `f.length` you can just set it manually afterwards using `Object.definiteProperty`.

Should `memoizeOne` automatically configure the memoized functions length property?
Actually the problem is not with typescript - the problem is with rollup.

https://unpkg.com/memoize-one@4.0.2/dist/memoize-one.cjs.js contains
```js
module.exports = index;
```
which should be imported as `import * as memoizeOne`


while https://unpkg.com/memoize-one@4.0.2/dist/memoize-one.esm.js contains
```js
export default index;
```
which should be imported as `import memoizeOne`

Result - the code for nodejs (~jest) require one behaviour, while the code for webpack(uses esm bundle) requires another.

It is not a problem for js/flow, as long babel is doing some around magic default imports, but typescript is quite strict about it.

The cjs bundle should match esm bundle.

(and fixing this would introduce a breaking change)
