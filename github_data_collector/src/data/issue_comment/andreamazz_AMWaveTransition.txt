Ciao Andrea!

I was thinking about trying implement this on a swift project. Checking around , i wasn't able to get a swift version, or get if there s one.
Is it possible integrate this into a swift project?

helloï¼ŒIf there is tabbar, tabbar, how can we not follow the move?

It would be cool to be able to delay the pop or have an animation curve, kind of like this:

-moved from Define to const
-add viewControllers inset
-add alpha changing for interactive transition
-fixed bug with 0 index in interactive transition
-add fullscreen pan interactive transition
-interactive transition working without visible cells as plain transition
-fixed bug with wrong transition when visible cells count = 0
-refactor handlePan method

There is one bug when pop fourth vc to third with interactive transition - table view header 'y' gets wrong, but after transition complete header gets into right position.
In my projects transition works properly, and i don't know how to fix this bug in demo. Take a look.

Sorry for my english.

Is keeping track of the touch position necessary? The gesture recognizer could just trigger the normal transition?
