### Description

Can you support timezone setting for schedule task
ex: 
```yaml
jobs:
  - name: timezone LA
    command: echo "foobar"
    shell: /bin/bash
    schedule: "0 0 * * *"
    timezone: "America/Los_Angeles"
```
current yacron only support `utc` and `localtime`
but I need to run multiple timezone tasks in one yacron process

Can you support the feature?
Thanks

* Yet Another Cron version: N/A
* Python version: 3
* Operating System: Ubuntu

### Description
The native cron allow specify user. Any plans about this? 

`#<timing>   <user> <command>`
`11 * * * *  root   /usr/lib/command`
yacron run inside docker alpine 3.6 based
python 3.6.1
timezone in the container and on the host is the same.

The report 'onSuccess' comes two times, 45 minutes and 15 minutes after that.
in other words, the task runs twice per hour

crontab.yaml
```
defaults:
  captureStderr: true
  captureStdout: true
  onFailure:
    report:
      mail:
        from: cron@xxxx.xxx
        to: xxx@xxxx.xxx
        smtpHost: xxxxxxxx
        subject: Cron job '{{name}}' {% if success %}completed{% else %}failed{% endif %}
        body: |
          command: {{command}}
          shell: {{shell}}
          environment: {{environment}}
          STDOUT: {{stdout}}
          STDERR: {{stderr}}
          exit code: {{exit_code}}

jobs:
- name: 45minutes
  command: /usr/bin/php5 /xxx/xxx/xxx.php
#  schedule: "*/45 * * * *"
  schedule:
    minute: "*/45"
  onSuccess:
    report:
      mail:
        from: cron@xxxx.xxx
        to: xxx@xxxx.xxx
        smtpHost: xxxxxxxx

```

Hi

Thanks for a cool project and good code quality.

I forked the repo and ran the tests against your latest commit in my repo. And some tests failed (https://travis-ci.org/bofm/yacron/builds/301317041) even though the same tests are passed on the Travis run against your repo (https://travis-ci.org/gjcarneiro/yacron/builds/296784728). Could you please help to figure out what the reason of this non-idempotent behavior is?
