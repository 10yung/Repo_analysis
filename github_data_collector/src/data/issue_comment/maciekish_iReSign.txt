Where do you actually install the iReSign app because I am confused. Please help. Also I have windows.
If it only works on mac and there is an alternative ipa signing website I can check out please let me know! 

Hey all,

Is anybody else seeing any issues opening apps that have been resigned with an enterprise certificate? I've used iReSign previously and followed the same procedure and it has worked perfectly, however as of last week the apps will no longer open on the device, I've confirmed certificates and provisioning profiles are all valid.

Thanks in advance!
look the picture

**There will be an error, when cername have a chinese.**
after apple sierra update my mac the iReSign refuse to upload the spa's to the apple tv , can someone with knowledge update ???
fix: OSX Sierra's security policy
I am trying to resign IPA with new provision file. Iresign is giving me error: Product identifiers don't match

steps to reproduce: 
I filled out all required field with correct info. 

what is wrong?? Please, save my day! 
I noticed no replies in the Issues and no merges in the Pull requests.
I wondering if this project is still supported and maintained.

If not I'd like to maintain it.
When I use ```security cms -D -i embedded.mobileprovision ``` in terminal on my Mac (macOS 10.12.1) it will output an warning string as below 
```security: SecPolicySetValue: One or more parameters passed to a function were not valid.```.

Therefore, when I resigned my ipa file it will block at the process of "Entitlements generated".
So, I fix it by finding the xml start location in order to get the correct plist data.
