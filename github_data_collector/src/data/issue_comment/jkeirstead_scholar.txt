It seems impossible to get all publications of authors with more than 100 publications, as the parameter "pagesize" does not seem to work.
Command `get_impactfactor("Perspective in science")` returns:
```
# A tibble: 1 x 4
  Journal                                                              Cites ImpactFactor Eigenfactor
  <chr>                                                                <dbl>        <dbl>       <dbl>
1 Industrial and Organizational Psychology-Perspectives on Science anâ€¦  1123         16.4     0.00263
```
which is incorrect. 





Hi @jefferis, @GuangchuangYu and Dominique Makowski,

Thanks for developing such a cool R package, I was wondering if it is possible to get the IF of the certain year when the paper was published. 

Look forward to your reply!


Could it be possible to have the date of publication (as in DD-MM-YYYY format or separate fields) added to the output of get_publications()? Or a function to extract this information from the pubid.

TIA
Dear All

Is there a way to get the number of citation of a paper whose authors do not have a scholar profile?

For instance, the following paper: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?um=1&ie=UTF-8&lr&cites=1546415278644596624
has been cited "About 1,920 results (0.03 sec)"  searched on: Mon  7 Jan 23:29:13 GMT 2019

I guess is possible to get that number using the ID 1546415278644596624.
Any idea?

Thanks
Hi,

I love the package. I made a couple of additional functions to how the change in h-index over time. The code could certainly be tidied a lot, but it's functional.
```
get_yearly_publications <- function(id){
    pub.list <- NULL
    for (i in scholar::get_publications(id)$pubid){
        #print(i)
        pub.list <- rbind(pub.list,scholar::get_article_cite_history(id,i))
    }
    years <- min(pub.list[,1]):max(pub.list[,1])
    papers <- unique(pub.list[,3])
    pub.table  <- array(dim=c(length(years),
                              length(papers)),
                        dimnames=list(years,
                                      papers))
    for (i in 1:nrow(pub.list)){pub.table[as.character(pub.list[i,1]),pub.list[i,3]] <- pub.list[i,2]}    
    pub.table  
}

h_by_year <- function(pub.table){
    hyear <- NULL
    for(i in 2:nrow(pub.table)){
        h <- NULL
        for (j in 1:ncol(pub.table)){h <- append(h,(sort(colSums(pub.table[1:i,],na.rm = 1),decreasing = TRUE)[j]>=j))}
        hyear[i] <- sum(h)
    }
    hyear[is.na(hyear)] <-0
    names(hyear) <- rownames(pub.table)
    hyear
}

plot_hyear_full <- function(pub.table){
    plot(colSums(pub.table,na.rm = 1),
         type="l",
         xlab="Paper rank",
         ylab = "Citations per paper")
    abline(0,1,col="grey")
    for (i in nrow(pub.table):2){
        lines(sort(colSums(pub.table[1:i,],na.rm = 1),decreasing = TRUE),
              col=colorRampPalette(c("lightblue", "darkblue"))(nrow(pub.table))[i])
    }
    lines(rep(0,ncol(pub.table)))
    hyear <- h_by_year(pub.table) 
    text(ncol(pub.table)*0.95,max(colSums(pub.table,na.rm = TRUE))*0.95,
         paste("H =",hyear[length(hyear)]))
}

pub.table <- get_yearly_publications(ID)
hyear <- h_by_year(pub.table) 
plot_hyear_full(pub.table)
plot(names(hyear),
     hyear,
     type="b",
     xlab="Year",
     ylab = "H index")
```

Hi, I have been trying to get the IF from GScholar. I get  this error: Error in grep(paste0("^", journal, "$"), impactfactor$Journal[closest],  : 
  invalid regular expression, reason 'Missing ')''

Any fix? Thanks!

Just discovered this [nice package](https://www.r-bloggers.com/sjrdata-all-scimago-journal-country-rank-data-ready-for-r/) for extracting the SJR index of journals' prestige. It could potentially be a nice addition to the impact_factor related functions. 

Specifically, as it includes the SJR index for different years, it would provide a unique opportunity to compute this index for each author's publication at their time of publication. Could be interesting for developing new authors' impact metrics.
`get_oldest_article()` returns `Inf` when some articles do not have year.

like in this profile:  `get_oldest_article("QW5aIMgAAAAJ")`

I would like to get multiple authors' information using `purrr:map(ids, get_oldest_article)` and the function stops due to `Inf` result.
Is it possible to return `NA` or "smallest year available" ?

Best wishes

Hello, I am trying to pull publications for multiple authors. However, get_publications() only works the with the first ID it is used on in a session- if I try to use it with a subsequent ID, the following is returned:

[1] title   author  journal number  cites   year    cid     pubid  
<0 rows> (or 0-length row.names)

Any thoughts? I've carefully checked the IDs, and they are valid and all work- as long as they are the first one tried in a particular session. To do another one, I have to end the session and reopen R, which is very inefficient!
