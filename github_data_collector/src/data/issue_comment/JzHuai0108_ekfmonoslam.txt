Hi, can you please provide your dataset to test the code
  when i simulated IMU data in your way,i can not find "poseFile="/media/jhuai/Mag/KITTISeq00/00.txt";" in kittiseq00 dataset,i already succeeding in coping with Tsukuba 3G stereo dataset.  so,could U give me some help to simulate imu data from kittiseq00?  I  have no idea of "poseFile" in kittiSeq00.
Hi,Huai
In your orb_slam DWO,how to get the data in file of kittiseq00_imu_samplesnoisy.txt ??
Thank you very much!!!
Hi Huaiï¼Œ
Thank you for sharing your code . Nowadays I am trying to modify the ekfslam to run my own dataset.But I get confused by the  Civera's classic model as in Civera, 2008 . I don't what the relationship between k1 k2 in  Civera's classic model to the general opencv radial distortion. Can you give a answer? Thank you.
