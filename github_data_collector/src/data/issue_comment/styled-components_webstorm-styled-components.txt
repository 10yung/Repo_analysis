## Problem description:

In some cases, when there is a `css` function inside templated string I'm getting the following error:  `':' term expected`

This error doesn't appear all the time. If I play around with the code it will randomly hide and appear later on. This error only appears when the plugin is enabled, so I assume it comes from it. This behavior seems to be a regression since I've been using the plugin for a long time and never saw it before.

Example of code that this error sometimes appear:

```
const OptionLabel = styled.div`
  ${(props: {}) => css`
    margin-bottom: 0.3em;
  `};
`;
```

Adding/Removing a semicolon doesn't help. The only solution I found so far is to avoid nesting `css` entirely.


Hey

Thanks for the plugin! 

Would it be possible to add code completion for css variables defined like this?

```
const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle`
  :root {
      --border-width: 7.5vw;
  }
`
```



Version 1.0.7

## Problem description:

<!-- If possible, please include a code sample that reproduces the error below. -->

Toggling a line comment on a styled component property adds //-style comments, which doesn't compile properly. Instead, the plugin should add /* */ style comments. 

Currently the following  
```
const OnText = styled(Text)`
  flex-grow: 1;
`;
```

becomes 

```
const OnText = styled(Text)`
  //flex-grow: 1;
`;
```

and gives error

Instead, it should become

```
const OnText = styled(Text)`
  /* flex-grow: 1; */
`;
```

The styled-components plugin (1.0.6) in phpstorm (2018.3) inspection rise an error Invalid CSS selector. Any idea why ?

Currently CTRL-ALT-L ("Code reformat" function of WebStorm) doesn't align styled-components' CSS as it would a CSS file.
I was wondering if its possible to make IntelliJ recognize a styled component interpolator based on the function signature?

something like:

```
export const breakpoint = (gt = 'xs', lte) => (strings, ...interpolation) => css`
  @media (min-width: ${grid[gt]}px) ${lte && grid[lte] ? `(max-width: ${grid[lte]})` : ''} {
    ${css(strings, ...interpolation)}
  }
`
```

Since it returns css`` and has a signature of (strings, ...interpolation) maybe then the plugin will highlight it as a styled component. I can submit this a feature request too if you have a GitHub

Can you even do something about this? Because I'm surprised that no one has reported this yet.
Does this plugin support react native?

```ts
export const Shadow = styled.View`
  shadowColor: #000;
  shadowOpacity: .2;
  shadowOffset: 0px -1px;
  shadowRadius: 1;
  marginBottom: -1px;
`
```

All show as errors currently
