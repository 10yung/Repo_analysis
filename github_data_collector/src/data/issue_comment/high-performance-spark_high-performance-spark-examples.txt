Fix part of #64.

Finish the rest of the unit tests of WordCountTest, AccumulatorsTest, and MixedDatasetSuite. 

In the same time, I add [comment mark](https://github.com/scoverage/sbt-scoverage#exclude-classes-and-packages) to ignore coverage of the main method.
it's difficult to work in intellij with sbt 0.13(it's a long time to "dump project structure from sbt"). plugin like sbt-spark-package seems not work in sbt 1.* .

Our test coverage is super low. Try and improve test coverage.

Once travis-ci/apt-source-whitelist#287 is resolved (or we can otherwise access R >= 3) in our travis env enable the SparkR tests.

#47

We should port some of the examples to Python

We should port at least some of the examples to the Java API.
