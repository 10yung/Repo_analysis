This is an errata file. Please take as reference the printed book (ISBN: 9781430265290).
On line 93 and line 94, based on the variables "cartTotal" and "arrayTotal", 
it seems to imply that author intends to show difference in getting total value from 
a ShoppingCart instance that also implements IEnumerable<Product> V.S.
an array of Product objects
In the original method, both "cartTotal" and "arrayTotal" are assigned with same set of products, from  
IEnumerable<Product> products
This seems to contradict with the idea of comparison.
Thanks for the source code though - it has been helpful.
