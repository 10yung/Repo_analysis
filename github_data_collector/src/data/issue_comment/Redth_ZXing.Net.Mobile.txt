@Redth : ZXing camera doesn't open up in iOS 10 (iPhone5). It was working earlier but not for the past few days, apparently due to updates in the packages. I have added the camera description string in the plist already. Anyone with similar issue?
There is problem with iOS 13. If you prohibit access to camera on first run, on next attempts you can see transparent layout without camera (and you just can see parent page)
For iOS 13, setting the ModalPresentationStyle to FullScreen
I see that IsScanning in ZXingScannerView is a bindable property, but it does not implement the PropertyChanged event.

So when I bind it to a ViewModel property it works on load, but when I change its value it won't apply to the view.
When we calling the Scan method in iOS, then we started getting an ArgumentOutOfRangeException throwing "Unexpected AVMetadataObjectType: humanBody" when called on  iphone 11's. So how we can resolve it?
As of Nov 1 2019 new apps and app updates require API 28. Because ZXing uses Android Support lib 25 it means that all Android Support 28 libs to have to be included as direct references when using PackageReference. Is there any chance that the support version could be upgraded?
Good day. Please help with `<Image x:Name="generateView" Source="Sample.Png" Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="0" Grid.ColumnSpan="2" WidthRequest="300" HeightRequest="300" BackgroundColor="Aqua"/>` to save the image on the device.
 I’m learning to program, I found a couple of examples, I don’t work, there are no errors, but they don’t save on the device either.
 Here is an example

No errors but no save

Hi!
When I try scan barcode using front cam, it can't focus on code and receive result is almost impossible. With rear cam is evrything ok. Did you have any ideas? 

            var options = new MobileBarcodeScanningOptions
            {
                AutoRotate = false,
                UseFrontCameraIfAvailable = frontCamera,
                TryHarder = true
            };

            var overlay = new ZXingDefaultOverlay
            {
                ShowFlashButton = !frontCamera,
                BottomText = "Nakieruj aparat na kod kreskowy"
            };

            var scanPage = new ZXingScannerPage(options, customOverlay: overlay);
            overlay.FlashCommand = new Command(() => scanPage.ToggleTorch());
            scanPage.AutoFocus();
            await navigation.PushAsync(scanPage);



Hello, I need to save the result generated using
<forms:ZXingBarcodeImageView VerticalOptions="FillAndExpand" HorizontalOptions="FillAndExpand" BarcodeFormat="{Binding ValidatedSelectedFormat}" BarcodeValue="{Binding ValidatedCode}" Grid.Column="0" Grid.Row="0" Grid.ColumnSpan="2" >
in jpeg format on the device. I searched for a lot of time on the Internet, I did not find the result. Can you help?
Thanks in advance,
The ZXingScannerView with ZXing.Net.Mobile.Forms and ZXing.Net.Mobile 2.4.1 has the first time issue on Android (the old version of ZXing such as 2.3.2 may not have this issue for the old version of Xamarin.Form). Install the app with this component, it can't scan  QR code at the first time. After quit the app or the page with ZXing, and enter the page with ZXingScannerView, the problem is solved. Please fix it. Thanks!
