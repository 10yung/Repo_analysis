Just wondering what you had in mind with this comment in your code?

its good tools but i think old.. windows defender delete exe file :( 
Just added Powermad, DomainpasswordSpray, Powerview Dev Version, new Inveigh + Inveigh-Relay version, Invoke-Phant0m, Sessiongopher, Invoke-TheHash, WinPwn and Get-Computerdetails. Also added ADrecon in the domain Situal awareness menu.  
I get the below error when i run mimikatz:

Unhandled Exception: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

First: Thx for the great tool!
Second: My lab setup is the following:
- victim has applocker and ConstrainedLanguageMode active
- Code execution exists through ps remoting
- dll with tcp reverse shell code was downloaded onto the victim and executed via rundll32
- powercat listener receives the connection
- p0wnedshell is executed in the reverse shell using InstallUtil -> p0wnedshell menu is displayed

Now, if I select one of the options there is exactly zero output and the application must be closed by ^C
Probably it is some kind of redirection issue but the strange thing is that the menu is displayed correctly. Any ideas? 

Unhandled Exception: System.TypeInitializationException: The Type initalizer for 'p0wnedShell.Execution' threw an excption. ---> System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly  'System.Management.Automation, Version=3.0.0.0, Cultrue=neutral, PublicKeyToken=



Hi,

i've compiled the project and created an amsi.dll with p0wnedShell which works great.

But I want to understand what the content of your AMSI.dll is.
I saw the two screenshots on your blog creating that dll in Visual Studio, but when I copy the content of your screenshot my AMSI.dll doesn't work.

Did you chance the content? What is it?

Thanks
