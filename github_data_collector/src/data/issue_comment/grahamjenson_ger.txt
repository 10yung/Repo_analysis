I added a few types for people who are using this project with typescript. It's not extensive but it's enough to get started. 

Hi @grahamjenson 

I have tried the last few days trying to get ger to run in AWS lambda, when I use memory (Which doesn't make sense to use) it works. But if I use Postgres it just stalls and times out. I tried upgrading knex and pg (btw 4.3.3, has a bug, it can't connect to other than localhost), but it is still the same. 

Have you tried it?
Is there a way to delete people from the database. This could be helpful in a web app when a user deletes their account.
I was looking through the `find_events` method to check out how it handles expiries and their wasn't an obvious way to pull in all events that haven't expired. Does this exist? something i overlooked?

I know how to find the closest things for people, but how to do the reverse?
How, given say a particular video, can you find the people who would be most likely to want to watch it?

Since GER is already using similarity to recommend items, could there be a straight up API for finding similar people themselves?

Very very useful for community building.

Hello, did you ever think about a MongoDB / Mongoose storage manager? 

I'm currently thinking about using GER but  switching over to RethinkDB is a little hurdle. Especially as RethinkDB is (so far) not available for my Windows System.

have the minimum_history_required value only count the suuplied actions in the configuration, as these are the only ones used for the calculation anyway

This will allow a specific GER instance to point at a Read-Only PG Replica for scalability reasons
