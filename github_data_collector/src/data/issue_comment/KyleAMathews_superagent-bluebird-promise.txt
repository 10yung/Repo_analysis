Currently, the package.json requires superagent v2 in `devDependencies`. However, in `peerDependencies`, it requires superagent v1 or higher. This means that it will not require or install superagent v2 if v1 is installed. I'm running into compatibility issues with this library while using superagent v1, and it looks like [this PR](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/superagent-bluebird-promise/pull/63) was intended to require superagent v2. Can the `peerDependencies` be corrected to require superagent v2?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of chai.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn‚Äôt right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I‚Äôm just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Hello lovely humans,

  <tr>
    <th align=left>

    <td>
      devDependency
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As mocha is ‚Äúonly‚Äù a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but ‚Äúonly‚Äù your build or test tools ‚Äì **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I‚Äôm sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I‚Äôd recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn‚Äôt right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I‚Äôm just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of sinon.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.
