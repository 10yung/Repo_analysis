Hello together,
 I get the following error using kinect on ubuntu 19.10 with libfreenect from git:

Hello,

Anyone tried `fakenect` on Windows? Specifically to playback a recorded session?
We normally work on Mac or Linux, where preloading works well.

Since Windows doesn't have `LD_PRELOAD` type of stuff, it seems we need DLL injection for `libfakenect.dll` or some such. While such DLL builds successfully, was anyone successful using it in their application?

(More info on DLL Injection: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_injection)
Hello to everyone ! I have a problem.

I have two RPI, one RPI 4 and other RPI3.

All my tests were using Raspbian, Ubuntu and DietPi.

I have a Kinect 360 Xbox. When i connect de Kinect to my PC and i run freenect_camtest, i get ~27MB/s, that's works great !

When i do the same test in my RPI3, i get ~20MB/s, such slower than my PC.

When i saw that, i bought a RPI4, but after my freenect_camtest, i got ~15MB/s ! What is wrong ? Why i have this poor speeds ?

I have a powerful supply with 5.25V 3A, so there isn't problem with these.

Any help ?

Thank you!
I was working with the depth data from the python wrapper, found the returned values to be way off. 

It sort of contradicts those Microsoft claims of "1 cm" accuracy (by a lot not your average SNR).

In the python wrappers there is a file that converts the depth data into a ["pretty"](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/blob/106245fce041394707f8d8afdb503abd6cb67727/wrappers/python/frame_convert2.py#L15-L18) format.

While investigating I found #588 ,  Neither @imadr nor myself saw the logic behind this and found it odd.

I dug deeper into the depth format and I believe I found the answer.

What I understand about the basic architecture of Kinect / Primesense tech that it's not just a sensor array, in fact there is a marvel SoC(Marvell AP102)[[1]](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Xbox+360+Kinect+Teardown/4066) that runs a multitude of algorithms to simply development (like skeltal skeletonization, facial recognition ... etc).

Skeletonization, if initiated the SoC would perform a looped process of identification/classifying and annotate /predict each pixel with the PlayerID. 

>The high 13 bits of the 16-bit value give you the measured distance in millimeters. The first three bits code for the player that the device has identified, but this is only activated if skeleton tracking is enabled. If you don't enable skeleton tracking, the three bits are set to zero. [[2]](https://www.i-programmer.info/ebooks/practical-windows-kinect-in-c/3802-using-the-kinect-depth-sensor.html)    

I tried to shift by 3 instead of 2 in the wrapper and the values made much more sense after.

My first thought was I would fix the python wrapper/examples, however this would need to be done across all the wrappers and sort of hacky (I'm not interested in learning AS3, thanks. ).

I'm not sure if there are plans to implement skeleton tracking or not, **either way the "raw depth" need to be shifted by 3** at the driver / core lib level and pass in the correct format (Ushort) to wrappers the depth information and maybe implement a get_PlayerID function that returns the correct 3 bits (won't be useful till the tracking is actually enabled).

@marcan @JoshBlake thoughts? I'm happy to fix/PR if you agree. Are there other areas of the package that this change would break that I should be aware of?




Hi everyone!

I'm trying to install the package "Freenect_launch" for the Kinect Sensor on my Qbot2e. And after I git clone to my src directory and catkin_make, it shows
`-- +++ processing catkin package: 'freenect_camera'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(freenect_stack/freenect_camera)
-- Checking for module 'libfreenect'
--   No package 'libfreenect' found

`
Then I followed the libfreenect installation intruction but it still cannot find "libfreenect". I git clone it to my catkin_ws/src and build it, I guess this is the causing problem? But I have no idea how to fix this. Any help is appreciated!

Regards,

Tommy

Hello,

I am trying to retrieve data simultaneously from a Kinect and a regular webcam on Ubuntu 18.04. I am using LibFreenect to retrieve data from the Kinect and OpenCV Capture module to retrieve data from the webcam. Both devices work well separately.

However, when I launch both data grabbers simultaneously, neither the Kinect data nor the webcam data get retrieved. The terminal remains frozen, forcing me to manually kill the process in order to proceed.

Any help and ideas would be appreciated.
Thanks.
Hello,

I am trying to grab depth and RGB frames from the sensor using the 320*240 resolution. Therefore I did the following:
```python
context = freenect.init()
device = freenect.open_device(context, 0)
freenect.set_depth_mode(device, freenect.RESOLUTION_LOW, freenect.DEPTH_11BIT)
freenect.set_video_mode(device, freenect.RESOLUTION_LOW, freenect.VIDEO_RGB)
```

However, I get the following error: 

`freenect_set_depth_mode: freenect_frame_mode provided is invalid`

Thanks
Hello,

I am trying to run my kinect 360 model 1414 with a raspberry pi 3 b and Arch Linux Arm loaded.
```
send_cmd: Input control transfer failed (18)
freenect_fetch_reg_info: send_cmd read 18 bytes (expected 118)
send_cmd: Output control transfer failed (-1)
freenect_fetch_reg_const_shift: send_cmd read -1 bytes (expected 8)
freenect_camera_init(): Failed to fetch const shift for device
Error: Invalid index [0]
Device 0xaaaabb55f250 open during shutdown, closing...
Error: Kinect not connected?
```
- Connected the kinect on a powered USB hub, also tried directly into the pi
- I have the most updated Arch Linux Arm packages
- I manually compiled libfreenect 
- Strange thing is, I was able to get freenect-tilttest and freenect-camtest working until recently.  Pulling a previous commit of libfreenect didn't help (i'm not running X on the pi so i can't verify if freenect-glview is working, but i am doubtful it matters at this point).
- I'm using the udev rules and they seem to be working in /dev/input/usb

I've seen other threads that mention this error, and i've adjusted accordingly with the above steps, but i'm at a loss now.  Are there any other solutions or ideas?

Thanks!

I recently upgraded to a new machine (2018 Mac Mini) running the 10.15 beta for another project I'm working on. Running make generates this result:

```
$ make

```
Apparently Apple has restructured the include directories to be all self contained within the Xcode.app package, I have tried to point make to the Xcode toolchain's header files with this command but got the same result:

```
$ make -I/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/include/c++/v1

make[1]: *** [src/CMakeFiles/freenectstatic.dir/all] Error 2

```

I'm not sure if this is necessarily a bug or just me not fully understanding the intricacies of building command line software, but if someone could help point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it!
