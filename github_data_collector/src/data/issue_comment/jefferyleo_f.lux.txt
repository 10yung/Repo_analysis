I have a jailbroken iPhone 5 running iOS 10.3.4 with h3lix jailbreak. I've always used flux from the cydia repo (I think it was version 0.9986) without any issues. A few weeks ago I was unable to sign my jailbreak so I side loaded flux with the Xcode project from this repo (version 1.09). I am now jailbroken again and uninstalled the old flux version from cydia and kept the side loaded version and keep signing it with provenance every week.

I use the new darkroom feature every night but after a couple of days after a reboot the red tint gets stuck and the screen does not return to its normal colors during the day. I also can't change any settings in flux (change temperature, disable, preview) only darkroom works.) The colors are not inverted when dark room feature is disabled but the tint stays. I attached a couple of pics to clarify what I mean.

Is there anything I can do to fix this?

I just want to open Flux with Alfred, and when it's open, my screen is dimmed to a single preset.

Then when I exit out of Flux, I want it to return to normal brightness.

I sleep at completely random times and "When I wake up" is useless. Messing with settings so that I can turn it on/off causes me to simply not use this app as much as I'd like to.
maybe check once a day or once an hour and update location/time zone with OS? 
Hi I am getting the following error from Xcode when I try to build this app.

1) Target 'iflux' has copy command from '/Users/b/Downloads/flux/f.lux-master/iflux' to '/Users/b/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/iflux-ciglrfbteqzwqafnuwfvdkdacxoh/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/iflux.app/iflux'
2) Target 'iflux' has link command with output '/Users/b/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/iflux-ciglrfbteqzwqafnuwfvdkdacxoh/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/iflux.app/iflux'

I had a look through all the files for copy/link commands but could not find the cause, this is the only issue with the build process. Trying to build for iPad running iOS 10.3.3
Please make flux work for iOS 11
f.Lux is way better than Nighthift on an iPhone X, because the way Apple implemented it, makes all text go blurry when scrolling. It looks like there is a yellow layer, that scrolls slower than the rest.
And we have a new Electra jailbreak now from 11.2 - 11.4 beta 4

Im working on an app which combines by other apps altogether and want to run my apps. Any way I can do this?

I am on windows and as such i can onlu use cydia impactor to install ipas

I hate using GH issues like forum comments, but...  sorry 

I mistakenly updated my iPad 3 (original retina) to iOS 9.3.3 thinking I could use the latest Jailbreak on it...  oops.  Also discovered that that Apple's nightshift doesn't work on 32-bit devices either (which is ridiculous).  Since I only use my iPad for reading in bed at night, that suddenly because a rather painful experience.

The good news is I was able to sideload this version of Flux on it and it's working just fine.... yay.  It sounds like the current Cydia version of F.lux might not be compatible with 9.3.3 yet, but FWIW this version sideload seems to be.

I want to use launch center pro quickly open flux enable action. Can add url schemes do enable action?
