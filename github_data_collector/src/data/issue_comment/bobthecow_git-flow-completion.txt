Stop working in macOS Catalina
After following the steps [here](https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion/wiki/Install-Bash-git-completion) for adding git_completion to Mac, when I type "git checkout mm-" and press tab, I see all the branches that ever started with mm-, including the ones I have deleted. Is this expected? Would be nice if completion would only work for the branches that show up when I do "git branch".

I also see other people's branches and I'd prefer not to, but that's not as much of an issue since we prefix our branch names with a personal identifier (mm- for me)
I was following the helpful instructions provided here:

https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion/issues/46#issuecomment-332724240

However, afterwards, I got the following appearing in my shell:

```
git flowUnknown option: --list-cmds=list-mainporcelain,others,nohelpers,alias,list-complete,config
usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c name=value]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]
```

I then discovered on StackExchange that it was because the master version of `git-completion.bash` I had downloaded was too recent for my built-in version of git:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/327817/git-completion-bash-producing-error-on-macos-sierra-10-12-6

**Solution**

I found out what my version of git was:

```
$ git --version
git version 2.10.1 (Apple Git-78)
```

And then I downloaded the corresponding `git-completion.bash` version, e.g.:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/v2.10.1/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash
```

It works for me now (:
My ENV
```
MacOS High Sierra
Git version 2.18.0
```

There is No '/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash' after executing 'brew install git bash-completion' on my MacBook.

Instead I add the following line to my ~/.bash_profile:
  [ -f /usr/local/etc/bash_completion ] && . /usr/local/etc/bash_completion
Please update the [Install Bash git completion](https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion/wiki/Install-Bash-git-completion) guide for macOS High Sierra using Homebrew.

We need to add the following lines to `.bash_profile` for it to work:

```
[ -f /usr/local/etc/bash_completion ] && . /usr/local/etc/bash_completion
```
This can be found using the `brew info bash-completion` command.

I'm getting `sed: RE error: illegal byte sequence ` error with the recent changes.

Here are my specs:
Homebrew 1.6.3
Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision 85d254; last commit 2018-05-08)
git version 2.17.0

It got broken after upgrading the git I guess. I'm not sure what specifically broke it after upgrading brew formulas, I'm getting this error. 

I'm not sure it is reproducible or not but my understanding that one of the regular expressions in the bash_completion is not correct. I had no time to dive into. If I find some time, I will let you know my findings

Replace /usr/share/zsh/x.x.xx/functions/_git

In newer versions of OSX this file is restricted 

Issue ls -lO /usr/share/zsh/x.x.xx/functions/_git

(capital letter 'oh', not zero); 

if you see restricted, SIP is protecting that directory tree.

Solution (from the linked answer):

boot into recovery mode (Command-R during boot)
In terminal, issue crsutil disable
Reboot to normal mode. You should see that SIP is no longer blocking write access.
If you later want to restore SIP, just use crsutil enable in recovery mode.

I made a push a moment ago using "git push origin xxx" in command line,then if I want to push again, I like to use "Ctrl + R(reverse-i-search) " to get the push history. When I find it ,however, if I press "Tab", the command will be "git push push origin xxx",so I need to clear the repeated 'push' to make a success push! 
      Have a look,guys,thank you~

In a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 machine and after installing git, bash-completion and as described in the [instructions](https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion/wiki/Install-Bash-git-completion#ubuntudebian), I'm not able to make git completion works. I used to have an Ubuntu 14.04 and worked fine.

Is it a known issue?
