First of all, thank you so much for such elaborate examples
and the amount of effort you're putting into bringing FP to Kotlin!

I've noticed that in all 4 examples
Activity just passes a reference to itself to the other part of the app
( e.g. by calling `getSuperHeroes().run(heroesContext)` in `onResume()` ),
so when the data is fetched from the server,
it is displayed by calling `drawHeroes()` method directly on that Activity reference:
```Kotlin
private fun drawHeroes(view: SuperHeroesListView, success: List<CharacterDto>) {
  view.drawHeroes(success.map {
    SuperHeroViewModel(
        it.id,
        it.name,
        it.thumbnail.getImageUrl(PORTRAIT_UNCANNY),
        it.description)
  })
}
```

But what if this Activity is currently undergoing a Configuration change?
(it can be destroyed and not yet initialized again)
I assume in that case it may result in NPE or some other exception.

How do you actually handle this situation in such architecture?


P.S. I haven't been able to really check this, but I'm pretty sure that's how it is.
