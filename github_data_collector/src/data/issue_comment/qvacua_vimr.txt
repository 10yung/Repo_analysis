I have a local HTML file, viewed in Safari or Chrome.

I've tried to add vimr:// links to it in order to open indexed text files in VimR, but VimR keeps complaining about using an old version of the CLI tool since I cannot add the pipe_path URL parameter, and does not open the file.

Is there any way to use the VimR URL scheme to open files without providing a FIFO/pipe like the vimr CLI tool does?

Or is there a way to mkfifo from a local HTML file?

Problem: When using Kotoeri Japanese IME (in insert mode) and hitting space and tab to select variants, spaces are inserted instead.

The problem is specific to VimR. In nvim, MacVim, vim the IME works as expected.
Also, this problem is specific to Kotoeri, in other (e.g. Chinese) IME space works as expected.
Hi,

I have a .vimrc and I want to check for a variable that would suggest I am running inside vimr. 

`if exists('g:GuiLoaded')` works for nvim-qt for example.

This is macOS Catalina 10.15.1 (19B88)
VimR Version 0.29.0 (329)
With the following minimal `.vimrc`, where only coc.nvim is enabled via vim-plug, the VimR window is closed right after starting the app. It doesn't crash, it still sits running in the dock, but when I click the app icon it shows for less than a second and is closed again.

```
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}
call plug#end()
```

Is there any way at all to get VimR to give me anything like a log file?

I'm using Version 0.29.0-329 installed via brew on Catalina 10.15.1.
## Steps to reproduce

1. Open Vimr
2. Call `:Man` on any command
3. Notice Vimr stops responding

The vimR application crashed when execute the `vimr` command from terminal after updated vimR to 0.29.0
In VimR, when I run `:version`, VimR exits immediately, writing to the console:
