Hi,
The UTF-8 characters such as emoji are fucked up (there is a question mark showing in front of them), could there be a better support for this in Terminus?
Second problem, some double width characters are also acting funny, which is exactly the problem listed [here ](https://denysdovhan.com/spaceship-prompt/docs/Troubleshooting.html#some-section-icons-overlap-each-other)on their troubleshooting page. Can the width be adjusted somehow in Terminus?

Thanks

Hello,

I find from a certain time point my terminus cannot load CMD and power shell anymore. When I open a new window with these two choices, there will be a curser keeps twinkling but never get anything shown. I hope to know why and I tried to uninstall-rm all App Roaming data-reinstall, but the same problem still exists. Also, open with admin is also tried.

When there are some items in the console list don't have a certain icon(maybe) terminus shows an ugly and overlapping "undefined".

Ctrl-Shift-C does not work for me. It displays the 'Copied' message but does not actually place anything to buffer (either to paste inside the same terminal or outside). This behavior is observed when I use Ctrl-Shift-C when opening tmux session inside extising SSH session.
This issue does not happen when I use tmux inside SSH session in other terminal emulators, like xterm.
Mac OS HS 10.13.6
I am using private key for connection. 
I am adding a new host and trying to connect my remote machine:
_**Error while signing data with privateKey: error:06000066:public key routines:OPENSSL_internal:DECODE_ERROR**_
I can make the same exact connection with Iterm2 without any issues.

Feature Request:
Now, Terminus config is combined with ssh config, However, I think SSH should be a plugin, and the plugin config should go along with the plugin itself.

Thus, would it be better to separate plugin config when exporting configs?

Thanks.

<h2>v0.16.2</h2>
<h3>Features :sparkles:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plugins may now use the <code>@Option</code> decorator to declare options. (<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TypeStrong/TypeDoc/issues/1165">#1165</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed :bug:</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>@param</code> and <code>@returns</code> are overly sensitive to whitespace (<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TypeStrong/TypeDoc/issues/1164">#1164</a>)</li>
<li>TypeDoc is missing exported values to set options without importing internals (<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TypeStrong/TypeDoc/issues/1163">#1163</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changed :package:</h3>
<ul>
<li>TypeDoc's tests now run in ~30 seconds instead of 3 minutes, making for a much better development experience (<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TypeStrong/TypeDoc/issues/1156">#1156</a>)</li>
