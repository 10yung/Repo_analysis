Similar to https://github.com/palantir/tslint/issues/4534... note that all formatting rule requests will be declined because we recommend using Prettier for code formatting.

You may also use this thread as a place to submit feedback about the state of eslint-plugin-react w/ TypeScript.

Update (June 2019): a more concrete roadmap timeline:

- __August 1st, 2019__: Stop accepting new _core_ rules. Still accept bug fixes, minor features, and rule enhancements. Custom rules are always an option and can be maintained outside this repo.
- __November 1st, 2019__: Stop accepting features or rule enhancements (with the exception of ones that make migrating to typescript-eslint easier). Still accept bug fixes.
- __January 1st, 2020__: Stop accepting anything except security fixes.
- __December 1st, 2020__: Stop accepting any PRs ðŸŽ‰
