Just another webpage...
The chapter on _Classes Emit_ mentions the "two things" that the `__extends` function does. Both items on the list are labeled `1.`

Creates the pretty syntax highlighting.
Funnily, I only today remark that there always has been an "issue" section for every repo.

And there is no "thank you" section.

Meaning that thank yous are un-useful? I highly doubt that,so it is an issue, that there is no thank you section.

And thank you for the effort put in this book, which I appreciated reading some part of.

When I click the EPUB / MOBI links on the site, legacy GitBook just redirects me back to your homepage. Could you maybe attach the downloadable ebook files as a release on this repo?
Hey Basarat,

I'm reading the secsion [***Interface***](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/types/interfaces.html) of the book. And decided to copy & past some snippet into [***typescript Playground***](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html). I've find that your code may not designed to be *copyAndPastable*. (See [this result](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html?ssl=7&ssc=1&pln=7&pc=2#code/JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgAoHtRmQbwLABQyxyAHgFzIgCuAtgEbQDcyAnpTQ84QL6GEIANnADOI5AFlWGLMmC0ADoIi0I4cTPC5CJMhzqMoLdlQPNkAegvIAynFXJRaTOF5A))

As a beginner for `class` in Javascript, I belive here I may initialize `x` and `y` in the constructure. So what's your purpose here? Prefer a concise expression as exist on the book or others? 

**BTW**:
Awesome book really! I'm sure I will buy you something after I slowly finish my reading in the new future! ðŸŒ¹ 
I'm pretty sure I've been your fans now ðŸ’˜ 

Cheers

```ts
type RenderedViewProps = { url: string };
const RenderedView: React.FC<RenderedViewProps> = React.forwardRef<HTMLIFrameElement, RenderedViewProps>((props, ref) => {
  return <iframe ref={ref} src={props.url} style={{
    width: '100%',
    border: 'none',
    backgroundColor: 'white',
  }} />
});
```
I've noticed that some code blocks in [Promise/Callback style code](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/promise.html) have no syntax highlight. [Markdown](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book/blob/master/docs/promise.md#callback-style-code) looks fine to me though.
I'm using Firefox on a Moto G6. The "buy me a beer/coffee" link blocks the typography button at the top of all pages. The typography button is displayed, but trying to click on it activates the paypal link. This means I can't switch to dark mode and increase the font size, so I'm not able to read the book on mobile.
