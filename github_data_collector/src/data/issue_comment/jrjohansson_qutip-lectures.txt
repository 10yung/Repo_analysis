Hi.

I'm very new to Qutip and still in the process of refreshing my quantum physics knowledge so please forgive me if this is a silly question.

In the notebook on the [Jaynes Cumming model](https://github.com/jrjohansson/qutip-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-1-Jaynes-Cumming-model.ipynb)  I cannot understand why the hamiltonian is written with the `sm.dag()*sm` for the atomic part in the following:

```
H = wc * a.dag() * a + wa * sm.dag() * sm + g * (a.dag() * sm + a * sm.dag())
```

When I look at the description of Jaynes Cumming model that you give and also on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaynes%E2%80%93Cummings_model#Mathematical_formulation_1) it seems like we should be using something like `sigmaz` instead, i.e.

```
H = wc * a.dag() * a + wa *tensor(qeye(N),sigmaz())+ g * (a.dag() * sm + a * sm.dag())
```

I wondered whether they might be the same, but they do not appear to be when I calculate them.

Thanks for your time.

Matt




When trying to evolve the code:
`mesolve(h_t, psi0, taulist, [], process_rho, args)`

I get the following error.  It looks like it is expecting parameters to be passed in, but I'm not sure which ones to use.
`TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
