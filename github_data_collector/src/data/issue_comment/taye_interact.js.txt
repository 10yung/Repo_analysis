You can see this happen on the examples at https://interactjs.io/.
Simply move your mouse over the draggable or resizable area.

I assume it's an issue with constantly setting the cursor style even if it hasn't changed on each cursor check. I'm not sure this is the case as I haven't dived into the code myself.
Can we add new element dynamically and start dragging it.
like user clicks on some button etc and we add new element

I looked into documentation and examples but don't see anything like it
### Expected behavior
The resizemove event should be triggered when autoscrolling.

### Actual behavior
The resizemove event gets triggered until the autoscroll kicks in. When autoscroll starts, the resizemove event stops.
