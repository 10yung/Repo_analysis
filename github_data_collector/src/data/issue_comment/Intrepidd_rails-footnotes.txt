rails-footnotes-5abc557dfae0/rails-footnotes.gemspec:15.
Rails Version: 5.2.1
Ruby Version: 2.3.7
Server stops responding on loading multiple images on any view page

`
<% @meal.images.each do |image| %>
  <%= image_tag image %>
<% end %>
`

On debugging, found the following error:
> Footnotes Footnotes::Notes::ViewNote Exception: undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass

Had to remove the gem eventually
Spent like a week debugging this. Be aware if you have a page with long queries this gem will do some magic behind the scenes and can possibly cause a mysql connection drop, which will then give a cryptic 502 in the web browser.
This gem looks obsolete, unfortunately.
If you want to see only performance / query info, rack-mini-profiler is good alternative..!

Anyway thanks to author of this gem, it saved my time for long time..!
From sample code in README.rb

```rb
config.before {|controller, filter| filter.notes = controller.class.name =~ /Message/ && \
    controller.action_name == 'index' ? [:assigns] : []}
```

This will destructively changes `filter.notes` for later calls.

Passed block parameter filter is class instance of Footnotes::Filter, which is global singleton.

Also, it maybe not thread safe.
The correct option of mattr_accessor is instance_writer, not instance_writter.
When I run my project in development mode with the rails-footnootes gem. I'm getting a `SystemStackError: stack level too deep` error after ~475 requests to localhost. 

This happens with rails 4.2+, 5.0+ and ruby 2.2+. Only workaround is to remove the gem or overwrite ActiveSupport::Logger to not call super on add and close (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39596073/stack-level-too-deep-with-activesupport-logger-after-475-requests#comment66514021_39596073).

Any news for Visual Studio Code?

rails-footnotes (~> 4.1.8) was resolved to 4.1.8, which depends on rails (>= 3.2)
