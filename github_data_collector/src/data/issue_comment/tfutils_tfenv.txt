This is a workaround that should work for both bash 3.x and 4.x
I've got the `tfenv` repo checked out at `/opt/tfenv`.  I symlinked `tfenv` and `terraform` from the `bin` dir to `/usr/bin/tfenv` and `/usr/bin/terraform`.  I have an upstart (Amazon linux 1 :( ) process that simply does `terraform -v`.  On system start, I have a script that runs `tfenv install latest` so that the "system" wide Terraform is whatever the latest version is.  Users running `terraform -v` works fine, but my upstart script results in this output with the latest alpha:
```
/opt/tfenv/libexec/tfenv-version-file: line 83: HOME: unbound variable
Failed to retrieve TFENV_VERSION_FILE from tfenv-version-file
```

If I switch `/opt/tfenv` back to `1.0.2` (after running `tfenv install latest` so that `/opt/tfenv/version` is generated), I get the desired output of:
```
Terraform v0.12.18
```

It would appear that however the alpha is determining paths to the tfenv root is broken when run under a script like this.
**Feature Request**
Add a "quiet" parameter to silence the download status when installing a new version of Terraform.

Short-hand: -q
Long: --quiet

**Desired Behavior**
When: running tfenv -q install 0.12.17
Then:  The following should not print: download progress should not show (all of the pound signs),  inflating message and archive message should be hidden
Why: The download progress text clutters log files
```
$ tfenv install 0.11.14

Since the 45da04ade6a69ebd79b28b8f8b84974a79400fb5 every time I call `terraform` it's simply broken:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/terraform: line 24: /usr/local/lib/helpers.sh: No such file or directory
[ERROR] Failed to source helpers from /usr/local/lib/helpers.sh
```

Looks to be any issue on the Bash code and very recent. I'm sure this was working last week.

Ubuntu/Bionic is the OS I'm using this. I'm now pining to `v1.0.2` as I should have done from the very start.
I found a bug when trying to use `tfenv` with the env variable `CLICOLOR=1` to give `ls` the ability to show colors in MacOS Terminal.

The whole log can be found in https://gist.github.com/amontalban/380c68b99491577cf042d9ee9560f395.

What I did was changing the `ls` commands with `find` doing it in a compatible way between GNU and no GNU `find` because we can't use the `-depth` option.

Additionally I added recent versions of Ubuntu and MacOS for TravisCI testing, as well as putting `CLICOLOR` in the env to make sure it covers future cases.

`tfenv` currently only relies in version files to dispatch the final terraform version.
This PR allows the version string that would otherwise come from version-file to come from an environment variable.
See #140 
Didn't know how to resume it better x)

If you set the tfenv version to 0.11.14 and enter a directory with a .terraform-version that points to 0.12.4, it changes the tfenv version globally. That means that when you go outside that directory, it doesn't revert the tfenv version to 0.11.14, it maintains the 0.12.4 version. I think it should do it as the default behaviour.

PD: tfenv it's very cool, thanks for your work!
