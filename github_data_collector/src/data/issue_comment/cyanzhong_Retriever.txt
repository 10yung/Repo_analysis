It can not detect any apps on iOS11, any chance you will update this project for iOS11?
Hi Sir, I previously contacted you. 

I need help achieving this in iOS 11, the openwithbundleid in iOS 11 B2 doesn't work. I am happy to help develop this because i use it in my own app. What are the new private API? All icons aren't showing also and you can't get the app by bundle ID

Thanks 

Private api has changed.
Hey, does this app use iHasApp? I want a list of all applications installed but don't know where to start
