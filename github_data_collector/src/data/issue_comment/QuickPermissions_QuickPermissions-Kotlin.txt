How to change rational explanation and denied dialogs font?
I can localize dialogs messages but not the dialogs' buttons
Thanks for this great library.
Can you please explain how this library compares to the [PermissionDispatcher](https://github.com/permissions-dispatcher/PermissionsDispatcher)?
Is it possible to call the callback function if all permissions are received for the first time? To thank the user
Method
```
     private fun permissionsPermanentlyDenied (req: QuickPermissionsRequest) {
         // this will be permanently
         // denied. Handle it your way.
         AlertDialog.Builder (this)
             .setTitle ("Permissions Denied")
             .setMessage (getString (R.string.permanentlyDeniedMessage_never))
             .setPositiveButton ("App Settings") {dialog, which -> req.openAppSettings ()}
             .setNegativeButton ("Cancel") {dialog, which -> req.cancel ()}
             .setCancelable (false)
             .show ()
     }
```
Causes a crash, does not go into the settings on the Google Pixel 2 Android Q emulator

And if set permission some of WRITE_SETTINGS - it's immediately calls this mehod  `permissionsPermanentlyDenied `
I'm trying to use this library in a fragment to get the current location using fused location provider. Here's the code. I just assume that it will work either in activity or fragment. But i get 

" java.lang.IllegalStateException: FragmentManager is already executing transactions"

Maybe some more samples usecase code could help new users to use this library.

    @SuppressLint("MissingPermission")
    override fun onAttach(context: Context?) {
        super.onAttach(context)
        if (context != null) {
            fusedLocationClient = LocationServices.getFusedLocationProviderClient(context)

            runWithPermissions(Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION) {
                val locationClient = fusedLocationClient
                locationClient?.lastLocation?.addOnSuccessListener {
                    // Got last known location. In some rare situations this can be null.
                    Timber.d("last location $it")
                    vm.currentLocation = it
                }
            }
        }
    }
Add support for `Activity` as well as `AppCompatActivity`.
