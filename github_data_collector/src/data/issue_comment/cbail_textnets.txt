Hi, I am getting an installation issue (R 3.5. Ubuntu 18)
library(devtools)
> install_github("cbail/textnets")
Downloading GitHub repo cbail/textnets@master
from URL https://api.github.com/repos/cbail/textnets/zipball/master
Installation failed: error in running command

Thanks
Currently the PrepText function accepts either words or groups as the node type. It would be useful to be able to create and visualize two-mode networks by using both of these as nodes.
The author of the udpipe R package referenced this package for network visualizations: https://github.com/iankloo/sigmaNet

It claims to be suited to quickly render large networks as well as provide interactive features, so might be interesting to look into.
- Carried pruned through the remainder of the function.
- Changed communities$memberships to communities$membership (memberships is a matrix).
- Reordered plotting so that edges are plotted before nodes.
