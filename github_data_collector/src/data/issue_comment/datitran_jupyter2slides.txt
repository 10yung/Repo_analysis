The link to the interactive template is broken:
http://interactive-slides.cfapps.io/
otherwise, the url was resolved to file://... on my machine
The link in the Getting Started section under the 2nd point doesn't seem to be pointing to any such introduction to creating slides as mentioned. 
Hi,
the question is in the title ^^, and the problem illustrated in the image attached.
I would like to have a wider display, set the margin from top and the font size, and have something like scrolling in case the there are 'too many' lines to display in the slide.
How can I change the template file to achieve this ?

Thanks

hey awesome project, ive used it at work a few times, when i was doing research i found out theres a new library called RISE, from the jupyter team i think. its similar to this library but does the conversion with an extension built in to the notebook and it does it right away. maybe you could mention it in the readme or repo description to let people know about it:

Is there a possibility how to hide code, i.e. `IFrame` calling [here](http://interactive-slides.cfapps.io/#/2/3). When I export my notebooks to html (`jupyter nbconvert --to html`). I use `--template hidecode.tpl` (see below). Would it be possible to add this functionality as well? Thx

`{%- extends 'full.tpl' -%}
{% block input_group %}                                                                                                
{% if cell['metadata'].get('slideshow',{}).get('slide_type','') =='Notes' -%}                                                                                                                   {{ super() }}                                                                                                   
{% endif %}                                                                                                    
{%- endblock input_group %}`
Should I change something? I am getting an error: No web processes running.

Thanks!
Even as root I get to following output:
```
./phantomjs decktape.js generic --keycode=Space "http://0.0.0.0:9099/" presentation_template.slides.pdf
bash: ./phantomjs: Permission denied
```
https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/11688 (This was my first idea)
Any idea ? (Also tried to install current Decktape-Version 2.4 but had issues with hummus)



Tried one cell as Markdown type and cannot get the Latex rendered. Works with RISE. How to fix it?


example:

# Testing Mathjax
$\large{C_x = x^2 + \frac{a^3}{2b - c}}$
