I try to use DyCI in my project, but when i press ctrl + =, error happened. After searching on google, i still can not find what is the problem. Here is the error message:

`2016-08-17 11:31:05.744 beiliao[7207:815699] Couldn't load file Error : dlopen(/Users/huangzeyu/.dyci/dyci4239950.dylib, 10): Symbol not found: _OBJC_CLASS_$_BLAccountRestartRequest
  Referenced from: /Users/huangzeyu/.dyci/dyci4239950.dylib
  Expected in: flat namespace
 in /Users/huangzeyu/.dyci/dyci4239950.dylib`

does anyone get any idea?

When I run control+x in my project，i  get back this error message: No recompiler found to handle this file（xxx）.i don't know why will get this error message. Please help me to solve this problem.thanks

Observers are referenced as __unsafe_unretained, but sometimes observers released, leading to crash on notification. Fix this by retaining observers.

Other approach may be keeping week references to observers, but i've took simple way :)

Now there are next projects, coupled within one  
- Installation Scripts  
- Python based Clang Proxy and Recompiler scripts  (Command-line plugin)
- AppCode Plugin  
- Xcode Plugin  

It will make sense to distribute them to different repositories since work on them can be parallelized

For now there's only way to find how the file was compiled - is to use clang proxying scheme.
There' should be way to do it without proxying, like in #87 for Xcode

Please reopen issue #72. Still getting errors like "IOError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: " when trying to inject xib files

Would it be possible to support Swift? I guess native swift objects cannot be swizzled, but how about everything that inherits from NSObject?

I have an app which uses a sub-project, where all code except for the appdelegate is included.

If I include the files from the example projects into the main project, all goes well.

If i do the same inside the subproject, i see this:

0 instanses were notified on Class Injection by injecting class: (DYCIViewController)

And nothing is updated.

If I do the same in any other of my custom classes, nothing at all happens dyci does not seem to be called. 
Pressing ctrl-x only seems to show a green bubble on classes that are not currently loaded

The results were the same, no matter if adding as subproject, library or as a Pod
