Hi, We are facing an issue with HTML entities. We have saved this text into database "Allergy & Immunology" and when we display it then it shows html special charaters "Allergy &amp; Immunology"

We clean it as **clean($speciality->title)**
Is there any solution to leave html entities and don't escape them? 

We read that extension support this filter **Filter.ExtractStyleBlocks.Escaping** but how we can use this filter to leave special characters?

Thanks
I have the following in my editor viewing via browser console.
```
Hello
<br>
hello
```

My issue is once its ran through the `clean()` method all the <br> line breaks are removed and results like so.

```
Hello hello
```

How can I stop it from removing the line breaks and making it all one big line. Im using the default config.
I try to use img with tag width, it is working properly. The image can be resized. However, if I use youtube as second parameter when calling Purifier clean, the image is no longer resized, always go back to original size. 
# Environment
- PHP: 7.3.3 / 7.3.8
- Laravel: 5.8.33
- mews/purifier: 2.1.4
- ezyang/htmlpurifier: 4.10.0 (required by mews/purifier)
- config: default

# Issue
When I use the following code to clean text with `custom_definition` config,
```php
Purifier::clean($richText, 'custom_definition');
```
it throws `Invalid argument supplied for foreach()` at `vendor/ezyang/htmlpurifier/library/HTMLPurifier/Config.php:691`

Can you help for fix it? Or is there any workarounds to get over it? 
Would it be a good idea to add both the packages:

- ezyang/htmlpurifier

- xemlock/htmlpurifier-html5

To this lib. The work done by xemlock is really good and he updates his repo all the time!

I think it makes more sense if this repo focuses on the Laravel wrapper side of things and those two other repo's focus on the feature's with regards to HTML Purifier.

As per conversation: https://github.com/xemlock/htmlpurifier-html5/issues/49
