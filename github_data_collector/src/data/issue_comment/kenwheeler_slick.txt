Not a bug, but a question.  I have a slider that I want the first image to be larger than the rest, I have a mockup below.  Seems like this should be a simple enough thing to achieve but it happens to be not working for myself..


![Slider-with-hero](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17171806/72639881-7cdd4e80-391b-11ea-9fc8-93bec8308351.png)



We have 2 synced sliders with infinite = false
When thumb count is less or equal slidesToShow, thumb slider doesn't work correctly and scrolling away

When you have variablewidth=true
width of .slick-track may become too small when having large screens. 

here's an example with 2100 width monitor:

Regular screen:

Same in a wide monitor > 2100px

Problem is, items break a new line because .slick-track is hardcoded to 10000px

If we change width to 20000px its fixed:

This CSS is useful to solve the bug

```
  @media only screen and (min-width: 2000px) {
    .slick-track {
      min-width: 20000px;
    }
  }

```


This is the JS to initialize the slider (important part is variableWidth)
```
		// Slick Carousel
		$('.block-main-carousel__items').slick({
			dots: false,
			infinite: true,
			arrows: true,
			autoplay: 0,
			autoplaySpeed: 6000,
			slidesToShow: 1,
			centerMode: true,
			variableWidth: true,
			responsive: [
				{
					breakpoint: 993,
					settings: {
						centerMode: false,
                                                variableWidth: false,
					},
				},
			],
		});

```
Please add minified css to npm package
Hello developer
I am using vertical in a mobile project
But it can only be swiped left and right to switch. I checked all your documents and found no relevant instructions.
How can I drag it up and down to switch
Thank you

Adds support for slick font display as suggested by lighthouse:

I have a simple slick-carousel. And want to have an nested element (for example: h3) with attribute "draggable" set to "true" to drag it out off slick-carousel. Is it possible?

I'm using a slick carousel in django html, and my page isn't loading my slick carousel. Specifically the slick carousel on this page. https://htmlstream.com/preview/front-v2.9.3/html/home/app-workflow.html

When there's an odd number of slides and you set `slidesToScroll` to 2, it has a weird behaviour when reaching the end. Instead of continuing with 2 slides, it returns to the "start position".
