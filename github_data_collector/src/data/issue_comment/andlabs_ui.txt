Hi
I want to do pagnation for big text, so I need to calculate the input text size.
Thanks.


Hi,

I love this project since it provides native UI outlook. My question is, when I  make up a window based on it, I could resize it by dragging it edges and then the layout inside the window is shifted which looks ugly. How could I prevent this? I check the ui and libui header files and repository issues, there is no answer.

Thanks.

PS. Is there any confirmation message box widget, which has two buttons - "YES" or "NO" ? 
On Windows, if `MouseEvent()` has been called for an `Area`'s `AreaHandler` (for example by clicking on it), no more calls to the handler's `MouseCrossed()` function will happen anymore, ever. This does not happen on Kubuntu, where `MouseCrossed()` still gets called when moving the mouse over the area.
when I insert one line with rownum 0,the table auto insert next line...
I'm pretty sure the underlying code for these dialogs already support this.
I know GTK supports these options.

For OpenFile, adding file suffixes to filter on would be helpful.
For SaveFile, adding a string that appends a specific suffix to the filename would be helpful.

When there are enough tabs, want to display multiple lines~ thx

In one application we report some sort of progress in the title bar, so the user can see progress even when the application is minimized, e.g. `[34%] My Application` or such. Obviously one should not needlessly spam the OS with UI updates. Still, we were dumbfounded to find that Kubuntu could be made to lock up almost entirely by calling `SetTitle()` 10 times per second. While all applications are still responsive, clicking anywhere on the Desktop is unresponsive. Also the taskbar would lock up while trying to render an animation of the tab of the application appearing and take multiple seconds to settle in. This happens on Kubuntu 18.04. We worked around the issue by reducing the update rate to 1Hz.
window := ui.NewWindow(title, 600, 500, true)

I want to create menu, but I don't know how to do it
generate runtime error

my partial code:
```
	app.mainWindow = ui.NewWindow(getAppTitle(), 320, 200, false)
	app.mainWindow.SetMargined(false)
	app.mainWindow.OnClosing(func(*ui.Window) bool {
		app.hideMainWindow()
		return false
	})

	grid := ui.NewGrid()
	grid.SetPadded(true)

	app.mainWindow.SetChild(grid)
	app.mainWindow.SetMargined(true)

	tab := ui.NewTab()
	grid.Append(tab, 0, 0, 1, 1, true, ui.AlignFill, true, ui.AlignFill)

	tab.Append("Status", app.makeStatusPage())
	tab.SetMargined(0, true)
```

how can resolve?

thanks.

Hello, I've been using https://github.com/dontpanic92/wxGo for a while but moving to this system and it's great! The one thing I'm missing is making a textfield have the blinking cursor with a request focus call. I was thinking about using:

https://github.com/go-vgo/robotgo

To simulate a mouse click inside the textfield. Is this a bad idea?
