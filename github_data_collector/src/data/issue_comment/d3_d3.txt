Hello D3 Family!!!!! @TheLarkInn from [webpack](https://github.com/webpack) here! 

We have been working on a new feature for webpack 4+ which allow's library authors to add a special field to package.json allowing them to declare that their libraries that have "reexports" in them do not contain side effects!

#### Tiny Backstory
Because webpack implements the Harmony Module Specification to spec, we include code that was reexported (even if it wasn't used). This is because all code [per spec] must be eval'd). The beautiful news is that we do not have to implement _exactly to spec_. So we have created what is called "pure-module". webpack as imports are being resolved will also check to see if the module is pure (which is indicated through the `pure-module` flag in the package.json fields). Therefore, there would be no bundle size difference between the following examples:

```
import {bottomAxis} from "d3-axis";
```

and 

```
import bottomAxis from "d3-axis/direct/path/to/d3AxisBottom"
```

#### Proposal
If there are no side-effects within the D3 packages in places where re-exports occur, then I'd love to propose that all D3 packages add `pure-module: true` to their package.json. 

#### Pros
Developers (using webpack) get huge perf wins by doing nothing.

#### Cons
Bit more work to get it all done. 

Please let me know if you have any questions, the webpack team is really anxious to help in any way if we can (that means, submitting PR's, adding issues to individual repo's to track, etc).
