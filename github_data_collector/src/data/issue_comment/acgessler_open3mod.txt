I export the default blender file as glTF. When loading it into Open3mod, it fails - we don't know why it fails.  More information would be helpful.
This is an excellent application - the tabbed interface is very usefull.

Can I suggest a couple of improvements ...

1. If I select multiple .STL files and open them at the same time the app only the first file is opened. Once the app is running the multiple open works OK.

2. Would it be possible to add an option to set the default view to a single window rather than 4.

Happy New Year

Using the program on 125% DPI scaling makes it look blurry, like this:

This can be easily fixed by including the following application tag inside the manifest file:
```
<application xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3">
  <windowsSettings xmlns:ws2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2016/WindowsSettings">
    <ws2:dpiAwareness>PerMonitorV2</ws2:dpiAwareness>
  </windowsSettings>
</application>

```

After I've patched it, the application seems to look okay:

I have installed the binary open3mod_1_1_setup.exe from http://www.open3mod.com/

The attached maze.zip contains the file maze.blend (for blender 2.8) and the file maze.glb ,
that was created from maze.blend by exporting it with the File / Export / glTF 2.0 (.glb / .gltf)
menu command.

When I drag the .blend file into the program, the following message occurs:
"Sorry, this scene failed to load. What the importer said went wrong:
Es wurde versucht, im geschützten Speicher zu lesen oder zu schreiben.
Dies ist häufig ein Hinweis darauf, dass anderer Speicher beschädigt ist.
(in English: Attempted to access protected memory. This is often a hint that
other memory is damaged).

Similarly, the file maze.glb fails to load with the following error message:
"Sorry, this scene failed to load. What the importer said went wrong:
failed to read file: maze.glb (error importing file: OBJ: vertex index out of range)

I cloned this project and tried to open it in Visual Studio 2017 and 2019. It gave me an error concerning a .isproj file. So I removed the .isproj file from the solution, which let me open the solution. I then tried starting the open3mod project, and while the project seems to build and run, it immediately closes with no information in the output window.
If some textures are missing - it is impossible to export model into any format... Would be better to allow used to continue export, inserting some dummy texture instead of not found ones
Some closet design tools use the 3dc file format; I'd like to be able to open those in open3dmod.
Using latest commit. Loading a model with DDS texture, I do see the texture on the model, but the entire model is see-through.
Glad to see that X3D was added to the repertoire ([assimp issue#784](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/issues/784)) and am keen to test.  However the assimp viewer doesn't yet seem to have that update included yet, nor is VRML support apparently included.

Please advise if this support gets integrated, thanks for all efforts.
i can't get to the website.  www.open3mod.com.  anyone else?
