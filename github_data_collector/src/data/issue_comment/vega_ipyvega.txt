Add support for `datetime.date` values in pandas DataFrame as described in #70 

Pandas types the SQL DATETYPE as an Object column with standard library `datetime.date` values. This also comes up when converting an Apache Spark Dataframe with DateType() columns.

A simple check for date values in the object `apply()` function is all that is needed.

It would be nice to provide an easy means for the user to see what version of vega/vega-lite is installed with this package.

Currently (unless I'm mistaken) the only way is to look at package.json, find the vega-embed version, then go to the correct vega-embed release, open its package.json, and look for the vega-lite version there.

I'd love something similar to
```python
>>> import vega
>>> vega.js_versions
{'vega': '4.0.0',
 'vega-lite': '2.6.0',
 'vega-embed': '3.16.0'}
```
The trick is to do that without too much manual bookkeeping...
Is it possible to show char from url like  `IPython.display.Image('my_image.png')` do?
```python
from vega import VegaLite
VegaLite(url='bar_chart_with_labels.vl.json')
```

Can we update ipyvega and/or the altair renderer framework so that ipyvega returns a displayable object rather than calling ``display()`` as a side-effect?
Some database queries return python date objects in pandas frames call `pd.read_sql`. Pandas generally knows how to deal with this, for example, when displaying a table, it formats the date correctly.

However, if this frame is passed to ipyvega `VegaLite(spec, df )` VegaLite throws an error complaining that it doesn't understand the datetime object. I think ipyvega should be able to understand the python datetime object.
I've encounterd a problem with pyvega and the Python print function.
The following example works, hence the figure is displayed correctly in the notebook:

    import altair
    altair.Chart(altair.load_dataset('movies')).encode(x='Production_Budget', y='IMDB_Rating')

If I print anything in this same cell, the figure output disappears:

    import altair
    print('foo')
    altair.Chart(altair.load_dataset('movies')).encode(x='Production_Budget', y='IMDB_Rating')

Is this expected behavior?
Niels
Because many python-generated vega plots result in data being embedded into the notebook, notebook size can quickly grow beyond what the browser can handle (see https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/issues/249). Would there be a way to optionally enable PNG-only mode, where on save (or perhaps on render) the live output is replaced by the PNG and removed?  I think the JS could be tweaked to do this, but it's not clear to me how this could be easily enabled/disabled from the Python side.

This came up in our chat – I think it's a good idea.

Could look something like this:

``` python
class Vegalite(object):
    def __init__(self, spec):
        try:
            spec = json.loads(spec)
        except TypeError:
            pass
        if 'data' not in spec:
            raise KeyError('No data provided with spec')
        self.spec = utils.update(spec, DEFAULTS, overwrite=False)
```

Advantage is more flexible API & ability to out-source dataframe formatting stuff to Pandas; the disadvantage is that in some situations we'd add an extra string->dict->string cycle.
