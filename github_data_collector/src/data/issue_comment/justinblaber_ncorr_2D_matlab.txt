How could I output the displacement gradients such as du/dx and du/dy? I need them to compute cauhy strain.
Although I have installed PCT toolbox and openmp configurations seems to be fine, as I run `handles_ncorr = ncorr`, I get this error:

```
Files compiled, but it was determined that OpenMP 
is not actually supported. Please reinstall Ncorr in 
single threaded mode or use a compiler which 
supports OpenMP
```

Please see that all commands are successful.

Hi Justin,

Wondering if it would be possible to perform the DIC only in a horizontal (u) direction to improve the computation time. I've applied image rectification prior to uploading them onto the reference and current image so that they are horizontally aligned, such that only u-displacement map is necessary. How would we go about executing this?
Hi
I was trying to compile ncorr on visual studio 2019.
But there is an error in code!
How can I fix it?
Threre are several places in code with this issue


```
template <typename T_container> 
    inline typename sub_iterator<T_container>::sub_iterator& sub_iterator<T_container>::operator++() {    
        this->chk_valid_increment();

        // increment sub_p, then determine position from it
        ++sub_p;
        this->p = this->A_ptr->sub2ind(sub_p % sub_h + r_sub1_2D.first, sub_p / sub_h + r_sub2_2D.first);

        return *this;
    }  
```

and the error is :
`overloaded function "ncorr::details::sub_iterator<T_container>::sub_iterator" is not a type name`
This isn't really an issue in the code, but more of request. 

Do you plan on updating  Ncorr to be able to plot the Lagrangian strain on the current image?  This would greatly increase users' ability to present data to audiences. 
Hello,

I have been using ncorr around 2 years, but today what i realized that my department will no longer make matlab available for students. Is there any way to run ncorr without matlab ? Thanks
Can this theoretically work in Octave? This might be good to boost the utility
of your program in the open software universe.

I tried to run this in Octave by following the manual, but I encountered errors.

handles_ncorr = ncorr;
parse error near line 3356 of file /home/jerome/github/ncorr_2D_matlab/ncorr.m

  syntax error

>>> function [handle_name,outstate] = gui_sethandle(pos_parent)


Hi!
I'm using matlab v2017b and contour plot seems not working...I see only borders, without data under it (i assume it should be filled with color, right? ðŸ˜„ ). 
Like here:

Do you have any advices?
