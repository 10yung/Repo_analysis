**Describe the bug**
Dejavu uses `_doc` as the type replacement for v7. However, the _search endpoint `/:index/:type/_search` has been removed starting v7 - which is used by Dejavu for exporting, causing the export to break.

**Dejavu Version**
Web, latest

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Use ES 7.4.2,
2. Connect Dejavu with an index,
3. Export Data

**Expected behavior**
It should export data as it exists in the index (or current view) if selected by the user.

Recommendation: If ES >= 7, don't use the `:type` path variable. Search request should instead use the `:index/_search` pattern. The Document Type dropdown shouldn't be shown starting v7 in the Export Data modal.

**Screenshots**
Network tab output showing that zero results match when `_doc` is used for the type.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.


Is there a way to look up a specific document by its `_id` in the data explorer?  This could help me speed up manual edits of documents a lot quicker, my documents are sorted by a unique text ID, not randomly generated.  

Even if I could search only the `_id` column instead of globally it would really help narrow down potential document matches.  Is that possible instead?

Thanks again - Dejavu is awesome and badly needed for the ES community!
Getting this error while importing the data into DejaVu UI.

Having a local development server without https, I got a mixed content error in query explorer. The regular data browser works. Since I don't use any https locally, I found out that this error came from https://opensource.appbase.io/mirage/dist/js/vendor.min.js and was wondering why it's a remote url. In the network requests, I saw a horrible bunch of requests to remote requests to opensource.appbase.io and also others like stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com.

Because this js file got loaded from https, it's not possible to use my local host without https. That's a problem since I don't have any certificate. I don't see any reason for this locally, since self signed certificates causes extra work and trouble. 

And fetching so much ressources over the internet from third party systems is also a privacy issue that's not expected from a on-prem hosted software. I use this with Docker on the same machine where Elasticsearch is hosted. 

So please move those remote ressources locally for the on prem version. This would fix both problems with privacy/security and also mixed content issues because when they got remoted locally, I don't have https enabled so firefox wouldn't expect https for the elasticsearch connection. 

## Workaround
[Disabling mixed content](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/mixed-content-blocking-firefox#w_unblock-mixed-content) could be a workaround, but it's just a workaround. Dejavu (which itself seems pretty nice) still relys on external ressources and expose me to them by those requests. This ticket is for a reasonable long term solution.
I am trying to install dejavu locally i cloned it and when i try to run yarn i get the error : 


error source-map@0.7.3: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version ">= 8". Got "6.17.1"
error Found incompatible module.
the post request pass a wrong header to the server  **"Basic%20xxxx"**

Export CSV doesn't work, export JSON downloads a text file with 'undefined'
I want to develop the Importer Data module,but i can't find where is the sourcecode.At present,
What I am seeing is the compiled js file located in the package directory.Thank you very much.
I cloned the repo and changed to the cloned folder.
using 
`docker-compose -d`
I then created a new index called geo_states, using curl,
`curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/geo_states`
I was able to navigate to 
http://localhost:1358/importer/?appname=geo_states&url=http://127.0.0.1:9200&mode=edit&sidebar=true
However, when I upload a CSV file, and set the server url and app name, as shown in the screenshot,
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115037/63115741-d81ea580-bf65-11e9-9c5a-38885f9493c2.png)
However, I have no way to proceed further, since, "Configure  data mappings" is disabled and there are no buttons to proceed in the modal dialog. How to resolve this situation? Please help.
