https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/wiki/PyYAML-yaml.load(input)-Deprecation

I am trying to integrate some ipython magics with ansible on SOS kernel. I am able to set ansible_runner directory and use defined var and hosts files. But using ansible_kernel, I am not able to achieve the same. I tried going through the code, where inside ansible/config/base.yml ### DEFAULT_HOST_LIST: has _/etc/ansible/hosts_ as default. But adding any inventory there doesnt seem to work. 
Is there any existing method to control inventory? Having a method to control inventory and play storage files can help share common resources across notebooks without having to rewrite common code.

Thankyou for any help in advance.


**Describe the bug**
ansible kernel hangs under MacOSX and python 3.7.

**To Reproduce**
Create a fresh conda environent, and ansible kernel does not work.

```
$ conda create -n ansible python=3.7
$ pip install ansible-kernel
$ python -m ansible_kernel.install
$ jupyter notebook

**Describe the bug**

In the case of running ansible_kernel on a python3.6 install of jupyterhub/lab; when using the #vault_password keyword the following error is raised.

```
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-2c7e8874a5d5> in <module>
      1 import ansible_kernel.widgets
      2 style = {'description_width': 'initial'}
----> 3 ansible_kernel.widgets.VaultPassword(description='Vault Password:', style=style)
```

```
TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
```

**To Reproduce**
Dockerfile below:
```
FROM centos:latest

RUN curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash - && \
    yum -y install https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm && \
    yum -y install epel-release && \
    yum -y install python36u python36u-libs python36u-devel python36u-pip nodejs gcc && \
    pip3.6 --cert /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem install --upgrade pip

RUN pip3.6 install jupyterhub jupyterlab notebook && \
    pip3.6 install ansible ansible-kernel ipython && \
    pip3.6 install ipywidgets && \
    npm install -g configurable-http-proxy

RUN jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/hub-extension && \
    jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager &&\
    jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension --sys-prefix && \
    python3.6 -m ansible_kernel.install

RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash -p "$(openssl passwd -1 test)" test 

RUN echo $'import os \n\
c = get_config() \n\
c.Spawner.cmd = [\'jupyter-labhub\'] \n' > jupyterhub_config.py

CMD jupyterhub -f jupyterhub_config.py
```

Spin up container with:

```
docker build --rm -f "bug_reproduce\Dockerfile" -t bug_reproduce:latest bug_reproduce
docker run -p 8000:8000 -d -it --name jupyter_bug bug_reproduce
```

* Log in to container via Chrome with user test, password test.
* Open a new Ansible Project. 
* Enter #vault_password into cell.
* Execute cell.

**Expected behavior**
Interactive widget should appear as per second screenshot

**Screenshots**
This is the error which is seen within the ansible_kernel.

This is what should be seen (this example is run directly from python kernel).

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core)
 - Browser: Chrome
 - Version: 72.0.3626.109 (Official Build) (64-bit)
 - Jupyter Notebook Version: 5.7.4
 - Jupyter Lab Version: 0.35.4
 - Jupyter Hub Version: 0.9.4

**Additional Information**
Not sure if it is relevant but running the python snippet shown above in the second screenshot throws the same error when run with #python keyword on ansible_kernel.
Just looking for how to do become: yes and provide a password.

I'm trying to do debug: var: ansible_lvm['vgs'] which needs root access.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently the play context does not end under normal operation.   

**Describe the solution you'd like**
 Ansible-playbook command provides a summary at the end of the run.   Provide the same functionality in the Jupyter Notebook.   It would be nice to have a well designed HTML summary for the tasks.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Not providing a summary.  This is the current state of the tool.


The tests in `/tests` should be run and verified from an automated process.  This could be done by running them through jupyter console, using nightwatch to run them in the browser, or both.
