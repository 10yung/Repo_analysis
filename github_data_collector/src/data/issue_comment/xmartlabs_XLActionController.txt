Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

I noticed if calculated `contentHeight` in `ActionController`, we didn't use `collectionView.contentInset.bottom`. I think it's not correct. 
For example, you can see `DynamicsActionController` that it uses `collectionView.contentInset.bottom` for calculate `contentHeight`.

But both this class use `setUpContentInsetForHeight`. 
So, now `var topInset = height - contentHeight - safeAreaInsets.bottom` (for `ActionController `) ignore `collectionView.contentInset.bottom` and the alert attache to SafeArea without a inset.

I tried to fix it. ðŸ™ƒ 
i set `Device Orientation` is `Portrait` , but when the XLActionController show , it can auto rotate ,
i use `PeriscopeActionController` style , but `PeriscopeActionController` is not open class , i can't override it,
i must add these code to  class `ActionController`:
```swift 
 override open var supportedInterfaceOrientations: UIInterfaceOrientationMask{
        get{
            return .portrait
        }
    }
```
i use these code:
```swift
let bottomPadding = UIApplication.shared.keyWindow!.safeAreaInsets.bottom
        if  bottomPadding > 0 {
            print("\(actionController.collectionView.bounds.height) \(UIScreen.main.bounds.height) \(bottomPadding)")
            let bottomView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0.0,
                                                  y: actionController.collectionView.bounds.height - bottomPadding - 5.0,
                                                  width: UIScreen.main.bounds.width,
                                                  height: bottomPadding + 5.0))
            bottomView.backgroundColor = .white
            actionController.collectionView.backgroundView?.addSubview(bottomView)
        }
```

I found a layout issue in Spotify's action controller. you can see it if you run the example on iPhone 11 Pro in simulator and in section Spotify also I'll send a screenshot for more info
info: the "Start radio" button is under cancel button.

Any chance to add support to SPM?

Before submitting issues ...

- Make sure you are using XLActionController [latest release](https://github.com/xmartlabs/XLActionController/releases) or master branch version.
- Make sure your Xcode version is the latest stable one.
- Check if the issue was [already reported or fixed](https://github.com/xmartlabs/XLActionController/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue). We add labels to each issue in order to easily find related issues. If you found a match add a brief comment "I have the same problem" or "+1".

When submitting issues, please provide the following information to help maintainers to fix the problem faster:

- Environment: XLActionController, Xcode and iOS version you are using.
- In case of reporting errors, provide Xcode console output of stack trace or code compilation error.
- Any other additional detail such as example code that you think it would be useful to understand, reproduce and solve the problem.

Having the option to specify accessibility labels and accessibility identifiers would not only make this project more usable in projects that need to cater to users with handicaps, but would also simplify UI testing in projects using XLActionController.
This adds support for SwiftPM manifest based dependency managers. Specifically this adds support for installing via [Accio](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio) but will probably also work with SwiftPM once it's integrated into Xcode.

Please note that this project is part of Accio's official [integration tests](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio/tree/work/1000-frameworks/Demo/Shared/AppDependencies) within the [Demo project](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio/tree/work/1000-frameworks/Demo).
