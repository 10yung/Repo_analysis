Hi there

Looking for a solid Slider option for my Processing project, I found Swipe and thought it would
be my best option. So I kind of ported it, in its simplest form, to Processing, the Graphic Programming
language for Artists and Designers

You'll find it here
https://github.com/rich-gg/PSwipe

The purpose of this post is not to advertise but to ask if what I've done is ok for you
and if I can keep it on in GitHub

Congratulation for Swipe, it is really nice
rich
Swiping right/left does not work on android while it works on iOS devices. When i run my application on iOS devices, i am able to swipe and also auto slide works well but when it comes to android only auto slides works and not swipe events. Its a Hybrid application and uses same JS for both the devices.
Please help me out with the issue. 
I'm pretty sure it was working on older versions of Safari, but I've recently found a bug where each image (slider/swipe item) is not loading the next image until the previous one is off the screen and causing a gap between images. This happens after 2-3 clicks on the `next()` slide.

It's tricky to explain so I've recorded a quick screencast to demonstrate: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hwbi16481ygmb16/swipe-safari-issue.mov?dl=0

All other browsers are working fine and wondering if anyone else is having the same issue.

macOS: 10.13.2
Safari: 11.0.2
Swipe: 2.0.0

```js
const slider = document.getElementsByClassName('slider')
for (var i = 0; i < slider.length; i++) {

	const sliderCount = slider[i].dataset.moduleCount
	const prev = document.querySelector('.slider__prev-' + sliderCount)
	const next = document.querySelector('.slider__next-' + sliderCount)
	const swipe = document.querySelector('.swipe-' + sliderCount)

	window.mySwipe = new Swipe(swipe, {
		startSlide: 0,
		speed: parseInt(swipe.dataset.speed),
		auto: parseInt(swipe.dataset.delay),
		draggable: true,
		continuous: true,
		disableScroll: false,
		stopPropagation: false,
		callback: function (index, elem, dir) {},
		transitionEnd: function (index, elem) {}
	})

	prev.onclick = mySwipe.prev
	next.onclick = mySwipe.next

	if (mySwipe.getNumSlides() === 1) {
		prev.classList.add('hide')
		next.classList.add('hide')
	}
}
```

Any help would be appreciated.
The width calculation of the parent of `swipe-element` creates an issue wherein the last `swipe-element` does not display on higher resolutions 1920x1080. On lower resolution this problem does not seem to occur.

The issue being with the Math.round for calculating the width of the parent.

For example I'm displaying 63 images in the swipe inside modal, the width is 76185px in Chrome and in Edge is 76185.69px but the last image does not display, if I go and increase the width by one pixel the image display. This does not occur for the cases only for some only in Edge browser.
