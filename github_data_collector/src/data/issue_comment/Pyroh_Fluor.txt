Added instructions on how to activate function keys for the Touch Bar
Will you update this app's repository with the latest code from flourapp.net's release (2.0.2 I think?)
Fluor works great when running Microsoft Office applications in a Parallels Windows 10 VM, it's so helpful. It doesn't recognize the Windows application when Parallels is switched to coherence mode though, it would be nice if it did. This might be difficult to do, so more of a wish list request than a bug report.
There's an issue, that reproduces often enough to considerable, I think.

App does react on desktop apps being switched, but it happens after some time (several seconds). This might cause confusion and undesired results. Example: I have Fn keys set up for my IDE and media buttons for everything else. I use some applications, then switch to IDE and want to skip song. Pressing fn + F9 (I am in IDE already and I know that media keys here work with fn key only), but system still thinks media keys are in priority so I get F9 pressed instead. In different IDE's this might be set to different actions, e.g. start building project ðŸ˜‚  which is something I don't want.

Can something be done about this? Palua did not have this behaviour, but it is not available anymore.

I use latest Fluor 2.0.2 build1289 with MacOS 10.14.1
I know that there would be a lot of work to allow the functionality for external keyboards and this is why it wasn't done yet, but why not to cope it with the script which will change the standard f key functionality in MacOS Preferences? Something like the thing done here: https://github.com/jakubroztocil/macos-fn-toggle
This could make it work with external keyboards with small effort. 

What do you think about it? I could also help with that (even though I didn't program with Swift yet).
I know, that for many users it is useful to have an overview on the current state of the app, but why not to add the possibility to hide the icon in the menu bar? I like to keep it clean without any additional apps like Bartender or alike. Then it would be possible to access Fluor again after launching it one more time manually, when it is already running. I think that should be possible, this is how the other apps often handle it, for example BetterTouchTool.

That would be a nice addition to the current (very beautiful) UI.
The app crashes on me on Mac OS X 10.11.6 (El Capitan).

Nothing useful in the Console:

```
Exception Type:        EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP)
Exception Codes:       0x0000000000000002, 0x0000000000000000
Exception Note:        EXC_CORPSE_NOTIFY
```

Is this app not supported on 10.11?
This application works great with a keyboard however, on my Touch Bar MacBook Pro, when I click an application that has the **function key override**, the default Touch Bar appears.

I want this setting to also toggle the setting under **Keyboard** Preferences:
_Touch Bar shows_: **_F1, F2, etc., Keys_**

This way, I don't have to press the **function** key, so see the function keys, hence defeating the purpose of the application.

When I click off of the application, it should switch back to:
_Touch Bar shows_: **_App Controls with Control Strip_**

If you could do this, I'd gladly make a donation to the development team.
Not much to say hereâ€”I just recognized that the icons placed in the switch elements are not scaled to fit the parent box.
See below:

By the way, there is another tiny thing that could be improved.
The 'About Fluor' window does not have the option to close itâ€”so you actually have to quit Fluor and restart it in order to get rid of it.

Keep up the great work and thanks for Fluor :)
Icons in readme have been broken
