I am unable to automatically retrieve database connection credentials from AWS secrets manager and use those credentials to log in with DataGrip.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->
I'd like to pass a secret name to a datasource and get a connection as a result.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->
Manually copying values from a secret is a current workaround, but auto-rotation could cause headaches.

**Additional context**
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->

As a user of this plugin, I want to be able to connect to an RDS instance using an Amazon managed secret. That way, I can manage my database passwords without having to manually open the console and update my password when it auto-rotates.

Echoes #1238, but specific to using secrets manager.
Minor documentation.

Attempt to avoid choco.

- codebuild provides dotnet 2.2: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#runtime-versions-buildspec-file
- Windows build succeeds without `netfx-4.6.1-devpack`. Did the tests silently skip?

Also, [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-available.html) says:

>  The base image of the Windows Server Core 2016 contains the following runtimes. 
> ...
> dotnet | 2.2

For reference, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script provides `dotnet-install.ps1` but that's for dotnet core, which the image already includes. We apparently need .NET framework plus whatever the "devpack" includes?

- powershell alternative to choco (get URL from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/deployment/deployment-guide-for-developers)): 
  ```
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=863262" -OutFile installer.exe
  .\installer.exe /norestart /quiet
  ```

Experimental changes!

I am taking the nuclear option on our credentials abstractions in prep for multi-partition support.

At the end of the day we need to be able to create AwsCredentials scoped to the `ToolkitCredentialsProvider` (now `ToolkitCredentialsIdentifier`) and the AWS partition.

We want to cache these across projects so the user can be only prompted once (like MFA prompts), but this means we need to get the region data into the flow where we create credentials. This has led to changing method signatures and ripping out useless indirection.

**Describe the bug**
A parameter containing a one (or more) blank space characters is truncated at the first blank space.

**To reproduce**
1. Create a new project template (AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31).
2. Define a String parameter with a default value of "cron(30 22 * * ? *)"
3. Define a resource (AWS::Events::Rule) with the ScheduleExpression property having the parameter above as its value.
3. Deploy the project.
4. Locate the new Change Set.
5. The parameter value will shown as "cron(30"
6. When executing the resource (CloudWatch rule) will fail with "Parameter ScheduleExpression is not valid."

**Expected behavior**
The parameter value "cron(30 22 * * ? *)" should be shown and used by the Change Set.

Exception in plugin AWS Toolkit (1.10-193).

**To reproduce**

**Expected behavior**
Expected using aws toolkit to be able to run locally lambda functions and deploy them once tested.

I installed aws toolkit on pyCharm 2018.3 and then upgraded pyCharm. Then restarted pyCharm or another reason independent from this problem. After the restart I could not see the plugin icon aws-toolkit on the "start new project" list of plugins.

the clone command works when running from a fresh terminal.
I get the error when I run the sam build with --use-container on my terminal.
I do not get it if I don't have --use-container with some other dependency.

I think the docker container is missing the known hosts?
I might be able to confirm that if I can sneak a known host file onto the docker container.
Not sure about what other options there are other than passing known hosts into the sam build somehow.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When updating or creating a CF stack using AWS Console we may use empty parameters. Currently (version 1.10-192) the plugin doesn't allow a deploy with empty parameter values.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Be consistent with the way CF Console works accepting empty values.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
There's no alternative, the CloudFormation template has to be modified to work around this limitation.

**Additional context**
No additional context.

## Description
Add an SSO credential provider
