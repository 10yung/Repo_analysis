### Checklist for this issue
If your issue is about the regex used in `email` rule, please note that as of version 1.12.0 this plugin is using the same regular expression that the HTML5 specification suggests for browsers to use (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#valid-e-mail-address). We will follow their lead and use the same check. If you think the specification is wrong, please report the issue to them. If you have different requirements, consider using a custom method.
In case you need to adjust the built-in validation regular expression patterns, please follow the documentation (http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.methods/).

### Subject of the issue
I have form where user can dynamically add or remove rows, names of input files is for example "colorkeeper_project[rooms_attributes][][surfaces_attributes][][name]"
I have no idea how to deal with it, when I make rule for "colorkeeper_project[rooms_attributes][][surfaces_attributes][][name]" only the first row is validating.

#### Description
This plugin prevents passwords that are founded on the top 100K hacked passwords list. This list was released by Britain’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) in collaboration with the Have I Been Pwned website.


when using jquery.validate versions later than 1.14 generate invalid numeric errors.
Error: Validation error 'Please enter a multiple of 0.' incorrectly display for Number inputs.  
The error occurs here:
if ( decimalPlaces( value ) > decimals || toInt( value ) % toInt( param ) !== 0 ) {
				valid = false;
}
even when there is no decimal places.

### onkeyup should not exclude Down arrow and up arrow keys for input type number

### Your environment
* version of `jquery-validate`: 1.19.1
* which browser and its version: Chrome 78.0.3904.87

### Steps to reproduce
https://jsbin.com/yemewoliha/1/edit?html,js,output

* Enter 0.
* Click Validate.
* Click inside the input, press up arrow, the value change, but the error message is still displayed until focusout.

### Expected behaviour
On numeric input, keyup or keydown change the value of the input, the validation should run, the error message should disappear immediately.

### Actual behaviour
The validation is not executed on keyup because arrow keys are excluded, the error message is still visible.

I am doing attribute validation using ASP.NET MVC (incl. jquery unobstrusive).

` [Range(typeof(bool), "true", "true", ErrorMessage = "You must accept the Terms")]
        public bool TermsAccepted { get; set; }`

The thing is it will not submit the form while the checkbox above is checked.
If I uncheck it the form gets submitted.

**Question:**
Where can I see the validation function to see what is going wrong, means: How to debug this?

### Subject of the issue
I think that the step validator should use a different formula. 

### Your environment
jquery, which is 3.4.1 and jquery validate 1.19. 

### Steps to reproduce
Use a numeric input with min=17 and step=5 and try to enter a value like 87. It will trigger the step validator and say the value must be divisible by 5. 

### Expected behaviour
If the validator would subtract the min value from the entered value, and then divide by the step value, 87 would/should pass validation. 

### Actual behaviour
The step validator is triggering when it should not.
