 Fixes using filters on properties in arrays

Problem is related to the use of | character in filters as | character is handled as OR in regex. This makes replace singe get multiple matches which in the end leads to multiplied data by number of | characters.

Additionally I have added test case testParsePairWithAbs in ParserFilterTest. Initially I was thinking to modify the existing tests to check for nested array elements as well. But this will require changing almost all the test methods. So I've added the new test method based on testAbs() which checks that abs filter works in various nested array properties

I've noticed some style issue. CodeSniffer replaced
```
if (count($keyVal) == 2)
```
to
```
if (count($keyVal) === 2)
```
So I also included this change in the commit

This PR Fixes #2360

Bug:
redirect()->to('/?param') returns url without param

If param has not value, it removes
/?param=1 => /?param=1
/?param => /

In php if you open page with ?param in $_GET array you will see this:
array (
	[param] => '',
)

Wrong single quote

Hello,

It seems that there is a problem with the layouts and I think that this is due to "ob_start / ob_flush / ..." in the renderer.
It will be easier to explain my problem with an example...

```
public function send(): string
{
    $email = view('email');
   
    // Send email script here...

    return view('confirmation');
} 
```

View "email" extends a layout "x" with a section called "body".
View "confirmation" extends another layout "y" with a section called "body".

Sometimes (but not always), "view('confirmation')" displays the "body" section of "email" and "confirmation". The renderer merges both sections even if the layout is not the same.
This is really annoying. For the moment, I try to prefix all my sections in each layouts but it would be better if I didn't have to do this kind of things.
All models have single pager.
Opportunity to change parameter whith we get current page.
Models now dont work with $_GET['page']
fix .#2473
in userguide. attributes type is array. but in code type is string.

I wanted to use CodeIgniter4 in an Oracle environment.
Also, it was determined that support would be provided because ORACLE was described in the document.

For postgres db doesn't work for 'php spark migrate' command.
The 'migrations' table and the table specified in migration is always created in public schema and not in the schema specified in the .env file.
Correct migration only works by specifying database schema directly in the app\Config\Database.php file.
