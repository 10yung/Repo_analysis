Added methods documentation special characters escaping

Hi,

This pull request fixed the below error.

```
Fatal Exception: NSInvalidArgumentException
-[__NSCFString replaceCharactersInRange:withString:]: nil argument
```

I think it would be better to check whether a replacing text is nil or not.

Thank you for this great library.

It would be nice if replacement methods would work on mutable strings too.

so you can match `@(\\w+)` as example
