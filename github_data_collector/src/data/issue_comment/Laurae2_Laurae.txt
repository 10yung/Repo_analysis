Hi Laurae,
Congrats with this superb library.
With few observations xgboost some times returns the same probability to each one, and having the same probability with different labels makes get.max_acc report the inverse of accuracy & the max threshold also is incorrect if we assume that positive obs are > threshold (not >=)

To reproduce it:
get.max_acc(rep(0.502,8),c(0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1))

It gives 0.125 accuracy with 0.502 threshold

Thanks for your time
I am having trouble installing Laurae2/Laurae into Rstudio version 3.5.2.  I write into R:
devtools::install_github("Laurae2/Laurae")

And receive the following error:
Error in read.dcf(path) : 
  Found continuation line starting '    modeling. ...' at begin of record.

I have found another user having trouble with a different package, but am unsure how to apply the solution to my answer: https://github.com/psoerensen/qgg/issues/3

Cheers!
Hello Laurae, thanks for your response earlier about my question about emulating daForest.

This time I have a question sort of related to validation_data=NULL #6, in that I want to make sure I understand how to properly do training & testing to try to avoid overfitting. I tried running CascadeForest and got excellent results on training and held out validation data (where I knew the labels), but when I applied the model to test data (exclusive of my train & validation data, and where I did not know the labels but the contest website gave me my score), the model did not perform very well. So, I believe I am overfitting.

Basically, I trained CascadeForest using d_train & d_valid like this:

CascadeForest(training_data = d_train,
validation_data = d_valid, 
training_labels = labels_train,
validation_labels = labels_valid, ...)

Where: d_train & labels_train = predictor columns & known labels (65% of my total training data)
d_valid & labels_valid = predictor columns & known labels, exclusive of d_train (the other 35% of my total training data).

My AUC was something like 0.96 when I then predicted on d_train and also when I predicted on d_valid. So, that made me happy, and I then applied the predict function to d_test, which is exclusive of d_train and d_valid, and where I don't know the true labels, but I submitted my predictions to the contest website and got a 0.75 AUC, not nearly as good as 0.96.

So that made me think I should use cross-validation in CascadeForest, like this:

CascadeForest(training_data = d_alltrain,
validation_data = NULL, 
training_labels = labels_alltrain,
validation_labels = NULL, ...)

Where: d_alltrain is all my training data (= 65% + 35% = 100%), and labels_alltrain is all my known labels for all my training data.

But, I got the error as noted in validation_data=NULL #6. I have not yet tried the solution you suggest to fix the lines of code to work for cross-validation, but is this the proper way to do cross-val? Then if I get a good AUC indicated by the model (on cross-val d_alltrain), and then apply the model to d_test then that is the proper way to try to avoid overfitting and I should hope for a better score?

Thank you very much.

Hello Laurae, this is is not an issue per se, but a question/suggestion... is there a way to create the function of daForest using your cascade & MG scanning algorithms? Thank you

Trying to install the Laurae2/sparsity package so i can convert from sparse matrix to SVMLight. however, i keep getting this error message Installation failed: Timeout was reached.
I am behind no proxy, and have all dependent packages installed. 
I've also tweaked around with options(download.file.method = "") with various methods but to no avail. Searched the web, tried everything and still no success. Is the package still available for download and installation? I'm using R version:

Hi, I try to set validation_data=NULL, but after 1 Layer it stops by this message: Error in alloc.col(dt1, length(colnames(dt1)) + length(cols)) : 
  alloccol has been passed a NULL dt
Could you help me? Thanks
