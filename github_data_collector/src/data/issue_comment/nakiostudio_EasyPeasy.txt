For some reason `activateConstraints` and `deactivateConstraints` might contain same constraints. That requires further investigation but deactivating after activating solves the consequences of the issue in my case.

It would be really nice to have a Swift Package Manager version of EasyPeasy. Trying to start some projects without Cocoapods and can't live without EasyPeasy anymore haha ðŸ™‚ 
```
view.easy.layout {
  Top()
  Left()
  Right()
  Bottom()
}
```

it's just we can define layout without `,`.
Sometimes, I want to add constraints edges of a view to other edges of a view.
But now, Edges() only allows adding constraints to its superview.

I tried to use EasyPeasy to add percentage margins, but EasyPeasy treats it as a constant, not multiplier.

```
subview.easy.layout(
            Top(0).to(guide, .top),
            Left(*0.5),  // <- incorrectly set the left margin to be 0.5 pixel
            Right(0),
            Height(*0.5).like(superview) // <- correctly set the height to be 50% of superview
        )
```

What is the correct syntax to apply multipliers to margins?
We've found an issue in one of the project that is using EasyPeasy. When you create a constraint using `*` operator (e.g. `Width(*1.5)`), it would set not just the `multiplier` to `1.5` but also the `constant`. As a workaround we're currently always explicitly providing a constant: `Width(==0 *1.5)`.

I think it will be better if EasyPeasy has method-chain API.

```
let view: UIView

view
  .easy
  .bottom(16)
  .top(8)
```

But, I can't think all of the cases.
Can we add that API?
```

Feature request: 
I sometimes wish there was a way to drop one of the constraints of an element. 

Like for example, I have a dynamic screen where the last element's Bottom() constraint is always set to scrollView's Bottom. When I add more elements to it, I wish to remove the Bottom() constraint of current last element so I can set the newer element's Bottom() to scrollView.

Hope this makes sense.
