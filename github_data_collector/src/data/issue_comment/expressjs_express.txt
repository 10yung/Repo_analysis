When you have route like this:
```js
app.get('/:id', (req, res, next) => {
  const id = req.params.id;
  ...
});
```

And you visit URL `/:id` (exactly like that), it crashes express server. Shouldn't it just make `id === ':id'` instead?

It's possible to avoid crashing by using `app.use((err, req, res, next) =>`, but still...

The error is:
```
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The first argument must be one of type string, Buffer, ArrayBuffer, Array, or Array-like Object. Received type undefined
```
I have read and understood the project's Contributing guide.
I also have read and understood the process and best practices around Express triaging.

I request for a triager role for the below orgs:

jshttp
pillarjs
express
fixed response jsonp deprecate and comment 
I use domain to catch the error

```
var createDomain = require('domain').create
 function(req, res, next) {
  var businessName = req.domain;
  var domain = createDomain();
  domain.id = req.id;
  domain.add(req);
  domain.add(res);
  allModels.forEach(function(mongooseModel) {
    if (typeof(mongooseModel) == 'function' && mongooseModel.length == 1) {
      domain.add(mongooseModel(businessName));
    } else {
      domain.add(mongooseModel);
    }    
  })
  domain.run(next);
  domain.on('error', function(err) {
    next(err);
  });
```
and this function as a middleware for app.use before error handle

but in the error handle middleware the req don't match the error
```
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
    errorHandler.handleUncaught(err, req, server);
  });
```
Thank you for any help.

As a member for the OpenJS foundation, we are required to have a well defined charter for the project.  I tried to pull it together based on the [template they provide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/master/PROJECT_CHARTER_TEMPLATE.md) and our existing docs. 

This is part of the onboarding process: https://github.com/openjs-foundation/project-onboarding/issues/15
As a member of the Open JS Foundation, we need to add the code of conduct to all project repos.  To get started I wanted to at least get it on the main repo, and then if we are good with this we can automate adding it to the rest.
