1. Updated the Demo App codebase to support Swift4.2
2. Changed Swift version in .swift-version

hello, in your demo project, the view controller would't be released(memery leak).After I added `unowned self`, the view controller has deinit, but demo will crash. It will append <= iOS11, it's look like system bug. 
Just a heads up, a lot of stuff gets messed up when large titles are used in iOS 11. 
When I quickly pull the collectionView, the screen will refresh twice or more times. It seems that because the value of "loading" is not updated immediately. 
if (scrollView.isDragging == false && loading == false) {
               loading = true
}
These codes will be executed many times. Do you have a good method to solve it?

Thanks
There is a `addPullToRefreshWithAction` method to add refresher but there isn't a `removePullToRefresh` to remove it in some case, someone who implement this would be appreciated

I tried, not working.

When the UITableView has a UISearchController's UISeachBar as the 'tableHeaderView', the library seems to break and not work as expected at all.

1. New LoadMoreView added to "scroll to load more" action (or infinite scroll)
2. renamed ScrollView extension function names to make them more Swift'ish (no more "withSomething"  in function names) 
3. example code changed to reflect refactoring and new functionality
4. move closure params to the end of list, to make possible call it like that:

``` swift
            tableView.addPullToRefresh {
                NSOperationQueue().addOperationWithBlock {
                    sleep(2)
                    NSOperationQueue.mainQueue().addOperationWithBlock {
                        self.tableView.stopPullToRefresh()
                    }
                }
            }

```
