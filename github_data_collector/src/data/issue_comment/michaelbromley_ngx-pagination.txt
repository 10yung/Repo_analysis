Hello, I want to use the filter feature, but in a server-side context. How can I acheive that please ?

I tried to do this :

```ts
export class EventsListComponent implements OnInit {
  events: Event[] = [];
  page: number = 1;
  perPage: number = 20;
  total: number = 0;
  search: string = "";
  
  formGroup: FormGroup;
  subject: Subject<any> = new Subject();

  constructor(
    private eventService: EventService,
    private notificationService: NotificationsService,
    private formBuilder: FormBuilder
  ) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.listEvents(1, this.perPage);

    this.formGroup = this.formBuilder.group({
      search: [ '' ]
    });

    this.subject
      .pipe(debounceTime(500))
      .subscribe(value => {
        this.search = this.formGroup.get('search').value
        this.listEvents(1, this.perPage, this.search)
      });
  }

  pageChanged(event){
    this.page = event;
    this.listEvents(this.page, this.perPage);
  }

  onKeyUp(): void {
    this.subject.next();
  }

  listEvents(page: number, perPage: number, search?: string): void {
    this.eventService.list(page, perPage, search).subscribe(
      (resp: EventResponse) => {
        this.events = resp.events;
        this.total = resp.total;
      },
      err => {
        this.notificationService.error('Error while listing the events', err.error, {
          timeOut: 5000,
          showProgressBar: true,
          pauseOnHover: true,
          clickToClose: false,
          clickIconToClose: true
        })
      });
  }
```

But it is not working, and the URL is called twice, each time. What am doing wrong ? An example on the documention could be awesome to be honest ! I am pretty sure this use case is very common ! :)

Thanks :)

Can i fix this problem? How? Or need a update of ngx-pagination?

Thanks a lot.

I have an `angular` app in which i am implementing `pagination` using `ngx-pagination` but `pagination controls` is not displaying correctly.  

I have `html` regarding pagination  in my `html.component.html`

             `<div class="col-12 text-center">
                    <pagination-controls id="hmPage" (pageChange)="crntPage = $event" directionLinks="true" autoHide="false" responsive="true" previousLabel="Back" nextLabel="Next">
                    </pagination-controls>
              </div>`
 
pagination control are not displaying correctly. I uploaded pagination view screenshot [here](https://ibb.co/1ssMY4N)
Please see and let me know what's the problem in there?
I am using ngx-pagination ,I want to hide the Ellipsis  and only show the limited pages.but I didn't any properties/css styling for this .Do we have such option with ngx-pagination.Any Suggestions will be helpful

Hi! 
I'm suggest adding "disabled" attribute(@Input disabled: boolean) for disabling component when data received from server (server-side paging).

Can you add this functionality in your component?

Right now I can use css property "pointer-events: none", but i think that "disabled" is a more elegant solution.

Thanks.
**Angular version**:
8.2.3

**ngx-pagination version**:
4.1.0

**Description of issue**:
Default component `PaginationControlsComponent` does not export the `paginationApi`.

**Expected result**:
Default component `PaginationControlsComponent` should, in my opinion, also export the `paginationApi`. In my case I don't want to bother with the implementation of the whole pagination structure, so I just edited the styles of the default component. Now, I'm not sure if there's any way to actually get access to the API, which would be great in case I'd want to change something based on the pagination state.

**Actual result**:
I'm currently left with only one option, which is to style my entire pagination from scratch.

Of course, I can create a PR to fix the issue. Also, this should not be a breaking change at all. Let me know if this is something you're happy with. Thanks.

**Angular version**: 8.0

**ngx-pagination version**: 4.1.0

**Description of issue**: Multiple controls in same page not working properly.

**Steps to reproduce**: Try adding one more item in https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-e1f9hq?file=app%2Fapp.component.html itself.

**Expected result**: Controls shall work independantly.

**Actual result**:

**Demo**: (if possible, edit [this StackBlitz demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-e1f9hq) and paste the link to your fork)

Any relevant code:
```
<div class="list">
		<ul>
			<li *ngFor="let item of collection | paginate: { itemsPerPage: 10, currentPage: p }">{{ item }}</li>
		</ul>

    <ul>
			<li *ngFor="let item of collection1 | paginate: { itemsPerPage: 25, currentPage: q }">{{ item }}</li>
		</ul>
		<pagination-controls (pageChange)="p = $event"></pagination-controls>

    <pagination-controls (pageChange)="q = $event"></pagination-controls>
</div>
```

**Angular version**: 8.1.3+

**ngx-pagination version**: 4.1.0

**Description of issue**: Due to design, array and pagination controls arent on the same component so i used the PaginationService to comunicate beetween those. It's work but the 'change' Observable emits 2 values instead of 1

**Steps to reproduce**: It happens on the Stackblitz demo, here is a picture
https://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2019/8/19/3031425802b9428b27fe293e80405901-full.png

**Expected result**: Emit only 1 value

**Actual result**: Emits 2 values

**Angular version**: 5.2.9

**ngx-pagination version**: 4.0.0

**Description of issue**:
I have an Ionic with Angular application. I created a custom component which receives two input params `currentStep` and `totalItems`. As you can see in the attached Stackblitz, we start in the HomeComponent page. If we click the "ClickMe" button, we go to the InstructionsPage, which makes use of the custom pagination template. The thing is that, if I press the "Go back" button, I return to HomeComponent but, if I press the "ClickMe" button again, an error is thrown.

**Demo**: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ionic-5s2qwc

Sorry, I know there are other similar issues in this repo, but none of then have worked for me or I haven't been able to catch the error in my code.
