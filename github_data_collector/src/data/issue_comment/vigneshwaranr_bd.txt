bd folder name does only echo the target directory but does not actually switch to it.

I am using ubuntu 19.10 and fish 3.0.2, the same problem does exist in bash. Is there something to make it change the directory instead of just printing the target directory?
alias bd='cd ..'
Wouldn't it be great if `bd` could also match substring at any potion?

Use case:
```sh
pwd
~/some-repo.git/3rdparty/component/src/include
bd git
pwd
~/some-repo.git
```
bd works fine for me on debian unstable other than cd `bd p` from the examples. It gives me this error:
devil@siductionbox:~/work/Linux-User/CD-Helferlein/Screenies$ cd `bd p` /Todo
(where ToDo is a sub-dir of work)
bash: cd: Zu viele Argumente.
which translates to:
bash: cd: too many arguments

Any idea what might be the reason for that?
Let me know if you need any more info

The auto-complete suggestions are shown in directory nesting order and not in alphabetical order....
eg: /home/owner/github/project/src

```
owner:/home/owner/github/project/src $ bd <tab-key><tab-key>

home  owner  github  project  

```
May be related to commit b89095930f3b56c61395589aa389080f82a839d4, I propose returning to POSIX shell compatibility instead of commiting to supporting only bash
Currently completions are ordered alphabetically. Would be nice if there were an option to sort them in the order in which they appear in the path -- so if current working dir is `/home/user/Desktop/stuff/`, then autocomplete would go:
```
$ bd <tab-key><tab-key>
home user Desktop
```
Should support updating bd by itself or by passing a param
- Invoking 'bd -update' should update itself
- Should figure out itself if new updates are available in github and notify the user to update.

What is the effect of `bd` (without any parameters)?

In most cases it does `cd ..`, wich I like!

But consider this:

```
$ pwd
/home
$ bd
/home
$ pwd
/home
```

Expected: `cd` to `/`
