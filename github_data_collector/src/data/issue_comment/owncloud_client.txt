# README

We are using [calens](https://github.com/restic/calens) to properly generate a
changelog before we are tagging a new release. 

## Create Changelog items
Create a file according to the [template](TEMPLATE) for each 
changelog in the [unreleased](./unreleased) folder. The following change types are possible: `Bugfix, Change, Enhancement, Security`.

## Automated Changelog build and commit
- After each merge to master, the CHANGELOG.md file is automatically updated and the new version will be committed to master while skipping CI.

## Create a new Release
- copy the files from the [unreleased](./unreleased) folder into a folder matching the
schema `0.3.0_2020-01-10`

## Test the Changelog generator manually
- execute `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) toolhippie/calens:latest` 
in the root folder of the project.

Handbook - https://handbook.owncloud.com/release_processes/client/change_log.html
Placeholder based VFS (user-facing `.owncloud` files) will always be an experimental option. I'd never recommend branding users to enable it for their end users. So, there is no necessity to change the placeholder files with the branding.
