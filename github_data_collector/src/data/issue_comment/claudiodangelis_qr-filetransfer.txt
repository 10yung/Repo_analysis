Added error handle
I'm opening this issue because:

- [ ] I have found a bug
- [x] I want to request a feature
- [ ] I have a question
- [ ] Other




- Creates a custom usage message
- If there are zero arguments print the usage message along with the error message
- Also moves the argument check before the check for the force flag, so the config isn't deleted when there are not a valid number of arguments

```
usage: qr-filetransfer [-debug] [-force] [-quiet] [-zip] file [file ...]
  -debug
    	increase verbosity
  -force
    	ignore saved configuration
  -quiet
    	ignores non critical output
  -zip
    	zip the contents to be transfered
```
If the code has tests, we can add jenkins so that merging PRs becomes easier.
It would be great if instead of hosting the file it could be auto uploading to a file sharing host. 

https://www.file.io/  has an API that is free.
Not all users are tech-savvy enough to use command-line tools, what about bringing the concept of "scan & transfer" to regular desktop apps?

There might be a couple of usages, for example:

1. User launches the app, the main window is just a panel through which they can drag and drop the file(s) onto, or click a good old "Select file(s)" button
2. User drags the file(s) onto the app icon itself (I think many mac apps work this way)

Afterwards, a QR code is displayed and users can scan & download.

What do you think? Please share your ideas on this, thank you!
Downloading files over HTTP is never a good idea, even if you're just downloading from your own laptop. Fortunately Go makes super easy having a HTTPS server, feel free to steal the code [here](https://github.com/bettercap/bettercap/blob/master/modules/http_server.go) and [here](https://github.com/bettercap/bettercap/blob/master/tls/cert.go#L14) ^_^
I'm using iTerm2, with Source Code Pro as my monospaced font. The QR code doesn't scan reliably, as there's some gaps where the pattern should be continuous. Is there a Unicode char that is guaranteed to take up the entire height/width that could be used?
