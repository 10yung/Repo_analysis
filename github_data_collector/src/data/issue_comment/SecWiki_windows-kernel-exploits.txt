CVE-2019-0708 的POC及exploit均已发布。请求在repo上更新。
Hi. I am trying to compile the cpp with Visual Studio 2017 but the output is like the one in this picture (it translates to "you can not assign a value of type "const wchar_t *" to an entity of type "LPWSTR"") . I tried adding a cast using "const_cast<LPWSTR" and also using  "(LPWSTR)" before it, but then the .exe file does not work. 
The steps i am doing are in Visual Studio 2017 are:
- I create a new Project > Visual C++ > Windows console application
- I download and paste the code
- Change the cmdline variable to get the reverse Shell
- I add the line '#include "pch.h"' at the begginning because otherwise i can not compile the Project and get the .exe file.
- I change the option "x86" to "x64", to get a 64-bit file.

So if i add the cast it compiles but does not work and if i do not add it, it does not compile.

Thank you very much!!
