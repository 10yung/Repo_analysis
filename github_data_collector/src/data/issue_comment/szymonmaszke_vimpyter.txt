If directly `:e test.ipynb` will not get this error. 

Thank you!
How can I make vimpyter to use a python executable defined as python3_host_prog rather than the default python3 ?
I'm not sure if this is related to #7, but some notebooks I open are working, and others are empty. Is there any way to see why this is happening?
As the title says, post your ideas below.
Hi, 
Thank you for your amazing plugin.
Since the filetype is not python, the plugin UltiSnippets does not trigger the python related snippets. Do you have any idea?
I'm on windows 10

I installed notedown with 
```bash
conda install notedown
```
```

    notedown:          1.5.1-py_0 conda-forge
    pandoc-attributes: 0.1.7-py_1 conda-forge
```
I installed vimpyter as 
```
Plug 'szymonmaszke/vimpyter' 
autocmd Filetype ipynb nmap <silent><Leader>b :VimpyterInsertPythonBlock<CR>
autocmd Filetype ipynb nmap <silent><Leader>j :VimpyterStartJupyter<CR>
autocmd Filetype ipynb nmap <silent><Leader>n :VimpyterStartNteract<CR>
```
When I start gVim, I get this error:
```
notedown executable is required in order for this software to work. Check 
whether you have needed dependencies installed in README.md
```

I guess I have to specify the path to notedown executable? Here is where conda installs it:
```
(base) C:\WINDOWS\system32>ls C:\Users\kiril\Anaconda3\Scripts\notedown.exe
'C:\Users\kiril\Anaconda3\Scripts\notedown.exe'
```


This looks really handy! I often have spaces in my notebook filenames and it seems like that breaks something. It just loads up an empty buffer when I try.
Is there any way to have the Jupyter notebook refresh automatically on save? Or even manually via a command?

(Just to add: this is an amazing plugin -- thank you! I've been interacting with Jupyter notebooks more and more in my data analysis work, and had been desperately hoping that someone would make something like this!)
