import `css`  directly from `react-withstyles` is [deprecated](https://github.com/airbnb/react-with-styles/blob/master/src/withStyles.jsx#L251).

If themes is [registered using React Context API](https://github.com/airbnb/react-with-styles#option-1-using-react-context-recommended), calling `css` function will crash (because theme is undefined).
This fix passes the `firstDayOfWeek` propdown to the `getVisibleDays` function and uses it.

Fixes #1899.
I found this issue when trying to customize the day picker for our own project. It can be reproduced by adding a story like this to Storybook:

`  .add('blocks weekend days', withInfo()(() => (
    <SingleDatePickerWrapper
      isDayBlocked={(day) => moment.weekdays(day.weekday()) === 'Sunday' || moment.weekdays(day.weekday()) === 'Saturday'}
      autoFocus
      enableOutsideDays
      firstDayOfWeek={1}
      numberOfMonths={1}
    />
  )))`
The `numberOfMonths` prop is not required to reproduce the issue.

Here is the result:

This is the same in all months. Notice that all Saturdays and Sundays are blocked as expected, including the first one of the outside range, except for the last one displayed.
If I look at the html, I see that the last day doesn't get the `CalendarDay__blocked_calendar` class and also the `aria-label` doesn't say "Not available.".
If I click that last day, it doesn't get selected, so to the click event handler it is blocked.

The issue also exists if I make the `isDayBlocked` function always return `true`.
The issue does not occur when I leave out `firstDayOfWeek={1}`.
I'm in a situation where I've got a start date, and an end date, but they are not consecutive fields, because of a start time field between them.

[ StartDateField, StartTimeField, EndDateField, EndTimeField ]

Is there an existing way to get the benefits of the DateRangePicker on the SingleDatePicker?
I'd like to show the range highlight on one calendar, when the other date has been selected.
- `ariaInvalid` allows for more accessible form validation
- `ariaDescribedby` allows users to use custom elements for the field description instead of the built in `screenReaderMessage` behavior. 
#1892 
I suppose following issue because of firing **onClearFocus** with start and end dates from props, that's not right it should use values inside **onEndDateChange** function
If dates are not choosed from calendar but entered manually in inputs onClose handler returns null or previous date in endDate. It is visible in storybook https://airbnb.io/react-dates/?path=/story/drp-calendar-props--with-onclose-handler

**react-dates version**
e.g. react-dates@18.3.1

**Describe the bug**
Hi, when I change the width of the browser window (Chrome), the calendar goes outside of the view (only horizontal), to the left. It calculates and add inline CSS, something like `top: 66px; left: -1272.05px;` - for browser width: 1860px. This happens and, if I change the height of the browser window. It goes always to the left and it doesn't matter, if I make the window bigger or not, it just goes to the left  

**Source code (including props configuration)**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
```
<DateRangePicker
  startDate={this.state.startDate}
  startDateId="your_unique_start_date_id"
  endDate={this.state.endDate}
  endDateId="your_unique_end_date_id"
  onDatesChange={({ startDate, endDate }) => this.setState({ startDate, endDate })}
  focusedInput={this.state.focusedInput}
  onFocusChange={focusedInput => this.setState({ focusedInput })}
/>
```
If you have custom methods that you are passing into a `react-dates` component, e.g. `onDatesChange`, `onFocusChange`, `renderMonth`, `isDayBlocked`, etc., please include the source for those as well.

You can see only the arrow here (all the calendar is outside to the left):

Fixes #1550

**Disclaimer:** this fix is probably very naive and I make it for the sole purpose of bringing attention of contributors and maintainers on this bug that has been around for way too long now. Given that neither of:
- the very long comment
- the git commit history
- the tests
- my very dysfunctional brain

are of any help at understanding why `relatedTarget` was looked for in the first place, and given that it introduces a bug in the `appendToBody={true}` case, this is the most logical PR I could come up with.
Really sorry for the off-topic issue, but I've run out of official channels trying to point a couple of obvious bugs in the Airbnb web app:

1. [Search in reviews doesn't find certain existing words](https://twitter.com/dandv/status/1190098256715567105)
2. [Review text swallows whitespace](https://twitter.com/dandv/status/1177433124470435840)
3. [Suggested places "in and around" are nowhere near](https://twitter.com/dandv/status/1179273805866455040)

Can someone ping the relevant devs internally please?
