## Objectives

Make it possible to register and login using a Wordpress Oauth server.

The feature will be disabled by default. To enable it:

- Go to the admin panel -> Settings -> Features Tab [Image 1]
- Configure your Wordpress Oauth credentials in your `config/secrets.yml` and reload your Rails server.
```
production:
  wordpress_oauth2_key: ""
  wordpress_oauth2_secret: ""
  wordpress_oauth2_site: "https://your.wordpress.server.domain"
```

- Use the Wordpress button from the Registration or Login page [Image 2]

## Objectives

When a user supports a proposal, it should automatically activate also the "Follow citizen proposal" option. The proposal notifications will be sent not to all users supporting the proposal but to the users who have activated the "Follow citizen proposal" option. In the notification digest, under each notification it will appear also the link to unfollow that particular proposal.

## Visual Changes

For the most part, there are no visual changes. There are only behavioural changes (Supporting a proposal causes the follow button to also be toggled active). However, there is now a link in the proposal notification digest email which leads to a page where user can unfollow the proposal. It looks like this:

![proposal notifications](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40895962/71502540-e04c0180-28c4-11ea-8a33-8836f42f14c0.png)

## Summary of code changes

### Change to proposals controller and associated views

Calls to the vote action now also cause a Follow to be created. When this triggers the vote partial to be rendered, if there is a follow object that has been passed, it triggers a rerender of the follow button partial also. This means that both buttons are rerendered simultaneously when the vote button is pressed.

### Change to Proposal model

users_to_notify only returns users who have followed the proposal, not users who have supported it.

### Change to mailer

Proposals notification mailer view includes a small link which invites the user to unfollow the proposal, as shown in the screenshot above. This necessitated adding a line in mailer.yml. Possibly you will want translations in other languages? If you provide me with a Spanish translation I would be happy to add this to the PR. I have also corrected some minor errors I noticed in the English.

### Spec changes

My changes caused some specs to break. This was the case when there were tests that assumed that users who supported a proposal would be sent notifications about them. This is no longer the case, because they have to be _followed_ to that proposal and not merely support it. Secondly, I updated the specs for users_to_notify for this same reason. I removed the test for deduplication because duplication should only occur if there are users who exist in both supporters and followers list and now there is only the followers list which is looked at in the method. Finally, I added to the test to check for the unfollow link in the notifications digest and to make sure that clicking support also creates a follow.

Please let me know how I can improve this PR or any of my changes! Also I tend to commit often, so can rebase this history if required. Thanks!
Enjoy!

## Objectives

This PR try improve how the gender is called, compacting everything with [enumerize](https://github.com/brainspec/enumerize) gem

## Visual Changes

Before
```ruby
  scope :male,           -> { where(gender: "male") }
  scope :female,         -> { where(gender: "female") }
  scope :other,          -> { where(gender: "other") }
```

Now
```ruby 
 enumerize :gender, in: [:male, :female, :other], scope: :shallow
```

## Notes
So, now, to add another genders, just to change in `models/user.rb` and to call then is the same way.
This PR must be merged after #3882.
