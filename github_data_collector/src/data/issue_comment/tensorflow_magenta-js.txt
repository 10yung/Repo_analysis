Hello! 

I have a project and I need to use the [Short Term Fourier Transform](https://tensorflow.github.io/magenta-js/music/modules/_core_audio_utils_.html#stft) directly but I noticed that despite being the documentation I cannot use it. Would it be possible to export the function so that it could be used? Or is there another way to access it that I'm not seeing?

Thanks Ãµ/
As README.md says, 

> "all the offset data has been normalized to have a standard deviation of 1.0 on the training set, after simplifying the strokes. ...Thus each dataclass has its own scale_factors to scale down, and these numbers are usually between 60 to 120 depending on the dataset. These scale factors are stored into model.info.scale_factor."

I thought the scale_factor should be the std value of all the offset data in a class. However, checking the the std value of the `bird.full.npz` dataset and the scale_factor in [bird.gen.json](https://storage.googleapis.com/quickdraw-models/sketchRNN/models/bird.gen.json), I found they are different (41.006386 v.s. 71.3754). 

How can I calculate the correct scale_factor?
I can use web workers in the following code:

**simple.html**
```html
<html lang="en">
<body>
<script>
  new Worker("simple.js")
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

**simple.js**
```js
importScripts("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@1.4.0/dist/tf.min.js");
importScripts("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@magenta/music@^1.12.0/es6/core.js");
importScripts("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@magenta/music@^1.12.0/es6/music_vae.js");

const musicvae = new music_vae.MusicVAE("https://storage.googleapis.com/" +
    "magentadata/js/checkpoints/music_vae/trio_4bar");
musicvae.initialize();
```

Which works properly. But if I add the following line, the code breaks:

```js
importScripts("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@magenta/music@^1.12.0/es6/gansynth.js");
```

With this error:

```
Uncaught null
Script error.
```

I don't have more information, I'll try to debug the gansynth.js code if I have time.

P.S. ES5 modules don't work because of "This browser does not support Tone.js".

It would be useful to be able to supply an audio version of a NoteSequence (either pre-rendered using better quality sound fonts or a recording to which the NoteSequence is aligned, for example to showcase a transcription algorithm) and play it while visualizing the NoteSequence.

I can imagine an `AudioPlayer` which would play the audio using Tone.js and call the `run` callback in sync. An interesting option would also be to bind the visualization to an `<audio>` element, which would allow the user to easily control the playback and have the visualization updated in real time.
The README file is translated in Korean for better development by Korean developers.
`midiconvert` used by Magenta.js seems to consider both channel 9 and 10 as drums (as per General MIDI 2), so when loading a MIDI file with `urlToNoteSequence`, notes in channel 10 will have `isDrum == true`. This is inconsistent with the behavior of Magenta, where only channel 9 is loaded as drums (as per General MIDI).

Among other things, this means that MIDI files created with Magenta and containing more than 9 non-drum tracks will be loaded incorrectly in Magenta.js.
`SoundFontPlayer` sometimes continues the playback for a very short time (invoking the `run` callback) after the `stop` method has been called. This typically happens when there is a rapid sequence of notes.

This can cause problems for example when using the player together with a `Visualizer` and trying to `clear` it or display something else on the same canvas immediately after calling `stop`. In this case, the old `NoteSequence` will overwrite the new content of the canvas.

I found that if you reduce the tempo in https://glitch.com/edit/#!/groove-drums, the loop cuts out early. I believe it has something to do with the callback length being defined using totalTime before the transport begins.
Hi,

I was trying to use the [BodyPix](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/body-pix) model with Magenta but the tfjs version required is 1.0.0. Is it possible to update it ?

Thanks!
