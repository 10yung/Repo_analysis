Hi,
  I can not remove images on flexslider without page refresh

Here is my code.

`<flex-slider slider-id="slider" flex-slide="images in artistAllImages track by $index" animation="fade"
   animation-loop="false" sync="#carousel" slideshow="false"
   control-nav="false" >
<li>
       <img ng-src="<?php echo base_url()?>uploads/<?php echo $this->session->userdata('user_id').$this->session->userdata('firstname') ?>/{{images.pic_name}}" alt="" style="width:100%;">
<div class="imageDes">
                        <div class="mobInput"><input type="checkbox" ng-click="selectPIC(images)" ng-checked="img1==images.artist_pic_id || images.img1==1"></div> 
                        <textarea class="imageDesLeft" placeholder="Add Description..." value="{{images.pic_description}}" ng-model="images.pic_description">{{images.pic_description}}</textarea>
                        <div class="imageDesRight">
                            <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="saveDescription(images)"><img src="img/yellowpen.png" alt=""></a>
                            <a href="javascript:void(0);" ng-click="deleteImage(images)"><img src="img/del.png" alt=""></a>
                        </div>
                    </div>
</li>
 </flex-slider>
`


There is some version compatible with ng5 ?
1. You can send me please the link of angular-flexslider licence?
2. What the version number of angular-flexslider?

Thanks

angular-flexslider with thumbnails - after adding dynamic slide its problem to set it active slide
Hi. 
first thanks for providing this angular directive. 
I was trying it out and one of my requirements was to have a thumbnail slider and when a user clicked on the thumbnail it would display the selected image on a model popup.

All this is done by your directive when both are visible on the page but it seems that the sync attribute does not work if the slider is hidden on a modal or if has the style display:none set.  
Regards.

Hello:
Is this expected behavior?  I have used this slider two ways:  One way is by coding two flex-slider tags where one uses the "sync" property pointing to the other and that other one specifying the "as-nav-for" property pointing back to the first one, and another way is just a straight copy of your thumbnail-controlnav.html sample that is provided in the examples folder of your download (BTW the highlighted thumbnail in that navigator is not in sync with the picture shown above it).  The behavior I see with both of these examples is that when a thumbnail is clicked on in the thumbnail navigator the picture is shown above it however the slider loop animation does not resume from that point.  Is there a property that can be set to have animation continue from there?  Thank you for your time.


I did not verify closely, but I think this part of code is wrong in case an element is removed from the collecition:
103                     e = removeSlide(e, collection.indexOf(e));

Should 'collection" be "oldCollection"? as the element `e` already removed from the new collection, so `collection.indexOf(e)` alway return -1. what's the point.

There is no License file in the project please add.
