I want to show the time grid in the wave plot,  can be this achieved using FDWaveFormView?
I looked at the "Examples" folder in the repo but it's not very clear how this would work with a playing audio. I am able to display the waveform and I can tap to change the highlighted part of the waveform, but I can't figure out how to connect this progress to the playing audio file. Please help.
I am trying to load the same audio file after an refresh and through skip forward/ backward  button .But when i reload the graphview after a forward and then a backward, the audio wave image change often.

Also cannot adjust the y scaling of the wave graph 

awaiting your reply,Thanks. 
The boundToScrub property allows for the choice of scrubbing to affect either the start or end of the highlighted samples range. Really not sure on the most clear terminology to use, so please review this to make sure you're happy with the names used.
How can i increase the width of the bars ? They are too thin and squeezed
Waveform when reading this movie is not displayed correctly.
The latter part seems to have been cut off.

When zoomed in, you can swipe the view until the last part of the waveform is on the left edge of the screen. This seems a bit disorienting to me. It would be nice to have an option so that the end of the waveform stays at the right edge of the screen.
