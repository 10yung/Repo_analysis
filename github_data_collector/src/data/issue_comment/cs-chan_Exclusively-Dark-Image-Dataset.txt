Thank you for this awesome work! 
I would like to do some study based on your paper and novel ExDARK dataset. Could you provide the image list of the MS-COCO subset and its division of train/val/test sets in your paper "Getting to know low-light images with the Exclusively Dark dataset"?
Thx!

Hi, really thx for your useful data!
Besides, I thought SPIC is good. Is it convenient to offer data after using “SPIC” cuz I don’t have matlab Q_Q. Thx!
