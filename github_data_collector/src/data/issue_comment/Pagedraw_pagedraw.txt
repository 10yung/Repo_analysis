The downloads do not work.
I was trying to use pagedraw.

git clone https://github.com/Pagedraw/pagedraw
cd pagedraw
yarn install

In pagedraw app create new Artboard and rectangle in it.
Then  "Preview" button

Got error  **chromewebdata/:1 Not allowed to load local resource: file:///pages/undefined/play/9847489285036914/**

4.9.0-9-amd64 SMP Debian 4.9.168-1+deb9u2 (2019-05-13) x86_64 GNU/Linux

Are preview working on windows/macOS? 
Any chance to make preview work?
Electron app wouldnt start for me. I get no windows.
So I removed `show: false` from `new BrowserWindow({show: false})`
And enabled dev tools. Errors are attached.

Followed the install Procedure
Started Dev server
Started run-electron
```

Additional Info
```
OS: MacOS Mojave

Not sure what I am doing wrong.
Would appreciate some help in this matter.




How do I import a sketch file?
I realize this product has just been open sourced and a community has not yet formed. Anyway i'm throwing this idea out there because i think it could be interesting.

When exporting to React, Angular or another framework, first some internal representation is created from which the export can occur. Let's call this internal representation Pagedraw Model (PM). The PM could be least common denominator which the frameworks support. Maybe this idea is somewhat similar to https://github.com/andlabs/libui but then for the web.

When the PM can be extracted/downloaded. It can also be uploaded by users for other users to get the component for their framework of choice. Right now there are collections of components for particular frameworks such as [for react](https://github.com/brillout/awesome-react-components). But they don't offer a good search function (only textual with browser search function). When there are a lot of components in the collections searching becomes more difficult. The PM could help with this. By having a definition it could be queried like "show me all the models with a single text input and a button". Making such a search would not be easy, but searching for the type of things can be done. [Hoogle](https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/) comes to mind when searching for types (not that i suggest that this can be used 1on1 for a component search).

It's not difficult to imagine a repository or marketplace from here if you will. I hope someone finds this idea useful. I don't have the time, means and resources to work on it at the moment. But i would like to discuss it a bit more.
Hi @jaredp and co!

I was trying to get Pagedraw to load on a browser locally, and subsequently, deploy it.

I went through the following:
- cloned the repo
- `yarn` and then `yarn devserver`

If I visit `http://localhost:3000`, I get the message described on #2:
`This is a placeholder needed for our build system in dev mode. You should never see it.`

If I just served `desktop-app/index.html`, I get the following error
<img width="632" alt="screenshot 2019-03-01 17 02 51" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3149580/53636012-d033a900-3c44-11e9-8aea-7bce3b9a4749.png">

Any tips on getting it to work on a local browser? :)

Thank you!
