When I make a symbol with a text field that has auto sizing, then add text that adds extra lines, update layout doesn't take those extra lines into account. Am I doing something wrong or does fluid not support dynamically entered text?
**Use case:**
I have a group full of groups + layers - they all base their Y position as 100% of the previous sibling.

I now want to demo a version where some of those groups + layers are hidden. I don't want to delete them, and I don't want to change the layer order as it's so brittle.

**Possible approaches:**
Allow constraints to ignore groups / layers when they're hidden.
Allow a setting per-group or per-layer that can toggle it to 'Ignore' when layout is updated.
Allow a setting to add a keyword to group/layer names to have them ignored.
Let's say you have group contining 2 other groups. The second group contains anything (just to be there). The first group is pinned to previous sibling, top 0 px, left 100% and contains a square mask 200 x 200 px and a second visible square 100 x 100 px.

As long as the small square (or any other visible item) is inside the mask everything is fine. The first group is positioned right next to the first group.

Now move the small square 100 px outsinde to the left of the mask. On update the group will now be moved about that amount of pixels to the left overlapping the first group. (which I do not understand. I'd understand if it would be orientated at the part outside the mask therfore goning more to the right.) Same is happening when the small square is going topwards out of the mask.

When you have no pinning activated the group wil move to top left endlessly with every update.

Every time you hit "update layout" it adds the previous value on top of an existing one and therefore destroys the whole layout.

If you define a relationship between a text-layer and its background (for instance to model consistent padding for a button), I define a left and right margin of 22px. Every time you hit update layout, 22px gets added to the already existing 22px and so on.

This error unfortunately makes the whole plugin unusable.
Hi, I'm having this issue since I'm using Fluid (thats a ling time ;) I want to give a rectangle which works as a background or container a height of 100% of the group. When the group becomes larger it works. The rectangle adapts to the increasing size of the group. When the group becomes smaller it doesn't do anything. But when I decrease the rectangle to a smaller size than the group it works. See attached gif. A fix of that would be so nice! Thank you

Hi, thanks for this plugin!

can you please add support for comma in the pinning value, actually support point " . "

Thanks.
Thanks for fluid, it help me a lot.

Is it possible to fix the toolbar to the sketch side menu panel(left or right). So I don't need to call it out every time.

Thanks.
Hey Matt, one future request from me. It would be cool if we can toggle artboard size for more than 1 artboard at a time. This feature will boost a lot of people's workflow/productivity and will make the Fluid plugin even more awesome!
Would increase codebase agility & ability to response to Sketch updates, and encourage oss contributions
Currently, we can create constraints and preview them swell as export images from it.
This is great for the design process but what is sad is that these properties cannot be exported or viewed like https://github.com/utom/sketch-measure from https://github.com/utom. 

It would be great to combine what he has done interns of filling that gap between a design and developer but show constraint values @utom
