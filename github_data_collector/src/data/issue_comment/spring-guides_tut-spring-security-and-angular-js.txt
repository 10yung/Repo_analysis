I removed all the ways to create a project other than using start.spring.io, since we have been pushing that way of making projects (Josh Long standing on the S1P stage repeaging start dot spring dot io).
@dsyer 
Hi Dave, My project structure is 
1. Eureka Server
2. API Gateway It has it's own ui built in along with Zuul proxy enabled.
3. SampleMicroservice with it's own UI and serving 4 another backend microservices.

My main gateway is hosted on port 7000. When i try to open http://localhost:7000 it loads properly all my user interface is enabled to me. My problem is when i click on button displayed to nevigate to SampleMicroservice then it loads and immediately comes backs with an error core.js:7187 ERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): Error: Cannot match any routes. URL Segment: *********

My idea is it keep on looking the route in gateway angular code, whereas the expectation is user should completely navigate to SampleMicroservice user interface
i am able to obtain token from auth server using zuul but im when i try to use the token it says token not valid


Hi!

Sorry for weak English and for reviving the topic, but come on ...

I have a situation very similar (https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-spring-security-and-angular-js/issues/43) to the one you presented, but with some peculiarities. See if you can help me with any suggestions.

I have 3 UI applications in angular 7 and today all authenticate separately, I want to change this. Today, authentication is done using the grant flow password. I want to implement a single sign on for these 3 applications.

I started a study that can be analyzed in reposit https://github.com/LeandroFChaves/spring-security-oauth2 where I created a client, a resource and an authentication server. The idea is to create one more client, one resource server and both to authenticate in the oauth server with SSO, starting with the principle that if it was first logged in one while accessing the other client it will not have to log in again.

I thought of using the Zuul proxy to do this somehow, but I confess I'm lost.

My client already has a configured proxy that will point to some server that I imagined would be responsible for the single sing on with zuul, but I caught on that part.

As you have practically gone through the same situation, can you give any tips on how I can go on?

One important note is that my client is 100% javascript with angular, in most cases the situation is different.

Thank you.

# Fixed URLs

## Fixed But Review Recommended
These URLs were fixed, but the https status was not OK. However, the https status was the same as the http request or http redirected to an https URL, so they were migrated. Your review is recommended.
