I think it'd be useful to have contents summary with navigable links on top of primer, what do you think?
publish error on version 6.5.3

I want add it to a library database, but can't add if not ISBN
In https://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/combination/forkjoin.html, if I use these examples with RxJS `6.5.3` it gives me deprecation warnings because the new suggested API accepts an Array of Observables.

It would be helpful if the examples could be updated to use the new recommended APIs rather than the deprecated APIs.
Manual subscriptions are replaced with async pipe. This change also allows to use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` for performance optimization.
Hello. I love the site, I use it often, thanks for your work! I noticed refCount and publishReplay are no longer on the site. Is this intentional?
Thanks!
Add visualization  for each code example(or just for each operator code example). Like https://rxviz.com/
pluck can be used after combineLatest/withLatestFrom as well

`map(([unusedValue, usedValue]) => usedValue)`
can be replaced by
`pluck(1)`

It's not documented. Can be?
Hi,

I just stumbled over the following behavior:

I think the operator needs more explanation, have not found any official docs for this yet.
