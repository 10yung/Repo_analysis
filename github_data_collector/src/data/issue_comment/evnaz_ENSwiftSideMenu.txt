Hello, I have used the ENSwiftSideMenu and navigated to the second view controller but I was facing an issue like when I want to go back to my parent view from child view how can I go using popViewController  , Normally by using NavigationController  we used to go back   self.navigationController?.popViewController(animated:true) , but here  how can  I go please help me asap urgent .!!!
Error I get when installing new pod.

[!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "ENSwiftSideMenu":
  In Podfile:
    ENSwiftSideMenu (~> 0.1.3)

How can I work around this?
I want menu button only in home page. I don't want open menu button in other controllers

I have been using this solution from 2 years based on different solution discussed in [#75](https://github.com/evnaz/ENSwiftSideMenu/issues/75). Recently I checked for updated version on your repo but came to know that this feature was never applied, so I have created a pull request.
Tried same way as I did with NavBar and just cannot find the solution?

how can i close or disable or remove side menu when i logout?
I have created UITableViewController as a side menu in storyboard. but it is not showing in side menu. 
The same issue is with UIViewController.
