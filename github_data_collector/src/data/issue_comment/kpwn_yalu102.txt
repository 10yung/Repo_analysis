This is not a support forum or generic mailing list.

This form is exclusively for reporting issues caused directly by the inner workings of yalu.

Direct your jailbreaking questions to one of these fine communities:

* https://reddit.com/r/jailbreak
* http://www.jailbreakqa.com/

Issues, which are not related to yalu's code, may be closed without comment. Do NOT post about: Cydia, tweak, respring/bootloop or app issues UNLESS you have evidence that they are caused by an error in the jailbreaking software itself.

(Delete this bit after reading, and replace it by "I read the issue posting guidelines.")

Support compiling with Xcode 9. If system function is not available, then use popen function.
Replaced qwertyoruiop OTA disabler method to the traditional one which was widely used by many previous well-known jailbreak tools such as Absinthe, Corona Injector, Evasi0n, p0sixspwn, Pangu and Taig.

Bundled SCP, SFTP and OpenSSL binaries in order to make dropbearSSH work with WinSCP and Cyberduck.

Replace all system() functions with posix_spawn functions in order to make it compatibles with Xcode 9 and using Cydia AutoInstall's API to install openssl due to the limitation of posix_spawn() function.
is patchfinder64.c  not open source?

Only just realized my iPad Air 2 is still on ios 10.0.1 and decided to jailbreak. Followed all the steps in a tutorial and got to the part where yalu102 was installed on my iPad, I trusted the app pressed go but Cydia won't show up for some reason. Help.
