This is horrifying that you require a username / password of github just to "encrypt" some variables. It's a serious security issue, and should probably be handled by Oath with Github's API instead.


https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb/blob/master/lib/travis/cli/encrypt_file.rb#L70 is missing the path argument for the calls to env_name https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb/blob/master/lib/travis/cli/encrypt_file.rb#L79
Depends on https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-api/pull/991
When running the `encrypt-file command`, the travis client adds two encrypted environment variables to the project configuration (for example: `encrypted_123456789ab_key` and `encrypted_123456789ab_iv`).

The prefix of the name of these two variables is randomly generated.

In order to specify this prefix we can now use this new `--env-prefix` option.

For example:
```
travis encrypt-file --env-prefix myprefix
```

will generate two variables named `myprefix_key` and `myprefix_iv`
The "all completions in one file" approach you use with `travis.sh` prevents it from being incorporated into one of zsh's best built-in startup optimizations: the ability to lazy-load shell functions and, optionally, combine completion functions into a cached bytecode dump.

In order to make it compatible, you'd do as follows:

1. Put the zsh completion definitions into their own file.
2. Add `#compdef travis` as the first line
3. Name that file `_travis` and put it in its own folder
4. Inform users that they can let `zsh` autoload it by adding the folder it's in to their `fpath` before calling `compinit` to initialize the completions system.

Users who want to reduce the time completions take during shell startup can:
1. Replace the `compinit` call in their `.zshrc` with `compinit -C` and call `compinit` less frequently (eg. nightly) somewhere else. (`compinit -C` skips the check for whether the completion cache is stale, which involves a bunch of disk I/O to search `fpath` for the corresponding script files.)
2. Call `zcompile -U ~/.zcompdump` after `compinit` to generate a compiled bytecode version of the completion cache that `compinit -C` will prefer over the uncompiled version.

I can vouch for this working because I did it on my system.
Reversing the order of the `fetch_token` function allowing users to login and use that token instead of the environment variable first.

Fix for https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb/issues/694
Travis CLI tool will always disregard login if the environment variable is set. This is causing some issues when users want to use there login but need to have the TRAVIS_TOKEN set.
The documentation for Windows users trying to install RubyInstaller (under the Windows section) https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#windows

The documentation for Installation https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#installation
does not work for windows

> Then run:
> $ gem install travis -v 1.8.10 --no-rdoc --no-ri
> 

This did not work for me on windows10, but after installing the most current Ruby
ruby 2.6.5p114 (2019-10-01 revision 67812) [x64-mingw32]

`$ gem install travis
`
did work fine and keys can be encrypted.

Please change the documentation so that Windows Installation is  correct.

Also it would be wonderful if encryption was make much simpler to do using a web page, similar to appveyor, in order to make it much easier for Windows Developers and to save over 1gb of files taking up unnecessary space.

Thank you.
I installed Travis CLI on Mac OSX Catalina using the command, `brew install travis`. The installation is a success, but when I attempt to run a basic command like `travis --version`, I get the following error:

/usr/local/bin/travis: /usr/local/Cellar/travis/1.8.10/libexec/bin/travis: /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/2.3/usr/bin/ruby: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
/usr/local/bin/travis: line 2: /usr/local/Cellar/travis/1.8.10/libexec/bin/travis: Undefined error: 0

Can someone please look into this issue?
