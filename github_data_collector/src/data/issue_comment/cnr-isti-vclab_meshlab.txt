MeshLab_64bit_fp v2016.12
OS: Windows 10

1. Currently the minimum width of "Project" window starts limited by the layer name size.
2. Currently the minimum width of "Project" window increases when the dropdown of a layer is opened, and does not decrease when the dropdown is closed.

* If a layer has a very large name, the starting minimum width of "Project" window is too large.

* If the filename associated with a layer is very large, when the dropdown of the layer is open, and you alt-tab away and return, the minimum width of the "Project" window becomes too large

**Expected behavior:**

* Be able to reduce "Project" window width to any size
* If "Project" window width increases when a layer's dropdown menu opens, decrease window width when layer's dropdown menu closes

Dear Meshlab developers,

I really find Meshlab to be invaluable, both as a mesh viewer, and as a platform on which to quickly experiment with the many algorithms in the VCG library. I know that writing this tool was likely many thousands of hours of work, maybe even unpaid, and surely not well-acknowledged. Thank you so much. I hope you can continue with your enthusiasm in improving this free software. 

I will now bring up an issue that will likely contradict the existing tradition, but I think that it is important to address, now that Meshlab is basically the standard tool for mesh viewing. 

The pop-up asking users to send developers an email, which I see every couple of days, is a nuisance. I understand the logic behind it, and again, I admire your work. But please consider for a moment that your busy day is often interrupted by the Linux kernel, your favorite code editor, or the app you use to find a date :) persistently reminding you to thank its creator. The first time you likely will be glad to be informed of something you did not know, but after a few more attempts you won't appreciate it, as much as your life depends on that functionality. 

I will request Meshlab become a mature software, part of the vital infrastructure we use daily, and limit itself with a standard note in the "About" menu that mentions the developers, with additional information in the documentation, etc. True, we'll think less of its creators that way, but we, developers, are already used to be contacted only when our stuff is broken, and I don't think we need constant praises to do a good job. 
The meshlab documentation at https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/meshlab/tree/master/docs did not see any love for 10 years.

The meshlab.1 and meshlab1.txt docs need to be merged and converted to .md format. 

Same for meshlabserver.1 and meshlabserver.1.txt

The outdated build instructions should be removed, as there is a dedicated document for that, at https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/meshlab/blob/master/src/README.md

The link pointing to http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/wiki/ needs to be removed, as it is dead.

The meshlabserver page does not explain at all what meshlabserver is. It is just a copy and paste job from the meshlab page. If I undertand correctly, and that page does not say it, meshlabsever is a batch mesh processing tool, which takes inputs from the command line and outputs files, without starting a GUI. It also needs to explain what functions it supports, how they are invoked, and to document the script it can take as input. 
Dear meshlab developers, and Paolo in particular,

I have found meshlab to be very useful in my daily work. Thank you for your creation!

At the same time, I think that the pop-up window that comes up every several days (in my intensive usage) reminding me to send email to Paolo to tell him how great the tool is is a nuisance. 

If every tool out there that we love to use daily would pester us that way, the world would not be a good place. Can this pop-up be turned off?
vcglib devel branch and meshlab were used. This project was run on ubuntu16.04LTS system.
However, errors occurred when make as follows:
**/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -ljhead
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
Makefile:385: recipe for target '../distrib/meshlab' failed
make[1]: *** [../distrib/meshlab] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory '/devel/meshlab/src/meshlab'
Makefile:93: recipe for target 'sub-meshlab-make_first-ordered' failed
make: *** [sub-meshlab-make_first-ordered] Error 2**
The associated solutions in the "Issues" did not work!
Could you please give some suggestions?
There are some plugins that aren't in the qmake file despite being in the meshlabplugins directory.

A few build or build with minor updates:

- filter_aging: the .pro file says "no longer needed" but it does build and work just fine.
- filter_bnpts: Same as above, though it looks more specialized
- edit_hole: Needed minor tweaks to build, but seems to be OK: successfully closed a hole in the stanford bunny
- edit_texture: Needed minor tweaks to build, segfaults (in TextureEditor::SelectFromModel()'s call to ResetLayout) when you try to use it.
- sampleplugins/io_m: built fine
- sampleplugins/sample_xmlfilter: built fine
- sampleplugins/sampleio: built fine

Others are outdated enough that they probably should just be removed unless their functionality is sufficiently useful to merit the effort to update them.

- edit_pickpoints
- edit_slice

Others I don't know at all:

- sampleplugins/sample_pclfilter: Requires PCL, has an unimplemented filterArity method
Hi,

I'm trying to import an .obj file, and I get an error message saying the texture E:\EL is not found.
The path to the texture is E:\EL BEAT\XYZ\... 
So I guess currently texture paths with spaces are not supported...
I have installed last snap version on Ubuntu 18.4 and I obtain a message error 

While opening: '/home/alsen/MyShare/blob.asc'
Failed to open:/home/alsen/MyShare/blob.asc

when Import Mesh... from File menu.

What is the problem ?
Thanks

Hello ,

We compiled meshlab successfully but it generates the segmentation error when the running the executable `meshlab ~/data/bunny.ply` in the  meshlab/src/distrib  directory.

Here is the Error.
```
Shader directory found '/export/home/azad/meshlab_test/meshlab/src/distrib/shaders', and it 
 contains 19 gdp files
Segmentation Error Core dumped
```

Kindly Help
My ply file's header is as follows:

ply
format binary_little_endian 1.0
comment MLIB generated
element vertex 81369
property float x
property float y
property float z
property uchar red
property uchar green
property uchar blue
property uchar alpha
property ushort label
element face 153587
property list uchar int vertex_indices
end_header

Among them, "property ushort label" can not be  recognized , which is the label of per vertex for 3D semantic task. Loading the ply file with meshlab, then export it from meshlab to disk. The header becomes
ply
format ascii 1.0
comment VCGLIB generated
element vertex 81369
property float x
property float y
property float z
property uchar red
property uchar green
property uchar blue
property uchar alpha
element face 153587
property list uchar int vertex_indices
end_header

"property ushort label" lost.
