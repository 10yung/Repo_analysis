It seems like the app runs out of memory after a certain period of time.

Here is a console log:

I'm working on a project where the background liquid "fill" animation will need to be paused by a user interaction. I'd like to have the waves continue to crest, even when the animation is not filling the view. 

Have you considered adding something like this? 

I'm struggling with the implementation, but if it's easy, could you share some initial direction? 

Thanks! 
I am trying to animate the FluidView from top (1.0) to bottom (0.0)
On doing so, the FluidView just remains at the top, without any reverse animation.

I tried animating from 1.0 to 0.1, with a fillDuration of 7, but the FluidView just quickly animates to 0.1 in one second.

Here is the code for reference:

```
fluidView = BAFluidView(frame: fluidViewFrame, maxAmplitude: 25, minAmplitude: 20, amplitudeIncrement: 5, startElevation: 1.0)
fluidView.backgroundColor = LIGHTER_GRAY
fluidView.fillAutoReverse = false
fluidView.fillDuration = 7
fluidView.strokeColor = OFF_WHITE
fluidView.fillRepeatCount = 1
fluidView.fillColor = WHITE
fluidView.fill(to: 0.0)
```
