Is there an official .NET wrapper available? Couldn't find one at nuget.org...
Out of curiosity, when are you planning to do the next release on pip?

What git commit will be in that release?
You just merged support for BERT it seems, which is nice; but [XLnet](https://github.com/zihangdai/xlnet) is the new state of the art and has a big momentum, it would be nice to include it.

Just by curiosity, will you use BERT internally for improving BING search results? (if you cannot disclose this information, that's OK!) 
BlingFire seems really interesting, thank you for open sourcing it!!!
But I (and many others) who use NLP tools have high accuracy requirements. 

I think you would attract more users if you published *more* benchmarcks on Nlp tasks BlingFire allow.
That would also help to catch regressions! 

I would particularly be interested in english lemmatization performance.

If you reach state of the art performance on  some tasks, I would be pleased to add them on [NLP-progress](https://github.com/sebastianruder/NLP-progress)

I see that you have a benchmarck wiki but not on enough tasks. 
Btw it would be nice to refresh your benchmarcks, now that you merged BERT. 
I wrote a Rust [wrapper](https://github.com/reinfer/blingfire-rs) for the library -- I was curious if there's any intention to link to "unoffical" wrappers in other languages in the README.

Getting the below error after running pip install blingfire (install works fine). Any ideas?

>>> from blingfire import *

Hey, thanks for a great library!

According to your [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/BlingFire/wiki/How-to-change-linguistic-resources#edit-linguistic-sources-and-compile-them-into-automata), the docs for linguistic resources will be on separate document, is there any plan to add the documentation soon?
Or [this](https://github.com/Microsoft/BlingFire/blob/master/doc/lex.htm) is the actual docs?
[An extra null pointer check is not needed in functions](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/freestore-mgmt#delete-handles-null "Do I need to check for null before delete p?") like the following.
- [FAIwMap_pack](https://github.com/Microsoft/BlingFire/blob/f53296289dffc3b7f2bf4727f76bdceff31f6e76/blingfireclient.library/src/FAIwMap_pack.cpp#L25 "Destructor for FAIwMap_pack")
- [FASummTagScores](https://github.com/Microsoft/BlingFire/blob/f53296289dffc3b7f2bf4727f76bdceff31f6e76/blingfirecompile.library/src/FASummTagScores.cpp#L21 "Destructor for FASummTagScores")

I would like to point out that an identifier like “[`_FA_BRRESULTCA_H_`](https://github.com/Microsoft/BlingFire/blob/82f0e58d8dd9a6d4ab81a7c7a8cae129ba9172ce/blingfireclient.library/inc/FABrResultCA.h#L8 "Update candidate")” [does eventually not fit](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/cplusplus/DCL51-CPP.+Do+not+declare+or+define+a+reserved+identifier "Do not declare an identifier which is reserved for the compiler implementation.") to the expected naming convention of the C++ language standard.
Would you like to adjust your selection for unique names?
