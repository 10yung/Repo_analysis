unable to change cursor pointer position while dragging the item in ng2-dnd

* **What is the expected behavior?**

Ex: I want same behavior on how we can change cusrsor position in **jqyoui-draggable plgin**  
Example _( **data-jqyoui-options="{cursorAt: { left: 10, top: -15 }, containment: 'parent'}"**)_

What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?
Need to change cursor pointer position while dragging item.
Cursor pointer position always should be outside of the cloned dragged item.

Can you please check the below screenshot for reference.
