<p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon/blob/master/RELEASES.md">rayon's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Release rayon 1.3.0 / rayon-core 1.7.0 (2019-12-21)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Tuples up to length 12 now implement <code>IntoParallelIterator</code>, creating a
<code>MultiZip</code> iterator that produces items as similarly-shaped tuples.</li>
<li>The <code>--cfg=rayon_unstable</code> supporting code for <code>rayon-futures</code> is removed.</li>
<li>The minimum supported <code>rustc</code> is now 1.31.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h1>Release rayon-futures 0.1.1 (2019-12-21)</h1>
<ul>
<li><code>Send</code> bounds have been added for the <code>Item</code> and <code>Error</code> associated types on
all generic <code>F: Future</code> interfaces. While technically a breaking change, this
is a soundness fix, so we are not increasing the semantic version for this.</li>
<li>This crate is now deprecated, and the <code>--cfg=rayon_unstable</code> supporting code
will be removed in <code>rayon-core 1.7.0</code>. This only supported the now-obsolete
<code>Future</code> from <code>futures 0.1</code>, while support for <code>std::future::Future</code> is
expected to come directly in <code>rayon-core</code> -- although that is not ready yet.</li>

Cross post from project [ScreenToGif issue 556](https://github.com/NickeManarin/ScreenToGif/issues/556)

---

Screen To Gif: 2.19.3
Encoder: Gifski (not sure what version, build time 2019-1-19)
Platform: Windows 10 1703 x64

---

**Problem**

Gifski generates frames for even static recordings, results in duplicated frames and redundant file size

---

**Demo generated from same project**

Recording by `gifski-quality 100` (frames: 81, file size: 5.91MB)

![gifski-quality 100](https://i.imgur.com/JDBtWTR.gif)

[Gif link if github said it's too large](https://i.imgur.com/JDBtWTR.gif)

`Gifski-quality 100` zoom in. Note the flickering pixels.

![gifski-quality 100-4x](https://i.imgur.com/2wFuuAV.gif)

Recording by `1.0-quality 1` (frames: 19, file size: 1.97MB)

![1.0-quality 1](https://i.imgur.com/j6id38G.gif)

`1.0-quality 1` zoom in. Unchanged pixels stay the same thus it's basically 1 frame with a long timeout

![1.0-quality 1-4x](https://i.imgur.com/w7M2ob9.gif)
Cropping could be useful to reduce gif size, I know that I can achieve this using `ffmpeg` first, but it's more convenient if `gifski` can support this, similar to the resize options.
About this issue :
https://github.com/ImageOptim/gifski/issues/101

I am not a rust expert, but I did that to solve my issue. So I am sharing it with you maybe you'll be interested in it. 

You can give a "*" char after the frame path to multiply the frame delay, it's still optionnal, i.e:
`gifski -o foo.gif --fps 24 --noorder frame_bar.png*10 frame_bar1.png frame_bar2png*2`


Hello, awesome work! 
Is there or are you plan to have a way to define the duration of each frame? 
And avoid giving ten times the same frame to get this one longer. 

Thank you! 
ffmpeg support fps <1, will be nice to have this feature. 
I would love to use this in my editor (written in C++) to export GIFs, but don't want to have Rust as a dependency. Are there any plans to provide a C++ API? Or do you know if anyone else has done this?
allow

```sh
$ gifski images/ --output=movies.gif
```

## Why?

I use gifski to generate simulation. I have 18000 plots to be converted into 15 minutes gif (20 fps). Passing 18000 images as argument (512 kb buffer) is not currently viable on Mac osx.
