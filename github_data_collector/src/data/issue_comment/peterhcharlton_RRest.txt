I am really beginner of respiration algorithm.
Just run RRest with my own ppg data and got .mat result.
( 1_int_respSigs.mat ,  1_respSigs.mat , 1_rrEsts.mat , 1_rrRef.mat , 1_sqi.mat ,1_wins.mat )

I want to draw plots like feature_measurement_for_breathing_rate_estimation script.
In this script, it uses ekg, ppg signal made their own.

If I use the script using data from RRest, how do I change the variable??
Is there any guide or document for using it? or guide about RRest result??

Thanks
I run your algorithm and got result of data set.
Except for the Statistical Analysis part in the document , I couldn't find the meaning of the row in the 'stats_results_table'. Is there any information for that?

 I want to find some explanation of those row :  m_xa | m_xb | m_ef | m_et | m_fm | m_ft 

Thanks



Thanks for sharing the code and datasets! However, I met problems when I tested the code on MIMIC_II dataset and BIDIC dataset:
1. When I ran the RRest v3.0 using MIMIC_II, when it goes to the step "Fusing RRs", I got an error message "Index exceeds matrix dimensions". The error is in  SPA.m (line 111), SPA.m (line 60), fuse_rr.m (line 58), and RRest.m (line 63).
2. When I ran the RRest v3.0 using BIDIC, when it goes to the step "Creating Universal Parameters", I got an error message "Fieldname 'group' does not exist." The error is in  setup_universal_params.m (line 225), when calling the function "extractfield".
I have no idea how these errors caused. Could you please help me solve the problems? Thanks!
The following are the screenshots of the errors:

Great job!
I have two questions:
1. I noticed that the synthetic reference rr data is 4 breaths/minutes, however in practice, the number of the breaths per minute of a healthy adult is much more than that. So, is there any reason you make the reference rr data to be that number?
2. When I tried to download the script for generating the synthetic dataset, I found the provided linke is down. So could you please fix or provide another way to get access to the script?

Thanks! Looking forward to your reply!
Hi, thanks for sharing the code. When I tried to run the synthesis data with RRest_v3 as described in the video, I got the following error:

```
Reference to non-existent field 'young'.

Error in specific_vortal_stats (line 30)
    if sum(rel_subj_els.young == subj_no)
```

As I checked with breakpoint, rel_subj_els indeed doesn't have young field. Could you help me with this?
Great work, I have enjoyed getting to play around with the simulation framework you produced. 
I have two questions:

1) For fm, why do you divide the amplitude by 2?
2) For am, why do you detrend the unmodulated signal? What benefits does that provide?

Thanks

  Thanks sincerely for your contribution,I am a fresher.I am reading some paper in estimating RR and HR,then I meet your project.Now I am facing some difficulties,could you please give me some instructions?
   1.Where can I download Vortal dataset? Must I contact research.data@kcl.ac.uk to obtain data from young subjects both at rest and recovering from intense exercise?
   2.When I use toolbox v.2,must I use 2 dataset(at rest and other),then combine the results of these two analyses ? Can I only use Synthetic dataset to obtain some results rather than using two dataset before?
  Thanks again for your code.
