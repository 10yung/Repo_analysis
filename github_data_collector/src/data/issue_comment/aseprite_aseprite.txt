[An extra null pointer check is not needed in functions](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/freestore-mgmt#delete-handles-null "Do I need to check for null before delete p?") like the following.
- [Extension::DitheringMatrixInfo::destroyMatrix](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/e516d26fa801063fd05516e7576121c1769aaceb/src/app/extensions.cpp#L193 "Extension::DitheringMatrixInfo::destroyMatrix function")
- [Job](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/b015fee8e0b221342f6bb68250b5aec635c6cc1a/src/app/job.cpp#L68 "Destructor for Job")
For example:
- Layer2 above of Layer1,
- Layer2 opacity = 64, draw filled square with a color with alpha=255  (square B).
- Layer1 opacity = 128, draw other filled square with a color with alpha=255 (square A).
- Execute Merge Down command.
Results:
- Wrong result: resultant layer with opacity = 128, square A it's OK, but the square B was affected  by Layer1 opacity, so the square B has a current opacity of 32 (square B looks more transparent after the Merge Down command).
- Expected result: resultant layer with opacity = 255, and unchanged displayed shapes.

Aseprite version: 1.2.16
Right now we have All Layers, Current, and First Reference Layer as options for the eyedropper. However All Layers has the problem of picking mixed colors if there is any opacity, and current layer simply picks nothing if you are on the wrong layer.

I'd like a fourth option that simply picks from the first layer from the top that it encounters, so you can pick from a transparent layer without getting mixed colors (although I'd assume you'd still have to set it to not pick alpha).
When I try to make an HSV color (in my case (0,70,100,255)) the saturation (s) value keeps reverting from 70 to 69. I'm unsure if this is a bug or a feature, but it's kind of annoying when you want to have nice, round numbers. This only happens when the S value is 70.

### Aseprite and System version
Aseprite v1.2.16.3 on Windows

Origin of the issue: https://igarastudio.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/344
Image processing software can save PNG images files with an embedded Color profile.
Then when Aseprite opens the PNG, if the libpng library throws an error, for example "PCS illuminant is not D50", we need to ask to the user how to manage the color profile to save/export the image correctly.

It can be implemented on a float dialog (better option), or docked instead the color wheel.

This is a long standing issue, we should watch the .ini file for changes, and if the file is changed by other instanced reload the preferences from that file (or at least asking for the changes in the other instance).

In some way, after closing Aseprite, we should be able to "merge" the preferences of the running instances with existing .ini (e.g. recent files). Not sure if this can be done with all preferences.

Anyway I guess that just reloading preferences when the .ini file is modified externally should avoid these "merge conflict" or "losing preferences" when we overwrite the file.
When having right-click set to 'Pick foreground color', you can also pick transparency and draw with that. That works fine with the Rectangle tool, the Filled rectangle tool and the Ellipse tool, but not with the Filled ellipse tool. That one only works when drawing with an actual color.

* Aseprite version: 1.2.16.3-x64
* System: Windows 10

Following LUA script should set first palette color to transparent red (alpha=128) but instead color in palette is fully opaque. Tested with other colors and indexes and it seems that **setColor** function ignores alpha component.

    local spr = app.activeSprite
    if not spr then return app.alert("There is no active sprite.") end

    app.transaction(
	function()
		local palette = spr.palettes[1]
		palette:setColor(0, Color{h = 0, s = 1, v = 1, a = 128})
	end
    )

    app.refresh()

### Aseprite and System version

* Aseprite version: v1.2.16.3-x64, installed from Humble bundle distribution
* System: Windows 10, 64 bit

I followed step by step the installation instructions under the title `Skia on macOS`, however I got an error. This is the output I get after `python tools/git-sync-deps`:
