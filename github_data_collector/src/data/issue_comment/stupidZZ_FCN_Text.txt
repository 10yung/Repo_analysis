The ground truth images generated are containing extra white spaces than the original images.How am I supposed to remove them and train?
Cour your please tell me why we need the resPath = argv[2] ?
What is expected to be feeded into the program? For ImgPath I am giving the program the image file but for res file? What kind of path am I expected to give here? Please help. Can I run your algorithm with the getMser.y or do I need the HED for the python version?

I have written a simple python script, and it can load the model.
How can I get the result? 
print 'The result of forward:'                                                                                                         
sigmoid = net.blobs['sigmoid-fuse'].data[0]                                                                                           
or
upscore = net.blobs['upscore-fuse'].data[0]
In caffe version of TextRegionFCN, which one is the test program that can generate images with bounding boxes?solver.py?
Where can I download  the vgg_weights.t7 file?

Hi stupidZZ:
    I used the caffe version, when I runed python solver.py, it got errors like these:
I0414 16:11:37.903455  8245 layer_factory.hpp:77] Creating layer data

how can I solved it?
Hi stupidZZ,

Can I execute this program on Windows 7 with MatLab 2016b version?
