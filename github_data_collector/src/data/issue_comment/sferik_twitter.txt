Updates http from v3.0 to v4.0
The `http` (httprb) gem is [up to a 4.2.0 release. 4.0.0 was released in Oct 2018](https://rubygems.org/gems/http/versions). In fact, a 5.0.0pre release is out. 

However, this gem's [gemspec restricts](https://github.com/sferik/twitter/blob/844818cad07ce490ccb9d8542ebb6b4fc7a61cb4/twitter.gemspec#L9) to `http` 3.x. 

That means any project that depends on this gem can only use http 3.x, not the newer http 4.x or upcoming 5.x. 

Could the twitter gem be updated to use/allow more recent `http` releases?

Is this `twitter` gem currently maintained? Thanks! 
Hey
**Problem**: Need to get 1000+ followers names.,

I've implemented getting followers list using your gem, but looks like I can get only 300 followers in one go. I understand that, Twitter has 15 request per 15 mins and each request will give me 20 followers at a time. I've few users who have more than 1000 followers, how do I get the names of the followers?

Currently, I'm using following code, 


```
twitter_response = TwitterAPI.new

followers = twitter_response.client(current_user).followers

followers.each do |follower|

     f = Follower.create(name: follower.name, user_id: follower.id)

end
```


Now after making 20 request , I encounter `Twitter::Error::TooManyRequests: Rate limit exceeded` error. I read it online, that I can use `followers.attrs[:next_cursor]` to get data offline. Can you please share an example to do that using this gem?

Or if there is a better way to solve the issue, I'm all ears.
Any interest in adding the ability to log request/response data? This would come in handy for tracking request responses and/or debugging.
Resolves https://github.com/sferik/twitter/issues/960
`Twitter::Client#blank?` conflicts with the usage of rails `#blank?` and `#present?`.

It should be renamed to something else that's ambiguous and not used in rails.
`Twitter::NullObject#presence` keeps returning a `Twitter::NullObject` instead of `nil` as expected.
We can currently find out if tweets are replies to another tweet by checking if `Tweet#in_reply_to_tweet_id` are `Twitter::NullObject`. It would be awesome if we could get the tweets in a threaded format.
