Chip: ATSAMD21
The same chip is on MKR VIDOR 4000, MKR WiFi 1010, ...

With no debugging enabled, DBG_PRINT() and DBG_PRINTLN() are just
empty and in code like this:

	if (foo)
		DBG_PRINT();
	else
		DBG_PRINT();

it will result in

	if (foo)
		/* nothing */;
	else
		/* nothing */;

Macros that are used in a function-alike way should always result in
something that looks like exactly one single statement.

Hello,

I wrote remote control (receiver)  sketch on arduino UNO all works fine, then decided to move whole thing on just an atmega 328p processor using his internal clock , on 8MHz nothing works, on 1MHz few buttons are recognized.
My question is does processor frequency affect stability of irreceiver? If yes, I can use an external escilator, what frequency is  considered stable?
Hi all,
I use STM8S003F3P6 adruino core ( sduino library).  I use IRremote library but have problem about interrupt. The compiler Adruino IDE inform no such file <avr/interrupt.h>. I know to use IRremote libray need to modify a little bit but my knowlegde about this MCU not enough. Anyone can support me?
**Board:** SparkFun Pro Micro 5
**Library Version:** 2.2.3
**Protocol:** Any

**Code Block:**
```c

#include <IRremote.h>

IRsend irsend;

void setup()
{
}

void loop() {
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		irsend.sendSony(0xa90, 12);
                Serial.println(i);
		delay(40);
	}
	delay(5000); //5 second delay between each signal burst
}

```

I have followed some of the recommendations when using the Spark Fun Pro Micro (5v/16Hz) board. Including..
- Updated to use timer3
- Updated to use pin 5 for output

What I observe when running above code, the onboard Tx LED blinks 3 times (likely during the Serial output) and then repeats every 5 seconds. The IR LED stays in an "on" state (verified by using cellphone camera).



**Board:** ARDUINO UNO
**Library Version:** 2.1.0
**Protocol:** Sony (if any)

**Code Block:**
```c

#include <IRremote.h>

Just tested this library with a Nano 33 IoT board, it works like a charm!

Can you please add details (ex. PIN) in the README?
A really small pull request because I noticed useless spaces before ':'

Hello!

I'm trying to turn on the Carbon Heater with IRremote.
When I try to turn on the SamSung TV or LG Air purifier, it's working,
whlie the heater don't.

This is the Air purifier's result
**Code Block:**

unsigned int  rawData[67] = {8850,4350, 600,1600, 550,550, 550,550, 550,550, 550,550, 550,550, 550,550, 550,1650, 500,1650, 550,1650, 550,1650, 550,550, 550,550, 550,550, 550,1650, 550,550, 500,1700, 500,550, 550,550, 550,550, 550,550, 550,550, 550,550, 550,1650, 550,550, 550,1650, 550,1650, 500,1650, 600,1600, 550,1650, 550,1650, 550,550, 550};  // NEC 81E2817E
unsigned int  data = 0x81E2817E;
```
In this case, both sendNEC or sendRaw  code is working .

And this is the Heater's result.

**Code Block:**
```c

     +1300, - 400     + 450, -1200     + 450, -1250     + 400, -1250
     + 450, -1200     + 450, -1250     + 450, -1200     +1300
unsigned int  rawData[23] = {1300,350, 1300,400, 450,1200, 1300,350, 1300,400, 450,1200, 450,1250, 400,1250, 450,1200, 450,1250, 450,1200, 1300};  // UNKNOWN A32AB931
```
When I use sendRaw code, it's not working. 

I try so many times, various distance between the heater and the Aduino UNO. 
I want to know what the problem is.

Lastly, I write the code ,sendRawDemo, I used.

Thanks.
**Code Block:**
```c

#include <IRremote.h> 

IRsend irsend;

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  
}
void loop() {
int khz = 38;// 38kHz carrier frequency for the NEC protocol
unsigned int On[] ={1250,400, 1250,400, 450,1250, 1250,400, 1250,400, 450,1250, 400,1250, 450,1200, 450,1250, 400,1250, 450,1200, 1300};  // Power 
 irsend.sendRaw(On,sizeof(On)/sizeof(int),khz);
delay(1000);
}

```





Hey,

So I've been playing around with this library and visual studio and I've created an app so that I can control my home lights, that have an infrared remote, over the internet. It's quite basic, but currently the app receives the command to turn the lights on and then sends a command to the arduino over the serial port, and then there are a lot of if statements to check what code the app has sent, and then I use IRsend.sendNEC("0xFFF40A", 32) and change the hex code for the different hex statements. I was thinking I could send just the hex code from the app, over the serial port and then use something like;

string code == Serial.readString()
IRsend.sendNEC(code, 32) 

but when compiling, it says that IRsend can't use strings. I'm just wondering if there is a way around this, as I've managed to make the app side use a config file so I can set it up for different lights, but with the arduino side being basically hard coded. If I change my lights and they use a different remote, then I'll need to recode the arduino. Or if there isn't a way currently to get around this, would there be a possibility of adding in that functionality. With the if statements the arduino code is quite long, but if I'm able to use a string, I can achieve the same functionality with about 5 lines of code.
