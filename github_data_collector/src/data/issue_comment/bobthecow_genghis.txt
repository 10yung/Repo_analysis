Mongoku is a new, more modern and currently maintained Web-based client for Mongo, inspired by Genghis: 
https://github.com/huggingface/Mongoku

It's built on Node.js (using Typescript) and Angular.
I have tried all permutations of more recent versions of gems : mongo, bson, bson_ext.
The latest gem versions that will actually load genghisapp in the browser are
mongo 1.12.3
bson 1.12.3
bson_ext 1.9.2  (there is no 1.12.3, and 1.12.5 doesnt work)

With above config (as well as all 3 on 1.9.2) the genghis app loads in the browser, but shows "0" for collections of all databases. 
How to fix?
thanks

Hello,

The extension using by Genghis currently is not avalaible on php7

For example, the MongoClient is deprecated and replace by MongoDB\Driver

Is possible to add the compatibility in the future?
I don't know exactly what it does. But when the data are displayed in the browser, the page take *a lot* of memory. Like, it easily grow to several GB in firefox for less than 10 MB of data.

There's probably something that can be done about this.
Is there some javascript involved? Maybe the HTML can be simplified. Maybe sub-documents could be formatted or downloaded only on-demand. Or maybe past a given data volume threshold, genghis could switch to just building a string without HTML formatting.

What do you think?
Hi.

When I add my server I get the following error:

"Failed to connect to: [my server]: Authentication failed on database with username 'admin': auth failed."

I have tried using direct input and adding GENGHIS_SERVERS env constant to .htaccess, but with no better luck.

These are the versions I'm using:
Genghis v2.3.11
PHP 5.5.9
PECL Mongo 1.4.5
MongoDB 3.2.9 hosted by mlab.com

Thanks a lot.

Hi
I have tried pushing the app and it gave an error like. And while trailing the logs it is saying mongo class not found in home/vcap/app/htdocs/genghis.php. but i am not getting this path.

I haven't been able to find anything about this here, sorry if it's been asked before.

Any there any plans to support the new [PHP Mongo driver](http://php.net/manual/en/set.mongodb.php) in the PHP version of Genghis?

Thanks!

Greetings,
I see Genghis shows ID by the time they are created not by the ID number
Assume We have 3 collections:
{ "_id": 1, "user": "a" } //Created on 1st jan
{ "_id": 5, "user": "c" } //Created on 2nd jan
{ "_id": 2, "user": "b" } //Created on 3rd jan

Why doesn't genghis arrange them according to their IDs and not by the time/date it was created.

Any help?

Thanks!
