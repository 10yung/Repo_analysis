Hi, it would be helpful if matlabstan's stan function had 'pars' input similar to rstan's stan function. In some of my models, matlabstan saves many (many!) additional parameters that I don't particularly care about :) Being able to specify the parameters of interest to be saved would greatly reduce overhead and the size of my stan files. Thanks!
The location of the add-on `xUnit` is not found at the location described in these TestCases, it has been moved to GitHub.
Hi everyone, 
I am using matlabstan, in particular the mcmc sampling method with hamiltonian or nuts.
I noticed in stan code there is an implementation of metrics not specified in matlabstan, like Riemannian manifold with SoftAbs metric, Euclidean manifold with dense metric and so on...
How is it possible to call these engine solvers? 
In my opinion it is a thing of correctly using matlabstan process manager to specify right command to cmdstan, but actually I don't know how to exactly do the all process.
Does someone have an idea about?

Thanks 
Hi 
I am new to using MatlabStan. I am trying the eight_school example following  https://github.com/brian-lau/MatlabStan/wiki/Getting-Started 

But getting the following error: 
             Error using StanModel/set.stan_home (line 314)
              Does not look like a proper stan setup

          Error in StanModel (line 185)
         self.stan_home = p.Results.stan_home;

          Error in stan (line 108)
        model = StanModel();

 Please help me to fix this error. 
Thanks 

Hi,

I noticed that in StanFit.m, the nansum function is used on lines 272 and 366. nansum is a function in the Statistics toolbox and in the finance toolbox. 

nansum can be replaced with sum(x,'omitnan'), which would circumvent the user needing the two abovementioned toolboxes and serves the same purpose as nansum. I can't find any other functions that require the toolboxes in the MatlabStan scripts. 

I know most people probably have one of these toolboxes, but it might make life easier on a few.

Hope it helps :)

Stan program runs without any issues. I can see the results, do plots with them etc. Matlab crashes if I try to save the structural matrix created by Stan. I'm wondering if anyone else has a similar problem or solution. Thanks
Hi Brian,

Thanks for the amazing code. MatlabStan has been absolutely wonderful to use.

I discovered (and solved) a very minor bug. I deal with fairly large data sets. If my number of observations exceeds number of chains x number of samples, then the fit.extract method fails.

I tracked down the issue, and it is an easy fix. in mcmc.m you set a size variable (sz) as:

               sz = size(temp);

you then use this in the subsequent line:

                temp = temp(self.permute_index(1:max(sz)),:);

But, when nobservations>nchains*nsamples, this crashes since max(sz) no longer applies to the proper index.

The trivially easy fix is to replace max(sz) with sz(1).

              temp = temp(self.permute_index(1:sz(1)),:);

Probably very few people run into this bug. However, if/when you release an update, it is an easy change to make.

Hi,

I have installed all the required tools for the MatlabStan and I could execute some examples from the wiki. However, I could not execute the real problem I had in mind. I really do not know what the problem is since no error is shown. But I get the windows error "stansummary.exe has stopped working". There are some warnings in the command prompt of Matlab as well. I attached an screenshot of the error along with the model I want to execute.

 Any help would be appreciated. 

Best,
Majid

MatlabStan makes use of the function nansum in StanFit.m, which isnâ€™t included in Matlab (anymore?).  This is easily solved by writing your own nansum function.

* [ ] write the necessary nansum function
Is it possible to use the .exe file resulting from compilation in MatlabStan? The help page on avoiding recompilation of Stan models refers to reusing a StanFit object. But suppose you forgot to save the fit, it seems like one ought be able to use the .exe.

Thanks,
