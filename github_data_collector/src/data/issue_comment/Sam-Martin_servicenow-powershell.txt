Hello,

I was trying to use your module and it seems I fail to authenticate with credentials via ADFS. Is it coded in because it's unclear?
And -Debug switches do not get much out.

It is even more complicated in my case because the company I work for offers only complicated options in the ADFS. That is PKI, SMS or OTP.

If I access https://instance.service-now/api/now/v1 it doesn't prompt for credentials anymore.
Hence, using Test-ServiceNowAuthIsSet and Set-ServiceNowAuth will show the authentication as True instead of False.

Is it just me?
Thanks team on working on my last request (Create change request), I must be more demanding, if possible can you please create same for change tasks as well
There was a submission for #98 to add `New-ServiceNowRequest` to the module.  This seemed straight forward enough and I pushed it to dev, but after looking through it I'm not sure that addition does what's expected.  In my environment a REQ means RITMs which means workflows.  My developers tell me that's what they expect from those tickets as well.  Are people utilizing REQ tickets in another way?  Please share some user stories on how your environment uses REQs so I can ensure the command is useful.
When I call Get-ServiceNowTable and specify -Query with the set of column names the columns do not return in the order I specified.  So I have to then do a Select to get them in the order I want.  Is this a limitation of the API itself?

Get-ServiceNowTable -Table $snowTableName -Limit 10000 -Properties $cols | select $cols | Export-Csv -Path $csvFileName 

Thanks, Bruce...
First, thanks for putting this together as it has been immensely helpful.

When calling Get-ServiceNowTable I want to get all records in the table so am using -Limit with a high number.  But when I do that I get a warning about it being deprecated and to use -First instead, however that parameter is not yet available.  Has it just not yet been implemented?

Thanks, Bruce...


Hi ,

i just want to query the Status i see an already open "fork" #7 for my Question but it was never commited since ~ 1 year.
Any Chance this feature will be inserted ?
I have to provide a Proxy with credentials or at least Parameter DefaultCredentials to Invoke-RestMethod.

Cheers

Hello, I have been able to change every field in service now that I need, other then the "assigned to" field. I am passing this hash table to the command `Update-ServiceNowIncident`

`$assigned = @{        
    assigned_to                                = "$assignedTo"     
}`
where the $assignedTo variable contains a valid email address in our environment.

This is the command I am using, similar to updating the assignment group or impacted user field.

` Update-ServiceNowIncident -SysId $sysid -Values $assigned  -ServiceNowCredential $global:serviceNowCredentials -ServiceNowURL $global:url`

Any thoughts on what I could be doing wrong?

Thanks!
Hello, is there an existing way to grab the sys_id for an already existing ticket/incident number in service now? What I am trying to do is update an incident which wasn't created by the service now module, but I can't find a way to grab the sys_id without actually creating a ticket using your module.
