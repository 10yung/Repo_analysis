Hi Team, 

I have installed Myrtille on my windows 10 machine, then connect by my browser. Can you please provide solution to prevent/disable CTRL + [W] to close the window. I want to just clear the word using ctrl+w shortcut.

Thanks in Adavnce
One of our client having this error every time he wants to log in. At the same time, there are around 20user that are connected to the server and connected and working without any issue, which makes me believe this is some issue on the client's side.
Any tips on what it can be, what we can check to troubleshoot and fix it for that user?

Does Myrtille support IME keyboards for input?  Specifically, for languages that need double-byte chars when typing a character(s), e.g. Korean, Japanese or Chinese.  The keyboard issues I've seen in the issues list relate to the non-IME keyboard input. I haven't seen anything for IME. short of forking the code and making changes, I would like to see if there is already built-in support in the current released version.
Hi Cedrozor,
I come back to you about autoscaling at begining of the session because I meet some strange behaviours I can't explain.  As said in #141, Websocket are now correctly installed but it happens that sessions do not start autoscaling when starting.  My quesion is : have I correctly put the autoscaling code in the network.js ?

In fact my URL command line has size parameters defined to **&width=900&height=900**
900x900 is the place taken by the software running under the rdp session, so autoscaling will allow the visitor to view the rdp session in full screen mode on a tablet or smartphone.
But quite often, the session start with no scaling enabled whatever the device or the browser used.  I have to clic once on the scale button in the menu bar to activate scaling.
Easy to do on a PC, Mc or Ubuntu machine with mouse, but not on touch device.
Is it possible to defined the user size (**&width=900&height=900**) at the early beginning of the connection because I think there is sometimes a problem with the IF statement on line 339 (**_if (!config.getScaleDisplay())_**), perhaps at the wrong place ?/51087273-7e48c980-1751-11e9-83c3-1a0174e2db57.png)
