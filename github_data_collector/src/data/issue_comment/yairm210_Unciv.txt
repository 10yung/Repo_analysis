**Describe the bug**
The building queue may contain not only the buildings and units, but empty items. They must not be there.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Disable the "Auto-assign city production" option.
2. Finish any building in the city
3. Open the city screen and add any bulding (e.g. Archer) to the queue by "Add to queue" button.
**Achieved result**
4. The item is added to the queue, not to the current construction. (see the screenshot 1)
If you try to move it onto the current construction position, the place in the queue will be occupied by empty record (see the screenshot 2).

**Expected behavior**
If the current construction is empty, the item must be added as a current construction, not to the queue.

> Don't let spawned barbarian camps and units attack in the very same turn. There is no counter attack for this. They suddenly spawn, they spawn units too, and they kill your units immediately.

As in civ5, in the game configuration panel you can add several ai as allies. This at least  Give some challenge to the current AI capability. 1 vs N diety plz. 

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The default java implementation on Archlinux is `java-13-openjdk`, it would be nice if it was supported.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like the game to run with openjdk 13.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I installed openjdk 8, but Unciv is the only program that requires it on my computer.

**Additional context**
Current error:
```
$ java -jar Unciv.jar

I have just tried. Legalism does provide monument or temple if they were the cheapest available culture building but for museum or broadcast tower, the in game mechanics seemingly doesnâ€™t recognize these two as the cheapest available culture building which I guess they should count one or I am wrong?
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Sometimes, it is a bit unclear which improvement will bring the most value, for instance when picking from mine or lumber mill.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
In the build menu, display icons next to the improvements to clarify what resources they bring: +1 production, +1 gold for one, +1 food for the other, -1 gold for build route, etc.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Well, until now, I was looking for information in the civilopedia, but I have to infer that information from the tile type. Having the bonuses determined automatically would be a plus

**Additional context**
I didn't find a cheat or console menu to spawn units/unlock tech trees in a new game, but here is a screenshot I took after a few turns:
![screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3952726/72618247-fc2e4a80-393a-11ea-9830-96dd0b3af0b0.png)
Here, the farm should show +1 food, and the pasture +1 production.
It could be interesting to show later improvements (depending on tech/buildings) and effects of citizens, but that could clutter the interface a bit. Maybe write it in the details at the bottom?
