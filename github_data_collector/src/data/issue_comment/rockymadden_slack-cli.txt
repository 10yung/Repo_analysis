I'm trying to pipe a url to a channel and it always ends up formatted with backticks.

For example:
```
echo "http://github.com" | slack chat send -ch @mark 
```

I receive the message but it looks like this:
<img width="698" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/917632/64351085-b5f9cf80-cfc7-11e9-9095-882a6a09ba0f.png">

Is there a way to format piped output?
Apologies if I am missing the obvious, but I am wondering if there is a way to obtain the number of unread messages in a given channel.

Many thanks

As an addition to the `reminder` functionality there is now a way to output both `reminder list` and `reminder info` in human readable form.

This outputs something along the lines of this:

```console
➜ reminder list --human
♲ My recurring reminder (id: Rm66APGDDV)
♲ Do something when event happens (id: Rm39APGEDF)
♲ Check in with Paul (id: Rm83APGSDR)
✓ I completed something (id: RmJELLGW9J)
✗ This shows a non completed reminder (id: Rm74BJGEKD)
```

• Added `--human` flag to show human readable info about reminders. If flag is not set we default to showing JSON data
• Added docs for --human flag
When I try to run `slack init` with my slack bot token I get the following output:
`
/usr/local/bin/slack: line 522: /usr/local/etc/slack-cli/.slack: No such file or directory
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "not_writable"
}
`

### Proposed changes
- use `text` field for `chatsend` when there is only `$text`
Thanks for the great utility! 

This PR adds support for searching for a user id by their email. Not sure what you want to do about the new integration test but I figured I'd stick in your public github email in it for now. 

I'm seeing a bunch of failures on `make test` even w/o my changes, so I assume there must be extra environment needed to run them cleanly. Please let me know if that's not true! 
fix #104
Please allow send message as slack app bot account.
We need `as_user=false` when use bot token.
Fixes #79
