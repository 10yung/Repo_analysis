Hello, I need to change the coordinate system from PTK coordinates to DICOM coordinates (based on tutorial 2), but i can't do it. Is anyone able to help me? Thanks thanks,
Monica 
I used PTK to load up a scan recently. Its compressed Dicom images of ARDS patient.
It loads fine on ITK-snap and 3D slicer.
But PTK zooms it when imported and seems to crop out the image. Is there any setting i should change. Thanks.
I am getting the following error while segmenting lung field or lobel using the toolkit
The plugin PTKlobes failed with the following error:
Subscript indices must either be real positive integers or logicals.
When using the capture tool to create a screenshot, the vertical capture is misaligned if using macOS full screen mode
The UI will round the window and level values entered in the text boxes to the nearest integer.
For most Dicom images this is the preferred behaviour; however when dealing with images of floating point values it might be desirable to set a non-integrer value.

May require changes to: 
- `MimPluginLabelEditBox`
- `MimPluginLabelSlider`
- `MimViewerPanelToolbar`
- `MimViewerPanelCallback:ModifyWindowLevelLimits`
and consideration of how the window/level values affect other parts of the codebase
>> PTKAddPaths;
>> ptk_main = PTKMain;
Error: File: PTKMain.m Line: 62 Column: 5
Function definitions in a script must appear at the end of the file.
Move all statements after the "PTKMain" function definition to before the first local function
definition.
How could I change the coordinate system from PTK coordinates to DICOM coordinates (based on your tutorial 2? Could I change it from the GUI?
Hi,
When I try to use the function, PTKSaveAs, to save the data, it always shows that Undefined function or variable 'PTKSaveAs'. Even when I try to do doc PTKSaveAs, it always shows that No results for PTKSaveAs. Is there any way to save the data into mhd file or nii file without using GUI.
when i write ' file_infos = PTKDicomUtilities.GetListOfDicomFiles(source_path);', it says 'Undefined variable "PTKDicomUtilities" or class PTKDicomUtilities.GetListOfDicomFiles". i defined file path in source_path. please help
Hi, tomdeol.
       Thanks for your great work! 
       When I use the "Segment the segments" in toolkit. Two errors when I deal with different dicom sequences.
1. The plugin PTKPulmonarySegments failed with the following error: Error in function SeparateSmallestBranchByRadius: Could not subdivide the tree into exactly the desired number of branches.
2. The plugin PTKPulmonarySegments failed with the following error: Attempt to access sample_image(16,18,29)；As size(sample_image)=[2,2,2], is out of range。
Thanks
Gu Yu.
