<h2>v4.1.1</h2>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Patch some backward-incompatible changes to <code>validate_presence_of</code> that were
made in the last version. As of 4.1.0 the presence matcher now checks to
ensure that empty string will cause the record to be invalid (in addition to
nil, which it was already checking against). However, this check was being
performed even if the attribute or column the presence matcher is being run
against didn't support being set to an empty string. This releases fixes this.

<h1>New Relic Ruby Agent Release Notes</h1>
<h2>v6.8.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial Ruby 2.7 support</strong></p>
<p>The Ruby agent has been verified to run with Ruby 2.7.0-preview1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New API method to add custom attributes to Spans</strong></p>
<p>New API method for adding custom attributes to spans.  Previously, custom
attributes were only available at the Transaction level.  Now, with Span
level custom attributes, more granular tagging of events is possible for
easier isolation and review of trace events.  For more information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rubydoc.info/github/newrelic/rpm/NewRelic/Agent#add_custom_span_attributes"><code>Agent#add_custom_span_attributes</code></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enables ability to migrate to Configurable Security Policies (CSP) on a per agent
basis for accounts already using High Security Mode (HSM).</strong></p>
<p>When both <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/high-security-mode">HSM</a> and <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/enable-configurable-security-policies">CSP</a> are enabled for an account, an agent (this version or later)
can successfully connect with either <code>high_security: true</code> or the appropriate
<code>security_policies_token</code> configured. <code>high_security</code> has been added as part of
the preconnect payload.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bugfix for Logs in Context combined with act-fluent-logger-rails</strong></p>
<p>Previously, when using the Ruby agent's Logs in Context logger
to link logging data with trace and entity metadata for an
improved experience in the UI, customers who were also using
the <code>act-fluent-logger-rails</code> gem would see a <code>NoMethodError</code>
for <code>clear_tags!</code> that would interfere with the use of this
feature. This error no longer appears, allowing customers to
combine the use of Logs in Context with the use of this gem.</p>
<p>Please note that the Logs in Context logger does not support
tagged logging; if you are initializing your logger with a
<code>log_tags</code> argument, your custom tags may not appear on the
final version of your logs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bugfix for parsing invalid newrelic.yml</strong></p>
<p>Previously, if the newrelic.yml configuration file was invalid, and the agent
could not start as a result, the agent would not log any indication of
the problem.</p>
<p>This version of the agent will emit a FATAL message to STDOUT when this scenario
occurs so that customers can address issues with newrelic.yml that prevent startup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configuration options containing the terms &quot;whitelist&quot; and &quot;blacklist&quot; deprecated</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Low severity vulnerability that affects rack</strong>
There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in Rack. Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using timing attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored and indexed in a database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up lookups of that session id. By carefully measuring the amount of time it takes to look up a session, an attacker may be able to find a valid session id and hijack the session.</p>
<p>The session id itself may be generated randomly, but the way the session is indexed by the backing store does not use a secure comparison.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The session id stored in a cookie is the same id that is used when querying the backing session storage engine.  Most storage mechanisms (for example a database) use some sort of indexing in order to speed up the lookup of that id.  By carefully timing requests and session lookup failures, an attacker may be able to perform a timing attack to determine an existing session id and hijack that session.</p>
<h2>Releases</h2>
<p>The 1.6.12 and 2.0.8 releases are available at the normal locations.</p>
<h3>Workarounds</h3>
<p>There are no known workarounds.</p>
