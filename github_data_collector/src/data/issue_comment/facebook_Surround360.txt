                                    imageL, flowRtoL, shiftFromL);
Anyone ever got this error message "Isochronous transfer has not been started"?
when I ran "python run_all.py",error "AttributeError: type object 'Bitmap' has no attribute 'FromBufferRGBA'' comes out.
someone can solve it?
similar problem in #253. but no answers.
the whole erroe is

Hi, Please accept this pull request.

Thank you!
Hi,

I have already fixed the problem on folly && double-conversion #263 
But then I got another error **undefined reference to `cplus_demangle_v3_callback'**
I have rebuilt folly several times but nothing changes. Is there any way to fix this problem?

Thanks for your help!
Could you give the reference papers about the project? For example, the optical flow method.
What I have done: 
(1) Successfully compile and run surround360_render. Step 2 and step 3 with Sample Data "Palace of Fine Arts Take 1" work successfully. 
(2) Successfully compile surround360_camera_ctl_ui. 
(3) All hardware and wire were assembled. The Ubuntu 16.04 system can recognize the RAID. But the Flycap software can not recognize the cameras. 

What goes wrong: 
(1) 17 cameras were recognized by Flycap when the fist time assembling the Fiber Box. But now they never appear. 
(2) Flycap can recognize the camera when connected to the computer directly through usb. But after several minutes doing nothing, they disconnect. 
(3) At the moment when Flycap shows a camera connect to the computer, run ./CameraControlUI. An error happens. Picture bellow shows the error and the gdb error stack log.

If i have only 3 cameras to cover  only  120  degreesï¼Œ  how can i use geometric calibration to produce a final, accurate cameras_rig.json for these 3 cameras ? the same way as 17 cameras ?
I understand that this will not be stereoscopic. 

Sorry for the probably silly question.

Hi, Can someone give me a reference for the color calibration algorithm used here? Any research paper or links would be helpful. Thanks!
