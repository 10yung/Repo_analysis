Still not sure if we want it in the mainline, evaluation for now.
On hold until https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit/pull/707 is merged and released.

ASF currently does itself, ASF-ui, ASF-WebConfigGenerator and wiki on each commit.

Prereqs:

- [x] https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ASF-ui/issues/149
