--smart/-S has been removed.  Use +smart or -smart extension instead.
For example: pandoc -f markdown+smart -t markdown-smart.
--normalize has been removed.  Normalization is now automatic.
Try pandoc --help for more information.

Recent pandoc has removed or changed certain arguments, and will fail with the current manner in which pandoc is invoked. Which then causes a panic in libcore/result.rs, and fail.

Fixup the arguments so it works with (at least) pandoc 2.0.6, as shipped by Fedora 28.

This will presumably break with the earlier versions of pandoc.
Hi, thanks a lot for your work on that.

Unfortunately it seems severely outdated as of now; would it be possible to support [2018 edition of the book](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/tree/master/2018-edition)?

Thanks again.
In order to work with latest rustonomicon sources and trpl 2nd edition, I altered some things in the project. Some changes are cosmetic others are necessary (like working with a newer pandoc version).

Dockerized the application for easy access and execution.
I am trying to build the second edition of the book. I have copied over the source files from `trpl/second-edition/src` in the TRPL source code repository on Github.

However, when I try to build the book, I encounter the following error:
```

```

I also tried with:
```

Reading book.thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Error { repr: Os { code: 2, message: "No such file or directory" } }', libcore/resul

```
and I get the same error.

Did anybody else try to do the same?
It would be awesome to have this automatically run every so often, and it should be pretty easy to set this up with a CI tools (and since it's open source, it should be free, no?).
I updated the sources. I see no obvious errors. Could you put them on your website?
...

When reading the book on a Kobo Aura One, monospace fonts are displayed like regular fonts, therefore the code looks unaligned. The checkmarks that should display on the tables in the first chapters do not show up.

I managed to fix the first problem by editing the ePub file using calibre, changing the font from “monospace” to “DejaVu Sans Mono” and embedding the font using the font management tool. Also, I removed the size restriction on the CSS file that stated that the “pre” element needed to have fonts that were 0.6 em. Perhaps these fixes can be integrated into the book sources somewhat.

Hello,

First of all, thank you for your fantastic work. It's incredibly valuable to have the 'The Rust Programming Language' e-book in one file.

My suggestion is to put the NOMICON links at the bottom of your page, and the TRPL links at the top of your page. Frankly, 'The Rustonomicon' e-book is not as useful, and even if it is, your page is called 'trpl-ebook', so one would expect to see TRPL first. Every time I visit your page, I mis-click because of that.
