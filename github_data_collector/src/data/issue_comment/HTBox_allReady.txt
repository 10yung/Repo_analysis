This PR is trying to improve the documentations for _developers_ on where to start before contributing to the project. There are some very good instructions on how to launch and build the projects, however, in my opinion it's buried quite deeply and its location is not so obvious for a first-time contributor, it took me some time to eventually find the detailed steps on how to start and launch the project. So I have added a few paragraphs in the `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` to guide new contributors on where to start with. 

In addition, I have added a section on trouble shooting a possible cause of a failed web package dependency build, where the dependency packages are not automatically installed when launching `Visual Studio`. I have also attached a screen shot of where to look to fix the issue. 

Please let me know if I need to make further updates on the wordings or instructions. 
Implemented C#/Core 2.1/XUnit/Selenium

Related to #2345, #2190


This build is an aggregate of changes
- update of _gulpfile.js_ to support _Gulp 4_ thus _Node 10_
- complete upgrade of _AllReady.Integration_ to _Canopy2_ and _Core 2.1_ 
- associated changes to _appveyor.yml_

Further comments in #2343
Encountered this while working on #2345.  

The **Admin/Event/Create** page shows

I got everything to build after fixing #2344 and #2345 but the website did not render correctly.

There were no build errors.  Finally spotted

.net framework 4.6.1 is the last default version of the framework installed with **Visual Studio Community 2017 15.9.7**.  **AllReady.ScenarioTest** is looking for 4.6.2.

Unless there is a very specific reason for using 4.6.2, I would suggest returning to 4.6.1.
Opening  **AllReadyWebOnly.sln** from a fresh clone in VS2017 will produce warnings in **Error List** window.

It's been a while since I've worked on this project and I wanted to get back into it.  I started with a fresh development system with only **git version 2.20.1.windows.1** and **Visual Studio Community 2017 15.9.7** installed.  I wanted to approach it as if I was a newbie.  

I've encountered a series of problems with a clean build.  I'm going to use this issue as a way of tracking the individual problems found.

- Issue #2344
- Issue #2345 
- Issue #2346
