After upgrade to Catalina Hosts.prefpane closes and generated this error message:

> Error en las preferencias
> Se ha producido un error en el panel de preferencias Hosts.

Thanks a lot for your great app.

Kind regards.
When I tried to do a fresh install, macOS warned me that 'Developer ID installer: PermanentMarkers' certificate is expired.
Would like to know how I uninstall Hosts.prefpane because it does not work on my system (Mojave).
Hey,

Really love this preference pane. Use it all the time. Are you planning on updating it for compatibility with Mojave?  There is a layout issue with the column headers, and dark mode would be cool too! :-)
When I add one character hostname like "a" or "f", this application alert `Please enter a valid hostname`.
But when hostname is "g", it is not alerted.

"aaaa" is bad, "aaaaa" is good.
"aaaf" is bad, "aaag" is good.

It strange to me.
I tried installing this (version 1.3) and I got stuck on this screen with a spinning beachball (this was after I clicked "Install" but before it asks to enter my credentials):

I was on that screen for 5-10 minutes before I restarted (had to force quit the installer). I then ran the installer again before I started any other programs and it worked fine. I'm on Yosemite 10.10.3:

Thanks for a great tool! 
I would love to be able to add comments for one or several lines to specify what function the addresses have.

Cheers!

Apparently something more then dropping a file in /Library/PreferencePanes must be done in mountain lion to install a prefpane.

In the prefpane, it would be nice to have a button to flush the DNS cache
