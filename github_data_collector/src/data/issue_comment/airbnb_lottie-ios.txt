I would like to contribute my grain of sand to the overall performance improvement project.


This PR updates the README file to mention the last version of Lottie that supports Objective-C to help users with older projects or users starting new Objective-C projects that wish to import Lottie.
### I add lottie in my project by cocoapods, but why it still ask me to add Lottie.framework? can u help me ? thanks!  Simulator is OK, my own device iphone 7p will crash when launch 
Basically when I was giving **dynamic** negative animation speeds, through **lottie-react-native**, the animation wouldn't play at all.

After debugging it through **lottie-react-native** and **lottie-ios** I found out the issue was on not using the absolute value on the calculation of **layerAnimation.beginTime**.

After making this change, the animation would start to play in reverse again.
This fixes a regression we noticed when updated from `lottie-ios` from `3.1.2` to `3.1.3` and above.

Please see the [breaking change in here](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/compare/3.1.2...3.1.3#diff-9e48c66544bf5009ef0f877f7d5f53d9L671).

In `3.1.2` the animation was always done inside `CATransaction`, and what's important, when it detected no animation was needed, it still used `CATransaction` but with duration set to `0.0`.

`3.1.3` removed the use of `CATransaction` in favor of `CAAnimation` which is fine for the case when animation being in progress was detected. But when no animation was detected, it was left with:
```
      animationLayer.position = position
      animationLayer.transform = xform
```
which in our case still caused an animation to be performed when it was not needed (maybe some iOS system default animation?).

In the attachment you can find movies showing how animation looks with and without the fix, when contained inside refresh control of a table view.

Since performance is poor when scrolling (See https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/issues/852), I have tried to work around it by stopping animation during scrolling. 
However, performance stayed low even when the animation stopped.  

To repro it I have created an app with 3 pages where every page has a Lottie animation. 

With Core Animation profiling I have tried 3 scenarios:
1. Scrolling when Lottie is animating 
2. Scrolling when Lottie is stopped
3. Scrolling when Lottie is replaced with a UIImage.
 
Here are the results:

setting `shouldRasterizeWhenIdle` to true had no affect.

## This issue is a:
- [x] Non-Crashing Bug (Visual or otherwise)
- [] Crashing Bug
- [] Feature Request
- [] Regression (Something that once worked, but doesn't work anymore)

## Which Version of Lottie are you using?

Lottie 3.1.5

## What Platform are you on? 
- [] MacOS
- [x] iOS

## What Language are you in?
- [x] Swift
- [] Objective-C

## Expected Behavior 
When scrolling, if animation is stopped, FPS (Frame Per Second) should stay high and Device Utilization should stay low. I am expecting the same performance as if Lottie would be replaced with a static UIImage.  

## Actual Behavior
Regardless of animation state (running/stopped) the performance is low.

## Code Example
Test app: https://github.com/IzikLisbon/lottie-performance-bug

A simple app with 3 pages where every page has a Lottie animation. 
Also expose 2 buttons:
1. Remove/Add Lottie
2. Stop/Play Lottie

Note: the app was tested with a much bigger JSON file and the profiler screenshot above was created with that file but even the [committed Animation JSON](https://github.com/IzikLisbon/lottie-performance-bug/blob/master/lottie_performance_bug/animations/medium_animation.json) shows that Device Utilization stays high when animation is stopped (but the FPS stays stable above 55).

how to create a AnimationView with the file path???

The task to load Animation from the network does not support cancellation, I found it's self not weak in completion closure and here use trailing closure may be better
