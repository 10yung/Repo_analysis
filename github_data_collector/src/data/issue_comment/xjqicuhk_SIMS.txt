I was perform the inference on my own semantic masks with resolution "1024 * 2048". According the "Inference" part says, first run test_connect_component_mask.m、search_segments.m、test_generate_transform.m、transformation.py and test_generate_order.m, it's all good. But when run the order.py i got this error:
`Traceback (most recent call last):

    sess.run(proposal_score, feed_dict={data: tmp_data}))
ValueError: could not broadcast input array from shape (4,5,20) into shape (1,20)`

and in order.py i set this:
`batch_size = 1
crop_size_h = 1024
crop_size_w = 2048
input_dim = 6`

Did i miss something?
Best regards.
Hi @xjqicuhk  ,Thanks for your works!
could you provide the  evaluation code you used please? Thanks
We found train_connect_component_mask.m would only process the last image in the list.

In matlab_code/train_connect_component_mask.m,  line 67    

The code is like "for i = size(list,2):size(list,2)".

Should it be changed to "for i = 1:size(list,2)"?

I have tried several times to download the training results, but still cannot get them. I'm wondering if the file in Google Drive is broken or just because the file(4.3G) is too large for browser. Could you please upload results with smaller sizes (like to divide them into several parts)? Thank you for your help : )
