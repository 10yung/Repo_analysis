Hey Jim!

I stumbled upon igv-jupyter and tried it out on this Gen3 Jupyter environment I'm working on.
I have this odd issue, which might not be an igv-jupyter issue, more likely a problem with my use of it.

When I open a notebook, and run it, IGV does not b.show(), and I get an "IGV Browser not ready" message from b.load_track, with a "Could not open comm -- Error: Class igvcomm not found in registry" error in the console.

However, if I open a new browser window, and re-open the running notebook, and run it again, it works just fine? What am I doing wrong?

When a feature is clicked, this event would report the start and end position of the feature.
Here are a few remarks and suggestions to improve the tracks display.

- The "Embedded Features" option is a great idea. Nothing to say, it is very convenient and works well.
- Bam files rendering improved a lot in the last version but for some reason displayMode = "SQUISHED" or "COLLAPSED" do not seem to work (whereas it does for vcf files)
- It would be great to have a possibility to reorder the tracks
- The track settings menu (right cog) is still a little buggy. In particular the tick is massive for the displayMode for instance.

Thanks a lot
