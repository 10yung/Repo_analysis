I tried installing beardedspice on  Catalina 10.15.2. I uninstalled it shortly after and now my media keys behave very strange. The Music app opens when I press play, but cannot be controlled by the media keys. I'm able to stop a Udemy video in Safari when Safari is selected but I cannot play, forward or backward. I removed beardedspice by dragging it into the trash, a second time I used AppCleaner, and a third time I used a uninstall script I found using google. Nothing worked.
Hi!

It'd be so great if the native Apple Podcast app could get support. This'd then cover all the apps I use (Spotify, Youtube, Soundcloud & Podcast)

Thank you so much!
Please add support for DaftCloud, seems like a good SoundCloud controller. Thanks!
Hi

Thx for this awesome app. Any chance there can be support for the jriver media center

beareded spice appears to see the sirius xm tab but can't seem to control it in anyway.  What am I doing wrong?

latest version of bearded spice.
I think the title is self explanatory. But I think it would be great to add an option to pause any playback when you manually lock your mac (with any of the lock shortcuts).

I just updated to MacOS Catalina and Bearded Spice is not working for the Music app (formerly Itunes). Muy guess is that the change in name messed it up because it is still working in Spotify. 
Your software is amazing! I hope it will be working with Itunes/Music again soon.
The Audible plugin does not work anymore. By inspecting the plugin i found the following problems:

- the format does only match on audible.com/cloud-player the url in germany is audible.de/webplayer this will not match
- the selectors are broken
- use .adblPlayButton / .adblPauseButton to select play / pause button
- selectors for art, chapter, timecur and timeRem are broken
i would recommend to use document.getElementById() with adbl-cloudBook, cp-Top-chapter-display, adblMediaBarTimeSpent and adblMediaBarTimeLeft

As these are only the things i used to fix it myself i  don't know if these are universal. 

Can you please add support for YouTube music app (the unofficial) or for the music.youtube.com website :)
