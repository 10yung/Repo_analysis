:-1: invalid task ('StripNIB /Users/mr/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Baby-emqiljxsmwtxceccytunwzjhswit/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Pull-to-Refresh.Rentals-IOS/YALSunnyRefreshControl~iphone.nib') with mutable output but no other virtual output node (in target 'Pull-to-Refresh.Rentals-IOS')
I installed it in CocoaPods but can't even get it setup 
I tried different circular images animation and it worked perfectly. I want to use different type of animation like wifi signals up down (connecting wifi on mac or somewhat like that). Is there any option for it because i couldn't find it
When i use it in 'UITableViewController' , after it help me with Refresh, tableView's contentInset changed~  it's not what we want always ~~
Anyone have any resources on how to use this in swift? Have made the bridging header but can't seem to work. When I try to import the project I run into this error

I can not scroll to the  bottom to see the last cell after it ends
I have added the refresh control in a tableview. This was working fine in iOS10 but in iOS11 when I programmatically try to refresh there is a stuck in the animation and I have to manually pull the tableview to make it right.
What might be the problem?
