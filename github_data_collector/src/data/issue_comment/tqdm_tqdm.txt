Love the tool! I have an odd use-case where I don't know the total at the beginning so I update it as it grows. This works really well for the % calculation, but the bar itself is confined to the number of iterations initially set in total.

```
from tqdm import tqdm_notebook as tqdm
prog=tqdm(total=500, dynamic_ncols=True)
prog.total = 1000
prog.update(500) #shows a full progress bar (incorrect) & 50% metric (correct)
```

In case I'm just missing a method, I posted a more complete example on S/O:

I thoroughly enjoy using tqdm for lots of notebook oriented projects. However the 'leave' keyword always requires me to look up the documentation having got the behaviour wrong the first time. It seems to have a double meaning when `leave=True`, either:

- `leave` the progress bar on screen  (e.g. stays displayed), or
- The progress bar should `leave` the screen (e.g. gets removed from display).

Alternatively, `stay=True` would be unambiguous.

I realise that changing the kwarg behaviour might be undesired, and I should just remember which way around is appropriate. Just wondered whether clarifying the keyword in the API could be considered at some point in the future.

The [parameters docs](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm#parameters) indicate that disable can be use to "do the right thing" if there's no TTY:
> disable : bool, optional
> Whether to disable the entire progressbar wrapper [default: False]. If set to None, disable on non-TTY.

It's less surprising for Jupyter tqdm to display itself when `disable=None` rather than to hide itself. I'd say being in a Notebook is more like being connected to a TTY than not.

I'm new to the tqdm module, I used exactly the nested progress and multiprocessing examples in the documentation, but still get the the result below (in CMD), even worse in pycharm, start a new line every time update.

```python
from time import sleep
from tqdm import trange, tqdm
from multiprocessing import Pool, freeze_support, RLock

L = list(range(9))

def progresser(n):
    interval = 0.001 / (n + 2)
    total = 5000
    text = "#{}, est. {:<04.2}s".format(n, interval * total)
    for i in trange(total, desc=text, position=n,ascii=True):
        sleep(interval)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    freeze_support()  # for Windows support
    p = Pool(len(L),
             # again, for Windows support
             initializer=tqdm.set_lock, initargs=(RLock(),))
    p.map(progresser, L)
    print("\n" * (len(L) - 2))
  ```

Is there anything not mentioned in the documentation? Or am I doing something wrong? Please give me a hint, thank you so much!

When I run tqmd in a remote server and connect via ssh, the output of the tqdm progressbar looks like this

It seems tqdm is using the wrong row and column lengths (of the tty). How should this be fixed ?

This bug is especially weird since it tends to occur only when I re-run a given cell i.e. the progress bar behaves as expected when running a cell with `.progress_apply()` the first time, but if you run the cell again without making any changes then it creates a new line for every update in the progress bar. Also, note that this behavior is unique to `tqdm.pandas()` and I have not been able to replicate it with `tqdm_notebook()`

When I try to import an MNIST dataset from Tensorflow_datasets, the import failes due to a Name Error in the tqdm StatusPrinter. To import, I used the following code
  ```python
     mnist_dataset, mnist_info = tfds.load(name='mnist', with_info=True, as_supervised=True)
  ```
and got the following error message:

```python
NameError Traceback (most recent call last)
~\Anaconda3\envs\py3_TF2.0\lib\site-packages\tqdm\notebook.py in status_printer(_, total, desc, ncols)
     95         try:
---> 96             if total:
     97                 pbar = IProgress(min=0, max=total)

NameError: name 'IProgress' is not defined
```

Using the Following:

Windows 10 64-bit
Python 3.7
Tensorflow 2.0.0
tqdm 4.40.2

Might be a mistake by me, I'm a starter, but thanks for your help

Anyway to fix this?


How can one conveniently easily view `tqdm` output that has been redirected to a file, preferably with built-in commands on linux like `less` or `vim`?

Here is an example:
tqdm_test.py
```
from tqdm import trange
for i in trange(10):
    pass
```
After running `python3 tqdm_test.py 2> tqdm_test.txt` on bash, I get this visual output when running `less tqdm_test.txt`
