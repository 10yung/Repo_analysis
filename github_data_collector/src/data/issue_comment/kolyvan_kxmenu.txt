How do I display fetched items from web service ?
How do I set action on individual menu items in swift 3?
I am using your KxMenu for my app development
I need to add scroll to KxMenu
how can I add scroll?

can you help me?

Regards.

When I built it for iOS 8 in the Xcode 7, it will report some errors. After checking, the header file has been wrong. The Foundation is the kit for Mac OS X, but not for iOS. So the header file importing of KxMenu.h should be UIKit/UIKit.h.
`#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>`
And there is some warnings for iOS 7 and later. The first is `[menuItem.title sizeWithFont:[UIFont systemFount]]` in -mkContentView. It can be used as `const CGSize titleSize = [menuItem.title sizeWithAttributes:@{NSFontAttributeName:[UIFont systemFontOfSize:14]}];`
The second is a dismissMenu warning. It can add a declaration in the KxMenuView like this `@interface KxMenuView : UIView
-(void) dismissMenu:(BOOL)animated;
@end` to avoid this kind of building warning.

Create background image wihtout tint color alpha component.

Hi,
The images used in KxMenuItem are shown as blurred ones when the view is presented (presentViewController:). But the same images are displayed properly when the view is pushed (pushViewController:). Why is it so? 

I want to be able to do something in my implementation when the menu is dismissed. In my particular scenario, I'm changing the background color of a row when the button to display the menu is clicked and reverting the color when the menu is dismissed by tapping anywhere (seems to be the 'SingleTap' event). It's possible that this functionality is already available and maybe I'm missing something so let me know.

Is there a way to change size of Menu items?
