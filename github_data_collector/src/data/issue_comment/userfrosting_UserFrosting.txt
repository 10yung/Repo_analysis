When the config parameter 'require_email_verification' is set to true and no SMTP values are provided, account transactional emails cannot be sent and result in a HTTP 500 error being received.

For example, when registering a user, the error message 'Oops, looks like our server might have goofed. If you're an admin, please check the PHP or UserFrosting logs.' is shown. There are no entries in the php_error.log or userfrosting.log files. The browser console shows an error: 
```
VM13263:1 POST http://localhost/cjb/public/account/register 500 (Internal Server Error)
(anonymous) @ VM13263:1
send @ jquery-3.2.1.min.js:4
ajax @ jquery-3.2.1.min.js:4
Plugin.submitForm @ uf-form.js:186
Plugin.defaultSubmitHandler @ uf-form.js:177
e @ jquery-3.2.1.min.js:2
handle @ jquery.validate.js:75
(anonymous) @ jquery.validate.js:98
dispatch @ jquery-3.2.1.min.js:3
q.handle @ jquery-3.2.1.min.js:3
```
The 500 error response body is:
```
{
    "message": "Invalid address:  (Reply-To): ",
    "exception": [
        {
            "type": "PHPMailer\\PHPMailer\\Exception",
            "code": 0,
            "message": "Invalid address:  (Reply-To): ",
            "file": "\/Applications\/XAMPP\/xamppfiles\/htdocs\/cjb2\/app\/vendor\/phpmailer\/phpmailer\/src\/PHPMailer.php",
            "line": 1068
        }
    ]
}
```
Another example is for a registered user, when filling in the Forgotten Password field, the same error is thrown.

This can be resolved by adding SMTP details, but the system does offer the option to not use any, and so should function without any SMTP details provided.
Install nodejs alongside php so bakery bake commands can be executed.

Use docker-compose extensively so you know in which container you're running your commands.
Added the pt_br translation on `\UserFrosting\app\sprinkles\core\locale\pt_BR`
I recently did a fresh install of UF and I keep getting npm errors:

When I try to run the app I get the following:

When looking at the folders, the vendor folder folder which should contain font-awesome and bootstrap does not exist. If I try to to add the assets separately I get the following:

The `!important` on this line makes it incredibly hard to dynamically set a smaller width. This CSS file has the most priority over the other standard included CSS files, so the !important is effectively redundant.

E.g. `$(".select2-container").css("width", "8%")` doesn't work because the  `!important` overrides the inline style. It's almost impossible to add a !important with jQuery, see: https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11173

To  get around this problem, one has to resort to this sort of ugliness:
`$(".select2-container")[0].style.setProperty("width", "8%", "important")`


Hi,

Current version: Admin Panel 3.4.2

How can I disable user simultaneous login? Currently a user can login into multiple browsers with the same user account. This is not good for security.


Missing translation keys were added in `4.3` but we still need translators to assist with translations. 

The keys that need translated have been commented out in each locale file. 

- [x] ar (Arabic)
- [x] de_DE (German)
- [x] el (Greek)
- [x] fa (Persian)
- [x] fr_FR (French)
- [ ] it_IT (Italian)
- [ ] pt_PT (Portuguese)
- [ ] ru_RU (Russian) 
- [x] th_TH (Thai)
- [ ] tr (Turkish)
- [ ] zh_CN (Chinese)

Instead of bundling all locale in default UF install, other languages should be bundle in their own sprinkles. 

I believe new features coming in #850, this should work easily, make default install lighter and probably easier to keep up to date along with #671.
