Hi,

Can I include the notes (i.e., the text under each header) as well as the header in the `md2mm()` and `mm2md()`? 

I've tried, but this does not seem to work.
Thanks,
Atanas
For more general use, in `md2mm` you should at  least allow a `max.level` argument to select the maximum level in markdown files that will be shown in the mindmap.

max.level = 1: show only chapter level
max.level = 2: show only chapter/section level
...
