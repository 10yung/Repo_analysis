This is definitely a better preview than the XCode one but the one thing XCode one does better  is show the entitlements before the provisioned devices, when you have a lot of devices its annoying to have keep scrolling to the bottom to check them
Why not show Apple ID info?
It will be very convenient for multi Apple ID user.
Please consider it. Thank you.
Since you support Homebrew, any chance of adding MacPorts support?
