Hello, thank you for this amazing library. it is so good.
I need to change bottom button font.
I change nav bar item font with this code:
let attributes = [NSAttributedString.Key.font : UIFont.fontWith(style: .bold, size: .large) ]
        UINavigationBar.appearance().titleTextAttributes = attributes // Title fonts
        UIBarButtonItem.appearance().setTitleTextAttributes(attributes, for: .normal)

but I can't change bottom button font. "library and camera"

this library has very good config and i think it is good for something like this:
config.buttons.font = your font()

When you record landscape (left or right) I can see there is orientation returned and videoObject with connections containing that orientation in `YPVideoCaptureHelper - startRecording()`

However on the Trim and later on my preview screen I can see that video is in Portrait mode, and now needs to be rotated to the rotation on which it was recorder.

So if I record video in the landscapeRight, I need to have that video rotated from landscape back to portrait, just like YouTube app does. I think that makes a lot of sense.

Currently video is not rotated and it is basically unusable if you record video landscape.

Is there any plan to add this feature and to fix this behaviour?

Hello , 

I have the issue with change the background color for the nabber and tabbar with tint color 
is this color only support in library?

thank you
I'd like to suggest defaulting to the new iOS13 icon provided by Apple when they are available and if the icons have not been overridden. They look great and there's an icon for everything.

**Describe the bug**
When picking photo from library and switching app to system gallery app I delete the photo I just picked with the picker. The list below picked image updates but the photo itself doesn't disappear. When clicking 'next' button app crashes - 403 line of YPLibraryVC class - fatalError() in guard let.
Is there a way to commit the crash?

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open picker
2. Select photo from gallery
3. Go to iOS photo gallery app
4. Deleted photo You picked in picker in your app
5. Click next button in picker
6. App crashes

**Expected behavior**
Change the selected photo to the most recent one (deleted one is still displayed)
