 - Log file 
[WinDynamicDesktop.exe.log](https://github.com/t1m0thyj/WinDynamicDesktop/files/4072507/WinDynamicDesktop.exe.log)

 - Windows version: 10 (1909)
 - WinDynamicDesktop version: 3.4.1
 - Installation source: installer (WinDynamicDesktop_3.4.1_Setup.exe)

Upgraded from version 3.4.0.0 to version 3.4.1, running Windows 10, and none of the settings from the previous version were remembered. I had to re-enter my location, and re-download 100MB worth of wallpapers. I think it would be nice if upgrading to a newer version were a little more seamless.

Is it possible to add the ability to have a random theme chosen every day? I use a similar app on Mac OS (24 Hour Wallpaper) it would be great to have this functionality!
**Issue**
Changing the wallpaper "blocks" a large portion of the GPU performance. You can see core clocks dropping, and as a result if you are currently in a 3D application (e.g. game -- confirmed, movie - supposedly) you get a stutter.
**Other details**
This is not something which seems to be a fault of the application itself, as I confirmed that the same stutter and drop occurs when changing the wallpaper manually without the app running.
**Solution**
As such (since I suppose there is nothing you can do about that) the workaround seems to be to pause the function of wallpaper change when there is a 3D application running and resume upon exit of the game/movie. Since the wallpaper shouldn't be visible during the 3D application, this seems like an acceptable workaround.
**Versions**
 - Windows 10 1809
 - WinDynamicDesktop version 2.4.0
 - Tested and confirmed with both Microsoft Store install and the portable EXE

This is not a bug report.

I've quickly hacked a little tool to generate a ddw file from a single image. It's available here: https://github.com/pchalamet/DynDesktopBuilder
It just modifies brightness of the image from 0 to -50% (using Sine) and package everything.

But this would be nice to have this baked into WDD instead - it's really basic and could be generated on the fly probably (and save megabytes).

Anyway, thanks for the tool. It's lovely.
Feature request: When user select your own custom wallpaper, make this wallpaper darker at night. Switch wallpaper to dimmed when dark mode is activated.

Thank you for great product!
Hi, first of all thanks for great app.

It would be very nice to support `.heic` file format directly (import), so that people don't need to adjust wallpapers from [dynamic wallpaper club](https://dynamicwallpaper.club/)

There are libraries to work with heic:
https://github.com/mczachurski/wallpapper
 - Install program on a computer behind a network internet proxy.
 - Windows 10
 - WinDynamicDesktop 3.3.0
 - Installation source: Installer

It seem that your current version does not support internet access through a network proxy, since there is no way or places to configure the Proxy Server, Port and optional proxy credentials in order to let the program to reach internet other than in direct routed way. This prevent the program to get configured and used for all those people that doesn't have a direct internet connection, but that need to use a proxy server with or without authentication.
Hi,

I love this SW, and have it installed on every computer which I have.
Could you integrate that if you use Pivot on the 2nd monitor, that it will get fullscreen?
Currently I looks like that
