When I try to add the PPA (`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mutate/ppa`) I get error:

`HTTP Error 404: Not Found
Cannot add PPA: ''This PPA does not support bionic''.`

Same issue using package manager.

Perhaps the PPA needs to be updated?  Thanks!

I cannot compile Mutate on Ubuntu Bionic (18.4), I *have* been able to compile on Ubuntu Xenial, thanks to some hints in the issues here. My new notebook has Bionic installed, I'd like to avoid reverting to Xenial. I can see that there was a 2.4 release of Mutate, but the README still refers to a 2.3 deb file, which is nowhere to be found.

Here is the pertinent output from `make` (all previous output was uneventful/successful)

I suspect what I'm looking at is another issue with the older libboost version 1.55 library that Mutate requires. I *have* installed libboost-all-dev which *should* be enough. Help?
Thanks a lot for your efforts in supporting this great tool! :+1:  

Editing config.ini sometimes stops Mutate from working, for example if a new item was not correctly edited, but saved though.

**Feature Wish:** It would be great if Mutate would detect corrupt config-items and help recover from it. For example by creating a backup config.ini when "preference"Â is called, and restore that backup and notify the user, when a corrupt ini is detected.

In the meantime: where does Mutate log errors, so one can more easily correct corrupted items in the config.ini manually?
it will result in not print any result in mutate. 
i use this script: 
#!/usr/bin/python2
#encoding=utf-8

import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('dict.db')
c = conn.cursor()

print '[' + 'test' + ']'
print 'command=copy'                                                                                                                                                                           
print 'icon='
print 'subtext=' + 'test'
c.execute('SELECT * FROM dict WHERE en=?', ('happy',))
print '[' + 'test' + ']'
print 'command=copy'
print 'icon='
print 'subtext=' + 'test' 

and it only print one item, can you help me?



I type something then I want to change keybord layout (e.g. from english to russian) i hit super+space and nothing happens.

Even PrtSc doesn't work when Mutate widget is active.
When running google search plugin it automatically inserts text from clipboard (if it was copied with `CTRL+V`). However if I copy stuff from tmux, it still uses the old value. I'm not sure which clipboard Mutate actually uses. Additionally if I delete something in vim it will be used properly in Mutate, however if I use yank command (`y`), it won't get copied. Note that  the other programs work fine and the text is copied to system clipboard regardless of what I do.

I'm using this command for tmux:
```
bind-key -t vi-copy y copy-pipe "tmux save-buffer - | xclip -sel clipboard -i"
```
I also tried primary clipboard but it doesn't work.

For the first workaround I'd be fine with just running command and then using `Ctrl+V` to copy the last thing, but I'm not sure how to specify it in `config.ini`.  So when I press the desired hotkey, I get prompt with `youtube` and then I have to enter what I want without Mutate automatically inserting the last thing in clipboard. How do I do that? Thanks.
Parameters for gnome-session-quit was incorrect.

Changed to ```--power-off``` as of http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/zesty/man1/gnome-session-quit.1.html and https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-session/blob/master/tools/gnome-session-quit.c
Tried installing both ways, here is via the gdebi method:

Following the instructions to build a rpm for 2.4 I get :

It seems to be related to `boost` (my guess, could be wrong); I have:
