I've ran `nmap -n -p80,443 --script http-enum my.gogs.website.com`, gave me result:
```

So I've checked `/debug` URL and found at least sensitive data:

* Other runtime and memory information's, that I'm sure they're are not necessary to be public and might be used in someking hack

fixes #5677 

Added `MakeURL` method to `Repository`
`MakeURL` gets `string` or `url.URL` as argument and returns URL prepended with repository URL



Hello.
I migrate from bitbacket to gogs, and in PR i want to be able auto fill PR title field.
So i write some simple code for this feature and my explanation how it works.

It works like `.gogs/PULL_REQUEST.md`
But fills `pull request title field`.
And have some feature, like `branch placeholders`

For example init repository:
1. Init repo with `PULL_REQUEST_TITLE.md`
```bash
$ ... git init etc...
$ echo 'Merge {{headBranch}} into {{baseBranch}}' > .gogs/PULL_REQUEST_TITLE.md
$ git add . && git commit -m "custom pr title for gogs" && git push origin master
```
2. Then create new branch for test compare web form
```bash
$ git checkout -b test-1
$ echo 'changes in readme' > README.md
$ git add && git commit -m "changes in readme" && git push origin test-1
```
3. Go to link `http://localhost:3000/ivanb/test1/compare/master...ivanb:test-1`
And we will get some html code
```html
...
<div class="ui segment content">
<div class="field">
   <input name="title" placeholder="Заголовок" value="Merge test-1 into master" tabindex="3" autofocus="" required="">
</div>
...
```

Thanks for attention

Check for email collisions when updating the entire user information, not when the username is being changed.

Changing a user's email address through `/user/settings` to an email address that's already taken shows an internal server error instead of the appropriate error message.

The `ErrEmailAlreadyUsed` error type was incorrectly checked for during the username update in the same function, when it is impossible for that error to occur.  This PR performs the check after the `db.UpdateUser()` call, which can return the "email already used" error, and renders the error message on the form accordingly, instead of failing with an internal server error.

Fixes #5899

**Describe the bug**
When changing email address in `/user/settings`, if the new email already exists for another user, an error 500 page is displayed instead of the proper error message.

**Gogs version or commit**
76b87b1bbd9dcbb1adf0192b1168905565fea774

**Git version**

```
$ git version
git version 2.22.2
```

**Operating system**
Alpine in Docker (on Arch Linux)

**Database**
sqlite

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to https://try.gogs.io/user/settings
2. Change Email address to one that's already taken.
3. Click "Update Profile".
4. See error 500 page.

**Can you reproduce the bug at https://try.gogs.io?**
Yes.  See repro instructions above.

**Expected behavior**
The message "Email address has already been used." should appear above the form in a red box.

**Actual behavior**
500 internal server error page.

**Additional context**
The email conflict error is incorrectly checked during the username change (`db.ChangeUserName()`) instead of when the whole user information is updated (`db.UpdateUser()`).
See https://github.com/gogs/gogs/blob/76b87b1bbd9dcbb1adf0192b1168905565fea774/internal/route/user/setting.go#L78-L79
How can I modify the Slack webhook so it displays well in Microsoft Teams according to the format shown below:

https://messagecardplayground.azurewebsites.net
**Describe the bug**
Adding a third option for end users to log in ends in 500 error email already in use even though user already exists.

**Gogs version or commit**
0.11.91.0811

**Git version**
git version 2.24.0.windows.2

**Operating system**
Windows Server 2012 R2 

**Database**
MySQL (MariaDB Server version: 10.1.34-MariaDB)

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Log in as an Admin
2. Navigate to the Admin Panel
3. Select Authentications
4. Add a new Authentication Source type LDAP (via BindDN), Unencrypted, User Filter: `(&(objectClass=Person)(|(sAMAccountName=%s)(mail=%s)(employeenumber=%s)))` and Username Attribute of `sAMAccountName`.
5. Log in with `sAMAccountName` -> Successful
6. Log in with `mail` -> Successful
7. Log in with `employeenumber` -> 500 error

**Can you reproduce the bug at https://try.gogs.io?**
No: LDAP server(s) cannot be reached from the outside world for my company and would be bad even if it was reachable to set up in the test instance.

**Expected behavior**
Regardless of what attributes I want gogs to check on for authentication, if the user already exists (should check Username Attribute and/or email), and the associated User Filter is successful, the user should be able to log in and not receive a 500 status.

**Actual behavior**
Logging in using `employeenumber` results in 500 error email already exists.

**Screenshots**

**Additional context**
If it helps, all the fields I am using in AD are of Syntax DirectoryString.

Content of gogs.log logging in with `employeenumber`, then immediately logging in using `sAMAccountName`:

I've just encountered the problem that when browsing multiple files in different tabs, the tab title does not show the file name, which makes browsing a repository a happy game of memory for the entire family. This PR takes the fun away and should just display the file name in the title.
