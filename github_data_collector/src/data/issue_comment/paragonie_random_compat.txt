Hi,
We are using paragonie/random_compat with laravel, on running the Fortify scan tool, i get the following error at:
paragonie/random_compat/other/build_phar.php, line 35

file_get_contents method is creating path manipulation error.
Is there any workaround or fix that can be applied here. Could this be taken care in the future versions .

Thanks.

random_compat/other/ folder not getting downloaded
Hello,

Since PHP 5.* is now EOL across the board, should this package be marked as abandoned or some message be added to the top of the readme to tell users its no longer needed or supported?

As your Readme says, you're only responding to new issues regarding supported PHP versions, however this package doesn't provide anything for PHP 7.1+?
Hi all,

This is just a "service message".

For those people who use this library and use [`PHPCompatibility`](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility) in their CI process, there is now a custom ruleset available which can be used to prevent false positives being thrown by `PHPCompatibility` for the native PHP functionality being polyfilled by this repo.

You can find the repo for the `PHPCompatibilityParagonieRandomCompat` ruleset here on Github as well as on Packagist.
* https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibilityParagonie
* https://packagist.org/packages/phpcompatibility/phpcompatibility-paragonie

Hope someone will find it useful :smile: 

P.S.: If anyone is interested in helping us to maintain the ruleset, please [open an issue in the repo](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibilityParagonie/issues/new).
Just to save everyone some time:

This is not a mistake. This is not weird. This is not being removed.

### What's going on?

See https://github.com/paragonie/random_compat#version-99999

I put it in the README to save everyone time. I suppose an open issue will be more visible.
