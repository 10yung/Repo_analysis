I can run gdb linux on Noah, but when I use file command to load file execute, it will exit
Is there any documentation? At all? How do I run apps through this? 

when I try sudo noah /Downloads/SpeedCrunch-0.12-linux64.deb I get this error:

Error: Exec format error.


Any help?

I was able to install Noah on a Mac and when I tried running a Linux binary compiled using gfortran, I received an error saying the shared gfortran library libgfortran.so.3 was not available. Is there a way to install the gfortran shared files to run these binaries?
This not exactly an issue. The readme page show a X11 app (xclock), the ubuntu comes with noahstrap (version 2.0.0) doesn't have X11, how to get a ubuntu distribution with X11 support from noahstrap?
I'm using noah version 0.5.1.

## Environment info
OS: `macOS Mojave 10.14.2`
Noah version: `0.5.1`
## Issue description
Trying to run a binary that was originally compiled for CentOS 7. Regardless of my answer to `noah` asking to run as root, I get the following error message: 

```
centos_binary.exe: error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
Im getting overlapping regions errors with the original code as it 
seems to skip sections when doing munmap.
find_region_range should iterate the tree by using RB_PREV or by going down the tree as below.

for (struct mm_region *r = leftmost;NULL != r;){
    if (region_compare(&find, r) == 0){
      leftmost = r;
      r = RB_LEFT(r, tree);
    } else
      r = RB_RIGHT(r, tree);
  }

If we hit a PF for an address in the vsyscall page, allocate some memory
in the process address space which will do `syscall;retq`, and depending
on the offset into the vsyscall page set `RAX` to the desired syscall
number.

This does not implement a true fast path for syscalls, nor does it
implement vDSO.
I installed Noah

GNU "tar" has been installed as "gtar".
If you need to use it as "tar", you can add a "gnubin" directory

Additionally, you can access its man page with normal name if you add
the "gnuman" directory to your MANPATH from your bashrc as well:

There was an error in between but I am able to use the command `noah`. I want to access the bash shell of Ubuntu. How can I do that?
