Given that you can optimize problems with billions of parameters, have you tried to use REMBO in order to search for the coeffiscients of a deep neural network ?
I just started using REMBO and would like to find the minimum of a function (which is unknown) using REMBO. I understand that we need to specify the bounds to this problem, however how can we specify the intrinsic dimensions of a black box function? 

`[in_bounds, A] = test_fall_in_bound(dim, rm);` - This line seems to select the random embedding matrix A and whether the maximizer falls within the box or not. I fail to understand how to select this option without knowing the functional form of the black box function.

I am sorry but I could not understand the code testBranin.m without further documentation - are further documentations available anywhere ? Maybe a demo example ?
