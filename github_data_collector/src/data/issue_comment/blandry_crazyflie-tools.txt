Hi @blandry ,
I am using a really simple tracker with kinect and was wondering if it would work if I used the coordinates obtained from kinect to publish on the SE_VICON_CHANNEL , using the firmware2. Thanks!

Hi @blandry ,

I am thinking about implementing the differential flatness controller for crazyflie 2.0 based on Mellinger's paper. I used your code as reference, and had some questions about "crazyflie-tools/matlab/invertFlatOutputs.m". Can you give me some insights, so that I can speed up my learning curve?
1. You used [x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw,xd,yd,zd,rolld,pitchd,yawd] as states, instead of [x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw,xd,yd,zd,p,q,r] in Mellinger's paper. Why?
2. You get "u = omega_squared" for the controller using differential flatness. Then abandoned it, and used "u = [x(4:6);p,q,r;.25*u1/kF(1)]" instead. Why? And the dimension of u seems to be wrong, because u1 is a scaler. 

Thanks,

Li

This is a major work item but we should try to rebase of Bitcraze latest firmware.

Hi Benoit,

Great work and thanks for sharing! I found your thesis after finding this repository and it is being a great read!

I was wondering which firmware for the CF2.0 you would advise to download and if you had done any tests comparing your firmware against the firmware by bitcraze? do you know if there is any major update they have done comparing to your latest firmware? 

I was planning to use your estimator and the model you identified on my application. I am running the whoenig/crazyflie_ros and was interested to improve the controller to do some precise landing and was thinking of running an LQR with your model. In case you have any tips, they would be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks a lot!

Best,
Jos√© 

Hi

Can't access the Vicon folder.
Can somebody help me?

Thanks

We need to reproduce the logic for the usb driver found here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-clients-python/develop/lib/cflib/drivers/crazyradio.py

It created the problem that is discussed here (with a temporary fix):
https://github.com/blandry/crazyflie-tools/issues/21#issuecomment-120319627

Working on this!

CF2 firmware now finished compiling, with only the warnings as follows:

@blandry help?

We need to setup better documentation for installation and usage.
