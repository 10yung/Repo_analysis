In main screen it should be possible to use the pull-to-refresh to check all active monitors.

**Description what you'd like to happen:**

We all agree Nock Nock is a great tool for monitoring Web servers. What if it could monitor other servers too, for example ones that don't have an HTTP server but run OpenSSH?

I propose the simple check of creating a TCP connection to the specified host/port and immediately tearing it down again. If this succeeds, it's almost certain that the service is up. (It is possible that a daemon would establish a TCP connection and then not function properly, but this is unlikely unless going through inetd.)

**Describe alternatives you've considered:**

* Run an HTTP server on the computer solely for the purpose of nocking on it (checks that the server is running, but not if the daemon of interest is; also enlarges the attack surface)
* Use a different tool (no automated scanning tool in F-Droid, but there may be non-free options)
* Set up a daemon on an HTTP-equipped server which polls the various non-HTTP servers of interest and summarises their state in a page served over HTTP, which is in turn checked using Nock Nock's Search Term functionality (awkward and ad-hoc; everyone has to build their own solution)

Feel free to close this feature request if you consider it to be out of scope though.
Many times, the site is reported as down because not having internet (related to #44) or because it is actually down but just for a very short time that happens to coincide with the app checking, but shortly after it is up again (because it automatically restarts or something). Currently, in these cases the app doesn't check the status again until the next regular interval, and meanwhile shows the annoying notification that the site is down, while it actually isn't.
My proposal is to add two different checking intervals, one for when the site is up and one for when it is down. In this way you could set a long intervall for normal use and a very short one for when it is reported down to check again shortly after and remove the notification if necessary, as it is up again or you have regained internet connection.

**App Version:**

0.8.8
 
**Affected Device(s):**
 
All, probably..
 
**Describe the Bug:**
If the site is using cloudflare, and there is a wait time shown by cloudflare (5 seconds wait screen) then the app logs it as an Error and shows a 503 Error.

**Expected Behavior:**
Should wait for the expected time, then check if the site is working or not..
**Description what you'd like to happen:**

When typing in a Site Tag, have an autocomplete dropdown showing possible tags. This would be for existing tags that are entered in the app.

It would be really cool if one could see the expiration date of certificates of monitored sites.

An option to get a warning if the date is nearer than a certain threshold (e.g. ten days) would be even better.
I have some sites at work that I want to monitor. They run on IIS. When I add them to the app, the response it receives is 400 Bad request and says a header name is invalid,  but does not say which header.

I'll make a pull request, but I want to make sure we agree on the desired behavior first

**Description what you'd like to happen:**

related to #4. Don't notify me every $(Check Interval) when a broken site stays broken. Suppose I have a website that is down. I want to know quickly that it is up again, so I set the check interval to 1 minute. I get a notification every minute for that site being down. **I would prefer if I get a notification the first time it goes down, then never again until it comes back up.**

**Describe alternatives you've considered:**

The current behavior is an alternative, but it feels a bit spammy. There could be a [persistent notification](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12205551/create-a-persistent-notification-and-prevent-notification-in-status-bar) (one of those notifications that you can't dismiss) as long as a site is down, but not a notification event every time the nock nock checks and fails to establish a connection.

Tried your app for a few days, and during a day I get ~10 false negatives when the site is actually up all the time. It gets annoying because the check mechanism can't differentiate between the site problem and a local network problem. One possible culprit could be the call in the performValidation function. Once the http call is started and the network connection is lost, then the response will always be `ERROR`. 

For example, the check is started when the data connection is valid, the data connection is lost, and the app reports a timeout. This timeout is of no interest to the user, the site is not actually down.

I would suggest adding some sort of condition on when the site is considered to be down depending on another site's up status. E.g. my site is only down when google is up and reachable.

I don't know if properly testing for a valid conncetion helps in the case of mobile apps. The connection could drop anytime and does this often.
Would be cool to have a backup/restore :grinning:

1. To the local file system
2. To Google Drive?
