Step 1 is to run following command
pivot_ui(df)
Step 2 is to select required  data using GUI

now i want to collect data in jupyter notebook for further processing. Please guide us 
Hi, i used pip install and had this same null error.

Hello
Thank you for solution, really magic!
We have several issues
1. Doesn't work showUI=False, maybe special syntax?
2. Would you please be so kind to make example in readme for Filter function. Thank you
3. I catch 400 exeption when i try to open notebook in nbviewer whit code like this

`import pandas
from pivottablejs import pivot_ui
df=pandas.read_csv('/datasets/data.csv',delimiter=';')
df.head
pivot_ui(df)`

which perfectly works in jupiter notebook interface

I find workaround for nbviewer
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/psychemedia/9c54721e853403b43d21/pivotTable_demo.ipynb
but it doesn'render pivot in jupiter notebook (in editing mode)

maybe i'll be possible to include method like plotly.offline.init_notebook_mode()
?
In : pivot_ui(df)
Out : <IPython.lib.display.IFrame at 0x.....>

there is no " pop_out ".  Screen below remains blank, no "pop_out" words either.
In some locations, for some reason [network, device, etc] cloudflare may not be resolved thus no script /css gets downloads and thus the content does not render.
My suggestion would be to embed the `css` and `js` on the `html` output itself.
I did a quick test on one of those locations, `wget -i links.txt` which `links.txt` containing all those Cloudflare links and then edit the output `html` to link to local files. It all works.
But having several local files is a bit of a mess thus I'd prob fork to get those embed.

You ok with that fork, as I assume you'd not like to merge that change?
Can support for jupyterlab? Thanks!
First of all, this tool is amazing and useful, but I would like to know if is possible to show only the chart itself, without any additional drag and drop stuffs. I have tried to set the "showUI" parameter to False, but it was not enough.

Thanks
Hi

Is there a snippet of code, somewhere, of how to use an extension renderer such as Subtotal.js with PivotTablesJs on Jupyter?
One of the things the pivot table gadget is good for is helping novices get a feel for reshaping a dataset and looking at the output from a particular transformation.

I would be really handy to be able to export he pandas equivalent code for a transformation so it could be applied directly to the pandas dataframe that feeds the pivot_table in the parent notebook.

I can think of one corollary to this - the [jigsaw magic](https://github.com/Calysto/metakernel/blob/master/metakernel/magics/jigsaw_magic.py) embeds an HTML blockly code editor and optionally allows the exporting of code equivalent to the program in the editor into a code cell created beneath the widget.

It would be handy if jupyter_pivottablejs could do something similar, by exporting pandas code equivalent to the transformation operation applied in the pivottable, if not the visualisation.
