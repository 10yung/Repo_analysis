hides the bottom line of the code in editor visible area.
This signing thing is cumbersome.  Can't someone just get an apple developer certificate and release signed installers or something? Xcode extensions can also be distributed via the mac app store
In visual mode, when curosr is around one of (){}, its corresponding paired one is not highlighted.
Currently you have to turn to insert mode to get that work.
It would be helpful especially for deep nested {}.
My custom operation is release colon key first and shift key following, which will change the input method. I should take care of the order every time to save file. It's disturb me so much. I hope the 
next version will fix the issue. Thank you.

How to set it to '~/Library/...'

Here is the install log.
[log.txt](https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim2/files/3867647/log.txt)

- I use the newest version of branch 'develop'
- Just press 'p' or 'P', Xcode will crash
- Other vim func is OK
Indenting multiple lines with the down motion (e.g. `>2j`) does work, but trying to do the same starting from the bottom and moving up (e.g. `>2k`) does not. The same issue occurs with `<`.
The step 7 is not showing. (You'll be asked if you load XVim. Press 'Yes' to it. If you press 'No' by mistake, close the Xcode and execute the following from a terminal)

Below is the last part of the installation log:
```
