Small patch to include the client id to the environment when calling client-connect or client-disconnect scripts.
Could be useful as "unique" client id.

I dont know if this is useful enough for a real PR, so this is more like an RFC currently.
Without this patch, the PAM enviornment lacks any information about the remote client address.

Furthermore, the presence of the remote client address in PAM
environment, enables usage of pam modules like pam_recent
[https://github.com/az143/pam_recent].

FYI: Also submitted patch via `git send-email --to=openvpn-devel@lists.sourceforge.net HEAD~1`
Adding --askpin option modeled after --askpass, letting people enter pin early
int he startup or more importantly allow them to keep a password in separate
file to simplify unattended setup.

Export NotBefore and NotAfter items to the environment. This is usefull when anticipating potential user certificate expiry and acting upon it.

It's better to have distinct enums for more straightforward debug of exit function.


To build, run the following command:

```terminal
docker build . -t "openvpn:${distro}" -f tests/docker/${distro}/Dockerfile
```

Note: Currently, only Debian Stretch, and Ubuntu Bionic have been added.

We have noticed that openvpn does not set the mtu on windows systems. Therefor i have implemented two functions which do exactly that via the netsh commandline tool also used by other functions from openvpn like `netsh_set_dns6_servers`.
Updated to current links, and added SSL to all.
Changed tap-windows to reflect NDIS 6 repository shift.

Read contributing guidelines. Will submit properly in a bit. :)
Replace "servers" with "peers" in the description
of the --redirection-gateway option flag local.

Patch submitted to openvpn-devel.
