When I tried to use this project the latest versions I could find were `1.0.0` for `metarest` (which is what the badge has) and `3.0.0-M7` for paradise. 

Am I missing something? I'm pretty new to Scala and Java dependency management in general. 

I'm using Scala `2.11.8` (Play framework doesn't support 2.12)
