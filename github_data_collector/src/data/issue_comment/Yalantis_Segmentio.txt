hello, this my code,

private func segmentioOptions() -> SegmentioOptions {
        return SegmentioOptions(backgroundColor: UIColor.lightGray,
                                segmentPosition: .fixed(maxVisibleItems: 4),
            scrollEnabled: true,
            indicatorOptions: segmentioIndicatorOptions(),
            horizontalSeparatorOptions: SegmentioHorizontalSeparatorOptions(
                type: .none,
                height: 1,
                color: .clear
            ),
            verticalSeparatorOptions: SegmentioVerticalSeparatorOptions(
                ratio: 1,
                color: .white
            ),
            imageContentMode: .scaleAspectFit,
            labelTextAlignment: .center,
            labelTextNumberOfLines: 1,
            segmentStates: segmentioStates(),
            animationDuration: 0.1)
    }

I have added one more type .ImageOrLabel, please check it out. I have tried to follow same design you have implemented.

![ImageOrLabel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18231674/66580499-f258b680-eb97-11e9-9bb0-a38a72047dda.png)


In SegmentioItem no tint color is set to the ImageView, so even when the image has a rendering mode equals to AlwaysTemplate it’ll be rendered with its original color.

I've added this feature and backward compatibility is ensured.

Best regards,

# Report
i have replaced the contenview in the example with my own viewCotrollers
it works fine when the app loads and i change the tabs but when i **click on the menu items**
**the screen width is wrong** and it does not scroll to the end!
it works fine on iphone xs but in larger screen sizes like iphone xs

 plus or ipad the size is wrong when the menu is clicked

when i change 
self?.scrollView.frame.width 
to
  UIScreen.main.bounds.width
 it makes the tab size better but with a padding on the sides

 

`
segmentioView.valueDidChange = { [weak self] _, segmentIndex in
            let contentOffsetX = UIScreen.main.bounds.width  * CGFloat(segmentIndex)
changed:",self!.segmentioView.selectedSegmentioIndex)
            self?.scrollView.setContentOffset(
                CGPoint(x: contentOffsetX, y: 0),
                animated: true
            )
      segmentioView.valueDidChange = { [weak self] _, segmentIndex in
           let contentOffsetX = UIScreen.main.bounds.width  * CGFloat(segmentIndex)   
            self?.scrollView.setContentOffset(
                CGPoint(x: contentOffsetX, y: 0),
                animated: true
            )`

 
There are stored twice, but app always calls nib in `Segmentio.bundle`.

```text
Segmentio.framework
├── BadgeWithCounterViewBigSized.nib
├── BadgeWithCounterViewStandardSized.nib
└── Segmentio.bundle
    ├── BadgeWithCounterViewBigSized.nib
    └── BadgeWithCounterViewStandardSized.nib
```

Currently in Segmentio isn't possible to customize appearance such elements centralization.
This implementation adds this feature with three options:

1. None: default behaviour, with a zero inset
2. Centralized: automatically calculates the insets in order to centralize elements
3. Custom: uses the custom inset given by the user
Currently when importing Segmentio from Swift Package Manager in Xcode 11, the compiler complains about a usage of `bringSubviewToFront`. Updating `swift-tools-version` resolves the issue and allows the library to be used this way. 

I'd also suggest tagging versions so SPM can pick them up.
at the default text only style, the selected tab will show underline below the text. but I need to make full highlight color if a tab in segmented control is selected. I mean someting like the orange color like this : https://i.stack.imgur.com/0LnRC.png

is it possible to achieve this using Segmentio ?
