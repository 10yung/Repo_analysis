I have generated the CSV files and I have run the 'Refresh' macro on the Excel Dashboard, but the Dashboard doesn't change. On examining the tabs the 'All Apps Details', 'Claim Rule Details' and 'AAD App Migration Report' are all empty. The other tabs have data in them.

I have 5 CSV files, all of which look to have data in them.

Any ideas as to where I might be going wrong?

Multiple lines were not set to "Normal" which messed up the look of the navigation pane in word
