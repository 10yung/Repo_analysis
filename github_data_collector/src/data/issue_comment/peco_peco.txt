Please add a command line option and global option to allow a single selection only, in other words, disable multiple selections.

# Discussion

When the output of peco is piped to another command that expects only a single argument, selecting multiple items could produce unexpected or unwanted results.  Therefore it would be nice to have a way to disable inadvertently selecting multiple items in situations where passing more than one item to the next command in the pipe or script could be disastrous (for example overwriting the second file).

$ ./peco --version
peco version v0.5.3 (built with go1.10)

$ uname -a

# Abstract
Peco is not working properly in linux running on WSL, it opens the interface but nothing else works and there is no way to quit unless killing the process.

As you can see in the following gif, I pressed some keys but I did not get any response, finally just ctrl-z allowed me to quit from peco.

# What is the peco version, OS, architecture? 

v0.5.3, Mac

# Abstract

Fuzzy match could list exact/substring matches first

# Discussion

I'm just doing a comparison of various tools like this and thought you might like to know about this one.  When selecting fuzzy matching, some other tools (fzf, skim) list substring matches before the fuzzy matches.  peco doesn't do this (an in fact in my test case they happen to be listed last).  I appreciate that this has a performance impact, however it does mean that people can set fuzzy and get the best of both worlds.

found in the wild. Maybe other terminal-controling libraries do not have this problem?
# What is the peco version, OS, architecture? 
peco-v0.5.3, Linux, amd64

# Abstract
Pressing C-t (peco.ToggleQuery) does nothing

# Discussion
If I enter a query, I see only the filtered lines. Then if I press C-t, I still only see the filtered lines.

#### Abstract

Feature request - it would be nice to have a max-lineheight option for cases where you want to see some of your immediate history while reverse searching shell history. For example, if I have just typed a command with a kubernetes pod name (which includes a hash identifier) and I'd like to be able to reference when writing my search query.

It is never mentioned in the README, that Linux is supported by peco. If it is not, then please add that information explicitly in the README and ignore the rest of the issue.

On Ubuntu 16.04 I downloaded the current state of the repo (c93f2e424e5b from Thu Oct 25 23:28:48: "Merge pull request #465 from peco/topic/issue-462"), entered there and typed `make build`. I have go version 1.6.2.

Does anyone knows a solution to this error?

I need peco as a dependency of another project in Julia. I do not know go.
It would be convenient to have an offline documentation, such as a man page. A good start is the output of 
```sh
pandoc -s -f markdown -t man -o peco.1 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peco/peco/master/README.md
```
