I've compiled the source and whenever I try and launch the jar, the error I get says I do not have an ipv4 interface.

Win10, wireless and Ethernet bridged. Functionally, everything is up and running.... just can't get past this error. 

What am I doing wrong that it can't detect my network card(s)?
I watch a code but I don't understand as the package what structure he has is deciphered.
and it still working in pubg?

I have enabled both graph accelerations, make config.useOpenGL3(false, 2,1) to compile with version 2.1 but I still got this error.

Hey, radar is working nicely but i must start it after entering lobby because game not loads (no "initializing" and no "connecting" pop ups in pubg) if i start arpspoof before. Also i have to reset it after every game because it want connect after pressing "exit to lobby". Any fix for it?

Which part should I change? Are BE sig specific part of the code?
