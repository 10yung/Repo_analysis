Hi,

I love the output formatting that better panic provides :)
My application captures backtraces in some flows to print them to the user, but it then resumes operation, so it doesn't "panic" in the normal sense a panic would occur.

I'd like to apply the same formatting style `better-panic` uses when printing the backtraces, but `Settings` only provides a public API to install a panic hook.

Would it be possible to expose some API that you would consider stable for backtraces formatting, something like:
```rust
let settings = Settings::auto();
let formatted_backtrace = settings.format_bt(&bt);
```

Thanks!
Rust testing framework capture output of tests, and release it only if tests is failed, in consistent with other output.

But if i would use better_panic. It prints stacktraces on demand, and in inconsistent with other output form.


This is example of output from real project, where i was trying to install better_panic.

```
The application panicked (crashed).
  explicit panic
in node/src/test/mod.rs, line 576
thread: test::integration::finalized_slashing_with_service_award
test test::integration::finalized_slashing_with_service_award ... FAILED
Backtrace (most recent call first):
  File "node/src/test/mod.rs", line 576, in stegos_node::test::Api::skip_macro_block
  File "node/src/test/integration.rs", line 238, in 
...
```

cargo test output: `test test::integration::finalized_slashing_with_service_award ... FAILED`

Are mixed within better_panic output.

Is it possible to fix?
