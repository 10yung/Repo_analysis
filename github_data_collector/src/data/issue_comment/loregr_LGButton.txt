Can we change `bgColor` property by state like selected or disabled?

Hey team, 

Great stuff, been using your button for a while.

Is it possible to get the button set up so that the text is centered and there is an icon to the left of the text. At the moment the icon is left aligned.

I'm after

[         {Img}TEXT          ]

Do we need to play around with the iconspacing or is there something that does this automatically?

Thank you.
