I'd like to delete columns with fewer than 5 elements and I'm having a bit of a hard time as there is no delete_column() method. This is my code:

```
(1..132).each do |x|
  @yArr =[]
  (1..10).each do |y|
    if @ws[x,y] == ""
      @yArr << 0 
    else
      @yArr << 1
    end
    if @yArr.sum < 5
      @ws.delete_column(x)
      @ws.save
    else
    end
  end
end
```


Feature request: Add support for [shared drives](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7212025?hl=en).  If this is available now, I wasn't able to find documentation for it.

It looks like Team Drive support was added a couple of years ago (https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby/issues/259).  Team Drive has since [been renamed to "Shared Drives."](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/04/shared-drives.html) The [API documentation](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/enable-shareddrives) mentions a `supportsAllDrives` parameter that must be passed along with various requests, which might be the new version of the `supports_team_drives` parameter [added at the time](https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby/commit/3ee8d0e23af047b223cfe3d1855c898f1a5fa143) and still extant in v3.0.3 of the gem.

Thanks!

When proceeding with the setup of credentials, when I do the first step "1. Open this page:", I then click on my profile with which I want to login, then I get this error message... 

Any clue why ? This seems new as I used this gem before.
I'm seeing a bug where my Sheet is losing its frozen row after an insert happens via a call to `insert_rows`
This allows to append data efficiently to an existing spreadsheet
without having to load and submit the whole worksheet every time we
want to add a new row.
I want to get subcollections in a special folder, I have folder id, and I get folder by session.file_by_id, I can see the output as:
"Root Folder Test, https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1FLMKfTaZZ4sXd5TDdEO99W31M, class: GoogleDrive::Collection"
But when I call root_folder.subcollections, it return an empty array, and also I really see a folder called "fastlane" in the folder "test", but I call file_by_title("fastlane") or subcollection_by_title(fastlane), they all return nil.
So how can I get the subfolder?

By the way, my test folder is on the team driver, but I think since I can get folder by id, why I can't get folder by title?
In Google Drive there is an option to add description to files and folders; it helps in searching.
Is there any way to add description to a file on the Drive?
When passing a `Pathname` object to `GoogleDrive::Session.from_config`, it fails since it expects a `Config` object. I suggest instead of check if the object is a string, to check if the object responds to one of the required methods (eg `:client_id`), and if not, treat it as a string. Thanks!
Hi, is it possible to get the sharable link of the file just uploaded using 
`upload_from_file `
then use
`acl.push`
to make it sharable. 

How to get the downloadable link of the file? 

Is it possible to get upload multiple files and make it sharable and also get all the downloadable links?

Note:
_I am using it as a fastlane plugin to upload files and share it after publishing the build_
I am using google_drive gem in my project. 

Included in gem file:
gem "google_drive", "~> 2.0"

I am getting the following error. Please help.
