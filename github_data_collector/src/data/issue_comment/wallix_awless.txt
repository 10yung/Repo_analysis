Hello,

I'm using awless more and more and would like to contribute with small PR's, issue grooming and other tasks that are necessary.

Please let me know if you would like help.

Hi All,

I found awless useful tool but faced that it's not possible to get info about ip addresses which attached to ec2 instance (we have more than 1 eni interface):
```
awless list instances -r ${region} --tag-key ResourceGroup --tag-value whitelister-${vpc} --columns id,zone,name,state,type,publicip,privateip,image
``

Is it possible to get all  ip addresses from EC2?

Hi

I wish there was a convenient way to search for AMI id. I know that can be done somehow with the `aws` cli, but well as usual it's not convenient to say the least !

Best regards,
Hi,

Is there support for EMR ?
If so, how to show EMR clusters ?
This tool is amazing, but I wonder if it's possible to add support for the spot instances?
Hi, I'm Yevgeny Founder of [Fuzzit](https://fuzzit.dev) - Continuous fuzzing as a service platform.

I saw that you implemented Fuzz targets but they are currently not running as part of the CI.

We have a free plan for OSS and I would be happy to contribute a PR if that's interesting.
The PR will include the following
- Continuous Fuzzing of master branch which will generate new corpus and look for new crashes
- Regression on every PR that will run the fuzzers through all the generated corpus and fixed crashes from previous step. This will prevent new or old bugs from crippling into master.

You can see our basic example [here](https://github.com/fuzzitdev/example-go) and you can see and example of in the wild integration [here](https://github.com/google/syzkaller).

Let me know if this is something worth working on.

Cheers,
Yevgeny

Hi guys,

When I tried to display tags that contains space in name, example: "Not tagged"
```
awless ls instances --tag Environment='Not tagged'
No results found.
```
or:
```
awless ls instances --tag-key Environment --tag-value Not tagged
[error]   invalid parameter 'tagged'
```
or
```
awless ls instances --tag-key Environment --tag-value "Not tagged"
[error]   invalid parameter 'tagged'
```

I also try to scape in a lot of unix formats, without sucess.
If someone know how to do this, I will appreciate your help, if not, this can classified as a bug or enhancement.

Regards,

Fernando
Currently listing out all listeners I'm given the following headers:
```
| ID â–² | PROTOCOL | PORT | LOADBALANCER | TARGETGROUPS | ALARMACTIONS |
```
It be great to also add the "Scheme" header. This way we can filter based on either internal or internet-facing
There is a way to auto-assign a dynamic public IP address when creating an instance via the Web UI in AWS or using `--associate-public-ip-address` switch in AWS CLI (`run-instance` manual => https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html)

Is it possible to enable it in awless? It can be done only when the instance is created in AWS. There is no way to associate that dynamic IP after it was launched. Alternative is EIP, but there are different limitations, thus this associate public ip option in my case is preferable and I'd like to use it via awless. 
This WIP PR demonstrates the progress I made in optimizing how containertasks are queried.

I wasn't able to get the `make generate` to generate files that looked anything like the previous ones, and the imports in those generated files had compilation errors, so I think either my environment is missing something, or the project hasn't been updated to the latest stable release of golang.
