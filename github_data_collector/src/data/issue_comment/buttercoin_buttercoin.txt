As a previous member of this development project who was removed without any prior notice. I would love to see an explanation as to why we were all removed.

That coupled with the 23.01259287 BTC currently being held for this project. Which amounts to $ 13,692.49 which I can only see as being stolen by the remaining single developer.

Whilst the money is not an issue, it was designed to pay back the developers for their time and effort. However no remuneration was ever made to developers kicked from the project without any notice.

An explanation would be nice.

When i type npm run gives the following:

When i open localhost:6150 gives "Not implemented", how do i run the application?

It would be nice to have an overview doc of port/ip setting files.

I currently have a hard time to find the correct NODE and NPM versions per OS.

It would be nice if this where mentioned in the docs.

Step by step how to install it  ? How do I do.

Hello,
I have tried to deploy Buttercoin on Debian and starting from npm test, I am seeing the following issues. What I would like to know is whether it is worth the time to look at the code myself and try to figure it out. (I have very little experience with node.js).
There is nothing on localhost:3000. I tried localhost:3001, localhost:3002, localhost:6151 and 6152 which has the sign "not implemented".
Thanks a lot!
Zarni

It looks like a working build of buttercoin for ubuntu 13.10 should be available, but I'm getting the same errors as everyone else:

> buttercoin@0.0.3 start /home/ubuntu/buttercoin

Can anyone please help to resolve this?
