In distribution I found Python package, I followed the readme file and can import covarep_py package, may I know how to use it? That is, how can I obtain the features with a .wav file? Many thanks in advance.
The executable file of covarep(standalone) which is in the directory 'for redistribution purposes only' is not functioning. I have setup all the prerequisites. When I ran the application, it shows the image for a while and then the application closes.

Also, a suggestion to add atleast one example of the usage of a function.
I'm trying to extract the Sadjadi features in Python 3.7. 
While training a DNN, everything except HPS makes loss nan. The network doesn't learn anything.
Here is the code

```
def sadjadi_feat(audio, fs=8000):
    winl = int(fs*30/1000)
    hop_size = int(fs*10/1000)
    win = hanning(winl)
    corr_win = np.correlate(win, win, 'full')
    
    start=0
    stop=winl
    ind=0
    
    harm = []
    clarity = []
    lperr = []
    hps = []
    
    try:
        while stop<=len(audio):
            seg = audio[start:stop]
            seg = seg*win

            rxx = np.correlate(seg, seg, 'full')/corr_win
            rxx = rxx[~np.isnan(rxx)]

            lmin = round(fs*2/1000)
            lmax = round(fs*16/1000)
            vec = rxx[lmin:lmax]

            maxitmp, positmp = vec.max(0), vec.argmax(0)

            harm.append(np.log10(abs(maxitmp/(rxx[0]-maxitmp))))
            dxx = 0.8*np.sqrt(2*(abs(rxx[0] - rxx)))
            vec = dxx[lmin:lmax]

            minitmp = np.min(vec)
            maxitmp = np.max(vec)

            clarity.append(1-(minitmp/maxitmp))

            a, e = lpc(seg, 12, True)
            e = np.var(e)
            lperr.append(np.log(abs(rxx[0]/e)))

            xspec = fft(seg, 2048)
            xspec = 20*np.log10(abs(xspec[0:1024]))

            lmin = round(2048*62.5/fs)
            lmax = round(2048*500/fs)

            vectmp = np.array([])

            #for kk in range(lmin, lmax):
            #    inds = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]])*kk
            #    s = xspec[inds].sum()
            #    vectmp = np.append(vectmp, [s], axis=0)
            kk = np.array([np.arange(lmin, lmax)])
            hrm = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]])
            inds = (hrm@kk)

            vals = xspec[inds]
            vectmp = np.sum(vals, axis=0)
            hps.append(vectmp.max(0))

            start += hop_size
            stop += hop_size
            ind += 1
        return np.array([np.array(harm).conj().T, np.array(clarity).conj().T, np.array(lperr).conj().T, np.array(hps).conj().T])
    except:
        return []
```

I am trying to set the window and shift ; I believe I could just change the window via the sample rate, but how do i change the shift ? (I'm using /covarep/feature_extraction/COVAREP_feature_extraction.m) 


We are using MATLAB 2017. We got an error at enframe() function. We have also run it in MATLAB 2014. Here it says that enframe() function will not accept double arguments. Please help us out!!
Hi, I'm trying to run COVAREP_feature_extraction.m on octave 4.2.2 but I'm getting an error I don't understand. It breaks on line 127 which is `GCI = gci_sedreams(x,fs,F0med,1); % SEDREAMS GCI detection` under F0/GCI detection.

```
octave:1> warning('off','all');addpath('/home/rosanna/programs/covarep/covarep/');startup;in_dir = '/home/rosanna/data/ongrid/enterface_wav/';sample_rate = 0.01;
octave:2> COVAREP_feature_extraction(in_dir,sample_rate);
Analysing file: ent05p2_s40fe4_1000
error: concatenation operator not implemented for 'matrix' by 'scalar struct' operations
error: called from
    COVAREP_feature_extraction at line 211 column 2
```
and inside glottalsource/gci_sedreams.m I have traced the error to line 117, `[~,PotMaxis]=findpeaks(MeanBasedSignal);`.

With something not being implemented, I wonder if I'm missing a package? Here's the list of what I have installed:
```
octave:1> pkg list
Package Name  | Version | Installation directory
--------------+---------+-----------------------
     control  |   3.0.0 | /usr/share/octave/packages/control-3.0.0

         tsa  |   4.4.5 | /home/rosanna/octave/tsa-4.4.5
```

To get to this point, I had to remove 'getReport()':
```
    error: 'getReport' undefined near line 210 column 68
    error: called from
        COVAREP_feature_extraction at line 210 column 9
```
I changed
`        warning(['An error occurred while analysing ' basename ': ' getReport(err)])`
to
`        warning(['An error occurred while analysing ' basename ': ' err]);`
So perhaps that's affected the error message I receive?

But also I had to remove external/backcompatibility_2015/audioread.m for this to run else I had the same error as above but at line 104 instead, when reading the audio `[x,fs]=audioread([in_dir filesep basename '.wav']);`: 
```
error: concatenation operator not implemented for 'matrix' by 'scalar struct' operations
error: called from
    COVAREP_feature_extraction at line 211 column 2
```
I have tried with different audio files (from different datasets) but I have the same error at the same point.
Thanks for any help you can give me!
line 150 in COVAREP_feature_extraction.m looks strange to me:
`srh_f0(srh_f0==0) = 100;`

Shouldn't it be something like:
`srh_f0(srh_f0 < F0min) = F0min;`

`F0min` is set to 50 in COVAREP_feature_extraction
