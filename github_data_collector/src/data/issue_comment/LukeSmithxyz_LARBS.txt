Hey Larbs,

Love using this script for my machines but being new to linux - I tried changing my shell to bash through the proper terminal commant for my user - however it seems this breaks larbs shortcuts and such as on a reboot larbs begins to have a gray screen set and many functions and shortcuts stop working. When I revert the shell from bash to the original zsh everything comes back again. What is the proper procedure for changing the shell to bash in LARBS beside just the usual terminal command?

Thanks!
I opened this issue on voidrice due to st crashing:
https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/issues/450
But this is really a LARBS issue. Without emojione and/or symbola there is currently no way to prevent st from crashing and thereby forcing a new LARBS user to find a solution. The LARBS system as a whole (at least the i3 version) also makes heavy use of emojis. So without proper emoji font coverage breakage can be expected. LARBS users can try the workaround at the linked issue, but this really needs to be fixed in LARBS.
Newbie question admittedly, but in _A Friendly Guide to LARBS!_ it says that some of the customization binds for dwm are in ~/repos/dwm/config.h but there is no repos folder. Was it moved somewhere else?
Arch user here. Certain packages (`dunst`, `xset`,`notify-send`,..?) were not installed correctly by `LARBS`. As a result, X server failed to launch and user could not login properly. This is due to unknown trust arch signature -- see [this issue](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/65054). More precisely, to resolve the problem I used `pacman-key --refresh-keys` and ran `LARBS.sh` again.

I was fortunate, since I caught that error while installing `vim`. Without it, I would not have been able to solve it. I strongly suggested `LARBS` to send a warning while certain packages are not installing correctly. 
It seems that when typing in f I do get the right selection prompt and on typing in a number plus enter there is no error. But no browser is opened.
Hi Luke, thank you first for your fantastic work! It makes my life with all settings so much easier. 

On my newly installed larbs it seems that the `dmenu` is not working. With `Mod+d`, `Mod+X` and `Mod+Shift+e` the menu closes if I press any key. I've previously installed `i3` without larbs and the dmenu was working. I'm wondering if it could be due to the fact that I have a Chinese keyboard layout?
Hi Luke, 

Do you plan on adding BSPWM as an option in LARBS? Look forward to trying out the fib tiling of BSPWM. Thanks for all your upkeep of this system.


DWM is consistently seen using 30% of a core on my ThinkPad Edge 0578 with an i3 CPU.
i have two volume controller on my dwmblokcs ...

I tried a few times to install LARBS (first dwm but i3 for a few times, too) and everytime I had this error. It's not something unfixable but I guess you might want to know it. Maybe sth is missing or it's just me who missed some crucial part to make your vim config working like a charm from the begining.

I'm still kind of a newbie with vim, so if you need, just tell me what else should I report here. Some logs or sth.
From what I know, in `:scriptnames` there should be plug.vim listed, but it isn't.
