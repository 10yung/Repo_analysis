This PR fixes some erroneous and non-exhaustive type definitions for the bech32 package.

* The return type of `decode`, `fromWords` and `toWords` is an array (`number[]`) as seen in the source code of the package: https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bech32/blob/b1845b87ed37f0e4e0cec8efaab505ad996fa556/index.js#L94 and https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bech32/blob/b1845b87ed37f0e4e0cec8efaab505ad996fa556/index.js#L127, _not_ `Buffer`.
* The parameter for `fromWords`, `toWords` and `encode` does actually not have to be a `Buffer`, rather `ArrayLike`, i.e: https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bech32/blob/b1845b87ed37f0e4e0cec8efaab505ad996fa556/index.js#L52
