These version specifications were necessary to get the simulator working
I am having issue when I tried to build the executable buy running
sbt assembly

The error message is : "sbt.librarymanagement.ResolveException: unresolved dependency:"
Do you have a fix for this?


I try to throw my data directly into Kafka but it seems like there are some bugs with that.

Now: 2015-07-12T14:02:31.332, Events:60000, Rate: 4401 epsJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: INFO: os::commit_memory(0x00000006c9000000, 830472192, 0) failed; error='Cannot allocate memory' (errno=12)

There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue.
 Native memory allocation (mmap) failed to map 830472192 bytes for committing reserved memory.
 An error report file with more information is saved as:
 /home/ubuntu/eventsim/hs_err_pid3267.log
ubuntu@ip-172-31-1-10:~/eventsim$ rm hs_err_pid3267.log 

I'm trying to simulate a live feed of event data to Kafka.  I tried running with the following config, following the example of [this](https://github.com/confluentinc/demos/blob/master/eventsimdemo/starteventsim.sh) Confluent demo:

```
bin/eventsim -c "examples/example-config.json" /
-start-time "`date +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"`" /
--end-time "2016-05-18T17:00:00" --nusers 2000 /
--kafkaBrokerList broker1:9092 --kafkaTopic eventsim /
--continuous
```

Which provides the output "starting to generate events," but no messages are being published.  Publishing simulated historical data (i.e. with a past start and end time) to Kafka all at once works fine.  Could you add an example to the documentation about how to start a real time simulated event stream?

Some bug fixes downstream, plus Avro support
