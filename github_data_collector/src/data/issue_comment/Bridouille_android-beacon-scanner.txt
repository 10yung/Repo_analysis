I actually have multiple beacon with the same UUID, major and minor for some reason, but at the end and only 1 ibeacon was scanned (I can scan the other beacon using some other apps). I also found that the bluetooth address is missing, maybe that's the source of the error.

Below is the screen shot of the app

(idk why I can't rotate that)




changed getStaeFromAdapterState to getStateFromAdapterState
For example, I have 2 iBeacon devices. I want to detect them in two separate panels. Thanks!

Hi,

Could you consider adding support for Estimote telemetry packets as described here : https://github.com/Estimote/estimote-specs/blob/master/estimote-telemetry.js ?

I did one Android app about 4 years ago but I'm struggling at implementing this myself. I found this doc which might help https://estimote.github.io/Android-SDK/JavaDocs/com/estimote/sdk/telemetry/EstimoteTelemetry.html

Hi,

Since this app is Apache v2 licensed, are you considering the fact to add it to [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)? There is a strong community behind, that do not use Google Play nor anything else, except F-Droid.

You can find some documentation [here](https://f-droid.org/docs/).

Otherwise, if you don't want to work on the inclusion of this app by yourself, would it be ok for you if someone else do it for you?
