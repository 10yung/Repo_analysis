Hi,
I am new to object tracking and aiming to develop a multi-object tracker. I came to know about VOT dataset but I am unable to download the dataset and I don't understand the use of this toolkit.

 **I request you to help me with how to download a dataset? How to evaluate a tracker model?**

I successfully integrated tracker written in MATLAB,
tracker_label = 'NCC';
tracker_command = generate_matlab_command('ncc.', {'vot-toolkit-master/tracker/examples/matlab/'});
tracker_interpreter = 'matlab';

after that, I tested integrating tracker written in python and failed.It's always stays in 'testing TraX protocol support for tracker ncc',and it no result. 
tracker_label = ['NCC'];
tracker_command = generate_python_command('python_ncc', {'H:\dataset\vot-toolkit-python\vot-toolkit-master\tracker\examples\python\'});
tracker_interpreter = 'python';

Later I saw some solutions in website, and changed the code
tracker_label = ['NCC'];
tracker_command = generate_python_command('python_ncc', {'H:\dataset\vot-toolkit-python\vot-toolkit-master\tracker\examples\python\','H:\dataset\vot-toolkit-python\vot-toolkit-master\native\trax\support\python\'});
tracker_interpreter = 'python';
tracker_linkpath = {'H:\dataset\vot-toolkit-python\vot-toolkit-master\native\trax\build\'};

After that the results also remain the same... And I find some solutions use the libtrax.so, while I can't get it on windows...

I don't know how to solve the problems...anyone encounter this problem?Must I use it in on Ubuntu?
I use VOT-2017 with ECO tracker in MATLAB 2018a

this is from the matlab

this is from VOT-Integration ECO logs

'The file name or URL argument must be a character vector.'

How to fix this? I already change the timeout but it's same..

Thankyou

During the "_Verifying native components ..._" step while running `workspace_create` or `run_test`,  I get the error: `undefined reference to __imp_WSACleanup` from `vot-toolkit\native\trax\src\message.c`.

After some searching, I borrowed from the solution to [this issue](https://github.com/open62541/open62541/issues/1734) and changed `vot-toolkit\utilities\compile_mex.m` (around line 45) from

```
    if is_octave()
        arguments{end+1} = '-DOCTAVE';
    else
        arguments{end+1} = '-lut';
    end
```
to
```
    if is_octave()
        arguments{end+1} = '-DOCTAVE';
        arguments{end+1} = '-lws2_32';
    else
        arguments{end+1} = '-lut';
    end
```

and it worked for me.

Could this be included in the toolkit?

**System**
Windows 10
Octave v5.1.0 configured for x86_64-w64-ming32
VOT toolkit 7.0.2
Trax 2.0.1
I've tried to run the plot program with the official toolkit under Octave and got the following image.
![ours](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32362315/59271539-9aac4c00-8c86-11e9-8307-4eb9c0f5e1ce.png)
However, this is very different from what we see in those publications (e.g. VOT2018 report as follows). 
![20190611202400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32362315/59271728-eb23a980-8c86-11e9-895c-bc66b7f37f85.jpg)
May I have any feasible solution w.r.t. this issue? Thanks in advance.

When I submit my source code to VOT, I always receive the error of "502 Bad Gateway ". I have try 4 times.

Hello~
I met a problem about RGBT running. When the tracker lost target, the log print the following information:

```

Toolkit break sometime after this. And sometime not. When re-run `run_experiment.m`, toolkit can run normally again.  However there is no wrong information in log file. When I compare this to log information in short-term tracking challenge, 'Nonetype' will not show in log file of short-term  tracking when tracker lost target. Is there any problem with RGBT data generation? 
Hello, I am having such a problem. When I run the RGBT run_experiments file, the previous sequences can be executed normally. However, there will be an error in the subsequent sequence, so I will take these sequences to the run_test file and find that they can be executed normally. So I suspect that the problem may be in the test. For frames that fail to track the judgment, the vot-toolkit may have some mechanism that I don't understand that causes the error. I hope you can help me find some solutions.
