Hi There,

Can i request to get latest update for docker image to be use in raspberry pi 4 ?

Try to build, and rebuild since 3 days, can't get it right at all
<!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

**What is the issue or idea you have?**

A demand

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**

**What is the expected behavior?**

**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**

**Please run `stf doctor` and paste the output here.**

When I resize the window, element inside Info tab auto fit the panel
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25640067/71869798-f7e97c80-3145-11ea-8bc1-13002ffddbb5.png)
But when I resize the streaming panel, element inside Info tab does not auto fit the panel
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25640067/71869817-10599700-3146-11ea-8d1d-d5f30b8746f5.png)

**What is the issue or idea you have?**

In some devices after rebooting it, a small tab pops to choose what kind of data transfer to allow.
After this happen STF fails to added the device to it's connected devices, and device remains disconnected until I manually choose from the pop up window. 

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**

oppo a5s, android version 8.0.1 product:CPH1909 model:CPH1909 device:CPH1909

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**

connect device to stf
reboot
screen will pop

**What is the expected behavior?**

I would expect STF to be able to handle this screen and connect to the device.


**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**

**Please run `stf doctor` and paste the output here.**

![Screenshot_2019-02-10-22-53-01-85](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40754606/71826466-aa6a0280-30a6-11ea-99fe-07188c536840.jpg)

I have a weird device. It is old and unsupported by the NDK. It uses a mips processor (I can hear the groans from here).

```
$ adb devices -l

Out of the box STF tries to load to the device the minicap exe and lib for the alternate abi `armeabi--v7a` but it fails to load the prebuilt:

```

I have hacked a custom build of libjpeg-turbo and minicap for mips by naively adding the arch to the Application.mk files and adding the appropriate targets.

Testing minicap with autosize "seems" to work from the command line. To use it, I copied the bin and lib files into the prebuilt directory in source. In doing this I created the required directory structure. It seems to work great. STF recognizes the device, the arch, and the android version and injects my custom minicap and lib.

STF itself crashes sometimes at this point. If it does not crash, it is unable to show the screencap in the UI. Control buttons for orientation and display on/off work so the agent has some functionality.

When STF crashes it gives me this error:
