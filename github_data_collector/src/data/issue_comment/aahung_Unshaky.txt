I'll bet you never thought of this. Neither did I.

We use a physical token key generator at work. Apparently it 'types' very fast, less than 7 milliseconds. I would like to be able to disable Unshaky during the token generation and re-enable it afterward. I envision this as a menu item that toggles between `Disable` and `Enable`. Perhaps a then I could assign a global OS-wide key command for it.

**Describe the bug**
Unshaky appears to have stopped working. It shows a static number of shaky keypresses stopped, and the debug window is empty. 

I am on OSX 10.13.6. I was on Unshaky 0.5.4, and just updated to 0.6. The same issue remains. What's odd is that even though I thought I completely uninstalled Unshaky, it remembered my preferences, so there must be something I missed. I tried restarting and sleeping the mac, but no joy. 

Help please! :)

When configuring Unshaky on macOS Catalina Beta [10.15 Beta (19A526h)], the checkbox to allow accessibility access for Unshaky in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Accessibility ('Allow the apps below to control your computer') cannot be marked to grant accessibility control permissions.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Unshaky.app for the first time and acknowledge the message about granting accessibility permissions.
2. The System Preference pane for Security & Privacy -> Accessibility opens.
3. Trying to tick the checkbox for Unshaky.app to grant permissions has no effect (checkbox does not 'tick') and permissions are not granted for Unshaky.
4. Re-opening Unshaky results in the notification about permissions, confirming that permissions were not granted. Unshaky cannot operate as a result.

Workaround:
1. In the System Preference pane for Security & Privacy -> Accessibility, select Unshaky.app from the list and click the "-" button to remove the app from the list.
2. Click the "+" button to browse for a new app to add to the list.
3. Navigate to the install location for Unshaky (/Applications in my case) and select Unshaky to be added back to the list of apps.
4. After selecting Unshaky from the browse window and adding it back to the list, the checkbox for granting permissions is properly 'ticked'.
5. Unshaky works as expected after following these workaround steps (this resolved the issue for me).

It seems like the issue happened when Unshaky populated itself in the System Preference pane for Security & Privacy -> Accessibility apps list. Manually removing and adding the app back worked without issues.

Not sure if this is an issue with Unshaky or macOS Catalina Beta, but since the other checkboxes  for other apps worked without issue I thought it was worth filing a bug.

Unshaky is working great to address the key doubling issues I'm having on my MacBook Pro 15,1 (2018). I've already taken advantage of the keyboard service program and the issues still persist for certain keys, so Unshaky is a godsend.

**Describe the bug**
When a key is configured with a timeout, it delays the key down event until key up

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Set up a key delay (space bar in my case)
2. Press the space bar key, wait momentarily and then release
3. You'll notice that the space doesn't show up until the key is released

It's hard to time exactly right, but I notice that I end up `typinga lotl iket his` no matter what the configured debounce timeout is

**Expected behavior**
If it's not within the double press window, don't delay the key down event

I use this app from a  long time now and I  just noticed (maybe from the last update) that after a few minutes Unshaky stop working. The app is still running but I still have the  keyboard problems and the debug  window do not display anything. I was able to make it work again after using Onyx but again, still not working after a few minutes. No idea if it's coming  from my  mac or the app.
PS: sorry  for the  double spaces but without Unshaky this butterfly keyboard is a nightmare...

I use [Punto Switcher](https://yandex.ru/soft/punto/) because I have 2 keyboard layouts. This application helps me by hotkey change keyboard layout of the latest word, like from en to ru and otherwise. Very convenient if you forgot to change the layout. I have 60ms in Unshaky for spacebar and it deletes spacebar after when I'm using Punto. Only spacebar, with others everything is fine. It's not a big deal, but I always have to add additional spacebar, that's so annoying. 

**To Reproduce**
1. Set ms in Unshaky for the space bar
2. Install Punto Switcher
3. Write the word with the spacebar after
4. Hit the punto's hotkey

Dash sometimes relies on sending keystroke events repeatedly when expanding snippets. These events are only backspaces and arrow keys.

When these events happen, the pasteboard has the "org.nspasteboard.TransientType" maker (see http://nspasteboard.org). Could you maybe check the pasteboard for this marker and disable Unshaky temporarily while that marker is present? 

Alternatively, could you think of any way I could prevent Unshaky from dropping my events? Or maybe just check if Dash is installed and show a warning that Dash snippet expansion might not work when the user enables Unshaky for the arrow and/or backspace keys.
