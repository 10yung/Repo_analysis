Hi team. I'm facing this problem with Win10+IE11 with German Umlauts ("äöü" for example).

This is my simple HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head lang="en">
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Structure Editor</title>
</head>

<body>
  <button id="copy-button" data-clipboard-text="Copied: großen" title="Click to copy me.">Copy text</button>
  <br><br>
  <button id="copy-button-html" data-clipboard-text="Copied: gro&szlig;en with html" title="Click to copy me.">Copy text with html</button>

  <script src="ZeroClipboard.js"></script>
  <script>
    new ZeroClipboard(document.getElementById("copy-button"));
    new ZeroClipboard(document.getElementById("copy-button-html"));
  </script>
</body>

</html>

```

I took some print-screens that illustrates the problem.

The `Preview` tab seems ok but the `Text` one shows the text with the problem.

Do you know if there is anything I can do? Maybe a setting is missing or something.

Thanks a lot!

Hey, I noticed that zeroclipboard gets 1M hits per month on jsDelivr, so I thought you might like this badge.
Hello, I've been asked not to use a button but a link. Or just text in a span to show copy to clipboard. Is there any documentation on this?  Basically I am adding this to a list of links which various actions and we'd like to keep it uniformed.  So far nothing I've tried within the <li><li> will work. 
Hi Team,

           Good Evening. The existing code, which was working previously was not working after upgrade of chrome but the same code works fine for the IE. Here is the sample code.

Kindly suggest where it is going wrong?? ..


if (this.oClipboard)
			this.oClipboard.destroy();

		this.oClipboard = new ZeroClipboard(this.oCopyLinkButton.getDomRef());

		this.oClipboard.on("ready", function(readyEvent)
		{
			that.oClipboard.on("error", function(e)
			{
				alert(e);
			});

			that.oClipboard.on("copy", function(e)
			{
				alert("copy called");
				that.oClipboard.setText(that.currentURL);
			});

			that.oClipboard.on("aftercopy", function(event)
			{
				alert("aftercopy called");
				that.oCopyLinkDoneNotif.open();
				setTimeout(function()
				{
					that.oCopyLinkDoneNotif.close(false);
				}, 2000);

			});
		});

Thanks,
Geetha Rani.
when i import this file in .vue, there are many wrong because of eslint.
when i use it through script, the browser got ZeroClipbard is not defined....
i use the demo but it failed
```
<button id="copy-button" data-clipboard-text="Copy Me!" title="Click to copy me.">Copy to Clipboard</button>
<script type="text/javascript">
            var client = new ZeroClipboard( document.getElementById("copy-button") );

            client.on( "ready", function( readyEvent ) {
              // alert( "ZeroClipboard SWF is ready!" );
              client.on( "copy", function( event ) {
                console.info(44444)
              });
              client.on( "aftercopy", function( event ) {
                // `this` === `client`
                // `event.target` === the element that was clicked
                event.target.style.display = "none";
                alert("Copied text to clipboard: " + event.data["text/plain"] );
              } );
            } );
        </script>
```

version ios 10.12.5
Tools to detect automatic accessibility errors show an error on zeroclipboard.

As this element don't provide any content, the best way is to remove the element from the accessibility tree.
As much as revitalizing ZeroClipboard was a major passion project for me, I no longer have any reasonable amount of spare time to devote to it.  :cry:

As such, I wanted to put out a much-belated request for interested parties to become new/additional maintainers/collaborators for the project.  If you are interested, please express your interest here as well as providing me with some background info on your experience in open source project management, JavaScript, and Flash/Flex.

Top of the list for TODOs for whomever can take up the mantle would be to tackle the intended `2.4.0` release [milestone work](https://github.com/zeroclipboard/zeroclipboard/milestone/10), mainly to get #171 taken care of (finally) by reviewing @hallvors's PR #650, updating it as needed, testing it, etc., and getting it merged.

I wish I could do more but my current home, work, and life situations are a bit overwhelming on their own without trying to also add in management of a rather large open source project.  :skull_and_crossbones:
