I compiled the binary successfully，but when I wanna start just like“./build/release/scylla”，
there is a problem:ERROR [shard 0] init - Could not read configuration file conf/scylla.yaml: YAML::TypedBadConversion<seastar::basic_sstring<char, unsigned int, 15u, true> > (yaml-cpp: error at line 25361973, column 24577: bad conversion)
[shard 0] seastar - Exiting on unhandled exception: YAML::TypedBadConversion<seastar::basic_sstring<char, unsigned int, 15u, true> > (yaml-cpp: error at line 25361973, column 24577: bad conversion)
So tell me how to get over it......
I see the manual，./configure.py --mode=release --with=pedis，but there will be a problem：
Configure scylla: error: argument --with: invalid choice: 'pedis' (choose from 'scylla', 'iotune')
which means that the binary scylla and iotune will be compiled，binary “pedis” cannot produce，so how to get over it？
no ARM64 repo in https://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/scylladb/scylla-3rdparty/，can pedis be compiled successfully on ARM server？
any uds? unix://
Please make zrangebylex and hincrby work too. will be fantastic.
Thank you for the software. 


I tried the following:
git clone git@github.com:fastio/pedis.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
sudo ./install-dependencies.sh
./configure.py --mode=release --with=pedis
ninja-build -j16 # Assuming 16 system threads.
build/release/pedis --max-io-requests 1024 --smp 2

I get following error:

Configure scylla: error: argument --with: invalid choice: 'pedis' (choose from 'scylla', 'iotune')

Can someone help me fix this? Thanks
I tried the following:

1. git clone https://github.com/fastio/pedis.git
2. git config --global url."https://github".insteadOf git://github
3. git submodule update --init --recursive

I get following error:
```
Cloning into 'libdeflate'...
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
fatal: clone of 'git@github.com:scylladb/libdeflate' into submodule path 'libdeflate' failed

```

Can someone help me fix this? Thanks
Any plans on supporting "SELECT" call and the whole concept of database from redis?

Was trying to test pedis against the redis test suite.. thats where it came up

Feels like it would be easy to implement.. I mean we can just add the database number as suffix to the keyspace names.. 

I don't mind getting this done.. if there is no objection to this.

Hello, i can use Pedis on Redis 3.8 or Redis 5.0 ?
