This relates to #270 (before we can create we should first be able to show that we created)
[The consensus was to split the authentication piece out](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/chapter/issues/110#issuecomment-566281560) authenication from the RSVP issues(#110 and #278) 

The API / code issue was split to #305.
[The consensus was to split the authentication piece out](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/chapter/issues/110#issuecomment-566281560) of #110 and #278, which are mainly focused on the RSVP transaction, into their own UI and API issues.

Authentication is not specific to the RSVP transaction and the auth conversation could easily get lost in the RSVP issues, which is another reason for the split to more granular issues.

This user story says "as a user", but the expectation is we cover authentication for all user roles: user, admin, organizer.


- GET `/chapters` to list all chaptes is missing
- remove `id` from POST `/chaptes`

Separate events from chapters
Create a route in swagger.json file: GET /events to fetch all the events of an organization. 

More routes can be added as we develop and find needs for them. 
Create a `user_roles` table with `id` and `type` as string and reference the `id` of `user_roles` via `users` table.
