Hi @dylanaraps,

I've fixed a bug in lines() by setting the lines variable to 0 as it was incrementing the number of lines if you call lines multiple times.

For example:

`$ lines /path/to/file.txt`
`$ 100`
`$ lines /path/to/file.txt`
`$ 200`
 
Just found this and the bash version

neither seem to have sections on using or dealing with the exit / error codes?

ie 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status
and
http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html

any ideas
Currently, functions that need noglob set, always unset it before leaving the function, which can be problematic if it was set outside the function. This would fix that so that the noglob state is *maintained* in the caller.
