Adds validation to some maestro's cards that were missing
I have simple form that validates CVC and card number and I am checking on click:
`console.log(Payment.formatCardCVC(CVCIn.val()));return;`, For the first tie when I press the button it works, but if I change the input and press again, I am getting this error:

> card-validation.js?ver=1:749 Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
    at Function.QJ.on (card-validation.js?ver=1:749)
Hello,
I just added Troy support.
Thanks.
Add prefix 5078 for maestro cards
Hi, can you add support for Troy credit cards ?

Troy credit card patterns : /^(?:9792|65\d{2}|36|2205)\d{12}$ /
Hi, I updated the Elo credit card validation pattern. 
( ref: #89 )

We've had a report of incorrect formatting on Diner's Club test cards: recurly/recurly-js#476

The correct formatting would be `3056 930902 5904` (test card number) but the lib currently formats that as ` 3056 9309 0259 04`.
When i copy paste card number from stripe. It is not auto formatted and onload of card number also it is not auto formatting. Please check screenshot

Tried to use cards from this site https://www.freeformatter.com/credit-card-number-generator-validator.html and long JCB and Discover card are cut by the validator.
