Hi everybody,

I am a very big fan of athenapdf, it generates amazing pdf when other renders crash. However, I would really love to get athenapdf working on my raspberryPi. Is there any way how you could provide a docker image which would run on ARM processors. Alternatively, I would really appreciate if you could give me some instructions on how to compile athenapdf on ARM.

Best

As highlighted by issue #201 the demo site is not functioning at the moment. Rather than link to a dead page I'll remove this for now.
I have a tv samsung UHD, with model code: UN40MU6103GXPE, version FB02, for a few months when I use the web browser and watch videos on youtube, within a few seconds of starting to watch the video, the screen goes blank and the message "renderer process has c rashed" and it reloads my website, it used to happen 1 or 2 times and then I could watch my video, but now it happens at every moment, making it impossible to watch the videos on youtube, I want to know how to solve this problem, because I don't think it is due to the internet , I look forward to your help.
http://www.athenapdf.com/ seems to be down.
Add documentation for inline file conversion through the microservice to supplement URL conversion that was already documented.
How can we remove the `/Resources` line from the generated PDF? It prevents us to validate our PDFs with another 3rd party tool and [the line itself is apparently deprecated](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/1683856)

like this issue: https://github.com/arachnys/athenapdf/issues/161
but the issue say this problem has been solved.
What is the reason for this problem?
Can we have a OpenAPI doc or swagger.yml file that documents the API?  Possibly use redoc to create the apidocs
 - Xvfb needs the directory /tmp/.X11-unix/ to be owned by root
 - headless chrome needs a writeable HOME directory
 - enables to run the image for example with "-u 101010:0"
 - the server can be run on OpenShift and K8s clusters with SCC
Hi there,

Is it possible to pass options similar to CLI to REST requests (Eg margins)?

Also, is there any plan to build other options. Eg:

- Custom header / footer
- Paging (could be part of footer)

Thanks,
