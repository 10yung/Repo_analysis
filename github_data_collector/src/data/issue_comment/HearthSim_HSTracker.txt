When hovering over the top player, who is the next person you will play, it doesn't always shows you the board state they had last time you played against them.
In BG, after playing against secret guy, the secret window stays up and never goes away.
Would it be possible to add a galakrond counter similar to the one that is in the PC version? Thank you!
I don't know if this is just me, but since the new expansion I haven't been able to upload my collection to HSReplay. 

It never really felt like it was working properly. Before, I'd have to open the Preferences pane and under the 'Collection Uploads' section I'd have to logout, then log back in. It would then open a browser window and ask if I wanted to open HSTracker. Click OK and then back to Hearthstone and it would upload. Now I just get 'Failed to upload: 104'.  Not sure if there's a workaround or not but just thought I'd post. Thanks.
Just wondering if we can get a Galakrond counter like we have with C'Thun or Pogo. Would be helpful in keeping track.
**Describe the bug**
HSTracker does not show my full deck. DoD cards are missing from the deck at the start of the game. It seems the new cards were added in https://github.com/HearthSim/HSTracker/issues/1093, and I **do** see the cards in the sidebar once they have been drawn. However, the need to be interacted with (drawn, invoked, etc) before they appear. This is using version https://github.com/HearthSim/HSTracker/releases/tag/1.6.10.  

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a deck with DoD cards.
2. Start a standard game.
3. Look at your deck list at the beginning of the game (DoD cards are missing).

**Expected behavior**
I expect the DoD cards to show up in the decklist at the start of the game.

**Screenshots**
This is a screenshot from the end of a game. You can see that my undrawn DoD cards are not listed (yes, I am playing galakrond shaman and yes I feed bad about it :P).

**Version (please complete the following information):**
https://github.com/HearthSim/HSTracker/releases/tag/1.6.10.

**Additional context**
It's unclear if this is some side effect of https://github.com/HearthSim/HSTracker/issues/1088, but my issue seems different than those described in that thread and, in general, HST is working.


Using version 1.6.10, received the following error from hsreplay.net when opening a replay:
The uploaded file is not a valid replay.
['Submitted friendly_player 1 does not match inferred friendly player 2.']
https://hsreplay.net/uploads/upload/A6kp63TFc2XTgREBdAVrUK/?utm_source=hstracker&utm_medium=client&utm_campaign=replay
Please add the DoD cards when you get a chance. TY!
**Describe the bug**
Rather than updating the collection on HSReplay version 1.6.9 on my account completely erased the status of my collection.

**To Reproduce**
1. Update HSTracker via the menu "HSTracker->Check For Updates..."
2. Setup Collection Uploads via "HSReplay" preference pane.
3. Open Hearthstone
4. Open "My Collection"
5. I did get the updated upload confirmation notification 
6. Via web browser got o hsreplay.net and navigate to "My Data -> My Collection".

**Expected behavior**
I would expect the collection upload to remain functional between fix versions.

**Version (please complete the following information):**
1.6.9 

**Additional context**
Reverting back to 1.6.7 will restore the collection on the next upload by following the above steps.

Not much to say, simply won't work.

Also, HSTracker is using up a ton of memory for whatever reason, like 60G.
