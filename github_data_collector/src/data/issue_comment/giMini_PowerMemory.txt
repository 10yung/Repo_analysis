Ran Get-ActiveDirectoryInfo received data back, but ran into Visio error stating "You are trying to save a file type (Visio 2000-2002 Binary Drawings), Templates and Stencils, which has been blocked by your File Block settings in the Trust Center." 

I unchecked every box in Visio File Block settings, tested with Microsoft Active Directory Topology Diagrammer to see if the stencils would load and draw in Visio, which they only did in MS ADTD. For some reason, I am still receiving this error when running the Get-ActiveDirectoryInfo script. 

Just checking to see if anyone has run into this before. 
no found in Empire
can u tell me what is name the moudle
Hi,

I generated a dump of memory from a VM running on an ESXi.
The script runs but the output is:
Login : ?????...?.????.?â”´.??.???????????

Wonder if I am doing something wrong and you experienced similar results in the past.

Thanks.
I started powershell with admin privilege, 

```
. .\PowerMemory.ps1
```

Then select option 1

It looks like a CMD window started and closed, no output

Any ideas?
