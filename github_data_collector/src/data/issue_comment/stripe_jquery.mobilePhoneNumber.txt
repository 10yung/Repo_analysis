my package.json file:

```

Any idea how this could be fixed?
Hi,

I use this script on my project. Thank you for your all, it is really cool. 

I had realized a problem the other day, I can not delete space chars on my mobile devices, once I wrote down the formated phone number.

For instance, I started to write "905", it converts it "+90 5", but after I want to correct my "90" with "1", I can only delete 5, not the space char (since it formatted my numbers as phone number it inserts a space). So I can not change my international country code.

Or when I type "905551" it converts it "+90 555 1", and I can only delete "1" not the space char or "555" chars.

It works on web browsers without any problem, but on my mobile devices, it cause the problem I describe above. Is there any solution?

I tested both with Android 5.0.1 and iPhone 6s.

Thank you from now :)
As written on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_prefix#Countries_using_national_trunk_prefixes), trunk prefixes are removed if we use the country code, otherwise conserved. 

For example, for a french number I will wether write: 06 xx xx xx xx or +33 6 xx xx xx xx. Right, now if I set `allowPhoneWithoutPrefix` to `+33` for example, it'll format as `0 6x xx xx xx xx` which is not what we expect.
seems like the standard jquery 'change' event is not firing
I created a simple form & jquery code as per below.
the change function gets executed for for name field, but not for the phone.
Am I missing something?

 $("#name").change(function(){
        debugger;
        console.log('NAME-CHANGE: VAL:',$("#name").val());
    });

```
$("#phone").change(function(){
    debugger;
    $("#phone").val($.formatMobilePhoneNumber($("#phone").mobilePhoneNumber('val')))
    console.log('PHONE-CHANGE: VAL:',$("#phone").val());
});
```

As a Spanish man, IMO the right Spanish format is `+34 ### ### ###` instead of `+34 ### ## ## ##`, at least for mobile numbers.

In Brazil we had changes from Anatal, now mobile phone numbers have the number 9 before the first digit of mobile phones, but this is no on every city. Only some of brazilian states have this change, and only mobile phone numbers. The landline telephone numbers of all states still with 8 digits .
I dont have idea of what to do about that .
