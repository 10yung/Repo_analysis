This message is the same as what Oracle's image displays, allowing other programs that look for this message to find it making this image compatible with Oracle's.

See https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/blob/8310e137151d93b05b051d91ec3acf6049e3df94/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/dockerfiles/19.3.0/runOracle.sh#L193

An example of something that looks for this message is Spring Session JDBC:
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/blob/2.2.0.RC1/spring-session-jdbc/src/integration-test/java/org/springframework/session/jdbc/DatabaseContainers.java#L161
If an error occurs, stop with an error.

This ensure that unexpected errors stop execution instead of allowing startup to proceed with an unknown/unexpected state.
Since this image does not exist anymore in docker hub, there no need for the 2 instruction to pull the image directly  
Hello guys,
In one of our integration test suite we are using this repository. But suddenly we started seeing errors `Connection refused` while trying to talk to the oracle container. So checked out one of the older commits and everything seems to be working fine again. And it seems like the following commit was causing the issue https://github.com/wnameless/docker-oracle-xe-11g/commit/87f6bea89204bcf5ee64a384b3094ffdde394b7b

Any clue how we can solve this issue ?
Is there a way to change the installation for the oracle client to 64bit instead of 32bit ?

I'm trying to connect to the database using `node-oracledb` but it's not working due to the [32/64] bit mismatch ..

Sorry if the question makes no sense, It's my first time around oracle databases

Thanks in advance
HI Everyone

I'm on mac, docker versions are

Server: Docker Engine - Community
 Engine:
  Version:          18.09.2

Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           18.09.2

I've tried what seems to be every conceivable way of persisting data, using -v, or --mount, but nothing seems to be working.  I think I must be getting the path to where the data exists inside the container wrong or something.

Is persisting data possible with my versions above and this image?  I've got a saved image prior to the image being pulled from docker hub, which was very sad btw, not your fault I know. :-(

Thanks for any tips or suggestions.
Did this get taken off the Docker repos? I'm getting a 404 now, and "docker pull wnameless/oracle-xe-11g" isn't working.
I have a script that is generated through utf-8 format. I added it in /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/. 
Scripts is executed but data are not in UTF-8 .

Please can anyone help me to solve this issue.

Thanks in advance.
