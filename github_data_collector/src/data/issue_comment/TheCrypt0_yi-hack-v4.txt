Thanks for the great work on this firmware. I have a yi_home_1080p camera, firmware version 0.2.0
with RTSP enabled and working fine. I'm not able to get the timestamp embedded in the video feed. Is embedding the current time possible with this firmware?
I`ve installed yi-hack-v4 successfully. 
Settings for Micro SD card is not present on Yi Home App settings page, in config Recording without Cloud is turned on.
My cam is model **8FUSY04WJZ.**

Also, is there a way to make a selection for type of the interface used, WiFi or Ethernet...?

When on Wifi MAC is 0C:xx:xx:xx:xx:x, on ETH MAC is D2:xx:xx:xx:xx:x (xx is the same MAC address on both port), 
Different IP address were used by camera 192.168.1.13 for WiFi, 192.168.1.14 for ETH, depending what type of interface is used.
WiFi is made by SHENZHEN BILIAN ELECTRONIC CO.LTD, ETH module is unknown.

Thanks

Hi, is it possible connect YI HOME camera (with yi-hack-v4) to MI (Xiaomi) HOME app instead to YI Home app? Thank you for your response.
It would be nice to be able to switch off the blue led. This hack had it: https://github.com/fritz-smh/yi-hack
I'm running Hackv4 on a Yi Camera Outdoor with all functions disabled other than the required HTTPD. The cpu loads are typically like so:

4.08 3.31 3.82

Do we have any idea how many cores this device has? Even if it's running on a quad-core (unlikely) the cpu loads seem high for next to no services running. 

With RTSP enabled it's only possible to run the low res encoding, and then the stream is approximately 8seconds delayed. With HQ stream and no low res stream the stream is unavailable.

If I enabled only HTTPD, HD Stream, & MQTT the stream becomes unavailable, the web interface is almost always timesout and nothing is sent to MQTT broker. On the rare occasions that I can get into the web interface it shows cpu load averages of 5+ explains the unresponsiveness.

This unfortunately makes the camera essentially unusable in anything but a very basic low res delayed feed. 

With just SD Stream & HTTPD running - nothing else & cloud disabled I'm seeing cpu loads of 5+:
5.43 5.26 5.18

Is this a known issue? Any suggestions for making performance better?
Dears, is any of the versions applicable to EU version of YI Home (2) Camera?

I've tried 1080p version, yet not firmware upgrade whatsoever, as checked, filenames shall differ (e.g. _y203c suffix instead of _20)

Current firmware version I have is 2.1.1_20171024...
After installing yi-hack-v4 I get the rtsp: // stream: @ xxx.xxx.x.xx / ch0_0.h264 but it is very unstable (many breaks). Are there other recoverable and perhaps more stable flows.
Using this with yi_cloud_dome_1080p - after a few days rstp fails and I have to restart. Anyone else have this issue? Txs
Hopefully somebody here can help me I'm trying to connect my Yi 1080p outdoor camera to my Annke DVR (DN81R) using the rtsp feed but when I try to connect it never works. I've tried everything I can think of and have spent countless hours trying to get this work. Ive tried entering the RTSP feed into the DVR as many different ways as I could think of. (rtsp://192.168.1.133/ch0_0.h264 , rtsp://192.168.1.133, 192.168.1.133, 192.168.1.133/ch0_0.h264, etc.) The rtsp feed works just fine on VLC and also on Blue Iris no problem. I've included screen shots of my DVR setup screen as well as the VLC screen showing it works as well as BI screens...just cannot figure out how to get it to work on the DVR! :( Hopefully some one can help me. I HAVE had this work in the past, though on a different brand (cheap) Chinese cam. This one is [supposedly] a little more high end than the previous ... so I'm really just hoping there's a setting I've missed some where or a simple fix exists ... any help will be greatly appreciated!

Is this work with Xiaomi Mi Camera 360ยบ 1080p MJSXJ02CM ?
