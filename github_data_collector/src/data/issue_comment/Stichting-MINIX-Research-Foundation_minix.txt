I don't think much description is needed here to describe what I saw, nonetheless, this is what happened
```

```

Happens at all the tries I did today.

After clone, I see only below folders-- not sure about the rest.
bin/  build.sh*  common/  crypto/  dist/  distrib/  docs/  etc/  external/  LICENSE  Makefile  Makefile.inc

Git status, shows, rest of them are  deleted

Cross compile failure with Debian 10.
The attached static cast corrects the issue and allows Minix 3 to compile successfully.

No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Debian
Description:    Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
Release:        10

Is there any instructions or docs for cross-compile `minix3.1*`?
 The wiki of cross-compile seems like for the `minix3.2` or above


Minix is a great project, I wonder if it is still maintained?Will minix4 be released later?
These changes add bounds checks to prevent potential memory corruption issues and information leaks in several places.

how to slove this error?

Hi I am reading the part of IMPLEMENTATION OF PROCESSES IN MINIX3(Andrew Tanenbaum third edition) and there they mention that all src code is under /usr/src/ directory. I can't find that directory on your repository. Any suggestion?
Steps to reproduce:

```
git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/cking/stress-ng
cd stress-ng
CC=clang gmake clean
CC=clang gmake fast-test-all
```

..leave this to configure, build and run.  Eventually it will crash the kernel.

I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post this issue, but I wanted to bring up this issue as I don't have permissions to edit the corresponding wiki page:

- The [download page](https://wiki.minix3.org/doku.php?id=www:download:start) should be using https links for a urls that use download.minix3.org instead of regular http links.  
- Also, if possible, the downloads should maybe start using SHA256 in addition to MD5 hashes for additional security.

This is stemming from this [google group discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/minix3/Pt8ri0rbJzk) about download file security.

The roadmap shows that someone had been working on Multicore support, but I can't find any details about the progress.  Is there a fork someone can point to, or perhaps some threads about the issues/attempts to do so?

I'd love to see where this stands and possibly help it along.
