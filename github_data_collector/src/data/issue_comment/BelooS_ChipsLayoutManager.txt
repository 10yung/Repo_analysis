isInside() return false cause some item can not display
When there is long text in a chip it should first try to fit width then grow but what's happening is it is going two lines not first trying to fit in the row

itemView gravity center invalid, it seems cause by layout view without measure
We need a max height in RecyclerView, when set layout_height "wrap_content", but how to set max height? Maybe need a property or a method to set.
 .setChildGravity(Gravity.TOP)
Is there any way to invoke such methods?
chipsLayoutManager.getRowOfView(child)
chipsLayoutManager.getColumnOfView(child)

Thanks
I'm confused here.


Someone help with proguard rules
The last view is a EditText, and it have a miniWidth.
