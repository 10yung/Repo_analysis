We need to move the [Plugin Page](https://github.com/errbotio/errbot/wiki) away from the wiki, as its unable to generate the page anymore.

### Possible Alternatives

* Use Github Pages - https://pages.github.com/
* Split page in multiple pages
* Remove it altogether


I'm leaning towards Github Pages.

Since description seems to be read from `@bootcmd` definition and this is not easy to see in the documentation (even the examples don't use it, see https://github.com/errbotio/errbot/blob/master/docs/user_guide/flow_development/basics.rst ) maybe it is better to change this code to not produce an error in the command `flows list` when no description is available.

### Issue description

When in the middle of a flow with auto triggered first_step, if I used the command that triggered the first step. The first step still reruns.
My question is How can I check if a flow from the same user is already running, so I can end it in the above case?

### Steps to reproduce

Flow:
!step_one !steptwo End

step_one is auto triggered and depending on the input from user either end or move to step_two. on step_one just use the same command that triggers step_one again

### Issue description

I'm a happy user of telegram backend. 
Telegram uses a non-mono spaced font so when showing the result for some formatted commands the output is not well formatted (for example status command).
Telegram allows for the use of markdown to indicate mono space fonts (```) but I'm not sure what would be the best way to make this available to errbot.

It would be nice to have this behavior available, at least, for some commands.

When creating a dynamic command plugin that uses the `arg_botcmd` function, there is no obvious way to pass multiple arguments to the Command object as is the case when using the Decorator pattern with mutiple arguments.

This pull request adds a new method `append_args` to the Command object which can take arguments and keywords.  Below is an example of how this code would be used.

```
        Help_Command = Command(
            eg_help,
            name="eg_help",
            cmd_type=arg_botcmd,
            cmd_args=("--topic",),
            cmd_kwargs={"dest": "topic", "type": str},
            doc="Provide example help."
        )
        Help_Command.append_args(("--filter",), {"dest": "filter", "type": str})
        Help_Command.append_args(("--limit",), {"dest": "limit", "type": int})
        Help_Command.append_args(("--offset",), {"dest": "offset", "type": int})

        self.create_dynamic_plugin(
            name="Example_Plugin",
            doc="Example.",
            commands=(Help_Command)
```

### Issue description
I am trying to develop a errbot plugin for which I want to use flows.
I have a simple flow programmed ([files here](https://github.com/errbotio/errbot/files/3711373/err-example.zip)), which is near the example of the [documentation](https://errbot.readthedocs.io/en/6.1.1/user_guide/flow_development/basics.html). Individually the !first, !second and !third commands are running, but the flow won't start. !flows start example returns "Computer says nooo. See logs for details:
Flow example doesn't exist"

### Steps to reproduce

Create an errbot in a virtual enviroment, save the attached files under <errbot-root>/plugins/err-example, start the bot and try the command "!flows start example"

### Additional info
The errbot is connected to a zulip instance and runs with the zulip-connector.
My email-adress is in the BOT_ADMINS list.

### Issue description

SleekXMPP don't connect to ejabberd

### Steps to reproduce

~~~ bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rroemhild/docker-ejabberd/master/examples/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
~~~


Configure errbot

~~~ py
import logging


BACKEND = 'XMPP'  # defaults to XMPP
BOT_DATA_DIR = '/home/user/git/errbot/data_dir'
BOT_EXTRA_PLUGIN_DIR = None
PLUGINS_CALLBACK_ORDER = (None, )
BOT_LOG_FILE = BOT_DATA_DIR + '/err.log'
BOT_LOG_LEVEL = logging.DEBUG
BOT_LOG_SENTRY = False
SENTRY_DSN = ''
SENTRY_LOGLEVEL = BOT_LOG_LEVEL
BOT_IDENTITY = {
    'username': 'admin@example.com',  # The JID of the user you have created for the bot
    'password': 'password4321',       # The corresponding password for this user
    'server': ('127.0.0.1',5222), # server override
}

BOT_ADMINS = ('admin@example.com',)
BOT_ADMINS_NOTIFICATIONS = ('admin@example.com')

DIVERT_TO_PRIVATE = ()
DIVERT_TO_THREAD = ()
CHATROOM_RELAY = {}
REVERSE_CHATROOM_RELAY = {}
~~~

~~~ bash
pipenv install errbot
pipenv run errbot
mkdir data_dir
errbot
~~~ 

### Additional info



This adds a `__magic_all__` option that you can add to either the
`DIVERT_TO_THREAD` or `DIVERT_TO_PRIVATE` configuration options instead of
adding each command individually.


# To Do: 

- [ ] Manually test that this is correct
- [ ] Write Automated Tests? (doesn't look like the test for `core.py` has much there to begin with
- [ ] Documentation updates to reflect changes.

### Issue description

We are using errbot with Slack. My problem is that starting the bot takes a really long time ~5 minutes. Im wondering what could be the cause for the slow start? FYI, our slack environment is huge (~30k members and ~20k channels).

### Steps to reproduce

start the bot, watch the logs. Takes about 5 minutes to start.

### Additional info

If you have any more information, please specify it here.

It adds a LOT of noise in Errbot as the API is way lower level than the previous version (this is basically a pure socket to Slack + json parsing).
