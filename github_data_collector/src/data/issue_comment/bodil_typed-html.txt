First, using this framework has been so pleasant to work with.  It's so nice to be able to compile my views and know they will just work.  I even made a blog post about using typed-html and was in the process of making a second.  However, while playing around with the framework I ran into an issue (see below). 

I know life gets busy and I'm sure it's difficult to maintain OS. With that being, is their anything I can help with on the project that might also make it easier to address issues?  Thanks so much for putting in the time to make typed-html and sharing it with others!

I opened an issue (#89) and made a corresponding PR (#90) to fix the issue.

I'm trying to add `typed-html` support to a [web framework](https://github.com/iamcodemaker/euca) I built and am encountering an issue building a sample app. Everything works fine in debug mode, but release mode builds eat up gigabytes of memory. I'm not sure if this is a problem with `typed-html` or `rustc` but it doesn't happen when not using `typed-html`.

Code is [here](https://github.com/iamcodemaker/euca-counter). Run `wasm-pack build` or `cargo build --release` in the `crate.typed-html` directory to observe the issue. Building with `wasm-pack build --dev` or `cargo build` works fine.
Updates the requirements on [strum](https://github.com/Peternator7/strum) to permit the latest version.

i am trying to add an apple favicon with the following:
```
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-touch-icon.png"/>
```
But I am getting the following error at runtime. 
```
ERROR: <link rel="apple-touch-icon"> failed to parse attribute value: Matching variant not found
ERROR: rebuild with nightly to print source location
thread 'main' panicked at 'failed to parse string literal', src/view.rs:4:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace.
```

From what I understand, it's trying to build a [LinkType](https://docs.rs/typed-html/0.2.1/typed_html/types/enum.LinkType.html) for the `rel` attribute of the [link element](https://docs.rs/typed-html/0.2.1/typed_html/elements/struct.Attrs_link.html#structfield.rel) and since apple-touch-icon isn't a valid variant of `LinkType` it's failing. 

Is there an escape hatch where I can put custom attributes or attribute values so that I can bypass this error?
Hey,

I'm trying to add children to a previously generated Node.
I need this, because I don't yet know how my DOM looks like at compile time.
I thought this would be possible with this code snippet, however it fails:

```rust
#[test]
fn test() {
    use typed_html::dom::{DOMTree, VNode};
    use typed_html::html;

    let mut root: DOMTree<String> = html!(<div></div>);
    let s = "Hello World";
    if let VNode::Element(root) = &mut root.vnode() {
        root.children.push(VNode::Text(s.as_ref()));
    };

    assert_eq!(root.to_string(), "<div>Hello World</div>");
}
```

thread 'test' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
  left: `"<div></div>"`,
 right: `"<div>Hello World</div>"`', ui/main.rs:34:5

I get the same error for non-text nodes.
