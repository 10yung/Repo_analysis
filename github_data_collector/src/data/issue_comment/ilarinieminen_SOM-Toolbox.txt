This fork lets the standard "iris.data" example run under Octave.

Hi,

I start woking with SOM, in order to know what the toolbox is capable to do, I'm running the demo scrpits, using Matlab R2015a. When I was running the second demo, the program stops in the fourth step, and show the message:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40074193/41181002-15d2494a-6b25-11e8-8535-7e07a8e22e4f.png)

actually I'm not very good using Matlab, but so I thought I can deal with the error changing some variables names, but didn't work.

I appreciate if someone can help me with this


Hi,

When I use som_stats to get statistics across clusters, it returns NaN for some clusters, although there are hits in those clusters and would be good to have numbers for them. 
Attached is an example with Iris data.

I tried to correct som_stats by changing row 174 into 
if nargin<2 || isempty(bins) || sum(isnan(bins))>0,
but it does not help.

would appreciate your help with that.

Hey,
I'm despratly needing help with one issue:
But I'm currently using this Toolbox for my masterthesis. The task of my masterthesis is to compare different accurate CO2 sensors for the ocean. Therefor I should creat a neural network and should find out which one is providing more accurate results. The idea is, that one sensor is less expensiv but has an accurancy of +- 5µatm and the other one is more expensiv and works with an accurancy of +-2µatm. I should now determine, if the neural network provids better results when I train it with the double the amount of unaccurate data. My biggest problem is, that I don't know where I can tell the neural network the accurancy of the data that it use to be trained. Maybe someone here knows a function which I need to use to tell MatLab about the accurancy of the Training data. If you know something to help me I would be very very glad! 
I hope you understand my problem and can help me.

Recently, I want to construct a som model using somtoolbox in matlab. I have 350 SST (sea surface temperature) images. Each image is 400 pixels by 480 pixels. And each SST image was transformed into a single row vector by concatenating image rows. So that the input matrix consisted of 350 rows (image) and 192000 columns (pixels). But when I run the following code,some errors occured. Could you please tell me how to solve this problem? Thanks for your consideration.

    imgPath=strcat(path,'\',filename);
    raster=imread(imgPath);
    vector=reshape(raster,1,m*n);
    myMatrix=[myMatrix;vector];
end

Hi everyone:

There is a way to parallelize the som_make or som_batchtrain functions? I want to speed up this functions but I don't have the Parallel Computing Toolbox.

I am trying to get a selection of hits from som map, for this object I use "som_select" function. However, I can't get GUI, i get the next answer:

I have used SOM struct, initial dataset, size of SOM struct, size of initial datasets…but these aren’t successful input arguments…

Somebody know other way to select hits of my SOM, an example o turorial to practice?

thanks

I was wondering how to deal with binary coded input data, when other distance measurement metrics than Euclidean are necessary. Are there any functions supporting e.g. Hamming or Jaccard distance metrics? or: Where can I specify those?

I look forward to receiving any response to decide if I should further use it for my project
Thanks for your support (i am a SOM newbie...forgive me)!

Noticed the following in `som/som_show.m`:

``` matlab
% Set text property 'interp' to 'none' in title texts

set(h_label,'interpreter','none');
```

Would be nice if could switch between standard text interpretation and LaTeX interpretation for component subplot titles.  Made a start on this [here](/willfurnass/SOM-Toolbox/tree/tex_title_interpreting) but having problems with keyword argument parsing - any pointers gratefully received.

Hi,

How do I deal with NaNs in the data?

Thanks!
