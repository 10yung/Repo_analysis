```
    from_hue( degrees )
    
    Sets the base color hue, where 'degrees' is an integer. (Values greater than
    359 and less than 0 wrap back around the wheel.)
    
    The default base hue is 0, or bright red.

Thanks for this library! I'd like to use it for a project that is using Web Workers. However, currently, it throws an error when it is loaded due to a reference to `window`, which isn't available in a Web Worker. Replacing this with `self`, which is available in both the main browser thread and Web Workers, fixes the issue and the library works perfectly!
Hi, 

I'm assuming that hue should be an int between 0-255 and distance a float between 0 and 1.
Given that, I've experienced the following error with various combinations of hue and distance:

```
TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined
    at mutablecolor.ColorScheme.mutablecolor.mutablecolor.set_hue (../color-scheme/lib/color-scheme.js:505:49)
    at mutablecolor.ColorScheme.mutablecolor.mutablecolor.rotate (../color-scheme/lib/color-scheme.js:514:21)
    at Object.dispatch.triade (../color-scheme/lib/color-scheme.js:107:31)
    at ColorScheme.colors (../color-scheme/lib/color-scheme.js:134:31)
```

hue 170 and distance 0.16 will throw this error. This will list out some of the values:

```
/*jslint node:true, multistr: true */
'use strict';

var ColorScheme = require('color-scheme');

for(let hue = 0; hue < 256; hue++) {
  for(let dist = 0.0; dist < 1.0; dist+=0.01) {
    // try {
      let scheme = new ColorScheme();
      scheme.from_hue(hue)
        .scheme('triade')
        .variation('hard')
        .distance(dist);

      let colors = scheme.colors();
    } catch(err) {
      console.log(hue, dist, err);
    }
  }
}

```

Did I misunderstand something in the use of your library?
