**Describe the bug**
Within the last few builds / updates sign in is taking a very very long time.

**To Reproduce**
Sign in or return to ombi after being somewhere else.

**Expected behavior**
Sign in has never been very fast but one of my scripts that signs in with username and password stopped working once it started taking longer than 30 seconds.

**Screenshots**
Nothing to show

**Describe the bug**
I am trying to follow the process outlined in https://github.com/tidusjar/Ombi/wiki/Update-Settings.
I am currently on v3.0.3988
When following the guide, it mentions database.json which I cannot locate.
Once I follow the guide and start up ombi again, I keep getting an error message and none of my requests/search is shown. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. stopped process running in windows
2. deleted contents of Ombi directory except for Ombi.db & OmbiExternal.db & OmbiSettings.db
3. extracted and copied contents of 3.0.4892 zip into Ombi directory 
4. copied Ombi.db & OmbiExternal.db & OmbiSettings.db into folder
5. ran ombi.exe

**Expected behavior**
For the update to be successful and for me to be on the latest version

**Describe the bug**
Use TVDBID in search.

Can you point me to where I could make a PR that would take a token like "tvdbid=1232" as a search criteria and then it goes out to the tvdb api and pulls the name, passes that to tvmaze, if tvmaze doesnt have the tvdbdid external it uses the one from the tvdb api?  Its kinda hacky but figured it would be a quicker pr then to do a whole tvmaze replace.

**To Reproduce**
None - Help request

**Expected behavior**
Search for shows via tvdbid/api instead of tvmaze

Mellow - https://github.com/Cloudbox/Community/wiki/Mellow-Discord-Bot

The bot connects to Ombi and everything works apart from the confirmation response from Ombi to Mellow. The Mellow DEVs have advised that this issue seems to be Ombi related hence me logging it.

The Ombi logs details the following

**Describe the bug**
Ombi v4 running in a docker container reports the following error:

{"error":"The SPA default page middleware could not return the default page '/index.html' because it was not found, and no other middleware handled the request.\nYour application is running in Production mode, so make sure it has been published, or that you have built your SPA manually.

The same issue seems to be affecting the demo: app.ombi.io

Docker container log shows the call stack:

Something bad happened, ErrorMiddleware caught this
System.InvalidOperationException: The SPA default page middleware could not return the default page '/index.html' because it was not found, and no other middleware handled the request.

**Additional context**
Same issue as #3139 which is currently in a 'Closed' state.

**Describe the bug**
I have a weekly newsletter that recently (last month or so) stopped including any movies. The 'Movies' section is not present. New TV shows are still being shown. 
I have added new movies and Ombi is able to see those movies as present in Plex.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Add new movies to Plex
2. Run newsletter cron job (Sending a test newsletter does show a sampling of already existing movies)
3. Movies are not displayed


**Expected behavior**
Movies should be displayed when enabled in the newsletter configuration

I noticed an interesting log message around the time the newsletter is being generated:
`2020-01-11 09:04:19.180 -07:00 [Error] StatusCode: NotFound, Reason: Not Found, RequestUri: http://api.themoviedb.org/3/tv/?api_key=b8eabaf5608b88d0298aa189dd90bf00`
repeated a dozen or so times.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Windows 10
 - Plex is on Server 2012 R2 if that matters.
**Ombi Version (please complete the following information):**
 - Version [3.0.4892]
- Media Server [Plex 1.18.4.2171]


Just adding the `RequestId` property into the notification's data. I believe this would essentially help for the Webhook kind. For instance, in my case, this will allow me to easily keep track of a request from a Telegram bot.
**Describe the bug**
I started a fresh install/database thinking that would resolve the issue a couple months ago, but I continue to get "Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.SqliteException (0x80004005): SQLite Error 5: 'database is locked'." I even have it reboot nightly to clean up the error, but still happens every day.

If I reboot I am able to log into the plex request site, but at some point during the day, if you try to login again, I am not able to get in, after 30 seconds or so you will see the database is locked error and will have to reboot the server.

**Desktop:**
 - OS: Server 2019

**Ombi Version:**
 - Version: 3.0.4958
- Media Server: Plex

**Describe the bug**
In the Media Server Configuration (http://localhost:5000/Settings/Emby), the information in the text fields does not get stored and the Submit button is disabled. The fields from the initial setup are filled, but it's not possible to adjust them, e.g. withe the Externally Facing Hostname. When someone is not using app.emby.media, the default links to go to Emby Movie detail page via Ombi is broken.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to http://localhost:5000/Settings/Emby
2. Enter Externally Facing Hostname and Server Name
3. Try to submit -> not possible
4. Leave the page and return to it -> All manual entries gone

**Expected behavior**
When entering manual server infos, the infos need to be saved using the Submit button. When leaving the page and return to it, the manual entries are not reset.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**

**Ombi Version (please complete the following information):**
 - Version 3.0.4958 (develop) and 3.0.4892 (stable)
- Emby 4.3.1.0
**Describe the bug**

Not sure if this is by design, but it does not work for me, and I assume others that use Emby DVR.
Only Movies and TV Shows are set in Ombi to be used.
In Emby, I have a movies library and a TV Show library - They are working great in Ombi.
I also use the Standard shipped Emby DVR function, and this has a built in 'Mixed Content' library used to record shows called 'Recordings'.
My remote users do NOT have access to this, and only get TV Shows and Movies libraries.
The Ombi newsletter however is also reading new content from the Emby Delivered 'Recordings' library which is set to Mixed Library.  This means they get informed about all my TV recordings, which they dont get and I would delete after watching.
Apparently Plex has a feature to control library access ?  Need the same in Emby.

**To Reproduce**
Run newsletter, ombi is emailing out new content from the shipped Emby Library 'Recorded TV', not just TV Shows and Movies from the librarues with content specifically set as TV Shows and Movies.

**Expected behavior**
Either ignore emby libraries with 'Mixed Content' (which would work for me but maybe not others), or offer library control in Ombi to be able to select just the Emby Libraries to monitor.
