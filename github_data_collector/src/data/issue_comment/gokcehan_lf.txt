version r13

Hi,

I opened _lf_ in an external drive with _-last-dir-path_ option, copied and deleted some files for a couple of G total, then exited

Several minutes later, I was unable to unmount the device because of some lf process taking hold of it.

```
$ sudo umount /mnt
umount: /mnt: target is busy.
$ fuser -vm /mnt
                     USER        PID ACCESS COMMAND
/mnt:                root     kernel mount /mnt
                     polve     54766 ..c.. lf
```
At the moment, to override the default icons the environment variable
`LF_ICONS` has to be specified in the shell.

I think it would be more natural to do this in the `lfrc` file.
When deleting a file and getting prompted to make sure

```
delete /home/me/file [y/N]?
```
Enter should confirm deletion just like `y`.

I have delete mapped to `x`, and it's far easier to press `enter` than `y`, and other programs like `pacman` allow this and condition my hands to confirm with `enter`.
Enabling `incsearch` feature performs a search in a forward direction only, whether you use `ctrl-/` or `ctrl-?`
In Zathura and other places, you can follow links by pressing `f` then a pattern of numbers/letters as hints.

I think having `set number/relativenumber` all the time is kinda ugly (and, IMO, should only be enabled on the current directory); but another way is to follow (open, not highlight) directories/files (on demand).

[vimium-c](https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c), for example, generates unique characters (which are themselves configurable), so you don't need to press enter for your selection to take effect. And also visually helpful as hints get narrower. 
in `zsh`, you can set `WORDCHARS`, for instance to:
```fish
# ~/.zshrc
WORDCHARS=${WORDCHARS//\/[&.;]} 
```
and that would allow you, among some other things, to remove gradually (e.g., `cd media/books/uiux/ |` to `cd media/books/|`, as opposed to: `cd media/books/uiux/|` to `cd |`)

How can we set this to `lf`'s cmd, or have it respect `zsh`'s?
`rename: README.md│` should instead be `rename: README│.md` as keeping the extension is a more common use case.

The recommended way in the [wiki](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf/wiki/Tips#rename-commands-similar-to-those-of-ranger) removes the extension (and leaves the dot) and forces you to have multiple keybindings for files, files without extensions and directories.
I find that the prompt on the top is kind of useless, and even if I set it to "",
there still will be a blank line where the prompt would be. 
It would be great if in this instance, `lf` "prepares" preview for the `65B` in size file and the "this too" folder.

Behind a `set option`, of course.

Display a message of success on successful copy/move (in green). Sometimes, I don't know what `lf` was doing being open after a long copy operation; there is just no way to tell. This may be possible to change locally, but I don't like to change core commands if possible.
