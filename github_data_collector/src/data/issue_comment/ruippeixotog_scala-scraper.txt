I try to parse big table element with ContentExtractors.table.
but, buildRow and buildTable method is not tail recursion.

Thereby ContentExtractors.table function throwed StackOverflowError.

that failed to parse URL: http://www.tipness.co.jp/schedule/SHP063/month 
When parsing pages in a foreign language - a common use case for this library - it is sometimes needed to parse dates formatted in another locale (e.g. different month and week day names). We should create a built-in parser and `scala-scraper-config` support for those cases.
just like https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver, we can use a real browser.
As you probably know, Chrome now supports headless (https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome), and one way to call it is through WebDriver. Any plan for scala-scraper to support headless Chrome?
It would be nice if the browsers has an asynchronous version of `get`---this way you can just do several page loads at once. As a work around, can I use a custom loader? what format does Document need to be to work with scala-scraper?
