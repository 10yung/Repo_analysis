I'm giving a talk on regular expressions at the PyOhio Conference this year.  A lot of the talk will be in a Juypter Notebook using the Python implementation of SRL.  I'm going over the documentation on the web site and only see provisions begin/end (of string) anchors.  Is there none for begin/end of words, Words?

I am wrong or i can't do this regex : ((data-id)="|src=") 
I tried lots of thing, my last attempt is this one : 

`
capture (
    any of (
        (
            capture(literally 'data-id'),
            literally '="'
        ),
        (literally 'src="')
    )
)
`

The SRL Query contains an error: Non-matching parenthesis found.
Hi all,

I get interested in SRL and I am trying to build a C++ library for "compiling" SRL into regex string, and the library is about to be finished.

And I think no one else has plan to do so (yet?). So if you think it's a good idea, maybe you could create a repo SimpleRegex/SRL-CPP and grant me the privilege to edit it so that I could directly work on it.

Thank you!

I'd like to help with this but I think I'm to new to regex to be able to do it all myself.

I'm .NET developer, I found this amazing repo and I would like to see a C# implementation of SRL.. Do you know if there is someone working on this? What do I need to help?

As a Java developer, I would love to see a Java implementation of SRL.

This would be a killer feature for this project - being able to take existing regex and output a pretty printed SRL expression for it. That would allow verification and and modification of existing regexes much, much easier.

Already suggested from Reddit: 

`exactly` as synonym to `literally`

`either` as synonym to `either of`
