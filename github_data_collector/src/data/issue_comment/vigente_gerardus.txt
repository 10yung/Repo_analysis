The subject pretty much says it all.

I'll see if I can come up with a fix and make a pull request.
I run cmake ..

then when trying to isntall ITK, don't get the:

/home/myname/Software/gerardus/cpp/src/third-party/InsightToolkit-4.3.1/bin directory

ITK also doesn't download
After having a quick look at this document

https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/

I'm not sure whether we can get DOIs for individual directories in the "papers" branch, or only for the whole Gerardus project.

Are we supposed to publish this?

```
when calling the function 

ImOut = itk_imfilter('advess',scimatIn,1,6,6,5);

I get an image with only minor edge effects different to the original. When 
using a pure C++ itk implementation I get a much changed image.

We have to make papers reproducible. Code for papers gets developed in 
private-gerardus, and when they are published, move to public gerardus.
