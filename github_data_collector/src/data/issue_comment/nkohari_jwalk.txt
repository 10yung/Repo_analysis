Hi! Thanks for this tool.

I'd love to be able to pipe data to it.
e.g. `cat file.json | jwalk`

Thanks in advance,
Gunar.

Added a `ll` command to inspect the schema of the specified node.
It also gives a preview of the value each child holds. For strings only the first 80 characters are shown, so the screen won't be messed up when dealing with extremely long strings.

Added the ability to specify an attribution name with the inspect command. This also includes the makefile work from pull request #11. I will leave both open for now but if this is acceptable, you can just merge this one.



There are two commits, one simple curl example, then in the second, using the API, which took me a second to figure out myself.
I hope the second isn't too much noise.
