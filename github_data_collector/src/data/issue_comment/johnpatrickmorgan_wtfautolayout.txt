In addition to the list of constraints, draw rectangles properly depending on the given constraints to better visualize how the constraints interact.
Instead of View1 or View2, it would be neat if we could change it to something easy to remember. Right now I have to write down the memory address of view1, launch the view debugger and cross reference the address from wtfautolayout to find out that view1 actually is `CustomHeaderView`. For a couple views its pretty easy, but gets difficult as more views are on the screen.
If a UILabel has text that contains an apostrophe the parser fails with: 
```
UNEXPECTED INPUT:
...
EXPECTED:
']'
```

Example:
```
(
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600000688070 UIView:0x7fcae969d920.height == 50   (active)>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600000688700 V:[MyApp.UIButton:0x7fcae969f500'No Thanks']-(0)-|   (active, names: '|':UIView:0x7fcae969f320 )>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x6000006887a0 V:|-(0)-[MyApp.UIButton:0x7fcae969f500'No Thanks']   (active, names: '|':UIView:0x7fcae969f320 )>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600000688b10 V:|-(10)-[MyApp.UILabel:0x7fcae969ece0'Keep track of your friend's ...']   (active, names: '|':UIView:0x7fcae969eb00 )>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600000688bb0 V:[MyApp.UILabel:0x7fcae969ece0'Keep track of your friend's ...']-(15)-[UIView:0x7fcae969f320]   (active)>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600000688c00 V:[UIView:0x7fcae969f320]-(15)-|   (active, names: '|':UIView:0x7fcae969eb00 )>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600000688e80 V:[UIStackView:0x7fcae969d720]-(0)-|   (active, names: '|':UITableViewCellContentView:0x7fcae969d530 )>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600000688f20 V:|-(0)-[UIStackView:0x7fcae969d720]   (active, names: '|':UITableViewCellContentView:0x7fcae969d530 )>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600000688f70 'UISV-canvas-connection' UIStackView:0x7fcae969d720.top == UIView:0x7fcae969d920.top   (active)>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600000689060 'UISV-canvas-connection' V:[UIView:0x7fcae969eb00]-(0)-|   (active, names: '|':UIStackView:0x7fcae969d720 )>",

    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x60400048fd20 'UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Height' UITableViewCellContentView:0x7fcae969d530.height == 50   (active)>"
)
```

if you change `friend's` to `friends` the parser is again able to handle the input
Please add a  checkboxes to mark constraint as correct. It' ll help to figure out the problem whet there are more than 15 constrains
`UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-*` constraints are commonly added by collection views et al, but are also the resultant constraints from `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints`. In projects where constraints are being added to old frame-based layouts, knowing this can be really helpful.
