As documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems#error-the-python-ssl-extension-was-not-compiled-missing-the-openssl-lib), compiling on Ubuntu 14.04 leads to a failure because of too old openSSL version.
As the wiki points out, the problem can be solved by compiling your own version of openSSL.
I'd like to add to the wiki a conclusive answer on doing so.


You need two steps, one is building your own version of OpenSSL and the second is instructing pyenvto use it.

To install OpenSSL, run the following commands.
```
mkdir openssl 
cd openssl 
wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.2u.tar.gz 
tar -xzvf openssl-1.0.2u.tar.gz 
cd openssl-1.0.2u 
./config --prefix=$HOME/openssl --openssldir=$HOME/openssl shared zlib 
make 
make
make install
```
This installs the latest version on OpenSSL 1.0.2 (no more patches will be released) to your home directory. Now to install Python 3.7 using pyenv.

After you configure pyenv, run the following command

`PATH="$HOME/openssl:$PATH"  CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/openssl/include" CFLAGS="-I$HOME/openssl/include/" LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/openssl/lib -Wl,-rpath,$HOME/openssl/lib" LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/openssl/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH LD_RUN_PATH="$HOME/openssl/lib" CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl=$HOME/openssl" PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-shared" pyenv install 3.7.5`

You may add -O2 if you want faster run times.

**With changes made in macOS Catalina, they should now read something more like:**

I installed pyenv and virtualenv on my macos and I found the file "box.py" in "/usr/local/var/pyenv/shims/box.py". Open the file it shows 
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
[ -n "$PYENV_DEBUG" ] && set -x

program="${0##*/}"
if [[ "$program" = "python"* ]]; then
  for arg; do
    case "$arg" in

    */* )
      if [ -f "$arg" ]; then
        export PYENV_FILE_ARG="$arg"
        break
      fi
      ;;
    esac
  done
fi

export PYENV_ROOT="/usr/local/var/pyenv"

I cant use python-box at the same time, error show like

Make sure you have checked all steps below.

### Prerequisite
* [ ] Please consider implementing the feature as a hook script or plugin as a first step.
  * pyenv has some powerful support for plugins and hook scripts. Please refer to [Authoring plugins](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Authoring-plugins) for details and try to implement it as a plugin if possible.
* [ ] Please consider contributing the patch upstream to [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), since we have borrowed most of the code from that project.
  * We occasionally import the changes from rbenv. In general, you can expect changes made in rbenv will be imported to pyenv too, eventually.
  * Generally speaking, we prefer not to make changes in the core in order to keep compatibility with rbenv.
* [x] My PR addresses the following pyenv issue (if any)
  - https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/969

### Description
- [x] Here are some details about my PR

If there is a better solution like use macro for reusable code plz guide me :)

Just make it works cause it's really annoying when I have to restart the shell with `exec zsh` and the PATH get populated

### Tests
- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests (if any)


### Description
```pyenv install``` does not understand multi-version **.python-version** files as generated by ```pyenv local 3.5.9 3.6.9 3.7.6 3.8.1```, like:

```
3.5.9
3.6.9
3.7.6
3.8.1
```
Output:

```
$ pyenv install
python-build: definition not found: 3.5.9
3.6.9
3.7.6
3.8.1

The following versions contain `3.5.9
3.6.9
3.7.6
3.8.1' in the name:
  3.5.9
  3.6.9
  3.7.6
  3.8.1

See all available versions with `pyenv install --list'.

If the version you need is missing, try upgrading pyenv:

  cd /home/orpheus/.pyenv/plugins/python-build/../.. && git pull && cd -
```
- Arch Linux (as in 2020.01.05).
- Amd64
- pyenv 1.2.15
- Python 3.8.1
- gcc (GCC) 9.2.0
- Verbose output: https://gist.github.com/ergoithz/da11c71e4c78bd9b4e46fd9c7ea4f55c

For those wondering, setting multiple python versions makes pythonX.Y shims to work on tools like **tox** (which is becoming somewhat standard due setuptools dropping its test command).
Whenever I try to install any module e.g. `pipenv install requests` I get the following error:
```

I've tried Python 3.8.1 and 3.7.6 without any success. I've reinstalled pyenv a number of times but can't get past this issue. Any assistance would be really appreciated!

### Description
This addresses a case I find myself in where aria2c is "present" on a system, but broken due to system libraries being in a bad state.  It replaces the `type cmd` check to see if an executable is present with a `cmd --help` to see if the executable can be executed, and exit non-zero.

### Tests
No new tests added (should still prefer aria2c/curl/wget as before)

When trying to install the additional SDK headers in MacOS Catalina 10.15 i get the following error:
`installer: Error - the package path specified was invalid: '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg'.`

Which makes sense, since this is not 10.14. I found [this issue](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/1425) and tried to follow the instructions there.
 Running `xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-path` gives `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk` so then I tried to run the installer with that path:

`sudo installer -pkg /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk -target /`

But that gives the following error: `installer: Error - the package path specified was invalid: '/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk'.`

The instructions in the guide to setting up the environment does not work on MacOS 10.15, and I can't figure out what to do instead. Am I misunderstanding the instructions that is closing the issue #1425 ? Or are the instructions still wrong?
