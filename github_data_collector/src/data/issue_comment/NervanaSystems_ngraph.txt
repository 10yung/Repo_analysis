In NNP we do a slightly different topological sort in order to get certain ops to the edges of the graph. This change allows us to replace the sorting algorithm used by Function->get_ordered_ops() which is used by the pass manager.

Add provenance tags during upgrade/downgrade passes which convert ops to another opset.
This is still work in progress although it's already possible to import an ONNX model containing inputs with dynamic shapes.
