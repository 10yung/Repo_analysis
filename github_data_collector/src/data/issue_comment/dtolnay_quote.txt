My code is returning a struct, let's call it `Data` from within a Custom Derive sub-crate, and had to implement `quote::ToTokens` for `Data` to make that possible. As my struct was the newtype pattern over a `Vec<Datum>`, it would have been amazing to start from an example that did something similar with some other wrapped `Vec<T>`. 

I wanted to donate back the code I ended up with, which should at least illustrate the documentation gaps in my head:
https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=03acf37f5eeb1e5e156126a270dfafda

I still don't know if I implemented this in a "best practice" way, but I wanted to make an issue to suggest more examples with implementing ToTokens may be useful.
