> ### Security
> 
> #### Address CVE-2019-5477 ([#1915](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1915))
> 
> A command injection vulnerability in Nokogiri v1.10.3 and earlier allows commands to be executed in a subprocess by Ruby's `Kernel.open` method. Processes are vulnerable only if the undocumented method `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file` is being passed untrusted user input.
> 
> This vulnerability appears in code generated by the Rexical gem versions v1.0.6 and earlier. Rexical is used by Nokogiri to generate lexical scanner code for parsing CSS queries. The underlying vulnerability was addressed in Rexical v1.0.7 and Nokogiri upgraded to this version of Rexical in Nokogiri v1.10.4.
> 
> This CVE's public notice is [sparklemotion/nokogiri#1915](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1915)
>

> ## 1.10.3 / 2019-04-22
> 
> ### Security Notes
> 
> [MRI] Pulled in upstream patch from libxslt that addresses CVE-2019-11068. Full details are available in [#1892](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1892). Note that this patch is not yet (as of 2019-04-22) in an upstream release of libxslt.
> 
> ## 1.10.2 / 2019-03-24
>

> ### Bug fixes
> 
> * [JRuby] Fix node ownership in duplicated documents. [#1060](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1060)
> * [JRuby] Rethrow exceptions caught by Java SAX handler. [#1847, [#1872](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1872)] (Thanks, [@&#8203;adjam](https://github.com/adjam)!)
>

> 
> ## 1.10.1 / 2019-01-13
> 
> ### Features
> 
> * [MRI] During installation, handle Xcode 10's new library pathOS. [#1801, [#1851](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1851)] (Thanks, [@&#8203;mlj](https://github.com/mlj) and [@&#8203;deepj](https://github.com/deepj)!)
> * Avoid unnecessary creation of `Proc`s in many methods. [#1776](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1776) (Thanks, [@&#8203;chopraanmol1](https://github.com/chopraanmol1)!)

> ### Bug fixes
> 
> * CSS selector `:has()` now correctly matches against any descendant. Previously this selector matched against only direct children). [#350](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/350) (Thanks, [@&#8203;Phrogz](https://github.com/Phrogz)!)
> * `NodeSet#attr` now returns `nil` if it's empty. Previously this raised a NoMethodError.
> * [MRI] XPath errors are no longer suppressed during `XSLT::Stylesheet#transform`. Previously these errors were suppressed which led to silent failures and a subsequent segfault. [#1802](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1802)

> A command injection vulnerability in Nokogiri v1.10.3 and earlier allows commands to be executed in a subprocess by Ruby's `Kernel.open` method. Processes are vulnerable only if the undocumented method `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file` is being passed untrusted user input.
> 
> This vulnerability appears in code generated by the Rexical gem versions v1.0.6 and earlier. Rexical is used by Nokogiri to generate lexical scanner code for parsing CSS queries. The underlying vulnerability was addressed in Rexical v1.0.7 and Nokogiri upgraded to this version of Rexical in Nokogiri v1.10.4.

> * CSS selector `:has()` now correctly matches against any descendant. Previously this selector matched against only direct children). [#350](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/350) (Thanks, [@&#8203;Phrogz](https://github.com/Phrogz)!)
> * `NodeSet#attr` now returns `nil` if it's empty. Previously this raised a NoMethodError.
> * [MRI] XPath errors are no longer suppressed during `XSLT::Stylesheet#transform`. Previously these errors were suppressed which led to silent failures and a subsequent segfault. [#1802](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1802)

@aaronshekey made a really great page showcasing his product design work at GitHub. I need to get something similar on my site showcasing product work, design thinking, and high level product strategy.
Change from using `px` values to `em` values, and move letter-spacing declarations into the font include mixin so it's only needed to be defined there, on a per font basis (for consistency and maintainability).


When changing the permalink in https://github.com/jglovier/jglovier.github.io/commit/def0184bb2c3235734754dcfe8af544875a431af I broke all teh SEOs, so now I need to add 302 redirects for all those pages.

Some ways to do that (which I've [already](https://github.com/jglovier/jglovier.github.io/commit/f9c47929cec843cee7c376980b25d93ce468914a) [started](https://github.com/jglovier/jglovier.github.io/commit/e07d74f596cfb94dde671758326be60cccf4a890) some).

Ways to fix this in a more automagical way would be to use a plugin like [jekyll-redirect-from](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from).

Use this [insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=joelglovier.com&tab=desktop) from [PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/) to make the site :fire: fast.
