This is the swift-syntax counterpart to https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27776 and https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27905 , updating the gym-generated files to reflect the compiler changes. Posting now to test toolchain builds, please don't merge!
This PR re-factors the `build-script.py` and `update-toolchain.py` scripts to use more idiomatic Python and conform to the standard PEP8 style guide. There are no functional changes, merely a re-organization of code and addition of comments. All functionality remains unchanged, just with improvements to control flow and output organization.
