> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

We use `recompose@0.30.0` and `@types/recompose@0.30.7` with the latest React. I'm not sure why, but for some reason, `compose()` HOC causes to loose typings for React component.

To demonstrate it I've created following simple code:

```tsx
import React, { Component, FunctionComponent } from 'react';

import { compose } from 'recompose';

type Component1Props = {
	test: string;
};

const Component1: FunctionComponent<Component1Props> = ({ test }) => <div>{test}</div>;

const enhance = compose<Component1Props, Component1Props>();

export { Component1 };
export default enhance(Component1);
```

Here is what typescript generates in result:

```js
import { FunctionComponent } from 'react';
declare type Component1Props = {
    test: string;
};
declare const Component1: FunctionComponent<Component1Props>;
export { Component1 };
declare const _default;
export default _default;
//# sourceMappingURL=component1.d.ts.map
```

As you can see, `Component1` without `compose()` generates types normally, but once we apply `compose()`, we're going to lose all types.

Could you please advise how to keep types for components when we use `compose()`?

The first time i used the recompose `lifecycle` i needed to use the component props inside of my hooks, so i had no idea what to do because i was expecting to receive those props but it was not the case. 
After some google research i find out that i should use `this.props` but somehow it felt unnatural to me due i was using recompose to approach my components in a more *functional way*.

I saw a few issues about it like [#682](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/issues/682) and i felt like i could work on this. 

You can say this is my first attempt to OS contribution so i am pretty sure i will have a lot to improve. I ask a bit of your patience and help, i will do my best in order to get this done.

**Notes:**
- New unit tests added in order to cover this feature.
- Added validation for checking that the lifecycles used are valid. This one is motivated to the fact that you can have typo errors and they can lead on very tricky bugs to find.
- Documentation updated.

Please excuse my english but it is not my main language, i am working to improve it.
