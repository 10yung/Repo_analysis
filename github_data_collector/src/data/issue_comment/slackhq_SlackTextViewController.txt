I'm using the SlackTextViewController.
Before It works fine but now I got a problem.
When I tapped inputView of SlackTextViewController then Keyboard will be displayed.
But InputView is not following up keyboard. So I cant see InputView after keyboard showing up.

Embedding `SLKTextViewController` in a container view will most likely cause an incorrect bottom margin calculation. Especially when storyboarding as  https://github.com/slackhq/SlackTextViewController/issues/668

#### PR Summary
Scream at user if there is a tabbar inside a container view and its configuration differs from its parent.  

#### Related Issues
Fixes for #668 and #680 

#### Test strategy
NOOP, adds a console warning to potentially reduce headaches. This could and probably be branched, as it's almost never what the implementor intended. Or simply could take the parentViewController's properties when not null (meaning it's in a container). When storyboarding and running, the tabbar isn't shown, and respects the parent's setting, but `SlackTextViewController` reads this property on the container and provides an incorrect margin making this very difficult to track down and debug. 

The emoji named `:red_car:` is actually a grey car. I'd expect to see a red car.
In some case we need hidden left button. But now SlackTextViewController don't provide this function. This function is used for this case.

To use this function:
```
textInputbar.setLeftButtonHidden(true)
```

#### Description
If a target (in our case, a general UI framework we use internally) uses the `Require Only App-Extension-Safe API` flag, it is unable to include `SlackTextViewController` because it refuses to build since it uses `UIApplication sharedApplication` in various places.

#### Reproducible in:
* [X] This is reproducible in the sample project.

#### Steps to reproduce:

1. Toggle `Require Only App-Extension-Safe API` to `Yes`.
2. Try building

### Expected result:
Project succeeds to build

### Actual result:
Project fails to build
