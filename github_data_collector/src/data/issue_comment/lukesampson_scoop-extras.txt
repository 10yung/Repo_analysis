When I try to start keystore-explorer from the command line using the shim "kse", it shows a dialog saying "This application requires a Java Runtime Environment 1.8.0" even when I have Java 8 installed and in the PATH global variable. Is there something more I can check to diagnose better the problem? I don't really understand how the shims works, anyway. Thanks in advance.

I am unable to install openvpn 2.4.8 dueo to administrator privileges required - here's the log:

```C:\Users\User>scoop install openvpn

Apparently they assume that all the binaries that they need to execute reside in `%localappdata%` - within a scoop installation, this is false, and the programs will not run.

Alongside with that, the `env_set` field (currently) serves no use as they don't actually look for it for anything (yet)
Hi all.
I got into this issue while submitting #3489 which involves the `+` sign. Idk why but the `flutter team` did use an exact `+` sign in the releases. And when I changed the `checkver` in order to support the `+` sign and tried to `autoupdate` it, then I got a stubborn error. 

After some debugging... It turns out that the `[System.Web.HttpUtility]::UrlDecode` method in `lib/autoupdate.ps1` line `175` unexpectedly ( yet reasonable ) decoded the `+` of the `$basename` variable to an empty space. Hence the jsonpath `$.releases[?(@.archive =~ /.*$basename/)].sha256` failed

Now that the cause of this issue is clear, may I ask if we could just replace all the `+` in the `$basename` part of the URL with a `%2B` before decoding it or provide a better approach to cope with similar situations?

* *Are there some more special characters that may lead people into this trap*?
* *Will the replacing `+` with `%2B` harm the other logics*?
* *Is there a possibility that some apps do use `+` to represent a space*?

Any ideas?
#2308 

seems like the GitHub download / releases is not the right place to go /  not so reliable... because different versions are released for Window, macOS, Linux...
When installing gpg4win via scoop, a system wide Kleopatra shortcut is created (`C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Kleopatra`), instead of the Scoop Apps folder.
Same for the desktop shortcut which goes to `C:\Users\Public\Desktop`.

This should be fixable by passing a file with the [/C=\<INIFILE\> option](https://www.gpg4win.de/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_35.html), something like:

```ini
[gpg4win]
  inst_start_menu = false
  inst_desktop = false
```

and adding the shortcuts via scoops config.
