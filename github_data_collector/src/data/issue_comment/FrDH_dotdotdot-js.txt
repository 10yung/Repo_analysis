It would be nice to have access to the original "value" inside the callback function to apply further customizations like adding the full un-truncated text as `title` attribute or even as styled HTML tooltip (using libraries for this like [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/)).

I'm not quite sure how to extend the callback signature. Here are three variants which all have their pros and cons, which should be discussed here before implementing it:

1. Simply add a second parameter `fullText` (which doesn't contain HTML but the `this.container.innerText` value)
2. Add the `DotDotDot` instance as second parameter, which might be too much and could cause loops
3. Add the `originalStyle` and `originalContent` properties of the `DotDotDot` instance as second and third parameter
### Problem/Motivation
I want to truncate text inside a `div` element which is responsive (using Bootstrap 4, which means it neither has a fixed height nor fixed width) and has a calculated `max-height` applied via a CSS class. The actual value of the max-height depends on the current active breakpoint (md, lg).

As it didn't work as expected I looked into the source code of _DotDotDot_ and found that it handles `max-height` calculation for box-sizing values `border-box` and `padding-box` (which actually is not a valid value according to [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-sizing.asp)), but not it's default value `content-box` (only the content height without paddings and borders).

### Proposed solution
- Remove the `padding-box` switch from the height calculation as this is not a defined value by the [CSS specification](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-sizing.asp).
- Add a switch `content-box` which is the default value of `box-sizing`.

Truncate the whole text when I set not max-height css property but just height then text block comes empty (without text). Has anyone got this trouble and how to fix?
Hello licensed owner here, in v3.2.2 there are these lines:

```
var c = document.createComment( '' );
$e.replaceWith( c );
_elms.push( this );
_coms.push( c );
```

These lines for some reason conflict with Foundation 5's tooltip, regardless of initialization order. If the lines above are removed, everything seems to work. I wanted to confirm the reason for the code above, it's implications on functionality, and/or if it is required for functionality, or if it's just a comment generator/placeholder.

```

Oddly, it does not happen when the css is unapplied. 

Thank you.
