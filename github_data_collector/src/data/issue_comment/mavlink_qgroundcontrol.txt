This adds support for the new ArduSub 3.0 feature of automatically detecting the thrusters directions and reverting the corresponding motor output if necessary.
It currently looks like this:

feature request

I use UDP video stream over LTE, and according to my tests RAW h264 works much better than RTP.
Please add RAW h264 support. Or please add custom video stream source configuration string as it's made in Mission Planner.

I use gstreamer with this string to play RAW h264:
gst-launch-1.0 -v udpsrc port=[####] buffer-size=10000000 ! h264parse ! avdec_h264


Hello,

I created an image for a new Autogyro UAV category to avoid an unknown airframe image display. 

The new group was added according to [the manual](https://dev.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/airframes/adding_a_new_frame.html#adding-a-new-airframe-group).
I am using Elementary OS Juno, which I believe is based off of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. 
I am using QGroundControl v3.5.6.

I have a radio modem connected to the computer via an RS232 to USB adapter (pl2303 converter is what shows up in dmesg)

My architecture involves a python program that interfaces directly to the serial port (usually /dev/ttyUSB0 @57600) and then rebroadcasts out via UDP. QGroundControl connects to the rest of the system via this UDP link, and the python program handles incoming messages from both streams and forwards them appropriately.

What is happening is that the python app will be communicating with the modem just fine, but as soon as I open QGroundControl the link stops and no more messages comes through. If I look in /var/lock I can see a file is made called LCK..ttyUSB0.  As soon as I close QGroundControl that lock file disappears and the python program is able to communicate with the serial port again.

If I try opening the serial port directly with QGroundControl I get this error. 
"Link Error" "Error on link Serial Device on ttyUSB0. Error connecting: Could not create port. Permission error while locking the device"

I have removed modemmanager and my user is part of dialout. This problem seems somewhat recent. The setup seemed to be working properly ~3 months ago. The only hardware change since then is I am using a different modem requiring an RS232 to USB adapter, rather than a TTL to USB adapter. Everything is unchecked in AutoConnect to the following devices.

90 / 653 = 13.7% (not 8%)
Not all mission plans consider the VTOL_TAKEOFF identical to the launch position.
After setting the launch position manually it should no longer move

When planning a survey on a hill with terrain following you can set a max climb/descent rate. This is only applied to the transects within the mapping mission. The turn-around waypoints do not consider this limitation as shown below:

This seems quite wrong, on build time we should not copy
libraries, a target for `make package` shouldbe used instead

on cmake this is easier to handle as we have a INSTALL command
that runs only on make install

The problem with the current approach is that the comand fails
after the build is successfully finished, making any IDE to
think that the software did not compiled correctly



Hi 

I work with px4 code for survey application. i can not see camera trigger indicator in qgc flight display menu but before when i was tested with ardupilot code it was working.
i checked tlog file of px4 code , The location of the camera triggers was saved , so there is a problem .
