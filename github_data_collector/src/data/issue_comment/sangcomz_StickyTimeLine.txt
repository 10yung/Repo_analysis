i saw preludezdev's opinion, so i resolved it

* added directory named 'values-21','values-23'
* modified proper default background color in color.xml respectively
in api version 21, section background default color doesn't match parent's background color.
for example, look at this picture 
<img width="347" alt="스크린샷 2019-10-14 오후 5 04 05" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37145713/66736732-00af1700-eea5-11e9-8155-b958d38723ae.png">

but there aren't bug in api 24~

Items width match content and side by side, continuing in next row....
I have implemented your library in my project which is written in java language. In my project  there is need to call data from web service so 1st time when I call web service at that time data properly shown but when I call  web service 2nd time for more data at that time data is displayed in the list with extra space in between the items, extra space in between items and headers as well as width of the item is also changed which is shown in below picture.
Can you help me to solve this problem
