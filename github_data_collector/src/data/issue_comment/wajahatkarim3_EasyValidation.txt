Addressed issue #38
Fixed validation of the local part of the email to allow more accepted characters as well as preventing invalid combinations (like two periods sequentially).
Also increased the length limit of the top-level domain to accept any existing top-level domain (largest has length of 24 characters).
Also added a suite of unit tests in order to validate my changes.

Use extending to reduce code duplication.



The email validation doesn't allow a plus sign "+" before the @.

Plus signs are often used for account aliases, for example, jsmith@example.org and jsmith+test@example.org, jsmith+test1@example.org and jsmith+test2@example.org would address/send emails to a same base email account (jsmith@example.org).


The email validation allows for a maximum TLD length of 4 characters. 

[RFC 1043](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt) allows 63 octets for top level domains.

We experienced this limitation when trying to use .cloud in an email address.
I'm unable to retrieve `.validator()` from a TextInputLayout view.

ðŸ‘€ through your source code, I couldn't find the appropriate methods for it either.

The nonEmptyList method doesn't support the same either
