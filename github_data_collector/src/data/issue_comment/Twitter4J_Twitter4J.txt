Trying to upload a video results in failure. Using the following code:

```java
StatusUpdate tweet = new StatusUpdate("some text");
tweet.setMedia(video);
twitter.updateStatus(tweet);
```

where `video` is a `File` variable, returns the following error:

```
SEVERE: null
403:The request is understood, but it has been refused. An accompanying error message will explain why. This code is used when requests are being denied due to update limits (https://support.twitter.com/articles/15364-about-twitter-limits-update-api-dm-and-following).
message - Error creating status.
code - 189

TwitterException{exceptionCode=[2fc5b7cb-10c2a80b], statusCode=403, message=Error creating status., code=189, retryAfter=-1, rateLimitStatus=null, version=4.0.7}
```

The issue is not reproducible with images, only with videos (tested MP4+H.264 only), regardless of whenever they had an audio track, their size or length.
When retrieving statuses for a user list, using one of the
`ResponseList<Status> getUserListStatuses(long listId, Paging paging) throws TwitterException;` variants, there's no way to specify the `include_rts` optional parameter, so as to also get retweets in the returned statuses
correct grammatically mistake
For android API 19, TLS 1.1 and 1.2 are supported but not enabled by default.
The solution is to create an SSLSocketFactory and pass it to the HttpsURLConnection with `setSSLSocketFactory`. You can find an implementation of SSLSocketFactory here: https://gist.github.com/fkrauthan/ac8624466a4dee4fd02f

There is currently no way to override the SSLSocketFactory as far as I can see. I unfortunately have to drop use of Twitter4j because we need support for API 19 devices.
- Add invalidate token endpoint to ConfigurationBase
- Add invalidateOAuthToken() to OAuthAuthorization

This change allows OAuth 1.0 access tokens to be invalidated.
See https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/api-reference/invalidate_access_token
for more information

This is my first contribution to Twitter4J. If there are any contributing guidelines to follow, I'd be happy to adjust my PR to meet them. :)
Twitter API requires TLS 1.2 since July 30, 2019, 

Android 4.x devices do not support TLS 1.2 by default. 
Therefore, this PR provides a callback method to support TLS 1.2 on Android 4.x devices.

It seems that TwitterException returning `status code` as `-1` when there is `429/rate limit` error from twitter.
**SDK version :** `4.0.7`
**Current behavior:** 
```
twitter4j.TwitterException: Server returned HTTP response code: 429 for URL: https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/user_timeline.json?user_id=XXXX&include_my_retweet=true&since_id=1132320472118067200&max_id=1136656568005660672&count=200&include_entities=true&trim_user=1&include_ext_alt_text=true&tweet_mode=extended
	at twitter4j.HttpClientImpl.handleRequest(HttpClientImpl.java:185)
	at twitter4j.HttpClientBase.request(HttpClientBase.java:57)
	at twitter4j.HttpClientBase.get(HttpClientBase.java:75)
	at twitter4j.TwitterImpl.get(TwitterImpl.java:2084)
	at twitter4j.TwitterImpl.getUserTimeline(TwitterImpl.java:163)
```
**Expected behavior:** `Status code` should be `429` instead of `-1` and also should provide `RateLimitStatus` information.
Corresponds to the specification change of Twitter API scheduled on May 20, 2019.

Removed legacy profile customization values.

status.getHashtagEntities() not retrieving all hashtags from tweet.I have been using 4.0.7 version jar all along.

1) Is someone working on this api as a feature?
2) Does it make sense for the library to support this api?
3) When can I haz it :D 

If the answer is: yes it makes sense but super busy / not already doing it, I might have a crack at adding support myself, so need to know :)

thanks for the lib üöÄ
