Would it be any training code for COCO loss available soon?
Will you provide trained models for other tasks such as person recognition or face recognition?

Thanks
Besides your 99.78% on lfw and 76.57% on megaface, I was also very curious about your baseline method. Training on casia, softmax can get 99.5% on lfw, only using resnet 101. As we know softmax generally get 97.+% for the other papers' baseline, can you share the detail of your network and training tricks to us?
your coco_loss,centerloss ;Can they be used for facial feature extraction?
Do I need to increase the number of network layers?
In your paper, it's said that the centroid of class as average of features over a mini-batch which implies you update the centroid during training according to different mini-batches. But it's also said that "the features are initialized from pretrained models and the initial value of centroid is thereby obtained". As the centroid is determined by a mini-batch, why a initial value is needed?

Thanks for the great idea of using classification layer for cosine distance computation!
Could you please elaborate on how you train that layer? As I understand you initialize weights with average feature vectors for each class and what do you do with biases? Do you use them for training?
