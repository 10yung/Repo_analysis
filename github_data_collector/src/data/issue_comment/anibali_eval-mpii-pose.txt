I would like to ask about the submission of MPII test set. Besides the test set prediction results (pred_keypoints_mpii. Mat) that mpi require, should I prepare any other relevant reports?
I want to evaulate my test_pred.mat, and send an email to eldar@mpi-inf.mpg, debut no one answered my email. 
 Hi,

Thanks for sharing your code.　I want to evaluate our dataset on single keypoint. but met some issues, I find the number of gt must be match with dt's? Thanks very much.

uv_error = pos_pred_src - pos_gt_src
ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (14,2,1743) (1917,14,2)

When we do Multi person Estimation and generate the prediction mat
```matlab
% Set predicted x_pred, y_pred coordinates and prediction score for each body joint
pred(imgidx).annorect(ridx).annopoints.point(pidx).x = x_pred;
pred(imgidx).annorect(ridx).annopoints.point(pidx).y = y_pred;
pred(imgidx).annorect(ridx).annopoints.point(pidx).score = score;
```

Should ridx be in rectidxs_multi_test (extracted by getMultiPersonGroups(groups,RELEASE,false))? Or it's just a iterator over the people in an image according to my preditions result?
