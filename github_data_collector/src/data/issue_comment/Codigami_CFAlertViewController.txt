It should be nice be able to change action button text font as parameter.

See preview:

Hi,

The CFAlertTitleSubtitleTableViewCell.xib  and CFAlertViewController.xib files have CFAlertViewControllerDemo setup as the Module instead of CFAlertViewController.

It works in the demo for obvious reasons but when importing into other projects it doesn't.  Small oversight while testing?

### Issue Description and Steps

It would be nice to have the possibility to change some alert properties dinamically, from a background thread while the alert is visible to the user (e.g. title, message).

Sorry for asking a probably mundane question here, but would there be a way to set the statusbarStyle to lightContent for CFAlertViewController? I'm forced to use controller-based status bar appearance (because I need to hide the status-bar in an unrelated VC) and the rest of my app uses lightContent statusbars. I tried extending CFAlertViewController like so:  
```swift
extension CFAlertViewController {
    open override var preferredStatusBarStyle: UIStatusBarStyle {
        return .lightContent
    }
}
```
but that didn't change anything.

### Issue Description and Steps

Dynamic text settings on the device are ignored, these are becoming more common in iOS 11 (I had a few requests for support for this from users after I only partially implemented dynamic support myself in an app refresh, messing up a few screens)

I think it should be fairly simple to add, as the code already supports scrolling if text becomes too large, and line wrapping if the headings are large. I think it would just be a case of changing the font used, in most places?

Any plans to add this?
