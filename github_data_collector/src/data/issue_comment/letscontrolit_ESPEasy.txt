I noticed, that we I pointing to IP(or URL address) outside of my local network using SendToHTTP it doesn't work. Tested on couple networks using DHCP or static IP address. It's working well when IP is in the same network.
Tested on latest version _mega-20191208_ and _mega-20191028_
***Sample of my code below:***

```
on WiFi#Connected do
   timerSet,1,30
endon

On Rules#Timer=1 do
   logentry,pm25=[SDS011#PM10]&pm25=[SDS011#PM25]
   SendToHTTP 38.240.11.12,81,/kobylany?type=command&pm10=[SDS011#PM10]&pm25= [SDS011#PM25] // whitespace here is just formatter issue
    timerSet,1,60
endon
```


Part of my log below:

```

when writing rules, they are hard to check. 
Perfect would be a button to check the syntax prior to submitting. 
Not sure if this is better implemented in javascript.
For the upcoming "ESP Easy"-router I'd like to have the possibility to post to the following MQTT topic:

`esp_easy/%pluginNumber%/%unitNumber%/%taskNumber%/%valueNumber%`

Out of these only `%untiNumber%` exists (`%unit%`)
I suggest security.dat

Patreon ID: **int32** (8 digits long currently)
UUID: **int64**?

UUID is generated by our server and is unique to each Patreon.
During troubleshooting for Logpulse, the last version installed on a Sonoff Basic.

ESP_Easy_mega-20191208_normal_ESP8266_1M.bin

I immediately noticed that the Wifdi connection is extremely unstable with this image.
I downgrade to version 2.0X and the connection is good again.

Is this a known problem?
Hello,
I have noticed that there is again, or always a problem with longpulse.

I send a Longpulse command over fhem. it is recognized but not processed.

ESP Log:
209383: HTTP: longpulse,12,1,30
209388: SW : GPIO 12 Pulse set for 30 sec
211928: WD : Uptime 4 ConnectFailures 0 FreeMem 20152

after mach tried to switch with longpulse the normal GPIO command doesn't work anymore. you have to restart esp. 

I Use a Sonoff S26 Plug.

different BIN files were tried (Bulids) 

last 
ESP_Easy_mega-20191208_normal_ESP8266_1M.bin

Does anyone have any idea what it could be?
There should be way to do some error-handling in Rules:

Example: `SendTo,2,"LongPulse,14,1,10"` in a P2P Network
* OnSuccess: Flash the green LED
* OnFailure (ie Unit 2 not available): Flash the red LED

Example: `SendToHTTP,url.com,80,/report.php?hash=123abc456&t=[temp2#out]`
* Error when url.com not available or request returns some bad response-code (>= 400)

Cause I'm very new to ESPEasy I suppress implemention-ideas.
