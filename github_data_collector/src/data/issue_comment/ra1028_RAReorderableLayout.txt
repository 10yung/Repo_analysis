There was an issue when change collection view layout.
I fixed to remove gesture recognizers when `collectionView` becomes `nil`.
In HorizontalViewController in moving data logic always uses toIndexPath. But correct way is remove book from "at" IndexPath and insert "to" IndexPath.
It there an option to add 3D touch feedback on drag and drop?
Hello ,

I want to set any value in 'minimumPressDuration' of UILongPressGestureRecognizer.
But, I do not have a better idea.

Can you add this feature?
Hi @ra1028 ,

I want to switch on/off of draggable depending on the situation.
So, I make to settable on/off of drag and drop by draggable property.

Please check this request.
I have a collectionView that implements RAReorderableLayout  and when I long press a collection item the cells must enter in edit mode and they must look different so that edit buttons appear in each cell view. 
Everything works fine unless after I enter the screen, where this collection view is, I long press a cell very quickly and it does not manage to finish redrawing the cells and it reaches this line in your code and crashes because currentCell is nil and you don't unwrap it correctly:
```
            let currentCell = collectionView?.cellForItem(at: indexPath!)
            
            
            cellFakeView = RACellFakeView(cell: currentCell!)
```

Please unwrap it correctly so I can still use cocoapods with the bug fix. Thank you!
