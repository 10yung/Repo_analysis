Ref #12702 

This localizes the Stats Widgets display names.

To test:
Since there aren't localizations yet (obviously), you can verify the widgets are using localized strings by altering the `CFBundleDisplayName` is their respective `InfoPlist.strings` file.

The `CFBundleDisplayName` is displayed:
- In the widget list.
- In the widget title.

Example with altered `CFBundleDisplayName`:

Fixes #n/a
Ref #12702 

The site url is now displayed with a `UITableViewCell` instead of `UITableViewHeaderFooterView`, and is added to the table as simply another row instead of a footer.

To test:
- In the app, select a site. Go to Stats > Widgets > `Use this site`.
- Add all the Stats widgets to the Today view.

**For `All-Time` and `Today`:**
- Expand the widgets.
- Scroll away from the Today view, wait a few seconds, then scroll back.
- Verify the site url doesn't bounce.

Updates VoiceOver Usage and Guidelines based on what we learned while working on the Vision Accessibility Project (paCBwp-jw-p2). 

## Reviewing 

Please feel free to nitpick on the wording. üôÇ 

### Guidelines

The doc was significantly changed to focus more on the not so obvious parts of VoiceOver. The new guidelines are based on the premise that if we had documentation like this when we started the project, we would have been more equipped to decide how to improve some parts of the app. 

1. Read the [**new** `voiceover-guidelines.md` file](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS/blob/update/voiceover-doc/docs/voiceover-guidelines.md).
    - [ ] What do you think of these new guidelines?
    - [ ] Is there something that you do not agree with?
    - [ ] Is the structure easy to follow?
    - [ ] Are the code samples sufficient? 
    - [ ] Is there something that should be added?
2. View the [**old** `voiceover-guidelines.md` file](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS/blob/develop/docs/voiceover-guidelines.md).
    - [ ] Did I remove or change something important?

### Using VoiceOver

The changes are minor and mostly structural. I added some how-tos that I think are not obvious for beginners. 

1. Read the [**new** `using-voiceover.md` file](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS/blob/update/voiceover-doc/docs/using-voiceover.md).
2. View the [**old** `using-voiceover.md` file](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS/blob/develop/docs/using-voiceover.md).

Please use the same questions in **Guidelines** (above). üôÇ 

## Submitter Checklist

- [x] I have considered if this change warrants user-facing release notes and have added them to `RELEASE-NOTES.txt` if necessary.
- [x] If it's feasible, I have added unit tests. 

This replaces the gutenberg commit hash by its equivalent tag in the Podfile 
 
To test: Checkt that the app builds and run as expected

PR submission checklist:

- [x] I have considered adding unit tests where possible.

This is a list of concerns we found when auditing VoiceOver support in Gutenberg. The audit was done using `develop` (1a06134), iPhone XS, iOS 13.1.3.

## Concerns 

### 2 Title Field Elements

When navigating by swiping right, there are 2 accessible elements pertaining to the title field. Please watch [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12otdLZyHbjxViB1hYEhfrvOoXGzxAkMC/view?usp=sharing).

### Content Field Scroll Bar Message

When selecting the content field, VoiceOver would speak information about the scrollbar. For example, it would speak ‚ÄúHorizontal scrollbar. 1 page. Vertical scrollbar. 1 page‚Äù. Not sure if this is intentional. It seems correct but I thought to just bring it up. Please watch [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bNwp86No5e5d7-jwUtlER5BLlug1X737/view?usp=sharing).

### Repetitive Button Hints

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72280148-e21c0180-35f4-11ea-84a3-4978cee30bd6.png" width="320">

The hints of the Add Block, Undo, Redo, and Hide Keyboard buttons are repetitive and most probably unnecessary. For example, for the Add button:

- Label: Add Block ‚úîÔ∏è 
- Hint: Double-tap to add a block ‚ùì 

This goes against the [Apple guidelines for accessibility hints](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/iPhoneAccessibility/Making_Application_Accessible/Making_Application_Accessible.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008785-CH102-SW6). Quoting some of them:

> If the results of a user‚Äôs action on a control or view are **not clearly implied by its label**, create a hint

> **Does not include the name of the action or gesture**. A hint does not tell users how to perform the action, it tells users what will happen when that action occurs. Therefore, do not create hints such as ‚ÄúTap to play the song,‚Äù ‚ÄúTapping purchases the item,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSwipe to delete the item.‚Äù

With these, the ‚ÄúAdd Block‚Äù label should be good and descriptive enough. 

Some buttons with similar concerns:

- Move Block Up and Down buttons
- Remove Block button

### Unlabeled Element

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72281140-1ee8f800-35f7-11ea-9ddb-8d24811a93af.png" width="240">

There is an accessible element below the last block. It does not have a label. But it can be activated, which creates a new block. It can probably be disabled for VoiceOver since there is an ‚ÄúAdd block‚Äù button already. 

### Dismiss Using Escape Gesture

The editor cannot be dismissed using the VoiceOver global escape gesture (make a Z with 2 fingers).  This escape works in most of our views but not for the editor.

### Remove Block Button Label

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72281692-34aaed00-35f8-11ea-9d49-24d71b293005.png" width="240">

The button has a good label. It can be enhanced by being more specific. For example, ‚ÄúRemove **paragraph** block at row 3‚Äù. This gives more confidence to the user that they will be _removing the correct block_. [This WWDC video](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/254/) shows some similar examples of why specific labels can be useful.

### Add Block Menu Selection

When the Add Block menu is shown, VoiceOver's behavior seems random. Sometimes, it would speak something about ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù. Often, it would select an element **behind the menu**. Please watch [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-pFr4-MSqmxZXBKjAgyv2vw81HGsRZTk/view?usp=sharing).

### Add Block Menu Dismissal

Sometimes I cannot dismiss the menu using the VoiceOver escape gesture. This happens often if the menu was just shown. 

It might be useful to add a transparent dismiss button on top of the menu too. We do this for the Login dialog. 

### Add Block Menu Items Attributes

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72282918-f236df80-35fa-11ea-80d8-a0ce1bac5e28.png" width="240">

The menu items do not have the `.button` attribute.

### Paragraph Block ‚Üí Move Up Auto-selected

1. Add 2 paragraph blocks
2. Navigate and select the title field to start editing
3. Navigate to the second paragraph block and edit it.

The Move Up button is automatically selected after starting to edit the paragraph contents. Weirdly, the text field is still being edited. [This video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RbXgr-ioMMEPqohW3GoqtgcfGd7tIdc1/view?usp=sharing) shows this behavior.

### Move Up and Down ‚Üí The Other Block is Selected

When moving a block up, the block that _replaces_ it is selected instead of the block that was moved. I'm not entirely sure if this is a problem. But it seems more useful to have the same block and its Move Up button to be **reselected** again. If that's the case, it would be faster for the user to move a block multiple times. 

[This video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XLdwSqxlpcf1mPJbctTp_Jko1zFoanDB/view?usp=sharing) shows this behavior. In that video, observe that the ‚ÄúOne‚Äù paragraph block is selected after the ‚ÄúTwo‚Äù paragraph block is moved.

This probably only happens if moving from the second row to the first, which will cause the button to be disabled. 

### Separator Block ‚Üí Small Hit Area

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72288317-06340e80-3606-11ea-9be6-a75254c5388c.png" width="240">

This is probably subjective but I found the hit area to select the separator block to be too small (vertically). It took me a few seconds to select it with VoiceOver. [Here is a video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b0UYroi_zei8yZR314jaJySUg8Yc5UhI/view?usp=sharing) of me moving my thumb up and down near the separator. 

### Spacer Settings ‚Üí Header

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72288802-113b6e80-3607-11ea-977f-1442c606d621.png" width="240">

The Spacer Settings header title can make use of the `.header` accessibility attribute. 

### Spacer Settings ‚Üí Quiet Presentation

When a dialog is shown, VoiceOver would usually select the first element of the presented dialog. For the Spacer Settings' case, nothing is selected. VoiceOver just stays quiet. It may take a while for a blind user to realize that the dialog is already visible. 

[Here is a video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n1jIgX7WtW9so61xQbqW2bhlSw8P99v7/view?usp=sharing) showing this behavior. In the late part of that video, you'll see that when opening the accessibility shortcut dialog, VoiceOver speaks one of the elements. That is probably what we want here too.

### Image Settings ‚Üí Header

Like the Space Settings header described above, the Image Settings text can also have the `.header` accessibility attribute. 

### Image Settings ‚Üí Quiet Presentation

Just like the Space Settings described above, the Image Settings dialog is also quietly presented. No elements are immediately selected. 

### More Block ‚Üí Small Hit Area

When Selected | When Not Selected
--------|-------
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72292065-e9033e00-360d-11ea-82e6-d799a6f70798.png)        |       ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72292099-f7e9f080-360d-11ea-8dbc-3d96ff796ba0.png)

When not selected, the Read More hit area is shorter. It's probably better to make the hit area the same as when it is _not selected_ (see image above). 

### Video Block ‚Üí Video Label

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72292446-a2faaa00-360e-11ea-98c5-10d489bb875b.png" width="240">

When a video block is selected and its video UI element is selected, VoiceOver would speak ‚ÄúWrite caption... Horizontal scrollbar, 1 page Vertical scrollbar...‚Äù. This is a bit difficult to understand.

### Video Block ‚Üí Caption is Not Accessible

When navigating by swiping right, the Caption text field is never navigated to by VoiceOver. VoiceOver skips to the Move Up button.

### Video Settings ‚Üí Header

Like the Space Settings header described above, the Video Settings text can also have the `.header` accessibility attribute. 

### Video Settings ‚Üí Quiet Presentation

Just like the Space Settings described above, the Video Settings dialog is also quietly presented. No elements are immediately selected. 

### List Block ‚Üí Accessibility Value

List Block | Paragraph Block
--------|-------
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72293209-439d9980-3610-11ea-9a81-ccd51a4c9d6a.png)        |       ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72293240-56b06980-3610-11ea-9c90-972c6f4ce152.png)

Unlike the Paragraph Block, the List Block does not provide any information to VoiceOver about its contents. 

### Quote Block ‚Üí Accessibility Value

Quote Block | Paragraph Block
--------|-------
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72293554-f40b9d80-3610-11ea-813c-c1a61cd4f8a6.png)        |       ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72293240-56b06980-3610-11ea-9c90-972c6f4ce152.png)

Unlike the Paragraph Block, the Quote Block does not provide any information to VoiceOver about its contents. 

### Gallery Block ‚Üí Add Button Label

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72293753-67151400-3611-11ea-83dc-ab45a4c72c81.png" width="240">

The Add Button's accessibility label is ‚Äúfalse block‚Äù. That is most probably incorrect. The hint is also mentioning ‚ÄúDouble-tap‚Äù which is not recommended by Apple. 

### Gallery Blocks ‚Üí  Settings ‚Üí Adjustable Columns is Not Adjustable

When selecting the Adjustable Columns, VoiceOver says that the element is adjustable. However, swiping up or down does not change the value. [Here is a video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ke49NUK7i_2xwjJ-U0btf40FG5HAIoSv/view?usp=sharing) of me trying to do that.

### Media & Text Block ‚Üí Button Cannot  Be Activated

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72295748-68484000-3615-11ea-811a-a57faacd0247.png" width="240">

There are these buttons in the Media & Text Block that are shown when selecting either the Media or Text sub-blocks. The button cannot be double-tapped with VoiceOver. It is also unclear what the purpose of the buttons are. They could probably use a better label or a hint. 

### Preformatted Block ‚Üí 2 Text Fields

When navigating by swiping right, VoiceOver can navigate to 2 text fields. [This video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dXyb8D1K59BHCM4q5NcpFXCGpeWyVIKj/view?usp=sharing) shows this behavior. 

### Accessibility Inspection ‚Üí Hit Area Failures

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72296786-b52d1600-3617-11ea-85b3-8896cc3d10a0.png)

When running an audit using the Accessibility Inspector, quite a few of the elements fail the Hit Area size check. 

## Suggestions

### Image Block ‚Üí Image Actions

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72289613-b99e0280-3608-11ea-843c-6133f3a9861a.png" width="240">

After selecting an image block and then selecting the image, VoiceOver would say ‚ÄúDouble-tap and hold to edit..‚Äù. The _double-tap and hold_ is VoiceOver's [standard gesture](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/iphone/iph3e2e2281/ios) which skips the VoiceOver gestures. Another way this can be done is to use [custom actions](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/250/). We can then provide 2 actions:

- Edit 
- View 

Using custom actions would probably make both actions more discoverable. And we don't need to provide the _double-tap instruction_ in the label. 

### All Blocks ‚Üí Custom Actions

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/72291647-04ba1480-360d-11ea-87c6-16be90cd2855.png" width="240">

For a block that is currently **not technically selected** (i.e. no Move Up/Down, Trash buttons are shown) but **selected by VoiceOver**, we can provide [custom actions](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/250/). This may help speed up interaction. 

For example, for the Image Block, we can have these as custom actions:

- Move Up
- Move Down
- Settings
- Trash
- Add Block
### Expected behavior
As text is inputed into the app the text should scroll upwards automatically as I get to the bottom of the screen, so text is never hidden below where I can see it

### Actual behavior
If an external keyboard is attached to the iOS device and used to enter text then it will be hidden as you get to the end of the viewable area. The text stays hidden for 1-3 lines, then auto scrolls upward

### Steps to reproduce the behavior
1. Add an external keyboard to your iOS device. I used Apple's Magic Keyboard
2. Open a new post or page using the block editor
3. Write until the page is full of text 

##### Tested on [device], iOS [version], WPiOS [version]
Tested on iPad, iOS 13.3, WPiOS 13.8.1 with Magic Keyboard
User reported on iPad Pro 9,  iOS 13.3, WPiOS13.81 with a Logitech keyboard #2625427-zen
### Expected behavior

- [ ] Media Library should show a better indication of loading. We can use a spinner/loader instead. 
- [ ] If we'll continue to have a text it should at least be positioned better and rephrased to indicate loading

### Actual behavior

Media Library shows "Nothing to show" message during loading.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior

Be sure to reset Media Library cache by either fresh installing the app or switching to a new site that you'll edit the first time.
Slow down your connection via Settings -> Developer -> Network Link Conditioner -> %100 loss

- Add a new post via block editor
- Add Gallery block
- Tap on placeholder
- Choose "WordPress media library"

Result: 

1. It says "Nothing to show" as if the media library is empty.
2. The position of the message is odd.
