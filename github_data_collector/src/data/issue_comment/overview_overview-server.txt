Steps to reproduce:

1. Convert some documents
2. Cancel
3. Kill Overview _during cancel_, _after_ `grouped_file_uploads` have been deleted for a file group, but _before_ the `file_group` has been deleted.
4. Restart Overview

Expected results: Overview finishes cleanup upon restarting (or the deletion from `grouped_file_uploads` was in a transaction, so it gets undone and Overview starts where it left off next time)
Actual results: Overview leaves the `file_group` alone -- it's a job that stays around forever.

Workaround:

1. Browse to https://www.overviewdocs.com/admin/jobs
2. Inspect the page to see the FileGroup ID (it's part of the table row)
3. Make sure you have the right FileGroup: `SELECT * FROM file_group WHERE id = XXXXX`
4. Make sure it's empty: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM grouped_file_upload WHERE file_group_id = XXXXX`
5. Delete it: change `SELECT *` to `DELETE FROM` in the query from step 3
Steps to reproduce:

1. Alice uploads a big set of PDFs
2. Bob uploads a small set of PDFs
3. Bob cancels the conversion

Expected results: the conversion cancels quickly
Actual results: the cancellation is stalled while waiting for Alice's documents to convert

This affected a user today.
Use case:

1. Alice uploads a huge set of PDFs needing OCR
2. Bob uploads a small set of PDFs needing OCR

Expected results: Overview cuts Bob some slack, as it knows Alice's job will take all day.
Actual results: Bob must wait for Alice's job to complete.

Affected a user today.
When deleting tags from the Organize Tags dialog, the confirmation message always says "no documents" no matter how many documents the tag has been applied to.
Works in Chrome. I believe this is an old Safari limitation -- I wonder if Safari now supports what we need.
Steps:

1. Upload an invalid file
2. Complete import
3. Look at document list

Expected results: somewhere on the page, a warning describes import errors
Actual results: there are no error messages

Workaround: go back to the document-set _list_ page and click on the warning.
This might be a useful feature (which doesn't work now):

1. Browse to a document that contains metadata
2. Open the "Fields" plugin (or the "Fields" area at the bottom of the document)
3. Click a "More documents with this value" button next to a metadata field value

That would add `AND "Field Name":"Value"` to the search.
I haven't tested it after the Play 2.6 upgrade
