It appears that the pod spec for v.0.9.13 are missing from the cocoapods site: https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/blob/master/Specs/a/5/3/TSMessages/0.9.13/TSMessages.podspec.json

We did a `pod repo update`, but still got errors while trying to update the pod.:
`pod 'TSMessages'                ,'0.9.13'`

```
[!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "TSMessages":
  In Podfile:
    TSMessages (= 0.9.13)

None of your spec sources contain a spec satisfying the dependency: `TSMessages (= 0.9.13)`.
```

Hope you can sort it out :-)

if you use the TSMessages in a pod ,you can't find the png file . please set bundle not only mainBundle. thanks
Fix xcode warnings helping projects to remove all warnings
[!] Unable to satisfy the following requirements:

- `TSMessages (~> 0.9.13)` required by `Podfile`

None of your spec sources contain a spec satisfying the dependency: `TSMessages (~> 0.9.13)`.

You have either:
 * out-of-date source repos which you can update with `pod repo update`.
 * mistyped the name or version.
 * not added the source repo that hosts the Podspec to your Podfile.

Note: as of CocoaPods 1.0, `pod repo update` does not happen on `pod install` by default.

Fix main bundle incorrect lookup.
Hey,

Pretty simple example crashed app.
`[NSBundle mainBundle]` doesn't work if library installed as framework.
`[NSBundle bundleForClass:self.class]` could solve problem.
