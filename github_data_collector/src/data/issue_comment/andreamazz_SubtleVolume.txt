I have a UIViewController with an AVPlayerViewController in it. I disable MPVolume Hud in the ViewController, and it doesn't appear until I play the AVPlayer in the AVPlayerViewController. I know that with

`avplayercontroller.showsPlaybackControls = false`

the hud disappears, but the problem is that every control disappears, and I need controls, and I prefer to use system controls instead of custom ones.

SubtleVolume works, but when I play the Player controller both the hud and SubtleVolume are visible.

I tried to create a MPVolume and add it to the app window, to the player controller view, but the hud is still visible.

```swift
let volumeView = MPVolumeView(frame: CGRect.zero)
if let appDelegate = UIApplication.shared.delegate as? AppDelegate, let window = appDelegate.window {
    window.insertSubview(volumeView, at: 0)
}
```

I've tried almost everything, but I can't figure out what is the problem.
I have nav bar and status bar does not want to slide up 
Added 2 separate properties `displayAnimationDuration` and `hideAnimationDuration` that allow for more customization of the animation.
When trying to apply an accessory image to the volume bar, I noticed that it wasn't displaying properly. The code was basing the accessory frame on the bar height and since my bar height was quite smaller than the accessory image, that was causing the issue. I updated it so that the image size is used instead.
Hi, I was tried to manual setVolumeLevel without animated = false but app crashed.
