The first badge update goes through fine, but then updates are only applied when the user is looking at the page. This seems to be a Chrome change because it works fine in earlier versions of Chrome, but the fix for the time being is to trigger the update twice.
Firefox 46 runs into an error when it executes the drawImage line (see below) and no link tag for a favicon is in the html. The reason for that error is that this browser version is not able to draw an empty image on the canvas.
Could you please correct that?

Would you mind clarifying your intent with dual licenses? Clearly GPL is pretty restrictive and likely would have undesirable consequences when used in a web client (I think that would be consider static linking and thus apply).

I suspect your intention (language used in package.json) was that either license could apply, it is at the user's discretion?
So after I've initialised the favicon using `new Favico({})` I noticed that there doesnt seem to be a way to update the badge color/animation style etc. There is a 'badge' api to update the text in the badge but what if I want to update the colors?

Is there a way to do this?

The way I solve this is by reinitialising the favicons but that causes other problems. is there an easier way to do this?
I need a very simple usage: only badge without text.
I did it by passing a one-space string as text: `favicon.badge(' ');`

Now, without text, I would like to display a smaller badge, is it possible?
Is it planned to get a wrapper for Angular 2+?
Safari 12 now supports favicons in tabs, however, we still can't dynamically change the favicon after the favicon has been loaded and cached. This is a problem if you use Gmail, Slack, Travis CI, AppVeyor and numerous other websites.

If you use [Brisk](https://github.com/br1sk/brisk), right click on the Dock icon, and select "Duplicate Radar"  and enter `44268401` (or File -> Duplicate Radar)
If you don't have that menu option, you might have to update Brisk.

`brew cask install brisk`
There is a noticeable lag in updating the favicon in the bookmark bar. The page gets updated with the favicon but the bookmarked icon takes a longer time to update.
