When items are less than 5 them on remove it crash
can I track my git repo changes by this??
In my use case, I only want to know when a new version of software becomes available at https://xpericheck.com/cda/1310-7123. But after that new version becomes available, the page updates to say how long ago it was released, which I don't care about. 

Could your software fairly easily look for a specific table element? 
I'd like to be able to choose a unique sound for this app or even individual sites being monitored.
Hi, I discovered this app a few days ago and it looks really great. Thank you for creating it!

I found myself puzzling with a page that will be updated 10 times a year, but using the app I found out that the current date is shown in the page and will update daily.

http://statistica.comune.genova.it/pubblicazioni/periodiche.php

The actual content does not change, only a single line in the HTML source corresponding to the date.

So I thought maybe there could be a threshold setting to ignore changes below a certain diff size. What do you think?
hello dear bernaferrari,

i found your tool via reddit and wanted to thank you for this simple solution! Some sebsites I rely on require authorization before showing any content. For example I have to enter my student number or log in with my student account before i can see exam result online. Is there a way do this with your app? Or maybe there is a workaround? 

Thank you for your time!
I really like the the design and layout of the app. Here are a few suggestions I think will make the app even better!

 1. Add an option to reduce the interval between syncs from 15 minutes to 5 minutes. (5 - 10 - 15 - 30 - 60 and so on)

2. Add a black/OLED friendly theme (i.e. pure black background) with an option to set solid colors for headers of the link

3. Customizable background sync settings for each app. Letting the user choose which webpages teed to be synced less often or in what circumstances..

 Thank you for your awesome app (:+1: )
Tests were completely skipped during development.
Of course this should never happen, but happened. From simple stuff to WorkManager (which didn't even have official tests when this repository was released, but now has!), all help is appreciated.
