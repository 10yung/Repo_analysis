Example (enthalpy is set to 1 for all points)
```
import plotly.figure_factory as ff
import numpy as np
Al = np.array([0. , 0. , 0., 0., 1./3, 1./3, 1./3, 2./3, 2./3, 1.])
Cu = np.array([0., 1./3, 2./3, 1., 0., 1./3, 2./3, 0., 1./3, 0.])
Y = 1 - Al - Cu
enthalpy = np.ones(Al.shape) # set enthalpy to 1 for all points
fig = ff.create_ternary_contour(np.array([Al, Y, Cu]), enthalpy,
                                pole_labels=['Al', 'Y', 'Cu'],
                                interp_mode='cartesian')
fig.show()
```

Result:

Note that 2d-contour works well (i.e. filled by a single color) for such a setting.
Dear all:

I am using plotly 4.4.1 on Jupiter notebook, anaconda 

I have data frame where one row contains sets. When I use plot, it gives an error of TypeError: Object of type set is not JSON serializable, but I am not using that specific column in the visualization. I found a way around the dropping the column for visualization, but this error seems to be a bit unnecessary since I do not use the column. I did not have this issue in 4.4.0, but I could find a way to go back to that version

We need a `px.sankey` and I think modelling it after the `path` flavour of `px.sunburst` introduced in #2006  is a great starting point! By default it would be always-branching, but we could add a `merge_nodes=True` option which could collapse nodes or something
Right now in places like https://plot.ly/python/shapes/ we still use `go.layout.Shape` in places where this is unnecessary... instead of `.add_shape(go.layout.Shape( whatever ))` we can just use `.add_shape( whatever )`.

@Mahdis-z please do a search for `go.layout.` (note the trailing dot!) and refactor all those instances into either straight `dict`s or, in cases of `add_shape` above, just remove the intermediate object and pass the kwargs directly. You can't just do a blind search-and-replace though because in certain cases we show the old usage on purpose :)

Hi,

We use plotly, jupyter lab and voila for our work. Recently we have started facing an issue with plotly graphs in our notebook files shrinking completely. This behaviour is experienced with standalone voila execution of notebooks and also when a voila button is clicked in Jupyter Lab.

The current plotly version that we use is 4.4.1 and voila is at 0.1.20.

Please note that this behavior is not consistent. Sometimes both the graphs shrink, sometimes just one graph shrinks, other times both do not shrink. Also, most importantly, as soon as I resize the window that has these graphs, the graphs come back and autofit properly.

See the 'svg-container' div element's width and height attributes in the below image - one graph's width and heights are in px values, whereas the other graph's in %.

By shrink, I mean this:

Any kind of help is appreciated. I'm unable to give a reproducible notebook, so I apologize in advance. My only hope is that ppl who are aware of plotly's svg-container div elements would understand the issue right away with the way the width elements are sometimes pixels and %s.

Thanks,
