Angular App freezes if left unused for about an hour this is because of ngx-virtual scroll.
If disables it works fine.

*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

I have a chat window with the virtual scroller inside. I cannot select any text within the virtual scroller. How can I solve this?
When scrolling up and down on table with header, it moves around for the duration of scrolling.
I tried "useMarginInsteadOfTranslate" but it didn't work. 
I've noticed this bug only on mobile. "transform: translateY" on thead seems to have a delay and can't keep up with changes, so it moves weirdly and after scrolling is finished goes to a proper position. Setting checkResizeInterval to 0 or 1 also didn't fix it.
`--save` has been default since [npm v5](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/161081169345/v500).
see https://github.com/rintoj/ngx-virtual-scroller/issues/268

Not perfect (some flickering during scrolling), but at least usable...
[Documentation](https://github.com/rintoj/ngx-virtual-scroller#api) for `vsUpdate` states:
> This event is fired every time the start or end indexes change

In practice, it seems to be triggered for every pixel change in the scroll position instead.

The issues is _not_ present for the `vsStart`, `vsEnd`, or `vsChange` events.
Firefox issue, from the samples you have created, **with HTML Table**, there is a flickering/vibration issue when you scroll up and down, and its quite obvious to the user.

Just want to check how is that possible from your sample, with HTML Table, the issue is no longer there when the dev tools is opened. Not sure if its the console.log thing, or some scripts will only be triggered when dev tools is opened and I haven't got chance to go through the source code.

I am testing from the samples/demo, **with HTML Table**.

Firefox version 70.0.1
I noticed in the readme, that there a few contradictory statements:

"This module displays a small subset of records just enough to fill the viewport and uses the same DOM elements as the user scrolls."

"virtual-scroller essentially uses *ngIf to remove items that are scrolled out of view. This is what gives the performance benefits compared to keeping all the off-screen items in the DOM."

Based on the first statement, I would have expected the Angular components to be recycled, and not be destroyed (similar to od-virtual-scroll). With that library, ngOnChanges fires and you can reuse the DOM element and simply update the information. For my use case, I'm displaying many HighCharts graphs in a grid, so creating the elements is very expensive when compared to updating the trend line in an existing chart.

This is negligible in modern browsers, but I've noticed that the performance is dramatically worse in Internet Explorer.
