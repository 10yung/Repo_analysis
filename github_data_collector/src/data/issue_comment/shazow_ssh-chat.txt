### Expected Behavior
To ignore someone 100%

### Actual Behavior
Only ignores their messages and not emotes

### Steps to reproduce behavior
1) Ignore someone
2) Tell them to `/me does something`
3) Read their `** person does something` message

See #272

* SSHCHAT_TIMESTAMP can be 0 or 1 to disable or enable, or can be set to the /timestamp format arg.
* SSHCHAT_THEME is set to the theme name.

This also pulls in #309 - which needed a fix.
For #322

Rather than looking like

```
[chris] /help
-> Available commands:
```

it looks like
```
/help
-> Available commands:
```

Feel free to hold off or reject this, I just felt like giving it a try.

Would be good to automate the release process more, and add deb/rpm packages.

Hello,

I made a package for Debian.
Interested in adding as a download option?
When I do a /command it looks like I spoke it to the room, would be nice if it looked different.

```
[chris] test
[chris] /help
-> Available commands:
...
```

test is a message, /help is a command, it looks like both are seen by all users.

I believe IRC clients don't show you what command you entered, that could work here if the command output was useful by itself. Consider /msg and /reply (perhaps others) where you would want to see what you typed.

Otherwise a simple solution would be to just show the command, not your [name].

Thoughts?
Our machines permit login with GSSAPI/Kerberos credentials. It would be a cool feature if I could tell ssh-chat to allow login from kerberos authenticated clients.
Redux of #204, #283:

Right now we sort by most recently active. If I just sent a message as shazow, responding to steve. And I `s<tab` again, it'll complete to `shazow` which makes sense since it was the most recent activity but I almost never want my own name.

It should only include my name if it's the only result.

Should be a fairly small change here: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/67163a93a8d5e2dcf10e0e9d288d600faf16a189/host.go#L259

Probably need to modify the completeName helper (or inline it altogether, since it's not used anywhere else?).
Right now when an op does /op on someone, there's no success feedback. A system message would be nice.
If an op does /whois on someone, it should tell them if they're also an op.
