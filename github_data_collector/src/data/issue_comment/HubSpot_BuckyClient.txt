It was not reading options provided in the script tag. because default value was overriding. in line 86

Previously it was only possible to send numeric values (types: `timer`,
`gauge` and `counter`). This commit adds supports for a type `string`
which accepts arbitrary strings. The identifier in a measurement is `s`,
as in `this.is.a.string:hello|s`.

My current use-case requires this in order to pass a correlation ID
together with the measurements. Sharing as PR in hopes for it to be
useful to somebody.

`a.b.c:662.785|ms@0.5`
Should be `a.b.c:662.785|ms|@0.5` (missing `|` before `@`).

Currently, BuckyClient has 2 major issues:
- Don't handle unload event, so we might lost tracking data when users click on another link.
- Don't support navigator.sendBeacon API yet. It will support async ajax when users leave the current page (unload event) and also make sure that the tracking data is sent.

If it's ok, I will add a PR.

An extra pipe is required before the @rate as specified here:

Is it possible to have the latest release on npm? Thanks in advance
