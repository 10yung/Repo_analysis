I found AppKit framework have already implement tree structure, and I will rewrite tree related code if possible.

Every single loop will be faster without any additional computations and methods call.
E.g "[array count]" in loop such as "for (NSUinteger i = 0; i < [array count]; i++)" should be extracted to independent local variable NSUinteger counter = [array count].
So the loop will be faster & look like "for (NSUinteger i = 0; i < counter; i++)".
