Hi, and thanks for a great code. But one small problem is that I found it impossible to create LSH index using the most current code in your repository. In CalculateHashes you try to fill in bins using standard code, computing projections in form floor( bias + projection*data/w). But the code, which tries to do that, accidentally have dimensions disagreement. I just fixed this using slice and transpose, and left the rest intact.

I plan to make your code run under Hadoop, so, if you are interested, let's stay in touch :-)

line 1056 in lsh.py suggests to use N=100000 data points.
but the create procedure `python2.6 lsh.py -d 5 -create` needs to find out the nearest neighbors for N points using brutal force i.e. quadratic complexity. For N=100000, it would never finish. I tried just N=1000 and the create procedure  finishes within 1 minute.

Another thing on `doc/examples.html` is also, I believe, inaccurate.

>        dnnHist, dnnBins, danyHist, danyBins, deltaTarget, r, uHash, uCheck);`
> `end`

But the matlab function `CalculateMPLSHParameters` isn't in the repo (did I miss something here?).
I changed that line to this and worked for me.
`results(r+1) = CalculateLSHParameters( N, dnnHist, dnnBins, danyHist, danyBins);`
