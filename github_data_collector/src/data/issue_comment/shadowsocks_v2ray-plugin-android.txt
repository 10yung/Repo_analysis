由于服务器上设置了 mux=0 
但在 Android 的插件里一旦将 Concurrent connections 设置为 0 之后，一连接就报错：
libss-local exits too fast (exit code:255)

#13 was closed without any comments so I opened another one.
If the server side using a self-signed certificate, and the certificate using an invalid host name, the client cannot connect to the server, as the server side logs `remote error: tls: bad certificate`.

For example, I configured a server on `1.2.3.4`, and self-signed a certificate and its host name is `example.com` (but I'm not holding it, so accessing the domain directly won't be my server). Then on the client side, I set the server to `1.2.3.4`, and specified `Hostname` in plugin options as `example.com`, and paste the base64-encoded certificate content. Then I started the connection, but it's not working, server-side says `remote error: tls: bad certificate`.

The same configuration is working on Windows by importing the `.cer` file to trusted root certificate, and working on iOS by ignoring SSL error.
 The upsteam v2ray-plugin has supported completely disabling mux. https://github.com/shadowsocks/v2ray-plugin/pull/123  Will this android plugin merge this feature?
Android with quic not work at all. My server doesn't get any request from my phone. 
Windows use quic fine.
Android use websocket fine.

my plugin-opts
  server;mode=quic;host=mydomain.com;cert=/path/my.crt;key=/path/my.key
