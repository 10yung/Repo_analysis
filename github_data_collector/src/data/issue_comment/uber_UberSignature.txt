How to save as base64 in objective c 
'UberSignature/UBSignatureDrawingViewController.h' file not found
Hi Uber,
I just research this framework, I have a question is
How can I make a signature with string SVG?
Thanks,
This fix addresses Issue #16 where lines would have jagged endpoints when using the Swift version of the library

For issue https://github.com/uber/UberSignature/issues/21 and swift sample app updates, also added signature drawing view, useful for table cells when can't use a vc
https://github.com/uber/UberSignature/blob/master/Sources/Swift/SignatureDrawingViewController.swift#L40
```
public init(image: UIImage? = nil) {
        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
    }
```

The passed image is not used or shown in view controller when using this initializer, I would expect that when I pass an image to this initializer it would show the image
This change makes UberSignature use high fidelity input from the Apple Pencil when provided. This allows for smoother strokes.
