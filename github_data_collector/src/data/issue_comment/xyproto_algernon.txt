Currently, `PQ` only returns a table of strings.

Enhance the `PQ` function so that it may return a Lua table containing many different data types, depending on what exists in the PostgreSQL query result.
I'm currently using a shell script to execute algernon, because I don't know how to translate the command line options into the serverconf.lua, or know if there even is a way to access some of the command-line flags from the conf file. Here is what I'm using. Would it be possible to have parallel functions in serverconf.lua available which align to these options? Do they already exist but are just not documented? It would great for cross-platform compatibility if I could just use the serverconf.lua and not have to have the launch script.

    #!/bin/bash

    DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )"

    "$DIR/algernon" \
      --dir="$DIR/srv" \
      --boltdb="$DIR/data.bolt" \
      --key="$DIR/key.pem" \
      --cert="$DIR/cert.pem" \
      --dev \
      --autorefresh \
      --cookiesecret="9jc9djcd000dcd"
The readme references the ability to use .zip or .alg files, presumably to bundle your website content. Would it be possible to add a sample to the samples/ folder that utilizes this feature? Thanks!!
Hello,
Do you plan to support Let's Encrypt certificats for HTTPS ?
