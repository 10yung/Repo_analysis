So far this is the nicest solution that I've come up with, but it only successfully runs on mysql which isn't ideal, and is why I have the test deactivated (sqlite). I also ran locally with postgresql and failed.

As an alternative, the MySQL query that successfully runs is:

```mysql
SELECT DISTINCT
	(thread_id)
FROM
	participants a
WHERE
	user_id IN(1 , 2)
AND EXISTS(
	SELECT
		1
	FROM
		participants b
	WHERE
		a.thread_id = b.thread_id
	GROUP BY
		thread_id
	HAVING
		COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) = 2
)
GROUP BY
	thread_id
HAVING
	COUNT(thread_id) = 2
```

but this is a beast to try and run within the scope and Eloquent. I'm just posting this here to see if anyone else has any ideas or wants to take a crack at it. I'll keep pushing tomorrow.
Hello! 
It appears for me, while trying to use default `betweenScope` located in Thread model, it doesn't work as expected. For example, `Thread::between([1,2])` will return all the Threads where users with ids `1` and `2` are participating. Instead, it should return the only chat with users with these ids. Am i the one who is facing this issue? Can you provide some ideas, how to manage this?
Thanks in advance!
