So in October there's an Arch conference (https://conf.archlinux.org). I think it would be nice for all attendees to have Yaourt T-shirts available. However, I cannot find an official logo. :disappointed: 

Can I find such a logo somewhere? If not, I'd welcome suggestions on what one might look like.
It looks like someone updated the AUR repo with a package to replace yaourt that isn't this:

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yaourt/

Not sure where best to report this -- flagged the package as out of date there as well
When running `yaourt -Syua`, the "Continue upgrade? [Y/n]" translation does not appear to be working correctly for "pt_PT".

```
==> Continuar atualização ? [S/n]
==> [V]er detalhes do pacote   [M]anualmente selecionar os pacotes
==> --------------------------------------------------------------
==> s
No database errors have been found!
➜  ~
```

Things appear to be translated correctly though: https://github.com/archlinuxfr/yaourt/blob/master/src/po/yaourt/pt.po#L782

Output for `locale` on my system: 

```
➜  ~ locale
LANG=pt_PT.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE=pt_PT.UTF-8
LC_NUMERIC="pt_PT.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="pt_PT.UTF-8"

```

Am I doing something wrong, or is this a bug?

Thanks.
Title is self explanatory addressed issue #383 
running `yaourt -Su --aur --noconfirm` will cause the manual package selection to skip as well, which shouldn't happen.
Open letter to @tuxce @Skunnyk @larchunix and other yaourt developers:

Yaourt has been the most popular AUR helper for quite some time in the past and has been referred to by many upstream developers for installations of packages from the AUR.

There have been many helpers that have effectively superseded yaourt since those times – in terms of features, security concerns, code quality and most importantly user support and feedback.

To many of these projects yaourt has been an inspiration and a useful metric to compare against. Now legacy of yaourt has been continued by [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay).

There are still people using yaourt to this day and I think it is only fair to give an update on where the project is going officially.

Some of notable issues include:
* `-Si` sources PKGBUILD, code to do that is still there [from 2010](https://github.com/archlinuxfr/yaourt/blob/34b5c0b/src/lib/aur.sh#L54-L72) to [today](https://github.com/archlinuxfr/yaourt/blob/fe1bcdd/src/lib/pkgbuild.sh.in#L415-L438) instead of using SRCINFO that is intended to be used that way.
* Inability to correctly solve and build complex dependency chains #186
* Inability to correctly build and install split packages #85
* Exports extra variables preventing successful build process: [aur-general](https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/aur-general/2015-August/031314.html), #309
* Performing [partial upgrades](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_maintenance#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported) on Arch Linux: [since initial commit in 2008](https://github.com/archlinuxfr/yaourt/blob/d30823e/yaourt/yaourt#L1773) till today by always splitting local db sync and upgrade action even when `-Syu` is specified on the command line.

Yaourt does not see much development in years with many issues unresolved and unanswered. Other popular helpers have provided an update in such and other cases and archived github repo so people don't mistakenly seek support, [see links below grey items in the table](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers#Search_and_download) for examples.

Please provide an update and thanks for your long-lasting contribution to the community! You will be remembered :hugs:
In my case I'm using an older nVidia driver (nvidia-340xx) that prevents xorg from being upgraded. `pacman -Syu` correctly ignores the xorg upgrade however `yaourt -Syu` tries to upgrade xorg when it should not. I'm not sure which package contains/added the ignore, probably the nVidia driver.

Here are two patches that make `yaourt` bail out if

* `customizepkg` fails,
* download `PKGBUILD` from ABS fails,
* installation from ABS fails.

`abs.abort-on-error.patch`::http://ix.io/1l0y
`yaourt_customizepkg-abort-on-error.patch`::http://ix.io/1l0z

Please incorporate such changes.

Hello,
