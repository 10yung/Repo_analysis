Source updated for Swift v5
Update the project to the latest version of Swift 4.2 and Xcode 10. 
Also add some padding to example textfield.
There are a bunch of errors when compiling with Swift 4.2 due to UIKit symbols being renamed. Is there a Swift 4.2 branch ready yet?

Hi! When I was trying to implement floating textView I got wrong behaviour that I was trying to fix. 

I tried to set the corner radius for the textfield programatically. But its not affecting for your class field. Can you check and suggest?
Thanks and Regards

If you set the text of the FloatLabelTextView programmatically in for example viewDidAppear, the hint label is not moved up, so the text overlaps the placeholder.

`textView.text = "Text"`

I'd like to change the `placeholderTextColor` but it's a constant not an inspectable variable like `titleTextColour`. This is what I desire. :)

```
    @IBInspectable var placeholderTextColor:UIColor = UIColor.lightGray.withAlphaComponent(0.65) {
        didSet {
            if !isFirstResponder {
                hintLabel.textColor = placeholderTextColor
            }
        }
    }
```
