The Spam Login Filter plugin is a must have on 99% of all sites (at least in my opinion).

Unfortunately, there's no official release of the plugin for Elgg 3 available on the community site. The version on github might work or might not. But having such an important plugin only on github is not at all user-friendly (expecially with unexperienced users in mind).

It's surely not necessary to add many (if any) additional plugins to core. But I think the Spam Login Filter plugin should be considered definitely!
