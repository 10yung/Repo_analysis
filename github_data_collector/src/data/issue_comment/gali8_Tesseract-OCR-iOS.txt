Hello, I am using a very short code preview to detect text from a bill which is in german language. I have placed deu.traineddate file but yet It stuck after reading the text Datum. I though this might be the problem with my image so I uploaded the image into an online OCR ocronline.net and it worked like a charm.
I am sharing the code and the image your help is really appreciated
`import UIKit
import TesseractOCR
class ViewController: UIViewController, G8TesseractDelegate {

    @IBOutlet weak var textView: UITextView!
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        let myImage = UIImage(named: "demoText")
        
        if let tesseract = G8Tesseract(language: "deu") {
            tesseract.pageSegmentationMode = .singleChar
            tesseract.biner
            tesseract.delegate = self
            tesseract.image = UIImage(named: "demoText")
            tesseract.engineMode = .lstmOnly
            print(tesseract.recognizedText)
            print(tesseract.recognizedHOCR(forPageNumber: 1))
            textView.text = tesseract.recognizedText
            
        }
        
        
    }

in my project ,pod 'TesseractOCRiOS', '~> 4.0.0' or pod 'TesseractOCRiOS'  and always failed
I'm trying to OCR a screenshot from an iPhone 11 Pro Max and I'm receiving the following message:

Cannot convert image to Pix with bpp = 64

Fixed the crash if no text could be recognized and the character choices are requested.
Since I updated to the branch https://github.com/gali8/Tesseract-OCR-iOS/tree/macos-support I'm getting the Message `Error: failed to load user-words` and my User-Words file is ignored.

Maybe this relates to https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/2584 which should be fixed in the current version of tesseract.

@hamchapman Could you please update to the current tesseract Version? 
Thank You
I am attempting to use Tesseract-OCR-iOS as a dependency of my cocoapod.

Cocoapods manages the way resources are copied over.  I am struggling with the "tessdata" folder requirement.  Cocoapods flattens the tessdata folder during "pod install" and creates its own build settings and phases.  All of the data files get copied over to the root of the project that adds my pod to their project.  There doesn't appear to be a way to copy the folder over as is.  Is there a workaround to pointing to the datafiles?  It seems that "tessdata" is added as a subfolder if it is missing from the path when using a custom path.

```
func findText (inputImage: UIImage) -> Bool {

    let textLengthThreshold:Int = 10
    
    //TODO: FIX PODSPEC COPY ERROR
    let configDic = [
        kG8ParamTesseditCharBlacklist: " \n",
        kG8ParamTesseditCharWhitelist: "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
       ]
    
    let resourcePath = Bundle.main.resourcePath ?? ""
    if let tesseract = G8Tesseract(language: "eng", configDictionary: configDic, configFileNames: ["Default"], absoluteDataPath: resourcePath, engineMode: .tesseractCubeCombined){

        tesseract.pageSegmentationMode = .auto
        tesseract.image = inputImage
        tesseract.recognize()
        
        let recognizedText:String = tesseract.recognizedText ?? ""
//        print("recognizedText: \"\(recognizedText)\" - len: \(recognizedText.count)")
        
        if (recognizedText.count > textLengthThreshold) {
            return true
        }
    }
    
    return false
}
```

Tesseract Appears to append "tessdata" to whatever path I provide.
I downloaded Tesseract-OCR-iOS-4.0.0.tar.gz and Tesseract-OCR-iOS-3.4.0.tar.gz, but they compile TesseractOCR.framework, the version is 3.03, what is this? Which one is the latest? error actual_tessdata_num_entries_ <= TESSDATA_NUM_ENTRIES:Error:Assert failed:in file
Hi Team ,

Please share the arabic trained data for TesseractOCRiOS (5.0.1) pods version 
When using the initializer `initWithLanguage:configDictionary:configFileNames:absoluteDataPath: engineMode:)` the property `absoluteDataPath` was not properly set, with the value passed as param, before configuring the engine. This would raise/print the error "ERROR! Can't init Tesseract engine." and not find the tessdata folder.

The fix makes sure that the property `absoluteDataPath` is correctly set with the value passed in the init and not the default value (main bundle).
