I have tried to install the bitmap fonts on both Xubuntu and Arch Linux. All fonts work fine, except for all the Proggy fonts and the Opti font. The symbols in these fonts instead show up as boxes with numbers in them.
Hello,

I am new to bitmap fonts.

Curious as to the source and license of the font in bitbuntu picture.
while installing i lived problems with xset because I didn't create fonts.dir, putting this to avoid this problem.
When using `xset fp+ /usr/share/fonts/bitmap` on Linux Mint, it returned the following results:
```
ic2000@mint ~/bitmap-fonts $ xset fp+ /usr/share/fonts/bitmap
xset:  bad font path element (#3), possible causes are:
    Directory does not exist or has wrong permissions
    Directory missing fonts.dir
    Incorrect font server address or syntax
```
