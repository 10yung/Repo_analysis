@EmpireWorld can you check if this is better, then can replace with it?

> This shader works like a charm!! The only thing that looks weird is when I rotate a sprite, then the direction of the shadow is wrong, is there a way to incorporate this into the shader so that the shadow is always in the same direction?

Javascript support has been deprecated in Unity3D as a programming language (note that I'm not pointing to Javascript plugins when you export for WebGL platform). So script templates should be removed from the library or move them to a legacy folder.
Althougt code can be commented in the scripts, could be great to generate automatic documentation for the scripts and host it in the gh-pages branch of this repository.

In this way we can have a presentation web for the library and also the related documentation on how the API works.

I have checked DocFX and it seems it's possible to implement the pipeline for hosting the documentation as stated. See it [here](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1260150/How-To-Integrate-DocFX-API-Documentation-Into-Your). 

DocFX is just an example, but if you find another better solution we could use it too.
Currently the README file of this repository doesn't contain a logo for the library. It could be great to have a custom logo for our repository and give it more visibility.
I have created a new branch called gh-pages that will host the website for the UnityLibrary.
I think this way, we can provide visitors some examples on how to use the scripts that form the library.

**NOTE:** Theme is still pending for approval.

Please include here your opinions on what to include in the web.
A good idea could be to create a new separate repository that uses Github pages as a blog for community members that could be used to include useful tutorials or announcements for the community.
see this and some others, lots of empty lines:
https://github.com/UnityCommunity/UnityLibrary/blob/master/Assets/Shaders/2D/Effects/Glow.shader
for assetbundleloader, https://github.com/UnityCommunity/UnityLibrary/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/AssetBundles/AssetBundleLoader.cs
can use this to clear other cached versions, as mentioned here:

Hi.

We need to test our scripts in Play Mode and Edit Mode using [Unity Test Runner](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/testing-editortestsrunner.html) to make our scripts stable for public usage.

We have **Editor/Tests** folder for adding test scripts, so make a new test script for each script to tests it's functionally.

Also, we should test them ourselves by interaction tests.

Thanks.
