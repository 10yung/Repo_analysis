Hi Geoff, 

Thank you so much for you contributions, they have been very valuable! I have the following issue regarding walkabality/accessability analysis. I've managed to download the POI's of Amsterdam that I'm interested in but when trying to get the network from osm, it produces the following error:  ' Server at www.overpass-api.de returned status code 400 and no JSON data' 

I've tried on multiple locations with different bounding box coordinates however, I can't manage to get it to work. Is there something that I've overlooked?

Kind regards,

Martijn Verhoeven
