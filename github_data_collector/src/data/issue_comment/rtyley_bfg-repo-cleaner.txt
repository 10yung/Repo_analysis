When trying to remove a specific version of a Git LFS file by its OID, I always get the following error:
```
java -jar bfg-1.13.0.jar -bi del_ids my_repo_folder
Error: Option --strip-blobs-with-ids failed when given 'del_ids'. MainException: class org.eclipse.jgit.errors.InvalidObjectIdException(Invalid id: 3cc47cf37608f1e833aaadfd7ad2df6adc2e13d11b29f3f026c260f6a82cf0d7
```

The file del_ids just consists of a single line where the OID (3cc47cf...blahblahblah) is listed which I wanted to remove.
If I do a
`git log -p -S 3cc47cf37608f1e833aaadfd7ad2df6adc2e13d11b29f3f026c260f6a82cf0d7 --all`
I get the commits listed where this file was added and later removed (replaced by a newer version).

I'm desperately trying to get a few Git LFS OIDs out of the history of my git repo to have it clean again.
$ git push -u origin master
To https://github.com/gatlasubbareddy/home.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/gatlasubbareddy/home.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

The command is : 
java -jar /d/bfg-1.13.0.jar --convert-to-git-lfs "*.{png,dll,exe,ppt,pptx,doc,docx,docm,dot,dotx,dotm,xls,(... and many more)}" --no-blob-protection "/direction"

It changes some files but for examples some png files are not changed to lfs and I do not know why.

Also how can I modify the  script (or the command?) so that the endings of the files (.png) will change also if its like .PNG, or .PnG etc.

I am new to git and the lfs system, so I would appreciate every little help. Thank you very much!

I ran:

java -jar bfg.jar --no-blob-protection --strip-blobs-with-ids allblobs.txt  test-repo.

The allblobs.txt file contained one blob sha1 for testing.nupkg (e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391). This file was added but never updated and size was 0 bytes. However, I see the below output indicating text113.txt was also deleted:

        Filename        Git id
        ------------------------------
        testing.nupkg | e69de29b (0 B)
        text113.txt   | e69de29b (0 B)

The end result was that many commits were updated. If I run the command with --delete-files:

java -jar bfg.jar --delete-files testing.nupkg test-repo --no-blob-protection

Then it only deletes the specified file:

        Filename         Git id
        -------------------------------
        testing2.nupkg | e69de29b (0 B)

So looks like --strip-blobs-with-ids behaves differently and its concerning that BFG simply removes the file without any warning. One reason this could be is that Git reuses the same blob as both were 0 bytes and BFG simply is not checking filenames. That said not sure how BFG would know what files to keep and what to delete based on blob id. Nonetheless, the fact that e69de29b was removed, not sure what happens to text113.txt.

Great tool btw and thank you for providing it!
Hey all, 

I'm trying to clean some repos of mine and I'm running the following command to start in the `--mirror` clone of my repo.
`bfg --replace-text <txt_file_what_I_want_removed> --no-blob-protection`

The problem I'm running into is that some of the files changed are functional tests and I would like to somehow ignore these json files. Is there anyway to do that?

Thanks!

Hello,

I'm trying to clean a repo in bitbucket with BFG repo cleaner. When i try to push the cleaned repo, i get this error message:

remote: You are attempting to update refs that are reserved for Bitbucket's pull request functionality. Bitbucket manages these refs automatically, and they may not be updated by users.

I did never create any pull requests, but i see that the so called pull-request-ref points to a commit with the word "pull" in the commit message. Is that an error in the BFG code or is bitbucket the problem? I already found a solution (https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bitbucket-questions/Bitbucket-reserved-refs-when-cleaning-up-with-BFG-tool/qaq-p/702969), but i don't want to set up a new repo, because i'm not the owner of it and i think this might be a bug in BFG. 

Thanks for all advices
Christoph


Is it possible to use the bfg repo cleaner to remove a specific commit(s) from history?
I know it could be done with git alone, but for a scenario when the commit is long in the past it is quite hard and some tool helping with that would be great.
Push failed after cleaning the repo. Followed the same steps as mentioned on the page.

1. git clone --mirror ssh://git@git.trading.com:2222/repo.git 
2. cd repo.git  
3. java -jar ../bfg.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 29M --protect-blobs-from 0.0.1,0.0.2,1.1.5,2.5.0,2.6.2,2.9.0,2.9.1,2.9.2,3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.1.0,3.1.1,3.1.2,3.2.0,3.2.1,3.2.2,3.3.0-DEVELOP,3.3.1-DEVELOP,3.3.2-DEVELOP,3.4.0-DEVELOP,3.4.1-DEVELOP,3.4.2-DEVELOP,3.5.0-DEVELOP,3.5.1-DEVELOP,ARC_341_branchTest,master
4. git reflog expire --expire=now --all 
5. git gc --prune=now --aggressive
6. git push

Please help , how to fix this issue. I have checked the permission on the project. On branch master merge is allowed for maintainer. And i am a maintainer of the project which means i can push to the repo.

It would be nice if I could install bfg through a snap package on my system.
