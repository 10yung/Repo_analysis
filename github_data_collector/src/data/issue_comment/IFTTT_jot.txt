â€¦et to a 'default' position back in view
Is there any way that we can allow the emoji keyboard? For some reason it allows only text. 
I want a way to bring the text to its default size and position

Can we have a support of glow lines??
This gives a hook to logic using Jot library to know when users are drawing.

I am having a problem where the placement of text changes after a device rotation. Drawings work fine. I am drawing and adding text on top of an image. When I rotate the device, the drawings stay in the correct place. But the text moves position. It appears to be a scaling issue as text in the lower right corner moves a lot and text in the upper left does not.

I get the following error:

 pod install

[!] Invalid `Podfile` file: [!] Unsupported options `{:exclusive=>true}` for target `JotDemo`..

[!] xcodeproj was renamed to `project`. Please use that from now on.

Is there any best practice on how to draw on a user provided image using jot?

`CocoaPods` and `Carthage` are awesome tools and make our life really easier, but there are some devs who still don't know how to use them. 

It would be cool to add the _Manual installation_ guide in your `README.md`. You can take a look at my [iOS Readme Template](https://github.com/awesome-labs/iOS-readme-template) to see how you can do it.
