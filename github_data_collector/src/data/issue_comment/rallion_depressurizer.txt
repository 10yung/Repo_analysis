It would be super cool if there was a button that you could press that would launch a random game from a specified category

If this project was re-targeted against .NET Core then it would run natively on OSX and Linux and generally be more portable.

This would resolve #54
LOVE this project, it's pretty amazing. 

However, one of the main reasons I want this is to properly separate my VR games where Steam and the developers consistently failed to tag their VR games with the store tags for VR. Could you add these VR related categories, tags, and game titles to the system?

I am currently following the instructions to scrap the store, so hopefully it will catch them at that point, if it's possible currently.
For some reason, my steam reset my cames to no categories so gonna dive in and fix this. I did use the rallion version, then discovered this new one. Rallion and Theo has the same error.

Here you can see I have no other choice than Genre. 
Also happens from the top selection bar under "auto-cat"

On the bottom status bar it says "Updated 0DB Entries from appinfo. Profile loaded. Failed to update from config files" - if this has any effect?

I seen a post deleting the 2 files in steam/appcache but this had no difference for Depressurizer. 


Found in version 0.7.4.2:

Just Cause 2: Multiplayer Mod / Steam ID 259080 shows up in the depressurizer database and in the Steam client, but does not show up in the main depressurizer games list as something that can be categorized.
