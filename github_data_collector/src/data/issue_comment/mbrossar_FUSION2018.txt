Hi Dear Martin,
At first, I want to thank you for sharing the code u have written for ur paper. I want to add GPS data to your code, and so fuse IMU, GPS and visual data. but I dont exactly know, how can I do that. would you please help me, that how can I do that?

Thanks in advance.


Dear Dr. Martin Brossardï¼Œ
  Hello! 
  I am very interested in this research work. However I have some confusion about the program for the ORB_SLAM_INT database.

  It is excellent that you provide some introduction for the ORB_SLAM_INT database. For example, orb_slam.trackerMain, orb_slam.trackerBis, orb_slam.myTracks and what their role is.

 The second issue I am facing is in ObserveLandmarks function.
 Object tracking is to create a tracking object, initialize and track. Track the corner points directly in the current image frame using trackerMain.step(line 14).
 I did not find the creation and initialization of the object. Whether the creation and initialization of the object was completed in orb_slam.trackerMain or orb_slam.trackerBis.

Thanks!
Dear Martin, 

Thank you very much for sharing the code and the helping out also for the first Issue. 

In function **h** which is widely used in all the Update functions. the syntax is following: 
y_bar = z(1:2,:)./z(3,:); 
but I was having the division issue. So I solved it in the following way
A1= z(1,:);A2= z(2,:);
B= z(3,:);
y = [A1./B;A2./B];

the size of y should be 2x25?.......well it works but I wanted to ask if that is correct.

The second issue I am facing is in **ObserveLandmarks** function. 

The algorithm stopped with the following: 
Error using randsample (line 131)
K must be less than or equal 0 for sampling without
replacement.

Error in ObserveLandmarks (line 45)
    idx = randsample(find(validityMain == 1),1);

Error in mainExperiment (line 205)
            ObserveLandmarks(trackerMain,trackerBis,dirImage,IdxImage,... 

It means my values are greater than zero or complex. Could you please guide me how to solve this issue. 

Thank you very much in anticipation and keep up the great work!!
