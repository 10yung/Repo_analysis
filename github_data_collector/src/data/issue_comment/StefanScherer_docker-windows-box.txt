I'm trying to figure out whether I can use the Vagrant boxes you've built as input for building a registry disk which can be used with [KubeVirt](https://kubevirt.io/).

I was just wondering whether you have any guidance on the redistribution rights for such disks. The gut feeling says that it's probably fine as long as the image is not activated, but I couldn't find any "official" guidance on this.

Do you happen to know where I can find more information (a statement,...) on this?
Add a Vagrant environment with a Windows domain and Active Directory to test Windows Containers in enterprise scenarios.

See https://github.com/Microsoft/Virtualization-Documentation/pull/592 for a work in progress.
