### Description of the issue

When a continuous variable is passed to `x`, the stats pass correct locations to the geoms. However, the geom parameters `width` and `knot.pos` take only fixed values and cannot take the differences between axes into account. This limits their flexibility in such plots, as illustrated below. It should be possible to specify that stratum widths and spline knot positions be proportional to between-axis differences, hence take different values on the two sides of each axis.

### Reproducible example (preferably using `reprex::reprex()`)

``` r
library(ggalluvial)
#> Loading required package: ggplot2
data(vaccinations)

# add survey dates to vaccination data
survey_dates <- data.frame(
  survey = levels(vaccinations$survey),
  start = as.Date(c("2010-09-22", "2015-06-04", "2016-09-27")),
  end = as.Date(c("2010-10-25", "2015-10-05", "2016-10-25"))
)
vaccination_dates <- merge(vaccinations, survey_dates, by = "survey")

# plot with linear flows
ggplot(vaccination_dates,
       aes(x = end, y = freq, stratum = response, alluvium = subject,
           fill = response)) +
  stat_alluvium(geom = "flow", lode.guidance = "forward",
                width = 30, knot.pos = 0) +
  stat_stratum(width = 30) +
  labs(x = "Survey date", y = "Number of respondents")
```

``` r

# plot with x-splined flows
ggplot(vaccination_dates,
       aes(x = end, y = freq, stratum = response, alluvium = subject,
           fill = response)) +
  stat_alluvium(geom = "flow", lode.guidance = "forward",
                width = 90, knot.pos = 360) +
  stat_stratum(width = 90) +
  labs(x = "Survey date", y = "Number of respondents")

Different Sankey diagram, parallel sets plot, and alluvial plot generators render flows between axes using different curves. [This blog post by Jeffrey A. Shaffer](https://www.dataplusscience.com/Sigmoid.html) discusses and showcases several options. More than the current single option should be made available, if possible through the grid package, and the default should be informed by Shaffer's discussion and perhaps also by [this paper by Matthias Schonlau](http://www.schonlau.net/publication/03jsm_hammockplot.pdf) introducing the hammock plots implemented in ggparallel.
### Description of the issue

Diagrams for large datasets take a long time to render. The bottlenecks might be due to inefficiencies in the code. Profile the code, identify the bottlenecks, and benchmark alternative implementations. (See [this chapter](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Profiling.html) in _Advanced R_.)

### Reproducible example (preferably using `reprex::reprex()`)

(Need a suitable public dataset.)
For cases in which the strata have no intrinsic order, an option should be available to arrange the strata at each axis, perhaps even using different orders at different axes when the strata are repeated (maybe this should be allowed or not according to an additional parameter), in a way that minimizes the number of flow overlaps. The `majors` example in the vignette is a good candidate for such an option.

A heuristic algorithm should suffice, and the concept is general enough that it might already be in use somewhere. I won't have time to write one for a while, and it might be worth writing in C and calling via `Rcpp`.
Interpolate aesthetics along flows (between adjacent axes). The aesthetics should interpolate along the splines at the same rate as the vertical positions.
