I have met an error while executing "jupyter nbextension install --py nbexamples --sys-prefix"
```bash
NotADirectoryError: [Errno 20] Not a directory: '/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/nbexamples-0.3.1-py3.6.egg/nbexamples/static'
```

hello,
I saw your documentation for the nbexamples and it seems that it can meet my needs. 
Is it possible to install this extension on the jupyterlab with jupyterhub?
thanks.
Hi,

I'm setting up a jupyterhub deployment for use as an online learning environment.  I want to test your nbexamples package to provide students with the learning module (as the read only example) and for them to save a writable copy into their home dirs before completing it and saving it for review.

I've followed the install process, however, the config steps are all listed for jupyter_notebook_config.py, which I'm not using.  Instead I've added them as lines in the jupyterhub_config.py

As you can probably guess, it's not working.  I don't get any error message on the '--debug' from jupyterhub, I just can't see any 'Example' tab in the notebook directory page.

I'm running this on RHEL 6.8 vm with Py2.7, Py3.4 and R kernels

Can you advise?

I have nbexamples configured with jupyterhub and it's working great, but would like to persist my notebooks outside the server file system.

I would like to use https://github.com/quantopian/pgcontents which replaces the `c.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class`.  Do you know how nbexamples will handle this?

The metadata of an example notebook could list certain names to be templated. When the user fetches a copy of the notebook, the dialog box to provide an input field that will fill in the template, leading to the GET request:

```
/examples/fetch?example_id=foo.ipynb&dest=my-copy.ipynb&my_field=bar&another_field=aardvark
```
