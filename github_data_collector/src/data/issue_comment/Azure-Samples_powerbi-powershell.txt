In issue #5, it's pointed out in a [comment](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/powerbi-powershell/issues/5#issuecomment-365752905) that the `Invoke-RestMethod` parameter names have long dashes, which causes problems. This changes the en dashes to dashes (`–` to `-`), which fixed the error.
Hello - can you please let me know how to execute this in a runbook?  It works using powershell on the desktop, however, when I try to run it in a runbook, I get the error below.  Thank you!

I successfully ran PowerShell script for calling the Power BI REST APIs following this instruction from Github. https://github.com/Azure-Samples/powerbi-powershell

Does somebody know a way to send an email alert when the process above finish? Like sending out an alert of the result of the refreshing. Please help!
Outdated script with deprecated functions. 
Cloud Shell only supports Az. A number of function names have changed.
Hi,

Please advise how to use JSON template in my power Bi Desktop?

Please share and article if any.

Please copy or allow to copy the permissions to the workspace as well and any schedules created.  Basically i want to use this to "convert" even though it copies the workspace from v1 to v2.  So I want an identical copy of everything in the workspace.
Upload Application uploads the local application into the specified Workspace and creates it if it does not exist. it uses Power BI PowerShell CMDLETs.
@guyinacube  Not an issue per se but can you post the updateparameters script from your vid?
AcquireToken signature changed in v3 of the ADAL library. Now instead of a string for the final parameter, it requires a Platform Parameter Object. Made async changes as AcquireToken was deprecated in v3, replaced with AcquireTokenAsync. BindToGateway Endpoint has changed for takeover-dataset.ps1 and now expects the gateway id in POST body.  Added variables and serialization to handle this.
Hi,
I am using the manageRefresh.ps1, it works if I type user and password on the pop-up.
However, for running after the ETL, I would need it to run unattended.

How do I add user and password for unattended execution to the script?

I understand that like all requests to the Power BI REST API, I will have to attach an AAD access token. But I dont know how to and the Power BI REST API authentication documentation is not something I am familiar with. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/get-azuread-access-token) 

Thanks
