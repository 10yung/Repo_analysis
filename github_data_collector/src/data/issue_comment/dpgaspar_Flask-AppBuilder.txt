Apologies in advance if this is the wrong place for this sort of question.  What is the proper way to filter the list of model classes below called newtonproductcost?  I only want the children with the same product_id.  Can I apply a filter to the relationship query so that I only get costs with the product_id?

Thanks in advance.

```
class Newtonproductpo(Model):
    po_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    product_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(Newtonproduct.product_id), nullable=False)
    newtonproduct = relationship(Newtonproduct)
    cost_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(Newtonproductcost.cost_id), nullable=False)
    newtonproductcost = relationship(Newtonproductcost)
```

Sometimes a column cannot be ordered, and the app panics. This gives a friendly warning and renders the list without the ordering applied.

Would you have an example that shows how I can access data from a post request from the out of the box crud forms and then change the value or add data to the post request before writing it back to the database?

Sample would be adding the username of the user who send the form before saving it to the database. 

Or computing 2 values from the post request and saving the result to the database as well. 

In generally I would be curious how we can do computed fields in the standard crud forms?

Thank you!

Hello,

i am not sure, where to address a simply question, so I will try it here:

I have a database which contains a column named "department". Every row contains a 1 or 2 for the different departments. I want to connect it with the user roles. So a user from department 1 should just see the data with "1" in column "department". Can someone help how to realize it? I didn`t find a solution to connect user roles with a specific value of a variable.

Best wishes

I want to ask if it is possible to get SQL views with autoload=True function like below.

some_view= Table("some_table", some.metadata, autoload=True,autoload_with=some_Engine)
An action of a related view does not work in a view with multiple related views.
Because there are multiple forms with the identical id "action_form".
I addressed this problem by extending the "AdminActions" with the viewname.
Now it is possible to find the right "form" to submit.
While trying to authenticate through LDAP on superset, Flask-AppBuilder seems to require a AUTH_LDAP_BIND_USER, but my OpenLDAP server doesn't require one.
Can't login if not set.

My config.py 

```
AUTH_TYPE = AUTH_LDAP
AUTH_ROLE_ADMIN = 'Admin'
AUTH_USER_REGISTRATION = True
AUTH_LDAP_SERVER = "ldap://ldapcluster.corecaixa:489"
AUTH_LDAP_SEARCH = "ou=People,o=dddd"
AUTH_LDAP_BIND_USER = "uid=someuser,ou=People,o=dddd"
AUTH_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD = "password"
