Whenever I go to the `CodeGlance` settings panel in Settings, it is marked as being changed, and "Apply" is always clickable.

I suspect that there is a value being compared that gets cast to another value, and so never passes the equality check to itself.
Hello CodeGlance Team,

First of all, I wanted to say a big thank you for this project.
This is a very helpful.

If I may, I would like to as for a request which is widely adopted in Xcode, and is very helpful.
In Xcode, if there is a tag: // MARK: Something

The Xcode Code Glance will display it with a different font (much bolder)
Please see the screenshot as well.

This allow from the Code Glance mini map, a faster and clearer way to to just clock and get to the lines of code needed.

Thank you so much!

When opening a TypeScript file the TypeScript Service starts and spawns at least one nodejs process. The last week I've noticed that up to 5-10 processes were started and they keep growing in memory usage using up all physical memory and then using swap disk until it's used 30-40 GB causing my MacBookPro to freeze and eventually reboot - only to restart IntelliJ at the same point and again starting node processes.

I've been searching high and low for the cause and thought it was a problem with the NodeJs plugin or the version of Node. But when I finally disabled the CodeGlance plugin and restarted IntelliJ the problem went away.

I'm using IntelliJ IDEA ULTIMATE 2019.2 - but had the problem also with 2019.1. NodeJS 12.8.1 as well as 12.5.0 tested.
Visual Studio has the ability to show a preview of the code at a certain part of the file when hovering over the minimap, it would be cool to have that functionality in this plugin too.

It looks like this in VS:

Similar to #186, choosing the "Accurate" render style doesn't persist correctly and will occasionally flip back to "Clean" even within the same session in the IDE.

Hi, I noticed my WebStom had spikes of 100% cpu usage, and tracked it down to this plugin.
Might have to do with big JSON files with items collapsed? I don't have any shareable test-files, sorry. But my file is 14000 lines long, hierarchical JSON.


It just doesn't appear as it should.

Linux 4.19.32-1-MANJARO` and `CodeGlance 1.5.4`) it is still not working, I only see the one occurrence of the searched term that I selected. 
Additionally it would be awesome if it would also work with the ideavim-search and if you could implement the feature to always highlight the other occurrences of the word under your cursor.
