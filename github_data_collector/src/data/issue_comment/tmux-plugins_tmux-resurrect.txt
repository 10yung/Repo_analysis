Looks like @houghjosh isn't active for a few years, so I created a new PR which closes #163 

This saved me from reconfiguring my 8 windows today.
Keeping different status such as work/study/... not only the last so that users can launch tmux and go to familiar status conveniently.

for example:
    prefix + Ctrl-s --name work
    prefix + Ctrl-s --name study

when i launch tmux , if i want to go to work/study status: prefix + Ctrl-r --name work/study.

I know some complex bash scripts can do this work.Does tmux-resurrect support this now?
Thanks for creating and maintaining this plugin!

- I have a `Session.vim` file in a directory.
- my tmux config file contains the line `set -g @resurrect-strategy-vim 'session'`.

**Steps**
In the directory with the session file, open a file using `vi`.

**Actual Behaviour**
`vi` does not get called with the `-S` flag, whereas if had saved the tmux-session with containing a `vim` command, it does get called with the `-S` flag.

**Expected Behaviour**
`vi` to be resurrected with the `-S` flag
`vi` and `vim` commands get treated the same when resurrected

Let me know if there is any other information you need.

There are clearly workarounds on my end - just raising this in case it is indeed unexpected behaviour, or if this is just me not understanding something properly.
In the past, tmux-resurrect would drop me into the same window I was in at the time of saving the session. For example, given a layout like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/344116/70622267-d4511600-1c1b-11ea-9a96-eb96982681e6.png)

...I would still be on pane 3 after attaching to the restored session. Now, however, I am always on the first window (in this case, 0).

Is there a way to restore the previous behavior? Could something be interfering?
Hi there,

First of all, thanks for the great work - tmux-resurrect has been a huge help and time-saver to me!
I noticed something odd, which I am unsure if it's supposed to be like that or if I am missing some kind of configuration to fix it.

In order to restore my windows/panes, I start the terminal, enter a new tmux session with `tmux` and run tmux-resurrect with `ctrl+b ctrl+r`. It restores everything just fine, but in the end there will always be that originally created tmux-window with `name: 0` that I created in order to be able to restore the other windows in the first place.
Is there a way to have that auto-killed after restoring my windows/panes?
The changes basically replace the use of *pane_index* by *pane_id*. This guarantees that the environment variable `TMUX_PANE` is consistent across restores, and allows to use it as index to get separate history files for different panes.
I have this on my `.bashrc`, to set the right history filename in tmux and to update it on every command
```
HISTFILE=${HISTFILE}${TMUX_PANE:+.${TMUX_PANE#%}}
[ x$TMUX_PANE != x ] && PROMPT_COMMAND="${PROMPT_COMMAND:+$PROMPT_COMMAND$'\n'}history -a"
```
Main problem was restoring directory & content of the very first pane (`%0'), but I've included an alias for that.
When I found this plugin, I quickly tried to enable the restoring of pane contents, and went to `docs/restoring_pane_contents.md`. 

Here, it mentions that `default-command` shouldn't contain `||` or `&&` operators, and you write that `set -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l $SHELL"` should be an acceptable alternative.
The problem with this, is that `set -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l $SHELL"` can cause Tmux to crash before even starting.

I had that problem, which means that when running `tmux new`, it just exited immediately, and the (almost) same problem is seen in [tmux exits immediately after starting](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/128190/tmux-exits-immediately-after-starting).
Perhaps change that recommendation, or at the least write that this can cause problems?
After updating tmux to 3.0, restoring ends up with a dead server and the following message: `[server exited unexpectedly]`
This is a very strange problem, because it makes no sense and happens randomly.

e.g. one tmux session, 3 windows, 2 panes in windows 1 and 2 each (5 panes total).

When I create my windows and panes, everything is fine. Saving also works, but when I restore my session, some of the panes (and this happens randomly), usually 2 or 3, but mostly different ones do not have a login session, but just bash with the default prompt and none of my settings (aliases, PATH modifications, ...). When I kill the tmux server and restore again, this could happen on other panes than it did the first time, and the panes that had that issue before are fine.
This tells me that it is not inherently the pane's fault or how bash is spawned.

Additional info: I'm using bash5 from Macports, which is added to `/etc/shells` and I've used `chsh` to switch the default shell for my user. Although I have seen this behavior with the standard shell that comes with the OS as well.

I suspect that there is a race condition when opening a bunch of shells at the same time. We either hit a lock that prevents another starting shell to read the proper profile, or another side effect creeps up somewhere.

Has anyone seen this problem as well and is there a solution?

I noticed that your awesome plugin was not saving all my ssh sessions.  Although my use case was different than those in #264, I added a comment there with my issue. The following PR builds on what I originally posted there.

cheers
