Hi, Could you please give more information on how to run demo.m. I have never used matlab, so it would be great if you could give an example of the commands used to train and test.

And , is it possible to execute this project on Octave.

Thanks
I am very interested in your work and I would like to regenerate the results on my data. A python version is the most suitable for me. Any date of release fixed yet?
Hi, I've been reading your article recently and been very interested in your research. Your research is very prospective.  I'd like to know more about it. The Python version of the code is better for me. Thank you. Please expose the code as soon as possible.
