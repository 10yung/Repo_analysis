Not strictly a requirement for a bootable disk, but we've now got 6 GO9P* scripts with a lot of similar code, and 2 have been added while working on image creation.  (There are other files in util/ that look related too...)

We should consolidate them all into a single .go script with sensible args.
If you create the Harvey USB image according to the steps in the wiki below, it can't seem to find the fossil filesystem on the USB stick.  This occurs when 'Harvey OS (Install)` is chosen as the boot option from the USB stick.  This needs to be fixed.

Make drawterm work when booting from a Harvey image.

1. Create an image: https://github.com/Harvey-OS/harvey/wiki/Creating-Harvey-Image
2. Tweak install scripts so drawterm is set up automatically
3. Document any changes to setup process in above wiki page.

(From alvaro on slack: 'drawterm (and I guess anything which needs auth) doesn't work against qcow2 img standalone cpu generated once it boots')
If you follow the instructions on the wiki, it takes a very long time to create the image: https://github.com/Harvey-OS/harvey/wiki/Creating-Harvey-Image

This issue is to do some high level profiling and see where the slowness of copying files is really coming from.
I attempted to clone the repository to my Windows computer but was met with the error: "cannot create directory at '386/bin/aux': Invalid argument". Turns out Windows has reserved folder names and "./aux" is one of them. It might be a good idea to change the name of this folder to make it easier for windows users to clone the repo.
Document steps to set up server at a high level (these will differ between environments), and how to set up the PXE config.

Document steps required to boot Harvey from a USB stick, with all files hosted via ufs server.
Currently, the Go port on Harvey is not a first class port. We need to address the following -

For now, we build Go by setting GOOS=plan9. Necessary changes have to be made so that we can use GOOS=harvey instead. Efforts should be made so GOOS=harvey should imply GOOS=plan9. This should in line with the way GOOS=android "implies" linux.
We should be able to attach and detach repeatedly to the same process or to others in the same session without any problems.
