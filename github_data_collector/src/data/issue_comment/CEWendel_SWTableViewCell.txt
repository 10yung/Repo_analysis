If you want to just show a single swipe menu in TableView can try with my sample:

Create a property the keep last cell has shown the menu.

```objc
@interface MyViewController ()<UITableViewDelegate,UITableViewDataSource ,SWTableViewCellDelegate>

@property (nonatomic, strong) SWTableViewCell *lastSWCell;

@end
```

Then implement this code to hide the menu of the last cell has been shown.

```objc
-(void) swipeableTableViewCell:(SWTableViewCell *)cell scrollingToState:(SWCellState)state{
    if (state != kCellStateCenter) {
        if (self.lastSWCell) {
            [self.lastSWCell hideUtilityButtonsAnimated:YES];
        }
        self.lastSWCell = cell;
    }
}
```

If you want to hide the menu when user scrolled the TableView implement this:

```objc
- (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)scrollView{
    if (self.lastSWCell) {
        [self.lastSWCell hideUtilityButtonsAnimated:YES];
        self.lastSWCell = nil;
    }
}
```

Avoid that didSelectedRowAtIndexPath of UITableView does not respond the second time when tapping the same Cell

Perhaps this is also the same problem
Menu for cell doesn't appear #184
The “Swift Language Version” (SWIFT_VERSION) build setting must be set to a supported value for targets which use Swift. This setting can be set in the build settings editor.
fix bug: if call "-(void)setRightUtilityButtons: WithButtonWidth:" to change the buttonWidth while scrollView is still scrolling, scrollView's contentOffset will be wrong.
When using automatic layout（pure code: Masonry），cell contentView does not follow scrolling 

when i had set [cell showSwipe:MGSwipeDirectionLeftToRight animated:false]; in tableview cellForRowAtIndexPath method,  left button is visible but cell is not visible. cell have been blacked.

Console:
`carthage update`
```
*** Checking out SWTableViewCell at "0.3.7"
*** Skipped building SWTableViewCell due to the error:
Dependency "SWTableViewCell" has no shared framework schemes

If you believe this to be an error, please file an issue with the maintainers at https://github.com/CEWendel/SWTableViewCell/issues/new

```

Is there anything for me to do to fix it?
  
Getting this build error on Xcode 9.
I've used this library in one of our projects. It's working fine until iOS 10.
When I've updated to iOS 11 - it's showing a weird behaviour.

1. Once I launch the table view, the cell is not visible, it's going to the right and upon swipe the cell and it's content is visible.
2. Even though the data is invisible, didSelectRowAtIndexPath is calling.

If possible, Can you please look into this issue and let us know if there's any quick fix for this.
Hi team,
How to increase the button height? I'm not able to change the swipeable button height.

Added following line of code 

// height constraint

> [self addConstraints:[NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormat:@"V:[button(==50)]" options:0 metrics:nil views:NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings(button)]];
