It seems as though no matter what keys I filter for, since I loaded a redis with a custom rdb there's no way to analyze this file with your parser. I'm curious if you could provide a mode where it's automatically skipped like rdb --command protocolskiperrors 

Example of failed command rdb  --command  protocol -k 'anything'  customrdb  > /dev/null 

```

I'm trying to have a trial with free licence of rdb-tools v0.9.42. But I could not successfully add my redis instance in remote server.  I tried to use my local redis-cli which could successfully connect my remote Redis server, but rdb-tools failed.  There shows 500 Internal server Error, but no detail error log I could find.

"thee" to "the" in two lines.
As the redis-memory-for-key will call [dump](https://redis.io/commands/dump) command of the redis

For large key, the dump command will block redis as it's Time complexity. So this command is very dangerous for production environment.

>Time complexity: O(1) to access the key and additional O(N*M) to serialized it, where N is the number of Redis objects composing the value and M their average size. For small string values the time complexity is thus O(1)+O(1*M) where M is small, so simply O(1).
I didn't find the `stream` struct in this [wiki](https://github.com/sripathikrishnan/redis-rdb-tools/wiki/Redis-RDB-Dump-File-Format), could you add this?
Hi, 
    kindly please help check the  parser problem, It seems the problem of rdb format, how can I cope with the source code?

Hi,

how can i see web-base control panel for Redis-server , Please help me out.

I have a redis dump file which is around `30MB`

When I run `rdb -c json dump.rdb` I get a json list of my keys, with no data in them, for example:

```
[{
"key_1":{},
"key_2":{}}]
```

The file is definitely not empty, there is plenty of data in there. Any ideas?

I am using `Redis server v=5.0.0` and  rdbtools version: `0.1.13`
