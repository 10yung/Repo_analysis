hi, I installed btfs from homebrew, this is the version:
```
$ btfs -v
btfs version: 2.18
libtorrent version: 1.2.0.0
OSXFUSE 3.8.3
FUSE library version: 2.9.7
fuse: no mount point
```
I have mounted and successfully downloaded a file from a torrent and then, when I did `umount <dir>`, everything hung up: btfs, umount process, all processes trying to read that folder and its parent. I had to `kill -9` it. Since i was running it with `-d` switch, here's its log on exit:
```

```
Now the problem is I cannot mount any torrent, here's what's happening:
```

```
I tried deleting its temp folder which is apparently `~/btfs` and this changed nothingâ€¦
Hi

I want to use btfs on a Live distribution (Debian) : all is on memoy.

Currently, i read files stored on a nfs server. 
Now, i want to use a bittorrent server.

But, btfs does very verbose logs : with 5 minutes, all the memory is full

With the help of the doc of libtorrent, i tried to disable the logs : in the file btfs.cc, i replaced
```
                libtorrent::alert::tracker_notification |
                libtorrent::alert::stats_notification |  
                libtorrent::alert::storage_notification |
                libtorrent::alert::progress_notification |
                libtorrent::alert::status_notification | 
                libtorrent::alert::error_notification | 
                libtorrent::alert::dht_notification |
                libtorrent::alert::peer_notification;
```
by
`0;`

The program builds and runs. But, the files are not shared.

How can i remove these very verbose logs ?

Thanks.

Can we specify the location of the log file in /etc/default/btfs?

It would be cool to be able to use BTFS with I2P torrents :)

Maybe #9 could be updated to add I2P support? Because libtorrent-rasterbar support I2P_proxy option: http://www.libtorrent.org/reference-Settings.html and you could also add this option `allow_i2p_mixed` http://www.libtorrent.org/reference-Settings.html#allow_i2p_mixed

While I have been able to determine that traffic is going over the proxy, I haven't been able to test if any packets are leaking. If someone could figure out how to test for that it would be great.
