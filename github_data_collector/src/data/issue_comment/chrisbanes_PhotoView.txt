I'm loading an imageview with picasso to specific width and height.
```
Picasso.get().load(imageUri)
                    .error(R.drawable.image1)
                    .resize(width, height)
                    .into(imageView);
```

No I want to be able to pinch the imageview so that image size becomes larger or smaller than initial image size.

Now I can only pitch the image inside its initial image size.
How can I do it?

I found that when I drag photo fast ,I can receive an Action_UP event from onFlingListener, but when i drag very slowly，I can't receive Action_UP event，And i dont know where i can get that Action_UP event. Hoping for reply
Thanks in advanced!
we are looking forward to use the new version 2.3.0, and wondering when it will be released, if there's any plan, please let us know, thanks again.
suggest use uri to load image
I would like to be able to overscroll a `PhotoView`. For example, if a user zooms in and scrolls all the way to the bottom of the image contained in the `PhotoView`, and then keeps pulling the image upward, I would like the `PhotoView` to realize it has scrolled to the edge of its bottom bound, and then essentially translate upwards. Currently you cannot do this, in this example the bottom of the image cannot be scrolled beyond the bottom of the `PhotoView` itself.

I tried implementing this custom, by wrapping the `PhotoView` in a custom `ViewGroup`, and overriding `requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent` in the `ViewGroup`, but from what I've gathered from logs I added, `PhotoView` doesn't call that method in a way that makes it easy to implement what I want
I am looking for face Aware Image-view. Instead of cropping Image or simply center crop scale type of Imageview,  the face should detect in image-view and adjust face to center of Image-view. Is Photoview provide such functionality? I looked some references but not got success:

I got Library in IOS but not getting anything in Android.

Can anyone help me out? Thank You.
I zoom in and translate the photoView，then I saved current DisplayMatrix by 
Matrix m = photoView.getDisplayMatrix()

After system configuration changed, the PhotoView  re-created, I wish to restore the scale and translate state. 

I called photoView.setDisplayMatrix(m), but it does not match before.


In class PhotoView, variable 'pendingScaleType' is always null.
There isn't any assigment in source code. Thus in method 'init()' 

```java
        if (pendingScaleType != null) {
            setScaleType(pendingScaleType);
            pendingScaleType = null;
        }
```

called in constructor method, the snippet cannot be executed in.

Similarly,  overrided method 'setScaleType()' has if branch.

```java
    @Override
    public void setScaleType(ScaleType scaleType) {
        if (attacher == null) {
            pendingScaleType = scaleType;
        } else {
            attacher.setScaleType(scaleType);
        }
    }
```

'attacher' is initialized in 'init()' method called by whichever constructor method. So 'attcher' is impossible null,  and 'pendingScaleType' assignment branch cannot be executed.

Am I wrong??!
