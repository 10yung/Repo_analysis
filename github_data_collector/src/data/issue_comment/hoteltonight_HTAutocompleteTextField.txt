It looks like this project hasn't been updated for a while, but I'm trying it now and it's still working nicely.

One thing I don't understand is how a user can decline the autocomplete entry. For example, what if the autocomplete data includes "Samuel" but the user wants to enter "Sam"? I don't see a way to do that.

Issue #31 seems to ask about this, but the solution given there was to enable the autocomplete button. I tried that, but that didn't seem to provide a capability of declining the autocompletion.

I suppose a small tweak to resignFirstResponder could skip committing the autocompletion if the button is visible. In that case, clicking the button would be the only way to accept the autocompletion, and clicking outside the field would decline it. Alternatively, I could replace the autocomplete button with a different button that cancels the autocompletion. Is there a better, built-in way?
How can i force user to enter text which is in my datasource only.


`HTAutocompleteTextField` was created to be as a single-purpose `UITextField` subclass that enables a specific type of text suggestion and autocompletion. Since its inception, however, it has strayed from its original purpose and suffered a bit of feature creep. The intention of this `2.0` release is to right the course, making this library both quicker to understand and easier to use.

With these changes, I am proposing that we link to useful alternate text suggestion and autocompletion libraries (including forks of HTAutocompleteTextField) instead of accepting Pull Requests that alter functionality of this library. In other words, I am proposing that future contributions be in the form of non-functional changes (such as bug fixes, updates to support new iOS SDKs, and refactoring).

I'm doing this:
self.institutionName = [[HTAutocompleteTextField alloc] initWithFrame:self.frame];
self.institutionName.autocompleteDataSource = self;

And the function textField:completionForPrefix:ignoreCase is not getting called...

If I use the setDefaultAutocompleteDataSource the function gets called but i can't set the autocompleteType or anything, idk if i'm doing something wrong...  

Ps.: I'm using a UIView, not UIViewController. 

I had a problem with names appearing as N(Null). I tracked it down to my datasource returning nil instead of @"".  As this is easy to protect against, it would seem useful to do so:  

Change line 234 in `commitAutoCompleteText` of `HTAutocompleteTextField.m` from

`if ([self.autocompleteString isEqualToString:@""] == NO`

to

`if (self.autocompleteString.length > 0`

as you do in `refreshAutocompleteText`

It could be really cool if this could support searchbar

Auto completion of addresses using Google Places API
