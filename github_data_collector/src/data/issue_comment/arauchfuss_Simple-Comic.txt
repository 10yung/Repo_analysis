Though @arauchfuss built a great tool it seems like they're not around here much to run things. (No judgment, just observation.) There are several bugs and PRs, [including important Catalina fixes](https://github.com/arauchfuss/Simple-Comic/issues/123), outstanding that should be merged going forward.

@arauchfuss if you do get this message please weigh in: can you appoint some other people to help manage the project here? Otherwise, is anyone in the community interested in creating a fork we can work together on?

My experience in Mac coding is limited but I can volunteer a bit of time to organize and evangelize if other people would be on board for such an endeavor.

Thanks All.

This is a fix for https://github.com/arauchfuss/Simple-Comic/issues/124
To fix this, (1 of 3) in TSSTInfoWindow.h , change:

```
@interface TSSTInfoWindow : NSPanel {}
```

to

```
@interface TSSTOuterInfoView : NSView {
  float lastDiameter;
}
- (void)resizeToDiameter:(float)diameter;
@end

@interface TSSTInfoWindow : NSPanel {
  IBOutlet TSSTOuterInfoView *outerView;
}
```

and (2 of 3) in TSSTInfoWindow.m with the other imports, add:
```
#import <QuartzCore/CAShapeLayer.h>
```

in `- (void)centerAtPoint:(NSPoint)center` add:
```
 [outerView resizeToDiameter:frame.size.width];
```


 in  `- (void)resizeToDiameter:(float)diameter`
add:
```
  [outerView resizeToDiameter:diameter];
```

and above `@implementation TSSTInfoView`

add
```
@implementation TSSTOuterInfoView

- (void)awakeFromNib {
  [super awakeFromNib];

  CALayer *baseLayer = [[CALayer alloc] init];
  baseLayer.backgroundColor = NSColor.clearColor.CGColor;
  self.superview.layer = baseLayer;
}

- (void)resizeToDiameter:(float)diameter {
  if (lastDiameter != diameter) {
    CAShapeLayer *shapeLayer = [[CAShapeLayer alloc] init];
    CGPathRef path = CGPathCreateWithEllipseInRect(NSMakeRect(0, 0, diameter, diameter), nil);
    shapeLayer.path = path;
    CGPathRelease(path);
    self.superview.layer.mask = shapeLayer;
    lastDiameter = diameter;
  }
}
@end
```

(3 of 3):  in TSSTSessionWindow.xib, in the Loupe Panel hierarchy, click on the middle View (between the Loupe Panel and the Zoom View, and use the Identity Inspector to change the class from `NSView` to `TSSTOuterInfoView` .  Control-drag from the Loupe Panel to the Outer View to connect the `outerView` IBOutlet

This fix uses CoreGraphics Layer Masking to mask the Loupe to just its circular region.


Nothing happens when I open a .cbz or .cbr file in Simple Comic.

File > Open, File > Open Recent, and View > Status Bar menus are available, but all others are disabled.
QuickComic seems to have died under macOS 10.15 Catalina. No thumbnails or previews generate in the Finder (I can do so via the command line though). In fact the icon is even blank in the Get Info dialog (possibly a separate bug). But yeah, no previews in the Finder at all.
Add Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese localizations.
I've been getting crash notices from QuickLookSatellite that QuickComic has been crashing. Usually several times a day.

Attached is the crash log. SimpleComic 1.7 on macOS Mojave 10.14
[crash log](https://github.com/arauchfuss/Simple-Comic/files/2475259/crash.log)
- Updated project settings to recommended in Xcode 9.4.1
- int -> NSInteger, intValue -> integerValue
- Added imageUTIs, imageExtensionsFromUTIs methods (needed when upgrading the deprecated method `imageFileTypes`. Replacement method `imageTypes` returns `utis` now)
Hi - after the most recent update of High Sierra, Simple Comic gives the error "file not found" whenever I try to open a file, or when I start up de program without opening a file.

When I close the error, it immediately pops up again, and I can only exit the program by forcing it to quit.

Any ideas?
