Hey,

Are you guys going to create the feature which allows one to integrate their calendar with their GitScrum project calendars?

Cheers,

PB

When logging time, the time at GitScrum's headquarters in Europe is used rather than the user's. For example, I logged time on a task for a couple hours this morning in the Eastern Time Zone. The start and end time are listed as 13:32 and 16:27. Several hours later, it is 1:22pm where I live. 

This is a suggested enhancement. It would be better to have no timestamps at all and only show the duration of time worked than to have timestamps from an irrelevant time zone.

Ideally, the user could select their timezone from within GitScrum. This would account for cases when VPNs or proxy servers are used.

## Context

Having accurate task timestamps would be useful to keep an eye on when team members are working on tasks. It would enable a more holistic project management approach.

There isn't `server.php` file to run project

## Detailed description

First of all, thanks for GitScrum!

I've got a suggestion / request: would you be up for using [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com) to automatically create dependency update PRs for this GitScrum? I ran it against my fork and it generated [these PRs](https://github.com/greysteil/laravel-gitscrum/pulls). I'll port the `renatomarinho/laravel-page-speed` PR over to this repo now.

## Context

I built Dependabot, but I'm honestly only suggesting it because I hope it can save you some time. I'd love any feedback, and obviously having a repo like GitScrum using Dependabot would help boost its profile, but if it's not helpful to you then it's not really worth anything.

The thinking behind Dependabot is that by doing lots of small dependency updates (each time a new version is released) the process becomes much easier to manage (and safer to deploy). It's basically a tool to make agile for dependency management possible.

# Implementation

You can install Dependabot from [here](https://github.com/apps/dependabot) or [here](https://github.com/marketplace/dependabot) if you decide to give it a try. 🙏

this fixes the 'invalid public' error you get when logging in, ... there might be some changes in the gitlab api

<!-- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->

## Detailed description

GitLab keeps giving an error when you try to sync repo's.
## Context

It seems they have changed the way the API responds. You need to edit this file
app/Classes/Gitlab.php on line 51
change
            'is_private' => $repo->public == true,
to something like
            'is_private' => $repo->visibility,
because the $repo->public is no longer returned it is now visibility that is returned.

* Version used (e.g. PHP 7.1, HHVM 3):
