**Expected Behaviour**

Shimmer should occur

**Steps to reproduce it**

1. Create a view controller in storyboard
2. Create views and outlets to the views.
3. Set the background of the view to a different color and the created subviews to a different color.
4. Connect the outlets.

**Would you like to work on the issue?**
No thank you.
```

import UIKit
import LoadingShimmer

class BugTest2ViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet var blackview: UIView!
    @IBOutlet var greenview: UIView!
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        LoadingShimmer.startCovering(blackview)
        LoadingShimmer.startCovering(greenview)
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }
}
```


**Actual Behaviour**

Currently, it is supporting normal views and `UITableView`.

**Expected Behaviour**

Add support for `UICollectionView`


**Screenshots of the issue**

**Would you like to work on the issue?**

Anyone can take the issue. Feel free to open the PR.

Currently, the framework is lagging unit testing. Add some unit test.
