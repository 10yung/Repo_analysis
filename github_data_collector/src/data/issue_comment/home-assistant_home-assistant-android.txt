**Description of problem:**
I noticed that the app uses a lot of data when I do not actively use it. For example, my phone reports that the app has used over 1.5 GB of mobile data since 1-1. I am quite sure that I don't use the app very often when I am not connected to a WiFi network, so this high number surprises me. I suspect that it has something to do with a few camera integrations I use (I cannot think of something else, to be honest).

I thought of disabling background data, but then location tracking doesn't work anymore.

Currently the status bar theme is pulled from the current globally set theme.  In order to get the theme set for the device an enhancement has been requested of the front end to provide that information.

**Description of problem:**
If I click on an input zone, to enter the alarm code for example (Panel Card Alarm: https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/alarm-panel/) the virtual keyboard appears then disappears immediately.

Edit : After much research, "custom: layout-card" is the issue. When the keyboard appears this changes the size of the webview (or of the content of the webview) and "custom: layout-card" causes the page to reload in order to adapt the size of the columns.

**Description of problem:**
We should support PiP when a camera is opened and the video stream starts.  

It also looks like the full screen icon is disabled, that may be the reason why PiP is not working?

**Description of problem:**
Once I logout from HA, the integration for the phone disappear from the list, as soon as I login again a new one is created (while the previous one doesn't appear anymore).
Beside the fact that it was supposed to be a new "feature" of latest Android App with HA 0.104.0+, it doesn't even allow me to rename the device as it was before, because the previous entity is somewhere still present in the system (even if it is not showed).

Of course, once I restart HA I am able to rename the device again, but my understanding was that this was no longer necessary because of the unique ID HA should assign to a device, and re-use it (and presumably all the settings assigned to it) once the device log back in.

**Description of problem:**
I have setup a iframe panel url link to an internal https link (a transmission server running in a local computer). However, i get "401: Unauthorized user" error. I was expecting to get the web login interface of the transmission server. The same thing works perfectly if accessing home assistant from a browser (from desktop or phone). It only happens when accessing the iframe link through the android app.
