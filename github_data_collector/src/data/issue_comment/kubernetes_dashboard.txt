<p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/jeffbski/wait-on/releases">wait-on's releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>v4.0.0 - a fresh approach</h2>
<p>Rewrite of the main code to simplify the logic and reduce possibility for race conditions. Bumped the major version do to the rewrite and also a minor change in how the stability window is used. In the new version the stability window only applies to file resources (waiting for them to exist and stop changing), for other resources they are completed as soon as available.</p>
<p>Also in the new logic, once a resource becomes available the system doesn't continue to check it, it only continues checking the pending resources.</p>
<p>Logging was improved and simplified.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-l</code> / <code>--log</code> just indicate what resources are still pending</li>
<li><code>-v</code> / <code>--verbose</code> includes resources that are pending and debug info from checks</li>
</ul>
<p>Updated many dependencies including rxjs, and joi. Removed core-js polyfill as no longer needed.</p>
<p>Added a <code>-s</code> / <code>--simultaneous</code> optional flag to the command. If provided it will limit the number of simultaneous or concurrent connections to an individual resource. It defaults to Infinity so it will make requests without caring about previous ones. If you were to set it to &quot;1&quot; then it wouldn't be sending new requests to <a href="http://foo">http://foo</a> before the previous one finished (success, failure, or timeout).</p>

##### What would you like to be added

I would like to add the ability to pass in a kube-config with many kube-contexts. The dashboard would have a dropdown to select context/cluster and an "all clusters" view similar to "all-namespaces"

##### Why is this needed

Many users are in situations where they run many different clusters. We have over 20 clusters, it would be nice to have one dashboard for them all and a way to get an aggregated view. 

##### Comments
Wondering if this is a feature the community would want, I'm going to be working on it anyway

##### What would you like to be added
The first thing is the ability to pass allowed/disallowed namespaces, I have this done already in a private fork. 

##### Why is this needed

Basically the use case is with RBAC you can give cluster scoped rights or namespace scoped rights but for our developers we want them to have access to some subset of the namespaces in a cluster, we don't want to run multiple dashboards per namespace. So we pass a list of allowed or disallowed namespaces to the dashboard.

##### Comments
Wondering if this is a feature the community would want before I put extra effort in to clean it up a little and document

Update Japanese translation file for #4625

/cc @feloy @seokho-son @hwdef @tanjunchen
refer to issue #4740 

I found that  dashboard can not handle the pod terminating status,
BTW, when the pod phase is Running and the DeletionTimestamp is not nil, dashboard will show the pod is Running, but it's Terminating if I use kubectl describe pod

cc @maciaszczykm @floreks @shu-mutou 
Please don't merge it now. I think it should be discussed. Maybe the front-end should be changed either.

Above it's some reference about pod status:
[How to use the kubernetes go-client to get the same Pod status info that kubectl gives](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57297817/how-to-use-the-kubernetes-go-client-to-get-the-same-pod-status-info-that-kubectl)
[kubernetes/kubernetes printpod](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/printers/internalversion/printers.go#L558)
hi, everyone,
I found that the dashboard can not handle the pod `Terminating` status,
BTW, when the pod phase is `Running ` and the `DeletionTimestamp` is not nil, dashboard will show the pod is Running, but it's `Terminating`  if I use `kubectl describe pod`.
```
func isTerminating(pod *corev1.Pod) bool {
	if pod.Spec.ActiveDeadlineSeconds != nil && *pod.Spec.ActiveDeadlineSeconds >= int64(0) {
		return true
	}
	return false
}
```
I found some code in kubernetes/kubernetes and I think we need more information about the pod status because it's a important part, the kubernetes offical doc seems not clear to describe it also.
##### Environment

```
Installation method: Applied this yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.0.0-beta8/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
Kubernetes version: 1.17.0
Dashboard version: 2.0.0-beta8
Operating system: CentOS 7
Node.js version ('node --version' output):
Go version ('go version' output):
```

##### Steps to reproduce
Create file pending-externalname.yaml with this content
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: externalname-stays-pending
spec:
  externalName: niels.basjes.nl
  type: ExternalName
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443
      targetPort: 443
```

```
$ kubectl apply -f  pending-externalname.yaml 
service/externalname-stays-pending created
```

```
$ kubectl get svc externalname-stays-pending -o wide
NAME                         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)   AGE   SELECTOR
externalname-stays-pending   ExternalName   <none>       niels.basjes.nl   443/TCP   35s   <none>
```

##### Observed result
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/240096/71968745-ca640800-3205-11ea-9009-f64328cc9734.png)

The icon on the left shows as 'pending' (i.e. the grey incomplete circle) indefinitely.

##### Expected result

After the startup (which should be really really fast in this case) the icon changes to a green check.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/240096/71969010-2af34500-3206-11ea-962a-66c8426eab14.png)

##### Comments

I suspect this has to do with the fact that an ExternalName will NOT get a ClusterIP at all.
