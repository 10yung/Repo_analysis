I'm trying to implement the touch to show the current value. The problem is that I'm getting `use of unresolved identifier "value"` when I try to add the text to my label. 
The series are shown correctly in the Chart but I'm not getting the value inside the `indexes`. 

```
func didTouchChart(_ chart: Chart, indexes: [Int?], x: Float, left: CGFloat) {
        if dataResponse.count > 0 {
            for (seriesIndex, dataIndex) in indexes.enumerated() {
              
              if dataIndex != nil {
                // The series at `seriesIndex` is that which has been touched
                
                let value = chart.valueForSeries(seriesIndex, atIndex: dataIndex)
                let date = dataDates[dataIndex!]
                let type = SensorType.getSpecialCharacter(sensorTypes[dataIndex!])
                lblValue.text = "\(value)\(type) \(date)" //Ex. 78Â°C 12-11-2018
              }
                
            }
        }
        
    }
```
It used to work fine before, but I don't know what happened. I don't know what could be happening, I was expecting this behavior.

This is a similar issue to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56718552/disable-gesture-to-pull-down-form-page-sheet-modal-presentation

The panning of the finger on the chart seems to interfere with the gesture recogniser responsible for dismissing the modally presented VC. Whenever the motion of my fingers starts to go a bit vertical, the VC starts to go downwards and the gesture recognisers on the chart all stop.
The install method was previously notated as `pod "SwiftChart"` but the correct input should be `pod 'SwiftChart'`
Added width parameter for lineSeries in order to be able to have different widths for different series
- Add framework for project
- Add Swift Package Manager support (Package.swift file)
- Make extension api only safe
Hi, this is a tiny change to the readme. Thanks for this library!

- The example code was still using `CGRectZero`, but this has been renamed to `CGRect.zero`
- Added an `import` statement to the example code.
getting crash in 


override func awakeFromNib() {
        super.awakeFromNib()
   

chart.delegate = self <---- Here is Crash
        
    }

There seems to be bug somewhere with the pod installation. Experienced with pod installation so it isn't my process as it's a simple process anyway. Only this module has this issue so it points to something with it. Using the latest xcode and swift 4.

Cleaning the build folder and rebuilding results in same thing.
Using SwiftChart 1.0.1 from cocoapods.
When building with xcode 10.2.1 and Swift language set to 5.0
I get this error:

> 'kCALineJoinBevel' has been renamed to 'CAShapeLayerLineJoin.bevel'

Is it possible to fix it,  and update cocoapod?
Should be small change.

Hi,
As said in the title, I try to use this function to get a vertical line showing value

func didTouchChart(chart: Chart, indexes: Array<Int?>, x: Float, left: CGFloat) {
        for (serieIndex, dataIndex) in enumerate(indexes) {
            if dataIndex != nil {
                // The series at serieIndex has been touched
                let value = chart.**valueForSeries**(serieIndex, atIndex: dataIndex)
            }
        }
    }

But Xcode give me an error. Any clue to fix  that ?

Thanks!
