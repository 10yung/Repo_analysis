Added basic support for Exchange 2019 detection and handling ContentIndexState no longer existing in Exchange 2019 - when you query it from Exchange 2019 it reports back as NotApplicable but when you query from an Exchange 2013 server it returns ContentIndexState as 11 instead so I have caught both of these.

I've not tested on 2016 as I don't run this, presumably it will return as either 2013 or 2019 do though.

Currently I'm just reporting 2019's ContentIndexState as just Healthy so it shows nicely as green but I guess this could be changed to show as Not Applicable and still show as green if preferred (this was just a quick hack to get the report working).
Hello,

If you want, here is my fix for the issue #25 .
