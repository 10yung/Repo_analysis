Often I'll be writing a file and decide I want to save it as a Gist. Current workflow is not ideal:

1. Ctrl-Shift-P
2. New Gist
3. Fill in the info
4. Browse to the new file
5. Cut and paste from my "old" file to the new one

Preferred workflow:

1. Ctrl-Shift-P
2. Select "Save file as new gist"
3. Pre-populate the file name and only show me the dropdown prompt for what I want the description to be

Several system add tags to gist descriptions. My current favorite is https://gistlist.ksdev.pl:

The same thing in vscode:

Gistpad could make some or all of the following features on tags:

1. Clickable. The same as in gistlist, once you click it, only relevant gists with that tags are shown.
2. Searchable. For example search box on top of existing intervace.
3. Sortable by tags.

I think this is easy to implement and certainly is compatibile with number of other systems.

Resolves also: #95, #7
This PR adds the ability for new users (who have not signed in) to start a quick playground. The "temp playgrounds" are created under [the gistpad account](https://gist.github.com/gistpad). Once the user signs in, they can fork this temporary playground into their account. The goal is to make it easier for users to try out the playground experience, and then gradually onboard to regular authenticated users.

This PR needs some more work before it can be merged, for example
- [ ] alert user that saving the gist is not saving it to their accounts, and prompt them to sign in
- [ ] one click action to fork when the user signs in
- [x] there's a "description undefined" error that shows up right after the playground is created
- [ ] default templates are not available if the user is not authenticated

I'm creating this WIP PR to see if the implementation seems correct (~there are some state changes involved~, not anymore with the in-memory FS)

(also fyi, depends on #104)
When you add a library to a playground, we currently display the complete, alphabetical list of available libraries. However, it’s likely that users will use the same libraries over and over again, and therefore, we should explore displaying an MRU list at the top of the library list, to allow quickly picking your favorite library, in addition to being able to search for one.
In order to create playgrounds, you need to first authenticate with GitHub. This is because playground files are written to gists, and therefore, those gists need to be associated with a specific user.

However, some users may simply want to create ephemeral playgrounds that allow them to explore an idea quickly, and then move on. In these situations, persisting the playground might not be useful, and therefore, needing to sign in could feel a little heavyweight.

To better enable the use of playgrounds, we should explore allowing playground creation, without needing to sign in.
Currently, we allow searching for playground libraries using CDNJS, which provides a fixed set of packages. We should explore using jsDelivr instead, or offering it as an alternative, since it provides an entire reverse proxy on top of NPM, and therefore, would have many more libraries than CDNJS.
Currently, there's no way to determine whether a gist was forked from another gist and/or whether a gist has been forked by others. We should explore how to visualize this data in the `Gists` view, so that for example, devs can see who is using their playgrounds/gists as "templates" to explore their own derivations/ideas on top of it. 
When using GistPad on an enterprise network that requires an authenticated proxy connection, GistPad will properly login (with token) and load the list of my Gist but will not display them.

E.g. list:

But attempting to load `example.ps1` fails with this error in the console:

Curiously most of the time I only get the loading indicator without any error, like if the request was sent WITHOUT going thru the proxy.

VS Code works properly, will update and download extensions via proxy etc.
I'm using oauth token with gist selected i can see starred gists, although when viewing my own gists it displays the html for my github enterprise login page (displaying Sign in via LDAP · GitHub in the html). I've tried creating them from gistpad and its the same results, although the gist appears okay in github enterprise.
