Hey!
Would you be able to show me what security rules look like for the cloud database? The app does not work with the usual rules.
I want to check the receiver read the sender message or not and as per that I want to show/hide some content in my messageCell.

I found that current code finds the conversation was read or not by below code but I'm unable to find the code that will identify that particular message was read/unread in conversation

```
guard let id = conversation.userIDs.filter({$0 != userID}).first else { return }
        let isRead = conversation.isRead[userID] ?? true
        if !isRead {
            nameLabel.font = nameLabel.font.bold
            messageLabel.font = messageLabel.font.bold
            messageLabel.textColor = ThemeService.purpleColor
            timeLabel.font = timeLabel.font.bold
            
            vwNewMessage.isHidden = false
            constraintHeightOfNewMessage.constant = 24.0
            constraintTrailingOfLatestMessage.constant = 50.0
        }
        else {
            vwNewMessage.isHidden = true
            constraintHeightOfNewMessage.constant = 0.0
            constraintTrailingOfLatestMessage.constant = 10.0
        }
}
```

It will be very helpful to me if you guys give me some suggestion to do this.
Is it possible to update the users profile Icon and username?
Hi There,
Thanks for this great demo of chat.
I just want to add audio and video functionalities in this chat. Please suggest how I do this?

Thanks!!!
If possible please implement a forgot password option 
I think you should add the ability to block someone
Firebase security rules should ideally be provided with the source code, otherwise the app is essentially useless. 
Hi, meanwhile great work !!!
I would like to know how to implement 3 things ...

1. Notify when a message arrives;
2. Send audio message;
3. Delete the conversation.

Always if you can ...
I follow you and look forward to the next version ... possible release date?
