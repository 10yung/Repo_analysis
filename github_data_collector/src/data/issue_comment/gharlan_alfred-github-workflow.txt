This workflow worked nicely in Alfred 3, but with Alfred 4 I can't login. gh > login show no option to log inn. Pressing "Update" does nothing either.

Add in two additional workflows for handling Gitflow pull request types.

Makes it super easy to jump into creating a new pull request for merging dev into staging and production into master respectively.
The Workflow doesn't show me private repositories of my organisation I am contributing to.
Is this an expected behaviour or a bug?
It would be handy if you could initialize a new repository from Alfred. Default settings (public, .gitignore) would be applied to the new repo. Command could be like the following:

`gh my new {repo name}`


Would you accept a pull request adding this feature?
99% of the time I'm just opening my own repos (or those of organizations I'm apart of). And while they do get bubbled to the top after a while, it'd be great if it wouldn't do the search across GH for any other matching repos. This would make it faster and give me more confidence visually that I'm selecting the right one (the list would only be one or two items long and I wouldn't need to read it).

In the case that I _do_ want to search globally, adding an additional attribute seems easy enough, such as `gh g {query}` for `global` search. I'd also be okay with this being a preference thing that you can choose to turn on or off. 

You could keep it simple too and ignore the global search open, such that if this preference option is turned on then you just couldn't do global searches. I'd be okay with that too. Like I said 99% of the time I'm just quickly opening my own repos. 
Thanks for your tool, I love it.

Is it possible to copy the URL in the SSH format rather then HTTPS?

Many thanks.
I work on a large repo and, from time to time, I want to open a file by using Alfred.

Per the lines below:
https://github.com/gharlan/alfred-github-workflow/blob/a5c0bd28d3fd472caba703e0437393059c827d17/search.php#L385-L395

As I understand, the workflow will only add results to the screen after the whole tree has been scanned.
This is either taking ages or not working at all, and will likely be [a truncated response](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/trees/#get-a-tree-recursively).

Could we perhaps have a way to disable that, so that the repo gets scanned faster?
Something like `gh einpraegsam/powermail compare-releases 1.0.0 2.0.0` would be nice which does link to `GHserver/UserOrOrg/Repo/compare/5.0.1...5.0.2`
expected: gh user/repo clone (eg: gh https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod clone) should clone repo

actual: typing in _gh https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod clone_ and hitting enter seems to have no effect
