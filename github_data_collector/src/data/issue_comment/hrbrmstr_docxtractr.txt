Thank you for docxtractr. While reading a .docx file, I have a special symbol (tick mark) within a table. Currently using docxtractr renders them as null character. Requesting to see if this can be enabled in this package. 
Thanks a lot for such a great package.

I was trying out `docxtractr::read_docx` on `doc` files in `Windows 10` using `LibreOffice Version: 6.2.5.2 (x64)`.

It was horribly slow (_due to LibreOffice I guess_) if I don't open LibreOffice (_manually outside R_). Once I close and run the same code in R again it's slow. 
``` r
fn <- "rough/messy_files/doc.doc"
library(tictoc)

# LibreOffice never opened in after last PC-reboot
tic()
tmp <- docxtractr::read_docx(fn)
toc()
# 285.63 sec elapsed
# 4.7 min !

# LibreOffice open
tic()
tmp <- docxtractr::read_docx(fn)
toc()
# 1.1 sec elapsed

# LibreOffice closed after open
tic()
tmp <- docxtractr::read_docx(fn)
toc()
# 24.21 sec elapsed
```
It is ok for a single file but if you have bundles of files then definitely not a good thing. 
I was thinking if any alternative way of supporting doc files can be given to users. 

Like use of [docx4j](https://github.com/plutext/docx4j) as mentioned in [this](https://github.com/yeokm1/docs-to-pdf-converter) repository. Then the system dependency (_on LibreOffice_)  will go away and I believe that will be smoother also.

There was a small error in README.
This package is incredibly handy, thanks! 

I don't know much about XML, but looking at an unzipped docx file, it appears that, if the footer exists, each section of document has a corresponding footer XML file (e.g., `footer1.xml`). Would it be possible to add a function that iterates through and extracts a document's footers (and headers, I suppose, but for the motivating use case, it's the footers I'm interested in)? It doesn't look like footers have IDs the same way comments do, but it would be great to be able to retain the section number of each footer... Is there any other information that would be useful?

Thanks in advance!
