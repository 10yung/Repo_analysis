I have 2 completely separated recyclers which are in different fragments in ViewPager. When I remove a swipe or drag flag from one of them it is automatically removed in the second which I find confusing.

Fragment 1:
`recyclerOne.layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(context!!)`
`recyclerOne.adapter = adapterOne`
`val orientation = DragDropSwipeRecyclerView.ListOrientation.VERTICAL_LIST_WITH_VERTICAL_DRAGGING`
`orientation.removeSwipeDirectionFlag(DragDropSwipeRecyclerView.ListOrientation.DirectionFlag.RIGHT)`
`recyclerOne.orientation = orientation`

Fragment 2:
`recyclerTwo.layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(context!!)`
`recyclerTwo.adapter = adapterTwo`
`val orientation = DragDropSwipeRecyclerView.ListOrientation.VERTICAL_LIST_WITH_VERTICAL_DRAGGING`
`orientation.removeSwipeDirectionFlag(DragDropSwipeRecyclerView.ListOrientation.DirectionFlag.LEFT)`
`recyclerTwo.orientation = orientation`

The above code will make both recyclers unswipable in either directions instead of making then swipable in different directions.
