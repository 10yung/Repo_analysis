Hi, I'm very new to app building so a lot of this is confusing to me.

So far, I have successfully opened your repo in Xcode and I've replaced all the Identifiers to my own name.

When I try to build, it tries to fix this issue:
`None of the valid provisioning profiles allowed the specified entitlements: com.apple.security.application-groups, com.apple.developer.healthkit.`

but then it fails and says this:
"**Communication with Apple failed**"
"Your account does not have sufficient permissions to modify containers."

Can you please explain why this is, and what can i do to fix it?

I'm not paying for the Developer Program so I'm only a free account. Is this the problem? Does this mean I can't install anyone's example code on my device at all?

Appreciate any help you can give to a new Xcode user.

Thanks

THIS ISNT AN ISSUE I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT YOUR PROJECT IS SAVING MY LIFE!

Has anyone able to submit a watch OS2 app using healthkit to Apple successfully? I keep running into this error: 

ERROR ITMS-90362" :Invalid Info.plist value. The value for the key 'UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities' in bundle {bundle name} is invalid. Expecting array with a single string value of watch-companion'

Have been using the same entry as in the example:

```
<key>UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities</key>
    <array>
        <string>healthkit</string>
    </array>
```

That is what won't submit. If i change the string to `watch-companion` then the watch app will never start and is broken.

Hey! So I changed all the teams in all targets to mine, changed identifiers from com.shh.xxx.xxx to com.dv.xxx.xxx, Added app group entitlements to parent app and extension, changed that in Audio controller code.

But I'm getting this mysterious error.

error: WatchKit App doesn't contain any WatchKit Extensions whose WKAppBundleIdentifier matches "com.dv.sampler.watchos2.watchkitapp". Verify that the value of WKAppBundleIdentifier in your WatchKit Extension's Info.plist matches the value of CFBundleIdentifier in your WatchKit App's Info.plist.

I tried doing just what it wants, also renaming and any combinations of those. Nothing helps.
This is on Xcode 7 beta 4. Regards

No valid signing identities (i.e. certificate and private key pair) matching the team ID “9Z86A4AWDE” were found.

Do you have any solution?
