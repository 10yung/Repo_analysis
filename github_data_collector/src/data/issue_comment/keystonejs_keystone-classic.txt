I am trying to design a multi-tenant SaaS application and I am using Keystone js (Node JS framework) which uses Mongo Database.

The model that I want to use is Physical Separation of Data: This approach separates the data by provisioning different database for different tenants/clients. This helps us to scale our application as the number of clients grows and also scale the database as per the clients need.

The problem is I dont know how to configure or create a settings on Keystone that would implement a multi tenant system.

Here https://blog.lftechnology.com/designing-a-secure-and-scalable-multi-tenant-application-on-node-js-15ae13dda778 is an example but it uses a different database and its not mongo nor keystone js.

Does anyone have an idea how to configure keystone js to be multi tenant using Physical Separation of Data model or is there any other solution ?

There were some answers from this tread but not clear to me Implementing multitenancy in KeystoneJS.

Thank you.
From what I find the time zone is unconditionally appended to the Datetime string before parsing with Moment. This yields all Datetime parseFormats that lack the trailing 'Z' ineffective. Including 5 from the default list.

### Behavior

In Model:
```
Event.add({
  [...]
  date: { type: Types.Datetime, parseFormat: ['YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm'], required: true, initial: true}
  [...]
})
```
Setting "2019-11-22 17:30" through Admin UI should be valid.

Currently that's invalid, while setting `parseFormat: ['YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm Z']` makes the string "2019-11-22 17:30" valid in Admin UI.


### Environment


| Software         | Version
| ---------------- | -------
| Keystone         |  4.2.1
| Node.js          |  10.16.3
Currently it is not possible to save texts fields in the admin UI that exceed the default multer limit of 1mb.

## Description of changes

To set custom multer options it is currently necessary to set 'handle uploads' to true and define an object with the key 'multer options'.

`'multer options': {
            dest: tmpdir(),
            limits: {
                fieldSize: 25 * 1024 * 1024 //25 mb
            }
        },
        'handle uploads': true,`

These options are currently being applied during the setup of body-parser (server/bindBodyParser.js).

This pull request would also apply the options in the dynamic router (admin/server/app/createDynamicRouter.js) where multer is being used to process updates to fields in the admin UI.

 * For more information on the End-2-End (E2E) testing framework for Keystone 4, see:

 * To successfully have all E2E tests pass you need to have the following set up:

   One possible workaround is to remove the "linebreak-style" rule in `node_modules/eslint-config-keystone/eslintrc.json`.

### Expected behavior
When inheriting from a parent list, some fields may need to be hidden in some of the children. 

This appears to be the same issue that was opened back in 2016 that was later resolved. So the behavior we're seeing is almost definitely a regression: https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/issues/2941

### Actual/Current behavior
Other properties, like `noedit`, `initial`, `default`, `required` can all be overridden just by re-add the field with the same name in the child list. the `hidden` field, no matter what we do, does not appear to force the UI to not display the field.

### Steps to reproduce the actual/current behavior
Pseudo code:

```
parent.add({
  type: Types.Datetime,
  utc: true,
  format: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
  default: new Date(),
  required: true,
  initial: true,
});

child.add({
  type: Types.Datetime,
  utc: true,
  format: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
  required: false,
  initial: false,
  hidden: true,
  noedit: true,
});
```
I did some testing with Types.Text type fields just to see if it was specifically related to the DateTime fields, but the problem is reproducible independent of field type based on my limited testing.

### Environment

| Software         | Version
| ---------------- | -------
| Keystone         | 4.2.1
| Node.js          | 10.15.3 (other LTS versions also show same behavior)
| Browser          | Chrome/Firefox, latest versions

### Expected behavior
<!-- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->
<!-- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->
The `Types.CloudinaryImage` field type should be effected by the `required: true` option so users cant create new records without uploading a cloudinary image

### Actual/Current behavior
<!-- If you're describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->
<!-- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->
No matter what I do I can't get the keystone to require a CloudinaryImage before creating or updating a record


### Steps to reproduce the actual/current behavior
<!-- If you're describing a bug, tell us what steps to take to reproduce your bug -->
<!-- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, explain how to reproduce the current behavior -->
Create a model with a CloudinaryImage field and set the `required` option to true:
`image: { type: Types.CloudinaryImage, required: true, initial: true }`


### Environment

The model I am trying to create is for a blog and the project has been coded from scratch rather than using the generator, however, the issue is still present in projects that were created via the generator

I was wondering if it's possible in `keystone.js` to add a view.post in two different places. For example I have:
 `app.get('/blog', views.blog)` -> where I show view  only in blog, but also I would like to show this in main page ('/') . 
But if I do:
`app.get('/', views.blog)` -> I see only this blog, no footer, nav and others sections. How can I implement this? Also I would like to show this blog in 404 page:
`keystone.set('404', (req, res) => {
  res.status(404).render('errors/404')
})` 
but how can I add `views.blog` to this code. 
Is `keystone.js` handle this?

In my program I generated an array of objects which is the ImageData , Now I want to save that data to mongo Db , I have no problem with other Keys except the ImageData key because I dont know what field type to use to be able to insert those data below which are an array of objects . What field type in keystone we could use to save those array of object example below ?. Thank you.


#Model
```
Data.add({
    name: { type: String, required: false },
    Type: { type: Types.Select, options: 'New, Used,', index: true },
    ImageData: { type: Types.TextArray },
    content: {
        brief: { type: Types.Html, wysiwyg: true, height: 150 },
        extended: { type: Types.Html, wysiwyg: true, height: 400 },
    },
});
```


#JSON DATA - Key and value
```

 ImageData :  [ 
       { 
          "Uri":"Test.com",
          "Hash":"42e04950d6f11cd5350e3179083c7c7f",
          "Path":"/public/server/img/de29d68ab3594032bef70ead0b0d8fc2.jpg"
       },
       { 
          "Uri":"Test.com",
          "Hash":"42e04950d6f11cd5350e3179083c7c7f",
          "Path":"/public/server/img/de29d68ab3594032bef70ead0b0d8fc2.jpg"
       }
    ]
```
