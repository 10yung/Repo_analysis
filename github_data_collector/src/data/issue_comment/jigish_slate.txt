since i find i dont use rOption or rCommand oftenly, i'd like to bind those keys to functions

Document the fix mentioned in issue #512

(Closes #512) 
Just adds something to the README to make it applicable to most modern Macs.
Could I use a javascript config to start two apps then move those apps to the proper screen location?

After coming in to work, I open my laptop, taking it out of sleep and then connect 2 external monitors. Quite frequently, slate "beach balls" for 1-3 minutes before it starts working. 

Not sure if it is related, but I've also seen it when testing the configuration and using the ability to quit and reload.

Quitting slate and re-starting it does not fix the issue and slate "beach balls" for several minutes during restart. Only solution seems to reboot the machine to get acceptable performance again.
Hi @jigish  and others,

I usually use 3 monitors setup. One problem which has annoyed since me since my first usage of multi monitor setup is monitor where cmd + tab switcher output is displayed keeps on changing every now and then. 

**Following are the stackExchange threads which discuss the same.**
1. [macbook - Why does my dock keep moving back to my other monitor?](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/169719/why-does-my-dock-keep-moving-back-to-my-other-monitor)

2. [cmd-tab behavior on Mavericks with multiple displays](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106405/cmd-tab-behavior-on-mavericks-with-multiple-displays/106408#106408)

**Current Solution**
1. "You can summon the Dock on a different display by moving the cursor to the bottom of the desired display, and then continuing moving down. It may be possible that this is occurring when you inadvertently perform that action." Copy and Pasted from one of the above blogs.
The below solution is very annoying, as you have to touch your mouse every time and keep on continuing moving down.

**Required Solution using slate**
1. Fix the monitor on which cmd + tab switcher is displayed.
2. A keyboard shortcut to reinitialize it back to a specific monitor.

Any help will be highly appreciated.

Regards
use default config, No matter what button I press, it doesn't respond.

thanks
Is there an option to display some sort of an overlay on the monitor when selecting from the grid to accurately portray how the window will be resized?
