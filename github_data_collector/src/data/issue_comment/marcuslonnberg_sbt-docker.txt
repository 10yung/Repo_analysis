# What has been done in this PR?

Add the possibility to change the Java options when creating an image with `autoPackageJavaApplicationSettings`. 

- Using `javaOptions in docker` instead of just `javaOptions` to allow better refinement
- Using `$JAVA_OPTIONS` as default value for `javaOptions in docker`
- Added some tests to ensure this is working

> Also changed `.travis.yml` to ensure `scripted` tests are being run
Docker tags are not allowed to contain certain characters. Docker tags might be based on e.g. git branch names which can contain those characters. It would be useful to sanitize the tags to not unnecessarily limit the naming freedom of future git branches.
Fixes #99
Dovetailing off of [this comment](https://github.com/marcuslonnberg/sbt-docker/issues/34#issuecomment-498809039), I think it's appropriate for staging files to overwrite existing files. It seems like this operation should be idempotent.
We're trying to set an environment variable for the docker container. Below is our docker configuration:

```
dockerfile in docker := {
  new Dockerfile {
    val dockerAppPath = "/app/"
    val mainClassString = (mainClass in Compile).value.get
    val classpath = (fullClasspath in Compile).value
    from("java")
    add(classpath.files, dockerAppPath)
    env("ENVIRONMENT", "test")
    entryPoint("java", "-cp", s"$dockerAppPath:$dockerAppPath/*", s"$mainClassString")
  }
}
```

The resulting Dockerfile that's generated in the target directory contains the following command

`ENV ENVIRONMENT="test"`

But our application running within the container doesn't seem to be picking it up. When we set this environment locally, it does work though.

We're using sbt-docker-compose in conjuction with sbt-docker to run integration tests.

For certain scenarios I would like to skip tests when running `sbt -batch myapp/docker:stage` . What is a way to do this? I've tried `sbt 'set test in Test := {}' -batch myapp/docker:stage` but this doesn't work either...It still runs tests. 

there are serval project in my root, can  i choose which project to publish to my dockerhub?
