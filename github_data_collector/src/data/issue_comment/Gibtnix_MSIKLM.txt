Hello, 
Thanks for your software. Is there any way to install it on Fedora / RedHat based systems ? 
Thanks.
Hi,
If I understand correctly your utility and some others assume that the
internal keyboard is on the usb bus. I have a GS63VR Stealthpro 230
and it seems the keyboard is not a usb device. It doesnt show up in
lsusb output, but is in /dev/input/by-path as platform-i8042-serio-0-event-kbd.
Just wondering if you ever heard of this before?
Thanks
None of the commands work when using with Solus OS, is it supported?

Regards,
Hello, thank for you work.

I have try on my brand new `MSI GE75 Raider 8SE` on `Mint 19` but I get:

```
No compatible keyboard found!
```

Okay, so I have checked USB devices. Only relevant information from `lsusb` was: 

```
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 1038:1122 SteelSeries ApS 
```

Using `sudo msiklm list`, I get:
```
Device: SteelSeries KLC
    Device Vendor ID:        4152
    Device Product ID:       4386
    Device Serial Number:    (null)
    Device Manufacturer:     SteelSeries
    Device Path:             0001:0004:00
    Device Interface Number: 0
    Device Release Number:   560

Device: SteelSeries KLC
    Device Vendor ID:        4152
    Device Product ID:       4386
    Device Serial Number:    (null)
    Device Manufacturer:     SteelSeries
    Device Path:             0001:0004:01
    Device Interface Number: 1
    Device Release Number:   560

Device: USB Receiver
    Device Vendor ID:        1133
    Device Product ID:       50484
    Device Serial Number:    (null)
    Device Manufacturer:     Logitech
    Device Path:             0001:0002:00
    Device Interface Number: 0
    Device Release Number:   10497

Device: USB Receiver
    Device Vendor ID:        1133
    Device Product ID:       50484
    Device Serial Number:    (null)
    Device Manufacturer:     Logitech
    Device Path:             0001:0002:01
    Device Interface Number: 1
    Device Release Number:   10497
```

So I have hack `msiklm.c` and change open_keyboard()

```C
hid_device* open_keyboard()
{
    hid_device* dev = NULL;
    if (hid_init() == 0)
        dev = hid_open(0x1038, 0x1122, 0);
        //dev = hid_open(0x1770, 0xff00, 0);
    return dev;
}
```

After reinstall I have now:

```
Compatible keyboard found!
```

Well, that was expected. Then I have try many commands like:

```bash
sudo msiklm green
sudo msiklm green,blue,red
sudo msiklm off
```

But none of then work.

Except of course, commands like:

```bash
sudo msiklm test
sudo msiklm help
sudo msiklm list
```

Questions:

* Any idea to fix this ?
* Where did you get specifications of supported keyboard ?

Thk.
shows like this:
udo msiklm list
Device: SteelSeries Apex 150 Gaming Keyboard
    Device Vendor ID:        4152
    Device Product ID:       5654
    Device Serial Number:    (null)
    Device Manufaturer:      SteelSeries
    Device Path:             0001:0005:00
    Device Interface Number: 0
    Device Release Number:   24

Device: SteelSeries Apex 150 Gaming Keyboard
    Device Vendor ID:        4152
    Device Product ID:       5654
    Device Serial Number:    (null)
    Device Manufaturer:      SteelSeries
    Device Path:             0001:0005:01
    Device Interface Number: 1
    Device Release Number:   24

Also then changed msiklm.c file so it patches with ID
It looks like this:
bool keyboard_found()
{
    hid_device* keyboard = open_keyboard();
    if (keyboard != NULL)
    {
        hid_close(keyboard);
        return true;
    }
    else
    {
        return false;
    }
}

/**
 * @brief tries to open the MSI gaming notebook's SteelSeries keyboard
 * @returns a corresponding hid_device, null if the keyboard was not detected
 */
hid_device* open_keyboard()
{
    if (hid_init() == 0)
        return hid_open(4152, 5654, 0);
    else
        return NULL;

And after editing and saving this file it still can't detect my keyboard

sudo msiklm test                
No compatible keyboard found!

It should even find it right?
Doesn't recognize the keyboard~
I am using Manjaro (Arch)
Hello, can i turn on light around touch bar and on front panel? 
Hey !

When I use your tool, the color don't change.
I used the command with brightness argument like this :
```
sudo msiklm green high
```

but nothing happen...

My test output :
```
$ sudo msiklm test
Compatible keyboard found!
```
And my list output :
```

I don't know how keyboard work, and I hope that you can help me :)

Thank you for your great job !
For some reason wave mode is very slow on my GE62 6QD. It used to be "just right" a couple of weeks ago but then it suddenly stopped being "just right" and instead became as slow as a snail.

Though I tried [another tool (the one that runs on nodejs)](https://github.com/stevelacy/msi-keyboard), which apparently had an option to set cycle period for wave mode and it worked very well, but it feels kinda eh to run a short node script on startup, tho I guess it's just me.
On any instantiation of msiklm, my ~/.xsession-errors file gets filled with each call of msiklm:

```
UdevQt: unhandled device action "bind"
UdevQt: unhandled device action "bind"
UdevQt: unhandled device action "bind"
UdevQt: unhandled device action "bind"
UdevQt: unhandled device action "bind"
UdevQt: unhandled device action "unbind"
UdevQt: unhandled device action "unbind"
UdevQt: unhandled device action "unbind"
UdevQt: unhandled device action "unbind"
UdevQt: unhandled device action "unbind"
```

This has grown large when I use a python script to do fancier effects with msiklm.
