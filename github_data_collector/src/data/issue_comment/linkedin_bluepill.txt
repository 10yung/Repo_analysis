Xcode 11.2.1 comes with iOS 13.2.2

Which the current release of Bluepill doesn't appear to support (only up to 13.2).

Couldn't see anything in the recent releases.
For easier debugging, console output does not include that information
Whether the simulator cloning is an optional feature or default behavior, the creating of sim templates should be done **in parallel**. It is very important to cut down on this time since the time spent in creating sim templates is the time that is not spent spawning the simulators and running the tests.

This is a continuation of #363 where we would be able to install the Certs using [iotrust](https://github.com/yageek/iostrust/)

Any insights what `xcode` OR `simctl` commands?
Often we might have to do some fixes or features in Bluepill version that supports an earlier Xcode version (Eg. [Xcode 10.2](https://github.com/linkedin/bluepill/tree/xcode-10.2)) or for that matter any branch other than the `master`. So, the Azure CI/CD automation should be extended to PRs that are not based on the `master` branch (Eg. https://github.com/linkedin/bluepill/pull/376).

Any efforts to include simctl io recordVideo support for the simulators BP creates? 

At the moment I am using the --script-file flag to run a bash script that enables recording for every launched simulator using the BP_DEVICE_ID passed from Bluepill. However, fastlane hangs if the bash command is not executed as 'set and forget' with a trailing ampersand. 

The command being used is 
`xcrun simctl io "$BP_DEVICE_ID" recordVideo "$storage_path/$BP_DEVICE_ID-screenrecord.mp4" &> "$storage_path/$BP_DEVICE_ID-log.txt" &`
This works, and creates the files in the right location with a file for logging. However the resulting files are corrupted because I am not able to stop the recording explicitly before BP closes and deletes them. 

Is it possible to also get a chance to run another script before the simulator is closed by BP? In the case of reusing simulators we would want a chance to cleanup whatever was done in the pre-test script made possible by --script-file.
The `--simulator-preferences-file` flag is not honored and the preferences file is not passed on when clone sims feature is used. 
Thanks to @rahul-malik from Pinterest for reporting this on our Slack channel.

The clone-simulator config is deprecated and need not be passed. The clone simulator feature is always ON in Bluepill going forward.

@ob Can you please take a look?
Bluepill throws the following error when the test host for a framework isn't set.

```
[2019-10-31T14:54:03.801Z] bp: invalid configuration
[2019-10-31T14:54:03.801Z]     /Users/jenkins/ws/null/iOS/__PLATFORMS__/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Agents/xctest not found.

```

The `xctestrun` file would have the following entries:
```
<key>TestHostPath</key>
<string>__PLATFORMS__/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Agents/xctest</string>
```

To rectify it, you must modify the test host in your project:

This bug report is to have better messaging when the test host isn't set.
