我用cf dns解析后不管怎么设置都报403，是不支持cf吗
网站有问题时报404错误的页面需带网站特殊标识的报错页面，可否自定义呢？

**Steps to reproduce the issue:**
0. 因为客户端 **kubenetes cluster** 要求使用https访问, so, 借鉴了文章 [使用内网穿透给本地项目部署域名跟https](https://juejin.im/post/5d6f5f1ef265da03bc12977a) 大概思路, 将Nginx替换成Apache, 通过Apache 来转发 https://url:8888 -->https://url:8889
```flow
Browser  --> Apache --> Frps --> Frpc
```
1. systemctl restart httpd.service
2. 在 frp 未开启 且 Apache 未开启反向代理前, 测试访问 https://notebook.render.xxx.com:8888 是OK 的
3. ./frps -c frps.ini
4. ./frpc -c frpc.ini
5. 在frp 开启 且 Apache 开启反向代理后, 再次访问 https://notebook.render.xxx.com:8888

**Describe the results you received:**
浏览器显示为:
```
The page you visit not found.
Sorry, the page you are looking for is currently unavailable.
Please try again later.

The server is powered by frp.

Faithfully yours, frp.
```

frps 日志显示:
```
2020/01/17 11:32:19 [I] [proxy.go:92] [11d0a5d9b1deb5fb] [web02] get a new work connection: [222.93.91.241:45312]
2020/01/17 11:32:19 [W] [http.go:95] do http proxy request error: EOF
```
配置Nginx 也会遇到同样的问题

**Describe the results you expected:**
我期望的结果应该是正常跳转到我本地 docker 中的 kubenetes cluster 页面(ps: 可以通过 https://192.168.51.64访问到页面)

**Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):**


**Can you point out what caused this issue (optional)**


KCP协议受网络环境影响非常大, 在不同网络环境下通常都需要调整KCP协议的相关参数才能实现较好的加速效果, 目前版本的FRP中KCP协议底层相关参数是对终端用户屏蔽的, 用户无法调整KCP参数进行加速优化, 查看代码（utils/net/kcp.go#ListenKcp）后发现目前使用的KCP参数如下:

- MTU: 1350
- 发送窗口: 1024
- 接收窗口: 1024
- 缓冲区: 4194304
- 工作模式: 1, 20, 2, 1

请把以上5个KCP协议关键配置项开放给最终用户, 使用户可以在不同的网络环境下对使用KCP协议的FRP两端进行优化调整, 谢谢.

**Can you point out what caused this issue (optional)**

bandwith_limit 参数无效
frp版本：frp_0.31.1，Windows
代理配置：

[rdp9]
type=tcp
local_ip=192.168.1.5
local_port=3389
remote_port=0
use_encryption=true
use_compression=true
meta_id=5555555
bandwith_limit=200KB

使用以上配置连接服务器后，RDP上传速度依然不变（可以达到600KB/S）
