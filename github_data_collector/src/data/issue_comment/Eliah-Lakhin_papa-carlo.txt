Hi guys, 

any plans on this?
http://lakhin.com/projects/papa-carlo/demo/

Any "" is a syntax error.
Parboiled2 is 1-2 orders of magnitude faster then native papa-carlo matchers. It would be great if papa-carlo added incremental parsing features on top of high performance of parboiled2.

I am trying to change the js demo to use Calculator parser. What I did was only replacing Json with Calculator in Demo object for lexer and syntax. Now when I load the demo page, initial parsing of mathematical expressions succeeds but when I change the expression in the code editor to test incremental compilation, it simply errors out with code mismatch, even for the simplest expression ("1 + 1")

Any hints what might be causing that?

Hi Eliah, maybe this is a stupid question but I'm just learning about parsers and lexers now, something cool about the scala parser is than I can build a structure of scala objects which I can traverse in a simple way using pattern matching...

for instance the terms in this blog http://www.dontbreakthebuild.com/2013/07/30/basic-parsing-in-scala-using-parsing-combinators/
I can match over Integer(a), Multiplication(a,b)...etc...

I was thinking than would be a solution iterate 2 times, the first one traverse the nodes and build a tree of scala objects and then work with this...but I'm not sure if it's a good approach or there is a better solution

thanks
