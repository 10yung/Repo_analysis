Just figured out Spotify-AdBlocker wouldn't work (as in not blocking ads) whenever I install Spotify using the snap package. There is no mention of this in the README file and can help some users.

Hello,

10 days ago i have reinstall my Kali Linux to make a dual boot with Windows 10.
Today i tried AdKiller because im bored of YouTube, i used these command

sudo apt-get install x11-utils pulseaudio-utils libnotify-bin xdotool vlc
cd /Documents
git clone https://github.com/SecUpwN/Spotify-AdKiller.git
cd Spotify-AdKiller
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh

Then i have install Spotify i don't know if i can remember this but when i start spotify by the command line "spotify" the name of the app is Spotify Free but im not sure before it was just Spotify.

EDIT: im on Kali
Of course, now i have advert ...
Using spotify version 1.1.5.153.gf614956d on ubuntu 18.04.02 LTS. Continuous mode works as intended though. On 'simple', when the ad gets played, spotify mutes, but it looks like the ad gets skipped because I just see my song's progress bar - I can move it, skip to next song, or just wait, but it never unmutes until I restart(and sometimes even persists through restarts). 
Created uninstall on readme. Even though it is straightforward, the readme is a bit more complete
As per my thought #109 

This adds a new `CUSTOM_MODE` option `restart` as well as a config file option `RESTART_MINIMIZED`
Why the fuck is it playing Minecraft sounds when its muting the ads
The dns-block branch now completely breaks recent versions of Spotify. Lots of pages are now blank, and music playing is broken. I don't know if there is still interest in making it work, but when I get some time I'll experiment with the blacklists. 
There are way of to run Adkiller with snap or flatpak packages?
