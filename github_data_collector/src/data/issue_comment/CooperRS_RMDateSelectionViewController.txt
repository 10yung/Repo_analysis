Hello friend!

We've noticed that on iOS 13 with Dark Mode enabled, the selector is invisible:

I've gotten this to work for me by adding a:
```swift        
if #available(iOS 13.0, *) {
    actionController.overrideUserInterfaceStyle = .light
}
```

Right before presenting calendar selector!

I also notice that I can't seem to set the style to anything dark, I was going to add a 
```swift
if #available(iOS 13.0, *) {
  puts("!: we are 13")
  if self.webViewController?.traitCollection.userInterfaceStyle == .dark {
       puts("!: We are dark")
      style = RMActionControllerStyle.black
   }
}
// then initialize the actionController
let actionController: RMDateSelectionViewController = RMDateSelectionViewController(style: style)!
```

However, even hardcoding it to `.black` seems to make keep it white!

Hi @CooperRS ,

Thanks for the awesome library.

The "M" and "W" of monday and wednesday goes out of the alertbox view when style is set as RMActionControllerStyleWhite. Please help me out with this.
This might be Apple UIDatePicker issue as well.  

While the picker is animating, if user tap on "Select", UI seems wait for a while to let datePicker settle down to the final value, but the return value will still show the original value.

Tried capturing value through UIControlEventValueChanged, seems it able to return the final value even if DateSelectionViewController is dismissed. 

I'm not sure how it could be patched in the component itself since UIDatePicker doesn't expose much info about the UI.  Maybe you have some better idea.
