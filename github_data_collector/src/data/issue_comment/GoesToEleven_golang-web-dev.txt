I keep getting the following error:  panic: pq: password authentication failed for user "bond"

I cannot find what's wrong with the code, as it's the one that was used in the course, and in the course it ran perfectly.
Can you find the problem?
 
GO CODE:

package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"

	_ "github.com/lib/pq"
)

func main() {
	db, err := sql.Open("postgres", "postgres://bond:password@localhost/bookstore?sslmode=disable")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	err = db.Ping() //"Ping" checks if a connection to a database is still live, and returns an error if it isnt (so if theres no error it means its connected).
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("You've connected to your database")
}




postgreSQL CODE:

postgres=# CREATE DATABASE bookstore;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# CREATE USER bond WITH PASSWORD 'password';
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE bookstore to bond;
GRANT

Is there any way to authenticate using existing cookie and gets details from the API request? I am very new to golang, Also went through the Chapter 29 but couldn't relate to the case I am working on. If you have reading on that can you please point it out?

My Case:
I want to connect to the REST API of remote server via golang. However the authentication to the api is via cookie only. So need to pass the existing cookie information to get authenticated and pull out the details.

In the data definitions for this solution, each region has its own title (e.g., 'Northern', 'Central', but the region values are all coded as 'southern' in the data structure. For example:
```html
		region{
			Region: "Northern",
			Hotels: []hotel{
				hotel{
					Name:    "Hotel California",
					Address: "42 Sunset Boulevard",
					City:    "Los Angeles",
					Zip:     "95612",
					Region:  "southern",   <!-- s/b northern -->
				},
				hotel{
					Name:    "H",
					Address: "4",
					City:    "L",
					Zip:     "95612",
					Region:  "southern",  <!-- s/b northern -->
				},
			},
		},
```
