### Purpose

Adds long press preview to images.

### Details

This PR adds support for long press previews of photos/videos. 

On iOS versions <13.0 it only shows a preview of the selected asset, while on iOS 13+ it also adds a contextual menu with the option to select/deselect the previewed photo. 

The previews support static photos, live photos and videos. 

## Changes

In order to achieve this, a new read-only property was added to `TLPhotoCollectionViewCell`: 
`open internal(set) var asset: PHAsset?` as well as 2 delegate callbacks to `TLPhotosPickerViewController`. 

`public func previewingContext(_ previewingContext: UIViewControllerPreviewing, viewControllerForLocation location: CGPoint) -> UIViewController?` is used for iOS <13 devices and only shows a preview of the photo on a force touch. 

`public func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, contextMenuConfigurationForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath, point: CGPoint) -> UIContextMenuConfiguration?` is used for iOS 13+ devices and shows the context menu to select/deselect the photo.

func selectedPhoto(picker: TLPhotosPickerViewController, at: Int) {
        print("NewUploadVC: selected photo")
    }

Picking up Images is working fine. In iOS 13, After opening camera roll, When tapped on a video it crashes after printing "NewUploadVC: selected photo" with no other error logs. Any solution to this.
Is it possible to open camera directly on button tap? 
I know on button tap it first opens library then camera button click. 
i am using 'asset.exportVideoFile' function to export a 20 minutes video to documents path, is very very very very.....slow, this is my codeï¼š

The thumbnail for the album selected which is not the current album has its thumbnail being swapped with another album thumbnail. You can see this flickering occurring when you open the album list, tap on a new album the flicker occurs, then the correct thumbnail shows and the album is then opened.
Case 1. IF I select 1 pic from TEST and perform the following:
I have 2 albums - Recents (10 pics) and Test (1 pic)
- Stay focused in app on TEST album
- Switch to native photos
- Delete all photos from TEST
- Return to app
What currently happens:
- TEST album pic is gone - good
- Select list of albums shows TEST with 0 pics - good
However, IF I switch to recents then the following issue occurs
- Go to Recents Album
- Tap on album selector
- The TEST album with 0 pic count still shows - bad - this should be cleared from the album list

Case 2, IF I am in Recents and perform the following:
I have 2 albums - Recents (10 pics)
- Go to Recents album and tap on album list
- Switch to native photos
- Add photo to TEST
- REturn to app
What currently happens
- Album list dismissed automatically when going to app
- Tapping on album list does not show the TEST album with 1 pic that was just added - the album list should detect all changes for albums with photos
var configure = TLPhotosPickerConfigure()
        configure.fetchCollectionTypes = [(.smartAlbum, .smartAlbumAnimated)]
        configure.numberOfColumn = 3
        configure.singleSelectedMode = false
        configure.supportedInterfaceOrientations = [.all]
        configure.maxSelectedAssets = 1


OR
configure.singleSelectedMode = true

This issue happened at when I select one GIF pic. It doesn't reload cell. Waiting. Thanks
