why i install tensorflow 1.5  and import tensrofow ,have error abour  illegal instruction (core dumped)
Is there any way I could request you to upload the file for TF 2.0 (macOS Catalina) ? It'd be greatly appreciated! Thanks! 
Hi,

first of all thanks for your effort in creating different flavors of TensorFlow binaries.

I am currently in the process of creating a Docker base image containing somewhat recent versions of Python (>= 3.7) and TensorFlow (>= 1.13) with AVX2 support. You provide a Python 3.7 version which additionally has AVX512F support enabled, but this version won't run on my target system, as the CPU does not support AVX512F.

Is it possible to ship a Linux-targeted version, but _without_ AVX512F support? Ubuntu would be fine, Alpine would be even better for use in Docker containers, although I guess that you could make a Ubuntu-compiled binary work under Alpine as well by swapping musl for libs in the Alpine image.

This seems like a good starting point: https://github.com/better/alpine-tensorflow.
Can we have TF 1.14 or 1.13.1 for Ubuntu 18 and python 3.6?

python 3.6 is a default version on Ubuntu 18
I use MacOS High sierra with Python 3.6 and have G4560 without AVX support.
I would like to use one of the latest versions of Tensorflow.
My cpu support avx and avx2, but not avx512f. I build tensorflow myself. And tensorflow works well, but tensorboard still report the following error:

2019-02-04 07:39:40.286677: F tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:37] The TensorFlow library was compiled to use AVX512F instructions, but these aren't available on your machine.

I have two questions.
1. How can I set cpu feature support when building tensorflow? I think it is configured automatically when building on my platform.
2. How can I control tensorboard version? tensorboard is collected when installing tensorflow whl file. Is it possible that tensorflow is suitable for my cpu(avx and avx2 but not avx512f) but tensorboard is not suitable for my cpu?
