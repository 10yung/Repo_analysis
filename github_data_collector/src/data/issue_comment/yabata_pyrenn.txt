Is there a way to terminate the training of a network if the error rate has converged to a certain significant figure?
It is not possible to save an untrained network because of the missing Pnorm and Ynorm parameters.
This can be changed by defining them during creation of the NN and setting them to e.g. None ore Zero. Then changing "prepare_data" is necessary as well
