The example of the Spring is not working at all, not master branch nor swfit 5.
With Xcode 11 now supporting SPM for iOS and tvOS, it would be great if we can include a Package.swift file here. 

I submitted a pull request for this as well. 
Added Package.swift for SPM support and updated the README.md to include installation instructions.
add property animations: [String], which can mix animations and instead animation property.

add function clearAllAnimations() for next animation action

add sample AnimationsViewController

First of all: Thanks for posting the code for this!

It's working well with Swift 5/Xcode 10 but there's something weird I can't explain and that I haven't been able to fix yet:

When the keyboard is opened, there's always a space of about 50pts above it that doesn't seem to be useable, which makes one of my UI elements decrease its height, even though there should be enough space for it.

I opened a Stackexchange question [here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/56833750/2016165), explaining it in detail.

How do I get rid of this additional space or at least decrease its height to something like 10pts?
Cannot inherit from non-open class 'DesignableButton' outside of its defining module

So it can be overriden outside the module.

This adds support for SwiftPM manifest based dependency managers. Specifically this adds support for installing via [Accio](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio) but will probably also work with SwiftPM once it's integrated into Xcode.

Please note that this project is part of Accio's official [integration tests](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio/tree/work/1000-frameworks/Demo/Shared/AppDependencies) within the [Demo project](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio/tree/work/1000-frameworks/Demo).
I've had some trouble getting this to work consistently with Predictive Text on vs. off, and on all iPhone X models there is a significant gap between the top of the keyboard and the bottom of the constrained element, while the older iPhone models appear correctly.
