Is the entire company so focused on details?
Cannot set the alignment properly with default config.
For Icons too alignment cannot set.

EditText is not getting aligned properly and also the height of the bar set manually it crops the layout from below instead of adjusting.

Please guide.
After migrating to AndroidX, JellyToolbar still uses the old `android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar`
Would be nice to create a new release for AndroidX
May I know how to add optionsmenu beside the icon?
Wish to additional customization. How to get the cancelIcon & Icon view from the JellyToolbar?
Thanks
Following the demo (Literally copying and pasting but just changing some colors) the Toolbar presents a total misalignation. Tested in API 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21 and 19 and not working in any of them.

As you can see the search icon is missing all together, the filter icon that was just to the left of the search icon is aligned to the left and the JellyView is bigger and located to the right with visible X and hiding the navigation menu button

Is there a fix for that?

Thank you


like this:
```
            <com.yalantis.jellytoolbar.widget.JellyToolbar
                android:id="@+id/toolbar_main"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="?attr/actionBarSize"
                app:cancelIcon="@android:drawable/ic_menu_close_clear_cancel"
                app:icon="@android:drawable/ic_menu_search">
                <Spinner
                    android:id="@+id/spinner_nav"
                    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                    android:clipToPadding="false"/>
            </com.yalantis.jellytoolbar.widget.JellyToolbar>

The gif demo runs on an iPhone while JettyToolbar is for Android..
What tool have you used to generate the GIF?
clicking on the search action item should trigger the keyboard because it should allow us to start typing.

The X should be shown only when there is text being written, and we should have an arrow to close the search, which should also close the keyboard.
Instead, what I see is a single X button that clears the query and only then closes, but even when it closes, it doesn't close the keyboard.

Not only that, but when clicking the back button, it closes the activity even if there is still text written. When we are editing the text, and then click on the back button, it should either close the keyboard , or close the editing (or both, as done on the play store).
