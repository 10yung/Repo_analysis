Thanks Jerry,

Jerry, i know you told me before how to do this, I cannot find the past converstation about it.

I am wanting to remove the list button all together, what lines do I need to comment out to remove them.

Thanks

DownloadFile from github (https://github.com/vmware/webcommander/archive/master.zip) will raise the following exception *The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.*.

This is due to the fact that Powershell, by default, allows TLS 1.0 (see further information [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41618766/powershell-invoke-webrequest-fails-with-ssl-tls-secure-channel)) while github does not allow it anymore (see [here](https://githubengineering.com/crypto-removal-notice/)).
Hey @9whirls , I want to display the output that I get from a database using webCommander like this:

RowID DisplayHint DateTime                                 Date                  Day DayOfWeek DayOfYear Hour Kind  Millisecond
----- ----------- --------                                 ----                  --- --------- --------- ---- ----  -----------

84358 DateTime    Monday, January 01, 2018 1:47:53 AM      1/1/2018 12:00:00 AM    1 Monday            1 1    Local         812
84359 DateTime    Monday, January 01, 2018 2:17:58 AM      1/1/2018 12:00:00 AM    1 Monday            1 2    Local          62
84360 DateTime    Monday, January 01, 2018 2:47:39 AM      1/1/2018 12:00:00 AM    1 Monday            1 2    Local         672

I followed the vmPowerOn.ps1 script to display my output using foreach and XML : 


`foreach ($i in ($sqlOutput | sort)){
	$sqlQueryXml = $i | select RowID,DateTime, Date, Day, DayOfWeek, DayOfYear, Hour| convertTo-xml -as string -notypeinformation
	$sqlQueryXml = $sqlQueryXml.trimstart('<!--?xml version="1.0"?-->')
	$sqlQueryXml = $sqlQueryXml.replace('Object','SQLQuery')
	$sqlQueryXml
}`


But this is how it displays like, what should I change for it to display one property and it's value in one column like above.

Thank you!

I wrote a PS script that queries a database on the server that has webCommander on it and I found that to display the results of your script after running it on webcommander is to use writeStdout or writeCustomizedMsg and neither display the value. It just outputs 0. What should I do to display the right output?

`$numRow = $sqlOutput.Count;

writeCustomizedMsg ("The table contains: "+$numRow +" rows")`
The script to generate _def.xml doesnt work in x86 powershell (ifinite loop) but works fine in a x64 powershell. When i try to generate the definition for the xml file through the webcommander itself it simply loads forever.

All my PowerCLI modules can be read also properly from the terminal (both x86 and x64 ) but doesnt work from Webcommander. Please help. :/
WebCommander executes, and completes running the script in ~3 seconds with a return code of 4488. No results are displayed, and the script doesn't actually run. The script runs fine locally on both x86 powershell and x64. The script is executing a command remotely using invoke-command. What troubleshooting steps should I use to determine why WebCommander isn't executing the script?
Ok, I'm at a loss.  I have a script that creates multiple VMs, make some interface modifications, powers on VMs and then changes IPs.  All works well when I set my count for 1 VM but anymore then that and I get the XML Parsing error.  I have modified the max execution time in php.ini to 9000 and the issue still exists.  Not sure if there is some other timer that is being used which needs to be modified.  I'm running Windows 2012 Server and connecting to Vcenter 6.5.  I connecting to the webcommander interface directly on the webcommander server.  Any assistance will be greatly appreciated!
