I have php v5.6, v7.3, and v7.4

When I switch either 7.3 or 7.4 and type `php -v` in iTerm, it still logs me the 5.6 even if `phpinfo()` logs me right. So, when I install laravel with `laravel new my-app`, it shows me error: `This package requires php ^7.2 but your PHP version (5.6.40) does not satisfy that requirement.`

please help

I've been running PHP 5.6  (yes, I know it's way deprecated, but it's the version I must use for my day job)

`brew install brew-php-switcher`
This appears to have run `brew update`.. or at least updated my PHP 7.x install...
I believe this in turn updated a "icu4c" dependency

When running PHP 5.6 I now get:

```
php -v
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/libicui18n.62.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/php
  Reason: image not found
```
here's the fix:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/56242725/1371433

**However**
if I now `brew-php-switcher 7.3`
```
php -v
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/libicui18n.64.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/php
  Reason: image not found
```

PHP 5.6 requires icu4c 62.1 and PHP 7.3 requires icu4c 64.2
there seems to be no easy way to switch between the two..

supposedly `brew switch icu4c 64.2` should work, but I get a "not in cellar" error

The only fix seems to be to reinstall icu4c

62.1: `brew reinstall https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/575eb4bbef683551e19f329f60456b13a558132f/Formula/icu4c.rb`
64.2: `brew reinstall https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/master/Formula/icu4c.rb`
(I'm not sure how to find the direct link for 64.2..  It's likely that link will point to a newer ver in the future)

Anyone know how to get brew-php-switcher to also switch/update this dependency?



So this is working beautifully for us with MacOS, but we need it also for Linux.  Has someone forked and adapted this for Ubuntu or RHEL yet?  
This adds PHP 5.6 again.

While I’ve been given contributor permissions, this repository requires at least one approval in order to merge PRs, so with the only other contributor being largely inactive, improvements by myself are basically impossible. I’d like to help support some of the issues reported here, but it’s almost impossible. Would the community support me forking this repository and updating the Brew formula accordingly to use the fork?
Should add a `brew services stop phpXX; brew services start phpYY` so we don't have to do this manually every time I switch.
I have a problem where I have PHP 5.6 and 7.1 installed along with the Brew httpd server, but only PHP 5.6 will allow the httpd server to start.

If I run brew-php-switcher -s 56 and manually swap the httpd.conf file to load PHP 56, apache starts and all is right with the world.

If I do the same with 71, apache will not start and I will see:
[mpm_prefork:notice] [pid 78837] AH00173: SIGHUP received.  Attempting to restart
[core:notice] [pid 78837] AH00060: seg fault or similar nasty error detected in the parent process

in the error logs. Any further attempts to start apache manually through apachectl will not show anything new in the log file. The only difference between the httpd.conf files is:

LoadModule php5_module        /usr/local/Cellar/php56/5.6.33_9/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so
vs
LoadModule php7_module        /usr/local/Cellar/php71/7.1.14_25/libexec/apache2/libphp7.so

If I swap back to 56, apache starts just fine. I can manually run

brew unlink (56|71)
brew link (71|56)
cp httpd.conf.(71|56) httpd.conf
sudo apachectl restart

and get the same result. Any clues as to what might be wrong here?

Both php56 and php71 were installed with the --with-httpd flags
Now that I've installed the Brew apache server, the default High Sierra apache server has decided it doesn't want to run anymore.
Trying this project out today to see if it will work for me switching between PHP versions. However, I use Valet and find that I need to specify `-c=valet` to make sure Valet is restarted.

Is there a reason for this? If not, if I provided a way to either make restarting Valet happen by default *or* by some other means (env config values, etc) would that be accepted?
