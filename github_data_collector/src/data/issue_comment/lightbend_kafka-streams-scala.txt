I am using 0.11.0 streams

I have 3 nodes running kafka cluster of 3 broker

and i am running the 3 kafka stream with same application.id

each node has one broker one kafka stream application

everything works fine during setup

i bringdown one node, so one kafka broker and one streaming app is down

now i see exceptions in other two streaming apps and it never gets re balanced waited for hours and never comes back to norma

is there anything am missing?

i also tried looking into when one broker is down call stream.close, cleanup and restart this also doesn't help

can anyone help me?

Currently, KStreamS#transformValues only has support for ValueTransformer.
ValueTransformerWithKey support is needed.
Scala version https://github.com/ouertani/kafka-streams-scala/blob/scalish/src/main/scala/com/lightbend/kafka/scala/streams/KafkaStreamsS.scala of KafkaStreams
The `Consumed` class can be provided with `TimstampExtractor`.  
I suggest add this to the wrapper API.
Any plans to include the state store API in this project?
Hi,
