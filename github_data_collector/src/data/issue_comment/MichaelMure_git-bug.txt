[eve@computer go-term-text]$ git bug bridge pull github2
Error: missing identity token
```
The same issue also happens when running `git bug bridge auth` afterwards:
Repo from 1):
```bash
[eve@computer git-bug]$ git bug bridge auth 
51e8d3f github     token eve $TOKEN
```
Repo from 2):
```bash
[eve@computer go-term-text]$ git bug bridge auth
Error: identity doesn't exist
```

My guess is that this is related to the credentials stored in the global `.gitconfig` file. After both bridges have been configured, there is only a single auth block (ids shortended as I don't know whether they leak information):
```bash
[git-bug "auth.51e8d..."]
	kind = token
	userid = a66bcfdac7e2687ddb9310fc27bd011a5b8e334d
	target = github
	createtime = 1578397411
	value = $TOKEN
```
As you can see, it maps to the userid of the user created in 1). If I edit userid to the userid from step 2 (so 605b22282a8abb56095422679affa4bf7872a98e) I can query auth (`git bug bridge auth`) pull (`git bug bridge pull githubX`) in the repo from 2), but not anymore in the one from 1).

Generally, it would be nice to have a general bridge configuration that is usable from all my repositories and not bound to an individual (repository-local) identity. So I'd rather have a bridge "github" with token from my account that I can use with all my repositories on github.
If multiaccount-usage is required, the user could then create an "github-account2" bridge...

Thank you for this software and reading thus far in this bug report :) I hope this information is more-or-less complete and sufficient, but feel free to ping me if you need more information/a tester.

Best regards,
Simon

## To Reproduce

1. Pull from bug tracker (in my case, self-hosted GitLab) using bridge
1. Adopt an identity created when pulling via bridge
1. Comment on one of the existing issues locally using git-bug
1. Push to bug tracker using bridge

## Expected

Comment added to issue locally using git-bug should be present on issue in bug tracker (based on [this](https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug#exporter-implementations)).

## Actual

Comment not present on issue in bug tracker, but present when inspecting the issue locally using git-bug.

I've only tested with the GitLab bridge (and a self-hosted version of GitLab at that), so I'm not sure if the same thing happens with the other available bridges (or with the main gitlab.com).
@hoijui as you have done that before, could I ask you to check if my English got better ?
