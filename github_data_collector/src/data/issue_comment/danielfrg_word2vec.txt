Any system requirement for running the code faster
Tried to **install word2vec** with and without '-U' flag, with pip and pip3. Keep receiving the same error:
```
$ pip install word2vec

Hi,
I have a question: how to set parameters to be optimal when using word2vec to carry out word vector training. For example, window, iter, alpha ,min-count.

Looking forward to your advice or answers.
Best regards,
Thank you very much!
- On MacOS 10.13.6, I've tried Python-2.7 3.5 3.6 3.7, I can exec command word2vec in terminal and get a .bin file output, but it didn't work when run with python code 
- I cloned source code from git but got the same exception.

> example:
```
import word2vec as wv

if __name__ == '__main__':
wv.word2vec('../data/dict.txt.big.txt', '/Users/porridge/Downloads/Word2Vec.bin', size=300, verbose=True)
```

> Exceptions messages such as:
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'word2vec'
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'word2phrase'
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'word2clusters'
```
depends on which function I called
For example, win32-port.h is missing.
I have this review dataset containing reviews from Yelp and Amazon however, when I train word2vec on them it gives me the following output:
 `Starting training using file data.text  
Vocab size: 875 
Words in train file: 32863`
data.text looks something like this 
`hello world hello world`
without newlines.
,thanks
I ran into a problem “AttributeError: module 'word2vec' has no attribute 'word2vec'”

anaconda 4.3 on Centos 7

how to solve it？thanks

```
>>> import word2vec
>>> word2vec.word2vec('chatCorpus.txt', 'corpusWord2Vec.bin', size=50,verbose=True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: module 'word2vec' has no attribute 'word2vec'
```

In my docker container ubuntu:16.10

I well install this
`pip install word2vec`

But, I got error
`Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-lczJ96/word2vec/`

I must install "Cython" to fixed it.
`pip install Cython`

Hello,
I am using a Turkish dataset. (https://github.com/ahmetax/derlemtr/blob/master/buyuk_veri/hurriyet_noktasiz_2010_01.txt.rar)

word2vec.word2phrase(train=fin, output=fout, verbose=True) call immediately returns without making any thing, and without errors.
The problem might be related to special Turkish characters (utf-8).
I am using Python 3.5.1 on Ubuntu 16.04
word2vec.word2clusters() and word2vec.word2vec() run with no problems.
How can we solve that problem? (I can create phrase file by using a revised version of word2phrase.py from https://github.com/travisbrady/word2phrase )
Thank you.

Note: There is no problem when I use text8.

It turns out, that in the input files that I have - there are some `\xa0` characters which seem to be nothing else but a non-breaking space character. For some reason the program treats it as a word and creates a vector for it, so after running `word2vec.word2vec('...', '...', binary=0)`, in the wordvector I file I have a line:

```
  -0.297636 -0.038046 0.405622 ... -0.068306 0.909337 0.405136 
```

where the first character is the non-breaking space, the second is the space and then 100 floats. However when I try to read it into memory with `model.load()` the spaces are stripped, `-0.297636` is taken as the word and I get an error that the vector has only 99 numbers.

Do you have any idea how to fix this? Of course I can try to edit my input data, but there's a hell lot of it and I can't guarantee that the users of my software will provide cleaned data in the future.

Thanks!
