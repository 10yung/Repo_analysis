Session bundle and Frozen model formats have been deprecated in TensorFlow.js 1.0.
So I guess
```js
this.model = await loadFrozenModel(MODEL_FILE_URL, WEIGHT_MANIFEST_FILE_URL);
```
This doesn't work if I use the new api, `loadGraphModel` which seems to only accept the json file.

How do I make this cool game comparable with new api??

Hey there, awesome repo :). Do you happen to still have the original emoji training dataset?
Can you add QR code on the Desktop web site, so it will be easy to switch to mobile from desktop Browser?
Hi, first congrats on this amazing project !

Has anyone succeed to make it work on a Android mobile phone camera ?
Or do you have any hints on what to change in the code to make it work on it ?
