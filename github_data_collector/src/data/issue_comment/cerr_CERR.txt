Is there a function/possibility to calculate 1D between datasets in CERR? E.g. two profiles? If yes, do they have to have identical resolution?

This fixes issue, where radiopharma information is not exported or imported correctly in to planC. This fix is critical for PET imaging. [#368](https://github.com/cerr/CERR/issues/368).
PET DICOM export  does not export radiopharma Information sequence

As above, sequence export has not been implemented.
Reverts cerr/CERR#365
Is there a function in CERR that could be used to extend the FOV/CT dataset some distance from the border?
A design question why is the planC object a cell array, instead of a struct? Woudn't it be easier to do: planS.scan instead of planC{indexS.scan}? 

If there is a good reason perhaps it could be added to the wiki page on the PlanC object?

Dear Friends,

I am just trying to make a 4 field box treatment plan. I prepared using EGSnrc and imported all the beams firstly into seperate files and secondly into the same file. Although I can see all beams individually, I cannot merge them. Would you please guide me with that? I'm using Matlab2019a. Here is the error I get:
