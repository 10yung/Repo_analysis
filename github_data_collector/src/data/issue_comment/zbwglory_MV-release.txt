How do I graph the Motion Vector in an image? I need to visualize this data through an image, you can help me with this point. I would be very grateful. regards
Hi, 
The number of frames in the extracted motions vector images does not match the number of frames in the videos. It is not 1 frame difference in some sequences such as v_PoleVault_g14_c04 there are over 20 frames there are missed and it is not related to I frame I believe. 
Using the code on a local machine the same thing happens. 
How did you handle this in training?

I have one question about motion vector. I searched a lot for Internet and i found almost nothing about motion vector extraction. How do you extract the motion vector features from one video? 
 Could you share it please? 
./extract_mvs_sample.sh: line 3: ffmpeg-2.7.2/doc/examples/extract_mvs: No such file or directory

I am decompressing the tar file you had shared and I am ensuring the correct versions of opencv and ffmpeg have been installed but I am getting the above error.

@zbwglory Hellow, Mr Wang and Zhang
I am interested in your MV-CNN work. Could you share the prototxts for training. Thanks very much.
