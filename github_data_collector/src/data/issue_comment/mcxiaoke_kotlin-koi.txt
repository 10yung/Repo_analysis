I just updated to the androidX package and some methods like "toast", "longToast", "startActivityForResult" can't be find by the compiler.

This is caused because the Fragment class from the old support library has changed its package to `androidx.fragment.app.Fragment`, this way the compiler can't find the extension functions to the old `android.support.v4.app.Fragment`.
This is a very good library for Kotlin and Android, but I don't see any new updates from one year, why?
Would be great to see extension functions or DSL for SharedPreferences. This library has almost everything else needed to boost Android Development using Kotlin! 
Would be nice to be able to specify a class in order to avoid a cast to AppCompatActivity or any custom activity class.

Something like `getActivity<AppCompatActivity>()`
