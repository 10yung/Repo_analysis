This commit clarifies the `bup save` command's help message, by specifying that the `-n <name>` argument is mandatory. As of 0.30, it is flagged as optional (`[-n name]`).

Here are 4 patches that I've been using in the past 8 months to dramatically speed up bup when run against a distributed file system like GlusterFS (and actually makes it possible to use it in such scenarios).

I've shortly discussed them on the bup IRC channel in the past.

Please see the commit descriptions for details.

The use of `scandir` and the fix for `st_ino` are reasonably well tested (over thousands of bup runs), the `no-nonstat-metadata` flag has not been tested as extensively.

One question:

Right now, when I run `make test` on Ubuntu 16.04, it fails with:

```
/home/niklas/src/bup/bup ftp
Warning: scandir support missing; install python-scandir to speed up directory traversals.
Makefile:197: recipe for target 'tmp-target-run-test-ftp' failed
make[1]: *** [tmp-target-run-test-ftp] Error 1

/home/niklas/src/bup/bup ftp
Warning: scandir support missing; install python-scandir to speed up directory traversals.
Commands: ls cd pwd cat get mget help quit
! test-ftp:63   'Commands: ls cd pwd cat get mget help quit\n' == 'Warning: scandir support missing; install python-scandir to speed up directory traversals.\nCommands: ls cd pwd cat get mget help quit\n' FAILED

! Program returned non-zero exit code (2)                           FAILED
```

This is because I'm emitting the `Warning: scandir support missing; install python-scandir to speed up directory traversals` when scandir couldn't be found. I think having this warning is good because scandir really helps a huge deal with performance.

But Ubuntu 16.04 doesn't have `python-scandir` available, only >= 17.10 has it.

(How) should I modify the two failing tests so that they ignore if this warning is emitted?

Thanks!

Trying to do `os.fsync()` on a CIFS mounted file system from Linux is not supported. This patch makes the failure non-fatal.

On 64-bit Cygwin, there is no pandoc package. The native Windows pandoc installs in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Pandoc" by default. This adds quotes around the path to pandoc to accommodate the spaces.

just a small dirty fix, to make allow_other really work.
changes: if no metadata available set uid/gid of user running the script as well as setting mode to 16384 (40555)

Hello,

It's an experimental ftp server for bup. There are some major problems then this pull request is not for a merge but mostly to discuss around this idea.
On Windows it's not possible to use bup-fuse of course, then for the user it's a bit difficult to navigate and copy the files without using the file explorer. With an ftp server, it's possible to browse the repository a bit like fuse but on Windows. An other idea could be webdav...

I'm a newb with Python (and it's just a first draft), this server is very inspired on https://gist.github.com/scturtle/1035886

One major bug seems related to a race condition and a second about some directories which can not be open.

Regards

This change allows the bup package files to be installed
into /usr/share/bup. This is nice to comply with
packaging guidelines of some Linux distributions (where
/usr/lib or /usr/lib64 are reserved for platform specific
files whereas platform independent ones are going to be
installed in /usr/share).
