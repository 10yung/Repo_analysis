I was considering installing ajenti, but immediately stopped when I saw this: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1l80aJ-CGbzZLfl2HkVYCA_U74gpd0RdC

using ajenti v1.2.23. 
when using python to update data for variables in xml,like"self.find('value').text = xxx", the entire page is refreshing.Is there a way to specify to refresh a certain part?
Can we use Ajenti-V packages ? 

any development guidelines ?
As debian is progressing, debian 9 end of life will be 2022, i think we need to prepare towards debian 10. 
I got this error:

Hi,
When I want to active my wildcard ssl certification, Ajenti returned this error, and configuration section disappeared:
```

I have succesfully installed ajenti v on vps. I have added new website through its menu and configurated everything until its done. When i check the website, it displayed Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page. I have setup directory for my website file into svr/doaminname/. Anyone can help?
Without installing ajenti - could someone tell me if it's possible to do split terminals or terminal tabs or run multiple terminal sessions?
i see that the master brance is still being updated and 1.x not anymore
is Ajenti Core the new standart of ajenti

also do i need to write all the plugins my self ? or will Ajenti Core be what 1.x was down the line
Repo seems to serve only branch version 1, if possible to automate building of master branch, let people be able to update with their package manager.

Unless package creation itself fails.

Could be ajenti-master or ajenti-dev and migrated to ajenti2 when you feel this is stable enough.
