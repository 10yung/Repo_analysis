Hi all
Thanks for this
I would like to suggest that since this is a docker installation, users should not need to have anything else besides docker, specifically composer. 

in addition windows is notorious for it's installation scripts problems relating to CRLF .
[solution here](http://www.devops-blog.net/docker/advice-on-building-docker-images-on-windows)
Ensures that on windows sh files won't have CR LF that breaks docker-compose on default git configuration.
Fix for /usr/bin/env: 'php\r' error on first `composer run-script docker:build` run.

SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1452 Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`eabase`.`rbac_auth_item`, CONSTRAINT `rbac_auth_item_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`rule_name`) REFERENCES `rbac_auth_rule` (`name`) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE)
The SQL being executed was: INSERT INTO `rbac_auth_item` (`name`, `type`, `description`, `rule_name`, `data`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) VALUES ('editor', 2, 'editor', '', '', NULL, NULL)
As the documentation says:

> You may have noticed that the controller ID user appears in plural form as users in the endpoint URLs. This is because [[yii\rest\UrlRule]] automatically pluralizes controller IDs when creating child URL rules. You may disable this behavior by setting [[yii\rest\UrlRule::pluralize]] to be false.

Fixed translation error for gender
Updated the dotenv declaration to use the latest version's syntax. Made this update to avoid any possible dependency conflict when adding new composer libraries.
