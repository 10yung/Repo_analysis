### Tool/Language/etc

We reference **Voila** which is now Capto. 
I bought this tool. I would highly recommend **OBS** instead.

I thought OBS was complicated at first, but then I follow a great youtube tutorial and I was set :)

### Other Information
If it's a go I'll prepare a PR.

Cheers!

### Tool/Language/etc

The Homebrew Cask section talks about Caskroom and Cask being a separate add-on for Homebrew. This is no longer the case; Cask support [has been folded into core Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/issues/14384) and is now installed with all Homebrew installations.

This section could be condensed down to just some suggestions of particular Casks to install (and maybe a description of what makes a Cask different from a regular Homebrew formula). There's no longer any need for Cask-specific setup.


Although it is still in use in Emacs section. Please update.

brew would not be able to look for older versions of java, like java8 mentioned in the documentation, until cask is updated with versions.

Hi,

Are you interested if I propose a pull request with a new category trying to automate the deployment of this mac-setup guide with Ansible ? Like this one : https://github.com/z0ph/ansible-mac-install (fork)

zoph.

Hey,

I'm a Java Developer, and I use [sdkman](http://sdkman.io/) to manage Java versions (and other [sdks](http://sdkman.io/sdks.html)).

Do you think that is valuable add this config on Java setup or in a different topic?

If so, I'll be pleasure to make a pr.

### Tool/Language/etc

Setting environmental variables (especially ones that gets picked up in non-terminal launched apps) seems to be a bit of a challenge?

Best I can find seem to be the top answer of [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25385934/setting-environment-variables-via-launchd-conf-no-longer-works-in-os-x-yosemite) using `environment.plist`. 

### Other Information

Happy to write this up, just want to check there isn't an obviously better way to do this.

[direnv](https://direnv.net) is a wonderful auto bash environment enable/disabler.  Not only can it activate/activate virtual environments (Python/Ruby), but it can also set/unset env variables.

### Other Information
I've been updating the WIKI as I've adopted the tool and happy here as needed.
