In order to develop my game, I need a keydown event but I didn't find it.
Hello, I'm trying to use `InputFile` to load a single file, but I can't find a way to do it.

I was trying to reuse the code from one of the examples:

https://github.com/gabrielrcouto/php-gui/blob/7849019063a2513b6b865c09c97991d40e20ce18/examples/11-forms/02-example.php#L22-L28

I was hopping to force _single file selection_ removing the following line: 

https://github.com/gabrielrcouto/php-gui/blob/7849019063a2513b6b865c09c97991d40e20ce18/examples/11-forms/02-example.php#L27

But it turns out that the example doesn't work correctly any more, now `\Gui\Components\InputFile::getValue` will always return an empty array, even when a file is selected.

Is this a bug, or am I doing something wrong?



I wish i could destroy all the objects and rebuild another view, but it works for like 2 times and then it glitch
After i just create #1 window on new Application(object), fill my data closing #1 window and try to create diffrent #2 window on diffrent new Application(object) but #2 window is blank, any object isnt on it. In logs i see ids starts again for new object of Application start from begin, but i "saw" something weird on #1 window - something appear like i want on #2 window. It can be like lib cant use two same ids on totally diffrent object of Application? (using commit ref: 8df4fb7c24e14c6215f6c1b9d45fe36fb4da51fa - yea i know i can pull new changes but i dont want because its too much to change for my project) 
Creating new classes manually for too long, I would like to automate it.
I want to set and display default value for select but i dont see any function for Select to set that. It issue or can be that in future? Someone can help?

dump($text1->getValue());

When my string is long and long，no return value
Can the RPC system work in any another language?

If the PHP is implemented in another language and it has a similar JSONRPC library will it be able to work with the FreePascal interface?

By that I mean whether the FPC side has PHP related dependencies.
Subsequent to #124 that seem to have been closed by mistake 😕 

@reisraff I decided that it would be much easier to review php-cs-fixer config instead of reviewing all files, so I added a php-cs-fixer config and executed it, hope you like it 👍
