This pull request stops non-music apps from changing the Touch Bar now playing state while music is playing as Mac Media Key Forwarder controls the music (fixes https://github.com/milgra/macmediakeyforwarder/issues/100).

To achieve this the undocumented [MediaRemote](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/MediaRemote.framework) framework is used. The following sources were used to achieve this solution:
- The WebKit source
- GitHub repos with the `MediaRemote.h` header
- Disassembling the MediaRemote private framework using Hopper and `nm`
- A lot of trial and error

After listening to the `kMRMediaRemoteNowPlayingApplicationIsPlayingDidChangeNotification` event two crucial functions are called:
- `MRMediaRemoteSetNowPlayingApplicationOverrideEnabled`
This stops other applications from changing the now playing state in the Touch Bar.
- `MRMediaRemoteSetNowPlayingApplicationPlaybackStateForOrigin`
This updates the actual now playing state, without the override method above this will only work once per session.

Alternative solutions that were investigated:
- Calling `MRMediaRemoteSendCommandToApp` to simulate sending a play event (`MRMediaRemoteSendCommand` sends it to the app that has focus), the method signature seems to require a complex Protobuf object though.
- Calling `MRNowPlayingClientSetBundleIdentifier` to set Music or Spotify to be the active app, this requires a `MRNowPlayingClientProtobuf` object though.
- Calling `[iTunes playpause]` twice to seize control back to the Music app. This is not ideal as this results in a brief pause.
- Simply calling `[iTunes playpause]` when media from another app starts to play. This ensures the now playing state is correct but stops music playback.
- If the MediaRemote framework could not be used, the `NPUNowPlayingControllerNowPlayingInfoDidChange` notification could possibly be listened to with the right header file included.

Spotify is supported but there is an issue where the Touch Bar will not update from within Spotify when the play button is used even without Mac Media Key Forwarder installed. This is beyond the scope of this application but could be fixed by Spotify or by creating a new tool from this code.

The bundle identifier was changed to the proper case for the Music app as string matching is used to check for it, when using Apple Events the case doesn't seem to matter.
Can you please add Prioritize Browser to the drop-down. currently, the chrome browser keeps highjacking it regardless of what your app says. so if it can be told not to hijack it when not prioritised that might fix the issue
The play/pause button updates correctly when only the Music app is being used. If a YouTube video is played then paused in Chrome or Safari the Touch Bar will show a play icon even though the Music app is playing music.

The problem can be fixed in Chrome by disabling the the [Hardware Media Key Handling](chrome://flags/#hardware-media-key-handling) flag. It does not appear to be possible to disable this in Safari. Firefox is not affected.

It may be possible to keep an internal state based on the `com.apple.iTunes.playerInfo` event and update the player state based on the `NPUNowPlayingControllerNowPlayingInfoDidChange` event dispatched from the `NowPlayingTouchUI` process.

Play / pause doesn't work when use play / pause open Music.app, it's still when I press next media or activate the Music.app window manually. My macOS version is 10.15.1 Beta (19B86a).macmediakeyforwarder version is 3.1 (build 1).
When I'm using YouTube for example, if I pause the video and double-tap my AirPod it resumes YouTube video instead of resuming Spotify music.

However, if I try to do the same manipulation with the keyboard play/pause key, it works just fine.
First off, thanks for this amazing app ! Unfortuanelty, after I just updated to 10.14.6, MacMediaKeyForwwarder just got stuck "not responding" - even after restartting and cleaning all app files related and reenabling the security preferences. This seems to be the same issue that many other reported after an apple update.

After compiling the app from source, the IDE traced the bug to the following line in code:

In applicationDidFinishLaunching:
<img width="968" alt="Screenshot 2019-08-21 at 12 22 51" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2837147/63424960-c9c20500-c40f-11e9-8c1f-5d3820ee8c3d.png">

Hope this helps, unfortuanetly I don't have enough knowledge in CGTaps or Coca to fix this myself.

Hey!

First of all, thank you for this app. It works really well and i really can't use the media keys on a mac without it anymore :smile:

Just one quick question, would it be possible to add the feature to run this application on the background? I like a clean menu bar and never change the settings of this app to be honest.

Thank you!
