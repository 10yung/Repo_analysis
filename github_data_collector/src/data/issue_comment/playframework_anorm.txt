I do understand that Anorm builds on top of JDBC which is inherently synchronous, just like most of the underlying drivers and protocols. However there are some databases that natively support asynchronous queries such as the postgresql and there are new database APIs like jasync-sql coming up that try to support this.
I like the simplicity Anorm, but I'd also like to use the asynchronous query support of the postgresql.

Are there any plans for supporting asychronous querying?
