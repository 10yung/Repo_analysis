The invoices and quotes are displayed on a single line (which is what most users would expect).
This improves usability and is easier to read.
I've also added an extra column for a discount for the line.
Initial update to fix Bootstrap version and PHP 7.3 compatibility

And here it is:

- Updated Bootstrap dependencies to 3.4.1,
- Fixed PHP 7.3 compatability
- Fixed errors along the way (Gruntfile)
Hi, as said in slack, and regarding this post:
https://community.invoiceplane.com/t/topic/8502

I've updated bootstrap dependencies to 3.4.1, 
but in order to do that I had to go through all the errors and warning while building with an updated environment to todays repos versions.
This led to updating deps, updating grunt (hard to make it work without that),
php deps.

I've also fixed a couple of errors in the setup process.
One was a problem with HMVC plugin in Codeigniter and php 7.

As soon as you merge, I can merge the it version,
Thanks in advance.

Grazie in anticipo
Hello,

i hope you can understand my bad english.. sorry for that.

I use recurring invoices. When i setup the recurring invoice i have the option to enable the smal green checkbox at the left site.
So i can choose, what item is set for the recurring invoice.

This function doesnt work. I set only 1 of 2 Items but the new recurring invoice create with both items.
