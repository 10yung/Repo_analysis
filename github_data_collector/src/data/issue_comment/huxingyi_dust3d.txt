I've been trying to build Dust3D with Raspbian OS but I seem to be missing some files
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -linstant-meshes
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -ltbb_static

I followed the tutorial from https://blogs.dust3d.org/2019/07/09/dust3d-on-raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/

I try to import obj to try the software to use it in our photogrammetry workflow cause some options are very interesting in the post treatment but never found how to do it ... is it possible ?
Love what you guys did. Dust3D is absolutely perfect to work from an IPAD PRO, would you consider releasing it on app store ?

As soon, as I open any example, it appears on the screen, then immediately closes the window (crashes).
The terminal, from which the app is executed, writes:

An exception in floating point operation (RAM stack was dumped to disk)

I've tried versions:
dust3d-1.0.0-beta.27-x86_64.AppImage
dust3d-1.0.0-beta.26-x86_64.AppImage

this is something I have noticed with 2 models I was practicing with dust3d. id send the actual files, but it crashed when I was about to send this originally.

but this second time I did get a screen shot & am quite confused as to why the model has its left leg on the right hand side. its really odd. so when I then put in the right arm/leg, it will go to the left hand side

im not sure what im doing wrong since im just testing things out right away. plus looked at how you had set things up in a video

thanks

again, great software. fantastic & fast. but extra export options would be nice.

I had to use blender for a simple tutorial I was making, in which I needed several different file formats to show them loading into a project. but it would be nice if dust3d had extra export options

such as these ones from blender [screenshot below]. im not saying all of these would be nice, but some extra formats would be great, more so because of peoples preferences. though I do know `.fbx` is in the options already.
if not thats fine, but just more so asking üòâ

thanks again for this great software. can't wait to dive in further & get some nice models made for my own projects & even teachings üòâ 
I have had issues with Dust3D UI scaling on both Windows and Linux. The screenshot below shows the parts window with the UI too small to be usable and it does not scale to fill the space when I drag the separator between 3d workspace and the side menu.

This screenshot was taken from a 1440p monitor but the same issue occurs for me on 1080p monitors. I am not sure if this is a duplicate of a previous issue regarding UI sizing.

Hi,
Would be great for 3d printing to have the ability to export to .stl

Following are examples of why a coordinate system orientation display would help with modeling.

Without it, lots of mental load and management on the brain ensues.

Thank you,
Satish.

At the moment, I need to go find older files from the file system. It will be very beneficial to add a menu in the File menu that will let us load recently used/loaded files.

Thank you,
Satish.
