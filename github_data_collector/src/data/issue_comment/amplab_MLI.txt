Apparently Scala 2.10 has added method with the same name `toVector` to `IndexedSeq` class, which cause compilation problems when trying MLI with latest Spark 0.9

Hullo,

This pull request adds a corresponding `sc.stop()` for each `val sc = new SparkContext(...)`

to avoid `address already in use` errors that come up running `./sbt/sbt test` against the current version of spark.

Decision Tree algorithm implemented on top of Spark RDD.

Key features:
- Supports both classification and regressions
- Supports gini, entropy and variance for information gain calculation
- Supports calculating quantiles using a configurable fraction of the data
- Performance accuracy verified by comparing with scikit-learn
