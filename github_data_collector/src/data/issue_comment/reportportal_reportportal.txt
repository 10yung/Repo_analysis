**Describe the bug**
I am trying to create a launch by making API call. See the example powershell script below:
I had been using this script for long. I had created several launches with name 'currentgen_develop'
**If I change launch name then launch is getting created.**
### Is there any limit on number of launches with same name?

```
$apiKey = "4c5aa448-497d-485d-802f-00f090b768be"
$project = "abc"
$url = "http://101.19.404.69:8080/api/v1/" +$project + "/launch"
$headers = @{"Authorization" = "BEARER " + $apiKey}
$startTime = Get-Date
$tags = [System.Collections.ArrayList]@()
$tags.Add("develop")
$tags.Add("2230")

$body = @{
    description=''
    mode='DEBUG'
    name='currentgen_develop'
    start_time=$startTime.ToUniversalTime().ToString("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.ffffZ")
    tags=$tags
}

$launch = ""
$json = $body | ConvertTo-Json
$launch = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $json -ContentType 'application/json'
Write-Host "Launch Id:" $launch.id
```
### tried on linux box too
```
set -x #echo off

url='http://101.19.404.69:8080/api/v1/abc/launch'
header="Authorization: bearer 4c5aa448-497d-485d-802f-00f090b768be"
body="{  
   	   \"description\": \"\",  
	   \"mode\": \"DEBUG\" ,
	   \"name\": \"currentgen_develop\",  
	   \"start_time\": \"$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%T.%3NZ")\", 
	   \"tags\": [\"develop\",\"2230\"]  
	 }"
echo $url
echo $body

curl -X POST "$url" --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' --header "$header" -d "$body"
```

But this is resulting in 
```
Invoke-RestMethod : {"error_code":5000,"message":"Unclassified error [null]"}
At line:21 char:11
+ $launch = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Method Post -Headers $headers  ...

    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : WebCmdletWebResponseException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.InvokeRestMethodCommand
```

**Expected behavior**
Launch should be created successfully

I am using report portal with Kotlin and TestNG and gradle as the build tool

```
compile group: 'com.epam.reportportal', name: 'agent-java-testng', version: '4.2.0'
```

When I run the tests via gradle wrapper, it generates a bunch of artifacts under build folder after the run. I am specially interested in the .xml files contents under /build/test-results/<gradle task name>/<test class.xml>

Since it has a <system-out> tag with all the standard output. This has useful context around the test failure such as what API calls/flows were triggered before failure.

Is there a way to get this information to show up in report portal?

build.gradle
```
repositories {
    jcenter()
    mavenCentral()
    mavenLocal()

    ...
    maven { url "http://dl.bintray.com/epam/reportportal" }
    ...
}


task runTests(type: Test) {
    useTestNG() {
        testLogging.showStandardStreams = true
        useDefaultListeners = false
        listeners << 'com.epam.reportportal.testng.ReportPortalTestNGListener'
        includeGroups System.getProperty('tag', 'NONE')
    }
}
```

I am using report portal with Kotlin and TestNG and gradle as the build tool

```
compile group: 'com.epam.reportportal', name: 'agent-java-testng', version: '4.2.0'
```

By default, all the tests are grouped under a single Gradle suite and Gradle test with a list of all Before/After setup and teardowns and individual tests. However, testNG grade reports have the flexibility of seeing tests grouped under the classes in which they belong to.

Is it possible to customize the report portal to display the tests under the classes they belong to?

build.gradle
```
repositories {
    jcenter()
    mavenCentral()
    mavenLocal()

    ...
    maven { url "http://dl.bintray.com/epam/reportportal" }
    ...
}


task runTests(type: Test) {
    useTestNG() {
        testLogging.showStandardStreams = true
        useDefaultListeners = false
        listeners << 'com.epam.reportportal.testng.ReportPortalTestNGListener'
        includeGroups System.getProperty('tag', 'NONE')
    }
}
```

**Describe the bug**
I have test with 17 data sets in yml file
Before it was split into separate test methods in RP, now RP shows it like attempts for Retry
So, I can't see failed items as 'To investigate'
**Expected behavior**
Each data set should be equals to test method in RP, failed item should be marked as 'To investigate'

**Screenshots**
previous behavior

**Describe the solution you'd like**
As a user with the role of a project manager or members, I want to be able to filter bugs by type in the Unique Bugs widget taking into account the types of bugs added in our project.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
On our project, defects have several degrees of importance. We need to display a table of blockers for the new version of the product.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
As a user with the rights of a project manager, I want to be able:
1. highlight various dashboards in color, so that it is more convenient for users to move between a large number of dashboards.
2. group dashboards into separate areas according to an arbitrary parameter or make nested multi-level dashboards (a dashboard contains a group of dashboards).

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Our project will use many different dashboards (more than 20). In the current situation, they are arranged sequentially and the only way to sort it out somehow is to assign such names so that when sorting they line up in the right order. But this is not enough. It is necessary to divide dashboards into groups.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
As a user with the rights of a project manager, I want to be able to move widgets between dashboards.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I am customizing dashboards. In the process, I understand that the existing dashboard needs to be split into two. To do this, I need to transfer some of the widgets to a new dashboard. I make them shared, add them to a new dashboard. But I canâ€™t remove these widgets from the previous dashboard, because if I delete a shared widget from one dashboard, it is automatically deleted from another. A similar situation in the case of combining two dashboards.
**Describe the solution you'd like**
As a user with the role of a project manager, I want to be able to copy widgets, which allows me to create similar widgets with different filters.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When I customize dashboards, I need to create a series of similar widgets that have the same functionality and are based on filters, where the difference is only in the parameters. For example, I create widgets with launch statistics for each environment. Conveniently, after you create a widget, you get the next one by simply copying this one and changing the name of the widget and its filter.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
As a user with the manager permission role, I would like to be able to edit a group of filters at the same time in order to replace one common value used in these filters with a new one.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I have a large number of filters indicating the version of the product. As soon as a new version of a product appears, I need to change it in all filters. It is long and uncomfortable.

As a user with a manager permission role, I would like to have the ability to assign the users from the project members list as "test owners" for the existing tests, so they would be responsible for maintaining and analyzing them.
