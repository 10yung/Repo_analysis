We should be up to date!
Bootimage install fails with nightly rust installed. Does not like the function "read_to_string". I was able to get it to work using the stable rust branch. Not sure what other problems that will cause down the line though. 
I view this one of the best features in an OS kernel, as it allows reusing anything above the hardware abstracting layer on more than one architecture.
Is multi-architecture support something this project aims for? 
In order to manage the memory, the OS should know how much it has. Extra information about reserved addresses and memory holes (maybe these are the same, I don't know yet), should also be taken into account.
This is super off the wall, but intermezzOS through kvm would be amazing http://lwn.net/Articles/658511/

marking as "question" because who knows if we even want to do this

@ketsuban has an example here: https://github.com/Ketsuban/finisterre

I think this would be a good idea before going to usermode, so cc https://github.com/intermezzOS/kernel/issues/82

If anyone is interested in tackling this, please give it a try!

Right now, we only implement ISRs with no error codes. We should also be able to handle the ones that push an error code.

This has a bare-bones impl, but could be made much better.

Run more than one user program at once.

To start filesystem support, get FAT32 going.
