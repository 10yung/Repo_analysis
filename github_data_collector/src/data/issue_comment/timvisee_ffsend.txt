My usage of `ffsend` is to quickly send archives from the CLI. To that end would it be possible to make `ffsend upload` the default action, so that we can just write `ffsend <file>` to upload the file ?
An `apt` repository for those using a Debian-base distribution who don't use `snap` would be great.

Since packages are already been generated for other platforms, perhaps a tool like [fpm](https://fpm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packages.html) could be used to convert 1 to the other?

[Guides exist](https://medium.com/sqooba/create-your-own-custom-and-authenticated-apt-repository-1e4a4cf0b864) to walk through the setting up of an apt repo too, though of course the apache server doesn't have to be used - another or a pre-existing server can be used instead.
Thank you for your effort on this amazing tool.

However, ffsend is not working behind HTTP proxy environment

```
D:\>ffsend -V
ffsend 0.2.44

D:\>set http_proxy=http://localhost:8888

D:\>set https_proxy=http://localhost:8888

D:\>echo %http_proxy%
http://localhost:8888

D:\>echo %https_proxy%
http://localhost:8888

D:\>ffsend download https://send.firefox.com/download/e964034c63ea4200/#eDr-No69mmDs_QCk3Ui5MA

`curl` has no problem connect to https://send.firefox.com, but `ffsend` does not even send request to fiddler.

Hello, I'm wondering if you have considered support for reading from stdin or a named pipe to avoid having to write a file to disk. For example, all of the following fail with various errors:

```
echo foo | ffsend upload --name foo.txt
echo foo | ffsend upload --name foo.txt -
ffsend upload --name foo.txt <(echo foo)
```

Thanks!

The README for the project mentions a roadmap file:

https://github.com/timvisee/ffsend/blob/master/ROADMAP.md

But no such file exists. It'd be cool to view the roadmap for this project, it sounds super interesting.
