Hello, i have the below code for my options for takepicture async

```
  let data = await this.camera.recordAsync({
        quality: RNCamera.Constants.VideoQuality['480p'],
        videoBitrate: 600*1000,
        mirrorVideo: true
      }).then((s)=>{
        this.camera.pausePreview()
        data = {...s,type : "video"}
        console.log("data to send", data)
```

I took two videos. The first one was a video with the back camera (taking a picture of a scene). Whilst the second one was with the front camera (selfie) with me speaking. However the 2nd one came out with a .mov. They both have the same codec. 

Why is the file format different? And how to make it consistent?  Thanks!

data to send {"codec": "avc1", "deviceOrientation": 1, "isRecordingInterrupted": false, "type": "video", "uri": "file:///var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/0507A3C9-7F8C-4C3E-BE02-521F3E5E748C/Library/CachesCameraFlip/8051EFDC-BF3D-44C3-9897-DE1BB48B4E2D.**mp4**", "videoOrientation": 1}

# Feature-Request
ANDROID / IOS

**Describe the Feature**
Get RAW image from camera in JS thread.

This function can be useful for training neural networks. All cameras in mobile devices use software algorithms for image processing. This has a negative effect on the final image. Some details that are important for training may be lost. The RAW image acquisition function could solve this problem without developing a native module.

hi,

In my android studio build gradle is failed i dont know how so then i check the log and i saw this error Error:Could not find method compile() for arguments [com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:25.3.1] on object of type org.gradle.api.internal.artifacts.dsl.dependencies.DefaultDependencyHandler.

# Bug Report

- Did you try latest release? Yes - 3.15.1
- Did you try master? No
- Did you look for existing matching issues? Yes

**Platforms**

Tested on Android Only

- Android: 10, Samsung S10+, One UI 2.0
- react-native-camera: 13.5.1
- react-native: 0.61.5
- react: 16.9.0
- react-navigation: 4.0.10

**Description/Current Behaviour**

On rotating a phone with One UI, without auto-rotate enabled, the user can press a button to change the phones orientation otherwise nothing happens.

When rotating the phone and NOT pressing the button, the bounds for barcodes and text scanned by RNCamera (haven't tested facial features) are rotated anyway, causing them to be in incorrect positions on the screen.

**Expected Behaviour**

When the camera is rotated but orientation has not changed, feature positions do not get rotated.

**Steps to Reproduce**

- Enable google barcode detection, and record the position
- Check how the position changes normally (pitching up and down changes y dimension, etc)
- Rotate the device WITHOUT changing orientation, then check position again, this time
pitching up and down changes the x dimension.

**Additionals**

My explanation may be a bit confusing sorry. I have attached a video that shows more clearly what is happening.

In the video I first move the camera whilst the device is vertical. Then I rotate the device without changing orientation, and move the camera. Then I change the orientation. The yellow dot is calculated to be at the centre of the bounds given by onGoogleVisionBarcodesDetected.

I've tested this with onGoogleVisionBarcodesDetected, and onTextRecognized

# React Native for Windows vNext support

**Describe the Feature**
<!--describe the requested Feature-->
[React Native for Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows) enables React Native apps to target Windows via UWP. React Native for Windows is under active development by Microsoft. Most recently, the platform has been updated to leverage high-performance C++ (known as "RNW vNext"). Now that the RNW vNext supports native modules as a platform, we have identified several key native modules to add Windows support for (including react-native-camera) to help validate that the platform has the right set of capabilities and to bootstrap the community of modules that target Windows.

**Possible Implementations**
<!--describe how to implement the feature-->

Microsoft devs are signed up to help build out this implementation, but we wanted to track this work here as well to help provide some transparency that we're doing this work and hoping to contribute back to the repo.

**Ask your Question**

Hello! I am not good at English.

My question is about the react-native-camera file.
I followed the Installation section of the following link.
https://react-native-community.github.io/react-native-camera/docs/installation

I've read several related documents, but I'm not sure what they mean.
I would like to try the PinchGestureHandler function included in ZoomView.js.

Can the examples included in "react-native-camera" be executed as an expo client?
I wonder how to implement it.
Should I run as an Android studio?

Thank you

+Perhaps it should be run as an Android studio.

# Video recording is not working on iPhone XR iOS version 13.1.x

Could you please assist us regarding this issue.

Also the "codec" property does not work for iOS to reduce the video quality using "videoBitrate" property.

Code:
<RNCamera
                        ref={ref => {
                            this.camera = ref;
                        }}
                        style={styles.preview}
                        type={RNCamera.Constants.Type.back}
                        androidCameraPermissionOptions={null}
                        androidRecordAudioPermissionOptions={null}
                        defaultVideoQuality={RNCamera.Constants.VideoQuality['480p']}
</RNCamera>


const options = { 
                    quality     : RNCamera.Constants.VideoQuality['480p'],
                    videoBitrate: 1*1000*1000
};

if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
                    options['codec'] = RNCamera.Constants.VideoCodec['H264'];
}
const promise = this.camera.recordAsync(options);
const data = await promise;
if (data.uri) {
                        const uriData = Platform.OS === 'ios' ? data.uri.replace('file://','') : data.uri;
                        this.videoData = uriData;
                        this.uploadVideo(uriData);
}

Also when debugged the recordAsync response for iPhone XR iOS version 13.1.x it display "codec:  hvc1", which I think is not supported in RNCamera. 

Thank you in advance for the help.
# Bug Report

**To Do First**

- [x] Did you try latest release?
- [x] Did you try master?
- [x] Did you look for existing matching issues?

**Platforms**

Android

**Versions**

- Android: 8.1.0
- react-native-camera: 3.15.1
- react-native: 0.57.1
- react: 16.6.0-alpha.8af6728
- react-navigation: 3.11.1

**Description/Current Behaviour**

Launching an application with react-native-camera@3.15.1 fails in build phase with following message:

> Task :react-native-gesture-handler:compileDebugJavaWithJavac FAILED

> ...node_modules/react-native-gesture-handler/android/src/main/java/com/swmansion/gesturehandler/react/RNGestureHandlerEvent.java:3: error: package android.support.v4.util does not exist. import android.support.v4.util.Pools;

> ...node_modules/react-native-gesture-handler/android/src/main/java/com/swmansion/gesturehandler/react/RNGestureHandlerButtonViewManager.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.

**Expected Behaviour**

Expect build to succeed, as it does when I build with react-native-camera@2.11.2.

So with version 2.11.2, it builds ok. What is weird is that this react-native-camera does not even have react-native-gesture-handler as its dependencies. Still for some reason, it fails for that if I apply the latest version of this library, and works with version 2.11.2.

**Steps to Reproduce**

Build react-native project for android with following dependencies:
    "react": "16.6.0-alpha.8af6728",
    "react-native": "^0.57.1",
    "react-native-camera": "^3.15.1",
    "react-native-gesture-handler": "1.0.17",
    "react-navigation": "^3.11.1",

No expo used here.
