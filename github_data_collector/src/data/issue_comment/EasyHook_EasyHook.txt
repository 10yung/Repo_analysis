Attempting to inject: C:\Users\msajid\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\Target\Release\BeepHook.dll

RhInjectLibrary failed with error code = -1073741801
Unable to allocate memory in target process.

Getting this error!
Followed this basic tutorial.

Hi.

I have been running easy hook on Windows 8.1 pro for several years now.

I am trying to make the same hooks work on Windows server 2019/Windows 10 and have been running into the following `RhInjectLibrary()` errors on some executables I am trying to hook:

- 00007FFCF70CFD20 (on 64 bit processes)
- 6F329B58 (on 32 bit processes)

The failure happens almost on all runs but there are runs where the DLL is injected correctly.

I have disabled all of Defender's App integrity mechanisms but it does not help.

Any pointers??

Thanks
RemoteHooking.Inject(
                        targetPID,           // ID of process to inject into
                        injectionLibrary,   // 32-bit library to inject (if target is 32-bit)
                        injectionLibrary,   // 64-bit library to inject (if target is 64-bit)
                        channelName,
                        ... )
I'm sure the dll of injectionLibrary is exist, but it throw this exception message.

I have read [#53](https://github.com/EasyHook/EasyHook/issues/53)  [#226](https://github.com/EasyHook/EasyHook/issues/226). But still don't fix this problem.

I have download the demo of RemoteFileMonitor, this is all right. But if i use NuGet, changed EasyHook's version from 2.7.6035 to 2.7.7097. This error message show again.
I want to apply hook inside WMI IWbemClassObject::Get(...) function located in fastprox.dll in C++. How can we do it using EasyHook?
Hi! I am working on hooking some APIs from different dlls. I also read the article https://easyhook.github.io/tutorials/nativeremotehook.html but could not find my solution as this example only explains about one hook. But I need multiple hooks in different APIs. Need help.
Could you please add NuGet package for VS2019?
BTW, it seems that NuGet is deprecating by MS now, you may consider conan/vcpkg.

The first GetRemoteModuleHandle call in GetRemoteFuncAddress can return NULL in some applications started in a suspended. Call GetRemoteFuncAddress once to prevent an access violation error. Issue page: https://github.com/EasyHook/EasyHook/issues/295
When I choose `v141_xp` as the platform toolset, I couldn't compile my project (will have [unresolved EasyHook symbols](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/tool-errors/linker-tools-error-lnk2001?view=vs-2019)) because `EasyHookNativePackage.targets` does not contain anything for `v141_xp` (it only contains definitions for `v141`).

I guess this could be fixed by simply editing [EasyHookNative.autopkg](https://github.com/EasyHook/EasyHook/blob/master/EasyHookNative.autopkg)? If yes I can make a pull request.
This fixes a null pointer dereference issue when an upstream hook to GetProcAddress returns NULL.
Hello, 

I have copied a boilerplate in my project. 
Here is the code 
`#include <string>
#include <tchar.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <Windows.h>
#include <easyhook.h>

/*
#if _WIN64
#pragma comment(lib, "EasyHook64.lib")
#else
#pragma comment(lib, "EasyHook32.lib")
#endif
*/
using namespace std;

BOOL WINAPI myBeepHook(DWORD dwFreq, DWORD dwDuration);

BOOL WINAPI myBeepHook(DWORD dwFreq, DWORD dwDuration)
{
	cout << "\n****All your beeps belong to us!\n\n";
	return Beep(dwFreq + 800, dwDuration);
}

int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])
{
	HOOK_TRACE_INFO hHook = { NULL }; // keep track of our hook
	cout << "\n";
	cout << GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle(TEXT("kernel32")), "Beep");

	// Install the hook
	NTSTATUS result = LhInstallHook(
		GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle(TEXT("kernel32")), "Beep"),
		myBeepHook,
		NULL,
		&hHook);
	if (FAILED(result))
	{
		wstring s(RtlGetLastErrorString());
		wcout << "Failed to install hook: ";
		wcout << s;
		cout << "\n\nPress any key to exit.";
		cin.get();
		return -1;
	}

	cout << "Beep after hook installed but not enabled.\n";
	Beep(500, 500);

	cout << "Activating hook for current thread only.\n";
	// If the threadId in the ACL is set to 0, 
	// then internally EasyHook uses GetCurrentThreadId()
	ULONG ACLEntries[1] = { 0 };
	LhSetInclusiveACL(ACLEntries, 1, &hHook);

	cout << "Beep after hook enabled.\n";
	Beep(500, 500);

	cout << "Uninstall hook\n";
	LhUninstallHook(&hHook);

	cout << "Beep after hook uninstalled\n";
	Beep(500, 500);

	cout << "\n\nRestore ALL entry points of pending removals issued by LhUninstallHook()\n";
	LhWaitForPendingRemovals();

	cout << "Press any key to exit.";
	cin.get();

	return 0;
}
`

But when I  want to run my project I get this error 
`Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State

If I uncomment the manual installing of easyhook I get 
`Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State
Error	LNK1104	cannot open file 'EasyHook32.lib'	dll-hook-test	C:\Users\J\source\repos\dll-hook-test\dll-hook-test\LINK	1	
`

The only thing I need to do add EasyHook32 or EasyHook64 ? 
But In which directory ? 

And why does the nugget packet manager not work ? I can use the function from the lib but if I run it. It seems it doesn't regonized the lib. 


Thanks in advance
