App can't be decompiled regardless of the method used.

Any reasons for this? Any chance for more verbose error message?
Huawei P20 Pro. Android 8.1.0
After installing the ShowJava(3.0.5),I decompiled a few applications.However,when I attempt to decompile another application a few hours later,your ShowJava keeps crashing as soon as I click any item on the application selection page.It is no use robooting my device,clearing application data or deleting the output folder.Only re-install ShowJava can help.But the problem appears again after a few hours.
The problem is so weird,is it my device's fault?

The app keeps crashing after a minuite

-Moto z3
-Android ver 9
Please implement search feature for opened code files.
When I choose to decompile from and installed the only one shown is show java
I got the latest paid version 
Every so often, I get a popup asking me for random adverts, tailored adverts, or paid. I select paid and the option appears for a few seconds and just returns to the main body of the program. Thing is, I have never had any adverts on ShowJava, so I don't know what all this is about.
Not related to #158 its a seperate app.

There is so many ads in this app it is unreal and there it is clearly your app. I recognized it straight away.
