Hi,
.et has a host. You can lookup on [here](http://whois.ethiotelecom.et/). Also port's working.

Hi,

I am having trouble with timeouts when looking up some domains. I am slightly confused about what I might be doing differently/weirdly, because I would expect others to be having the same problem. Looking up using the `whois` CLI tool works fine.


Code:
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'whois'

p Whois::VERSION

whois = Whois::Client.new(:timeout => 30)
record = whois.lookup('aelius.com')
if record.nil? or record.parts.empty?
  raise "Error: unable to load whois"
end

p record
```

Result:
```
"5.0.0"

Ruby version:
```

Any advice on how to diagnose the problem further would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Our network admins want us to use "whois.iana.org" for our whois service, and that this IP address they opened in the firewall.  It would be good to have a feature to set the default address for the whois service for all queries.  Currently this can kind of be done for IPv4 with a mask of "0.0.0.0/1".
Whois::Server.define(:ipv6, 'ipv6-range', 'the-whois-server-address')

Does not work.  Setting a range did not set the address of the whois service.
`whois -h whois.radb.net -- '-i origin AS32934'`

I'm trying to get the ips of facebooks crawlers but need to pass the `-i origin` option.

Hi,

We have an internal whois server that queries a couple different sources of information.

Output takes some time, and looks like this:
```
DNS results:

xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.    company.com


Infoblox results:

XX.0.0.0/8         XX-Net
  XX.128.0.0/9       XX-Net
   XX.128.0.0/10      XX-Net

Foobar matches:

Baz matches:

Boo matches:

Feh matches:

 xxx.xxx.xxx.xx. bah bah bah
```

When I run this through whois.rb, the response goes like:

```
irb(main):003:0* client = Whois::Client.new(host: 'whois.xxx.com', timeout: 60)
=> #<Whois::Client:0x007fd7ec0188a0 @timeout=60, @settings={:host=>"whois.xxx.com"}>
irb(main):004:0> r = client.lookup('company.com')
=> "Infoblox matches:\n\n"
```

As you can see, a whole bunch of data is missing.  

Is there anything I can do here?  Thanks!
I used to be able to hook into that to do some custom stuff but it doesn't do anything anymore.

Is there any way to bring this back?
In Whois 4.0, running the following results in a failure to lookup the domain.

```
irb(main):003:0> whois = Whois::Client.new
=> #<Whois::Client:0x007f9c216d2f80 @timeout=10, @settings={}>
irb(main):004:0> whois.lookup("gov.uk")
=> "\nNo such domain gov.uk\n\n"
```

When using Whois 3.6.5, we get the following:

```
irb(main):001:0> whois = Whois::Client.new
=> #<Whois::Client:0x007fa24e2c2340 @timeout=10, @settings={}>

```

If I query a zones in, say, chirurgiens-dentistes.fr, it goes to the right whois server:

```
# whoisrb dr-longuet-tuet-anne.chirurgiens-dentistes.fr
--- #YAML:1.0
# Welcome to the SMALLREGISTRY WHOIS  Server. Datas are available  in  order to
...
```

But if I query for chirurgiens-dentistes.fr itself, it does not, it should be querying the .fr whois, and not the smallregistry one:

```
# whoisrb chirurgiens-dentistes.fr
--- #YAML:1.0
# Welcome to the SMALLREGISTRY WHOIS  Server. Datas are available  in  order to
...
```

``` shell
whois -h whois.nic.io -p 44 [name.tm]
```
