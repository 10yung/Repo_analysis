the default vlue of textContainerInset  is (8, 0, 8, 0)
For example:

``` 
    UIEdgeInsets edgeInsets = _textView.internalTextView.textContainerInset;
    edgeInsets.left = 8;
    edgeInsets.right = 8;
    _textView.internalTextView.textContainerInset = edgeInsets;
```

hi,I am using HPGrwingTextView now.But I found out it seems impossible to rewrite paste to get something useful in UIPasteboard area.I am confused,please help me ,thanks.
Adds a framework target to the test project which allows carthage to build this as a dependency, also fixed deprecation warning for `drawInRect:withFont:`
There is need in my project that i have to made the textview smaller, I tried following but not getting success.

UITextView *textView = [[HPGrowingTextView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(15,4, 230,25)];

Add a property 'editable' function to cahnge textview editable property. Or expose the internal  textview to application to modify all attributes.

remove deprecate iOS 7
user drawInRect with Attribute

hi , your code in the Method `- (void)refreshHeight`,has  a problem. The result of `measureHeight` is a float value,should not assign to the local var  `newSizeH` which type  is  NSInteger.  It may leads to the result smaller than the textview needs.      you can fix it by  `NSInteger newSizeH = ceilf([self measureHeight]);`
