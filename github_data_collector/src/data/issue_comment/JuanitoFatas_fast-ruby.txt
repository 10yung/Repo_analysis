Would it be possible to gemify fast-ruby and also add contributors?

The idea would be to have a gem that just focuses on "fast ruby" in general, also on rubygems.org, not just on github alone. Not sure if this is wanted but I'll just add this issue here, feel free to proceed how you wish to past this point. :)



I believe some examples could be non relative anymore with the latest Ruby version. We should rerun all examples and update the results
#169 
I noticed that many examples in `code/` do not match the template.
```ruby
require "benchmark/ips"

def fast
end

def slow
end

Benchmark.ips do |x|
  x.report("fast code description") { fast }
  x.report("slow code description") { slow }
  x.compare!
end
```

- removes `gem update --system`, cause it is now fixed on travis side
As discussed [#165](https://github.com/JuanitoFatas/fast-ruby/issues/165)
