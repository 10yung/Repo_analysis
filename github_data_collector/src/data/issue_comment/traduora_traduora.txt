**Describe the bug**

If you import a set of strings from a po file, traduora will ignore strings that have `msgctxt`. In this example only the first translation will be imported, and all the month names translations will be ignored.

```
# strings-es.po

msgid "Search"
msgstr "Buscar"

msgctxt "month name"
msgid "January"
msgstr "Enero"

msgctxt "month name"
msgid "February"
msgstr "Febrero"

msgctxt "month name"
msgid "March"
msgstr "Marzo"

msgctxt "month name"
msgid "April"
msgstr "Abril"
```


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to import
1. Import a po file that uses `msgctxt`
1. Only 1 from 5 string is imported

**Expected behavior**

I would expect to see all the strings, even if `msgctxt` is not supported by this system, the original string should be available for transaltion.

I try it in my PC but I cant chage the   System language. I want to know is it already existsï¼ŸTHX for your JOB.
`fa` is default country is `IR`
There is no need for add `fa_IR` separately.

As we work towards a 1.0 version, it would be great to collect a list of adopters to help us spread the word.

Feel free to mention your company or project as a comment and I'll add you to the adopters list, or you could also submit a PR to the readme :)

[Application Resource Bundle (abbr. ARB)](https://github.com/google/app-resource-bundle)  is a localization resource format that is simple (based on JSON)

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I am currently trying to translate a application. There are tons of larger term e.g. email templates or pdf  templates which have to be translated.
At the moment I cant import them into traduora as the terms are to long for the DB field.
From what I found out is that the value field in the terms table cant grow in size because of the index which is required for the unique.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Maybe a hash can be generated from the term value which is then used for the unique. With this solution we might be able to have larger terms. 
Closes #82 

I chose the format used by the Laravel framework as base. This should be easy enough to include in different frameworks/projects as required.
Currently only view over translations is possible - i.e. i can select only a locale and view / change all terms in the selected language.

It would be useful to be able to select a term and show / change all its translations at once (i.e. to be able to change all language variants of selected key on a single page)

Also it would be useful to be able to add new key on such page - it will be add  to all languages and default values (or no values) will be shown.

I see from the formats.md file that PHP strings is on the roadmap. I don't suppose you could give us a general estimate on when that will be worked on? e.g. "we're no longer prioritizing this" vs "sometime in 2020"

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When exporting the translation files in traduora, they are currently exported as e.g. de_DE.strings. It would be great if it would be possible to change the default name so that the exported files can directly replace e.g. the files inside the xCode project. It would also be nice to get all files for each language at once in a zip file.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
In Project settings, add the possibility to change the export filename format. For a xCode Swift project the expected structure is:

- de.lproj/Localizable.strings
- de.lproj/Main.strings
- fr.lproj/Localizable.strings
- fr.lproj/Main.strings

So also a re-mapping from "de_DE" to "de" as prefix would need to be possible.
