apple changed the sdk location a long time ago to something like

/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.12.sdk

the file has

/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk

usually you find the location by running this in bash

xcrun -sdk macosx --show-sdk-path
