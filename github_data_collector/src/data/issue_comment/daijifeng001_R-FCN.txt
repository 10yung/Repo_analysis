Are the provided pretrained models fine-tune on VOC dataset or they are just pretrained on Imagenet?
e.g. I am talking about "ImageNet-pretrained networks: "
after a 1*1 conv, why **the feature map can represent different location information**? why would **these features map have such physical meaning**?
This paper did not mention the content

I really appreciate your assistance
I can`t understand about PS-ROI-Pooling.
In paper figure 3,4, why there is all different 9 score maps ?

i hope to get the cpu version because my pc has no GPU. If it run on CPU, how much is the fps? hope to get your reply as soon!!
Hello, I want to train R-FCN with matlab in this windows version. But I only find the last step code in 4-steps training method and no end-to-end code. And I want to train on my own dataset. So I want to know are there RPN code and prototxt I can use to run my experiments up. Please help me.  
How to understand the position-sensitive score map? What's the meaning of the translation-invariance in the classification stage and the translation-variance in the object detection stage? How to show it in the object detection detection framework in R-FCN? Thank you very much! 
Hi, thanks for your sharing spirit. Do you have merged OHEM into Faster RCNN for the official MATLAB version? Could you teach me how to modify the codes?
When running rfcn_build.m，it reports 
“
Compiling nms_mex
使用 'MinGW64 Compiler (C++)' 编译。
错误使用 mex
g++: error: \-fexceptions: No such file or directory
”
matlab version is 2017a    MinGW64 is 4.9.2   
I use the model to train my own dataset consisting of 2 classes(manhole cover and bg). When I use the original imagenet resnet50 model to initialize, it can't detect anything. However, When I use the rfcn model,  it can detect what I want, but also it's very responsive to the objects the original rfcn model can detect(car, person, dog and etc.) What I plan to do is to use some images in pascal voc dataset as background to train the model. Do you have any suggestions?

Here are some parameters I use in training:
iter: 50000
lr: 0.00001(increasing it will result in nan loss)
number of images: 300-400

Hi ! @daijifeng001  Thank you for sharing this project for us! Now, I'd like to try training the model on my own dataset, and I notice there is a mean_image file. How to get that file if I want to train my own dataset, and your train process seems to use both voc2007 and voc2012, if I want to use only one dataset, which parts of code should I modify? Thank you!
