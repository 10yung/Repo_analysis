When using `ObjectiveRecord` as a dynamic framework, `NSBundle.bundleForClass(self)` returns the framework's bundle which then, in turn, won't yield the correct CoreData model file. By overriding the bundle when using `CoreDataManager` this can be fixed.

**\* Skipped building ObjectiveRecord due to the error:
Dependency "ObjectiveRecord" has no shared framework schemes

Help...


More like a convinience not to specify "InContext" when calling:

```
- .all
- .find
- .where)
```

The `create()` call fails because, in `createInContext:` the call to `[self entityName]` returns `'ModuleName.Classname"` instead of just `"Classname"` as it did in Obj-c. The format of the return type of `NSStringFromClass` changed in the latest Swift release.

Hi guys,

First I want to say that I admire what you've done on Kiwi library its very helpful for testing. Thank you.

I've been trying to run the latest code on Xcode Version 6.3 (6D520o) but I've been getting issues with the description field and even when I applied the fix from #542 it still would complain about too many argument for objc_msgSend having too many arguments (which is ridiculous on its own level since it supposed to expect a variadic parameter at the end...).
But what surprised me more is that the build system showing passing when the same error is happening on the CI.

I'm not sure if you have already attended to the problem Just wanted to give you a heads up.

Thanks

I want to use iCloud functionality but I'm not sure how to go about adding this key to the options dictionary of the NSPersistantStore. 

Anyone using ObjectiveRecord and iCloud?

"Accessor methods of synthesized property 'managedObjectModel' (etc) were overridden" 

Adding a readwrite property in a private category fixes this warning

I've been using your library for quite some time now and love it. Also fully made the transition to Swift.
Can you tell me if and when there will be a Swift version coming out? I'd love use it! If you need testers for this let me know!

Cheers, 
Sidney

Hello,

is this project still alive? And what is about version 2.0?

Thanks,
