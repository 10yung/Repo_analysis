Following this [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/9336774/931340) browsers don't persist shared workers when navigating to a new page or refreshing(apparently an undefined behavior in the spec?) which is a shame because many would benefit from that feature, specially relevant for people trying to persist a costly websocket or webRTC data channel. I think it's something that should be solved for the normal navigation but since it looks unlikely to be solved what about shared worker persistence when navigating using portals? Seems like an undefined behavior again as It's not mentioned in the draft, it probably isn't hard to implement as the new page is created while the previous one is around, right? it might even work already?

Portals are a nice gimmick but not life changing, want to add a killer feature that alone can convince people to use them? Consider persistence of shared workers! :smiley:
In the latest chrome canary, whenever portal is activated, the change gets pushed into the history stack so user can use the browser back button to navigate back to the previous page. This is super nice.

But I am having trouble detecting the history change. Under Site A, I activated a portal pointing to Site B (url changed to Site B) and i pressed browser back button (it navigates back to Site A). Under Site B, i have window.onpopstate attached to an event handler but it is not triggered when browser back button is clicked. I am trying to activate the Site A portal under Site B under the onpopstate handler.
After I create a portal with Site B in Site A, i would like to detect whether the portal content is loaded. Is there a way to achieve this?

I initially thought it could be achieved using messaging, but it seems only Site A can message the portal (Site B) and not vice versa.
Using portals with external website (for test purpose) I got stack in the successor page because (obviously) there was no `portalactivate` event listeners.

May we be able to make a custom `portalactivate` handler that can control how we want to interact with the successor page? Or will a default action for this event be supplied?

If not, can an HTML property be specified to make sure that the user can navigate back to the predecessor page using the history controls?
I can imagine a future where a site is expecting a data in `PortalActivateEvent` from trusted site. 
But `PortalActivateEvent` can be triggered by any site (similar to `message` event), therefore origin attribute has to be exposed in `PortalActivateEvent`. Otherwise it'll be an XSS nightmare ðŸ˜Š
It is failed to node-gyp build on Node v12.

The `gulp@4.0.1` depends on `fsevents@^1.2.7` through `glob-watcher@5.0.3`, `chokidar@2.1.5`.
`portal-embed-demo` depends on `fsevents@1.2.8` in `package-lock.json` (https://github.com/ka2jun8/portals/blob/master/demos/portal-embed-demo/package-lock.json#L1573-L1574).
This fsevents version 1.2.8 is reported that it is failed to build on node v12 (https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/27389, https://github.com/fsevents/fsevents/issues/278).

I think that it needs to update fsevents@1.2.9.

But, glob-watcher issue say that it cannot update chokidar v3 (https://github.com/gulpjs/glob-watcher/issues/49). So it cannot update fsevents@1.2.9 through gulp structurally.

By the way, in my local Macbook pro, I changed gulp in package.json to `"gulp": "^4.0.2",` and I tried re-installing npm modules.  
The `chokidar@v2.1.8` is installed implicitly, and I succeeded to install `fsevents@1.2.9` and to build it.
But I do not know it is collect way, because I did not tried it in Windows.

I will show this issue following the failing logs of my npm install and npm ls.

Hello, I am trying to use portal element with [electronjs](https://electronjs.org/) framework. But I face a problem with loading local files into portal element.

`Portals only allow navigation to protocols in the HTTP family.`

Is it possible to load local html files into portal element? If not, what are the reasons?
At the [TPAC breakout session](https://www.w3.org/2019/09/18-portals-minutes.html), it was proposed that to mitigate author abuse, UAs could impose limits of the creation of portals, and reflect this through an error or by rendering fallback children.

(Minutes + my memory suggests it was Matt Woodrow, AdrianHB and Peter Linss who suggested this.)
Should it be possible to handle a response [as a download](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#as-a-download)? This might permit drive-by downloads, or at a minimum, user annoyance.

There might be legitimate reasons to want to allow this, but I'm not currently aware of them. Related to #145 which also involves hooks into navigate.
Based on feedback from @annevk.

In order handle decisions such as XFO/CSP decisions that should depend on it.
