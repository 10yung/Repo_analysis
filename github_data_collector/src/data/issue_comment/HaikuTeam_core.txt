Hi Haiku,

I'm using Haiku for Mac, and would like to know if custom style css could be added to elements, just like cursor, z-index, and so on. One example would be "fill" attribute for svgs. Example: angry state could result in my character being red instead of black. I tried to manually add it into code.js, but it didn't change anything.

Thank you!
Thanks for such a nice concept. 

The problem is all changes get auto-saved by clicking Back Arrow ( Next to Haiku Logo )

It would be great if you Haiku UI can provide git versions to revert back/ or Alert user should change be auto saved.

Currently, the only workaround is Developer > Open in Terminal > $git reset --hard HEAD~1
Thanks for such a nice concept. It would be great if you Haiku can retain the position of sketch elements.

Currently, the only workaround is copy pasting  Sketch - Position > X to Haiku - Position X which is not effective for multiple Slices


Hi,

Just tried the app and can't make it work with some SVG files.

## Description of the bug

Tried to scale an imported SVG file through the main view but it keep throwing me errors.
Everytime I try to close the errors, a new one comes.
Also, while I'm getting those errors, I can't do anything on the rest of the app except closing the errors.

## How to reproduce

I drag-dropped this simple SVG file in the Haiku view:
```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1" viewBox="0 0 268.5 319.2">
  <path fill="#92c9ed" d="M134.256 242.731c-58.7 0-106.3-47.6-106.3-106.3 0-58.7 47.6-106.3 106.3-106.3s106.3 47.6 106.3 106.3c0 58.7-47.6 106.3-106.3 106.3m134.3-108.5c0-74.2-60.1-134.3-134.3-134.3-74.2 0-134.3 60.1-134.3 134.3 0 59.1 38.2 109.4 91.4 127.3l42.9 57.7 42.9-57.7h-.1c53.2-17.9 91.5-68.1 91.5-127.3"/>
</svg>
```

Throw these errors:
