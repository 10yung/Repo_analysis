Title says it all. What can cause it?

https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi/Blockchain/BlockFilters/IndexBuilderService.cs

Dark mode looks sketchy.

I could create links that launch different wallets.json instead of closing and reopening Wasabi and having to click an extra step to select the wallet to load.
### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Right now anyone with access to a machine running wasabi can open the app and see full tx history.
They can't spend the coins but they can see addresses and so on.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Would be nice if there was an option to encrypt the wallet so it won't open without entering the password. 

Alternatively an option to open the app in snooping wife mode and require a password to switch to regular view



### Problem

Currently, I can only use the daemon with the `mix` functionality, I cannot simply run the daemon without mixing. 

### Solution

Add an option to the daemon that only runs wasabi [downloads filters and blocks etc]. This is especially useful for rpc commands, where I run the daemon without mixing, and then do RPC commands for the specific actions.
