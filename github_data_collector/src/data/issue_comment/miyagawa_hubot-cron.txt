Create new event-emitting jobs by using hubot nevent job instead of hubot add job. Additionally fixes an issue with list jobs command where it would occasionally return @undefined for the room portion
I'm using hubot-cron with redis-cache as brain.

After a restart, the job is non-functional: list jobs shows the following:

530784:  05 10 \* \* 1-5  **@undefined** "message"

Add functionality to send commands back into hubot.

```
miyagawa> hubot new job 0 9 * * 1-5 exec hubot ping
hubot> Job 45678 created

...

hubot> PONG
```

I'm not 100% sure about the command syntax, but it seems workable to me.

I've only tested this in the `Shell` adapter so far.

Resolves #12 

Not sure what the problem could be, but I just added the script to our Slackbot, and it adds jobs but never executes on the reminders (even after changing time zones, etc.). Is this script still working?

The user.reply_to id seems to be different everytime hubot is restarted, therefore not a safe option (everytime I restarted hubot, listing jobs wouldn't return any result).
I use the job.user.room by default instead.

Also added a method "list all" to list all jobs recorded in the job brain, regardless of the channel"

Great documentation on getting the ability to set up a cronjob in hubot. Is it possible to setup a cronjob to hubot perform a function?

Usually hubot listens for a user command to respond with some text. Can this cronjob output the same text (trying to eliminate the user input to make hubot respond).

Our group chat does not require authentication, so the bot connects over XMPP HOST:PORT. If I create a cron in the group chat, right at the time when the cron should run, the bot restarts itself. 

It works if I open a private chat with the bot. 

Please let me know if you need any further information.
