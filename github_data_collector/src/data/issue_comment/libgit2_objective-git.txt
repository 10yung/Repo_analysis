Thanks so much for this project! I hope this is a trivial thing to answer - any help would be super appreciated.

How do I build ObjetiveGit.framework with all dependencies included (equivalent to Carthage/Build/Mac/ObjectiveGit.framework)?

I have a fork with changes to run on macOS Cataline/Xcode 11, and have tried everything I can think of:

- `carthage build`
- `script/cibuild`
- Xcode archive

and more.

Anyone know what to run and where to look for the output?

Thanks!
I tried to objective-git in a react-native project, but had issues importing the module in swift.

I have made these changes to the modulemap and the project settings to make it work.
Hi, I would love help getting ObjectiveGit running on macOS.

I'm on Catalina 10.15.1 and Xcode Version 11.1.

I'm building using Carthage, following all the steps.
iOS seems to work fine.
MacOS does not:

```
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/.../Build/Products/Debug/.../Contents/Frameworks/ObjectiveGit.framework/Versions/A/ObjectiveGit
  Reason: image not found
```

Looking in `/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/` I see `libcrypto.1.1.dylib`, but not `libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib`.

(If relevant at all, I was able to get https://www.github.com/SwiftGit2/SwiftGit2 to run on macOS)

Any pointers would be super, super appreciated!

Thanks
No code changes were needed.
I've tried adding the files that Xcode complains about to ObjectiveGit.modulemap, as in #679, but it doesn't seem to make any difference.

The latest release is eight months before on Oct 2018. Any plan on a new release since libgit2, libssh2, openssl have been updated.

Should be caused by:

When the system calls `-[GTRepository dealloc]` and the git_repository is empty, but still exists, the app crashes.

Here is a screenshot  of the debug session:

To fix this, the function is simply checking if the `workdir` property of the `git_repository` object isn't empty before cleaning the repo.

This PR fixes #689

What I would suggest is to change: https://github.com/libgit2/objective-git/blob/b3af3f3c7a1871ba5c153f601f9a643483a665c9/ObjectiveGit/GTRepository.m#L110-L115

By simply checking if the `workdir` property of the `git_repository` object isn't empty before cleaning the repo.

I'm not an Objective-C developer, so I let you guys do that for me (or just show me how to do it, and I'll submit a PR)
Since libssh2 was just updated, let's also update all our others dependencies.
