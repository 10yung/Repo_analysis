In the demo app, the nodes are added when you add todo items, but not removed when you remove the items. Seems like the events aren't cleaned up.

A minor thing ;-) The link latentflip.github.com/violin is redirecting to latentflip.com/violin/ url instead of latentflip.com/hacks/violin/

Maybe http://esprima.org/demo/functiontrace.html can help you inject some analysis functions. Just a wild idea. Enjoy!
