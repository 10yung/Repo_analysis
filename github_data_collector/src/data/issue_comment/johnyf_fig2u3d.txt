Dear all
I got stuck in the last step: write u3d file.  I am using Matlab 2018a, The following are the massage:

./IDTFConverter.sh -input "/home/siwei/Documents/MATLAB/fluxes/myfig.idtf" -output "/home/siwei/Documents/MATLAB/fluxes/myfig.u3d"
Exit code = 80000003

Error using idtf2u3d (line 111)
IDTFConverter executable returned with error.

Error in fig2u3d (line 238)
idtf2u3d(fname)

Error in fig2latex (line 48)
    fig2u3d(ax, fname)

Error in fig2pdf3d (line 63)
fig2latex(ax, filename, media9_or_movie15, pdforxelatex);

Any solutions? Thanks in advance!

Hi,

Thank you very much for this package but I had some problems to make it work on Matlab R2017b.

I run the script 'examples.m' and it works fine with fig2u3d but not with fig2pdf3d.

I had the following error: ! LaTeX3 Error: The key 'media9/views/\par' is unknown and is being ignored.
[peaks_contour.log](https://github.com/johnyf/fig2u3d/files/2689910/peaks_contour.log)

Could you help me to resolve this issue ?

Fix surfaces with single color for all faces/vertices that still have indexed color CData set which however is not used by Matlab due to specified single
solid color. (Example: create streamtube, set FaceColor for streamtube object,
Matlab plots streamtube (correctly) in the set color but fig2idtf still
generates an index color stream tube cycling through the complete
colormap without this fix)
Make a call like fig2pdf3d(gca, ‘/foo/bar/filename’) work too (crashed
before)
Add support for hggoups. The code until now assumed that the parent of a graphics handle is an axes object. This is not true for more complex graphics object hierarchies (e.g. involving groups of handles by hggroups). Thus traverse the graphics tree upwards in case the parent is not an axes until the axes is finally found.
Matlab handle graphics 2 support (tested with 2016b)
Thank you very much for this wonderful package that allows me to insert interactive 3d plots in my presentations!!!

Nevertheless, I had a lot of problems to make it work in Matlab R2015a, and my success is only partial...

First, I had a problem with the file `mesh_normals.m` in `fig2idtf/auxiliary`. It seems that this script does not produce / generate the correct normals for mesh surfaces. So, it generates an error when 'normals' is empty: when it tries to normalize the normal vectors, it complains about the operation `./` between empty matrices.  I've included a check for this condition that returns an empty 'normals' without normalization. 

And I had to manually comment some lines in other scripts that check the condition `isnan()` for various handles (two places): `fig2idtf/preprocess/u3d_pre_contourgroup.m` and `fig2idtf/preprocess/u3d_pre_quivergroup.m`

With these corrections, `fig2u3d` is able to generate the idtf file, but then the system explodes when it calls to `IDTFConverter`. I had the same error 81110005 that was previously commented in another message.

If I edit manually the IDTF file and remove from the `MESH` resource everything related to `NORMALS` 
(I set `MODEL_NORMAL_COUNT` to 0, and remove `MESH_FACE_NORMAL_LIST` and `MODEL_NORMAL_LIST`) I can run the `IDTFConverter` without any flaw and the u3d file works great in latex and PDF.

I guess that the problem comes from the file `mesh_normals`, but I cannot find useful information about this function. 

Any comment that can help me to correct this issue will be welcome.

Due to the changed graphics API fig2u3d is not working with Matlab R2016b. Please update this great product!

Hi,
thanks for this, works very fine!

I just have problems with lines containing NaNs:
`plot( 1:5, [1 2 NaN 4 5] )`
`fig2u3d( gca, 'test' );`

Throws:
`Profile = 0`
`Scaling factor = 1.000000`
`Debug level = 0`
`Position Quality = 1000`
`Texture Coordinate Quality = 1000`
`Normal Quality = 1000`
`Diffuse Color Quality = 1000`
`Specular Color  Quality = 1000`
`Geometry Default Quality = 1000`
`Texture Quality = 100`
`Animation Quality = 1000`
`Zero Area Faces Removal = ENABLED`
`Zero Area Face Tolerance = 0.000012`
`Exclude Normals = FALSE`
`Export Option Flags = ffff`
`Texture size limit = 0`
`Exit code = 81110005`

Grabbing through some code, least exit code means "IFX_E_FLOAT_NOT_FOUND" (ConverterResult.h) in component 0x0111 which is "IFXRESULT_CONVERTERS" (IFXResultComponentEngine.). That error is ommitted in FileScanner.cpp only (IFXRESULT FileScanner::ScanFloat( F32\* pNumber ) ).

I rebuilt IDTFConver (Version u3d-1.4.3) from scratch, but the same failure occures, so I guess the idtf input file, created from MATLAB scripts, is malformed.

Do you have any ideas?

Kindly regards,
Andreas
