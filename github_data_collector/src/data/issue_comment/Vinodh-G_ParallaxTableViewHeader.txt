How can i Edit Header View to use multi image with paging enable & Parallex together?
can it be sticky?

The swift sample code does not setup the view properly. It should be using the width not the height of the tableview.
let headerView: ParallaxHeaderView = ParallaxHeaderView.parallaxHeaderViewWithImage(UIImage(named: "YourImageName"), forSize: CGSizeMake(**self.tableview.frame.size.width,** 300)) as ParallaxHeaderView

Hey Vinodh,
i have ported your code to Swift for using inside my new app and thought you may would be interested to add it to your repo. The example app is not as nice as yours, because i reduced the styling of the table view cells, but i think that's not the focus.

Hi, nice plugin.
I have one issue. I have navigation controller. My root view controller is FirstView and SecondView contains tableview with parallaxTableViewHeader. Now when i push from FirstView to SecondView it will take time to push to SecondView. (parallaxtableviewheader setup takes time to load the second view)
Can anyone give the suggestion to resolve this issue.

Thanks.

I tried adding gestureRecognizer directly to headerView but not working, so I also tried:

` let headerImageView = UIImageView(frame: CGRectMake(0, 0, UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds.width, UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds.width*0.667))

```
    headerImageView.image = headerImage

    headerImageView.userInteractionEnabled = true

    let tap = UIGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: "showOrgIntroView")

    headerImageView.addGestureRecognizer(tap)

    let headerView = ParallaxHeaderView.parallaxHeaderViewWithSubView(headerImageView) as! ParallaxHeaderView

    self.tableView.tableHeaderView = headerView`
```

But it still doesn't work either.

Is it compatible with swift 2?

I am trying to implement this with Xcode7 and swift 2.

will it be possible to do from storyboard?

is there any example for it?

Thanks in advance.. :)

Hey,

What a brilliant parallax effect! Excellent job. I was only wondering if there was a way to fix this error:

What it is:
<img width="376" alt="screen shot 2015-10-18 at 09 44 22" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10178361/10563300/e59793c0-757c-11e5-9d5b-6cdd7ca9a62a.png">

What it should be:
<img width="377" alt="screen shot 2015-10-18 at 09 44 33" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10178361/10563301/f438b698-757c-11e5-9118-c06f8461790c.png">

This occurs in the following circumstances:
1. Scroll up to cover the header and reveal bottom cells
2. Scroll very vigorously in one movement down again to reveal the header
3. No side expansion with bounce or anything happens, it just increases in height and stays blurred.

A thing I have noticed is that the less the kParallaxDeltaFactor, the less the bug. I have it set a 1.0f. (The nav bar has nothing to do with it).

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hi,

thanks for the great parallax effect, however I am having issues with it. Namely the image and label appear too far to the right until I scroll, when they are replaced correcly.

Also, the blur turns the image completely dark rather than simply blurring it.

I am using xcode 7 and swift 2.0
