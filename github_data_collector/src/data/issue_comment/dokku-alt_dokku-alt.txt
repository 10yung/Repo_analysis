Is it possible to use Apache2 instead of Nginx, or is that a no-no? :octocat:
How do you go about the reverse process of installing dokku-alt?

I installed it to a container that has files I want to keep, so I can't just delete the container. :octocat: 
I found #137.

But I container initialization is failing in different packages:

``` shell
Package libapache2-mod-php5 is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source

Package php5-mysql is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source

Package php5-gd is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source

Package php-apc is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source

```

Here is the entire [output](https://gist.github.com/juanpastas/c2ecd5ac50b52ec84ba251f2a32776e6).

It seems that I need to do `sudo apt-get install build-essential` inside the container.

See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/q/13835950/1197775).

Console says it is using buildpack ayufan/dokku-alt-buildstep:cedar-14.

How would I do that? I suppose the right way is to configure the buildpack. Any advice?

``` shell
       Installing equalizer 0.0.10

I have my own ubuntu 14.04 VPS but how can i make the dokku-alt service run in the background and on restarts.. ?

for example, i use wordpress & mysql docker image to create wordpress site, how i can modify dokku source code that allow to create app from my exist image on my vps. SO, i will create new plugin:
`dokku mywp:create site1 --admin_pass=12345`
`dokku mywp:create site2`

if possible, please guide me as detail, thank in advanced.

I've been trying to set my Python app up with dokku.

```
root@dokku:/home/relta# dokku version
0.3.10-7-gf34bb41
```

Running on Ubuntu 16.04. I set the `runtime.txt` to `python-3.5.1`.

```
-----> Python app detected
remote: /tmp/buildpacks/custom/bin/steps/python: line 49: pip: command not found
-----> Noticed pylibmc. Bootstrapping libmemcached.
       $ pip install -r requirements.txt
       /tmp/buildpacks/custom/bin/steps/pip-install: line 8: /app/.heroku/python/bin/pip: No such file or directory
```

Might this be an issue for Heroku?

Fix #305 
Change dokku-alt packaging in Docker to use docker-engine instead of lxc-docker.
Change docker version to integrate new docker version 1.10.0.

Taken from https://github.com/dokku/dokku/commit/3e100e30023922ce23d8023128887720ca01adce and confirmed to fix the issue for my setup, as well as mentioned in https://github.com/dokku-alt/dokku-alt/issues/277
