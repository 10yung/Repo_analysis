Updated project for Swift 5
Hi, your code is clean and awesome and I really appreciate you making it open source.
I think supporting Swift 4.2 would make this code more readable and valuable. Thus, this PR.
I really like this library. Now i am facing issue which when i tapped on button then image that i set has been disappeared but when my finger has released then image appears as usual. 
Can you solve this problem?

`button.rippleColor = UIColor.red`
`button.backgroundColor = UIColor.red`
`button.setTitle("File Server", for: .normal)`
`button.setImage(UIImage(named: "filesharing"), for: .normal)`
`button.titleLabel?.font = UIFont(name: "SFCompactText-Regular", size: 16)`
`button.titleEdgeInsets = UIEdgeInsets(top: 0, left: 10, bottom: 0, right: 0)`

Allow public access to ripple views in case user implementations need to add even more subviews, which should be inserted beneath those added by ZFRippleButton.

Hi there,

I've gotten two errors below after updating to Xcode 8.2.1:

> Main.storyboard: error: IB Designables: Failed to render and update auto layout status for ViewController (BYZ-38-t0r): dlopen(ZFRippleButton.framework, 1): no suitable image found.  Did find:
> 	ZFRippleButton.framework: required code signature missing for 'ZFRippleButton.framework'

Not sure but maybe it's not related to new update of Xcode.

Thank you,
Serhiy


I am using this repository in more then one project and i found this little unexpected behavior which is fixed by writing those lines in the class file. I want this to be on the main repo. Please review and merge if found appropriate. Thank you.
Is it possible to add a shadow to the button? I dont mean shadow on click, I always want the shadow to stay visible

when setting an image the rippleBackgroundColor is drawn above the image and the rippleColor above the rippleBackgroundColor
I had to set rippleBackgroundColor to clear (remains the backgroundcolor) and the rippleColor with an alpha component < 1

```
        buttonSelect.backgroundColor = UIColor.redColor
        buttonSelect.rippleBackgroundColor = UIColor.clearColor() //or color with low alpha
        buttonSelect.rippleColor = redColor().lightenColor().colorWithAlphaComponent(0.5)


        buttonSelect.tintColor = white
        buttonSelect.setImage(UIImage(named: "image")?.imageWithRenderingMode(UIImageRenderingMode.AlwaysTemplate), forState: UIControlState.Normal)

//        buttonSelect.setImage(UIImage(named: "image")?.imageWithRenderingMode(UIImageRenderingMode.AlwaysTemplate), forState: UIControlState.Highlighted)
//        buttonSelect.setImage(UIImage(named: "image")?.imageWithRenderingMode(UIImageRenderingMode.AlwaysTemplate), forState: UIControlState.Selected)

        buttonSelect.imageView?.contentMode = UIViewContentMode.ScaleAspectFit
```

states Highlighted and Selected do not give visible influences
