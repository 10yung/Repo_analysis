I thought I'd be nice to upgrade to the latest upstream shower, which offers some interesting new features.
Also makes it easier for users if the upstream docs are in sync with this package.

This is still work in progress and I might have broken things.
I'll use this in my own work and try to test / fix all the features.
Thought I'd raise this PR already to let people know that this is being worked on.

Will update this conversation once I think it's ready for review.

I'm only using the built-in theme and this probably breaks compatibility with the custom themes.

## TODOS

- [x] pass on progress bar arg
- [x] pass on aspect ratio
- [x] pass on color_key
- [x] fix code highlighting
- [x] fix shout color
- [x] fix multiple heading per slide
- [ ] (maybe?) compatibility with theme pkgs (such as earl, mango, etc.)
- [ ] set up automatic CI for skeleton
- [ ] enable remaining pandoc features
- [ ] maybe source out the pandoc template to a separate repo
- [ ] enable skeleton for RStudio again (deleted because of code duplication; example currently just lives in, well, example)

A change in Pandoc 2.0.1 broke title slide translation: https://pandoc.org/releases.html
Hi there!

After upgrading R to ver. 3.5.0 and, consequently, the packages `rmarkdown` and `rmdshower`, I cannot render my own presentations created a few weeks ago. I get the following issue. The code in my source file:

`![title](img/fig_3.png)`

is rendered:

`<p><img data-src="img/fig_5.png" alt="title"/></p>`

rather than

`<p><img src="img/fig_5.png" alt="title"/></p>`

The issue affects the following setup:

* macOS High Sierra 10.13.4
* R version 3.5.0
* rmarkdown_1.9

And it works flawlessly on a Linux machine, regardless of the upgrades:

* Debian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)
* R version 3.3.3
* rmarkdown_1.9


Here's the output block in my yaml header:

```yaml
output: 
  rmdshower::shower_presentation:
    self_contained: true
    theme: "material"
    incremental: true
    katex: true
    ratio: "4x3"
```

This returns the following error when knitting:

```
pandoc.exe: Could not fetch slides_files/rmdshower/package/styles/screen-4x3.css
slides_files/rmdshower/package/styles/screen-4x3.css: openBinaryFile: does not exist (No such file or directory)

Hi, great work on this rmarkdown shower template!

Does the title slide of this rmarkdown version (https://mangothecat.github.io/rmdshower/skeleton.html) deliberately deviate from the original shower framework (https://shwr.me/#cover)? I particularly like the latter, is it possible to recreate it in the rmarkdown version? 
I see that if I change the `fill` attribute of the `path` tag in `rmdshower/node_modules/shower-ribbon/images/ribbon.svg` I can change the ribbon color. But is there a way that I can pass that attribute through the `.Rmd` file? Could a `ribbon-color` argument be added to `shower_presentation()`? Or is there a way to do this with CSS?
In getting rmdshower to work with [**ari**](https://github.com/seankross/ari), I came across two small tweaks to options that I think would be useful:

1.  **numbered anchors**: Currently slides have title-based anchors (`slides.html#introduction`).  I think numbered anchors are better for slideshows (`slides.html#1`), and for **ari** they are required to advance the slides.  This can be changed by removing the `auto_identifiers` option from pandoc markdown. I would just make this default behavior.

2. **base presentation view**:  shower slides control whether default view is the overview of slides or the first slide by switching between `<body class="shower list">` and `<body class="shower full">`.  I would add an option to `shower_presentation()`, `base_view`, with `"list"` as default but also taking `"full"`.  **ari** also needs full view.

Happy to do a PR with these if you agree and are still maintaining the package.
This is a placeholder to remind me to tell @dougmet that we need to rerelease `rmdshower` on CRAN otherwise it doesn't work with the new `rmdshower.mango` theme - the CRAN release still uses the old theme.
