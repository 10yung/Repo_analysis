In the website of the project, when you try to see the examples of html version, a message appears: "This page has been blocked by Kerio Control". It seems an issue with firewall is messing with an ajax request.
Thank you for contributing to this excellent project.
I think there should be a key like `href` in papers/publications section to add href attribute to paper title. For example,
```json
"papers": {
	   "items": [
	   		{
			"authors":"imtypist",
			"title":"This is a title",
                        "href":"http://xxx.com",  // add the key 'href'
			"misc":"Journal of Computer Applications, August 2017"
			}
		   ]
	}
```
Or you can delete the mark `<a>` outside title in HTML template, then we can use markdown-style to add a link to paper title. For example,
```json
"papers": {
	   "items": [
	   		{
			"authors":"imtypist",
			"title":"[This is a title](http://xx.com)", // use markdown-style
			"misc":"Journal of Computer Applications, August 2017"
			}
		   ]
	}
```
I think the latter may be easier to modify.
Thanks for your OSS.

I wish to create a project for our own CV, so could I use some of the files (like the template) without the whole project (since we will do another design) ?
Question about format of json file, is https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema used?
Nice project, I'm very gratefull ;)

I'm writting my `cv` now, but all the time when I save a file I need to go my terminal and type `json_resume` again. If it had a way to make rebuild every time I change a file.

Can be like `json_resume convert file.json --watch`

What you think about it?

It would be great to have support for `minor` in the `bio_data.education.schools` sections.

And maybe it would be useful to support arrays for `major`, which people could use for double majors.  Though this is probably more complex than it's worth, when you could just have both majors in one string.


eg. %, ~, more below:

Added a text resume given the wide use of application tracking systems
