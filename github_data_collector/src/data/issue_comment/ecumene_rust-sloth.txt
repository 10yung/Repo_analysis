In Rust 1.40 a future-compatibility-warning will become a hard error, which will cause the dependency `nalgebra v0.17.2` to no longer compile.
Reason: [Rust 2015: No longer downgrade NLL errors](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64221)

```
rust-sloth$ cargo +nightly check

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0502`.
error: could not compile `nalgebra`.

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.

To fix this, I ran `cargo update --package nalgebra` to update it to `v0.17.3`.
(Just `cargo update` causes the terminal renderer to mess up...)

Btw, this project is amazing ^^
I've made a bash alias `pikachu` and I show it to basically every IT person I meet :)
Sorry for the stupid branch name; update-crate is very ambiguous.

I ran `cargo update` to fix a compiler error that was happening on nightly because of nalgebra.
This also updated all of the other dependencies.

I ran `cargo fmt` just for general code health and because it makes things look nice.

Then I went in and manually added `dyn` in a few places to fix a warning I was getting on nightly.
don't get me wrong, pikachu issa bro, but he gotta dam movie n everything; he boolin'

we need to display our boy _ferris_ in the _limelight_
