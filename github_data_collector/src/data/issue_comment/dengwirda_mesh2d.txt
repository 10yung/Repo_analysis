Hi Professor Darren Engwirda,

I have a narrow region and I hope to get the mesh as that in the picture.
My way in other mesher might be specifying the mesh nodes on the edge and the mesh size for that region. I understand the quality in the region is not very good, but that's just I hope to have.
is it possible/what is the good way to do this with mesh2d?

sorry it is not an issue, but I don't know where  to ask.

Thanks!
George.

It seems that when a region has a very high aspect ratio (e.g. a triangle with a very small angle), nodes are inserted into the border even when I have `ref1` set to `preserve`. Is this the expected behavior? Is there anything I can do to be more strict about preserving edge nodes?
