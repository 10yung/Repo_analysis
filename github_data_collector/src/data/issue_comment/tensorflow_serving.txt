- **Linux Ubuntu**: 18.04
- **TensorFlow Serving version**:  installed from repository via docker image latest
- **TensorFlow version**: 2.1.0

### Describe the problem
After serving my model with no problems in a local VM and using grpc to make a petition i receive 
```
<_InactiveRpcError of RPC that terminated with:
	status = StatusCode.UNAVAILABLE
	details = "DNS resolution failed"
	debug_error_string = "{"created":"@1579269796.445068556","description":"Failed to pick subchannel","file":"src/core/ext/filters/client_channel/client_channel.cc","file_line":3941,"referenced_errors":[{"created":"@1579269796.445060219","description":"Resolver transient failure","file":"src/core/ext/filters/client_channel/resolving_lb_policy.cc","file_line":262,"referenced_errors":[{"created":"@1579269796.445058914","description":"DNS resolution failed","file":"src/core/ext/filters/client_channel/resolver/dns/c_ares/dns_resolver_ares.cc","file_line":370,"grpc_status":14,"referenced_errors":[{"created":"@1579269796.445036075","description":"C-ares status is not ARES_SUCCESS: Could not contact DNS servers","file":"src/core/ext/filters/client_channel/resolver/dns/c_ares/grpc_ares_wrapper.cc","file_line":244,"referenced_errors":[{"created":"@1579269796.445032010","description":"C-ares status is not ARES_SUCCESS: Could not contact DNS servers","file":"src/core/ext/filters/client_channel/resolver/dns/c_ares/grpc_ares_wrapper.cc","file_line":244}]}]}]}]}"

```
Executing the 3 command-sets of this Basic TensorFlow Serving tutorial should not result in errors. This is supposed to be the carrot for introducing folk to TensorFlow Servings.

# Problem

The following error is reported when trying to test the server.

```
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'app'
```

# Steps to reproduce:

## Step 1

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/serving.git
cd serving
rm -rf /tmp/mnist
tools/run_in_docker.sh python tensorflow_serving/example/mnist_saved_model.py \
  /tmp/mnist
```
The export was successful.

## Step 2

```sh
docker run -p 8500:8500 \
--mount type=bind,source=/tmp/mnist,target=/models/mnist \
-e MODEL_NAME=mnist -t tensorflow/serving &
```
Seems to correctly start the serving.

Output:

input image has shape:

```
inputs = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0) -->  inputs.shape:  (1, 512, 512, 3), dtype inputs:  float32

**Describe the problem**
Im running tfserving inside a pod in kubernetes. 
Here is how many resources i give tfserving:
```
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "6000m"
            memory: 16Gi
          requests:
            cpu: "6000m"
            memory: 6Gi
```

My tfserving crashes as follows:

```

**Steps to reproduce**
Start tensorflow_model_server with the --port=8500 --rest_api_port=8501 --model_name=${MODEL_NAME} --model_base_path=${MODEL_BASE_PATH}/${MODEL_NAME}
Send traffic to the tensorflow serving pods. It will crash for some reason.

i tried to look at the memory usage, but dont see that tfserving runs out of memory. any idea about the error?
I have a model with a single dimension input that is serialized tf.example.
TF serving does not seem to perform batching with this model and the input.
I have the following batching config:

```
max_batch_size { value: 32 }
num_batch_threads { value: 16 }
batch_timeout_micros { value: 100000 }
pad_variable_length_inputs: true
allowed_batch_sizes : 2
allowed_batch_sizes : 4
allowed_batch_sizes : 8
allowed_batch_sizes : 32
```

I have tried it with and without "pad_variable_length_inputs: true".
I have tried batch_timeout_micros at various values, e.g. batch_timeout_micros { value: 1000 }. The value above is set to very high value to see if that would make the server to batch the incoming requests.  
On the TF serving server side, I run 
`tensorflow_model_server --port=8500 --model_name=mymodel --model_base_path=/serving --enable_batching=true --batching_parameters_file=/serving/batching_parameters.txt`
inside 
`docker run -it -p 8500:8500 -p 8501:8501 tensorflow/serving:latest-devel `
The inference is running on CPU on a machine with 16 CPU cores.
I run up to 16 clients on different machine issuing requests via gPRC against this server.
The inference succeeds - I get correct inference results in all clients. However, the resulting inference time is the same as without batching enabled, which seems to indicate that TF Serving is not doing batching (just queuing the requests and running inference with one request in a batch).

TF Serving also does not provide functionality to log or inspect whether it is doing batching or not and what the individual batch sizes are. I have tried to enable multiple logging levels via TF_CPP_MIN_VLOG_LEVEL and there are no tensorflow_serving log lines that correspond to inference requests or batching. This is very disappointing.

I have the same model with the same inputs running on the same machine using Nvidia TRT IS server with batching timeout set to 1ms and there batching produces significant speedup. Plus TRT IS provides info about the batching that is easy to access to confirm that batching is occurring and that inference is done with batches that have more than one element.
So the issue is not the model being unbatchable. The issue is not that batching won't help performance. The issue seems to be in how TF Serving handles the batching in this case.

So questions and requests:
1. Is batching supposed to work with models that have single dimension tf.example serialized input? 
2. Can TF Serving provide a way to access batching functionality logs or at least information of how many requests got batched into a batch?

Thank you
some tensorflow model is trained using tf.placeholder and some by tf.esitimator API, there are some difference between this two method when creating warmup data for tf-serving model
- if model is trained using tf.placeholder, we can know all input tensor name and shape from savedModel by executing the command, `saved_model_cli show`, so we can make up data according to input tensor name and shape to generate tf_serving_warmup_requests
- if model is trained using tf.estimator, we can't obtain any information about input tensor in detail, the model's input is format of Example or SequenceExample, so how can we create tf_serving_warmup_requests file just using model without any other input?
Thank you!  
when i inference the model with tensorflow serving,i found a question.i defined the dim of inputs,example input3 is shape (1, 3) or (None，3)， inputs3 = [1, 2, 3]  , i test it in my model.pb that is true,but i enter more dim that is also ok，ep：[1, 2, 3, 4], i dont understant why;

curl -d '{"signature_name":"voice_classification", "inputs": {"input1": [[6]], "input2": [[0.1]], "input3":[[3.0, 8.0, 1.0, 2.0]]}}' -X POST http://localhost:8501/v1/models/yjq:predict

my input3 dim is (1,3) like [1, 2, 3]. but i enter [1, 2, 3, 4]  also is ok

### System information
- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 16.04, RHEL 8
- **TensorFlow Serving installed from (source or binary)**: Both
- **TensorFlow Serving version**: 1.15.0

### Describe the problem
Currently when the configured model list is updated via a call to `handleReloadConfigRequest`, the request thread blocks until any newly added models become available.

Their availability however depends on the filesystem polling thread rescanning the filesystem at some periodic interval, meaning that there's an arbitrary delay before the requested changes actually take effect and the RPC returns.

This problem may not be very noticeable with the default polling interval of 1 second, but seems undesirable for longer intervals and in particular makes API-based dynamic reconfiguration incompatible with the `--file_system_poll_wait_seconds=0` setting (in this case all `handleReloadConfigRequest` calls time-out and do not take effect).

### Exact Steps to Reproduce
1. Start `tensorflow_model_server` with the `--file_system_poll_wait_seconds=0` option and empty initial config (no models)
2. Call `handleReloadConfigRequest` API with a `ModelListConfig` containing a (valid) new model. It will hang indefinitely or until the grpc deadline

I have opened PR #1518 with proposed fix.
