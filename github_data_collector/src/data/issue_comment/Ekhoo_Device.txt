using "!" is easy to crash.

The iPad 7th generation was being classified as an unknown device in my testing, so I added the correct screen height (1080) and the iPad Mini 5 as well.
Apple releases new devices each year(sometimes some season), and it force this library to release new version whenever new size of device came out.

When it comes to device size, most of people expect this lib to do its best effort, I think.

So I'd like to propose `Device.size` to return the nearest size as long as they know in the released version.

Once my proposal accepted, `Device.size` would be implemented like below.

```    
    static public func size() -> Size {
        / * bra bra bra * /
        switch screenHeight {
            case 0...480:
                return .screen3_5Inch
            case 481...568:
                return .screen4Inch
            case 569...667:
                return UIScreen.main.scale == 3.0 ? .screen5_5Inch : .screen4_7Inch
            case 668...736:
                return .screen5_5Inch
           /* and so on... */
```

What do you people think about this?

Added Swift Package Manager support.
Pretty much the title. Trying to migrate from Cocoapods -> SPM, looks like all we need is the manifest file. 

Hi,

I love your repo so much that I have created a YouTube video tutorial on it:

Feel free to add it to the README with the following image (people click on images more often than simple links)
