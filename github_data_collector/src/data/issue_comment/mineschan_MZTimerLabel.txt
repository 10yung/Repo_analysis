If you want the countdown timer to run for say 90 seconds but you want it to go 90...89...88...etc it will not do it because it assumes there is a minute digit displayed there. It's not a big deal but figured I'd report it anyway. Maybe I'll put a pull request in if I decide I really need it. 

It's for a game so that's why i want it to be just seconds. And we all know there is nothing fun about a colon! I really like the pod though. Nice work.
        _timerLabel.timeFormat = @"mm:ss:SS";

Use MZTimerLabel in UITableViewCell, cannot release!

pass the start date to begin again from it and start again
can I save the state of the timer when I navigate to different ViewController and get back again without stop or pause timer?
 
After opening the app, the countdown runs fine however it doesn't clear what it just set the text to.

The countdown lets say starts as 01:06:54 then it will display 01:06:53 on top of that then 01:06:52 on top of that etc etc 

This is the result:

Like i count down from 00:30 to 00:00 and continue count with -00:01, -00:02 ...
