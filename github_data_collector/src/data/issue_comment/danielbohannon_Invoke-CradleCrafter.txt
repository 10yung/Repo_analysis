Is there a method to get the cradles without the usage of Bits? 
While trying to use the built in '-Command' switch I was having some issues with how the program was parsing the argument. The exact command I was running was:
`import-module ./Invoke-CradleCrafter/Invoke-CradleCrafter.psd1; Invoke-CradleCrafter -Url 'http://192.168.1.226' -Command 'Memory\Certutil\All\1'   `

And every time I kept receiving the following error:

Looking at how the CLI arguments were getting parsed I noticed that they were getting split with a ',' but the example was showing '\\':

Changing my Command to use ',' instead managed to resolve the issue:

This could just be a problem with Powershell for linux. Just thought that I would submit a ticket in case anyone else has a similar issue.


                                                                                                                                    
I have all the ps1 and psd1 files on Desktop. In powershell I Import-Module .\Invoke-CradleCrafter.psd1 but when I try to create a cradle by stepping through the menu I keep getting "Out-Cradle : The term 'Out-Cradle' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet". I tried Import-Module .\Out-Cradle.ps1 then running Invoke-CradleCrafter but it still fails.
