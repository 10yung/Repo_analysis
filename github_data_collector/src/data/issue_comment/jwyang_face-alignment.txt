您好，我想请教您两个问题：
1. 依赖库##Dependencies必须要下载吗？我运行train_model.m文件时会跳到globalregression.m函数中的model = train(deltashapes(:, o), sparse(binaryfeatures), param)这一行，出现错误“未定义与 'double' 类型的输入参数相对应的函数 'train'。”
其中，我已经将 parpool(4)命令注释掉了
2.该检测算法适合手掌关键点检测吗？
非常好的分享！感谢！
我成功地在你们提供的图片库中运行成功了，结果很好。
但是目前我想用自己的图片试试，而该图片缺少.pts文件，参考了之前的提问，我选择用matlab自带的工具箱来圈出脸部边界。至于landmarks(也就是shape_gt变量)，我是随机赋值的。结果发现shape_gt没有被更新，也就是没有程序没有找到landmarks，想请教一下这是什么原因呢，该怎么解决呀？
我的想法是shape_gt这个变量是标记点的坐标，应该会被模型重新打上标记，所以我随机初始化了，这是为了匹配上程序的输入数据的格式，不知道是不是我这样的想法有问题。还望赐教！
Hi, thanks for your excellent codes. I got good performance when I use a set of 10000 pictures, with 5 landmarks. However, when I increase the landmarks to 9, the training of SVM is too slow -- after 'learn global regressors...', it can hardly go on. 
So would you like to give me some advice on it?
It looks like the points fitted based on bounding box size. The bounding box is require to cover perfectly on face. Since the codes used the groundtruth bounding box, it will be no problem for that. However, dataset with no groundtruth is the problem. Any idea for this? Or I missing something in the codes?
Dear Yang;
First of all thank you for the code. I have been trying to get your code to work for some days now but all my attempts to start parpool have failed. I have googled and tried everything. As this the error encountered by a number of Matlab Users, would you recommend running the code without parallel processing?

The information about my System is.
Core m y510c  CPU @ .8GHz 1GHz.
Win 8.1
MATLAB Version: 8.3.0.532 (R2014a)

Error is:
> Error using parpool (line 111)
> Failed to start a parallel pool. (For information in addition to the causing error, validate the profile 'LocalProfile1' in the
> Cluster Profile Manager.)
> 
> Error in train_model (line 31)
>         parpool(4);

i want to know where is the function ‘enlargingbbox’ defined in ‘src/loadsamples.m’？
THANKS
Hello @jwyang ,
I'm trying to run your matlab code on my machine now. But I met some issue when I tried to load the image in. 
in the test_model file, after I ran the code "te_data = loadsamples(imgpathlistfile, 1);"
the data returned is always "Empty cell array: 0-by-1";
Could you please provide me some information on it?
Thank you

Hi, 
could you please tell me how to train a model in 21 landmark , download a 21 landmark dataset or just use a 68 landmark dataset and change the global parameter landmark number to 21? 

first of all  thank you for your code ! it works well !
but i notice that when i run it on LFPW, the err is much  higher than the paper(5.17/3.35). but on Helen, the result is nearly the same . how do you think about this issue?
the second one i'm confusion is that for helen (194 landmakers), the paper use total 300 trees, averaged less than 2 for each maker. how it comes???  it seems like only decision tree instead random forest~~~~(>_<)~~~~ 

looking forward to your reply~~~
thanks again!

Hi, your code has been very helpful to me! Thank you for your contribution!
I have got your code running with afw dataset and the result is good.
However, I meet some problems when I try to do face alignment with my own images which do not have the ground truth .pts files. 
I read through your code, and try to replace bbox_facedet with viola jones detector result. But the shape_gt variable seems confusing to me.
Could you tell me how can I modify your code to realise face alignment with my own images?
