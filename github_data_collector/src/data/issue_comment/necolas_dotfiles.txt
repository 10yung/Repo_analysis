Fixes #55.
The [homebrew-dupes](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes) repo has been deprecated, and it's causing the line below to produce an error.

https://github.com/necolas/dotfiles/blob/986157a70a595fdbee540f06a491a68b339a9b00/lib/brew#L57

Here's the output:

The fix is to point to the homebrew-core repo. PR incoming.
Hi, is it possible to do script for this settings? i search hard bud cant find

# "Finder: items in the sidebar"
show Mac
hide iCloud/recents
defaults write com.apple.finder ShowRecentTags -bool false

# "Settings-general-RecentItems - NONE"

# "set F13(printScr) for save-screenshot-as-file"

# "set Alt+F13(printScr) for save-pic-of-area-as-file"

# "Mojave Settings-Update -ALL disable"



My editor was wrapping lines incorrectly before this change. Hope this helps!

`\[` and `\]` means:

> everything between these escaped square brackets, including the brackets themselves, is a non-printing character.

Line 132 and line 134 where `userStyle` and `hostStyle` are used respectively already have the square bracket escapes, but the definitions also contain square brackets. They are escaped twice. I believe this is incorrect. I see weird characters in the bash prompt before this change, and they disappear after this change.

Screenshot available upon request, thanks.


I tend to use vim's fuzzy matching as ctrlp is slow and doesn't support scala yet. original repo is not maintained, new fork is here: https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim

- Create a script to check if xCode is installed; if so inform the user,
  if not run automated install script of xCode CLI tools
- Create a recursive script to automate xCode CLI tools; checks version
  of kernel to ensure user is on 13 or up (Mavericks) as thats when
  `xcode-select --install` was introduced.

Issue: #33
