Hi there! Super cool plugin. My XAVC (.MXF) videos preview fine in quicklook without QLVideo ,but they do not show thumbnails. Installing QLVideo solves the thumbnail issue, but now my .MXF files quicklook as snapshots whereas they were full videos before.

Is there a way to toggle on/off the snapshot feature? 

Running on 10.14

Thanks!
When a custom icon or image attachment is included with a MKV file, QLVideo should show this thumbnail as the first big preview frame as long as true QuickLook playback of MKV videos is not supported what would make this plug-in outstanding.
If you use Homebrew to install, the mkv format file cannot be previewed. After that, I uninstall it. After installing it through the pkg installation package, the mkv format can be previewed.
i've downloaded 
version 1.91
but when selecting it in the macOS Finder it reports
version 1.9.1

the difference is actually 82 semi major releases ...
I am unsure whether or not this is by design, but while the files I am referring to(a bunch of .mkv) have previews if I navigate to their directory, they do not have previews in a search or in my smart folders.

Hi,

Info: MacBook Pro 10.13.1, QLVideo 1.90
Issue: White Frame in finder preview (please see attached screenshot).
Selecting another mkv file to preview in Finder works okay, and returning to the mkv that is previewed as "white frame" works okay again.

I have also attached the qlmanage report as requested.

Cheers,
Vangeliis

Hi,

is there any way QLVideo could show some Placeholder Image as Preview if it wasn't able to create a preview instead of the default Finder image?

I'm always wondering if it failed or if I still have to wait for some preview image.

Thanks!
It would be nice if the advice displayed to the user at the end of the installation was localized. Please feel free to comment below with a translation into your language of the following text which will appear in the "installation was successful" dialog:

> To see thumbnails of video files you may need to relaunch Finder or log out and back in again.
> 
> You may experience high CPU and disk usage for the next few minutes while Spotlight re-indexes all of your "non-native" audio and video files.

Also, please provide a translation of the term "[Frame rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate)", which will appear in the Finder's "Get Info" dialog.
