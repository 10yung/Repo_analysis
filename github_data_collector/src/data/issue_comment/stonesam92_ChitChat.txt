Fixed some formatting in the README.
Running ChitChat 1.5 on MacOS Mojave 10.14.5 and recently encountered this issue screenshotted below, where WhatsApp is asking me to update safari 9+.  (For reference, I currently have Safari 12.1.1 on my machine)

<img width="639" alt="Screenshot 2019-07-02 at 20 07 09" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7822086/60560661-80094800-9d05-11e9-86d8-6d167d221ad2.png">

Whenever I switch apps with the CMD+Tab shortcut, I see an app notification badge even when the only threads with new messages are muted.

I know that WhatsApp does this in at least iOS as well, but it would be nice to have an option to avoid this behaviour, to cut down on distractions.
Almost every app with tab-like entities can switch between the tabs by pressing âŒ˜+number. ChitChat could also benefit from this.

Conversations 1 through 9, and even 0, should be accessible like this.
ChitChat is disconnecting from WhatsApp within an hour every time I open the application, and never reconnects during the instance of the application.

Once I close and re-open the app, it works every time for a few minutes, up to about an hour.

I haven't noticed if there's a pattern to the amount of time that it stays connected.

This occurs with:
* ChitChat 1.5.0
* macOS Sierra 10.12.4
* WhatsApp 2.17.11, iOS 
* iOS 10.2.1 (14D27) on iPhone 5s

This has only been tested on and occurs with the same local wifi connection, for maybe the past 3 weeks. It used to work without issue. Updates have been configured to install automatically on my Mac and iPhone, I haven't payed attention to what was installed over the last 3 weeks.

What sort of troubleshooting should I do?
Could you perhaps implement zoom so that you can zoom out on the entire interface. 
HI, 
Need js file for iphone or ipad to inject.

I've noticed that this repo and https://github.com/Neo11/ChitChat aren't being updated anymore.

Did people want this app to have continued development? I have contributed to https://github.com/Neo11/ChitChat in the past but with Whatsapp Desktop I stopped because it seemed that people weren't very interested. However, if they are I don't mind keeping up the repo. I don't think that @stonesam92 is active, so I can just create a new repo for continued development.

EDIT: It is now being continued at https://github.com/VagishVela/ChitChat
the icon on the menu bar used to turn blue when i have a new whatsapp message
it doesnt anymore,  does this option still exist or have i disabled it somehow?
it's a really nice feature and im sad it's not there anymore! 

First of all, this app is amazing and is so simple but does everything I need. I'm trying to convert it to an internal web chat app where I already have a web app. I'm trying to unhide the title bar and move the webview down so they don't overlap. I've tried moving the origin of the webview in the appDelegate to the size of the titlebar but that's not working. Anyone know of a fix?
