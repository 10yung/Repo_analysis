Hi!
Javadoc is pretty hard to read in the plain text java file. I would like to add a little guide to the README.md file to help other developers to get started quickly. Would you accept a Pull Request for this?

It works on my MotoX. However, the measure/layout/draw time consumption are always n/a. Can they be supported?

The ViewServer class isn't working on my device. I keep getting the following error:

12:16:52 E/ViewServerDevice: Unable to debug device: lge-nexus_4-04848005ded98f1f
