Popup is presented on a TabBarController which is parent of several child navigation controllers. The popup's content view controller is a regular UIViewController.

The UIViewController has prefersStatusBarHidden set to YES. Drag style is set to default (iOS 10.0+)

When **clicking** the arrow or popup bar to hide and show the VC, the status bar animation _works_ as expected:

When slowly **dragging** the VC downwards, the status bar does _not_ update and gets stuck on top of the tab bar contents:

Have tried messing around with setNeedsStatusBarAppearanceUpdate() but no luck. Setting prefersStatusBarHidden to NO eliminates this problem.

Simulated on iPhone 8 with iOS 12.4+. Works as expected on iPhone X and above. Using latest LNPopupController framework.

#### Description
I am using the latest version of the library installed via carthage

I am facing this issue only in ios 13 runnig iphone x and 11 (i.e iphone 8 and prior devices running ios13 are fine)

as you can see popupbar starts from the page inset and goes behind the tabbar. and with any action (updating the popup, pushing a viewController, clicking on the tabbar), popupbar moves to its correct position

Xcode version : 11.0
#### Description
On notched devices on 12.x and when using a UITabBarController, the tab is initially drawn without safeAreaInsets and appears shrunk. After presenting the popup bar, the tab bar is drawn correctly and even after the popup bar is dismissed. Rotation will also cause the tab bar to be drawn correctly. 

Un-linking the LNPopupController framework from the project will not cause the bug but obviously the popup bar can no longer be called.

Initial launch:

No popup after presented:

#### Steps to Reproduce
Not able to reproduce in a smaller project unfortunately but the project that it does appear in is available [here](https://github.com/wstyres/Zebra). The LNPopupController is built in a submodule so make sure it is cloned along with it. The tab bar will be shrunk upon first launch.

#### Device, OS and Xcode Versions
Latest Xcode 11.2 beta, latest commit of LNPopupController. I have seen this issue on 12.4 X/Xs/Xr simulators and on physical X/Xs devices on 12.4.
I've started work on 3.0.

It is intended as a general rewrite of the entire presentation model. The idea is to use `UIPresentationController` subclasses with custom animation and interaction controllers. (#225)
This will greatly simplify the presentation system and allow many more features, such as "free" card presentation on iOS 13.

Planned features that will also make the cut for 3.0:
- Animations that run alongside the presentation animations of the popup (#211)
- Supporting card presentations (iOS 13, for now, but can be any OS version with a custom presentation controller) (#143)
- Dimming of contents under the popup (#325)
- Remove legacy iOS support (#335)

The goal is to support as much of the current feature set, as possible. Some minor changes to look and feel might happen due to the transition to presentation controllers. There are still some unknowns.

The effort is being implemented in the `v3_0` branch.
So far, I have removed all legacy code, removed all old presentation code and have a proof of concept using the iOS 13 card presentation controller as the basis for popup presentation.

Todo:
- [x] Add support for full screen popup presentation
- [ ] Add support for interactive ("Drag") presentation
- [x] Add support for iOS 13 interactive card presentation
- [x] Explore card presentations for iOS 12 and below
- [x] Explore non-full width presentations
- [ ] Explore embedding the popup bar inside bottom bars, such as tab bars
- [ ] Explore the possibility of the bar's background view extending under the hosting view's safe areas
Hi guys,

I am planning to clean up the code and drop support for 9, 10. I will create a stabilized version with iOS 13 support, and that will be the last to support legacy OSes.

After that, I plan to clean the code from legacy and maybe rewrite some of the presentation stuff as time permits.

Can I configure the outer padding of the Popup, for example to have right and left padding. And if it applicable to make outer shadow for it?
I have a horizontal Collection View in my View Controller that is presented by LNPopupController and I can't find a way to register dragging down the controller if the touches are in the Collection View's area. If I disable scrolling of Collection View it works great but disabling it is out of question, also subclassing UICollectionView and using UIGestureDelegate's method `gestureRecognizer(_ gestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer, shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWith otherGestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer)` doesn't make any difference.
Just like apple music for iPad:
