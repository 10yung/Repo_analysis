Hi

There is a nice solution for ALM calculation, but parse functions couldn't treat data with header from MovieLen, therefore code doesn't work in current time

the formatting by the end of the file is all off. 
This fixes building of machine-learning on OSX.  `sbt build` would otherwise return the "java.lang.RuntimeException: deduplicate: different file contents found in the following"

After cloning the project, executing sbt assembly gave me the following error:

[error](*:assembly) deduplicate: different file contents found in the following:

I simply did my best trying to workaround the issue.
Probably there is a cleaner solution but at lease with this changes I could assemble the job.

Thanks for the training exercise and merge this pull if appropriate.
