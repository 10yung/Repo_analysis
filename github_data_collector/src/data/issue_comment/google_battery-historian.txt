I suppose I have an incompatible version of Java, but it isn't stated which I should use inside of the README. So if that's the case, can we add the correct version to the README?
This command donÂ´t Work : 
docker -- run -p <port>:9999 gcr.io/android-battery-historian/stable:3.0 --port 9999

the result is -> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ELbti_LVUAAP3lS.jpg:large

Thanks ...

Is this item means how much mAh left in battery? Further more, which part of andriod system service recorded this value? If possible, I want to collect this value in a constant rate, how can I do this?
As other people have reported I also get errors when analyzing Android 10 bugreports.  `Note: Could not parse aggregated battery stats.`

I then pulled and ran googles latest image 3.1, and it does indeed work with Android 10 bugreports. So after this, I tried extracting all the files from the image and running it myself. These are commands I use (I use Ubuntu):

```
//Create new container
 docker create  --name="bh" -p 80:80 --expose=80 gcr.io/android-battery-historian/stable:3.1

 //Copy all files from container to current local folder
 docker cp bh:/gopure/src/github.com/google/battery-historian $PWD

```
I then ran setup.go and then battery-historian.go. The application launched but I still get the same error, `"Could not parse aggregated battery stats."`

 With the same source I have also tried building my own docker image with the following dockerfile:

```
 #Use latest golang:alpine version which is smaller than regular golang.
FROM golang:1.12.5-alpine3.9

#Get the battery historian code from local code commit repo
WORKDIR /go/src/codecommit/battery-historian
COPY . /go/src/codecommit/battery-historian

#Install Java, git and python and cleanup after in the same layer.
RUN apk update && \
    apk add openjdk8-jre git python2 && \
    rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*

#Install dependencies recursively and remove the third_party directory after it has been used for compiling.
RUN go get ./... &&  \
    go run setup.go

#Open default port
EXPOSE 80

#Run the start file for battery historian in a container.
CMD go run cmd/battery-historian/battery-historian.go --port 80
```

But when I use this image, I still get the same error as before. 

What are I and Google doing differently?

Hello

I'm trying to follow [Getting Started](https://github.com/google/battery-historian#getting-started) and while analyzing new bug report from my Google Pixel 2 XL w/ Android Q, I run into following message:

report seems empty on my screen although Device and Android ID made it, rest is pretty empty

Please advise.
The Docker example in the README fails:

```
docker -- run -p 9999:9999 gcr.io/android-battery-historian/stable:3.0 --port 9999
docker: 'run' is not a docker command.
See 'docker --help'
```

When `--` is removed it works fine:

```
docker run -p 9999:9999 gcr.io/android-battery-historian/stable:3.0 --port 9999
2019/07/15 16:14:28 Listening on port:  9999
```
I have run;
docker run -p 19991:9999 gcr.io/android-battery-historian/stable:3.0 --port 9999

and i get the output below when I go to "localhost:19991" and try to upload a bugreport(both zip and txt);
Nandans-MacBook-Pro:~ nandant$ docker run -p 19991:9999 gcr.io/android-battery-historian/stable:3.0 --port 9999

when I try to upload the report on the screen nothing gets updated and the 0->100% bar does not show up. It seems through the terminal Battery Historian is receiving the bug report but the localhost:19991 is not updating with the upload

I have tried restarting my Docker, restarting my computer, stopping and restarting the docker run command, as well as trying multiple different bug reports that have worked in the past.
