For high availability, it would be great to support multi brokers in cluster.
Is there any Promise support?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Hi,

I found our URI contains special character: **!'()***. 
So could you please add encodeURIComponentRFC3986 function and then replace original encodeURIComponent in utils.coffee?

**encodeURIComponentRFC3986: (str) ->
  return encodeURIComponent(str).replace(/[!'()*]/g, (c) ->
     return '%' + c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16);
     );**
changed the way filters are encoded to match the REST API.  this does not bring it into 100% compatibility and I've only tested these 2 new classes.
