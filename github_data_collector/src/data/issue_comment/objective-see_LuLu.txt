Hi. Can we disable/enable Lulu from terminal without click on button "Disable"? (lulu-cli) =)
Example: 
"lulu disable", "lulu enable"

https://prnt.sc/qlq93t

There's a file that I need to block, but it only exists temporarily, so I have to add it quickly. I can't add the rule if the file doesn't exist.
If lulu enabled 'cli application responses connect: errno -536870174 tcp 443'

from osx log
LuLu (Security)
Subsystem: com.apple.securityd Category: security_exception
MacOS error: -67062 or MacOS error: -67034

can someone help with it.

OSX catalina
Tried on 1.2.3 and 1.2.1 versions

Hello I can't install the LuLu app. Whenever I get to the point where I have to open  the 'General' tab under 'Security and Privacy' pane. At the bottom, click the 'allow' button to allow.
There is no button to allow. 
There are only two options between App store and App Store identified developers.

Could someone help me?
Hi,

Not sure if it is affecting performance - seems to run fine, but absolutely filling the logs...

Anyone else seeing this??



Had LuLu previously installed and wanted to upgrade. 

Downloaded zip, unzipped and copied app to /Applications, overwriting previous app. Right click opened and was presented with 'Upgrade' & uninstall. Tried to upgrade and failed. Re-unzipped app and copied to /Applications and tried again. Failed. Next time I tried to uninstall.  Success, Restarted. After restart copied and tried to install in /Applications. Showed me 'Upgrade' again even though uninstalled. Tried and failed again.

Looked at change logs and saw bug fix for installing in /Applications. 

Tried to install from /Downloads, worked.üëç
Maybe I found a bug. This is how looks the LuLu wizard of the latest version with the dark theme activated:

Text is white but the background is not, so text disappears. :(
Issue:
Certain applications should only be allowed if a specific IP address is specified.  This assures that that application if allowed doesn't connect through multiple IP addresses.

Desired:
Either add or when the application itself uses an IP address. Allow (specific IP address or range) all other IP addresses a prompt goes up that requires authorization of that IP address.

thanks
Issue:
There are some services that repeatedly keep checking but you don't need them to check them every hour or day.

Desired
Ability to specify how often are they allowed to access the network. Specifically add "allow" then frequency allowance (once, daily, weekly, monthly) otherwise block
For four days I got the same massage to update to version 1.2.2. when I started my MacBook. Every time I clicked on update and waited some minutes while rebuilding the cache and did a restart. It doesn‚Äòt help. So I today uninstalled LuLu and installed the last version. Since then I‚Äòm unable to work with my MacBook!!!! It get connected to the internet and all online-resources, but the connection is so slooooowwwww, that even Mail gets a timeout! I can‚Äòt connect to LuLu homepage or something else, so I have to write this call for help with my iPad!
Uninstalling LuLu doesn‚Äòt fix the problem!
So what do I have to do to get my full speed back???? With or without LuLu doesn‚Äòt matter, but I must have access to the internet without every program getting a timeout!!!
Help, help , help ... what to do???
