As a suggestion, I spent an entire day playing around with a bunch of bezier paths, some complicated, some very simple, until it hit me, the direction of the winding would affect the result.

So, it might be worth mentioning, if you're not seeing any results using bezier paths, try using `reversing` (Swift)/`beziePathByReversingPath` (Objective C) and use the resulting path

How to set the bezier position to center ? As you can see in picture it's appearing at the bottom instead of center :

Added project with shared scheme for support for management via [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

 __unused UIImage *icon = [UIImage imageNamed:@"circle"];
    //UIBezierPath *bezier = [UIBezierPath twitterShape];
    UIColor *color = kATOrangeColor;

```
self.splashView = [CBZSplashView splashViewWithIcon:icon backgroundColor:color];
self.splashView.iconColor = [UIColor purpleColor];
self.splashView.animationDuration = 1.1;


[self.view addSubview:self.splashView];
```

Not working! 

I want to load a UIViewController instead of an image when animation is done. How can I do that?

The only time _iconStartSize_ is used is in the _initWithIconImage_ method, therefore any attempt to change it after initialization has no effect.

could CBZSplashView also support launching in landscape mode. if you ignore the location pop-up, here's what you get at present:

many thanks!

Same pull request as [this one](https://github.com/callumboddy/CBZSplashView/pull/18) but cleaner.

It allows user to modify the scale tranforms, which was usefull for me.

I remove the Pod folder and indicate in the podspec to use the `Classes` folder (Pod folder was a duplicate of Classes). Feel free to tell me if I was doing wrong :), but from my point of view this was a mistake that could lead to problems.

The `startAnimation` method uses `+ (void)animateWithDuration:(NSTimeInterval)duration delay:(NSTimeInterval)delay usingSpringWithDamping:(CGFloat)dampingRatio initialSpringVelocity:(CGFloat)velocity options:(UIViewAnimationOptions)options animations:(void (^)(void))animations completion:(void (^)(BOOL finished))completion NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(7_0);` which is only available in iOS7 but the cocoapod specifies only ios6 is required.

  s.source           = { :git => "https://github.com/callumboddy/CBZSplashView.git", :tag => '0.1.1'}

I believe you want the version to be '1.0.0'
