This includes the v2 parameter changes, because GitHub.

Note: `self` as a return type is cranky at times.  I am not sure if we should include it or leave that doc-only.  I made that a separate commit so it's easy to rebase out if we decide not to.  Input on that welcome.
Whether this gets tagged as 2.0 or 1.1 is still open, I think, but here's the code.
What:
Standardizes the README file providing a common language and an implementation link.

Why:
There are differences between PSR's READMEs in regarding language and the lacking of implementations references. So I've updated all READMEs using the https://github.com/php-fig/http-factory as base.
