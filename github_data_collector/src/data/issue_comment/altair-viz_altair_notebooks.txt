I feel this repo has fallen behind. I think it could be a useful tool for reference as well as a place for explanations of more detailed examples such as `09-Measles.ipynb`. 

Seeing the steps involved in building more complex visualizations is a key insight which I feel is sometimes missing in the main documentation. I think the [Marginal Scatterplot](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/scatter_marginal_hist.html), [Wheat and Wages](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/wheat_wages.html), and [Seattle Weather](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/seattle_weather_interactive.html) examples are candidates which would benefit from showing in more detail how the components are built. 

In any case I think updating the current notebooks to `v 4.0` is important. 

I would love to help with the process of updating and maintaining the `altair_notebooks` project but I wanted to check in first to gauge the communities interest. Are there any changes you would like to see? 
There are currently no obvious examples about Binding Selection, especially not in "Example Gallery" page.

There are some good example already there, it would be great to move them to Example Gallery?

I reference these example notebooks a lot and find them to be a really helpful base from which I might compose a visualization. I thought adding a map might be nice and helpful for anyone looking to get a sense of the entire library. 

Most of the map examples focus on creating a choropleth so I decided to take one of the other examples, specifically the [London Tube Map](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/london_tube.html) and break it down by each section to show how it works and why. 

Hope you find it helpful. 

thanks

Luke
