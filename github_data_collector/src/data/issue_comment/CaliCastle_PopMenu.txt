1. 能否加入弹出位置的那种小尖尖，类似于macOS风格的（与#34 重复了，但是不知道你加上了没）
2. 能不能做到当前点击的选项的动画（图片里面点击的话会变小，图片中“网格视图”被点击），达到类似的效果就行。

Thank you first, this is the most elegant menu I have ever seen. And I'm a OC Guy 😂，I hope to see the Objective-C version on a certain day.

```Swift
let actions = [
    PopMenuDefaultAction(title: "Some Text, Some Text, Some Text, Some Text, Some Text, Some Text"),
    PopMenuDefaultAction(title: "Some Text"),
    PopMenuDefaultAction(title: "Short"),
    PopMenuDefaultAction(title: "A Longer Text")
]
let popMenu = PopMenuViewController(actions: actions)
present(popMenu, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
运行在横屏状态下,UI显示正常,
然后切换到竖屏,显示就异常了
导致UI显示异常的原因主应该要是没有考虑title太长的情况
当title太长的情况,建议title可以像跑马灯一样滚动显示

Currently, there is selected UI affects happened when only pan gesture.

If you just tap, there is no feedback for which button touched.

Would it be good if there has one feedback?

## ✍🏻 Issue Description
Hi, I know that PopMenu currently has a pan gesture such then after the menu is up, you can drag up and down to switch menu options, then release to use it.

My desire is to touch down on a button, then with that same touch, drag up and down to select different menu options. This would work similarly to the Apple Music 3D Touch, then pan on the popup menu gesture.
