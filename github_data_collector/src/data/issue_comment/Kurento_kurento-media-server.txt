Now that KMS has dropped support for Ubuntu Trusty, I think we should drop also the SysV init script and replace it by a Systemd service file.

There are some things that the current SysV init script handles that the Systemd service proposed in this PR does not (and, I think, it should not):

*  Create and initialize ownership + perms for logs directory
*  Set the Kernel core dump pattern if given by the user in the configuration file

A thing that I did not find a way to do is to dynamically set the per-process max open file descriptors to half of system-wide max. I've set a conservative default of 100000 files in the service file, that can be changed by users via command `systemctl edit kurento-media-server`.
This is a quick fix for openssl-1.1. Since openssl-1.1,`SSL_R_SHORT_READ` is removed. So, I made this patch for a quick fix for this issue.
On some Ubuntu 16.04 systems, the calculated max files is too large for the system. This modified command sets an upper limit to the calculation at one million files.
With that also simplified `#if defined(...)` checks a bit to reduce nesting.
