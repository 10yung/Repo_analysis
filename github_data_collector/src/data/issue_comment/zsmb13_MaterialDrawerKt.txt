This is something that's included (at least in parts) in the base library, and it would be nice to have here.

~~This issue will have to be dealt with once Android Studio 3.0 is stable, since as of Canary 9, checks for these annotations don't seem to work when calling the annotated methods from Kotlin.~~

- Update: Android Studio 3 is now stable, but the issue still remains, misusing properties that have these annotations doesn't produce any lint warnings.

- Update 2: [here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/47016590/4465208) is an unanswered StackOverflow issue for the same problem.

Example of what needs to be done:

```kotlin
var background: Int
    @Deprecated(...)
    get() = nonReadable()
    set(@DrawableRes value) { // <- resource annotation
        builder.withHeaderBackground(value)
    }
```

Example of what Studio should mark as an error:

```kotlin
accountHeader {
    background = R.drawable.header // this is ok, this is the proper usage
    background = 1234 // should warn for this, but doesn't
}
```

Example of what Studio marks as a warning in Java as of 3.0 Canary 9:
```java
AccountHeaderBuilderKt builder = new AccountHeaderBuilderKt(this);
builder.setBackground(25124); // Error: Expected resource of type drawable
```
