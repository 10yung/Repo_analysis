Since default value of `next` field of a node to be inserted is `null`, we need not to assign it to `this.head` which is `null` for position `0`.
Hi, I've super enjoyed this data-structures instruction. Nice work!

As a beginner of these concept, sometime it's difficult to connect written code to the data-structure it's representing.

I tried to add btree shape with example code.
Hope it'd be helpful for the beginner like me.
Feel free to change the sentence and example code.

Thanks for great guide, I will continue to read your [the-super-tiny-compiler](https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler) from now.

Instead of linked list.

I'm not sure about that but the implementation actually looks like list. 

Maybe the commend was not updated?
