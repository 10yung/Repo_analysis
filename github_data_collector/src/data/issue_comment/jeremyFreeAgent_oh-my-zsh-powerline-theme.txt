Hi, I use the default settings, but when i activate a new environment in anaconda, the prompt of the virtual env information appears in wrong locations,  above the powerline instead of the left of the powerline

Even if I set the `POWERLINE_PATH="short"`, it is still too long for some path, like ` smap10@Xu ~/Project/Relation-Extraction/relation-classication-cnn-pytorch`

Is ther any way only show the current working directory, like this

```
smap10@Xu .../Relation-Extraction/relation-classication-cnn-pytorch
```
or
```
smap10@Xu ~/.../relation-classication-cnn-pytorch
```

I have turned off the date, but the prompt/icon on the far right still shows.
When I am in a directory which is not a git repository, there is an white space shown at the end of the prompt.

I've tried to uncomment the if-statement in line 109 to line 128, not work.

Also tried the ternary expression as [this article](http://www.unix.com/shell-programming-and-scripting/109723-zsh-ternary-operator-syntax-help.html):

`POWERLINE_GIT_INFO_LEFT=$(("$(git_prompt_info)"=""?1:0))`

But end up with : zsh: bad math expression: illegal character: "

My temporary solution is add below lines to my ~/.zshrc:

```
function newCD(){
	cd $1;
	source "$ZSH/themes/$ZSH_THEME.zsh-theme"
}
alias cd="newCD"
```

But it seems to so ugly and unstable as I changed the behavior of the default command "cd", so does anyone have a better solution?

My prompt is green and blue, and it does not look well when I use Terminal in Basic theme. I have tried to change my theme into Solarized Dark and Light, but both do not work. And https://github.com/jeremyFreeAgent/oh-my-zsh-powerline-theme/issues/26 seems having the same problem. Could you please kindly tell me what is your terminal theme, when you make the screenshot? Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.

The right arrow unicode characters don't display correctly with transparency in iterm2. Their color stays constant with transparency change despite surrounding background color adjusting appropriately. Not sure if this is an iterm2 issue displaying colored unicode, but perhaps there is a workaround with the powerline theme? 

With transparency off:

With transparency at 50%:

Transparency at 100%:

If merged, this code will add user settings for each of the git icons and colors. This also fixes default symbols setting the color to black instead of `$POWERLINE_GIT_COLOR_FRONT`.

POWERLINE_CUSTOM_CURRENT_PATH does nothing, because it then sets POWERLINE_CURRENT_PATH instead of POWERLINE_PATH

Feasibly, POWERLINE_CUSTOM_CURRENT_PATH could be renamed to POWERLINE_CUSTOM_PATH, or its behaviour could be directly rolled into the POWERLINE_PATH variable (by checking if it is unset before setting the default).
