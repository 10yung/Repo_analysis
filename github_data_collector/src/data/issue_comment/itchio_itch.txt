There's a [long-ass thread here](https://itch.io/post/1068220) but the gist is: some folks on macOS see "Post https://api.itch.io/login: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority."

There's about 60 issues on the Go issue tracker about this, and the main takeaway is: this keeps breaking, only for a small % of folks, the Go devs aren't sure exactly why, to their credit they're trying to do something Apple doesn't really want you to do and the APIs are terribly easy to misuse (maybe even impossible to use correctly?)

I was all out of ideas and then I thought "hey why not bundle Root CA certificates", and lo and behold, [certifi does exactly that](https://github.com/certifi/gocertifi).

So I'm going to try use certifi's Root CAs (a curated subset of the Mozilla CA Certs collection) on macOS, see if that fixes it. The relevant work is in https://github.com/itchio/httpkit.

Regarding the itch.io Desktop Client 25.4.0 on Windows

1. Open Itch Client on a Dualhead or Multimonitor Setup
2. Check for Downloads and move the Download Window from the primary to the secondary screen.
3. End the itch client (e. g. reboot or quit)
4. remove the dualhead or multimonitor setup (Just one Monitor)
5. Start itch and check Downloads.

Expected behaviour: The download Window is seen on the primary (only) Monitor.

Shown behaviour: The download Window appeared in the taskbar, but was nowhere to be seen. The Windows function to sort all Windows (Fenster überlappen/ Fenster gestapelt anzeigen) did sort all Windows, except the download window.

The download window could be moved after i restored the multimonitor setting and moved the download window to the primary display.

Notes: The descripted behaviour does not arise if the monitor(s) are hotplugged or Win+P is used while itch is running, in these cases the download window "pops" to another screen.

Hey, there.

I might be missing something, but on my itch app, I don't own the paid software I've made and uploaded. That means I can't test out builds and running through itch unless I purchase my own software (or turn off payment on the game I'm testing before going live).

![Screenshot from 2019-11-11 23-42-45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4733521/68651871-28fa5780-04dd-11ea-8fbe-380efc9a736a.png)

As seen in the above screenshot, I'm logged into my itch account on the app, and am under my Creations tab, but only my free games are showing as "Install" - the paid ones are showing as "Buy Now". There's no way to "skip" past paying after clicking "Buy Now", and restarting the app doesn't seem to do anything. Seems like this might be the same bug as #165, though there might be a much more recent version of this particular ticket? I wasn't able to find anything more likely in a search here on Github, though.

I'm running Solus Linux 4.0 Fortitude 64-bit, with itch 25.4.0, downloaded from the website, as I recall (not from the software center or manually downloaded / installed).
The Chinese translation hosted on the platform:

- [_itch.io/desktop app/Chinese_](https://weblate.itch.ovh/projects/itchio/itch/zh/) (with language code `zh`)

is actually Simplified Chinese (language code `zh_Hans`).

This should match the language code of the website translation:

- [_itch.io/website (start here)/Chinese (Simplified)_](https://weblate.itch.ovh/projects/itchio/itchio/zh_Hans/)

I suggest correcting the language tag.
Just noticed it was broken, easy fix.
Just have a struct somewhere (manager?) that has Binary/Args, and have a method on Wrapper that does the rejigger.

Also handle the case where Binary is already relative to WorkingDir.

To be precise, it needs https:// resources but everything is translated to itch-cave.

We could probably filter by hostname or something.
