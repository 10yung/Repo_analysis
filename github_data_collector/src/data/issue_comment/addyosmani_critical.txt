We will need to drop support for Node.js 8.x but that's OK IMO for v2.x. From a quick test some tests fail.
Makes the intention clearer.

TODO:

* [x] figure out how to handle the Vinyl test failure
Same as #422 for 1.x
This set of patches along with the deps updates (and the changes I made in the deps themselves so far) reduce the module load time from **~950ms** to **~750ms** on my dev Windows VM. Also, the package size should be reduced.

I tested the branch with Node.js 6.4.0 and tests passed, but please review carefully so that we don't miss something :)

I kept the patches separate, but I'll squash them if/when you approve @bezoerb.
We need to test this just in case it's causing mixed line endings.
I'm trying to build a project on a new MacBook (Catalina) which builds fine on my old MacBook (Mojave). Nothing changed in packages, just a minor version in node.js (v12.12.0 instead of v12.10.0 on the old MacBook).

I get this error:
```
99% [0] after emitting CriticalCssWebpackPluginTypeError: Cannot read property 'content-type' of undefined
    at temp (/Users/tom/Sites/parkwind-oriel-dev/node_modules/critical/lib/file-helper.js:106:37)

    at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:93:5)
```

Other projects with the same setup are being build and the Critical CSS files are being generated. I tried updating the NPM modules to the same versions as the working project, but no cigar. Updating them to the very latest didn't work either.
And I can't seem to find anything related on Google.

Does anyone have an idea what this could be?
This is WIP, but feel free to review and push any patches here @bezoerb :)

Not sure it's 100% worth doing this; it does save a bit but compared to downloading Chromium, this is nothing...

It looks like `critical` downloads the image (maybe to perform inlining image?) which costs additional bandwidth consumption. Is there an option to turn it off? 
I'm trying to use Critical for deploying a static website on Now Zeit.

For using critical on a remote server (like Zeit Now) it seems I have to use puppeteers and Chrome.

Zeit seems to permit it, and the documentation gives some info about it here:
https://zeit.co/blog/serverless-chrome

I'm trying to follow the documentation but I'm not so into puppeteers so it looks I miss some steps.

Anyone has faced the same issue? Maybe give some tips or some repo examples?

Maybe off-topic, but I would like to ask anyway
