I tried to look in the developers guide, but couldn't find the answer: 

Is there a way I can get the Web Address that Ngrok generates? For example: 

When I run `./ngrok http 3001` It will create the following: 

```
Account                       fake (Plan: Free)                                           
Version                       2.3.35                                                      
Region                        New Zealand                                   
Web Interface                 http://XXX.0.0.1:4040                                       
Forwarding                    http://f5291e35.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3001           
Forwarding                    https://f5291e35.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3001          
```

I want to create a shell script that needs to get the `https://f5291e35.ngrok.io` address, but I am hoping I can get some light on where to look, or if there is a command that can be run to fetch it.

Hey, I'm currently using ngrok, but I'm having cross compilation problems. I have two computers, one as a server and one as a client. Their processors are different.

Server:

Client:

I download and compile ngrok on the server

Copy ngrok to client to run：

As you can see, when the client runs ngrok, it reports an error. I think this is a cross compilation problem. Could you help me to solve it，thanks.


I have a speech recognition web user interface which requires microphone for input. When I run the URL provided to me by ngrok, there's no option to initialize microphone. How can I enable the microphone using ngrok? 
So i am using ngrok to host VNC but it works fine, but the issue is that VNC viewers won't see it, i'm using TightVNC for it.
`ngrok tcp 5969`
The error i get when i try to connect:

"Connection has been gracefully closed"

Oh and, im using QEMU's VNC support.
im starting ngrok with ngrok http 3000
after i start apache2
first im checking https://localhost/
i see a different page
after i open my ngrok page and i see different page...
so the page im seeing on ngrok isnt the page i have in /var/www/html/ and www folder does not have index file!

im using kali linux but which folder is hosted with ngrok after starting it?


[Location .ngrok2/ngrok.yml ]
tunnels:
first-app:
addr: 80
proto: http
second-app:
addr: 3000
proto: http


and i tryed this one then this is giving error ...
On my Mac : Catalina.

When I open ngrok it runs the initial opening script and gets hung on:
`[Process completed]`

Making it unusable because there does not seem to be a way to escape this.

Hi guys.
I'm sorry for my bad English.
I have a problem with ngrok on my kali machine. The strange fact is that two days ago it worked properly. After typing:
`ngrok http 80`
A link is generated. But the link works only in LAN. Over WAN it says "tunnel xxxxx.ngrok.io not found". 
I did some tests. I've got a triple boot PC (kali, macOS, Windows) and ngrok works properly only in Windows. I tried even another PC and ngrok works properly. In conclusion I think that it couldn't be a WiFi problem. Any ideas? I'm using the last version of ngrok (2.3.35)
I'm trying to use session authentication for my django application. When I connect the frontend app to the locally running backend server using the localhost address, the browser sets the cookies sent in the Set-Cookie header ( includes session_id and csrf_token ) and the user is able to authenticate himself. However, when I use an ngrok URL that points to the same server, the browser doesn't set the session_id and csrf_token cookies and the user is Forbidden ( 403 http response ) from accessing the protected endpoints.
