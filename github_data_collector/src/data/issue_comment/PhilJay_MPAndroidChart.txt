I have a LineDataSet Entry and I set a drawable to it, using fillDrawable, and an alpha, using fillAlpha, but fillAlpha doesn't work in conjunction with fillDrawable, only with fillColor

I would expect to set the drawable alpha by using the fillAlpha method, as it happens on iOs Charts using the same configuration

            final Drawable drawable = dataSet.getFillDrawable();
            if (drawable != null) {
                drawFilledPath(c, surface, drawable);
            } else {
                drawFilledPath(c, surface, dataSet.getFillColor(), dataSet.getFillAlpha());
            }

In more than one place we can find this kind of code, so the alpha has probably been ignored by design on the drawables. But it's not specified anywhere and it's not the expected behaviour.
I am not getting what's the order of Entries in pie chart? I have assigned a color array to the dataset in the order:
Array("-8272772","-94928272","-12148099","-9490099","-880099")

But when it creates the chart it assigns like:
Array("-880099","-94928272","-12148099","-9490099","-8272772")
So on which criteria it is shuffling up the entries.
How to solve the problem of that the MarkView was shown outside the screen? 
Man, wtf, how can i hide the stupid _PieEntry_ values from my _PieChart_.
**char.setDrawEntryLabels(false)** doesn't working. WHYYYYY?
I would like to set background color according to x-axis partition values in chart using together with line chart. Is there any way to set like this picture in android ?

I have a problem with the axis scales. In my graph my maximum values are as follows:
X axis: 1947.7872f
Y axis: 861.5f

In my graph (see image) the Y axis (maximum value 861.5f) should be smaller, because the maximum value on the X axis is larger (1947.7872f)

My code to make the graph is the following:

```
private fun setupLineChartData() {
        val yVals = ArrayList<Entry>()
        yVals.add(Entry(0f, 241.5f, "0"))
        yVals.add(Entry(162.3156f, 323.9f, "1"))
        yVals.add(Entry(324.6312f, 529.6f, "2"))
        yVals.add(Entry(486.9468f, 738.2f, "3"))
        yVals.add(Entry(649.2624f, 839.6f, "4"))
        yVals.add(Entry(811.578f, 860.8f, "5"))
        yVals.add(Entry(973.8936f, 861.5f, "6"))
        yVals.add(Entry(1136.2092f, 860.8f, "7"))
        yVals.add(Entry(1298.5248f, 839.6f, "8"))
        yVals.add(Entry(1460.8404f, 738.2f, "9"))
        yVals.add(Entry(1623.156f, 529.6f, "10"))
        yVals.add(Entry(1785.4716f, 323.9f, "11"))
        yVals.add(Entry(1947.7872f, 241.5f, "12"))

        val set1: LineDataSet
        set1 = LineDataSet(yVals, "DataSet 1")
        set1.color = Color.BLUE
        set1.setCircleColor(Color.BLUE)
        set1.lineWidth = 1f
        set1.circleRadius = 3f
        set1.setDrawCircleHole(true)
        set1.valueTextSize = 0f
        set1.setDrawFilled(true)


        val dataSets = ArrayList<ILineDataSet>()
        dataSets.add(set1)
        val data = LineData(dataSets)

        // set data
        lineChart.data = data
        lineChart.description.isEnabled = false
        lineChart.legend.isEnabled = false
        lineChart.setPinchZoom(true)    
        lineChart.xAxis.setLabelCount(13, true)
        lineChart.xAxis.labelRotationAngle = -90f

        val minXRange = 0f
        val maxXRange = 1947.7872f
        lineChart.setVisibleXRange(minXRange, maxXRange)

        lineChart.xAxis.position = XAxis.XAxisPosition.BOTTOM

    }
```

I want to have a 1: 1 scale so that the axes have the same real measurements.

What parameter could I use?
Hi, I want a feature in the chart for chart selection.
When I will select chart from left and from right then the portion which I have selected will show in another chart.

Is there any property for that? because I didn't find any property like that in MPAndroidChart.
Hi

I setup a piechart with 3 values.
2 values are smaller than the 3rd, they are placed close to one another and their labels are overlapping.

The thing is, if I rotate the pie **a tiny bit**, they are all good and readable. How can I make the pie rotate itself in a way, that all values/labels will be readable?
Thanks

@PhilJay I want to change marker-view drawable background for out of range values. How can I achieve it?
