Is is possible to expose customization options for the gestures, for example to change the default values for Hold from the current 400ms/650ms (depending where you read) to a lower or higher value?
I just want to know what is the file you are actually linking to your HTML/JS. I come across this all the time, the developers just expect you to know exactly what to do when installing. You have 3 folders and 6 files in the Quo download, but no indication anywhere on how it must be linked or how it works with Javascript. Do I link it in the html (Which ever file that may be), then just call it in my js file with the $$? Just some sort of indication of what goes where.
Why am I getting these errors when i try swipe? Chrome canary 54.0.2839.0

Hi! I have been using Quo and Lungo for an academic proyect and I can't figure out how the files from version 3.0.7 are imported in html. Can anyone please help me?

  I like quojs,and i want to use webpack + quojs ,but I found that quojs does not seem to support the use of webpack. Hope the author adds the support ，Thank you。

Seems that you can't bind multiple events to fire a function on an element.  This seems like a pretty standard need.  Here's my use-case...

``` javascript
$$('textarea').on('input propertychange change keyup paste', function() {
```

Gross workarounds required...

``` javascript
$$myText.on('keyup', myFunction);
$$myText.on('change', myFunction);
$$myText.on('input', myFunction);
$$myText.on('propertychange', myFunction);
$$myText.on('paste', myFunction);
```

HTML

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
<title>TITLE</title>
<meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1">

</head>

<body>
<input type="checkbox" name="" id="a"><label for="a">aaaaaa</label>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/quo.standalone.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

OS: WIN7
Browser:Chrome 45.0.2454.85 m

The checkbox#a cannot be checked by click on the label when use android mobile browser,
but PC's browser is ok.

why some android mobile phone can't use Swipe methods

Currently working on an android webapp, everything works fine on iOS but just started testing on Android lollipop but no click events is working... it works when i disable quoJS but i need the library to finish the app because the iOS version has already been published...anyone encountered same problem? please help

I don't understand - does this site has any sense without demo? http://quojs.tapquo.com/
It says about library which maybe is cool, though who will try it if they will need to deploy it?
It's much easier simply go to other site and find some demo, make sure library does what needed and then use it
