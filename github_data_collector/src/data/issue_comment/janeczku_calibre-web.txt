I am unable to send ebooks to my kindle using the my own smtp server.

- If I use the gmail smtp server, everything works fine
- My own mailserver works fine under thunderbird
- If I copy the thunderbird settings to calibre-web, it fails to send e-mails
- If I set the log level to debug to see what's wrong, the application crashes as soon as I send a test mail. (And the RAM usage spikes to up to 3 gb)

How can I fix this? Thanks for your help!
what im hoping to be able to do is create a new public book shelve called "For Kids" and assign a user to that shelve, so that user is only able to see/read what in the book shelve. i think adding something like this will make it more "kid friendly" seeing how my wife have a few romance books on the server that i would not like my kid be able to see/read.

I do no that there's the "Show mature content" option but seeing as most (if not all) "mature" books dont by default have a meta tag for that. its becomes a pain in a half to have to go behind my wife every time she adds a new book. so being able to lock them in a book shelve would help a lot with something like that.

P.S. bonus point if it also works via OPDS
Hi, 
With email accounts having attachment size restrictions and Amazon's Send to Kindle having a maximum limit of 50MB per email, it would be great if Calibre-Web could have the option to set a maximum file size for the Send to functionality. This would allow an admin to set a maximum Send to limit of 50MB and if a user selects "Send to Kindle" and the file is above the size limit, Calibre-Web instead displays an error message advising the user that the book is too big to send and will need to be downloaded and transferred manually to their Kindle. 

This would be an amazing feature as all my users read only on Kindle devices and exclusively use the Send to Kindle function, however there are some of my books are above 100MB like cookbooks or travel books. 
I'm uisng Calibre-Web behind Keycloak gatekeeper, as I do with most of my services.  When I try to visit the site, it redirects to keycloak then back to calibre-web.  But it throws a 500 error, something about not being able to decode the headers.

The problem is probably related to the cookie passed with the headers.  Other services like radarr/sonarr don't have an issue processing it, but I get the above error with calibre-web when this example token is passed.

Plugging it into base64 decoding says it has invalid characters, but I'm not sure which character.  However, since other services don't have an issue with it, I'm guessing it's something specifically with the base64 decoding process.
Adds a simple way of editing identifiers on a book.

Implementation remark: I tried to modify the `modify_database_object`, but it seems this function is clearly designed to manage fields that are a list of strings (author, tags, series, languages, etc.), and not key/value based fields.
In the end, I created a new function to avoid polluting the original function.
If you have some ideas on how to merge both "generic" modify_database_object and the identifiers one, I would be interested.

Note: this is my first "draft" pull request, I am very unsure of its consequences (I hope it is the same as "WIP" merge request on gitlab)
with admin/admin123 being default,  I have to change it once the site is up the first thing.

Is there an option to specify a custom account/password through cli parameter or env existing?   
Hello, I would like to offer you my update of the Russian translation, since the translation in this repository is outdated and partially missing. I did not find any mention of mail or feedback, so I write here. Thank you for the project anyway.
I decided not to create additional "issues" and add a few questions here, sorry if this is inconvenient.
1)In the guest user settings, you can configure the interface language, but when using the "guest" user, the English interface will always be displayed, can this be fixed?
2)In the user settings, you can enable the deletion of books, but I did not find a way to do this, after enabling this option ... can you help me with this?

Hi!

Just recently sending ebooks directly from Calibre to calibre-web (via copy function) stopped working. After upload (which in itself is working) the books are missing an opf file and calibre-web cannot parse file location or cover art (some other metadata is there though). When trying to delete the book from calibre-web I get the following error:

```

```
It is same issue I spend #522. But it works as same as what I explained to you.
I closed Calibre-Progrm when I modify metadata on calibre-web, but it doesn't apply to the real metadata on metadata.opf file in Calibre-library.

I am using Synology nas with docker(technosoft2000). and I added PUID, PGID following technosoft's instruction(because I think the problem is related to permission problem.).
But it doesn't work as same as before.

Below is my calibre-web.log file. It was an info level so it doesn't contain much information which we want but please look into them. and I changed it to debug level now.

#522
I have updated all book's meta data(tags, author, series, rating) and it works fine.

But after I tried to update metadata(description) for one book, I found that I can see any changes in calibre-web but it doesn't apply to Calibre-Library.

So after that, I tried to add new book to Calibre-Library. but it didn't work. Calibre-web didn't change anything even though I clicked 'Re-Connect to Calibre DB' in admin page.

So do you have any idea to solve this problem? If you need further information please let me know.
Would it be possible to add Epub <> Kepub converter to the docker container?
