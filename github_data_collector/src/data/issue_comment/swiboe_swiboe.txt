In your README you write "This is due to it's dependency mio not working on Windows". But in the mio repository it says:

> Currently supported platforms:
> Linux
> OS X
> **Windows**
> Android
> NetBSD

I have not tried mio on windows myself. I just saw this in your README and was wondering if this is intentional or if this is outdated information.

Cursor(s) controls the default location to insert and delete texts. It would be best if multiple cursors could be supported.

Do we need to specify different api version while calling rpc functions?

Some plugin may need specific configurations.. We should provide a location for these files.

Brainstorming goes here!!

I purchased swiboe.org - but it is only a redirect to one of my other pages right now.

Eventually this site should host the plugin list in an easy searchable manner - similar to crates.io or pip. But for the beginnings a static site that looks nice should do.

Rustfmt will remove any style discussions in the future by formating all code consistently. A script should be added to the code so that running rustfmt is easy. 

Maybe it can even be turned into a travis check, i.e. all code that rustfmt changes is invalid.

On reddit somebody yesterday suggested to support long presses for keymaps - which is a great idea imho. 

I am not sure if rustbox supports keyup events - otherwise we'd need to add that to it.

Swiboe uses priority to decide in which order RPCs from a selection will be run. Right now, lower priorities are run first which feels backwards to the usual way priorities are used: highest priority should run first.
