Compared to 0.9, I guess hyper dropped openssl dependency and made it a pure rust library.

I wonder when snatch will move on to hyper 0.11 and give an option to decide whether to use openssl. OpenSSL can potentially introduce security issue.

This will give users an option to use pure Rust binary.
Add sanity check for download byte size
On file creation the file name may exceed the length the OS file system allows. In this case the program currently hard panics could this be changed?
Hi, I like this tool! very cool!

It would be nice if snatch could provide a alternate progress bar like the `-a` option in tool `axel`. Because I will use `snatch -t40` or `-t50` to download big stuff, and the screen cannot fit all that many separated progress bars :)

Thanks!
It would be nice to know total download speed, as well as size of already downloaded content.
I got a file from someone to download a file from his dropbox account.

It's not easy to extract the exact link so I go the link that I was handed (with Firefox), click on "Download" combobox -> "Direct download" option, then I'm prompted to sign up, but I click on the small link that says "no thanks, take me to the download", and then Firefox starts downloading. Then I go to Firefox's download manager, locate the download -> right click -> Copy download link.

Then I go to the terminal and I get this error from snatch:

```
$ snatch --url https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/content_link/onXmWanH62azyJzz85nZe7mkv8kLr8PMPX71uXtmCW15vtnwBEV6iTra4DGuqhAI/file?dl=1
# Waiting a response from the remote server... OK !
[ERROR] Cannot get the content length of the remote content, from the server.
```

I've also tried to Pause or Cancel the download before I launch this command, but the result is the same (and yes, firefox allows me to pause and resume the download, and Firefox shows me the amount of bytes left, so no issue with the Content-Length header from the server I guess).
I tried to do a thread count of 4, and then a thread count of 64, and to the naked eye, for a small file, it seemed indistinguishable. What is the optimal thread count?
I love snatch but I have few notes regarding CLI.

- Remove `-u`, why not just `snatch http://example.com/bigfile.mp4` ?
- Optional `-f`, why not deduce filename from URL?
- Support for multiple URLs, something like `snatch http://example.com/a.mp4 http://example.com/b.mp4`
I think we should add a `--force` or `--true` flag to the CLI in order to allow integration of *snatch* into automated task (like installation scripts).
