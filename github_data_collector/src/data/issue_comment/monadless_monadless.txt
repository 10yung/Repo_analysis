The unsupported "return - only" test fails to compile with:

    return statement uses an exception to pass control to the caller of the enclosing named method t

Fixes #issue_number

#9

### Problem

Adding support for Scala 2.13

### Solution

- Changed build.sbt to cross build for 2.12 and 2.13
- Moved dependencies to later releases with 2.13 support
- Fixed various new warnings and upgraded uses of deprecated APIs

### Notes

The unsupported "return - only" test fails to compile with:

    return statement uses an exception to pass control to the caller of the enclosing named method t
