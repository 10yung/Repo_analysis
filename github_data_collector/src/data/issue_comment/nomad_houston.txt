If I understand correctly, Houston [still uses the binary protocol](https://github.com/nomad/houston/issues/170#issuecomment-536622006) instead of HTTP/2. [Apple announced](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=11042019a) it will stop supporting this protocol as of November 2020. 
Are there any plans for updating Houston to using the HTTP/2-based APNs provider API?
Hey all!
The new iOS 13 requires some new headers in the APNS so the pushes will work
`apns-push-type` & `apns-priority`
Otherwise the pushes won't work for iOS 13 + os

hey guys wondering what you are doing about the ios update for apns-push type header,

I'm not sure why this is happening but I'm not getting any response back just nil and no error message.
This [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23917593/296446) has a good explanation of this issue.

In the [houston docs](https://github.com/nomad/houston#silent-notifications) it says
> To send a silent push notification, set sound to an empty string ('')

Instead we can set the [apns-priority](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/CommunicatingwithAPNs.html) to 5

> Send the push message at a time that takes into account power considerations for the device. Notifications with this priority might be grouped and delivered in bursts. They are throttled, and in some cases are not delivered.

The default is priory 10 which is disallowed for silent push.

> Notifications with this priority must trigger an alert, sound, or badge on the target device

Which is why it's believed you need to send a sound to get silent push working.

From my testing using an empty sound string causes a vibration of the app.

I was able to send push successfully to device using command line. But it suddenly stopped working without any other changes as you can see in screenshot attached. is there any limitation that we can send only some number of notification during a time period or anything else. It happened to me several times.. sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't work.
Not sure the push isn't sent or isn't arriving or what.

I created a UNNotificationServiceExtension. The push arrived on one of the tries but stopped working after one success.

I removed the mutable_content flag and the push started to be delivered again as expected.

```
require 'houston'
token = "<67df32a7 8652e486 0d6c604d 4c4d88af 77233059 170d2d4c 2df4d882 36f5fca0>"

pem = "path/to/pushcert.pem"
pw = "1"

APN = Houston::Client.development
APN.certificate = File.read(pem)


# Create a notification that alerts a message to the user, plays a sound, and sets the badge on the app
notification = Houston::Notification.new(device: token)
notification.alert = 'sdakjfl'

# Notifications can also change the badge count, have a custom sound, have a category identifier, indicate available Newsstand content, or pass along arbitrary data.
notification.badge = 57
notification.sound = 'sosumi.aiff'
# notification.category = 'INVITE_CATEGORY'
#notification.content_available = true
notification.mutable_content = true
notification.custom_data = { foo: 'bar' }

# And... sent! That's all it takes.
APN.push(notification)
puts "Error: #{notification.error}." if notification.error

```
Firstly, thanks for the great library. It helped me a lot.

Last week, I had struggled with the push for 3 days. The iOS guys gave me new iOS certificates and ask me to update current certificates on server. Everything worked fine except that iOS app didn't receive the push. The `notification.error` was empty.

I investigated and figured out that the iOS certificate was a multi-topics one which contains 2 bundle ids for both staging and production environments. Unfortunately, `houston` doesn't support specifying `apns-topic` header, so I asked iOS guy to give a single-topic certificate and it worked like a charm.

I wonder if we should allow specifying bundle id so that library can work with multi-topics certificates.

Thanks.
As of iOS 8.2 you have the option to pass an title. I cant see that this is supported by Houston?
