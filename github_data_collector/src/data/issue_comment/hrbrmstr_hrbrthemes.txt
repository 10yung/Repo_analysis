Hi @hrbrmstr 

I've created a dark (FT-based) Roboto R markdown template called `FT` (based on the existing `ipsum` HTML template); perhaps this is useful for others as well so I've submitted a [PR](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes/pull/45).

It only works for HTML output (a dark PDF theme doesn't really make sense IMO).

Upon installation, it should show up as a template

`knit`ting then gives

- Added a new dark (FT-based) RMarkdown template (HTML output only)
- Updated DESCRIPTION, README.* and NEWS accordingly
- Renamed `R/ipsum.r` to `R/Rmd-templates.r`
Attempting to incorporate dollar axes using the `scales::dollar_format()` set of functions as a complement to:

 - `scales::comma_format()`
 - `scales::percent_format()`
I am trying to get PDF files using ggsave. PNG files work correctly and display the fonts I want to use like Roboto or Arial Narrow. But when I try PDF output using Acrobat Reader, the PDF file properties list RobotoCondensed being used, but the Actual Font as Adobe Serif.  See below

As you can imagine, it's pretty ugly!

What could be causing this?

One clue is something wrong with Acrobat Reader. I tried looking at the file with SumatraPDF and it showed Roboto Condensed output just fine. When I was working with a LaTeX compiler, the preview window also displayed the file with the correct font. But not Acrobat Reader. This is a problem, as Reader is the most common software for reading PDFs!

We are contacting you because you are the maintainer of **hrbrthemes**, which imports **ggplot2** and uses **vdiffr** to manage visual test cases. The upcoming release of **ggplot2** includes several improvements to plot rendering, including the ability to specify `lineend` and `linejoin` in `geom_rect()` and `geom_tile()`, and improved rendering of text. These improvements will result in subtle changes to your **vdiffr** dopplegangers when the new version is released.

Because **vdiffr** test cases do not run on CRAN by default, your CRAN checks will still pass. However, we suggest updating your visual test cases with the new version of **ggplot2** as soon as possible to avoid confusion. You can install the development version of **ggplot2** using `remotes::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")`.

If you have any questions, let me know!
Strip text on facetted plots is a *bit* hard to make out.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(hrbrthemes)
packageVersion("hrbrthemes")
#> [1] '0.6.0'

ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, hp)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~cyl) +
  theme_modern_rc() +
  labs(title = "Look, a plot",
       subtitle = "Something's off though",
       caption = "Wher's my strip text?")
```

Hi, 

Please help since I am unable to knit ipsum Roboto template.

```

I check the font link directly and it is fine.
