I feel like thematically, I'd really like it if `legit sync` also included `fetch --prune` since post-sync seeing branches that have actually been removed doesn't feel very 'synced' to me. (Otherwise I'm stuck always calling `git sync; git fetch --prune` and the main appeal of legit to me is to avoid having long git commands with a ton of options.)

(Yeah, I know I can alias this if I really want to.)
When i try to download the legit.exe from 1.0.1 release chrome stop downloading and Windows Defender warns about the file being malware.

Details in brazilian portuguese:

Is there a way to change the color legit is using for black? I know `allow_black_foreground` is a boolean to use either black (which doesn't show up on black bgs) or white (which blends in with regular text). I'd like to customize the appearance to be a 50% grey or something.
this is especially useful when working with github's hub (https://github.com/github/hub),
to submit a pull request:

    git clone git@github.com:kennethreitz/legit.git
	git checkout -b my_branch
	# code
	git commit -am "my changes"
	git fork
	git publish glehmann
	git pull-request
Explain usage.

"If a stash pop merge fails, Legit stops. I'd like to add checking for a merge failure, and undo the command with friendly error reporting."

what do you mean with "Legit stops"?

i think legit could grow some sort of submodule support -- perhaps `legit sync` would update all submodules? or maybe a dedicated command to work with submodules.
