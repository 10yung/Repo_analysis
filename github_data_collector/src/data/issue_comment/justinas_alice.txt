How would you use this if you want to use a middle per route/path? 
I'd like to offer an important addition to Alice: middleware chaining for `http.RoundTripper`s. We love Alice and use it for chaining `http.Handler` middleware. At the same time, working in a router area, we feel the same strong need to be able to chain `http.RoundTripper` middleware pieces (client-side) declaratively.

Fortunately, the mechanism of Alice can be easily extended to support `http.RoundTripper`. We thought that we would offer the PR to Alice instead of keeping it on our end. Let me know what you guys think. Thanks!
MiddlewareFunc defines a standard signature for a http.HandlerFunc which
accepts a chained http.Handler to invoke. ConstructorFunc supplies an
adapter for converting a MiddlewareFunc into a Constructor. This is most
useful for building middleware with bound parameters via closures.

After playing around with alice for a bit, I was wondering, might it be a good idea to provide a `Constructor` alternative whose signature is `func(http.HandlerFunc) http.HandlerFunc`? All my middleware are just handler functions, and so I have to do `http.HandlerFunc(myMiddlewareFunc)` before passing them into alice. This is not a big deal, but since there is also a `.ThenFunc` alternative to the `.Then` function to pass in the final handler, I was wondering if there is a reason not to provide the same flexibility for the middleware? I am not sure though what a good name for that alternative `Constructor` type would be since `ConstructorFunc` doesn't feel right to me.

`type Constructor func(http.Handler) http.Handler` is used for defining middleware functions, and is used as part of `New(constructors ...Constructor) {` this has caused some problems for me due to the lack of implicit type aliasing on sliced variadic parameters. example here: https://play.golang.org/p/5arBiRLckG
the issue i'm facing is that i'm writing a package where i'd like to users to be able to define a slice of func(http.Handler) http.Handler and not have to import alice in order to provide them. i know i can iterate and manually do the type conversion, and i'm doing that for now, but i figured i'd make this issue anyway just as something for you to consider.

Thanks
