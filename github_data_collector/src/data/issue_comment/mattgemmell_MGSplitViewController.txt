fix in ios8,with and height exchange error

There were a ton of issues on iOS 8 and most were fixed by this fork: https://github.com/asprega/MGSplitViewController

I did find an issue though. In portrait mode, if you had the master view open in the popover and rotated the device (in my case an iPad 2 running iOS 8) the master view would be created and then immediately go blank. What I found was that the popover was not getting dismissed first.

To fix this, I needed to go into the MGSplitViewController.m and move the lines:

```
if (_hiddenPopoverController && _hiddenPopoverController.popoverVisible) {
    [_hiddenPopoverController dismissPopoverAnimated:NO];
} 
```

from 
- (void)willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration

to the end of
- (void)willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration

So my solution looked like this:
- (void)willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration
  {
  [self.masterViewController willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:toInterfaceOrientation duration:duration];
  [self.detailViewController willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:toInterfaceOrientation duration:duration];
  
  //This fixes the iOS 8 rotation bug when the popover is present
  if (_hiddenPopoverController && _hiddenPopoverController.popoverVisible) {
      [_hiddenPopoverController dismissPopoverAnimated:NO];
  }
  }

I was going to post this in the issue board for asprega's fork, but I could not find it. So hopefully this will help someone save a couple minutes of searching.

1> Orientation Issues.
2> PopOver screen not looking proper.
3> Black screen occuring.

Please update the MGSplitviewController as per the iOS8 support

I want to have a Popover with a MGSplitViewController inside and the Orientation Landscape. But when i do that it does hide the Master-View and shows only the Detail-View. I need to have both display (Master & Detail).

I tried some settings and found that when i set  
showsMasterInPortrait = YES;
it shows Master & Detail together but the MGSplitViewController width is 768, but the Popover has a width of 1000px.

How can i fix that Issue ?

I wrote the Post already here with some detailed Informations (Pics, etc): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21754845/popover-with-mgsplitviewcontroller-inside-orientation-issue

Thanks

I think you should add another value to the enum. MGSplitViewDividerStyleNone so programmers don't have to have a split between their master and detail controller if they don't want too

I am using status bar in my app and wanted to maintain the compatibility between ios 6 and ios 7. I wanted status bar to behave same as ios 6. I don't want status bar to overlap view controllers while using MGSplitViewController.

Can any one please let me know how can i prevent MG SplitView to overlap status bar on view controllers.

By using the bestimmaa solution i was able to fix the view height issues, but still struggling to get status bar working.

Thanks.

Found an iOS7 only bug:
1. status bar is not hidden (in iOS6, it's hidden)
1. uncorrected UI for navigation bar item 

See attached

The static analyzer was complaining about some uninitialized values and whatnot.  So I cleaned them up with some default values.  Shouldn't change the behavior at all.

If you create another window which has top priority, rotate device and hide this window then UI will be squeezed.

Maybe try to use UIApplicationDidChangeStatusBarOrientationNotification to handle that bug and layout UI properly.
