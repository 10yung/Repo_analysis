## Steps to reproduce
If I open a VPN Connection with Wirequard for Andtroid (v0.0.20191220) Fenic crashes immediately.
After I close the VPN connection I can open Fenix with out crashes.

Please let me now if you need additional information from me.

### Device information
* Android device: Nokia 8, Android Version 9
* Fenix version: 3.0.2

## Steps to reproduce
Use Bulgarian language (not sure if it will reproduce in English).
1. Open YouTube Music app and select to buy student subscription. When you buy student subscription it will ask to open sheerId site where you will be checked to be a student. This opens as a WebView (don't know how it is called, but not the full Firefox Preview browser) . After confirmation you are redirected back to YouTube Music to pay. _The goal is really to open the YouTube Music payment page in the Firefox WebView, not Firefox Preview full browser._ If you can do this i don't think you would need to go through student buying and SheerId.
2. if you have an already entered card and try to pay, you enter your card security code, and the Blue buy button cannot be seen, unless you choose "open with Firefox Preview" from the menu.

### Expected behavior
The Blue "finish payment" button should be visible and not below the name if the opened page (bottom bar of Firefox WebView). The photo attached is from Firefox Preview full browser, so you can get the idea what button it is.

This blue button above is visible both when opened via Firefox Preview and Firefox WebView
### Actual behavior
The blue button is not visible when openen in Firefox WebView, it stays below the bottom bar with the site name/title. I didn't take a screenshot of it but couldn't get it to scroll so the button is visible.

### Steps to reproduce

1. open the address bar
2. start typing a domain
3. select an autocompleted domain

### Expected behavior

The website opens.

### Actual behavior

A search in the default search engine will performed.

It does not happen with all domains. I does happen with camp-firefox.de but not with mozilla.org. 

This has to be a recent regression because this was not an issue the last weeks.

### Steps to reproduce

1. close a tab
2. open another open tab while the "tab closed" snackbar is still visible

The snackbar stays visible. Pressing the "undo" link closes the snackbar (but does not execute the "undo" action).

This is a recent regression.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Tap on meatball menu button

### Expected behavior

Same speed/fluidity as on Fennec.

### Actual behavior

7 frames slower than Fennec.

Firefox for Android 68:

>Time from touch to menu visible: ~12 frames

Firefox Preview

> Time from touch to menu visible: ~19 frames

>The long animation on Preview makes it feel even slower than it is, but it's definitely much slower than FF68.

### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Currently, the Logins feature is Nightly-only, but we should turn it on for all users.

### What/Requirements
- [ ] #6704 Enable FxA state encryption for all users
- [ ] Enable Login management preference (View Logins) by removing Nightly flag
- [ ] When GV 74 becomes beta (2/10), enable Login Save and Autofill.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when Iâ€™m done?)
Dependencies are fulfilled, and logins are enabled for release users.
### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Switching to the -O2 flag has [pageload perf improvements](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1591725#c36), but increases apk size by ~6MB.

Need this experiment to measure tradeoffs.

### What/Requirements
- [ ] Stability experimentation on 3.2 1/22-1/27 w/ GV 74 Nightly
- [ ] A/B test on Firefox Preview Release (pending Phase 1): 1/27-2/14 w/ GV 73 Beta

This experiment would be run in staged rollout through Google Play, because Mako doesn't have this capability. Johan is assisting with this.
Corey from the Data Science team is involved in analyzing the results for retention.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when Iâ€™m done?)
Data Science has results that allow us to make a perf decision.
