Hi,

I'm using `passivedns` on a big chunk of traffic but it only uses one core and one process. Is there any way we can add threading or worker functionality to `passivedns`? I believe the choke point would be the log file being written on from all the different processes. Any ideas?

Cheers,

Can this program deals with big scale dns flow, like 1TB per day of bro dns logs? 
Hello,

I'm not sure if i'm missing something, or misunderstanding something but i have installed passivdns on an internal dns server (pi-hole) and i was hoping to see all the requests of the clients with passivedns. However, i'm only seeing the traffic the dns server itself is generating towards the upstream servers. I have tried to run it with a BPF filter, but then somehow nothing is being processed. The bpf filter itself is correct because i have check it with tcpdump and it is generating the correct results, as expected. 
(the filter used is: 'not src host <ipv6 addres> and not src host <ipv4 addres>  and dst port 53')

My theory is that the passivedns utility is only looking at outward dns request and not incomming? Is there a way to force to listen to traffic coming in?

any help is appreciated!
I have an issue with failed UPD packets, although the traffic looks good to me and Wireshark also:
- Transaction IDs match
- request/response is included in the traffic
- passivedns is the latest code available to date

Therefore I don't think this is similar to this issue: https://github.com/gamelinux/passivedns/issues/106

The pcap has been anonymized by dnswasher, however the original pcap has exactly the same results.

Any idea why the packets are failing?

Hello,

When sending mirrored traffic to passiveDNS it is not able to decode it. All DNS UDP requests appear as "failed". However if I try with normal (non mirrored) traffic in the same machine and the same compilation, it works fine. You can find next an example (traffic in enp4s0 is mirrored traffic and traffic enp3s0 is my usual network interface):

Do you know what could be happening?


It looks like it is working but it never logs anything.  I have a resolver running and my resolv.conf has nameserver 127.0.0.1 and lookups work fine but passivedns never sees anything.
I use tcpdump to collect the dns traffic between the local DNS server and hosts in our university(not include the dns traffic between the  local DNS server and upper DNS server) and store as pcap format.

I use passivedns1.0 to process the dns traffic. But there are some errors. Why the total DNS records allocated is zero? Whyï¼Ÿ

## What's all this then?

passivedns has been one of my favorite tools for DNS monitoring and has been in my toolbox for a number of years. Instead of maintaining this myself I figured I'd give back. 

Here's a `21.7 MB` alpine:3.6 container for passivedns.

I don't really have an opinion on default runtime options. I prefer to use passivedns as verbose as possible and let my logging pipeline handle any caching/duplication. This also helps keep memory usage low on kubernetes deployments.

Implementation of this container is up to the end user unless you'd like me to include a `docker-compose.yaml` or kubernetes deployment.

I haven't pushed this to dockerhub because, well, it's yours @gamelinux ðŸ˜„
