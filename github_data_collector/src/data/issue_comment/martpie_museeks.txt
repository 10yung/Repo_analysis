This changes the volume control position to the right side of the playback controls and makes it permanently visible. It also fixes the initial volume slider position.

I think it is better that way because you don't need an additional click for an pop-over and I did quite often want to advance a song but accidental hovered the volume icon and couldn't access the buttons underneath.

It fixes #351 and #465

Hi When create playlist and add song to playlist; It didn't show up on playlist (but you could play whole playlist) But when I restart the app I could see list of tracks in the playlist again.


[Existing cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/museeks.rb) needs to be auto updated on every release.

Also, adding a note in the README about cask availability will be helpful.


Hi! , I liked your app, and it will be better if you will add these features.

1. Add temp scaling (to nightcore all music).
2. Add auto-created folder-based playlists.
3. Add some small control bar when you hovering on the icon in the taskbar.
4. Add an option in setting to resize fonts.
Could you please add checksum for the release?
Hey, just downloaded this recently, it seems like a very nice music player!  One suggestion I have is to make a way to easily tell what song is playing without opening the player.  I've seen a few apps do this a few different ways; either by having a banner appear somewhere on the screen when the song changes, by showing what song is playing when the volume changes, or letting the user hover the mouse over the program and showing it as the title.

Thanks!
Shift + Down Arrow should select the current track and the track below it and so on for as many presses of the down arrow.

Prioritise keyboard shortcuts over mouse clicks. ðŸ’ƒ 
This is a long shot.
I have been getting hacked off with iTunes and have just migrated my library to Plex. Syncs great to my phone and all that Jazz but lacking in the Playlist making facilities and the desktop offline Sync.

I was slowly writing up a list of features I'd like a Music player to have, iTunes interface, simple easy simple.

Came across your project. Looks Simple and elegant. Perfect Music App!

Not sure if it'd be something you'd be interested in looking into.

I'm not even thinking of having all the management features integrated more just the offline Sync and Playlist making and editing - drag and drop style.

Where only the leftmost is actually responding to actions.
the volume control button needs to be tapped to show volume slider
which mutes sound
so need to press again to unmute
moreover, once the slider appears, the control buttons stay gone

best is to put the slider in place of the mute button
