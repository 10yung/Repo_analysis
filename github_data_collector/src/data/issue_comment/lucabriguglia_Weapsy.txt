When I upgraded the SDK to NETCORE 3.0, I encountered an error. The home / index.cshtml file in app will be compiled into index.cshtml.g.cs. Then it will report that the app namespace cannot be found

I like this project very much, but it's a bit simple as a CMS framework. When will your new version come out?

when running 1st time, it fails at SiteInstallationService.cs on line 180.  the **textModuleType** at line 174 was returned null. any idea how to fix this?
Also the description of this repository is too simple ,just "Weapsy is an ASP.NET Core CMS based on DDD and CQRS.",  is there any document about the framework and design idea？

I need a tutorial to be able to create a basic module.
Details coming soon..
