**please merge #18 and #19 before this**

This fixes #16 .

Implemented `./sharedocs package:docker` to build the official docker
container image, and implemented `./sharedocs publish:docker` to push the
official docker container image to Dockerhub.

In addition, modified `.travis.yml` to build/push the official docker container image automatically.

Note: To push the docker container image successfully, configuring env variable `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` are required on TravisCI.

The official container image repository is [sharedocs/sharedocs-standalone](https://hub.docker.com/r/sharedocs/sharedocs-standalone/), so changed `docker-compose.yml` to refer that.
**please merge #18 before this**

Added `setup` command to `sharedocs` script.
`./sharedocs setup` runs setup in one go, from creating database user to `./skinny db:migrate`.
