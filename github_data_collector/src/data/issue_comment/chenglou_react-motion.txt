We're using Motion in an image slider and all slides are duplicated when changing slides.
Here's a screenshot after interacting with the slider a few times. The slider starts with 5 slides wrapped in Motion components.

![Screen Shot 2019-12-30 at 11 35 53 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889536/71597567-9b101580-2af8-11ea-9772-654c63482e60.png)

Here's the implementation:
```
{items.map(
          ({ image, content, style, defaultStyle, imageClass }, index) => (
            <Motion
              key={image}
              defaultStyle={getDefaultStyle(index)}
              style={style}
            >
              {style => {
                return (
                  <div
                    style={{
                      transform: `translateX(${style.x}vw)`,
                      height: slideHeight,
                      maxHeight: slideHeight,
                    }}
                    className={classNames(
                      'carouselSlide',
                      classes.carouselSlide,
                    )}
                  >
                    <img
                      alt={image}
                      src={image}
                      className={classNames(imageClass, classes.image)}
                    />
                  </div>
                )
              }}
            </Motion>
          ),
        )}
```

*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add "no-prototype-builtins" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of "properties that must be enumerable".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the "lookup"-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

Add a GIF demo like this

![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6365230/66731033-55d83200-ee7f-11e9-894b-9d0b9cfb5310.gif)
I am using react-modal to create modals, and trying to slide the modal from bottom of page. For that i am trying react-motion TransitionMotion Component. My code is:
```
{ this.state.openNumberPopup &&
          <TransitionMotion 
            styles={[{key: 'key',style: this.getStyles()}] }
          >
            { (interpolated) =>
              <div>
                { interpolated.map(({ key, style, data }) =>
                <NumberPopup
                  key={`${key}-transition`}
                  style={{opacity: style.opacity,transform: `scale(${style.scale})`}}
                  openNumberPopup={this.state.openNumberPopup}
                  toggleNumberPopup={this.toggleNumberPopup}
                  handleChange={this.handleChange}
                  updateNumber={this.updateNumber}
                  disableSubmit={this.state.disableSubmit}
                />
                ) }
              </div>
      }
  </TransitionMotion>
}
``` 
where getStyles is
`getStyles = () => ({
    opacity: spring(1),
    scale: spring(1)
  });`
but this is not working because modal component.
The time returned by *performance-now*, which was used in `componentDidMount` and `componentWillReceiveProps` lifecycle functions to reset the animation, can be greater than the timestamp of `requestAnimationFrame` (*raf*) callback. Thus we got negative values for `timeDelta`. By initializing and resetting `prevTime` with null instead and setting it to to the timestamp of the first `requestAnimationFrame` callback, we can prevent negative values.

fixes #453
@nkbt : I appreciate you have made a clear statement about how much time you can spend on this project -- but I would like to ask if you could make a release.
Hello,

After updating `react` and `react-dom` to v`16.9.0`, this warning appears: 

```
react-dom.development.js:11494 Warning: componentWillReceiveProps has been renamed, and is not recommended for use. See https://fb.me/react-async-component-lifecycle-hooks for details.

* Move data fetching code or side effects to componentDidUpdate.
* If you're updating state whenever props change, refactor your code to use memoization techniques or move it to static getDerivedStateFromProps. Learn more at: https://fb.me/react-derived-state
* Rename componentWillReceiveProps to UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps to suppress this warning in non-strict mode. In React 17.x, only the UNSAFE_ name will work. To rename all deprecated lifecycles to their new names, you can run `npx react-codemod rename-unsafe-lifecycles` in your project source folder.

Please update the following components: Motion
```

According to https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/08/react-v16.9.0.html#renaming-unsafe-lifecycle-methods, the `componentWillReceiveProps` is now deprecated and will be removed from the API on the next major version.
