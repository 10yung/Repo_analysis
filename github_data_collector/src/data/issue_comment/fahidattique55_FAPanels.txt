I can't understand why we are obligated to change the AppDelegate, there are no better solution for this?
I mean, most applications need a first login storyboard and only after opens a main view with probably a UITabController.
Your solution looks no much flexible for most of us.
Hi,I used xcode 11, ios 13, to create a new project, run it on the device, and encountered an error. Projects created in Xcode10 will not be encountered using FAPanels.
Xcode helped me locate it here.

> let rootController: FAPanelController = window?.rootViewController as! FAPanelController

> error: launchOptions = ([UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]?)	nil
Application crashed due to shuffled function in boxFade and dumpFall animation.

Generate Error: Multipleclick on table view row. It is increasing UIImageview in an array and it will generate a crash.

I implemented the menu in my app the center View is a TabbarController.
I open the menu I click on an item I go to the view and then I want to return to the main view popViewController and popToRootViewController does not work.
what to do ?
in my app it's based on a black background so I use status bar style = .light when I implement the FAPanels it's always black.
 I am using the latest FAPanels Pod

I tried setting  
```
override var preferredStatusBarStyle: UIStatusBarStyle {
        return .lightContent
    }
```

and 
`setNeedsStatusBarAppearanceUpdate()`

and this issue persists 
**How to fix this issue?**
I want to open the menu on child pages, but it only works on the center viewcontroller. Cannot change center. panel always nil
Hi all,

I would like to add FAPanels Left Side Menu into my iOS app, which already have WebView (Loaded with a website) in the app.

After added successfully, I tried to right slide from screen, as per below:

In the end, it will trigger FA Panels left side menu as well as website own side menu too. In total 2 side menus are displayed on my iOS app.

Expected Behaviour (1 Side Menu):

Actual Behaviour (2 Side Menu - FA Panels Side Menu on top of WebView Side Menu):

Is there any ways to set any hand gesture will always trigger only FA Panels Side Menu (on top of WebView)?

Thanks.

I don't get it from readme.
 SWIFT_VERSION '5.0' is unsupported, supported versions are: 3.0, 4.0, 4.2. (in target 'FAPanels')
I have just added Swift 5 toolchain in xcode 10.1
