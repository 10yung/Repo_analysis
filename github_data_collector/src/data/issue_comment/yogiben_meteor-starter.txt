Hi, I'd like to change this little thing: I'd like that once the user has done the sign-up, he goes directly to the profile page and force him to insert information in the page.
But I can't find the sign-up file so I can't redirect the user from the sign-up to the profile page....
Could you help me?
Simple update.
Dashboard > Picture > choose file is doing nothing. no file select dialog box...
Normalized the URL, fixed HTTP/HTTPS problem, configured FB/Twitter/etc
logins, setup the dev.json file
I install it normally, and then ..

Hi,

I am having trouble changing the language to Chinese. I have tried modifying the _config.coffee file in /lib/_config such as
`# Localisation
	defaultLanguage: 'zh-CN'
	dateFormat: 'D/M/YYYY'`

as well as the i18n.coffee file in /lib/_config such as 

`
Meteor.startup ->
  if Meteor.isClient
    if Config.defaultLanguage
      TAPi18n.setLanguage Config.defaultLanguage
    else
      TAPi18n.setLanguage('zh_cn')`

Is there somewhere else that I need to set this config?
how can i disable auth logins?
Fixes #117 

Hello, 

[meteor newby's lines below]
First, vainilla package is working as expected. My problem is hacking it, because I've poor meteor knowledge. Well, let's try:

I'm trying to add a new collection like the Posts one, only different fields and I'm receiving a error message on submit the form: 

errorClass {error: 403, reason: "Access denied", details: undefined, message: "Access denied [403]", errorType: "Meteor.Error"}

I've edited:
1. Added the file plans.coffe with same estructure as post with diferent field names.
2. Modified views->dashboard.html with the template for Adding a Plan (same as posts with diferent id)
3. Modified allow.coffee with same structure as Posts.allow
4. Modified lib->router->main.cofee adding the subscribe line for 'plans' same way as 'posts
5. Added in i18n->en.i18n.json the en translations for autoforms fields.

No way, posts is working normally but autoforms plans says 403. Any hints?

Just cloned the repo from master and I started the app, getting the following error 

```

Couldn't find a template named "homeLayout" or "homeLayout". Are you sure you defined it?

```

Did not change any files yet, what can I do?
