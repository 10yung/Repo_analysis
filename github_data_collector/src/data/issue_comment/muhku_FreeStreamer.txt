While this project is pretty under the radar, and is kind of in maintenance mode, I've found this to be a perfect example of a bunch of people making small fixes and tweaks to a really useful codebase over time.  Thanks to @muhku for building it, and for everyone for all the updates over the years.

Please add support for swift package manager as soon as possible.

ex: i attach access token "token_1" in initial request. if my stream is too long, some time stream is time out and rerequest to server, in between my token is change to "token_2", now how i can attach this new token to current stream and start request.


what i try is:
```
        let config = FSStreamConfiguration()
        config.predefinedHttpHeaderValues = ["access_token": "token_1"]
        player = FSAudioStream(configuration: config)
        player.play(url)
```

AccessToken refresh("token_2") event:

player.configuration.predefinedHttpHeaderValues = ["access_token": "token_2"]

result in rerequest is it take old token "token_1"



add support for volume fading

Ex: For swift

```
extension FSAudioStream {
    /// Fade player's current volum to one (max)
    /// - Parameter completion: call when volume rich to maximum value
    @objc
    func fadeIn(completion:(() -> Void)? = nil) {
        if self.volume < 1 {
            self.volume += 0.1
            DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.1) {
                self.fadeIn(completion: completion)
            }
        } else {
            completion?()
        }
    }
    
    /// Fade player's current volume to zero (min)
    /// - Parameter completion: call when volume rich to minimum value
//    @objc
    func fadeOut(completion:(() -> Void)? = nil) {
        if self.volume > 0.1 {
            self.volume -= 0.1
            DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.1) {
                self.fadeOut(completion: completion)
            }
        } else {
            completion?()
        }
    }
}
```
If our audio is encrypted audio, can we play encrypted audio on the client? Where to add audio decryption?
The stream startup watchdog activated: stream didn't start to play in 5 seconds
