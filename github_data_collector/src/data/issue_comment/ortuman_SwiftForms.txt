when i custom the cell, i implement the class FormBaseCell and override the function configure() and update(), also a variable named myImage as type UIImageView was defined in it. However, it raises an error "this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key myImage." while setting the property 'myImage' in FormViewController class using 'row.configuration.cell.appearance = ["myImage.image": UIImage(named: "Photo") as AnyObject]'. What should i do ?

I'm configuring the picker with array values like this:

`row = FormRowDescriptor(tag: Static.picker, rowType: .Picker, title: "Value")
row.configuration[FormRowDescriptor.Configuration.Options] = array.count
row.configuration[FormRowDescriptor.Configuration.TitleFormatterClosure] = { value in

   var stringArray = [String]()
   for index in 0...self.array.count {
      // append index with cast it to string
       stringArray.append(String(index))
   }
   return stringArray
   } as TitleFormatterClosure`

however I get an error
"Cannot convert return expression of type '[String]' to return type 'String!'" Why does this happen?
- fix FormTextFieldCell crash when titleLabel is being modified by the cell appearance
Plans to upgrade time?
swift 5.0
Crash in FormViewController  line 136 (SwiftForms to 1.8.2 version, Xcode 10 and swift 4.2)

The only way for me to keep working with SwiftForm: remove the 'titleLabel.font' key from
`row.configuration.cell.appearance = ["textField.placeholder" : "Mandatory" as AnyObject, "textField.textAlignment" : NSTextAlignment.right.rawValue as AnyObject, "titleLabel.font": UIFont.boldSystemFont(ofSize: 15.0)]`
I don't have the font I'd like but it works!
Would appreciate an update to the latest release
Hi there,

I'm here to report a matter :

The upload class "FormSection" from pod install got these lines : 
```
public var headerViewHeight: CGFloat = UITableView.automaticDimension
 public var footerViewHeight: CGFloat = UITableView.automaticDimension
```
Which have to be replaced by 
```
public var headerViewHeight: CGFloat = UITableViewAutomaticDimension
public var footerViewHeight: CGFloat = UITableViewAutomaticDimension
```

As the correction take three sec with "unlock" and replace it with the proposal, i guess that no report of this problem have been made (or I didn't seen the topic, by bad if so)
But it could be great if this could be add on the pod package =) 


Have a nice day and thanks a lot !


Why your textfield cell can auto scroll keyboard top,could you please tell me the reason?Because i want to create a custom popview.
Assuming a screen where 2 picker views are far from each other, 
- Set the value for the first picker view 
- Scroll to the second one

The value label of the second picker has the same text of the first one. This is caused by not emptying the value label after the cell reuse.
