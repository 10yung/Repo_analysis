Feature request for automatically positioning the attachment based on available space.  
The option could be `attachment: 'auto'` or `attachment: 'auto auto'` for fully automatic positioning.  
Or for finer control `attachment: 'auto left'` to position the attachment on the left but depending on available space shift between `top`,  `middle` and `bottom`.
We can then use this util in Shepherd as well for tetherOptions
There is at least one spot we are trying to support jQuery selectors. We should remove that in favor of native DOM.

@TrevorBurnham do you think it would be possible to get tether.io transferred to us as well? As we iterate, we will want to update docs.
Hi,

I found a weird issue while using tether in combination with content in iFrames.

If you have clickable content in iFrames and are using an iPhone, the click event don't trigger because the binding of the touchmove event:

```
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && typeof window.addEventListener !== 'undefined') {
    ['resize', 'scroll', 'touchmove'].forEach(function (event) {
      window.addEventListener(event, tick);
    });
  }
```

You need to hold at least 250ms on the button to execute the event because of this:

```
if (typeof lastDuration !== 'undefined' && lastDuration > 16) {
      // We voluntarily throttle ourselves if we can't manage 60fps
      lastDuration = Math.min(lastDuration - 16, 250);

      // Just in case this is the last event, remember to position just once more
      pendingTimeout = setTimeout(tick, 250); // this is the problem
      return;
    }
```

Could someone please look into this?

Best regards
