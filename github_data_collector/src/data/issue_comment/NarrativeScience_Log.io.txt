Each log line on the user interface is prefixed with node name and stream name, in my case`apache application_server`, since I am monitoring the logs of a single app on my server, it does not make much sense for me. Wondering if there is a way to disable this presentation of logs. 
title says it :)
Hi! I've discovered Log.io today and though I like it a lot I'd like it to have a timestamp on every message. Would that be a good feature for the upcoming versions? 
Cheers!

When I access log.io using `example.com:28778` everything works normally.  
When redirecting using a VirtualHost log.io spams the following get to apache:

---

xxx.xxx.xxx.xx - - [16/May/2015:14:09:32 +0200] "GET /socket.io/1/xhr-polling/qHi9If0rVuPfT7LC_nWS?t=1431778171345 HTTP/1.1" 200 482 "https://logio.example.com/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_3) AppleWebKit/600.5.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/8.0.5 Safari/600.5.17"

My VirtualHost configuration looks like this:

---

```

Does anyone know whats going on? Do i need some kind of mod_rewrite?

Due to the geographic location of my server, i'm unable to open any ports other then 80,443 to bypass this problem.
I currently have a socket.io application running on this server, and would like to use log.io to view the existing application log files.
I am able access log.io's http server using NGINX reverse proxy. (using this method: https://github.com/NarrativeScience/Log.io/issues/142 )

But the socket.io route is conflicting with the existing socket.io application.
Whats the best way to change the socket.io resource: / path: on both the server and client of log.io?
I've done some experimentation and managed to change the client browser JS path from log.io.js, but im not sure if this is the best method?
Any information would be appreciated.

I have a web-server. For me it could be handy to deploy the logging under something like `http://host/_logs`. It could be nice if I could configure that path in log.io settings

I think it would be nice to have an option to display \n & \t as newline & tab. 

Hello, 

Is there a way to predefine the highlighting of certain logs based on a particular syntax/regex ? 
I want to see my error logs in red color, warn in yellow and so on ....

Thanks.
