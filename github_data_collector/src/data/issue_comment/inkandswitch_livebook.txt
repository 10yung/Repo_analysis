1. use an expires header on most static asset in the pypyjs codebase since those almost never change
2. use etags or a short expire for generated worker/notebook.js plus css files to avoid issues where files change
3. look into http2 pipelining?
4. figure out why cloudflare isn't caching the .py files - currently set to cache everything :-/ 

Transition animation causing legend to fly in from the left, let's remove.

Reproduce:
1. welcome notebook
2. comment out any of the plot lines

When typing a statement into a new code cell, it's common to see "xyz undefined". The current error is a little verbose, would like to change from:

```
exceptions.NameError: global name 'abc' is not defined
```

to:

```
'abc' is not defined
```

Steps to reproduce:
1. welcome notebook
2. change "data.head()" to "data.descri"

Dev console output:

```

In the particular case of the welcome notebook data, trailing zeros should be formatted so that dataframe is narrower: 

<img width="607" alt="screen shot 2016-02-03 at 15 13 59" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4469749/12784699/f0953bb8-ca88-11e5-8d5d-b9f722a8f89f.png">

(may affect scatter and line plots too)
When plotting float numbers with many digits after decimal comma, they should be formatted to a few significant figures to avoid broken formatting. Format to {0:.2f}.

Steps to reproduce:
1. welcome notebook
2. down arrow x 2
3. cmd-up arrow
4. Now cursor is on title but highlight & avatar remains on "Live coding"

Would be great if the sample notebook used Livebook's quote capability to turn this:

Into this:
