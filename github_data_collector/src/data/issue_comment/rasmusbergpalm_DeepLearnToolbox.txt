Hi there, I am trying to use SAE for a small data set. After the training process, how can I use the trained SAE for my data set?
For example, in Matlab, _trainAutoencoder_ command is used for training the encoder and then _encode_ command is used to encode the data. Which command should I use here, after the SAE training process?
Hi guys,
I'm trying to build a DeepLearning network which contains a subtraction operation between two layers, and I can't find a way to do that while MATLAB has just an addition operation (additionLayer)?
for more clarification, the equation below discribes the step that I should do:
C = X - AvgPooling(X)
 any suggestions guys?


I am trying to find the dbnsize.m function to execute the dbnsetup code. The function is missing from the source code.
Any help in executing the code is appreciate.
is it possible to add fully connected layer in a CNN architecture? now I understand that only the last layer of a CNN can be fully connected with prelayer.
I use DBN for the classification of bearing fault data sets at Case Western Reserve University. The data set includes 10 failures, but the final classification result is always a category. When you modify various parameters of the network in  nnsetup.m, the result will change accordingly. For example, when you change nn.learningrate to 1, the classification will change from 1 to 4. Many people have encountered this problem, but No suitable solution was found. Sincere hope that someone can help me
there is a line in test_example_CNN.m that says "rand('state', 0)". When I looked it up on MATLAB, it is discouraged to use it. Instead, "rng(0)" is recommended. But when I used "rng(0)" and varied my kernel size, the error rate is vastly differently from using "rand('state', 0)". Is every generator other than "twister" flawed? Does that mean the result that "state" generator gives is also flawed?
I have a question. I want to transplant a simple LSTM adder, or a simple LSTM regression model to the simulink. Could you please tell me if there are any specific examples?
Iâ€˜ve met an error in running 'test_example_CNN' with my own trainning data
the code is as below:
%%
error in using cnnsetup (line 30)
Layer 3 size must be integer. Actual: -1         4623.5

error with test_example_CNN (line 36)
cnn = cnnsetup(cnn, train_x, train_y);
%%

The structure of original data is: 
train_x: 28*28*60000 double
train_y: 10*60000 double
test_x: 28*28*10000 double
test_y: 10*10000 double

While my own data structure is:
train_x: 2*9251 double
train_y: 1*9251 double
test_x: 2*1631 double
test_y: 1*1631 double

So what should I do now? Should I modify my data or the code?
Hi, I have a problem for the NN & CNN. Please help me! One row of the sample data MNIST indicates as a handwritten numeral. Each handwritten numeral is a gray image (one band). But my training datas are lots of RGB images (three bands). How can I use NN & CNN for RGB images?
