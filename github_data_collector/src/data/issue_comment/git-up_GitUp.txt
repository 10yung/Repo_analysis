When going into the diff view (hitting space on commit in the map view) the left side has the full commit message but the links aren't clickable (hyperlinked). It would be nice if I could simply click on the link rather than having to manually select it and paste it into a web browser.

Let's make it both selectable and clickable!
GitUp is a great deal better than the git CLI for most things, but these menu options can be difficult to use when there are many branches.
- Rebase onto
- Set Upstream to

In one of the projects I'm involved in, the list of branches is almost three times the height of my display.  The fact that the names are not alphabetized increases frustration.  Topping it off, the branches appear in a different order for rebase-onto than for set-upstream-to, so there's no getting used to it.  For rebase-onto, I see d*, q*, o*.  For set-upstream-to, I see o*, d*, q*.

Issue #215 requests popping up a filtered list to find branches.  I think that that kind of interaction would probably work well for these operations too.

I also notice that stale branches appear in these menus even when the map view is configured to hide stale branches.  I'm not asking to change that aspect, but I would understand if someone else were surprised by it.
On quite  a few projects we have commit hooks running multiple steps (linting, code formatting, tests) but when committing gitup just kinda freezes, having a stream of the output would make it feel more responsive and give a better idea of how long might be left.

Being able to do other actions such as look at the tree view while waiting would also be great!
Hello, after using GitUp consistently for the past three years, one thing that I have always wanted was the ability to have the last committed message restored in the commit message textbox on undo of committing something.

I often accidentally commit something to master with a well written long form commit message and realize that I should have switched branches first or committed to origin/master and used "git witch -c". After I realize my mistake I hit ctrl z and the commit is undone and all of my staged  changes are restored, but my glorious and well written commit message is lost and must be rewritten.

I propose that on undo of a commit the message should remain, this would also be very useful for modifying a messed up commit message.
This is more of a feature request. When I'm in the Commit View, after committing I have to go back to the Map View to push. I'd love for the keyboard shortcut to be active in this view. Also, if there was a Commit & Push command, that would be amazing.

Thanks,
GW
The toolbar icon for Map View looks like a pair of handcuffs.  Just sayin'. ðŸ˜„ 

Adding another node or edge would solve the problem, in my view.
I have a (bare, not sure if that matters) repo with a [Keybase Git](https://keybase.io/docs/git/index) remote. I am unable to fetch from or push to this remote in GitUp because I get this error:

> Failed connecting to "origin" remote: failed to resolve address for keybase: nodename nor servname provided, or not known

The remote URL is `keybase://private/j_f/dotfiles` and I have `git-remote-keybase` installed and on my PATH.

Is there any way to fix this?
In order to use the latest functions and fix some issues we need to update the gitlib2 library.
It would be lovely to include a quick shortcut to open the entire local repo folder with a preferred editor.
I've got this in ~/.gitconfig:
```text
# always push with ssh
[url "git@github.com:"]
  pushInsteadOf = https://github.com/
  pushInsteadOf = git://github.com/
```
It yields this for one of the projects I'm working on:
```text
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/DanEble/LilyDev.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:DanEble/LilyDev.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/fedelibre/LilyDev.git (fetch)
upstream	git@github.com:fedelibre/LilyDev.git (push)
```
The problem I have is that when I try to push the local branch `master` to the remote branch `origin/master`, GitUp prompts me to authenticate for HTTPS.

The way I'm trying to push is through the menus:
1. click on `master` in the graph
1. Edit Local Branch "master" â–¶ï¸Ž
1. Push to Remote â–¶ï¸Ž
1. origin

The first prompt is "Are you sure you want to...", and I click "Push Branch."  That's fine.

The next prompt is the problem.  The window title is "Authentication Required" and the URL shown is the fetch URL rather than the push URL (see above).

After attempting to push with GitUp, I ran `git push origin master:master` in a shell, which worked fine.
