Hello! I have a System where the users need to sign in, and I'm trying to set the chat's id to the same as the user's uuid, so that the user never loses the conversation history, even when switching browsers or devices. I saw that there is a SSO plugin that was developed, but I am still unsure if this is the right solution for the case. Also, I am unsure if it is still compatible with the most recent version of LHC. Do you have any advice on how I should tackle this issue?

Hi,

I want to enable clamav virus scan on the files that a user uploads. I've enabled the scanner in the Files Configuration.

The livehelperchat is installed at /var/www/chat/. I've installed clamav and clamav-daemon using apt-get. Both the clamav-daemon and clamav-freshclam services are now active on my server. The socket file path is /var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl.

Now, when I upload a file, the socket method tries to make a socket connection (using socket_connect) and I get a "No such file or directory" error. I think socket_connect's 2nd param accepting a unix path is getting the /var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl value, but the socket_conecction is expecting the path under /var/www/chat/ resulting in /var/www/chat/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl.

How can I make it to use the root->/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl?

Should I install clamav via source for this to work?
Hello

I use session_start etc on various pages and directories.

When I embed code, i the javascript doesn't run.

"\livehelperchat-master_VENKY/lhc_web/lib/core/lhcore/lhsys.php at line 301ini_set(): A session is active. You cannot change the session module's ini settings at this time

So, 2 questions: where can i set  error level reporting? Can i set it at the directory level in .htaccess or do I have to do more inside some PHP files? (settings.ini.php doesn't seem to have it)

And more importantly, for sessions: how do i tackle this? 

Thanks again!

On Firefox when the mouse is up to thumbs up and down has not the correct pointer.
The pointer is not the hands but the input icon.

How to reproduce:
From Firefox start a chat than when chat is accepted and you have thumbs up and down go with the mouse over and cannot see mouse pointer to be correct.
Is it possible to stop the html tags being stripped from additional data sent? Can't find where this is happening in the code. 

Ideally, I'd like to add a new variable type "HTML" and only prevent tags being stripped for those of that type;

Any advice how to go about this?


Hi, I want have purchase during the chat or even before chat starts. What can I do? Anyone can help?
We were getting errors because some urls are larger than 250 characters. Increasing the size of varchar from 250 to 500 on lh_chat_online_user_footprint.page in the database fixes the error. Http spec allows for urls to be a maximum of 2048 characters. I think this should be the limit. Could this get changed? A simple schema update would do it.

`ALTER TABLE lh_chat_online_user_footprint MODIFY page varchar(2048) NOT NULL;`
Hi,
I would like to know if is it possible to set an api call to an external service inside a lhc bot.
For example I would like to set a trigger for any chat event (start, new message, new file, close ecc), and then suddenly send a request via POST (with all chat info and parameter), wait for a response and then make the bot to execute an action based on the obtained value.

Thank's in advance




If I chat within Telegram bot, there is no notification comes if client closed the chat. Is it possible to realize this feature? Or maybe I should make some changes in code?
