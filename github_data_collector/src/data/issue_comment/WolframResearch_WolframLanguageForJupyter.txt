Executing

MathLink`Synchronized::noshare: -- Message text not found --

WriteString["stdout","Hello world!"]
```

Hello, first I want to thank you for this package. My question is: Do you plan the interactive plots -- at least the possibility to rotate the 3D plot?


This intends to fix an issue brought up in #74.
Some issue with exponents in the output.
Try for example:
`n=5.*10^12;`
`n*Range[20]`
This branch disables rasterization and improves support for special characters when running `WolframLanguageForJupyter` under `jupyter-console`.



When I use the Wolfram Language method, after I input ConfigureJupyter["Add"]
ConfigureJupyter::notfound
Jupyter installation on Environment["PATH"] not found.

When I use Wolframscript, after I input jupyter kernelspec list
it returns jupyter kernelspec list

I use a macOS 10 Catalina system with anaconda. How should I add path?   Thanks a lot!
