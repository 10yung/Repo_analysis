I am getting this error when I try to upgrade laravel 5.8.* to 6.0.* version. 
Installation request for laravel/framework ^6.0 -> satisfiable by laravel/framework[v6.0.0, v6.0.1, v6.0.2, v6.0.3, v6.0.4, v6.1.0, v6.2.0, v6.3.0, v6.4.0].
Please update the readme to show that the repo is no longer maintained and supply suggestions e.g. [spatie/laravel-permissions](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission)
Updated all dependencies, migrations template and whole package in general in order to work with Laravel >=6 version.
This error is thrown when someone tries to run `php artisan entrust:migration` command.

Method Zizaco\Entrust\MigrationCommand::handle() does not exist

Way around it has been to edit `vendor/zizaco/entrust/src/commands/MigrationCommand.php` and change `public function fire()` to `public function handle()`


Argument 1 passed to Illuminate\Auth\EloquentUserProvider::validateCredentials() must be an instance of Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable, instance of App\User given, called in C:\composer\project\vendor\laravel\framework\src\Illuminate\Auth\SessionGuard.php on line 378


Consider the following case:

I am going to delete a $user which has a relation to a record in the `tickets` table.

The tickets relation looks like:
```
`tickets`
user_id ON DELETE RESTRICT
```

This means that if I would delete the associated user (just regular `$user->delete()` through eloquent), the query should fail because of an "integrity constraint violation", which is what happens and is expected.

However, the `role_user` record of the user is deleted even though an exception is thrown because of the `tickets` relation. The role_user relation looks like this:
```
`role_user`
user_id ON DELETE CASCADE
```

The code in question seems to be this line:
https://github.com/Zizaco/entrust/blob/master/src/Entrust/Traits/EntrustUserTrait.php#L91

This adds a `static::deleting()` to the user model, which in this case tries to remove all associated roles for this user, although that in itself should be logic related to the database (like InnoDB).

Note that a similar issue also occurs in:
https://github.com/Zizaco/entrust/blob/master/src/Entrust/Traits/EntrustRoleTrait.php#L94
https://github.com/Zizaco/entrust/blob/master/src/Entrust/Traits/EntrustPermissionTrait.php#L32

I am assuming that this is a fix for `MyISAM` engines (since these dont support foreign keys if im correct ?). I personally am using `InnoDB`.

**Solution 1:** maybe change the event listeners from `static::deleting` to `static::deleted` so that on a transaction level it keeps functioning as well? I havent tested this change yet.

**Solution 2:** remove the event listeners if the engine is InnoDB, and ensure correct `ON DELETE` settings for the database tables (which seem to be correct https://github.com/Zizaco/entrust/blob/master/src/views/generators/migration.blade.php )



In **the Checking for Roles & Permissions** section
I think you made a small mistake in your comments!
$ user-> hasRole (['owner', 'admin'], true); // false, user does not have admin (true: Owner) role
Do I think right?

I'm using Laravel 5.8 and package version "zizaco/entrust": "5.2.x-dev". When attaching permission to role in the way shown below cache is not updated until i fire: "php artisan cache:clear"
For Caching i'm using redis.
I have other Laravel project v5.6 and everything just work fine.

$role = Role::find($role_id);
$role->attachPermission($permission);
