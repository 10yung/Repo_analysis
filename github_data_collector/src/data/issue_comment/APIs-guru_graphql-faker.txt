Currently I don't know how to use it as a module.

So I have to use `json-graphql-server` instead.

Would be cool to see a middleware module that would work like this:

```js
import gql from 'graphql-faker'

// ...
app.use('/graphql', gql())
```

That will read a graphql file and handle it.

The reason I need API for is because I want to deploy a fake API
Is there a way to provide a way to match a variable?

The goal is to pass a search string and return partially matched items, that were specified by `@examples(values: [...])` array.

e.g.) I'd like to return values matching `react` in the `name` field

It seems like we can provide only one schema file. Is there a way to provide multiple?
Now supports both HTTP and HTTPS.  Allows testing with software that doesn't allow insecure HTTP communications.

Added:
- bool param to enable https. Default is http, same as before.
- path to the TLS cert
- path to the private key for the TLS cert
- path to the issuing CA cert. This could be enhance in the future to allow multiple certs.
- param to pass in hostname for server URL. This was added because the URL hostname must match the cert hostname.

This is not an issue exactly. But I just wanted to thank you for building this amazing project that has just saved me many hours!! Thank you!

I use a custom path `/api/graphql` (for various reasons) for my apps and would like to set the path using a cli flag. I can send a PR.
Current style of providing example values through annotations have some serious limitations:

- As the examples are tightly bound with the schema definition, it is not possible to use schema files generated by another tools.
- Sometimes constraints for fake data would be useful (and by my opinion should be defined along with the examples). For example, in our GQL API we receive an array of objects from server, where all object should have a unique key value.
- Latest version of GraphQL plugin in PHPStorm is completely broken when using a schema file with `@examples` annotations.

A programmatical way of providing examples or generating fake data using some constraints would be very useful. Or, isn't there some undocumented way how to do that with current version?
