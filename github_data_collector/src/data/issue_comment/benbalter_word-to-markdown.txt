> One of the biggest changes in bundler 2.1.0 is that deprecations for upcoming
> breaking changes in bundler 3 will be turned on by default. We do this to grab
> feedback and communicate early to our users the kind of changes we're intending
> to ship with bundler 3. See
> [#6965](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6965).
> 
> Another important improvement is a better coexistence between bundler
> installations and the default copy of bundler that comes with ruby installed as
> a default gem. Since bundler is shipped as a default gem with ruby, a number of
> users have been affected by issues where bundler ends up failing due to version
> mismatches, because at some point of the execution, bundler switches to run the
> default copy instead of the expected version. A number of PRs have been focused
> on minimizing (hopefully eliminating) this, such as
> [#7100](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/bundler/bundler/pull/7100),
