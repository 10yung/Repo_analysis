Miss it so much I have dreams about it :(
Choosing a stylesheet in MacOS Mojave resets selection. After having picked the file and clicking "Choose" from the file explorer, there's this endless 'reset' from the file explorer.

Sketch versions: 51.2 (beta), 50.1

Hi guys! I would love to use this plugin but it's not anymore supported. 
If someone is updated and maintaining this plugin, please share your forks in here.

Thanks!

Hi there!

This is a quick note to remind you that Sketch 45 will include a plugin update system.

It would be awesome if you could add support to it (it's really easy!) before Sketch 45 comes out. Ideally, you should release an update for your plugin while we're still in Sketch 44, so your users will have a nice & easy experience when 45 is released.

For more details, please check http://sketchplugins.com/d/229-updating-plugins and http://developer.sketchapp.com/introduction/updating-plugins/

Thanks in advance!

Hey John,
it's now super easy to install CSSketch via Runner's new _install_ functionality. I just added this information into your readme.md file. Hope that's ok. 😉 ✌️ 
@JohnCoates Not sure what I'm missing.

The readme docs say to enable CSSketch running the menu bar option "Plugins -> CSSketch -> Layout Layers". This brings up a Finder window. Not sure what file I'm meant to choose to enable the plugin. Nothing seems to be working unless this is selected.

Any help with how to get it working?
Couldn't run Less Parser! Any clue how to get this plugin to function correctly???
Hey John,
Can you please be specific with your instruction to use it? We can't get it to work. We installed in various ways (Sketch toolbox, Sketch Kit, Directly from GIT using your latest release), none worked.

We're lacking instruction on how to use them first time. Here goes basic questions that should be covered:
- Opened your example files
- Click the artboard
- Go back to menu bar > Sketch > Plugins > CSSSketch > Set Page Stylesheet (Selecting either CSS, SASS or LESS) the dialog keeps popping back up, does nothing at all. Seems that we cant link
- The other option does nothing too for Layout layer
- Whats the process on getting it hooked up to CSS? It's quite confusing. Please put instruction in layman term. Remember your audience are mainly designers, not developers and please don't assume we all know. The best way to tackle this is to do youtube tutorial. Thanks!

Check this out for example, super clear: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AYUGumE2bc and came in different parts.
