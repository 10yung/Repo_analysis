Hi everyone! Here's a very picky image distortion bug.

I have a 56dp widget with an 8dp padding. On the other side, I have pixel-perfect images made at 40dp (it's 56dp - 8dp * 2 sides).

If I apply those images to an `ImageView`, the result is pixel-perfect. But if I replace that `ImageView` with a `CircleImageView`, the result is not pixel-perfect anymore.

Thinking about it, I think that `CircleImageView` is getting the 40dp image, then resizing it to 56dp, and then applying the padding and resizing the image again to 40dp.

Here are some screenshots. First a comparison, and then a screenshot of every case:

Using the plain `ImageView`:

Using `CircleImageView`:

By the way, I'm using a local .png file. No network or strange things there.

Thanks again for your work! And happy New Year ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸŽ† ðŸŽ† ðŸŽ† 




I needed apply a spacing between the image and the border.
So, i maked a propriety of padding (mRadiusPadding) that give this space, kept the image without cut.
support Glide(v4.8.0) to display gif.
setBorderAlpha() method added
Is it on your roadmap to add support to Glide crossfade animation?
handles issue #125 
Added TranstionDrawable support. Now can use Glide built in transitions
Calling setImageURI with the same value as the previous one causes a redraw
I'm programatically applying alpha values to the image like this:
mProfilePicture.setImageAlpha(100);
But it doesn't seem to do anything.

I've tried using the same line of code on a regular ImageView and it works just fine, but when applied to the CircleImageView it doesn't work :(

Any suggestions/alternatives?

Hi,

I'm facing a quite interesting problem on Android Lollipop - if I set Bitmap to CircleImageView with setImageBitmap() method, it just shows black image:

Image is selected from Gallery app, and I can view it in debug mode (bitmap is not corrupted).

Everything is working OK with default ImageView:

This behaviour is random - some images are working correctly, some are not, and it occurs only on Android Lollipop.

Do you have any suggestions? I've checked app logs, everything is working OK - no OutOfMemory exceptions or something similar.
