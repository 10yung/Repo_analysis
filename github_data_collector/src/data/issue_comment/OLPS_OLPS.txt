When trying to add data, it says 'windowRisk' is not found. 

Error using save
Variable 'windowRisk' not found.

This is through pgui.m, because the gui doesn't show add data at all (see other issue)
Hi! 

I cannot find the WMAMR implementation in OLPS, I recon it is just a slight change of PAMR. I Think it got it right myself, but I can't really replicate the values from the WMAMR paper. Something seems off.
