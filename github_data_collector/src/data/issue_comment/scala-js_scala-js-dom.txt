`NavigatorLanguage.languages` is the way to get value that is equiualent to
`Accept-Language` HTTP header in every HTTP request from the user's browser.

Following the instructions on [From ES6 to Scala: Advanced](https://www.scala-js.org/doc/sjs-for-js/es6-to-scala-part3.html), I do:

```scala
val images = dom.document.querySelectorAll("img").asInstanceOf[NodeListOf[HTMLImageElement]]
images.map(_.src)
```

The second line doesn't compile, and the compiler tells us: `value map is not a member of org.scalajs.dom.NodeListOf[org.scalajs.dom.raw.HTMLImageElement]`. If I `import org.scalajs.dom.ext._`, I'd expect my `NodeListOf` to be "pimped", but apparently `PimpedNodeList` only applies on `NodeList`, and not on `NodeListOf`. You can try this in this [scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/buywMTHERNe7gKvGA2dmVg).

Am I missing something, or is there something incorrect in the documentation? (Or both!)

While method `Navigator.language` is present (implemented in `org.scalajs.dom.raw.NavigatorLanguage`), [Navigator.languages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorLanguage/languages) is not.
This way, users do not have to recite every field when creating a `RequestInit`. Also, the spec says the `RequestInit` dictionary must contain a field `window` which is set to null. We might as well include this too as a final variable, since the spec shows omitting it should be a type error.

Prompted by gitter conversation here: https://gitter.im/scala-js/scala-js?at=5d80415105fd3716953afa47
It looks like not documented in the spec nor implemented in browsers.
see https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/912

The current spec has `messageerror` event instead, but I'm omitting it because it is not described at MDN nor implemented Chrome for now. Tell me if I should include it in this PR.
* IndexedDB uses `Event` for `error` events

* XMLHttpRequest uses `ProgressEvent` for events except `readystatechange`

Probably it was accidentally forgotten and it will be convenient to have something like Element.classList.foreach or filter additionally to the others.
Don't you think?
