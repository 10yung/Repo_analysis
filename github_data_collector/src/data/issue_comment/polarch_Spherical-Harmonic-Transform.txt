Hi! 

I like your code very much. However, I obtained NAN while using inverseSHT when the spherical harmonic order reaches 160. What is the upper bound of the order? Can you also compute higher order transform? 

Many thanks,
Jia

There is no information what version of MATLAB is suitable for running the library and demo.
I've found that MATLAB demo run OK for 2015b, but fails for release 2011b, 2009b.
In version 2011b, the source of problems is expression "h.Position(3)" present in demo. 
If I comment all of those expressions, demo is run OK in 2011b

2) 
There is no information what MATLAB packages are required to run the library and demo.
At least, one required package is "Symbolic Math Toolbox" (which is referenced in w3j.m module)

3) Octave works for most of the demo, but fails at the code that uses "Symbolic Math Toolbox".
