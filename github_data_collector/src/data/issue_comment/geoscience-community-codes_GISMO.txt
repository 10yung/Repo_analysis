Hello,
I have a problem opening Catalog files.
The Catalog files have been created with another PC. I copied them from that PC (Mac, MATLAB R2018a) to my Laptop (Windows 10, MATLAB R2018a and R2019a). There is no loss of information due to the copying as the files have the same size. When I load a file there is no reading of the variables and they remain empty.

Running the Catalog_test I get the following error:

I downloaded GISMO the 20.03.2019.
Do you know where the problem could be? Or do you have any advice for me?
Thanks for your answer

I noticed a funky behavior today that was breaking my code. If a waveform object has multiple waveforms, then 
`get(w,'Channel') `
returns a cell array that contains the string 'BH?'. 
However, if the waveform object has 1 waveform, then 
`get(w,'Channel') `
returns a string array. 
I suggest that this function call always return a cell array. When looking at the return of a waveform that has 3 objects vs. a waveform that has 1, we cannot distinguish a difference by looking at size alone, since the string array for a channel is size 1x3. The user would need to test the type of the return.
I check the  website http://geoscience-community-codes.github.io/GISMO/testdata.html
in the download section. The file is not found.
Hello Dr. Thompson, 

My name is Marlon and I'm a MS Geophysics grad student at Boise State looking at an Alaska earthquake catalog. 

I've installed GISMO and it's working great at helping me quantify the robustness at the earthquake catalog I am interested. However, I was wondering if there is a way of using GISMO to produce a map of b-values (map view, not just the standard G-R relationship), which I know the older matlab package ZMAP can do. 

And I noticed that the cookbook way to only parse out a catalog by magnitude type isn't working 
e.g. : 
data = Catalog.retrieve('iris', 'starttime', '2014-01-01', 'endtime', '2015-12-30','magnitudeType', 'ml', 'maximumdepth', maxDepth ,'boxcoordinates', region1); 

should just extract local magnitude ('ml') events, but all magnitude types are included in the catalog upon inspection afterwards. Is there a work around for this? 

Thanks for entertaining my questions! 

Cheers, 

Marlon
Need to add the sample data into GISMO and also make sure the test suite works

Does not exist currently. But Carl Tape has his own library of GISMO add-ons, and that includes one. I think that might be hardwired for Alaska data. I can modify it so it works more generally.

yes,  a plot as a function of distance. Do you mean such a function does not already exist in GISMO?

You mean a plot of waveforms as a function of distance from an event? If so, it would be easy for me to add to the Catalog class. waveforms can be added for each event in a catalog. Only missing step is to add station lat/Lon info to waveforms.

Dear Glenn and Celso, 

Is there any function in GISMO for plotting record section?

How can I use the function response_apply with a sac file of poles&zeros?

I have also and script to extract the poles and zeros of this kind of sac files, but I don't know use the function  "response_apply" to deconvolve.

Has anyone else had this error when accessing data from a Winston inside a parfor loop? The same error isn't generated if I run the same code serially (for loop).
I've had success using this method in the past, so not sure where the problem lies.

I'm running CentOS 6.3, Java version 1.7.0_25, and MATLAB R2015b. 

Error using load_winston>getFromWinston (line 81)

- add tutorial

Ideas from INETER:
- stack, subtract & divide RSAM objects from each other
- same for mean frequency data as in Shishaldin paper
- plot Seisan catalog data on top of RSAM - make example

When using demo Seisan database, which has locations but not magnitudes, the color map is not set. So just need to set to cmap(1,:) in that case.
