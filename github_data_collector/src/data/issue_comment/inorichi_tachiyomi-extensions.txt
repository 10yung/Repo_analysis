### Other Details

Are a very good italian subbers site... Others, like Mangaworld, steal chapters from these sites without write the source.
Please, save them from this stupid sites, and add these to make them known

If is possible add they, they'll be a perfect for our country.
Mangahere normally has a insert image for the mangazone app as the last page. However, it doesn't get inserted properly for the webtoon viewer type. 

The invalid last image is now bypassed by reducing the total images by 1. It should not affect actual pages that are important. 

Also, changed to https
http://www.zerobyw4.com/
A variety of Cloudflare-protected sources aren't working properly on first try within Tachiyomi.

Workarounds include retrying and loading in Webview. It appears to only affect older versions of Android (up to 7.x).

Issue in main repo: https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi/issues/2344
##  Existing Problem
If you're familiar with the [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) themeing project, it started off as one giant repository of themes following one standard: [base16-builder](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder). Said themes had to be maintained by the same maintainers of Base16. **That didn't scale well.**  
To counter this, the old repo was deprecated, and a new one was created that provided:
1. theme file spec
2. engine spec
3. theme styling spec

Just the specs.  
Doing so, Base16 maintainers effectively allowed anyone to create a Base16 theme/engine **trivially** and upload it to their repo for others to use.

## Get to the point
I'm telling this story because I feel **it could reflect on the extensions situation we have here**.  

How are the extensions parsed within the tachiyomi app logic?  
The way they're handled could be turned into a spec that then would allow anyone to write sources (written in JSON for example, or YAML, etc..) instead of APKs.. And have them imported within the Tachiyomi app.

## What should (probably) be done
This is definitely a maintainer's decision to take, but I'd like to offer a proposal..  

On the Tachiyomi side:
- The way sources are included in the app to be abstracted into one generic extension template
- A helper to be created that reads files written in whatever parser library Tachiyomi uses so to not include more dependencies
- A catalogue import functionality to be introduced
- Extension maintencance is to be relieved from the Tachiyomi maintainer

On the users side:
- Catalogue files become the responsibility of their volunteering maintainers.
- Users are free to write and share their own (or source websites even)

## Why didn't you create a PR
