It is very misterious bt My guess its GC Any idea how to avoid this I found it in Chrome It works in Firefox and Safari Return the extracted BitMatrix extractedmatrix as additional property matrix of the result This allows the caller to reproduce an exact copy of the read QR code eg together with the decoded data See Fixes shouldInvert should also be true if optionsinversionAttempts equals onlyInvert add code in iframe with allow iframe allowaccelerometer ambientlightsensor autoplay camera encryptedmedia fullscreen geolocation gyroscope magnetometer microphone midi payment pictureinpicture speaker usb vibrate vr on pc its ok but ipad cant detect camera Pls help thanks With my iPhone I accessed the demo app at and successfully scanned a QR code I then cloned the demo html page the javascript source jsQRjs and placed them on my IIS site I changed the source reference in the html page to the correct script source location ScriptsjsQRjs Now when I accessed the demo page on my web server using the same iPhone the page is loaded with the message to allow camera access but the camera is not open I have verified that the page and script loaded correctly What am I missing Thanks First of all congratulations on the scanner and thanks for sharing I have created a QR code with colors and the reader does not read it Can it be configured in any way If I try to read the code with the iPhone camera it does recognize it I have done the test at If I create a code in black on a white background the scanner reads it If I take for example yellow over red background the scanner is not able to read it Thanks I try to read DataMatrix but this component doesnt work Do you have any ideas Is this development planned Im having a problem with qrcode readings from videostreams On your online demo Im getting the same results as my own implementation When I hold a QRcode in front of the camera it doesnt always got a fix to recognize it Files are attached oZi aAM When I move it a little bit somethimes it recognize it But it seems very unreliable Can I try some things to improve it jsQR cant find Qr on this picture smallscreenshot but when I open this picture above and take screenshot of it on the Macbook it can find qr and successfully decode it So this is screenshot of screenshot img width altscrneshotofscreenshot src This is how I used the jsQR library typescript const handleFileInput e any const reader new FileReader tsignore const canvasCtx canvasRefcurrentgetContext d readeronload readerEvent setStatusMessage setStatusMessageopening file eslintdisablenextline noundef const image new Image imageonload tsignore canvasRefcurrentwidth imagewidth tsignore canvasRefcurrentheight imageheight canvasCtxdrawImageimage const imageData canvasCtxgetImageData imagewidth imageheight const jsqrResponse jsQRimageDatadata imagewidth imageheight if jsqrResponse const potentialQrKey jsqrResponsedata find QR tryToRestoreWalletpotentialQrKey else setStatusMessage setErrorMessageCouldnt find QRkey on the image consolelogQR error tsignore imagesrc readerEventtargetresult readerreadAsDataURLetargetfiles is there any way to fix it thanks Hi Thanks for this amazing lib Its an integral part of a project Im rolling out and just on the verge of scaling in production Ive noticed the first instance of a QR code not being scanned at all We use H level best precision to generate the QR codes and the data encoded is a UUID in a text field In this failing example the text was a f e b a f I thought it was odd because the native iPhone camera is still able to recognise the QR code What gets stranger is if I drop the precision level to Q high or below it can be scanned by this lib H level best precision fail bestqualityfail Q level high precision ok highqualityok It seems to work ok with ZXing Im now concerned as Im about to be scaling out to s of generated QR codes to end users an unknown percentage of them will be unable to be scanned by this library I know theres been a few examples already reported but they dont seem to have made any progress which is worrying I would like to help get to the bottom of this but Im not sure I currently have the technical know how in this particular field without levelling up What are my options Does anyone have any idea Thanks
