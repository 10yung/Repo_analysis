I Ive written this tiny Dockerfile that someone can find useful to play githug without having prerequisites problems have fun m Also provides some practice using revision ranges I have installed ruby ruby v ruby p revision x linux and then github with sudo but I cant get githug command to work My terminal tells me that it doest exist githug zsh command not found githug I have read all threads in which someone had problems with installation but nothing had helped me It would be grateful if sombody could help me with this one because honestly I have no idea whats going on It should work but it does not Hello people While solving levels exactly by the th level I didnt do anything but typing githug play and I passed the level without even trying commands in order to solve the specific task As far as I can see I have correctly solved level however it does not pass the test from githug Steps to reproduce githug reset git rebase interactive HEAD remove second o from the upper commit message using the reword command githug play It says Sorry this solution is not quite right The output from git log looks like the following commit ef e ff a c ce dfe ddd dca b HEAD master Author Florian L diger xxxxxx Date Thu May Second commit commit b bf a c bb db f Author Florian L diger xxxxxx Date Thu May First commit commit df de fc d e a fe c Author Florian L diger xxxxxx Date Thu May Initial commit I have checked the problem definition and the solution only requires the commit message to be First commit which it is in my case I have not had problems with any of the previous levels I was unable to complete this level because repocommits was not the correct commit to be checking the message of When setting up the level First coommit does exist at repocommits but after renaming it via rebase it was always the first commit in the list repocommitsfirst It looks like the solution for this level used to work in a similar way you can see where it was changed from using first to using here This pull request fixes Hi We have problem statement as Correct the typo in the message of your first nonroot commit Im assuming this points to second log First coommit entry from bellow list with typo githugtestgithug git log commit ae bca ac aaa d ad f b dd HEAD master Author vikrant pawar Date Sat Feb Second commit commit f b e aa ed de d d b c bb Author vikrant pawar Date Sat Feb First coommit commit f f ea eae eaa bd a fd f Author vikrant pawar Date Sat Feb Initial commit However even after fixing it code doesnt mark it as success While digging code I found we are using repocommits message First commit which is checking string Second commit to First commit wanted to confirm if Im missing anything After using git diff or gitk to see changes and running githug command once again there is a question What is the number of the line which has changed According to this stackoverflow answer theres no way for git diff to show a line number It is not clear that user should use another software like vim to get the answer Sometimes the branch and commit order changes when the mergesquash level is reset This is what it looked like when the level was Reset githug reset mergesquash Logged git log all oneline twice powershell The same thing is seen with git log all it was just more compact to show them with oneline Is it just an issue with how git log works when several commits have the same time hhmmss which probably happens because github reset level creates the commits quickly Maybe the commits are read in a random order and since the next read commit has the same time stamp they end up in a random order However git log all graph online shows them in the correct order after every reset c cd longfeaturebranch Time bcbd Takes a a Developing new features bc e d HEAD master Second commit e First commit Resolves
