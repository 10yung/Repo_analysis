 Use mdfind kMDItemKind Application functionality to locate Spotifyapp Rather than hardconding and specifying specific locations This helps users who may have unconventional install locations hnarayanan First thanks for the original script included here Currently we use this script to share a spotify account between users Before meetings however we want to be able to gracefully fade the music to a low threshhold zero makes the room feel eerily quiet heh This seemed like a graceful way to approach that but I was curious if you would be interested in including this in the original code I had issues running locally so you may want to pull and verify this works but it seems as if it would Thanks again Starting Spotify if its not actually started is magic and should only be done explicitly Thus this PR changes starting Spotifyapp via osascript to printing the according error and exiting with Adresses Hey there love the tool One feature that I would love to see is an updating spotify status command that I can keep in a small section of my screen Essentially what watch spotify n outputs without any weird characters updating until i ctrlc Thanks Currently shpotify autostarts Spotifyapp if it is not running on any command This behaviour is not desirable for my use case i am trying to run shpotify in tmux command line to get current song playing Add ability to silently quit if Spotify is not running Adding feature Search by Lyrics play it instantly It could use lyric search engines to fetch song name This is very useful since Spotify itself doesnt have this feature And when we forget song name simply play it by the catchy lyric words we remember like spotify play lyric kiki do you love me Plays Drakes In My Feelings I would be good to add the functionality of queueing songs doing something like shpotify queue song ble shpotify queue album as to be able to make yourself a short list of songs to hear at once without it having to be a fixed album or preexisting list Theres already an open issue on spotify but it has a lot of support for them to add the functionality so we can expect it to happen soon Id like to do some scripting around this tool including capturing the output Itd be helpful if there was a flag that could be given like nocolors to disable colors
