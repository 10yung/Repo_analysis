 There seems to be a performance difference between using the modeldisableLogging vs activitydisableLogging This seems to stem from the latter only getting checked after the model has already created the activity and tried to log it Seems like adding a check to the model level to see if activity logging is enabled would address it and make so that the model level doesnt have to do the work if global logging is disabled in the first place So I have been integrating ActivityLog into all our apps and it has worked perfectly for us I do have a question about how I can set a causer for console commands We have one environment where a great deal of the management orchestration takes place at the CLI and I would like to track the Linux username of the person executing those commands Since the Linux user doesnt exist as a Laravel user I cant just use causedBy Currently I am just adding it to the description but would like to be able to query these in their own column for reporting Are there any secrets I am missing or is adding to to description or properties the best available method Thanks Hi I am trying to log only changed attributes by using protected static logOnlyDirty true in my model but this is not working if Im using translatable attributes package by Spatie it logs only English attributes and I think thats because my app locale is English I am using Laravel Framework and spatieactivitylog Thank you Hi I need to save the value of my id and not the id in the properties field php php namespace App use Illuminate Contracts Auth MustVerifyEmail use Illuminate Foundation Auth User as Authenticatable use Illuminate Notifications Notifiable use Spatie Activitylog Traits LogsActivity class User extends Authenticatable use Notifiable LogsActivity The attributes that are mass assignable var array protected fillable name email password idrol protected static logAttributes name email rolnombre protected static logFillable true protected static logOnlyDirty true The attributes that should be hidden for arrays var array protected hidden password remembertoken The attributes that should be cast to native types var array protected casts emailverifiedat datetime public function rol return thisbelongsToApp Rol Not sure if this would be related to but when I use UUID and incrementing false delete events cannot be recorded Migration php Schemacreateexample function Blueprint table tableuuididprimary tablestringname tablebigIntegerordernullable tabletimestamps tablesoftDeletes php Schemaconnectionconfigactivitylogdatabaseconnectioncreateconfigactivitylogtablename function Blueprint table tablebigIncrementsid tablestringlognamenullable tabletextdescription tableuuidsubjectidnullable example id use UUID tablestringsubjecttypenullable tableuuidcauseridnullable userid use UUID tablestringcausertypenullable tablejsonpropertiesnullable tabletimestamps tableindexlogname tableindex subjectid subjecttype subject tableindex causerid causertype causer Model php php namespace App Models use App Traits UsesUuid use Spatie EloquentSortable Sortable use Illuminate Database Eloquent Model use Spatie EloquentSortable SortableTrait use Spatie Activitylog Traits LogsActivity use Illuminate Database Eloquent SoftDeletes class Example extends Model implements Sortable use UsesUuid SoftDeletes SortableTrait LogsActivity protected fillable name order protected hidden updatedat deletedat public sortable ordercolumnname order sortwhencreating true protected static logAttributes name protected static recordEvents created updated deleted with or without recordEvents still not work Trait php php namespace App Traits use Illuminate Support Str trait UsesUuid public sortable ordercolumnname order sortwhencreating true protected static function bootUsesUuid staticcreatingfunction model if modelgetKey modelmodelgetKeyName string Struuid public function getIncrementing return false public function getKeyType return string Any help will be appreciated Thanks in advance At the moment if a causer is softdeleted you cant see there records Adding this config allows you to resolve softdeleted causers as well I am using the laravel version i configure activity log but create time not any data insert in activity log table only insert in the user table I attach the error screenshot please help me error we are using Moloquent jessenqer package instead of elquent package so every time we want to update composer package the file Activityphp change the extends from Moloquent to Model and we have to manually change it back so is there any permenent solution that we cant use the activity log with Moloquent not Eloquent Hello im trying to install but it gives an me error
