Is it possible to make a linechart view with three lines in there And without the fill So something like LineChartViewdata title Title legend Legendary data title Title legend Epic Hello Wanted to say this pie chart is simply beautiful If I may the definition of a pie chart is taken randomly from any dictionary on the web pie chart noun a graphic representation of quantitative information by means of a circle divided into sectors segment in which the relative sizes of the areas or central angles of the sectors correspond to the relative sizes or proportions of the quantities Would it be possible to have a way to define the sectors segments For instance in your example PieChartViewdata title Title legend Legendary legend is optional Would it be possible to do something like PieChartViewdata segmentDescription student active professional retired without job title category in leaving in city X legend Legendary legend is optional So we can understand are students are active professional etc PieChartViewdata segmentDescription soccer player tennis player judo player gymnast title athlete going to the Olympic legend Legendary legend is optional So we can understand are soccer players are tennis players etc The main idea is to be able to provide description for one piece of the pie chart not just an overall titlelegend For instance in your picture there is no way to say what corresponds to the smallest or biggest part of the pie without a lengthy TitleLegend I believe this would further increase the usage and the good experience using pie chart Thank you for your help Hey ChartView is working fine on MacOS but when using ChartView without the explicit form CGSize attribute then the appearing view is not the actual frame which results in major glitches when using VStack or HStack overlapping with other views Will look into it and might push a PR
