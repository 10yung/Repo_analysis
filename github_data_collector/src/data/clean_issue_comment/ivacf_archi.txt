code of hashcode and equals method MainActivity adaptersetRepositoriesrepositories MVP MVVM View Model View Model Hello Ive really read your code and its great But there is a problem MainActivity adaptersetRepositoriesrepositories In MVP and MVVM View and Model are not completely separated I think thats a problem and we cant replace View or Model at will Thanks for sharing this repo archi This is unlikely related to the MVVM design pattern but just want to make sure Im not missing anything important Why do you do MainViewModeljava java private void loadGithubReposString username ArchiApplication application ArchiApplicationgetcontext why not simply MainViewModeljava java private void loadGithubReposString username ArchiApplication application ArchiApplication contextgetApplicationContext I tried it and the app runs just fine Is it to prevent memory leak or sth I cant seem to get my head around it Sorry for the noob question Theres a bunch of duplicated code in each of the projects by moving it into its own library project we can share the common code amongst all three apps Im focused on the app that implements MVVM using it as an example to help in building my own app and I see that the list of repositories is not persisted when the activity is killed and recreated when the device is rotated How would you accomplish persisting the list of repositories when the device is rotated I want startactivityforresult or setresult and finish activity how can handle it in view model of activity Same question with view model of recyclerviewviewholder ItemRepoViewModel exists however is missing and logic is bundled with the RepositoryAdapter it would be nice to have a separate ItemRepoPresenter so the RecyclerViewAdapter is separated form business logic we have clear comparison between viewmodels and presenters In the MVP example the view directly issues commands on the presenter for example the MainActivity directly calls MainPresenterloadRepositories whereas it should rather use a passive callback like PresenteronUsernameSubmitted The main reason for this is to hand over navigation responsibility to the presenter away from the view which should be a dumb view Ive created this issue for discussion since this is obviously a matter of architecture style and code separation
