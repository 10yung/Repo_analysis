I have this error when I try to run the CelebA Dataset part ValueError zerosize array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity It is exactly in numpy core methodspy line in amin return umrminimuma axis None out keepdims initial Im very new to tensorflow and I somehow run this model but how do I change the output shape x to a bigger value Hiya Really appreciate this notebook Ive got a folder of resized images x that Im trying to feed through this Everything seems to go well final block runs but then finishes without output I suspect maybe this is a function of my original input images somehow
