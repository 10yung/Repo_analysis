I try to parse big table element with ContentExtractorstable but buildRow and buildTable method is not tail recursion Thereby ContentExtractorstable function throwed StackOverflowError that failed to parse URL When parsing pages in a foreign language a common use case for this library it is sometimes needed to parse dates formatted in another locale eg different month and week day names We should create a builtin parser and scalascraperconfig support for those cases just like we can use a real browser As you probably know Chrome now supports headless and one way to call it is through WebDriver Any plan for scalascraper to support headless Chrome It would be nice if the browsers has an asynchronous version of getthis way you can just do several page loads at once As a work around can I use a custom loader what format does Document need to be to work with scalascraper
