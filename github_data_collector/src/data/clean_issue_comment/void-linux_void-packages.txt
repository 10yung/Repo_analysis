Heya I havent been using Void Linux over the past two or so years and as such havent been updating nor keeping track of the following packages Im not quite sure what the process is to officially orphan them are however I do know outside of community updates these havent been touched Since the upgrade kernel version from to my intel wifi card is out Please can you patch the linux kernel like archlinux did in the kernel version I am on the last update kernel version and this problem is not solved And update the linuxfirmware package it is not in list of packages to update Off course i can boot on the kernel version on boot but it will be more comfortable to patch and update this packages A fun D retro platformer inspired by Sonic games and a game creation system that lets you unleash your creativity
