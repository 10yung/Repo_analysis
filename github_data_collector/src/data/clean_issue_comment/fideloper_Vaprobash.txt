Curious what the best practice is for running diff versions of MySQL using Vaprobash wVagrant Is there a simple way like there is for switching Node versions Ive updated this script to reflect the updated Vagrant box version for ubuntu ubuntuxenial I originally made most of these changes a couple of months ago and didnt think to make a pull request If any other maintainers for this projects base fork can testconfirm my changes work on their end that would be great I am more than happy to provide further explanation and edits if required I have a few libraries that rely on the ZIP extension It would be useful if either enablezip is included if there is more people who need this or to have a way to define a list of extensions though the config script to be installed This pull request specifically targets the upgrade of Ubuntu from to Here are some key topics that this upgrade has impact on which is important to users for this version Docker has been changes to Docker CE MongoDB has been updated to versions and had EOL in is troublesome Updated repository and version to for PostgreSQL MySQL versions has been bumped to and is no longer available To test this branch please make a checkout of this branch to reflect the version changes in the Vagrantfile and change your configuration in the Vagrantfile to the following Config Github Settings githubusername Repox githubrepo Vaprobash githubbranch featureubuntu githuburl Id appreciate any feedback if you have trouble with the builds Vaprobash need a full update to ubuntu this mean update for a lot of scripts a lot of PPA a full renew of this project When trying to install Vaprobash with PHP this error is shown and only PHP is installed Cannot add PPA ppaondrejphp When setting up a new vagrant instance i can no longer install php it fails on the ppa and reverts to Possibly due to the deprecation of ppaondrejphp Now have to use the ppaondrejphp version which bundles all PHP versions in one The problem is weird I am running vaprobash at my office macs macs all runs on sierra The problem is when I start the mac at morning and do vagrant up then the sites does not work Once I ssh to vagrant and check status then I see that nginx is working fine But If I run sudo service nginx restart then everything start working fine This is really weird and its happening to all our machines in the office Any suggession to fix this issue fideloper Here is the screenshot img width altscreen shot at pm src Ubuntu now forces all packages to be sign on secure firm so it can broke old installations This PR fix that problem added new keys from mariadb repository and set current SO version to avoid install version mistakes
