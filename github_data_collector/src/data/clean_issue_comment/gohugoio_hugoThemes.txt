please let us know Feel free to ask questions Were glad to help This issue records the themes currently in the Hugo Themes showcase that have not been updated and currently use deprecated variables in their templates that will be removed from Hugo at some point in the future These themes throw console warnings in the deploy logs of the Hugo Themes showcase bep I am notifying you with this issue about the need to apply the removal of the various deprecated variables gradually whenever you deem necessary and not all at once As you know the Build Script allows for broken theme demos beyond this number we wont be able to update the Themes Site until we have removed these themes cc digitalcraftsman hugogoa RSSLink hugosustain Pages Hugo onetwothree Pages URL hugostellartheme Pages Hugo
