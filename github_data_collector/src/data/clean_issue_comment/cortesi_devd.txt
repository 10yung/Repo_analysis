Command devd w or similar does proxy the Webservice but does not recognize changes in the directory Running devd l in the same directory works with LiveReload of changes Running with w debug shows no change detected when changing files while l directly detects changes devd version cortesi I love your modd I think is the best Now Id like to fall in love with devd but nothing I cannot use it on Windows Using the below code in moddconf conf renderedcss renderedhtml daemon devd m rendered daemon devd l nothing happens in my browser Using it with devd ol works good This is a first draft that implements websocket proxying Im not sure it works very well but its a first try In particular Im interested in l but still dying on SIGHUP Usecase asynchronous starting and stopping of devd through zsh zpty When zshs zpty exits zpty d name it sends a SIGHUP to the backgrounded process Im perfectly fine with the builtin anything under the root directory live reloading but would rather avoid having to explicitly use pkill when I could simply have an ondown hook Alternatively maybe add a flag that overrides Llws special treatment of SIGHUP so Id use for example lh where h would stand for HUP Cant find an option to log the POST body Is there one If not can it be added the following code is borrowed from this example I made a few minor changes but Im not familiar with the Go language so the syntax may be need some correction it could be applied to devdgo text type HTTPHeaderValue httpHeader func h HTTPHeaderValue Setvalue string error parts stringsSplitNvalue if lenparts return fmtErrorfexpected HEADERVALUE got s value httpHeaderhAddparts parts return nil func h HTTPHeaderValue String string return func h HTTPHeaderValue IsCumulative bool return true func HTTPHeaders kingpinSettings target httpHeader target httpHeader sSetValueHTTPHeaderValuetarget return hdrs HTTPHeaderkingpinFlagheader Add HTTP response headerShortHPlaceHolderHEADERVALUE if cors hdrsSetAccessControlAllowOrigin the intention is to accept multiple CLI headernamevalue options ex text devd headerStrictTransportSecuritymaxage headerCacheControlmaxage port all tls Hello When serving a page is there a way to have the client IP address even with debug or Headers I dont see it Thanks I understand that you cant fix the cert but if less experienced developers use devd s they might be confused by it I suggest that if you have a s flag and are serving with a fake local cert add something like this to your info logging devd ols Route reads files from Listening on If you get a Your connection is not private warning click Advanced Allow had someone ask me about this I thought putting it into the tool would be useful Im invoking devd with the command below and accessing my application over I noticed in my application that XForwardedProto http shouldnt it be https since I am forwarding devd port certcertsdevdiobundlepem Changing the following line in reverseproxygo to reqHeaderSetXForwardedProto targetScheme results in XForwardedProto being set to https it works for my usecase but Im not sure if this is the right fix example invocation devd A example request from a different host curl this causes a response I expected it to return a response with the file indexhtml is there a way to setup devd so it returns a response context my client doesnt follow redirects atm i am using devd edit this looks like the relevant code however i dont see any way to disable this behavior
