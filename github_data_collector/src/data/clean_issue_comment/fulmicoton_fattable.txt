Hello I want to also select column name which are visible in view port The API example shows this rowHeight constant row height px Could this be changed dynamically For example imagine row content that is actually very tall but by default only line of that content is shown in a row Next imagine you wanted to let users expand the row so its full content can be seen How Can this be done Are there any plans to do search bar Im not sure if you intended this but it seems as though the goTo and the setScrollXY conflict That is targetY seems to deal with the columns inside of goTo but in setScrollXY the targetY variable would be used to scroll up and down To get the goTo working I actually changed the javascript code to changed targetY and targetX javascript TableViewprototypegoTo functioni j var targetX targetY targetY i null thisrowHeight i void targetX j null thiscolumnOffset j void return thisscrollsetScrollXYtargetY targetX Since the move to translation move everybody I assume Who does that though When you click your scrollwheel cursor changes to circle with an arrow in each direction to scroll the page only moves a few pixels in each direction Tested in Chrome Page Up Page Down CtrlHome and CtrlEnd hotkeys do not work
