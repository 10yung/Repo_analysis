Crash possible Image unknown functions Visited empty function XboxKernelRtlImageXexHeaderField CS trying to enter CS at A FB h that was not initialized Lots of unimplemented stuff If you have a game in D Games Consoles X Homebrew Quake after Quake the rest of the folder name doesnt get parsed All of the games I have tried recompiling seem to fail due to many missing cpu instructions for example vsubshs is not a member of cpuop vmrghh is not a member of cpuop vsr is not a member of cpuop vctsxs is not a member of cpuop Am I doing something incorrectly I thought most cpu instructions were already implemented Taking a shot at improving the quality of the language within the README I realise theres already but I didnt see that until after I started and the changes I suggest are more comprehensive perhaps both are worth merging and combining
