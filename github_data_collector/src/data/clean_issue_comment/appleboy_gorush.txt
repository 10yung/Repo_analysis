appleboy This ties in to PR from gofcm Hey appleboy ran into a little issue here need this tweak to be able send and process background notifications on android If you want to process android notifications in the BACKGROUND they need to be data notifications as in not contain the notification key in the payload This little change achieves it because omitempty on structs for the json encoding does not work on substructs except if it is a pointer to it and set to nil Hey I did have some failed push notifications time levelerror msg failedpush android Yxxxxxxxxxx MESSAGE Error Message unregistered device And I did set the env vars GORUSHCORESYNC as false and the GORUSHCOREFEEDBACKHOOKURL with the API hook URL but the failed event is never dispatched to my hook API Do I need to configure another stuff Steps that I have done before I ask this question Ive successfully built gorush binary file and sent push notification to my android phone Ive also successfully sent push notification using POST apipush web API To accomplish this I git cloned this project and created configtoml inside gorush folder and changed some params into my own What I am trying to accomplish However what I am trying to accomplish here is to import this library in my own web server project and build custom push notification web APIs Iis it standalone If it is plausible to accomplish I will be appreciated if you could provide some resources or examples I can take a reference to because I cant seem to find it anywhere in this project This is all you need to deploy application directly to

that notifications workers and queue have are sent to APNsFCM before a push notification service is shutdown I have an option to use sync mode but I use async mode if possible If the gorush doesnt support graceful shutdown I would like to try to contribute your project Thank you Hi Ive recently switched to using gorush to deliver notifications to my app I am checking if my app is receiving notifications in my case while the app is in the foreground by implementing the following in AppDelegateswift swift func application application UIApplication didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo AnyHashable Any fetchCompletionHandler completionHandler escaping UIBackgroundFetchResult Void printUSER INFO userInfo completionHandlernoData If I dont set the delegate function userNotificationCenter willPresent withCompletionHandler then all remote notifications will be processed in the AppDelegate function If I send the following data the function is not called implying that the notification was not received notifications tokens mytoken data customdatafield platform topic mytopic development true contentavailable true If I add a title mytitle to the notification with or without the contentavailable field the function is called which means the notification has most definitely been received This seems to imply that silent notifications are not being delivered correctly Any ideas
