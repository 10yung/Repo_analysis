Hi thanks for this project very cool I wanted to install this by building from source instead of installing the prepackaged binary Is this the right way to do it on macOS from the root directory of the repo sh brew install rust cargo build release cp targetreleaseyarnautocompletions installsh ZSHCUSTOMplugins Trust program from Unidentified developer macOS Catalina Gatekeeper spctl add ZSHCUSTOMpluginsyarnautocompletionsyarnautocompletions rm yarnautocompletions Pressing yarn run tab tab does not list commands that have a in their name For example a packagejson with the following scripts does not display the startdev and testwatch commands json scripts start node startdev webpackdevserver test jest testwatch yarn test watch Hey this is a very cool plugin However when I type yarn a it doesnt autocomplete it to yarn add This is a pitty as autocompletion for custom yarn scripts works just fine Would it be possible to add the builtin commands like add and remove to the list This should be the complete list of builtin commands access add audit autoclean bin cache check config create exec generatelockentry global help import info init install licenses link list login logout node outdated owner pack publish remove run tag team unlink unplug upgrade upgradeinteractive version versions why workspace workspaces
