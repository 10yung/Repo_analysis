I also have written a command line tool which is embedded into the apps bundle Id like this tool to also have access to the passwords stored in the Keychain by the main app HOWEVER for the life of me I cannot get the two to share access to the same keychain items The commandline tool always pops up the auth dialog img width altpic src I suspect my code is correct In both the main app and the tool the following does give me access to the password data from the keychain let keychain Keychainservice serviceName accessGroup F D HXScomobfuscatedappname I am guessing my problem is in the configuration of the two projects in Xcode For the macOS app I have app target Capabilities Keychain Sharing turned on and the keychain group it generated there is whats used in the code above F D HXScomobfuscatedappname Turning this on also caused a provisioning profile to be generated which seems fine However the target settings for the command line tool has no Capabilities section so I cant turn on Keychain Sharing Also theres no apparent way to select the provisioning profile the macOS app is using not sure if I need to do this or not Can anyone give me any pointers on how to get this working
