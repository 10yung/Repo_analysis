Along the same lines as issue and is it possible to include question labels as the primary labels for the tibbles when importing from fetchsurvey and readsurvey Currently they are listed as secondary labels but they cannot be used to refer to the appropriate columns eg select cannot find columns based on the question labels I have used colnamesdatafile sjlabelledgetlabeldatafile as a workaround but it would be nice to have the option at import to use question labels as column names This is especially useful when researchers have added labels in Qualtrics so the labels rather than the questions are included Hi I have enjoyed working with qualtRics and was glad to see that its being updated Thank you Im working with Qualtrics XM Directory which adds another layer of API documentation to access and edit XM Directory contacts and mailing lists Ive been able to use httr jsontlite and Qualtrics API calls to do what I need to do but Im wondering if you plan on adding some XM Directory functions similar to what the Python library QualtricsAPI has done Id like to offer help in translating from the Python library if I can but Ive just started learning Python Also Im learning GitHub I literally signed up to make this request Thanks again for your efforts Users are starting to have various problems such as those noted in and that I believe are related to being on the v responseexports API Looks like its time to bite the bullet and switch to the new export API This will impact most functionality in this package When we make this switch I plan for this package to no longer support the older Legacy format For projects where you cant access the qualtrics API it would be helpful to have a function that can read the qualtrics survey output Although I think having API access is the gold standard here and is my preference this becomes a challenge if a project is hosted by another organization where getting an API key would also require getting credential for the hosting organizations system Im proposing a function similiar to readsurvey in that it reads a downloaded qsf file instead of downloading data from the API In this case the survey can be downloaded on the survey page as seen in the screenshot below The result is downloading a qsf file that is in JSON and has information about the survey and can actually be loaded into qualtrics to import the survey getting survey export If I generate some test responses in qualtrics and then immediately try to run fetchsurvey it does not import the new responses This is the case even with forcerequest TRUE I found a clue on this page It suggests that the API can capture very recent data by setting an enddate value This also works for fetchsurvey BUT it only works if a different enddate is used for each request Ie the following is what happens If I generate test responses in qualtrics then try fetchsurvey the new responses are not captured If I set an enddate value for fetchsurvey with a value in the future the new data is imported If then generate more test data in qualtrics and try again to import using fetchdata it does not capture the new data This is true even if I use the same enddata value as step If I try with a new different enddata value then the fetchsurvey command does work I assigned text responses to certain topics using the text tab in qualtrics This field shows up under embedded data on the qualtrics site but does not get imported into R after fetchsurvey call Is there a way to get this field to be included Look into using vcr for testing API calls A new function could generate a Qualtrics survey from a listvectordataframe surveyquestions appears to only work for api pulls It would be great if it could also work either on a raw csv or on an object read in using readSurvey Some of us dont have API access There is a new API to get survey responses which pulls from a different engine and allows fixes to contact lists and embedded data to show up in results Are there plans to update to using this new call
