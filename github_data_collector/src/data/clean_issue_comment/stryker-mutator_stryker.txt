with a separate packagejson I set up Stryker in the test directory and configured it to include files from the src directory with relative paths When I run the tests from the test directory some mutants survive that I know should be killed If I reconfigure Stryker to run from the root directory then the mutants that I would expect to be killed are killed This may be due to a pathing issue when creating the sandbox I notice that when I run Stryker from the test subdirectory the src directory is copied into strykertmp rather than strykertmpsandboxXXXXXXX I have filled in the requested information below but I would also suggest looking at this repo that contains a simplified project for reproducing the issue and my test results Stryker config js moduleexports functionconfig

changing coverageAnalysis to off fixes issue Honestly I dont know why this issue occurs but I think too many exports lines in file can cause it but I am not sure since there is nothing really different from version to version works for one small changes doesnt work Repo build PR In this particular job there is no saying its caused by stryker but later on after some tweaks I got message like on top tests and coverage run good Changing coverageAnalysis works strykerlog Summary When using a jest config file with projects property stryker run fails with Jest Cannot use configuration as

names are logged Feel free to obfuscate those log messages if you think it is a problem Question We have the good fortune to receive wonderfull help from the Stryker community However weve been pretty lousy in honoring them We need to change this The question is how do we want to do that Who better to ask than our contributors themselves Please in no particular order JoshuaKGoldberg ollelauribostrom bharaninb simondel Archcry mthmulders brodybits kmdrGroch philippw mshogren sharikovvladislav mscharley tommilligan and all the people Ive forgot to include here dont hesitate to add more How do you want to be honored There is a tool out there called allcontributorsbot than can add youre face to a readme file Would you mind that Since we have more than readme file per package I suggest using the main readme file However I think we can also choose multiple readme files or use the CLI tool to do that So we can choose the main readme and the stryker core readme for example Other suggestions are welcome as well Is your maintenance request related to a problem Please describe Ever since mutationtestingelements we dont have actual logic in the html reporter package anymore However people seem to have problems finding it For larger projects it is much more helpful than the console reporter Describe the solution youd like Lets add the reporter to the standard list of reporters and enable it by default fixes closes pipechain functions It is popular and very widespred to use pipe functions or some chains mycollectionfiltereeactivemapeevaluesort And very usefull to remove one call from chain to verify tests mycollectionmapeevaluesort mycollectionfiltereeactivesort mycollectionfiltereeactivemapeevalue May be its not good for some projects and can generate some lifeless mutants but my experience show that this is one of usefull mutator when you use array pipes or work with RxJs Im using this implementation While working on the additional mutations I proposed in PR I started wondering if it might be practical to consider combine the JavaScript TypeScript mutators together I can think of a couple of possible approaches Prettier is able to have a unified estree format from Babel and from TypeScript using typescripteslinttypescriptestree package Prettier is also able to use Babel to parse TypeScript with some known limitations at this point as proposed in prettierprettier It would also be possible to use the TypeScript parser to parse both JavaScript and TypeScript an idea discussed in prettierprettier Another thing that can probably help some parsing beginners like myself is PS I can think of some important points that should be summarized here in the description as well My idea to use typescripteslinttypescriptestree is there to help bridge the differences in syntax tree output from Babel and typescript parsers as I explained in multiple comments below I am now thinking that the parser could be moved into its own pluggable stage The next challenge is how to deal with things like JSX TSX Vue with JavaScript and Vue with TypeScript Prettier seems to already have a solution to deal with these formats Please if anything is not clear in this descriptions or in the comments below ask
