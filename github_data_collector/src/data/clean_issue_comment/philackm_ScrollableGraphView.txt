 Is it possible to make stacked bar chart The current release version errors when Carthage tries to compile All that needs to be done is to tag the current commit as a new release as the fix is already in the latest commit on the master branch Currently the Y axis represents digit value like the intermediate stops I want to have option where I can use String instead of those digits Will it be possible Hi thanks for this great library I noticed a problem on the bar graph when reloading a new data set with default animation This behavior does not happen when not using any animation or using the elastic one This is the first state of the graph img width alt src After reloading with the new data set img width alt src Notice how the second and the fourth one is slightly thicker than others becuase their first state was higher Second data set was all s The same problem occurs the other way around too It doesnt go all the way up to the last reference line How can I achieve dot plots clickable I want to fire the event on the selected plot Just ran the Swift updater or whatever its called and your code is now compiling using the swift compiler Release the kraken Hi is there way to see how many points can be fit to viewable screen not whole scrollable view only current view fit to screen also i found max points fit to current viewable screen is there way to increase it Earlier everything was working fine until today when i scroll the graph it crashes on the func setPlotPointPositionsforNewlyActivatedPoints activatedPoints Int withData data Double on the line graphPoints activatedPointIndex x newPositionx with error Thread Fatal error Index out of range What could be the possible reason Thank you for this awesome library but I am facing some issue with adding dot on graph I want something like this screen shot at pm and I have used following code for adding dots on graph achieving this IBOutlet var viewGraph UIView var arrPink var arrBlue override func viewDidLoad superviewDidLoad let graphView ScrollableGraphViewframe CGRectx y width viewGraphframesizewidth height viewGraphframesizeheight dataSource self Setup the second line plot let orangeLinePlot LinePlotidentifier orange orangeLinePlotlineWidth orangeLinePlotlineColor colorLiteralred green blue alpha orangeLinePlotlineStyle ScrollableGraphViewLineStylesmooth orangeLinePlotshouldFill true orangeLinePlotfillType ScrollableGraphViewFillTypesolid orangeLinePlotfillColor colorLiteralred green blue alpha orangeLinePlotadaptAnimationType ScrollableGraphViewAnimationTypeelastic Setup the line plot let blueLinePlot LinePlotidentifier blue blueLinePlotlineWidth blueLinePlotlineColor colorLiteralred green blue alpha blueLinePlotlineStyle ScrollableGraphViewLineStylesmooth blueLinePlotshouldFill true blueLinePlotfillType ScrollableGraphViewFillTypesolid blueLinePlotfillColor colorLiteralred green blue alpha blueLinePlotadaptAnimationType ScrollableGraphViewAnimationTypeelastic let blueDotPlot DotPlotidentifier blueDot blueDotPlotdataPointType ScrollableGraphViewDataPointTypecircle blueDotPlotdataPointSize blueDotPlotdataPointFillColor colorLiteralred green blue alpha blueDotPlotadaptAnimationType ScrollableGraphViewAnimationTypeelastic graphViewbackgroundFillColor colorLiteralred green blue alpha selfviewbackgroundColor colorLiteralred green blue alpha graphViewdataPointSpacing graphViewshouldAnimateOnStartup true graphViewshouldAdaptRange true graphViewshouldRangeAlwaysStartAtZero true let dotPlot DotPlotidentifier darkLineDot Add dots as well dotPlotdataPointSize dotPlotdataPointFillColor UIColorwhite dotPlotadaptAnimationType ScrollableGraphViewAnimationTypeelastic let referenceLines ReferenceLines referenceLinesreferenceLineLabelFont UIFontboldSystemFontofSize referenceLinesreferenceLineColor UIColorclear referenceLinesreferenceLineLabelColor UIColorclear referenceLinesrelativePositions referenceLinesdataPointLabelColor UIColorwhitewithAlphaComponent Add everything to the graph graphViewaddReferenceLinesreferenceLines referenceLines graphViewaddPlotplot blueLinePlot graphViewaddPlotplot blueDotPlot graphViewaddPlotplot orangeLinePlot graphViewaddPlotplot dotPlot viewGraphaddSubviewgraphView Do any additional setup after loading the view typically from a nib but the issue is that dot is plotting on on one bar I am unable to add dot on both bar please check bellowed screen shot and please help me where I was wrong screen shot at pm
