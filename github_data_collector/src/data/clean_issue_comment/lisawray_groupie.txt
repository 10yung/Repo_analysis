So im developing an app that will streamline mine and my bosses workflow to where we input all the things we need to do and have done in this app so at the end of the month we can easily see what work he have done so we can send out bills Each work order can have multiple items For example at Company A we need to install a new printer and install a new network switch so thats work items for work order for Company A Now i added a feature where we can check which work items are complete but when i click on the seconds item checkbox to mark it as complete i get an error Wanted item at position but an Item is a Group of size This is how I implement my OnClickListner viewHolderitemViewjobstatussetOnClickListener LogdJobInfo Status position position val JobInfoItem getItemposition as JobInfoItem LogdJobInfo Item desc JobInfoItemjobInfo So when i try to getItem by position i get that error I noticed that there is some sort of bug here Is there some sort of way around it I am using groupie in my latest app and I have to say it has made my life so much easier Im building a fragment where the user can select form a list of teams to add to his favorites The favourites are represented by the first section which is nonexpandable and the rest of the sections are the teams sorted in Leagues each expandable group is a league My problem is that a single team can exist in multiple Section leagues and I need to update it in all of these sections when the user addsremoved it form his favourites What Im doing right now is the following for i in until groupAdapteritemCount val item groupAdaptergetItemi FIXME The team does not get addedremoved form collapsed groups if item is TeamItem itemteamtid teamtid itemisSelected false groupAdapternotifyItemChangedi Unfortunately this does not update the TeamItems in collapsed sections Is there a way to keep the items updated in both expanded and collapsed groups Currently there is a manual process related to releasing a Groupie version Id like to automate that using the CircleCI setup we already have in place Basically I want any tagged commits to automatically create a new release I have the keystore file and its details and I can add them as encrypted files variables to whatever CircleCI setup is made If anyone has CircleCI experience Ill welcome PRs or guides to do this Overview Fixed to reset item position in the carousel when CarouselItem is displayed again Screenshot BeforeAfter ezgif c eef faf ezgif e cfba e c Hi all I have item list with webView inside When I scroll list webView over and over again loading content How properly disable recycle items Overriding this method in item not work for me override fun isRecyclable Boolean return false Thanks Hi Im using ExpandableGroups the list is dynamic could refresh including subitems every few seconds and my current approach is Im recreating all the items at every update letting DiffUtil figure out the changes I also override the Items equals to prevent unnecessary redraws of the items if the contents werent changed While updating I want to keep the expanded or collapsed state of the ExpandableGroups so Im wondering whats the recommended way to do that My current solution is to extend GroupAdapter and override the update method where I search for the Items and if found restore the expanded state manually This runs on the UI thread I guess it should to make sure I get the latest valid expanded states and even though I dont have a lot of items it can take up to a few ms to run on my test devices I wonder if theres any better way to achieve this Any comments appreciated See sample code below its Java obviously in Kotlin it would be more concise but thats not the point Note that I only have expandable items at root level otherwise the method would need to be recursive import androidxannotationNonNull import comxwraygroupieExpandableGroup import comxwraygroupieGroup import comxwraygroupieGroupAdapter import comxwraygroupieItem

superupdatenewGroups Describe the bug When GroupAdapterupdateAsync keeps getting called in the background and I click expandcollapse on an expandable item occasionally I get a crash To Reproduce I forked the project and created a branch with a modified example to reproduce the bug Steps to reproduce the behavior When starting the example nondatabinding the code will keep calling updateAsync to update the items Meanwhile if I keep tapping the expandcollapse button on the expandable item the code will eventually crash it might take a while for it to happen tapping it rapidly tend to give faster results Expected behavior Code should not crash when expanding items while using updateAsync Library version Additional context Example stacktraces here comxwraygroupieexample EAndroidRuntime

androidosHandlerdispatchMessageHandlerjava at androi Describe the bug Situation Im updating all the items of the GroupAdapter recreating all of them at every update and calling GroupAdapterupdateitems I have id specified for all items so the DiffUtil could tell which items were actually kept moved or insertedremoved and I have also equals overridden for all items including expandable items to only redraw if there were actual modifications In this scenario when I update the items where I also recreate the Expandable header but its unmodified so equals returns true with the previous one after an update like this the Expandable items expandcollapse will no longer work To Reproduce I forked the project and modified it to reproduce the bug in MainActivity its here Steps to reproduce the behavior Upon starting the example the normal one not databinding clicking the expandcollapse button works as expected After updating the items which can be achieved by pressing the Floating Action Button with settings icon which I modified the expandcollapse button will no longer work The icon still gets animated correctly and when I debug I can see onToggleExpanded is called isExpanded gets set correctly oldSize and newSize are computed correctly it goes to NestedGroups notifyItemRangeInserted or notifyItemRangeRemoved when collapsing where observableonItemRangeInserted is called and inside that the observers list seems to be empty so nothing happens Expected behavior Expandingcollapsing should keep working after updating the items with new instances Library version Additional context Just noticed theres a bug here that sounds similar to what Im seeing It could be related to that as well Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe The Android Paging library is becoming the standard way to handle paging on Android As far as I know it currently does not work with Groupie yet It would be great to add support for the library to Groupie chibatching has written an article on how to connect the Paging library with Groupie This is a great start Im not sure its the ideal solution It requires you to have a PagedList containing groupie Items This is not a great separation of concern We want the DataSource to provide data not groupie Items to keep the DataSource free from any view related logic The post suggests passing a transform function to the datasource which works but it still means that the ViewModel is exposing a PagedList of groupie items You could transform the PagedList by using the map function on the DataSourceFactory However this means losing any additional information on the factory such as a LiveData exposing error states It loads all content into a single Group Im not sure if this is a problem but ideally youd submit the paged list directly into the adapter Its not a native solution that the library provides Describe the solution youd like Firstclass support for the paging library in the main groupie library or perhaps an additional module Option Add a updatep pagedListT t TransformFunction function to GroupAdapter This function takes a PagedList of any raw data and a transform function that maps the data to groupie items Option Add a updatep PagedListT Item function to GroupAdapter This still requires that the PagedList is mapped to groupie items by the consumer first Additional context If this is something you would consider adding to the library Id be happy to give it a shot and see if I can come up with a PR I dont want to redraw all ExpandableGroups so i override equals in my Item as follows override fun equalsother Any Boolean if this other return true if other is HeaderItem return false if identifier otheridentifier return false if expandableGroupitemCount otherexpandableGroupitemCount return false return true But if I change ChildrenItem and dont redraw HeaderItems I cant click on other HeaderItems
