make build step Any instructions would be appreciated HI I have an issue when using the sparkle framework from uiseparationandxpc branch with App Sandbox I have dragged the entire sparkle project into my application Screenshot at PM Added The XPC Service in dependencies Screenshot at PM Created a file phase and added the XPC Services Screenshot at PM Added Run Script Screenshot at PM Added below line of codes in AppDelegate to check for update Added the delegates SPUUpdaterDelegateSPUStandardUserDriverDelegate let updaterNew SPUStandardUpdaterControllerinitupdaterDelegate self userDriverDelegate self updaterNewupdaterautomaticallyChecksForUpdates true updaterNewupdatercheckForUpdatesInBackground When running the application I am getting Time Out issue Please advice me to find out the mistake I have done any extra thing have to do to get it working Branch uiseparationandxpc Xcode macOS Log Sparkle Timed out while probing installer progress I may be grossly misunderstanding the way this actually works If so forgive me Im currently in the middle of migrating my sparkleversion number from a single digit say to the actual app version number say I could explain the reasons for this change in more details but my question is regarding the behavior Im observing while putting this together Because this move is seen like a downgrade by Sparkle I decided to use a transition build of my app which contains a version of Sparkle that allows downgrades Using the versionbuild number notation here people who have cant downgrade but they are directed to which contains a build of Sparkle that allows downgrades That build will then find build and should allow the perceived downgrade Once the user has downgrades are not allowed again and the next build will be The problem is this doesnt seem to work reliably I have situation when the build refuses to downgrade and some machines when the same build updates to without any problem My question is Is the code that checks for the downgrade Im assuming its AutoUpdate cached anywhere I seem to be getting some builds of allowing downgrades and some which do not The code is the same and the Sparkle framework is the same and should allow downgrades So where is this finding a test for downgrading in some cases and not others Im looking for a little help from someone with a little more sparkle experience than I do Id like to build out a github action for building and deploying a macOS app to S Im a little hung up on how to achieve the generateappcast aspect of it from within what is almost certainly a container If anyone has a little free time to help Ill reward with a free writeuptutorial for the community Possibly a cold beer if you live close to me Please clean the cache on the dir LibraryCachegenerateappcast before generate the appcast file Work required to make Sparkle x official Port EdDSA keys Create documentation for installation and configuration of x Create migration guide for x users Add bannerslabels to every x documentation page that it is outdated Add bannerslabels to x documentation pages that they apply only to new Sparkle x Add issue templates for x Add which version am I using help page to the website that helps select the right documentation Add version to logs perhaps even call it Sparkle I invoke Sparkle by cocoapods when I push code to remoteCI

should be updated We currently support deployment of Sparkle on macOS as old as I think bumping oldest supported OS version to should be uncontroversial Can we bump to The abort function is sprinkled liberally in the code base A failure or incorrect usage in Sparkle should not cause the client program to crash in production Failure modes in Sparkle should be dealt with by logging via the Apple System Log functionality and then terminating gracefully This functionality and API is supported back to Apples new unified logging API is only supported back to which makes it unsuitable for Sparkle Sparkle supports OS versions back to
