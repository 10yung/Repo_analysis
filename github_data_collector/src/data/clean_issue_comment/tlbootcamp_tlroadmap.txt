mm mm I want to contribute in translation to English and I dont understand where to place translated files Yes theres translations folder but its structure is not described Moreover if we are to put translated files there it will be a chore to update links in roadmap and readme files So I propose to add explicit ruru suffix to all existing mdfiles written in Russian and add explicit RU tag to all link names in translated roadmap TBD and readme This way making a translation and updating the links will be straightworward Lets see an example of the flow when we want to translate skillsresourcemanagerdelegationmd to English clone the tlroadmapskillsresourcemanagerdelegationrurumd rename it to tlroadmapskillsresourcemanagerdelegationenusmd do the translation open tlroadmapREADMEenusmd and tlroadmaproadmapenuspuml and change Delegation RU link to Delegation EN This way it will be explicitly visible in README and roadmap which parts are already translated and worth clicking by nonRU users Further the same flow could be applied if someone is willing to translate English version to Simple Chinese or Brasilian Portuguese or any other language This is a draft of the translation process as discussed here Will add Russian source document when we agree on the structure and meaning of the English version DevAlloy Hello is there any plan of English version of this project roadmapmm examples
