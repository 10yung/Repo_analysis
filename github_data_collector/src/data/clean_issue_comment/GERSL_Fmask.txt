Can Fmask be run on the ARD tiles available from USGS The folder structure appears to be different For example these are the topofatmosphere files I downloaded Hi Everyone I believe I set everything correctly but when I try to run Fmask I get the following error Fmask error while loading shared libraries libmwlaunchermainso cannot open shared object file No such file or directory I added the following lines to profile also tried bashrc LDLIBRARYPATHusrlocalMATLABMATLABCompilerRuntimev runtimeglnxa usrlocalMATLABMATLABCompilerRuntimev binglnxa usrlocalMATLABMATLABCompilerRuntimev sysosglnxa usrlocalMATLABMATLABCompilerRuntimev sysjavajreglnxa jrelibamd nativethreadsusrlocalMATLABMATLABCompilerRuntimev sysjavajreglnxa jrelibamd serverusrlocalMATLABMATLABCompilerRuntimev sysjavajreglnxa jrelibamd XAPPLRESDIRusrlocalMATLABMATLABCompilerRuntimev X appdefaults PATHPATHLDLIBRARYPATH PATHPATHXAPPLRESDIR PATHPATHusrGERSFmask application We use Fmask to process multiple adjacent Sentinel tiles When there are shadows that would go outside of the tile boundary we get edges at the tile boundary like you can see below whiteclouds greyshadows low Sun angle from southsoutheast An ideal solution would be that Fmask had an option to extend the bounds of the output mask such that all shadows are included So the southern tile in the scene below would extend north and overlap with the northern tile Then when merging the tiles we could take care of the shadows nicely If I had access to the code Id be happy to help implementing this Hi I have installed the Fmask Standalone on Ubuntu However when trying to run the Software I receive the following error error while loading shared libraries libmwlaunchermainso cannot open shared object file No such file or directory This appears to be a common error across other applications like in the below link However following these instructions I havent solved the issue Id be really grateful for some help in configuring everything correctly Thanks What are the bare minimum required files to run Fmask version on a Sentinel tile Is the entire SAFE structure necessary Dear developers I need to run fmask with clipped images Do you have anyway Thanks and regards Mateus Dear Fmask developer I am now using Fmask in the Command Prompt I want to change the default parameters according to Fmask Fmask first parameter is the number of pixels dilated for cloud default is the second parameter is the number of pixels dilated for cloud shadow default is the third parameter is the number of pixels dilated for snow default is and the last parameter is the cloud probability threshold with default value of Then it appeared that Cloudcloud shadowsnow dileted by pixels cloud probability threshold of I would like to ask what is the correct way to set up these parameters Thanks and with regards Zhongyang
