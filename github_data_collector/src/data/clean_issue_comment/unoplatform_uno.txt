RenderTransforms working on IOS and not clipping controls on Android How to reproduce it as minimally and precisely as possible Simply run the UWP head first This will show the way the transform is supposed to look like Consequently when running the Android Head one will notice that the arrow as its rotated the top half gets clipped On IOS one will notice that the arrow does not translate nor do
