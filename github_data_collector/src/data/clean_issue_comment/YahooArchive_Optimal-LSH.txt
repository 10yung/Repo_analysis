Hi and thanks for a great code But one small problem is that I found it impossible to create LSH index using the most current code in your repository In CalculateHashes you try to fill in bins using standard code computing projections in form floor bias projectiondataw But the code which tries to do that accidentally have dimensions disagreement I just fixed this using slice and transpose and left the rest intact I plan to make your code run under Hadoop so if you are interested lets stay in touch line in lshpy suggests to use N data points but the create procedure python lshpy d create needs to find out the nearest neighbors for N points using brutal force ie quadratic complexity For N it would never finish I tried just N and the create procedure finishes within minute Another thing on docexampleshtml is also I believe inaccurate D N clear results for r resultsr CalculateMPLSHParametersD N dnnHist dnnBins danyHist danyBins deltaTarget r uHash uCheck end But the matlab function CalculateMPLSHParameters isnt in the repo did I miss something here I changed that line to this and worked for me resultsr CalculateLSHParameters N dnnHist dnnBins danyHist danyBins
