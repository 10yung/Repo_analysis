I think the community has moved from Gitter to Slack a few months ago This makes it official in the README Let me know if other places needs to be updated in the documentation I made up a badge with shieldio feedback welcome for the colour and copy in it Cookiecutter version Template project url Python version Operating System Windows Description The documentation in step says to use the projectslug for the GitHub repo Cookiecutter never asked me for a projectslug Should this be replaced with reponame Cookiecutter version Template project url Python version Operating System Windows Description Running cookiecutter from the cmd prompt crashes on Windows because it cant find the git command which isnt output in an error message just a traceback The documentation should be updated to specify to run it from the git bash instead on windows What Ive run cookiecutter ghaudreyrcookiecutterpypackage File c users joe appdata local programs python python lib subprocesspy line in

code changes but for old system goes to release Huge code change proposals goes to for discussionvalidation OutdatedNot related issues should be closed Two weeks ago I was given full permissions to this repository as well as to readthedocs and pypy I see that there is a very small interest in this project from developers so several things will be changed soon This is an announcement about these changes At the Sunday version will be released to pypy It will be the current master with maybe some notcode related changes This will be the last release with full code reviews from several core committers Just because it delays development The final release of x expected on December Only bugfixes for will be reviews at this time New year plan The history of this project shows two things It is selffull at this moment Ie it does the thing that supposes to do at this moment All problems have some kinds of workarounds Waiting for a sponsor is noneffective So the decision Lets make something new With honor and respect to the past From January st and later master branch will include new changes that can be noncompatible with the old version but should introduce new functions Fixes for the old version will be included in new releases of x but only bugfixes for confirmed bugs will be included All new development should be made in the new version x Contributors list for versions x and x will be separated in the documentation Templates links will be removed from the main master page as we cannot control templates live and security I will try to create issue at every template branch how to implement correct keywords for GitHub search Most of the issues and pull requests will be closed or merged to without waiting for contributors Only live work should be at issuespr page Feel free to comment on this issue Every thought will be included in the development plan
