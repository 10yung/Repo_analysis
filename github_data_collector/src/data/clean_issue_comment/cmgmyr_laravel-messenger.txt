So far this is the nicest solution that Ive come up with but it only successfully runs on mysql which isnt ideal and is why I have the test deactivated sqlite I also ran locally with postgresql and failed As an alternative the MySQL query that successfully runs is mysql SELECT DISTINCT threadid FROM participants a WHERE userid IN AND EXISTS SELECT FROM participants b WHERE athreadid bthreadid GROUP BY threadid HAVING COUNTDISTINCT userid GROUP BY threadid HAVING COUNTthreadid but this is a beast to try and run within the scope and Eloquent Im just posting this here to see if anyone else has any ideas or wants to take a crack at it Ill keep pushing tomorrow Hello It appears for me while trying to use default betweenScope located in Thread model it doesnt work as expected For example Threadbetween will return all the Threads where users with ids and are participating Instead it should return the only chat with users with these ids Am i the one who is facing this issue Can you provide some ideas how to manage this Thanks in advance Please leave a comment explaining how you are using this package How many users are you supporting What type of features have you had to implement to extend the base functionality of this package V of this package is in the works so any feedback will be helpful when developing the new version If you have any issues please open up a new ticket Please keep this thread for feedback only Thanks
