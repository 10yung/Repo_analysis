 optional print logical data type I use latexTable to generate some tables for my PhD thesis which should be written according to a common standard in Brasil known as ABNT According to such standard the main table caption should be placed on top of the caption In addition there should also be a second caption informing the source from which the table data was drawn For that I added the parameters matlab Enables the second caption inputEnableSecondCaption The text of the second caption inputsecondCaption Source where the data came from Places the main caption on top of the table if empty the placement is set to bottom inputCaptionPlacement top Example matlab inputdata NaN inputCaptionPlacement top inputEnableSecondCaption inputsecondCaption Source random data latex latexTableinput Output latex begintable centering captionMyTableCaption begintabularccc hline hline hline hline hline endtabular captionSource random data labeltableMyTableLabel endtable Add option to use longtable package which spreads long tables over multiple pages Add corresponding example case Example of generated tex and PDF from the new example Example are attached LongTabletxt LongTablepdf Instead of using the article document class on this line you could use the following LaTeX code documentclass croptrue standalone The standalone document class with the crop option set to true will create nicely cropped documents that can be easily used elsewhere I think the purpose of latexTable when making an entire LaTeX document is not to create an A document because this possibly contains a lot of whitespace Cropping the documents is a great solution to this problem See also Usage of the standalone class
