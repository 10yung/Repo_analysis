I hate to duplicate closed issue but it seems to be a common problem Somehow the one I have is different from everyone elses Ive found online My issue is perfectly described here I am running Seafile CE docker image with port exposed on port of the host I dont use SSL as I run this instance locally But for some reason avatart address points to https instead of http So far Ive tried every solution for missing avatars that Ive found on forum and github SERVICEURL is set correctly to We are running seafile and our users complained about getting error Internal error when uploading files using the web interface It seems that there is a problem only with files with diacritic in names For example estn prohl en doc Files without diacritic are not affected Also files uploaded using seafile client are uploaded correctly This error is reported in the seahublog seahubapi endpointsrepofileuploadedbytes get Failed to get upload temp file path from db And following can be tracked in seafilelog commonseafdbc Error exec prep stmt mysqlstmtexecute failed Illegal mix of collations latin swedishciIMPLICIT and utf generalciCOERCIBLE for operation The various notifications that appear in the firefox browser are sometimes false When saving a text or makedown file from the firefox browser The first notification of saving is ok green and the following ones are either orange or even red with a message telling us the file is not saved although it has been saved I cant find this notification error in the chromium browser Hi Running seafilemc from your official Docker image latest version For some files the file history doesnt load The only log about this event is in seahublog WARNING seahubviews filerevisions Wrong type of suffixlist None I would be happy to help investigate Imho it would still be preferable to have the build instructions within the repository so they always match the commit when checking out an older version Internal Server Error seahublog ERROR seahubapi endpointsdepartments get CcnetAPI object has no attribute listalldepartments I m trying to use the api for creating a folder I m always getting the following error About to connect to examplecom port Trying examplecom Connected to examplecom examplecom port POST api reposLIBIDdirpTEST HTTP UserAgent curl Host examplecom Authorization Token Accept applicationjson charsetutf indent ContentLength ContentType applicationxwwwformurlencoded upload completely sent off out of bytes HTTP Forbidden Server nginx Date Fri Dec GMT ContentType applicationjson charsetutf indent ContentLength Connection keepalive Vary Accept AcceptLanguage Cookie ContentLanguage en Allow GET POST DELETE HEAD OPTIONS detail Authentication credentials were not provided Connection to host examplecom left intact Here is my cURL command curl d operationmkdir v H Authorization Token H Accept applicationjson charsetutf indent I created a token before using curl k d usernameMAIL passwordSECRET Which give me a valid token I was able to create a lib using the API As per title When generating a password protected share link the users own account password is prefilled by default Tested with Seafile Pro but worked the same in every prior version I have personally used I do not think this is a sane or reasonable default as it makes it easy for registered users to leak their password Instead a randomlygenerated password new diceroll for every share link should be prefilled by default Additionally a copy password link would be nice to have as currently the only way to get the password in a copyable form after using the password generator feature is to have it mailed to yourself which is unnecessarily cumbersome and potentially insecure ppa for eoan is not available in
