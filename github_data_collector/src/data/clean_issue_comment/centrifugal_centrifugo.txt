Hi Im trying to implement my custom authroiztion process with cetrifugo using connect proxy Private channel API says that I have to add channel to JWT claime named channel if I want to allow user subscribe to them But how can I achieve it using proxy I dont see such a field in connect proxy result description How can I give access to multiple channels Should I separate it with comma or pass an array of strings or what Thanks This is a proof of concept of using Nats server instead of Redis for PUBSUB part of Centrifugo I am still considering is it worth adding this or not any feedback is welcome Ive noticed that the new version of Centrifugo supports Graphite and Prometheus for publishing metrics What do you think about adding support for Cloudwatch as well I think that most Centrifugo users run it in AWS Before there was a stats endpoint but in the new version its no longer available What do you think about recovering that endpoint This will make integration with another metrics system easier PS Now Im parsing Prometheus metrics to publish them to Cloudwatch I would like to use the Centrifugo project but didnt find endpoint to be notified about inner system events There is a channel info and server stats but it is not a good way to collect metrics in a sync manner through making request to API every second for example Is there any way to collect the connectiondisconnectionetc events with lets say redis or other pubsub broker We need them to control channels by our backend It would be great to have an example for a client in the applicationgo there is a hook into the engine engine to use in memory or redis engine Engine I have am using NSQ as well as NATS These are both golang based message queues NSQ has storage At the moment i use NSQ for microservices and large application You can string together micro service libraries without having to get into the HTTP Request Response stuff but instead just passing messages with body payloads of data between them The other thing is that NATS and NSQ dont have great support for interacting with the Web client Or mobiel client and so Centrifo would get allot of support if it integrated with these well used MQ libds like NSQ and NATS Just an idea at this stage and i have not had a chance to look at the interface that woudl need to be supported Oh and lastly NSQ and NATS are both in the process of getting a Discovery Service integration so that they can run on large Kubernetes clusters Each Server has a MQ daemon running with it There are many lookup daemons that know all the MQ daemons and the topics and channels they all use So at the code level you can ask for the topic and publish to it and not have to know anything about what or where that other server is Basically in summary NSQ and NATs will allow Centrigio to scale out on clouds much easier I knwo Redis can also scale out on k kubernettes but its no as decoupled is my point
