 Hi I am writing a SF applicaiton where I want to use the SetupEntryPoint to perform some admin actions at service deployment time I am in a dev cluster However that fails and in the fabrictraces I see the following sequence of events Information myappnamehere App Creating user token AccountWFHmIbBRXsuyVLSTv AccountType LocalUser Warning LogonUser failed for WFHmIbBRXsuyVLSTv ErrorCode x Warning myappnamehere App Create user token AccountWFHmIbBRXsuyVLSTv AccountType LocalUser error x Warning EndService Activate ErrorCode x Service Id a b ef ba e a ExeName Setupbat x is Logon failure the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer Looking at the Fabric sources it looks like this is coming from LocalUserCreateLogonTokenout AccessTokenSPtr userToken where logon type is coming from LocalUserCreateLogonToken where its like so DWORD logonType thisperformInteractiveLogon LOGON LOGONINTERACTIVE LOGON LOGONNETWORKCLEARTEXT I suspect that performInteractiveLogon is false in this context so LOGON LOGONNETWORKCLEARTEXT is the forbidden logon type This is probably caused by the security policies in my company I will open a ticket with our security about that but in the meantime can somebody confirm what logon type is actually supposed to happen my reading of the code above is possibly wrong is it possible to say see what security policies are influencing this The ClearAsync method is part of the IReliableCollection interface but is not yet implemented for the DistributedQueue Instead it throws a NotImplementedException Vision Rationale With WSL fast approaching GA and with support for development scenarios using VS Codes Remote WSL extension consider adding to Service Fabric the ability to orchestrate multiple WSL Linux Docker containers per node on Windows clusters The benefits of this feature would be numerous for example full compatibility for Docker Linux Containers running on existing Windows clusters and alongside Windows workloads WSL containers would be perfect for running trusted workloads whilst LCOW would be more suited to running untrusted container workloads in their own VM The most recent commit on this repository was several months ago Will this repository ever be updated with the latest service fabric code I have just a simple hopefully question around using the Actor model Is there any current known issues around memory leaks when using it I have been told that there is a significant issue with memory leakage over time if we use it Scenario When I hit my services through the localhost applicationPath it seems like that the Reverse Proxy tries to forward requests to the remote node as well I assume If we have NSGs configured to deny one of the services port for instance such requests may ended up with timeout issue see below or the response becomes very slow up to mins but localhostservicePort responses instantly Workaround make sure that services traffic is not denied between the node types So does the reverse proxy also act as an internal load balancer Sorry for may be silly question but I havent found any detailed description of the reverse proxy flowarchitecture Error Forwarding request to service failed retrying with reresolve phase SendRequestHeaders error internal error ERRORWINHTTPTIMEOUT I guess it happens when the reverse proxy forwards the request to the remote node and when the timeout is reached redirects the request to the localhost finally and service web app opens A bit strangebut I dont have other explanation why NSGs have impact hereI thought localhost is localhost Environment Azure Service Fabric Cluster node types seedsecondary stateless applications Reverse Proxy HTTP I am a Service Fabric fan and I am working on preparing for I am very surprised to see that ASF is not in the exam syllabus There is AKS and containers and stuff but not ASF So what is the idea behind that Will Microsoft be dropping support to ASF and moving to Docker Kubernetes I am also learning ASF so please let me know whether ASF will be sunset The guidance located here describes how one creates a selfsigned certificate installs it to the VMs in the cluster and how secrets must be encrypted using the same certificate However the certificate I created with this approach has a oneyear expiration How does one roll secrets to use with a new certificate in a years time Would all secrets have to be regenerated and the secret values redeployed with the new cert Presently the Service Fabric object at resourcesazurecom the ARM template the Powershell certificate update script and undoubtedly all the other uses all point to using Azure Key Vaults secrets capability Opening the secrets in the portal yields a deprecated warning urging users to utilize the certificate functionality instead likely because the secrets cant be imported if theyre protected with passwords This leads to the odd process of generating a cert from my CA uploading it to the Key Vault certificates with its password downloading it from there as a PEM no longer with a password and reuploading into the Key Vault secrets where I can finally reference it in the various Service Fabric contexts Is there any timeline on being able to simply utilize Key Vault certificates instead
