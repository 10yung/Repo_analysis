Hi what is the current status of this project Is it still actively maintained Adding just picturefill doesnt seem to work for my case Im using picturefill with react and Gatsbyjs I see that using pfmutations should make it work If I include this file in my site though I get an error in IE Unhandled promise rejection TypeError Assignment to readonly properties is not allowed in strict mode Is there something else I need to do to make it work in IE Images in chrome are not loading ONLY when I emulate a mobile deviceall devices Images seems to load fine when i resize the browser and visit the site from real mobile devices Noticed this issue only happening in chrome Seems to work fine with emulated devices in both firefox and IE edge This is caused because of the images are downloaded as jp extension even when the image from the server is sending as jpg Out of all images on my site only images load with jpg and rest with jp here is the code source srcsetdata largeimage mediaminwidth px img classimgresponsive srcsetdata smallimage stylewidth What is causing the images to load with jp and how do i fix this issue Thanks Hello I am really struggling to get this to work Here is how I import the script import picturefill from picturefill Here is my html picture if IE video styledisplay none endif source srcsetstaticguywebp mediaminwidth px typeimagewebp source srcsetstaticguypng mediaminwidth px if IE video endif img srcsetstaticguypng altimage desc picture And since I am using vuejs in the mounted its being executed when the DOM is rendered method i have the following mounted picturefill And here is the full error which I am getting Failed parsing srcset attribute value since it has an unknown descriptor Dropped srcset candidate staticguywebp Any ideas what I am doing wrong Thanks Hi I am using NextJS react ssr and tried to use your package There is an issue when trying to use it as it uses the window object How can I make it work in SSR Thanks seems to be two years oldthe page says Unfortunately adding a src attribute with an external source to the img element in your picture element isnt a good workaround either as any browser that exists today will fetch that src url even if it is not going to be used Is it still the case Hey I noticed that picturefill gets M hits per month on jsDelivr so I thought you might like this badge I set up picture fill example this way picture if IE video styledisplay none endif source srcsetresourcestextcloud png mediamaxwidth px and minresolution dpi if IE video endif img srcsetresourcesbeetle jpg altSome alt text picture The img is loading beetle even when browser size is below the css width on retina desktop Why wouldnt the source image textcloud be used Hi Some of the images included with the source of this project contain embedded ICC profiles which are copyrightprotected and lack a Free license Specifically these images are currently not legally free to redistribute examplesimagesartlargejpg examplesimagesartmediumjpg examplesimagesartsmalljpg examplesimagesextralargejpg examplesimagesextralargepsd examplesimagesimage psd examplesimagesimage psd examplesimageslargepsd examplesimagesmediumjpg examplesimagesmediumpsd examplesimagessmalljpg examplesimagessmallpsd logosbocouplgpng logosricgsealpng examplesimagespiclargepng examplesimagespicmediumpng examplesimagespicsmallpng logosbocoupsmpng The first group above contains an ICC profile owned by Hewlett Packard and the latter two groups contain ICC profiles owned by Apple Most likely I didnt check more detailed those ICC profiles are all sRGB profiles which can simply be stripped since for web use sRGB is the default color profile One way to inspect image files for embedded ICC profiles and its metadata is by use of the commandline tool exiftool installed as part of the Perl distribution ImageExifTool ie on Debianbased systems by installing the package libimageexiftoolperl and on Debian and other systems by running cpanm ImageExifTool I am attempting a patch to enable FLIF support picture source typeimageflif when I detect the FLIF type and a supported browser I bail out of picturefill and instantiate PolyFLIF Its a work in progress still not perfect do you think my patch may end up in the official repo FLIF has its own singlefile multiresolution responsive approach FLIF and Responsive Web Design
