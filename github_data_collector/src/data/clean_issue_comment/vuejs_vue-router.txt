 Version Reproduction link Steps to reproduce Refresh page at the active class works fine Refresh page at the active class is not applied What is expected Active class on the router link What is actually happening No active class is applied The active class is not even applied when the params is encoded eg Finally the active class is applied when you click on router links even with non ASCII char The only problem is at the first load of the page generated by vueissues DO NOT REMOVE Please make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines What problem does this feature solve In order to split large project into modules I and someone else is looking for a method for dynamically routing And Ive code them may I make a pull request Here is the commit What does the proposed API look like They are identified by route path Remove route Remove route which matches path pathto and all its children routes javascript routerremoveRoutepathto Replace routes Replace route pathto and more javascript routerreplaceRoutes path pathto component NewComponent something else more replacement generated by vueissues DO NOT REMOVE Hi First contributor pretty new to Vue This PR adds ariacurrentpage to active links and resolves I made the following two choices Use ariacurrentpage over other token values The original issue mentions allowing custom token values or future routerlink extension possibilities That still seems useful but ariacurrentpage seems like the right choice at least of the time The other tokens are either much less common eg step or unlikely to be used with a router at all eg date Use the activeClass logic over only applying it to the exact active route This is more handwavy but seems like the better choice URL params shouldnt necessarily affect ariacurrent and its not the worst thing to have parent routes also receive ariacurrent if exact is not applied Im hoping this is a small enough change that it can go in before the harder work of figuring out how to extend routerlink is done and it seems like a sensible default even with customization Ive run into some issues using vuerouter bc of this so Id personally love to see ariacurrent added Im happy to answer any questions on the accessibility side and let me know if I missed anything PRwise Thanks Please make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines Reason I had issues getting this to work with the examples in the doc as currently written It wasnt until I found this answer on Stack Overflow where things became clear Admittedly Im not well versed in Apache but I figured these amendments might better serve others in the future Per the Stack Overflow answer it seems there was a related Vue Forum discussion which tells me the scenario is not uncommon What changed I added a few specifics to the Apache example in historymodemd and removed the trailing in the RewriteBase example for subfolders These adjustments mirror how I was able to get my application working when building to a different base path and deploying to Apache This PR improves the way router errors are thrown router errors types have been created NavigationDuplicated NavigationCancelled NavigationRedirected NavigationAborted Before Uncaught in promise undefined After Uncaught in promise Error NavigationAborted Navigating to location fooaborty has been aborted at eval basejs at eval appjs at iterator basejs at step asyncjs at step asyncjs at runQueue asyncjs at HashHistoryconfirmTransition basejs at HashHistorytransitionTo basejs Fix an issue where page browsing to a route and then reloading leads to inconsistent parameters and fullPath values What problem does this feature solve I am trying to create a button within a routerlink that shows a loading indicator when clicked but still allows opening in a new tab which should not show a loading indicator It would be nice if navigateevent in the vslot API could return a promise when it performs a pushreplace so that I could stop the loading animation when the route fails to load or succeeds just like routerpushreplaceto does Right now the only way to do this in my app is to implement a programmatic push or replace call which does not allow opening in a new tab Thank you so much What does the proposed API look like navigatee returns a Promise the result of push or replace if either of those functions are called within navigatee If neither is called return nothing generated by vueissues DO NOT REMOVE What problem does this feature solve I want to do javascript try await routerpush catch e if e instanceof NavigationDuplicated else throw e Unfortunately I cant because NavigationDuplicated is not exported What does the proposed API look like export NavigationDuplicated generated by vueissues DO NOT REMOVE
