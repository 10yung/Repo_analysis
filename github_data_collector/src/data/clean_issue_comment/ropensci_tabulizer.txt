Please specify whether your issue is about a possible bug X a question about package functionality a suggested code or documentation change improvement to the code or feature request I believe that this is an issue with the underlying java library but since Im using tabulizer Im posting here and will link there I have a file with two tables that look generally identical but they extract very differently Is there a reason that the table on page extracts with multiple lines in a cell and the one on page that visually looks the same extracts with one value per cell like I would prefer r

Please specify whether your issue is about a possible bug a question about package functionality x a suggested code or documentation change improvement to the code or feature request Thanks for this great package It works well for me I would like to use the columns argument in extracttables but I dont really know how to find the coordinates separating my columns It would be great if you could implement a function similar to locateareas that instead of defining the areas of the tables allows the user to determine the coordinates separating columns Are there any plans for implementing this functionality When working with the current version of R and rJava there is a warning with extracttable indicating WARNING An illegal reflective access operation has occurred WARNING Illegal
