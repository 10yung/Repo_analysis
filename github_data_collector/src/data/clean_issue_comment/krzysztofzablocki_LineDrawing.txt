Do you know if anyone have attempted to port this to swift If not I can probably do it cocos dh file not found heart after changing line color drawing next line shows square in last cgpath I was using your code to draw bezier lines and I notice an issue The calculateSmoothLinePoints method is not using the very first point or the very last it only uses the midpoint This makes sense when continually drawing but when drawing for example only three points over a long span it misses a large part of the line stopped using pan gesture recognition so as to make it easier to support multiple fingers drawing at the same time updated artwork to cocos d includes new default screen so it runs properly on iPhone Retina changed xcode project to handle iPhones
