Hi I read the troubleshooting page but couldnt find anything related to this issue I have the docker section showing all the time in my prompt no matter where I am in the filesystem What could cause this Is it because my user is part of the docker group If so can it be fixed Thanks Hi Description This PR is focused to fix The problem is caused because of this line the regular expression is invalid so when the sed command runs it throws an error and the value passed to the next pipe operator is empty because of that all the content of zshrc file is deleted So I fixed the invalid regex It was only a missing escape on and added some tests To test the uninstall script easily I updated the version of shunit because in the newer version exists there are two new functions assertContains and assertNotContains that helped me I have also removed some blank characters in enabling statements on installsh script otherwise the uninstall script doesnt remove the enabling statements since it doesnt I also have identified some potentials problems and improvements to the uninstall script I will leave here a list of them tput color logic is evaluated even when tput is not installed So warning messages appears in stdout USERSOURCE is defined even if unused in uninstall script uninstall script doesnt work well for ohmyzsh instructions installation on READMEmd uninstall script doesnt handle whitespaces at the beginning of each line CC Runrioter Fix Description use sed instead Screenshot Please attach a screenshot if possible screenshot url This is in reference to this issue comment Current behavior Modifying the value of SPACESHIPPROMPTDEFAULTPREFIX does not have any affect on the rendered prompt Expected behavior If set in a zshrc file a line such as zsh export SPACESHIPPROMPTDEFAULTPREFIX andor zsh export SPACESHIPRPROMPTDEFAULTPREFIX should overwrite the default value of via and any prompt sections which utilize this prefix should display the configured value Relevant Zsh configuration zshrc I have configured the value in a spaceshipconfigzsh file zsh export SPACESHIPPROMPTDEFAULTPREFIX which is sourced by my zshrc file zsh for file in p
