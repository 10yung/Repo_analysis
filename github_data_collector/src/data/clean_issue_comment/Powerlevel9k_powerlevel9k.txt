greetings my left prompt context menu is not showing at all But when Im logged in as root it shows I have the same settings for both privilege and normal user here is the image The top prompt is the normal user with no context segment The bottom is when I su l There youll see the context Below is the relevant section of the p kzsh file context userhostname Default context color typeset g

prompt and I just found that as long as virtualenv is included here POWERLEVEL KLEFTPROMPTELEMENTSvirtualenv context dir vcs virtualenv always displays no matter whether I enable ohmyzsh virtualenv plugin or not pluginsgit pip python After long time of research and greping I found that virtualenv segment is determined in powerlevel kzshtheme file promptvirtualenv local virtualenvpathVIRTUALENV z virtualenvpath return promptsegment blue DEFAULTCOLOR virtualenvpatht PYTHONICON so how virtualenv displays is pretty fixed here it is not asking any other plugin for the appearance But my system is configured a little differently so the default value is not accurate and Im not able to use my own plugin to determine how I want to display my virtual environment name is this on purpose How can I display the way I want please Describe Your Issue What is happening No icons or glyphs on my powerlevel k Have you tried to debug or fix it Have tried different fonts using urxvt terminal Tried downloading nerd fonts and installed again to see if the icons set maybe was bugged Have you tinkered with your settings and what happened when you did Did you find a bit of code that you think might be the culprit Let us know what youve done so far Environment Information This information will help us understand your configuration What version of ZSH are you using You can use zsh version to see this Do you use a ZSH framework eg OhMyZSH Antigen Yes i use ohmyZSH How did you install P k cloning the repo by tarball a package from your OS etc cloning What version of P k are you using latest Which terminal emulator do you use urxvt Issues with Fonts Icons You may delete this section if your issue is not font icon related Which font do you use Hack Bold Nerd font but i have also tried different ones Which font configuration mode are you using You can check this with echo POWERLEVEL KMODE Please share the contents of P kdebugfontissueszsh If this is an icon problem does the output of geticonnames look correct When doing a geticonnames ther is no icons On a default install of Anaconda it installs to anaconda but conda env list claims the name of the environment is base not anaconda The environment variable has the correct name First I just want to say that I am brand new to git and contributing to open source projects This might be a simple issue I want to modify the promptdir function in powerklevel kzshtheme to include more conditions to replace the icon depending of the statepath This issue is related to This can be easily done if you just add dir states and separate conditions For instance here Ive added a DROPBOXstate that uses DROPBOXICON for paths that contain dropbox almost exactly the same as the currentetc conditions save state of path for highlighting and bold options local pathoptcurrentpath typeset AH dirstates dirstates DEFAULT FOLDERICON HOME HOMEICON HOMESUBFOLDER HOMESUBICON NOTWRITABLE LOCKICON ETC ETCICON DROPBOX DROPBOXICON local statepathprint P local currentstateDEFAULT if statepath etc then currentstateETC elif POWERLEVEL KDIRSHOWWRITABLE true w PWD then currentstateNOTWRITABLE elif statepath dropbox then currentstateDROPBOX elif statepath then currentstateHOME elif statepath then currentstateHOMESUBFOLDER fi My question is how could we do this within zshrc instead of modifying powerline kzshtheme Ive seen other users utilize the customuser prompt status in zshrc to easily add icons and the like but to my knowledge there is not a customdir status to do the same thing and even so would it allow conditional formatting to icons Im just moving vcs from the left to the right Why does the prompt on the right overflow to the next line Environment Information windows wsl zsh version zsh x
