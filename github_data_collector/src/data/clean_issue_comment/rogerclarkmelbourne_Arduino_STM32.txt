Hello I interfaced a LCD to STM F C T board and no matter what I do to circuit it showed garbage text I kept changing the connection to different ports and pins but it still remain the same I literally spent hours on this The LiquidCrystal Library for STM published to arduinoIDE is buggy It shows garbage values By using this library fixed the issue Please update this in the project so that other people dont face the same issue Thanks Gunpal Jain There is a compilation warning generated that we can avoid with a cast Gday Roger I have a CooCox Embedded Pi with the above chip but no matter what I try the Arduino IDE refuses to connect with it either on my RPi or my iMac All the resources I have seen seem to point to you as the best source of information I do hope you can point me in the right direction Thanks Oh and Im not too familiar with this medium so my email is richardmellershgmailcom as that ensures that I get any replys Hi I found this problem on latest framework If if write several times in backup register with command setrtccr or setbkpdrift using this library MCU halts on second write OR If i write to backup register with command setrtccr or setbkpdrift once AND then set RTC with command rtsetTimetm MCU halts ag are you not found same problem The firmware appears to load successfully in my bluepill likely a clone or counterfeit The LED blinks after the load However all I can get to appear in device manager is USB Device Not Recognized Unknown USB Device Device Descriptor Request Failed How should I proceed I am not sure how to troubleshoot this Is the problem likely in the firmware side or the USB Driver side Normally there is no way to edit the devflags variable after Wire has been constructed It is sometimes helpful to do so though Example u g uses the builtin Wire instance to communicate with I C displays which is normally set to the standard pins Using the added functions from this PR it is possible to during setup uint t df WiregetDevFlags df I CREMAP WiresetDevFlagsdf After that u g will nicely communicate with an I C display connected to the alternate pins helloo Code with freeRTOS or pubsubclient individually working fine but when I m using both together the controller hangs unexpectedly libraries used Please help me to find reasons for RTOS hanging Thanq Sankar From my experimentation the forvolatile unsigned int i i i delay loop for the GENERICBOOTLOADER setting in variantsgenericwirishboardssetupcpp is not long enough for my Raspberry PI to recognize the switch from the bootloaders USB profile to a new USB profile I tested this in the context of my USBComposite library but the issues should be the same in the core Replacing with solves the problem Thats such a slight timing increase and normally it happens only on startup that it shouldnt bother anyone Folks Im writing after or so hours of tinkering with F FB and F RE variants I have a custom board with STM F RET Using blinkino and STLINK no maple bootloader using the STM F RB variant works fine when I switch to STM F RE blink doesnt start In fact after I flash the RE bin the CPU no longer responds to stinfo probe I then have to use openocd to unlock the processor Ive checked the linker scripts to make sure the ram and rom locations and lengths are correct Verified this in the map file The RE variant defines MCUSTM F RE which in turn defines define STM SRAMEND void x define STM HIGHDENSITY STM SRAMEND is correct for K ram defining STM HIGHDENSITY affects these files coresmapleHardwareTimercpp coresmapleHardwareTimerh coresmaplelibmapleadcf c coresmaplelibmapledmaf c coresmaplelibmaplerccf c coresmaplelibmaplespif c coresmaplelibmaplestm f performanceisrsS coresmaplelibmaplestm f performancevectortableS coresmaplelibmapletimerc coresmaplelibmapleusartf c coresmaplesdiocpp coresmapletonecpp librariesMapleCoOS examplescoosdisplayblinkSPICoOScpp librariesSPIsrcSPIcpp systemlibmapleincludelibmaplebkph systemlibmapleincludelibmaplesdioh systemlibmaplestm f includeseriesadch systemlibmaplestm f includeseriesdmah systemlibmaplestm f includeseriesspih systemlibmaplestm f includeseriesstm h systemlibmaplestm f includeseriestimerh systemlibmaplestm f includeseriesusarth systemsupportdoxygenDoxyfile Im now in the process of looking through these files to figure out my problem Any advice on where to start Thanks Craig
