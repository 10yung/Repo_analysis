Hi I dont really know if its a RetroArch bug but I only encounter it when running exiting RetroArch I know the Siri Remote is not currently supported by RetroArch but its a blocking bug when you want to use your AppleTV Description The Siri Remote tactile pad does not respond after exiting RetroArch Everything except the pad is working fine event the padclick function Expected behavior The pad needs to respond correctly Actual behavior The pad does not respond when sliding in whatever direction you want it to Steps to reproduce the bug Launch RetroArch Use it as you want in my case with a Xbox One S bluetooth controller Exit RetroArch Try to slide with the Siri Remote to another application Bisect Results I only compile the last version from what I saw the old versions does not work on tvOS VersionCommit Version Commit a b Environment information OS tvOS Compiler Xcode C Free development Apple account Other information If you want your remote to function as normal tou have to reboot your AppleTV using the Siri function or the controller which is already connected Description Changing the appearance of the menu from xmb to anything else causes Lakka to brick and requires entire reflash Expected behavior Change the appearance from xmb to anything else Actual behavior The system bricks Steps to reproduce the bug Enable advanced settings Go to drivers display or whatever its called and change xmb to another option Restart the raspberry Your device is now bricked VersionCommit You can find this information under InformationSystem Information RetroArch Environment information OS Lakka Rpi Description When Unified Menu Controls UMC are enabled Menu Toggle Combo Hotkey MTCH for gamepad other than first can exit the quick menu but cannot enter it Expected behavior When UMC and MTCH are enabled all controllers should be able to toggle the menu Actual behavior Only the first controller can enterexit the quick menu other controllers can only toggle the menu off but not on Steps to reproduce the bug Press MTCH in second gamepad nothing happens Press MTCH in first gamepad enters quick menu Press MTCH in second gamepad quits quick menu Bisect Results Unsure it is the first time I have tried toggling the menu from another controller other than Port VersionCommit RetroArch v Jan ff e Environment information OS Windows x Build v Just updated Retroarch vita and noticed the notifications you get when using savestates or when displaying FPS are different now they pop in from the bottom and seem to be very xmbish in design and that they persist even when switching back to rgui They look very out of place in rgui The fps counter seems to utilize that same notification design now having a rather large semitransparent background around it that likes to invade the game display unless downsized significantly And the fps counter is hard to resize and harder to reposition to where I want it as its not updating size or position live anymore Changes only become clear after you restart retroarch Please give an option to get them back the way they were Im sorry if I just missed a setting to revert the notifications to the old blocky yellow font but I think I checked everywhere I could check Description I think retroarch changed something on widgets which are messages text and some cores have not been updated Ive post a request here but they write me to post here and thats a RA issue and not a CORE issue Expected behavior On some core all is fine like here HDR HDR On some other the background is missing or font is yellow or text is dark and impossible to read like on x Actual behavior The login message is always bad write in yellow HDR This message is fine in Colecovision like i show before and bad on some other like here HDR HDR But other messages like this on SNES are fine HDR On x the widget background is fine but the font in black and impossible to read x Dracula Steps to reproduce the bug Launch a game on these systems Try to make a Savestate or a Screenshot so see a Widget Bisect Results I dont know but for exemple with the old Vice there is no problem VersionCommit RetroArch Environment information OS Linux with Batocera Scanning content to create a playlist hangs Normal or manual Every version since I believe has had this issue Retroarch is still responsive just the dialog never moves passed scanning content and nothing ever results from attempting this action I have had to find a workaround by creating the playlist on other systems such as WiiU and Switch and manually editing the paths with replace all in notepad before playing them on my PS system When the paths are all correct this works however a similar issue still pops up when attempting to edit the associated core I believe the underlying problem might have something to do with access to the playlists system path on the ps within retroarch It has read access the issues seems to arise when it attempts to write anything to those files Description This is somewhat similar to in concept but I believe distinct as it relates explicitly to the viewport and integer scales rather than to arbitrary zooming on the image Certain platforms dont have ideal integer scaling resolutions to suit all displays One example is the NTSC Sega GenesisMega Drive which displays lines of usable signal On a p screen the Integer Scale option will scale this to x leaving a huge unused lines or of the displays total height Switching over to a custom aspect ratio and adjusting manually its possible to scale to x losing lines of the total viewport height or just Mega Drive scanlines off the top and bottom of the screen Using a custom aspect ratio does not adequately resolve this issue because cores like Genesis Plus GX cover multiple platforms each with different resolutions and aspect ratios I suppose you could work around these limitations using content directory overrides but that seems like a fairly complicated and fiddly solution that requires overrides for every system you want to use this feature on Expected behavior Id like to see an option to set a maximal resolution for integer scaling distinct from the actual screen resolution eg a user with a display might set things up as follows Integer scaling On Maximum width Maximum height Aspect ratio anything except Custom Now integer scaling will use the nearest integer scale that fits into that range and since is youll get a centered x integer scale on the vertical Note I do imagine maximum width would be almost completely useless most of the time since users are far more likely to be constrained on the vertical simply because there arent many older games with widescreen aspect ratios but there are occasional cases where it would still be nice to have This feature could be hidden behind the Advanced Options toggle to avoid cluttering the Video configuration tab if desired Actual behavior With integer scaling enabled and without using a custom aspect ratio RetroArch currently rounds down to the nearest integer scale that fits into the screens resolution with no option to round up in edge cases where that might be more desirable sometimes resulting in a heavily windowboxed image Currently my selfbuilds of retroarchffmpeg arent detecting libx for some reason will address in another issue if necessary On newer retroarch builds attempting to start recording with that being the case causes a segfault Expected behavior At worst an error message occurs Gameplay continues Actual behavior Full retroarch crash via segmentation fault Steps to reproduce the bug Start a game Enter the quick menu Press Start Recording without the requested codec available Bisect Results efa a bf c d cb f f f f c f is the first bad commit Environment information OS Mint kernel generic x Compiler GCC bit EDIT Missing codec was caused by selfcompiled ffmpeg not being compiled with those codecs supported Thats been resolved now When pausing the emulator using either the Pause Toggle menu item in the Command menu or enabling the config option to pause emulation while in the background main menuSettingsUser InterfaceDont Run in Background then leaving everything in the paused state for an extended period of time exact time unknown but at least an hour if not several causes the whole program to completely stop running No errors or other messages are shown in the log console when this happens Pause the emulator Change focus to another window or minimize the RetroArch window for a long time Switch back to the RetroArch window RetroArch window cant be interacted with beyond minimizingmaximizing and must be killed OS Windows x RetroArch but have seen this issue as well with and The Beetle PSX HW Core keeps crashing when using the
