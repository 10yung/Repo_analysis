There are several strange behaviors when trying to tests array values from the array asserter An example Ive just fixed see The thisarrayeventfieldsstring name containsCopy of s should have fail because the name is Copy of test event to clone Most strange is I have the same code working and not working on different glpi branches but the same atoum php etc versions I still cannot explain that In GLPI team several person incluging myself already has quite strange issues with assertions on array values but I cannot give more details nor always reproducible use case right now There are

includer test fail error on unit test TO check mock generation with typed propertie mock generation with covariant preloading activationdisactivation mock generation does we need to add some asserter for the custom serialization attributes does we need to add some asserter for the ffi see I think we should change a bit the behavior on the mock For now if we want to change the behavior of it we need to do what the visibility extension do replace the mock generator with a child class This doesnt allow atoum to be extended multiple time or you need to deal with conflict of multiple extension doing the same Example the extension that I have not publish for this reason about trait is become a bit harder because of this reason So did you have any idea how we can improve a bit our mock engine to allow theses change and make it extendable Thanks see if the directory where to put reports and the one with our code is the same our project is deleted so a check should be made Adapt readme put in evidence the link to documentation add the convention of atoum in it see
