just try it Apparently default infinite scrolling views activity indicator view does not show when enter trigger state It only shows when enter loading state This commit fix the problem by manually set hidden property to NO when updating state of infinite scrolling view Why we cant use direction SVInfiniteScrollingDirectionTop in swift version Can you help to fix error support the problem I really need your library to load more chat Can I replace the image that is refreshed by the dropdownCan I replace the image that is refreshed by the dropdown Just like text you can set the substitution I changed code to remove deprecated code from iOS Can you use it for a wkwebview Thank you I try this but dont work webviewscrollViewaddPullToRefresh selfgetRequesturlview selfurlview Because infinite scrolling views height is pt user can scroll to the mid of the infinite scroll view In this situation state is triggered all the time and not to be loading even if user leave his finger from the screen I think the reason is that when the last scrollViewDidScroll is triggered isDragging is still true not false Then when user leaves his finger scrollViewDidScroll will not be called voidscrollViewDidScrollCGPointcontentOffset ifselfstate SVInfiniteScrollingStateLoading selfenabled CGFloat scrollViewContentHeight selfscrollViewcontentSizeheight CGFloat scrollOffsetThreshold scrollViewContentHeightselfscrollViewboundssizeheight ifselfscrollViewisDragging selfstate SVInfiniteScrollingStateTriggered selfstate SVInfiniteScrollingStateLoading else ifcontentOffsety scrollOffsetThreshold selfstate SVInfiniteScrollingStateStopped selfscrollViewisDragging selfstate SVInfiniteScrollingStateTriggered else ifcontentOffsety scrollOffsetThreshold selfstate SVInfiniteScrollingStateStopped selfstate SVInfiniteScrollingStateStopped scrollOffsetThreshold should consider originalBottomInset So I think scrollOffsetThreshold selforiginalBottomInset should be inserted after CGFloat scrollOffsetThreshold scrollViewContentHeightselfscrollViewboundssizeheight Otherwise when scrollview has bottom inset supposed its a positive number and it currently reaches to the end state will still be loading even though user scrolls up I used SVPullToRefresh long time ago Now I have a Swift project having pulltorefreshinfinityload feature I remember SVPullToRefresh But what surprised me is that this useful library isnt ported to Swift Why dont you want to port to Swift This exposes the originalBottomInset property of SVInfiniteScrollingView I used this in a project where I needed to show hide the keyboard over an infinite scrolling view and wanted to adjust the bottom scroll inset to make room for the keyboard
