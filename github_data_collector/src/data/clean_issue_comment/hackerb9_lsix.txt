Currently lsix displays labels if I dont want to Would be nice to add a flag like nolabels to remove them so Ill see images only Lsix still not working for me on Fedora even using xterm ti vt command Screenshot from Originally posted by bkdwt in As described in title This adds preliminary support for terminal multiplexers tmux screen The wrapped escape code passes through the terminal multiplexer so that the terminal can respond Escape codes meant for the terminal have to be piped through muxwrap Positional escape codes probably should be directed to the multiplexer You can test the function in a sixel capable terminal with and without tmuxscreen like this after defining the muxwrap function in the terminal by copy pasting printf Pq vv GG muxwrap The functionality of lsix is unchanged and you have to figure out where to wrap the escape codes I needed this for thought this could help here too The escape codes have to be wrapped multiple times for nested tmuxscreen sessions Supposedly it should detect bg colour but this is what I get lsix in xterm bg Heres my Xresources After installed xterm and ImageMagick lsix shows nothing about thumnail images Anything I can do about this Thanks While this is likely true it would be great to see WSL support and maybe someone has figured it out Thanks txt Error Your terminal does not appear to support sixel graphics Please use a sixel capable terminal such as xterm ti vt or ask your terminal manufacturer to add sixel support If your terminal actually does support sixel please file a bug report at When I use lsix I would expect the images to display after my current line and for that display to be persistent Thats not what happens The images show up at the top of my terminal one line at a time over the text that exists there and then disappears leaving the terminal intact ie it does not replace the text it just displays the images like an overlay above the text Is this due to lsix or is it due to my terminal Im using wsltty on Windows please package your code as a homebrew cask and provide installation instructions
