Hi I know this is a common issue but unfortunately none of the previous solutions seem to be able to help my issue I recently made a fresh install of miniconda Py on Windows bit and I cant get nbconvert to work when converting a notebook to pdf I used anacondaclean so it should be a clean install and hopefully no interactions with lingering packages etc I think these are all the relevant

but adding it made no difference so I would rather not add it unless necessary I do have MiKTeX in my PATH and when I type xelatex into the command promptminiconda prompt it recognises the command The only odd thing is that in the command prompt echo PATH returns Miniconda whereas it doesnt in Git Bash Otherwise they are the same Ive included the start of each for reference Could this have

the notebook Could this be a problem related to nbconvert Could you give some suggestions to solve it Thanks Description During conversion to a file that is outside the current directory supporting files are saved to an incorrect directory Can you list steps to reproduce this issue Suppose testipynb contains an image in that case the following command runs without any problems the supporting files are correctly placed in testfiles folder jupyter nbconvert to markdown output testmd codetestipynb However running the following command will result in an error jupyter nbconvert to markdown

PythonExporter that it can take a config parameter but it doesnt say what type of object its supposed to be It took a lot of digging on my part to figure out its supposed to be a traitletsconfigConfig instance place found in docs It would be nice to put that information in the docstrings of all the applicable methods It would make that functionality more friendly to newcomers Description The a on

used to determine the failure of cell execution which referred to the following trunk of code That is to say nbconvert considers a cell to be failed if a kernel sends an error message through ioPub OR if the kernel returns executereply with a status of error In the meantime papermill only uses error message not executereply I believe executereply should be the only message used because this is how Jupyter behaves with Run all cells That is to say papermill should stop if a kernel sends an executereply with error status but without an error message and neither papermill nor nbconvert should stop if a kernel sends an error message and an executereply message with ok status My argument for the latter is that a kernel might want to sends an error message to demonstrates or document an error and still returns an executereply with an ok status so that the document could be executed successfully in batch mode Description nbconvert debug now prints all of the notebook content to the screen in and maybe some versions after this was not the case Here is an old travis job with I convert notebooks there and now on Travis the output is extremely long especially since I have numerous embedded images in the notebooks Is there any reason that the raw text of the notebooks has to be printed on debug logging It makes the debug option less useful when you have to wade through of noise Can you
