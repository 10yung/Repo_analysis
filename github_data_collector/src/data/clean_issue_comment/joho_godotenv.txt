Commit ab ec added a regexp for variable substitution but the pattern only matches digits and upper case letters Why not lower case letters too I see earlier code only supported upper case too I added az to the pattern and it made the package work on my env variables and did not break any of the unit tests Turns out all the unit tests are for upper case variables so far The go package doesnt have problems with lower case or mixed case variables nor does bash If this is intentional perhaps a comment in the README stating only upper case are supported for canonical reasons or something like that Should go without saying but just in case nice package Thanks for making it available to the go community Fixes Using syscallExec makes the process tree simpler and is useful when you want the child process to handle the signal For example the direnv program internally uses syscallExec How about it I get the error EXTRA osPathErroropen env no such file or directory when I dont include any arguments in Load My env file is called localenv It works if I hardcode Loadlocalenv I stick my localenv in the same directory as my maingo Any ideas on what Im doing wrong Thank you Hi joho Ive added LoadString function to load string when I want to set environment variables from string In the case that Im deploying my service I dont want to set env file on Dockerfile Im currently using AWS parameter store It returns a string value like below FIRSTENVthis is first value SECRETVALUEthis is secret value So I need to load from string and add a function to support that Please check this PR soon Thank you introduced a change that meant substitution of variables from the real environment ie not that derived from env itself was possible It looks like removed this behaviour in particular the deletion of osLookupEnv Unfortunately it isnt clear from the PR if that was intended Any chance someone can clarify now test osGetenvTESTINT test test feature test godotenvGetPanicTESTINT test panicTESTINT int value test err godotenvGetIntNATStest test err nil env TESTINTS list value test godotenvGetsPanicTESTINTS test panicTESTINTS test godotenvGetIntsPanicTESTINTS test panicTESTINTS Hi Ive added support for substitutions for global env vars I shouldve mentioned in that itd conflict with Didnt actually break anything but it wasted some CPU cycles Signedoffby Dave Henderson dhendersongmailcom Its time to support go modules Because I dont love having to change import path on breaking changes theres a bit of a TODO list Must do x Fix Fix Add Actually make the go module file Maybe Change behaviour in Add
