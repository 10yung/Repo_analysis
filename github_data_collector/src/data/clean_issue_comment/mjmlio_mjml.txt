Dear all Thank you for this amazing framework first of all I am trying to inline buttons but cant do it correctly Somehow I cant apply a section inside a section to then add columns there This is the final result I want to achieve inside the yellow box Do you have any suggestions Thank you in advance for the help Describe the bug I did yarn upgrade of mjml dependencies and suddenly all img alt src turned into img alt src in the output Is this an intended change Will this shorthand alt attribute be valid for all email clients I run mjml with configkeepComments configvalidationLevelstrict configbeautifyfalse arguments To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Create a file with this MJML code mjmlmjbodymjtextimg alt src mjtextmjbodymjml Render it to HTML by doing mjml configkeepComments configvalidationLevelstrict configbeautifyfalse MJML environment please complete the following information OS MacOS MJML Version MJML tool used mjml cli Added usemap attribute to image tag It can be used with map tag inside of the mjraw component Hi i found a problem on Outlook windows Outlook windows On each main tables a gap displays It works well on other platform How can i fix it MJML tool used Email editor on Mailjet website Platform used to test the email EOA Screenshots img width alttest src Thanks Fixes mjmlmjml This is to fix outlook bug I have no idea why but it just ignore backgroundcolor at top div Bug description So it really is just a mistake in the docs or maybe an unintended behaviour of the code but the docs of mjtext say fontweight is supposed to be a number while it actually can also be a string like bold for example just like in the browser So I guess the docs need to be adjusted to reflect that behaviour Steps to reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Create a file with this MJML code mjml mjbody mjsection mjcolumn mjtext fontweightbold Bold text mjtext mjcolumn mjsection mjbody mjml Preview the result Text is bold MJML environment OS MacOS MJML Version MJML tool used MJML App Describe the bug Docs Basic layout example Social Icons includes By default every social network is enabled To disable some of them just use their names as an attribute with a false value This wording is not consistent with Docs Standard Body components mjmlsocial which mentions nothing similar I asked Cedric about it in Slack DM He indicated Actually this comment seems to refer to the use of mjsocial in mjml where you had to specify which networks you wanted directly in the mjsocial attributes To Reproduce Docs Basic layout example Social Icons Expected behavior Delete the subject text The paragraph would now read The MJML standard components library comes with a mjsocial component Here were going to use facebook only MJML environment please

Additional context not applicable Describe the bug Reported by audio on Thu mjmlslackcomarchivesC HESC Gp general channel Anyone know anything about the mjherocontent component mentioned in comment in the mjhero docs Its not mentioned anywhere else in the docs To Reproduce second block of MJML code comment just before the only mjtext tag To add content like mjimage mjtext mjbutton use the mjherocontent component Expected behavior Response from cedric on Fri mjmlslackcomarchivesC HESC Gp Hi audio actually the mjherocontent component in no longer needed in mjml this comment should be removed from the doc MJML environment please complete the following information not applicable Email sending environmentfor rendering issues not applicable Affected email clients for rendering issues not applicable Screenshots none included Additional context none included Tag fix docsonly In Issue KempWatson reported The MJML documentation is rife with description of elementscomponents such as mjmlcolumn when the components are actually like mjcolumn There are many dozens of such incorrect references as a matter of fact every single component is mislabelled Very confusing Discussion there captures that the mjml notation is fully comfortable to MJML programmers because it matches the names of the modulescomponents they write At the same time many such modules support one or more tags supporting the mj syntax eg The mjmlbutton modulecomponent supports the mjbutton tag in the MJML language The above report captures a user perspective Yet parts of our documentation are best to use the programmers language This PR proposes places in the documentation at which to use the mj notation It intends to change each reference to an MJML tag to the mj notation recognizing the information is most directed to users It intends to not change any reference not used as a tag eg The documentation indicates no support in the mjmlcli modulecomponent for an mjcli tag It intends to not change any reference in a js or packagejson file These refer to items fully in the programmers domain
