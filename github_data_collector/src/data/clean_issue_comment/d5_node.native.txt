whats the meaning of this project Recently i tried to include the nativeh in multiple files in my project It seems tha guard headers didnt their job resulting compiling errors like below hlrfrwdrhttpservero In function nativebasedeletehandleuvhandles optnodenativenativehandleh multiple definition ofnativebasedeletehandleuvhandles tmpcctxhz Oooptnodenativenativehandleh first defined here I managed to solve these errors by myself by defining such plain functions as inline functions in order to be able to include the native many times in the same project since the guard headers ifndef etc arent enough My question is this is the correct way for solving this And if true it would be perfect if you define these as inline these functions also in nodenative project here in github The closest Ive gotten is the header output http localhost headers HTTP OK ContentLength ContentType applicationjson headers Accept AcceptEncoding gzip deflate compress Host localhost UserAgent HTTPie How do I get the HTTP verb Hello everyone I was trying to compile the project but it shows an error that i dont know how to solve This is the error danidaniportatilDocumentosnodenative make g stdgnu x g O Ilibuvinclude Ihttpparser I DLARGEFILESOURCE DFILEOFFSETBITS o webclient webclientcpp libuvlibuva httpparserhttpparsero lrt lm lpthread tmpccouJW ho In function nativebasehandleclosestdfunctionvoid lambdauvhandles operator void uvhandles const homedaniDocumentosnodenativenativehandleh undefined reference tonativebasehandleclosestdfunctionvoid lambdauvhandles FUNuvhandles tmpccouJW ho In function nativebasestreamwritestdstring const stdfunctionvoid nativeerrorlambdauvwrites int operator void uvwrites int const homedaniDocumentosnodenativenativestreamh undefined reference tonativebasestreamwritestdstring const stdfunctionvoid nativeerrorlambdauvwrites int FUNuvwrites int tmpccouJW ho In function nativenettcpconnectstdstring const int stdfunctionvoid nativeerrorlambdauvconnects int operator void uvconnects int const homedaniDocumentosnodenativenativetcph undefined reference tonativenettcpconnectstdstring const int stdfunctionvoid nativeerrorlambdauvconnects int FUNuvconnects int collect error ld returned exit status make webclient Error what is happening Thanks in advance Daniel Is there currently a way to serve static files via httpresponse libuv is a great abstraction layer replacement for libevent with a major feature being interoperability Is there a reason we are using vanilla Makefiles Ie can we migrate from our vanilla Makefile to CMakeLists Thanks for your consideration How do I setup a separate project that works with nodenative from git not from install library locations Here is what I have tried git clone mkdir routingtests cd Then I created maincpp and CMakeListstxt projectroutingtests setCMAKECXXFLAGS CMAKECXXFLAGS stdc cmakeminimumrequiredVERSION auxsourcedirectory SRCLIST addexecutablePROJECTNAME SRCLIST includedirectoriesnodenative nodenativenative includedirectoriesnodenativelibuv nodenativelibuvinclude nodenativehttpparser But unfortunately I get these errors Qt Creator screenshot How do I fix this Also are you planning on moving from vanilla Makefiles to CMake How do I work with URL routing in nodenative Eg I want to expose foo and bar to echo different things I want to implement KeepAlive support in nodenative I can easily enough set a response to tell the client that the connection should be kept alive What Im having a problem with is executing a callback when a second request comes from the client on the keptalive connection In nodejs and luvit they have an ondata callback I cant find this event in libuv so Im really asking you all if you know if nodejsluvit implement additional events beyond those which libuv provides
