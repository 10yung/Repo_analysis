Right now there is no way to manually dismiss the controller Is there any issue with making the dismiss method public Great work definitely am going to use it I need to support landscape in iPad It can be displayed correctly under the portrait but it cant be displayed correctly under the landscapeThe URBMediaFocusViewController still the size of the portrait is there any way to solve Again great work Tang Removes warning on iOS and newer No longer supports iOS How to present multiple image array within a single media focus controller It would be awesome if there was a way to provide a caption and title for a photo that has been tapped on Support for storyboard any example or something Adding the view of a view controller to another view controllers view is not a good practice We might consider deprecating the showImage methods that lack the inViewController argument This also reduces the number of codebranches to support and is likely to ease the handling of interface orientation How to reproduce Launch the demo project and rotate the device few times Issue the image view doesnt rotate accordingly with device When it rotates accordingly if you double tap on it the image rotates to the default state
