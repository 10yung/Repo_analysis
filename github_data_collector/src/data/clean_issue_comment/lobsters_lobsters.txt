 Feature requests are no longer being accepted unless in the form of a pull request with code Dont be fooled by the feature requests pushcx posts to share plans and invite contributions Issues and PRs are typically reviewed Wednesday and some Thursday mornings When I visit my Account Settings I see Keybase listed under External Accounts but where the others have a Connect link Keybase has nothing Heres a screenshot of what I mean Window capture I checked in the browser debugger and it looks like the keybaseproofsproofshtmlerb partial is not rendering at all Window capture copy Issues and PRs are typically reviewed Wednesday and some Thursday mornings Adds a new route for returning the RSS feed for top submissions Id like to see the Vote link moved on top in mailing list story emails which links to the Lobsters story submission This is for when youve mailing list mode for stories enabled in your user settings For each submitted story it currently sends an email with a link to the article the article body and the Lobsters submission link at the bottom I always scroll to this last link and open the Lobsters submission page first to see whether the submission is interesting Is moving this submission link to the top something that is open for discussion Id be happy to submit a PR Notice the following post from mockturtle on IRC mockturtle Unit testing C code with LD PRELOAD c testing friendlysock The underscore has been replaced by a space The reason for this is in scriptmailnewactivityrb as this is the script that sends an email to mockturtle with the required info The subject line is Qencoded but the underscore character is plain ASCII and not UTF It doesnt get encoded properly and is left as is because of this Underscore means space in Qencoding thus it is replaced by a space character on IRC A proposed fix would be to lookup which encoded version a literal underscore should have and do an initial replace before the pack function is called This PR includes two features It makes the URL dupe checker ignore URLs with anchors so that scenario A is covered It makes the URL dupe checker consider scenario B it does so by appending a to the URL and searching for a pattern where it matches the URL plus any characters after the Scenario A Alice submits the following URL three minutes later Bob tries submitting Scenario B Alice submits the following URL three minutes later Bob tries submitting Today someone submitted and someone else submitted a few minutes later The dupe checker shouldve caught and prevented this by ignoring any anchors main at the end of the URL Users can elect to receive email notification for comment replies comment mentions and private messages If the provided email address begins bouncing we should turn off notification for that user Further it would be nice to send them a private message indicated we modified their preferences and explaining why Bounces are returned to our noreply address and we have an existing script for mailing list mode that could be amended to handle nondeliverable addresses Addresses the two issues we saw last night by Add a full text index to the storycache column This should improve the search performance and clean up one of the larger issues the site has been having for a while Migrates the domain method over to a full table This will let us start to flag heavy promoting stories some point down the road Add a page for domains that mirrors what we have for tags This lets us use an index over a regexp search on the search controller when loading a list of all stories for a given domain My Keybase proof has somehow been borked Heres the steps I remember taking cant guarantee these are STR but its the closest I can give Go to Start the Keybase proof IIRC the page just tells you to run keybase prove lobsters but I cant really remember Enter your Lobsters username in my case strugee hit enter and get the message Checking will continue while you go authorize the proof on Lobsters To cancel hit Cc Hit CtrlC Run keybase prove lobsters again Answer yes at the prompt about overwriting the old proof Go through the proof flow normally Result Lobsters thinks the proof went just fine and links me to in my profile But Keybase seems to disagree both the proof attempts show as revoked At the time this happened I was on Keybase client I have since upgraded Adding an aria button for folder button on comments aria expanded to play well w a y This PR is in reference to While using Qutebrowser or Vimium for FFChrome you cannot collapse comments with the keyboard alone This is due to the comment collapsing label not being treated as a button by QutebrowserVimium Adding a role of button to the labelcommentfolder makes this much more enjoyable to use Im not sure of the a y implications If anyone has knowledge on this portion if it might hurt accessiblity I would appreciate to hear your thoughts Referenced MDN for the accessibility bit Looks like ariaexanded fits this case perfectly
