 Desired behaviour When I create the following alias inside a desk bash Tmux shortcut alias ttmux And add to the same desk the following function bash Do something cool function tns I would to receive the following output when type desk with the desk loaded global Common shared configurations t Tmux shortcut tns Do something cool Actual behaviour When I do that I receive global Common shared configurations t Tmux shortcut Do something cool Do something cool tns Do something cool Aditional info Ive noticed that this only happens with aliases that has a high similarity with functions For example I have a k alias and a kl alias This wont happen But if I have a k alias and a kl function this happens Extra instructions for ohmyzsh The commandoffset function is provided by bashcompletion Im not sure if this should assume that environment or offer any alternatives Running strace desk run hello something leads to desk deciding my shell is strace so it invokes strace ic something This actually runs something but without the requested desk environment and a confusing strace warning and output This makes desk unusable in some pipelines or any pipelines if you dont like guessing This is a little complicated to reproduce For instance changing the first command from ls to seq usually succeeds Im not sure what the reason is here but it is likely related to the fact that seq can produce output sooner than ls bash desk run hello ls desk run hello tac hangs C Stopped desk run hello ls desk run hello tac fg desk run hello ls desk run hello tac exits Or if run with no controlling tty we get warnings but the pipeline is otherwise functional bash desk run hello ls desk run hello tac bash cannot set terminal process group Inappropriate ioctl for device bash no job control in this shell bash cannot set terminal process group Inappropriate ioctl for device bash no job control in this shell correct output follows I think this all has something to do with multiple shells trying to manage the foreground process on the terminal This can be avoided if desk run stops using the i flag and simply injects DESKENV in front of the command to run With the old url gitgithubcomjamesobdeskgit we get a Permission denied error ubuntuip git clone gitgithubcomjamesobdeskgit Cloning into desk The authenticity of host githubcom cant be established RSA key fingerprint is SHA nThbg kXUpJWGl E IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw E SY Are you sure you want to continue connecting yesno yes Warning Permanently added githubcom RSA to the list of known hosts Permission denied publickey fatal Could not read from remote repository Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists I am getting the following error when trying to open a Deskfile in the terminal window of PhpStorm usrlocalbindesk line exec jeditermbashin bash i not found Seems to be because the terminal plugin in Phpstorm is opening terminal sessions with additional flags which contain a path This makes the approach chosen by desk to determine the shell interpreter impossible bash binbash rcfile UserswesselvdvLibraryApplication SupportJetBrainsToolboxappsPhpStormch PhpStormappContentspluginsterminaljeditermbashin login i Adds the ability to load a desk into the current shell Useful for things like tmux where weve already started a new shell Usage eval desk load namedir Fixes When I switch to a desk and then create a new terminal window eg urxvt I would love to have this use the same desk This could be similarly accomplished as we do it with resuming on the same path Im just wondering if anyone is doing this already and could point me in the right direction What would also be interesting is to start urxvt in a specific desk mode thanks Hello Thanks for desk its really clever and useful I think it will be nice to add a trigger when we edit a desk from inside desk edit to exit and reload the desk Great script
