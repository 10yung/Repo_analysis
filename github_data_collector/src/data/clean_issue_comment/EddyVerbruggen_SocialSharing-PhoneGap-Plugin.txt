Hi Eddy Awesome work with this plugin I came across a weird issue can you guide me a little towards the right direction Problem When sharing a sms on iOS a popup opens which nudges the body element with a styleheight calc XXXpx this again disappears after the popup is closed however this disrupts my apps behaviour and keeps it enlarged Attached the before after images WhatsApp Image at PM WhatsApp Image at PM WhatsApp Image at PM Screenshot at PM Screenshot at PM Hi I dont know why but i tag doesnt work in iOS sharing Is there any workaround Thanks iOS version Plugin version Platform Ionic Cordova Calling share or shareWithOptions does not seem to work when you define message or an array of files This is on Ionic but it seems to be a plugin issue as inspecting the plugin in Xcode shows that activityItems on line has the correct values Example Component typescript import Component ViewChild from angularcore import SocialSharing from ionicnativesocialsharingngx Component selector example templateUrl examplehtml export class ExampleComponent ViewChildContent content Content constructor private socialSharing SocialSharing async shareFilefileURI string await thissocialSharingshareWithOptions message Message subject Subject files fileURI In the plugin activityItems will be an NSMutableArray of the message string and an NSURL representing the resource which is expected For our application we need to share a text message caption along with a video We need to present all the options and when the Messages app is selected we expect to see Message followed by the playable video via the filepath of the video on the device Instead we see the following occurrences Only the video is present Only the message caption is present If fileURI is an online resource served via HTTPS only the video is correctly displayed the first time and playable However if you click Cancel on the New Message Modal and then click Messages again the video disappears and only the message caption is present If fileURI is a resource on the device only scenario happens Switching the block from executing on the commandDelegate to execute on the main dispatch queue has no effect either Is our desired functionality possible via shareWithOptions Any help would be greatly appreciated The documentation says This plugin requires permissions to the users photos I was wondering why actually It doesnt contain any functionality of users selecting photo from photo library or camera roll the only option is to pass an URL Is this permission needed because the plugin still needs read permissions to access that photo library file file and so on The subject is always displayed as undefined when I shared it onto WhatsApp and Facebook on my Android phone Is anyone facing the same issue When opening the social sharing and clicking on Twitter the dialog will present itself and close itself in a matter of seconds making it impossible for me to use Hello In android devices its working fine but on ios device we are facing an issue Only text message shared to whatsapp but image not shared Please help to solve this issue as soon as possible
